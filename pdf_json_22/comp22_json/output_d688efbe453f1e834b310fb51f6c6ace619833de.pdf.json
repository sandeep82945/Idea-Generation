    "abstractText": "To address the difficulty of extracting the features of composite-fault signals under a low signal-to-noise ratio and complex noise conditions, a feature-extraction method based on phase-space reconstruction and maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy deconvolution is proposed. Using the Re\u2019nyi entropy as the performance index, which allows for a favorable trade-off between sporadic noise stability and fault sensitivity, the noise-suppression and decomposition characteristics of singularvalue decomposition are fully utilized and integrated into the feature extraction of composite-fault signals by the maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy deconvolution. Verification based on simulation, experimental data, and a bench test proves that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods regarding the extraction of composite-fault signal features.",

Introduction\nAs a core component ensuring the safety of aircraft flight, aeroengines have a complex structure and need to operate continuously for a prolonged time under extremely severe conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, high speed, high strength, and variable load. The failure of rolling bearings, as a common component of aeroengines, seriously affects the aircraft flight safety. Hence, the early fault diagnosis of key aeroengine components is of great significance to ensuring flight safety and lowering economic and life losses [1]. Given the tight arrangement and complex structure of aeroengines, it is difficult to arrange vibration-monitoring sensors at the proximal end of the core components. As a result, the dynamic response of the core component failure will be subjected to the modulation of complex transfer paths, as well as the impact of other excitations [2,3]. Moreover, the early bearing fault may appear as a composite fault with multiple coexisting faults. Due to the coupling and interference among different faults and between faults and other excitations, the identification and separation of fault-signal features are hardly achievable, which produces huge challenges regarding the fault diagnosis of aircraft bearings [4]. To separate and extract the composite bearing fault features under complex excitations, it is necessary to deal with three aspects, namely, the selection of the sensitive feature norm, the suppression method of noise and other excitations, and the separation and decoupling method of composite noise, in order to attain a preferable performance. Kurtosis (Sk), as a sensitive feature capable of detecting instantaneous impacts, has received extensive attention in the fault-diagnosis field in recent years. Its successful application has been seen in the diagnosis of wind-turbine gear faults [5]; the vibration source identification for offshore wind turbines [6]; and the detection of gearbox composite faults [7], planetary gearbox faults [8], and rolling bearing faults [9], achieving a good effect.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24101459 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459 2 of 18\nAntoni [10] elaborated on the relevant theory of Sk and formally gave its mathematical definition, i.e., the energy-normalized fourth-order spectral cumulant. Later, in 2007, a fast kurtogram (Fk) method based on short-time Fourier transform or finite impulse-response bandpass filter was proposed capable of adaptively obtaining the appropriate filter center frequency and bandwidth and effectively extracting the fault features. This method has greatly promoted the Sk application in the fault-diagnosis field. Subsequently, Lee [11] introduced a weighted kurtogram approach, whereas Wang [12] adaptively determined the filter bandwidth and center frequency by maximizing the filtered signal Sk through the incorporation of a right-expanding window. Although the above methods have all improved the Fk method to varying degrees and enhanced the fault-signal monitoring ability, all of them have encountered an unavoidable problem in practical use. That is, the primary function of Sk is to find instantaneous impacts. Thus, they are excessively sensitive to random impulses. Moreover, the inevitable sporadic strong impulse signals in actual production will greatly interfere with the ability of Sk to distinguish the real fault signals, which will even lead to the filtering failure [13]. In recent years, as an extended form of Shannon entropy, Re\u2019nyi entropy (Re), has been widely used in the estimation of signal information content [14]. Bo\u0161kosk and Juric\u030cic\u0301 [15] proposed a new method to diagnose gearbox faults, using Re\u2019nyi entropy as the characteristic index. Subsequently, it is also widely used in the fault diagnosis of bearings [16,17]. Given the structural peculiarity of the rotating machinery and bearings, the bearing signals are generated essentially by some periodic or cyclic mechanisms, so the dynamic response of bearings has cyclostationary features, and their fault signals exhibit typical repetitive transient characteristics [18]. Deconvolution is effective at eliminating the influence of complex transfer paths and enhancing the impact vibration characteristics of periodic faults. At its core, this method designs a finite impulse-response (FIR) filter with the aim of maximizing the value of the post-filtering signal sensitive characteristic index. For example, the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) proposed by Wiggins [19], which finds the optimal filter based on the filtering result Sk, enables the iterative extraction of the impact signals from the test signals with unknown transfer paths. With advantages such as requiring less parameter adjustment and possessing fast convergence, MED has been widely applied in the field of mechanical fault-diagnosis [20,21]. However, since MED aims at Sk maximization in the iterative process, the iterations are more inclined to extract unit-impulse signals with larger values, which often fall into the local optimal solution. In 1984, Cabrelli [22] proposed the optimal minimum entropy deconvolution (OMED) and proved that it was an accurate global optimal solution. To improve the sensitivity of the MED technique to periodic impulse signals, McDonald [23] proposed the maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution (MCKD) in 2012, with which the problem of periodic impulse deconvolution is solved. On the downside, MCKD requires the presence of priori knowledge about the fault cycle, which easily falls into the local optimal solution and is susceptible to strong noise interference. Later, McDonald put forward the multipoint optimal minimum entropy deconvolution adjusut (MOMEDA) in 2017, which eliminated the discontinuity problem between input signals and addressed some problems with OMED and MCKD, achieving preferable effects. However, all of the aforementioned deconvolution methods are considered for single-fault conditions, which are ineffective in the case of impulse signals with different periods caused by composite faults. Phase-space reconstruction (PSR) is suitable for typical nonlinear and nonstationary mechanical impulse faults, which reflect the dynamic characteristics of the system under various fault states in a high-dimensional space. Despite receiving extensive attention from scholars in the industry [2], the use of sequential deconvolution methods of phase-space reconstruction for fault diagnosis is problematic since the sequential use of multiple methods inevitably produces signal distortion. Moreover, the use of more sequential methods indicates higher unpredictability of inter-method coupling. Singular-value decomposition (SVD), as a phase-space reconstruction algorithm with zero-phase and -time shifts, has been widely applied in extracting features of early weak-fault signals [24]. Zhao [25] discussed the similarity\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459 3 of 18\nbetween SVD and the wavelet decomposition in signal processing, believing that SVD has the noise-suppression characteristics, as well as decomposition and extraction characteristics. On the basis of the above literature analysis, because the kurtosis is too sensitive to the occasional pulse signal, it affects the accuracy of fault identification. A new method is proposed that integrates the phase-space reconstruction technique into the maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy deconvolution; in this method, the Re\u2019nyi entropy, which can better balance the sensitivity of fault and the stability of accidental noise, is chosen as the performance index, the maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy is taken as the optimization objective, and deconvolution is chosen as the optimization method, in order to solve the problem of the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the composite-fault recognition rate, while the phase-space reconstruction technique is combined with Re\u2019nyi entropy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the concept and process of Re\u2019nyi entropy, the maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy, the maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy deconvolution, and the phase-space reconstruction are introduced. In the third part, the method of phase-space reconstruction combined with maximum correlation Re\u2019nyi entropy deconvolution is introduced. In Sections 3 and 4, the algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms by using simulation, experimental data, and the bench test. The final conclusions are provided in Section 5.\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Re\u2019nyi Entropy (Re)\nIt is assumed that the incomplete probability set of a random event X is p = {p1, p2, . . . , pn}, and its overall probability sum is \u03c9(p) := \u2211i pi \u2264 1. Then, the generalized Re parameterized by order a can be defined as\nHR\u03b1 (p) = 1 1\u2212 \u03b1 log2 \u2211i p\u03b1i \u2211i pi \u03b1 > 0, \u03b1 6= 1 (1)\nThe parameter \u03b1 in R\u00e9nyi entropy can be used to make it more or less sensitive to particular segments of the probability distributions. The exponent \u03b1 helps to provide flexibility by highlighting the values closer to the edges of the probability distribution [26]. The definition of generalized Re is introduced into the actual vibration detection, and the number set x = {x1, x2, . . . , xN} is assumed as the discrete observation of the actual vibration process. Let there be a non-negative number set \u03be = {\u03be1, \u03be2, . . . , \u03ben}; x corresponds to {\u03bei} in a one-to-one manner and satisfies 0 \u2264 \u03bei \u2264 1 and N \u2211\ni=1 \u03bei \u2264 1. According to the\ndefinition of generalized Re, the set {\u03bei} can be regarded as the probability distribution function of random variable x(t), and \u03bei is the probability of the instantaneous amplitude xi for x(t). In actual production, normal bearings often produce Gaussian vibration characteristics. In the presence of a fault, the vibrations collected from defective bearings exhibit a non-Gaussian distribution due to the fault-excited relative increase in the number of large-amplitude components. Moreover, the energy of the periodic impulse signal and the level of defect-induced excitation will increase with the defect development, ultimately resulting in the change of HR\u03b1 value. Hence, Re is able to monitor the bearing-health status.\nTo ensure the non-negativity of \u03bei, its value can be derived from the following formula:\n(\u03bei)r = f (xi) = yi\n\u2211i yi , yi = { |xi \u2212 \u00b5|, r = av (xi \u2212 \u00b5)2, r = sv\n(2)\nwhere \u00b5 denotes the mean value of {xi} and the subscript r represents the conversion method. Obviously, Formula (2) satisfies two basic conditions of generalized Re: 0< \u03bei < 1\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459 4 of 18\nand \u2211i(\u03bei)r \u2261 1. By assuming \u00b5 = 0 without a loss of generality, the generalized Re of order \u03b1 can be obtained as\n(H\u03b1)r = 1 1\u2212 \u03b1 log2 (1/N)\u2211Ni=1 y \u03b1 i( (1/N)\u2211Ni=1 yi )\u03b1 + log2 N, \u03b1 > 0, \u03b1 6= 1 (3)\nWe can let\nGM\u03b1r = (1/N)\u2211Ni=1 y \u03b1 i( (1/N)\u2211Ni=1 yi )\u03b1 =  (1/N)\u2211Ni=1|xi | \u03b1 ((1/N)\u2211Ni=1|xi |) \u03b1 , r = av, \u03b1 > 0, (1/N)\u2211Ni=1(x 2 i ) \u03b1\n((1/N)\u2211Ni=1 x2i ) \u03b1 , r = sv, \u03b1 > 0\n(4)\nIt is clear from Formulas (3) and (4) that when measuring the amplitude distribution of {xi}, GM\u03b1r is equivalent to (H\u03b1)r and is the kernel function of (H\u03b1)r. The two cases of Formula (4) can be written as a unified expression as\nMn = (1/N)\u2211Ni=1 x n i(\u221a\n(1/N)\u2211Ni=1 x 2 i )n = (1/N)\u2211Ni=1 xni\u03c3n (5) As is clear from Formula (5), GM\u03b1r can be regarded as the generalization of Re. Obvi-\nously, by choosing different r and \u03b1 values, various statistical parameters can be derived from GM\u03b1r . When r = av, a = 3, r = sv, a = 3/2, and a = 2, the following three statistical indicators can be derived separately:\nGM3av = (1/N)\u2211Ni=1|xi | 3\n((1/N)\u2211Ni=1|xi |) 3 = Re, r = av, a = 3\nGM3/2sv = (1/N)\u2211Ni=1((x 2 i ))\n3/2\n((1/N)\u2211Ni=1(x2i )) 3/2 =\n(1/N)\u2211Ni=1|xi | 3\n\u03c33 = Sr r = sv, a = 3/2\nGM2sv = (1/N)\u2211Ni=1((x 2 i ))\n((1/N)\u2211Ni=1(x2i )) 2 =\n(1/N)\u2211Ni=1 x 4 i\n\u03c34 = Sk r = sv, a = 2\n(6)\nAccording to Formula (6), GM2sv is equivalent to Sk and GM 3/2 sv is equivalent to the\nthird-order moment Skewness (Sr). Thus, GM3av has become a new statistical indicator Re, i.e., the narrow-sense Re proposed herein. This means that Re has a similar mathematical expression to Sk and Sr. Therefore, Re, Sr, and Sk can be considered as different expressions derived from the generalized Re, all of which can be explained by generalized Re theory.\nSuppose the fault at the inner ring of rolling bearing is\nx(t) = M\n\u2211 j\naje\u2212g\u03b3(t)cos[\u03c90 \u221a 1\u2212 g2 ( \u03b3(t)\u2212 \u03c4j ) where aj is the magnitude of the Jth fault shock, g denotes the attenuation coefficient of the bearing, M is the number of excitation of the bearing shock, \u03b3(t) is the pseudo-cycle time, T denotes the period of the bearing fault shock, \u03c4j stands for the time delay due to relative slip, and fe stands for the fault characteristic frequency. The values of the simulation parameters are shown in Table 1.\nFigure 1 depicts the variations of Sk, Sr, and Re with the fault defect at the inner ring of the rolling bearing. To facilitate understanding and display, the defect evolution\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459 5 of 18\nis converted into the SNR change. According to Figure 1, Sr is insensitive to the defect size, while Re and Sk share similar variation trends. Thus, clearly, Re and Sk are highly sensitive to the alterations of fault defects, which can rather accurately indicate the bearing faults.

The deconvolution method can effectively eliminate the influence of intricate transmission paths and enhance the fault-impact vibration characteristics. In this study, a novel MCReD-based method is proposed to overcome the limitations of heavily Gaussian and non-Gaussian background noises.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459 7 of 18\nAn actual fault signal of the aeroengine bearing will contain multiple components, which can be expressed as\nx(t) = hd \u2217 d + hu \u2217 u + he \u2217 e\nx =  x1 x2 ...\nxN\n, d =  d1 d2 ...\ndN\n, u =  u1 u2 ...\nuN\n, e =  e1 e2 ...\neN\n (10)\nwhere x stands for the vibration signal acquired by remote vibration sensor; d stands for the impulse signal generated by a faulty aero-engine bearing; u represents the interference signal generated by the other aero-engine components; e refers to the background noise; and hd, hu, and he, respectively, stand for the transfer functions corresponding to different inputs.\nThe core idea of the MCReD algorithm is to find the global optimal FIR filter \u2192 f by\nthe deconvolution operation on the basis of eliminating the background noise and other interfering elements to the maximum extent, in order to highlight the pulse sequence in the fault signal, it can be expressed mathematically as: \u2192 y = \u2192 f \u2217 (\u2192 hu \u2217 \u2192 u ) + \u2192 f \u2217 (\u2192 hd \u2217 \u2192 d ) + \u2192 f \u2217 (\u2192 he \u2217 \u2192 e ) St. \u2192 f \u2217 (\u2192 hu \u2217 \u2192 u ) \u2192 0 where \u2192 f = [ f1 f2 . . . fL] T \u2192 f \u2217 (\u2192 hd \u2217 \u2192 d ) + \u2192 f \u2217 (\u2192 he \u2217 \u2192 e ) \u2192 0 (11)\nFrom Formula (7) and the discrete signal convolution formula, the following can be deduced:\nyn = \u2211Lk=1 fkxm, m = n\u2212 k + 1 (12) Without a loss of generality, the relevant conclusion can be illustrated by the Formula (7)\nfor first-order Cre (M = 1).

Phase-Space Reconstruction(PSR)\nMCReD can enhance the periodic impulse signals and eliminate the negative effects of transfer function and sporadic impulse-response. However, similar to the case of the MCKD method, its ability to extract composite faults with different periods is unsatisfactory at low SNR. PSR, as a time-series analysis technique, recovers important system-component information from the high-dimensional space that is extended from a one-dimensional time series. The phase-space trajectory matrix Xr composed of original signals is a Hankel matrix, which can be reconstructed by selecting the components of fault information based on the noise-suppression and decomposition characteristics of SVD. For a phase-space trajectory matrix Xr\u2208RL\u00d7N , regardless of whether its rows and columns are correlated or not, there must be orthogonal matrices U = u1, u2 . . . un \u2208 RL\u00d7N and V = v1, v2 . . . vn \u2208 RL\u00d7N , so that\nXr = USVT = i=L\n\u2211 i=1\n\u03b4iuivi = i=L\n\u2211 i=1 Ai (21)\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1459 9 of 18\nis established. In the formula, the diagonal matrix is S = diag[\u03b41, \u03b42 . . . \u03b4m], where \u03b41 \u2265 \u03b42 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03b4m > 0. Formula (20) is called the SVD of x(t). The main diagonal element of S is the singular value of the matrix Xr. Ai is defined as the subspace of matrix X, and the signal x\u2032i (l) reconstructed by the anti-diagonal method is defined as the sub-signal discretization. In PSR, different subspaces can be selected for reconstruction to represent different signal characteristics. After the selection of sub-spaces, signals can be reconstructed to obtain a reconstructed phase-space that can represent the signal characteristics.\nXcr= \u2211i\u2208P \u03c3iuivi (22)\nwhere P stands for the sub-signal screening Substituting the reconstruction matrix into Formula (19) yields\n\u2192 f =\n( \u2211Nn=1 yn )2 2\u2016 \u2192 b \u2016 3 [ Xc0(X c 0) T ]\u22121 \u2211Mm=0 XcmT \u2192 a (23)\nAfter the integration of the PSR, substantial priori knowledge required by MCReD will no longer be important. The rather important filter length L and period T in MCKD, for instance, only require suitable value-taking in PSR-MCReD due to the noise-suppression, decomposition, and extraction characteristics of PSR, where no accurate fault eigenperiod is needed. Thus, PSR-MCReD also has a certain blind-solution property.\n2.5. Determination of Screening Space\nWith the PSR algorithm, screening of the subspace containing more fault information for reconstruction is critical. Using the sub-signal Re as the performance indicator, this study carries out reconstruction by selecting the subspace that contains subsignal mapping with a maximum Re value.\n1. Phase-space trajectory matrix Xr is subjected to SVD. 2. Ai values of various orders are derived separately, and the anti-diagonal method is\nused to reconstruct the sub-signals x\u2032 i (l) of various orders for Ai. 3. Rei = Re ( x\u2032 i (l) ) is calculated and arranged in descending order as [Rei1, Rei2, . . . , Reij], Rei1 \u2265 Rei2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 Reij > 0. 4. By adopting the difference method Dj\u22121 = Reij \u2212 Reij\u22121 and solving max(Dj\u22121), the number of elements in the P space is determined to be j \u2212 1. 5. Screening space P is obtained based on the i mapped by Seij.\n3. PSR\u2013MCReD-Based Fault-Diagnosis Method\nIn the phase-space reconstruction, the key of the phase-space reconstruction algorithm is to filter the subspace that contains more fault information. In this paper, the Re\u2019nyi entropy of the subsignal is taken as the performance index, and the subspace containing the maximum Re\u2019nyi entropy subsignal mapping is selected for reconstruction. The specific flowchart is shown in Figure 5.\n1. Fault signal is input. 2. Xcr is calculated according to the screening space selection method for PSR. 3.

Since the aeroengines are often tightly arranged, t vib ati n sensors can ha dly be installed at the proximal end, which causes great difficulties in the feature-extractio of fault signals. Aeroengine vibra ion data we e acquired from an acce sory gearbox (Safran, France) [28]. Figure 10 displays the structural schematic of the aeroengine and the locations of sensors. At the L5 shaft location, outer ring spalling damage and retainer failure were present for the rolling bearing structure. Vibration sensors were arranged near the L1 and L5 shafts of the gearbox, while the rotational speed sensors were arranged on the L4 shaft. Measured data of vibration sensor 2 was selected for analysis, and the rotational speed and fault eigenfrequency were calculated according to the L4 shaft speed, the numbers of teeth on L4 and L5 shafts, and the bearing parameters of L5 rolling bearing (Table 3). Through comparison with the FK and FSC [29] algorithms, the ability of FSR-MCReD to extract features of aeroengine fault signals was verified. Entropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 18\nFigure 10.

Conclusions This paper indicatively introduces the Re\u00b4nyi entropy, which can better balance the fault sensitivity and the stability of the accidental pulse signal, into the fault diagnosis of an aero-engine. The signal transmission noise and accidental noise are solved by MCReD. In order to better decouple the complex fault signals and improve the extraction ability of MCReD under low SNR conditions, the PSR technique is integrated into the MCReD, not a simple combination. The proposed method has achieved good results in simulation and experimental verification. 1. In this study, a novel method for extracting the fault-signal features of aeroengine\ncore components based on maximum CRe deconvolution integrating PSR is proposed. Through simulation analysis, experimental data, and a bench test, the advantages of the proposed method over the existing signal feature-extraction methods are verified regarding the extraction of complex fault-signal features under low SNR and complex noise interference.\n2. The mathematical formulas for Sk, Sr, and the narrow-sense Re proposed in this study are deduced based on the generalized Re. The three performance indicators can all be regarded as different expressions for generalized Re. As revealed by a simulation experiment on the correlations of the three with fault sensitivity and sporadic noise stability, both Re and Sk are highly sensitive to the faults, and Re is more stable to sporadic noise. 3. Inspired by CK, a definition of CRe is given, which has a better suppression effect on the sporadic and harmonic noises. By deriving the solution formula of MCReD, a non-iterative method for solving the MCReD of the optimal filter is proposed. 4.
