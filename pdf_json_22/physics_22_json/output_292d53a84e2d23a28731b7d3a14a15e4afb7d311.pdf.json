Introduction\nThe transfer matrix method has been widely applied to model periodic heating\nproblems in layered structures, since Carslaw and Jaeger developed the analogous heat transfer formalism[1] to its electric[2] and elastic[3-4] counterparts. Feldman replaced the commonly used temperature and flux vector components with counter-propagating thermal waves[5], making it more analogous to the treatment in electromagnetices and optics. This matrix methodology has subsequently been implemented to analyze experimental data of well-known techniques for thermal measurements at the nanoscale, such as the 3\ud835\udf14 method[6-9], the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method[10-13] and the frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) method[14-15].\nHowever, this transfer matrix formalism has an intrinsic numerical instability\nproblem, which has not yet drawn enough attention to the heat transfer community. This problem arises from the fact that one diagonal element of the matrix exponentially decays while the other diagonal element exponentially blows up as the film thickness and/or the heating frequency increases. This issue has long been ignored since it only\nmanifests itself when the heating frequency and/or the total thickness of the multilayer stack increases to some critical value that was of no practical interest. For example, for a SiO2/Cu (50nm/50nm) alternating multilayer stack, the transfer matrix approach starts to break down only when the heating frequency increases to beyond GHz for microns thick stack (see, for example, Fig. 3c). This GHz heating frequency was thought to be unpractical before, but is becoming reasonable in the context of the evergrowing clock frequency of CPUs.\nOn the other hand, the wave community had long been suffered from this numerical\ninstability problem[16-21]. Until 1988, did Ko and Inkson address this shortcoming by introducing the so-called scattering matrix scheme to model electron transmission in nonperiodic semiconductor heterostructures[22]. The essential idea is to regroup the inputs and outputs bridged by the matrix such that both of its diagonal elements exponentially decay, and thus avoid the numerical problem of the transfer matrix methodology. In 1999, Whittaker and Culshaw introduced this scattering matrix scheme to model the propagation of electromagnetic waves through multilayer structures[23]. However, to our knowledge, this numerically stable scattering matrix methodology has not yet been employed to treat the underlying heat transfer model of any experimental techniques.\nHere we present the scattering matrix formalism to model periodic heat diffusion\nin stratified solid media. In Section II, we highlight the numerical instability problem of the transfer matrix scheme, and introduce the scattering matrix formalism using the one-dimensional diffusion equation. We consider the most general scenario in which the heater line is buried inside the multilayer structure. In Section III, we generalize the scattering matrix framework to multidimensions, with the 3 \ud835\udf14 method as a concrete example. As sanity checks, we verify the framework using widely known solutions. In Section IV, we demonstrate the numerical stability of the scattering matrix formalism using a configuration that mimics the three-dimensional integration technology for processor architecture design. In Section V, we demonstrate with synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d that, in certain scenarios, this scattering matrix formalism could be employed to extract thermal properties, which is challenging for other schemes.\nII. Mathematical framework\nIn this section, we review the widely used transfer matrix method to solve heat\ndiffusion problems [6-10], and point out its numerical instability issue. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the concept of the scattering matrix used in the electrical and the optical communities[22-23], and apply it to model heat diffusion in layered structures."

Apply the framework to the 3 \ud835\udf4e method\nIn section II, we develop the scatter matrix formalism for the one-dimensional\n(1D) diffusion equation. We now generalize the framework to two-dimensional (2D) in this section, using the 3 \ud835\udf14 method as a concrete example. A. From 1D to 2D\nAlthough the original 3\ud835\udf14 method was derived in a cylindrical coordinate[1, 24], here,\nto take into account the anisotropy of films and substrates, we follow Ref. [25] and choose a Cartesian coordinate. For simplicity, we assume the principal axes of the thermal conductivity tensor are aligned with the natural cartesian coordinate system defined by the heater line and sample surface, i.e., the thermal conductivity tensor is diagonalized. We briefly comment on the more general case of an anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor with finite off-diagonal terms in Appendix C.\nIsolating the time dependence and performing the Fourier cosine transform (along\nthe x-axis, see Fig. 1) to the 2D diffusion equation, one obtains\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc3b\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc67 ?\u0303? = \u2212\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc67\ud835\udf06\n2?\u0303? + \ud835\udf152?\u0303?\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc672 , (30)\nwhere \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc67\u2044 is the anisotropy ratio, and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc67 are the in-plane and the cross-plane thermal conductivities. As compared to Eqs. 3 and 5, Eq. 30 is now an ordinary differential equation with an updated complex wave vector[7]\n?\u0303?\ud835\udc57 = \u221a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc67\ud835\udf06 2 +\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc67 , (31)\nwhere \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc67\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57 is the thermal diffusivity of layer j along z-axis.\nFor the general case where the heater is located at the interface between layers j\nand j+1 (Fig. 2), one can still apply Eq. 9 to obtain the spatial component of the temperature of the heater in Fourier space:\n?\u0303?\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f = ?\u0303?\ud835\udc57+1|\ud835\udc67=\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc57+1 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57+1 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57+1\ud835\udc52\n\u2212?\u0303?\ud835\udc57+1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc57+1\n= (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57+1 \u2032 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57+1 \u2032 \ud835\udc52\u2212?\u0303?\ud835\udc57+1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc57+1)?\u0303?\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f, (32)\nwhere the normalized coefficients, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57+1 \u2032 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc57+1/?\u0303?\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57+1 \u2032 = \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57+1/?\u0303?\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f , are\ncomputed using Table II.

Demonstration of the numerical stability of the framework\nTo demonstrate the numerical stability of the scattering matrix scheme, here we\nconsider a 20 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a -wide line heater sandwiched by two identical superlattice-onsubstrate structures (Fig. 3a). We choose a 500\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a -thick silicon substrate, and 50nm/50nm-thick SiO2/Cu alternating films as the building blocks of the superlattice, with corresponding thermal conductivities[29] of \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56=148 W/m-K, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422=1.38 W/m-K,\nand \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62= 401 W/m-K, and the thermal contact resistance [30] of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422\u2212\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62 \" = 1 \u00d7 10\u22128\nm2 /W-K. Note here we neglect the possible size effect on \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62for the nanoscale Cu film. This configuration mimics the three-dimensional stacked architecture for chip packing[31-32].\nFigure 3b shows the temperature rise of the heater normalized by the corresponding\nperiodic heating power, i.e. the thermal resistance, \ud835\udc45 (= \ud835\udf03\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54./\ud835\udc430), as a function of the number of periods (\ud835\udc41 = \ud835\udc411 + \ud835\udc412 ) at a fixed heating frequency, \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b = 10 Hz, calculated using both the transfer matrix scheme (open circles) and the scattering matrix\nscheme (solid line). While both approaches work well and agree with each other for\nconfigurations with small \ud835\udc41, the transfer matrix scheme breaks down at a critical total\nnumber of periods, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 = 44. In contrast, the scattering matrix scheme works reliably regardless of \ud835\udc41 , as expected. We note that although the exact value of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 may depend on the specific numerical method to implement the integration (Eq. 33) and/or\nthe specification of the computer, the transfer matrix approach is destined to fail at some\npoint when \ud835\udc41 keeps increasing, as discussed in Section II-A.\nIn addition to the failure for thick structures, the transfer matrix scheme is also\ndestined to break down at high heating frequencies. This is confirmed by Fig. 3c, in which we fix \ud835\udc411 = \ud835\udc412 = 20 (and thus \ud835\udc41 = 40 ) and plot the \ud835\udc45 vs. \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b relation. While the transfer matrix approach (open circles) fails beyond a critical heating frequency, \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b,\ud835\udc50 \u2248 3GHz, the scattering matrix approach (solid line) is robust over the entire frequency range of interest. Like \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 in Fig. 3b, this \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b,\ud835\udc50 is destined to appear somewhere, although its exact value may depend on the specific integration method and/or the specification of the computer. Generalizing the results of Figs. 3b-c leads to the regime map in Fig. 3d. In the lower regime (white), both the transfer matrix approach and the scattering matrix approach work well in computing the temperature response of the heater, while in the other regime (gray shaded), the transfer matrix formalism breaks down but the scattering matrix formalism is still robust.\nWe briefly comment on the periodic heating in the GHz regime and beyond. First,\nthis high frequency heating is becoming realistic in integrated circuits in the context that the clock frequency of CPU has already been in the same order of magnitude. Second, the thermal wave in this regime is well localized inside the top layer for \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b >\n\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b,\ud835\udc50. For example, the critical penetration depth, \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f.,\ud835\udc50 = \u221a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56/2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b,\ud835\udc50 \u2248 6.6nm\n(Eq. 44), which is much smaller than the thickness of the upper and lower SiO2 layers adjacent to the heater, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422 =50 nm. Correspondingly, an approximate solution is to treat the SiO2 layers as semi-infinite substrates and compute the temperature rise of the heater using Eq. 43. Third, although the ballistic phonon transport should be\nconsidered in this regime[33-36]. it is still the paradigm of experimental techniques in which solutions of the diffusion equation are used to fit for effective thermal properties from experimental data[37-39]. V. Synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d to extract thermal properties\nIn addition to the application to the complicated multilayer structure in Fig. 3, the\nscattering matrix formalism can manifest its merits in experimentally extracting thermal properties even for the simple film-on-substrate configuration under certain circumstances. To demonstrate these merits, we generate three sets of synthetic \u201cexperimental\u201d data points using a 3D finite element model (FEM)[40], including \u00b11% of \u201cexperimental noise\u201d (open circles in Fig. 4). In the 3D FEM model, we fix the thickness of the silicon substrate to be \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 = 500\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a, and set the width and the length (into the page) of the heater to be \ud835\udc64 = 20\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc59 = 2,000\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a, respectively. We exert a driving periodic heat flux on the top surface of the heater, and an isothermal boundary condition (\ud835\udc47\u221e) on the bottom surface of the silicon substrate, with all the other surfaces insulated. The input thermal properties to the FEM model are summarized in Table IV. We verify that the size of the film and the substrate is large enough to ensure numerical convergence. We choose a heating frequency range of 500-2,000 Hz to ensure the assumption of a narrow heater on a semi-infinite substrate (Appendix F).\nFor all three scenarios (rows 1-3 of Fig. 4), the thermal conductivity of the silicon\nsubstrate, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 , is obtained by the slope method [24], in which the slope of the linear relation of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. vs. ln (\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3b) gives \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 . Here \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. = \ud835\udf03\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54./\ud835\udc430 , and \ud835\udf03\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54. is the amplitude of the temperature oscillation averaged across the width of the heater line. To extract \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a, we apply three approaches. In the first approach (1st column of Fig. 4), we compute the thermal resistance of the substrate, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59, using Eq. 45 and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 from the slope method. Then we obtain the thermal resistance of the thin film, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e,.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. \u2212 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 , and correspondingly \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a assuming 1D heat conduction across the thin film[27, 41]. Note in this 1D approximation approach, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a and thus \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a include the effect of the thermal\ncontact resistance between the film and the substrate, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 \" . In the second (2nd column) or the third (3rd column) approach, we treat \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a as the only free parameter to fit Eq. 46 (or Eq. 35) to the synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d using the transfer matrix (or the scattering matrix) formalism, respectively.\nThe first scenario (upper row of Fig. 4) shows a sanity check using a standard\nconfiguration of the classic 3\ud835\udf14 measurement, a 0.3\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a-thick low-\ud835\udc58 SiO2 thin film on a high-\ud835\udc58 silicon substrate. In this scenario, all the three methods succeed in extracting\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422 . Note in this scenario we include a thermal contact resistance, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 \" = 1 \u00d7 10\u22128m2-K/W[27], in the synthetic \u201cexperiment\u201d (i.e. the FEM model; Table IV), but neglect it in the fitting scheme using either the transfer matrix or the scattering matrix formalism, since the intrinsic \ud835\udc58SiO2 dominates in this scenario.\nThe second scenario (middle row of Fig. 4) replaces the SiO2 film with a 4 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a-\nthick high-\ud835\udc58 diamond film, which closely resemble a proposed configuration of post-\nsilicon heat sinks[42-43]. It is very challenging to measure this high-\ud835\udc58-film-on-substrate configuration, because the 3\ud835\udf14 method gradually loses its sensitivity to \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a as it surpasses \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 (Appendix G). In addition, the anisotropic nature of \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 and\nthe exist of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 \" that cannot be neglected in this scenario because of the high\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 make the measurement even more complicated. In the following, we will show that the scattering matrix framework offers a way to extract the cross-plane thermal conductivity of the diamond film, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67 , for this high- \ud835\udc58 -film-onsubstrate configuration, regardless of the thickness of the diamond film.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4d, the 1D approximation approach fails in measuring\nthis high- \ud835\udc58 -film-on-substrate configuration, because \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e,.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. < \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 , which implies a negative \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a We now come to a dilemma: even if we neglect\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 \" , how could the effective resistance, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e,.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 + \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a,\nbe smaller than \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 We qualitatively resolve this seemingly paradoxical problem using the following two-step argument. First, replace the SiO2 film in the first scenario (1st row of Fig. 4) with a silicon film. If one neglects the size effect of \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a (i.e. we assign \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 here), it is not hard to conclude that \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e,.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 in the heating frequency range that ensures \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f. \u226a \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56, because the combination of a silicon thin film and a semi-infinite silicon substrate is no more than a single semi-infinite silicon substrate. Second, replace the silicon film with a diamond film. Now it is easy to conclude that \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e,.\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61. < \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 , since \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67 > \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 . Therefore, in this high- \ud835\udc58 -film-on-substrate scenario, the 1D approximation approach fails. We will return to this interpretation quantitatively in the context of Fig. 5 shortly.\nWe now apply the transfer matrix and the scattering matrix methods to fit for\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67. Since \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 had been accurately measured and well documented, the sensitivity analysis in Appendix G indicates that, among the remaining input\nparameters, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67 is most sensitive to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\u2212\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 \" and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc65 .

We further assume \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc65 is obtained using the suspended microfabricated-device method with typical measurement uncertainty of 10%[44]. Fitting either the transfer matrix or the scattering matrix model to one set of typical synthetic \u201cexperiment\u201d, one obtains the only fitting parameter, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67, with 9.4% error as compared to the input value (Figs. 4e and 4f; Table IV).\nThe last scenario (lower row of Fig. 4) increases the thickness of the diamond film,\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a, from 4\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a to 7.5\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a. In this case, the \u201ctransfer matrix\u201d approach also fails due to its intrinsic numerical instability, as discussed in Section II-A. On the other hand, the scattering matrix approach is still robust in fitting \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67 with an error of 2.7% for one set of typical synthetic \u201cexperiment\u201d (Figs. 4i; Table IV). In Appendix G, we\nconduct multiple synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d to analyze the confidence interval of these \u201cmeasurements\u201d.\nAt last, we turn to quantifying our qualitative interpretation to the dilemma in Figs.\n4d and 4g. Recall Eq. 49, the full expression of the temperature rise of the film, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a. Figure 5a shows a contour plot of the dimensionless scaling factor \ud835\udc60 (Eq.

            "text": "To circumvent the intrinsic numerical instability problem of the transfer matrix\nformalism, we have generalized the scattering matrix methodology of wave propagation to model periodic heat diffusion in layered structures. We applied this scattering matrix framework to the 3 \ud835\udf14 method, and validated it with various wellknown solutions. Then we demonstrated its numerical stability in modeling the periodic heating of a thick 3D stacked architecture for chip packing at high heating frequency. We also proposed synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d to show that this framework can be used to extract thermal properties in certain circumstances when the conventional techniques break down.\nWe conclude by commenting on the potential application of this scattering matrix\nframework to two other popular experimental techniques, the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR)[10-13] and the frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR)[14-15]. As compared to the experimental setup of the 3 \ud835\udf14 method, TDTR and FDTR can be pushed to much higher heating frequencies, typically at tens of to hundreds of MHz[37, 39]. Moreover, TDTR and FDTR rely more on the transfer matrix formalism to fit for thermal properties of multilayer structures[10-15, 39]. These facts\nmake the scattering matrix formalism an ideal choice for these laser techniques to avoid numerical instability issues of the transfer matrix methodology. To summarize the analogy and the contrast, we briefly outline the key steps of implementing the scattering matrix framework to the 1D planar heating, the 2D 3 \ud835\udf14 method, and the 3D TDTR/FDTR in Table V. For the 3D case (last column of Table V), the Fourier cosine transform is replaced with a Hankel transform, and the complex wave vector, ?\u0303? , is updated correspondingly[10-15]."

These requirements set the proper\nfrequency range of the measurements.\nAn open question here is how big of the substrate is big enough Likewise, how\nnarrow of the heater line is narrow enough A common practice is to give an empirical\nsafe factor, e.g. \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f. \u2264 1 5 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f. and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f. \u2265 5 \u00d7 (\ud835\udc64/2) [45]. Dames bridges\nthese safe factors to their corresponding error tolerance[46].\nTo answer the open question above systematically, we justify the applicable regime\nof Eq. 45 using the general solution, Eq. 35. The latter is not constrained by the two requirements above. Here we define a relative error, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f. = (\ud835\udc45 \u2212 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53.)/ \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53., where \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53. is the thermal resistance defined by Eq. 44, and \ud835\udc45 is the thermal resistance (Eq. 35) corresponding to the isothermal (solid line) and the adiabatic (dashed line) boundary conditions, respectively. For example, Fig. F1a reads that \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f./\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f. > 2.40 ensures \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f. < \u00b15% . Likewise, Fig. F1b suggests that \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f./(\ud835\udc64/2) > 1.35 ensures \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f. < \u00b15%. We note here in Fig. E1b the far-side boundary condtion does not matter any more, and thus we show only the result of the isothermal boundary condition.\nIn practical measurements in a cryostat where a specific temperature point is set\nand mornitored using a thermocouple anchored near the chip carrier mounted on the copper \u201ccold finger\u201d, one might think an isothermal boundary condition for the bottom surface of the sample describes the reality most properly. However, this isothermal boundary condition requires an infinite large thermal conductivity of the \u201ccold finger\u201d and the ceramic chip carrier. This requirement cannot be satisfied, even though the thermal conductivity of copper is relatively high. On the other hand, one may choose to suspend the sample and correspondingly use an adiabatic boundary condition. However, in this case, it is not convenient to conduct measurements under various temperature points. Therefore, the semi-infinite boundary condition is still the most practical one, as long as we ensure requirement (1) above is satisfied according to Fig. E1a.\nFig. F1.

Two details are worth noting here. First, the 10% change in \ud835\udc5d applies only to the transfer matrix or the scattering matrix model, but not to the FEM model. Second, the \u00b11% of \u201cexperimental noise\u201d is not included in this sensitivity analysis.\nAmong the input thermal properties summarized in Table IV of the main text, Fig.\nG1 indicates that \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67 is most sensitive to the substrate properties, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56, due to the fact that \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 > \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \u226a \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56.

The only free parameter, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc422 (1 st row) or \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc67 (2nd and 3rd rows), is obtained and shown in the corresponding entry of Fig. 4.\nTo mimic the real measurements, in which one usually conducts the experiment\nseveral times to obtain the average value and the standard deviation to represent the \u201ctrue\u201d result and the measurement uncertainty, we generate many sets of such synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d to obtain the statistics. For example, Fig. G2 shows the results of 100 trials of synthetic \u201cexperiments\u201d for the scenario of the 7.5\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a-thick diamond film (3rd row of Fig. 4), which gives the 95% confidence interval of the vitual \u201cexperiments,\u201d 679 to 745 W/m-K.\nFig. G2.
