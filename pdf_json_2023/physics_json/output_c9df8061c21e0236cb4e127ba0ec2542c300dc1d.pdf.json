    "abstractText": "Palladium-catalyzed C-H activation reactions have attracted the attention of organic researchers due to their unique high selectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and high efficiency, and they are widely used in natural products and asymmetric synthesis. Here, we report an example of enantioselective C-H alkenylation between \u03b2-alkyl phenylethylamine compounds and styrenes with Boc-L-lle-OH as the ligand and nosylamide as the directing group. This reaction is applicable to styrene containing various electron-deficient and electron-donating substitutions and may be utilized for the synthesis of benzoazepine compounds.",

            "text": "A transition metal-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction can directly functionalize the C-H bond, which greatly simplifies the steps of traditional organic synthesis. Therefore, it is widely accepted in drug synthesis, natural product synthesis, and chemical reagent synthesis [1\u20134]. Because of the inertness of the C-H bond and the massive existence of such bonds in organic molecules, selectivity and catalytic activity have become the key problems in C-H bond activation reactions. The use of the directing group strategy effectively solves these problems. More specifically, the C-H bonds at certain positions on the substrate can be selectively activated through the coordination of the directing group with the central metal, thus controlling the regio- and stereoselectivity of the reaction [5\u201311]. The Yu group has conducted extensive and in-depth research on this issue and developed a series of C-H bond activation methods. For example, in 2011, they successfully used carboxyldirected C-H bond-activated alkenylation reactions to bond two complex fragments and then synthesized (\u00b1)-lithospermic acid succinctly and efficiently [12\u201315]. In recent years, enantioselective C-H iodination and alkylation have been achieved by combining Palladium (Pd, II) with a mono-N-protected amino acid (MPAA) ligand after kinetic resolutions [11,13,16\u201319]. Our research group investigated \u03b2-alkyl phenylethylamine compounds with fused bicyclic skeletons, which had been used in the synthesis of the natural product delavastine after Pd-catalyzed, trifluoromethanesulfonate-directed C-H alkylation and kinetic splitting. The structure of alkenylated products is similar to that of cinnamate esters and can be used for the further synthesis of dopamine receptor D1 ligands, \u03b12-adrenergic receptors, 5-HT1A receptor ligands, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and other drug molecules [20\u201322]. Styrene is an important raw material that is commonly used in chemical industrial processes; however, Pd-catalyzed C\u2212H functionalizations of styrene are challenging due\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1852. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041852 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1852 2 of 14\nto the low reactivity of the substrates. In the previous study conducted by our research group, we used palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) as a catalyst to screen ligands, oxidants, and additives. We eventually achieved enantioselective C-H alkenylation between the \u03b2-alkyl phenyl ethylamine compound and styrene, with the use of Boc-L-lle-OH as a ligand based on higher yield and selectivity. The alkenylated products can be used for the synthesis of benzoazepine compounds, which can bond with dopamine D1 receptors.

As shown in Scheme 1, the reaction with p-chlorostyrene generated the alkenylated product 2c with an ee of 95% and 40% yield, while 1ac was recovered in 46% yield, which corresponds to a selectivity factor (s) of 57.2 [23].

The fluorine and trifluoromethyl substituted styrenes are also suitable coupling agents, providing the corresponding products 2b and 2g with an ee value of 92%. Aryl bromides (2f), nitriles (2h), and esters (2i) with electron-accepting functional groups have good tolerance in this reaction. Coupling agent ligands containing the electron-donating methyl (2j), tert-butyl (2k), and methoxy groups (2m) also performed well and provided alkenylated products with excellent selectivity, especially when the ee value of 2k reached 98%. The larger substitutional groups on styrene, such as the benzene ring (2l) and the tert-butyl group (2n), have a slight impact on the selectivity.
