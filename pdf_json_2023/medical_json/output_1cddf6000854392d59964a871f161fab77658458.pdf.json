    "abstractText": "The needs of modern regenerative medicine for biodegradable polymers are wide and varied. Restoration of the viability of the vascular tree is one of the most important components of the preservation of the usefulness of organs and tissues. The creation of vascular implants com\u2010 patible with blood is an important task of vascular bioengineering. The function of the endothelial layer of the vessel, being largely responsible for the development of thrombotic complications, is of great importance for hemocompatibility. The development of surfaces with specific characteris\u2010 tics of biomaterials that are used in vascular technologies is one of the solutions for their correct endothelialization. Linear polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable structural polymeric materials suitable for obtaining various types of implants and tissue engineering, having a wide range of structural and physicomechanical properties. The use of PHA of various monomeric com\u2010 positions in endothelial cultivation makes it possible to evaluate the influence of material properties, especially surface characteristics, on the functional state of cells. It has been established that PHA samples with the inclusion of 3\u2010hydroxyhexanoate have optimal characteristics for the formation of a human umbilical vein endothelial cell, HUVEC, monolayer in terms of cell morphology as well as the levels of expression of vinculin and VE\u2010cadherin. The obtained results provide a rationale for the use of PHA copolymers as materials for direct contact with the endothelium in vascular implants.",

In reconstructive vascular technolo\u2011 gies, this lack of currently available materials prevents successful clinical applications of vascular implants such as small\u2011diameter blood vessel prostheses, heart valves, and stents. The development of polymeric materials with improved compatibility with blood is an ur\u2011 gent task inmodern research [2]. An important aspect of the hemocompatibility of vascular implants is their correct endothelialization. Dysfunction of the endothelial layer, as an in\u2011 ternal component of the vascular wall, formed in contact with the biomaterial and actively in contact with blood, largely determines the development of thrombotic complications accompanying cardiovascular implantation [3]. An interesting strategy for improving the compatibility of blood with implant materials is the development of surfaces that promote the formation of healthy endothelium, thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis [4].\nJ.

Biomater. 2023, 14, 85 2 of 18\nExperimental and clinical studies indicate the successful application of an approach that includes an analysis of the features of mechanochemical signaling and a directedmod\u2011 ification of the topography of biomaterials used in reconstructive tissue engineering [5]. Engineering of biologically active surfaces in vascular reconstructions is associated with the study and creation of micro/nanostructured surface reliefs that mimic the charac\u2011 teristics of the extracellular matrix and realize their activity in relation to cellular elements throughmechanochemical signaling systems [6\u201320]. Morphological and dimensional char\u2011 acteristics of relief elements, aswell as the degree of their ordering, can selectively influence the processes of differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis [21\u201330]. It is known that the consistency of the endothelial layer on the surface of a bioma\u2011 terial in vitro depends on the morphological features of the surface relief and the physi\u2011 cal and mechanical characteristics of the material [31\u201336]. Substrate topography has been demonstrated to be a key regulator of many endothelial cell functions, including adhesion, morphology, migration, proliferation, and gene expression in vitro [37\u201342]. The flexibility and elasticity of the material are important factors for cell growth. The search for new materials with certain topographic features is an urgent task in biomedi\u2011 cal engineering. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are bacterial polyesters that are biodegradable, bioin\u2011 ert, and hemocompatible and are being actively studied in the field of tissue engineer\u2011 ing [43,44]. It can be argued that this class of biological polyesters, being about fifty years younger in biomedicine than materials based on polylactide, is their worthy rival, hav\u2011 ing several serious advantages, including the nature of the biodegradation process (PHAs degrade in vivo with the formation of intermediates found in the human body [45,46]). The uniqueness of this class of materials is that it is possible to obtain copolymers of var\u2011 ious compositions with different physical and mechanical properties. It is known that the inclusion of such monomers as 4\u2011hydroxybutyrate (4HB), 3\u2011hydroxyvalerate (3HV), and 3\u2011hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) affects the physical and mechanical properties [47\u201349]. Features of the microstructure and surface relief of PHA samples of different monomeric composition depend on the inclusion of these monomers, which affect the biological prop\u2011 erties [50,51]. A thermoplastic polyester, poly\u20113\u2011hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), has almost the same properties as polypropylene. Pure P3HB is considered too brittle for many appli\u2011 cations, but its copolymers with monomers such as 4HB, 3HV, and 3HHx have superior mechanical properties compared to pure P3HB homopolymers. These copolymers are also being actively studied in the field of tissue reconstruction [52\u201354]. The native extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex system consisting of many macro\u2011 molecules with different biochemical and physical properties that play a key role in cell be\u2011 havior [55]. Adsorption of ECM biomolecules onto the surface of a material is a promising approach to recreate the cellular microenvironment. In vascular implants, this treatment promotes proper endothelialization of the implants, thereby reducing their thrombogenic\u2011 ity. Extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, have been shown to improve the adhesion and retention of cells to materials. These proteins provide the best support struc\u2011 ture for many cell types, and fibronectin is a suitable support structure for endothelial cells [56]. The aim of this research is to study the features of endothelialization of the surface of PHA films of various compositions with different topographic features in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The study of the surface reliefs of PHA polymers of various compositions, which is for the evaluation of endothelialization pro\u2011 cesses, will be carried out for the first time. In our research, we studied polymer films of four different compositions with various structural characteristics. Our hypothesis is that the composition of the polymer and the surface structure of PHA films, in combina\u2011 tion with the use of fibronectin (Fn) as an ECM component, can affect the parameters of adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells. The development of surfaces based on biodegradable polymer materials that are bioactive with respect to the endothelium can\nJ. Funct.

Polymer recovery from cell biomass was performed in two stages. First, lipids and fatty acids were removed using ethanol, and then the polymer was extracted with dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts were pooled and evaporated twice us\u2011 ing an R/210V rotary evaporator (B\u00fcchi AG, Flavil, Switzerland). Then, the polymer was precipitated with hexane, 1:2. Polymer content in the residual mass was determined using a 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a 5975C chromatograph\u2011mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The polymer was redissolved in chloroform several times and precipitated using isopropanol or hexane to purify it. The resulting poly\u2011 mer was dried at 40 \u25e6C. The purity and composition of the polymer were determined by chromatography of methyl esters of fatty acids after methanolysis of polymer samples using a 7890A gas chro\u2011 matograph equipped with a 5975C chromatograph\u2011mass spectrometer (Agilent Technolo\u2011 gies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The chemical composition of PHA (the set and ratio of monomers in copolymers) was determined by chromatography of methyl esters of fatty acids after methanolysis of cell biomass using a 7890A chromatograph\u2011mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a 5975C mass detector. The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of PHA were determined using gel permeation chromatography with a refractometric detector on a DB\u201135MS col\u2011 umn (Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity, Waldbronn, Germany). Weight average molec\u2011 ular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity (\u00d0) were measured using polystyrene standards (PS) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). X\u2011ray experiments were performed to determine the crystallinity of PHA specimens em\u2011 ploying a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Bruker, AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a VANTEC fast linear detector. The degree of crystallinity (Cx) was calculated as a ratio of the total area of crystalline peaks to the total area of the radiogram (the crystalline + amorphous components). The PHA films were produced using the solution\u2011cast method. PHA samples of dif\u2011 ferent chemical compositions were dissolved in choroform (3% solution) to obtain a ho\u2011 mogeneous solution using magnetic stirring with heating to 35 \u25e6C. Afterwards, the solu\u2011 tion was poured onto defatted glass, followed by drying for 48 h in a vacuum desiccator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) until the solvent was completely exhausted. The films were kept for at least 3 days in a fume hood, after which, using a template, discs were cut to the required size. The thickness of the films was measured with a LEGIONER EDM\u201125\u2011 0.001 electronic digital micrometer (Legioner, Shanghai, China). For sterilization, PHA samples were incubated three times with ethanol for 10 min, washedwith sterile distilled water, irradiatedwith UV radiation for 60min, and incubated in a culture medium for rehydration.\nJ.

The maximum degree of crystallinity for the P3HB homopolymer is 75%. The inclusion of 3HV, 3HHx, and 4HB monomers into the polymer chain leads to a decrease in the degree of crystallinity of the copolymers. The predomi\u2011 nance of the amorphous phase over crystalline is more pronounced in P3HB4HB (22%). The average molecular weight of the polymers also varied depending on the monomeric composition, being the maximum for P3HB (920 kDa) and the minimum for P3HB3HHx (486 kDa).\nThe analysis of the surface morphology of PHA films revealed differences in the relief profile and porosity. These parameters affect cell adhesion. It is known that smoother surfaces have less adhesiveness than materials with a rough surface [61,62]. Using atomic force microscopy, the samples were found to have differences in the parameters of nano\u2011roughness, which determine protein adhesion, cell growth, and at\u2011 tachment. The dependence of the surface relief on the composition of polymers was deter\u2011 mined (Table 2, Figure 1).

It is important to note that the ratios of the average pore size and area between samples of all compositions did not change after treatment with Fn, which argues in favor of the assumption of a uniform distribution of Fn on all samples. As in the works of Xiang\u2011HuaQu [63], in our case, the formation of an Fn layer on the surface of the samples contributed to the smoothing of the surface relief.\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 85 8 of 18\nIt is known that the hydrophilicity of materials is a key factor influencing the inter\u2011 action between cells and the matrix. The hydrophobicity of the surface promotes the ad\u2011 hesion of proteins, which contribute to the active cell\u2011substrate interactions [64,65]. If the surface is too hydrophobic, ECM proteins, including Fn, are adsorbed in a denatured state, and their geometry becomes unsuitable for cell binding [66]. In our study (Table 4), Fn adsorption increased the wettability of all PHA samples. A slight decrease in the con\u2011 tact angle of approximately 6\u25e6 was noted, except for P3HB4HB. The homopolymer had a maximum water contact angle of 90.7\u25e6 after treatment with Fn, remaining the most hy\u2011 drophobic of all PHAs studied. P3HB3HV, P3HB4HB, and P3HB3HHx had similar values: 78.9 \u00b1 4.21, 77 \u00b1 5.38, and 78.5 \u00b1 4.71, respectively. The experimental data are confirmed by the studies of other authors. Ya\u2011WuWang [67] investigated the effect of P3HB and P3HB3HHx hydrophilicity on the growth of the L299 cell line. Better adhesion was re\u2011 ported on lipase\u2011treated PHA surfaces with a contact angle of about 60\u201370\u25e6, compared to a surface treated with a combination of lipase and hyaluronic acid with a contact angle of about 50\u201360\u25e6. Bumgardner et al. [68] studied the surface coated with chitosan (contact an\u2011 gle 76.4\u25e6) and the titanium surface (contact angle 32.2\u25e6). It was found that the attachment of cells to the first surface was better than that of pure titanium.\nAn increase in surface energy, including its polar component, of 1\u20132 mN/m was also observed, which promotes the adhesion of ECM proteins, thereby improving cell attach\u2011 ment. In general, surface energy is a fundamental material property that can influence protein adsorption. Low surface energy and hydrophobicity generally correlate with in\u2011 creased protein adsorption, enhanced conformational changes in adsorbed proteins, and irreversible protein adsorption. Thus, the effect of surface energy on cellular response ob\u2011 served in the studies [64] was probably an indirect effect, where surface energy dictated protein adsorption and conformation, which subsequently determined a specific cellular response. Scott B. Kennedy et al. confirmed that surface energy can affect cell adhesion and proliferation through Fn, which is the dominant factor determining the response of cells to materials. A study by B. Majhy et al. [69] showed that average surface energies lead to efficient cell adhesion, growth, and proliferation. An increase in surface energy leads to the formation of stronger cell\u2011ligand bonds, which leads to increased growth and proliferation. When the critical surface energy is exceeded (more than 70 mN m\u22121), cell growth and proliferation slow down. It should be noted that endothelial cells are very demanding on the structure and qual\u2011 ity of the scaffold surface; they attach poorly and practically do not proliferate on many known materials, including cultural plastic [70]. Therefore, for the successful cultivation of endotheliocytes, it is very important to provide conditions for their attachment to the surface of the scaffold and optimal subsequent proliferation. Various materials are used as coatings to improve the adhesive properties of the surfaces of cell carriers, including gelatin, collagen, polysaccharides, and fibronectin [15,16,19]. Experience has shown posi\u2011\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 85 9 of 18\ntive results from the use of gelatin coatings for the routine use of this protein for culturing various cells, including endothelial cells [71,72]. An increase in the adhesion properties of surfaces is also provided by the application of hydrophilic coatings or treatment with chemical reagents. It should be noted that the studied polyhydroxyalkanoates, despite their high biocom\u2011 patibility and prospects for various biomedical applications, including cell technologies, are characterized by high hydrophobicity; they do not hydrolyse or swell in liquids. Thus, the contact angles of 3\u2011hydroxybutyric acid homopolymers are up to 90 \u25e6C and higher; for copolymer films, these values are slightly lower (Table 4). Therefore, in order to prepare polymer film scaffolds from PHA, it is recommended to soak them for 2\u20133 h in a sterile saline solution before seeding the cells [73]. Increasing the wettability of PHA product surfaces is also possible using physical methods, for example, hydrogen peroxide plasma treatment [74], argon or ammonia plasma [75], as well as laser irradiation [76]. However, the use of very labor\u2011intensive physical methods requires special equipment and proven processing modes. Therefore, to improve the adhesive properties of the surface of PHA films, the effec\u2011 tiveness of the use of a fibronectin coating was studied in the present work. In this case, it was necessary to find out how the adhesion of endothelial cells is affected by different concentrations of Fn covering film matrices from PHA of different chemical compositions. At the first stage, the effect of fibronectin coating on the adhesion and development of HUVEC cells was studied when they were grown on TCPS with Fn coating (Figure 3A). The TCPS coated with 1% gelatin was used as a control since this is used in the routine cultivation of HUVEC [77]. Since the purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of Fn coating and not to grow a significant number of endothelial cells, the duration of ob\u2011 servation was 24 hours. Similar durations of HUVEC culturing were described by other authors. Thus, when studying the development of endothelial cells on porous polyethy\u2011 lene glycol membranes that differ in microstructure, the duration of the experiments was also 24 hours [78,79]. A comparative study of the adherence of endothelial cells to TCPS for 24 hours, coated with gelatin and fibronectin (Figure 3A), showed a statistically sig\u2011 nificant difference in the case of using fibronectin at a concentration of 25 and 50 \u00b5g/mL. The number of live HUVEC cultured on TCPS+Fn increased commensurately with protein concentrations. The data indicate the expedient further use of the Fn coating of PHA films.\nJ. Funct.

The number of live HUVEC cultured on TCPS+Fn increased commensurately with protein concentrations. The data indicate the expedient further use of the Fn coating of PHA films.\nFigure 3.

The amount of adherent HUVEC cells on the surface of the samples of PHA films coated with fibronectin at a concentration of 25 mg/mL.\nExperimental samples with Fn at a concentration of 25 \u00b5g/mL significantly increased cell proliferation on all PHA films. The smallest number of living cells was noted in the case of the P3HB sample; in the case of P3HB4HB, there were slightly more cells. The amount of HUVEC in the case of P3HB3HV and P3HB3HHx increased by almost 2 times and was comparable with the TCPS-Fn results. In general, PHAs of various compositions modulate cellular behavior. The highest number of living cells was on the films of the P3HB3HV copolymer (12.8 \u00b1 1.3 103/cm2), and this is comparable with the result obtained with TCPS+Fn as a control. In general, all Fn-coated PHA copolymer films are suitable for culturing endothelial cells. The results obtained are consistent with the few available publications on the effect of cell matrices from PHA for culturing endothelial cells. The use of various variants of functionalization of the surface of Fn materials is also noted in the literature. XiangHuaKu et al.

These data are consistent with the work of Pompe T. et al. [80] on the modification of P3HB and P3HB4HB films with an aqueous solution of NaOH, NH3\u2011plasma, or H2O\u2011plasma and Fn. The strength of Fn interaction with the PHA surface significantly decreased after treatment with alkali; however, the adsorbed protein at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL on un\u2011 treated PHAfilms significantly improved attachment to the surface ofHUVEC cells. Xiang\u2011 HuaQu et al. [81] noted that themetabolic activity ofHUVEC is higher on P3HB3HHx com\u2011 pared to the P3HB homopolymer and its copolymer with 3HV. Samples from P3HB3HHx also had the lowest hemolytic activity compared to other samples; for example, hemolysis rates were 3 times higher for the P3HB homopolymer, and almost 2 times higher for the copolymer with 3HV. Thus, the surface morphology of PHA polymer films, which is characterized by the size and number of pores on the surface aswell as roughness, correlates with the indicators\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 85 11 of 18\nof viability and adhesion of endothelial cells. Thus, a homopolymerwith an almost smooth surface and a small relative pore area, as well as its copolymer with 4HB, which has the largest number of wide pores, have lower adhesiveness, which is confirmed by the num\u2011 ber of living cells on these films. The surface structure of the P3HB3HV and P3HB3HHx samples, which have pores of 47 \u00b1 3 and 236 \u00b1 20 nm in size with a pore area of 5.9 and 12.4%, respectively, facilitates the adhesion of HUVEC cells and corresponds to the data in the control (TCPS\u2011Fn). Gaborski et al. [78,79] demonstrated that the pores on the mem\u2011 brane can disrupt the interaction of the cell with the substrate, which is consistent with our results. D. Narayan and S. S. Venkatraman [61] studied the effect of pore size on PLLA and PLGA endothelialization. Small pores in the range of 5\u201320 \u00b5m instead of pores of 20\u201390 \u00b5m have been shown to be more preferable for culturing HUVEC. Sang Jin Lee et al. [82] noted that cells adhered well and distributed well on polycarbonate (PC) mem\u2011 branes with micropore diameters of 0.2\u20131.0 \u00b5m. Such cells had a spindle cell morphology. However, most cells with larger micropore sizes (3.0\u20138.0 \u00b5m in diameter) showed a more spherical cell shape with fewer filopodia and lamellipodia, indicating a decrease in the ad\u2011 hesiveness of the material. Zahra Allahyari et al. [62] confirmed in their review that small pores at the nanoscale promote the strongest cell\u2011substrate interactions, while the largest pores at the micron scale prevent these interactions. It is also known that smooth surfaces have weaker adhesion than the surface of a material with moderate porosity. The work of Ahmad Fikri bin Anwar Fadzil et al. [83] showed that it is more problematic for cells to adhere to a smooth surface because filopodia do not move away from the cells. Further, using scanning electronmicroscopy followed by image analysis using ImageJ software, it was found that the cells on the studied samples are smaller with a larger length\u2011 to\u2011width ratio compared to TCPS\u2011FN (Figure 5). It should be noted that the cells on the homopolymer and on its copolymer with 4HB are less flattened, which is consistent with the results of the cytotoxicity and adhesion assessments. Obviously, this is due to the smaller number of cell adhesion points on the surface of the material\u2014both the smoothest of all homopolymers and the most porous P3HB4HB. Cells that formed amonolayer had a cobblestone shape typical for endothelial cells, while single cells were more elongated and had a spindle morphology, indicating their mobility. At a small distance between single cells, contact of the lamellipodia is observed, which is the initial stage of the formation of adherens junctions (AJ). Julien Brevier et al. [84] confirmed that physical contact between adjacent cell lamel\u2011 lipodia promotes the recruitment of AJ proteins such as VE\u2011cadherin (VE\u2011cad). Indeed, a similar situation was observed during immunohistochemical staining with anti\u2011VE\u2011cad in our study. In the case of P3HB3HV, P3HB3HHx, and control samples, redistribution of VE\u2011cad into the contact zones along the cell periphery was noted (Figure 6). On the contrary, intracellular localization of VE\u2011cad was observed on the homopolymer sample, which indicates a low migration of this protein into adhesive contacts. Aggregation of VE\u2011 cad in adjacent lamellipodia of neighboring cells was also practically absent in the case of P3HB4HB, which indicates a less active interaction between cells during cultivation on samples of this composition [85,86]. In the present study, the participation of this protein in maintaining the endothelial barrier during changes dictated by the cytoskeleton in mechanochemical interactions with polymer samples with different surface profiles is considered [87\u201389]. Data from Stephan Huveneers [90] show that there is a vinculin\u2011dependent mechanosensory interaction be\u2011 tween cadherins that mediates adequate remodeling of endothelial junctions to promote, for example, transendothelial migration of leukocytes to the site of injury or infection to reduce the inflammatory response. Thus, when studying intercellular contacts, it can be noted that the maximum number of vinculin binding sites is observed on the P3HB3HHx sample at the points of contact between the lamellipodia of neighboring cells. Additionally, the minimum number of binding sites for this protein is observed in cells on a homopoly\u2011 mer sample, on which vinculin was distributed throughout the cytoplasm without active binding sites (Figure 6).\nJ.

It has been shown that treatment of PHA films with Fn at a concentration of 25 \u00b5g/mL makes the surface smoother, reduc\u2011 ing the number and area of pores. This treatment also slightly increases the hydrophilicity and surface energy of the surface, which improves adhesion and cell growth. It can be con\u2011 cluded that HUVEC adhere and proliferate on all PHA film samples. It has been shown that the surface structure has an effect on cell adhesion and proliferation. On the smoother surface of P3HB and on the surface of P3HB4HB, which has large, deep pores, a slightly smaller number of attached cells was noted. A greater amount of HUVEC with active dis\u2011 tribution of VE\u2011cad and vinculin in the contact zones of lamellipodiawas noted on samples P3HB3HHx and P3HB3HV, which indicates the consistency of intercellular and adhesive contacts of the monolayer formed on the surfaces of PHA samples. The fact that various types of cells react differently to surface topography is of significant importance in the re\u2011 search of the development of implants, since it is expected that a functionally consistent endothelial monolayer formed on the surface of PHA materials will have a significant ef\u2011 fect on the hemocompatibility of the device and thereby reduce the risks of thrombotic complications during the implantation of these devices into the bloodstream.\nAuthor Contributions: Cell culture, contact angles data analysis, G.A.R.; film production, contact angles, A.E.D.; SEM image, N.G.M.; cell culture, immunocytochemistry, N.A.A. and A.Y.E.; concept, organization, and performance of all studies, methodology, analysis, project administration, T.G.V. and E.I.S.
