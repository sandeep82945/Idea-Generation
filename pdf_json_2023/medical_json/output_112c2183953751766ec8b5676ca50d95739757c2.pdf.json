            "text": "Tooth decay (caries) is the most common chronic disease among US children yet is often neglected, leading to substantial decreases in children\u2019s quality of life and up to 10 million missed school days.1,2 Dental care is one of the greatest unmet children\u2019s health needs, with wide racial and ethnic disparities existing among racially and ethnically minoritized populations, such as American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities.3 Despite efforts to increase dental care utilization among minoritized populations, large oral health disparities remain, with Black and Hispanic children having the poorest oral health of any racial or ethnic groups in the US.4-7 In addition to lack of access to recommended care, individual health behaviors and community-related structural factors also contribute to the high risk of tooth decay in minoritized populations.5,8\nThe influences of racial and ethnic disparities and mediating factors on oral health outcomes are poorly characterized. Previous studies have evaluated the associations of socioeconomic factors with oral health outcomes and disparities.9,10 Some studies have reported that racial and ethnic oral health disparities are driven by sociodemographic and demographic factors, although the results have been mixed.11-15 While these studies assessed the role of socioeconomic factors on oral health outcomes, none incorporated the associations of race and ethnicity with these socioeconomic factors nor assessed the role of the quality of dental care. Community-level factors, such as rural areas with limited access to care, have been suggested to be associated with oral health disparities.15 However, little is known of the relative contribution of individual (socioeconomic and quality of dental care) and community context to the disparities.\nMediation analysis is used to differentiate a third-variable (eg, mediator or confounder) effect that intermediates an observed association between an exposure variable and an outcome variable.16-18 To determine whether the racial and ethnic disparities in oral health outcomes are associated with differences in socioeconomic factors or quality of care, or from the various living and working environments among different racial and ethnic groups, differentiation and quantification of the mediation of multiple risk factors on racial and ethnic disparities would be warranted. Understanding factors that may mediate the associations of race and ethnicity with oral health outcomes would guide intervention strategies for specific population subgroups. Consequently, we sought to identify racial and ethnic age groups experiencing oral health disparities and determine whether socioeconomic, quality of dental care, and community-level factors mediate the associations of race and ethnicity with disparities in the risk of developing tooth decay among US children."

Recurrences of tooth decay were captured using the longitudinal data for each individual. Individual-level variables included patients\u2019 demographic characteristics (age at visit, sex, race and ethnicity, insurance type), comorbid medical conditions, smoking status, and dental procedures performed within the past 12 months (binary indicators for cleaning, topical fluoride application, sealant, restorative, and extraction) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Patient race and ethnicity were self-reported by the patients or guardians and classified as Black, Hispanic, White, and other (including American Indian, Asian, and Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). Insurance status was obtained at each visit and categorized as commercially insured or public (Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program [CHIP]). For dental procedures, preventive (cleaning, sealant, topical fluoride application) and treatment following tooth decay (restorative and extraction) procedures were included. Among preventive procedures, topical fluoride was recommended for those with moderate or high caries risk assessment records at each visit according to the guideline.19 Because access to dental care and oral health outcomes vary by socioeconomic factors that can be captured at the community level, Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)\u2013level factors were considered in the analysis.20 ZCTAs are generalized area representations of United States Postal Service zip code service areas.20 Community dwelling was determined by the patient zip code reported in the system. ZCTA-level variables were constructed using the American Community Survey data from US Census Bureau and Area Deprivation Index (ADI) database: proportions of all ages that are White, children in each household, unemployed adults, population in poverty, population with less than a high school diploma, not speaking English well, and ADI ranking (0 to 100 percentiles, with 100 indicating the most disadvantaged group).21,22 Associations of variables with race and ethnicity were tested with \u03c72 test for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables."

Elastic net is a machine learning approach designed to select models in the context of collinearity, which often leads to unstable estimates from traditional stepwise selection approaches.26,27 From this approach, we included all individual-level variables that may explain racial and ethnic disparities in the risk of tooth decay (model B). Zip code\u2013level variables were then included into the model with individual-level variables (model C). We used the Greenwood-D\u2019Agostino-Nam test to assess calibration.28\nAs dental care needs and effectiveness may vary with the child\u2019s age,29 we performed our analyses separately for the following age groups: 0 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 18 years at initial visits. Observations were censored 5 years from the date of the initial assessment visit. All individual variables were allowed to vary over the follow-up period except for sex and race and ethnicity.

We declared a variable a mediator if the variable was significantly associated with the race and ethnicity (exposure) and with diagnosis of tooth decay (outcome), given that all other related factors were included in the model (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1). Formal mediation analysis was implemented using the mma package in R statistical software version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing) for first tooth decay events, incorporating time-varying covariates.34 Mediations were modeled using multiple additive regression trees (nonparametric approach). Relative effects of mediators were calculated as the percentage of the total effect associated with corresponding indirect or direct effects from mediation analyses. Positive indirect effects would indicate that race and ethnicity is positively associated with tooth decay through its associations with mediators, and vice versa for negative indirect effects.\nNo adjustments for multiplicity were implemented.

For school-aged children (age 6-10 years), disparities were observed among Black and Hispanic children, and for adolescents aged 11 to 18 years, only Black adolescents experienced a higher risk of tooth decay compared with White adolescents. A mediation analysis further revealed that insurance type, receipt of certain dental procedures, and community-level socioeconomic factors, including education attainment and ADI, explained most of the observed racial and ethnic disparities in tooth decay risk.\nWhile Medicaid and the CHIP meets its equal access requirement for dental care for children, our study found that insurance type mediated the largest percentage of racial and ethnic disparities in tooth decay after accounting for the receipt of dental procedures (access to care for both preventive and problem-oriented visits) and community-level socioeconomic factors (education attainment and ADI). This finding is consistent with a 2016 study by Shariff and Edelstein5 that found no differences between use of dental care between publicly and privately insured children but poorer oral health status among publicly insured children. Due to lack of information on other socioeconomic status indicators in our EHR data, insurance type served as a proxy for individual socioeconomic status, as it has in previous studies.35-37 Thus, our findings may suggest that differences in individual socioeconomic status between publicly and privately insured children, such\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(6):e2318425. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18425 (Reprinted) June 15, 2023 8/13\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/13/2024\nas family income and food insecurity, could contribute to poor oral health outcomes. It could also suggest that benefits covered by Medicaid and the CHIP may not provide sufficient care to meet publicly insured children\u2019s needs or to reduce the progression of tooth decay.5 Therefore, the association of insurance status with oral health disparities is multifaceted; equity in the use of dental care between Medicaid or the CHIP and privately insured children may not result in equity in children\u2019s oral health.\nThe evidence-based guideline recommends professional topical fluoride treatments for individuals at elevated risk (ie, moderate or high) of tooth decay based on caries-risk assessment.38 While fluoride has been proven to prevent tooth decay by making the enamel more resistant to the action of acids,39 topical fluoride application was positively associated with the risk of developing tooth decay in our analysis because it was only applied to children at elevated risk of caries according to the guideline.38 Caries risk assessment is part of a comprehensive treatment plan approach and involves estimating children at low, moderate, and high risk of caries based on a child\u2019s age; social, behavioral, and medical risk factors (eg, low health literacy, high sugar consumption, special health care needs); protective factors (ie, tooth brushing frequency, exposure to fluoride); and clinical findings (ie, visible plaque on teeth, presence of enamel defects).19 Thus, receipt of topical fluoride,\nFigure 3.

Through a mediation analysis, we demonstrated that race and ethnicity could be viewed as a social construct in which health disparities were mediated through socioeconomic and geographic differences rather than through biological differences between racial and ethnic groups.40-42 Initiatives to emphasize the clinical significance of socioeconomic and behavior risk factors could help to reduce oral health disparities. Refinements in Medicaid and the CHIP policy or oral health promotion interventions targeted for Medicaid-eligible families may have potential to reduce oral health disparities by race and ethnicity."

We could not account for potential unmeasured factors, such as individual-level socioeconomic, behavioral, and structural risk factors, which may introduce a possibility of missed mediation. Hence, our study may not imply causal mediation effect of race and ethnicity or provide a comprehensive assessment of all the possible mechanisms associated with underlying racial and ethnic disparities in oral health. Along with some sociodemographic factors, patient perception (eg, dental anxiety) also influences the receipt of specific dental procedures, which could not be incorporated in our analysis. Future studies are warranted to directly address other potential mediators. Additionally, because our study sample was a convenience sample of children who were enrolled and received care at large dental accountable care organizations across 3 states, the findings may not be generalizable to beyond these populations. Furthermore, while we incorporated community-level factors in the analysis, we did not account for the intracluster correlations, and we may have overstated the precision of some estimates. Because these community-level variables were obtained from 2014 to 2018 American Community Survey 5-year data to represent community-level characteristics of individuals at their baseline visits (2014-2018), there may be temporal misalignment between the outcome and the community-level characteristics during the follow-up period of these\nTable 2.
