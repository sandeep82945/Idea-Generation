    "abstractText": "The role of precursor characteristics and mixture composition design of alkali-activated materials (AAM) has been intensively researched with different types of alumino-silicate sources. Two illite-based precursors were prepared and investigated\u2014(i) raw illite clay (IC) treated in a laboratory at 700, 750, and 800 \u25e6C and (ii) a red brick waste coming from the brick production plant. The fineness of precursors was determined and compared. The precursors were activated with 6 M and 7 M NaOH alkali solutions. Silica gel addition was considered in the composition of AAM. The XRD results indicate the transformation of both precursor types under alkali activation. The efflorescence salts were analyzed on the samples with silica gel addition. Calcined IC precursor allowed us to obtain AAM with a strength from 11 to 16 MPa with an increasing strength gain during curing. The red brick waste precursor showed a compressive strength from 14 to 28 MPa. A high early strength was obtained with no further strength increase. The hydrosodalite and zeolite crystals were detected in the structure of AAM based on the red brick waste precursor. The results indicate different characteristics of AAM based on similar source precursors, showing the important role of the proper treatment of precursors before alkali activation.",

            "text": "Kaolinite is one of the main alumosilicate sources for alkali-activated material (AAM) development. Under temperature treatments between 600 and 900 \u25e6C, an amorphous structure of aluminum and silicon oxides is formed. The use of natural mineral earth components (particularly metakaolin) is now largely out of the question. Alternative and sustainable precursors have already been researched. The use of by-products as secondary materials such as fly ash and slags to form AAM has been widely researched while other alumosilicate sources are still pursued [1,2]. The main clays used in the preparation of AAM are 1:1 layer lattice alumosilicates, while the limited availability or lack of raw materials is bringing interest into 2:1 clay minerals, e.g., pyrophyllite, illite-smectite clays, etc. [3]. After heat treatment at 700 to 900 \u25e6C, clays rich in kaolinite are more reactive to alkali activation than clays dominated by smectite or illite [4]. These other clay minerals are commonly available around the world and may exhibit certain reactivity after heat activation. [5]. Alkali activation with a potassium and sodium hydroxide of 2:1 layer illite clay (IC) has been studied before, but thermal treatment was performed after raw clay activation with 6 M NaOH alkali activation. Afterward, thermal treatment between 600 and 900 \u25e6C led to the production of ceramic samples with a strength from 6 to 24 MPa [3]. Previous research has tested thermally treated IC between 550 and 950 \u25e6C and it was determined that the highest release of aluminate was reached at 750 \u25e6C [5]. In addition, montmorillonite and illite are both 2:1 clay minerals, however, their alkali activation behavior is very different and montmorillonite-rich soils proved to be more promising [6]. Si/Al ratios from 2.81 to 3.85 may lead to AAM with a strength of 7 to 26 MPa [7]. Since the presence\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3195. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15093195 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3195 2 of 12\nof 2:1 clay minerals brings a high Si/Al ratio (>2), this brings limitations to the use of waterglass addition in the alkaline activator solution [5,8]. There are also reports where alkali solution with sodium silicate addition proved to result in low chemical stability of the AAM [9]. Dietel et al. concluded that the specific surface area of heat-treated IC is even more important than the amount of dissolved Si and Al, and Si/Al ratio in the geopolymerization [10]. Vasic\u0301 et al. lately activated a mixture of calcined IC clay and red brick mixture with 10 M KOH and sodium silicate solution, which resulted in AAM with a strength up to 13.7 MPa [11]. Kaolinitic-illitic raw clay previously was activated with 4 to 14 M NaOH solution which resulted in a conclusion that the increase in curing temperature and NaOH concentration had a synergistic effect [12]. Good results were obtained by illite-smectite-rich clay activated with NaOH solution at 75 \u25e6C, which formed geopolymers with a strength of around 30 MPa [13]. This brings a promising perspective for IC use as an AAM precursor. The waste type precursor from IC would be more beneficial than heat treatment of raw clay at an elevated temperature. Silica gel is a type of waste coming from the fertilizer production industry with limited application. To produce 1 t of AlF3, around 0.5 t of silica gel is obtained [14]. Silica gel is characterized by high amorphous phase content, mainly containing around 70% SiO2 and a smaller amount of Al2O3. High fluoride impurity content is characteristic of silica gel\u2014it can be around 20% of the content forming aluminum fluoride hydrate (AlF3\u00b73.5H2O), thus it partially reduces the content of free Al2O3 needed for the production of AAM. High fluorine content makes the use of silica gel use problematic and pyrolysis is one of the ways to remove AlF3 from the material [15]. The addition of silica gel has been used to prepare geopolymers in the range from 2 to 40%, while only up to 10% was the border where the mechanical performance of AAM was reduced drastically [14,16]. This research investigates the alkali activation efficiency of red brick waste resulting from the brick production process as a precursor for the production of AAM. For the first time, the fineness factor of red brick waste powder was investigated and compared to natural raw IC treated at 700 and 800 \u25e6C in a laboratory."

            "text": "A total of two clay treatment approaches were used to prepare precursors for the production of AAM samples. First, carbonate-free illite clay (IC) from the Liepa deposit in Latvia was prepared by thermal treatment. After the collection of clay samples from a clay deposit, samples were placed in a drying chamber at 105 \u25e6C until a constant mass was obtained. Dry clay was milled by collision milling using a semi-industrial disintegrator which is described in the previous paper [17]. At this stage, the differential thermal analysis / thermogravimetric analysis (DTA/TG) was performed. The raw IC powder was then heattreated at 700, 750, and 800 \u25e6C for 4 h at a maximum temperature at a rate of 5 \u25e6C/min. For milled IC, the laser particle size distribution and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were determined. The other precursor originated from a brick production plant. Red brick waste was collected from the local brick production plant that is placed near the IC quarry (JSC Lode, Latvia). During the production, the bricks there are burned at a temperature between 900 and 950 \u25e6C. Then defective products are crushed and coarsely ground to brick sand at the factory. Red brick waste was ground similar to the raw IC. An additional grinding (3x more grinding energy applied) was done for red brick waste to reduce its particle size. In the AAM composition, silica gel waste from a fertilizer manufacturing factory was included as a high silica additive. Silica gel was not additionally treated and was used with its naturally high moisture content (between 80 and 100 wt.%). The weight of the silica gel in the mixture composition was calculated according to its moisture content. Commercially available sodium hydroxide flakes with 99% purity (Tianye Chemicals Ltd., Xinjiang, China) were used to prepare an alkali activation solution. The chemical composition of raw IC, red brick waste, and silica gel are given in Table 1. Results show that red clay has 14.5% of Al2O3, and 70.3% of SiO2, which also\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3195 3 of 12\ncorresponds to previous investigations and is an indication that an extra silica source from alkali activation solution is not needed [14,18]. A high amount of Fe2O3 is characteristic of ferric aluminosilicate clay deposits, which also gives an orange to red-brown color. Clay from the Lode deposit is characterized by a relatively high K2O content (4.0%) and MgO (1.1%) was also recorded. The red brick waste chemical composition indicates similar composition as for raw clay. According to XRF analysis, silica gel contains a high content of SiO2 (72.2%) and Al2O3 (5.68%). Such values give promising indications for using silica gel as a raw material in the composition of AAM. Minor values of CaO and Fe2O3 were also detected. From the production process at the plant, silica gel contains F impurities at 21%.\nThe particle size distribution of precursors is given in Figure 1. The results indicate that the fineness of freshly ground raw clay gradually decreased after the heat treatment temperature increased from 700 to 800 \u25e6C (IC700 \u25e6C, IC750 \u25e6C, IC800 \u25e6C). Raw IC was associated with d10 of 1.29 \u00b5m, d50 of 5.50 \u00b5m, and d90 of 36.53 \u00b5m. Treating red IC at 800 \u25e6C particle size increased d10 to 1.44 \u00b5m, d50 to 8.26 \u00b5m, and d90 to 108.21 \u00b5m, respectively. Ground red brick waste with similar grinding parameters as for thermally treated raw IC (red brick waste 1x) showed a much coarser particle size distribution. The particle size of such ground red brick waste was d10 of 4.66 \u00b5m, d50 of 52.65 \u00b5m, and d90 of 202.20 \u00b5m. To reduce red brick waste particle size, additional grinding (three times more energy) was applied with the same grinding parameters (red brick waste 3x). An additional grinding of red brick waste reduced its particle size: d10 to 2.07 \u00b5m, d50 to 24.64 \u00b5m, and d90 to 74.19 \u00b5m. The density of raw IC was 2.76 g/cm3, while thermal treatment reduced this value from 2.69 to 2.74 g/cm3. The thermal treatment of raw IC reduced specific surface area. The specific surface area of raw ground IC was 4155 cm2/g, and the thermal treatment reduced this value from 3925 to 3475 cm2/g. A higher temperature was associated with a lower specific surface area (IC800 \u25e6C). For ground red brick waste, the specific surface area was 1448 cm2/g and with additional grinding, it increased to 2515 cm2/g. The specific surface area of silica gel was 716 cm2/g and its particle size distribution was accordingly d10 11.71 \u00b5m, d50 66.39 \u00b5m, and d90 146.12 \u00b5m. According to DTA/TG analysis of IC, the total mass change during the analysis was \u22123.8% (Figure 2). The first mass change peak is associated with free water desorption between 35 and 214 \u25e6C and the mass change there was \u22120.67%. An additional \u22121.97% mass change was detected between 411 and 546 \u25e6C. This is associated with the dehydroxylation of IC which is in a similar interval as previously detected for kaolin clay [5]. The obtained value was significantly lower if compared to the dihydroxylation value for kaolin clay which according to the literature is about 8.5% [19,20]. This could be an indicator that relatively less reactive phases are present in calcined IC. Between 573.4 and 580.9 \u25e6C the mass change was \u22120.14% which is an indication of the allotropic transformation of quartz which also corresponds with the data from the XRD and literature [21].\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3195 4 of 12 Materials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 12\nFigure 1.

            "text": "A geopolymerisation reaction of the precursor was detected as new crystalline peaks were identified after alkali activation of a red brick waste and calcined IC. Minerals such as montmorillonite and muscovite in the composition of AAM samples made with 700 \u25e6C treated IC precursor could indicate that polymerization reaction was not completed and these could be remaining from red clay precursors. This also corresponds to the gradual strength increase during the curing period of specimens made with this precursor. Geopolymerisation secondary reaction products such as hydrosodalite were detected which act\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3195 10 of 12\nas an indication for the partial crystallization of sodium aluminate silicate hydrates (N-AS-H gel) [25,27]. For the mixture composition with a combination of red brick waste and calcined IC at 700 \u25e6C, philipsite crystalline phase was detected which could be a further crystallization product of hydrosodalite. The detected needle-like crystals could be referred to the newly crystallized Na-aluminosilicate phase, which could represent zeolite nanocrystals [11]. New zeolite minerals such as herschelite and X\u2014faujasite were detected for AAM based on red brick waste precursors (Br3x). For AAM with silica gel addition, the higher amount of reactive silica initiated the formation of zeolites as fluoride from silica gel may react as a mineralizator. NaF was detected as white efflorescence powder is evidence of an exchange reaction between Al3F and NaOH from an alkali activation solution. Villiaumite and gibbsite (Al (OH)3) can be formed. Similar peaks were observed for AAM with 5% silica gel addition, but the peak intensity was lower as the AAM matrix overwhelmed the quantity of salt in the sample. Such formation of different types of zeolites must be studied in detail to investigate the possibility of forming stable crystalline zeolites with various applications. SEM results indicated, that the degree of reaction for AAM based on red brick waste precursor is much denser leading to a higher degree of geopolymerisation contributing to a higher compressive strength [28]. EDS results indicate that there is a similar compound content for all mixtures as the same raw IC was used for the preparation of precursors only with different temperature treatment conditions. Compared to metakaolin-based geopolymers which possess O from 41\u201343%, aluminium from 11.6 to 16.5 wt.%, silicon from 24.5 to 26 wt.% and sodium from 5.2 to 7.4 wt.%, the oxygen and sodium content has increased while the aluminium and silicon content is lower [28]. This is also allocated from the chemical composition of the precursor and activator solution. The compressive strength results indicate that the red brick waste precursor shows a higher initial strength increase compared to the calcined IC precursor. This could be associated with higher temperature treatment and the increase of reactive phase in clay. Despite the coarser particle size distribution for red brick waste and following lower specific surface area (which could reduce the rate of geopolymerisation during alkali activation), the AAS-solid ratio was lower meaning that a denser structure of AAM was achieved which resulted in higher early compressive strength. Similar tendencies were observed for both red brick waste precursor types ground with different powder fineness or particle sizes milling regimes. A combination of calcined IC precursor and red brick waste precursor leads to a compressive strength decrease. Red brick waste activated with higher molarity NaOH solution showed in general a higher compressive strength and is a favorable option in alkali activation solution selection. Silica gel addition slightly reduced the strength of AAM which corresponds to previously published data [14,16]. Obtained strength results fit well in the traditional AAM strength range giving a reasonable option to replace traditional cementitious binders."

            "text": "Heat-treated illite clay (IC) at 700 to 800 \u25e6C was used as a precursor for obtaining AAM which corresponds to DTA/TG results, indicating the dehydroxylation of IC at a range from 411 to 546 \u25e6C. A comparison to red brick waste precursor from a brick production factory was conducted. The precursor fineness was determined based on grinding parameters, and it was concluded that the grinding of soft raw clay followed by heat treatment provides a finer particle size than the grinding of red brick waste particles (3925 cm2/g to 1448 cm2/g). Additional grinding of red brick waste allowed us to increase the fineness to 2515 cm2/g. A high early strength was obtained with no strength gain during further curing for AAM based on ground red brick waste. Both the 6 M and 7 M NaOH solutions proved to be suitable to produce AAM with strength from 11 to 28 MPa. The coarser particle nature of clay treated at higher temperatures led to lower strength at 35 d from 11 to 16 MPa. The highest strength results were obtained for AAM based on red brick waste. Additionally ground red brick waste with 7 M NaOH alkali activation solution led to 28 MPa strength.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3195 11 of 12\nAn important difference was detected between thermally treated IC and red brick waste precursors\u2014strength gain was more rapid for red brick waste precursor AAM while thermally treated red clay had a lower initial strength and it gradually increased. The addition of silica gel led to a compressive strength decrease and efflorescence was detected with a salt consisting of NaF compounds. The hydrosodalite and zeolite crystals were detected in the structure of AAM based on the red brick waste precursor. Results indicate the difference in characteristics of AAM based on similar source IC precursors, showing the important role of the proper treatment of a precursor before alkali activation. Red brick waste from the brick production process proved to be highly suitable for the production of AAM.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.B. and D.V.; methodology, G.B. and D.V.; validation, D.V.; formal analysis, G.B.; investigation, G.B.; resources, G.B. and D.V.; data curation, D.V.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, G.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.B. and D.V.; visualization, G.B.; supervision, D.V.; project administration, G.B. and D.V.; funding acquisition, G.B. and D.V.
