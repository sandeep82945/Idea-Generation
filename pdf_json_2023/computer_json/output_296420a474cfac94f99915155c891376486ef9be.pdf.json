INTRODUCTION\nWith advances in satellite technology and the growth of data demand, integrated satelliteterrestrial networks (ISTN) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential to provide reliable and ubiquitous coverage over large geographic areas. Satellites can expand broadband coverage into rural or far remote areas where terrestrial networks have limited coverage, thereby complementing terrestrial networks [1]. In the ISTN, a multibeam satellite widely serves satellite users (SUs) with a multicast transmission, while a terrestrial base station (BS) serves cellular users (CUs) with a unicast transmission. Across the multiple spot beams and cells, higher throughput can be achieved through full frequency reuse [2]. With the aggressive frequency reuse, however, severe interference can be induced in and between satellite networks and cellular networks. Moreover, it is difficult to acquire accurate channel feedback at the gateway (GW) in a coherence time, particularly due to the fast-moving of satellite and high end-to-end propagation delay, following channel state information (CSI) uncertainty.\nRate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has recently emerged as a promising transmission scheme to manage interference [3], [4] and to improve robustness to imperfect CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) in multi-antenna multi-user networks [5]-[7]. For the RSMA transmission, at the transmitter, the message for each user is split into common and private parts. All common parts are combined and encoded into a common stream, while private parts are individually encoded into private streams. The users decode and remove the common stream through successive interference cancellation (SIC). After the SIC, each user decodes the intended private stream while treating the other users\u2019 signals as noise. As such, RSMA can generalize spacedivision multiple access (SDMA) where interference is fully treated as noise, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) where interference is fully decoded. Based on this flexibility, RSMA has been utilized in inter-beam interference managements for multibeam satellite communications, resulting in more robust to CSIT inaccuracies [8]-[10].\nThe superiority of RSMA for managing interference in ISTN has been investigated in [11] by proposing a joint beamforming design to achieve the max-min fairness (MMF). The MMF rate is an important metric in the ISTN in terms of ubiquitous coverage, while sum-rate maximization\n3 can be achieved by allocating all the power to only a few users with the best channel conditions. In cooperative ISTN, the transmit data is fully shared across the satellite and BS at the GW; however, this can incur significant signaling overhead. On the other hand, in coordinated ISTN, the satellite and BS do not share their data, thereby not requiring tight synchronization at the data level across the satellite and BS. In RSMA-based coordinated ISTN [11], inter-beam interference and intra-cell interference are partially decoded; however, it only considers the rate-splitting (RS) in each intra-network within the satellite network and cellular network separately, while internetwork interference is fully treated as noise. Besides, it only deals with a geostationary (GEO) satellite scenario with an altitude of 36,000 km above the surface of the Earth, which suffers from a low level of inter-network interference; however, it inherently has the disadvantage of high launch costs, poor link budget, and long propagation delay. Along with [11], the existing studies on multi-cell RSMA transmission mainly resort to i) treating inter-cell interference as noise [11]-[13], or ii) inter-cell RS with data sharing between cells [14]-[16]. Different from the previous studies, to manage both intra- and inter-network interference without data sharing, our framework is motivated by the Han-Kobayashi scheme [17], which is the quasi-optimal transmission strategy for two-user Gaussian interference channel. In the Han-Kobayashi scheme, power allocation to common/private messages is flexibly determined according to relative channel gains between the desired and interference links. Inspired by this, we propose a coordinated RSMA framework by applying inter-network RS with a super-common message on top of intranetwork RS with common/private messages. With the unified RS design for inter- and intranetworks, we jointly optimize the precoding and power allocation of the private/common/supercommon messages to achieve the MMF among all users. By doing so, the transmit power of the super-common message can be adjusted according to the interference levels of the satellite towards CUs, thereby mitigating inter-network interference. Thus, it can also be effectively applied in emerging ISTN scenarios using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with an altitude of less than 2,000 km, since its higher level of inter-network interference can be subtracted thanks to the use of super-common message. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing studies that attempt to manage both inter- and intra-network interference for coordinated ISTN without data sharing among networks in the context of RSMA. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We employ a super-common message that can be initially decoded and deducted from all\n4 users through SIC. Through this novel RSMA framework, the interference between the satellite network and cellular network can be flexibly decoded and treated as noise. \u2022 With limited knowledge of satellite channels, we formulate an optimization framework to\nachieve the MMF among all users, using a concept of generalized mutual information (GMI). We approximate it into a more tractable one via successive convex approximation (SCA). \u2022 We numerically demonstrate the superiority and CSI-error robustness of our proposed\nframework, compared to conventional RSMA, SDMA, and OMA counterparts. Through this, the proposed scheme is shown to have the potential to provide substantial gain, especially when a satellite is operated in LEO and the power budget of a terrestrial BS is high enough."

Assuming that the SUs are located out of the BS\u2019s service area, the channel between the BS and all SUs is negligible. The power budget at the satellite and the BS are respectively \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 . The GW is a central controller for resource allocation, interference management, collecting data information, and feeding both satellite and BS."

Other constraints (20) - (23) also\ncan be approximated into convex and SoC constraints as described in [11], then the problem P3 can be reformulated into convex and computational efficient problem formulation.2\nRemark 1 (Difference with hierarchical rate splitting [19] ): In hierarchical rate splitting (HRS), there are private messages intended for each user and two kinds of common messages, namely an outer-tier common message and an inner-tier common message, that can be decoded by all users and by a subset of users, respectively. Our proposed framework is similar to the HRS scheme in the sense that the two-layer SIC is needed to decode the different levels of the common messages. Nevertheless, the proposed framework fundamentally differs from HRS because the transmitted data information for all users is shared at the transmitter in the HRS (particularly suited to multi-antenna broadcast channels), while it is not exchanged between the satellite and terrestrial BS in our system model. In addition, as we consider the multibeam multicast transmission scenario in the satellite network, the intra-beam interference does not exist in our scenario, while it is considered in the HRS and managed by the inner-tier common message. For these reasons, the existing HRS is not directly applicable to our scenario."

The label \u201cRSMA-OMA\u201d and \u201cSDMA-OMA\u201d refer to schemes in which RSMA and SDMA are used with OMA scheme,\n2As the algorithm is iterated until stopping criterion |\ud835\udc5e [\ud835\udc5b] \u2212 \ud835\udc5e [\ud835\udc5b\u22121] | < 10\u22124, the objective function value \ud835\udc5e monotonically increases and it is bounded above by the power budgets. Although the solution of our SCA-based algorithm is sub-optimal, it\nconverges to the set of stationary points of problem P1 [20]. The studies for globally optimal beamforming for RSMA-based ISTN and the comparison of the results with sub-optimal solutions in this paper are left for future work.\n12\nrespectively. \u201c4 Color-OMA\u201d refers to an OMA scheme where the frequency band for each beam is reused with four orthogonal bands.\nAt first, we evaluate the MMF performance of our proposed framework versus the altitude of the satellite \u210esat with perfect CSI assumption at the GW, i.e. \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc52 = 0. The power budget at the BS \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 is fixed at 30 dBm. In Fig. 2, as the altitude gets higher, the MMF rates of all schemes decrease with the degradation of satellite channel strength. With partially decoding intranetwork (within satellite network and cellular network) interference and partially treating it as noise, all of the RSMA schemes outperform SDMA schemes in all cases of frequency band usage (ISTN and OMA); moreover, the sRSMA-ISTN has a further improved MMF performance by flexible management of inter-network interference with the super-common message. In general, the performance gap between sRSMA-ISTN and RSMA-ISTN is enhanced by decreasing \u210esat; it becomes substantial particularly in the LEO region due to the high level of inter-network interference. Especially when the satellite is at the very low Earth orbit (VLEO) with an altitude of \u210esat = 300 km, the MMF rate of sRSMA-ISTN is increased by 14.2 % than that of RSMA-ISTN. The high level of inter-network interference in the LEO region can be mitigated by assigning lots of power to the super-common message, while it is fully treated as noise in\n13\nRSMA-ISTN.3 On the other hand, as the level of inter-network interference becomes low by increasing the \u210esat, the power allocated to the super-common message is reduced to almost zero when the \u210esat gets higher than 10,000 km. This makes the inter-network interference be fully treated as noise, causing the sRSMA-ISTN scheme to have MMF performance similar to the RSMA-ISTN scheme in the region with a higher altitude than 10,000 km. In OMA schemes, the frequency spectrum cannot be used more efficiently than in ISTN schemes with full frequency reuse, resulting in much worse performance. In case of Adapt. RSMA-OMA, although the frequency band is optimally divided between satellite/cellular networks with the management of the inter-beam/intra-cell interference, it has a lower performance than the ISTN-based schemes. For the scheme of 4 Color-OMA, since the inter-beam interference is alleviated, it can have a higher performance than SDMA-OMA at LEO region. As the altitude of satellite \u210esat grows, it gets the worst performance among the schemes, since the minimum rate is obtained by the rates of SUs which are provided with much narrower frequency bands than other schemes. Furthermore, in Fig. 3, we evaluate the MMF performance versus terrestrial \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 with a fixed\n3Our proposed scheme achieves a significantly improved MMF rate in the LEO regime at the cost of a bit higher computational\ncomplexity than RSMA-ISTN [11] induced by an additional layer of SIC at the receivers.\n14\naltitude of satellite \u210esat = 500 km, assuming imperfect satellite CSI at the GW. Fig. 3 also shows the superiority of sRSMA-ISTN over other baseline schemes. The MMF rates of overall schemes increase gradually as \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 increases, yet they are saturated in the high \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 region due to the fixed satellite power budget \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60. The intuition behind this is that in the high \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 region, the minimum rate of all users equals the minimum rate of SUs, causing saturated performance due to the fixed satellite power budget \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60. On the other hand, for the case of perfect CSI (i.e. \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc52 = 0) in the scheme of 4 Color-OMA, since the inter-beam interference is relieved, the MMF rate is determined by the minimum rate of CUs, thus it increases proportionally with \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61 . We can also observe performance degradation in all schemes with increasing satellite CSI error levels. Specifically, the performance gaps among RSMA-based schemes with different levels of CSI errors are narrower than other schemes; the performance degradation of sRSMA-ISTN is much smaller than that of RSMA-ISTN in the presence of CSI errors. These decreased performance gaps show that RSMA is more robust to CSI error than SDMA and 4 Color schemes, and our proposed framework has far better robustness through the flexible management of inter-network interference by partially decoding it and partially treating it as noise.\n15"

The presented simulation results have numerically shown the superiority and satellite CSI-error robustness of our proposed framework. Thus, our proposed framework in ISTN is envisioned to fulfill ubiquitous global connectivity for next-generation wireless networks."
