 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the background and findings of this paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study following the same cohort of elderly with chronic diseases over time to examine the long-term impacts of NRPS on health outcomes. The current study only looked at cross-sectional data from 2018. 

2. Examine potential mediators between NRPS receipt and health status, such as reduced financial stress, increased health service utilization, improved nutrition, etc. Understanding the mechanisms behind the relationship can inform policies to maximize benefits.

3. Expand the study to also include elderly with chronic diseases living in urban areas, to compare effects of urban vs rural pension schemes on this vulnerable population's health.

4. Conduct qualitative research through interviews or focus groups to understand elderly recipients' perspectives on how NRPS affects their health and wellbeing. This could provide insights beyond quantitative data.

5. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of increasing NRPS coverage for elderly with COPD, asthma and other chronic conditions, in terms of health outcomes and healthcare costs saved. This could further inform policy decisions around expansion of the program.
