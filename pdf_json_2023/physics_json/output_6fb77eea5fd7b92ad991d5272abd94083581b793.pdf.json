    "abstractText": "Selective dehydrogenative silylation is one of the most valuable tools for synthesizing organosilicon compounds. In this study, a regioand stereoselective ruthenium-catalyzed dehydrogenative intermolecular silylation was firstly developed to access (E)-alkenyl silyl-ether derivatives and silyl-ether heterocycles with good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, two pathways for RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3/NBE-catalyzed dehydrogenative intermolecular silylation of alcohols and alkenes as well as intermolecular silylation of naphthol derivatives were investigated with H2SiEt2 as the hydrosilane reagent.",

            "text": "Alkenylsilanes are one of the most versatile building blocks in numerous polymers, semi-conductors, and medicinal compounds due to their low toxicity and favorable metabolic profiles [1,2]. They can also serve as synthetic intermediates for useful moieties, including allylic alcohols, allylic amines, and alkenyl halides via oxidation with H2O2, aminations, and halogenations [3\u20137]. Compared to the alkenylsilanes, synthetic methodologies with the silyl\u2013Heck reaction [8\u201310], alkyne hydrosilylation [11,12], and dehydrogenative silylation of alkenes, direct dehydrogenative silylation of alkenes has attracted attention as a competitive alternative process because alkenes are less expensive and more readily available [13,14]. The competitive alkene hydrosilylation to generate alkylsilanes is still a challenging step during the dehydrogenative silylation process to produce alkenylsilanes [15\u201317]. Recently, several precious metals, such as rhodium [18\u201320], iridium [21], ruthenium [22], and earthabundant metals, including iron [23], copper [24], and manganese [25,26], were developed for the selective dehydrogenative silylation of alkenes. For example, Zhang reported efficient [RhCl(COD)]2/PPh3-catalyzed dehydrogenative silylation derivatives with trisubstituted hydrosilanes as the hydrosilane reagents [18]. Jeon demonstrated regio- and stereoselective dehydrogenative silylation and hydrosilylation of vinylarenes with alkoxysilanes by using a ruthenium alkylidene catalyst (Scheme 1a) [22]. Very recently, [Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3)] developed by Kirchner [25] and the Mn2(CO)10-iPrPNP catalytic system by Jin Xie [26] were successfully applied in the dehydrogenative silylation of alkenes, with trisubstituted hydrosilanes as the hydrosilane reagents (Scheme 1b).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7186. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28207186 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7186 2 of 13 Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13\nScheme 1.

In the Ru-catalyzed intermolecular silylation cycle of alkene with alcohol, the active Ru(H)(o-C6H4PPh2)(PPh3)(CO) species A was generated in situ after the release of one PPh3 and cyclometallation from the reaction of RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 with NBE [29,33,34]. Then, the oxidative addition of the above-generated ROSi(Et2)H compound led to \u201cRu\u2013Si\u201d intermediate B [36]. Next, following the insertion of the Ru\u2013Si bond to\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7186 7 of 13\nstyrene [18] and \u03b2-elimination of Ru, intermediate C led to Ru intermediate D. Finally, (E)-alkenyl silyl-ether product 4 was produced via the decoordination of Ru intermediate D, and RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 was regenerated with the previous release of PPh3 for the next catalytic cycle. On the other hand, in the Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenative intermolecular silylation cycle of naphthol, the active Ru(H)(o-C6H4PPh2)(PPh3)(CO) species A reacted with the in situ generated \u201cO\u2013Si\u2013H\u201d compound to afford \u201cRu\u2013Si\u201d intermediate E.

The silyl-ether heterocycle 7a was finally obtained by reductive elimination and released RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 for the next catalytic cycle.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 13\nin Scheme 7.

            "text": "In summary, we have described a highly regio- and stereoselective sequential rutheniumcatalyzed dehydrogenative intermolecular silylation to access (E)-alkenyl silyl-ether derivatives with alcohols and alkenes and H2SiEt2 as the hydrosilane reagent. Furthermore, a regioselective intermolecular C-H silylation of naphthol derivatives with H2SiEt2 to synthesize silyl-ether heterocycles was also developed using the RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3/NBE catalytic system. Various (E)-alkenyl silyl-ether derivatives and silyl-ether heterocycles bearing tolerated functional groups were successfully synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. Additionally, two pathways of Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenative intermolecular silylations were proposed.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28207186/s1.
