1. **Development of DNA origami-based plasmonic biosensors for multiplexed detection of biomarkers.** DNA origami structures can be designed to have multiple binding sites for different biomarkers, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in a single sample. This could be useful for diagnosing complex diseases or monitoring the progression of a disease over time.
2. **Exploration of the use of DNAzymes as bioprobes for plasmonic biosensors.** DNAzymes are catalytic DNA molecules that can cleave specific target sequences. This could be used to develop biosensors that are highly specific and sensitive for detecting target molecules.
3. **Investigation of the use of plasmonic biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics.** Plasmonic biosensors are portable and easy to use, making them ideal for point-of-care diagnostics. This could enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of diseases in remote or resource-limited settings.
4. **Development of plasmonic biosensors for real-time monitoring of biological processes.** Plasmonic biosensors can be used to monitor changes in the concentration of specific molecules in real time. This could be used to study the dynamics of biological processes, such as cell signaling or gene expression.
5. **Exploration of the use of plasmonic biosensors for drug discovery and development.** Plasmonic biosensors could be used to screen for new drugs or to monitor the efficacy of drugs in clinical trials. This could help to accelerate the development of new therapies for diseases.
