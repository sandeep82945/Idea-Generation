    "abstractText": "Wormholes require negative energy, and therefore an exotic matter source. Since Casimir\u2019s energy is negative, it has been speculated as a good candidate to source those objects a long time ago. However, only very recently a full solution for 3 + 1 dimensions has been found by Garattini, thus the Casimir energy can be a source of traversable wormholes. We have recently shown that this can be generalized to higher dimensional spacetimes. Lately, Garattini sought to analyze the effects of Yukawa-type terms on shape functions and obtained promising results. However, his approach breaks down the usual relation between the energy density and the radial pressure of the Casimir field. In this work, we study the effects of the same three Yukawa-type corrective factors on the shape function of the Casimir wormhole keeping the usual way to obtain the radial pressure from the energy density. We show that, in addition to being able to construct traversable wormholes that satisfy all the necessary conditions, it is possible to obtain adequate constraints on the constants to recover the standard case with no double limit used by Garatinni. We show that, for some values of the Yukawa parameter, it is possible to generate a repulsive gravitational wormhole. Finally, we analyze the stability of the solutions and find the upper bounds for the Yukawa factor.",

            "text": "Wormholes (WH), like black holes, are predicted solutions to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) by imposing static and spherically symmetric symmetry on spacetime metrics. The existence of black holes was investigated in numerous manuscripts after Schwarschild obtained the first solution in 1916 [1], culminating in the most recent successes in photographing such astrophysical objects [2,3]. Meanwhile, the existence of WH remains unresolved [4]. These solutions require sources of matter that violate GR\u2019s standard energy conditions. This type of matter is called exotic matter and its fundamental property is that it is connected to sources of negative energy. [5]. Such solutions, in different gravitational scenarios, have aroused recent interest and stood out as a promising area of research [6,7]. Although in the usual context of General Relativity it is not possible to obtain this type of matter, quantum fields in very specific situations can present states of negative energy. In 1948, Casimir discovered that, when we place two metallic plane plates, parallel, closely spaced, and uncharged in a vacuum, an attractive force between them appears [4,8]. The Casimir effect occurs due to the zero-point energy of the quantum electromagnetic field distorted by the boundary conditions on the plates. This effect is closely related to the geometry of the boundaries and, as proved by Boyer in 1968, for a conducting spherical shell, the Casimir effect produces a positive force [9]. Experimental evidence of the Casimir effect is also known and was shown in Archimedes\u2019 vacuum weight experiment [10]. The interesting feature of this effect is that an attractive force appears which is generated by negative energy. As such, it has been speculated as a good candidate to source those objects from a long time ago. However, only very recently has Garattini, in his\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 383. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15020383 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nmanuscript [11], shown that Casimir energy can be used solely to build Morris\u2013Thorne WH in 3 + 1 dimensions and explored the consequences of Quantum Weak Energy Condition (QWEC) in the traversability of the WH. Recently, it was shown that Casimir energy can be used to construct traversable WH for higher dimensional spacetimes [12]. Garattini, still in 2019, proposed another method to obtain a traversable WH using a Yukawa-type shape function [13]. Motivated by that work, in 2021, he proposed a series of modifications to the Casimir WH with the Yukawa factor, e\u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0) [14]. The author directly modifies the Casimir shape function in three ways: globally, only in the constant term, and only in the variable. In each case, he deduces the corresponding energy density via Einstein field equations (EFEs). On the other hand, he imposes the zero tidal condition (ZTC), i.e., a constant redshift factor, to obtain the corresponding radial pressure via EFEs. As he uses two different approaches to obtain the energy density and the radial pressure, he loses the Casimir characteristic, i.e., the relation between these two quantities. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to generate Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH preserving the existing profile between Casimir pressure and energy, as well as looking for a complete solution without the requirement of the ZTC. This methodology allows, in our view, a more consistent generalization. This article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we provide a brief overview of the Casimir WH, starting from the field equations and ending with the shape and redshift functions. In Section 3, we generalize these objects by introducing Yukawa-type factors into the shape function in the same three ways made by Garatinni, but without forcing the ZTC. Additionally, we examine the stability conditions associated with the square of the speed of sound for each of the three correction models. Furthermore, we investigate the corrective effects of the first and second-order Yukawa parameter to understand the boundary between the modified and standard solutions. Finally, we conclude our results in the last section."

            "text": "The WHs are interesting static and spherically symmetric solutions of EFEs because they represent topological structures with a throat connecting two asymptotically flat regions of spacetime. To obtain a traversable WH, Morris and Thorne, in 1988 [15], write the geometry of the spacetime by the line element (considering c = 1)\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03a6(r)dt2 + dr 2\n1\u2212 b(r)r + r2d\u21262, (1)\nwhere d\u21262 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62, b(r), and \u03a6(r) are the shape and redshift functions, respectively, both functions of the coordinate r \u2208 [r0, \u221e), where r0 = min[b(r)] is the WH throat value. In order to guarantee the WH traversability, Morris and Thorne imposes that the redshift function, \u03a6(r), must be regular everywhere for r \u2208 [r0, \u221e) and asymptotically flat, and the shape function, b(r), must obey the following four properties, namely:\n(i) the non-singularity condition, b(r)/r < 1 for r > r0; (ii) the existence of the throat, b(r) = r0 at r = r0; (iii) the asymptotic flat limit, b(r)/r \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e; (iv) the flare-out condition, b\u2032(r)r\u2212 b(r) < 0.\nIn the tetrad base described by the line element (1), Einstein\u2019s Field Equation splits into the following set of equations:\n\u03ba\u03c1(r) = b\u2032(r)\nr2 , (2a)\n\u03bapr(r) = 2 r\n( 1\u2212 b(r)\nr\n) \u03a6\u2032(r)\u2212 b(r)\nr3 , (2b) \u03bapt(r) = (\n1\u2212 b(r) r\n)[ \u03a6\u2032\u2032(r) + \u03a6\u2032(r) ( \u03a6\u2032(r) +\n1 r\n)] \u2212 b\n\u2032(r)r\u2212 b(r) 2r2\n( \u03a6\u2032(r) +\n1 r\n) , (2c)\nwhere \u03ba = 8\u03c0G, \u03c1(r) is the energy density, pr(r) is the radial pressure, and pt(r) is the lateral pressure. The set of Equations (2a)\u2013(2c) is over-determined, i.e., the lateral pressure could be determined by the energy density and the radial pressure. Despite the fact that the Equation (2c) can be used in this way, it is easier to use the conservation of the stress\u2013energy tensor equation\np\u2032r(r) = 2 r [pt(r)\u2212 pr(r)]\u2212 [\u03c1(r) + pr(r)]\u03a6\u2032(r). (3)\nIf we calculate pr(r) + \u03c1(r) using Equations (2a) and (2b), we notice that the result, near the throat, is negatively defined by the flare-out condition [16]. This result shows us that, at last in the throat, an exotic type of matter, \u03c1(r) < 0, is necessary to build a traversable WH. In this sense, Garattini showed in a recent manuscript [11] that promoting Casimir energy and pressure to functions of r-coordinate\n\u03c1(r) = \u2212 h\u0304c\u03c0 2\n720r4 , (4)\npr(r) = \u03c9\u03c1(r) = 3\u03c1(r), (5)\nis able to obtain a Morris\u2013Thorne type traversable WH solution. Thus, using Casimir energy (4) and the Equation of State (EoS) (5), Garattini obtained that\nb(r) = r0 \u2212 r21 r0 + r21 r , (6a)\n\u03a6(r) = \u22121 2\n[ (\u03c9r20 \u2212 r21)\nln(r0r + r21) r20 + r 2 1\n] + (1\u2212\u03c9) ln(r) + (\u03c9r21 \u2212 r20)\n\u03c9r21 ln(r\u2212 r0) r20 + r 2 1 , (6b)\nwhere r21 is the constant related to the Casimir energy, specifically \u03ba\u03c1 = r 2 1/r 4, with r21 = \u03c03l2P\n90 . In order to ensure that the redshift function is finite everywhere, the solution (6b) imposes the following constraint r21 = r20 \u03c9 = r20 3 . This allows us to write the shape and the redshift functions as\nb(r) = 2r0 3 + r20 3r , (7a)\n\u03a6(r) = ln (\n3r 3r + r0\n) . (7b)\nThe above results satisfy the four conditions for the shape function listed before, and the non-divergence of the redshift function. Finally, it is important to note that, given the shape function, it is possible to visualize the WH through an embedding procedure, given by the following integral [15]:\nz(r) = \u00b1 \u222b r\nr0\ndr\u2032\u221a r\u2032\nb(r\u2032) \u2212 1 . (8)\nThe above curve, when rotated, generates the standard embedding diagram showing the throat connecting the disjoint regions."

            "text": "Garattini, in another recent manuscript [14], seeks to propose a way to study the effect of Yukawa-type terms on the shape function of Casimir WH. Physically, this modification is related to the existence of massive modes with negative energy. The proposed Casimir WH extension is such that the shape function (7a) is multiplied by\nf (r) = e\u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0), (9)\nwith \u00b5 having an inverse dimension of length, in three contexts: (i) a global modification: b(r) = (\n2r0 3 + r20 3r\n) e\u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0);\n(ii) a modification only in the constant term: b(r) = 2r03 e \u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0) + r20 3r ; (iii) a modification only in the variable term: b(r) = 2r03 + r20 3r e \u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0). Equation (2a) obtains the energy density responsible for generating the WH and, imposing the ZTC, obtains the radial pressure in terms of a non-homogeneous EoS, pr(r) = \u03c9(r)\u03c1(r). The approach taken by Garattini lacks, a priori, questionable assumptions. Initially, we have that the adopted shape function not only depends on a homogeneous EoS of the radial pressure but also on the relation \u03c9r21 = r 2 0 obtained to circumvent the existence of horizons in the redshift function at r = r0. Furthermore, \u03c9 = 3 which is the characteristic solution of the Casimir field must be modified by a non-homogeneous EoS, as pointed out by the author. The Casimir pressure is related to its energy by P = \u2212\u2202E/\u2202L, where L is the separation distance between the plates. Thus, a consistent way to maintain the Casimir energy profile is from the following derivative relation [17]\npr(r) = \u2212 d dr [r\u03c1(r)]. (10)\nFurthermore, by taking \u00b5 = 0, the Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH must, by construction, return to the Casimir WH for every point in spacetime, with r \u2208 [r0, \u221e), and not only at the throat, as obtained by Garattini. Finally, a WH that generalizes Casimir\u2019s should not lead to a ZTF condition. Based on this, we aim to propose a new way of generating Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH, starting from the shape function (6a), proposing the same corrections and obtaining the energy, radial pressure, tangential pressure, redshift function and the true relationship between r1 and r0 for each case. The three ways to modify the shape function listed above are the subject of the following subsections."

            "heading": "3.1. The Global Correction",
            "text": "The first case that we will study is a global modification in the shape function, i.e., to multiply the solution (6a) by the factor (9) to obtain\nb(r) = ( r0 \u2212\nr21 r0 + r21 r\n) e\u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0). (11)\nAs the multiplicative factor is global in the shape function, the modified shape function directly satisfies properties (i), (ii), and (iii) defined in Section 2. To satisfy the flare-out condition, i.e., b\u2032(r)r\u2212 b < 0, it is necessary that\n\u2212 (r20 \u2212 r21)r + 2r21r0\nr < \u00b5\n[ (r20 \u2212 r21)r + r21r0 ] , (12)\nwhich is satisfied everywhere if r1 < r0 and \u00b5 \u2265 0. Thus, from the first EFE, Equation (2a), we obtain the energy density compatible with the shape function\n\u03c1(r) = \u2212 e \u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0)\n\u03bar4\n[ r21 +\n\u00b5r r0\n( r20r\u2212 r21(r\u2212 r0) )] , (13)\nevidently, the case where \u00b5 = 0 returns the Casimir energy density, Equation (4), without any extra assumptions. On the other hand, in the throat, r = r0, we obtain a modification,\n\u03c1(r0) = \u2212 1\n\u03bar20\n[ \u00b5r0 +\nr21 r20\n] , (14)\nwhich is already expected, after all the energy was obtained through the derivation of the shape function. Since \u03c1(r) has changed, it is expected that the EoS defining the radial pressure will also change. In order to preserve the similarity character with the Casimir energy, whose radial pressure is given by Equation (10), then the relationship between \u03c1 and pr becomes inhomogeneous, pr(r) = \u03c9(r)\u03c1(r), with\n\u03c9(r) = [ (r20 \u2212 r21)r3 + r0r21r2 ] \u00b52 + [ (r20 \u2212 r21)r2 + 3r0r21r ] \u00b5 + 3r21r0[\n(r20 \u2212 r21)r2 + r0r21r ] \u00b5 + r21r0\n, (15)\nwhich has the following properties:\n\u03c9(r0) = r40\u00b5 2 + (r30 + 2r 2 1r0)\u00b5 + 3r 2 1\n\u00b5r30 + r 2 1\n, (16)\nlim r\u2192\u221e \u03c9(r) \u2192 \u221e, for \u00b5 6= 0, (17) lim \u00b5\u21920 \u03c9(r) = 3, (18)\nreturning the usual case. Although the threshold r \u2192 \u221e causes \u03c9 to diverge, radial pressure has a general protection factor guaranteeing the finitude of pressure. Contrary to Garattini\u2019s proposal, it is not necessary to impose a double limit, limr\u2192r0 lim\u00b5\u21920 \u03c9(r), to return to the standard case. This single condition, \u00b5 = 0, should already map the Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH to the Casimir ones. In order to avoid the divergence of the redshift function in the throat, we can apply the second EFE, Equation (2b), at r = r0. Assuming that \u03a6\u2032(r0) < \u221e, we obtain that\nkpr(r0) = \u2212 b(r0) r30 = \u2212 1 r20 , (19)\nwhere, by the use of Equations (16) and (14), we obtain the relation between r1 and r0,\nr21 =\n[ 1\u2212 \u00b52r20 \u2212 \u00b5r0\n3 + 2\u00b5r0\n] r20. (20)\nThe above equation removes the divergence of the redshift function in the throat, agreeing with the condition r1 < r0 and, for \u00b5 = 0, recovering the standard result r20 = 3r 2 1. Thus, it is possible to rewrite the energy density (13) and the state function (15), as\n\u03c1\u0304(u) = \u2212 e\u2212\u00b5\u0304(u\u22121)\n[( u2 \u2212 u ) \u00b5\u03043 + ( 3u2 \u2212 u\u2212 1 ) \u00b5\u03042 + ( 2u2 + u\u2212 1 ) \u00b5\u0304 + 1 ] (2\u00b5\u0304 + 3)u4 , (21)\n\u03c9(r) = (u3 \u2212 u2)\u00b5\u03044 + (3u3 \u2212 3u)\u00b5\u03043 + (2u3 + 4u2 \u2212 3u\u2212 3)\u00b5\u03042 + (2u2 + 3u\u2212 3)\u00b5\u0304 + 3\n(u2 \u2212 u)\u00b5\u03043 + (3u2 \u2212 u\u2212 1)\u00b5\u03042 + (2u2 + u\u2212 1)\u00b5\u0304 + 1 , (22)\nwhere we defined the dimensionless energy density, \u03c1\u0304(u) = \u03bar20\u03c1(u), radial coordinate, u = r/r0, and mass parameter, \u00b5\u0304 = \u00b5r0. Furthermore, to obtain the tangential pressure, we use conservation of energy (3) to obtain pt(r) and make \u2126(r) = pt(r)/\u03c1(r), satisfying a different non-homogeneous EoS. Due to the size of the equation, we will not display it, just some graphs indicating its behavior. Figure 1a shows the flare-out condition for some values of dimensionless parameter \u00b5\u0304, and illustrates the fact that it is satisfied for every \u00b5\u0304 > 0. In Figure 1b,c, we plot the dimensionless energy density (21) and the radial pressure, respectively, for some values of \u00b5\u0304. It shows that the global modification decreases the energy and the radial pressure when \u00b5\u0304 increases, due to the existence of massive modes with negative energy. We plot the tangential pressure in Figure 1d for some values of \u00b5\u0304, and we can note that the behavior for \u00b5\u0304 = 1.0 is very different from the other cases since it exhibits a maximum value near the throat. The analytical result of the tangential pressure on the throat shows that this behavior changes around \u00b5\u0304 = 0.72. Finally, it is possible to\nobtain the redshift from Equation (2b) and the embedding diagram by Equation (8), both numerically, which are represented in Figure 2a and Figure 2b, respectively.\nAn intriguing feature is that, since \u03a6\u2032 is not monotone, i.e., does not have a welldefined sign given the values of \u00b5, it is observed the existence of a maximum value in the tangential pressure, see Figure 1d. Thus, if \u03a6\u00b5(r) characterizes the redshift for a given value of the Yukawa parameter, and \u00b5c characterizes it as a value that exhibits a critical point at pt(r), then \u03a6\u00b5c(r) = 0 for all r \u2265 r0, making the Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH obey ZTC as long as b\u00b5c(r) satisfies the flare-out condition. In addition, for 0 \u2264 \u00b5 < \u00b5c, the WH exerts an attractive gravity, but for \u00b5 > \u00b5c, the redshift turns into a blueshift deviation making the Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH slightly repulsive. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 2a. In this case, we have the value \u00b5c \u2248 0.276."

In the original case, i.e., without the Yukawa-type correction, the constant term in the shape function did not have much relevance, since most of the physical interest quantities are obtained via the derivation of b(r). In this correction, however, this term should be relevant. Naturally, b(r0) = r0 and\nb\u2032(r0) = \u2212 [r21 + \u00b5r0(r 2 0 \u2212 r21)]\nr20 < 1, (24)\nprovided r20 > r 2 1, checkable later.

On the other hand, this equation, by providing the contribution of a previously negligible term, imposes a restriction on the Yukawa constant. This limit is visualized in Figure 3a, where the value \u00b5 = 1.0 (comparable to r0) violates the flare-out condition. In this sense, the flare-out condition is violated in regime 0.618 < \u00b5 < 1.43.\nFrom the second EFE, we obtain the relation between r1, r0 and \u00b5,\nr21 = [ \u00b52r20 + \u00b5r0 \u2212 1 \u00b52r20 + \u00b5r0 \u2212 3 ] r20; (28)\nfor \u00b5 = 0, we have r20 = 3r 2 1.

These conditions can result in restrictions on the possible values for the \u00b5 parameter. One way to do this is by calculating the square of the speed of sound, given by [18]\nv2s (r) = dpr(r) d\u03c1(r) = p\u2032r(r) \u03c1\u2032(r) .

On the other hand, the global case gains its first constraint, while the radial case has imposed its second constraint, the first being given by the flare-out condition.

The value \u00b5 = 0 should model the WH for the usual Casimir case, thus small values of \u00b5 are on the borderline of what is already known in the literature. Furthermore, as we saw in the previous subsection, the Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH is stable for small values of the Yukawa parameter. Therefore, the local exponential terms in \u03a6\u2032 can be expressed via Taylor series\ne\u2212\u00b5(r\u2212r0) = 1\u2212 \u00b5(r\u2212 r0) + 1 2 \u00b52(r\u2212 r0)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, (40)\nso a first-order correction would be to take all terms of the type \u00b5j with j \u2264 1, second-order with j \u2264 2, and so on.\n3.5.1.

(42b)\nNote that, in the radial case, the solution is basically the redshift of the Casimir WH, but with a subtle change in the numerator of the logarithm argument compared to Equation (7b). This difference is due to the setting of \u03a6(r0), where additive constants have no physical implication. On the other hand, the global and constant cases behave the same way for first-order changes.\n3.5.2. Second Order Correction\nIn first-order corrections, we observe that the redshift for the global and constant cases are the same. Furthermore, the redshift for the radial case is independent of the Yukawa parameter \u00b5. In this way, it is suggestive to consider corrections in the second order.

            "text": "In this work, we propose a more consistent way to generalize Casimir WH with Yukawa-type terms in shape functions in the three approaches initially proposed by Garattini [14]. Casimir WH does not have constant redshift, so there is no reason to build Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH considering the ZTC. In our approach, we maintained the character of pressure being given by the derivative of energy, which uncovered a completely new physics for these astrophysical objects. In possession of the results obtained, the Yukawa\u2013 Casimir WH, in all considered cases, satisfies the so-called QWEC [11]\n\u03c1(r) + pr(r) = \u2212g(r); g(r) > 0 \u2200 r \u2208 [r0, \u221e), (45)\nas visualized in Figure 9. In the correction in the variable term, due to the subtle discrepancies between the curves, a logarithmic scale was considered in the independent variable r/r0.\nFurthermore, only in the correction of the constant term do restrictions appear on the value of the Yukawa constant since 0.618 < \u00b5 < 1.43 violates the flare-out condition. This type of restriction is only seen in this approach. Another characteristic of this methodology was a natural achievement, in the global and constant cases, of being possible not only to construct WH without tidal force but also to obtain cases in which the generated force is repulsive, characterizing a blueshift deviation. Another type of restriction on the Yukawa parameter is established when studying the stability of solutions by calculating the square of the speed of sound. In this analysis, only changing the variable term did not produce unstable solutions, due to the fact that it is not\nvery sensitive to changes in the values of \u00b5. Meanwhile, for the global case, the constraint \u00b5 < 2.566 is necessary for the Yukawa\u2013Casimir WH to be stable. Finally, in the constant case, this condition further restricted the allowed values for the Yukawa parameter, such that we must have \u00b5 \u2264 0.618. In all cases, the complete solution of the redshift function cannot be obtained analytically due to local exponential terms in the integrand. Therefore, two approaches were taken. Initially, numerical integration was performed for the variable r/r0 and setting \u00b5 = 0.1, which were reproduced in Figures 2a, 4a and 6a. Finally, an analysis was performed for small values of the Yukawa parameter, which in the first order revealed that \u03a6global(r) = \u03a6constant(r), while, for the radial case, the redshift function does not explicitly depend on the Yukawa parameter. On the other hand, in the second-order, it was found that the global and constant cases become slightly different. Our analysis of small parameters not only allowed us to obtain redshift analytically but also revealed insights into the boundary between the Casimir and Yukawa\u2013Casimir wormholes. This analysis sheds light on why the value that causes the redshift to change is similar in the global (as shown in Figure 2a) and constant (as shown in Figure 4a) cases because they only differ in the second order of \u00b5. Some possible extensions of this work include dimensional generalizations, a study of the effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, and analyses modifying the energy density instead of the shape function.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.H.F.d.O. and G.A.; methodology, P.H.F.d.O.; validation, G.A., I.C.J. and R.R.L.; formal analysis, P.H.F.d.O. and I.C.J.; investigation, P.H.F.d.O.; writing\u2014original draft, P.H.F.d.O.; writing\u2014review & editing, P.H.F.d.O. and I.C.J.; supervision, G.A., I.C.J. and R.R.L.
