Improvement and Validation of Prediction Models: Further refinement and validation of the biological activity and ADMET property prediction models with larger, more diverse datasets could improve accuracy. This could include exploring additional machine learning algorithms beyond MobileNetV3 and the genetic algorithm, such as deep reinforcement learning or transfer learning models, to capture complex nonlinear relationships between molecular descriptors and drug efficacy/safety profiles.

Exploration of Multi-target Drug Design: Since breast cancer is influenced by various factors and pathways, future research could focus on designing drugs that target multiple pathways or receptors simultaneously. Machine learning models could be developed to predict the efficacy of compounds against multiple targets, considering the synergistic effects of drug combinations on breast cancer treatment outcomes.

Integration of Real-world Data: Incorporating real-world patient data, including genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic information, into the drug design process. Machine learning models can be trained on this multifaceted data to identify potential drug candidates tailored to the genetic makeup of individual breast cancer subtypes, moving towards more personalized medicine approaches.

Development of Novel Molecular Descriptors: Research into the creation of novel molecular descriptors that capture the complexity of biological interactions more effectively. These new descriptors could enhance the predictive power of QSAR models for both biological activity and ADMET properties, providing deeper insights into the molecular basis of drug action and toxicity.

Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) Research: As machine learning becomes increasingly integral to drug discovery, addressing the ethical, legal, and social implications of automated drug design is crucial. Future research could explore the impact of these technologies on drug development costs, patient access to novel therapies, data privacy concerns, and the potential biases in machine learning models that may affect treatment efficacy across different populations.
