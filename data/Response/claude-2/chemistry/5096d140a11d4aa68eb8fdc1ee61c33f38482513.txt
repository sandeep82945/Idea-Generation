 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effects of different growing conditions (soil type, climate, etc.) on the phytochemical composition and biological activity of S. minor. This could help optimize cultivation methods to maximize medicinal compound production.

2. Further explore the antiviral properties of S. minor extracts against other viruses beyond herpes simplex virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. This could uncover new antiviral applications. 

3. Isolate and identify additional phenolic compounds from S. minor using advanced chromatographic techniques like HPLC or LC-MS. Some novel compounds may have unique bioactivities.

4. Evaluate the neuroprotective effects of S. minor extracts and compounds in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. The acetylcholinesterase inhibition is promising.

5. Develop novel pharmaceutical formulations containing S. minor extracts or isolated compounds. Optimizing delivery methods could improve bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy.
