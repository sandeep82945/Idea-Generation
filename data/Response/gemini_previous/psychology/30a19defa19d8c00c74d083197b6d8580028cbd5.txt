1. **Investigate the effect of different polymer backbones on the performance of PIL-based membranes.** The current study focused on polystyrene as the polymer backbone, but other polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinylidene fluoride), and poly(ether sulfone), could also be used. These polymers have different properties, such as glass transition temperature, hydrophilicity, and free volume, which could affect the performance of the resulting membranes.


2. **Explore the use of different ionic liquids as counterions in PILs.** The current study investigated three different anions, but there are many other ionic liquids that could be used. These ionic liquids have different properties, such as size, shape, and polarity, which could affect the performance of the resulting membranes.


3. **Investigate the effect of PIL composition on membrane performance.** The current study used a 1:1 ratio of polymer to ionic liquid, but other ratios could also be used. The composition of the PIL could affect the properties of the resulting membrane, such as permeability, selectivity, and mechanical strength.


4. **Study the long-term stability of PIL-based membranes.** The current study did not investigate the long-term stability of the membranes. However, this is an important factor to consider for practical applications. The membranes should be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the gas separation process, such as high pressure and temperature, without losing their performance.


5. **Explore the use of PIL-based membranes for other gas separation applications.** The current study focused on the separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4, but PIL-based membranes could also be used for other gas separation applications, such as the separation of hydrogen from nitrogen or the separation of oxygen from air.
