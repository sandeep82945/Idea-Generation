    "abstractText": "Multi-terminal flexible DC distribution line faults develop rapidly, and power electronic equipment has a poor ability to withstand overcurrent. To solve the aforementioned problem, a DC line unit protection scheme based on improved Grey Slope Relational Analysis (GSRA) of fault currents is proposed to address the issue of achieving a balance between the reliability and speed of relay protection for DC distribution lines. This scheme uses the fault current measured at both ends of the line under various operating conditions, and calculates the correlation between the current at both ends of the positive and negative lines using the slope distance and polarity of the current increments. Based on this, GSRA is used to analyze the correlation of fault signals so that line faults can be eliminated quickly. This protection scheme allows the selectivity of traditional unit protection to be improved. Simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC have shown that this method can achieve fault discrimination and fault pole selection by simultaneously measuring the current at both ends of the line. This fast protection action is not affected by the line distribution capacitance and converter blocking, strong resistance to transition resistance and noise interference, and reliable identification under heavy loads and high-resistance ground faults.

INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for renewable energy worldwide, as the use of traditional fossil fuels has contributed to global warming, causing serious environmental pollution [1], [2]. A flexible multi-terminal DC (MTDC) distribution system with low line losses, high transmission capacity, and efficient access to distributed energy sources has become the key to solving current power distribution problems and the development of power systems in the immediate future [3], [4]. However, the damping of the flexible DC distribution network is low, and the overcurrent generated by the fault may destroy the power electronics within milliseconds, and the traditional protection scheme with low speed is no longer applicable, which puts higher requirements on relay protection [5], [6]. In addition, line faults account for the vast majority of DC system faults, and the fast and reliable identification of faulty lines is a key and difficult point in the development\nof relay protection technology for DC distribution systems [7], [8]. At the present stage, the protection scheme for DC lines is mainly divided into two categories: non-unit protection and unit protection. Non-unit protection measures electrical quantities at the one end of the DC line without transferring the measured values to the other end of the line and determines faults directly based on the measured values at the single end, which has a high speed. In [9], a fast fault recognition scheme based on measured current was proposed, but this scheme could not withstand highintensity noise. [10] and [11] constructed protection schemes used the traveling wave of the initial current and the voltage drop of the initial current limiting reactor (CLR), respectively, and such methods require high sampling frequency. [12] and [13] used the current fault component of the CLR and the voltage integral of the CLR to discriminate line faults and achieve fast fault isolation, respectively, such methods require additional measurement\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

[14] and [15] analyzed aspects such as line frequency parameter models, fault characteristics, and quantify the sensitivity of the flexible DC fault characteristics for different influencing factors, which have complicated threshold rectification of such protection schemes. In general, non-unit protection has the disadvantages of complex threshold rectification, reliance on simulation, inability to tolerate high transition resistance and noise interference, and large influence by system operation modes. Unit protection treats the DC line as a unit, measures electrical quantities at both ends of the line, and compares the data at each end through the communication channel to decide whether to operate for protection, unit protection has a very high selectivity and the simpler threshold adjustment makes the reliability of unit protection relatively higher. There is a relatively large amount of literature on unit protection of DC lines. For example, in [16], the Bhattacharyya distance method was used to determine the fault location based on the conclusion that the measured current waveform characteristics were different on both sides of the line in the case of internal and external faults. In [17], the Pearson correlation coefficients were used to realize the recognition of faulty lines based on the difference in voltage waveforms on both sides of the line at different fault locations. In [18], the protection achieved fault recognition by calculating the transient voltage ratio of the CLR on both sides of the line. In [19], an Event-based protection scheme that requires fewer transmission data and higher speed was proposed. Protection schemes using the difference of fault components of line voltage and current under different location faults were proposed in [20] and [21], respectively, such methods have high communication requirements and poor interference immunity. The current differential protection proposed in [22] and [23] can recognize faults\nquickly and accurately, however, they are susceptible to interference by transition resistance and line-distributed capacitance. [24] and [25] used traveling waves for fault recognition and pole selection, such methods require extremely high sampling frequency, and short DC distribution lines make the cost of sampling equipment increase significantly, whether traveling waves sampling equipment for transmission system are suitable for distribution system is still open to discussion. Unit protection has the problems of dependence on communication and lower speed, how to improve the speed as much as possible while ensuring the reliability and selectivity of unit protection has become the focus of research on unit protection. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a protection scheme based on an improved Grey Slope Relational Analysis (GSRA) of fault currents. First, we calculated the current increments on either side of the positive and negative DC lines. Then, the correlation of the currents at both ends of the positive and negative lines was calculated by extracting their slope distances and polarities. Finally, fault recognition and fault pole selection were realized using GSRA. The protection is lower for communication requirements, the principle is simple, it is unaffected by the transition resistance and loads current, and it has better tolerance to changes in system operation modes and disturbances such as noise. The protection scheme without initiation criteria is not affected by converter blocking and has higher speed and reliability. The feasibility of the protection scheme was verified by simulating and analyzing different working conditions using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform."

The individual ports of the system are numbered as shown in the figure, where T1 and T2 are halfbridge sub-modules based on the MMC, which are connected to the AC system through a 110/10 kV transformer. The system adopts a master-slave control strategy, with the true-bipolar MMC on port T1 as the master control station, using constant DC voltage and constant reactive power control. The true-bipolar MMC on port T2 is the slave control station using constant active and constant reactive power control. Port T3 is a three-phase, two-level VSC using constant AC-side voltage control, which connects the distribution network to the AC load. Pseudo-bipolar MMCs on ports T4 and T5 with islanding control and simultaneous access to AC loads and wind power systems. Ports T6 and T7 are DC transformers (DCT) that connect the distribution network to the DC load and PV system through a dual DAB cascade in the Input Series Output Parallel (ISOP) topology [26], [27]. DAB is controlled by single-phase shift control, which controls the low-voltage side voltage. The ISOP-ISOP line is taken as the research object, and multiple fault points are set. Where f1 is set to 10% of the L2 line length, f2 is set to50 % of the L2 line length, f3 is set to 90% of the L2 line length, f4 is set to the beginning of the L3 line, and f5 is set to the end of the L1 line. When a fault occurs in the DC line of the system, the circuit breakers on both sides of the faulty line will isolate the fault in a timely manner, and the ring topology de-ringing for chain power, which ensures the reliability of the system power supply, a unit protection scheme based on improved GSRA of fault currents is proposed on this basis."

When a PG fault occurs in the DC line, the fault currents at both ends of the fault line grow rapidly in the same direction at approximately the same rate, and their increments are highly positively correlated, while the fault currents at both ends of the healthy line grow slowly at approximately the same rate, and their increments are negatively correlated.

Theoretically, the GSRA can be used to determine and select the fault line directly, but the above correlation is the calculated value of the ideal state. Mutual transformer measurement errors, noise, and other disturbances are simultaneously caused by the actual operation of the system at the same time. In addition, the instantaneous fault current reaches its peak within a few milliseconds after a fault occurs in the DC distribution system, which causes serious damage to the system. Combined with the requirements of the extensive literature on the protection time frame, the faulty line must be identified within 2ms [29]. Combined with the definition of GSRA, when the system has a PPG fault, the calculated value of \u03b3p is approximately 1, whereas the single-pole ground fault will only cause a small disturbance to the healthy pole, and the change is not obvious within 1ms after the fault occurs. The direction of the fault current on both sides of the healthy pole line is negatively correlated, and the calculated value of \u03b3n is closer to 0. When a PP fault occurs in the system, the positive and negative fault currents rise rapidly within 1ms and are positively correlated, and the calculated values of \u03b3p and \u03b3n are about 1.

In this study, the line distributed capacitance is expanded to 2, 5, and 10 times the original value. Taking the occurrence of a PPG fault at f2 as an example, the simulation results of the current GSRA considering the line-distributed capacitance are shown in Fig. 11.\nGSRA uses the current increments at both ends of the line for relational analysis, and the current components of the line distribution capacitance are canceled out and do not participate in the GSRA calculation process during the current increment calculation. It can be observed that when the distributed capacitance of the line increases, the fault current ratio correlation of the positive and negative lines after the fault still presents the same law as the original parameters, the protection can operate correctly, and the protection scheme is not affected by the distributed capacitance of the line."

            "text": "When a fault occurs on any line and is isolated by the system, the distribution system is in an open-loop operation. While the power flowing through each port changes after an openloop operation of the system, the incremental characteristics of the fault current do not change after a fault in any line. This paper sets 0.5 s when line L5 is out of operation with f2 occurring PPG fault as an example, the system operates to 0.75 s when a permanent fault occurs, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 12. It can be observed that the open-loop operation of the system only affects the magnitude of the fault current and does not affect the correct operation of the protection."

            "text": "A DC line generates a serious overcurrent in a short period when a fault occurs in a DC system. To prevent damage to the converter, each converter station monitors the bridge arm current in real time and sets up over-current protection. When the converter self-protection operates, the converter will be blocked, the controllable elements in the converter will be transformed into uncontrolled, and the current characteristics of the faulty line will be changed. Fig. 13 shows the bridge arm current in the DCT when a PP short-circuit fault occurs at f2. If the converter blocking adjustment value is 2 times the rated current, the converter will be self-protected approximately 1ms after a fault occurs.\nThe sampling frequency used in the simulation in this paper is 20 kHz, and the identification time of the fault after the occurrence of the fault is 150 \u00b5s in total for three sampling points. Considering that the logic signal communication time required for a 5 km DC line is approximately 100 \u00b5s [31], [32], the protection can be operated before the converter blocking and is unaffected by the converter. If the sampling frequency is changed to 10 kHz, nine current-ratio correlation signals can still be obtained before the converter is blocked, without affecting the protection operation."

Therefore, in this study, interference noise with a signal-tonoise ratio of 10 dB is added at 0.75 s during the normal operation of the system, and the simulation waveform under the noise interference is shown in Fig. 14. The interference of noise affects the current on both sides of the positive and negative lines simultaneously, which may cause the polarity and amplitude of the current to change and make the protection false. This protection scheme uses the GSRA of the positive and negative line ends of the current increments to constitute the criterion, and the fluctuation of the current has less influence on the increments. Coupled with the threshold adjustment time to consider the reliability of the scheme, the protection does not operate by mistake."

            "text": "This paper proposes a longitudinal protection scheme for multi-terminal flexible DC distribution lines based on fault current incremental GSRA, with comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation verification showing that the proposed protection scheme has the following advantages: 1) The scheme considers the fault current polarity and current incremental GSRA, which are simple to calculate and meet the requirements of DC line protection speed and selectivity simultaneously. 2) The scheme does not require initiation criteria, and communication only requires transmission logic, which is less demanding on system communication and has higher reliability.\n3) The scheme has the ability to withstand high transition resistance and is unaffected by load current, distributed capacitance, noise interference, and converter blocking. 4) The scheme is used for a ring or radial DC grid structure and has a certain reference value for unit protection of DC lines in actual projects. 5) Double-ended volume protection relies on communication, and we will try to combine protection with artificial intelligence algorithms in future work to reduce the impact of various communication errors on protection and improve the fault tolerance of protection."

            "text": "The DCT high voltage side is operated via split capacitor grounding. When a PG fault occurs in the DC line, the fault pole produces a serious overcurrent phenomenon and the healthy pole will only be slightly disturbed; when a PP fault occurs in the DC line, the bipolar line short-circuit current grows rapidly and is very likely to damage the power electronics of the flexible system. Here for more difficult to identify the PG fault than the line PP fault for the first end of the fault pole current analysis. The length of medium voltage DC distribution system cable lines is much smaller than transmission overhead lines, and the distributed capacitance of cable lines is larger, and the transmission of traveling waves on the line will cause the distributed capacitance to charge and discharge several times. The calculation of GSRA is related to the current increment, which is mainly affected by the DC component of the current, in order to eliminate the influence of the line distributed capacitance on the measured current, the measured current at the protection installation is the filtered current after the firstorder low-pass filter [33]. The filtering method is as in (9).\nHp f Hp( ) ( ) (1 ) ( 1)I j I j I j     (9)\nWhere,  is the filtering time constant and If is the shortcircuit current. Therefore, the fault circuit in the capacitor discharge phase during a PPG fault can be equated to a second-order circuit as shown in Fig. 15.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.
