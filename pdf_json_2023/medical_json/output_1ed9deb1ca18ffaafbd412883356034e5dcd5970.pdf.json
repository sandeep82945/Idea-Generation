            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic turned face-to-face learning into online learning, which has an impact on the\noccurrence of academic stress in the world of education [1]\u2013[2]\u2013[3].The study found that 577 students from 17\npolish un experienced academic stress due to online learning. They experience stress, depression, and anxiety [4].\nStudents get a lot of assignments from lecturers during the pandemic, which results in academic stress that affects\nphysical, emotional, behavioural, and mental health [5]. The COVID-19 pandemic also gave birth to mental health\ndisorders, anxiety, depression, and excessive alcohol use [6].\nResearch on 113 undergraduate, master, and doctoral students in Indonesia showed that they experienced\nacademic stress during the pandemic. They have conflicts with friends, and spouses, uncomfortable\nInt J Public Health Sci ISSN: 2252-8806 \nStudent academic stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic \u2026 (Hamidulloh Ibda)\n287\nboarding/home conditions, obstacles to consulting a supervisor, difficulty getting scientific references, difficulty\npaying tuition, and demands for scholarship returns. Doctoral students must experience academic stress compared\nto undergraduate and master's students [7]. If mapped, the causes of academic focus in this research on personal,\neducational, and financial issues. Students results in difficulties adjusting to life in the academic, social\nenvironment, and task demands [8]. Academic stress and social anxiety are recommended to seek healing through\noffline counseling, online counselling, and psychotherapy to reduce angry emotions and increase self-compassion\nwhen experiencing incompetence and failure [9]\u2013[11]. Academic stress is the body\u2019s response to demands related\nto academic tasks that exceed students\u2019 adaptive abilities. Academic stress impacts adverse physical reactions,\nbehaviours, thoughts, and emotions [5], [12], [13]. During a pandemic, the cause of academic stress is different\nfrom academic stress in general. Students\u2019 academic stress generally occurs due to academic assignments,\nconfusion in determining learning goals, concerns of declining achievement, motivation, cognitive, physiology,\nand low effectiveness [12].\nMuch literature explores students\u2019 academic stress during the pandemic; long-term academic stress will\ncause various mental and physiological health disorders. Among the negative impacts are mental health disorders\n(anxiety, emotional fatigue, and depression), as well as physical disorders (decreased immune system, digestive\ndisorders, and as well as insomnia). Depression becomes part of a severe health problem [14]. The pandemic that\nrequires the implementation of online learning causes academic stress due to financial factors, the internet, the\nlength of adaptation, the burden of parents in helping the execution of online learning, difficulty receiving\nmaterials, delays in sending tasks that have an impact on academic achievement [15]. Thus, the most\nstraightforward interpretation to understand students\u2019 academic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic is to look\nat mental health and the impact of academic focus during the pandemic through the latest literature. To strengthen\nthe relevant research arguments here, an initial analysis of thematic associations in the literature related to student\nacademic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed through this systematic literature review using\nVOSviewer software. The initial analysis of thematic associations results in Figure 1 shows that student academic\nstress has a very complex association pattern. Hence, the distribution of articles based on keywords is presented\nin Figure 2.\nFigures 1 and 2 show discussions and studies related to student academic stress during the COVID-19\npandemic very closely with several other study themes such as stress, students, academic-related stress, academic\nperformance, posttraumatic stress disorder, health psychology, academic achievement, emotional intelligence,\ndepression, COVID-19, online exam, academic success, academic engagement, insomnia, coping, parenting style,\ngratitude, and others. The relevance between student academic stress and COVID-19 studies shows a direct link.\n ISSN: 2252-8806\nInt J Public Health Sci, Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2023: 286-295\n288\nHowever, the mental health aspect is not closely related to the theme of academic stress study and COVID-19.\nSeveral studies have examined students\u2019 academic stress, but there are still few that read it with a systematic\nliterature review [16]\u2013[19]. This study explores students\u2019 academic stress with systematic literature review\n[20], [21]. Research on student academic stress with the latest systematic literature review that has been done\nis limited to coping strategies in students with a literature review [22], resilience in college students with a\nmeta-analysis and metaregression study [23], music student workload with a systematic literature review study\n[24], the study of maladaptive coping of nursing students with an integrative review [25], the mental health of\nuniversity students in Southeastern Asia with a systematic literature review [26], and impact of medical\nstudents' academic difficulties with scooping review [27]. This indicates that there is still a lack of studies on\nstudent academic stress with a systematic literature review.\nBased on the above background, this research aims to explore student academic stress during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic through current literature. The findings of this research can be used as a theoretical\nframework for educators in minimising student academic stress because it is still minimally done by other\nresearchers, and the COVID-19 pandemic only occurred in early 2020. This study is driven by three research\nquestions: i) what is the student academic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic? ii) what is the student\u2019s mental\nhealth? ii) what is the impact of academic stress on students?"

Academic stress is a psychic turmoil that impacts the emergence of mental and physical\nhealth problems. When students experience stress, physiological responses occur as an alarm reaction, such as\nan increased heart rate, the appearance of cold sweats, shaking, nausea, lung narrowing, and increased blood\npressure. If this lasts long in students, the body will experience fatigue. Stressful conditions not appropriately\nhandled will penetrate the realm of other psychic disorders, namely anxiety about academic tasks that are not\ncompleted. This anxiety condition will trigger other mental health disorders such as fear, anxiety, psychological\ndistress, and confusion. Despite using artificial technology for online learning, engineering students at the\nUniversity of Pamplona (Colombia) still find symptoms of academic stress due to online learning [54].\nAcademic stress causes are the demands of completing the course at the end of the study period and\nexaminations. To suppress this stress, salivary biochemistry is needed to prevent the development of mental\nhealth disorders [33]. Students\u2019 academic stress occurs due to a lack of motivation to learn, lack of confidence\nin communication between friends, and lack of educational support which has an impact on their academic\nInt J Public Health Sci ISSN: 2252-8806 \nStudent academic stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic \u2026 (Hamidulloh Ibda)\n291\nperformance [54], [61], [78]. Based on clinical observations, the pandemic resulted in student academic stress\ndue to fear of virus transmission, personal and relational life limitations. The COVID-19 student stress\nquestionnaire (CSSQ) on 514 students at several campuses in Italy found that academic stress disrupted\nrelationships and academic climate with professors and friends, and caused theoretical study chaos [77]. A\ncross-sectional online survey from March-May 2020 found that academic stress data occurred due to fear and\ntransmission of COVID-19. The positive impact of students diligently washing their hands and avoiding\ncrowds [66].\nAcademic stress during a pandemic occurs in the learning process and student academic performance\nin the form of academic procrastination. The academic focus during the pandemic impacts increasing student\nassignment and dissertation procrastination [63]. Academic stress increased during the pandemic due to the\nlockdown. The pressure was highest for students majoring in Nursing as it was directly related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic due to the disruption of health training practices and nursing scientific order, decreased\ninteraction with family, financial conditions and emotional increase, and online exam design [76]. The\nexperience of academic stress during the study is comprehensively influenced by microsystems and interactive\neffects between campus and home [64]. Other findings suggest that academic stress occurs due to a mismatch\nbetween the expected learning system and the demands of academic achievement, including learning outcomes\n[56]. Academic focus, if not immediately addressed, has the potential to become chronic stress that increases\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axial activity with changes in the neuroendocrine system, immune\nfunction, and cytokine profile; it has an impact on the decline of the immune system and other physical disease\ndisorders such as internal organ infections, heart disorders, diabetes, and even cancer [44].\nAcademic stress is hazardous when students cannot manage it. The academic focus during the\npandemic can happen to all students. But a study said the prevalence of academic stress is dominant in Health\nScience students. In general, students\u2019 academic focus is due to the shift of learning from manual to digital\n[42]. Stressors during the dominant pandemic resulted from lockdowns, uncertainty over the cessation of the\nCOVID-19 virus, financial constraints, and online learning. Students must guarantee an internet connection\nbecause online lectures are more than 6-8 hours daily, plus many assignments and isolation [71] [36]. The\nCOVID-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS), through a sample of 2,480 students at\nInHolland Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, was found to experience stress, depression, and\nloss of resilience due to online learning [72]. Academic stress is caused by family pressure, class competition,\ncourses, financial burdens, and scholarship requirements [38]. Research on 642 students (aged 18-25 years) in\nMarch-August 2020 found online learning had no impact on academic stress as long as there was an\nintervention and exceptional guidance from lecturers [39]."

            "text": "Lockdowns on many campuses in the world during the pandemic made students experience feelings\nof loneliness and aloofness. They resulted in severe psychological distress symptoms such as anxiety, eating\ndisorders, depression, and others [37], [41], [42], [74], [75], [80]. The trend of students in the health department\nexperiencing high mental health symptoms. In addition to the burden of practice, they experience mental and\nphysical health, which affect high psychological distress and decreased academic performance [62]. Students\nat several campuses in Colombia experience mental health disorders, stress, depression, and anxiety due to\ntechnical constraints in online lectures [46]. Medical students in Malaysia and elsewhere in the study\nexperienced mental health threats during the pandemic [49].\nThe limited space for students has led to an increase in mental health problems, including vulnerability\nto psychopathology, high anxiety in dealing with encouraging news and heightened concern about being\nexposed to the virus [35], decreased self-identity [60], and vulnerability of physical and mental health\ndeterioration [58]. With China\u2019s highest population and COVID rate, mental health disorders are also very\nhigh, especially among university students. This is due to declining social support, unemployment, lack of\naccess to healthcare, financial decline [65], [78], and the uncertainty of the pandemic's end [68], [73]. The\nimpact of the pandemic on the decline in student mental health is due to economic pressure, fear of exposure\nto the virus [70], decreased attention from parents due to inhibition of interaction and communication [52], and\ndecline in physiological health due to lack of quality sleep [47]. From a sample of 209 students, 68% female,\n82% freshmen, 50% Asian, 32% Hispanic, 13% white, and 5% other from a public university in Southern\nCalifornia, USA, it was found that declining mental health included concentration difficulties, academic\nperformance concerns and increased task load [32]."

In Iraq, pandemic\nanxiety is higher among young students [74]. Delays in college graduation due to the pandemic impact anxiety,\nfear, failure of self-regulation, stress, poor intellectual functioning, and poor mental health [48]. Education in\n ISSN: 2252-8806\nInt J Public Health Sci, Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2023: 286-295\n292\nuniversities was disrupted during the pandemic because students experienced pathological expressions ranging\nfrom anxiety, depression, stress, and feelings of sadness [42], [38]. The impact of student academic stress\noccurs due to increased academic procrastination [52], fear of virus transmission and up to academic tasks [37];\nthe pressure is also exacerbated by symptoms of depression and loneliness [40]. Based on research in the United\nStates, academic stress is alleviated through real-time stress mitigation [67], online therapy, face-to-face\nclinical therapy, resilience, mediation, and stress mindset intervention [55], [58], [72]. In Sri Lanka and\nJamaica, preventing academic stress required the role of psychologists and technology management with the\nTelehealth application. Students need to be invited to develop mental health programs using natural positive\ncoping behaviour to overcome student academic problems [50], [68].\nThe academic stress of medical students is dominated by factors of high academic load, long courses,\nlearning hassles, practicums, and exams. The empirical fact of this finding calls for high psychological pressure\nto impact burnout. The burnout intent here is depersonalisation, emotional exhaustion, and a low sense of\npersonal accomplishment that affect mental health and psychological function. The prevalence of burnout in\nmedical students during high medical training is about 43.3%, where 35-45% of medical students experience\nhigh emotional fatigue, 26-38% experience high depersonalisation, and 45-56% have suggestive symptoms\n[45], [49]. Academic stress impacts the quality of life of international students based on their academic standing\nand experience [57]. The level of academic stress in health science students (nursing, midwifery, and medicine)\nis higher than students in other fields of science. This is due to the many patient practice assignments that\ncannot be carried out. As for practice in the health sector, it is an essential point for mastering competencies in\nthe health sector [31]."

The\nresults elaborated on the explanation that students\u2019 academic stress during the pandemic was accurate due to\nvarious factors, such as piled-up college assignments, emotional conditions, financial factors, family, internet\nconnection, fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus, and lockdown. COVID-19 also confirmed the symptoms\nof student mental disorders such as health problems, physiological, depression, symptoms of distress, anxiety,\nand poor sleep quality that impact academic performance and performance. The impact of academic stress\nresults in depression, burnout, poor mental health, and even suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, the findings in\nthis article strengthen strategies to prevent student academic stress through online and offline therapy,\nresilience, mediation, mindset intervention, praying to god and maintaining control over the COVID-19\npandemic situation."
