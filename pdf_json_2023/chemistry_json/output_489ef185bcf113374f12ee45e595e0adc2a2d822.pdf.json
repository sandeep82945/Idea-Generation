    "abstractText": "Background: The goal of skin cleansing is to reduce sebum and exogenous pollutants and control the skin microbiome. Surfactants in cleansers dissolve hydrophobic substances in an aqueous phase and allow them to move away from the skin's surface. The negative effect of surfactants on the skin barrier can be reduced by changing the solution properties. As a dermatologist in the group of patients we encounter in our clinical dermatology practice who recommends face wash products, we thought of conducting this research in order to determine the product contents to identify the products with the highest user satisfaction so that we can easily make the selection of the right product and direct the patients correctly. Materials and methods: We planned to conduct cross-sectional research. Ten facial cleansing products sold on the most popular website that sells dermo-cosmetic products online in our country were selected. In the selection of the website, the criterion of having the most Internet traffic was sought. Internet traffic data was obtained from www.similarweb.com. The classification of the identified key ingredients according to their chemical properties was used on https://cosmeticanalysis.com. Reviews for each of the ten products in total were examined from the most recent date to the oldest. Results: We detected 87 different chemicals in ten different products. These basically consisted of surfactants, emollients (moisturizers), emulsifiers (cleansers), buffering (denaturators), herbal ingredientsantioxidants, solvents, and moisturizers. A total of 30 different surfactants were identified as the main cleaning ingredient in the examined products. Counterfeit product reporting was especially high on expensive products. No correlation was found between the number of surfactants in the products and the positive effects, such as cleansing and acne reduction and increase, and the negative effects, such as dryness, redness, burning, and smoothing/softening (p>0.05). There was a negative correlation between the cleansing effect of the products and the improvement and worsening of acne (p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The bottom line is that a good facial cleansing product doesn't have to contain a lot of chemicals and surfactants. It should be kept in mind that expensive products may be counterfeit and should question whether the product is original or not on the local product detection system from the barcode number.

            "text": "This article was included in the 9th International Congress of Medicine and Health Sciences Research in Ankara, Turkey, on March 18-19, 2022, as an oral presentation.\nFacial cleansing is necessary for personal hygiene. In addition, the appearance of the skin on the face is essential in terms of health and beauty. The history of soap, which is the predecessor of modern facial cleaning products, dates back to 2500 BC with the Sumerians. With the increase in cosmetic expectations other than health and hygiene, facial cleaning products are now offered in creams, gels, foams, bars, and liquids [1,2].\nThe goal of skin cleansing is to reduce sebum and exogenous pollutants and to control the skin microbiome. To maintain the skin barrier during cleaning, it is necessary to preserve endogenous lipids and the natural skin structure. The surfactants in the cleansers dissolve the hydrophobic substances in an aqueous phase, allowing them to move away from the skin\u2019s surface [3].\nThe components of Skin cleansing products also have therapeutic benefits. For example, product ingredients improve disease symptoms and can reduce possible skin irritation caused by topical medications. In addition, they can cause changes in the superficial and deep layers of the epidermis and have undesirable effects such as irritation, allergy, and cytotoxicity [4].\nHow to cite this article G\u00fcder S, G\u00fcder H (May 07, 2023) Investigation of the Chemical Content and User Comments on Facial Cleansing Products. Cureus 15(5): e38673. DOI 10.7759/cureus.38673\nSurfactants often cause irritant reactions similar to allergic reactions due to their ability to dissolve lipid membranes when they come into contact with the skin [5]. The North American Contact Dermatitis Group reported a prevalence of contact allergy due to a group of surfactants in hypoallergenic fluid scavengers between 0.9% and 2.3% [6]. No irritant reaction was observed in a study in which eight surfactants commonly used in skin cleansers were evaluated by patch testing on 105 patients. In contrast, only one surfactant had a sensitizing effect of around 5% [7].\nThe negative effect of highly active substances on the skin barrier can be reduced by changing the solution properties. For example, adding polymers, such as polyethylene oxide and polyethylene glycol, to the solution and adding amphoteric surfactants or glycerin minimizes the deterioration of the skin barrier [3].\nPeople who need a facial cleansing product have many options to search for information and access therapies other than consulting a dermatologist for treatment recommendations. Therefore, encountering and retaining these patients can be difficult for dermatologists. Dermatologists need to provide satisfactory service because these patients can quickly seek treatment elsewhere via the Internet or other nondermatologist options [8].\nWe conducted this research to determine the products with the highest user satisfaction and side effects reported by users. Although the research is based in Turkey, we believe that our results will reflect the general population because the products we reviewed are used worldwide."

            "text": "The cosmetic facial cleansing products that our patients often consult us about and that we recommend have many variables. We conducted this research to determine the products with the highest user satisfaction and side effects reported by users.\nWe assumed that facial cleansing products would have more in common with each other, but we found that they contain many different chemicals. This may be due to manufacturers\u2019 desires to make their products unique and not to imitate others.\nThe fact that the products have similar star ratings may be due to the adjustment of the sales site by the artificial intelligence algorithm. The high number of counterfeit product notifications for expensive products may be because those selling counterfeit products want to earn high profits via the original manufacturer brands. There is a risk of encountering counterfeit products when buying expensive facial cleansers online.\nWhen we analyzed the reviews, we found a negative correlation between the cleansing effect and the improvement in acne. We hypothesized that this condition might be follicular irritant dermatitis due to\n2023 G\u00fcder et al. Cureus 15(5): e38673. DOI 10.7759/cureus.38673 7 of 8\nirritants or allergens and that users may have interpreted this as increased acne [9]. There was also a negative correlation between the cleansing effect and the worsening of acne. We thought this might indicate that the product reduces acne [10].\nWe did not find a correlation between the number of surfactants and chemicals in the products and the cleansing effects, positive effects, and side effects. This may be because although the number of chemicals and surfactants in the products is few, the chemical content is in the right proportions or quantities. In addition, a product that contains a small number of surfactants or auxiliary chemicals does not necessarily have a low quality of cleaning."
