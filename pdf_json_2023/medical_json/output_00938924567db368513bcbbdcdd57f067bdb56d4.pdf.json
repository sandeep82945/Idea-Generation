    "abstractText": "Long-term storage is necessary to mitigate for seasonal variation in algae productivity, to preserve biomass quality and to guarantee a constant biomass supply to a conversion facility. While ensiling has shown promise as a solution, biomass attributes for successful storage are poorly understood. Storage studies of Monoraphidium sp. biomass indicate a strong correlation between nitrogen management in algae cultivation and stability of post-harvest algae biomass. Algae cultivated with periodic nitrogen addition were stored poorly ( > 20% loss, dry basis ) compared to biomass from nitrogen depleted cultivation ( 8% loss, dry basis ) . A follow-up study compared the post-harvest stability of Monoraphidium biomass cultivated in nitrogen-deplete or nitrogen-replete conditions. Replete biomass experienced the largest degradation ( 24%, dry basis ) , while deplete biomass experienced the least ( 10%, dry basis ) . Dry matter loss experienced among blends of each correlated positively with nitrogen-replete biomass content. The composition of the post-storage algae microbial community was also affected by cultivation conditions, with Clostridia species being more prevalent in stored biomass obtained from nitrogen-replete cultivations. Nitrogen management has long been known to influence algae biomass productivity and biochemical composition; here, we demonstrate that it also strongly influences the stability of post-harvest algae biomass in anaerobic storage.",

Ensiling is a low-energy input approach to preservation that oes not require drying and relies on the metabolism of lactic cid bacteria ( LAB ) to stabilize the biomass ( Rooke & Hatfield, 003 ) . Ensiling has been successfully applied to preserve winter feed or livestock from diverse forage crops, such as whole-crop corn Muck, 2002 ) , corn stover ( Wendt et al., 2018 ) , grasses ( McGechan, 990 ; Parvin et al., 2010 ) , alfalfa ( Luo et al., 2021 ) , wheat ( Pieper t al., 2011 ) , sweet sorghum ( Linden et al., 1987 ) , and others ( Muck t al., 2018 ) . Ensiling prevents excessive microbial degradation by everaging LAB-mediated lactic acid fermentation in an anaerobic nvironment to reduce the pH to a point where further microbial ctivity is greatly reduced ( \u223c < 4.5 ) , resulting in stable material McDonald et al., 1991 ) . In addition to preserving lignocellulosic eedstocks for feed and forage, ensiling has been studied as an efective approach to preserving feedstock for bioenergy production Wendt & Zhao, 2020 ) . Ensiling of microalgae and microalgae blended with lignocelulosic biomass has recently been demonstrated to be an effecive approach to stably preserving microalgae biomass ( Wendt t al., 2017 ) , limiting loss to < 10% over 6 months ( Wahlen et al., 020 ; Wendt et al., 2019 ) . Information on the material attributes of icroalgae critical to successful ensiling is not well known with imited examples in the literature. In contrast, factors affecting uccessful ensiling for lignocellulosic materials are well undertood ( Rooke & Hatfield, 2003 ) . Rapid pH reduction by lactic acid ermentation is essential for producing well-ensiled herbaceous iomass. The availability of carbohydrates for fermentation, the nitial pH of the biomass and its buffering capacity strongly affect ow rapidly lactic acid builds up and pH drops ( McDonald et al., 991 ) . It is reasonable to expect that similar attributes impact the tability of ensiled microalgae. The biochemical composition of microalgae varies by strain nd culture conditions. Rapidly growing microalgae strains, such s Scenedesmus spp., have a biochemical composition defined by igh protein content and lower levels of lipids and carbohyrates. Carbohydrate and lipid contents increase upon depletion f the nitrogen source, and the rate of microalgae productivity ecreases. Little is known about how growth-related fluctuations n carbohydrates, protein, and lipids impact microalgae stability ost-harvest. In this study, microalgal biomass from the strain onoraphidium minutum 26BAM cultivated in nitrogen-replete conitions and nitrogen-deplete conditions was assessed for its poential for successful preservation by ensiling. The impact that ultivation conditions had in storage was assessed by measuring ry matter loss, organic acid production, changes in biochemical omposition, and microbial community composition.\naterials and Methods lgae Biomass wo separate storage studies were conducted with M. minutum 6BAM biomass.

A week before harvest, when the N-replete raceways ere reset ( 84% volume removed and media replaced ) , the second et of raceways was allowed to continue to grow without removing ny culture or adding any nutrients. Algae biomass was dewatered y centrifugation at 1800 \u00d7 g ( Lavin 20\u20131160 V, AML Industries, nc., Warren, OH ) .

One panel was allowed to go eplete of nitrogen ( N-deplete ) , while the other was maintained eplete ( N-replete ) . Flat-panel algae cultures were dewatered as escribed above and sent on ice in an insulated container to INL or stability studies.\ntorage Experiments pon receiving the initial biomass storage, studies were initiated or both the nitrogen-replete ( biomass with media replacement ) nd nitrogen-deplete biomass ( continued growth, no media ddition ) as described previously ( Wendt et al., 2019 ) . Briefly, each atch of biomass was added to three 125 mL jars without treatent ( about 15 g, dry basis, db ) . Jars were sealed with lids fitted ith a through-bulkhead fitting ( Swagelok, Solon, OH ) with an atached ball valve ( Swagelok, Solon, OH ) . Jars ( with and without ids ) were weighed before and after adding biomass. Sealed jars ere then made anaerobic by alternately exposing the jar to vacum and nitrogen gas. Tedlar gas collection bags were fitted to the op of the ball valve with C-flex Ultra tubing ( Masterflex, P/N EW6434\u201316, Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL ) . The biomass was then inubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 days.

The N-deplete biomass tored without treatment experienced the least dry matter loss t 8.3% ( db ) and a final pH of 4.2, indicating that lactic acid ferentation was improved in this condition compared to either case f the N-replete biomass. Interestingly, when N-deplete biomass as inoculated with L. buchneri dry matter loss increased to 15.4% db ) and the final pH was higher at 4.9. L. buchneri has been shown o improve storage stability of herbaceous plant material when dded as a silage inoculant ( Holzer et al., 2003 ) . Higher dry matter oss compared to the uninoculated algae biomass could be a reult of the inoculant not increasing enough in abundance during torage or perhaps is not well suited to enhancing the preservaion of Monoraphidium biomass. Additionally, L. buchneri is a heteroermentative LAB whose metabolism produces lactic acid, acetic cid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. The complement of organic acids produced during ensiling can e indicative of storage performance ( Borreani et al., 2018 ; Muck t al., 2018 ) . Well-ensiled material has lactic acid as its primary omponent, while acetic and propionic acids are less prevalent, nd butyric acid is absent. Both acetic and propionic acids are less esirable than lactic acid due to their higher pKa ( 4.76 and 4.88, repectively, compared to 3.86 ) . Butyric acid is formed by Clostridia etabolism and is accompanied by significant loss of dry mat-\ner as CO 2 ( Borreani et al., 2018 ) . The most abundant organic acid n the N-replete biomass after storage was butyric acid followed y acetic acid for both the untreated- and LAB-inoculated conitions ( Fig. 1 ) . Lactic acid was not observed in either condition. onversely, N-deplete biomass had lactic acid as the prominent rganic acid in the untreated condition, and butyric acid was ot observed. When inoculated with L. buchneri , lactic acid was resent at > 2% ( db ) but was less than either acetic or propinic acids. This type of mixed acid fermentation is common to L. uchneri , which employs heterolactic fermentation ( Holzer et al., 003 ) . Heterolactic fermentation of hexose sugars yields lactic cid, ethanol, and CO 2 , and pentoses are converted to lactic and\ncetic acid ( Borreani et al., 2018 ; Holzer et al., 2003 ) . The higher ry matter loss in N-deplete biomass inoculated with L. buchneri ould in part be explained by this fermentation; however, the exent of loss is greater than anticipated. The organic acid compoition characteristic of L. buchneri metabolism indicates that the noculum grew effectively, but without increased stability. Butyric cid was also not observed in N-deplete biomass inoculated with . buchneri , also an indication that the LAB inoculum was funcional, as L. buchneri has been shown to be effective at inhibiting lostridia ( Carvalho et al., 2012 ) . Several hypotheses attempting to explain observed differences n preservation were considered. N-replete and N-deplete cultures iffered in nitrogen availability. Could this difference have altered he microbiome in such a way that N-replete algae biomass was t greater risk of microbial degradation? Could the difference n nitrogen availability have led to higher bacterial numbers in -replete biomass, leading to higher losses? Or could differences n biomass composition resulting from nitrogen availability imact storage stability? Given the large differences in storage outomes exhibited by each biomass when stored without treatment, follow-on experiment was developed to replicate the results and ttempt at answering these questions. The follow-on experiment utilized closed, flat-panel phoobioreactors to cultivate Monoraphidium in replete-nitrogen\nTable 2.

Each bar represents storage experiments performed in triplicate.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad004/7079137 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nconditions, and in a separate set of flat-panel reactors a Monoraphidium culture was allowed to go nitrogen deplete. Closed photobioreactors were selected in order to minimize environmental contamination and the impact of the initial microbiome on storage stability. Each biomass was stored without additional treatment, as was done in the first experiment and under the same conditions. The storage performance of blended N-replete and Ndeplete biomass in ratios of 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 ( N-replete and N-deplete biomass ) is shown in Table 2 . Stored N-replete biomass had the greatest dry matter loss with 24% ( db ) , comparable to the N-replete biomass from the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study. The pH was similarly circumneutral at 6.92, much higher than the value needed for successful ensiling ( 4.5 ) . Blends of N-replete and N-deplete biomass experienced less loss with increasing N-deplete biomass content. The pH of the blends experienced a similar pattern of decreasing value with increasing N-deplete biomass content, though none of the blends achieved target pH values for ensiling. The lowest dry matter loss was observed in 100% N-deplete biomass ( 10%, db ) with a pH value of 5.2, still far too high for effective preservation. The inability of the N-deplete biomass to achieve a stable pH in storage could be related to the differences between the N-replete and N-deplete biomass that arise during nitrogen depletion. It is possible that nitrogen depletion was not carried out far enough to achieve the biomass characteristics that would support effective ensiling. The biomass composition will be addressed later in this study. Dry matter loss was negatively correlated with the amount of N-deplete biomass present in each storage condition and exhibited a proportional decrease with increasing N-deplete biomass content. Linear regression analysis identified a negative relationship between dry matter loss and N-deplete biomass content with an R 2 value of 0.96 ( Fig. 2 ) . This relationship is consistent with both the nitrogen content hypothesis and the biochemical composition hypothesis. If increased amount of nitrogen available in N-replete biomass was detrimental to storage, then addition of N-deplete biomass would dilute its effect. Likewise, if the biochemical composition of N-deplete biomass were favorable to storage, then its addition would improve storage outcomes in a concentrationdependent manner.\nThe organic acid content and composition of stored algae biomass also exhibited a dependence on the nitrogen status during cultivation ( Fig. 2 ) . N-replete cultivated biomass had the most organic acid production in storage with > 22% ( db ) , and N-deplete biomass had the least production at 9% ( db ) . Organic acid content of blends was intermediate to these values. In addition to observed differences in total organic acid, the composition of the organic acids produced also varied between N-replete and N-deplete biomass. The relative concentration of butyric acid, a byproduct of Clostridia metabolism and often an indicator of silage spoiling, was\nhighest in N-replete biomass and blends ( 32\u201336% ) and lowest in Ndeplete biomass. N-deplete biomass had higher relative concentrations of succinic and lactic acids, 16 and 20% of total acids, respectively. By comparison, lactic and succinic acids together only comprised 3% each of the total organic acid in stored N-replete biomass. Lactic acid content is highly beneficial to achieving stability in ensiled biomass.\nLactic acid production in the ensiling process can be influenced by a number of factors. Water-soluble carbohydrates, or carbohydrates that are readily available for fermentation, and sufficient water are necessary to support lactic acid fermentation of both fresh and senesced material such as grass and wheat straw ( McEniry et al., 2010 ; Thompson et al., 2005 ) and would likely be important factors in lactic acid fermentation in algae biomass. Algae biomass stored after harvest contains 80% moisture and therefore is not moisture limited. The presence of sufficient carbohydrate to support robust lactic acid fermentation could be impacted by algae cultivation conditions. N-replete conditions are known to favor protein accumulation, while N-deplete conditions promote carbohydrate accumulation as a means of carbon/energy storage. Differences in carbohydrate content of each\nTable 3.

Carbohydrate content was 2.1 and 2.4 times higher in he N-deplete biomass than the N-replete biomass used in the \u2018Initial\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Blend\u2019\u2019 experiments, respectively. The lipid content aries the least across cultivation approaches and experiments. he N-replete biomass in the \u2018\u2018Initial\u2019\u2019 study had the highest lipid ontent at 14%, which is consistent with rapidly growing cells and ikely consists of membrane lipids and not neutral lipids ( Dong t al., 2016 ; Williams & Laurens, 2010 ) . Each remaining biomass sed in the study had a lipid content of 11%. Nitrogen depletion an cause algae cells to become enriched for carbohydrates and, f allowed to persist for a sufficient time in cultivation, can lead to eutral lipid accumulation ( Dong et al., 2016 ) . The precise impact f nitrogen limitation on biochemical composition can be strainpecific, but there is a general trend of increased carbohydrate nd/or lipid content at the expense of protein when nitrogen is imited ( Williams & Laurens, 2010 ) . Glucan is the most abundant carbohydrate in all but one type f biomass used in this study ( Table 3 ) . In the N-replete biomass tilized in the \u2018\u2018Blend\u2019\u2019 study, mannan was 38% more abundant han glucan, and galactan was just as prevalent. In all other cases, annan was the second most abundant carbohydrate. Xylan was bserved at trace levels, and arabinan was not detected. Carbohydrates were the fraction of algae biomass most af-\nected by storage; carbohydrate content was reduced by as much s 42% ( Table 3 ) . Degradation of carbohydrates is expected even n well-ensiled biomass, where sugars are consumed by LAB, proucing lactic acid that lowers the pH to the point where microial metabolism is significantly slowed ( Rooke & Hatfield, 2003 ) . rotein was not observed to change during storage and even apeared to increase under some conditions. This could be a deominator issue where total protein is being divided by a smaller mount of biomass after degradation in storage. The protein estiation makes the assessment of degradation in storage unclear. rotein is not directly measured but is calculated by multiply-\nng the biomass nitrogen content by a conversion factor ( 4.78 ) Templeton & Laurens, 2015 ) . This is accurate if the total N paritioned to amino acids is the same before and after storage. If mino acids are degraded, but nitrogen remains in solution as a yproduct of metabolism, such as a biological amine, then total itrogen would not change, and protein would appear to be unhanged. Total amino acid compositional analysis is necessary to efinitively determine the impact of storage on protein content. his analysis was not done as part of this experiment. Significant differences in biochemical composition are evident\nue to nitrogen management in cultivation. When nitrogen is lentiful, protein content is high, and carbohydrate content is low. hen nitrogen becomes deplete in cultivation, protein content\ns reduced, and carbohydrates accumulate. These differences in omposition could impact how the microbial community changes, n response to available substrates, during anaerobic storage of lgae biomass.\netagenomics of the Algae Microbiome he relative abundance of bacteria in M. minutum 26BAM alae biomass used in these studies was investigated using nexteneration sequencing. This facilitated a comparison of the algae iomass microbiome for algae cultivated under different nitrogen egimes ( N-replete and N-deplete ) and provided an understanding f how anaerobic storage causes the community to shift. The microbiome of the as-received N-replete and N-deplete iomass used in the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study each consisted of bacteria rom the same top seven bacterial classes with Alphaproteobacteia ( 48 and 35%, respectively ) being the most prominent, differing nly in the mean relative abundance of each class ( Fig. 3 ) . Storge of each biomass, whether untreated or after inoculation with . buchneri , resulted in the proliferation of bacteria in the class acilli , achieving mean relative abundances from 40 to 89%. LAB, hich are essential for successful ensiling, are members of Bacilli Fig. 3 ) ( Pfeiler & Klaenhammer, 2007 ) . In addition to encouraging he growth of beneficial Bacilli , the storage of N-replete biomass lso supported the growth of Clostridia , a class of bacteria associted with excessive biomass degradation ( Rooke & Hatfield, 2003 ) . n contrast to the N-replete biomass, Clostridia were limited to < .1% mean relative abundance in the N-deplete biomass in each torage condition, whether stored untreated or after L. buchneri noculation. While L. buchneri inoculation was not necessary for he proliferation of Bacilli in either biomass, it did substantially ncrease the abundance of Bacilli in the N-deplete biomass from\nFig. 3.

Algae biomass was stored for 30 days. \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 indicates blends of both N-replete and N-deplete biomass: ( B1 ) 25%, ( B2 ) 50%, and ( B3 ) 75% N-deplete biomass. The microbial community composition of the \u2018\u2018Initial\u2019\u2019 experiment is described in the first six bars on the left and that of the \u2018\u2018Blend\u2019\u2019 study in the last seven bars on the right.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad004/7079137 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\n40 to 89% ( Fig. 3 ) . Interestingly, the increase in Bacilli facilitated by L. buchneri inoculation did not improve dry matter stability. A follow-up storage study that looked at the effect of blending N-replete and N-deplete biomass at varying ratios on storage stability ( \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 ) demonstrated similar changes to the microbiome ( Fig. 3 ) . The initial microbial communities for each nutrient condition were similar to each other differing only in the relative abundance of each class. Although the algae growth for the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 storage studies were separated by nearly a year and were cultivated in different environments ( open raceway [\u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019] and closed photobioreactor ( \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 ) ] with different potentials for contamination, the community composition was remarkably consistent. The absence of bacteria from the class Fimbriimonadia in algae used for the \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 study being the only difference. Similar trends in changes to the relative abundance of each bacterial class were observed for the \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 study. Clostridia were most prevalent in the stored N-replete biomass and blend with higher ratios of N-replete biomass with a high of 31% mean relative abundance ( Fig. 3 ) . Bacilli increased in relative abundance with increasing ratios of Ndeplete biomass and Clostridia decreased, reaching a low of 4% in stored 100% N-deplete biomass. Comparing the two storage studies, \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018blend,\u2019\u2019 the mean relative abundance of Clostridia in stored biomass was similar for algae cultivated under nitrogen-replete conditions, but the relative abundance of Bacilli was much greater in biomass from the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study ( Fig. 3 ) .\nGenera present in the N-replete and N-deplete as-received biomass from either the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 studies differ only in their relative abundance ( Fig. 4 a and b ) . This only considers genera that were present at 4% or greater in any one sample. There could be genera of lower abundance that are present in some of the as-received samples but not others. This indicates that the differences in the microbial community that develop over the course\nof storage do so due to substrate availability and not the initial composition of the microbial community.\nGenera such as Enterococcus and Clostridium sensu stricto ( groups 1 and 18 ) in the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study and Lactococcus and Clostridium sensu stricto ( group 18 ) in the \u2018\u2018blend\u2019\u2019 study were only present in the N-replete biomass after storage, where in-storage degradation was considerably greater ( Fig. 4 ) . Clostridia are often found in silage with lower dry matter content ( higher moisture ) and where acidification of silage is delayed; either by pH buffering ( Muck, 1988 ) or by insufficient lactic acid fermentation caused by low concentrations of fermentable sugars ( Borreani et al., 2018 ) . Moisture is unlikely to be the cause of differences in relative abundance of Clostridia as the N-deplete biomass in both studies had lower dry matter content than did either N-replete biomass. Lactic acid titrations were conducted with the as-received N-replete and N-deplete biomass from the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study to determine buffering effects. The N-deplete biomass required 3.6 mL of lactic acid solution per gram of biomass ( db ) to reach the pKa of lactic acid ( 3.9 ) , while a pH of 3.9 was reached with just 2.5 mL lactic acid solution per gram of biomass for the N-replete biomass. The presence of Clostridia in stored N-replete samples and its absence in N-deplete biomass could be explained by the availability of carbohydrates in each biomass from both studies. Although we cannot rule out the impact of more overall nitrogen present in the N-replete biomass, the total nitrogen in both biomasses is much higher than would be present in a typical feed silage ( Pieper et al., 2011 ; Rooke & Hatfield, 2003 ) . In addition to impacting the microbial community through acidification, LAB have been shown to directly inhibit Clostridia through the production of bacteriocins ( Okereke & Montville, 1991 ) . Although bacteriocins, proteinaceous toxins, were not measured in this study; they could limit the growth of Clostridia during storage.\nBoth Enterococcus and Lactococcus are LAB, known for their lactic acid fermentation that is vital for successful ensiling. It seems\nFig. 4. Heat map showing the relative abundance of genera present at > 4% in any one sample.

Cai et al. report that Enterococcus pecies isolated from forage crops did not improve silage qualty when utilized as silage inoculants ( Cai, 1999 ) . The authors atributed the poor performance to the low tolerance of Enterococcus o pH below 4.5. Enterococci thrive initially but begin to die off at H below 4.5. The authors also noted that Enterococcus was unable o inhibit Clostridia growth and, consequently, their impact on dry atter loss. Other researchers have also noted that enterococci, actococci, pediococci, and leuconostocs initiate the silage process hrough lactic acid fermentation and are later supplanted by the ore acid-tolerant lactobacilli ( Lin et al., 1992 ; Parvin et al., 2010 ) . his provides an explanation as to why Enterococcus is prevalent n the stored N-replete biomass of the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study but absent n the N-deplete biomass and does not preclude the possibility of nterococcus contributing in the early phase of storage. The stored -deplete biomass, where Lactobacillus was present in higher numers, reached lower pH values that could have caused Enterococcus o decrease in numbers. Inoculation of forage crops with strains of LAB has been a comon practice in the feed and forage industry to ensure enough\nactobacilli are present to achieve robust lactic acid fermentation McDonald et al., 1991 ) . To this end, we inoculated both the Neplete and N-deplete biomass with L. buchneri , a strain that has uccessfully improved the silage quality of a number of feedstocks Holzer et al., 2003 ) . Inoculation of algae biomass with L. bucheri did not improve the preservation of N-deplete Monoraphidium iomass compared to storage without inoculation. The > 80% relaive abundance of Lactobacillus in stored N-deplete ( \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 study ) iomass that had been inoculated with L. buchneri compared to relative abundance of 17% for N-deplete biomass that had not een inoculated indicates that the failure of the inoculant to imrove storage was not due to a lack of growth but perhaps due to he particular species of Lactobacillus .\nLactobacillus buchneri , a heterofermentative LAB, has a unique etabolism. In addition to producing both lactic acid and acetic cid as is common for heterofermentative LAB, L. buchneri conumes extracellular lactic acid, producing acetic acid and 1,2- ropanediol ( not measured ) . The organic acid composition of inculated N-deplete biomass with its lower lactic acid content and igher acetic and propionic acids compared to the uninoculated iomass is consistent with the metabolism of L. buchneri , demontrating that inoculants can be used to alter the fermentation and icrobial community that occur during storage of algae biomass s has been observed in the ensiling of forage crops. Based on the oor storage performance of L. buchneri -inoculated algae biomass, different strain of LAB might be more successful in decreasing H and thus preserving biomass. Lactobacillus was not found in any of the stored samples in the \u2018blend\u2019\u2019 study. This could be because it was not found in either f the as-received biomasses or because the necessary conditions hat favor its proliferation did not develop during storage in the \u2018blend\u2019\u2019 study.\nonclusions his research demonstrates the importance of nitrogen manageent in cultivation to ensure that algae biomass destined for torage is successfully preserved through ensiling. When grown ith sufficient nitrogen ( N-replete ) , the lower carbohydrate conent cannot sustain sufficient lactic acid fermentation to stabilize he biomass, permitting butyric acid fermentation and biomass egradation by Clostridia . The higher carbohydrates accumulated y Monoraphidium biomass that was allowed to go deplete of itrogen in cultivation, in contrast, encouraged the growth of LAB hile inhibiting Clostridia . This result, which was repeated in conecutive studies, indicates the importance of nitrogen manageent to downstream operations in an algae biorefinery.\n04557.x\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad004/7079137 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024"
