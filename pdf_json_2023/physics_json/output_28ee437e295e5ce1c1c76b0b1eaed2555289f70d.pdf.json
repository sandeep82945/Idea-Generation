    "abstractText": "Elucidating the solvation and size effects on the reactions between water and neutral metals is crucial for understanding the microscopic mechanism of the catalytic processes but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target due to the difficulty in size selection. Here, MO4H6 and M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) complexes were synthesized using a laser\u2013vaporization cluster source and characterized by size-specific infrared-vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The MO4H6 and M2O6H7 complexes were found to have HcM(OH)3(H2O) and M2(m2-OH)2(h -OH)3(h OH2) structures, respectively. A combination of experiments and theory revealed that the formation of HcM(OH)3(H2O) and M2(m2-OH)2(h -OH)3(h -OH2) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. The results indicated that upon the addition of water to HcM(OH)3, the feature of the hydrogen radical is retained. In the processes from mononuclear HcM(OH)3 to binuclear M2(m2OH)2(h -OH)3(h -OH2), the active hydrogen atom undergoes the evolution from hydrogen radical / bridging hydrogen / metal hydride / hydrogen bond, which is indicative of a reduced reactivity. The present system serves as a model for clarifying the solvation and size effects on the reactions between water and neutral rare-earth metals and offers a general paradigm for systematic studies on a broad class of the reactions between small molecules and metals at the nanoscale.",

The second harmonic of a Nd: YAG laser (532 nm) was employed to ablate the metal target, with a pulse energy of 1.0 mJ. The reaction gas was introduced using a Parker pulse valve (Series 009), with a pulse width of 180 ms. The molecular beams that passed through a 4 mm-diameter skimmer were ionized by a VUV laser and then detected by a reectron time-of-ight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS).\nVUV light with a wavelength of 193 nm was produced by an ArF excimer laser (COMPex 50 F, Coherent, Germany), with an energy of 14 mJ per pulse. The infrared laser was delivered by a potassium titanyl phosphate/potassium titanyl arsenate optical parametric oscillator/amplier system (OPO/OPA, LaserVision) pumped by another seeded Nd: YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite EX). The OPO/OPA system was tunable from 700 to 7000 cm\u22121, with a line width of 1 cm\u22121.\nThe pulse valve, the vaporization laser, and VUV light were operated at 20 Hz. The tunable IR light pulse was introduced at approximately 150 ns prior to the VUV pulse in a crossed manner and operated at 10 Hz. When the resonant vibrational transition was irradiated by the IR laser light and caused vibrational predissociation, a depletion of a selected neutral cluster mass signal was detected. The infrared spectra were recorded from the difference between the mass spectral signals with and without the infrared laser (IR laser ON minus IR laser OFF). The IR spectra of the size-selected neutral MO4H6 and M2O6H7 complexes were obtained from the depletion spectrum of the ion signal intensity as a function of the IR wavelength. Typical spectra were recorded by scanning the IR wavelength in the steps of 2 cm\u22121 and averaging over 400 laser shots at each wavelength. The infrared wavelength was calibrated using a commercial wavelength meter (HighFinesse GmbH, WS6-200 VIS IR).\nQuantum chemical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 package35 at the TPSSh/def2-TZVP level of theory. Our test calculations indicated that the TPSSh functional has\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Accordingly, we chose the TPSSh functional instead of the B2PLYPD3 or B3LYP functionals that we used in previous works.30,31 For the possible isomerization paths, the initial structures of the transition states were constructed manually and optimized in the Berny algorithm. Intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRC) of all the transition states were carried out to conrm that the transition states were connected to the initial and nal states. The relative energies and energy barriers were calculated for 0 K structures, including the zero-point vibrational corrections. The harmonic vibrational frequencies were scaled by a factor of 0.968 in order to account for the method-dependent systematic errors.36 The resulting stick spectra were convoluted by a Gaussian line shape function with a 15 cm\u22121 width at half-maximum (FWHM)."

            "text": "As exemplied by the Sc + H2O reaction, the mass spectrum of the species is shown in Fig. S1.\u2020 The experimental IR spectra of neutral MO4H6 and M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) complexes in the OH stretching region are shown in Fig. 1a\u2013c and 2a\u2013c, respectively. The experimental band positions of MO4H6 and M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) are listed in Tables S1 and S2,\u2020 respectively. As shown in Fig. 1a\u2013c, the experimental IR spectrum of each MO4H6 complex comprises three groups of bands (labeled bands A, B, and C). B and A in the IR spectra of ScO4H6, YO4H6, and LaO4H6 are centered at 3398, 3104, and 2952 cm\n\u22121, respectively, indicating redshi down through the group 3 metal of the periodic table. The B bands in the IR spectrum of ScO4H6, YO4H6, and LaO4H6 are observed at 3694, 3704, and 3722 cm\u22121, respectively, showing a slight blueshi down through the group 3 metal of the periodic table. B and C in the IR spectra of ScO4H6, YO4H6, and LaO4H6 are located at 3786, 3784, and 3748 cm\u22121, respectively, showing a slight redshi down through the group 3 metals of the periodic table. Similar spectral features were observed for M2O6H7 (labeled bands a, b, and c), except for the absence of band a in Sc2O6H7.\nTo understand the experimental IR spectra and identify the structures of MO4H6 and M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) complexes, quantum chemical calculations were carried out at the TPSSh/ def2-TZVP level of theory. The structures of the identied isomers and the comparison of their calculated IR spectra with the experimental ones are shown in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively. The structures of other low-lying isomers and the comparison of their calculated IR spectra with the experimental ones are illustrated in Fig. S2 and S3,\u2020 respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. S2,\u2020 the most stable isomer of ScO4H6 (labeled 1A) has a Sc(OH)2(H2O)2 structure with a doublet electronic ground state, in which the scandium hydroxide Sc(OH)2 are solvated with two water molecules. The 1B isomer has a HcSc(OH)3(H2O) structure with the involvement of a hydrogen radical, as evidenced by the calculated Mulliken spin densities [H(0), 0.72; Sc(0), 0.10] (for the labeling of the atoms, see Table S1\u2020). The 1B isomer lies slightly higher in energy than the 1A isomer by 2.6 kcal mol\u22121.

However, the calculated IR spectrum of the isomer 1A (Fig. S1b\u2020) consists of the bands at 2693 and 2955 cm\u22121, corresponding to the hydrogen-bonded OH stretching modes of the solvated water molecules, which are not observed experimentally. Analogously, the presence of isomer 1C can be ruled out based on the calculated band at 2640 cm\u22121. Similar results are also obtained for the YO4H6 and LaO4H6 complexes (Fig. S2 and Table S1\u2020). As summarized in Fig. 1, the agreement of the simulated IR spectra of the 1B, 1II, and 1ii isomers with the experimental spectra of ScO4H6, YO4H6, and LaO4H6 is reasonable to identify the presence of HcM(OH)3(H2O) (M = Sc, Y, La) structures.\nFor Sc2O6H7, the most stable isomer (labeled 2A) has a Sc2(m2-OH)2(h 1-OH)3(h 1-OH2) structure with a doublet electronic ground state (Fig. S3d\u2020), in which one water molecule forms one weakly bond with one scandium hydroxide and one hydrogen-bond with the hydroxyl group of another scandium hydroxide. The 2B isomer has a similar structure and lies only 0.1 kcal mol\u22121 above 2A, in which one water molecule forms one weak bond with one scandium hydroxide and one hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of the same scandium hydroxide. In the calculated IR spectrum of isomer 2A (Fig. S3 and Table S2\u2020), the band at 3675 cm\u22121 is attributed to the stretching mode of the O(6)H(6) group, which is consistent with the experimental band b (3662 cm\u22121); the stretching modes of the O(n)H(n) (n = 1\u20135) groups is calculated to 3806, 3804, 3778, 3770, and 3751 cm\u22121, respectively, which are observed in the experimental spectrum at 3810, 3788, and 3742 cm\u22121 (band c). The absence of stretching mode of the O(6)H(7) group (2474 cm\u22121) (Table S2\u2020) could be rationalized that the photon energy of the IR laser in this wavelength region is not sufficient to cause the vibrational predissociation of Sc2O6H7. In the calculated IR spectrum of the isomer 2B (Fig. S3g\u2020), the hydrogen-bonded OH stretching mode of the solvated water molecule is predicted at 3275 cm\u22121, which is not observed in the experimental spectrum. As summarized in Fig. 2, the agreement of the simulated IR spectra of the 2A, 2I, and 2i isomers with the experimental spectra is reasonable to conrm the M2(m2-OH)2(h 1-OH)3(h 1-OH2) (M = Sc, Y, La) structures responsible for Sc2O6H7, Y2O6H7, and La2O6H7.\nConsidering that the reactions in the laver\u2013vaporization processes are quite intricate and their intermediates are very difficult to characterize experimentally, quantum chemical calculations were performed to explore the possible reaction mechanisms. Due to the similarities in the IR spectra and structures of MO4H6 and M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) complexes, we used ScO4H6 and Sc2O6H7 as examples to investigate the possible formation pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Sc + H2O / Sc(H2O) reaction is more favorable than the dimerization of Sc atoms.31 As shown in Fig. S1,\u2020 the mononuclear complexes (i.e., Sc, ScO, HScO, Sc(OH)2, and HcSc(OH)3) were observed in the mass spectrum, for which the formation mechanisms have been reported previously.20,23,25,30\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nConsequently, we will mainly discuss the dominant pathways that begin from the mononuclear complexes.\nThe potential energy proles for the formation of ScO4H6 (isomer 1B) initiated by the reaction of ScO with H2O are shown in Fig. 3. ScO reacts with the rst water molecule to form a solvation structure ScO(H2O), which is predicted to be exothermic by 18.5 kcal mol\u22121 at the TPSSh/def2-TZVP level of theory. The ScO(H2O) / Sc(OH)2 isomerization is highly exothermic by 41.3 kcal mol\u22121 via a transition state (TS1) with a very small barrier of 1.1 kcal mol\u22121. The addition of H2O to Sc(OH)2 forms Sc(OH)2(H2O), which could undergo isomerization to HcSc(OH)3. TS2 lies below the energy of Sc(OH)2 + H2O reactants by 14.4 kcal mol\u22121. Sc(OH)2 + H2O / HcSc(OH)3 overall reaction is exothermic by 16.1 kcal mol\u22121 and is thus thermodynamically favorable. The mechanism for kinetically trapping HcSc(OH)3 by the so helium expansion has been recently discussed in detail.30 The HcSc(OH)3 complex combines with the water molecule to form the target product ScO4H6 (HcSc(OH)3(H2O), isomer 1B), which is exothermic by 16.3 kcal mol\u22121.\nFig. 4 shows the potential energy proles for the formation of Sc2O6H7 (isomer 2A) initiated from the mononuclear nonradical complexes. The ScO + HScO / HSc2O2 reaction is predicted to be extremely exothermic at 106.1 kcal mol\u22121. The most stable isomer of HSc2O2 has a Sc2(m2-O)2(h\n1-H) structure, which combines with one water molecule to form IM1 and IM2. IM1 can be isomerized to IM5 via TS4. The calculated energy of TS4 is lower than that of IM1, which is due to the zero-point energy correction.37\u201339 This indicates that the energy barrier for the IM1 / IM5 isomerization is very low.

Similarly, the reaction path of IM2 / TS3 / IM3 / TS5 / IM4 / IM6 is also both thermodynamically and kinetically facile in the gas phase. IM3 could also be generated by the combination of Sc(OH)2 and HScO, which is predicted to be highly exothermic by 83.8 kcal mol\u22121. The addition of H2O to IM6 forms IM7, which is exothermic by 16.8 kcal mol\u22121. IM7 undergoes isomerization to the most stable hydroxyl structure IM8 via TS6 with a tiny barrier of 0.9 kcal mol\u22121. IM8 reacts with the second water molecule to form IM9, which is exothermic by 20.7 kcal mol\u22121. IM9 can be isomerized to an all-hydroxyl structure IM10 via TS7 with a barrier of 8.3 kcal mol\u22121. The addition of the third water molecule to IM10 generates the target product Sc2O6H7 (isomer 2A), which is exothermic by 14.6 kcal mol\u22121.\nConsidering that HcSc(OH)3 and OH radicals are also generated in the laser\u2013vaporization process,30,34 Sc2O6H7 might also be formed via reactions (1) and (2).\nHcSc(OH)3 + Sc / Sc2O3H4 (1)\nSc2O3H4 + 3OH / Sc2O6H7 (2)\n6630 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 6626\u20136634\nAccordingly, the potential energy proles for the formation of Sc2O6H7 initiated from the mononuclear radical complexes are shown in Fig. 5. HcSc(OH)3 reacts with the Sc atom to produce the binuclear complex IM11; the reaction is predicted to be highly exothermic by 97.3 kcal mol\u22121. IM11 can be isomerized to IM12 via TS8 with a small barrier of 1.6 kcal mol\u22121. The reaction of IM12 with the rst, second, and third OH radicals is predicted to be extremely exothermic by 128.4, 122.2, and 51.3 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. The subsequent isomerization from IM15 to isomer 2B is exothermic by 1.2 kcal mol\u22121 via TS9 with a barrier of 9.3 kcal mol\u22121. Isomer 2B can be further isomerized to form the most stable isomer 2A via TS10 with a small barrier of 3.8 kcal mol\u22121. Consequently, the formation of isomer 2A is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase, which is consistent with the experimental observation.\nThe reaction mechanisms of rare-earth metals with water molecules can be inferred from the aforementioned formation pathways of ScO4H6 and Sc2O6H7. Mononuclear rare-earth metal oxide (MO (M = Sc, Y, La)) could induce the decomposition of water molecules until the hydrogen-radical adduct HcM(OH)3 was generated. The addition of the subsequent water molecule forms the solvated complex HcM(OH)3(H2O).

The additional water molecule forms a coordination bond with metals and a delocalized hydrogen-bond with the hydroxyl group.\nThe evolution mechanism from mononuclear to binuclear rare-earth metal complexes might be summarized as follows. The addition of water to HcM(OH)3 forms HcM(OH)3(H2O), in which the radical feature is retained. However, upon the addition of the Sc atom to MO3H4 to produce binuclear complex M2O3H4 (labeled IM11 in Fig. 5), the hydrogen radical rst binds to the two metals and then undergoes isomerization to a hydride structure (labeled IM12 in Fig. 5). During the reactions of IM12 with the rst two OH radicals, the hydride structures remain. The subsequent reaction with the third OH radical results in the formation of M2O6H7, in which the hydrogen atom in the metal hydride unit is transformed into one hydrogen bond. Therefore, during the MO3H4 / M2O6H7 processes, the active hydrogen atom undergoes the evolution of the hydrogen radical/ bridging hydrogen/metal hydride/ hydrogen bond, indicative of reduced reactivity.\nThe mononuclear complexes MO4H6 (M = Sc, Y, La) with an M(OH)3 plane as its basic skeleton, are highly relevant to the ultrathin 2D rare-earth nanomaterials of layered rare-earth hydroxides M(OH)3$nH2O,15,17 and the coordination bonding fashion of water with M(OH)3 is similar to that of the reported\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nrare-earth single-atom catalysis system.9,10 The hydrogen radical is the key intermediate in a variety of processes (i.e., catalysis, molecular hydrogen production, and new particle formation), but it is difficult to detect because of its high reactivity and a very short lifetime. In this work, the feature of hydrogen radicals in the rare-earth single-atom complexes HcM(OH)3(H2O) is fortunately observed under the presence of additional water, which would have important implications for understanding the solvation effects of the catalysts and would suggest that the ultrathin 2D rare-earth nanomaterials of layered rareearth hydroxides have the potential to trap hydrogen radicals and participate in more chemical processes.\nThe binuclear complexes M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) contain an M2(m2-O)2 unit, which is reminiscent of the actual rare-earth metal oxide catalysts. In the formation of M2O6H7 from MO3H4, three bonding modes of hydrogen atoms are involved with the reactivity order of h1-H > m2-OH > h\n1-OH. Such reduced reactivity of hydrogen atoms might contribute to reducing the activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction of the hydrogen storage materials.4\u20136 These three types of hydrogen atoms were also observed in the process of ethylene/acetylene hydrogenation catalyzed by CeO2,14 and the reactivity sequence was consistent with our results. The deactivation of the CeO2 catalyst has been rationalized by the overproduction with the formation of strongly bound M\u2013OH groups that are\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 6626\u20136634 | 6631\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

            "text": "In this work, MO4H6 and M2O6H7 (M = Sc, Y, La) complexes were prepared by a laser\u2013vaporization supersonic expansion cluster source. Infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR-VUV) spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations indicates that the MO4H6 and M2O6H7 complexes have the HcM(OH)3(H2O) and M2(m2-OH)2(h 1-OH)3(h 1-OH2) structures, respectively. The joint experimental and theoretical results reveal that the formation of HcM(OH)3(H2O) and M2(m2-OH)2(h 1-OH)3(h 1-OH2) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. The feature of hydrogen radicals in the mononuclear complexes HcM(OH)3(H2O) is found to be retained under the presence of additional water. The addition of a metal atom to HcM(OH)3 and subsequent combination with water produces the binuclear complex M2(m2-OH)2(h 1-OH)3(h 1-OH2), by which the reactivity of active hydrogen is reduced during the evolution of hydrogen radical / bridging hydrogen / metal hydride / hydrogen bond. The present experimental technique has the potential for size-selected infrared spectroscopic studies on a large variety of reactions between small molecules and neutral clusters, which will help to understand the structure\u2013reactivity relationship of catalysts with isolated metal atoms/clusters dispersed on supports."
