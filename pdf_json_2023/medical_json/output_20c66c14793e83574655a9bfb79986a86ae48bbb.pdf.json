            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are chronic respiratory conditions, with increasing global prevalence.[1, 2] Currently, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) [3] recommend the use of inhaled therapies such as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), alone or in combination with long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) as maintenance treatment for the majority of COPD patients.[3]\nThree types of inhalation devices can be used to administer LAMA and LAMA/LABA therapy: pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs).[4] The carbon footprint, expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), of these three devices differs, with pMDIs being higher than DPIs or SMIs due to use of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellants. The use of HFC is currently being phased down under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, 2016.[5] This stimulus to switch away from HFC pMDIs has prompted innovation of inhaler design, including reusable inhalers and SMIs, with potential to further reduce the carbon footprint.[6] Several global and regional organisations and governments have started to design and implement measures to reduce emissions in the healthcare sector, including the Netherlands [7] and the NHS in the United Kingdom (UK), as outlined in its Long Term Plan, 2019.[8] Furthermore, British Thoracic Society\u2019s national guidance has recommended offering patients low carbon alternatives to pMDI, where clinically appropriate.[9]\nTo exemplify the high carbon footprint of pMDIs, it was estimated that using 50% of inhaler devices with a low carbon footprint, such as DPIs, would save the equivalent of 288,000 tonnes of CO2e every year, equivalent to taking more than 61,000 cars off the road.[10] No such comparison has been made regarding the carbon footprint of switching pMDIs or DPIs for SMIs, with one study grouping DPIs and SMIs together for analysis.[11] As the carbon footprint is different for every inhaler, robust quantification is needed to assess the current impact of the three types of inhaler devices. This study aimed to compare the carbon footprint, measured in terms of CO2e emissions, of switching the COPD patient population to the SMI, Respimat Reusable. The main analysis focused on switching within the same therapeutic class, and additional scenarios were conducted to complement the main analysis."

Inclusion criteria included full text studies published from the year 2000 onwards reporting data on carbon footprint and greenhouse gases, environmental or global warming impact of DPIs, pMDIs, or SMIs for use in COPD, asthma, or other respiratory diseases. Where necessary, outcomes were converted to annual CO2e based on recommended administration frequency. Hand searching of relevant websites and databases (Google Scholar, National Health Service (NHS), United Nations, World Health Organization, and the European Union) was also conducted for carbon emissions, carbon footprint, and climate change of DPIs or pMDIs, along with data on inhalers and sustainable prescribing.\nAt the time of the literature review, published estimates on carbon footprint were available for Ellipta, Breezhaler, Accuhaler, Nexthaler, Evohaler, Foster, and Flutiform (Table 1). The carbon footprint of Respimat Reusable has been previously reported by H\u00e4nsel et al. (2019).[14] Spiolto Respimat Reusable and Spiriva Respimat Reusable have equivalent carbon footprints.\nTo estimate the carbon footprint of inhalers with no available data, an average, by inhaler type, was taken between the available estimates and attributed to those inhalers (Table 2). As previously reported by Janson et al. (2020),[15] and H\u00e4nsel et al. (2019) [14], 17% of total carbon footprint was attributed to refill based on the proportion of active pharmaceutical ingredients and distribution. A weighted average by therapeutic class/inhaler class was calculated based on the units sold and the associated carbon footprint.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The objective of this study was to assess the carbon footprint of adopting SMIs (Respimat Reusable) across 13 countries in Europe and the US instead of DPIs and pMDIs. This study shows that Respimat Reusable offers considerable environmental benefits in terms of decreased CO2e emissions when replacing disposable and reusable DPIs and pMDIs of the same therapeutic class. These data extend the previous findings of H\u00e4nsel et al. (2019),[14], Orts\u00e4ter et al. (2019),[16] Janson et al. (2020),[15], and Wachtel et al. (2020),[17] which show the environmental benefits of switching from pMDIs to devices with a lower carbon footprint and a reusable option. In a study by Pernigotti et al (2021), replacing pMDIs with DPIs/SMIs (classed as a single group), resulted in a 68% reduction in the carbon footprint across the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Spain when 80% of pMDIs were substituted with DPI or SMIs by 2030.[11] While Pernigotti et al (2021),[11] assessed a total replacement of pMDIs, our study focused on the replacement of pMDIs and DPIs within the same therapeutic class, making the findings applicable in clinical practice. Over five years, replacing alternative LAMA DPIs and pMDIs with Spiriva Respimat Reusable saved 0.02 mega tonnes of CO2e, equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 2,648 EU citizens. Similarly, replacing alternative LAMA/LABA DPIs and pMDIs with Spiolto Respimat Reusable saved 0.06 mega tonnes of CO2e, equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 9,380 EU citizens. These data show that substantial CO2e savings can be made with the clinically relevant replacement of inhaler devices.\nBased on data from this study, the countries that would benefit most from implementing changes to inhaler use based on CO2e emissions are the UK, US, and Germany, which is aligned with these countries having the highest prevalence of COPD and the highest ratio of pMDI prescribed. Environmental pressures have prompted governments to introduce targets to reduce the use of inhalers with a high carbon footprint, including the UK Government\u2019s Environmental Audit Committee setting the NHS the challenge of reducing the carbon footprint of inhaler use by 50% before 2028.[18] Consequently, NICE (UK) published a Patient Decision Aid on asthma inhalers in 2019 that highlights carbon footprint as a factor in inhaler choice, favouring a switch to DPIs or reusable SMIs.[19] In the UK, pMDIs account for a higher proportion of inhaler use (>50%) compared with other European countries and the US (<50%), as shown by both the market shares used in this study and the high carbon footprint of pMDIs, as shown in scenario analyses performed. Prescribing data from England show that the usage of pMDIs has remained consistent at around 55% since 2021 [20]. Earlier estimates of pMDI use in the UK were 70% in 2011,[21] suggesting that implementation of these NHS policies and efforts to limit CO2 are working. NHS England are reported to be on track to hit the first year carbon reduction target, though what impact pMDI replacement played in this success is unclear.[22] While successes in the UK have been gained, this continued variation in pMDI prescribing practices between the UK and other countries suggests that there is still room for a reduction in the use of pMDI in the UK. Nonetheless, the implementation of the UK-like policies elsewhere could potentially reduce carbon footprint in the healthcare sector overall.\nThis study was a theoretical exercise, and while it is a clinically relevant replacement, an indiscriminate replacement of the entire patient population using LAMA or LAMA/LABA DPIs and pMDIs to Respimat Reusable is not feasible as not all patients would be eligible. In our analyses of additional scenarios, we also analysed the carbon footprint of switching to LAMA/LABA administered by SMI from ICS/LABA or ICS/LABA/LAMA therapy. As with the main analyses, the scenario analyses present an ideal scenario where all patients are eligible to switch, and in clinical practice some patients will benefit from ICS. Sensitivity analysis showed that when 50% of the population in each scenario were switched to Respimat Reusable, there was a minimum of a 47.1% decrease in carbon footprint after switch. Switching all COPD patients to SMIs is not clinically appropriate as some COPD\npatients, those with high blood eosinophils and a history of exacerbations,[3] are recommended to be treated with ICS, which is not available in an SMI. Similarly, there are limited asthma maintenance treatments available in SMI. However, several studies have shown that overuse of ICS-containing treatment in COPD is common [23, 24] and studies have shown that withdrawal of ICS in many COPD patients can be done without negative clinical consequences.[25, 26] Our results show that the benefits of replacing ICS-containing therapy with LAMA/LABA in COPD patients inappropriately treated with ICS could be two-fold, reducing the risk of side-effects like pneumonia, alongside a reduced carbon footprint.\nNevertheless, the use of DPI and pMDI will continue based on clinical need and as per ERS recommendations, patients should not be switched between devices purely for environmental reasons.[27] It is also important to note that some DPI devices assessed in the environmental impact model are single dose reusable DPIs, with similar carbon footprints to Respimat Reusable and provide comparable environmental benefits. The GOLD group advocate choosing a tailored and personalised approach in clinical practice and choosing the most appropriate inhaler to meet individual patient needs.[3] When considering a switch for clinical need, patient engagement and preference is essential. Durability, ergonomics and ease of use are attributes that influence patient satisfaction and outcome and should be criterion to factor into switching.[4, 28, 29] Reusability and carbon footprint of the device are strong drivers of patient preference,[30, 31] and when patients are made aware of the carbon footprint of their inhalers, many are willing to try a more environmentally friendly device.[32] Patient education of carbon footprint must also be coupled with that of education of clinicians, where it has been shown that few understand the carbon footprint of devices and the presence or absence of propellants.[33] Ultimately, the greenest inhaler is a clinically appropriate device, that gives patients clinical benefit.[34]"

            "heading": "Strengths and limitations",
            "text": "A key strength of this study is that it evaluated several scenarios across 13 different countries using up-to-date prescribing data. It spans across all therapeutic classes of inhaler used in COPD treatment. A key limitation to acknowledge is that the base case presents an optimistic scenario, in which all patients are switched to a reusable SMI with optimal use of devices (2 inhalers and 12 refills per patient per annum). In the USA, where Respimat is not available in a reusable format, switching all LAMA and all LAMA-LABA patients to Respimat would still save 28,857 tonnes of CO2e, mainly due to the current significant use of LAMA-LABA pMDI. Switching inhaler types depends on the clinical need of patients, preferences for inhaler technique, and the availability of the inhaled drugs as an SMI. For this reason, fewer patients will be eligible to switch to SMI, and the maximum hypothetical carbon footprint reduction with switching to SMI is actually lower. However, both the eligibility and optimal use of devices have been accounted for in a sensitivity analysis, in which the eligible population was reduced to 50% and the number of devices were increased from two to six and 12. Second, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated uncertainty around the magnitude of the carbon footprint due to several assumptions. For example, if the reuse of inhalers (refill ratios) is overestimated, then potential CO2e reduction when switching from a disposable to a reusable device will be lower than reported. However, overall, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the results showing the reduction in carbon footprint when replacing DPIs and pMDIs with SMIs. Third, our analysis is based on carbon footprint data published at the time the environmental impact model was built. In this respect, the model does not consider any newer or forthcoming devices such as pMDIs with low global warming potential or new carbon footprint data published after conducting the literature review, for example for DPIs such as Breezhaler [35] or Easyhaler.[36] Equally, should current market shares change, for example, an increase in use of LAMA-LABA pMDI,\nthen the switch to Respimat would provide additional carbon footprint savings. While SABAs were also not included in the model, their availability in Respimat device is limited to very few countries. Any switch from SABA pMDIs to Respimat device may provide further environmental savings. Lastly, the analysed prescribing data does not distinguish between COPD and asthma."
