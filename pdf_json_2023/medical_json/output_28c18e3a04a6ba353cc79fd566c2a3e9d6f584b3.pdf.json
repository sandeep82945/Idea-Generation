            "text": "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a procedure used to treat early gastric cancer and is currently widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, including early gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and colon cancer.1-5 ESD has a lower medical cost, complication rate, and recovery time than surgery. However, a great deal of experience is required to acquire a high skill level and the associated risk of procedure-related complications is high. The complications and prognosis of patients depend on the expertise and precision of the operator.6,7\nESD was developed in Japan. Most of the training process is based on the \u201cMaster-Apprentice process,\u201d in which trainees receive one-on-one, step-by-step training under the guidance of an expert. Nonetheless, this process has a disadvantage in that it is only possible in regions where ESD is actively implemented.\nCurrently, several tools including textbooks, online video media, simulators, and hands-on sessions are used for selfESD training outside Japan. These tools are helpful for learning about ESD procedures, although they have limitations. For example, aspects such as delicate endoscopic handling, injection, circumferential cutting, submucosal dissection, and handling of adverse events, such as bleeding and perforations, are more difficult to learn using these tools.8,9\nIn the past, animal models, such as ex vivo and in vivo porcine models, were commonly used to improve endoscopic handling; however, these methods also have several limitations.10,11 First, the preparation of animal models is expensive. Second, ESD training is only possible in animal operating rooms. Third, pigs have a thick stomach wall that contains a high volume of oil compared to that of humans; this makes it difficult for be-\nginners to perform ESD. Fourth, additional training is impossible if perforation occurs while performing ESD on a live pig. Fifth, ethical concerns and restrictions regarding reusability are inherent to this method. To overcome these limitations, an ESD simulator using artificial tissue was introduced, although lifting the submucosal layer is impossible with this method.12\nRecently, a new artificial ESD simulator, Endogel (Sunarrow, Tokyo, Japan), was developed for ESD/peroral endoscopic myotomy training.10,13 Endogel is a composite plate laminated with three types of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (PVA-H) sheets. Different types of PVA-H sheets with different elasticities can be laminated together to mimic the mucosa and submucosa; these can then be used in simulated procedures, such as mucosal incision, submucosal dissection, and muscle layer myotomy.13 There are no restrictions on where ESD can be administered. However, Endogel does have some limitations. First, it is quite expensive and is unavailable in some countries. Second, because the target lesion can\u2019t be adjusted, the trainee can\u2019t practice gastric ESD with the lesions in various locations. In this study, a new ESD simulator was developed and evaluated for its use by beginners for achieving a high level of technical experience before performing the procedure in patients."

This new simulator is composed of three units: the esophagus unit for endoscopic insertion, the gastric wall unit for injection and cutting, and the electric unit for radiofrequency current conduction and return function (Fig. 1). The esophagus unit is produced using stereolithography three-dimensional printing (OMG SLA 660 3D printer; Xiamen Zhisen Electro. Equip.) and a silicone molding technique (EchoFlex 0030; Smooth-On Inc.).14 The gastric wall unit is produced using a three-layered PVA-H (PVA 98-98.8% hydrolyzed, MW 146,000-186,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) sheet. All materials used in the gastric wall units were edible grade or harmless to the human body. The gastric wall unit was 17\u00d712\u00d71.7 cm in size and composed of a three-layered PVA-H sheet. The first, second, and third layers were the mucosal, submucosal, and proper muscle layers, respectively. The PVA-H layers were polymerized by one to two freeze-thaw cycles. The final properties of the materials and thickness of each layer were optimized based on the thickness of the mucosal layer and incision of the submucosal layer. The electric unit had dual electrodes (KODE plate; KODE Medical Ind.) connected to the gastric wall unit that conducted the electric current (Fig. 1)."

            "text": "Two ESD simulators, an existing simulator (Endogel) and a new simulator (Asan ESD simulator; Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea), were evaluated for their performance by experts (Figs. 1, 2). The primary outcome was suitability for ESD training, which was measured by an expert group comprising staff from three different hospitals. After using the ESD simulator, the expert group evaluated it with a score table using a 7-point Likert scale (Table 1). The highest score reflected greater realism compared to the human gastric ESD. For example, a 7-point Likert scale for agreement will include as the following options: strongly disagree, disagree, somewhat disagree, either\nagree or disagree, somewhat agree, agree, and strongly disagree (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=somewhat disagree; 4=either agree or disagree; 5=somewhat agree; 6=agree; 7=strongly agree). The score table covered the following topics: (1) ESD of the target lesion, (2) limitations, (3) complications, and (4) mechanical and electrical performance (Table 1). \u201cMarking\u201d means circumscribe the limits of the target lesion using a dual knife (KD-655Q; Olympus). \u201cSubmucosal injection\u201d refers to the injection of fluid into the submucosal layer around a lesion to separate it from the muscle layer. \u201cMucosal incision\u201d means cutting the mucosa surrounding the lesion using a dual knife and an IT knife (KD-611L; Olympus) to obtain a circumferential incision with submucosal exposure. \u201cSubmucosal dissection\u201d refers to cutting of the submucosal layer. \u201cComplete resection\u201d means the resection of target lesion without tearing. Piecemeal resection does not include \u201ccomplete resection\u201d. \u201cVisibility after submucosal injection\u201d refers to the submucosal layer under the dissected mucosal layer. \u201cCurling of the dissected lesion\u201d refers to the curled mucosal lesion after submucosal dissection. \u201cPerforation occurred in ESD\u201d indicates perforation similar to that which occurs during ESD. \u201cSufficient size for ESD training\u201d means the test area for ESD training; the larger the size of the PVA-H, the greater the opportunities for gastric ESD being implemented by trainees. \u201cConnectivity of the electrosurgical unit (ESU)\u201d means the electric current from the ESU to the target area. \u201cRealism of wall layer\u201d refers to the suitability of the construction of the simulator\u2019s layers. The names of each layer are shown in Fig 1. A-3. Both simulators consisted of four layers; cutting of the third layer and exposure of the fourth layer (the serosa layer) was regarded as a perforation. Hence, when the sky-blue sponge was visible, it is considered a perforation.\nThe secondary outcomes were the learning curves when using the new ESD simulator, which were measured by the trainee group in the following aspects: (1) complete resection and (2) perforation, where \u201ccomplete resection\u201d meant removal of the target lesion completely without tearing, and \u201cperforation\u201d meant the exposed muscle layer. Each trainee attempted ESD three times per session, for a total of five sessions. The results of three successful trails per session were recorded for each trainee. The total number of complete resections and perforations per session was recorded."

The target lesions were 2-cm circular lesions, and a maximum of nine lesions could be made on the PVA-H sheet. The ESU settings were as follows: monopolar, Endocut Q (max 770 Vp) with effect 1, duration 3 (10 ms), and interval 3 (720 ms)."

An IT knife 2 and a dual knife were used for circumferential incision of the mucosal lesion and submucosal dissection.\nESD requires an in-depth understanding of endoscopic evaluation of lesions and high-level endoscopic skills. In this study, experts provided training for the operation, precautions related\nto the procedure, and demonstrated the correct usage of the ESD simulator before trainees used the equipment and procedure and gave feedback to the trainees both during and after every session. First, ESD trainees were exposed to ESD-related books and video media. While observing the procedures performed by experts, they were educated on precautions and equipment usage. The ESD simulator practice was always followed with feedback from the expert relating to problems during the procedure. Overall, trainees were educated on the theory for one month, while the procedure was observed for three months; an additional month of training was required to complete five sessions.

When the submucosal solution was excessively injected, the visibility was unsatisfactory (4 [4\u20135] vs. 4.5 [4\u20135], p=0.807) and the dissected lesion was not curled (3 [3\u20134] vs. 2.5 [2\u20133], p=0.005). As the PVA-H sheet does not curl, dissection was performed by lifting the dissected lesion with an endoscopic cap.\nThe mechanical performances of both simulators were also favorable. The sizes of the ESD sheets required by the simulators were suitable for practice (6 [5.8\u20136] vs. 5 [4\u20135], p=0.005). When the submucosal solution was not injected, it was possible to perform ESD on nine practice lesions; when the submucosal solution was injected, it was only possible to perform ESD on three lesions. There was no malfunction of the electrical device during any of the procedures. The three-layered PVA-H sheet was scored as having satisfactory quality for ESD practice (6\n[5.8\u20136] vs. 5 [4.8\u20136], p=0.085). The ESU functioned well in terms of electrical connectivity (7 [7\u20137] vs. 7 [6.8\u20137], p=0.554).\nThe new simulator was able to access the lesion through the esophageal unit and change the location of the lesion. In cases of perforation, lesion detection and endoscopic clipping were also possible."

To measure the learning curves, the successful complete resection and perforation rates were counted. The complete resection rate improved after 3 sessions (9 procedures), and the perforation rate decreased after 4 sessions (12 procedures) of ESD training (Fig. 3, Table 2)."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We developed a new ESD simulator that is compatible with any endoscopic equipment. The ESD experts in our study approved its suitability for training and its potential to improve patient safety. The trainees\u2019 ESD skill levels improved as the number of training sessions increased.\nESD is an effective treatment option for various gastrointestinal diseases. Nonetheless, a great deal of time and experience are required to minimize ESD-related complications, such as bleeding and perforation. Various ESD simulators have been introduced to provide ESD-related training. Live porcine models are the most commonly used, and have been shown to accelerate the learning curve for gastric ESD training.15 Nevertheless, there are many limitations with ESD training using porcine\nmodels. Recently, a PVA-H-based ESD simulator, Endogel, was introduced, and its demand has been increasing despite its limitations.13\nThe new PVA-H-based ESD simulator has the following merits. First, any conventional endoscopic equipment is fully compatible with it. Second, its esophageal unit is more effective for practicing gastric ESD. Third, because the target lesion can be adjusted, the trainee can practice gastric ESD with the lesions in various locations. Owing to the considerable width of the ESD sheet, the trainee can create multiple lesions and perform gastric ESD several times. Fourth, the gastric ESD process can be viewed directly as well as through a monitor, which can help improve the proficiency of the practitioner. Fifth, the process of mucosal lifting and cutting in the simulator closely resembled that in human gastric ESD. Sixth, the amount of foam generated from the PVA-H sheets does not interfere with the procedure. Seventh, there is no danger of electric circuit connections and shock problems related to operator safety for the trainee during ESD. Eighth, compared with Endogel, the new simulator is 50% cheaper and readily available in all countries. Ninth, compared to animal models and conventional simulators, the new gastric ESD simulator may be a favorable alternative due to its reasonable performance, greater availability, and lower price.\nThe PVA-H-based simulator has the following limitations. First, it can only simulate ESD with flat lesions. Second, upon excessive submucosal injection, the injected solution causes visual disturbance, making it difficult to dissect the incised lesion. Therefore, skipping submucosal injection is recommended. For ESDs involving submucosal injection, it is suitable for performing three ESDs. If submucosal injection is omitted, it becomes\nsuitable for performing nine ESDs. Nine ESDs appeared to be appropriate for simple training purposes, but not for research use (Fig. 2D). In future multi-center studies, it would be beneficial to consider ESD for nine lesions to reduce costs. Third, because the PVA-H sheet contained moisture, it had to be sealed and refrigerated. Fourth, it was difficult to reuse the PVA-H sheets. Fifth, sufficient ventilation was required because of the fumes emitted by the dissection sheet. Sixth, as the PVA-H sheet is not curled like the gastric wall, a cap must be attached to the end of the endoscope during practice. Seventh, although ESD simulators can help beginners begin performing and become proficient with the procedure, their role is limited, as they cannot train beginners how to deal with complications such as bleeding and perforation, which can occur in actual clinical settings.\nThe results of the current study should be interpreted in light of some limitations. First, a selection bias could have been present because of the small number of participants. Second, it is difficult to practice ESD for lesions located on a curved surface using the ESD simulator, as the ESD sheet is only made with a flat surface. Third, there could be bias and subjectivity in the evaluation because the scoring system was constructed using questionnaires. However, various evaluation indices and expert evaluators from other centers were employed to compensate for these limitations. For future research, it would be beneficial to conduct a multi-center study.\nIn conclusions, the new ESD simulator has several advantages such as its improved realism and affordability. We believe that this new ESD simulator will help improve practitioners\u2019 skills and ultimately improve patient safety and prognosis."
