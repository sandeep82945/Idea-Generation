    "abstractText": "The brain is composed of networks of interacting brain regions that support higher order cognition. For instance, a posterior medial (PM) network appears to support recollection and other forms of episodic construction. Past research has focused largely on the roles of individual brain regions in recollection or on their mutual engagement as part of an integrated network. Yet the relationship between these regionand network-level contributions remains poorly understood. Here we applied multilevel structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the functional organization of the PM network and its relationship to episodic memory outcomes. We evaluated two aspects of functional heterogeneity in the PM network: first, the organization of individual regions into subnetworks, and second, the presence of regionally-specific contributions while accounting for network-level effects. The results suggest that the PM network is composed of ventral and dorsal subnetworks, with the ventral subnetwork making a unique contribution to recollection, and that memory-related activity in individual regions is well accounted for by these network-level effects. These findings highlight the importance of considering both region and network levels of analysis when studying brain-behavior relationships. 2 .

For instance, a posterior medial (PM) network appears to support recollection and other forms of episodic construction. Past research has focused largely on the roles of individual brain regions in recollection or on their mutual engagement as part of an integrated network. Yet the relationship between these region- and network-level contributions remains poorly understood. Here we applied multilevel structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the functional organization of the PM network and its relationship to episodic memory outcomes. We evaluated two aspects of functional heterogeneity in the PM network: first, the organization of individual regions into subnetworks, and second, the presence of regionally-specific contributions while accounting for network-level effects. The results suggest that the PM network is composed of ventral and dorsal subnetworks, with the ventral subnetwork making a unique contribution to recollection, and that memory-related activity in individual regions is well accounted for by these network-level effects. These findings highlight the importance of considering both region and network levels of analysis when studying brain-behavior relationships."

            "text": "The brain is composed of networks of interacting brain regions, and the functioning of\nthese networks is crucial for higher-level cognition. One network of brain regions in particular, the posterior medial (PM) network, has consistently been linked to our ability to mentally construct events \u2013 recollecting past events, imaging future events, or constructing fictional scenarios (Buckner & DiNicola, 2019; Ritchey & Cooper, 2020). Exactly how this network supports episodic construction, however, remains unclear. Past research suggests that there are both regional and network level contributions of the PM network to episodic recollection. For instance, the hippocampus has long been known to be essential for episodic memory (e.g., Corkin, 2002; Riedel et al., 1999) and neuroimaging studies have shown that its activity is correlated with successful recollection (H. Kim, 2013; Spaniol et al., 2009). Looking beyond the hippocampus, however, it is apparent that many other brain regions are also involved in the recollection process (H. Kim, 2013; Rugg & Vilberg, 2013; Spaniol et al., 2009) including the angular gyrus (AG), precuneus (Prec), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These regions are robustly structurally and functionally connected with the hippocampus, leading to proposals that they form an integrated network (Buckner & DiNicola, 2019; Ranganath & Ritchey, 2012; Rugg & Vilberg, 2013). Here we use multilevel structural equation modeling to examine heterogeneity in the function of the PM network during an episodic retrieval task. Specifically, we investigated the subnetwork architecture of the PM network, as well as the contributions of individual PM regions to predicting memory outcomes.\nA great deal of research has focused on the roles of individual brain regions in supporting\nepisodic construction, delineating specific roles for the hippocampus, angular gyrus, and other"

            "text": "regions of the PM network (Ritchey & Cooper, 2020). The hippocampus, for example, is posited to support the binding together of contextual details in memory (Davachi, 2006; Diana et al., 2007; Eichenbaum et al., 2007) and is thought to perform a pattern completion function in which partial representations evoked by memory cues are \u201ccompleted\u201d by reinstating related information stored in memory (Horner et al., 2015; Marr, 1971; Norman & O\u2019Reilly, 2003). The angular gyrus, on the other hand, is thought to support the representation of multimodal episodic details brought to mind during recollection (Humphreys et al., 2021; Ramanan et al., 2018; Rugg & King, 2018). Some fMRI studies have directly tested for cognitive and temporal dissociations amongst the different regions of the PM network, finding evidence for functional specialization in the context of both episodic memory (Richter et al., 2016; Vilberg & Rugg, 2012, 2014) and imagination (Thakral et al., 2020). For example, Richter and colleagues (2016) used fMRI to identify brain activity that tracked the success, precision, and subjective vividness of episodic recollection. The authors modeled these measures jointly and found that the hippocampus uniquely tracked whether or not retrieval was successful, the angular gyrus uniquely tracked the precision of remembered information, and the precuneus uniquely tracked subjective memory vividness. These findings suggest that individual regions of the PM network make distinct contributions to the recollection process.\nThere is other evidence pointing to the importance of mutual engagement of these regions\nas part of an integrated network. Functional MRI studies have consistently observed increased neural activity across the PM network that is related to successful, vivid episodic recollection (H. Kim, 2013; Rugg & Vilberg, 2013; Spaniol et al., 2009). Moreover, functional connectivity within the PM network scales with the quality of recollection, including its subjective vividness"

Interestingly, another line of research suggests that the PM network may not act as a single homogeneous network but is instead composed of at least two, highly related subnetworks (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Barnett et al., 2021; Buckner & DiNicola, 2019; Cooper et al., 2021). For example, Cooper and colleagues (2021) examined the functional connectivity of the PM network regions while participants watched a short movie and, using data-driven community detection, showed that the PM network fractured into ventral and dorsal subnetworks that were differentially engaged during event perception. Barnett and colleagues (2021) used a similar data-driven approach to delineate multiple subnetworks in the PM network using resting-state data while also showing evidence that the regions of the different PM subnetworks represented similar information during a memory-guided decision making task. While these studies provide support for a subnetwork view of the PM network, it currently remains unclear whether these subnetworks are dissociable in their contributions to episodic recollection.\nPrior studies have made it clear that activity in regions of the PM network are related to\nmemory and to one another, but it remains unclear whether their contributions to memory are regionally specific or shared across the network. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a well suited tool for delineating regional and network-level contributions to behavior (Bolt et al., 2018). SEM allows for the capturing of a common, distributed, network-level contribution by estimating latent variables that captures the covariance amongst regions. Structural models can then estimate the statistical dependency between these latent variables and some behavioral variable while also estimating the regional-specific effect of each of the regions, statistically"

For instance, Bolt and colleagues (2018) used SEM to parse the unique contributions of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to cognitive control from those of the larger frontoparietal control network, showing that the unit of behavioral significance for many common cognitive control tasks was not the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but the shared contributions of the frontoparietal control network. In the context of episodic memory, we can use similar tools to estimate the specific regional contributions and common network contributions to episodic remembering within a single statistical model.\nTaken together, the literature suggests that the regions of the PM network perform\ndissociable yet interrelated functions and, as a result, make separable contributions to the recollection process. It remains unclear, however, exactly how to combine the findings from experiments taking region-focused approaches and network-focused approaches \u2014 highlighting the need for an approach that can simultaneously take into account network-wide and region-specific contributions to episodic retrieval. The present study uses SEM to model heterogeneity of function of the PM network. Specifically, we seek to model two key aspects of functional heterogeneity within the network: that larger networks fracture into related subnetworks and that regions of the networks make extra-network contributions to cognition."

To summarize, during scanned encoding phases participants were told that they would encounter 24 events consisting of a foreground object, a background scene, and an emotionally evocative sound. Participants were asked to remember each of the events in as much detail as possible, with explicit instructions to try and remember the color of the foreground object, the position of the object within the background scene, and the emotional valence of the sound. During scanned retrieval phases, participants were tested on their ability to reconstruct episode features from memory. At the beginning of each retrieval trial, participants were shown grayscale versions of the object stimuli from the previous encoding phase. During this time, participants were asked to bring to mind the cued episode in as much detail as possible. Immediately after this remember period, participants were asked to report the emotional valence of the episode\u2019s sound using a confidence scale.

Because of the nested structure, the variables that vary at the trial level have two sources of variation: one due to the difference between trials within subjects and the other due to the difference between subjects. For the neural data, the former represents where the BOLD response estimate (i.e., the t value) is relative to that subject\u2019s own average across all trials and the latter represents where each subject\u2019s average t value compared to other subjects' average t values. Our primary interest was in modeling within-subject, trial-to-trial variability. The between-subject variability in the neural data could represent meaningful differences in individual characteristics, but we did not have a-priori hypotheses about these individual differences in the present sample. Therefore, in the multilevel model for the neural data (see below), the between-subject model is specified only so that this source of variability is accounted for and therefore the statistical validity of the within-subject model is not compromised. For the behavioral data, the two sources of variation represent differences in overall memory quality on a trial-to-trial basis and differences in overall accuracy across trials on a subject-to-subject basis.\nAll modeling was performed using Mplus software version 8.2 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n,\n1997-2017). Models were determined to have acceptable levels of model fit if they displayed the following fit indices: root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) < .08, comparative fit index (CFI) > .95, and a standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR ) < .06 (Hu & Bentler,1 1999).

The ICC is a statistic that reflects the proportion of variance of a variable that can be attributed to individual differences amongst our subjects. Datasets that contain variables that have ICCs close to 0 will not see an additional benefit from multilevel modeling. In the null model, a saturated (i.e., a model that estimates parameters for all possible variances and covariances amongst variables) was specified for the within-subject covariance structure, and a null model in which all of the variances and covariances are constrained to be zero was specified for the between-subject covariance structure. If this model fails to satisfactorily fit the data, it suggests that the between-subject variances need to be allowed in the model and therefore calls for a two-level model.

Our measurement models indicated that a two factor model with latent factors representing ventral and dorsal subnetworks was the best model for our neural data, compared to a single-factor model grouping all PM regions together. Our structural models indicated that the contributions of individual regions of the PM network to memory quality are largely subsumed by subnetwork-level contributions, with the exception of the MPFC which made a unique, region-specific contribution to memory quality. Interestingly, the region-specific contribution of the MPFC was found to be negative, such that less MPFC activation (when controlling for subnetwork membership) was associated with more accurate recollections. Together, these results reveal new insights into how memory outcomes can be explained by a combination of network-level and region-specific factors.\nOur results support the presence of dissociable subnetworks within the PM network\n(Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Barnett et al., 2021; Buckner & DiNicola, 2019; Cooper et al., 2021).

The vPMN regions have also been shown to represent similar information during a memory-guided decision making task (Barnett et al., 2021). The vPMN is strongly related to episodic retrieval and autobiographical remembering, while portions of the dPMN have been linked to mentalizing about the mental states of others (Andrews-Hanna, Saxe, et al., 2014; Andrews-Hanna, Smallwood, et al., 2014). Additional evidence suggests that the vPMN may be particularly responsive to remembering and orienting towards space and the dPMN towards people (Peer et al., 2015; Silson et al., 2019). The fact that the vPMN in our dataset was uniquely related to memory quality could be reflective of our experimental design, which required the recollection of visual-spatial contextual details. In contrast, though the dPMN was strongly interconnected with the vPMN, it did not make an independent contribution to memory outcomes.\nWhen taking into consideration the covariance among PM network regions, we did not\nfind much evidence for independent, region-specific contributions, suggesting that the network-level effects could adequately account for their roles in predicting memory outcomes. Nevertheless, we had expected that there might be more region-specific effects, based on evidence that many of these regions play specialized roles in recollection. There are several reasons for why we did not see region-specific effects that we had hypothesized. One possibility is that there is something unique about our experimental paradigm that did not allow us to observe region-specific contributions. For example, the hippocampus may have emerged as making a region-specific contribution if we had operationalized our measure of memory success to more specifically target the hippocampus\u2019 proposed function. In our analysis, we estimated a"

The hippocampus\u2019 contribution to predicting this overall memory success measure may be subsumed by the network level contribution, but this may not be the case if the measure was more specific to successful pattern completion. Another possibility lies in how we modeled the neural response. In the current report, we modeled the neural response by assuming that it was transient, starting at the presentation of the memory cue during our \u2018remember\u2019 periods. Previous research suggests that the memory-related neural response in the angular gyrus is not transient with respect to the onset of recall, but is instead sustained throughout the duration of the recall period (Vilberg & Rugg, 2012, 2014). It is possible that modeling a sustained response throughout the recall period would allow for the identification of region-specific contributions of the angular gyrus. To test this possibility, all of our models were rerun using single trial estimates modeling the entire 4-second retrieval period. The key results of the current report remained unchanged in this model. Another possible explanation is that the identification of region-specific contributions within our framework assumes that the operations and representations of individual regions are not highly correlated. For example, it could be the case that the hippocampus and angular gyrus are, in reality, performing separable functions but those functions are so highly correlated in our task (e.g., because the functions of the angular gyrus are dependent on the output of the hippocampus) that they are well characterized by the network-level effect.\nThe one region in which we found a region-specific effect was the MPFC. The MPFC has\nbeen commonly described as part of the PM network (Ritchey & Cooper, 2020; Rugg & Vilberg, 2013) and is thought to support the formation and retrieval of schema-based representations"

            "text": "(Schlichting & Preston, 2015; van Kesteren et al., 2012). In the current study, however, the MPFC was weakly correlated with the quality with which events were remembered, but was still positively correlated with other regions of the network (see Table 1). In recognition of its general participation in the PM network, we included the MPFC in our models. Our results indicated that, after controlling for MPFC\u2019s participation in the dPMN subnetwork, the MPFC had a region-specific negative relationship with memory quality. However, we hesitate to draw strong conclusions regarding this finding. Previous reports suggest that MPFC activation is often positively correlated with measures of subjective memory success (H. Kim, 2016; McDermott et al., 2009; Spaniol et al., 2009). In the current study, because MPFC was only weakly correlated with memory quality, compared to the other regions in the analysis, the observed negative region-specific relationship might be explained by a statistical artifact. Specifically, the result seen here could be the result of a conditioning-on-a-collider bias, also known as Berkson\u2019s paradox (Berkson, 1946; L\u00fcbke et al., 2020). In this paradox, two variables that, in reality, do not have a statistical association are induced to have a negative association by statistically controlling for a variable that they both cause. In the current scenario, it could be the case that MPFC activation and Memory Quality are (at least in part) correlated with increases in PM network coactivation, but Memory Quality and MPFC activation are not related to one another.\nThe SEM methodology applied in the current report has a number of distinct advantages.\nFirstly, the current SEM approach has an advantage over previous reports of brain-behavior correlations in that it can simply and simultaneously capture the network-level and region-specific contributions of brain regions to behavioral phenomena. Second, the current report expanded upon previous deployments of this methodology (Bolt et al., 2018) by applying"

Thirdly, our dataset has a distinct advantage over previous studies of episodic remembering because it incorporates multiple measures of the quality of retrieval of an episode. This allowed us to model overall memory quality as a latent variable loading onto our measures of memory for 3 different features of each episode. By operationalizing memory success in this way, we were able to capture trial-to-trial variability in the joint remembering of event features. This is key, because holistic recollection is thought to be a key characteristic separating episodic remembering from other forms of memory (Tulving, 1983).\nOur SEM approach is related to, but distinct from, other methods for relating regions and\nnetworks to episodic remembering. For example, previous studies have used data-driven, hierarchical clustering methods to parcellate PMN subnetworks (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Barnett et al., 2021; Cooper et al., 2021), but did not relate trialwise coactivation within those subnetworks to episodic remembering. Another set of related methodological approaches is effective connectivity approaches. Specifically, some effective connectivity approaches also use SEM, but they use SEM to attempt to test hypothetical models of the underlying causal relations amongst regions of interest (e.g., McIntosh & Gonzalez-Lima, 1994). The latent variable modeling approach applied here, in contrast, does not attempt to make such causal inferences. Instead, our approach uses a latent variable to capture the coactivation seen within a network and relates this coactivation to a behavioral variable of interest. Lastly, the current approach is conceptually similar to partial least squares (PLS) analyses (Krishnan et al., 2011; McIntosh et"

            "text": "al., 1996; McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004). PLS involves maximizing the covariation between signal extracted from voxels of the brain and behavior, extracting latent variables reflecting distributed coactivation across the brain that explains variance in some behavior of interest. The SEM approach used in the current report is similar to PLS in that it also estimates a latent variable using the covariation of regional activation profiles, but has the advantage of being exclusively hypothesis driven and computationally and conceptually simpler. Many PLS applications (but not all Krishnan et al., 2011), in contrast, are data driven in nature. Additionally, PLS typically operates on all of the voxels collected during the course of an experiment, whereas the current approach operates on a set of hypothesized ROIs.\nThe current report makes an important contribution to the literature on the role of the PM\nnetwork in episodic remembering. It does, however, have its limitations. Our multilevel approach allowed us to model trialwise neural actictivation and behavioral profiles while controlling for individual differences. Multilevel SEM, however, also allows researchers to build models of individual differences in neural activation and behavior beyond simply controlling for this important source of variability. We did not attempt to model individual differences in the current report in large part because our dataset would be underpowered to do so. Future research could utilize larger sample sizes to model individual differences related to particular participant characteristics (see Bolt et al., 2018 for an SEM application to individual differences). Additionally, the current analysis was focused on a set of a-priori ROIs that were the same across individuals. Although this is a good starting point and is a strategy often adopted by researchers, recent research in high-precision functional mapping suggests that individually defined ROIs may provide more accurate insights into network organization and function"

Finally, although our memory measures captured multiple aspects of each episode (specifically, memory for multiple episodic features), they may not have adequately captured the functioning of core alliances within the PM network (Ritchey & Cooper, 2020).\nIn conclusion, the brain is simultaneously composed of large scale brain networks and\nindividual regions composing those networks. Here we demonstrate the importance of considering both network and regional levels of analysis when studying brain-behavior relationships, finding evidence in favor of a specific subnetwork organization of the PM network in its relation to episodic memory outcomes. Future work should continue to characterize the PM network by examining how these levels of analysis differentially support the various subprocesses and representations underlying episodic recollection."
