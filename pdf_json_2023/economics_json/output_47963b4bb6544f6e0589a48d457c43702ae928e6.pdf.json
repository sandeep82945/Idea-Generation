    "abstractText": "This paper proposes an integrated, comprehensive financial model that can provide startup capital to socially committed business ventures, such as social enterprises and Yunus Social Business (YSB), by using Islamic social funds (ISFs), Zakat (almsgiving), Waqf (endowments), Sadaqat (charity), and Qard Hasan (interest-free benevolent loans). The literature review method was adopted to explain this model\u2019s architecture, applications, implications, and viability. On the basis of logical reasoning, it concludes that ISFs can yield greater social wellbeing if utilised in SEs and YSB than in unconditional charity because both business models work for social betterment in entrepreneurial ways while remaining operationally self-reliant and economically sustainable. Additionally, ISFs can complement Yunus Social Business\u2019s zero-return investment approach to make it more robust towards social contributions. The implementation of the model orchestrated in this paper would enhance societal business practices and, hence, scale up social wellbeing while helping rejuvenate pandemic-stricken economies. It paves the way for new research too.",

            "text": "Yunus Social Business (YSB) and conventional social enterprises (SEs) are defined as socially committed businesses for their capabilities of addressing social issues. These unique ventures contribute to socioeconomic upliftment by creating social values and solving social problems (Sugahara et al. 2021), such as unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, and numerous other social ills, while remaining operationally sustainable. Nevertheless, YSB, a nondividend and nonloss business model, contradicts the conventional nature of investment by unsatisfying individuals\u2019 profit-seeking desires (Aydin 2015). It does not share the business profit with investors and instead utilises that money for business expansion or meeting pressing social needs (Yunus 2010; Yunus et al. 2010). However, this zero-return provision is unattractive to acquisitive investors and profit seekers. Hence, the Yunusian social business, for its startup capital, relies primarily on philanthropic and charitable attention or grants. Islam embodies the principle of a bond between individuals and society; hence, it encourages individuals to be enveloped in social interest. That is why social problem-solving, according to the Islamic social value system, is a mutual and individual responsibility. The Islamic financial system, in this regard, inbounds some financial instruments to address social issues and enhance social wellbeing (Kooli et al. 2022). The Islamic economic system comprises a comprehensive financial framework that includes some special financial tools, namely social funds, such as Zakat (mandatory almsgiving), Waqf (endowments), Sadaqah (charity), and Qard Hasan (interest-free benevolent loans) to ensure the equitable\nAdm. Sci. 2023, 13, 102. https://doi.org/10.3390/admsci13040102 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/admsci\ndistribution of wealth (Hakim and Dalimunthe 2022). The sole purpose of these financial instruments is to enhance social wellbeing (Majid 2021; Yazdi et al. 2021). These instruments are deemed more useful if used in socially committed businesses (Andriyani et al. 2020). In this regard, Professor Yunus reiterated, \u201ca charity dollar has only one life; a social business dollar can be invested over and over again\u201d (Yunus Social Business 2019). However, so far, they have been inadequately institutionalised to finance social businesses. The recent devastating COVID-19 pandemic introduced numerous problems to human society. Like many other developmental initiatives, YSB and SEs could be utilised to rejuvenate the pandemic-stricken socioeconomic body given that they are committed to addressing social issues in entrepreneurial ways while remaining operationally self-reliant and sustainable. Hence, the integration of ISFs with YSB and SEs will presumably boost their performances and thus help enhance economic rejuvenation. This paper aims to design an integrated financial model that can provide startup capital to social enterprises (SEs) and Yunus Social Business (YSB), by using Islamic social funds (ISFs). The following sections delineate the literature on value-based financial intermediation, Yunusian social business, and social enterprises while narrating the method and discussing how ISFs can be integrated with these societal ventures."

            "heading": "2. Value-Based Intermediation (VBI)",
            "text": "The central bank of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), has defined Islamic value-based intermediation (VBI) as \u201can intermediation function that aims to deliver the intended outcomes of Shariah through practices, conduct and offerings that generate positive and sustainable impact to the economy, community and environment, consistent with the shareholders\u2019 sustainable returns and long-term interests\u201d (BNM 2018, p. 6). In the above definition, a few phrases, such as \u201cShariah practices\u201d, \u201cpositive and sustainable impact\u201d, \u201ceconomy, community and environment\u201d, and \u201clong-term interests\u201d impregnate the core functions of VBI. That implies that VBI foregrounds sustainable socioeconomic progress, community, and environmental wellbeing through Shariah-compliant investment. Nevertheless, it encourages innovative products and services to the existing market, high-impact areas, and underserved segments. It pursues financial intermediation upon impact-based assessment, comprehensive measurement, impact-focused disclosure, constructive collaboration, and inclusive governance, creating value and impact while remaining Shariah compliant. Nonetheless, this approach can benefit financial institutions by promoting impact-driven mindsets in stakeholders while expanding market opportunities by offering innovative financial solutions. It primarily addresses the unserved and underserved segments of society. Through the improved supply chain and with employees\u2019 skills and creative business models, it simultaneously achieves operational efficiency, stakeholders\u2019 interests, and solutions to issues faced by communities and stakeholders (BNM 2018). To sum up, BVI extends financial services to the unserved or underserved market segment paying particular attention to underprivileged people while remaining operationally viable and sustainable."

This business model solely addresses pressing social needs in entrepreneurial ways by remaining financially sustainable, operationally self-reliant, and harmless to the environment. Worth mentioning, through social business, Professor Yunus aspires to create a world of three zeros: zero poverty, zero unemployment, and zero carbon emissions. He broadly envisions a world of a rational economic system where equitable wealth distribution and fundamental human rights are fulfilled; human potentials are nurtured, valued, and utilised; and the environment is protected and preserved. He aspires to attain all these possibilities through a business model, which he named Yunus Social Business (YSB). YSB features an employee value proposition and gender parity\nwhile incorporating the mechanism of sustainability and growth by defending market forces. It is innately conditionalised with zero-return investment, wherein the investor is unentitled to receive any dividend from the business profit. After a certain period, they can recoup only the net amount invested. The profit stays with the business for its growth or addressing specific social problems. Nonetheless, positive social changes bring unalloyed joy to investors and employees (Yunus 2010). The business community and academia are seemingly univocal against the Yunusian zero-return investment approach and consider it an implementational barrier. The ubiquitous argument is that the zero-return aspect is unattractive to investors unless they are benevolent or philanthropists. Notwithstanding, zero-return investment profoundly benefits society while incentivising investors in numerous nonmonetary ways, such as bringing celestial joy, social reputation, human dignity, etc. From this point of view, YSB is worth practising as a noble deed attained by amplifying social and environmental wellbeing. However, the individualistic mindset might look for monetary incentives or tangible returns on investment (ROI) for self-gratification (Aydin 2015). Further, the time value of money also encourages investors to seek a higher return to increase their wealth or at least remain afloat on the increasing tide of inflation. Therefore, the zero-return investment fails to attract acquisitive investors and seeks generous and selfless individuals for funding. The socioeconomic implications of YSB are described in the following section."

            "text": "The present economic structure regarding wealth distribution and social value creation is seemingly inequitable and irrational. This system dispenses enormous opportunities to a few hands to concentrate wealth and, thus, gives birth to a handful of exorbitantly wealthy people while keeping the vast majority within poverty and deprivation (Goda et al. 2017). Wealth gravitates towards wealth. The economic distance and income disparity between rich and poor exponentially increases because of rich people\u2019s ability to make capital investments that poor people cannot. The neoliberal market economy tends towards the elimination of price controls, the deregulation of the capital market, and low trade barriers, thus accelerating wealth concentration (Smith 2023). In production functions, firms employ cost cutting to gain competitive advantages as price leaders or become price takers by monopolising and hegemonising and through illusive branding. Nevertheless, thanks to the exceedingly inconsistent wealth distribution system, a colossal divide and discrimination surface on the socioeconomic landscape (Karmakar and Jana 2022; Sgambati 2022). In many cases, in addition to the inexpensive labour supply, firms are inclined towards using economical energy sources and ignore environmental wellbeing and waste management; as a result, they produce greenhouse gases, causing extensive ecological damage (Abadli and Kooli 2022; Dong et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020). They routinely harm the world and turn it into an unliveable place. In many countries, deregulation in the governing system or the improper utilisation of resources exacerbates unemployment and poverty while raising gender discrimination, child labour, social injustice, etc. Consequently, human society is deprived of balanced progress and mutual prosperity. In such a situation, if viewed from the social and humanitarian standpoints, Yunus Social Business could be regarded as a helpful device capable of offering higher social incentives by benefiting people of all walks of life (Faza 2022). Further, this business is ordinarily market driven, extraordinarily environmentally conscious, and rationally gender sensitive (Yunus 2010). The success of this venture is measured on the basis of human development, social welfare, and subjective wellbeing. YSB is economically viable, operationally sustainable, and socially beneficial and is, therefore, worth practising."

The profit stays with the business for addressing social problems or augmenting the business itself (Yunus 2010). In this regard, two Islamic social funds, namely Qard Hasan and Waqf, could be utilised as the startup capital for YSB. The following sections shed light on the utilisation of these two instruments."

            "text": "According to Shariah rules, Qard Hasan, a benevolent loan, is not tied up with the \u201ctime value of money\u201d principle. It does not seek surplus returns such as interest or profit share; only the principal amount must be paid back after a certain period (Hakim and Dalimunthe 2022). Nevertheless, Qard Hasan is a dignified option for the needy rather than being charity-dependent. It can be loaned repeatedly, and thus, it increases socioeconomic values (Aydin 2015). The proper utilisation of this financial instrument can enhance individual and social wellbeing. That is why this financial instrument is suitable for financing YSB initiatives.\nThe Qur\u2019an encourages Muslims to render Qard Hasan (benevolent loans):\n\u201cIf you give Allah Qard Hasan . . . he will grant you forgiveness\u201d (Qur\u2019an 64:17).\n\u201cEstablish regular prayer and give regular charity and give Allah Qard Hasan\u201d (Qur\u2019an 73:20).\n\u201cWho is he that will give Allah Qard Hasan? For Allah will increase it manifold to his credit\u201d (Qur\u2019an 57:11).\n[Translation: (Islamic Relief Worldwide n.d.)]\nThe Quran asserts that Qard Hasan brings lenders divine blessings and increases in wealth while being as good as regular prayer. Therefore, the individual lender may offer this fund as startup capital to social entrepreneurs who want to run social businesses for social benefits (Kooli 2020). Similarly, the government may allocate some taxpayers\u2019 money to Qard Hasan to invest in social business. Islamic financial institutions may offer Qard Hasan for social businesses as part of their corporate social responsibilities or social business practices (Kooli et al. 2022). This practice would benefit them by enhancing their reputation and public trust while widening the market segment and increasing brand value.\nThis instrument is suitable for risk management. The Quran says, \u201cif the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to\nrepay. But if you remit it by way of charity. That is best for you if you only knew\u201d (Qur\u2019an, 2:280). [Translation: (Adnan n.d.)] The above verses indicate that the time should be extended if the debtor fails to repay Qard Hasan within the lending tenure. Further, in borrowers\u2019 critical conditions, the loan is suggested to be forgiven. Therefore, if YSB or SEs are capitalised by Qard Hasan, the continuation of the ventures and social benefits will be emphasised thanks to the lenient nature of the loan."

            "text": "Another source of Islamic social funds is Waqf, which embodies the characteristics of perpetuity, irrevocability, and inalienability (Ambrose and Asuhaimi 2021; Ismail Abdel Mohsin 2014) and could be integrated into Yunus Social Business (YSB). This is basically of two kinds: asset Waqf and cash Waqf. Asset Waqf (immovable property) has a longstanding history of being utilised for social welfare by building educational institutions, orphanages, hospitals, etc. (Sugianto et al. 2022). Cash Waqf (Aaqf al-nuqud) is a trust fund formed with cash to render service to humanity in the name of God (Aldeen et al. 2021; \u00c7izar\u00e7a 1995). Nevertheless, cash Waqf is comparably easy to invest and manage, and increasing its value is likewise easy. It is also convenient for adherent Muslims to practise it by contributing money (Chowdhury et al. 2011). Both types of Waqf could be utilised for practising YSB. Recently, a different kind of Waqf has come forward, called corporate Waqf, which is issued in the form of shares (Mawquf /Waqf asset) and managed by a corporation. This Waqf \u2019s primary intent is to fulfil social obligations by giving back to society and reaching out\nto the community. It nurtures all characteristics of Waqf while meeting business and corporate objectives (Saad et al. 2017). It is generally managed by a Waqf administrative body (WAB) by issuing Waqf certificates with different denominations as low, medium, or high to individuals or institutions. Any predetermined social businesses could be initiated with that capital when it reaches the targeted amount. The business\u2019 income will cover its operational expenses; otherwise, it may rely on secondary schemes. For instance, if the primary project is a hospital, the secondary project could be a shopping complex. The profit generated from the second project will finance the primary one (Nurrachmi 2012). Corporate Waqf can address crucial socioeconomic needs by establishing large projects such as hospitals, schools, universities, pharmaceutical companies (generic medicine, vaccines, etc.), water treatment plants, irrigation, etc. Nevertheless, if appropriately structured, planned, and managed, this corporate body can function well in the marketplace with all the usual competencies and vitalities (Saad et al. 2017)."

            "text": "Dees et al. (2001) differentiated enterprises into three categories: purely philanthropic, hybrid, and strictly commercial. Purely philanthropic ones are driven by social missions. Their sole purpose is to create social values. Beneficiaries are not required to pay for the products or services. The startup capital for this type of venture comes from donations and grants and its workforce from volunteers. Hybrid enterprises combine mission- and market-oriented approaches to create social and economic values. Low-income people, the targeted beneficiaries, pay the subsidised rate for the goods and services, while well-off purchasers pay the market price. Similarly, the workforce earns lower salaries or wages than the market rate. Sometimes, they employ combinedly fully paid staff and volunteers. They also look for discounted prices from suppliers. Purely commercialised enterprises are entirely market driven. They are focused on meeting self-interest by increasing economic value. Customers pay fair market prices, investors pay the capital at market rates, and the workforce receives market-standard salaries. The suppliers charge the total market prices as well. Mair and Marti (2006) defined social enterprises as exploiting and exploring opportunities to create social values to meet social needs. Hence, social entrepreneurship can leverage resources to resolve social problems. SEs, as noneconomic, charity, or business initiatives, aim to create positive social change. As a business entity, it prefers to develop social values rather than maximise profits to satisfy individuals\u2019 desires (Volkmann et al. 2012; Kickul et al. 2012). Thus, they marked the sheer differences between conventional entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. They further argued that conventional entrepreneurs enact visions that are based on new ideas and innovations while being profit oriented with an economic motive. Contrarily, the primary objective of social enterprises (SEs) is to ensure social change and wellbeing through social wealth creation. These entities seek new opportunities through innovation, adaptation, and learning to generate social and economic wealth. SEs solve social problems by creating social values through their organisational form, which could be nonprofit or profit oriented (Volkmann et al. 2012). In this regard, Dacin et al. (2010) underscored four key factors that SEs focus on: (i) characteristics of the venture, (ii) scopes of activities, (iii) process and resource utilisation, and (iv) the primary objective of social value creation. Therefore, SEs are considered the driving forces of social change and economic nourishment."

            "text": "Yunus Social Business (YSB) and Islamic social fund (ISF) models seemingly aim to achieve social objectives. They have profound similarities in their social focuses while having significant differences in implementation and characteristics. YSB is a nonloss, nondividend business model. Like any market-driven conventional business, YSB responds to market forces. However, the distinct characteristics underpin profit equity, social objectives, and operational principles. The profit remains with the firm for its expansion or for meeting social goals. The investors recoup only the net investment amount, not a profit share (Yunus et al. 2010). ISFs fundamentally deal with social objectives to enhance social wellbeing. On the other hand, except for Waqf, the rest of the ISFs are utilised as charity. Hence, ISFs do not regenerate or grow themselves. These funds could be invested if businesses comply with Shariah law and its principles. ISFs, according to Shariah principles, avoid Riba (an increase without \u2018iwad or equal countervalue/usury or interest), Khilabah (fraud), Ghishsh (deception), Al-ikrah (coercion), Gharar (uncertainty, indeterminacy, hazard, or risk), Qimar (gambling), and Maysir (games of chance/monetary gains derived from mere chance) (Saiti and Abdullah 2016; Uddin 2015). However, YSB and ISFs are accountable to their donors and stakeholders and are expected to operate transparently and ethically. ISF operates under the guidance of Shariah scholars, who ensure that the fund\u2019s investments comply with Islamic principles. The scholars also provide guidance on profit distribution and risk-management issues. YSB functions under the seven principles defined by Professor Muhammad Yunus. YSB focuses on investing in social businesses that target low-income and marginalised communities. The aim is to create sustainable solutions that can help alleviate poverty and improve living standards (Yunus 2010). In summary, YSB seeks startup capital to attain social goals in a sustainable entrepreneurial way. It intends to achieve a triple bottom line, namely people, planet, and profit (3Ps). Similarly, ISFs are the Islamic financial sources that serve underprivileged societies to scale up social wellbeing by ascertaining four ERs: economic reinforcement, economic rescue, economic recovery, and economic resilience (Widiastuti et al. 2022). Hence, in terms of social focus, YSB and ISFs go towards the same destinations. They fundamentally differ in their implementation and characteristics. YSB is dedicated to creating social impact. At the same time, ISFs are socially devoted funds that follow Islamic finance principles. In this regard, ISFs could be integrated into the veins of YSB to sustainably ensure social good."

It has intensified poverty and unemployment, enormously weakening our socioeconomic body. During the COVID-19 pandemic (in 2021), the average income of B40 people decreased by 6.5% compared with an ideal time. They could hardly recover their initial income losses. As a result, about 70 million additional people live below USD 1.9 in income per day (S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e1ramo et al. 2021). Recently, more than 700 million people (on income less than USD 2.15 per person per day, according to the 2017 PPP) fell into extreme poverty because of the prolonged pandemic. Further, income inequality has risen as well. Thus, in 2019, global poverty increased to 9.3% from 8.4% (The World Bank 2022). Because of lockdowns, mobility control, sickness, and fear, people could not regularly perform economic activities. In addition, illness and death took extra tolls on the economy.\nStates\u2019 production went down because of disruptions in the supply chain. The world has experienced economic consequences (Zimon et al. 2022). This pandemic also exacerbated many other socioeconomic issues, such as child marriage, child labour, school dropout, domestic violence, divorce, crime and injustice, inequalities, poverty, hunger, unemployment, etc. To tackle these issues, social enterprises and Yunusian social businesses would be the potential solutions. Because these businesses dedicatedly work to create social value, equitably distribute wealth, and relieve social ills rather than to maximise profit and concentrate wealth, they will presumably be more effective in economic reparation and rejuvenation."

In addition, existential climate change has caused severe damage to the environmental ecosystem. Much effort must be paid to prevent ecological harm and ensure an equitable distribution of wealth. To a greater extent, that could be attained through a broader practice of Yunusian social business and social enterprises. Because YSB disregards the conventional capitalist formula of sharing dividends by embodying the zero-return-investment approach, Islamic social funds (ISFs) can help provide startup capital. Hence, Qard Hasan, cash Waqf, and corporate Waqf could be propulsive to enthuse and accelerate YSB practices. Similarly, ISFs could be streamed into the vein of social enterprises to enhance social welfare by addressing numerous critical socioeconomic problems. Because both business models expose market forces, they might encounter market risks. In that case, some funds could be used for risk-mitigating and leveraging purposes. For instance, Zakat and Sadaqah can be utilised to tackle financial risks, while Waqf -based third-party guarantees can also reduce and leverage systematic and unsystematic risks. Notably, the size of global Zakat is about USD 600 billion (UNICEF 2019). If a portion of it could be utilised for funding Yunus Social Business and social enterprises, greater benefits could be earned for society. Nevertheless, the sources and sizes of ISFs are seemingly innumerable but enormous. Muslims offer ISFs out of their faith with the expectation of divine blessings and social good. Proper usage of these funds could significantly contribute to economic reparation, social wellbeing, and, thus, development. Regulatory authorities and policymakers, especially in Muslim-majority countries, should come forward to institutionalise Islamic social funds to better practise YSB and SEs to ensure greater social good and sustainable development."
