INTRODUCTION\nRecent trends in hunting for new physics beyond the standard model (SM) can divided into (i) high-energy frontier, (ii) precision frontier, and (iii) cosmology frontier. While the high-energy frontier has not been finding anything new other than the discovery of the Higgs boson and the cosmology frontier involves large uncertainties associated with observations, the precision frontier, on the other hand, has shown some surprising results. Namely, there are a number of anomalies in B meson decays, the muon anomalous moment, and the very recent W-boson mass measurement [1].

The advantage of using ratios is that the ratio can have a lot of hadronic uncertainties in each branching ratio measurement to be eliminated. Precise measurements of these ratios with significant deviations from the SM predictions can hint at new physics. The same short-distance process b \u2192 sll is also responsible for B0s \u2192 l\u00fel\u2212. Another set of observables is related to the short-distance\nprocess b \u2192 cl\u03bd, and the observables are [4]\nRD \u00bc BR\u00f0B \u2192 D\u03c4\u03bd\u00de BR\u00f0B \u2192 Dl\u03bd\u00de \u00bc 0.340 0.027 0.013;\nRD \u00bc BR\u00f0B \u2192 D \u03c4\u03bd\u00de BR\u00f0B \u2192 D l\u03bd\u00de \u00bc 0.295 0.011 0.008; \u00f01:4\u00de\nand the combined discrepancy to SM prediction is at the 3.1\u03c3 level. Another long-standing experimental anomaly is themuon anomalous moment (also known as g \u2212 2). The most recent muon g \u2212 2 measurement was performed by the E989 experiment at Fermilab, which reported the new result [5]\n\u0394a\u03bc \u00bc \u00f025.1 5.9\u00de \u00d7 10\u221210; \u00f01:5\u00de which deviates at the level of 4.2\u03c3 from the most recent SM prediction.1 On the other hand, the g \u2212 2 measurements for\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The electron g \u2212 2 was used to be the most precise determination of the fine-structure constant \u03b1. Nevertheless, there were two contradicting determinations of \u03b1 [7,8] resulting in two theory predictions, which deviate from the experimental measurement [9] in opposite directions, given by\n\u0394aLKBe \u00bc aexpe \u2212 aLKBe \u00bc \u00f04.8 3.0\u00de \u00d7 10\u221213; \u0394aBe \u00bc aexpe \u2212 aBe \u00bc \u00f0\u22128.8 3.6\u00de \u00d7 10\u221213: \u00f01:6\u00de\nIn the following analysis, we show the results for both cases of \u0394ae. Note that, if we want to explain the \u0394a\u03bc with new physics, it is very likely subject to constraints coming from lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) decays, such as \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. There has been a vast literature in explaining all or part\nof the anomalies. Especially, the leptoquark (LQ) provides viable explanations for the RK;K and/or RD;D anomalies. It was illustrated in Ref. [10] that only the isosinglet vector LQ U1 with the SM quantum numbers \u00f03; 1; 2=3\u00de can explain both RK;K and RD;D , while the scalar LQs S1, S3, and R2 and the isotriplet vector LQ U3\u00f03; 1; 2=3\u00de can explain only one of the anomalies. There have been very few studies on the isospin-doublet vector LQ, denoted by V2\u00f03; 2; 5=6\u00de. In this work, we attempt to fill the gap by showing that the isodoublet vector LQ V2 can satisfy the anomalies RK;K and RD;D , as well as it can satisfy the \u0394a\u03bc and \u0394ae subject to LFV constraints. Very recently, there was a new W-boson mass measure-\nment by the CDF Collaboration [1]:\nMW \u00bc 80.4335 0.0094 GeV;\nwhich is about 7\u03c3 above the SM prediction of MW;SM \u00bc 80.361 0.006 GeV [11]. Additional corrections to the W-boson mass can come from new physics, which can be conveniently parametrized in terms of the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T, andU [12]. TheW-boson mass correction is most sensitive to the T parameter. It is well known that an electroweak doublet with a mass splitting between the upper and lower components contributes positively to the T parameter and, thus, gives a positive contribution to the W mass. We highlight the capabilities of the LQ V2 in solving the anomalies. (1) The more popular explanation of the RK;K anomaly\nis by decreasing the b \u2192 s\u03bc\u00fe\u03bc\u2212 using the lefthanded coupling to the muon, such that the combination of the Wilson coefficients C9 and C10 is in the form C9 \u00bc \u2212C10 in accordance with the best fit [13]. This is the case of the isosinglet vector LQ U1, On the other hand, the isodoublet vector LQ V2 couples to the right-handed lepton. such that it contributes to C9 and C10 in the combination of C9 \u00bc C10. We,\ntherefore, require V2 to couple to the electron and to increase b \u2192 se\u00fee\u2212. (2) V2 can enhance substantially the \u0394a\u03bc and change \u0394ae in both directions using different combinations of couplings. Nevertheless, in order to reach with 2\u03c3 of \u0394a\u03bc, one of the couplings has to be very large. This is due to the constraint from the \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. (3) RD;D can be easily satisfied. (4) The isodoublet LQ V2 can couple to the weak gauge\nbosons and, thus, modifies the S, T, and U parameters. It can explain the very recentW-mass anomaly measured by CDF. The organization of this work is as follows. In the next section, we introduce the interactions of the vector LQ. In Sec. III, we describe the effects of the vector LQ on various observables thatweused in this analysis. InSec. IV,wegive the results and the valid parameter space. We conclude in Sec. V.\nII.

Since ClSR \u00bc 0 is still compatible with observation within 1\u03c3 (\u0394\u03c72 \u2264 2.3), the chi-square regions in the \u00f0XLR23 ; XRL33 \u00de panel connected. The Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u00fe\u03bc\u2212 observable dictates the chi-square regions in the \u00f0Cbs\u03bc\u03bcS ; Cbs\u03bc\u03bcP \u00de panel, and there are two solutions: Cbs\u03bc\u03bcS \u00bc \u2212Cbs\u03bc\u03bcP \u2243 \u22120.064 and \u22430.00 correspond, respectively, to non-SM and SM solutions, which also exhibit in the \u00f0XLR22 ; XRL32 \u00de and \u00f0\u0394a\u03bc; XLR22 \u00de panels. The non-SM and SM solutions require\nXRL32 \u00f0XLR22 \u00de m2V2 \u2243 \u22125.1\u00d710\u22125 \u00f01TeV\u00de2 and jXRL32 \u00f0XLR22 \u00de j m2V2 \u2272 10 \u22125 \u00f01TeV\u00de2 ; \u00f04:4\u00de respectively. On the other hand, the Bs \u2192 e\u00fee\u2212 observable, which is consistent with the SM, sets limit on\njXRL31 \u00f0XLR21 \u00de j m2V2 \u2272 10 \u22124 \u00f01 TeV\u00de2 ; \u00f04:5\u00de\nexplaining the region in the \u00f0XLR21 ; XRL31 \u00de panel in Fig. 1. BP-1 fits well to RK;K , RD;D , Bs \u2192 l\u00fel\u2212, and LFV observables; however, it does not induce sizable \u0394a\u03bc or \u0394ae. BP-2 intriguingly provides simultaneous solutions to \u0394a\u03bc and \u0394aBe , as well as a decent fit to B-physics observables. The severe restriction from \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is the main difficulty to a generate sizable \u0394a\u03bc. Specifically, the former is related to the linear combinations of XLR31 X RL 32 and XLR32 X RL 31 , while the latter is related to the product X LR 32 X RL 32 . Therefore, suppressing the XLR;RL31 to avoid the \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 constraint may help to unleash a large enough \u0394a\u03bc. According to Eqs. (4.2) and (4.5), apparently, the above scenario can be achieved by a large enough jXLR21 j, and this is the main result of BP-2. Unfortunately, the minimum requirement of jXLR21 j is significantly above the perturbative limit, ffiffiffiffiffi 4\u03c0 p . For example, it needs XLR21 \u2272 \u22128 from the \u00f0XLR21 ;\u0394a\u03bc\u00de panel in order to start overlapping with the 2\u03c3 region of \u00f0g \u2212 2\u00de\u03bc, and it is XLR21 \u00bc \u221217.85 for BP-2. Finally, BP-3 provides an alternative solution for \u0394aLKBe and B anomalies; meanwhile, it is consistent with LFVand B-physics limits. The raising of the W-boson mass due to the mass\nsplitting of the isodoublet V2 is given in Eq. (3.16). The raise depends only on the absolute of the mass difference and is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that a mass splitting of\n25\u201330 GeV provides a viable solution to the W-boson anomaly. Such a mass splitting corresponds to 1.25%\u20131.5% of a 2 TeV LQ."

            "text": "Most works in the literature on solving the RK;K anomaly rely on reducing b \u2192 s\u03bc\u00fe\u03bc\u2212 with the LQ couplings to the left-handed muon. Nevertheless, it remains an almost equally viable solution of increasing b \u2192 se\u00fee\u2212. Here, in this work, we have attempted to use the isodoublet vector LQ V2 that couples to the right-handed electron to increase b \u2192 se\u00fee\u2212 and found parameter space to explain the RK;K . Simultaneously, it can also explain the RD;D and is consistent with the Bs decays. We have also investigated the possibility of explaining\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment. Such a possibility is severely constrained by the leptonic radiative decay li \u2192 lj\u03b3. We have successfully found some parameter space points that can explain all RK;K , RD;D , Bs decays, LFV, and \u0394a\u03bc and \u0394aBe (see BP-2), though one of the couplings is close to or larger than the perturbative limit. Furthermore, the isodoublet vector leptoquark V2 naturally explains theW-boson anomaly with a mass splitting of the order of 25\u201330 GeV between the isospin components."
