    "abstractText": "We study observation entropy (OE) for the Quantum kicked top (QKT) model, whose classical counterpart possesses different phases: regular, mixed, or chaotic, depending on the strength of the kicking parameter. We show that OE grows logarithmically with coarse-graining length beyond a critical value in the regular phase, while OE growth is much faster in the chaotic regime. In the dynamics, we demonstrate that the short-time growth rate of OE acts as a measure of the chaoticity in the system, and we compare our results with out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC). Moreover, we show that in the deep quantum regime, the results obtained from OE are much more robust compared to OTOC results. Finally, we also investigate the long-time behaviour of OE to distinguish between saddle-point scrambling and true chaos, where the former shows large persistent fluctuations compared to the latter.",

Aravinda2, \u2021 1Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune 411008, India\n2Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, Tirupati, 517619, India\nWe study observation entropy (OE) for the Quantum kicked top (QKT) model, whose classical counterpart possesses different phases: regular, mixed, or chaotic, depending on the strength of the kicking parameter. We show that OE grows logarithmically with coarse-graining length beyond a critical value in the regular phase, while OE growth is much faster in the chaotic regime. In the dynamics, we demonstrate that the short-time growth rate of OE acts as a measure of the chaoticity in the system, and we compare our results with out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC). Moreover, we show that in the deep quantum regime, the results obtained from OE are much more robust compared to OTOC results. Finally, we also investigate the long-time behaviour of OE to distinguish between saddle-point scrambling and true chaos, where the former shows large persistent fluctuations compared to the latter."

            "text": "Classical chaos is one of the most significant discoveries in modern classical mechanics, and its emergence and applications in various research fields are paralleled with the development of classical computers. Around 1980, defining quantum chaos based on the correspondence principle was initiated, and the definition depends mainly on the chaotic behaviour of the classically limited system from its quantum counterpart [1\u2013 4]. Random matrix theory has contributed significantly to defining and characterizing quantum chaos [5]. The emergence of quantum information theory and its applications in various fields of research, particularly in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity accelerated the studies on the role of quantum chaos [6, 7]. Such cross-field fertilization brought new tools and the application of quantum chaos to the forefront of research. The most important diagnostic tool is the Outof-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC), from which the quantum Lyapunov exponent can be extracted [8, 9]. OTOC has been studied for various systems of interest, from simple systems to quantum many-body systems and continuous variable systems [8\u201318]. OTOCs have also given rise to other closely related measures [19\u201321]. Relating OTOC with quantum information theoretic notions like entanglement generation, uncertainty relations, discord, and quasi-probability distribution implies a closer tie between the tools of quantum information theory and quantum chaos [22\u201327].\nThe validity of thermodynamic laws of motion from the statistical mechanical standpoint inherits the system\u2019s chaotic behaviour. Latora and Baranger proposed [28] a form of entropy similar to observational entropy (see next paragraph) that we study in this work, called \u201cphysical entropy\u201d, and extracted the Kolmogorov exponents for various simple classical chaotic maps. The\nfoundations of quantum statistical mechanics rely on the concepts of quantum chaos, and the relation between OTOC and thermalization is well-studied in various models [29, 30]. The development of quantum information theory inherited all the notions of classical information theory by treating quantum mechanics as a generalization of probability theory into the non-commutative world, with various definitions of entropy generalized to quantum entropies. Still, what is to be considered thermodynamic entropy in quantum mechanics (QM) remains a controversial topic. Von Neumann\u2019s entropy was a valid form of entropy to study equilibrium thermodynamics as a generalization of Gibb\u2019s entropy. The interpretation of it as thermodynamic entropy and other foundational issues of statistical thermodynamics remains unanswered [31\u201336].\nSafranek, Deutsch, and Aguirre recently studied the thermalization of closed quantum systems by defining an entropy, a quantum mechanical generalization of classical Gibbs and Boltzmann entropy [37, 38]. They called it observational entropy (OE) and proved that it is a monotonic function of coarse-graining. However, the concept of OE is quite old and was introduced earlier in many seminal works in some different forms[31, 39\u2013 41]. Various extensions and applications of OE have been studied recently [42\u201346]. The main advantage of observational entropy is that it can be realized in currently available experimental setups [47\u201365]. Even from the theoretical perspective, observational entropy can be a very useful diagnostic tool to characterize different phases of matter. In a recent work, two authors of this article investigated the localization-delocalization transition using OE. In contrast to the other diagnostic tools, OE possesses an extra degree of freedom: the coarse-graining length. One can find an optimal coarsegraining length so that the finite size scaling shows much better data-collapse, which other diagnostic tools ar X iv :2 21 2.\n01 58\n5v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n7 J\nun 2\n02 3\n2 cannot provide [66]. Our main aim is to investigate the regular and chaotic behaviour using OE. More precisely, we want to investigate how OE behaves for a system whose classical counterpart possesses regular, mixed, and chaotic phases. One of the best candidates for this study is the quantum kicked top (QKT) model [5, 13, 67\u201371]. Depending on the strength of the kicking parameter, the classical analogue of this model shows a regular, mixed, or chaotic phase. QKTs are also experimentally realisable in cold atom [69], and superconducting systems [70]. The eigenvalue-spacing statistics of this model show a transition from Poisson to Wigner distribution as expected, depending on the underlying classical dynamics [67]. Dynamical measures, such as sensitivity to perturbation, OTOCs, and entanglement dynamics, correspond with the classical phase space [13, 69, 71\u2013 77]. Surprisingly, kicked tops even in the deep quantum regime show signatures of chaos [13, 69, 71, 74]. Furthermore, such few-qubit QKTs are exactly solvable [13, 71], making them one of the few chaotic models with an analytical and experimental grasp."

            "text": "Consider a quantum system \u03c1 defined on the Hilbert space H of dimension d. We can then partition H into orthogonal subspaces {Hi} such that H = \u2295iHi. The projection operator onto a subspace Hi is denoted by \u03a0i, and \u2211i \u03a0i = I, since they form a complete set of projections. Such a set {\u03a0i} is called a coarse-graining, denoted by \u03c7. Each of the subspaces can be treated as a macrostate, and the probability pi that the system \u03c1 is found in a macrostate (subspace) Hi on measurement is given by pi = Tr(\u03a0i\u03c1). Note that in general, both measurements and coarse-graining can be defined with general positive operator valued measures [78]. The dimension of the subspace Hi, given by Tr(\u03a0i) is called the volume or coarse-graining length (Vi) of the subspace. Then the observational entropy of the state \u03c1 associated with the coarse-graining \u03c7 is given as\nS\u03c7(\u03c1) = \u2212\u2211 i pi log pi Vi . (1)\nConsider two coarse-graining \u03c71 and \u03c72 with the projector sets \u03a0i1 and \u03a0i2 . The coarse graining \u03c71 is rougher than the coarse-graining \u03c72, and is denoted \u03c71 \u21aa\u2192 \u03c72, if for every \u03a0i1 \u2208 \u03c71, there exists {\u03a0i2} such that \u03a0i1 = \u2211i2\u2208ci1\n\u03a0i2 , where ci1 is some index set. In this case, \u03c72 is called as finer coarse-graining than \u03c71.\nThe coarse-graining \u03c7I with idenity I is the roughest coarse graining, as \u03c7I \u21aa\u2192 \u03c7i, for any coarse-graining \u03c7i. Coarse-graining with {\u03a0i1} containing only rank-1 projectors (Vi = 1, \u2200i) is the finest coarse-graining.\nIt has been shown that OE is a monotonic function of the coarse-graining. Given \u03c71 and \u03c72, if \u03c71 \u21aa\u2192 \u03c72 then\nS\u03c71(\u03c1) \u2265 S\u03c72(\u03c1). (2)\nFor a given state of the system \u03c1, the von Neumann entropy SvN(\u03c1) = \u2212Tr[\u03c1 log \u03c1] bounds the OE (S\u03c7(\u03c1)) for any coarse-graining \u03c7\nSvN(\u03c1) \u2264 S\u03c7(\u03c1) \u2264 log dimH. (3)\nHowever, note that the von Neumann entropy is invariant under the closed system (unitary) evolution. The empirical evidences and the laws of thermodynamics suggests that there are situations in which the thermodynamic entropy should increase in isolated system as well. This incites to propose a quantum analogue of thermodynamic entropy, and OE is seen as a natural alternative [37, 38, 43]. This is more evident if we rewrite the Eq. (1) as\nS\u03c7(\u03c1) = \u2212\u2211 i pi log pi + \u2211 i pi log Vi. (4)\nThe first term is the Shannon entropy of measurement and the second term is the averaged Boltzmann entropy. The OE can have interpolations between both these entropies. The subspace Hi acts as a macrostate and if the state of the system \u03c1 is contained in one of the macrostates, then \u03a0i\u03c1\u03a0i = \u03c1. As a result, the OE S\u03c7(\u03c1) = log Vi, which is precisely the quantum analogue of Boltzmann entropy. The Shannon entropy term indicates the mean uncertainty about the macrostate in which the system can be found. If the microstates in a given macrostate are indistinguishable, the Boltzmann term represents the mean uncertainty about the system after the measurement. If the system is chaotic, the associated uncertainty will have its representation in its dynamics, and the OE can capture it efficiently.\nTo give an insight as to why OE diagnoses chaos, we consider OE from the perspective of retrodiction [79\u2013 81]. The second law of thermodynamics and the thermodynamic fluctuation relations are derived from the difference between the prediction and retrodiction [82, 83]. Consider a process represented by a random variable, which takes the value x at time t = 0, and y at time t = t\u2032. We use the knowledge of the random variable at t = 0 to predict the value it takes at t = t\u2032. Similarly, by using the knowledge of y at t = t\u2032, we can retrodict the value of the random variable at t = 0. The predicting probability is Pp(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x) and the retrodicting probability is Pr(x, y) = q(y)q(x|y). In the quantum\n3 mechanical scenario, let the quantum state in its eigen decomposition \u03c1 = \u2211j \u03bbj\n\u2223\u2223\u03d5j\u232a\u2329\u03d5j\u2223\u2223 be measured using the coarse-graining \u03c7 = {\u03a0i}. Then the joint probability Pp(i, j) = \u03bbj \u2329 \u03d5j \u2223\u2223\u03a0i\u2223\u2223\u03d5j\u232a. Using the measurement statistics of the coarse-graining \u03c7 = {\u03a0i}, the retrodicted quantum state can be given as\n\u03c1rec := \u2211 j pj Vj \u03a0j, (5)\nthe joint retrodictive probability is Pr(i, j) =( pj/Vj ) \u2329 \u03d5j \u2223\u2223\u03a0i\u2223\u2223\u03d5j\u232a. The OE satisfies the following equality and an inequality in terms of the distance between the quantities that represent prediction and retrodiction,\nS\u03c7(\u03c1)\u2212 SvN(\u03c1) = DKL(Pp||Pr) (6) \u2265 D(\u03c1||\u03c1rec). (7)\nHere DKL(\u2022||\u2022) is the classical relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) [84, 85] and D(\u2022||\u2022) is the Umegaki quantum relative entropy [86, 87]. For closed Hamiltonian dynamics (unitary dynamics), as pointed out earlier, the von Neumann entropy remains unchanged, and it vanishes for pure states. In some sense, chaos, residing in our understanding in its classical domain, represents the complex dynamics that relays on the difficulty to retrodict the initial state. Equation 7 conveys this intuition in the quantum realm. It says that a larger difference between the coarse-grained entropy(OE) and von Neumann entropy implies a bigger variance between the actual state of the system and the retrodicted system state from the coarse-grained measurements. Since von Neumann entropy is a constant for closed systems, the S\u03c7(\u03c1) term (OE) captures ignorance about the system because of coarse-grained measurements. We observe that ignorance about the system rapidly increases in quantum systems with classically chaotic dynamics. In other popular dynamical chaos measures such as Loschmidt echo and OTOC, a perturbation in the dynamics depicts the ignorance of the system\u2019s interaction with the incompletely known environment. Both perturbation and coarse-graining represent a lack of complete knowledge about the system, and this manifests as a rapid increase in system entropy in chaotic quantum systems.\nWhile the rate of entanglement entropy production is already used as a chaos indicator in the literature [88\u201390], having a classical analogue in physical entropy with a close relationship to the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy-rate [28], OE is a more natural candidate to diagnose chaos. Hence, in this work, we consider the QKT model and study the time evolution of S\u03c7(\u03c1) starting from initial localized spin coherent states. Having\ndiscussed the connection between OE and retrodiction, intuitively, we expect S\u03c7(\u03c1) to grow faster and saturate to a larger value for chaotic dynamics than regular motions. Also, Eq. (7) suggests that recovering spincoherent states must be much more challenging in the chaotic regime. A recent article [77] on spin coherent state tomography also corroborates this intuition. In the subsequent sections, we will discuss our findings in detail."

The eigenstates of Jz are the computational basis vectors, denoted as {|q\u27e9}, q \u2208 {0, 1, ... d \u2212 1}. We construct the orthogonal subspace-projection operators from these computational basis vectors as follows. We define \u03a0i = \u2211i+kq=i |q\u27e9 \u27e8q|, where i \u2208 {0, 1, 2... s \u2212 1} and k < d is a\nconstant. Here s denotes the total number of orthogonal partitions such that \u2211s\u22121i=0 \u03a0i = I, and H = \u2295 s\u22121 i=0Hi, where Hi is the subspace onto which \u03a0i projects the state.

We consider the total Hilbert space of dimension d = 2j + 1 = 1024, and study the growth of observational entropy with coarse-graining length. We choose \u00b5 as integer powers of 2.\nIn Fig. (2), we study the growth of OE with respect to the log of the coarse-graining length \u00b5. The initial state is the spin coherent state as defined in Eqn. (13), and the OE is calculated by averaging over 100 states for uniformly chosen values of \u03b8 \u2208 {0, \u03c0} and \u03d5 \u2208 {0, 2\u03c0}. The OE, as defined in Eqn. (1), consists of two terms. The first term is the Shannon entropy, and the second is the averaged Boltzmann entropy. Since we consider the volume of the subspaces Hi to be the same for every coarse-graining, the second term is a constant for a fixed \u00b5 and, i.e. log \u00b5 which is shown in Fig. (2) using a dotted line. The growth of the OE with coarsegraining length \u00b5 averaged over initial states (without any time evolution) is also shown in the same figure. After a critical value of coarse-graining length \u00b5, the\nOE grows as \u223c log \u00b5. It implies that the second term in the OE expression (averaged Boltzmann entropy term) starts dominating in this regime. On the other hand, for higher kicking strengths, OE is already large even at small coarse-graining lengths, and OE does not grow as fast as log \u00b5 anywhere. Note that the maximum attainable OE is log(dim(H)) which in our study is log(1024) \u2248 6.93, and the approach towards the maximum value becomes faster with the increase in the kicking parameter strength. Hence, the OE growth with coarse-graining length can clearly capture the distinctive behaviour of chaotic and regular motions."

            "text": "For classical systems, chaos is characterized by how fast the trajectories can fill the entire phase space. For the QKT in its classical limit, one can see (from Fig. (1)) the spread of the trajectories in the phase space. This intuition is qualitatively expanded to calculate the Lyapunov exponents from the definition similar to the definition of OE as in Eqn. (1) for classical discrete maps in Ref. [28]. They could extract Lyapunov exponents from the slope of the growth of the physical entropy for various classical chaotic maps.\nThe growth of OE for an initial state |\u03c8(\u03b8, \u03d5)\u27e9 under the discrete time evolution U for various kicking strengths \u03ba is studied in Fig. (3a).

We choose the Hilbert space dimension d = 2j + 1 = 400. Unlike the results shown in the previous section, here we choose a non-uniform coarse-graining (the coarse-graining length \u00b5 = 2 for half of the Hilbert space, and for the other half of the Hilbert space, we choose \u00b5 = 4). The reasons behind this particular choice of coarse-graining are twofold: 1)\n6 OE shows a short time growth followed by saturation in the chaotic regime. If one chooses \u00b5 to be large enough, the immediate consequence will be that the value of OE for the initial state will also be reasonably large. Hence, especially for higher kicking strengths, where the growth is exponential, as shown in Fig. (3b), the dynamical range of the short-time growth of OE will be extremely small for the Hilbert space dimension d = 400. That will make our analysis inefficient. 2) The second term (Boltzmann entropy) of the OE expression makes OE different from the usual Shannon entropy. Hence, to make the second term non-zero and keep the coarse-graining length small enough, the ideal choice is \u00b5 = 2. However, the uniform coarse-graining implies\nthat the second term of the OE expression is just a constant, i.e. log 2 (if \u00b5 is set to be 2) irrespective of the dynamics. Then OE does not contain more information about the evolving state than Shannon entropy. Hence, we choose a non-uniform coarse-graining and restrict ourselves to the coarse-graining length \u00b5 = 2 for half of the Hilbert space and \u00b5 = 4 for the other half. However, we have also verified our results for other coarsegraining lengths, and our finding is qualitatively robust as long as the \u00b5 << d.\nFor small values of kicking parameters \u03ba, the growth is slow and the long time saturation value is also much smaller than the maximum value, i.e. log(400) \u2243 5.99. In contrast, for the higher kicking strengths, OE grows faster and reaches very close to the maximum value in the long time limit. Also, for the regular system (small values of \u03ba), one can see the revivals in OE dynamics. On the other hand, in the chaotic case, the revival is not seen. These revivals are a signature of the existence of the regular (periodic) orbits in the classical phase space for such systems. Interestingly, similar revivals (or lack of it) has also been observed for an integrable (non-integrable) quantum spin chain in the entanglement dynamics [91].\nThe initial rate of growth in Fig. (3a) clearly distinguishes regular dynamics from a chaotic one. The growth rate is highest at initial time steps and later flattens to a saturation value in the chaotic regime. We plot this initial period of growth for the chaotic regime separately in Fig. (3b. Linear behaviour in the semi-log plot reflects an exponential growth of OE. The exponent increases with chaoticity.\nHow does the growth rate change with the dimension of the Hilbert space? We see in Fig. (4) that the growth rate of both OE and OTOC are very similar at d = 400 and d = 1000. On increasing the chaoticity further, both the OTOC and OE growth saturate (not shown in the figure), pertaining to the finite size of the Hilbert space.\nNext, we focus on the short time dynamics of the OE\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\nSl op\ne\nOE, d=1000 OTOC, d=1000 OE, d=400 OTOC, d=400\nFIG. 4: Initial rate of growth of OE and that of the log of OTOC, calculated at third time step is plotted against chaoticity, for d = 400 and d = 1000. A linear fit yields the following slopes. OE, d = 1000 : 0.09182, OE, d = 400 : 0.08560, which are very similar numbers. Also for OTOC, we get OTOC, d = 1000 : 0.24361 and OTOC, d = 400 : 0.25176.. Therefore, OE and OTOC rates of growth are very similar, despite the difference in dimensions of the Hilbert space.\nin detail. We define the OE growth rate \u03bbOE as the slope of the short-time OE growth and compare it with that of OTOC, a popular diagnostic of chaos of late. OTOC quantifies the scrambling and the spread of initially localized quantum information. For an Hermitian operator A(t), we define the OTOC as\nC(t) = \u22121 2\nTr ( \u03c1[A(t), A(0)]2 ) . (14)\nwhere A(t) = U\u2020(t)AU(t), time evolved operator under Heisenberg picture, and \u03c1 is the initial state. The rate of growth of OTOC, \u03bbq, associated with OTOC as\nC(t) \u2248 e2\u03bbqt. (15)\nOTOC acts an indicator of the extent of chaos. For our system, we consider A = Jz, a spin operator and evolve under the unitary operator U in Eqn. (9). An average is taken over the 100 states chosen randomly from the coherent states as described earlier. First, we compare our \u03bbOE (chaos indicator obtained from the short-time growth rate of OE) with \u03bbq (chaos indicator obtained from OTOC) in Fig. (4) for d = 400 and d = 1000. Remarkably, we find that the behaviour \u03bbOE and \u03bbq is very similar for different values of \u03ba. It is a validation that, indeed, the short-time growth rate of OE can act as a diagnostic tool to quantify the chaotic behaviour in a quantum system.\n7 We ask the following question: how well does OE capture the signatures of chaos in the deep quantum regime (small values of j)? OTOC is a sensitive diagnostic tool that has detected vestiges of chaos in kicked top models consisting of three and four qubits [13]. The small j behaviour obtained in [13] is reproduced in Fig. (5). Exponential rise in OTOC is expected till Ehrenfest time. The Ehrenfest time tE \u223c log(1/he f f ) log(\u03ba/2) \u223c log(2J+1) log(\u03ba/2) [20]. For our choices of \u03ba in the chaotic regime and small J values, the above formula gives log(2J+1)log(\u03ba/2) \u223c 1. Since the Ehrenfest time for these models is extremely short, and the observation is confined to the first two time steps. The initial rate of growth of OTOC saturates at j = 5/2, and higher quantum numbers exhibit the\nsame slope between the first two time steps. This indicates that to witness the chaotic growth rate, one needs to go only as high as the quantum number j = 5/2. Interestingly, Loschmidt echo [92, 93], another quantifier of chaos, did not show such sensitivity, and it took considerably larger angular momentum to show an exponential decay, indicating the underlying chaos [13].\nAgainst this backdrop, we look at the OE growth for small j. We see in Fig. (6) that OE shows an initial rise, and then it saturates for j = 7/2 and 9/2 at \u03ba = 3\u03c0/2, similar to its behaviour at larger quantum numbers. The growth of OE takes place in the preEhrenfest regime, within the first two time steps. Interestingly, OTOCs show revivals for small j values, as seen in Fig. (5). Post-Ehrenfest saturation in OTOCs is observed only at larger angular momenta. Hence, we conclude that the short-time growth of OE is a much more robust diagnostic tool to detect the degree of the chaoticity in a system even if j is small.\nWhile the short-time behaviour of OE and OTOC can be used to identify chaos in a quantum system, it can sometimes be deceptive. For example, OTOC can grow exponentially even when the classical counterpart of the system is not chaotic. The presence of local instabilities, like a saddle point, can mimic chaos-like behaviour in OTOCs [94]. Therefore, interpreting the exponential growth of OTOC with chaos is questionable.\nThe key to solving this problem is to look at the longterm dynamics. Kidd et al. recently demonstrated that studying the long-time behaviour of OTOCs can distinguish true chaos from saddle-dominated scrambling [95]. Their numerical study involved the Bose-Hubbard dimer and a longer spin-chain model called the Dicke model. Using fidelity OTOCs (FOTOC), they showed that the expected saturation and convergence of the OTOC value is only seen in the chaotic regime. The post-Ehrenfest time behaviour of the saddle-dominated regime showed large oscillations, visibly distinguishing\n1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Time\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nlo g(\nAv g.\nOT OC\n)\n3/2 5/2 7/2 9/2\nFIG. 5: Growth of OTOC with time for small j values in the fully chaotic regime, \u03ba = 3\u03c0/2.

For OE to qualify as a genuine chaos indicator, it must pass this test.\nAt \u03ba = 2.5, the kicked top classical phase space is mixed, with regular and chaotic regions coexisting and admitting a saddle point at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2).

(16) taken with respect to the same coherent state. W\u0302\u03b4(0) is a perturbation, modeled as a small-\u03b4 rotation about X axis. The time evolution W\u0302\u03b4(t) = U\u0302\u2020(t)W\u0302\u03b4(0)U\u0302(t) is governed by the kicked-top floquet. In this case, Eqn. (16) reduces to\nFOTOC = 1 \u2212 | \u27e8\u03c8(\u03b8, \u03d5)| W\u0302\u03b4(t) |\u03c8(\u03b8, \u03d5)\u27e9 |2. (17)\nThe long-time behavior of FOTOC is plotted in Fig. (7a). It shows that a state |\u03c8(\u03b8, \u03d5)\u27e9 located at the saddle point behaves quite distinctly from a state (\u03c0/4, \u03c0/4), located in the chaotic region. The latter shows an exponential rise and smaller but persistent fluctuations\naround the saturation value. In contrast, the saddlepoint FOTOC leads to quantitatively larger oscillations post-Ehrenfest time, indicating near revivals of the initial state. The persistent fluctuations in the chaotic case suggest that the system does not entirely thermalize in the time frame considered [95]. Finally, we also study the long-time dynamics of observational entropy, starting from the saddle point (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and the same chaotic point (\u03c0/4, \u03c0/4). Figure (7b) shows that the behaviour is qualitatively very similar to that of FOTOC, indicating that OE is as good as FOTOC in distinguishing chaos from saddle-dominated scrambling."

            "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this work, we demonstrated how the OE behaves in the regular, mixed, and chaotic regime using a prototype model called quantum kicked top. First, we studied the variation of OE with coarse-graining length. After a critical coarse-graining length, we found that the Boltzmann term in the OE expression starts dominating in the regular regime. OE growth is logarithmic in coarse-graining length. On the other hand, in the chaotic regime, OE growth is much faster. Next, we focused on the dynamics and demonstrated that the short-time growth rate of OE can be used as a measure of the chaoticity in the system and compared our results with OTOC.\nMoreover, we showed that in the deep quantum regime, the results obtained from OE are much more robust than the OTOC results, making OE a superior candidate over OTOC to identify chaos in quantum systems. Finally, we also investigated the long-time behaviour of OE to distinguish between saddle pointdriven scrambling from chaotic scrambling. We found that the saddle point OE shows large, persistent fluctuations compared to the chaotic regime, which has also been observed in the FOTOC study. Further, it will be interesting to investigate the OE of finite quantum spin chains [98] that shows a crossover between integrability and non-integrability but has no classical counterpart, unlike the QKT model.\nThe emergence of the irreversible macroscopic world from the reversible laws of the microscopic world is an important issue both at its fundamental level and from the technological forefront [29, 99\u2013101]. The connection between the many-body quantum chaos and the foundations of statistical mechanics in terms of equilibration and thermalization is well known [99]. The OE can be expressed as a distance between prediction and retrodiction [79], which provides a quantitative base for the fluctuations relations and the laws of thermodynam-\n9 ics [82, 100, 102]. More studies in OE would reveal the deeper correlation between the laws of statistical thermodynamics and quantum chaos. As OE involves only local measurements, it can be easily experimentally implemented in current quantum computing hardware [47\u201365], and can be potentially used to study the destabilizing effect of chaos in quantum device control."
