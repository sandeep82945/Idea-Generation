    "abstractText": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have received considerable attention as a promising green solvent for extracting metal ions from aqueous solutions. However, the recycling of ILs remains difficult and challenging because of the leaching of ILs, which is caused by the ion exchange extraction mechanism and hydrolysis of ILs in acidic aqueous conditions. In this study, a series of imidazoliumbased ILs were confined in a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) material (UiO-66) to overcome the limitations when used in solvent extraction. The effect of the various anions and cations of the ILs on the adsorption ability of AuCl4 was studied, and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazole tetrafluoroborate ([HMIm][BF4]@UiO-66) was used for the construction of a stable composite. The adsorption properties and mechanism of [HMIm][BF4]@UiO-66 for Au(III) adsorption were also studied. The concentrations of tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]) in the aqueous phase after Au(III) adsorption by [HMIm][BF4]@UiO-66 and liquid\u2013liquid extraction by [HMIm][BF4] IL were 0.122 mg/L and 18040 mg/L, respectively. The results reveal that Au(III) coordinated with the N-containing functional groups, while [BF4] was effectively confined in UiO-66, instead of undergoing anion exchange in liquid\u2013liquid extraction. Electrostatic interactions and the reduction of Au(III) to Au(0) were also important factors determining the adsorption ability of Au(III). [HMIm][BF4]@UiO-66 could be easily regenerated and reused for three cycles without any significant drop in the adsorption capacity.",

            "text": "Ionic liquids (ILs) represent a class of environmentally friendly \u201cgreen\u201d solvents with unusual physical and chemical properties, such as a low vapor pressure and the absence of volatilization, and they can be used for the extraction of metal ions from aqueous solutions [1\u20139]. The most commonly proposed mechanism for the extraction of metal ions into the hydrophobic ionic liquid phase is ion exchange [2\u20139]. The simultaneous release of IL ions to the aqueous phase (resulting in IL losses and aqueous phase pollution) when metal ions are extracted into the IL phase has been reported in many cases. Moreover, the chemical stability of ILs has already aroused attention. The hydrolysis of fluorine-based anions of ILs has been reported. Fernandes and co-workers found that the hydrolysis of [BF4]\u2212 even occurred at room temperature [10]. The hydrolysis of fluorine-based anions generates an abundance of toxic hydrofluoric acid (HF), which results in environmental pollution. Supported ionic liquids (SILs) are a new type of solid material prepared through physical adsorption, chemical bonding, or loading of ILs onto porous supports, and they have the characteristics of both ILs and carriers. The process can significantly improve the utilization of ILs, solve the problems of the high viscosity, separation, and mass transfer of ILs, and expand the application field of ILs. Various porous materials have been used as supports, such as covalent organic frameworks [11], porous celluloses [12,13], molecular sieves [14], magnetic materials [15], resins [16], porous silica [17], and biopolymers [18]. SILs have been widely used in various\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052165 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165 2 of 20\napplications, such as catalysis [19], adsorption separation [12,13,15\u201318], gas storage [14,20], and electrode materials [11]. However, the ion exchange mechanism is responsible for the adsorption of metal ions in SILs in many cases [13,16\u201318]. Immobilizing ILs in metal\u2013organic frameworks (symbolized as IL@MOFs) is favorable for the adsorption of metal ions from the aqueous phase because of the strong bond between ILs and MOFs, as reported in [19,21,22]. UiO-66 is a porous crystalline material with Zr2+ as the excess metal ion and terephthalic acid as the organic ligand. The Zr6 cluster ([Zr6O4(OH)4]) has 12 terephthalic acids (H2BDC), the maximum number of organic ligands and metal coordination clusters in MOFs. Compared with other MOFs, the dense structural unit and Zr-O property make UiO-66 the most stable porous material in aqueous solutions and other common solvents [23\u201327]. It possesses high thermal and mechanical stability, as well as good resistance to strong acids [28,29]. Moreover, UiO-66 contains tetrahedral and octahedral pore cages, and this 3D pore structure facilitates the dispersion of ILs [30]. The [Zr6O4(OH)4] metal ion clusters of UiO-66 are easily approached by the spherical anions of ILs, such as [BF4]\u2212 and hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]\u2212) [31]. Therefore, UiO-66, with a stable and well-defined structure, becomes a promising host material for immobilizing IL anions. Gold is valuable, and the recovery of Au(III) from waste CPUs has become attractive due to the limited availability of gold. Gold can be extracted from electronic waste technology via pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy [32]. The selectivity of pyrometallurgy is poor, the process is complex, the cost is high, and the generation of volatile metals and dust causes environmental pollution. Therefore, hydrometallurgy is the main method used to leach metals from e-waste [33]. Currently, commonly used methods for gold recovery from e-waste leaching solutions include solvent extraction [4,34], chemical precipitation [35], membrane separation [36], and adsorption [37\u201339]. In contrast, adsorption has the advantages of mild conditions, simple operation, low cost, and recyclability. Adsorption is the most economical and practical method for gold recovery, with great potential. Additionally, in solvent extraction, it is worth noting that ILs themselves extract [AuCl4]\u2212 through anion exchange. Based on the above, a study of gold recovery from waste CPUs using composite materials composed of ILs encapsulated in UiO-66 (ILs@UiO-66) was conducted. The composites combine the excellent physicochemical properties of ILs and the advantages of the high surface area and high porosity of UiO-66. However, the investigations on ILs@UiO-66 composites available thus far are mainly focused on examining the effect of the loading of ILs on their extraction performance, while the effects of stronger interactions of IL anions with UiO-66 are rarely explored. Therefore, in the current study, an effort was made to address this issue. We expect that the knowledge gained will not only contribute to a better understanding of the properties of ILs@UiO-66 composites for gold recovery, but will also be beneficial in providing guidance on how to overcome the limitations of ILs used in acidic conditions."

Previous studies have shown that UiO-66 is one of the most stable MOFs. It possesses high thermal and mechanical stability, as well as good resistance to strong acids [28]. The unique robustness of UiO-66 derives from the 12-coordinated Zr6 clusters that constitute the framework. It is built up from [Zr6O4(OH)4] units interlinked via terephthalate linkers, leading to a 3D porous framework with two types of cages, namely, tetrahedral and octahedral cages, with diameters of 8 and 11 \u00c5, respectively [22]. In order to select ionic liquids with an appropriate structure, the influence of the anions and cations of ILs on the Au(III) adsorption ability of ILs@UiO-66 was examined at first. Several ILs were transported into UiO-66, and their Au(III) adsorption ability was investigated, including [HMIm]+-based ILs with different anions (tetrafluoroborate [BF4]\u2212, hexafluorophosphate [PF6]\u2212, acetate [OAc]\u2212, and bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide [NTf2]\u2212) and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165 3 of 20\n[BF4]\u2212-based ILs with different cations (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium [EMIm]+, 1-butyl-3methylimidazole [BMIm]+, [HMIm]+, and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium [OMIm]+).

The specific surface area and porous structures of UiO\u221266 and [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266 were investigated via nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves. The surface morphology of UiO\u221266 before and after IL loading was observed via SEM. Figure S1a, b show the SEM images of UiO\u221266 and [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266, indicating that no detectable IL phase formed on the surface of UiO\u221266 [42]. A large number of irregularly rounded particles can be found closely attached to the characterized surfaces of UiO\u221266 and [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266, and this rough surface can enhance the adsorption capacity. This is the same form as previously reported for UiO\u221266 [25]. At the same time, many pores and voids can be observed in Figure S1, and this porous tertiary structure is beneficial for the following adsorption performance. The dimensions of both samples are the same, indicating that the morphological characteristics of the samples are the same before and after synthesis. To confirm the successful immobilization of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 in UiO\u221266, FT\u2212IR was performed. The FT\u2212IR spectra of UiO\u221266 and [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266 are shown in Figure 2a. The band at 1581 cm\u22121 in the spectra of UiO\u221266 and [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266 is due to the stretching vibration of the C=O bond on the BDC, the appearance of the characteristic band at 1398 cm\u22121 indicates the typical framework vibration of the benzene ring, and the stretching vibrations of the Zr\u2212O and Zr\u2212O2 bonds are indicated by the bands at 747 cm\u22121 and 663 cm\u22121 [26,27], which indicate the successful synthesis of UiO\u221266. The strong band at 1105 cm\u22121 can be attributed to C\u2212N stretching, and the band at 1296 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the imidazole ring stretching [42], which indicates the successful sequestration of IL onto UiO\u221266. The powder XRD patterns of UiO\u221266 and [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266 are shown in Figure 2b. The prominent characteristic peaks of UiO\u221266 are located at 2\u03b8 = 7.5\u00b0, 8.5\u00b0, and 25.8\u00b0, which are consistent with the UiO\u221266 patterns in the literature [20,26,29,42]. In addition, [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266 has the same typical peaks and intensities, indicating that the IL\u2212supported UiO\u221266 crystal pore cage structure remains intact. However, there are no characteristic peaks of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 in the XRD pattern of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO\u221266, probably because [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 is entrapped in the framework of UiO\u221266 and there is no crystalline phase of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 to be detected.\nFigure 1.

The extractability of AuCl4\u2212 was found to be greater f r ILs composed of more hydrophilic anions and more hydr phobic cations [13,41]. In this work, with the [HMIm]+ cation, the Au(III) adsorption ability of ILs/ -\nas in the order of [BF4]\u2212 > [OAc]\u2212 > [PF6]\u2212 > [NTf2]\u2212 , while with the [BF4]\u2212 anion, it was in the order of [HMIm]+ > [OMIm]+ > [BMIm]+ > [EMIm]+. These results are roughly related to the hydrophilicity f the anions and hydrophobicity of the cations. The hydrophilicity of the used anions in our work decreased in the order of [OAc]\u2212 > [BF4]\u2212 > [PF6]\u2212 > [NTf2]\u2212 , and the hydrophob city of the cations decreased in the o de of [OMIm]+ > [HMIm]+ > [BMIm]+ > [EMIm]+. Therefore, ILs composed\nf more hydrophilic anions and hydrophobic cations are more co ducive to adsorbing Au(III), except for [OAc]\u2212 , [BF4]\u2212 , [OMIm]+, and [HMIm]+. For [OAc]\u2212 an [BF4]\u2212, the quasi\u2212spherical structure of the [BF4]\u2212 anion allows it to fit more closely in the Zr sites of UiO-66 than [OAc]\u2212, which has a chain-like structure [31]. As a result of this, the Au(III) adsorption ability showed the order of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 > [HMIm]+[OAc]\u2212@UiO-66. Hence, the effect of anions on the adsorption ratio of Au(III) resulted from the hydrophilic effect in combination with the anionic structure. For [OMIm]+ and [HMIm]+, considering the very large [OMIm]+ cation transported into UiO-66 cavities, it is possible to block the pores of UiO-66, resulting in difficult Au(III) adsorption [42]. Thus, the effect of cations on the adsorption ratio of Au(III) was caused by the hydrophobic effect in combination with the cationic size. Since [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 showed the best adsorption result, the rest of the study was carried out with this adsorbent. Subsequently, the influence of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 IL loading on the adsorption ratio of Au(III) was investigated (by conducting experiments on the synthesis of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO66 with different mass ratios of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 to UiO-66). UiO-66 was loaded with [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 from [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212-ethanol solutions. As reported, the IL mass in the solution is essentially proportional to the IL loading in the MOF pores [43]. Thus, the investigations of the effect of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 loading were conducted by varying the mass ratio of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 to UiO-66 in ethanol solutions. As shown in Figure 1c, with an increase in the mass ratio of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212, the adsorption ratio of Au(III) increased at first and then decreased when the mass ratio was higher than 40%. The maximum adsorption ratio maintained above 95% was achieved at medium loadings, when the mass\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165 4 of 20\nratio of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 was 40%. At low [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 loadings, incorporating more ILs into UiO-66 provided more sites that can interact with Au(III); thus, the adsorption ability increased. At high [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 loadings, where the percentage of the free volume of the adsorbent decreased when more ILs were transported into UiO-66, the pore blockage hindered the passage of gold ions [16,43]."

            "text": "2.3.1. The Anion Influence on Adsorption In liquid\u2013liquid extraction, ILs extract [AuCl4]\u2212 through the anion exchange mechanism [3\u20138,44]. A series of SILs as adsorbents have been developed; however, the anion exchange mechanism is responsible for the adsorption of [AuCl4]\u2212 [13,16,18]. The loss of IL anions not only leads to water pollution, but also challenges the regeneration of ILs. By introducing an IL into the porous framework of an MOF, it has been reported that the interionic interactions become stronger due to the interaction of the anions of the IL with the metal sites of the MOF, and the direct interaction between the imidazolium ring of the IL with either the MOF or the anion of the IL [21]. Another computational study concluded that anions of ILs ([NTf2]\u2212, [PF6]\u2212, [BF4]\u2212, and [SCN]\u2212) have a stronger interaction than [BMIm]+ cations with MOFs. Thus, UiO-66 possesses application potential in avoiding the anion exchange mechanism because of the interactions between IL anions and the Zr atoms of UiO-66. ILs with [PF6]\u2212 or [NTf2]\u2212 anions are more widely used in the liquid\u2013liquid extraction of metal ions, despite their higher cost compared to ILs with [BF4]\u2212 anions [1,2,4\u20138]. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165 6 of 20\napplications of [BF4]\u2212 ILs in the extraction of metal ions are limited due to the higher water miscibility compared to ILs with [PF6]\u2212 or [NTf2]\u2212. To figure out whether UiO-66 can effectively confine [BF4]\u2212 to restrain the exchange process of [BF4]\u2212 with [AuCl4]\u2212 and the dissolution of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 in water, the concentrations of [BF4]\u2212 in the aqueous phase after [AuCl4]\u2212 adsorption or liquid\u2013liquid extraction were quantified. An amount of 150ppm of [AuCl4]\u2212 at pH = 2 was used for the study at first. The adsorption of [AuCl4]\u2212 by [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 and the liquid\u2013liquid extraction of [AuCl4]\u2212 by [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 IL itself were performed under the same conditions (c Au(III) = 60 mg/L, V Au(III) = 10 mL, T = 35 \u25e6C, t = 6 h). The ion chromatograms for [BF4]\u2212 in the aqueous phase are shown in Figure S3. When the adsorption and extraction ratios of Au(III) were 78.85% and 96.84%, the [BF4]\u2212 concentrations in the aqueous phase were 0.122 mg/L and 18,040 mg/L, respectively. Although [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 IL has a higher enrichment efficiency for Au(III), there was almost a 45% loss of the IL composed of [BF4]\u2212 from the IL phase into the aqueous phase, leading to serious environmental pollution and difficult reuse of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212. Meanwhile, there were only ultra-trace amounts of [BF4]\u2212 found in the aqueous phase after the adsorption of Au(III) by immobilizing [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212 on UiO-66. Obviously, the loss of [BF4]\u2212 was restrained because [BF4]\u2212 anions were effectively confined in UiO-66 cages as we initially expected.\nTo further explore the stronger interaction between UiO-66 and the anions of [BF4]\u2212\nIL, the effect of [BF4]\u2212 concentrations on Au(III) adsorption was investigated. As shown in Figure 4, the adsorption ratio of Au(III) decreased significantly from 83.72% to 17.10% with increasing [BF4]\u2212 concentrations from 0 to 0.01 mol/L. The effect of [BF4]\u2212 concentrations can be understood by considering the stronger interaction between the [BF4]\u2212 anions and Zr4+ metal sites in UiO-66. The adsorbent preferred to adsorb [BF4]\u2212 rather than [AuCl4]\u2212, which was mainly affected by the anion radius. [BF4]\u2212 with a smaller anionic radius (0.232 nm) is more conducive to transport into the pores of UiO-66. The increased amount of [BF4]\u2212 in the adsorbent occupied adsorption sites and pore channels in UiO-66; thus, the adsorption of Au(III) on [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 was significantly reduced.

The variation in the adsorption capacity with the initial Au(III) concentration at three temperatures (25, 30, and 35 \u25e6C) is shown in Figure 7b. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity increases with increasing initial Au(III) concentration. It can be adsorbed entirely at low concentrations because a sufficient number of adsorption sites are provided by the adsorbent. Due to the limited number of adsorption sites, the adsorption capacity tends to increase gradually and slowly with increasing Au(III) concentration, which leads to adsorption saturation. The obtained data were fitted and analyzed with the Langmuir model (Equation (4)), Freundlich model (Equation (5)), and Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (D\u2013R) model (Equation (6)). The Langmuir model assumes [54] that adsorption is monolayer adsorption on a uniform surface, and that the adsorption and desorption are in dynamic equilibrium. The Freundlich isotherm model assumes [55] that adsorption is multilayer adsorption and occurs on heterogeneous surfaces. The D\u2013R isotherm model assumes [56] that the adsorption process is not layer-by-layer adsorption on the adsorbent surface but related to the micropore volume.\nce qe = 1 KLqm + ce qm , (4)\nln qe = ln KF + 1 n ce, (5)\nln qe = ln qm \u2212 \u03b2\u03b5 2, \u03b5 = RT ln\n( 1 +\n1 ce\n) , (6)\nwhere KL(L/mg) is the Langmuir constant related to the affinity of the binding site, KF((mg/g)/(L/mg)1/n) shows the Freundlich constant associated with the adsorption strength, qm (mg/g) and n express the highest adsorption capacity and the coefficient of the Freundlich model, respectively, \u03b2 represents the D\u2013R isotherm constant, R represents the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K), and T represents the temperature (K). The separation factor (RL) describes the basic characteristics and feasibility of the Langmuir isotherm:\nRL = 1\n1 + KLc0 (7)\nThe experimental results were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and D\u2013R models, and the parameters obtained are shown in Figure 9a\u2013i and Table 2. The results show that the adsorption isotherms of Au(III) were more consistent with the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.995, 0.91634, 0.92302), and the theoretical maximum adsorption amounts of Au(III) at the three temperatures were 109.89, 142.05, and 279.33 mg/g, which are very close to the actual maximum adsorption amounts of 111.57, 160.77, and 284.64 mg/g, indicating that the adsorption of Au(III) is monolayer adsorption at a specific homogeneous location on the adsorbent surface [47,48,57]. Moreover, the RL values of Au(III) in the Langmuir model were all below 1, which indicates that the adsorption is appropriate [53]. In addition, the maximum adsorption of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 (284.64 mg/g) was higher than that of UiO-66 (203.42 mg/g) (see SI for detailed results).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165 12 of 20Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 21\nFigure 9.

Generally, 10 mg [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 was added into a 50 mL plastic centrifugal tube containing 10 mL Au(III) solution with different concentrations at pH 2. The solution was shaken in a constant oscillator at 170 rpm for the desired duration, and then the mixture was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter membrane to separate the adsorbent from the aqueous phase. Adsorption experiments were performed under optimized parameters (oscillation frequency: 170 rpm; t: 6 h; pH: 2; T: 35\u25e6C; V Au(III): 10 mL) unless otherwise indicated. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2165 17 of 20\neffect of pH was studied in the pH range of 1\u20139 (adjusted by adding diluted NaOH or HCl solutions). The experiment of the adsorption kinetics was carried out at different adsorption times ranging from 0 to 360 min. In contrast, the experiment of the adsorption isotherms was evaluated at different initial Au(III) concentrations ranging from 0 to 600 mg/L. The thermodynamic experiment was studied by controlling the temperature (from 298 to 308 K). The selectivity of the adsorbent for Au(III) was studied with different concentrations of Au(III) in the hybrid solution prepared by dissolving HAuCl4, MgCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, PbCl2, FeCl3, and NiCl2 in DI water. With initial Au(III) concentrations of 10 and 100 mg/L, the mass ratios of Au(III) to coexisting ions were 1:150 and 1:1, respectively. The effect of anions was examined in the presence of Cl\u2212, SO42\u2212, PO43\u2212, and NO3\u2212, and the concentrations were set to 0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mol/L.\nLiquid\u2013liquid extraction experiments were performed by adding 1 mL [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212\nto 10 mL of 150 mg/L Au(III) solution for 6 h with shaking under optimized parameters. After centrifugation (3000 r/min) of the mixed solution for 5 min, the aqueous was taken for measurement. The regeneration experiment of [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 was implemented as follows: 20 mg [HMIm]+[BF4]\u2212@UiO-66 was mixed to 20 mL Au(III) aqueous solution (60 mg/L) at pH 2. Then, the mixed solution was shaken for 6 h at 35 \u25e6C and was separated by highspeed centrifugation (8000 r/min). The supernatant was tested to obtain the remaining Au(III) concentration. The residual solid was immersed for about 12 h with 20 mL 1 mol/L HCl and 5% thiourea solution (the gold was eluted into an acid thiourea solution), rinsed three times with DI water, and executed to the second time of adsorption\u2013desorption cycle. The adsorption capacity and ratio of Au(III) were calculated using the following equations:\nq = (c0 \u2212 ce)\nm V, (11)\nAdsorption ratio = c0 \u2212 ce\nc0 \u00d7 100% , (12)\nwhere q (mg/g) is the Au(III) adsorption capacity, c0 and ce (mg/L) are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of Au(III) in solution, respectively, m (mg) is the mass of the adsorbent used, and V (mL) is the volume of the Au(III) solution."
