    "abstractText": "Boundary value problems for diffusion in singularly perturbed domains (domains with small holes removed from the interior) is a topic of considerable current interest. Applications include intracellular diffusive transport and the spread of pollutants or heat from localized sources. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method for characterizing the approach to steady-state in the case of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. This was based on a local measure of the relaxation rate known as the accumulation time T (x). The latter was calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space using a combination of matched asymptotics and Green\u2019s function methods. We thus obtained an asymptotic expansion of T (x) in powers of \u03bd = \u22121/ ln \u01eb, where \u01eb specifies the relative size of the holes. In this paper, we develop the corresponding theory for three-dimensional (3D) diffusion. The analysis is a non-trivial extension of the 2D case due to differences in the singular nature of the Laplace transformed Green\u2019s function. In particular, the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the 3D diffusion equation in Laplace space involves terms of order O((\u01eb/s)n), where s is the Laplace variable. These s-singularities have to be removed by partial series resummations in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of T (x) in powers of \u01eb.",

            "text": "There is considerable current interest in solving boundary value problems (BVPs) for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) diffusion in singularly perturbed domains, where small holes or perforations are removed from the interior [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Applications range from modeling intracellular diffusion, where interior holes could represent subcellular structures such as organelles or biochemical substrates, to tracking the spread of chemical pollutants or heat from localized sources. Roughly speaking, one can divide the various BVPs into two distinct groups. The first treats the holes as totally or partially absorbing traps, and the main\nfocus is determining the first passage time or splitting probability for a single particle to be captured by an interior trap (narrow capture). The second treats the holes as localized sources or reflecting obstacles, and now one is interested in calculating the steady-state solution (if it exists) and the rate of approach to steady state. Both types of BVP can be solved using a combination of matched asymptotic analysis and Green\u2019s function methods. This involves obtaining an inner or local solution of the diffusion equation that is valid in a small neighborhood of each hole, and then matching to an outer or global solution that is valid away from each neighborhood. The matching requires taking into account the singular nature of the associated Green\u2019s function. However, the details of the matched asymptotic analysis in 2D and 3D domains differ considerably due to corresponding differences in the Green\u2019s function singularities. That is, as |x\u2212 x0| \u2192 0,\nG(x|x0) \u2192 \u2212 1\n2\u03c0D ln |x\u2212 x0| in 2D G(x|x0) \u2192\n1\n4\u03c0D|x\u2212 x0| in 3D. (1)\nConsequently, an asymptotic expansion of the solution to a BVP in 3D is in powers of \u01eb, where \u01eb represents the size of a hole relative to the size of the bulk domain. On the other hand, an analogous expansion in 2D is in powers of \u03bd = \u22121/ ln \u01eb at O(1) in \u01eb. The slower convergence of \u03bd in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 can be dealt with by summing the logarithmic terms non-perturbatively [1, 2].\nIn a recent paper [16], we introduced and analyzed a new quantity for characterizing the rate of relaxation to steady-state in a 2D singularly perturbed domain containing circular holes, based on the so-called accumulation time. The latter is a local measure of the rate of relaxation that has been used extensively within the context of diffusion-based morphogenesis [17, 18, 19, 20]. (Previous studies of singularly perturbed BVPs have considered a global measure of the relaxation rate that is identified with the principal eigenvalue of the Laplacian [1, 2, 5].) The accumulation time was calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space, which yielded an asymptotic expansion of the accumulation time in powers of \u03bd. In this paper, we develop the corresponding theory for diffusion in 3D singularly perturbed domains containing spherical holes. The analysis is a non-trivial extension of the 2D case due to differences in the singular nature of the Laplace transformed Green\u2019s function with respect to the limits x \u2192 x0 and s \u2192 0, where s is the Laplace variable. In particular, the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the 3D diffusion equation in Laplace space involves terms of order O((\u01eb/s)n). These s-singularities have to be removed by partial series resummations in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the accumulation time in powers of \u01eb. Surprisingly, in spite of significant differences in the analyses, we find that the O(1/\u01eb) and O(1) contributions to the accumulation time are formally identical to the corresponding terms in 2D under the mappings (from 3D to 2D) 4\u03c0D \u2192 2\u03c0D and \u01eb\u2113j \u2192 \u03bdj \u2261 \u22121/ln \u01eb\u2113j, where \u01eb\u2113j is the radius of the jth hole.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we formulate the general problem of diffusion in a 3D singularly-perturbed domain \u2126 and define the\nassociated accumulation time in terms of the Laplace transform of the concentration. The accumulation time is calculated in section 3 by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space using a combination of matched asymptotic analysis and Green\u2019s function methods. Our results are compared with those previously obtained in 2D. In section 4, we relate our analysis to an alternative approach based on an eigenfunction expansion. Finally, in section 5, we illustrate the theory by considering holes in a spherical domain, for which the associated Green\u2019s function is known explicitly."

The volume of each hole is taken to be |Uj | \u223c \u01eb3|\u2126|, 0 < \u01eb \u226a 1, with Uj \u2192 xj \u2208 \u2126 uniformly as \u01eb \u2192 0, j = 1, . . . , N . In addition, the holes are assumed to be well separated with |xi \u2212 xj | = O(1), j 6= i, and dist(xj , \u2202\u2126) = O(1) for all j = 1, . . . , N . For simplicity, we take each hole to be a sphere with |x\u2212xj | = \u01eb\u2113j. We impose a Neumann boundary condition on the external boundary \u2202\u2126 and inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interior boundaries \u2202Uj .

(2b)\nHere n is the outward unit normal at a point on \u2202\u2126. Finally, we impose the initial condition u(x, 0) = \u03930\u03b4(x\u2212 x0) (2c) for some x0 \u2208 \u2126\\Ua, where \u03930 is the initial number of molecules introduced into the domain.\nLet\nZ(x, t) = 1\u2212 u(x, t) u\u2217(x)\n(3)\nbe the fractional deviation of the concentration from steady state. In order to ensure that there is no overshooting (reversal in the sign of Z(x, t)), we impose the condition\n\u03930 |\u2126| < \u03a6j for all j = 1, . . . , N. (4)\nThen 1 \u2212 Z(x, t) represents the fraction of the steady-state concentration that has accumulated at x by time t, and \u2212\u2202tZ(x, t)dt is the fraction accumulated in\nthe interval [t, t+dt].

            "text": "lation time in 3D\nThe goal of this paper is to derive an asymptotic expansion of the accumulation time (6) in powers of \u01eb. We will proceed along analogous lines to studies of the 3D narrow capture problem [6, 8, 15], deriving an inner or local solution of equations (7) that is valid in an O(\u01eb) neighborhood of each hole, and then matching to an\nouter or global solution that is valid away from each neighborhood. However, as previously highlighted in Ref. [15], the resulting asymptotic expansion of the solution in Laplace space results in terms of order O((\u01eb/s)n). Therefore, we will have to remove these s-singularities in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the accumulation time in the limit s \u2192 0.\nThe outer solution is constructed by shrinking each domain Uj to a single point xj , see Fig. 1(b), and expanding according to\nu\u0303(x, s) \u223c \u03930G(x, s|x0) + \u01ebv\u03031(x, s) + \u01eb2v\u03032(x, s) + . . . ,\nwhere G is the 3D Neumann Green\u2019s function, see equation (8), and\nD\u22072v\u0303n \u2212 sv\u0303n = 0, x \u2208 \u2126\\{x1, . . . ,xN}; \u2207v\u0303n \u00b7 n = 0, x \u2208 \u2202\u2126. (12)\nEquation (12) is supplemented by a corresponding set of singularity conditions as x \u2192 xj , j = 1, . . . , N , which are obtained by matching to the inner solution around each hole. Introducing the stretched local variable y = \u03b5\u22121(x\u2212xj) in a neighborhood of the jth hole, see Fig. 1(c), we set U(y, s) = u\u0303(xj + \u03b5y, s) with\nD\u22072 y U = \u01eb2sU, |y| > \u2113j , U(y, s) = \u03a6j s , |y| = \u2113j . (13)\nSubstituting the asymptotic expansion U \u223c U0 + \u01ebU1 + O(\u01eb2) into (13), we obtain the following pair of equations for the first two terms in the expansion:\nD\u22072 y U0(y, s) = 0, |y| > \u2113j ; U0(y, s) = \u03a6j s , |y| = \u2113j , (14a) D\u22072 y U1(y, s) = 0, |y| > \u2113j ; U1(y, s) = 0, |y| = \u2113j. (14b)\nThese are supplemented by far-field conditions obtained by matching with the near-field behavior of the outer solution. In order to perform this matching, we need to Taylor expand G(x, s|x0) near the j-th target and rewrite it in terms of stretched coordinates:\nG(x, s|x0) \u223c G(xj , s|x0) + \u01eb\u2207xG(xj , s|x0) \u00b7 y + . . . (15)\nFirst consider the leading order contribution to the inner solution. Matching the far-field behavior of U0 with the near-field behavior of \u03930G(x, s|x0) shows that U0 \u223c \u03930G(xj , s|x0) as |y| \u2192 \u221e. (16) Hence,\nU0 = \u03a6j s w(y) + \u03930G(xj , s|x0)(1 \u2212 w(y))), (17)\nwith w(y) satisfying the boundary value problem\n\u22072 y w(y) = 0, |y| > \u2113j ; w(y) = 1, |y| = \u2113j; w(y) \u2192 0 as |y| \u2192 \u221e. (18)\nIn the case of a spherical target of radius \u2113j, we have\nw(y) = \u2113j |y| . (19)\nIt now follows that v\u03031 satisfies equation (12) together with the singularity condition\nv\u03031(x, s) \u223c \u2113jVj(s)\n|x\u2212 xj | as x \u2192 xj ,\nwhere\nVj(s) = \u03a6j s \u2212 \u03930Gj0(s), Gj0(s) \u2261 G(xj , s|x0). (20)\nHence,\nv\u03031(x, s) = 4\u03c0D N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113jVj(s)G(x, s|xj). (21)\nThe next step is to match the far-field behavior of U1 with the O(\u01eb) term in the expansion of \u03930G(x, s|x0), see equation (15), together with the non-singular near-field behavior of v\u03031 around the j-th target. The latter takes the form\nv\u03031(x, s) \u223c \u2113jVj(s)\n|x\u2212 xj | + 4\u03c0D\nN\u2211\ni=1\n\u2113iVi(s)Gij(s).\nwith Gij(s) = G(xi, s|xj), j 6= i, Gjj(s) = R(xj , s|xj). (22)\nIt follows that\nU1(y, s) \u2192 \u2207xG(xj , s|x0) \u00b7 y + 4\u03c0D N\u2211\ni=1\n\u2113iVi(s)Gij(s) as |y| \u2192 \u221e. (23)\nThe first term on the right-hand side generates contributions to the inner solution in the form of first-order spherical harmonics [15]. Since these only affect the outer solution at O(\u01eb3), we neglect them here. We thus have\nv\u03031(x, s) = \u03c7 (1) j (s) ( 1\u2212 \u2113j|y| ) + higher-order harmonics (24)\nwith\n\u03c7 (1) j (s) = 4\u03c0D\nN\u2211\ni=1\n\u2113iVi(s)Gij(s). (25)\nFinally, v\u03032 satisfies equation (12) supplemented by the singularity condition\nv\u03032(x, s) \u223c \u2212 \u03c7 (1) j (s)\u2113j\n|x\u2212 xj | , as x \u2192 xj .\nUsing the same steps as in the derivation of v\u03031(x, s), we obtain the result\nv\u03032(x, s) = \u22124\u03c0D N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03c7 (1) j (s)G(x, s|xj). (26)\nIn summary, the outer solution has the asymptotic expansion\nu\u0303(x, s) \u223c \u03930G(x, s|x0) + 4\u03c0D N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j [ \u01ebVj(s)\u2212 \u01eb2\u03c7(1)j (s) + . . . ] G(x, s|xj).

(33)\nThe \u01eb-expansion in equation (33) indicates a potential problem in taking the limit s \u2192 0. More specifically, there exist terms involving factors of \u01eb/s that will become arbitrarily large in the small-s limit and thus lead to a breakdown of the \u01eb expansion. This issue was previously encountered in an analysis of first passage time problems in 3D singularly perturbed domains with small traps [15]. In the latter study, we calculated the Laplace-transformed flux into each trap, which acted as the generator for the first passage time moments in the limit s \u2192 0. In contrast to the analysis of steady-state problems for diffusion, where the goal is to calculate the outer solution in the bulk of the domain, the focus of narrow capture problems is the inner solution around each trap. Nevertheless, the methods developed in Ref. [15] can be adapted to eliminate the singularities in equation (33). That is, we proceed by treating equation (33), including higher-order terms, as a triple expansion in \u01eb, s and \u039b, with\n\u039b = 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u2113\u0304 s|U| , \u2113\u0304 = N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j. (34)\nThis then converts a subset of terms at O(\u01ebn) to O(\u01ebr\u039bn\u2212r) terms, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n. At each order of \u01eb, we obtain infinite power series in \u039b that can be summed to remove all singularities in the limit s \u2192 0. In order to illustrate the basic idea, consider the sum of the first terms on the second and third lines of equation (33). Inclusion of higher-order contributions leads to a geometric series in \u039b that can be summed explicitly:\nI1(\u039b) \u2261\n \u039b\n\u2113\u0304\n\u2211\nn\u22650\n(\u22121)n\u039bn   N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03a6\u0302j = 1\n\u2113\u0304\n\u039b\n1 + \u039b\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03a6\u0302j = \u039b\n1 + \u039b [\u03a6\u2212 \u0393/|\u2126|].\n(35) Similarly, combining the last term on the second line of (33) with higher-order\ncontributions\n\u01ebI2(\u039b) \u2261  \u039b \u2211\nn\u22650\n(\u22121)n\u039bn   4\u03c0\u01ebD\u03930\n|\u2126|\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113jG(0)j0 = \u039b\n1 + \u039b 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u03930 |\u2126|\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113jG(0)j0 .\n(36) Finally, combining the middle term of the second line of equation (33) with high-order contributions yields\n\u01ebI3(\u039b) \u2261 \u2212  \u039b \u2211\nn\u22650\n(\u22121)n\u039bn   4\u03c0\u01ebD\n\u2113\u0304\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113k\u03a6\u0302k [ G0(x,xj) + G(0)kj ]\n+ \u039b2 \u2211\nm\u22650\n(m+ 1)(\u2212\u039b)m 4\u03c0\u01ebD \u2113\u03042\nN\u2211\ni,j,k=1\n\u2113i\u2113j\u2113k\u03a6\u0302iG(0)kj (37)\n= \u2212 \u039b 1 + \u039b 4\u03c0\u01ebD \u2113\u0304\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113k\u03a6\u0302k [ G0(x,xj) + G(0)kj ] +\n\u039b2\n(1 + \u039b)2 4\u03c0\u01ebD \u2113\u0304 [\u03a6\u2212 \u0393/|\u2126|]\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113kG(0)kj .\nWe have used the following results for geometric series:\n\u039b \u2211\nm\u22650\n(\u2212\u039b)m = \u039b(1\u2212 \u039b + \u039b2 . . .) = \u039b 1 + \u039b , (38a)\n\u039b2 \u2211\nm\u22650\n(m+ 1)(\u2212\u039b)m = \u039b2(1\u2212 2\u039b + 3\u039b2 . . .) = \u039b2 d d\u039b \u039b 1 + \u039b =\n\u039b2\n(1 + \u039b)2 .\n(38b)\nHaving performed the various partial summations, equation (33) can be rewritten in the more compact form\nsu\u0303(x, s) \u223c \u03930|\u2126|\n{ 1\u2212 4\u03c0\u01ebD N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113jG(0)j0 } + 4\u03c0\u01ebD N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03a6\u0302jG0(x,xj)\n+ I1(\u039b) + \u01ebI2(\u039b) + \u01ebI3(\u039b) + s { \u03930G0(x,x0) + 4\u03c0\u01ebD N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03a6\u0302jG1(x,xj)\n\u2212 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u03930 N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j[G(0)j0 G0(x,xj) + G (1) j0 /|\u2126|]\n} +O(\u01eb2, s2). (39)\nWe can now safely take the limit s \u2192 0 for fixed \u01eb > 0 in equations (35)\u2013(37), since \u039b \u2192 \u221e and \u039b/(1 + \u039b) \u2192 1. We thus obtain the following asymptotic expansion of the steady state to O(\u01eb):\nu\u2217(x) = lim s\u21920 su\u0303(x, s) \u223c \u03930|\u2126| + 1 \u2113\u0304\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03a6\u0302j + 4\u03c0\u01ebD\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j\u03a6\u0302jG0(x,xj) (40)\n\u2212 1 \u2113\u0304\n{ 4\u03c0\u01ebD N\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113k\u03a6\u0302k [ G0(x,xj) + G(0)kj ]} + 4\u03c0\u01ebD\n\u2113\u0304\n1\n\u2113\u0304\nN\u2211\ni=1\n\u2113i\u03a6\u0302i\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113kG(0)kj .\nFinally, noting that \u03a6\u0302j = \u03a6j\u2212\u03930/|\u2126|, we see that any dependence on the initial distribution u(x, 0) = \u03930\u03b4(x\u2212 x0) vanishes and\nu\u2217(x) \u223c \u03a6+ 4\u03c0\u01ebD N\u2211\nj=1\n\u2113j[\u03a6j \u2212 \u03a6]G0(x,xj)\u2212 4\u03c0\u01ebD\n\u2113\u0304\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113k[\u03a6k \u2212 \u03a6]G(0)kj +O(\u01eb2)\n(41)\nwith \u03a6 = \u2113\u0304\u22121 \u2211N\nj=1 \u2113j\u03a6j . Equation (41) is identical to the result obtained by directly solving the steady-state diffusion equation using matched asymptotics [6, 8]. However, the advantage of working in Laplace space is that one can also calculate the accumulation time."

            "text": "In our previous paper [16], we developed an analogous asymptotic analysis of the accumulation time T (x) for diffusion in 2D singularly perturbed domains.\nHowever, the details of the matched asymptotic analysis differed considerably from the 3D case, reflecting differences in the singular nature of the modified Helmholtz Green\u2019s function, see equation (1). Consequently, in 2D we obtained an asymptotic expansion of T (x) in powers of \u03bd = \u22121/ ln \u01eb at O(1) in \u01eb. On the other hand, taking the small-s limit was relatively straightforward. Surprisingly, in spite of significant differences in the analyses, the O(1/\u01eb) and O(1) contribution to T (x) in equation (47) are formally identical to the corresponding terms in 2D under the mappings (from 3D to 2D)\n4\u03c0D \u2192 2\u03c0D, \u01eb\u2113j \u2192 \u03bdj \u2261 \u2212 1\nln \u01eb\u2113j , \u01eb\u2113\u0304 \u2192\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u03bdj ,\nsee equations (4.34)\u2013(4.37) of Ref. [16]. As originally shown by Ward and Keller [1] within the context of 2D and 3D eigenvalue problems, it is possible to generalize the asymptotic analysis of the accumulation time to more general hole shapes such as ellipsoids by applying classical results from electrostatics. For example, given a general shape Uj \u2282 R3, the solution to equation (14a) is given by equation (17) with w(y) having the far-field behavior\nw(y) \u223c Cj|y| + Pj \u00b7 y |y|3 + . . . as |y| \u2192 \u221e. (50)\nHere Cj is the capacitance and Pj the dipole vector of an equivalent charged conductor with the shape Uj . (For a sphere, Cj = \u2113j and Pj = 0). It turns out that the O(\u01eb) and O(\u01eb2) contributions to the accumulation time only depend on Cj so that equation (47) still holds on making the replacements \u2113j \u2192 Cj for j = 1, . . . , N . Similarly, in 2D one simply sets \u03bdj = \u22121/ ln \u01ebdj with dj the associated logarithmic capacitance."

(65)\nThe inverse of the principal eigenvalue can be identified as a global measure of the relaxation rate [1, 6]:\n\u03c40 \u2261 1\n\u03bb0 = |\u2126| 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u2113\u0304\n 1 + 4\u03c0\u01ebD\n\u2113\u0304\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\n\u2113j\u2113kG(0)jk\n +O(\u01eb). (66)\nNote that, in contrast to the accumulation time, \u03c40 is independent of the initial density and the boundary values \u03a6j . As expected, \u03c40 \u2192 \u221e as \u01eb \u2192 0. One important advantage of the accumulation time, beyond the fact that it includes local information about the relaxation process, is that it can be calculated without recourse to a spectral decomposition, and thus does nor rely on the existence of a sufficiently large spectral gap. However, one could use the eigenfunction\nexpansion to obtain an approximation of the accumulation time in terms of the principal eigenvalue and eigenfunction. That is, substituting equation (51) into (5) implies that\nT (x) = \u2212 1 u\u2217(x)\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u2211\nn\u22650\n\u03c6n(x)e \u2212\u03bbntdt = \u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\ncn\u03c6n(x) \u03bbnu\u2217(x) , (67)\nwhich is non-singular since \u03bbn > 0 for all n \u2265 0. Keeping only the first term in the series expansion then yields the truncated accumulation time\nT0(x) = \u2212 c0\u03c60(x)\n\u03bb0u\u2217(x) . (68)\nFor simplicity, consider the homogenous case \u03a6j = \u03a6 and \u2113j = \u2113 for all j = 1, . . . , N , such that u\u2217(x) = \u03a6. The principal eigenvalue and eigenfunction have the asymptotic expansions\n\u03bb0 = 4\u03c0\u01ebDN\u2113\n|\u2126|\n 1\u2212 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u2113\nN\nN\u2211\nj,k=1\nG(0)jk\n +O(\u01eb3), (69)\nand\n\u03c60(x) \u223c 1\u221a |\u2126| \u2212 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u2113\u221a |\u2126|\nN\u2211\nj=1\nG0(x,xj) +O(\u01eb 2) (70)\nIt remains to calculate the coefficient c0. Setting t = 0 in equation (51) gives\n\u03930\u03b4(x\u2212 x0)\u2212 \u03a6 = \u221e\u2211\nn=0\ncn\u03c6n(x). (71)\nMultiplying both sides by \u03c60(x), integrating with respect to x and imposing orthonormality of the eigenfunctions yields\nc0 = \u03930\u03c60(x0)\u2212 \u03a6 \u222b\n\u2126\n\u03c60(x)dx. (72)\nSubstituting the solution for \u03c60(x) and using the normalization condition \u222b \u2126G0(x|x0)dx = 0, we have\nc0 = \u03930 \u2212 |\u2126|\u03a6\u221a |\u2126| \u2212 4\u03c0\u01ebD\u2113\u221a |\u2126|\nN\u2211\nj=1\nG0(x0,xj) +O(\u01eb 2). (73)\nCombining our various results and comparing with equation (48) for the full accumulation time shows that\nT (x) \u223c T0(x) \u2212 \u03930 \u03a6 G0(x,x0) +O(\u01eb) (74)\nIt can be seen that the difference between the two is maximized in a neighborhood of the initial position x0. Again, we obtained an analogous result for the accumulation time in 2D up to O(\u03bd) [16]."

(78)\nIn Fig. 3 we show contour plots of the full accumulation time T (x), x = (x, y, z), in the x \u2212 y plane for several horizontal sections of the sphere (fixed z). In the plane containing the initial position x0 and the center x1 of the spherical hole, we see that there are two minima of T (x) located around the\npoints x0 and x1, respectively. Note that T (x) is singular at these points. The singularity in T (x) as x \u2192 x0 is a consequence of the initial condition involving a Dirac delta function. It is easily removed by taking the initial concentration to be a strongly localized Gaussian, for example. The singularity as x \u2192 x1 is due to the fact that we define T (x) in terms of the outer solution; it would be resolved by considering the corresponding inner solution. In Fig. 4 we present corresponding contour plots for the truncated accumulation time T0(x). The reduction in the dependence on the initial position x0 is clearly seen."

            "text": "In this paper, we continued the development of a method for characterizing the relaxation to a non-trivial steady state of a diffusion process, which is based on the notion of an accumulation time. The classical approach is to identify the relaxation rate with the principal non-zero eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian [1, 2]. However, this only yields a global measure of the relaxation rate, and loses all information about the initial position. Moreover, it relies on the existence of a sufficiently large spectral gap. The accumulation time, on the\nother hand, can be obtained by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space without any recourse to a spectral decomposition. (One can also consider an eigenfunction expansion of the accumulation time itself, but such an approximation still relies on a spectral gap.) Combining our analysis of diffusion in 3D singularly perturbed domains with our previous study of 2D diffusion [16] provides a solid foundation for investigating other relaxation processes in singularly perturbed domains. For example, one could consider more general exterior and interior boundary conditions, provided that there existed a unique steadystate solution. For example, modifying the exterior boundary condition would change the definition of the Green\u2019s function used in the outer solution, whereas changing the conditions on the hole boundaries would modify the inner solution and the corresponding singularity conditions for the outer solution. Another generalization, as indicated in section 3(c), would be to consider non-spherical hole shapes, provided that the corresponding shape capacitances could be determined [1, 2]. Finally, one could extend the underlying diffusion equation by including advection terms, for example.\nAnother class of non-trivial steady state arises within the context of diffusion under stochastic resetting. The simplest example of such a process is a Brownian particle whose position is reset randomly in time at a constant rate r (Poissonian resetting) to its initial position x0[21, 22, 23]. One major finding is that the probability density converges to a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) that maintains nonzero probability currents. In addition, the approach to the stationary state exhibits a dynamical phase transition, which takes the form of a traveling front that separates spatial regions for which the probability density has relaxed to the NESS from those where it has not. Since the trajectories contributing to the transient region are rare events, one can establish the existence of the phase transition by carrying out an asymptotic expansion of the exact solution [24]. It turns out that this transition can also be understood in terms of the spatial variation of the accumulation time for relaxation to the NESS [25]. That is, T (x) \u223c |x\u2212 x0|/ \u221a 4rD for |x\u2212 x0| \u226b \u221a D/r."
