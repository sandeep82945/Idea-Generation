In this study, the [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reactions of N-methyl-C-4-methyl phenyl-nitrone 1 and 2-propynamide 2, which have not been extensively studied before, were investigated using molecular electron density theory (MEDT) at the B3LYP/6\u2013311++G(d,p) level of theory. According to an electron localization function (ELF) study, N-methyl-C-4-methyl phenyl-nitrone 1 is a zwitterionic species with no pseudoradical or carbenoid centers. Conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) indices were used to predict the global electronic flux from the strong nucleophilic N-methyl-C-4-methyl phenylnitrone 1 to the electrophilic 2-propynamide 2 functions. The 32CA reactions proceeded through two pairs of stereoand regioisomeric reaction pathways to generate four different products: 3, 4, 5, and 6. The reaction pathways were irreversible owing to their exothermic characters: \u2212136.48, \u2212130.08, \u2212130.99, and \u2212140.81 kJ mol\u22121, respectively. The enthalpy of the 32CA reaction leading to the formation of cycloadduct 6 was lower compared with the other path owing to a slight increase in its polar character, observed through the global electron density transfer (GEDT) during the transition states and along the reaction path. A bonding evolution theory (BET) analysis showed that these 32CA reactions proceed through the coupling of pseudoradical centers, and the formation of new C-C and C-O covalent bonds did not begin in the transition states.",

Over the last decade, numerous conceptual DFT (density functional theory) studies have been published on nitrone cycloadditions to demonstrate the productive interaction between experimental discoveries and DFT-based selectivity predictions [2\u201310]. From this perspective, communications published after 2003 have indicated the changes in electron density during the cycloaddition process and categorized TACs and ethyne derivatives according to the absolute electrophilicity scale [11]. Many mechanisms have been proposed for 32CA reactions since 2003. Polar mechanisms, such as two-stage, one-step processes, were suggested for 32CA reactions of nitrones in 2014 and 2017 [12\u201315]. In 2016, Domingo proposed the \u201cmolecular electron density theory\u201d\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9102. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24109102 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9102 2 of 15\n(MEDT), highlighting the impact of electron density changes in the reactivity of organic reactions [16]. MEDT studies have characterized the mechanism of 32CA reactions via sequential bonding changes along one-step reactions instead of the conventional concerted pericyclic pathway as proposed by Woodward and Hoffman in 1969. Parr functions are defined to explain regioselectivity in polar reactions, and many 32CA reactions have a non-polar character. In 2014, Tang et al. reported on theoretical DFT studies to investigate the mechanism of reactions between 1,3-dialkynes and ammonia derivatives [17\u201320]. In 2018, Jasiski suggested the competition of one-step and two-step processes in polar nitrone 32CA reactions to nitroethenes [21]. Recent theoretical publications from 2017 and 2018 have shown nitrone-32CA reactions to be non-concerted, one-step processes with asynchronous bond generation [17,18,22]. These 32CA reactions show different reactivity profiles; pdr-type 32CA reactions are associated with a lower energy barrier and take place easily, while zw-type 32CA reactions show a high energy barrier that needs to be overcome through electrophilic\u2013nucleophilic interactions between the reactants [23]. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism and energetics of the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between N-methyl-C-4-methylphenyl-nitrone and 2-propynamide and to gain a better understanding of the electronic factors that control the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction. The study is significant as it contributes to the development of more efficient and selective synthetic routes for the production of biologically active isoxazolidine and isoxazoline derivatives. The article is organized into five sections: (1) The determination of the electronic structures of the reagents N-methyl-C-4-methyl phenylnitrone 1 and 2-propynamide 2 by analyzing the electron localization function (ELF) [24,25]; (2) a conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) study of the reagents in their ground state to understand the electronic flow between them [3,26]; (3) an examination of the energy profile through the potential energy surfaces (PES) in the gas phase, THF, dichloroethane, benzene, and toluene along the possible regioisomeric pathways, followed to determine the effect of solvent polarity on the energy profile, and the determination of the global electron density transfer (GEDT) at the transition states (TSs) to forecast their polar character [6,27\u201330]; (4) an analysis of the intermolecular interactions at the TSs using a topological analysis of the ELF [31,32]; and (5) an investigation of the energetically acceptable reaction pathway via the bonding evolution theory (BET) [33\u201335]."

            "text": "This subsection provides an analysis of the electronic structure of the reactants Nmethyl-C-4-methylphenyl-nitrone 1 and 2-propynamide 2 using the ELF and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods. This analysis is crucial to achieving our research objective of understanding the factors that affect the reactivity of the reactants and the mechanism of the chemical reaction. The ELF, developed by Becke and Edgecombe, provides a precise mathematical representation of the electronic structure of a chemical system. Silvi and Savin later extended it to describe three localization attractors, namely, the core, bonding, and non-bonding attractors, to classify different electronic regions in a chemical system. The core basins, C(x), are the topological subdivisions of the ELF gradient field that surround the atomic nuclei; the monosynaptic valence basins, V(X), correspond to the non-bonding electron density of the lone pair or pseudoradical center of atom X; and the disynaptic basins, V(X,Y), correspond to the bonding region between X and Y [24,25]. The ELF topological analysis proposed by Domingo categorizes the three-atom components (TACs) involved in 32CA reactions based on ELF, namely, the pseudodiradical, pseudo(mono)radical, carbenoid, and zwitterionic TACs [16,36,37].

Green-colored ones are the disynaptic basins, blue represents the protonated basins, and red is used to represent the monosynaptic basins. The attractor positions are represented as black spheres.\nTable 1 shows the respective values of ELF valence basin populations in average number of electrons. The ELF analysis of N-methyl-C-4-methylphenyl-nitrone 1 reveals the existence of the V(O1) monosynaptic basin, which integrates 5.89 e and corresponds to the non-bonding electron density of the O1 oxygen. The disynaptic basins, V(C3, N2), contain a total population of 3.9 e associated with the C3-N2 double bond, and a V(N2, O1) disynaptic basin incorporates 1.34 e, related to the N2-O1 single bond. Notably, N-methylC-4-methylphenyl-nitrone 1 lacks a pseudoradical or carbine center and is classified as a zwitterionic TAC. The identification of the disynaptic basins associated with the C3-N2 and N2-O1 bonds can provide valuable insights into the potential reactive sites of the molecules in a 32CA reaction.

Thus, the TAC N-methyl-C-4methylphenyl-nitrone 1 is softer and more prone to electron density deformation compared with 2-propynamide 2. The chemical hardness index (\u03b7) and electrophilicity index (\u03c9) are indicators of a molecule\u2019s ability to either receive or donate electrons, respectively. Conversely, the nucleophilicity index (N) indicates a molecule\u2019s electron-donating capacity. A higher value of N implies a stronger ability to donate electrons, while a lower value of \u03c9 indicates a stronger ability to accept electrons. In the studied reaction, the higher nucleophilicity of N-methyl-C-4-methylphenyl-nitrone 1 compared with 2-propynamide 2 suggests that the former is more likely to act as a nucleophile and donate electrons. This implies that the reaction may proceed through a nucleophilic addition mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic site of the other reactant. Overall, the CDFT indices are a valuable source of information regarding the electronic properties and reactivity of these reactants. This information can be utilized to predict the reaction mechanism and kinetics with precision."

Consequently, the electron density of the V(N2) monosynaptic basin is mostly from the C3\u2013N2 bonding region. Moreover, the ELF of TS1-en and TS1-ex shows the presence of the V(C3) monosynaptic basin, integrating 0.37 and 0.33 e, respectively, which is connected to the formation of a pseudoradical center at C3 and is absent in TS2-en and TS2-ex.

The depopulation of the C4\u2013C5 bonding area from 5.28 e in 2-propynamide 2 to 4.49, 4.52, 4.50, and 4.38 e at the TSs establishes a pseudoradical center at C4, as shown by the existence of monosynaptic basin V(C4) integrating 0.59, 0.62, 0.73, and 0.76 e, respectively, at TS1-en, TS1-ex, TS2-en, and TS2-ex. At the ortho- and meta-TSs, the formation of a new single covalent bond has not yet begun; this was confirmed by computing the Wiberg bond index according to an NBO analysis [40] (see Supplementary Materials file).

This phase is distinguished by the emergence of a new V(C5) monosynaptic basin with an initial population of 0.30 e (as documented in Table 5). Notably, the formation of the first C3\u2013C4 single bond originates from the interplay of the pseudoradical centers at C3 and C4. It is also worth noting that, during this phase, the monosynaptic basins of V(C3) and V(C4) are absent, leading to a decline in the population of the C4\u2013C5 bonding area from 4.49 e at P3-I to 4.02 e at P4-I.

The formation of the second O1\u2013C5 single bond in this phase arises because of the merging of the pseudoradical center at C5 with a portion of the non-bonding electron density from the V(O) oxygen.

The ELF topological investigation of the ground state structures classified N-methyl-C-4-methyl phenylnitrone 1 as a zwitterionic TAC, indicating its participation in zw-type 32CA reactions that require suitable electrophilic\u2013nucleophilic interactions. By comparing the electronic chemical potentials and nucleophilic strengths of Nmethyl-C-4-methyl phenyl-nitrone 1 and 2-propanamide 2, the global electron flow was predicted. This prediction was subsequently validated through GEDT calculations at the TSs, indicating that the 32CA reactions possessed negative free energy and were exergonic. Furthermore, the experimental regioselectivity was reflected in the higher thermodynamic stability of cycloadducts 3 and 6 compared with 4 and 5. BET analysis along the regioisomeric reaction channels allows for some significant mechanistic results. Along both reaction pathways, the C=N bonding region of N-methylC-4-methylphenylnitrone 1 and the triple bond bonding region of 2-propanamide 2 are depopulated in the first four phases to form pseudoradical centers at the C3, C4, and C5 carbons and lone pair electron density at the N2 nitrogen. ELF studies of the TSs further showed early TSs along the ortho- and meta-pathways before the formation of a new single covalent bond began. These findings provide a more profound comprehension of the mechanism of this type of reaction, which is valuable for designing more efficient and selective synthetic processes in organic chemistry.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms24109102/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: S.A.M.S. and H.A.M.-S. performed the work and wrote the main content; J.V.d.J.-O., H.A.M.-S. and H.A.B. supervised and revised the manuscript.
