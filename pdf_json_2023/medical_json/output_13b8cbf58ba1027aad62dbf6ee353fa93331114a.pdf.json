    "abstractText": "Background The prognostic management of bladder cancer (BLCA) remains a great challenge for clinicians. Recently, bulk RNA-seq sequencing data have been used as a prognostic marker for many cancers but do not accurately detect core cellular and molecular functions in tumor cells. In the current study, bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were combined to construct a prognostic model of BLCA. Methods BLCA scRNA-seq data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Bulk RNA-seq data were obtained from the UCSC Xena. The R package \"Seurat\" was used for scRNA-seq data processing, and the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were utilized for downscaling and cluster identification. The FindAllMarkers function was used to identify marker genes for each cluster. The limma package was used to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affecting overall survival (OS) in BLCA patients. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify BLCA key modules. The intersection of marker genes of core cells and genes of BLCA key modules and DEGs was used to construct a prognostic model by univariate Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analyses. Differences in clinicopathological characteristics, immune microenvironment, immune checkpoints, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity between the high and low-risk groups were also investigated. Results scRNA-seq data were analyzed to identify 19 cell subpopulations and 7 core cell types. The ssGSEA showed that all 7 core cell types were significantly downregulated in tumor samples of BLCA. We identified 474 marker genes from the scRNA-seq dataset, 1556 DEGs from the Bulk RNA-seq dataset, and 2334 genes associated with a key module identified by WGCNA. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of 3 signature genes, namely MAP1B, PCOLCE2, and ELN. The feasibility of the Zhiyong Tan, Xiaorong Chen, Jieming Zuo and Shi Fu contributed equally to this work.

Journal of Translational Medicine (2023) 21:223 model was validated by an internal training set and two external validation sets. Moreover, patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor OS, a larger prevalence of stage III-IV, a greater TMB, a higher infiltration of immune cells, and a lesser likelihood of responding favorably to immunotherapy. Conclusion By integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, we constructed a novel prognostic model to predict the survival of BLCA patients. The risk score is a promising independent prognostic factor that is closely correlated with the immune microenvironment and clinicopathological characteristics.",

            "text": "Bladder cancer (BLCA), referred to as urothelial carcinoma, is one of the most common incident urological malignancies with more than 90% originating in the uroepithelium. It is estimated that more than 550,000 new cases are diagnosed and more than 200,000 deaths per year [1]. It has become the fourth and tenth most common malignancy among men and women, respectively [2]. There are two main types of BLCA pathologically, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Approximately 75% of patients initially present with NMIBC while the remaining 25% are diagnosed with MIBC [3]. The evidence-based guideline recommends radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy as the mainstay of treatment for patients with high-risk NMIBC or MIBC [4]. Although patients receive aggressive treatment including surgery, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate remains unsatisfactory, with a median OS of approximately 14\u00a0months [5]. Reasons for this poor prognosis include delay in diagnosis and the lack of effective therapy. But most importantly, the unsatisfactory prognosis was closely related to the aggressive and highly proliferative capacity of cancer cells, as well as the heterogeneity of disease characteristics. Therefore, there is a compelling urge to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in tumourigenesis and thereby explore novel potential molecular biomarkers, which are essential for the early diagnosis, targeted therapy, and prognostic assessment of BLCA patients.\nWith the rapid development of cancer genomics in recent decades, bulk transcriptome sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) has become a major tool for transcriptomics, and more and more gene alteration has been identified as an effective treatment target for BLCA [6]. For instance, Xie et\u00a0al. found exonic circular circPTPRA could inhibit cancer progression through endogenous blocking of the recognition of IGF2BP1 to m6A-modified RNAs [7]. In addition, Yang et\u00a0al. indicated that exosome-derived circTRPS1 could modulate the intracellular reactive oxygen species balance and CD8+ T cell exhaustion via the circTRPS1/miR141-3p/GLS1 axis in BLCA [8]. However, in contrast to bulk RNA-seq or microarray experiments,\nwhich probe average gene expression in cell populations. Currently, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) elucidates information about cellular transcriptomic heterogeneity, allowing us to access underlying gene expression distributions [9, 10]. Using scRNA-seq, we can develop personalized therapeutic strategies that are potentially useful in cancer diagnosis and therapy resistance during cancer progression [11]. Xu et\u00a0al. integrative analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq revealed CXCL14 as a key regulator of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which improves our understanding of the mechanism of tumor metastasis [12]. Besides, Obradovic A et\u00a0 al. demonstrated that HNCAF-0/3 could reduce TGF\u03b2dependent PD-1+TIM-3+ exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, increase CD103+NKG2A+ resident memory phenotypes, and enhance the overall cytolytic profile of T cells [13]. Given this advantage, numerous studies have focused on identifying potential biomarkers for BLCA by integrating bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analysis, which could precisely stratify and recognize patients.\nIn this study, we performed systematic bioinformatics analyses using scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data to construct a prognostic model of BLCA patients, with two external validation cohorts to validate its ability to stratify risk. Meanwhile, we outline the immune infiltration landscape and determine how it contributes to the development of BLCA. Moreover, we deliberated the relationship between the risk model and infiltrating immune cells to gain a better understanding of the potential molecular immunity process during the progression of BLCA. Overall, our study provides a novel insight that may benefit the clinical management of BLCA."

Samples with incomplete survival information and clinical information were excluded to obtain a training set of 406 BLCA patients for this study. The scRNA-seq dataset GSE129845 of BLCA was downloaded from the\nGEO (https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/) database, containing scRNA-seq of paracancerous tissues from 3 BLCA patients, the patients information and sequencing statistics were shown in Additional file\u00a09: Table\u00a0S1. GSE13507, containing 165 BLCA patients with complete survival information, was also downloaded as external data to validate the model feasibility. The samples were integrate using anchors method in the R package \"Seurat\" [14] and core cells were obtained by filtering scRNA-seq. Ineligible cells include genes that can only be detected in 3 or fewer cells and low-quality cells with less than 200 genes detected will be excluded from subsequent analysis. Gene expression of core cells was normalized using a linear regression model, and then the top 2000 genes with highly variable characteristics were screened by ANOVA. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on single-cell samples, and the top 20 principal components (PC) were selected for subsequent analysis. The umap algorithm [15] was used to perform an overall dimensionality reduction analysis on the top 20 PC pairs of samples. Using the R package \"singleR\" package [16], HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData, BlueprintEncodeData, and ImmuneCellExpressionData were used as reference data for auxiliary annotation, followed by the CellMarker database [17] and previous studies to find marker genes for manual annotation of different clusters.\nScreening of\u00a0core cells and\u00a0functional enrichment analysis of\u00a0their marker genes The FindAllMarkers function in the Seurat package was used to find marker genes for each cluster by setting the parameters min.pct = 0.2 and only.pos = TRUE, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to identify DEGs in the process of screening marker genes. Based on the significantly different marker genes for each cell type, ssGSEA [18] scores were calculated for each cell type in the TCGA dataset (BLCA/normal) using ssGSEA, and the differences in scores between BLCA and normal samples for each cell type were analyzed by Wilcoxon, and cells with significant differences (p < 0.05) in the control and normal groups were recorded as core cells. The marker genes of core cells were enriched for GO and KEGG functions using the \"clusterProfiler\" [19] in R software, respectively. To explain the molecular mechanism of BLCA progression, pseudo-temporal analysis was performed on each of the seven cells using the Monocle 2 algorithm. CellPhone DB v2.0 was used to explore the potential interactions between core cells.\nIdentification and\u00a0functional enrichment analysis of\u00a0DEGs in\u00a0TCGA\u2011BLCA Differential analysis was performed on 19 control and 411 disease data using the limma package. p_value < 0.05\nand |Log2FC|> 1 were designated as DEGs. The heatmap and volcano maps of DEGs were visualized using the ggplot2 [20] and pheatmap packages [21], respectively. Subsequently, the most significant enrichment pathways and biological processes of DEGs were investigated using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses using the R software \"clusterProfiler\" package."

            "text": "The overall schematic outline of the present study was shown in Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a0S1. First, we filtered ineligible cells and yielded 13,490 core cells for subsequent analysis (Fig.\u00a0 1A). ANOVA of genes was performed on the core cells, and we found that 2000 genes were highly variable (Fig.\u00a0 1B). PCA was performed on three singlecell samples (Fig.\u00a0 1C), and the single-cell samples were scattered and distributed with logical results. Meanwhile, in the PCA, we also selected 20 principal components (PCs) with p.value < 0.05 for subsequent analysis (Fig.\u00a01D). Then, the core cells were classified into 19 independent cell clusters using the umap algorithm (Fig.\u00a01E, F). The different clusters were annotated by finding marker genes through the \" singleR \" package, CellMarker database, and references [17], resulting in seven cell clusters, namely B cells, endothelial cells, T cells, monocyte cell, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a01G). The expression of important marker genes for each cell type was visualized by bubble plots (Fig.\u00a0 1H). The scatter plots showed the expression of marker genes in different cell types (Additional file\u00a0 2: Fig.\u00a0 S2). Furthermore, we exprlored the expression of marker genes (PDPN, THY1, PDGFRB, PDGFRA,and POSTN) for cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in different cell types, and found that all marker genes were highly expressed in fibroblasts (Additional file\u00a03: Fig.\u00a0S3). The high expression of each identified marker gene in a specific cell could be summarized, further illustrating the reliability of cell type determination.\nIdentification of\u00a0core cells and\u00a0their marker gene functional enrichment analysis By using the FindAllMarkers and Wilcoxon test, 474 significantly different marker genes were obtained to be identified (Additional file\u00a0 10: Table\u00a0 S2). Calculating the ssGSEA scores of significantly different marker genes for each cell, we found that all seven cells were significantly down-regulated in BLCA, and therefore seven cells were considered core cells for subsequent analysis (Fig.\u00a0 2A). The marker genes of core cells were enriched for GO and KEGG functions (Fig.\u00a0 2B\u2013E). We noted that, with the exception of smooth muscle cells, the marker genes for all six cell types were associated with positive regulation of cell activation, including lymphocytes and leukocytes (Fig.\u00a02B). In addition, the marker genes of monocytes and T cells were associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. The marker genes of B cells were connected to the p53 signalling pathway. The marker genes of endothelial cells, epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells were linked to focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction (Fig.\u00a02E). Pseudo-temporal analysis was performed separately for all cells annotated to explore their differentiation directions using the Monocle 2 algorithm. The results showed that BLCA cells gradually followed 3 differentiation directions (Fig.\u00a03A). Epithelial cells differentiated earlier than other cells and differentiated into two branches, one of which was dominated by Endothelial cells and the other by smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts\ncells (Fig.\u00a0 3B). Furthermore, we inferred cell\u2013cell communication networks to predict intercellular communication based on specific pathways and ligand receptors. The heatmap of the number of ligand-receptor pairs showed that Fibroblasts, T cells, monocyte cell, endothelial cells, and Epithelial cells cellular communication occurred more frequently (Fig.\u00a0 3C). In detail, the frequency and intensity of interactions between endothelial cells and epithelial cells, between endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and between endothelial cells and T cells were high (Fig.\u00a03D). In addition, the interactions of B cells with other cells were relatively rare (Additional file\u00a0 4: Fig.\u00a0S4)."

Risk score = 0.09876179 \u00d7 PCOLCE2 + 0.04635731 \u00d7 MAP1B + 0.01686333 \u00d7 EL N. According to cut-off = 0.15, patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups (Fig.\u00a0 6D). The Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that patients with high-risk scores had significantly lower OS and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with low-risk scores (Fig.\u00a0 6E; Additional file\u00a05: Fig.\u00a0S5A). To further assess the validity of the risk model, the ROC curve for OS was calculated, and the AUC values at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\u00a0 years were greater than 0.59, indicating better efficacy of the risk model (Fig.\u00a06F). We also performed functional validation of the model in the internal validation set and external validation set GSE13507 and GSE32548, and the results showed that the model has an accuracy (Additional file\u00a0 6: Fig.\u00a0 S6, Additional file\u00a05: Fig.\u00a0S5B). In summary, our prognostic model showed excellent predictive efficiency in BLCA.\nAnalysis of\u00a0risk scores and\u00a0different clinical characteristics To analyze the correlation between the expression of risk scores and clinical characteristics, the differences in risk scores of patients were compared separately according to different groups of clinical characteristics. The results showed that risk scores were significantly different in N-stage, T-stage, and OS status (Fig.\u00a0 7B). The heatmap of the risk model and clinical characteristics are shown in Fig.\u00a0 7A. Stratified analysis of clinical characteristics showed that clinical stages M0, Male, Stage III-IV, T1-T2, age > 60, and TMB_hight were significantly different in survival in high and low-risk groups (Additional file\u00a0 7: Fig.\u00a0S7). Taken together, our prognostic model based on three characteristic genes had excellent prognostic value.\nScreening of\u00a0independent prognostic factors and\u00a0construction of\u00a0nomogram To screen independent prognostic factors, clinical characteristics and risk scores were subjected to univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. We found RiskScore, and Stage as independent prognostic factors for patients (Fig.\u00a0 8A, B). The two independent prognostic factors were included in the nomogram model (Fig.\u00a08C). In addition, the calibration curve showed that the model had a high predictive effect (Fig.\u00a0 8D). Therefore, our results suggested that risk score was an independent prognostic factor and that the nomogram had high predictive efficacy for predicting OS of BLCA patients."

The results showed that the differences in the infiltration levels of the 25 immune cell species were statistically significant except for natural. killers.cell, Monocyte, and T.helper. cell (Fig.\u00a0 10A). The Pearson correlation result displayed that both prognostic genes and risk score were significantly associated with infiltrating immune cells (Fig.\u00a0 10B). Sixteen GEP genes (inflammatory genes) and four immune checkpoints were significantly different in the high- and low-risk groups (Fig.\u00a0 10C). Heatmaps of immune cells and 16 differential GEP genes between high and low-risk groups are detailed in Additional file\u00a08: Fig.\u00a0S8. The interacting network of 16 differential GEP genes and the top 4 ranked pathways (T cell activation, regulation of T cell activation, regulation of leukocyte cell\u2013cell adhesion, leukocyte cell\u2013 cell adhesion) is shown in Fig.\u00a0 10D, which diaplayed\nthe close association between GEP genes and these pathways.

By SubMap, in the immunotherapy cohort (Roh cohort), ICB was performed in the high and low-risk groups response was assessed. We found that the CTLA-4 immune loci were sensitive in the Roh cohort (Fig.\u00a010G). We found that BLCA patients were mainly dominated by missense mutations and SNPs (Fig.\u00a0 11A). The mutation results between high and low-risk groups showed that most mutation types in the high and low-risk groups were missense mutations. The proportion of mutations in the high-risk group was higher than that in the lowrisk group, and the mutation load index TMB index was overall higher in the high-risk group than in the lowrisk group (Fig.\u00a0 11B).

In addition, we explored the targets and pathways of 12 drugs, 5 of which had no corresponding data (Table\u00a0 1). 12 chemotherapeutic drugs were significantly different between high and low-risk groups (Fig.\u00a012B). In the CTRP database, the drugs staurosporine, CCT036477, XL765, TGX.221, and sunitinib had the strongest negative association with risk scores (Fig.\u00a0 12C).

            "text": "BLCA is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and its incidence is on the rise in many countries. Despite many efforts that have been made recently toward the management of BLCA, the heterogeneous and aggressive characteristics of BLCA are still limited for prognostic assessment [27]. Therefore, screening novel biomarkers to help develop patient-specific therapies and improve prognosis remains critical and urgent. Distinct\nfrom bulk RNA-seq focusing on the average expression level of genes in cells, scRNA-seq has emerged as a useful tool for transcriptional stratification to define the cell subpopulations and realize specific biomarkers and heterogeneity among different cell types in various cancers, including BLCA [28]. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq to develop a risk model that exhibited excellent prognostic and predictive efficacy for immunotherapy response in BLCA.\nFirst, we identified 7 core cells in the scRNA-seq profile containing 13,490 cells, namely: fibroblasts, B cells, T cells, monocyte cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells, in which cellular communication was highly frequent but expression levels were generally down-regulated in tumor samples, and precisely such heterogeneity and interaction with TME that is essential in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance [29]. The results of GO/KEGG analysis of DEGs obtained in TCGA were mainly enriched in the cell cycle and PI3KAkt signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway, which may be contributed to the proliferation and progression of BLCA. Existing studies indicated that alterations in cyclins, TP53, and Rb genes are ubiquitous in BLCA, particularly in MIBC with higher frequency, and therapy targeting against aberrant cell-cycle regulators may be beneficial in BLCA. Numerous studies have also confirmed that PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathway activation play essential roles in the initiation and progression of BLCA [30\u201332]. Moreover, we recognized the brown module composed of 2334 genes as the key module using WGCNA. 123 candidate genes were collected by taking the intersection of the above three gene sets to enhance the stability of signatures.\nNext, the 3-gene prognostic model was established by univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO algorithm, involving: MAP1B, PCOLCE2, and ELN, with the ROC curve results demonstrating that it had promising predictive efficacy for prognosis and was an independent prognostic factor for OS in BLCA. Contrary to other models [33], our signatures were the results of integrating multiple datasets and algorithms, validated by internal and external validation sets inconsistent with the training set, and showed AUC values between 0.590\u20130.813, suggesting higher reliability and relevance, of which we also analyzed the relationship between the model and clinicopathological characteristics, and the results revealed that risk scores were significantly associated with patients\u2019 lymph node metastasis and tumor stage, indicating that the model is not limited to having predictive value for OS. Besides, we also observed 3 signature genes related to the tumor microenvironment. MAP1B is one of the Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which is involved\nin cytoskeleton composition. It has been reported that MAP1B was remarkably overexpressed in BLCA tissues and positively correlated with tumor pathological tumor stage, grade, lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion, knockdown of MAP1B could reverse chemoresistance by interrupting the cell cycle [34]. PCOLCE2 is a collagen-binding protein that functions as a pivotal component in tumor microenvironment remodeling [35], and a previous study also demonstrated that down-regulation of PCOLCE2 expression resulted in better OS [36]. ELN is a crucial element of the extracellular matrix that promotes breast cancer progression by enhancing the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) but is scarcely documented in BLCA [37]. We also considered that clinical characteristics could have an impact on the prognosis of patients, so clinical characteristics were subjected to multifactorial Cox analyses, and the findings revealed the independent influences of Stage and risk score on the OS of BLCA patients, which were further constructed as a nomogram model, with a calibration curve verifying the remarkably favorable predictive ability.\nFurthermore, all samples were divided into low- and high-risk groups according to the calculated risk score, and we observed that the high-risk group was mainly enriched in immune processes and immune-related pathways, thus it was hypothesized that the risk score could be a potential predictive indicator for BLCA patients undergoing immunotherapy. We approached this from different perspectives evaluating TMB, immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, and associated inflammatory genes, and concluded that the high-risk group presented higher TMB and significantly elevated infiltrations of multiple immune cells, but significantly lower expression of inflammatory genes and immune checkpoints than the low-risk group, supporting that patients with low-risk scores are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.\nFinally, potential druggable targets and corresponding compounds for BLCA patients were identified from the GDSC and CTRP databases in light of developed prognostic models, primarily including cell cycle (staurosporine and RO-3306), PI3K/mTOR pathway (XL765, TGX-221, AZD8186, and AZD8055) and Wnt pathway inhibitors (CCT036477 and SB216763), which were compatible with the pathway enrichment results of DEGs. Owing to the potency and promiscuity of these drugs, they have not been adopted in the clinic yet, but they will become quite promising antitumor drugs in the future with technological renovation.\nTaking into utmost consideration tumor heterogeneity, interactions of each cell population, immune infiltration, TMB, and clinical characteristics, the strength of this work lies in the identification and construction of a novel prognostic model capable of accurately discriminating\nsurvival outcomes and immunotherapeutic response in BLCA, and the findings acquired in this study provide direct evidence for stratified and precise treatment of BLCA patients. However, there are several inescapable limitations of this study: (1) the sample size of scRNA-seq data is relatively small; (2) the regulatory mechanisms of signature genes in BLCA remain ambiguous, and which is exactly what future work arising from this study should continue to explore."
