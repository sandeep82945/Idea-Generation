    "abstractText": "Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a severe health problem closely related to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). However, the underlying mechanisms by which ACEs may affect NSSI are largely unknown. Self-efficacy (NSSI-SE) and recent negative life events (RNLEs) may play important roles in this relationship. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between ACEs and NSSI among college students by examining the role of self-efficacy (NSSISE) and RNLEs in this process. Method: Relevant self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate ACEs, RNLEs, NSSI-SE, and NSSI. A questionnaire of 1036 Chinese undergraduates (Mage = 19.65, 28.9% males, 71.1% females) was collected in a cross-sectional manner. The associations between ACEs, RNLEs, NSSI-SE and NSSI were assessed using Pearson correlation analyses. Then, hierarchical multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the effects of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI, as well as the protective effect of NSSI-SE on the above relations. Results: NSSI was associated with both ACEs and RNLEs. ACEs and RNLEs could directly increase the risks of participating in NSSI, and the effects of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI were independent without an interactive effect. NSSI-SE buffered the relationship between ACEs and NSSI, as well as between RNLEs and NSSI. Compared to individuals with a low level of NSSI-SE, ACEs and RNLEs were not significantly associated with NSSI in persons with a high level of NSSI-SE. Conclusion: NSSI-SE may buffer the effect of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI, indicating that future interventions can be enhanced by targeting NSSI-SE among college students with ACEs or RNLEs to prevent their engagement in NSSI.",

A questionnaire of 1036 Chinese undergraduates (Mage = 19.65, 28.9% males, 71.1% females) was collected in a cross-sectional manner. The associations between ACEs, RNLEs, NSSI-SE and NSSI were assessed using Pearson correlation analyses. Then, hierarchical multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the effects of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI, as well as the protective effect of NSSI-SE on the above relations.\nResults: NSSI was associated with both ACEs and RNLEs. ACEs and RNLEs could directly increase the risks of participating in NSSI, and the effects of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI were independent without an interactive effect. NSSI-SE buffered the relationship between ACEs and NSSI, as well as between RNLEs and NSSI. Compared to individuals with a low level of NSSI-SE, ACEs and RNLEs were not significantly associated with NSSI in persons with a high level of NSSI-SE.\nConclusion: NSSI-SE may buffer the effect of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI, indicating that future interventions can be enhanced by targeting NSSI-SE among college students with ACEs or RNLEs to prevent their engagement in NSSI.\nKeywords: Non-suicidal self-injury, Self-efficacy, Adverse childhood experiences, Recent negative life events, College students\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is widely recognized as a significant public health and societal concern that can bring challenges and disadvantages to individuals\u2019 development [1]. NSSI refers to an act of direct and deliberate destruction of body tissue without the intent to commit suicide and is distinguished from reckless or careless behavior that may indirectly result in bodily harm [2, 3].\n*Correspondence: liuxia@bnu.edu.cn\n2 Institute of Developmental Psychology, Beijing Normal University, No. 19 Xinjiekouwai Street, Beijing 100875, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nSuch behavior frequently occurs among university students [4, 5]. For instance, a recent study found that nearly 22% of Chinese college students reported having engaged in NSSI in the past year [6].\nAmong the studies on the factors associated with NSSI, one consistent factor that has been identified as a significant predictor of NSSI is the occurring adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) [7\u20139]. Related studies have found that individuals with a history of ACEs are more likely to engage in NSSI [10\u201313]. However, these studies mainly focus on inpatients and adolescents [8, 14, 15], and the investigation of this topic among college students needs to be strengthened. In addition, recent negative life events (RNLEs), which refer to the experience of stressful events in the last year, can be theorized to have a similarly prominent role as a main proximal risk factor for NSSI, and they may play a moderating role in the relationship between ACEs and NSSI. Moreover, the self-efficacy to avoid NSSI (NSSI-SE) is an important protective factor in the relationships between ACEs, RNLEs, and NSSI [16\u2013 18]. For college students with different levels of NSSI-SE, the effects of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI may be inconsistent. At present, there is still no research on this issue.\nInvestigating protective and risk factors simultaneously can help formulate targeted interventions for college students\u2019 NSSI, especially through the exploration of protective factors, which can help high-risk groups avoid NSSI. The current study, therefore, aimed to explore the specific effect of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI in college students and investigate the potential buffering effect of NSSI-SE of NSSI in this process. The focus of this study is whether NSSI-SE can effectively protect college students who have suffered from ACEs and RNLEs."

            "text": "Adverse childhood experiences are defined as a series of moderate to severe stressful encounters occurring in childhood, including emotional, sexual, or physical abuse; parental incarceration; neglect; divorce; parental psychopathology; and parental separation [19]. Numerous investigations have found that a history of ACEs is a significant determinant of NSSI in adolescents as well as young adults [7, 20], and as many as 80% of those who engage in NSSI have a history of ACEs [21].\nAccording to the model of difficulties in emotion regulation, NSSI is considered a maladaptive means to regulate emotions after suffering from negative events [22]. In the past literature, ACEs were recognized as a series of typical negative events [23, 24]. Based on this opinion, young adults and college students with a history of ACEs, are likely to have trouble coping with these past negative events. Thus, individuals with a history of suffering from negative events (i.e., ACEs) may engage in NSSI as\na method to regulate their affect and emotions [25, 26]. The theory hypothesizes that engaging in NSSI derives from a need to control past experiences of trauma and current anger and pain related to such experiences that cannot be expressed verbally or through other means [26]. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies support the function of emotional regulation as an explanation for NSSI among young adults and teenagers with a history of ACEs (a series of classic childhood negative events [8, 23, 24, 27]) [28\u201330]. In addition, systematic reviews and meta-analyses clarify the predictive effect of ACEs on NSSI [10, 11] and show that people with a history of ACEs are more likely to engage in NSSI.\nRecent negative life events and\u00a0NSSI Recent negative life events (RNLEs) are defined as psychosocial stressors and include a range of distressing life events that may occur in a young person\u2019s daily life, such as \u201chaving conflicts with members of one\u2019s family,\u201d \u201cbeing misjudged by friends,\u201d and \u201cfailing examinations.\u201d [31] According to previous research, recent negative life events are important risk factors for NSSI. For instance, some studies reveal that RNLEs are positively related to children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 depression and NSSI [32\u201334]. Life stress brought on by recent negative life events has been identified to play a unique role in the prevalence of NSSI, whereby people with more life stress are vulnerable to participating in NSSI [35]. However, despite some researchers pointing out that the history of\u00a0 RNLEs is an important factor in studying NSSI, existing research mainly examines the relationship in adolescents, while few have clarified the relationships of NSSI in college students and young adults with RNLEs. To address this gap, one of the goals of the present study was to examine the degree to which RNLEs influence NSSI among college students.\nAnother concern is that\u00a0the history of RNLEs may play an important role in the relationship between ACEs and NSSI. On the one hand, the concept of stress sensitization suggests that RNLEs perpetuate the negative impact of ACEs and contribute to the onset and recurrence of psychopathology symptoms [36]. Thus, ACEs and RNLEs may interact to affect NSSI. On the other hand, some studies also show that early and later-life stressors may make independent contributions to health later in life, such as in terms of inflammation, daily negative affect, and depression [37\u201339]. In other words, ACEs and RNLEs may independently\u00a0affect adult mental health outcomes. Taken together, the relationships between ACEs, RNLEs, and psychological outcomes (i.e., NSSI) appear to be complex, and more empirical research is needed to clarify the effect of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI among Chinese college students."

            "text": "Given the elevated prevalence of NSSI among university students, it is important to determine possible protective aspects linked to a reduction in the incidence of NSSI. The transtheoretical model of change (TTM) provides a new direction for the therapeutic treatment of NSSI [40, 41]. The TTM constitutes a theoretical approach to intentional behavior change that comprises four extensive domains, i.e., stages of change, decisional balance, the change process, and self-efficacy [42]. The domain of self-efficacy is essential for effective intervention. Regarding NSSI, self-efficacy is generally redefined as the assessment of an individual\u2019s ability to resist self-injury [43]. Self-efficacy to avoid NSSI (NSSI-SE) provides a new perspective into specific NSSI-related cognitions. The proposed NSSI-SE refers to considering enhancing an individual\u2019s specific confidence in their ability to avoid NSSI behaviors [43, 44]. In other words, NSI-SE is an element proposed by clinicians to try to provide specialized interventions for people with NSSI. This domain is integrated from Bandura\u2019s social cognitive theory (SCT) and includes two parts: confidence and temptation [45]. Confidence represents an individual\u2019s situation-specific confidence in his or her ability to cope with high-risk situations without reverting to undesired behavior. Temptation refers to an individual\u2019s rating of the strength of his or her desire to engage in a certain behavior (NSSI) when amid a difficult situation. Temptations can be internal, taking the form of negative affect or emotional distress, or external, taking the form of triggering relationships or external stimuli [46, 47].\nA few empirical studies based on the TTM have established that NSSI-SE is lower in persons who commit NSSI and that diminished confidence in one\u2019s capacity to cope with distressing events might trigger the onset of NSSI and result in maintaining it over time [48, 49]. Furthermore, social self-efficacy, a belief in one\u2019s potential to manage social occurrences, protects against NSSI risks resulting from experiencing a perceived injustice in a family setting [50], implying that NSSI-SE may play a protective role for teenagers and young adults who experience adversity and distressing life events. Therefore, it is very important to consider the potential moderating effect of NSSI-SE when conducting in-depth research on the link between ACEs, RNLEs, and NSSI in undergraduates. For vulnerable college students who have encountered stressful ACEs and RNLEs, investigating NSSI-SE to prevent NSSI may be significant in identifying effective strategies for NSSI prevention."

The 32-item measure explores exposure to four domains of ACEs: neglect, family dysfunction, abuse, and violence. Each domain includes several categories. We used 28 items from all categories, with the exception of exposure to collective violence/war (four items). Participants were asked to respond to the 28 questions on the basis of their encounters during their first 16\u00a0years of life. Each item was then constructed as a dummy variable with a score of \u201c0\u201d assigned if the participant had never experienced it and a code of \u201c1\u201d assigned if the participant had experienced it during the first 16\u00a0years of life. The overall number of ACE items to which the subject was \u201cexposed\u201d was summed to construct an ACE score ranging between 0 and 28. This study focused on the findings of subjects\u2019 overall ACE exposure (ACE score). Overall, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of the ACE-IQ (ACE score) was measured as 0.84.\nRNLEs were investigated by the Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC) [31, 54], which is utilized to explore the impact of negative life events on teenagers (including undergraduates) over the previous 12\u00a0months. The ASLEC includes 26 items linked to five dimensions: study stress, punishment, relationship pressure, loss, and healthy adaptation. The checklist uses a six-point scale (1 = no negative life events to 6 = negative life events with serious impact). The higher a score is, the more distressing the associated negative life event was. In this study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of the scale was measured as 0.92.\nSelf-efficacy to avoid NSSI (NSSI-SE) was explored via an 11-item questionnaire adapted from the scale measuring NSSI-SE to avoid committing non-suicidal\nself-injury [43]. Participants reported on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very unfit) to 5 (very fit) whether they believed they could resist engaging in NSSI in certain situations based on statements such as \u201cI feel like I can accept myself,\u201d \u201cI need to relieve inner pressure or need a release,\u201d and \u201cI have easy access to (self-harming) tools.\u201d The scale included three subscales, for \u201cconfidence,\u201d \u201cemotion regulation temptations,\u201d and \u201creinforcing temptations.\u201d The greater the total score is, the stronger a student\u2019s level of NSSI-SE to resist NSSI is. The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of the current sample was measured as 0.89.\nNSSI was tested using the 18-item Adolescents SelfHarm Scale (ASHS) [55]. This instrument explores the degree to which persons repeatedly or deliberately selfharm via diverse methods (e.g., hitting, skin-cutting, or stabbing) without harboring suicidal intentions. Two dimensions of each of the 18 items were evaluated. The first evaluated the number of times a participant deliberately adopted this method to self-harm at any time previously (frequency) and used a four-point scale (0 = has not happened, to 3 = has happened more than five times); the second item evaluated the extent to which a previous act had hurt the participant\u2019s body at any time (degree) on a five-point scale (0 = no harm to the body, to 4 = extreme severe harm to the body). Each item\u2019s score was equal to the frequency multiplied by the extent, and the overall score (summed score across all items) was employed to compute the overall extent of NSSI. The higher a participant\u2019s total score was, the higher their degree of NSSI was. The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for ASHS was measured as 0.92.\nFinally, subjects were asked to report their age, gender, grade, and study major and their parents\u2019 education level (6 levels from 1 = elementary school graduate or below to 6 = postgraduate degree graduate or above). Subjective socioeconomic status was explored via the MacArthur ladder scale of subjective social status (10 steps) [56]."

Since all the measurements were based solely on self-reporting, common method variance could have influenced the associations between the variables. Harman\u2019s singlefactor test was performed prior to data analyses [57]. The results show that 25 factors generated eigenvalues greater than 1.0 (68.8% of the explained variance). At each evaluation, the first factor was responsible for 16.33 (less than 40%) of the variance, implying that the\u00a0common method variance was insignificant.\nIn the current study, NSSI data were highly skewed (skewness = 6.59, kurtosis = 55.85), and there was an inhomogeneity of variance between the male and female groups (F = 5.79, p < 0.05), so the data did not fit the preconditions of the independent sample t test. Then, since\ngender differences have been found in previous studies on NSSI [58\u201360], the Mann\u2012Whitney U test was adopted to investigate whether the gender difference exists in our study [61]. The NSSI score was normally transformed to meet the\u00a0 requirements of subsequent analyses. Since some participants reported an NSSI score of 0, the natural logarithm was taken based on the addition of a constant of 1 to the NSSI score to form a new NSSI score with an approximately normal distribution (skewness = 2.15, kurtosis = 4.12) to meet the requirements of subsequent correlation analyses and linear regressions [62\u201364]. Then, Pearson correlation analyses examined correlations between all study variables. Referring to the analytical methods of existing studies [65\u201369], we conducted a hierarchical multiple regression to test our hypotheses regarding the specific effects of ACEs, RNLEs, and NSSI-SE in predicting NSSI.\nThe model explored the potential protective role of NSSI-SE in the relationship between ACEs, RNLEs, and NSSI. In Step 1 of this regression, some sociodemographic variables were entered. In Step 2 of this model, ACEs, RNLEs, and NSSI-SE were entered into the analysis. Interactions (ACEs multiplied by RNLEs, ACEs multiplied by NSSI-SE, and RNLEs multiplied by NSSI-SE) were entered in Step 3. Finally, a three-way interaction variable (ACEs multiplied by RNLEs multiplied by NSSISE) was entered in Step 4. For any significant interactions, simple slope tests were performed afterward. All continuous variables were standardized (z scores) prior to analysis to overcome multicollinearity by using NSSI scores after natural log transformation to ensure that the dependent variable was normally distributed."

Our results provide a new perspective for the further prevention of NSSI among college students.\nFirst, our research shows that ACEs have been strongly associated with NSSI among college students, which indicates that adverse childhood experiences significantly increases the\u00a0risks of engaging in NSSI [71]. As shown by previous studies, childhood trauma destroys an individual\u2019s ability to appropriately regulate or manage negative emotional states, which may further create significant\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nACEs_Low ACEs_High\nNSSI-SE_Low\nNSSI-SE_High\nN SS\nI\nFig. 2 Self-efficacy moderated the association between ACEs and NSSI\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nRNLEs_Low RNLEs_High\nNSSI-SE_Low\nNSSI-SE_High\nN SS\nI\nFig. 3 Self-efficacy moderated the association between RNLEs and NSSI\nemotional problems and extreme distress for individuals [13, 21]. As a result, individuals may use self-injury as a regulatory means of dealing with distress disorders that disturb cognitive and affective processing. Second, higher rates of RNLEs were significantly positively associated with more NSSI. The finding is consistent with, and builds upon, previous multi-wave and longitudinal studies examining the relationship between these two variables [72, 73]. This implies that both childhood and recent stressors should be considered when making risk evaluations as well as developing prevention and intervention measures to prevent individuals exposed to adversity from engaging in NSSI. Third, our results provide support for the independent effect hypothesis of ACEs and RNLEs in affecting NSSI [37]. Given that adverse childhood experiences and recent stressors were not found to interact with NSSI, further research can investigate whether stressors from childhood and recent periods have a cumulative effect on NSSI [74].\nOur study is the first to examine the protective role of NSSI-SE in the relationship between ACEs, RNLEs, and NSSI among the targeted demographic of Chinese college students. The results show that for individuals exhibiting high levels of NSSI-SE, ACEs and RNLEs cannot significantly predict NSSI, which means that ACEs and RNLEs are positively associated with NSSI only in college students with lower levels of NSSI-SE. This means that NSSI-SE reduces the risk of persons with a history of ACEs and RNLEs engaging in NSSI. From the perspective of the TTM, NSSI-SE could be recognized as the ability to resist NSSI [40, 41]. Individuals with a high level of NSSI-SE have the potential to engage in positive self-suggestion when faced with stressful events and to believe that they can engage in appropriate coping interventions to reduce stress, thus avoiding negative coping strategies such as NSSI. Therefore, high NSSI-SE constitutes a significant protective factor for undergraduates in resisting NSSI whether they have suffered stimuli from distal or proximal stressors. The protective effect of NSSI-SE for individuals with a history of ACEs or RNLEs is a significant finding of this research, as NSSI-SE may prove to be an important protective factor for the improvement of therapy to help patients with a history of high risk-seeking avoid engaging in NSSI.\nThe results of this study have important implications for intervention in NSSI among college students. The results suggest a need to pay attention to college students who have experienced a series of stressors and highlight the importance of improving levels of NSSI-SE as a means to mitigate the effects of ACEs and RNLEs on NSSI. Enhancing NSSI-SE may be an important step toward equipping individuals with a history of ACEs and RNLEs to handle high-risk emotional situations in\nthe college environment. In response to this finding, we should pay attention to improving NSSI-SE in college mental health programs and adding evaluations of relevant indicators to annual student mental health surveys.\nAlthough the results of this research work have important value for clinical intervention in NSSI among college students, several limitations should be considered. First, cross-sectional data were acquired at a single time point, limiting our ability to monitor changes in the relationships of variables across time. Therefore, a longitudinal design is needed to confirm the relationships between these variables over time. Second, we examined ACEs and RNLEs in general, while different types of stressful experiences associated with NSSI may represent different mechanisms; therefore, future research should consider the specific effects of different stressful events relating to NSSI. Third, based on the larger proportion of female participation in our survey, the design of our survey should be improved to increase male participation to ensure a more equal gender response rate and reduce the likelihood of self-selection to obtain more accurate data on gender differences in NSSI.\nAbbreviations ACEs: Adverse childhood experiences; RNLEs: Recent negative life events; NSSI-SE: Self-efficacy to avoid non-suicidal self-injury; NSSI: Non-suicidal self-injury.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to the college students and scholars who contributed to this study.\nAuthor contributions Conceptualization, ZXC and XL; Data curation, ZXC, JWL, and JML; Formal analysis, ZXC, JWL, and JML; Writing-original draft, ZXC and XL; Preparing all the figures and tables, ZXC; Writing-review and editing, JWL, JML, and XL; Funding acquisition, XL; Project administration, XL.
