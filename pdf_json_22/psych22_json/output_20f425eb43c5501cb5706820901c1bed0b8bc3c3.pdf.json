    "abstractText": "Social media usage (SMU) and its relationship with working memory (WM) and academic performance remain unclear, and there is a lack of experimental evidence. We investigated whether WM mediates the association between SMU and academic performance, including the roles of depression, anxiety, and disordered social media use as possible contributors. A sample of 118 undergraduate students aged 19 to 28 from Saudi Arabia performed a WM test twice; for one assessment, participants were required to interact with social media before the test, and the other test was preceded by painting online. We also measured grade point average (GPA), habitual social media usage (SMU), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and disordered social media usage (SMDS). There was no significant difference between WM scores in the social media condition compared to the control condition, but when solely considering at least moderately depressed participants, social media use predicted significantly more errors in the social media condition compared to the control condition. Furthermore, higher SMDS scores were significantly predicted by higher PHQ-9 scores and more hours of habitual SMU. GPA scores were not predicted by WM performance or SMU. The present study is one of the first experimental attempts to compare the relationship between SMU and WM and highlights the priming effect of depression on the relationship between SMU and WM.",

            "text": "The use of social media has steadily increased over the past decade. It has become a ubiquitous aspect of everyday living and is rapidly expanding [1]. In a recent study, students have been found to use certain platforms to differing degrees and for different purposes, based on their gender, personality, and age [2]. Furthermore, there was an association between disordered social media usage, specifically on Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook (among other platforms), and the desire felt by users to socialize and present themselves as more popular [2]. Younger people, in particular, are entering a phase where social media is seen as not only a part of life but also life itself; this perception has dramatically accelerated during and even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. The literature on this all-pervasive technology is relatively recent, and there is expanding interest among researchers concerning the impact of such technology on society\u2019s general wellbeing. Of particular interest among researchers, parents, and health professionals is the impact of social media on cognitive function [4], educational achievement [5], and mental wellbeing, particularly among the younger generation [6]. However, most work consists of correlation and self-reporting studies and lacks experimental evidence. The influence of social media usage on cognitive performance is poorly understood. Working memory has garnered particular interest as a cognitive quality that is possibly\nBehav. Sci. 2022, 12, 16. https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12010016 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/behavsci\nBehav. Sci. 2022, 12, 16 2 of 14\ninfluenced by social media usage, as it can be one of several predictors of academic achievement [7]. Working memory is the ability to attend to learned information, retain it, and manipulate it to acquire new knowledge, master skills, and direct behavior [8]. The working memory system has a limited capacity, and social media usage may indeed impair working memory by either (1) diverting attention from the learned information, or (2) reducing concentration on the acquired knowledge in favor of the social media content. Both are mechanisms through which working memory performance would be impaired. Nonetheless, different studies in this field have yielded varying results. Few studies support a positive relationship between more social media usage and higher academic performance [9\u201311], although some studies suggest that media multitasking [12], particularly smartphone usage [13], reduces academic performance. Other studies have not found any differences between those who are and those who are not habitual social media users in relation to working memory [14]. Some studies have found that social media usage leads to improvements in working memory [15]. In a similar pattern, social media has been widely investigated in relation to academic performance, again with conflicting results. Some studies have not found a relationship between academic performance, as measured by GPA, and social media usage [16\u201318]. Others have revealed a negative impact of social media on academic performance; that is, individuals who browse more on social media have worse academic outcomes [19\u201321]. Conflicting findings related to academic performance could be partially attributed to the fact that some studies were based on student opinions rather than objective assessments of grades [22]. In accordance with this statement, Abbas et al. reported that, although students admitted that social media affected their study time negatively, in the opinion of those students, it actually increased their level of scientific knowledge [22]. Another potential reason for such conflicting results might be that previous studies ignored the influence of affect on cognition. It is well known that positive and negative affect can significantly influence prefrontal activation and, thereby, performance in WM tasks [23,24]. Social media usage has also been associated with negative emotional wellbeing [25]. This could contribute to the negative impact of social media on cognitive performance in general or on working memory, specifically [26]. Furthermore, unhealthy (disordered or excessive) use of social media has been found to invariably influence psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety [27]. Methodological limitations could partially explain the variability in the results produced in previous research related to the influence of social media on working memory. First, most studies about academic performance employ cross-sectional and correlational designs or are based solely on self-reports. Second, most research in this area has investigated social media activities without considering the impact of the emotions elicited by social media content and use. Third, most of the literature uses a broad conceptualization of \u201cmedia multitasking\u201d [12] and smartphone usage [13], and no clear distinction has been drawn between smartphone usage in general and social media per se. Another distinction that has not been clearly defined in a single study is the effect of \u201cacute\u201d use of social media (at a particular moment) and habitual or \u201cchronic\u201d use of social media. In combination, these limitations make it difficult to draw comprehensive conclusions about the influence of social media on working memory or academic performance. In this study, we designed a novel experimental paradigm to clarify the ambiguity of the effect of social media usage on working memory in previous results by accounting for affective factors (emotional wellbeing, namely, depression and anxiety), patterns of social media use (acute versus habitual use), and behavioral outcomes (academic performance). Our aim in this study is to investigate the following: (1) the impact of acute and habitual usage of social media on working memory performance; (2) the impact of acute and habitual usage of social media on academic performance, as measured by GPA; and (3) the role of negative emotional wellbeing (depression and anxiety) in mediating this association. We hypothesized that participants who used social media before performing a working memory task would demonstrate inferior working memory performance than when they engaged in visual stimuli outside of social media (an active control condition). We also\nBehav. Sci. 2022, 12, 16 3 of 14\nhypothesized that working memory performance would mediate the relationship between social media usage and academic performance, as measured by GPA."

All participants attended a one-hour session split into three blocks, with ten minutes\u2019 rest between each block. The duration of the first block was 6 min, the second block was 10 min, and the final block was 15 min. For each block, participants would either browse their own social media or participate in other internetbased activities (online painting, news-surfing, or listening to music). All participants completed a computerized working memory task. Based on the findings of this pilot study (for results, see Section 3.2), we proceeded with a larger-scale study that used one block length (6 min) and standardized the nonsocial media task (painting). We also included additional questionnaires, as mentioned below. This time interval was selected as one that seemed to provide a reasonable compromise between being long enough for participants to be engaged in social media yet short enough that participants would not feel bored or tired toward the end of the experiment described below.\n2.4. Main Study 2.4.1. Participants\nWe recruited 118 participants: 70 women and 48 men, aged between 19 and 28 years, mean = 23.47, SD = 1.89. Participants were screened over the phone for English fluency and were briefly introduced to the study. Participants were asked to have a good night\u2019s sleep, not take any more than their usual number of stimulants (including nicotine and coffee) and avoid scheduling the in-person study immediately before a stressful event, such as an exam or major deadline. Participants were given instructions to ensure that they understood the tasks required in the study.\n2.4.2. Experimental Paradigm\nAll participants attended a one-hour session, with the testing period split into two blocks; the two blocks were each of 6 min, timed by the researcher, with a rest period between each block. Participants were briefed on the study and given the opportunity to ask questions if needed. The differences between both blocks (social media usage versus painting) were explained to participants and they were asked simply to \u201cperform\u201d the\nBehav.

They were then asked to begin the social media block (Group A) or the nonsocial media (painting) block (Gro p B) for 6 min, timed by the researcher. Immediately following the first block, participants rated how engaging they found the browsing time on a 7-point Likert scale, i.e., to what extent they found the activity they performed to be engaging on a scale from 0 to 7, where 0 meant that they were not engaged at all and 7 meant maximum engagement. Those who responded that they were either completely disengaged (1) or mostly disengaged (2) from either task were excluded from further analysis. Subsequently, participants then performed the spatial working memory (SWM) test (Cambridge Cognition), as described below, to test the effect of the previous block on their working memory. The same sequence was repeated, but participants then completed either the nonsocial media task (painting) block for group A or the social media block for Group B. After completing the blocks, participants were asked for their smartphone screen time over the last week (total number of hours per week engaged in social media use) as recorded on their smartphones. They were also asked for their academic grade point average (GPA, 5-point scale). Finally, participants were offered rest if desired and were asked to complete four questionnaires: the social media disorder scale (SMDS) [28], media multitasking index (MMI) [29], patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-9 [30] for depression, and general anxiety disorder (GAD)-7 [31] for anxiety. All questionnaires were provided in English and the researcher was available to offer any assistance or clarification of the questions.\n2.4.3. The Working Memory Tasks\nThe CANTAB Spatial Working Memory test measures the ability to remember spatial information and manipulate this information using working memory. The test also assesses the strategy used by participants to remember these items. The test takes about 4 min to complete. Colored squares are displayed on the participant\u2019s screen. In each trial, the task\nBehav. Sci. 2022, 12, 16 5 of 14\nfor participants is to figure out which boxes contain blue tokens by initially opening all boxes. This task is supposed to be carried out through a process of elimination and by remembering which boxes are empty. Participants use the blue tokens they find to fill an empty column on the side of the screen. The task is made more complex at each trial \u201clevel\u201d by gradually increasing the number of boxes to 12. The position and color of the boxes used are changed at each trial. Selecting those boxes that have already been found to be empty and rechoosing boxes that participants have already found to contain a token are considered errors. The error number and the strategy used by participants to identify the token locations constitute the outcome measures."

            "text": "All data were entered into SPSS Version 26. The researcher screened for the presence of missing values and data-entry errors. Normality tests were conducted on all continuous variables to determine which descriptive or inferential statistics were appropriate for analyzing those variables. For normally distributed variables, the measures of central tendency to means and measures of dispersion were standard deviations, ranges, and interquartile ranges. For non-normally distributed variables, the measure of central tendency was the median, and the measure of dispersion was the interquartile range. Dependent variables in regression modeling included the total number of errors and the strategy score, with a lower strategy score indicating a more efficient strategy. Trials with additional tokens were more difficult, which is why the number of errors made in each of the trials with 6, 8, or 12 tokens was compared with baseline difficulty (4 tokens) to select sufficiently difficult trials. For each, the error differential (e.g., total errors in 6-token trials vs. 4-token trials) was calculated for each participant. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations over 1000 randomized permutations of each distribution. The easiest difficulty (fewest tokens), which did not include zero in its CI relative to the baseline, represented a trial that was difficult enough to pose a challenge to participants without hindering performance by being unduly difficult. Total errors in trials with this number of tokens and strategy scores for trials up to and including this number of tokens were taken as dependent variables. For the pilot study, performance was evaluated as the total number of errors that a participant made during the 6-, 10-, or 15-minute variants of each trial type (social media or nonsocial media). Paired sample t-tests were used to compare the number of errors made between time intervals and between trial types. The best trial length was taken as the shortest length of time that elicited a difference in the number of errors between trial types. Independent variables included either overall social media use (hours per week) or SMDS score [28], test conditions (acute social media use or painting), an interaction between the two, and independent variables including participant age, gender, PHQ-9 [30], and GAD-7 [31] scores. Normality of residuals was ensured using QQ-plots. For each type of media consumption, responses greater than three standard deviations beyond the mean were identified as outliers and were excluded for each of print media (n = 2), TV (n = 2), computer-based video (n = 6), music (n = 6), nonmusical audio (n = 2), mobile phone video calls (n = 6), email (n = 2), web surfing (n = 4), instant messaging (n = 6), and other computer applications (n = 6). Comparison of participant characteristics between groups was carried out using t-tests with independent samples. Correlations among numeric measures and scales of interest were calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Regression modeling was completed using linear mixed modeling (package lme4 in R, version 3.6.2), accounting for repeated measures among participants by including a random grouping factor of each participant.\nBehav.

When considering disordered social media use, there was similarly no significant effect on the SMDS score (F (1,99) = 0.194, p = 0.660), experimental conditions (F (1,103) = 0.067, p = 0.796), or an interaction between the two (F (1,103) = 0.125, p = 0.725) on the number of errors recorded in the SWM task. There was no impact on either model of age, sex, GAD-7, or PHQ-9 scores. In addition to the number of errors, we investigated strategy scores (a lower score is better). In terms of the number of hours per week engaged in social media use, strategy was not affected by overall social media use (F (1,100) = 0.106, p = 0.745), experimental conditions (F (1,103) = 0.287, p = 0.593), or their interaction (F (1,103) = 0.810, p = 0.370). Strategy was also not affected by SMDS scores (F (1,100) = 1.011, p = 0.452), experimental conditions (F (1,103) = 0.452, p = 0.452), or their interaction (F (1,103) = 0.365, p = 0.547). There was a significant effect of gender on strategy (F (1,100) = 10.679, p = 0.001) with men showing on average a strategy score of 9.88 (SE = 0.76) and women a score of 13.22 (SE = 0.62). There was no effect on age, GAD-7, or PHQ-9 scores. We were interested to observe whether the above effects might be limited to only those participants who were at least moderately depressed (PHQ-9 scores of at least 10, n = 48, 23% of our sample) or who had at least moderate anxiety (GAD-7 scores of at least 10, n = 38, 18% of our sample). For this sub-analysis only, we dichotomized the sample, based on the diagnostic cut-offs for the chosen questionnaires. We tested whether the total number of errors or SWM strategy scores were associated with the experimental conditions, social media use (either defined as the total number of hours of social media use or SMDS scores, one model for each), or an interaction between the two, while controlling for age, sex, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scores. When considering only those participants who were at least moderately depressed, the social media use condition predicted significantly more errors than the control condition (F (1,22) = 4.52, p = 0.045), whereas SMDS scores were not related to the number of errors, and there was no interaction between the two. In addition, while the social media use condition was predictive of the number of errors for these participants, it was not predictive of SWM strategy. Even while controlling for strategy, the social media use condition remained significantly associated with errors in this subset (F (1,22) = 6.72, p = 0.017). Looking at the subset of those with at least moderate anxiety, neither the number of errors nor strategy was significantly associated with the experimental conditions, social media use (in terms of hours or SMDS scores), or an interaction between both.\nBehav.

Therefore, the current study aimed to expand prior research linking social media usage and working memory failures by implementing a novel paradigm to investigate this relationship more robustly. It was hypothesized that participants who used social media before performing a working memory task (the trial condition) would demonstrate poorer working memory performance than when they had not used social media (the control condition). However, there was no significant difference in working memory performance between the two conditions. Furthermore, academic performance, as measured by GPA and working memory, was not predicted by social media use (whether acute or habitual).

            "text": "Our results indicate that working memory may be resilient to social media usage, at least for a healthy group of adults. There are several reasons why SM and non-SM activities did not differently affect the participants\u2019 performance of the WM tasks in our study. First, although it could be argued that both the painting and the SM-surfing activities were equally engaging, when we assessed the participants\u2019 emotional engagement after each block, it was clear from subjective ratings that there was greater engagement in the social media task than the painting task. Second, we attempted to incorporate enough exposure to social media to be able to see its impact on working memory performance by experimenting with different durations in the pilot study. This revealed an effect on social media usage even among a small number of participants during the time frame selected. We do acknowledge that it remains challenging to create experimental conditions that can mimic the everyday use of social media. However, in accordance with other studies, we also measured the participants\u2019 habitual use of SM, based on their screen-time records of the previous week, rather than solely on acute exposure. However, we could not find an association between the habitual usage of social media, as recorded by screen time, and working memory or academic performance. In earlier research, Doss et al. used a daily diary to track social media usage and working memory and found that working memory and negative affect varied on a daily basis. On those days when participants reported a higher negative impact, they scored worse in assessments of working memory [32]. A daily follow-up of SMU and WM performance using a journal, following the procedure of Doss et al. [32], may be a more accurate record of this association. Interestingly, the results showed a difference between the conditions, regarding those who were at least moderately depressed, since they made more errors in the WM task after acute exposure to social media. Affective cognitive processing is a determinant of human behavior. Actions and judgments occur in an emotional framework, and accordingly, cognitive functions such as working memory are shaped by an individual\u2019s emotional state [33]. Emotional engagement or \u201csensitivity\u201d to environmental stimuli updates working memory conentuosely and promotes the process of learning and development [34]. Research concerning mood disorders suggests that \u201cemotional\u201d cognition, specifically that related to working memory, is impaired by depression [34]. Even in non-emotional tasks like the SWM, individuals with depression seem to make more between-search errors (selecting boxes that have already been found to contain a token) with an increased difficulty level of tasks and use WM strategies less effectively [35]. Furthermore, participants with subclinical but higher depression scores than the control group performed significantly more poorly on the strategy dimension [36]. A recent study by Zhang et al. [37] investigated deficits in WM updating, specifically those related to positive information, in major depressive disorder patients. The authors uncovered a positive-specific impairment in this group of patients, suggesting that they are insensitive to positive cues in the early encoding phase of WM updating [37]. In our study, identifying the correct tokens and moving to the next level in the WM task might imply a reward value. It could be that those who are at least moderately depressed have a blunted response to this positive information. To measure this finding robustly, however, we\nBehav. Sci. 2022, 12, 16 11 of 14\nwould need to explore the relationship in a sample of individuals with clinically diagnosed depression. Another possibility explaining why this particular group performed worse on WM after social media exposure could be that acute SMU in this experiment was an \u201caffective\u201d drain on the limited-capacity working memory and that depressed individuals are more vulnerable to such a drain than healthy individuals, resulting in performances lower than those of the control group in working memory tasks. Previous research on working memory training among anxiety patients has resulted in improved working memory capacity posttraining, and this WM gain was also significantly correlated with anxiety reduction [38]. Although, in our study, we did not find poorer working memory performance associated with anxiety but rather with depression, the findings of this study do suggest that emotionally vulnerable individuals could indeed have limited working memory capacity, which is fortunately trainable."

Several previous studies reported similar findings [16\u201318], while others found a positive or negative relationship, as previously discussed. Nonetheless, there is enormous variability between the measures that were used for academic performance assessment, including the number of hours spent on social media [39] as well as social media assessment (self-reported questions) [39]. Our study assessed academic performance using GPA and smartphone screen records of hours spent on social media as objective measures, rather than relying on student reports. In light of such work, our study and similar works have introduced the notion that GPA may be contingent on changes driven by social media or working memory; it is highly possible that the higher cognitive value of maintaining a good GPA outweighs the cognitive load that could be potentially drained by social media usage, and that students are purposefully and selectively keeping their resources directed to the higher-value target (a good GPA). Research in the area suggests that GPA scores may not be a sensitive indicator of social media changes in working memory. However, this finding should be approached with caution, and longitudinal studies are needed to explore the question further."

However, the relationship between SMDS and depression was much stronger than that between SMDS and general SMU. It has been previously found that excessive social media usage is strongly correlated with the development of addictive behaviors that negatively impact emotional wellbeing. This correlation has been previously investigated by van den Eijnden et al. [6] in an attempt to include social media disordered usage in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [40] classification system of addictive disorders. The pattern found in this study could be used to explore whether lower scores on the SMDS questionnaire reflect a resilience to the impact of SMU on working memory [28]. Although the underlying mechanism of how social media usage drives addictive behavior or vice versa is not understood, the two are clearly linked. This finding requires urgent attention from health and educational professionals, given that younger generations are engaging in social media more frequently at a time of life when their personality and psychological wellbeing are still developing."

Sci. 2022, 12, 16 12 of 14\nvideos, or comments on posts. In their earlier research, Alloway et al. [41] also found that passive platforms such as YouTube did not significantly impact working memory; hence, it could be a fact that interactive engagement with platforms is essential for the effect to be reflected in working memory performance. While the social media task did receive a higher engagement rating than the painting task, this speaks more toward the need to find an equally engaging task for the control conditions in subsequent studies. Additionally, the duration and timing of the social media task used in this study might not adequately represent students\u2019 everyday use of SM or be sufficient to influence working memory performance. Furthermore, as noted in the comparison with the study by Doss et al. [32], it is possible that habitual use, as measured in one screenshot setting (as we have done in this study), may not be a true reflection of everyday social media usage and, hence, may not capture its true effect on working memory.

Future studies are necessary to fully understand the causality and underlying mechanisms of the relationship between social media, working memory, and academic achievement, possibly by implementing an experimental longitudinal design.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.F.A. and R.A.A.; data curation, A.F.A.; formal analysis, A.F.A.; funding acquisition, A.F.A., R.A.A., R.N., R.R.A., A.N., M.B. and R.H.A.; investigation, R.A.A., R.N., R.R.A., A.N., M.B. and R.H.A.; methodology, A.F.A.; project administration, A.F.A. and R.A.A.; resources, A.F.A., R.A.A., R.N., R.R.A., A.N., M.B. and R.H.A.; supervision, A.F.A.; validation, A.F.A.; visualization, A.F.A.; writing\u2014original draft, A.F.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.F.A. and R.A.A.
