Based on the provided text, the future research directions mentioned are as follows:

1. "The recent successes of AlphaFold [39] and its successor AlphaFold2 [40], two softwares that are designed to predict the structure of a protein from its sequence only, raises hope that experimental structure determination will not be a bottleneck from antiviral drug developments. The successes of using AlphaFold2 for drug discovery, however, are currently limited [44], but provide hope for better computational drug design [45]."

2. "In this review, we treated geometry, dynamics, and energetics independently: this is clearly a limitation that needs to be addressed. For example, AquaVit, our program for analyzing the environment of a protein is fast, and as such, compares favorably with the ligand mapping in molecular dynamics simulations that have been designed for detecting and characterizing binding sites in proteins. AquaVit relies, however, on the static conformation of the protein of interest, while the molecular dynamics simulations account for its dynamics. As such, they can detect cryptic binding sites in proteins [109,184,187,188], namely sites that are not accessible unless a structural change occurs. Such conformational changes are inaccessible for AquaVit."

These portions of the text suggest areas for future exploration and improvement in the fields of computational drug design and the dynamic analysis of protein structures for identifying potential drug targets.
