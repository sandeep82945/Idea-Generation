Mart\u0301\u0131 *acd\nSteady-state fluorescence spectroscopy has a central role not only for sensing applications, but also in\nbiophysics and imaging. Light switching probes, such as ruthenium dipyridophenazine complexes, have\nbeen used to study complex systems such as DNA, RNA, and amyloid fibrils. Nonetheless, steady-state\nspectroscopy is limited in the kind of information it can provide. In this paper, we use time-resolved\nspectroscopy for studying binding interactions between amyloid-b fibrillar structures and\nphotoluminescent ligands. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we demonstrate that ruthenium\ncomplexes with a pyrazino phenanthroline derivative can bind to two distinct binding sites on the\nsurface of fibrillar amyloid-b, in contrast with previous studies using steady-state photoluminescence\nspectroscopy, which only identified one binding site for similar compounds. The second elusive binding\nsite is revealed when deconvoluting the signals from the time-resolved decay traces, allowing the\ndetermination of dissociation constants of 3 and 2.2 mM. Molecular dynamic simulations agree with two\nbinding sites on the surface of amyloid-b fibrils. Time-resolved spectroscopy was also used to monitor\nthe aggregation of amyloid-b in real-time. In addition, we show that common polypyridine complexes\ncan bind to amyloid-b also at two different binding sites. Information on how molecules bind to amyloid\nproteins is important to understand their toxicity and to design potential drugs that bind and quench\ntheir deleterious effects. The additional information contained in time-resolved spectroscopy provides\na powerful tool not only for studying excited state dynamics but also for sensing and revealing important\ninformation about the system including hidden binding sites."

            "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease that affects the human brain, particularly in elderly people, with symptoms that include memory loss, confusion, and personality changes.1 The amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes the accumulation of amyloid-b (Ab) aggregates as a mechanism in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.2,3 While the relation between amyloid aggregates (soluble and insoluble) and the onset of AD has been known for more than 100 years, it was only last year when the rst amyloid-targeting drug (an antibody called Aducanumab4) was approved by the FDA, with many other medications of the\nHouston, TX, USA.

See DOI:\n1\nsame kind on the horizon.5 This has prompted a resurgence of interest in small molecule-based treatments targeting amyloids. Understanding how small molecules bind and interact with amyloid aggregates is, therefore, essential to developing appropriate treatments for AD. The study of binding sites in amyloid aggregates has greatly beneted from the use of photoluminescence titration experiments. This method provides the dissociation constants of ligands by simply measuring the steady-state photoluminescence intensities over a series of samples. However, standard steady-state titration methodologies have the drawback that they assume the target molecule has a single unique binding site. Therefore, the presence of multiple binding sites needs to be conrmed through other analytical methods.6\nA different method to study the photoluminescence of a molecular probe is time-resolved spectroscopy.

View Article Online have used lifetime in qualitative ways, not fully capitalizing on the reach of time-resolved spectroscopy. We have expanded the application of time-resolved spectroscopy to determine quantitative binding information on brillar amyloids. This also compensates for the shortfalls of steady-state photoluminescence titrations, particularly when photoluminescent metal complexes are used as probes.\nWe have previously reported the use of photoluminescent metal complexes of ruthenium11\u201315 and rhenium16,17 to study amyloid aggregates.18,19 Particularly, we investigated the binding of light-switching ruthenium and rhenium dipyridophenazine complexes to Ab brils using steady-state photoluminescence titrations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,11 and photochemical footprinting.16 These studies have provided important information on the binding equilibrium of small molecules to Ab, but the values were obtained under the assumption that Ab has only one binding site. In another work, we used a ruthenium polypyridyl complex ([Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+, bpy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine, dpqp = pyrazino [2\u2032,3\u2032:5,6]pyrazino[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline) to monitor the formation of Ab oligomers using photoluminescence anisotropy.15 This metal complex was selected because it lacks a strong light-switching response in the presence of Ab aggregates,20 which enable us to observe the anisotropy change of the complex. A molecule without the light-switching response is impractical for determining the binding information using steady-state photoluminescence titration; however, it is ideal for monitoring all the species present in a system (e.g. bound to Ab brils and free in solution) using time-resolved spectroscopy.\nHere, we study binding sites on Ab using [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)] 2+ as a probe and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy to evaluate the concentration of probes bound to Ab. When performing titrations to elucidate the binding equilibrium, we found that two different binding sites are present, one that promotes a change in the lifetime of the ruthenium complex and the other that does not affect the lifetime. MD simulations were carried out to shed light on the nature of the interaction between [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ and Ab brils. By selectively deconvoluting the emission from [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ bound to Ab, we were able to monitor the aggregation of Ab in real-time. The formation of Ab brils was conrmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In addition, we demonstrated the binding of common ruthenium and iridium polypyridine complexes ([Ru(bpy)3] 2+ and [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)] +, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) to two different binding sites on Ab brils. Interestingly, both [Ru(bpy)3] 2+ and [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)] + showed binding to Ab, even when they do not have traditional Ab recognition (or binding) elements. Due to the relevance of Ab aggregation on the development of AD, elucidating new ways to study Ab aggregates, their binding sites, and the process of aggregation is of great importance."

The absorbance of the ltered solution was compared to the absorbance of a control sample of a non-incubated buffered solution of Ab, both measured at 280 nm. The non-bril components of the nal incubated solution was determined to be ca. 6% of the starting concentration of Ab monomers.

The photoluminescence decay can be expressed as:\nI\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Xn i\u00bc1 Aiexp\u00f0 t=si\u00de (1)\nwhere Ai is the photoluminescence intensity at time zero (also called the preexponential factor or amplitude) and si is the lifetime of the ith component. The excited state decay of a photoluminescent molecule in dilute solution of a pure solvent can be typically described with a single exponential (i= 1 in eqn (1)). However, when more complex environments are present, then multiple exponentials are needed to describe the time-decay curves. The photoluminescence lifetime of d6 metal polypyridyl complexes is generally in the range of tens of nanoseconds to microseconds due to a mixed singlet-triplet excited state.38\u201346 This photoluminescence is sensitive to the microenvironment around the complex.

This is because the lifetime and preexponential factors are proportional to the emission intensity of each component and ultimately to the concentration of the free and Ab-bound species. The total photoluminescence intensity (for a two lifetimes decay) can be determined by integrating the decay law (eqn (1)) as:\nI \u00bc I1 \u00fe I2 \u00bc \u00f0\u00feN 0\n\u00f0A1 exp\u00f0 t=s1\u00de \u00fe A2 exp\u00f0 t=s2\u00de\u00dedt \u00bc A1s1 \u00fe A2s2 (2)\nwhere I1 and I2 are the intensities of component 1 and 2, A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of component 1 and 2, and s1 and s2 are the lifetimes of component 1 and 2, respectively.\nTo study the interaction of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)] 2+ and Ab, we performed a titration experiment where the concentration of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ is held constant and the integrated photoluminescence is plotted as a function of the concentration of Ab brils. Interestingly, the emergence of the 1082 ns component can be tracked clearly (Fig. 2a red curve) and shows a behavior similar to previous amyloid binding dyes that have been tted to the one-site model below:\nIbound \u00bc 1 2 dRu Ab 2 4Kd \u00fe \u00bdRu 0 \u00fe \u00bdAb 0n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Kd \u00fe \u00bdRu 0 \u00fe \u00bdAb 0 n 2 4\u00bdRu 0 \u00bdAb 0 n s 3 5 (3)\nwhere, dRu\u2212Ab is the proportionality constant that relates the photoluminescence signal and the concentration of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]2+, Kd is the dissociation constant, [Ru]0 and [Ab]0 are the total concentrations of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ and Ab brils respectively, and n is the number of Ab monomers that come together to form the binding site.

However, when we examine the intensity of the 446 ns component, the lifetime seems to decrease initially before reaching to a steady-state and not decaying to zero. While the 1082 ns component intensity seems to be leveling off near 80 mM Ab brils (shown in Fig. 2a, red curve), the 446 ns component still shows more than 60% of its original intensity (shown in Fig. 2a, blue curve). This behavior is completely unexpected and only observable due to the ability of time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy to provide information about the different species present. This new information led us to conclude that a different binding model is necessary to explain the data in Fig. 2a.\nThe behavior of the data in Fig. 2a can be explained by considering an additional binding site (site 2) that would allow the binding of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ to Ab without inuencing its lifetime. This is in contrast with what happens when the probe binds to site 1, which promotes an increase in lifetime to ca. 1082 ns. Due to the relative rigidity of the Ab bril's backbone (in comparison with well-folded proteins), we will assume these binding sites are independent of each other.

Similarly, the saturation curve for the 446 ns component (composed of free and bound ligand) can be tted to:\nA2s2 \u00bc \u00bdRu b2 \u00fe \u00bdRu d2\n\u00bc 1 d2 0 BBBB@ \u00bdRu Kd2 0 BBBB@ \u00bdRu 0 \u00bdAb 0 m \u00bdRu \u00bdRu 2 \u00f0Kd1\u00de\u00f0Kd2\u00de 1 ! 1 CCCCA 1\u00fe \u00bdRu Kd1 \u00fe \u00bdRu 1 CCCCA (12)\nwhere d2 is a proportionally constant that relates the intensity of the 446 ns component with its concentration and [Ru] is given by (9). Here, since the lifetime of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ does not change between free in solution versus bound to site 2, we make the reasonable assumption that the quantum yield of free and bound [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ is similar and a single d2 value is adequate to describe the trend. While (11) and (12) could be t independently to A1s1 and A2s2 respectively, the real challenge is to t the two sets of data with two equations simultaneously, while minimizing the parameters Kd1, Kd2, d1 and d2. Parameters n and m have been selected to be 5 for simplicity and implies a single ruthenium complex is bound to 5 Ab monomers (see MD simulation below for rationale). Fig. 2a, S5a and b\u2020 shows\n1076 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 1072\u20131081\ncurve ts of the data, and Table S1\u2020 displays the obtained parameters. Table 1 shows the averages and standard deviations of these three sets of experiments. Using the data in Table S1a,\u2020 we simulated [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ binding to site 1, site 2, and free in solution at different concentrations of Ab (Fig. 2b). The two blue curves, one increasing and one decreasing, represent the binding of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ to site 2 and the disappearing of free [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ as the Ab concentration increases, respectively. The sum of the two blue curves in Fig. 2b, yield the blue curve in Fig. 2a.\nThe ability to extract the different species contributing to an emission signal has led us to propose the existence of two different binding sites on Ab: site 1 that affects the lifetime of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ and site 2, which shows a smaller dissociation constant and does not present a change in lifetime upon binding to Ab. To investigate the nature of these binding sites, we combined molecular docking with all-atomMD simulations. We observed in the energetically stable poses (Fig. S1 and S2\u2020) provided by the docking procedure that the metal complex was bound to the Val18-Phe20 region (Fig. 3) and on the surface near Asn27 on the Ab bril (Fig. 4). In the Val18-Phe20 site, the bpy and dpqp ligands of the metal complex associate with the brils through hydrophobic interactions. In detail, both bpy and dpqp ligands interact with the side chains of multiple Phe20 via CH\u2013 p and p\u2013p interactions, and the aromatic ring of dpqp ligand interacts with the side chain of Val18 via CH\u2013p interaction. This binding site largely remained unchanged throughout the 200 ns MD simulations in explicit aqueous solution (Fig. S3\u2020). In the equilibrated structure, there was only a slight shi of the metal complex towards Phe20 residues (Fig. 3a). In particular, both CH\u2013p and p\u2013p interactions between the dpqp ring and Phe20 became stronger, while CH\u2013p interaction with the side chains of Val18 got weaker (Fig. 3b). At this site, the dpqp ligand is deeply buried in the hydrophobic cle of the bril, whereas both bpy fragments are located on the opposite side towards the solvent (Fig. 3c). This binding site was similar to the one proposed for the binding of [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]\n2+ 11 and [Re(CO)3(dppz)(Py)]\n+ 16 to the Ab bril. In this site, the [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ complex was found to interact with at least four Ab monomers.

View Article Online a weaker binding to the Val18-Phe20 hydrophobic pocket (and therefore larger dissociation constants). Alternatively, for the other site (site 2), the backbone of Ser26 shows H bonds with the N atom on the dpqp ring. Here, the ruthenium complex is surrounded by hydrophilic amino acids such as Ser, Asn and Lys, which is likely the reason why its lifetime is barely affected. Previously, we proposed this hydrophilic binding site for [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]\n2+, but it was discarded at the time because the location of amino acids 1\u20138 made this site less accessible to [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]\n2+.11 It must be noted that amino acids 1\u20138 assume a random coil conformation and are not present in the model used.28,49,50 Simulations on this truncated peptide (Ab9\u201340) using two different force elds and water models provide similar structures for this binding site (Fig. S6b\u2020). The binding free energy (BFE) computed utilizing ldynamics of this site is \u221218.4 kcal mol\u22121, which is 11.0 kcal mol\u22121 more favorable than the one computed for site 1 (Table S2\u2020), and can compensate for the steric constraints of amino acids 1\u20138. The BFE calculated through the MM/PBSA method for the AMBER 03/TIP3P and AMBER 99-ILDN/TIP4PEW methods is also favorable by \u221216.7 and \u221211.8 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, in comparison to the site 1. This difference in BFE is caused by stronger hydrogen bonding at this site in comparison to the interactions at site 1. Interestingly, the more negative BFE value observed for site 2 agrees qualitatively with the smaller dissociation constant obtained experimentally for this site. However, quantitatively, the calculated BFE values indicate that binding to site 2 is more than twice as favorable as site 1, while the difference between the calculated Kd1 and Kd2 are small. The larger than expected Kd2 can be explained due to the presence of amino acids 1\u20138 in the real peptide that is expected to partially block the access to Ser26, Asn27, and Lys28 reducing the affinity of site 2 to [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+. Time-resolved photoluminescence could also be used as a tool to detect Ab aggregation in real-time. For this, we incubated Ab at 37 \u00b0C with orbital shaking at 600 rpm and analyzed aliquots at different time points using time-resolved spectroscopy. The photoluminescence decay curves for [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]2+ were obtained at different incubation times. The lifetime decay curves were tted to eqn (1) (biexponential decays were only used when monoexponential decays did not satisfactorily t the data), allowing for the photoluminescent intensity of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ bound to site 1 to be selectively determined (eqn (2)). The real-time assay is shown in Fig. 5 and displays a typical sigmoidal curve for Ab aggregation. The intensity is low during the lag phase (0\u2013100 minutes) where bril growth does not take place, and AFM shows only small spherical structures, which correspond to Ab monomers and oligomers. In this lag phase, [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ is in the presence of soluble Ab (which could contain monomers and oligomers),15 but there was no observed difference in lifetime. This is followed by a phase where brils are formed and elongated (propagation) which occurs from 100\u2013320minutes. AFM images obtained from samples at 120 minutes incubation, shortly aer the lag phase, showed some short Ab brils. A saturation phase is reached aer 240 minutes where most Ab has been converted to brils. AFM of the 240 minutes incubation sample displays\n1078 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 1072\u20131081\nabundant long Ab brils. Parallel experiments done by measuring the uorescence of ThT in the same samples show good agreement between the ThT uorescence and the timeresolved deconvolution of the [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+. The extracted halime of aggregation from the sigmoidal curves in Fig. 5 were 128 min and 133 min for ThT uorescence measurement and [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ lifetime measurement, respectively. This corroborates that both probes respond similarly to the aggregation of Ab.\nThroughout this paper, we have shown that time-resolved spectroscopy can be used as a tool to extract information on molecular binding not accesible through conventional steadystate spectroscopy. To consolidate these observations, we explored two common polypyridine metal complexes without a conventional Ab binding element, for example, dppz or dpqp. We used commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+ and synthesized [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]\n+, and obtained the time-resolved decays as a function of the concentration of Ab (ESI Fig. S7a\u2020 and 6a respectively). [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+ showed a 380 ns lifetime in airequilibrated aqueous solution. Similar to [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+, the lifetime decay of [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+ became biexponential with a second component of 774 ns when Ab nanobrils were added (Fig. S7a\u2020). The photoluminescence intensities of the different components (obtained from eqn (2)) as a function of Ab concentration were plotted in Fig. S7b.\u2020 The intensities of the 380 ns component did not reach zero, similar to the short lifetime component of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+. Therefore, we tted the data with the two-binding site model based on eqn (11) and (12). The resulting dissociation constants for 774 ns and 380 ns were 21 mM and 4.6 mM, respectively (Table S3a\u2020). In the case of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+, the dissociation constant of the longer lifetime component was signicantly smaller than [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+. This supported that the extended p system is important for the hydrophobic interaction between Val18-Phe20 of Ab and metal complexes. For [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]\n+, the decay of the complex without Ab was monoexponential (ca. 41 ns), while with Ab, the decay shows three components with lifetimes of ca. 41 ns, 252 ns, and 572 ns (Fig. 6a). The latter two are due to the complex\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFig. 6 Photoluminescence lifetime of [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)] + with Ab fibrils.

            "text": "In summary, our studies have shown that time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy can be used to deconvolute binding sites of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ to Ab brils. The dissociation constants for each binding site can bemathematically determined and reveal specic information about [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ bound to Ab. By considering a two sites non-cooperative binding model, we propose the existence of two different binding sites on Ab: one that affects the lifetime of [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ (driven by hydrophobic interactions) and one in which the lifetime is unchanged (driven by polar interactions). MD simulations lead us to propose that these two sites are the hydrophobic cle between Phe20 and Val18 and the bril side nearby Asn27. We also showed that we can use [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]\n2+ and time-resolved spectroscopy to monitor the aggregation of Ab in real-time, which was conrmed by ThT assays and AFM. Finally, we used time-resolved spectroscopy to demonstrate that the common polypyridine complexes, [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+ and [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]\n+, can bind to Ab. This study demonstrates that timeresolved photoluminescence spectroscopy can be a powerful tool not only for excited-state dynamics but also for sensing and uncovering binding sites, which could be hidden in steady-state photoluminescence studies. The method developed in this paper can be extrapolated to study a variety of biomolecules, potentially revealing new binding sites. In addition, these principles can be used to enhance the application of FLIM to the study of amyloid aggregates. Understanding amyloid binding sites is central to the development of Ab-binding drugs that inhibit or quench the toxicity of Ab to neural cells.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
