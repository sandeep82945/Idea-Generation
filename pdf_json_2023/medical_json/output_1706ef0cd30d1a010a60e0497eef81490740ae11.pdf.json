    "abstractText": "Non-contact temperature measurement of persons during an epidemic is the most preferred measurement option because of the safety of personnel and minimal possibility of spreading infection. The use of infrared (IR) sensors to monitor building entrances for infected persons has seen a major boom between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 epidemic, but with questionable results. This article does not deal with the precise determination of the temperature of an individual person but focuses on the possibility of using infrared cameras for monitoring the health of the population. The aim is to use large amounts of infrared data from many locations to provide information to epidemiologists so they can have better information about potential outbreaks. This paper focuses on the long-term monitoring of the temperature of passing persons inside public buildings and the search for the most appropriate tools for this purpose and is intended as the first step towards creating a useful tool for epidemiologists. As a classical approach, the identification of persons based on their characteristic temperature values over time throughout the day is used. These results are compared with the results of a method using artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate temperature from simultaneously acquired infrared images. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods",

By monitoring epidemics, public health authorities can identify outbreaks, track the spread of the disease, and implement effective control measures. Passive surveillance is the most common method for monitoring epidemics, as it relies on healthcare providers to report confirmed cases to public health authorities. This allows public health authorities to track the incidence and distribution of the disease, but it may not detect all cases, as some individuals may not seek medical care or may be misdiagnosed. Many infectious diseases cause a rise in body temperature. Thereby, temperature monitoring across the population could bring valuable information about the spread of diseases in populations. For such purposes, widespread use of thermographic cameras could be used, as they can measure temperature quickly and easily, without the need for physical contact and thus reducing the risk of cross-infection. This makes them useful in situations where it is necessary to screen a large number of individuals in a short period of time, such as in airports or other public places. The accuracy of thermographic cameras for the purpose of precise human temperature measurement has been the subject of some debate [1]. Some studies have shown that the cameras can be affected by many factors, e.g., environmental factors, such as ambient temperature and humidity, which can lead to inaccuracies in temperature readings. Additionally, some individuals may have underlying medical conditions that can affect the accuracy of the readings (e.g., inflammation of the eye and cold sores).\nSensors 2023, 23, 2945. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23062945 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2945 2 of 14\nInfrared cameras do not allow the measurement of the body\u2019s core temperature, but it is possible to measure the surface temperature. Usually, the area at the corner of the eye (inner canthus) where the temperature is the most stable is measured. It reaches a few degrees lower value than body temperature\u2014somewhere between 33.5 \u25e6C and 36.9 \u25e6C [2]. The correlation between thermographic measurement of the eye\u2019s maximum temperature and the armpit measurement were presented in [3] (mean value differences up to 0.5 \u25e6C, standard deviation of the thermographic measurement of the eyes\u2019 maximum temperature 0.4\u20130.9 \u25e6C). A very strong and positive correlation between the ear temperature (ear contact thermometer) and the forehead temperature measured using high-resolution IR camera was shown in [4]. That suggests forehead temperature could be used for estimation of body\u2019s core temperature. On the contrary, the review article [5], which is focused on the major issues related to the automatic face recognition and ROI selection for the rapid fever assessment, shows that the maximum temperature from the eye inner canthus seems to be the most reliable method to assess fever [5], more relevant than a forehead temperature examination [3]. The article [6] addresses the choice of ROIs (regions of interest) on the human face for the analysis of the individual\u2019s fever and deals with the temperature thresholds used for this analysis. In [7], it is stated that the traditional thermography method for fever classification (measurements of forehead average temperature and eye maximum temperature greater than 37.5 \u25e6C) would not be enough to produce the fever group classification for the proposed CNN algorithm (convolutional neural network). The authors in [8] confirmed that the use of inner canthi temperatures provide clinical approaches for fever screening and in cases of its unavailability the full-face maximum temperatures may provide an effective alternate approach. The influence of high/low ambient temperature to the temperature of measured people is well known. The experiments in simulated/actual environmental conditions in [9] proved that there must be an acclimatization period ranging from 2 to 9 min depending on the outdoor temperature before temperature screening. The use of relative temperature difference for screening patients with fever is recommended in [10] in the case of ambient temperatures higher than 37.5 \u25e6C. There are many methods of temperature monitoring based on the principle that temperatures higher than the set threshold relate to a possible fever of the investigated person. Such methods and systems were introduced by most IR camera producers in 2020 with the spreading of the COVID-19 disease epidemic [2,11\u201314]. In [2] there is the method improved using a moving threshold value affected by environmental influences and previous tested persons. Some systems were also equipped with visible cameras [13]. Many commercial solutions were tested by IPVM (Internet Protocol Video Market) with questionable results [1]. Infrared cameras can be used and are used for enabling/disabling entry into public buildings (hospitals, authorities, factories, etc.) or into a restricted area, e.g., at the airport, etc., as was predicted in 2004 [15]. At all places, the person is measured and declared healthy or sick. His/her data are not evaluated from a statistical point of view or for longer period (weeks, months, etc.). Thermographic cameras for measuring human temperature have been widely used during pandemics, as it is stated in the overview article [5] and this introduction. The IR camera usage was nonetheless focused mainly on identification of people with higher temperature in certain places. It was not meant as long-term tool for epidemiologists, which could help them predict and control the spread of infectious diseases and protect public health. This paper focuses on long-term epidemic monitoring using thermographic data and the search for the most appropriate tools for this purpose. The article is intended as the first step towards creating a useful tool for epidemiologists.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2945 3 of 14"

            "text": "This study was focused on the initial verification of thermographic data use for epidemiological purposes. Several places were considered for installation of IR cameras. They had to fulfill following requirements:\n\u2022 Passing people should have steady-state temperature. \u2022 They should have a constant distance from the measuring device. \u2022 They should not come from the exterior. \u2022 They should not come from all directions. \u2022 They should not be bothered by the measurement. \u2022 The place should be a publicly accessible place.\nIt should be emphasized that the steady-state temperature in this case is the temperature of the human body under steady-state environmental conditions. Steady-state human body temperature is reached within 30 min according to EN IEC 80601-2-59. Based on these requirements, several infrared cameras were installed in the pharmacy, the secondary school and the municipal office. This study uses only data from the pharmacy, which is located in the middle of the shopping center. This location meets all the requirements for individual measurements. Since the pharmacy is located in the middle of the mall, persons entering the pharmacy have already been in the mall long enough (~30 min) to reach a steady-state temperature condition. However, in the very limited cases where a person is coming from outside directly into the pharmacy (it takes approximately 5 min to travel from the nearest entrance), the steady-state temperature condition may not be ideal. This study is intended to serve as an initial insight into what can be expected from the analysis of the temperature of people passing by and what interesting information can be offered for epidemiological purposes. The results at the end show promising correlations between the measured data and data from general practitioners on people with respiratory diseases."

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the major worldwide health problems associated with high morbidity and mortality [16]. One of the most common pathogens which are associated with ARI are influenza virus (IFV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and human coronavirus (HCoV). ARIs are a very pressing problem in epidemiology. One of the most common symptoms is a higher body temperature. Therefore, data about ARI were compared with thermographic data. The ARI data were obtained from the local public health office. The health center is informed weekly by general practitioners of the number of patients with ARIs in the prescribed age groups. The health center adds up the figures from all practitioners and recalculates them per 100,000 population. For the purpose of this study the total number of patients in all groups were used for a comparison."

            "text": "The article deals with the noncontact temperature measurement of passing people using an IR camera. It is focused on the methods of data evaluation and the comparison of the classic approach\u2014temperature\u2013time identification of person (TTI)\u2014with face temperature identification by AI (FTI). The correct use of the thermal sensor (IR camera) is discussed. The selection of appropriate places inside a building enables avoiding heated/cooled people in summer/winter. In addition, the automatic opening door to the pharmacy, where the camera was placed, helps distinguish individual entering people. The number of identified people and their maximum temperatures obtained by both methods are in good correlation. The mean value of temperature for the TTI method is 0.35 \u25e6C higher than the mean temperature resulting from the FTI method, and the values of standard deviations are almost the same for both methods, approximately \u00b10.9 \u25e6C\u2014see Figure 7. The number of people measured with the IR camera identified by the FTI and TTI methods differs on average by 150 persons per day because of the method of evaluation of the single IR images (only a person facing the IR camera works for the FTI method). The comparison between temperature evaluation and time trend data from the public health office shows very good correlation. The results seem to be interesting for public health purposes to monitor or predict epidemic trends. Preparations are being made to build the FTI method in a simplified form into the recording software for future work. Our idea is to identify the presence of a person in the view of the IR camera using AI and record only correct single IR images and save only temperature values belonging to that person instead of continuous saving of values throughout the whole day. Future work in the field will be focused on the correlation between measured temperatures and data obtained from the local public health office. Promising results are presented in this study, but a longer period of measurements is needed to fully validate this approach.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.T., L.M. and M.H.; methodology, J.T., L.M., J.S. and T.K.; software\u2014data acquisition, J.S., software\u2014data evaluation, J.T., L.M. and T.K.; validation, L.M.; formal analysis, J.T. and L.M.; investigation, J.T., L.M. and T.K.; resources, M.H.; data curation,\nSensors 2023, 23, 2945 13 of 14\nJ.T., L.M. and T.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.T. and L.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.T., L.M., J.S., T.K. and M.H.; visualization, J.T. and L.M.; supervision, J.T., L.M. and M.H.; project administration, M.H.; funding acquisition, M.H.
