    "abstractText": "Plants produce a wide variety of pharmacologically active molecules classified as natural products. Derivatization of these natural products can modulate or improve the bioactivity of the parent compound. Unfortunately, chemical derivatization of natural products is often difficult or impractical. Here we use the newly discovered biosynthetic genes for two monoterpene indole alkaloids, alstonine and stemmadenine acetate, to generate analogs of these compounds. We reconstitute these biosynthetic genes in the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana along with an unnatural starting substrate to produce the corresponding new-to-nature alkaloid product.",

Derivatization of these natural products can modulate or improve the bioactivity of the parent compound. Unfortunately, chemical derivatization of natural products is often difficult or impractical. Here we use the newly discovered biosynthetic genes for two monoterpene indole alkaloids, alstonine and stemmadenine acetate, to generate analogs of these compounds. We reconstitute these biosynthetic genes in the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana along with an unnatural starting substrate to produce the corresponding new-to-nature alkaloid product.\nKeywords: natural product, directed biosynthesis, new-to-nature products, Nicotiana benthamiana, monoterpene indole alkaloid, alstonine, stemmadenine\nINTRODUCTION\nNicotiana benthamiana, a plant belonging to the Solanaceae family, has been widely used as a system for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering efforts. A notable application of N. benthamiana includes the reconstitution of metabolic pathways that yield high value small molecules (specialized metabolites or natural products) through transient transformation (Akhtar et al., 2011; Arntzen, 2015; Bally et al., 2015; Liu, 2022). N. benthamiana has, to date, been employed for the production of many different plant specialized metabolites including alkaloids (Miettinen et al., 2014), betalains (Polturak et al., 2016), terpenoids (Reed and Osbourn, 2018), glucosinolates (Crocoll et al., 2016), and cyanogens (Rajniak et al., 2015). In this approach, leaves of young N. benthamiana plants are infiltrated with a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that harbors the gene of interest in a plant expression construct. To express multi-gene pathways, a leaf of an intact N. benthamiana plant is simultaneously co-infiltrated with different A. tumefaciens strains, where each A. tumefaciens strain harbors a different gene in the desired expression construct. Heterologous protein produced in the infected N. benthamiana leaf reaches a peak between 5- and 7- days after the infiltration, resulting in the production of the pathway metabolite (LeBlanc et al., 2021). N. benthamiana is an ideal host in which to reconstitute plant derived metabolic pathways, since this plant host contains all cofactors, intracellular compartments, and protein folding machinery required for successful production of plant proteins (Reed and Osbourn, 2018).\nThe plant Catharanthus roseus (Apocynaceae) is a medicinal plant that produces over 100 specialized metabolites classified as monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs). MIAs have diverse biological activities, including anti-cancer (vinblastine and vincristine), anti-psychotic (alstonine), anti-hypertensive (ajmaline) and anti-malarial (quinine) (van Der Heijden et al., 2004;\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 919443\nElisabetsky and Costa-Campos, 2006; Achan et al., 2011; Monasky et al., 2021). The universal MIA precursor in plants is strictosidine, a biosynthetic intermediate that is formed via an enzyme-catalyzed (strictosidine synthase, CrSTR) PictetSpengler condensation of the monoterpenoid secologanin and amino acid derived tryptamine (Figure 1A; Mizukami et al., 1979; Treimer and Zenk, 1979). The deglycosylation of strictosidine, catalyzed by strictosidine glucosidase (CrSGD), is the starting point for the biosynthesis of anti-cancer drug vinblastine. The biosynthetic pathway of vinblastine, which comprises ca. 30 enzymatic steps, proceeds from strictosidine aglycone through a series of unstable intermediates to form the central biosynthetic precursor, stemmadenine acetate (Supplementary Figure 1). Strictosidine aglycone is acted upon by a medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (MDR), geissoschizine synthase (CrGS) to generate geissoschizine. This is oxidized to dehydropreakuamicine by a cytochrome P450, geissoschizine oxidase (CrGO). The MDR CrRedox 1 and the aldo-keto reductase CrRedox2 (Tatsis et al., 2017; Qu et al., 2018) reduce dehydropreakuamicine to stemmadenine and then finally an acetyl transferase (stemmadenine acetyltransferase, Cr SAT) generates stemmadenine acetate (Qu et al., 2018; Figure 1B). A variety of alkaloids, including the direct precursors of vinblastine, catharanthine and tabersonine, are generated from stemmadenine acetate. In the case of catharanthine and tabersonine biosynthesis, stemmadenine acetate is oxidized (PAS), reduced (DPAS) and then cyclized (CS or TS) (Supplementary Figure 1). Moreover, in addition to the vinblastine biosynthetic pathway, C. roseus produces over 100 additional MIA that derive from strictosidine aglycone. The compound alstonine is generated by reduction of strictosidine aglycone (Shamma and Richey, 1963) to tetrahydroalstonine through the action of the MDR tetrahydroalstonine synthase (CrTHAS) (Stavrinides et al., 2015, 2016) and then converted to alstonine by a cytochrome P450, alstonine synthase (CrAS) (Dang et al., 2018; Figure 1C). Alstonine has antipsychotic (Costa-Campos et al., 1999; Elisabetsky and Costa-Campos, 2006) and antiplasmodial (Arnold et al., 2021) activities.\nAfter establishing a system for biosynthetic pathway reconstitution, a variety of metabolic engineering strategies can be used to modify the biosynthetic pathway to produce \u201cunnatural\u201d or \u201cnew-to-nature\u201d compounds. We have previously employed N. benthamiana as a heterologous host for the production of simple tryptophan-derived new-to-nature auxin analogs by generating plant-derived auxin biosynthetic enzymes in combination with bacterial halogenases (Davis et al., 2020). Here, we reconstitute the biosynthetic pathways of both stemmadenine acetate and alstonine in the plant N. benthamiana to establish a platform for the production of analogs of these compounds via precursor-directed biosynthesis starting from unnatural substrate analogs. We generated analogs of strictosidine in vitro using tryptamine derivatives ( fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, methyl-, methoxy, hydroxyl-tryptamines) as starting material and the Pictet-Spenglerase CrSTR as catalyst. These analogs were then purified and co-infiltrated into N. benthamiana along with the biosynthetic genes for either stemmadenine acetate (CrSGD, CrGS, CrGO, CrReDOX1, CrReDOX2, CrSAT) or\nalstonine (CrSGD, CrTHAS, CrAS). This work demonstrates that it is possible to use directed biosynthesis in combination with heterologous reconstitution in N. benthamiana to produce new-to-nature complex alkaloid analogs."

The gradient was 10% B from 0 to 6 min, 30% B from 6 to 6.1 min, 100% B from 6.10 to 7.50 min and 10% B from 7.6 to 11 min. The analysis was carried out in positive mode (ESI) and the samples were kept at 10\u25e6C. The injection volume of both the standard solutions and the samples was 2 \u00b5L. Capillary voltage was 3,500 V; the source was kept at 450\u25e6C; cone temperature was 350\u25e6C; cone gas flow 20 L/h; and nebulizer gas flow, 50 L/h. Unit resolution was applied to each quadrupole. Flow injections of serpentine, stemmadenine acetate, tetrahydroalstonine and akuammicine were used to optimize the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) conditions. The cone voltage was experimentally determined and the collision energies were automatically adjusted by the MS Workstation software 8.2 (Bruker). A dwell time of at least 25 ms was applied to each MRM transition. For the detection and quantification of analogs for which authentic standards were not available, MRM signals were predicted based on the fragmentation patterns and collision energies (Supplementary\nTable 4) of the parent standards.\nHigh resolution and MS/MS analysis of the halogenated analogs produced in N. benthamiana was performed on a qExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo) coupled to a Vanquish UPLC system (Thermo).

Mobile phases were: A = 0.1% formic acid and B = acetonitrile. The gradient was 10% B at time 0 and until 1 min, linear gradient from 1 min to 6 min up to 30% B, at 6.1 min 100% B until 7.9 min, then column re-equilibration at 10% B until time 10 min.

The source parameters were: Spray voltage 3.5 kV, Capillary temperature 250\u25e6C, gas temperature 400\u25e6C. Data\nwere acquired in Parallel reaction Monitoring (PRM) mode in which the instrument acquires MS/MS scans based on a specified inclusion list. The quadrupole isolates the precursor ions, which are then sent to the C-Trap and transmitted to the HCD cell for fragmentation. The fragmented ions return to the C-Trap and are subsequently injected into the Orbitrap mass analyzer. The inclusion list was constituted of the following masses: m/z 349.15467 (C21H20N2O3) for alstonine and serpentine, m/z 367.14525 (C21H19N2O3F) F-alstonine, m/z 383.11570 (C21H19N2O3Cl) for Cl-alstonine, m/z 397.21218 for stemmadenine acetate (C23H28N2O4) and m/z 415.20276 (C23H27N2O4F) for F-stemmadenine acetate."

            "text": "Many analogs of natural products are used in pharmacology and medicine (Guo, 2017). These analogs are often made synthetically or semi-synthetically, but directed biosynthesis provides an alternative method for accessing these compounds (Sun et al., 2015). By adding different functional groups to a molecule, it is possible to modify and improve interactions with the active site of the target protein and alter the physiochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties (Jeschke, 2004). Halogenation\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 919443\nand chlorination are just two of the modifications that can change the properties of a compound. Indeed, methylation, metoxylation and hydroxylation can alter the activity and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. Methylation is a modification that can improve potency and the duration of the effect of medicinal drugs (Bazzini and Wermuth, 2008), by modifying solubility, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics of the compounds (Barreiro et al., 2011). The introduction of a hydroxyl group can change the physicochemical proprieties of a molecule by increasing its polarity, improving the selectivity and the affinity with receptors (Cramer et al., 2019).\nPreviously, we performed directed biosynthesis to generate analogs of monoterpene indole alkaloids in the native plant producer C. roseus. We incubated both seedlings and hairy root cultures of C. roseus with tryptamine and strictosidine analogs and observed the incorporation of these precursors into a variety of monoterpene indole alkaloids (McCoy and O\u2019Connor, 2006). Now many of the MIA genes of C. roseus have been identified, which allows heterologous expression of these pathways, rather than utilizing the endogenous pathways of the native producer plant. Therefore, we explored whether heterologous reconstitution of two representative C. roseus derived monoterpene indole alkaloid pathways in N. benthamiana could be used in combination with infiltration of non-natural substrates to generate alkaloid analogs.\nThe two compounds that we selected for this study were alstonine and stemmadenine acetate. Alstonine has antipsychotic activity, while stemmadenine acetate is an advanced precursor for two anticancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine. The pathway genes for both of these compounds have been identified. For this study, we first generated analogs of strictosidine in vitro, by an enzymatic condensation of secologanin and tryptamine analogs (fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, methyl-, methoxy-, hydroxyl-tryptamines) catalyzed by C. roseus STR (Figure 2). We employed these analogs as a substrate for the entry point of the stemmadenine acetate and alstonine pathways in N. benthamiana. We cloned three genes, CrSGD, CrTHAS and CrAS for the production of alstonine and six genes CrSGD, CrGS, CrGO, CrReDOX1, CrReDOX2, and CrSAT for the production of stemmadenine acetate in a binary vector. Each gene was transformed into an individual A. tumefaciens GV3101 strain, and then the mixture of strains was infiltrated in our plant heterologous host for the transient expression. These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reconstitute synthetic pathways for the production of new-to-nature alkaloids by infiltrating a non-natural substrate while co-expressing the pathway genes in N. benthamiana.\nWhen precursor-directed biosynthesis was used with C. roseus hairy root culture, milligram quantities of selected fluorinated and methylated alkaloids were collected (McCoy et al., 2006). 1HNMR analysis confirmed the production of 5-fluoro-ajmalicine (stereoisomer of tetrahydroalstonine), 5-fluoro, 6-fluoro, and 7- methyl-serpentine (stereoisomer of alstonine) and 6-fluoro and 7-methyl-akuammacine. We made no attempt to heterologously produce ajmalicine and serpentine in this study because the C. roseus biosynthetic enzyme that yields these specific stereoisomers has not yet been identified; therefore, in this study\nwe focused on the alternative stereoisomers tetrahydroalstonine and alstonine, for which selective biosynthetic enzymes have been identified. The presence of akuammicine analogs confirmed the stringent substrate specificity of downstream stemmadenine biosynthetic enzymes. Though much lower amounts of alkaloid analogs were observed in this study compared to the 6 alkaloids identified in McCoy et al. (2006) directed biosynthesis in C. roseus seedlings and hairy roots yields a mixture of products, while the heterologous reconstitution in N. benthamiana allows us to obtain much more defined profiles of fluorinated and chlorinated alstonine analogs, with no contaminating \u201cnatural\u201d alkaloid. Notably, we obtained lower amounts of natural alstonine compared to its analogs. The reason for this surprising result is not known, but we hypothesize that natural strictosidine could be more readily transported to other parts of the plant compared to the strictosidine analogs, which would decrease the availability of substrate for conversion to alstonine.\nFurther studies are required to improve the yields of alkaloid analogs using this system. This is a challenging system in that a number of unstable biosynthetic intermediates (e.g., strictosidine aglycone) comprise this pathway. We envision that engineering the biosynthetic enzymes may improve turnover of the halogenated, methylated and methoxylated substrates. Additionally, optimization of the protein production levels of these complex pathways may also improve the yields of the downstream products. Finally, changing the localization of these enzymes may also improve titers. Nevertheless, with this study we clearly demonstrate that N. benthamiana can be used as a platform to produce new-to-nature compounds by combining heterologous transient gene expression with infiltration of an unnatural precursor."
