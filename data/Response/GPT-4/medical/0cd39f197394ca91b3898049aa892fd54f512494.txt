Multicenter, Large-Scale Studies on ATIII Levels and VTE Incidence Across Diverse Surgical Subsets: To overcome the limitations related to sample size and diversity, future studies should aim to include a larger and more varied patient population from multiple centers. This approach would allow for a more detailed subgroup analysis, potentially highlighting differences in VTE risk associated with ATIII levels across different types of surgery and patient demographics.

Longitudinal Studies to Track ATIII Levels Over Time in Critically Ill Patients: Investigate how ATIII levels change over time in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. This could involve measuring ATIII levels at multiple points during a patient's stay in the SICU to understand how these levels fluctuate and how they correlate with VTE development, recovery outcomes, and mortality. Such studies could also explore how interventions, such as VTE prophylaxis or transfusions, impact ATIII levels.

Evaluation of VTE Prophylaxis Strategies Tailored to ATIII Levels: Given the association between low ATIII levels and increased VTE risk, there's a need for research into the effectiveness of tailored VTE prophylaxis strategies. This could include studies comparing standard prophylaxis protocols with those adjusted based on ATIII levels, potentially leading to more personalized and effective approaches to VTE prevention in the SICU setting.

Investigating the Impact of Obesity and Age on ATIII Levels and VTE Risk: The study highlighted obesity and older age as factors associated with ATIII levels and VTE risk. Future research could focus on these populations to better understand the mechanisms at play and develop targeted strategies for VTE prevention. This could include exploring the metabolic and physiological changes in obese patients and the elderly that affect ATIII levels and how these changes influence the risk of thrombosis.

Exploring the Role of ATIII Supplementation in VTE Prevention: Based on the complex relationship between ATIII levels and VTE incidence, especially in trauma patients, investigating the potential of ATIII supplementation as a preventive measure could be valuable. Clinical trials could assess whether boosting ATIII levels in patients with identified deficiencies or in those at high risk for VTE can effectively reduce the incidence of thrombotic events. This research could also consider the timing, dosage, and method of supplementation to optimize patient outcomes.
