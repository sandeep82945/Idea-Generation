    "abstractText": "Autophagy is important for the removal, degradation and recycling of damaged organelles, proteins, and lipids through the degradative action of lysosomes. In addition to its catabolic function, autophagy is important in cancer and viral-mediated tumorigenesis, including Human Papillomavirus (HPV) positive cancers. HPV infection is a major risk factor in a subset of head and neck cancer (HNC), for which no targeted therapies are currently available. Herein, we assessed autophagy function in HPV-positive HNC. We showed that HPV-positive HNC cells presented a transcriptional and functional impairment of the autophagic process compared to HPV-negative cells, which were reactivated by knocking down HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins, the drivers of cellular transformation. We found that the oncoprotein c-MYC was stabilized and triggered in HPV-positive cell lines. This resulted in the reduced binding of the MiT/TFE transcription factors to their autophagy targets due to c-MYC competition. Thus, the knock-down of c-MYC induced the upregulation of autophagic and lysosomal genes in HPV-positive HNC cells, as well as the increase of autophagic markers at the protein level. Moreover, HPV oncoprotein E7 upregulated the expression of the phosphatase inhibitor CIP2A, accounting for c-MYC upregulation and stability in HPV+ HNC cells. CIP2A mRNA expression negatively correlated with autophagy gene expression in tumor tissues from HNC patients, showing, for the first time, its implication in a transcriptional autophagic context. Both CIP2A and c-MYC knock-down, as well as pharmacological downregulation of c-MYC, resulted in increased resistance to cisplatin treatment. Our results not only show a novel way by which HPV oncoproteins manipulate the host machinery but also provide more insights into the role of autophagy in chemoresistance, with possible implications for targeted HPV-positive HNC therapy.",

In addition to its catabolic function, autophagy is important in cancer and viral-mediated tumorigenesis, including Human Papillomavirus (HPV) positive cancers. HPV infection is a major risk factor in a subset of head and neck cancer (HNC), for which no targeted therapies are currently available. Herein, we assessed autophagy function in HPV-positive HNC. We showed that HPV-positive HNC cells presented a transcriptional and functional impairment of the autophagic process compared to HPV-negative cells, which were reactivated by knocking down HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins, the drivers of cellular transformation. We found that the oncoprotein c-MYC was stabilized and triggered in HPV-positive cell lines. This resulted in the reduced binding of the MiT/TFE transcription factors to their autophagy targets due to c-MYC competition. Thus, the knock-down of c-MYC induced the upregulation of autophagic and lysosomal genes in HPV-positive HNC cells, as well as the increase of autophagic markers at the protein level. Moreover, HPV oncoprotein E7 upregulated the expression of the phosphatase inhibitor CIP2A, accounting for c-MYC upregulation and stability in HPV+ HNC cells. CIP2A mRNA expression negatively correlated with autophagy gene expression in tumor tissues from HNC patients, showing, for the first time, its implication in a transcriptional autophagic context. Both CIP2A and c-MYC knock-down, as well as pharmacological downregulation of c-MYC, resulted in increased resistance to cisplatin treatment. Our results not only show a novel way by which HPV oncoproteins manipulate the host machinery but also provide more insights into the role of autophagy in chemoresistance, with possible implications for targeted HPV-positive HNC therapy.\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:719 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-06248-3"

            "text": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) comprises tumors originating in the epithelial cells of the mucosa of the upper aerial tract, including the oropharynx, the oral cavity, the larynx and the hypopharynx [1]. Based on its main risk factors, alcohol/tobacco consumption and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections, HNC can be subdivided into two subgroups: HPV-negative (HPV\u2212) and HPVpositive (HPV+) [2]. HPV-related HNC mostly occurs in the oropharyngeal subsite and has been increasing in the last decades, especially in men [3]. Indeed, HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers have one of the fastest rises in incidence in non-Hispanic white men in the United States [4]. Although the two HNC subtypes are different in both clinical and molecular aspects, they are still treated with the same therapies, including surgery, when possible, followed by radio- and chemotherapy [5]. A better knowledge of the molecular aspects that distinguish these two subgroups would be beneficial for the discovery of novel targets and biomarkers for targeted therapy.\nHPV is a sexually transmitted double-strand DNA virus of approximately 8000 bp [6]. Over 200 HPV strains exist, subdivided into high-risk or low-risk for the capability to induce carcinogenesis [7]. The main drivers of oncogenesis are the E6 and E7 oncoproteins: E6 interacts with many cellular proteins, including p53, which, upon interaction with the human ubiquitin-ligase E6AP, is sent to proteasomal degradation, leading to inhibition of apoptosis [8]. E7 mainly induces retinoblastoma protein (pRb) inactivation, leading to E2F1 release, an important transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation, resulting in increased proliferation [9, 10]. Another target gene activated by E2F1 is the Cellular Inhibitor of PP2A (Protein Phosphatase 2A) (CIP2A) [11, 12]. CIP2A sequesters PP2A B56 regulatory subunit inhibiting its activity and, as a consequence, increases the half-life of the oncogene c-MYC by inhibiting its S62 dephosphorylation by PP2A [13]. Autophagy is a self-consumption intracellular process important for catabolism and homeostasis [14].

LC3 is extensively used to monitor the autophagic flux [18]. The autophagosome, containing a cargo of proteins and damaged organelles, is degraded upon fusion with lysosomes, degradative organelles consisting of digestive enzymes and an acidic environment [19]. Autophagy is important for the recycling of amino acids, the degradation of long-lived proteins, and the recycling of damaged organelles, including mitochondria [20]. Autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis can be transcriptionally regulated by different transcription factors, in particular, the microphthalmia/transcription factor E (MiT/TFE) family [21, 22]. This family includes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), transcription factor E3 (TFE3), transcription factor EB (TFEB) and transcription factor EC (TFEC) proteins, belonging to the larger family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) transcription factors (that also include c-MYC), that can recognize a specific motif (GTCACGTGAC) known as the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) [22]. Specifically, TFEB and TFE3 activities are controlled by phosphorylation: mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition dephosphorylates TFEB/TFE3 inducing their nuclearization and activation, leading to the activation of lysosome/autophagy gene expression [23]. The role of autophagy in cancer is still not well understood. Many works suggest that autophagy inhibition drives tumorigenesis [24\u201326]; however, other studies suggest that autophagy induction can ensure cancer cell survival in advanced solid tumors [27, 28]. Autophagy is considered a double-edged sword in cancer [29]. The role of HPV in autophagy regulation is emerging, and in particular, E6 and E7 oncoproteins impinge this pathway at different steps [30]. E6 has been shown to inhibit late steps of autophagy in primary keratinocytes [31], while E7 has been observed to inhibit autophagy by AMBRA1 degradation [32]. In this study, we focused on autophagy gene expression regulation mediated by E6/E7 in HNC and how c-MYC affects this process. We also tested the implication of PP2A activation or c-MYC downregulation in combination with cisplatin in HPV+ HNC to assess their role in chemosensitivity."

            "text": "Autophagy is structurally and functionally impaired in HPV+ HNC cell lines To assess the differences in autophagy activation between HPV+ and HPV\u2212 HNC cells, we examined the number of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) (which include autophagosomes, autolysosomes and amphisomes) by electron microscopy (EM) in 2 HPV\u2212 and 2 HPV+ HNC cell lines (Fig. 1A). HPV+ HNC cell lines showed a reduced number and size of AVs compared to HPV\u2212 ones, suggesting a possible inhibition of the pathway (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1A). We then assessed the levels of autophagy markers in HNC cell lines at basal conditions. HPV+ HNC cell lines showed lower levels of the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II) compared to HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines (Fig. 1C, D), while other autophagy markers like Beclin or p62 were only respectively slightly or not affected (Supplementary Fig. S1B, C). We also measured the activation of Akt and mTORC, described to inhibit autophagy [33], by detecting Akt and p70 S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation by western blot in HNC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1D, E). While Akt phosphorylation at S473 seems not to be related to HPV status, p70 (S6K) phosphorylation can be detected in the UD-SCC-2 and UPCI-SCC-90 HPV+ HNC cell lines, suggesting that mTORC activity could promote autophagy inhibition in some HPV+ HNC cell lines.\nTo functionally characterize autophagy status, we monitored the autophagic flux by using a tandem tagged LC3-GFP-RFP fusion protein [34]. GFP is quenched in acidic pH such that only red dots can be observed in functional autolysosomes, while in neutral pH red and green colocalized dots can be detected. The HPV\u2212 UMSCC-19 and the HPV+ UD-SCC-2 HNC cell lines transduced with the lentiviral LC3-GFP-RFP vector were treated with the late-stage autophagic inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, the mTORC1 inhibitor Torin1, or the vehicle (DMSO) and observed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1E). Quantification of colocalized GFP and RFP dots showed a significant increase upon autophagy inhibition and a significant decrease upon autophagy activation with respect to the vehicle only in the HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines, as expected in cells in which autophagy is functional (Fig. 1F, left). However, the levels of colocalized dots in the HPV+ HNC cell lines do not vary significantly with respect to the vehicle, upon pharmacological induction or inhibition of autophagy (Fig. 1F, right). Taken together, these results suggest a global impairment in autophagic functions in HPV+ HNC cell lines.\nHPV16 oncoproteins transcriptionally inhibit autophagy gene expression To test whether HPV16 oncoproteins are involved in autophagy inhibition in HPV+ HNC cells, we knocked down E6/E7 by RNAi in UD-SCC-2 cells. We then stained Lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) (lysosomal) and LC3 (autophagosomal) proteins, revealing an increase in colocalization upon reduction of E6/E7, suggesting a reactivation of the pathway (Fig. 2A, B). This result was confirmed also by a significant increase in the LC3II/ LC3I ratio upon siE6/E7 (Fig. 2C, D). Interestingly, the downregulation of E6 and E7 was able to induce the mRNA upregulation of some autophagic and lysosomal genes (Fig. 2E). To investigate the role of E6 and E7 in mRNA regulation of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, we transduced primary human keratinocytes (PHK) with HPV16 E6 and E7 (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. S2A), followed by RNA sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S2D, E). Gene ontology analysis on genes downregulated by E6/E7 indicated genes belonging to lysosomal and vacuolar cellular compartments as some of the most relevant genes affected by the two oncoproteins (Fig. 2G), in addition, the pathway analysis highlighted lysosome and autophagy pathway among the top regulated hits (Fig. 2H). Moreover, HPV16 E6 and E7 alone, seem to induce mRNA downregulation of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S2E\u2013G). These results were also confirmed by qPCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2B, C). Next, we wanted to confirm these results also in HNC cell lines by monitoring the mRNA expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes in two HPV\u2212 (UM-SCC-4, UM-SCC-19) and two HPV+ (UDSCC-2, UPCI-SCC-152) HNC cell lines at basal conditions. Figure 2I shows that many autophagy (the LC3 gene MAP1LC3B, the p62 gene SQSTM1, BECN1, GABARAP, GABARAPL1) and, more strongly, lysosomal (NEU1, CTSA, CTSB, CTSD, ATP6V0E1, LAMP1, LAMP2) genes are differentially expressed between HPV\u2212 and HPV+ cell lines. These data suggest that HPV16 oncoproteins transcriptionally downregulate autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis.\nc-MYC competes with TFEB and TFE3 for the binding to autophagy and lysosomal genes in HPV+ HNC cells As transcriptional repression of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis occurred in HPV+ cells, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this process. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A\u2013C, Fig. 3A) of the most important transcription factors involved in lysosomal biogenesis: TFEB and TFE3, as well as c-MYC, recently found to repress autophagy [35]. Western blots performed on HNC cell lines did not show any significant difference in the expression of these genes between HPV\u2212 and HPV+ cell lines (Fig. 3A).\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:719\nThus, we focused on the differential activation of the transcription factors, and on their binding to the promoters of autophagy genes. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of TFEB, TFE3, and c-MYC in the UM-SCC-4 and UD-SCC-2 cell lines, followed by qPCR analysis, using primers targeting the promoters of autophagy and lysosomal genes in a region\ncontaining the TFs consensus motif (see supplementary information section). We found that the binding of c-MYC to the promoter of LC3 gene (MAP1LC3B) and MCOLN1 were significantly higher in the HPV+ cell line (UD-SCC-2) compared to the HPV\u2212 cell line (UM-SCC-4), and this corresponded to a significant decrease in the binding of TFEB and TFE3 to the same promoter (Fig. 3B). The\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:719\nsame result was partially confirmed also for GLA and ATP6V1H promoters (Supplementary Fig. S3D), while no significant differences could be appreciated for the promoter of the p62 gene (SQSTM1) (Supplementary Fig. S3D). These observations are in line with Annunziata et al. [35] study, which showed that c-MYC competes with TFE3 and TFEB, repressing lysosomal and autophagic transcription. To confirm the competition in HPV + HNC cells, we knocked down c-MYC and performed ChIP of TFEB in UD-SCC-2 cells. The reduction of c-MYC strikingly increased the binding of TFEB to the promoter of different autophagy and lysosomal genes (Fig. 3C, D, Supplementary Fig. S3E\u2013G). Our data suggest that HPV+ HNC cells present a more active c-MYC protein compared to HPV\u2212 cells, which prevents the binding of TFEB and TFE3 to autophagy and lysosomal promoters.\nc-MYC stability increases in HPV+HNC cells, affecting the autophagy pathway To assess whether c-MYC is involved in the inhibition of autophagy, we performed c-MYC knock-down in HPV+ HNC cell lines. c-MYC downregulation affected both protein expression of LC3 and the mRNA levels of different autophagy genes (Fig. 4A, B, Supplementary Fig. S4A, B, D). Moreover, c-MYC overexpression in UD-SCC-2 and UPCI-SCC-152 cell lines reduced LC3-II/LC3-I protein ratio and induced the downregulation of autophagy genes, confirming the involvement of c-MYC in autophagy repression (Fig. 4C,D, Supplementary Fig. S4C). Since no significant difference in the mRNA expression of MYC between HPV+ and HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines was detected (Supplementary Fig. S3C), we evaluated the stability of c-MYC protein by treating HNC cell lines with cycloheximide (CHX), a widely used inhibitor of protein synthesis, at different time points. Since c-MYC is very unstable, we used 5min as the first time point and 90min as the last. Western blot analysis revealed a higher stability of c-MYC in HPV + with respect to HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines (Fig. 4E, Supplementary Fig. S4E, F). We calculated the half-life of c-MYC in 3 HPV\u2212 and 3 HPV +HNC cell lines (Fig. 4F) and we observed a significantly higher halflife in the HPV+HNC cell lines, revealing a higher stability of c-MYC in these cell lines (Fig. 4G). Since c-MYC stability is affected by its phosphorylation, we tried to assess whether the phosphatase inhibitor CIP2A was responsible for c-MYC stabilization in the UD-SCC-2 cell line. Silencing of CIP2A by shRNA induced a strong downregulation of c-MYC protein levels (Fig. 4H), which was specifically imputable to the reduction of c-MYC half-life (Fig. 4I). These results confirmed our hypothesis that, also in our system, c-MYC is regulated by CIP2A expression.\nCIP2A inhibits autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis in HNC As CIP2A affected c-MYC stability, we investigated the role of CIP2A mRNA expression in HNC tumors. We took advantage of the Pancancer Dataset of Head and Neck cancer tumors from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and assessed the correlation between CIP2A mRNA and autophagy or lysosomal gene expression. We found that many genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis\ninversely correlated with CIP2A expression (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S5A\u2013C). We then took the top 100 genes that inversely correlated with CIP2A expression and performed a gene ontology analysis, looking at cellular components, biological processes and pathways enriched (Fig. 5B\u2013D). As shown in Fig. 5B\u2013D, among the most enriched hits we found lysosome-related genes, macroautophagy, mitophagy and selective autophagy. We then decided to assess whether CIP2A expression affects autophagy in HPV+ HNC cell lines. Upon CIP2A silencing in HPV + HNC cell lines we showed the upregulation of LC3-II (Fig. 5E, F), and also an increased MAP1LC3B gene expression (Fig. 5G). Moreover, the overexpression of CIP2A reduced the colocalization of LC3 with LAMP2 (Fig. 5H, I). Taken together these results evidence a novel and important role of CIP2A expression in autophagy gene expression in HNC.\nHPV16 E6/E7 induce CIP2A overexpression in HNC After demonstrating the importance of CIP2A in c-MYC stability and autophagy in HNC, we evaluated the expression of CIP2A in HPV+ vs HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines. Upon assessing the mRNA expression of CIP2A in the Pancancer dataset, we observed significantly higher expression levels in HPV+ compared to HPV\u2212 HNC samples. (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the same result was confirmed also in primary tumors obtained from IEO hospital (Fig. 6B, S6B), and in HNC cell lines (Fig. 6C). We then evaluated the possible regulation of HPV16 E6/E7 on CIP2A expression, by transducing PHK with E6/E7 (Fig. 6D). Western blot analysis showed the upregulation of CIP2A in the presence of E6 and E7 proteins, confirmed by higher mRNA levels of CIP2A (Supplementary Fig. S6D). To strengthen our observations, we checked CIP2A protein levels in HPV+ and HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines, confirming significant higher levels of CIP2A in the HPV+ subgroup (Fig. 6E, F), and that this upregulation can be significantly reverted upon knock-down of E6/E7 (Fig. 6G, H). These results are in line with published literature showing overexpression of CIP2A by high-risk HPV due to E7 inhibition of pRb in other systems [36\u201338]. Along the same line, we also observed the overexpression of E2F1 (regulated by pRb) both in TCGA cases and in HNC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S6A, C). Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed on RNAseq data from PHK transduced with E6/E7 showed significant enrichment in E2F1 pathways and E2F targets, as well as MYC upregulation, as expected (S6E, S6F, S6G). The same analysis did not show any significant enrichment in mTORC signaling (Supplementary Fig. S6H, I). All these data suggest that HPV indirectly controls CIP2A expression activating E2F1 signaling upon pRb inhibition.\nCIP2A and c-MYC downregulation confer resistance to cisplatin in HPV+ HNC cell lines Autophagy has a fundamental role in resistance to chemotherapy [39\u201341]. Recent findings suggest that inhibition of autophagy sensitizes cells to cisplatin treatment [42, 43]. It has been\nFig. 1 Structural and functional characterization of autophagy in HNC cell lines.

To understand the role of c-MYC and CIP2A inhibition in chemosensitivity, we evaluated cisplatin IC50 in the HPV+ UD-SCC-2 cell line upon knock-down of c-MYC or CIP2A. Figure 7A, B shows that the downregulation of either c-MYC or\nCIP2A induced resistance to cisplatin, with almost a doubling of the IC50 values in UD-SCC-2 cells. To confirm these results, we downregulated c-MYC pharmacologically, by treating both HPV+ (UD-SCC-2 and UPCI-SCC-152) and HPV\u2212 (UM-SCC-4 and UM-SCC-19) cells with the Brd4\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:719\ninhibitor JQ-1, already known to activate autophagy [45, 46]. We also tested the effects of the PP2A activator DT-061 [47]. JQ-1 induced transcriptional downregulation of MYC levels in HPV+ HNC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7A, B). To assess the effects of JQ1 and DT-061 on autophagy, we performed multiple assays, including monitoring of LC3-II/LC3-I levels by Western Blot (Supplementary Fig. S7C\u2013E) and LC3-GFP-RFP colocalization (Supplementary Fig. S7F\u2013H). Both treatments were able to induce autophagy in HPV+ HNC cell lines tested and in the UM-SCC-4 HPV\u2212 cell line. No significant changes could be detected in the HPV\u2212 UM-SCC-19 cells, probably due to low levels of c-MYC (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this cell line only partially relies on c-MYC for its autophagy gene regulation. We then assessed the IC50 of cisplatin in the presence of 1 \u00b5M JQ-1, 1 \u00b5M DT-061 or vehicle (DMSO). HPV+ HNC cell lines UDSCC-2 and UPCI-SCC-152 treated with JQ-1 or DT-061 showed an increased resistance to cisplatin in comparison to the control (Fig.\n7C\u2013F). Interestingly, no effects on cisplatin sensitivity could be detected in HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7I, J). Taken together these results suggest the importance of c-MYC activity and autophagy in chemosensitivity, selectively in HPV+ HNC and not in the HPV\u2212 HNC subtype."

Specifically, we were able to understand that both HPV16 E6 or E7 oncoprotein alone were sufficient to repress the transcription of autophagy and lysosomal genes.

In this study, we showed a higher activity of c-MYC, confirmed by a higher binding to autophagy gene promoters, that prevented TFEB and TFE3 activity in HPV+ HNC cell lines. The concept of c-MYC preventing TFE3 and TFEB from binding to autophagy and lysosomal genes was previously shown by Annunziata et al., and shed light on how c-MYC can inhibit transcription of autophagy\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:719\nFig. 5 CIP2A expression affects autophagy in HNC.

This is also in line with some findings in which the promotion of c-MYC dephosphorylation and degradation upregulates autophagy levels [52]. We showed that c-MYC half-life is significantly different in HPV+ HNC cell lines compared to HPV\u2212 ones. However, we could not detect a variation in c-MYC half-life upon knock-down of E6/E7, suggesting that c-MYC stability is not directly regulated by the two oncoproteins. As described above, CIP2A inhibits the effects of PP2A on S62 of c-MYC, important for c-MYC stability and phosphorylation [13]. Here we showed how CIP2A is important in c-MYC stabilization in HPV+ HNC, and its involvement in autophagy inhibition. CIP2A is known to regulate autophagy [53]; however, upon interrogating the TCGA, we assessed for the first time a negative correlation between its expression and autophagy/lysosomal gene expression in HNC patients. Puustinen et al. described that CIP2A inhibits autophagy in a mTORC-dependent manner [54]; however, our results on mTORC involvement are not consistent. Moreover, mTORC inhibition by Torin-1 did not induce a reduction in LC3 colocalized dots, and RNA-seq on PHK did not show any significant enrichment in the mTORC pathway. More studies are needed to better clarify the contribution of this pathway in a CIP2A overexpressed environment. We demonstrated that the oncoviral proteins E6/E7 upregulated CIP2A mRNA and protein levels in HNC cells and in PHK, in line with Zhang et al. [37]. CIP2A, overexpressed in HPV+ HNC cell lines, in HPV+ cases from the TCGA, and also in primary tumors from HNC patients, could be used as a potential marker for HPV+ tumors. CIP2A upregulation was probably due to E2F1 overactivation, which we also showed in different systems\n(Supplementary Fig. S6A, C, F, G). E7, mediating pRb impairment, induces the upregulation of E2F1, a known regulator of CIP2A [36\u201338]. In addition to c-MYC, the other main targets of CIP2A include E2F1, involved in a feedback loop activated by pRb deregulation [38], and Akt. It is worth noting that Akt is not differentially phosphorylated or expressed in HPV+ with respect to HPV\u2212 HNC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1D), supporting the idea that CIP2A impacts autophagy increasing the activity of c-MYC. However, it would be interesting to conduct further studies aimed at investigating the role of Akt and E2F1 in transcriptional modulation of autophagy in an HPV-related context. In HPV\u2212 HNC cells E2F activity is tightly regulated, CIP2A is not overexpressed and c-MYC has a short half-life. The expression of autophagy genes is controlled by TFE3 and TFEB and autophagy is functional (Fig. 8A). However, HPV+ HNC cells express high levels of CIP2A due to overactivation of E2F as a consequence of E7mediated degradation of pRb. This leads to high activity of c-MYC that binds to autophagy and lysosomal gene promoters, resulting in the inhibition of the autophagy pathway (Fig. 8B). The relevance of these findings was extended to resistance to chemotherapy. As mentioned above, HPV+ HNC cell lines are known to be more sensitive to cisplatin [44]. The notion that autophagy could be important for resistance to chemotherapy [32, 55] was confirmed in this study, in which we showed that downregulation of c-MYC, responsible for autophagy inhibition, resulted in increased resistance to cisplatin. Specifically, both the activation of PP2A using DT-061 and the transcriptional inhibition of c-MYC by JQ-1 successfully modulated autophagy and cisplatin sensitivity. More interestingly, while c-MYC inhibition exerted an effect on cisplatin\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:719\nsensitivity in HPV+ HNC cells, this was not true for HPV\u2212 ones, conferring selectivity of the HNC subtype. The link between HPV, c-MYC and autophagy could give rise to novel approaches to treat HNC patients. Moreover, these results\ncould pave the way to explore how autophagy can be manipulated, to propose more tailored and effective treatments to patients, reducing side effects and toxicity due to high doses of chemotherapy, which are often detrimental for patients.\nFig. 7 c-MYC downregulation induces cisplatin resistance in HPV+ HNC cells.
