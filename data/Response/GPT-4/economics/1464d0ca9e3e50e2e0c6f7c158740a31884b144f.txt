Cross-cultural Comparison of Agritourism Performance: Given the focus on family micro-businesses in a specific developing country, future research could expand to a cross-cultural analysis. Comparing the dynamics of agritourism performance across different cultural and economic contexts can reveal how local customs, business practices, and societal values influence agritourism's success. This comparative approach would provide a broader understanding of the factors that contribute to or hinder agritourism development globally.

Longitudinal Study on the Evolution of Agritourism: A longitudinal study tracking the same rural communities and family micro-businesses over time would offer insights into how agritourism evolves. This research could examine the long-term impacts of agritourism on local economies, social structures, and environmental sustainability. It would also allow for the observation of how the interactions between residents and micro-businesses develop and how these relationships impact agritourism performance over time.

Technological Advancements and Agritourism: Exploring the role of technology in enhancing agritourism performance presents a modern research avenue. This could include the use of social media for marketing, online booking systems for farm stays, and virtual reality experiences for remote tourists. The study could evaluate how technological adoption by family micro-businesses affects their resources, resident interactions, and overall agritourism support.

Impact of Policy Changes on Agritourism: Investigating how local, national, and international policy changes impact agritourism performance could yield valuable insights for policymakers and business owners. This research could examine the effects of agricultural subsidies, tourism incentives, and environmental regulations on the development and sustainability of agritourism. It would contribute to a deeper understanding of the policy levers that can foster or impede agritourism growth.

The Role of Environmental Sustainability in Agritourism: Considering the growing concern for environmental preservation, future research could focus on the integration of sustainable practices in agritourism. This study could assess how sustainable farming practices, eco-friendly accommodations, and conservation efforts influence agritourism performance. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how the perception of environmental stewardship affects resident support and tourist attraction to agritourism ventures.
