    "abstractText": "In high dose per pulse charged particle beams, all online detectors saturate due to ion recombination. It is therefore impossible to count detector pulses separately. Silicon carbide due to its high band gap, high thermal conductivity and high displacement energy, is seen as an alternative. Analyzing waveforms in real time is challenging in terms of bandwidth, measurable energy range, sensor size, data rate. In this contexte, an Analog Front-End (AFE) was designed for radiation signal processing. It is based on a TransImpedance Amplifier (TIA) and Charge Sentitive Amplifier (CSA) to analyze the shape of generated signal. The methodology used to characterize AFE for high detector capacitance is described. The results extracted from simulations, experimental and measurements in radiative environment are also presented.",

INTRODUCTION\nNOwadays, SIlicon Carbide (SiC) is among the semi-conductors used as sensors in radiation detection [1], [2]. The various researches on the silicon carbide pixilation thanks to the reduction and the integration capacity of the reading electronics has allowed to improve its competitive position compared to photomultipliers, ionization chambers and film dosimetry. On the other hand, its carbonaceous nature (Z = 6) makes it a good \u201dtissue equivalent\u201d and it has a very short response time thank to its high carrier saturation velocity [3]. Today, in harsh environment applications, the sensors suffer from fragility at high dose of irradiation owing to their low thermal conductivity, breakdown electrical fields and threshold displacement energy [4], [5]. In semiconductor, charged particle lose its energy by creating a pairs of electrons holes [6], [7], [8]. After being generated by the sensor, the signal must be conditioned. Most of the existing conditioning [9] chains are based on CSA (charge sensitive amplifier) or PAI (current preamplifier) in order to detect current created by the crossing of an ionizing particle through the sensor (Fig.1). In this context current preamplifier and charge sensitive amplifier have been studied [10], [11]. First of all when the particle flow becomes sufficiently high in terms of flux and energy (up to 107 n.cm\u22122.s\u22121), the current generated by the sensor is composed in two parts: one continuous part and another part with variations around this continuous value. With such\npulse, a reading amplifier with a fast response and fast fall time (tr<150ns and tf<150ns) time is required. Then PAI should be used. On the other hand, when the particle flow is not high in terms of flux and energy (\u03c6 < 106 n.cm\u22122.s\u22121), the current generated by the sensor has low value in terms of amplitude and time (\u2248 nA and \u2248 ns respectively) [12]. Then CSA should be used.\nThe aim of this work is to study SiC based radiation detector response thanks to AFE. For that, the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the used methodology, and section III, the system study. In section IV we will present material, test method and measurement results. Section V is devoted to discussion and conclusion."

In TIA mode, the output presents derivatives of the output signal due to the presence of the detector capacitance [13]. Its derivatives can be attenuated by feedback capacitance thus allowing to move the poles of the transfer function. Then process of recovering the waveform of the signal coming from the detector will be in a frequency range (zero phase) for input impedance. In the case of CSA (Charge Sensitive Amplifier) structure, the charge\n2\ncollection process can be incomplete due to the reduced value of OP-Amp DC gain and also the bandwidth of this one. In other word, these limitations will have the effect of attenuating the electronic output signal. The PAI/CSA structures are built around a low noise amplifier, accepting the input signal in form of a current/charge from a high impedance signal source, as a photodiode or a semiconductor based detector for radiation particles [14]. This amplifier converts signal into an output voltage. Generally, this structure is not advisable if the sensor device has a large capacitance (>200pF), and if fast rise time is required [15]."

Thus, both intrinsic properties of the semiconductor and the device architecture play a critical role for stability. In semiconductor materials, harsh environment leads to a decrease in the energy band gap and an increase in carrier concentration, which in turn adversely affects the sensor performance [16]. Materials with high bandgap and low intrinsic carrier concentration are needed for harsh environment applications see Tab.I. SiC possesses a higher energy bandgap compared to the more widely used Si and GaAs materials.\nThe comparative evolution of intrinsic carrier concentration of Si and SiC with temperature is presented in Fig.3. For operation in semiconductor device, the intrinsic carrier density should be well below the intentional dopant induced carrier density [17]. For instance, the intrinsic carrier density of Si is 1010cm\u22123 and well below the typical dopant induced carrier densities. For 4H-SiC, the intrinsic carrier density is 10\u221210cm\u22123. The correlation of intrinsic concentration (ni) and temperature is given by:\nni = [Nc.Nv] 1/2.exp[ \u2212Eg(T ) 2KT ] (1)\nAs shown in Fig.3, the intrinsic carrier concentration of SiC stays well below allowable limits even at 700K, allowing operation of SiC sensor at extremely harsh environment without suffering from intrinsic conduction effects and presenting low dark current. Drift region widths and breakdown voltages of Si, GaAs, 4H-SiC, and 6H-SiC are shown in TABLE II."

The PAI/CSA used in large numbers of front-end for radiation detector is a key block [22], since it sets the limits to the performance of the whole system and it must satisfy conflicting requirements such as low noise, low power, and wideband operation.

Owing to the presence of these capacitance (Cf ), and because of the\namplifier\u2019s own limitations, the system response at high frequencies will be reduced and then decrease the rising time [24].\n1) Transimpedance analysis: Amplifier\u2019s (OA)voltage gain is modeled in Laplace space as:\nA(s) = A0\n1 + s\u03c4a (3)\nWhere A0 is the low-frequency gain of the OA.

System stability analysis (see Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) [25] shows that when capacitor Cf has a small value (Cf=0pF), the slope of the feedback gain transfer function (20dB / decade) has an opposite value to the OP-Amp gain transfer function (-20dB / decade). Then the system is unstable. An analysis on the phase margin (Fig. 9) shows that it is equal to (\u03c8A = 3\u25e6 < 45\u25e6) (see point A on the curve ). To eliminate this instability, Cf value can be increased. Fig. 8 & Fig. 9 repectively show that with Cf=250pF, the slope of the feedback gain transfer function is different to (20dB / decade) and phase margin \u03c8B = 74\u25e6 (see point B). For Cf= 500pF phase margin \u03c8C = 69\u25e6 (see point C) then the system is stable in these case [26].

            "text": "In beams of higher intensity, it is impossible to count the pulses separately. The reasons are multiple but in this work we focused on two main causes. first of all in beams of higher intensity, all online detector (ion-chambers, silicon diodes, GaAs) saturates (ions collection efficiency decrease).\nSecondly, the response time of the front-end can also be the cause.\nSo, Silicon carbide detector with high capacitance (270pf) has been developped by the laboratory for harsh environment applications. With this electronic we have recovered signal detector emitted with low rise time (< 200ns)in PAI mode for high detector capacitance and also in CSA mode. As we have shown in the previous sections, we have succeeded to count separately the pulses. The rest of the work will consist to connect this Front-End to a processing system. In the near future, we will develop a high speed front end to reduce rise time below 30ns and next design an integrated electronic circuit. This reconfigurable front-end electronic will be able to extract all useful signals(current or charge answer) from the detector having Different characteristics (high and low capacity) and resolved data (nature of the particle, spectroscopy, etc.) wil be done with on-board processor. Our system will take into account the environment of use."
