    "abstractText": "Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, a parasitic disease of great medical importance on the American continent. Trypomastigote infection\u2019s initial step in a mammalian host is vital for the parasite\u2019s life cycle. A trypomastigote\u2019s surface presents many molecules, some of which have been proposed to be involved in the infection process, including a glycoprotein family called mucin-associated surface proteins (MASPs). This work describes a 49-kDa molecule (MASP49) that belongs to this family and is expressed mainly on the surfaces of amastigotes and trypomastigotes but can be found in extracts and the membrane-enriched fractions of epimastigotes. This protein is partially GPI-anchored to the surface and has a role during the internalization process, since its blockade with specific antibodies decreases parasite entry into Vero cells by 62%. This work shows that MASP49 binds to peritoneal macrophages and rat cardiomyocytes, undergoes glycosylation via galactose N-acetylgalactosamine, and can attach to the macrophage murine C-type lectin receptor (mMGL). These results suggest that MASP49 can be considered a virulence factor in T. cruzi, and a better understanding of its role in the infection process is necessary.",

            "text": "The hemoflagellate parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis. Chagas disease is the most important parasitosis, concerning the number of affected people and related deaths on the American continent [1]. Chagas disease has two main phases: the acute phase and the chronic phase. The acute phase occurs immediately after the parasite enters a host and is characterized by the presence of the parasite in the bloodstream. Symptoms during this phase are nonspecific and include malaise, headache, and fever. The chronic phase occurs following the disappearance of the parasite from the bloodstream and can last many years without clinical manifestations. However, approximately 30% of individuals may develop symptoms and present a socalled symptomatic chronic phase. The primary pathologies developed during this stage are cardiomyopathy and, to a lesser extent, megaviscera (heart, esophagus, and colon) [1]. The metacyclic trypomastigote is the parasite stage that attaches to cells and infects a vertebrate host. Upon entering the organism, it can infect virtually any cell type [2]. The trypomastigote cell surface is covered with many proteins, including trans-sialidase and mucin family members. Some of these proteins have been proposed as ligands for host cells, although accurate data regarding receptor recognition has not been reported. Identifying\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105. https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12010105 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pathogens\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 2 of 16\nparasite surface molecules that act as ligands and participate in binding to host cells is a current area of research related to this pathogen. Although there is some knowledge about surface proteins in T. cruzi [3], new data are still emerging. A new family of surface proteins was described following the publication of the complete genome of this parasite in 2005 [4]. Because the genes of this family are located within blocks of genes that belong to the mucin and trans-sialidase families, this new family was named mucin-associated surface proteins (MASPs). A total of 1377 genes were identified, of which almost two-thirds (771) are coding genes; the remaining one-third are pseudogenes. Sequence analysis of this protein family has revealed that its N- and C-terminal regions are highly conserved and contain a signal peptide and a GPI anchorage site, suggesting localization to the cell surface [4]. A study that compared sequences between Sylvio X10/1 (lineage 1) and CL Brener (lineage VI) found fewer MASP genes in the former lineage [5]. Some works have suggested that the similarities and polymorphism found in the members of this family of proteins could allow the identification of up to seven subgroups [6]. The first proteomic data for this family indicated that MASPs might have low expression levels, given that only four proteins were identified in the trypomastigote stage and one in the epimastigote stage. It has been suggested that MASPs are expressed during the intermediate stages of the parasite, or that they may be subjected to post-translational modifications, such as different N-glycosylation [7]. Other reports about these genes showed that proteins are expressed in epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes, and that MASPs can be secreted from parasites during the early stages of amastigogenesis in vitro at pH 5.0 [8,9]. It has also been proposed that the expression profile of these proteins could change during the course of infection and that different strains could differentially express several members of this family [6]. It has also been shown that immature MASP proteins, as well as the C-terminal portion, can be contained in trypomastigote exovesicles and have immunogenic properties [10,11]. Furthermore, expression of these proteins in cell membranes is variable in the parasite population [12]. The characterization of a 52-kDa MASP secreted during a parasite\u2019s interaction with target cells has been reported [13,14]. Likewise, it has been reported that several family members are essential during the infection process of T. cruzi in vitro and in vivo [15,16]. Additionally, MASPs have immunogenic properties, and some peptides derived from these proteins have been studied as candidates for vaccines against T. cruzi and serological diagnosis [17\u201319]. In addition, two subgroups of MASP proteins could be the most immunogenic during the course of infection, at least in a murine model [6]. The present work aimed to study the presence of MASP49 in the three developmental stages of T. cruzi. Furthermore, its role in the infection process, glycosylation characteristics, binding to target cells, and interaction with a receptor in mammalian cells were evaluated. The results thereof suggest that MASP49 can be considered a virulence factor for T. cruzi."

Epimastigotes were grown at 28 \u25e6C in a liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium with 25 mg/L hemin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) at an initial concentration of 5 \u00d7 106 parasites/mL [20].

Briefly, Vero cells were cultured in 75 cm2 Corning cell culture flasks and, after 3 days of culture, were infected with 2 \u00d7 106/mL of trypomastigotes per ml of cultured cells, and each third day, the culture supernatant\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 3 of 16\nthat contained the parasites was collected and centrifuged at 700\u00d7 g for 10 min. The pellet that contained the parasites was cultured at 37 \u25e6C for two hours to obtain swimming CDtryps. Then, the medium was centrifuged to 2500\u00d7 g to obtain the parasites. As determined through microscopy, nearly 90% of the recovered parasites had trypomastigote morphologies. Amastigotes were obtained through in vitro amastigogenesis. Briefly, tissue-culture-derived CD-tryps (5 \u00d7 106) were harvested as described before, transferred to 25 cm2-cell culture flasks with 1 mL of DMEM at pH 5, and incubated at 37 \u25e6C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h [25].

Three days later, peritoneal cells were recuperated through peritoneal washing with 10 mL of cold PBS and centrifuged at 290\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u25e6C.

These were used to evaluate MASP expression at different developmental stages of T. cruzi. Rabbit serum produced against an amino-terminal peptide (\u03b1-MASP49) recognized a 49- kDa protein (MASP49) in the extracts of the three stages of both strains (Figure 1A). There was a nonspecific band, of approximately 70 kDa, that was not considered for analysis\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 7 of 16\nbecause the preimmune sera also recognized this band (Figure 1A). The 49-kDa protein was also expressed in epimastigotes from the South American Silvio TcI strain; in this case, other weak signals were observed (data not shown). Additionally, the localization of MASP49 on the Qro parasite surface was determined through indirect immunofluorescence (IFI). Differential MASP49 distribution was observed on the cell surface of the three stages studied in this work. In amastigotes, this distribution was continuous and abundant. In contrast, MASP49 on CD-tryps parasites had a differential distribution; in some parasites, it was localized in patches on the membrane. Additionally, the epimastigotes had the lowest presence of this protein on the surface (Figure 1B).\nPathogens\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0105\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nM\u00e9xico\u00a0 (https://www.biomedicas.unam.mx/wp\u2010content/pdf/intranet/reglamen\u2010 tos/codigo\u2010etico\u2010iibo.pdf?x30807).\u00a0Institutional\u00a0Commission\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Care\u00a0and\u00a0Use\u00a0of\u00a0La\u2010 boratory\u00a0Animals;\u00a0approval\u00a0code:\u00a0ID\u00a0150;\u00a0approval\u00a0date:\u00a030\u00a0of\u00a0July\u00a02021.\u00a0 3.\u00a0Results\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0MASP49\u00a0Is\u00a0Expressed\u00a0in\u00a0All\u00a0Stages\u00a0of\u00a0T.\u00a0cruzi\u00a0\nTotal\u00a0protein\u00a0extracts\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Mexican\u00a0Quer\u00e9taro\u00a0(Qro)\u00a0and\u00a0Ninoa\u00a0TcI\u00a0strains\u00a0were\u00a0 obtained\u00a0from\u00a0amastigotes,\u00a0epimastigotes,\u00a0and\u00a0cell\u2010derived\u00a0trypomastigotes\u00a0(CD\u2010tryps).\u00a0 These\u00a0were\u00a0used\u00a0 to\u00a0evaluate\u00a0MASP\u00a0expression\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0developmental\u00a0stages\u00a0of\u00a0T.\u00a0 cruzi.\u00a0Rabbit\u00a0serum\u00a0produced\u00a0against\u00a0an\u00a0amino\u2010terminal\u00a0peptide\u00a0(\u03b1\u2010MASP49)\u00a0recognized\u00a0 a\u00a049\u2010kDa\u00a0protein\u00a0(MASP49)\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0extracts\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0three\u00a0stages\u00a0of\u00a0both\u00a0strains\u00a0(Figure\u00a01A).\u00a0 There\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0nonspecific\u00a0band,\u00a0of\u00a0approximately\u00a070\u00a0kDa,\u00a0that\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0considered\u00a0for\u00a0anal\u2010 ysis\u00a0because\u00a0the\u00a0preimmune\u00a0sera\u00a0also\u00a0recognized\u00a0this\u00a0band\u00a0(Figure\u00a01A).\u00a0The\u00a049\u2010kDa\u00a0pro\u2010 tein\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0expressed\u00a0in\u00a0epimastigotes\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0South\u00a0American\u00a0Silvio\u00a0TcI\u00a0strain;\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0 case,\u00a0other\u00a0weak\u00a0signals\u00a0were\u00a0observed\u00a0(data\u00a0not\u00a0shown).\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0the\u00a0localization\u00a0of\u00a0 MASP49\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Qro\u00a0parasite\u00a0surface\u00a0was\u00a0determined\u00a0through\u00a0indirect\u00a0 immunofluores\u2010 cence\u00a0(IFI).\u00a0Differential\u00a0MASP49\u00a0distribution\u00a0was\u00a0observed\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0cell\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0three\u00a0 stages\u00a0studied\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0work.\u00a0In\u00a0amastigotes,\u00a0this\u00a0distribution\u00a0was\u00a0continuous\u00a0and\u00a0abun\u2010 dant.\u00a0In\u00a0contrast,\u00a0MASP49\u00a0on\u00a0CD\u2010tryps\u00a0pa asi es\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0differenti l\u00a0 istribution;\u00a0in\u00a0some\u00a0 parasites,\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0localized\u00a0in\u00a0patch s\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0m mbrane.\u00a0Additio ally,\u00a0the\u00a0epimastigotes\u00a0 had\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0protein\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0(Figure\u00a01B).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Expression\u00a0and\u00a0cellular\u00a0localization\u00a0of\u00a0MASP49\u00a0in\u00a0T.\u00a0cruzi\u00a0stages.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Western\u00a0blot\u00a0analysis\u00a0\nwas\u00a0 performed\u00a0 using\u00a0 rabbit\u00a0 preimmune\u00a0 serum\u00a0 (Pre)\u00a0 or\u00a0 rabbit\u00a0 serum\u00a0 \u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0 (\u03b1\u2010MASP49)\u00a0\nagainst\u00a0total\u00a0protein\u00a0extracts\u00a0from\u00a0amastigotes\u00a0(am),\u00a0epimastigotes\u00a0(epi),\u00a0and\u00a0CD\u2010tryps\u00a0(try)\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0\nQuer\u00e9taro\u00a0(Qro)\u00a0and\u00a0Ninoa\u00a0strains,\u00a0as\u00a0described\u00a0in\u00a0Materials\u00a0and\u00a0Methods.\u00a0MASP49\u00a0recognition\u00a0is\u00a0\nindicated\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0arrow.\u00a0(B)\u00a0The\u00a0surface\u00a0localization\u00a0of\u00a0MASP49\u00a0was\u00a0evaluated\u00a0through\u00a0IFI\u00a0assay\u00a0\nin\u00a0all\u00a0stages\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Qro\u00a0T.\u00a0cruzi\u00a0strain,\u00a0using\u00a0affinity\u2010purified\u00a0\u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0antibodies\u00a0and\u00a0Alexa\u00a0con\u2010\njugated\u00a0donkey\u00a0antirabbit\u00a0IgG,\u00a0as\u00a0described\u00a0 in\u00a0Materials\u00a0and\u00a0Methods.\u00a0Light\u00a0microscopy\u00a0 (upper\u00a0\npanel)\u00a0and\u00a0confocal\u00a0microscopy\u00a0(lower\u00a0panel)\u00a0are\u00a0shown.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure 1.

The reduction in infection was specific, since the rabbit IgG isotype, used as a control, did not significantly affect parasite entry. Additionally, we evaluated the number of intracellular parasites that showed a significant decrease in number of amastigotes when these parasites were treated with 300 \u00b5g/mL of \u03b1-MASP49 antibodies (p < 0.05) (Figure 2D)."

Only PNA and GNA lectins that recognized galactose (1-3), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNac), and mannose, respectively, gave positive signals with the Ninoa proteins (Figure 3B). Among them, a 49-kDa protein with the same molecular weight as the protein that was recognized by the \u03b1-MASP49 antibody was identified. Furthermore, the MASP49 was purified using chromatography and protein elution from a Tricine acrylamide gel system. The different fractions obtained from the purification process were evaluated through the SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the \u03b1-MASP49 antibodies. In some of these fractions, only a 49 kDa protein was observed (Figure 3C1). The same protein was recognized by the \u03b1-MASP49 antibodies (Figure 3C2). Furthermore, only PNA recognized the purified MASP49, confirming the presence of GalNac in the epimastigote protein (Figure 3C3). No recognition with SNA was observed using the purified MASP49, confirming our previous results with the total epimastigote extract.\nPathogens\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0105\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Figure\u00a02C).\u00a0The\u00a0reduction\u00a0in\u00a0infection\u00a0was\u00a0specific,\u00a0since\u00a0the\u00a0rabbit\u00a0IgG\u00a0isotype,\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0 a\u00a0control,\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0significantly\u00a0affect\u00a0parasite\u00a0entry.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0we\u00a0evaluated\u00a0the\u00a0num\u2010 ber\u00a0of\u00a0intracellular\u00a0parasites\u00a0that\u00a0showed\u00a0a\u00a0significant\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0amastigotes\u00a0 when\u00a0these\u00a0parasites\u00a0were\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a0300\u00a0\u03bcg/mL\u00a0of\u00a0\u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0antibodies\u00a0(p\u00a0<\u00a00.05)\u00a0(Fig\u2010 ure\u00a02D).\u00a0\n3.4.\u00a0MASP49\u00a0Binds\u00a0to\u00a0Different\u00a0Host\u00a0Cells\u00a0 A\u00a0binding\u00a0assay\u00a0was\u00a0performed\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0whether\u00a0MASP49\u00a0binds\u00a0to\u00a0surface\u00a0pro\u2010 teins\u00a0of\u00a0Vero\u00a0cells\u00a0and\u00a0primary\u2010culture\u00a0rat\u00a0cardiomyocytes,\u00a0as\u00a0described\u00a0in\u00a0Materials\u00a0and\u00a0 Methods.\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0Ninoa\u2010\u00a0and\u00a0Qro\u2010eluted\u00a0proteins\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Vero\u00a0cells,\u00a0a\u00a0band\u00a0of\u00a049\u00a0kDa,\u00a0 with\u00a0similar\u00a0intensity,\u00a0was\u00a0recognized\u00a0by\u00a0\u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0antibodies\u00a0(Figure\u00a03A).\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0rat\u00a0cardiomyocytes,\u00a0the\u00a0intensity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0recognized\u00a049\u00a0kDa\u00a0was\u00a0more\u00a0evident\u00a0when\u00a0 the\u00a0extract\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Qro\u00a0strain\u00a0was\u00a0used.\u00a0As\u00a0a\u00a0control,\u00a0an\u00a0antibody\u00a0against\u00a0T.\u00a0cruzi\u00a0proteins\u00a0 was\u00a0used.\u00a0\n3.5.\u00a0MASP49\u00a0Is\u00a0Glycosylated\u00a0with\u00a0Galactose\u00a0(1\u20103)\u00a0N\u2010acetylgalactosamine\u00a0 We\u00a0used\u00a0the\u00a0DIG\u00a0Glycan\u00a0Differentiation\u00a0Kit\u00a0to\u00a0assess\u00a0whether\u00a0MASP49\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0glycopro\u2010 tein.\u00a0Only\u00a0PNA\u00a0and\u00a0GNA\u00a0lectins\u00a0that\u00a0recognized\u00a0galactose\u00a0(1\u20103),\u00a0N\u2010acetylgalactosamine\u00a0 (GalNac),\u00a0and\u00a0mannose,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0gave\u00a0positive\u00a0signals\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0Ninoa\u00a0proteins\u00a0(Fig\u2010 ure\u00a03B).\u00a0Among\u00a0them,\u00a0a\u00a049\u2010kDa\u00a0protein\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0molecular\u00a0weight\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0protein\u00a0 that\u00a0was\u00a0rec gniz d\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0\u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0antibody\u00a0was\u00a0identified.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0the\u00a0MASP49\u00a0 was\u00a0purified\u00a0using\u00a0chromatogr phy\u00a0and\u00a0protein\u00a0 lution\u00a0 fro \u00a0a\u00a0Tricine\u00a0acrylamide\u00a0gel\u00a0 system.\u00a0The\u00a0different\u00a0 fractions\u00a0obtained\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0purification\u00a0process\u00a0were\u00a0 evaluated\u00a0 through\u00a0the\u00a0SDS\u2012PAGE\u00a0and\u00a0Western\u00a0blotting\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0\u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0antibodies.\u00a0In\u00a0some\u00a0of\u00a0 these\u00a0fractions,\u00a0only\u00a0a\u00a049\u00a0kDa\u00a0protein\u00a0was\u00a0observed\u00a0(Figure\u00a03C1).\u00a0The\u00a0same\u00a0protein\u00a0was\u00a0 recognized\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0\u03b1\u2010MASP49\u00a0antibodies\u00a0(Figure\u00a03C2).\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0only\u00a0PNA\u00a0recognized\u00a0 the\u00a0purified\u00a0MASP49,\u00a0confirming\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0GalNac\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0epimastigote\u00a0protein\u00a0(Fig\u2010 ure\u00a03C3).\u00a0No\u00a0recognition\u00a0with\u00a0SNA\u00a0was\u00a0observed\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0purified\u00a0MASP49,\u00a0confirming\u00a0 our\u00a0previous\u00a0results\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0total\u00a0epimastigote\u00a0extract.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0Binding\u00a0assay\u00a0and\u00a0MASP\u00a0glycosylation.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Fixed\u00a0Vero\u00a0cells\u00a0or\u00a0rat\u00a0cardiomyocytes\u00a0from\u00a0\nprimary\u00a0cultures\u00a0were\u00a0incubated\u00a0with\u00a0CD\u2010trys\u00a0protein\u00a0extract\u00a0from\u00a0Qro\u00a0and\u00a0Ninoa\u00a0strains,\u00a0as\u00a0de\u2010\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 10 of 16"

            "text": "Due to the confirmed presence of GalNac, the MASP49 could be recognized by carbohydrate receptors in mammalian cells. In addition, the murine receptor for C-type lectins (mMGL) is known to have an affinity for GalNac. Therefore, peritoneal macrophages from wild-type C57BL6 mice (WT) and mMGL knockout mice (KO-mMGL), which lacked the C-type lectin receptor, were used in a binding assay, as previously described. The MASP49 bound to the surface of the WT macrophages but not the KO-mMGL macrophages. As a control, an antibody directed against total T. cruzi proteins was used (Figure 4A). To establish the importance of the GalNac present in MASP49 during binding to mMGL, an inhibition assay was performed using several carbohydrates, including GalNac. The presence of galactose reduced the binding of MASP49 to mMGL in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). Interestingly, mannose and glucose also reduced MASP49\u2013mMGL binding but were less efficient, since higher carbohydrate concentrations produced less binding

Under basal conditions, MASP49 and the mMGL receptor colocalized (Figure 4C 1, 2, 3, 4). Additionally, since the expression of the mMGL receptor increased after addition of mrIL-4, this cytokine was added to macrophages from wild-type mice. When mrIL-4 was added, the mMGL receptor on the surface of the WT macrophages\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 11 of 16\nincreased. This correlated with more binding of MASP49 detected via specific antibodies (Figure 4C 5, 6, 7, 8). The colocalization of both lectin and MASP49 was confirmed when these signals were merged (Figure 4C8 and the amplification in the box). Colocalization was not observed in a similar experiment with macrophages from mMGL knockout mice in the absence (Figure 4C 9, 10, 11, 12) or presence of mrIL-4 (Figure 4C 13, 14, 15, 16)."

However, compared with the control condition, it was not statistically significant. When the mrIL-4 was added to the WT cells, the average number of infected cells increased, but this increase was not statistically significant. On the other hand, the infection percentage of KO-mMGL macrophages was lower compared with that of the WT, but it was not statistically significant. As expected, the mrIL-4 increased the number of WT macrophages infected but had no effect on the KO-mMGL cells.

            "text": "Trypomastigote surface proteins have been widely studied because of their importance in parasite biology. These proteins appear to play a role in the parasite\u2019s defense against the host\u2019s immune system and its binding and entry into host cells [3]. Several proteins have been proposed to be involved in the binding\u2013invasion process, but which surface proteins interact specifically with a host-cell receptor is poorly known. The interaction in these regions seems to be mediated in part by GPI-anchored surface proteins [37]. Almost 25% of the diploid parasites genome codes for surface proteins, including widely studied families such as trans-sialidases and mucins [38,39]. With the publication of this parasite\u2019s genome in 2005, two families of surface proteins were described for the first time: gp63, which is homologous to the gene in Leishmania sp. parasites, and a second family of proteins, called mucin-associated surface proteins (MASP). The MASP family encodes genes that correspond to nearly 6% of the complete T. cruzi genome [4]. In this work, we produced an antibody against a synthetic 13-amino acid peptide that corresponded to a conserved amino-terminal region of a MASP. Using this antibody,\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 12 of 16\nthe presence of MASP49 was detected in the protein extracts of the three developmental stages in two Mexican strains. It was localized on the parasite surface, but with differential distribution, with amastigotes showing the stronger presence, CD-tryps showing surface patches, and epimastigotes having a lower signal. This result contrasts with a previously published report that described the expression of a different 45 kDa MASP protein found only in trypomastigotes but not in epimastigotes [12]. These data suggest that there are at least two different MASPs, albeit with near molecular weights to one another. These differences may be due to differential expressions in several DTUs and to the polymorphism in this protein family, as previously proposed [12]. Furthermore, the MASP49 described in our study was associated with membraneenriched fractions in epimastigotes and partially anchored to the cell membrane with GPI, showing that MASP49 is located on the parasite surface, as was reported for other MASPs [12]. Additionally, incubation of CD-tryp with anti-MASP49 antibodies reduced the percentage of Vero-infected cells and the number of amastigotes, showing that MASP49 also participates in the binding\u2013invasion process of T. cruzi on mammalian cells, as has also been reported for other members of this family [13]. Although some immunogenic and biological properties of members of the MASP family have been evaluated, little is known about the properties that allow them to interact with mammalian cells and what molecules can act as receptors. Our results show that MASP49 can bind to molecules on the surfaces of epithelial cells and, importantly, on cardiomyocytes. The latter are the primary target cells of the T. cruzi parasite in mammals, including humans. Additionally, our data show the presence of GalNac in MASP49. Previous works have reported that epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of several strains of T. cruzi express galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues on their surface [40,41]. Furthermore, it has been reported that some surface proteins of macrophages participate in recognition of \u03b2-D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues present in trypomastigote surface proteins, which facilitates entry into cells [42,43]. The results that showed that MASP49 does not bind to surface proteins of peritoneal macrophages that lack mMGL receptors suggest that MASP49 can bind to this receptor through GalNac directly or in combination with some other protein; this last aspect must be investigated further. The colocalization study showed that the mMGL receptor is one of the possible receptors for MASP49 on the surface of macrophages, as has been demonstrated for other pathogens [36]. Furthermore, the previously reported increased expression of this receptor via mrIL-4 [44] also increased the binding of MASP49, giving additional funding to the role of the mMGL receptor as one of the sites for MASP49 binding, alone or in association with other proteins. Competition experiments that used several carbohydrates have demonstrated that this binding is diminished preferentially with D-galactose, further supporting the role of mMGL as one of the possible receptors for MASP49. Less reduction in binding of MASP49 to macrophages was observed with mannose and glucose, indicating that MASP49 may also bind to other receptors. Previous work has shown that some MASPs could be recognized by the Con A lectin, suggesting that some members of this family might be glycosylated with mannose and glucose [7]. Finally, the involvement of MASP49 in the infection process was demonstrated when the IgG anti-MASP49 significantly blocked parasite entry and reduced the number of intracellular amastigotes in the Vero cells. When macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were used for similar experiments, cells from WT mice showed higher percentages of infected macrophages than did Vero cells. Then, the cells from the WT mice were preincubated with mrIL-4 (a macrophage activator), and there was an increase in infection and intracellular amastigotes. However, the reduction after incubation with anti-MASP49 was negligible, as was the number of parasites in the cells. When these experiments were performed with macrophages from C57BL/6 KO-mMGL mice, a reduction in the percentage of infection and the number of parasites per cell was observed compared with those of the WT mice.\nPathogens 2023, 12, 105 13 of 16\nIn general, these results indicate a role for the lectin receptor in the infection phenomenon and showed that the T. cruzi parasite has different pathways to enter each type of cell. Parasite entry into different cell types shows specific invasive mechanisms into phagocytic versus nonphagocytic cells, as has been reported before [26]. These diverse mechanisms can cause the differences observed in our work between infection and inhibition of infection in Vero cells and macrophages. The results obtained in this work provide more information about a possible interaction between MASPs and host cells. Knowing that MASP49 is glycosylated with GalNac opens the possibility of looking for more receptors for this carbohydrate in cells of various tissues to better understand the role of this protein during the infection process. In cardiomyocytes, the molecule involved in binding to MASP could be a receptor for mannose, galactose, or both, since it has previously been shown that infecting cardiomyocytes with T. cruzi in the presence of mannose or galactose reduces parasite entry [45]. The results of this work, together with those published by other groups, show that MASPs could be considered virulence factors, since they play an important role in the entry of the T. cruzi parasite into a host cell. In addition, the importance of the mMGL receptor in the host\u2013parasite relationship should also be considered [46,47]. Thus, it is necessary to extend this initial characterization of MASP49 and of other MASPs to understand their participation in the infection process: in particular, their binding capacity to the mMGL receptor alone or while interacting with other parasite proteins."

Additional studies must be carried out to corroborate the possible role of this protein related to receptors on mammal cells.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.E.; data curation, I.M.; formal analysis, B.E. and M.L.M.-V.; funding acquisition, B.E.; investigation, I.M. and M.L.M.-V.; methodology, B.E., I.M., M.L.M.-V., A.G.-C. and A.V.-M.; resources, M.R.-S. and L.I.T.; supervision, B.E.; writing\u2014original draft, I.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.E. and M.R.-S.
