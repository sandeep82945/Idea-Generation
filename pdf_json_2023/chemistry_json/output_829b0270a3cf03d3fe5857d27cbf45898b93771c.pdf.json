    "abstractText": "The preparation of an electroactive matrix for the immobilization of the bioprobe shows great promise to construct the label-free biosensors. Herein, the electroactive metal-organic coordination polymer has been in-situ prepared by pre-assembly of a layer of trithiocynate (TCY) on a gold electrode (AuE) through Au-S bond, followed by repetitive soaking in Cu(NO3)2 solution and TCY solutions. Then the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the thiolated thrombin aptamers were successively assembled on the electrode surface, and thus the electrochemical electroactive aptasensing layer for thrombin was achieved. The preparation process of the biosensor was characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM), attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and electrochemical methods. Electrochemical sensing assays showed that the formation of the aptamer-thrombin complex changed the microenvironment and the electro-conductivity of the electrode interface, causing the electrochemical signal suppression of the TCY-Cu2+ polymer. Additionally, the target thrombin can be label-free analyzed. Under optimal conditions, the aptasensor can detect thrombin in the concentration range from 1.0 fM to 1.0 \u03bcM, with a detection limit of 0.26 fM. The spiked recovery assay showed that the recovery of the thrombin in human serum samples was 97.2\u2013103%, showing that the biosensor is feasible for biomolecule analysis in a complex sample.",

            "text": "Electrochemical biosensors, as one of the earliest kinds of biosensors, have been widely used in the fields of health care, the food industry, agriculture, and environmental monitoring because of their high sensitivity, easy miniaturization, and ability to detect samples in complex systems [1\u20133]. In recent years, aptamers have attracted great attention as the recognition elements in the design and construction of biosensors [4,5]. Compared with the traditional recognition element of antibodies and enzymes, the nucleic acid aptamer (NAA) has comparable or better properties for the construction of biosensors, namely, the aptasensors [6,7]. This can be attributed to the unique versatile features of the NAA. For example, the NAAs can be chemically synthesized with low cost and high precision, and can be modified by various functional groups carrying electroactivity, photoactivity, or biological/chemical affinity [8\u201311]. In addition, the NAAs have a wide range of recognition targets from ions and small molecules to macromolecules, and even the whole cells, and in theory, any target can be screened by specific aptamers through the systematic evolution of exponentially concentrated ligands (SELEX) [12\u201314]. What is more, the binding between NAAs and the target is commonly reversible, which enables the aptasensor to be reused through appropriate methods such as heating or elution with buffer [15].\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 532. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13050532 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 532 2 of 13\nFor an electrochemical aptasensor, the conversion of the bio-recognition event into readable electrochemical signals is one of the critical issues. To date, two types of signal output manners have been developed. One is based on the covalent modification of signal tags (such as ferrocene or methylene blue) at the end of the NNAs [16\u201318]. Once binding to the target, the conformation of the NAA is changed, resulting in the variation of the distance between signal tags and the basic electrode. Consequently, the electrochemical signal of the aptasensor is changed. However, this sensing method has the following shortcomings: (1) the process of signal molecular labeling is complex, tedious, and expensive; (2) the NNAs are commonly labeled by a single site at the end, which makes the signal output intensity weak, leading to the poor sensitivity of the aptasensors. Another way of the signal output of electrochemical aptasensor is based on external signal molecules, typically [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 [12,19]. When the target binds to the NAA via bioaffinity, a nonconductive complex film is formed on the electrode surface, which hinders the diffusion of [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 from the bulk solution to the electrode surface. Thus, the target can be detected by impedance and voltammetry. The process of this method is simple, but it has a high background response. At the same time, the non-specific adsorption of interfering substances on the electrode surface can also lead to impedance or voltammetric response, which is easy to cause false-positive test results. In recent years, the electrochemical label-free biosensing strategy based on the electroactive interface has attracted increasing attention [12,20,21]. For example, Gao et al. [21] developed a platinum nanoparticle (Pt NPs) decorated carbon nanocages as a signal label to construct a sandwich-type electrochemical aptasensor for thrombin detection. Pt NPs act as a hydrogen peroxide mimetic enzyme to catalyze the reduction of H2O2, resulting in a signal amplification of the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peak current. Indirect detection of different concentrations of thrombin. Our group has also proposed a sensitive electrochemical biosensing strategy based on the hybridization-induced ion-barrier effect on the electroactive sensing interface [22]. In the work, a bifunctional electrode with the nanocomposite of electroactive Prussian blue (PB) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was prepared through a two-step electrodeposition process. Upon specific hybridization of probe DNA with the target, the formed complex induced the ion-barrier effect, which blocked the diffusion of the K+ from the bulk solution to the electrode surface, and accordingly, the voltammetric signal of the PB on the electrode was suppressed. In these electroactive interface-based label-free protocols, the integrated design of the immobilization platform of the biological probe and the signal source not only avoids the labeling of the signal molecules but also greatly expands the signal output intensity as well as the analytical sensitivity because the signal molecules contact with the basic electrode directly. Herein, an electroactive metal-organic polymer-based aptasensing platform was fabricated by the repetitive assembly of trithiocyanate (TCY) and copper ion (Cu2+) on a gold electrode (AuE), and then the thrombin was applied as the target model to probe the analytical performance of the aptasensor. Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process and working principle of the aptasensor. The TCY was grafted on the gold electrode (AuE) via the Au-S bond, and then the Cu2+ and TCY were repeatedly assembled through the coordination chemistry between -SH and Cu2+. The Cu2+ endows the sensing interface with an excellent electrochemical signal by its redox couple of Cu2+/Cu+, and the TCY also provides the supporting site for the assembly of the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that are used for the immobilization of the thiolated thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA). Upon binding of TBA with the target thrombin, the non-conductive complex was formed on the electrode surface, causing a decrease in the electrochemical response of Cu2+-TCY polymer. Additionally, the thrombin was facilely monitored. This work provides a new idea to develop an electrochemical aptasensing strategy for the label-free analysis of thrombin.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 532 3 of 13Biosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13\nScheme 1.

After washing with PBS, the electrode was electrochemically scanned in 25 mM PBS by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) for sensing analysis with the potential range from \u22120.1 to 0.5 V. The electrochemical characterization on the fabrication of the aptasensor was carried out through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impendence spectra (EIS) in the mixture solution of 1.0 mM [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 (1:1) and 0.1 M KCl. The potential window in CV was between \u22120.2 and +0.6 V, and the frequency range in EIS was from 1 to 105 Hz at an applied potential of 0.210 V. To investigate the practicability of the aptasensor, recovery experiments were conducted in healthy human serum samples. Prior to the detection, the human serum was diluted 2-time with PBS, and then different concentrations of thrombin standard solution were injected. After incubating in the serum samples with the injected thrombin for 40 min, the aptasensor was washed with PBS and then tested in 25 mM PBS with DPV."

In this work, the fabrication of aptasensor by a successive assembly of p(Cu2+-TCY), AuNPs, and MCH/TBA was characterized by AFM. Figure 1 shows the topographic (a), threedimensional (b), and cross-sectional (c) AFM images of AuE upon stepwise assembly with p(Cu2+-TCY) (A), AuNPs (B), and MCH/TBA (C). As seen, there are some spherelike particles on the p(Cu2+-TCY) modified electrode (Figure 1A-a,A-b), and the average roughness of the surface is determined to be 10.4 nm with the largest height of 37.87 nm on the measured region (Figure 1A-c). After AuNPs were anchored, lots of small and uniform particles were observed (Figure 1B-a,B-b). The average surface roughness was decreased to 16.6 nm, while the largest height increased to 59.31 nm (Figure 1B-c). This result confirms that the AuNPs with the smaller and even size have been anchored on the p(Cu2+-TCY) modified electrode.

As shown in Figure S2A, when the assembly cycles of Cu2+-TCY increased from 1 to 3, the peak currents (Ip) increased gradually, indicating that increasing amounts of Cu2+-TCY molecules have been immobilized on AuE. When the cycle increased from 3 to 5, the peak current values began to decrease, likely due to the fact that the increase in the film thickness limits the electrode communication of p(Cu2+-TCY) with the AuE. Therefore, 3 cycles were chosen for the assembly of electroactive Cu2+-TCY. Figure S2B shows the relationship between the electrochemical impedance value (Ret) of the biosensor versus the immobilized time (h) of AuNPs. As shown, when immobilization time (t1) increase from 0 to 4 h, the electrochemical impedance value increase and then level off, indicating the adsorption saturation of AuNPs on the p(Cu2+-TCY). Therefore, 4 h was selected as the optimal time for the immobilization of AuNPs. Figure S2C shows the relationship between the Rct values of the aptasensor versus the immobilized time of TBA. As shown, the Rct values increase when immobilization time (t2) increases from 0 to 30 min and then level off, indicating that the immobilization reaction between AuNPs and TBA can be finished within 30 min on the electrode surface. Therefore, 30 min was selected as the optimal time for immobilization reaction in the subsequent fabrication assays of the aptasensor. Figure S2D shows the relationship between the oxidation peak currents (Ip) versus the incubation time of the aptasensor in the thrombin solution. Clearly, the values of Ip decrease when the immobilization time increase from 0 to 40 min and then keep constant, indicating that the reaction between thrombin and TBA reached equilibrium within 40 min. Therefore, 40 min was applied as the optimal reaction time for the capture of thrombin by the aptasensor."

The stability of the aptasensor was examined by storage of the prepared aptasensor in a refrigerator (4 \u25e6C) and then testing its electrochemical signal every day. The result shows that the electrochemical signal remains at 91.5% after storage for 7 days (Figure 4D), indicating that the aptasensor has good chemical stability when stored in a low-temperature environment. The excellent electrochemical stability can be ascribed to the high chemical stability of the inorganic-organic Cu2+-TCY polymer and the tight immobilization of aptamer on AuNPs via the stable Au-S bond."

The electroactive inorganic-organic polymer of p(Cu2+-TCY) was facilely in-situ prepared on the AuE via the repetitive immersing of AuE in TCY and Cu2+ solution. Then, the rich -SH group on the p(Cu2+-TCY) was utilized as the functional site for the attachment of AuNPs. After further assembly of thiolated thrombin-specific aptamer, a novel aptamer bearing inherent electrochemical activity was achieved. The aptasensor realizes the integration of the electrochemical signal source and the immobilization matrix of the bioprobe. After the binding of the aptamer on the electrode surface with the target, the physical and chemical situation of the interface changed, resulting in the variation of the electrochemical signal of the p(Cu2+-TCY), and therefore the target can be table-free detected. The proposed aptasensor provides a new strategy for the construction of sensitive and facile electrochemical aptasensor.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bios13050532/s1, Figure S1: The ATR-FTIR image of p(Cu2+TCY); Figure S2: Experimental condition optimization; Figure S3: Specificity of aptasensor; Figure S4: Reproducibility of the aptasensor; Table S1: Comparison of analytical performance of the proposed aptasensor with the reported ones.
