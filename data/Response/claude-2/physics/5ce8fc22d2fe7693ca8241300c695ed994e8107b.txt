 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the specific mechanisms by which CBEO modulates MAPK, NF-ÎºB, and PKB/AKT signaling in melanoma cells. For example, investigate the effects on upstream regulators or downstream targets of these pathways. 

2. Evaluate the antitumor effects of CBEO in additional melanoma cell lines, including ones with different mutational profiles (e.g. BRAF mutations). This could provide insight into whether effectiveness varies across molecular subtypes.

3. Assess the ability of CBEO to inhibit melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo using mouse xenograft or syngeneic tumor models. This could support translation to clinical studies. 

4. Identify the specific components of CBEO that contribute to its antimelanoma effects, and evaluate their mechanisms of action. This could lead to more potent therapeutic fractions or compounds.

5. Investigate potential synergistic interactions between CBEO and current melanoma therapies like BRAF/MEK inhibitors or immunotherapies. Combination strategies could help overcome resistance mechanisms.
