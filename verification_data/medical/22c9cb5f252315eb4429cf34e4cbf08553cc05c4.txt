"Further examination of the link between behaviors compiled utilizing NUtrack and reproductive traits is necessitated to further isolate behavioral differences for potential use in selection decisions." 

"Determining potential underlying mechanisms that explain differences in time allocation and preference of lying lateral versus lying sternal should be explored."

"Future research should examine farrowing behavior and postural changes in gilts who spend a significant amount of time lying lateral or lying sternal."

"However, in future research, it is important to quantify a genetic link between activity traits and farrowing traits."
