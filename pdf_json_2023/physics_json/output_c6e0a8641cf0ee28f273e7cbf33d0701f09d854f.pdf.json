    "abstractText": "Herein, barium tungstate BaWO4 nanocrystals were chemically prepared and then estimated as inorganic sorbent material to eliminate the radioactive cobalt and europium from the waste stream. The characterization of BaWO4 nanocrystals is completed over several analytical techniques. TEM and SEM images show the formation of sphere-shaped BaWO4 structures in the nanoscale range. Also, XRD and FTIR revealed the successful preparation of BaWO4. Optimum factors affected by the sorption process are determined using batch mode. Sorption equilibrium was achieved after 60 min with the initial concentration of metal ion at 100 mg/L and at optimum pH five for both radionuclides, respectively. The different kinetic models are applied. The obtained data shows that the sorption process followed a pseudo-second order. The sorption capacity for 60Co at pH of 5 and 25 \u00b0C is 310.6 mg g\u22121, and 152+154Eu is 409.9 mg g\u22121. The thermodynamic studies illustrated that the sorption process was spontaneous and endothermic.",

So, removing the radioactive wastes has become an essential challenge that must be solved precisely1\u20136. Many radioisotopes (128Pd, 137Cs, 235U, 89Sr, 59Fe, 131I, 57Co, 65Zn, 241Am, etc.) are the primary contaminants present in radioactive waste generated from medicine, nuclear power plants, industrial effluents, agriculture, and research5,7\u201310. Various methods were applied to remove the radioscopies from the waste stream, such as membrane separation5, solvent extraction, photocatalysis7, ion exchange8, and adsorption9,10. The adsorption technique is vastly prestigious as a potential way to eliminate radionuclides in respect of many merits such as elevated efficiency and depressed cost as well as simple operation9,11\u201315. A broad domain of sorbent materials, such as nano metal oxides chitosan, zeolites, functionalized graphene, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), MXene, composite materials, and Covalent organic frameworks functionalized electrodes, are available for the adsorption method16\u201320. The nanoparticles have acquired appreciable attentiveness in many applications because of their distinctive properties, such as high surface area and well-controlled facets.\nThe heaviest component of the alkaline earth tungstate family is barium tungstate (BaWO4). BaWO4 (BWO) crystallizes in the tetragonal scheelite-type structure at room temperature, similar to several ABX4-type compounds. As a result of its exceptional electrical conductivity, magnetic characteristics, and luminescence, BWO has drawn considerable interest21. BWO-based materials are of crucial importance in a broad range of technical applications, including light-emitting diodes22, humidity sensors23, optical filters24, optoelectronic25, dielectric materials26, and luminescence27. Recently, BWO-based materials have been used as efficient materials to remove dyes and hazardous contaminants for water treatment applications28\u201331.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature regarding the use of BWO nanostructured material in the sorption of radioactive cobalt and europium from aqueous solutions. In this study, BWO nanostructures were obtained by facile soft chemical technique, following their characterization to investigate their structural, microstructural, elemental, and surface characteristics by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, and FTIR spectroscopy. The second section looked at the capabilities of BaWO4 in the sorption of radioactive cobalt and europium from aqueous solutions.

The XRD pattern reveals the synthesis of pure single-phase BWO with a tetragonal phase and is similar to those presented in the literature28,32,33.\nThe FT-IR characterization approach was employed to evaluate the chemical bond formation and numerous interactions between the BWO nanostructures. In Fig.\u00a02b, FT-IR spectra of BWO have been demonstrated. The primary absorption bands include 795 and 2980\u00a0 cm\u22121.

SEM micrographs revealed the uniform sphere-like structural characteristics of the synthesized BWO. A low-magnification SEM image demonstrates the excessive production of nanospheres. Small aggregations of nanospheres are detected with higher resolution, which might be due to inter-particle contact during the synthesis process.

Furthermore, the mapping images revealed that all elements are distributed uniformly throughout the BWO nanocrystals, as presented in Fig.\u00a04.\nDetermination of point of zero charge The point of zero charges, pHpzc, is defined as the point at which the net charge of the material surface is zero; above it, the surface charge is negative, and below it, the surface charge is positive. The low value of pHpzc indicates that the material is a promising sorbent since it has a wide range of pH values at which the surface has a negative charge. Hence, it can attract the cations in a wide range of pH values. Figure\u00a05 displays a relation between the initial pH, pHi, and pHF. The point at which the value of pHi is equal to pHF (\u0394pH = 0) was recorded as pHpzc of BWO surface and found to be 3.5.

It is clear that the uptake of both radionuclides is pH dependent, and the removal percentage of the both radionuclide adsorbed onto the BWO increase with increasing the values of pH. At the low pH values, the uptake of a radionuclide has been inhibited; this may be due to the existence of a hydrogen proton (H+) that competes with the radioactive cobalt and europium for the adsorption sites onto the BWO surface36. The speciation was done using Hydra/Medusa chemical equilibrium software13 at 100\u00a0mg/L initial metal ions concentration at room temperature and pH range 1\u201312. From the speciation diagram, Fig.\u00a07A, the divalent species, Co2+, is the predominant cobalt species at pH below 7.6; above this value, the cobalt ion is precipitated as Co(OH)2. Therefore, the total cobalt removal at pH < 7.6 is mainly attributed to the sorption process, while the precipitation process is the major mechanism at pH > 7.6. The monovalent species, CoOH+, is presented at a pH value greater than 3. This means that the divalent species, Co2+, and the monovalent species, CoOH+, coexist at a pH range of 3\u20137.6. While for europium ions, the trivalent species, Eu3 + , is the dominant species till pH 6, it starts to precipitate as Eu(OH)3 species at pH above 6 as displayed in Fig.\u00a07B).

Then, the adsorption of radioactive elements has been in a steady state. The amount of europium adsorbed on the surface of the BWO nanospheres was greater than that of adsorbed cobalt; this signalizes that the hydrated ions of both cobalt and europium affect the adsorption process. The europium atomic radius is greater than the cobalt atomic radius. So, the hydrated radius for 152+154Eu is lower than the hydrated radius for 60Co, and this means that the highest atomic radius becomes the littlest hydrated, so the quantity of europium adsorbed onto the BWO nanospheres becomes higher. The effect of temperature on the adsorption process was also studied, and it was found that the higher the temperature, the greater the adsorption of europium and cobalt, which indicates that this process is endothermic."

The Lagergren equation (pseudo-first order expression) has been shown as follows37:\nwhere qe and qt (mg/g) are the amount of the radionuclide sorbed at equilibrium and at time t, respectively, and k1 is the rate constant of the pseudo-first-order model (min-1). Figure\u00a09a,b shows the linear relationship between log (qe-qt) and t. The intercept and slope were used to determine the calculated sorption capacities at equilibrium (qe) and rate constant (k1) of the first-order kinetic model, respectively. The qe and k1 values and the correlation coefficients (R2) values of each radionuclide are given in Table\u00a01. The linearity relation produced from the figure of the pseudo-first-order kinetic model suggests the applicability of the pseudo-first-order kinetic model to appropriate the experimental results through the initial period of the sorption procedure. Also, the values of calculated sorption capacities at equilibrium, qe, must conform with the values of the experimental data of the sorption process. Table\u00a01 shows that the linear correlation coefficients of the sorption process are excellent; the values calculated qe do not agree with experimental qe for both studied radionuclides. Therefore, it could be suggested that the sorption of both radionuclides onto prepared BWO nanospheres is not a first-order reaction. The pseudo-second-order has been demonstrated in the following6:\nThe k2 refers to the rate constant of the pseudo-second-order, g mg-1\u00a0 min-1. The plots of t/qt versus t for each 60Co and 152\u00fe154Eu radionuclides at various temperatures are given in Fig.\u00a09c,d. The high correlation coefficient (R2), and the linear relationship between t/qt and t explain that the sorption behavior of each radionuclide follows pseudo-second-order kinetics. The correlation coefficient values (R2) (> 0.99) are high, as well as the calculated sorption capacity (qe) at equilibrium is proportionate with the experimental data. These results illustrate that the rate of the pseudo-second-order model is prevalent, and the chemical sorption process controls the sorption behavior for each radionuclide10.\nElovich equation has been applied successfully for describing the second-order model by claiming that the effective solid surface is energetically heterogeneous.\n(3)log ( qe \u2212 qt ) = log qe \u2212 k1\n2.303 t\n(4) t\nqt =\n1\nk2 q2e +\n1 qe t\nFigure\u00a08.

As the adsorption temperature increased, the values of \u03b1 increased, and the values of \u03b2 decreased. The value of \u03b2 is connected with the range of surface coverage. Increasing the initial rate for the adsorption process is based on the temperature that decreases the accessibility of the adsorption surface towards the adsorbate. The obtained data indicates that the adsorption rate could be amplified using increasing temperature. The trend about \u03b2 is proportionate with the data obtained from conventional systems of activated chemisorption; this points out that \u03b2 is a signal to several available sites on the surface of the BWO nanospheres for the adsorption process. The intraparticle diffusion model elucidates ions migration from the bulk of aqueous medium towards the surface of sorbent material. This model has been used to display the adsorption process for studied ions onto the BWO. The intraparticle model has been clarified by Weber\u2013Morris utilizing the following expression:\nThe Kdi points out the rate constant of this model (mg/g min1/2), and C refers to the constant that articulates the thickness of the boundary layer. The intraparticle diffusion rate was obtained from the plots qt versus t1/2, as shown in Fig.\u00a010c,d. According to this model, the plotting graphic of qt versus t1/2 gives a straight line. It can be assumed that the involved mechanism of the sorption process is controlled by intraparticle diffusion. The values of intercept C give an idea about the boundary layer thickness, i.e., the larger the intercept, the greater the boundary layer effect. Values of C and Kdi, the intraparticle diffusion rate constant, are given in Table\u00a01 for cobalt and europium."

The constants of the Langmuir model Qo and b for the sorption of each radionuclide increased with temperature, indicating that the capacity of sorption process and intensity of sorption are enhanced as temperatures increased. As the temperature increases the monolayer sorption capacity increases; this suggests that the active surface available for sorption has been increased with temperature.

The kinetics studies of each radionuclide have been studied, and acquired data investigated utilizing different kinetic models. Obtained data elucidated that a pseudo-second-order mechanism is prevailing. The sorption has been controlled by a chemical mechanism. Different isotherm models estimated equilibrium isotherms, and the results were successfully modeled utilizing Langmuir and Freundlich, as well as Dubinin-Radushkviech (D-R) models. According to the D-R model, the maximum sorption capacity and the mean free energy of the studied ions have been determined. The sorption of both radionuclides is an endothermic process and spontaneous in nature. These obtained data showed that synthetic barium tungstate nanocrystals are promising sorbent materials for removing 60Co and 152+154Eu from the waste stream."
