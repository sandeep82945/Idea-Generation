    "abstractText": "Our study aimed to evaluate differences in outcomes of patients submitted to spinal fusion using different grafts measuring the effectiveness of spinal fusion rates, pseudarthrosis rates, and adverse events. Applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses statement, this systematic review and meta\u2010analysis identified 64 eligible articles. The main inclusion criteria were adult patients that were submitted to spinal fusion, autologous iliac crest (AIC), allograft (ALG), alloplastic (ALP; hydroxyapatite, rhBMP\u20102, rhBMP\u20107, or the association between them), and local bone (LB), whether in addition to metallic implants or not, was applied. We made a comparison among those groups to evaluate the presence of differences in outcomes, such as fusion rate, hospital stay, follow\u2010up extension (6, 12, 24, and 48 months), pseudarthrosis rate, and adverse events. Sixty\u2010 four studies were identified. LB presented significantly higher proportions of fusion rates (95.3% CI 89.7\u201398.7) compared to the AIC (88.6% CI 84.8\u201391.9), ALG (87.8% CI 80.8\u201393.4), and ALP (85.8% CI 75.7\u201393.5) study groups. Pseudarthrosis presented at a significantly lower pooled proportion of ALG studies (4.8% CI 0.1\u201315.7) compared to AIC (8.6% CI 4.2\u201314.2), ALP (7.1% CI 0.9\u201318.2), and LB (10.3% CI 1.8\u201324.5). ALP and AIC studies described significantly more cases of adverse events (80 events/404 patients and 860 events/2001 patients, respectively) compared to LB (20 events/311 patients) and ALG (73 events/459 patients). Most studies presented high risk\u2010of\u2010bias scores. Based on fusion rates and adverse events proportions, LB showed a superior trend among the graft cases we analyzed. However, our review revealed highly heterogeneous data and a need for more rigorous studies to better address and assist surgeons\u2019 choices of the best spinal grafts.",

ALP and AIC studies described significantly more cases of adverse events (80 events/404 patients and 860 events/2001 patients, respectively) compared to LB (20 events/311 patients) and ALG (73 events/459 patients). Most studies presented high risk\u2011of\u2011bias scores. Based on fusion rates and adverse events proportions, LB showed a superior trend among the graft cases we analyzed. However, our review revealed highly heterogeneous data and a need for more rigorous studies to better address and assist surgeons\u2019 choices of the best spinal grafts.\nSpine fusions have become a frequent treatment choice for distinct spinal pathologies over the past four decades. Rajaee et\u00a0al.1 estimated a spinal fusion rate increase from 64.5 cases per 100,000 adults in 1998 to 135.5 cases per 100,000 in 2008. Primary cervical and lumbar fusion increased from 73.717 and 77.682 in 1998 to 157.966 and 210.4047 in 2008, respectively1. In the United States, lumbar degenerative disc disease surgical interventions increased from 21,223 in 2000 to 55,467 in 20092. Similarly, the market for spinal implants and devices was estimated at $7 billion in sales between 2013 and 20143, reflecting an increase in material availability. However, the current literature insufficiently confirms the superiority of one intervention or graft4,5.\nLike any other surgical intervention, spine fusions can lead to unexpected outcomes, such as pseudarthrosis or other adverse events. Pseudarthrosis can be defined as a solid fusion failure, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, that can increase the risk of neurologic symptoms, material failure, and deformity6,7. To make appropriate decisions, surgeons must weigh the effectiveness versus costs of each graft type.\nAutologous iliac crest (AIC) graft has been considered the gold standard treatment for spinal fusion because of its histocompatible and non-immunogenic properties, presenting higher amounts of cancellous bone, growth factors, and pluripotent cells related to osteoinduction, osteogenesis, and osteoconduction8\u201310. Unfortunately, spinal fusions with AIC have been associated with several morbidities, such as a higher incidence of infection, donor site pain, hematoma development, increased operative time, and blood loss11\u201316.\nOPEN\n1Department of Research of IPSPAC-Instituto Paulista de Sa\u00fade para Alta Complexidade, 215 Alameda Terracota, cj 407, Sao Caetano do Sul, SP 09531-190, Brazil. 2Institute of Neurology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, 255 Dr. En\u00e9as de Carvalho Aguiar avenue, Cerqueira C\u00e9sar, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP 05403-900, Brazil. *email: pesquisacientifica@ ipspac.org.br\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:7546 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11551-8\nAs consequence of AIC drawbacks, alternative grafts have been developed, and these alternatives are increasingly diverse and available. Such materials can be classified as extender, enhancer, or substitute grafts17,18. An extender decreases the need for large amounts of autologous bone grafting (ABG) while offering the same bone formation properties as AIC17,18. An enhancer is a material combined with ABG to increase successful fusion rates compared to ABG alone17,18. A substitute replaces an ABG and presents the same or higher healing success rates compared to ABG alone17,18.\nThese materials are often assembled in various proportions to achieve spinal fusion17. However, allograft (ALG) and alloplastic (ALP) grafts are foreign bodies that carry some inherent risks. Considering their pros and cons, AIC use is favorable since AIC need not be associated with other grafts to achieve reliable results19. One frequently used alternative is local bone (LB), however, to our best knowledge, previous studies have only compared autologous bone graft with ALP and ALG. They failed to make a subdivision of autologous bone graft in LB and AIC. This is crucial since if it is possible to avoid using AIC, or other nonlocal bone, the post operatory morbidity, especially residual pain and an extra wound/scar, can be avoided."

            "text": "This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement20. A comprehensive web-based literature search was conducted through to January 2021, using three databases (Lilacs, PubMed, and Cochrane), by two independent authors (SAF and ASMS), without publication-language restrictions. For all databases, controlled vocabulary and text word searches were performed, using a combination of the keywords: \u201cspinal fusion AND autograft AND spinous process\u201d, \u201cspinal fusion AND autograft AND spinal lamina\u201d, \u201cspinal fusion AND autograft AND iliac crest\u201d, \u201cspinal fusion AND heterograft\u201d, \u201cspinal fusion AND allograft AND spinous process\u201d, \u201cspinal fusion AND allograft AND spinal lamina\u201d, \u201cspinal fusion AND allograft AND iliac crest\u201d. Our search was direct toward adult patients that were submitted to spinal fusion, which ALG, ALP, LB or AIC was applied. Due to an increase in medical devices availability nowadays, we compared these groups between them to evaluate the presence of differences or superiority in outcomes, such as fusion rate, hospital stay, follow-up extension (6, 12, 24, and 48\u00a0months), pseudarthrosis rate, and adverse events.\nTitles, abstracts, and full-text studies were reviewed according to pre-established criteria, and then the relevant data were extracted. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with the remainder of the research team. This study\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Table\u00a01. Retrospective studies, prospective analyses, randomized clinical trials, and case series were included in this review. The cut-off date for the review was January 31, 2021.\nData extraction. The following data were abstracted from all included studies: study design, year, patient demographics, preoperative assessment, intraoperative information, postoperative assessment, hospital stay, followup extension, fusion rate, pseudarthrosis rate (comprising reported data for nonunion and pseudarthrosis), and adverse events (graft-related, infections, and neurological). Data were partially (one graft-type group of interest) or fully (all graft-type groups in the study) extracted from comparative studies, in accordance with our inclusion criteria. Two investigators (SAF and ASMS) independently performed a systematic review of all identified citations. No attempts were made to contact the authors of the reviewed studies to obtain missing or unreported data. Our main outcome of interest was fusion rates, and secondary outcomes included pseudarthrosis and adverse event rates.\nRisk of bias assessments and evaluations of validity. The quality of eligible studies and their risk of bias (RoB) were examined by two reviewers (SAF and ASMS) using the methodological index for non\u2010randomized studies (MINORS)21, and the Cochrane\u2019s collaboration tool for assessing RoB22 in randomized controlled trials. The high risk of bias for RoB score for non-randomized studies was determined to be \u2264 8 (controlled group not present) or \u2264 12 (controlled group present). For randomized controlled trials, each domain was classified as unclear bias, low RoB, or high RoB.\nHeterogeneity assessments. Heterogeneity between studies was examined using the I2 statistic and the P-value for heterogeneity23. Substantial heterogeneity is defined as \u2265 50%24.\nTable 1.

Meta-analysis of proportions, using MedCalc 16.2.0, was performed to estimate an overall weighted proportion and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome of interest. MedCalc uses a Freeman\u2013Tukey transformation to calculate summary proportions, weighted according to the number of patients described in each study. We determined the pooled proportion using a random-effects model. Data were summarized in tables and further stratified based on bone graft types (AIC, ALG, ALP, [comprising hydroxyapatite, rhBMP-2, rhBMP-7, titanium cages], and LB). The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to compare variables among the four groups, and\u00a0post hoc\u00a0analyses using Mann\u2013Whitney\u00a0U\u00a0tests were performed to compare two groups. When multiple follow-up periods were available for a study, data from the last assessment were used for the combined analyses. Subsequently, the fusion rates stratified by bone graft substitutes (bone graft alone or combined with metallic implants), and follow-up periods (6, 12, 24, and 48\u00a0months) were further analyzed (subgroup analysis). Studies that did not report the timing of fusion rates assessments were excluded from this subgroup analysis. Further analysis (meta-regression) to identify factors related to fusion rates (surgical approach, pseudarthrosis, and adverse events) were unsuccessful because the methods used to report the data were inconsistent across studies."

After passing a screening phase, 184 studies were fully reviewed, leading to 120 exclusions that are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. A total of 64 studies (4177 subjects) were selected for this systematic review. Analyses were performed by reorganizing studies according to graft material (with or without metallic implants) samples, resulting in 91 analyses (51 analyses regarding AIC, 9 analyses regarding ALG, 20 analyses regarding ALP, and 10 analyses regarding LB). PRISMA checklist can be consulted at Supplementary Table\u00a02. According to MINORS21 and Cochrane\u2019s collaboration tool for assessing RoB22, the majority of studies presented high RoB scores, as demonstrated on Supplementary Table\u00a03 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and 3.\nParticipant demographics. Patients\u2019 and procedures\u2019 characteristics are summarized in Table\u00a02. Overall, patients\u2019 main diagnoses for surgical intervention were degenerative diseases (78.8%). A thorough analysis of follow-up, procedure duration, blood loss, and hospital length of stays (LOS) was impaired due to a lack of systematic reports. Data were inconsistent across studies since none of the ALG articles specified hospital LOS. Similarly, some aspects had been exposed by a unique author, such as procedure time and blood loss in the ALG and ALP groups.\nPre\u2011 and post\u2011operative assessments. Patient assessments were not reported systematically, making this study\u2019s analysis difficult. Apart from distinct assessments during patients\u2019 clinical courses, such as weight and height (in preoperative assessments) and Odom\u2019s criteria (in postoperative assessments), pre- and postoperative assessments included matching analysis only for Japanese Orthopedic Association Score (JOA) and Nurick Grade reports in the AIC group.

LB presented significantly higher proportions of fusion rates (346 fusions out of 366; 95.3% CI 89.7\u201398.7; Fig.\u00a01) compared to the AIC (2038 fusions out of 2336; 88.6% CI 84.8\u2013 91.9; Fig.\u00a02), ALG (381 fusions out of 494; 87.8% CI 80.8\u201393.4: Fig.\u00a03), and ALP (613 fusions out of 744; 85.8% CI 75.7\u201393.5; Fig.\u00a04) study groups. Moderately to highly significant inconsistency (I2 > 50%, P < 0.001) was found in all proportion analyses (86.4%, 74.9%, 73.8%, and 91.6%, for AIC, LB, ALG, and ALP, respectively).\nSubgroup analysis. To determine what proportion of the summary results were driven by studies that had used grafts with metallic implants, we conducted subgroup analysis by dividing the studies into groups with grafts alone and grafts with metallic implants for all study groups. For AIC alone, the pooled proportion of fusion rates stood at 85.6% (CI 79.8\u201390.5, I2 = 87.6%), whereas AIC with metallic implants showed fusion rates of 92.3% (CI 87.6\u201396.0, I2 = 81.6%).

Detailed information about rates and confidence intervals are presented in Supplementary Table\u00a04.\nMeta\u2011analysis of secondary outcomes. Only 32 studies described rates of pseudarthrosis: 17 in the AIC group, six in the ALP group, four in the ALG group, and five in the LB group. Pseudarthrosis presented a pooled proportion of 14.2% CI 8.9\u201320.5%, I2 = 74.2%, and P < 0.0001 for the lumbar spine region (88 of 625 patients) versus 4.1% CI 1.6\u20137.7%, I2 = 76.6%, and P < 0.0001 for the cervical spine (29 of 776 patients). According to applied grafts, pseudarthrosis achieved a significantly lower pooled proportion in ALG studies (four events among 243 patients, 4.8% CI 0.1\u201315.7, I2 = 77.3%) compared to AIC studies (81 events among 851 patients, 8.6% CI 4.2\u201314.2, I2 = 84.0%), ALP studies (14 events among 153 patients, 7.1% CI 0.9\u201318.2, I2 = 78.3%), and LB studies (18 events among 154 patients, 10.3% CI 1.8\u201324.5, I2 = 81.7%).\nAdverse events analysis was performed using three main categories: pain, infection, and graft-related events (graft collapse, fragmentation, protrusion, or breach). We also added donor site morbidity for the AIC sample. ALP and AIC studies described significantly more cases (80 events among 404 patients and 860 events among 2001 patients, respectively) than LB studies (20 events among 311 patients) and ALG studies (73 events among 459 patients). For our proportion analysis, we considered only events per patient. Table\u00a04 displays our proportions analysis calculations based on the available data."

            "text": "Through our primary outcome analysis, our study showed a higher proportion of fusion rates for LB (95.3%) compared to AIC (88.6%), ALG (87.8%), and ALP (85.8%). This finding was not expected since LB has less trabecular bone, which would theoretically result in less bone marrow and less availability of the pluripotent cells and growth factors25. Also, LB\u2019s limited harvestable volume narrows its surgical recommendations, and it is commonly applied to the cervical spine (which involves a smaller area to cover and less body load to sustain compared to the lumbar spine).\nOur sample mainly comprised AIC (2529) patients, followed by ALP (766), ALG (516), and LB (366) patients. This size discrepancy could explain the LB fusion effect among our pooled samples, which could exacerbate LB\u2019s effect. Moreover, most studies did not present participants baseline assessments, and since the fusion quality of\nFigure\u00a04. Alloplastic pooled proportional rate for spinal fusion.\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:7546 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11551-8\ndistinctive grafts can diverge by age, metabolic activity, or graft-bed preparation26,27, confirming LB graft fusions superiority to the other studied options is challenging. Similarly, most of the reviewed studies did not follow the FDA\u2019s guidance for spinal fusion evaluations28, increasing their assessment bias.\nAdditionally, the literature has often identified conflicting opinions regarding the optimal association between surgical techniques and patients\u2019 underlying predictive factors for spinal fusions and spinal grafts. Other metaanalyses, that have considered assorted graft materials or surgical approaches, have demonstrated higher fusion rates using rhBMP27,29,30 or when grafts are associated with the anterior lumbar interbody fusion technique31. Moreover, minimally invasive procedures did not demonstrate fusion rate differences compared to open surgical techniques32.\nConsidering the data inconsistencies in our primary analysis, which precluded further associations (e.g., fusion rate \u00d7 graft type \u00d7 surgical technique), we performed a subgroup analysis of fusion rates with or without metallic implants. In this subgroup, LB presented lower fusion rates when associated with metallic implants, and this finding could be explained by LB limitations in graft volume availability33 and/or small patient sample.\nPseudarthrosis rates and adverse events were studied as secondary outcomes. Our pseudarthrosis analysis revealed that the reported data presented a higher proportional rate of pseudarthrosis in the lumbar spine (14.2%) than the cervical spine (4.1%), consistently with previous analyses6, which was explained by the increased difficulty of stabilizing areas that support higher loads34,35. Furthermore, our analysis of bone graft types revealed that LB presented a higher pooled proportional pseudarthrosis rate (10.5%). However, some considerations are worth mentioning. Pseudarthrosis rates were not systematically assessed across the reviewed studies (AIC 17 of 51 analyses; ALG 4 of 9 analyses; ALP 6 of 20 analyses; and LB 5 of 10 analyses), which could have exacerbated the discrepancy between patient quantity and analyzed effects. Similarly, authors\u2019 descriptions of their results did not suggest that pseudarthrosis can be presumed to directly result from fusion rates\u2019 missing from fusion rate analyses. Moreover, the literature did not present a conclusive role governing bone grafts\u2019 influence on pseudarthrosis rates6.\nGreater pseudarthrosis rates have already been associated with advanced age (because of delayed bridging maturation and increased bone resorption)36, degenerative disease, and construct length6. Longer fusions can enable loading distribution, minimizing excess motion and helping to decrease pseudarthrosis34,37. However, they can also increase points of load failure for each adjacent segment34, demand more grafts, and increase patients\u2019 exposure to complications (due to an extensive surgical intervention). Nevertheless, our literature review examined a limited sample for this subgroup analysis, and it included many studies with moderate to high heterogeneity, reflecting pseudarthrosis evaluations\u2019 diversity. For example, Choudhri et\u00a0al.38 recommend CT imaging with fine-cut axial and multiplanar reconstruction to evaluate spinal fusions. Nonetheless, no radiographic gold standard is available with which to evaluate pseudarthrosis38 compared to open surgical exploration. Therefore, as in the literature, our review did not reveal a conclusive role governing bone grafts\u2019 influence on pseudarthrosis rates6.\nMoreover, many available studies presented substantial methodological flaws regarding adverse events, limiting analyses. AIC pain corresponded to a 23.4% pooled proportional rate and a significant proportion of donor site morbidity (23.2%), corroborating the previously mentioned graft drawbacks already described in the literature11\u201316. Unsurprisingly, and as we have mentioned, foreign bodies can carry some inherent risks, which could explain ALP\u2019s higher pooled proportional rates of infection (10.2%) and graft-related events (35.1%).\nOur study faced other limitations. Heterogeneity was found in different aspects of the reviewed studies\u2019 populations. This heterogeneity arose from clinical diversity in both treatment groups, supported by insufficient analyses, a small pool of subjects, differences on assessing patients\u2019 baseline and outcomes, and the absence of systematic reports (e.g., the use of tobacco or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could have led to a misinterpretation of fusion rates). Moreover, a standard tool for data collection could improve data availability for fusion rate analysis and pseudarthrosis assessment. Furthermore, we did not include all available ALP grafts due to the high existent variability, which could wane proportional analysis. An example is the platelet rich plasma, which is gaining recognition as an important adjunct in the spinal graft market39. Finally, an overall higher RoB\u2014which could influence appraisals of interventions effects\u2014indicated a lack of structured randomized trials. Moreover, successful treatments should be interpreted in light of patients diminished exposure to nosocomial events, acceptable survival rates, and function after treatment.\nComparing the inputs of more than three decades of medical evolution is challenging, given technical improvements, instrumental variations, and a greater range of material. The competition for better outcomes versus materials will continue, as well the difficulty of medical updates and the discernment of industry interests.\nTable 4. Adverse events proportions analysis.

Standardized methods to evaluate spinal fusion and pseudarthrosis are encouraged."
