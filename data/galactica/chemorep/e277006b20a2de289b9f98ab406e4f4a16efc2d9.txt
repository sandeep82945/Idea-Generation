conclusion A series of Fe-Cu binary oxides were prepared under different solution pH values. The crystallinity and saturation magnetization of prepared Fe-Cu binary oxide increased with an increase in synthetic pH value. Simultaneously, the morphology of FCBO changed gradually from irregular agglomerate to relatively uniform polyhedron. The adsorption of arsenic on FCBOs is remarkably affected by the surface structure and crystallinity, decreasing as the degree of crystallinity increases. Surface hydroxyl density of FCBOs is an important parameter to evaluate its arsenic adsorption ability. Nevertheless, the adsorption ability may be overestimated if only this parameter is used. As (V) is sorbed by the FCBOs via formation of inner-sphere surface complexes and As (III) is
sorbed through formation of both inner- and outer-sphere surface complexes. This investigation provides new insights into structure-performance relationship of FCBOs system, which are beneficial to develop new and efficient sorbents.
