Anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with PRM and ADOG, respectively, whereas the PRM and ADOG data demonstrated a positive correlation. Depression/anxiety and prospective memory also played a chain intermediary role between gender and ADOG.",

            "text": "The academic delay of gratification (ADOG) represents the psychological tendency to delay immediate gratification or the impulse to pursue more valuable long-term learning goals. This concept was first introduced by Bembenutty and Karabenick (1998). The main idea of ADOG is that it enhances students\u2019 ability for self-control and self-regulation. Moreover, it is translated into the maintenance of confidence and persistence while they face boredom and difficulties during the realization process of the overall academic goals. In that sense, they can actively resist possible temptations and concentrate on completing their studies. The previous survey Bembenutty et\u00a0 al. (2001) showed that ADOG was an important predictor of students\u2019 evaluation for teachers\u2019 teaching effect, which could significantly predict students\u2019 academic performance. Students with higher ADOG demonstrated better self-efficacy, which was the reason for achieving greater academic performance (Bembenutty, 2002a).\nIt is due to the fact, that at this age the cognitive control system mediated by central nervous is relatively immature and so some of the brain functions are not fully developed. Consequently, ADOG can easily be\u00a0 affected by the internal and external environment (Anokhin et\u00a0 al., 2011). Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the factors that influence students\u2019 ADOG with an ulterior purpose to improve their academic performance (Zhuo, 2007).\nBembenutty and Karabenick (1998) reported that female college students had higher levels of ADOG than their male counterparts. The difference between males and females in the ADOG has yet to be\u00a0sufficiently explained. There is no difference between males and females in intelligence level and learning ability. Therefore, we\u00a0suspect that the differences in the cognitive styles of males and females may be\u00a0influenced by external factors that lead to these differences in academic delayed gratification.\nAcademic delay of gratification can be\u00a0 affected by many factors. College students are found in the transition period between youth and adulthood, and their emotions are unstable. Family and school environment, the pressure exerted by the thought of future employment and other difficult situations impact their mental health, resulting in a high incidence of anxiety and depression (Regehr et\u00a0al., 2013; Unwin et\u00a0al., 2013). Studies have shown that negative emotions such as anxiety and depression harmed students\u2019 studies (Awadalla et\u00a0 al., 2020). Moreover, alleviating anxiety and depression could help learners improve ADOG and devote themselves in a better way to the current learning tasks (Bembenutty, 2009). This suggested a negative correlation between negative emotions and ADOG.\nRecent data indicated that negative emotions such as anxiety and depression led to adverse results regarding the prospective memory (Zhou et\u00a0 al., 2017). The prospective memory represents thinking focused on the future and more specifically involves planned activities and events in the future (Brandimonte et\u00a0al., 2014). It is a cognitive activity, which is closely related to people\u2019s daily life but also to self-control and\nmetacognition. Impairment of the prospective memory will lead to the declination of self-control, which may affect ADOG (Beran et\u00a0 al., 2016). Therefore, it suggests that the prospective memory performing a cognitive function can be\u00a0 affected by individual and external factors, which may result in an adverse effect on ADOG along with emotional abnormalities.\nAt present, studies have found that males are more likely to be\u00a0affected by anxiety and depression, which can result in learning problems (Derdikman-Eiron et\u00a0al., 2012). For instance, a recent survey found that male college students in China suffer from more serious depression than female students (Gao et\u00a0al., 2020). Based on the above research conclusions, the following hypothesis was put forward: depression/anxiety and prospective memory play a chain intermediary role between gender and ADOG\uff0cthat is, gender \u2192 depression/anxiety \u2192 prospective memory \u2192 ADOG\u201d.\nIn summary, this study constructed a chain-mediation effect model in accordance with the previous research results, and it examined the mechanisms between gender and ADOG in college students to explore the mediating roles of depression/anxiety and prospective memory in this process."

The obtained score was classified into five levels: 0\u20134, 5\u20139, 10\u201314, 15\u201319, and 20\u201327 corresponding to non-mild, moderate, moderately-severe, and severe anxiety, respectively. In this study, the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of the standardized item was 0.905, whereas the KMO test coefficient (Bartlett\u2019s test, p < 0.05) was 0.930. Those two coefficients showcased the high reliability and validity of the scale.\nThe first item of PHQ-9 is \u201cLittle interest or pleasure in doing things,\u201d and the actual responses of the subjects were \u201cnot at all\u201d in 239 (39.19 percent), \u201cseveral days\u201d in 293 (48.23 percent), \u201cmore than half the days\u201d in 59 (9.68 percent), \u201cnearly every day\u201d in 18 (2.9 percent).

The average score of this item was 0.78.\nProspective and retrospective memory questionnaire\nPRM Questionnaire was previously translated into Chinese and validated by researchers in China (Jing, 2013). The scale included prospective and retrospective memory. Specifically, retrospective memory was considered the basis for the realization of prospective memory. Therefore, the sum of those two memories reflected on the ability level of prospective memory. The scale included 16 items, with grade scores from 1 to 5 with the total score ranging between 16 and 80. When the score was higher, that\nwas considered to lead to greater memory performance. In this study, the two coefficients showed reliability and validity of the scale, since the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of the standardized item was 0.895 and the KMO test coefficient (Bartlett\u2019s test, p < 0.05) was 0.889.\nThe first item of PRMQ is \u201cDo they decide to do something in a few minutes time and then forget to do it?,\u201d and the actual responses of the subjects were \u201cvery often\u201d in 34 (5.65 percent). \u201cquite often\u201d in 98 (16.13 percent), \u201csometimes\u201d in 352 (57.74 percent), \u201crarely\u201d in 85 (13.87 percent), \u201cnever\u201d in 40 (6.61 percent).

The average score of this item was 2.58.\nAcademic delay of gratification scale for college students\nThe ADOG scale was developed by Bembenutty et\u00a0al. (2001), and was translated and revised into Chinese (Du, 2011). The ADOG scale included classroom ADOG and after-class ADOG. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions, all of which were dilemma situations. The 4-level score was used to measure students\u2019 ADOG ability by calculating the total score. In the case where the total score was higher, it was considered to correspond to the stronger ability of ADOG. The two coefficients (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 and KMO test) used in the current study were 0.853 and 0.865, respectively suggesting good reliability and validity of the ADOG scale.\nThe first item of ADOGS is \u201cA. Go to a favorite concert, play, or sporting event and study less for this course even though it may mean getting a lower grade on an exam you\u00a0will take tomorrow, OR B. Stay home and study to increase your chances of getting a higher grade,\u201d and the actual responses of the subjects were \u201cdefinitely choose A\u201d in 57 (9.35 percent), \u201cprobably choose A\u201d in 173 (28.93 percent), \u201cprobably choose B\u201d in 169 (27.74 percent), \u201cdefinitely choose B\u201d in 210 (34.52 percent).

            "text": "College students have a high degree of anxiety and depression\nOur results showed that 18.07% of college students had anxiety above the moderate level (GAD-7 \u2265 10) while 24.15% had depression above the moderate level (PHQ-9 \u2265 10). A recent study (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021) investigating the prevalence of psychological disorders under the Covid-19 pandemics in China showed that anxiety above the moderate level (GAD-7 \u2265 10) accounted for 19.4% (a survey between January and March 2020), while\ndepression was above the moderate level (GAD-7 \u2265 10) accounted for 24.8%. These data confirm our research results.\nThe emotional disorder screened by the scale was only the result of preliminary screening, and the specific situation needed to be\u00a0further verified. However, the results of this survey showed that the college students had higher anxiety and depression disorders, which had an impact on learning.\nThe significant gender differences in the generalized anxiety disorder scale, patient health questionnaire, prospective and retrospective memory, and academic delay of gratification among students\nOur study found that there were gender differences in the GAD-7, PHQ-9, PRM, and ADOG among college students. The female GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were lower than those of the males, while the female PRM and ADOG performance improved when compared to that of the males. The survey was conducted during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, a stress factor that had different effects on the mood and learning of male and female college students in China. For example, studies have found that male college students had higher levels of depression during the COVID-19 lockdown\nTABLE\u00a03 Correlation analysis of the GAD-7\uff0cPHQ-9\uff0cPRM\uff0cADOG, grade and age, respectively.\nScores (Mean \u00b1 SD) GAD-7 PHQ-9 PRM ADOG Grade Age\nGAD-7 5.087\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.744 1\nPHQ-9 6.506\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.565 0.740** 1\nPRM 52.893\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.396 \u22120.167** \u22120.215** 1\nADOG 28.887\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.270 \u22120.209** \u22120.186** 0.414** 1\nGrade 2.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 0.072 0.079 0.038 \u22120.043 1\nAge 20.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.63 0.068 0.035 0.052 \u22120.008 0.805** 1\nGAD-7, Generalized Anxiety Scale; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire; PRM, Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire; ADOG, Academic Delay of Gratification Scale for College Students. **p < 0.01.\nTABLE\u00a04 Regression analysis (dependent variable, ADOG).\nIndependent variables\nB SE \u03b2 t P X2 F P\nAnalysis 1 GAD-7 \u22120.175 0.05 \u22120.13 \u22123.537 0 0.206 31.82 0\nPRM 0.195 0.019 0.382 10.412 0\nGender 1.417 0.48 0.107 2.951 0.003\nAge 0.205 0.221 0.056 0.927 0.354\nGrade \u22120.489 0.308 \u22120.096 \u22121.587 0.113\nAnalysis 2 PHQ-9 \u22120.097 0.043 \u22120.085 \u22122.28 0.023 0.196 30.015 0\nPRM 0.197 0.019 0.386 10.359 0\nGender 1.446 0.484 0.109 2.988 0.003\nAge 0.187 0.222 0.051 0.84 0.401\nGrade \u22120.497 0.31 \u22120.098 \u22121.6 0.11\nGAD-7, Generalized Anxiety Scale; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire; PRM, Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire; ADOG, Academic Delay of Gratification Scale for College Students.\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\n(Gao et\u00a0al., 2020). Also, females performed better than males in online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown (Liu et\u00a0 al., 2021). Therefore, the changes in learning methods that were triggered by the COVID-19 lockdown were less likely to affect females than males (Hsiao, 2021). Bembenutty (2002b) reported that gender was a significant predictor of the ADOG of college students, with female students reporting higher levels of ADOG than their male counterparts. These conclusions are consistent with the results of this study.\nAnxiety and depression were negatively correlated with prospective and retrospective memory and academic delay of gratification\nThe path analysis further confirmed that GAD-7 and PHQ-9 had a effect on ADOG. One possible reason for this might be\u00a0that students with less anxiety and depression focused on learning, eliminating the interference of other external adverse factors, and were able to keep themselves in a balanced and stable psychological state. This was conducive for the improvement of the learning interest and efficiency. The students with severe anxiety and depression had decreased learning self-confidence, exhibited physical discomfort, inability to concentrate, weakened attention to learning and affected ADOG scores as well as worsened academic performance.\nThe path analysis of this study found that GAD-7 and PHQ-9 affected the ADOG scores through PRM. Previous studies have found that negative emotions such as anxiety and depression affected prospective memory performance (Harris and Cumming, 2003; Schnitzspahn et\u00a0al., 2014). Negative emotions hindered the development of the prospective memory, while positive emotions promoted the improvement of prospective memory performance (Harris and Menzies, 1999). Some study found that patients with depression had impairment of the prospective and retrospective memory (McFarland and Vasterling, 2018). The reason why anxiety and depression affected the prospective memory might be\u00a0 that the adverse emotions affected the allocation of cognitive resources. Individuals needed to increase the allocation of resources to process emotion-related information, to reduce the psychological resources used for the current task, thus affecting the performance of prospective memory (Xian et\u00a0al., 2020).\nTABLE\u00a05 Chain mediation analysis.\nModel Intermediary variable\nDependent variable\nPredictor variable\nR2 F \u03b2 t\nI GAD-7 and PRM GAD-7 Gender 0.009 5.283* \u22120.187 \u22122.298*\nPRM Gender 0.035 11.456** 0.181 2.239*\nGAD-7 \u22120.159 \u22124.006**\nADOG Gender 0.202 52.007** 0.21 2.846**\nGAD-7 \u22120.135 \u22123.707**\nPRM 0.381 10.389**\n2 PHQ-9 and PRM PHQ-9 Gender 0.013 7.989** \u22120.23 \u22122.826*\nPRM Gender 0.052 17.061** 0.163 2.037*\nADOG PHQ-9 \u22120.206 \u22125.209**\nGender 0.192 48.894** 0.214 2.874*\nPHQ-9 \u22120.092 \u22122.474*\nPRM 0.383 10.310**\nGAD-7, Generalized Anxiety Scale; PHQ-9, Patient Health Questionnaire; PRM, Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire; ADOG, Academic Delay of Gratification Scale for College Students. *p < 0.05\uff0c **p < 0.01.\nA\nB\nFIGURE\u00a01 Chain-mediation pathway diagram.

After receiving the memory task, the memory of plans is in the state of subliminal activation, which is extracted and put into action at a specific time. In this process, through cognitive monitoring, individuals perceive the passage of time, monitor the emergence of target clues, interrupt the interference task in time, and transfer their attention to the prospective memory task (Matos and Albuquerque, 2021). Prospective memory includes setting goals, clarifying the priority of goals, evaluating and monitoring the implementation of goals, and terminating inappropriate interference with goals in time (Bembenutty and Karabenick, 1998). Therefore, both PRM and prospective memory are related to self-control and self-regulation to achieve plans.\nProspective memory is an important cognitive activity closely related to people\u2019s daily lives. In recent years, with the continuous promotion and innovation of research methods, prospective memory has become a hot topic in the field of cognitive research (Im et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAlthough no studies have found that prospective memory directly affects ADOG, some studies have confirmed that prospective memory may affect ADOG in other ways. For example, episodic future thinking has been confirmed as an effective way to counter impulsive behavior and decisions by adding weights to delayed benefits (Peters and B\u00fcchel, 2010; Benoit et\u00a0al., 2011; Daniel et\u00a0al., 2013). Damage to the brain area that is responsible for episodic future thinking was found to affect the use of episodic future thinking in making more futureoriented decisions (Palombo et\u00a0al., 2015). Additionally, studies have found that future time insight is related to prospective memory and could predict the ability of ADOG, which supports the effect of prospective memory on ADOG (Yan, 2011).\nTherefore, combined with the results of the chain mediation analysis, we\u00a0speculate that the effect of gender on ADOG might have been caused by the anxiety and depression-induced impairment of prospective memory, which led to the reduction in ADOG.\nThe study results provide important information that can be\u00a0 applied to related theories and preventive interventions for improving ADOG in college students. First, this study raised awareness of the different mental health responses of male and female college students to the external environment. Since male\u2019s academic performance is more affected by environmental changes than female\u2019s, improving male\u2019s mental health could be\u00a0one way to reduce the learning gap between male and female. Second, this study also determined that the mental health level of college students is lower than that of ordinary adults. Therefore, it is suggested that schools should provide corresponding psychological counseling to help students to improve their mental health. This will help them to improve prospective memory and academic performance. Third, the results provide a theoretical basis for improving the ADOG level by increasing prospective memory. Cognitive control and prospective memory in complex dynamic environments require cognitive flexibility (Boag et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, improving cognitive flexibility can improve prospective memory and promote the ability to delay gratification (Koslov et\u00a0al., 2019). Whereas negative emotions such as anxiety and depression can reduce cognitive flexibility (Park and Moghaddam, 2017; Hsieh and Lin, 2019; Yu et\u00a0al., 2020), which leads to decreased prospective memory. Consequently, psychological treatment, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, can reduce anxiety and depression by improving psychological flexibility (Twohig and Levin, 2017). This provides a good way to improve prospective memory through psychotherapy.\nLimitations: First, as a cross-sectional correlation study, this study cannot determine the causal relationship, and subsequent experimental research is needed to further verify the hypothesis\nTABLE\u00a06 The 95% confidence interval of the mediating effect test and deviation corrections.\nEffect value 95% confidence interval Effect ratio (%)"
