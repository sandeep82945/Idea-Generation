L-Arginine, one of the most versatile amino acids, plays an important role in wound healing, organ maturation, and development. In this study, L-Arginine was found to enhance oral keratinocyte proliferation under high-glucose conditions. RNA sequencing analysis discovered a significant number of genes differentially upregulated following L-Arginine treatment under high-glucose conditions. Cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) was the most significantly upregulated gene at 24 and 48 h after L-Arginine treatment. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis found that cell proliferationand mitosis-related biological processes, such as mitotic nuclear division, mRNA processing, and positive regulation of cell cycle processes, were significantly upregulated. Pathway enrichment analysis found that S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) and serineand arginine-rich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) were the top upregulated genes in cell cycle and spliceosome pathways, respectively. Indirect immunofluorescent cytochemistry confirmed increased protein levels of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 after L-Arginine treatment. Knockdown of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 abolished the enhanced proliferative effect of L-Arginine on oral keratinocytes under high-glucose conditions. In conclusion, L-Arginine enhances oral keratinocyte proliferation under high-glucose conditions via upregulation of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5, suggesting that supplemental L-Arginine in oral care products may be beneficial for oral tissue repair",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus and its complications affect millions of people worldwide. The National Diabetes Statistics Report issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022 showed that, as of 2019, an estimated 37.3 million people of all ages (11.3% of the US population) had diabetes [1]. Moreover, the World Health Organization estimated that there were more than 400 million people in 2014 suffering from diabetes worldwide [2]. Diabetes has a severe impact on the physical and mental health of those affected and is a huge financial burden on societies. It is a major cause of kidney failure, heart attacks, peripheral artery disease, strokes, blindness, hyperglycemic crisis, neuropathy, retinopathy, chronic food ulcers, and limb amputation. In addition, diabetes delays oral wound healing in animal studies. For example, diabetes has been shown to cause delayed gingival\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7020. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28207020 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7020 2 of 16\nwound re-epithelialization, increased neutrophil infiltration, biofilm formation, reduced collagen formation, and myofibroblast differentiation [3]. Diabetes also inhibited collagen deposition, delayed wound healing, and increased alveolar destruction in tooth extraction wounds [4]. In a cheek mucosal wound model, diabetes led to delayed wound closure, prolonged inflammation with persistently high levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, decreased FGF2, decreased angiogenesis, and collagen deposition [5]. Furthermore, diabetes is closely associated with oral diseases such as periodontal disease, tooth loss, and increased oral fungal infection [6\u20138]. Our recent study demonstrates that high-glucose conditions inhibit oral keratinocyte proliferation and migration [9]. Since keratinocytes are the major cell component in the skin and oral epithelia, with keratinocyte proliferation being critical for re-epithelialization during wound closure [10,11], any strategies that are able to improve keratinocyte proliferation would be beneficial for wound healing, especially in diabetic patients. L-Arginine (Arg) is considered a nonessential amino acid, but it becomes conditionally essential during times of metabolic stress, such as during wound healing [12\u201316], organ maturation, and development [17,18]. The sources of Arg needed by the human body are either synthesized by organs such as the intestine, kidney, and liver or supplied from food or supplements. Arg is a precursor molecule involved in the synthesis of proteins and production of important biomolecules such as agmatine, citrulline, creatine, glutamate, nitric oxide (NO), polyamines, proline, putrescine, and urea via multiple pathways involving different enzymes, such as arginase type I/II, nitric oxide synthases, arginine decarboxylase, and arginine glycine amidinotransferase [15,19]. Furthermore, Arg regulates many cellular functions, especially proliferation [20]. Undeniably, Arg is one of the most versatile amino acids. In this study, Arg was found to promote oral keratinocyte proliferation under highglucose conditions. RNA sequencing demonstrated that Arg treatment induced significant transcriptomic changes in keratinocytes. In particular, cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1), S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), and serine- and argininerich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) were genes that were significantly upregulated, while several Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways, including cell proliferation and mitosis, were enriched. The inhibition of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 abolished the enhanced proliferation induced by Arg treatment."

The total number of cells determined by cell count in the Arg-treated group was found to be significantly higher than that in the untreated control (p < 0.05\u20130.01, Figure 1A,B) after 24 and 48 h. Arg treatment was also found to significantly enhance TIGK cell proliferation 72 and 120 h post-treatment as determined by an MTS proliferation assay (p < 0.01, Figure 1C). Similar results were obtained using 1 mM Arg. Therefore, 500 \u00b5M Arg was used in all of the following experiments. Arg (0.5\u20132 mM) was also shown to significantly enhance TIGK cell proliferation at low (normal) glucose conditions (6 mM) 72 and 96 h after treatment (Supplementary Materials Figure S1). Due to the clinical relevance to diabetes, the following studies were all performed under high-glucose conditions.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7020 3 of 16Molecules 2023, 28, 7020 3 of 16\nconditions, we further investigated if and to what extent Arg treatment alters the transcriptomics of TIGK cells by performing Poly (A) RNA sequencing at 24 and 48 h after Arg treatment. Differential gene expression analysis, as demonstrated in the volcano plots (Figure 2A), found 1367 and 1597 genes statistically upregulated (red dots) and downregulated (green dots), respectively, 24 h after Arg treatment as compared to the untreated control. There were 762 and 990 genes statistically upregulated and downregulated, respectively, 48 h after treatment as compared to the untreated control. Heat maps of the top 25 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including upregulated and downregulated genes, at 24 and 48 h after Arg treatment are shown in Figure 2B.

The data described above show that both gene and protein levels of these molecules were significantly elevated by treatment with Arg under high-glucose conditions. To assess the degree to which these genes affect these processes, TIGK cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting CYP1A1, SRSF5, or SKP2. The siRNA transfections successfully significantly inhibited mRNA expression of CYP1A1, SRSF5, and SKP2 compared to a scrambled siRNA control 48 h after transfection (p < 0.01, Figure 8A). There was no significance between the medium-only control and scrambled siRNA (p > 0.05, Figure 8A).

After 6 h, DermaLife K Keratinocyte Complete Medium with double concentrations of antibiotics and supplements was added. After 24 h, the medium was then switched to DMEM-SILAC Flex (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with the same supplements as in the DermaLife K Keratinocyte Complete Medium as well as with 48 mM D-glucose and 500 \u00b5M Arg. Cells from 12-well plates were harvested using TriZol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number: 15596026) for total RNA extraction. Cells in the 24-well plates were imaged and the number of cells under each field was counted to assess cell proliferation 48 h after transfection. An MTS assay was also performed in 96-well plates 72 and 120 h after transfection."

            "text": "Arg plays an important role in the proliferation of different cell types, such as lymphocytes [28], intestinal epithelial cells [29], endometrial epithelial cells [30], and fibroblasts [31]. The underlying mechanism is partly due to Arg metabolites such as polyamines and NO which are critical factors for cell proliferation [28,30,32\u201334]. Previous work has shown that a high-glucose environment impairs the migration and proliferation of cultured skin keratinocytes [35\u201338]. Our recent study has also shown that high glucose inhibits oral keratinocyte proliferation and migration, induces late keratinocyte differentiation, and causes cell death [9]. Given the pivotal roles of Arg in cell proliferation, we investigated if and how Arg regulated the proliferation of oral keratinocytes especially under high-glucose conditions. Our study here, for the first time, discovered that Arg enhances the proliferation of oral keratinocytes under both low- and high-glucose conditions. Due to the detrimental pathological effects of high glucose on oral keratinocytes [9] and its clinical relevance to diabetes, our studies were performed under high-glucose conditions. RNA sequencing analyses identified CYP1A1 as the top upregulated DEG at both 24 and 48 h after Arg treatment. CYP1A1 is a responsive gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligandactivated transcription factor. Downregulation of AhR or CYP1A1 prevents the cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to the S phase, which results in inhibition of the proliferation of human skin keratinocytes [39]. Pathway analysis showed that SKP2 was the top gene in the significantly upregulated cell cycle pathway. SKP2 is a nuclear protein and a member of the F-box family of ubiquitin\u2013protein ligase complexes. Cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and survival are closely related to SKP2 [40,41]. It promotes cell cycle entry into the S phase and regulates the stability of other cell cycle-related proteins. SKP2 is also considered an oncogene since SKP2 is found to be overexpressed in various cancer cells [40,41]. Pathway analysis also showed that SRSF5 was the top gene in the significantly upregulated spliceosome pathway. SRSF5, also known as SRp40 or HRS, is a member of the serine/arginine-rich protein (SR) family. SRSF5 is a nuclear protein and a part of the ribonucleoprotein complex of the spliceosome, which removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA and plays a critical role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing [42]. SRSF5 was reported to promote cell growth, especially in cancer cells, and is, therefore, also considered an oncogene [43\u201346]. Another member of the SR family, SRSF6, was found to promote skin hyperplasia [47]. We speculated that these three upregulated genes identified in the RNA sequencing analysis were in part responsible for the observed enhanced TIGK cell proliferation following Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions. Therefore, we used siRNAs specific to CYP1A1, SKP2, or SRSF5 to interfere with their expression and function. Our results show that siRNA targeting of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 significantly inhibits Arg-induced enhanced TIGK\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7020 13 of 16\ncell proliferation, which confirms that CYP1A1, SKP2, and SKP2 play pivotal roles in oral keratinocyte proliferation under high-glucose conditions. The mechanism by which Arg upregulates the expression of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 under high-glucose conditions remains unknown and warrants further studies. Arg supplementation has been shown to increase collagen deposition, wound breaking strength, and T lymphocyte function in acute human and rat skin wounds [19,48]. Arg-deficient animals had impaired wound healing, and decreased collagen deposition and wound breaking strength [14]. The data suggest that Arg improves wound healing and immune responses in animals and human patients under normal glucose conditions. Patients with oral or laryngeal cancer receiving supplements with Arg had significantly reduced fistula formation and length of post-operative stay [49,50]. Furthermore, Arg together with zinc oxide and zinc citrate protected the barrier integrity of gingival keratinocytes from TNF-\u03b1-induced damage and promoted keratinocyte proliferation and migration, which suggests that the combination offers benefits for oral health [51]. Arg is a unique substrate for NO synthesis [12,15]. NO is a critical factor that regulates vascular homeostasis, inflammation, and antimicrobial activity during the wound healing process [52] and has been shown to promote keratinocyte proliferation [32,34]. However, NO production is decreased in diabetic wounds, which partially contributes to the observed impaired wound healing in those affected with diabetes [53]. Supplemental Arg was found to restore previously decreased NO levels in diabetic wound fluid and wound breaking strength [16,54]. In an acute diabetic rat skin wound model, systemic application (gavaged) of Arg resulted in better wound healing and a higher expression of NO in wound fluid than topical application of Arg [55]. Furthermore, clinical studies have found that the use of Arg is beneficial for diabetic skin wound healing. One study showed that the majority of patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers who received a subcutaneous injection of Arg subsequently had those ulcers healed [56]. Another study showed that chronic diabetic foot ulcers in patients with hypoalbuminemia that received Arg supplementation healed better than non-Arg-supplemented controls [57]. These results suggest that Arg supplementation is beneficial for diabetic wound healing. Our current study shows that Arg treatment enhances oral keratinocyte proliferation under high-glucose conditions with CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 as significantly upregulated genes. Downregulation of any of those three genes ameliorated the pro-proliferation effects of Arg. It is currently unknown whether Arg treatment and the differential expression of CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 lead to the production of NO or other Arg metabolites. Whether this is responsible for the observed enhanced oral keratinocyte proliferation in this study requires further investigation. Based on the results of the current study, using Arg in oral care products may be a good strategy to improve oral health and prevent or promote oral wound healing in diabetic patients. Future clinical studies are warranted to prove this hypothesis. Studies using in vivo animal models of diabetic wound healing will also be needed to confirm the potential beneficial effects observed in our current in vitro study. In addition, future studies will also investigate some of the downregulated GO terms or genes after Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions. Taken together, Arg significantly enhances oral keratinocyte proliferation under highglucose conditions. The treatment leads to changes in a substantial number of gene transcripts related to cell cycle, cell proliferation, and spliceosome GO terms as well as signaling pathways. Among these top upregulated genes, CYP1A1, SKP2, and SRSF5 are of particular significance as they play important roles in the Arg-stimulated proliferation of oral keratinocytes. The results suggest that supplemental Arg in oral care products may be beneficial for oral tissue repair and regeneration especially under diabetic conditions.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28207020/s1, Figure S1: L-Arginine enhances oral keratinocyte proliferation under a low-glucose condition (6 mM); Figure S2: Top 20 downregulated enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (biological processes/BP, molecular functions/MF, and cellular components/CC) 24 h after Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions; Figure S3: Top 20 upregu-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7020 14 of 16\nlated and downregulated enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (biological processes/BP, molecular functions/MF, and cellular components/CC) 48 h after Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions; Figure S4: Significantly upregulated cell cycle pathway in enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 24 h after Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions; Figure S5: Significantly upregulated spliceosome pathway in enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 24 h after Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions; Figure S6: Significantly upregulated RNA transport in enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 24 h after Arg treatment under high-glucose conditions; Figure S7: Top 20 downregulated enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways 24 and 48 h after Arg treatment under highglucose conditions.
