    "abstractText": "Wheat stripe rust, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), seriously affects wheat production. Here, we report the complete genome sequence and biological characterization of a new mitovirus from P. striiformis strain GS-1, which was designated as \u201cPuccinia striiformis mitovirus 2\u201d (PsMV2). Genome sequence analysis showed that PsMV2 is 2658 nt in length with an AU-rich of 52.3% and comprises a single ORF of 2348 nt encoding an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PsMV2 is a new member of the genus Unuamitovirus within the family Mitoviridae. In addition, PsMV2 multiplied highly during Pst infection and it suppresses programmed cell death (PCD) triggered by Bax. Silencing of PsMV2 in Pst by barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated Host Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS) reduced fungal growth and decreased pathogenicity of Pst. These results indicate PsMV2 promotes host pathogenicity in Pst. Interestingly, PsMV2 was detected among a wide range of field isolates of Pst and may have coevolved with Pst in earlier times. Taken together, our results characterized a novel mitovirus PsMV2 in wheat stripe rust fungus, which promotes the virulence of its fungal host and wide distribution in Pst which may offer new strategies for disease control.",

            "text": "Mycoviruses (or fungal viruses) are widely present in all major taxa of plant pathogenic fungi [1,2], and persistently infect the host, which may play an important ecological role in nature [3]. Mycoviruses usually contain genomes of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), positivesense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA), negative-sense ssRNA (-ssRNA), rare ssDNA circular genomes, and RT-ssRNA genomes (https://talk.ictvonline.org/, accessed on 1 December 2022) [4]. Recently, with next-generation sequencing (NGS) development, an increasing number of mycoviruses have recently been characterized [5]. The discovery of novel mycoviruses expands our knowledge of virus taxonomy, ecology, and evolution [6,7]. Although a large number of mycoviruses are cryptic or asymptomatic, several mycoviruses causing apparent phenotypic alterations, including attenuation of fungal virulence (hypovirulence), is of particular interest for biocontrol purposes [7\u20139]. Thus far, the +ssRNA mycoviruses identified are mainly classified into nine families (Alphaflexiviridae, Barnaviridae, Botourmiaviridae, Deltafleiviridae, Endornaviridae, Gammaflexiviridae, Hypoviridae, Mitoviridae, and Narnaviridae) (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/, accessed on 1 December 2022) [10]. The best-known example of virus-mediated hypovirulence was that Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1) had been successfully used for the biological control of a devastating chestnut disease in Europe [9]. In addition, other mycovirus infections in pathogenic fungi have also been identified as promising resources for biological control [11\u201313].\nViruses 2023, 15, 1265. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15061265 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nViruses 2023, 15, 1265 2 of 16\nThe genus Mitovirus has been assigned to the newly established family Mitoviridae. Recent studies support that Mitovirdae is divided into at least four new genera: Unuamitovirus, Duamitovirus, Triamitovirus, and Kvaramtovirus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/ proposals/taxonomy_proposals_fungal1/m/fung04/13098, accessed on 12 November 2022). Viruses in the family Mitoviridae have non-encapsidated +ssRNA virus genomes, do not form any infectious virions and replicate in the mitochondria of host cells [14,15]. A typical mitovirus genome is 2.0 to 4.5 kb in length and contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and has six conserved amino acid motifs (I\u2013IV) [16,17]. The genome of mitoviruses with typical characteristics: 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of varying sizes [18]; using UGA codons to encode a tryptophan (Trp) rather than stop codon for translation termination; prefer to use stop codons of UAA and sometimes UAG [19,20]; the terminal sequences could fold into stable secondary genome structures which play a key role in replicating and genomes stability [21,22]. Mitoviruses are widespread among phytopathogenic fungi [23\u201325]. While some mitoviruses can lead to the hypovirulence of their fungal hosts [26], others have beneficial effects on virulence. For example, the Fusarium circinatum mitovirus 1 (FcMV1) can promote the pathogenicity of its host [27]. Mitoviruses may also provide key insights into the fundamental biology of virus-host interactions. Mitovirus-related sequences identified in plants can be integrated into the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes as DNA copies [26]. In Arabidopsis, such integration of mitovirus-related sequences may function as part of an RNA-mediated defense system [28]. Wheat stripe rust (yellow rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a worldwide airborne fungal disease that threatens the safety of wheat production [29\u201331]. Compared with the study of viruses in other fungi, an in-depth study of mycoviruses in rust fungus is limited. So far, seven novel mycoviruses have been identified from Pst, including Mitovirus, Narnavirus, and Totivirus, but their potential effects on their hosts still need to be investigated [32\u201335]. In this study, we report a novel mitovirus, Puccinia striiformis mitovirus 2 (PsMV2) from Pst, and ascertain its taxonomic status. Furthermore, we characterized the biological effect of mitovirus PsMV2 in wheat stripe rust, and PsMV2 plays a positive role in Pst virulence. This study not only expands our understanding of the origin, ecology, and evolution of mycoviruses, but also provides insight into the interactions among mycoviruses, fungal phytopathogens, and plant hosts."

Phylogenetic analyses of RdRp strongly supported the conclusion that PsMV2 represents a new member of the genus Unuamitovirus within the family Mitoviridae. In addition, PsMV2 can suppress programmed cell death (PCD) triggered by Bax. Using host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) to knockdown the expression of RdRp in PsMV2 leads to decreased virulence of Pst. These results demonstrate the positive effect of PsMV2 on Pst virulence. Moreover, we also found that PsMV2 is widely parasitic in rust fungus. This research expands our knowledge of the ecology and evolution of viruses in the family Mitoviridae and offers insights into the sustainable control of wheat rust disease. Viruses of the family Mitoviridae are +ssRNA viruses, encoding an RdRp protein, and the viruses exist as RNA-RdRp nucleoprotein complexes [14]. Mitoviruses essentially replicate within the mitochondria of their hosts [20]. Consequently, as with many fungal and plant mitochondrial genomes, mitoviruses share A-U richness [14]. In the mitovirus genome, the UGA codon encodes the aa tryptophan, not a stop codon as it does in the universal genetic code [20]. Our results show that the genome of PsMV2 does have a high proportion of A+U (52.3%) (Figure 1A). Another feature of mitovirus genomic RNA is the presence of stem-loop structures at both the 5\u2032 end and the 3\u2032 end, due to the presence of inverted complementary sequences at their termini [48], which is the situation for many mitoviruses found in various fungi, such as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi mitovirus 1, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum mitovirus 1, and Melanconiella theae mitovirus 1 [17,22,26]. These structures may play an important role in a number of aspects of mitovirus replication,\nViruses 2023, 15, 1265 13 of 16\nincluding the protection of naked ssRNA from degradation and as a recognition site for RdRp [48,54]. PsMV2 could be folded into potentially stable stem-loop structures (Figure 1B). The long-term co-evolution of mitoviruses and their fungal hosts would lead to important sequence differences in the mitovirus genome [48]. According to the phylogenetic tree, some mitoviruses isolated from different fungal species (e.g., PsMV2 and CrMV1) were relatively closely related in terms of phylogeny. The different mitoviruses may have evolved to exist prior to the differentiation of their fungal hosts. Studying mycovirus pathogenicity is important for a better understanding of the molecular biology of viruses [26,38,53]. Mycoviruses have different effects on fungi, ranging from inducing a cryptic state to increasing the capacity of the host to produce disease (hypervirulence) [27]. Although previously reported mitoviruses have little or no effects on their natural hosts, some mitoviruses are associated with hypovirulence to fungal hosts, making them a potential alternative method of biological control of plant diseases [55]. Pst is an obligate biotrophic fungus without a protoplast transformation system, making it difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of experimental materials from obligate host fungi, and it can cause asymptomatic infection. In fungi, RNA silencing (or RNA interference) is thought to serve primarily as a defense mechanism against invasive nucleic acids and viruses [56]. Antiviral RNA silencing is substantiated in fungi, e.g., Fusarium graminearum, Cryphonectria parasitica and Pyricularia oryzae [57\u201359]. In the present study, we used a BSMVHIGS approach to determine the role of PsMV2 in the wheat-Pst interaction. In the normal condition, it was found that PsMV2 infecting Pst race CYR31 (strain GS-1) underwent significant proliferation during the initial infection of wheat seedlings (Figure 3). On the other hand, when Pst race CYR31 (strain GS-1) invaded wheat seedlings in which RNA silencing against PsMV2 is activated using HIGS, it was revealed that the amount of PsMV2 infecting Pst decreased, and subsequently, the disease symptoms, fungal biomass, and mycelial dispersal by Pst decreased compared to the normal condition (Figure 5). These results suggested that PsMV2 is essential for the growth and development of Pst, which may be related to insufficient carbon and energy supply (Figure 6). In addition, we found that PsMV2 might be a parasitic mycovirus widespread in field Pst isolates (Figure 8 and Table S3) it is, therefore, possible that the gain of PsMV2 confers selective advantage (e.g., hypervirulence) and has been stabilized by Pst during evolution. In summary, PsMV2 is a novel +ssRNA mitovirus identified from the fungus Pst. PsMV2 plays a positive role in the virulence of Pst. The detection of PsMV2 in wheat rust fungus obtained from 10 different countries indicates that PsMV2 has a wide geographical distribution in Pst. Future research will be focused on generating PsMV2-RNAi transgenic material and exploring whether it has broad-spectrum disease resistance, thus providing a new strategy against rust pathogens in wheat.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15061265/s1, Table S1\u2014list of the oligonucleotide primers used in this study; Table S2\u2014sequence identities of PsMV2 to other viruses used for multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis; Table S3\u2014Similarity analysis of PsMV2 to other viruses used for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); Table S4\u2014RT-PCR detection of PsMV2 in 20 Pst samples collected in different regions in China (11 different provinces) and in 10 Pst samples from 10 other countries.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.Z., L.Z. and Z.K. designed the research.
