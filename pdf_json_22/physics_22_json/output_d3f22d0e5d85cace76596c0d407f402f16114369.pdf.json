    "abstractText": "Real-world systems interact with one another via dependency connectivities. Dependency connectivities make systems less robust because failures may spread iteratively among systems via dependency links. Most previous studies have assumed that two nodes connected by a dependency link are strongly dependent on each other; that is, if one node fails, its dependent partner would also immediately fail. However, in many real scenarios, nodes from different networks may be weakly dependent, and links may fail instead of nodes. How interdependent networks with weak dependency react to link failures remains unknown. In this paper, we build a model of fully interdependent networks with weak dependency and define a parameter \u03b1 in order to describe the node-coupling strength. If a node fails, its dependent partner has a probability of failing of 1\u2212 \u03b1. Then, we develop an analytical tool for analyzing the robustness of interdependent networks with weak dependency under link failures, with which we can accurately predict the system robustness when 1\u2212 p fractions of links are randomly removed. We find that as the node coupling strength increases, interdependent networks show a discontinuous phase transition when \u03b1 < \u03b1c and a continuous phase transition when \u03b1 > \u03b1c. Compared to site percolation with nodes being attacked, the crossover points \u03b1c are larger in the bond percolation with links being attacked. This finding can give us some suggestions for designing and protecting systems in which link failures can happen.",

            "text": "Many systems in the real world can be abstracted to nodes, and their relationships can be characterized as links, such as in computer network systems, power systems, transportation systems, etc. [1\u20133]. Network science has provided powerful tools [4,5] that help us understand the universal patterns of complex systems [6\u20138]. The robustness of networks is a key point to study because networks suffer from disturbances all the time [9\u201311]. The initial removal of nodes or links may also cause other nodes to lose their links and disconnect from the giant connected component. Scholars define the area under the robustness curve or the value of the percolation threshold, pc, as the measurement of robustness [12,13]. Increasing evidence shows that networks are coupled through dependency connectivities [3] and form interdependent networks or networks of networks [14\u201316]. Interdependency links make a system less robust, since the failures in one network could spread to another one via interdependency links [2,17\u201319]. Buldyrev et al. [10] built a model of fully interdependent networks and found that the interdependent networks showed a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition when a certain fraction of nodes were removed, which was different from the continuous (second-order) phase transitions in single networks [7,20]. A discontinuous phase transition can be used to explain how the Italian blackout in 2003 happened. Since then, plenty of follow-up studies have been carried out to study the\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1801. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24121801 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nrobustness of interdependent networks [14,15,21\u201323]. For example, Parshani et al. [23] studied the robustness of partially interdependent networks; Gao et al. [14,15] developed a general framework for analyzing the robustness in networks of networks; Liu et al. [24,25] developed a theoretical tool for analyzing the breakdown phenomena in interdependent directed networks. As reviewed above, couplings between networks have a great impact on system robustness [26\u201329]. Furthermore, different manners in the coupling between networks also bring different behaviors of systems in response to external failures. For example, the inter-similarity [30] or the degree correlations [19,31,32] between coupled networks could improve a system\u2019s robustness. Most of the related studies assume that a dependency link implies a strong dependency relation between nodes, that is, if one node fails, its dependent partner will also immediately fail. However, in reality, networks may be weakly dependent, i.e., a node may survive even if its dependent partner fails in some cases. Liu et al. [33] introduced the concept of weak dependency and defined a parameter \u03b1 as the node-coupling strength. If one node fails, its dependent partner would have a probability of failing of 1\u2212 \u03b1. The parameter \u03b1 can be tuned from zero to one. If \u03b1 = 0, it describes the strongly dependent case, and if \u03b1 = 1, the networks are isolated from one another. Otherwise, the nodes from two networks are weakly dependent. In addition, there may be different forms of failure. Most of the studies mentioned above focused on site percolation in which failures are injected into nodes. However, in reality, link failures are common, such as in the breakdown of wires of power grids and the cutting off of traffic [17,34\u201336]. The frameworks developed for site percolation cannot be used to describe the bond percolation case, in which the initial failures are link failures. To study bond percolation, Chen. et al. [37] developed an analytical tool for calculating the percolation thresholds of interdependent networks under link failures and found that the percolation threshold pc was smaller in the case of bond percolation compared to that in the case of site percolation. However, how weakly interdependent networks behave in response to link failures remains unknown. To fill this gap, we built a weakly interdependent network model and developed an analytical tool for studying how the system reacted to initial link failures. By applying the analytical tool to Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks and scale-free (SF) networks, we found that the tool could accurately predict the final giant connected component sizes of the model after randomly removing a certain fraction of the links. Furthermore, we calculated the critical percolation thresholds, pc, and the crossover points, \u03b1c, in order to measure the robustness of the two coupled networks and found that compared to site percolation, the crossover points \u03b1c were larger in the case of bond percolation with links being attacked. These results can help in the understanding of system robustness and enable better design of robust systems."

            "text": "The model consists of two networks, A and B, with the same number of nodes N. We use the joint degree distribution PA(k) and PB(k) to describe their features, where k is the degree of a given node and P(k) is the probability of finding that node in the network. For simplicity and without loss of generality, networks A and B fully depend on each other. All nodes in the two networks depend on a corresponding node according to the no-feedback principle, that is, if node ai in network A has a dependency node bj in network B and bj has a dependency node al in network A, then l = i. In the beginning, we remove a fraction of 1\u2212 p links in network A. If a node loses all of its links, it fails. If a node fails in network A, all of the links of its dependency node in network B have a probability of failing of 1\u2212 \u03b1. The nodes that fail in network B have the same effect on network A. This process continues until the two networks reach stability. A schematic illustration of cascading failure in interdependent networks is shown in Figure 1. Intuitively speaking, the parameter \u03b1 represents the self-healing capacity of the nodes. \u03b1 is in the range of 0 and 1. When \u03b1 is equal to 0, the networks are strongly coupled, and when\n\u03b1 is equal to 1, the failures cannot spread, and the two networks are independent. Note that we only remove links from one network to stress the effect of weak dependency, and the two networks\u2019 final states are different. Unlike in the mechanisms of spread that were used previously, the failures propagate from links to links.\nThus, the connection links spread the failures in one network, and the dependency links spread the failures between the networks. The networks break into fragments. As mentioned above, only nodes in the giant connected components (GCCs) function well. After working out the framework, we need to find out the relative size of the GCCs through simulation and calculation. The values of the percolation thresholds are used to describe the robustness of the networks as well."

            "text": "By using the self-consistent equations [38,39], we can calculate the size of the GCC after an initial random attack and cascading failures. Firstly, we define two probability variables (x,P\u221e) in order to solve the single-layer model. Suppose that there exists a network A whose size goes to infinity. Let x be the probability that by following an arbitrary direction, a randomly selected link in network A leads to the GCC. The degree distribution of A can be expressed using the following generating function:\nGA0 (x) = \u2211 k PA(k)xk (1)\nwhere PA(k) is the probability of finding a node with k links in A. The underlying branching process of network A is represented by:\nGA1 (x) = \u2211 k PA(k) \u00b7 k \u3008k\u3009A xk\u22121 (2)\nwhere \u3008k\u3009A is the average degree of network A and PA(k)k/\u3008k\u3009A is the probability of following a link to find a node with degree k. From the above definition, we know that (1\u2212 x) is the probability that a randomly selected link does not lead to the GCC. Then, (1\u2212 x)k\u22121 is the probability that all of the k\u2212 1 links of the node do not lead to the GCC, and 1\u2212 (1\u2212 x)k\u22121 is the probability that at least one link leads to the GCC of that node. Thus, we construct the self-consistent equation of x:\nx = \u2211 k\nPA(k) \u00b7 k \u3008k\u3009A [1\u2212 (1\u2212 x)k\u22121] = 1\u2212 GA1 (1\u2212 x) (3)\nWe define P\u221eA as the probability that a randomly selected node belongs to the GCC. From the definition, we know that this is also the relative size of the GCC. This means that at least one of its links must lead to the GCC. Thus, we get the following self-consistent equation:\nP\u221eA = \u2211 k PA(k)[1\u2212 (1\u2212 x)k] = 1\u2212 GA0 (1\u2212 x) (4)\nwhere (1\u2212 x)k means that a node\u2019s k links all fail. An initial link attack means that we need to randomly remove a fraction of 1\u2212 p links in network A. Thus, only a fraction of p links will remain. Based on Equation (3), aside from the original probability x, the probability of a randomly selected link remaining needs to be multiplied by p. For any given p, we can solve Equation (5) to get x and substitute it into Equation (4) to get the final size of the GCC:\nx = \u2211 k\np \u00b7 PA(k)k \u3008k\u3009A [1\u2212 (1\u2212 x)k\u22121] = p \u00b7 [1\u2212 GA1 (1\u2212 x)] (5)\nWith the fundamentals of the single-layer model, we convert into a fully interdependent two-layer model. GB0 (y) = \u2211k PB(k)y k and GB1 (y) = \u2211k PB(k)y k\u22121/\u3008k\u3009B represent the generating function and the underlying branching process of network B, respectively. We randomly attack a fraction of 1\u2212 p links in network A; when the system reaches the steady state, the self-consistent equation is as follows:\nx = p \u00b7 [1\u2212 GA1 (1\u2212 x)] \u00b7 [1\u2212 GB0 (1\u2212 y)] + \u03b1 \u00b7 p \u00b7 [1\u2212 GA1 (1\u2212 \u03b1x)] \u00b7 GB0 (1\u2212 y) (6)\nThere are two terms on the right-hand side of the equation. We divide the two terms into three parts. Every part is a step in calculating the result of the two-layer model for the first term :\n1. p is the fraction of links remaining in network A after the initial failure. 2. 1\u2212 GA1 (1\u2212 x) is the probability that the end node of the remaining links leads to the GCC of network A. 3. 1\u2212 GB0 (1\u2212 y) is the probability that the dependency nodes of the surviving nodes in\nnetwork A of network B belong to the GCC of network B.\nNote that in the steady state, networks A and B have discrepant sizes because the coupling strength parameter prevents symmetrical initial destruction. In the second term of the right-hand side of Equation (6), the third part represents the fraction of failing nodes in network B, but their dependency nodes in network A have the probability \u03b1 of surviving due to the node-coupling strength parameter. Thus, we need to multiply \u03b1 to represent the decreasing survival probability of their dependency nodes. Then, we add the two terms to get a self-consistent equation. Similarly to the inference above, we can get the self-consistent equation of y; the difference is that the failing of network B happens because of the spread of network A\u2019s destruction, and the fraction of remaining links is 1, so we omit it in the following equation:\ny = [1\u2212 GB1 (1\u2212 y)] \u00b7 [1\u2212 GA0 (1\u2212 x)] + \u03b1 \u00b7 [1\u2212 GB1 (1\u2212 \u03b1y)] \u00b7 GA0 (1\u2212 x) (7)\nFor any given p, by substituting the results of x and y into the following formulas, we can get the relative sizes of networks A and B in the final state:\nP\u221eA = [1\u2212 GA0 (1\u2212 x)] \u00b7 [1\u2212 GB0 (1\u2212 y)] + [1\u2212 GA0 (1\u2212 \u03b1x)] \u00b7 GB0 (1\u2212 y) (8)\nP\u221eB = [1\u2212 GB0 (1\u2212 y)] \u00b7 [1\u2212 GA0 (1\u2212 x)] + [1\u2212 GB0 (1\u2212 \u03b1y)] \u00b7 GA0 (1\u2212 x) (9)\nBecause we did not remove nodes, the initial survival probability of the nodes is 1. The surviving nodes are divided into two parts: The dependency nodes of one survived and the other\u2019s dependency nodes failed. For the first part, they are strictly limited by the two networks\u2019 survival probabilities. The nodes in the second part survived because of the coupling strength parameter \u03b1, although their dependency nodes failed. The survival probability of the nodes in network A or B is added to the two terms."

We also obtained experimental results through a simulation and present them as symbols. This shows that the theoretical predictions were accurate. With the growth of \u03b1, the system became more robust. On the one hand, the area under the percolation curves became larger. On the other hand, the critical percolation transition points pc became smaller. Furthermore, we observed that there was a critical point \u03b1c at which the transition form changed from a first-order transition to a second-order transition. The size of network A\u2019s GCC jumped from 0 to a finite value when \u03b1 = 0.5, but it changed continuously to a negative value when \u03b1 = 0.6.

We obtained x and y through a dichotomy and substituted them into Equations (12) and (13) to get P\u221eA and P \u221e B . As shown in Figures 2 and 3, when the remaining fraction of links crossed over a value pc, a GCC emerged. In this section, we first calculate the value of the percolation thresholds pc. Then, we calculate the crossover points that divide the first-order phase transition and the second-order phase transition."

In panels (a) and (b) of the figure, the pc values for bond percolation are represented by solid lines, while the pc values for site percolation are represented by dashed lines. The percolation thresholds for site percolation are larger, and we assume that the robustness of bond percolation is better. We also validated our predictions by comparing the robustness curves. In panels (c) and (d) of the figure, the area under the robustness curves of bond percolation is larger with the same \u03b1, which means that the networks are more robust to bond failures."

            "text": "In order to find the critical point \u03b1c, we observe the graphical solutions of Equations (10) and (11). Equation (11) is not affected by p, since we do not initially destroy network B. In Figure 5, we present Equations (10) and (11) on the x, y plane and set \u03b1 = 0.3 and \u3008kA\u3009 = \u3008kB\u3009 = 4. If the two curves have an intersection aside from the trivial solution x = y = 0, the positive solutions make P\u221eA > 0 and P \u221e B > 0. By adjusting the parameter p, Equation (10) moves from the left to the right of the plane. When p is equal to pc = 0.3919, the two curves have a tangent point, which means that the value of P\u221eA jumps from 0 to a nonzero value and the phase transition is discontinuous. However, when \u03b1 = 0.7, the model undergoes a continuous phase transition, and the solution is unique when p is given. With decreasing p, the solutions of Equation (10) decrease continuously to 0 and dxdy \u00b7 dy dx 6= 1 when p = pc because the two lines cannot have a tangent. The differences between the two conditions are shown in Figure 5. Thus, we can decide on the kind of phase transition by finding the critical point pc and obtaining the relevant solutions of x, y to verify the whether dxdy \u00b7 dy dx = 1:\ndx dy = pGB \u2032 0 (1\u2212 y) \u00b7 [1\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 GA1 (1\u2212 x) + \u03b1GA1 (1\u2212 \u03b1x)]\n1\u2212 pGA\u20321 (1\u2212 x)[1\u2212 GB0 (1\u2212 y)]\u2212 \u03b12 pGA \u2032 1 (1\u2212 \u03b1x)GB0 (1\u2212 y) (18)\ndy dx = GA \u2032 0 (1\u2212 x) \u00b7 [1\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 GB1 (1\u2212 y) + \u03b1GB1 (1\u2212 \u03b1y)]\n1\u2212 GB\u20321 (1\u2212 y)[1\u2212 GA0 (1\u2212 x)]\u2212 \u03b12GB \u2032 1 (1\u2212 \u03b1y)GA0 (1\u2212 x) (19)\nWe took 20 values evenly spaced between 0 and 1 to find the intervals of \u03b1c, whose left endpoint was a first-order transition and whose right endpoint was a second-order transition. Through dichotomy, we found the values of \u03b1c of ER networks with different average degrees \u3008k\u3009 and SF networks with different minimum degrees kmin. We marked the results on the corresponding lines. With the increase in \u03b1, pc decreased from the value of a strong coupling model to a single-layer model. When \u03b1 was close to \u03b1c, the changes in pc were more drastic. After going across \u03b1c, pI Ic gently decreased. Networks that had larger percolation thresholds also had larger crossover points, as shown in Figure 4. However, the crossover points for site percolation were smaller than those for bond percolation, while the percolation thresholds were larger, as shown in Table 1. Thus, the crossover points cannot become the measurement of robustness. Moreover, this phenomenon suggests that link failure is more likely to lead to collapses of the networks even though they are more robust than those in site percolation. Because removing links seems to reserve nodes in networks, the average degree actually decreases. This makes the networks fragile, and a small disturbance can thoroughly destroy the system."

            "heading": "5. Conclusion",
            "text": "In this paper, we applied a weakly coupled mechanism to interdependent networks based on bond percolation. In the framework that we constructed, sites only played the role of a medium. The coupling strength parameter \u03b1 controlled the spreading strength of the dependency nodes\u2019 failure. When \u03b1 < \u03b1c, the coupling strength was strong, and with the increase in \u03b1, pc decreased faster than when \u03b1 > \u03b1c with the growth of \u03b1. That is to say, after going through the crossover point \u03b1c, the system was always robust. Interestingly, we know that the sizes of the GCCs were bigger and the values of the percolation thresholds were smaller for bond percolation than those for site percolation. For the crossover points, \u03b1c was greater, which means that the case in bond percolation was easier to break down. This is because when we remove a fraction of the links, the average degree decreases, and the networks become less robust. Thus, we need to improve the self-protection ability for cases in which interdependent networks\u2019 edges are continuously attacked, such as in the breakdown of business relationships. Moreover, since attacks on links and nodes lead to\ndifferent results, we need to make an effort to study the relationship between links and nodes.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.Q.; methodology, Y.Q.; investigation, X.L. and L.P.; resources, X.L. and L.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.Q.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.Q. and X.L.; supervision, X.L. and L.P.; project administration, X.L.; funding acquisition, X.L.
