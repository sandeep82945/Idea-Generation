 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the trajectories of other domain-specific types of satisfaction (e.g. family, friend, academic satisfaction) during adolescence to gain a more detailed bottom-up perspective on the development of life satisfaction. 

2. Investigate the association between different dimensions of the school environment (e.g. teacher support, peer relations, school facilities) and subjective well-being to understand which aspects may contribute to declines in well-being during secondary school.

3. Conduct studies on the effects of within-school or course-by-course tracking on subjective well-being to determine if less rigid ability grouping practices are associated with different well-being trajectories. 

4. Examine subjective well-being development and associations with school contexts in upper secondary school to see if increasing patterns emerge in later adolescence.

5. Use class-level achievement composition rather than school-level to provide a stronger test of the Big-Fish-Little-Pond effect on the development of domain-specific well-being like school satisfaction.
