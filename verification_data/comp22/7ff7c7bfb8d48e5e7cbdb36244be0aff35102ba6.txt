"The study has also revealed that students use their own data, but this was supplemented by the University. In the context, internet was accessed through two different means; the institution-wide Wi-Fi and data bundle purchased by students themselves. The implication is that students incur further costs in purchasing internet bundle data. The authors advocate that the University may have to expand its Wifi so students would not have to bear the cost of buying data for access."

"Enrolling students on the platform should be a whole university-wide or systemic programme and should not be left in the hands of individual students to decide whether or not they will migrate to the platform. Training of the Institutionâ€™s instructors to equip them with ICT skills to be able to mount courses, run and manage them on the LMS also become imperative."

"The study has also shown that mobile learning exists in a somewhat structured form but is not fully harnessed in the University; it seems an unintended consequence of the attempt to provide e-learning (the parent ICT learning mode to mobile learning). As evident, there is a need for a policy to drive the system to make it a fully compliant mobile learning educational environment."
