    "abstractText": "For efficient processing, spatiotemporal spike patterns representing similar input must be able to transform into a less similar output. A new computational model with physiologically plausible parameters shows how the neuronal process referred to as \u201cpattern separation\u201d can be very well achieved by single neurons if the temporal qualities of the output patterns are considered. Spike patterns generated by a varying number of neurons firing with fixed different frequencies within a gamma range are used as input. The temporal and spatial summation of dendritic input combined with theta-oscillating excitability in the output neuron by subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMOs) lead to high temporal separation by different delays of output spikes of similar input patterns. A Winner Takes All (WTA) mechanism with backward inhibition suffices to transform the spatial overlap of input patterns to much less temporal overlap of the output patterns. The conversion of spatial patterns input into an output with differently delayed spikes enables high separation effects. Incomplete random connectivity spreads the times up to the first spike across a spatially expanded ensemble of output neurons. With the expansion, random connectivity becomes the spatial distribution mechanism of temporal features. Additionally, a \u201csynfire chain\u201d circuit is proposed to reconvert temporal differences into spatial ones.",

The neuro-computational function thought to underlie this ability is referred to as \u201cpattern separation.\u201d It is defined as the process by which similar neuronal input is converted into a less similar output that represents the input. Indeed sometimes the pattern separation gained popularity as a research topic (Drew, 2010; Leal and Yassa, 2018), however, up to date it has been studied almost exclusively on the bases of spatial patterns. Many functional and structural neural circuit mechanisms have been found, each of which contributes to the spatial pattern separation. Expansion recoding, sparse synaptic connectivity to the output neurons, and Winner Takes All (WTA) competition through inhibition have so far mainly been considered as relevant mechanisms for spatial pattern separation: Marr (1971), O\u2019Reilly and McClelland (1994), Chistiakova and Volgushev (2009), Aimone et al. (2011), Yassa and Stark (2012), Rolls (2012, 2013, 2016), Cayco-Gajic and Silver (2019), and Sakon and Suzuki (2019) as review.\nSpatial or/and Temporal Separation Given the spatiotemporal characteristics of most physical stimuli, sensory information is encoded both spatially and temporally. Temporal precision seems to be critical for the accurate\nFrontiers in Computational Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 858353\nrepresentation of physical sensory stimuli, which at least is shown by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Therefore, we now focus on differences in the temporal properties of processed patterns, especially on the delays of neuronal answers to input patterns as a kind of temporal coding.\nThe explicit application of temporal coding to the models of pattern separation has rarely been done, although much evidence has been reported that temporal coding is useful for pattern separation. The local properties of activated neurons (spatial coding) or frequency changes (rate coding) up to date are mainly used as criteria for the separation of patterns.\nIn fact, there is growing evidence for temporal encoding strategies in neural networks. Indeed, there is an increasing evidence of their direct involvement in separation processes. Thus, Lisman and Jensen (2013) directly relate to the pattern separation by spiking breaks produced by gamma frequency arrest. They assume that different spatial information is represented in different gamma subcycles of a theta cycle.\nPern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas (2014) suggest that rate coding schemes in dentate gyrus granule cells, which are ascribed to pattern separation, would be inadequate compared with temporal coding schemes. Their results are consistent with the idea that a temporal coding scheme is used in dentate gyrus granule cells.\nMadar et al. (2019) provided the first experimental evidence of temporal coding strategies for pattern separation in the hippocampus. Examining the temporal properties of input and output patterns rather than differences in firing rates or firing locations, the authors showed that the suprathreshold responses of some gyrus cells were highly decorrelated compared with their inputs. The authors presented different ways to measure the similarity between spike trains and suggested that pattern separation could be achieved by multiplexed neural codes.\nOur model uses spike patterns as input, generated by different numbers of neurons firing at different high gamma frequencies. Input similarity is measured by spatial overlap. As an output, we measure both the temporal and spatial properties of patterns in the output. We propose that the separation is primarily made by time to first output spike. This temporal property arises in each individual output-neuron and is used as the basis for the separation processes. Only in a further step is the temporal code extended by a spatial code through expansion recoding or by synfire chain.\nIn essence, our model shows that temporal encoding by time-delays to the first spike allows the individual output neurons to differentiate their input, especially when this process is assisted by rising subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMOs). We propose that the first step in separating spatially overlapping input patterns is achieved through temporal encoding: depending on the spatiotemporal input and the theta phase of SMOs, output neurons will fire sooner or later. Only through a second mechanism, the temporal properties of activated neurons extended by a spatial code, namely, through expansion recoding and sparse connectivity in combination with a competing inhibition process.\nAs an additional option for the interaction between temporal and spatial properties of patterns, a neural mechanism is\nused to convert temporal differences into spatial ones using a simple synfire chain model (Abeles, 1982; Ikegaya et al., 2004; Hosaka et al., 2008; Larson et al., 2010). Such models suggest a succession of end-to-end excitatory neurons (neuronal chain). An input spike propagates along the chain of neurons with synaptic delays."

(2019) also examined how the input-output transformation of multiple hippocampal cell types works in the terms of pattern separation. The assignment of pattern separation to the dentate gyrus should also apply to temporal properties. The results of Pern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas (2014) agree with this idea because dentate granule cells use a temporal coding scheme. Braganza et al. (2020) point out that in addition to the feedback, inhibition sparsity and temporal oscillations in the dentate gyrus have a critical influence on a proposed pattern separation function. However, it should be noted that pattern separation is not unique to this area of the brain. Similar phenomena also manifest in other neural circuits, e.g., the cerebellar cortex and insect mushroom body. However, recent studies from human single-neuron recordings have suggested that there may be no pattern separation in the human hippocampus (Quiroga, 2020). Others insist that experimental evidence does not rule out pattern separation in the hippocampus (Rolls, 2021; Suthana et al., 2021)."

It consists of 3 neuronal ensembles: the input neurons (Ineurons), the representation neurons (R-neurons), and the time to space extension neurons (E-neurons), each accomplishing a specific task (Figure 1). Beside the input function of the ensemble of I-neurons (as shown in section \u201cSummation in R-Neurons\u201d), the other two ensembles solve the following tasks: spatial and temporal separation as key part of the ensemble of R-neurons and time to space transformation as an additional option of the ensemble of E-neurons. Separation is generated between I-neurons and R-neurons, extension from time to space (temporal parameters are complemented by spatial parameters) is generated between R-neurons and E-neurons.\nThe random connectivity between I-neurons and R-neurons is organized as follows: eight I-neurons have excitatory synapses with every six dendrites of 1\u2013128 R-neurons, representing an expansion factor (EF) of 0.125\u201316. Each of the dendritic branches of R-neurons is connected by 3 synapses from I-neurons. The connections of the single dendritic branches are diluted, i.e., they receive input only from 3 to 6 I-neurons, not of all. For example, as shown in Figure 8.\nFrontiers in Computational Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 858353\nFIGURE 1 | Model of spatiotemporal separation with 3 neuronal ensembles: I-neurons (I), R-neurons (R), and E-neurons (E). In total, 8 I-neurons are randomly connected to a varied number of R-neurons generating separation (Figure 8). R-neurons are fully connected to the global inhibitory neuron Ih that is reconnected to all R-neurons. R-neurons are fully connected to E-neurons, generating time to space transformation by the help of ET-neurons as \u201csynfire wave.\u201d The activation of ET-neurons is initiated by the T-neuron (T). The activation of the first ET-neuron (ET) is propagated to the neighboring ET-neuron. Spiking ET-neurons activate the parallel E-neurons where times of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) \u201ctravel\u201d from one neuron to the next.\nFor simulations, 3\u20136 of 8 I-neurons propagate high-gamma aligned spike trains to the 6 dendritic branches of 1\u2013128 R-neurons. A total of 3 synapses are formed per branch. This results in 18 synapses per R-neuron from 8 randomly selected I-neurons. So first, we are using a dense connectivity of average 2.25 connections per I-neuron. Additionally, we investigate the separation effects if sparse connectivity is applied. For sparse connectivity, 3\u20136 of 8 I-neurons propagate the spike trains to the 6 dendritic branches of R-neurons but only one synapse is formed per branch. This results in only 6 synapses per R-neuron form 8 randomly selected I-neurons, a sparse connectivity of average 0.75 connections per I-neuron a third of the former dense connectivity."

Thus the frequencies between I-neurons differ by an integer multiple of 1.1 Hz. It is assumed that activated I-neurons start to fire at the same time shortly before the start of the separation process. Therefore, the first input time of a single I-neuron corresponds to ISI of its spiking frequency. The spatial positions of activated I-neurons define the spatial input overlap and determine the similarity of the input patterns (SI).\nRandom connectivity implies that R-neurons are activated by different strength and at different times by I-neurons. For the sake of simplicity, synaptic weights from I-neurons to R-neurons are assumed to be equal (at the value of 0.4). The excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are generated by Formula (5) and sub linearly added by Formula (6) in the same branch. EPSPs of all dendritic branches are linearly added by their way to the soma but weakened by a passive decay factor of Upass = 0.5. The summation processes of EPSPs plays a role for the separation as they integrate the temporal and spatial input and diversify the point in time at which the somatic spiking threshold is exceeded.\nThe spikes of I-neurons require a constant time of 1 ms for the propagation to the dendrites of R-neurons. Delays from the branches of R-neurons to the soma depend on their location meaning the spatial distance of the branches from the soma. The delays vary from 2 to 16 ms. Branch 1 spikes are delayed by 2 ms, branch 2 are delayed by 4 ms, and so on. Varying delays modify the time of somatic spikes in relation to the specific combination of activated dendritic branches.\nThe level of activation of an individual R-neuron depends on the input from combined EPSPs from I-neurons. The input to R-neurons is modified individually by the existing random connections of active I-neurons. The activation of R-neurons is a result of spatial and temporal summation EPSPs. The spatial summation within a single branch is sub-linear and processed by Formula 6. This sub-linear summation allows a larger number of activated I-neurons (3\u20136) to be used. The more EPSPs and the faster the somatic membrane potential rises, the earlier an action potential is generated by exceeding the spiking threshold.\nThe different connectivity of R-neurons leads to earlier or later spikes in the individual R-neurons. If the neuron that fires the earliest best represents the input, then the selection of this neuron is not only a temporal but also a spatial characteristic of the output. The temporal separation is supplemented by a spatial separation if several R-neurons with different connections from the input are present in the output level."

The descending phase of a 5 Hz-SMO begins 50 ms later and the lowest excitability is at the time of 150 ms. The excitability reaches the initial level at 200 ms. Then, the excitability increases for another 50 ms. During the input presentation, the temporal and spatial summation of EPSPs on R-neurons is supplemented by the increasing excitability. Even if the input is small growing excitability will generate a spike at the latest on the peak of SMO. In this way, SMOs increase the range of input power that can create a spike.

Therefore, hsLTD works like an \u201cimmunization\u201d of the present winner neuron against further gains.

For temporal separation without additional spatial separation, the question arises as to how the temporal precision of spike times (as generated by R-neurons) can be used for the succeeding processes. In our model an extension from temporal to spatial separation is implemented by the ensemble of E-neurons (Figure 6) as a simple synfire chain. The sequences of ET-neurons connected by feedforward connections spread EPSPs. In addition, each ET-neuron is connected to a single parallel E-neuron. The arriving spikes from the ET-neurons enhance the subthreshold membrane potential of the parallel E-neuron. Thus, an EPSP spreads like a wave from one E-neuron to the next. Since spikes in the ET-neurons are temporally ordered according to their sequence, this ordering is transmitted to E-neurons as traveling subthreshold EPSPs. The input into E-neurons from R-neurons alone as well as the input of ET-neurons only produces subliminal excitation in subthreshold excitation, but the combination of both produces a spike. After generating a spike in R-neurons, a\nspike is generated in the time-specific E-neuron as it coincides with an EPSP from an ET-neuron. The time course of EPSPs in an E-neuron is simulated by Formula 5. The synaptic weights are conveniently chosen at the value of 5.8 between ET-neurons (to be suprathreshold) and between R-neurons and E-neurons at the value of 2.0.

Complete connectivity is implemented by linking the 3 dendritic branches of a single R-neuron through all 8 I-neurons. We then examined whether partially random connectivity from I-neurons to R-neurons is essential for temporal separation. SP is calculated in the same way as previous simulations. Full connectivity as well as incomplete random connectivity result in the same temporal SP = 93%.

The transformation of spiking times of the R-neurons into spatially different E-neurons is accomplished with the help of a \u201csynfire wave.\u201d\nThe first result: input reliability is perfect. Approximately 100% of repetitions are represented by equal output times of R-neurons and equal E-neurons.\nThe second result: the average number of different spike times for 18 different objects is 14. This means that 78% of the different objects are represented by different output times (and subsequently also by different E-neurons). It should be noted that 77% of correct object identification is generated without any learning mechanisms and is based on the spiking times of a single R-neuron. While the spatial overlap of the 18 different input objects is 35% and the spatial overlap of the output patterns of a single R-neuron numbers only to 3.6%. Therefore, similar to previous results the mean temporal SP is 90%."

Therefore, the temporal or spatial overlap within the output patterns is measured relative to the spatial overlap within the input patterns generated by a varying number of differently firing neurons. The comparison of the two measurements shows that spatial separation has additional requirements. \u2022 The spatial SP increases with EF and only reaches more than\n90% at EF = > 8. The temporal measurement even to this SP level can be reached with the help of a single R-neuron. This corresponds to EF of 0.125. In addition, spatial SP requires random connectivity and cannot be produced with full connectivity. \u2022 Sparse connectivity reduces temporal but not spatial SP. \u2022 The number of activated I-neurons and their frequencies\naffect the output times of R-neurons. These input parameters show up in our model as significant influences for the temporal separation. \u2022 Objects represented by the combination of activated\nI-neurons can be separated via the temporal output of a single neuron. The temporal separation can then be expanded to include a spatial dimension. The temporal overlap of a single R-neuron and the spatial overlap of E-neurons is reduced by about 90% compared with the spatial overlap of I-neurons. Repeated presentations of the same objects always activate the same R-neuron. In total, 18 different objects were used to activate on average 14 different E-neurons.

            "text": "The presented model establishes a new way to study the separation process of patterns by distinguishing temporal and spatial aspects. It turns out that times to the first output spike allow for high separation even in the absence of expansion and\neven within a single neuron. As shown in Figure 4, the temporal SP comes to more than 90% and is independent of the number of participating R-neurons. This high temporal separability of a single neuron is energy-saving and is able to be present at many circuits where somatic SMOs and summation across dendrites exist. The input-output transformation of our model does not depend on synaptic modification. The different numbers of activated I-neurons, different frequencies of I-neurons, and different delays in propagation of EPSPs from dendritic branches to the soma seem to create the temporal separation force. The separation is processed in conjunction with theta SMOs in the R neurons and a temporal WTA network mechanism. We offer time to the first spike as a crucial aspect of the temporal code relevant to pattern separation. Madar et al. (2019) suggested that separation can be realized by varying the temporal characteristics of output spike trains as spike times, the firing rate, the number of bursts, and the number of spikes in a burst.\nSeparation processes in the brain are not localized to a specific region (Cayco-Gajic and Silver, 2019). Separation processes\nFrontiers in Computational Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 858353\npresumably take place in all sensory channels and also on the different levels of processing. Our model is simplified to best represent an exemplary separation process with its temporal and spatial aspects.\nThe following neuronal mechanisms applied by our model are physiologically plausible even if they have not yet been directly investigated in relation to pattern separation in the presented combination.\n\u2022 Winner Takes All-mechanism of a time-based competition, WTA-networks are often used in computational models. The WTA-computation is an intrinsic property of recurrent networks that are abundant in cortex. Several studies have discussed the computing power of spiking WTA networks (Oster et al., 2009). Braganza et al. (2020) outlined a computer model related to backward inhibition in the dentate gyrus and investigated its ability to perform pattern separation. They found a moderate feedback inhibition mediated pattern separation effect during theta-modulated input but a substantial separation, particularly from very similar inputs during gamma oscillations (as used in our model). The impact of backward inhibition for separation is also shown by Wick et al. (2010). \u2022 Gamma aligned input spike trains and theta oscillations\nof excitability in output-neurons are the forms of coding that are clearly demonstrated in the hippocampus (Lisman and Jensen, 2013). \u2022 Theta phase-related input to R-neurons is essential to\nrealize WTA-competition in our model. The input has to arrive during the low period of the theta SMO. Such phaserelated activities often have been found in the hippocampus. For example, pyramidal neurons recorded in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of awake animals discharge on average in the negative phase of the theta cycle (Buzsaki, 2002). The results of Pern\u00eda-Andrade and Jonas (2014) show that the onset of action potentials in hippocampal granule cells is phase-locked to the descending part of the theta and gamma wave. They suggest that action potentials are generated at specific phases of the theta-gamma cycle, and their results are consistent with the idea that a temporal coding scheme is used. \u2022 A sublinear summation of the synaptic input to a\nsingle branch of R neurons is used. This mechanism is not essential for the proposed separation process, but allows input by a larger number of I-neurons (3\u2013 6 in our model) without premature spiking effects. Reports have shown that sublinear summation is a prominent dendritic operation, extending the range of subthreshold input-output transformations conferred by dendrites (Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015). Findings indicate that a sublinear integration of synaptic inputs is possible in multiple neuron types. \u2022 Delays of propagation of EPSP to the soma depending on\nthe spatial distance of synapses at R-neurons. Propagation delays of spikes (arriving at dendritic synapses) on their way to the soma and EPSP attenuation are taken into account.\nFIGURE 8 | Example of implemented connections between I- and R-neurons. A single R-neuron with 6 dendritic branches (only two are shown) is excitatory connected through 6 I-neurons (violet). A total of 4 I-neurons are activated (red squares). Their spikes are propagated to the R-neuron (red dotted connections).\nAgmon-Snir and Segev (1993) calculated the time delay and speed of propagation of electrical signals in a passive dendritic tree. The delay contributed by the dendrites in a modeled layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell is l0\u201317 ms for distal apical arbors and 1.5 ms for the basal dendrites. The net delay is reduced by 6\u201310 ms for the apical arbors and by 1\u20131.3 ms for the basal arbor. In our model, implemented delays are again not essential for the separation process even if they can enhance the SP. \u2022 As an only learning effect related to pattern separation,\nwe study the impact of hsLTD sometimes considered as relevant for pattern separation (O\u2019Reilly and McClelland, 1994).\nIn summary, the model presented uses a combination of neural mechanisms to effect a pattern separation. Specific to our model is that the first step of separation is based on spatial and temporal summation effects of membrane potentials in outputneurons. The summation leads to different delays of first spiking."

(2002) proposed that the information in single granule cells is converted into a time delay code by CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons. Higher granule cell spike frequencies produce shorter delays. A similar magnitude of activation temporally discharges CA3 targets together, thereby increasing their connectivity to one another. In contrast, our model uses the different distribution of spike times. First spikes in R-neurons are distributed in time and different delays separate the spatially overlapping input patterns. Sufficient summation effects are required to differentiate the input patterns. Temporal summation can be improved by longer EPSPs. Indeed, higher EPSP decay time constants were found in the hippocampus,\nFrontiers in Computational Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 858353\nwhere separation processes are likely. The decay time constant in dentate gyrus granule cells is about 6 ms and in hippocampal CA3 neurons is 11 ms (Kowalski et al., 2016).

Due to this temporal position of the input in relation to the theta phase, the lower cumulative values of membrane potential can also become overthreshold due to the increasing oscillation.\nTheta oscillations are present in all subregions of the hippocampus and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Increased activity patterns in the target cells of the dentate gyrus or the CA3 region due to input from the entorhinal cortex in the ascending phase of theta waves probably could be indicative of the proposed separation mechanisms. In fact, the overall population of active pyramidal cells fires the most action potentials per theta cycle just after theta cycle bottom (Mizuseky et al., 2009). However, this might be oversimplified to validate our model. Theta oscillations can be generated intrinsically (e.g., Fellous and Sejnowski, 2000 in the CA3 field) or extrinsically by synaptic circuits (e.g., by rhythmic perisomatic inhibition). The physiological mechanisms that evoke theta field potential and the temporal coordination of individual neurons across anatomically sequential subregions through theta oscillations are not yet fully understood. Population activity in hippocampal subregions does not merely reflect their input but also represents the result of autonomous local computation. Mizuseky et al. (2009) found an offset by a half-theta cycle of downstream dendritic excitation of CA3- and dentate gyrus neurons although the peak of population activity in the upstream entorhinal cortex structure corresponded well with the timing of dendritic excitation. Theta dynamic seems to allow for a considerable degree of independence of local circuit computation in the successive stages of the EC-hippocampal system."

The expansion can be quantified by the ratio of the size of the input population to the population of the expanded layer. In complete contrast to this, our simulations show that at least high temporal separation can occur through individual neurons and even taking place with a reduction. Spatiotemporal patterns are in a first step separated in the millisecond range of a rising theta wave (\u223c100 ms). Different spike times replace the commonly used different neurons. Only for the transfer of temporal into spatial separation a moderate expansion is required as a second step, which can be done by different mechanisms, e.g., by synfire waves or by competing WTA with random diluted connectivity. Thus by an expansion factor of 2 a spatial SP of 90% is achieved if supported by hsLTD. That is consistent with Cayco-Gajic and Silver (2019), who suggested that different structural and functional properties can cause pattern separation."

            "text": "In the following we try hypothetically to locate our model in the circuits between entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and hippocampal CA3-region, where significant separation processes are thought to be processed. For this purpose, our model is expanded in a modular way: 8 I-neurons together with 16 R-neurons form a unit that is combined to form a larger system of n modules. Every module processes a pool of I-neurons to the R-neurons. R-neurons are trained to be equivalent to the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Their input comes mainly from the perforant path of the entorhinal cortex, from mossy fibers of dentate gyrus, and from CA3 pyramidal neurons themselves by recurrent axons. The entorhinal input is relatively weak rarely exceeding the spiking threshold of pyramidal neurons by itself. The dentate input is arrived by a small number of strong synapses (mossy terminals synapse with 11\u201315 different CA3 pyramidal cells, Acs\u00e1dy et al., 1998) and does not exceed the spiking threshold on its own. Only the combination of both inputs is able to trigger spikes in CA3 cells. Whether this happen depends on the random connectivity of both inputs. In any case, the random and sparse connectivity from the dentate gyrus limits the field of possible activated CA3 neurons. It determines the effective factor of expansion by the input from the entorhinal cortex. Only in CA3 neurons receiving input from the dentate gyrus, the input from the EC is able to become suprathreshold and to represent the entorhinal input via separation. Subsequently, the activation of individual pyramidal cells leads to autoassociative feedback circuits that can generate memories and pattern completion of the input.\nOur separation model works within a single theta phase of SMO of about 100 ms. New theta phases produce new separated representations of the next input. Separation can take place sufficiently rapidly to be complete within one theta cycle."

Note that an increase in SP will lead to a decrease in the probability of joint activity of pairs of neurons if separation is also accompanied by the control of the pairs of neurons by different sets of influences. The decrease in the probability of joint activity will increase the entropy and decrease the mutual information. However, note that the increase in entropy or surprisal information if combined with an increase in mutual information serves as key bases of perception. Thus, the separation allows new time windows for an increase in mutual information given only the presence of specific stimuli. Therefore, the proposed model provides an important mechanism for an increase in entropy during information processing underlying the cognitive functions of the brain."

The question arises as to how such small temporal differences can be further processed in a meaningful way. Using synfire chain processes, we make a new proposal how temporal patterns can be extended by neurons to spatial patterns for further processing. To do this, we use systematically altered excitability between neighboring neurons. The temporal separation by single neurons can be perfectly converted back into an additional spatial separation. A very different way of processing small differences in time is expansion, which was seen as central to the separation process. Incomplete random connectivity spreads the times to the first spike across a spatially extended ensemble of neurons. A competing WTA-mechanisms selects the neurons with the shortest delay. There are probably other ways of converting temporal differences into spatial ones.\nWe hypothesize that additional determinants not considered here, such as the diversity of synaptic weights on dendritic branches can influence the SP. Thus Rolls (2016) noted that pattern separation could be produced by a fully connected competitive net without learning in which the synaptic weights are set to random values."

            "text": "A model is presented that defines the pattern separation mainly via the temporal dimension of neural activity. Spatially different input patterns lead to an output with different delays due to the spatial and temporal summation processes of membrane potential. SMOs can amplify differences in the delay of output spikes. The output as spikes with different delays can be processed downstream under different conditions. According to our model, the process of spatial separation, which has been mainly investigated up to now,\npresents itself as a reverse transformation of the time delay into spatial differentiation. The expansion performed by incomplete random connections seems to be responsible for this purpose. By our model, the original separation occurs in individual neurons by summing up the membrane potentials of incoming spikes over time. Other forms of back-transforming the temporal separation by delays into a spatial separation, e.g., by \u201csynfire wave\u201d are also possible. In any case, the time dimension should be more integrated into pattern separation research."
