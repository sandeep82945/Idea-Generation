    "abstractText": "Higher-dimensional hypercomplex fractal sets are getting more and more attention because of the discovery of more and more interesting properties and visual aesthetics. In this study, the attention was focused on generalized biquaternionic Julia sets and a generalization of classical Julia sets, defined by power and monic higher-order polynomials. Despite complex and quaternionic Julia sets, their biquaternionic analogues are still not well investigated. The performed morphological analysis of 3D projections of these sets allowed for definition of symmetries, limit shapes, and similarities with other fractal sets of this class. Visual observations were confirmed by stability analysis for initial cycles, which confirm similarities with the complex, bicomplex, and quaternionic Julia sets, as well as manifested differences between the considered formulations of representing polynomials.",

Introduction\nThe studies of Mandelbrot in the 1970s on the iterative equation:\nz\u2190 z2 + c, z, c \u2208 C, (1)\ndefined previously by Julia and Fatou in their investigation of complex dynamic systems, resulted in the discovery of one of the most geometrically complicated fractal sets, which is known nowadays as the Mandelbrot set, or simply M-set. By variation of c, the M-set consists of an infinite number of Julia (usually marked as J sets) and Fatou sets, varied by their connectivity. These studies of Mandelbrot were summarized in his famous book [1]. More information on the Julia and Mandelbrot sets, including the most important theorems, can be also found in [2]. However, in addition to the classical complex iteration mapping given by (1), a generalization of (1) can be found in quaternions H, the 4-dimensional hypercomplex algebra, i.e., in this case in (1) z, c \u2208 H. This is owing to the cooperation of Mandelbrot with Norton, who defined the quaternionic Mandelbrot-Julia (M-J) sets in terms of quaternions [3,4]. In parallel, Holbrook [5] performed further investigations in terms of their symmetries and connectivity. In the following decades, numerous generalizations of M-J sets in terms of hypercomplex number spaces were developed. They include the next logical step in the hypercomplex generalization of the M-J sets, that is, their generalization in terms of octonions O (the 8-dimensional hypercomplex algebra), proposed by Griffin and Joshi [6] with further investigation of their properties [7,8], namely, the structural transitions characteristics for a large class of octonionic maps. Further generalizations of M-J sets were not possible, since the hypercomplex algebra of 16-dimensional sedenions S, being the next generalization after octonions, does not meet any of fundamental properties necessary for addition and multiplication in an iteration process (see (1)), namely, sedenions are not commutative, associative, and alternative. The same is applicable to all subsequent generalizations. A detailed analysis of these properties can be found in [9].\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15010043 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 2 of 17\nLater, several other interesting generalizations were presented. In particular, Dixon et al. [10] investigated higher-dimensional generalizations of quadratic polynomial M-J sets defined in hypercomplex Clifford algebras. In this study, the authors demonstrated the fractal nature and symmetry properties of higher-dimensional hypercomplex M-J sets. Wang and Sun [11] proposed a generalization in terms of the power of the polynomial (1) in quaternions, namely:\nz\u2190 zp + c, z, c \u2208 H, p \u2208 N. (2)\nIn this study, the authors demonstrated the symmetry properties of quaternionic M-J sets, including those with negative power p and the stability analysis of these sets. In later studies, Wang\u2019s team also investigated hypercomplex generalizations defined in terms of power p as in (2) [12], which was an extension of previous studies by Dixon et al. [10]. The new family of generalizations of M-J sets was established by Rochon and his team. Their studies focused on generalizations in terms of tensor product algebras: he introduced bicomplex (C\u2297C or C2) M-J sets in [13], later studied by Wang and Song [14] as well, and further generalizations up to multicomplex Cn M-J sets [15\u201317]. This short overview shows that the hypercomplex generalizations of M-J sets are currently being intensively studied by numerous research teams. Proceeding to the generalization of M-J sets in terms of tensor product algebras, it was found that there exist M-J sets defined in biquaternions C\u2297H. The first introduction of biquaternionic M-J sets was given by Gintz [18], where he described the fundamentals of algebra of biquaternions and showed several renderings of 3D projections of these fractal sets. Later, Bogush et al. [19] presented their studies on the symmetry of biquaternionic J sets. Studies by the first author on biquaternionic fractal sets were established in [20], where their graphical representation and preliminary analysis based on comparison with other complex and hypercomplex J sets were presented. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of these fractal sets was performed and described in [9,21], where some unique properties for these sets were demonstrated. This paper aimed to perform a systematic analysis of the symmetry properties of biquaternionic J sets of type (2) and their additional polynomial variation, as well as to investigate their stability to confirm the observations made during morphological analysis of these sets. Morphological analysis and evaluation of stability for biquaternionic J sets are presented for the first time, which is the main novelty of the study. Moreover, biquaternionic J sets of type (2) were also defined and investigated for the first time. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 consists of fundamental properties of biquaternions, as well as basic operations necessary for constructing biquaternionic J sets, which was also presented in this section. Further, in Section 3, the results of a morphological analysis are presented, including the appearing symmetries in both types of the investigated J sets. The results of stability analysis of initial cycles are presented and discussed in Section 4. The main conclusions are derived in Section 5.\n2. Preliminaries 2.1. Biquaternions and Their Properties\nThe algebra of biquaternions, proposed by Hamilton in 1844 as one of the alternatives to quaternions [9], is a tensor product C \u2297 H of the field of complex numbers C and quaternions H; therefore, it is sometimes called a complexified quaternion. It is a 4- algebra, which is isomorphic to C2 and some Clifford algebras [22,23]. In symbolic form, a biquaternion q\u0303 can be presented in a complexified form:\nC\u2297H := {q\u0303 = a1 + a2i1 + a3i2 + a4i3|an \u2208 C}, (3)\nor extended alternative form\nC\u2297H := {q\u0303 = (g1 + h1 j) + (g2 + h2 j)i1 + (g3 + h3 j)i2 + (g4 + h4 j)i3|gn, hn \u2208 R}, (4)\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 3 of 17\nwhere in and j are imaginary units, i.e., i21 = i 2 2 = i 2 3 = \u22121, j2 = \u22121. The fundamental operations on biquaternions, such as addition and multiplication, are the same as for quaternions, i.e., the algebra of biquaternions is alternative. This means that multiplication is performed according to special rules according to their non-commutativity. To simplify these fundamental operations, one can apply the idempotent representation of biquaternions proposed in [24]:\nq\u03031,2 = 1 2 \u00b1 1 2 \u03be j, (5)\nwhere q\u03031,2 = \u03c91 + \u03be\u03c92, \u03c91, \u03c92 \u2208 C, \u03be \u2208 C\u2297H, \u03be2 = \u22121, which makes it possible to add and multiply biquaternions element-wise, so that two biquaternions q\u03031 = a1 + a2i1 + a3i2 + a4i3 and q\u03032 = b1 + b2i1 + b3i2 + b4i3, an, bn \u2208 C can be added and multiplied as follows:\nq\u03031 + q\u03032 := (a1 + b1) + (a2 + b2)i1 + (a3 + b3)i2 + (a4 + b4)i3, (6)\nq\u03031 := q\u03032 := (a1b1 \u2212 a2b2 \u2212 a3b3 \u2212 a4b4) + (a1b2 + a2b1 + a3b4 \u2212 a4b3)i1+ (a1b3 \u2212 a2b4 + a3b1 + a4b2)i2 + (a1b4 + a2b3 \u2212 a3b2 \u2212 a4b1)i3.\n(7)\nThe full list of properties and basic operations on biquaternions can be found in [25].\n2.2. Julia Sets within Biquaternions 2.2.1. Power Polynomials\nThe generalized J sets defined within biquaternions in the form\nz\u2190 zp + c, z, c \u2208 C\u2297H, p \u2265 2 (8)\nwere defined and analyzed in one of the previous author\u2019s publications [21]. Moreover, the condition of p \u2265 2 was discussed there. The main definitions and theorems for biquaternionic J sets are followed below for consistency.\nDefinition 1. The generalized \u201cfilled\u201d J set, obtained while iterating recursive Equation (8) is mapped into the biquaternionic vector space with a limited trajectory of c, and\nJpC\u2297H = { c \u2208 C\u2297H| f (p)c (z) 9 \u221e if p\u2192 \u221e } , (9)\nAnd, thus, JpC\u2297H is bounded [21].\nTheorem 1. Jpc,C\u2297H = J p (c1\u2212c2 j)q\u03031+(c\u03031+c\u03032 j)q\u03032,C\u2297H = Jpc1\u2212c2 j,C \u00d7e J p c\u03031+c\u03032 j,H [21].\nProof of Theorem 1. Let c \u2208 C \u2297 H. For the recursive equation defined by (8) and f (p)c (z) := ( f (p\u22121) c fc)(z), according to Definition 1, f (p) c (0) has a bounded orbit \u2200s \u2208 N. Additionally, when p \u2265 2, one obtains\nfc(z) = zp + c = [ (z1 \u2212 z2 j)p + (c1 \u2212 c2 j) ] q\u03031 + [ (z\u03031 + z\u03032 j) p + (c\u03031 + c\u03032 j) ] q\u03032, (10)\nwhere z = (z1 \u2212 z2 j)q\u03031 + (z\u03031 + z\u03032 j)q\u03032, and c = (c1 \u2212 c2 j)q\u03031 + (c\u03031 + c\u03032 j)q\u03032, thus\nf (p)c (z) = f (p) c1\u2212c2 j(z1 \u2212 z2 j)q\u03031 + f (p) c\u03031\u2212c\u03032 j(z\u03031 \u2212 z\u03032 j)q\u03032. (11)\nConsidering that f (p)c (0) = f (p) c1\u2212c2 j(0)q\u03031 + f (p) c\u03031\u2212c\u03032 j(0)q\u03032 is bounded when p\u2192 \u221e ,\nf (p)c1\u2212c2 j(0)q\u03031 and f (p) c\u03031\u2212c\u03032 j(0)q\u03032 are also bounded when p\u2192 \u221e . Then, c1\u2212 c2 j \u2208 J p C, c\u03031\u2212 c\u03032 j \u2208 JpH, and c = (c1 \u2212 c2 j)q\u03031 + (c\u03031 + c\u03032 j)q\u03032 \u2208 J p C \u00d7q\u0303 J p H, and J p C\u2297H \u2282 J p C \u00d7q\u0303 J p H [21].\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 4 of 17\n2.2.2. Monic Higher-Degree Polynomials\nTo investigate the homeomorphisms of M-J sets in a complex plane, Branner and Fagella [26] introduced the family of monic higher-degree polynomials in the following form:\nz\u2190 z(z + c)p. (12)\nThis allowed us to analyze the connectedness and complex dynamics of limbs and external rays in M-J sets. Later, Zireh investigated the properties of a family of polynomials of type (12) defined in bicomplex numbers in terms of connectedness [27]. From the defined theorems and their proofs presented in [27], it can easily be seen that the same applies for (12) defined in biquaternions; therefore, these theorems are omitted in this paper. The fundamentals on biquaternionic operations and definitions of J sets defined within power and monic higher-degree polynomials are used for their implementation for visualization and morphology analysis purposes, as well as for analysis of stability of these fractal sets presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.\n3. Symmetry of Biquaternionic Julia Sets\nThe first results on the construction of biquaternionic J sets in [18] were an inspiration for further investigation of these fractal sets, and their preliminary analysis was performed in [20,21], which focused on investigation of the symmetry of well-known analogues of J sets on a complex plane as well as the connectedness of these sets. In the following study, a systematic analysis in terms of symmetry of biquaternionic J sets of both types presented in Section 2.2 is presented. For analysis of the symmetry of biquaternionic J sets, their 3D projections onto R3 are used. Following the previous visualization techniques commonly used for the representation of 4D fractal sets, see, e.g., [11,13,14,20,21], where the 3D projection is obtained by setting a4 in the quadruplet (3) to 0. As shown, for example, in [11], this procedure does not cause a loss of generality. All 3D projections of the biquaternionic J sets presented in this paper were prepared in ChaosPro 4.0 freeware software. To implement addition and multiplication operations on biquaternions according to the rules presented in Section 2.1, which are necessary for the construction of biquaternionic J sets according to (8) and (12), a new library was prepared in the native programming language in ChaosPro, which is based on C/C++.\n3.1. Symmetry of Biquaternionic Julia Sets Defined by Power Polynomials\nAs shown in [21], biquaternionic J sets do not resemble their quaternionic or bicomplex analogues in terms of symmetry. Wang and Sun in [11] demonstrated the rotational symmetry of quaternionic J sets, whereas Rochon showed the quadrilateral symmetry of bicomplex J sets, which was confirmed in [21]. The conjecture of uniqueness of biquaternionic J sets in terms of their symmetry made in [18] was confirmed in further studies presented in [21]. A simple way to show this uniqueness is to set c = 0 in (8). The resulting recursion equation leads to the appearance of the analog of the so-called \u201cunit disc\u201d in the case of the C-plane [4], i.e., {z \u2208 C : |z| < 1}. Previous studies on quaternionic and bicomplex J sets for such conditions [4,28,29] show that in the first case when p\u2192 \u221e, one obtains a hypersphere (which was observed also in [11]), whereas in the second case, the resulting shape is a Steinmetz hypersolid. This can be generalized for their higher-dimensional analogues as well. To analyze the biquaternionic J sets for c = 0 and increasing p, their representative 3D projections are shown in Figure 1.\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 5 of 17 Symmetry 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 16\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\nFigure 1.

Stability of Biquaternionic Julia Sets Defined by Power Polynomials 4.1.1. 1-Cycle Stability\nThere are numerous similarities between biquaternions, quaternions, and bicomplex numbers; that is, all of these number spaces represent 4-dimenional hypercomplex numbers with numerous similar properties (see Section 2.1 for more details). Moreover, \u2102\u2a02\u210d is isomorphic to \u2102 [22]. Thus, the dynamics and stability of Julia sets defined as biquaternions are expected to reveal some similarities as in the case of their morphological analysis performed in Section 3.\nFollowing [11,30], let us represent the n-th generation biquaternion in terms of Pauli matrices: \ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc08 + \ud835\udc56\ud835\uded4\ud835\udc15 , (13) where \ud835\uded4 = (\ud835\uded4 , \ud835\uded4 , \ud835\uded4 ) is a set of 2 \u00d7 2 Pauli matrices: \ud835\uded4 = 0 11 0 , \ud835\uded4 = 0 \u2212\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 0 , \ud835\uded4 = 1 00 \u22121 , (14) completed by 2 \u00d7 2 invariant unit matrix \ud835\udc08 = 1 00 1 , (15) and \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc15 \u2261 \ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc63, \ud835\udc64 , i.e., the biquaternion can be represented by its scalar and vector parts: \ud835\udc12 = \ud835\udc65 , \ud835\udc15 = \ud835\udc66 , \ud835\udc63 , \ud835\udc64 , \ud835\udc65 , \ud835\udc66 , \ud835\udc63 , \ud835\udc64 \u2208 \u2102. (16)\nNote that for quaternions \ud835\uded4 = \u2212\ud835\udc56(\ud835\uded4 , \ud835\uded4 , \ud835\uded4 ), i.e., the quaternion needs to be multiplied by \u2212\ud835\udc56 and indices of \ud835\uded4 need to be replaced (see, e.g., [25]), whereas for biquaternions, Pauli matrices (14) can be used directly without additional operations [31].\nThe recurrence relation for the biquaternionic quadratic map can be presented as:\nFigure 6. Three-dimensioanl projections of biquaternionic J sets generated with monic higher-degree polynomials (12) for Dendrite p = 2, c = i1 (a), and San Marco p = 2, c = \u22120.75 (b), in isometric views.\nThe J sets of both types, investigated from the point of view of their morphology and appearance symmetries, were further investigated in light of their stability, in particular, the determination of the boundaries of fixed points for variable p, which is the subject of the next section.\n4. Stability of Biquaternionic Julia Sets\nIn this section, the stability of generalized Julia sets defined in biquaternions is analyzed. The analysis was performed for both investigated recurrence Equations (8) and (12) for 1-, 2-, and 3-cycle stability and various values of p, which made it possible to observe variation of stability for these sets when p\u2192 \u221e .\n4.1. Stability of Biquaternionic Julia Sets Defined by Power Polynomials 4.1.1. 1-Cycle Stability\nThere are numerous similarities between biquaternions, quaternions, and bicomplex numbers; that is, all of these number spaces represent 4-dimenional hypercomplex numbers with numerous similar properties (see Section 2.1 for more details). Moreover, C\u2297H is isomorphic to C2 [22]. Thus, the dynamics and stability of Julia sets defined as biquaternions are expected to reveal some similarities as in the case of their morphological analysis performed in Section 3. Following [11,30], let us represent the n-th generation biquaternion in terms of Pauli matrices:\nzn = xnI + i\u03c3Vn, (13)\nwhere \u03c3 = (\u03c31,\u03c32,\u03c33) is a set of 2 \u00d7 2 Pauli matrices:\n\u03c31 = [ 0 1 1 0 ] , \u03c32 = [ \u2212i i 0 ] , \u03c33 = [ 1 0 0 \u22121 ] , (14)\ncompleted by 2 \u00d7 2 invariant unit matrix\nI = [\n1 0 0 1\n] , (15)\nand {x, V} \u2261 {x, y, v, w}, i.e., the biquaternion can be represented by its scalar and vector parts:\nSn = {xn}, Vn = {yn, vn, wn}, xn, yn, vn, wn \u2208 C. (16)\nNote that for quaternions \u03c3 = \u2212i(\u03c33,\u03c32,\u03c31), i.e., the quaternion needs to be multiplied by\u2212i and indices of \u03c3n need to be replaced (see, e.g., [25]), whereas for biquaternions, Pauli matrices (14) can be used directly without additional operations [31].\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 9 of 17\nThe recurrence relation for the biquaternionic quadratic map can be presented as:\nzn+1 = z2n + c, (17)\nwhere c = d1I + i\u03c3D, (18)\nD = {d2, d3, d4}, d1, d2, d3, d4 \u2208 C. (19)\nTaking into account (13) and (16), we may write\nz2 = (SI + i\u03c3V)2 = ( S2 \u2212V2 ) I + 2i\u03c3SV. (20)\nThe iterations of (17) considering (18) and (20) are represented by:\nSn+1 = S2n \u2212V2n + d1, (21)\nVn+1 = 2SnVn + D. (22)\nTo determine fixed points and boundary regions for the biquaternionic quadratic map, it is necessary to determine the eigenvalues of the matrix with perturbed terms. Introducing the perturbation of z, we have:\nS = Sn + \u03b5Sn, (23)\nV = Vn + \u03b5Vn, (24)\nwhere \u03b5 is the so-called small perturbation parameter. This leads to:\n\u03b5Sn+1 = S\u2212 Sn+1 = S2 \u2212V2 \u2212 S2n + V2n, (25)\n\u03b5Vn+1 = V\u2212Vn+1 = 2(SV\u2212 SnVn), (26)\nwhich can be simplified to the following form:\n\u03b5Sn+1 = 2(Sn\u03b5Sn \u2212Vn\u03b5Vn) + O ( \u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n ) , (27) \u03b5Vn+1 = 2(Sn\u03b5Vn \u2212Vn\u03b5Sn) + O ( \u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n ) , (28)\nwhere O (\n\u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n\n) is the Landau symbol, which denotes truncation in terms of the order\nhigher than the first one in solutions (27) and (28). Expanding \u03b5Vn in terms of the orthogonal triplet (i1, i2, i3), we have:\n\u03b5Vn = \u03b5\u03b1ni1 + \u03b5\u03b2ni2 + \u03b5\u03b3ni3 (29)\nand omitting the Landau symbol in (27) and (28), we obtain:\n\u03b5Sn+1 = 2(S\u03b5Sn \u2212V\u03b5\u03b1ni1), (30)\n\u03b5Vn+1 = 2(Sn\u03b5\u03b1ni1 \u2212V\u03b5Sn). (31)\nFrom the matrix ( \u03b5Sn+1 \u03b5\u03b1n+1 ) = \u039b ( \u03b5Sn \u03b5\u03b1n ) , (32)\nwe can determine \u039b considering (30) and (31):\n\u039b = [\n2S \u22122Vi1 2Vi1 2S\n] , (33)\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 10 of 17\nwhich makes it possible to obtain the eigenvalues:\n\u03bb1,2 = 2(S\u2213Vi1). (34)\nConsidering that |\u03bbn| = 2(S + V) and noting that |\u03bb| < 1, the boundary region of the biquaternionic quadratic map is determined by\nS + V = 1 2 , (35)\nwhich leads to: \u2016z\u2016 = 1\n2 . (36)\nAccording to the trigonometric representation proposed in [11]:\nz = \u2016z\u2016(cos \u03b8 + m sin \u03b8), (37)\nwhere m = K/|K|, we have:\nS = 1 2 cos \u03b8, V = 1 2 m sin \u03b8, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. (38)\nThe boundary of the region of fixed points for the biquaternionic quadratic map is thus defined by:\nd1 = 1 4 (2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 cos 2\u03b8), D = m 4 (2 sin \u03b8 \u2212 sin 2\u03b8), 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. (39)\nIn the same way, we can obtain solutions for higher-degree biquaternionic maps. Let us analyze the next cases discussed previously for p = 3 and p = 5. The boundary region of fixed points for these cases are, respectively, as follows:\np = 3 : \u2016z\u2016 = 1\u221a 3 , d1 = 1\u221a 3\n( cos \u03b8 \u2212 1\n3 cos 3\u03b8\n) , D =\nm\u221a 3\n( sin \u03b8 \u2212 1\n3 sin 3\u03b8\n) , (40)\np = 5 : \u2016z\u2016 = 14\u221a5 , d1 = 1 4 \u221a 5\n( cos \u03b8 \u2212 1\n5 cos 5\u03b8\n) , D =\nm 4 \u221a\n5\n( sin \u03b8 \u2212 1\n5 sin 5\u03b8\n) . (41)\nFor detailed calculations for these cases, see Appendix A. Taking into account (37) and (39)\u2013(41), one can observe that these formulas lead to\ntheir general form proposed in [11] for quaternions:\n\u2016z\u2016 = |p|\u2212 1\np\u22121 , (42){ d1 = |p|\n\u2212 1p\u22121 (cos \u03b8 \u2212 cos p\u03b8), D = |p|\u2212 1 p\u22121 (sin \u03b8 \u2212 sin p\u03b8).\n(43)\nUsing (42), one can get the 1-cycle stability for the limit shape considered in the previous section. Substituting p = \u221e to (42), the direct result will have an indeterminate form; however, when representing it in terms of limits, we have\nlim p\u2192\u221e |p|\u2212 1 p\u22121 = 1. (44)\nThis confirms the convergence of the 1-cycle stability region of the generalized biquaternionic J set to the unit disc.\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 11 of 17\n4.1.2. 2-Cycle Stability\nThe 2-cycle for the biquaternionic quadratic map is defined by the equation:\nzn+2 = ( z2n + c )2 + c = z4n + 2z 2 nc + c 2 + c, (45)\nwhere c is given by (18) and (19). Using the notation given by (13) and (16), the powers of z can be given by (20) and the following expression:\nz4 = (SI + i\u03c3V)4 = ( S4 \u2212 6S2V2 + V4 ) I + 4i\u03c3 ( S3V\u2212 SV2 ) . (46)\nThe iterations of (45) considering (18), (20) and (46) are represented by:\nSn+2 = S4n \u2212 6S2nV2n + V4n + 2a ( S2n \u2212V2n ) + d21 + d1, (47)\nVn+2 = 4SnVn ( S2n \u2212Vn + D ) \u2212D2 + D. (48)\nWhen introducing the perturbation of z by (23) and (24) as in Section 4.1.1, one obtains:\n\u03b5Sn+2 = S\u2212 Sn+2 = S4 + V4 \u2212 6 ( S2V2 \u2212 S2nV2n ) + 2 ( S2 \u2212V2 \u2212 S2n \u2212V2n ) \u2212 S4n \u2212V4n, (49)\n\u03b5Vn+2 = V\u2212Vn+1 = 4 ( S3V\u2212 SV2 + SV ) \u2212 4 ( S3nVn \u2212 SnV2n + SnVn ) . (50)\nAfter simplification of (49) and (50) and omitting the Landau symbol as in Section 4.1.1, we have: \u03b5Sn+2 = 4S\u03b5Sn ( S2 \u2212 3V2 + 1 ) + 4V\u03b5\u03b1ni1 ( V\u2212 3S2 \u2212 1 ) , (51)\n\u03b5Vn+2 = 4S\u03b5\u03b1ni1 ( S2 \u2212 2V + 1 ) \u2212 4V\u03b5Vn ( V + 3S2 + 1 ) . (52)\nFrom matrix (32) we can determine \u039b:\n\u039b =  4S(S2 \u2212 3V2 + 1) 4Vi1(V\u2212 3S2 \u2212 1) \u22124Vi1 ( V + 3S2 + 1 ) 4S ( S2 \u2212 2V + 1 ) , (53)\nand the corresponding eigenvalues:\n\u03bb1,2 = 4 ( S3 \u2212 1.5SV2 \u2212 SV + S ) \u00b1 2Vi\u03c3 \u221a 36S4 + 9S2V2 \u2212 12S2V + 28S2 \u2212 4V2 + 4. (54)\nTaking the module of (54), we have:\n\u2016z\u2016 = 13\u221a4 , (55)\nwhich leads to the determination of the boundary of the region of fixed points for the 2-cycle using (37) and (38). In a similar way, we can determine the boundary regions of fixed points for the 2-cycle for p = 3 and p = 5, where:\np = 3 : \u2016z\u2016 = 18\u221a9 , (56)\np = 5 : \u2016z\u2016 = 124\u221a25 . (57)\nThe presentation of the detailed calculations was omitted in this paper because of its severe extension.\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 12 of 17\nFrom the obtained values, one can derive the general formula for \u2016z\u2016 for the 2-cycle:\n\u2016z\u2016 = |p| \u2212 2 p2\u22121 . (58)\nAssuming p = \u221e in (58), one leads to the conclusion that the 2-cycle stability region of the generalized biquaternionic J set also leads to the unit disc.\n4.1.3. 3-Cycle Stability\nStarting again from the biquaternionic quadratic map, the 3-cycle analogue is defined by the equation:\nzn+3 = ((z2n + c) 2 + c) 2 + c = z8n + 4z 6 nc + 6z 4 nc 2 + 2z4nc + 4z 2 nc 3 + 4z2nc 2 + c4 + 2c3 + c2 + c, (59)\nwhere c is given by (18) and (19). Using the notation given by (13) and (16), the powers of z can be given by (20), (46), and the following expressions:\nz6 = ( S6 \u2212 15S4V2 + 15S2V4 \u2212V6 ) I + 2i\u03c3 ( 3S5V\u2212 10S3V3 + 3SV5 ) , (60)\nz8 = ( S8 \u2212 28S6V2 + 70S4V4 \u2212 28S2V6 + V8 ) I + 8i\u03c3 ( S7V\u2212 7S5V3 + 7S3V5 \u2212 SV7 ) . (61)\nIntroducing perturbation of z and simplifications, which were omitted here due to complex notation, one obtains the matrix from which the eigenvalues are calculated. Taking the module of the obtained eigenvalues, we have:\n\u2016z\u2016 = 17\u221a4 . (62)\nUsing a similar procedure, the value of \u2016z\u2016 was calculated for p = 3:\n\u2016z\u2016 = 126\u221a27 . (63)\nCalculations for the higher values of p were not possible because of the hardware limitations. Because of this, the determination of the general formulas for the 3-cycle and higher cycles is not possible through the computational way. Nevertheless, it is expected that the dynamics are different for higher cycles, which finally leads to the limit shape observed in Section 3.1.\n4.2. Stability of Biquaternionic Julia Sets Defined by Monic Higher-Degree Polynomials 4.2.1. 1-Cycle Stability\nThe recurrence relation for the biquaternionic quadratic map defined in terms of monic higher-degree polynomials (12) can be presented as:\nzn+1 = zn(zn + c) 2 = z3n + 2z 2 nc + znc 2. (64)\nUsing the notation given by (13) and (16), the powers of z can be given by (20) and (A1). Applying the same procedure as in Section 4.1.1, one can calculate the iterations of (64) considering (18), (20) and (46), which can be represented by:\nSn+1 = Sn ( S2n + 2Snd1 \u2212 3V2n \u2212 4DVn \u2212D2 + d21 ) \u2212 2Vnd1(Vn + D), (65) Vn+1 = Vn ( \u2212V2n + 4Snd1 + S2n \u2212 2DVn \u2212D2 + d21 ) + 2SnD(Sn + d1). (66)\nIntroducing the perturbation of z and simplifications, we can obtain the eigenvalues in the following form:\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 13 of 17\n\u03bb1,2 = 3 2 S2 \u2212 3SV\u2212 4V\u2212 3 2 V2 \u00b1 1 2 i\u03c3 \u221a 9S4 + 108S3V + 96S3 + 18S2V2 + 240S2V + 164S2 \u2212 108SV3 \u2212192SV2 + 24SV + 64S + 9V4 \u2212 48V3 \u2212 100V2 \u2212 32V + 4 (67)\nTaking the module of (67), we have:\n\u2016z\u2016 = \u221a\n6 3 , (68)\nwhich leads to the determination of the boundary of the region of fixed points for a 1-cycle using (36) and (37). Similarly, we can determine the boundary regions of fixed points for a 1-cycle for p = 3 and p = 5, where:\np = 3 : \u2016z\u2016 = 13\u221a2 , (69)\np = 5 : \u2016z\u2016 = 15\u221a3 . (70)\n4.2.2. 2-Cycle Stability\nThe 2-cycle for the biquaternionic quadratic map defined in terms of monic higherdegree polynomials (12) is given by equation:\nzn+2 = zn(zn(zn + c) 2 + c) 2 = z8n + 4z 7 nc + 6z 6 nc 2 + 4z5nc 3 + z4nc 4 + 2z4nc + 4z 3 nc 2 + 2z2nc 3 + c2. (71)\nThe powers of z are given by (20), (46), (60), (61), (A1), (A3), and the following expression:\nz7 = ( S7 \u2212 21S5V2 + 35S3V4 \u2212 7SV6 ) I + i\u03c3 ( 7S6V\u2212 35S4V3 + 21S2V5 \u2212V7 ) . (72)\nOmitting the steps presented above, one leads to the determination of modules of eigenvalues for 2-cycle stability, which in this case have the following values for the considered p:\np = 2 : \u2016z\u2016 = 17\u221a4 , (73)\np = 3 : \u2016z\u2016 = 14 \u221a\n2 15 , (74)\n4.2.3. 3-Cycle Stability\nFinally, the 3-cycle for the biquaternionic quadratic map defined in terms of monic higher-degree polynomials (12) is given by the equation:\nzn+3 = zn(zn(zn(zn + c) 2 + c) 2 + c)\n2\n= z10n + 4z9nc + 6z8nc2 + 4z7nc3 + z6nc4 + 2z6nc + 4z5nc2 + 2z5nc +2z4nc3 + 4z4nc2 + 2z3nc3 + z2nc2 + 2znc2 + c2.\n(75)\nIn this case, the powers of z are given by all expressions mentioned in Section 4.2.2 and the following ones:\nz9 = ( S9 \u2212 36S7V2 + 126S5V4 \u2212 84S3V6 + 9SV8 ) I\n+i\u03c3 ( 9S8V\u2212 84S6V3 + 126S4V5 \u2212 36S2V7 + V9 ) . (76)\nz10 = ( S10 \u2212 45S8V2 + 210S6V4 \u2212 210S4V6 + 45S2V8 \u2212V10 ) I\n+2i\u03c3 ( 5S9V\u2212 60S7V3 + 126S5V5 \u2212 60S3V7 + 5SV9 ) . (77)\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 14 of 17\nUsing the same computational procedure as previously, the modulus of the eigenvalue for 3-cycle stability was determined for p = 2:\n\u2016z\u2016 = 117\u221a9 . (78)\nBecause of the increasing computational complexity (for p = 3 the maximal power within the polynomial is 48, while for p = 5 this value equals 180), the determination of modules of eigenvalues for higher values of p were not possible because of hardware limitations.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper discusses the generalized biquaternionic Julia sets defined by power and monic higher-degree polynomials in terms of their symmetry and stability. The 3D projections of both types of fractal sets were constructed and discussed. The symmetry planes for these fractal sets were defined together with the definition and analysis of the limit shapes (when p\u2192 \u221e ). The similarities between fractal sets were constructed based on power polynomials and its analogues in other hypercomplex number spaces with the same dimension, such as fractal sets defined in quaternions and bicomplex numbers. Moreover, it was shown that all of the mentioned fractal sets have the same origin as complex Julia sets. The biquaternionic Julia sets constructed based on monic higher-degree polynomials were presented for the first time, and the morphological analysis of these sets shows that their shapes and dynamics are completely different with respect to the above-discussed fractal sets defined in power polynomials, again underlining the multimodality and increasing complexity of Julia sets defined in hypercomplex number spaces. To support the observations made during the morphological analysis, stability calculations were performed for both investigated types of fractal sets. It was shown that the dynamics of biquaternionic Julia sets defined by power polynomials reveal similarities to the dynamics of fractal sets defined in quaternions, at least in the initial cycles of stability. The severe differences between these two types of fractal sets are expected to appear at high cycles of stability; however, because of hardware limitations, these differences have not been identified yet. In contrast, the biquaternionic fractal sets defined by monic high-order polynomials reveal some similarities but different and more complex behavior, which confirms the observations made for the morphology of these sets.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nConflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest.\nList of Symbols\nan complex elements of a biquaternion bn complex elements of a biquaternion c constant value of the Julia/Mandelbrot set C complex number space C2 bicomplex number space Cn multicomplex number space C\u2297C bicomplex number space C\u2297H biquaternion number space dn complex elements of the constant value of the biquaternionic Julia set D vector part of constant value of the biquaternionic Julia set\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 15 of 17\ngn real elements of the extended representation of a biquaternion hn real elements of the extended representation of a biquaternion H quaternion number space in imaginary units I invariant unit matrix j imaginary unit JpC\u2297H generalized biquaternionic Julia set N natural number space O Landau symbol O octonion number space p power of the iterated variable of the Julia/Mandelbrot set q\u0303 biquaternion R real number space Sn scalar parts of the iterated variable of the biquaternionic Julia set S sedenion number space vn complex elements of vector parts of biquaternions Vn vector parts of the iterated variable of the biquaternionic Julia set wn complex elements of vector parts of the iterated variable of the biquaternionic Julia set xn complex elements of scalar parts of the iterated variable of the biquaternionic Julia set yn complex elements of vector parts of the iterated variable of the biquaternionic Julia set z iterated variable of the Julia/Mandelbrot set \u03b5 small perturbation parameter \u03bbn eigenvalues \u03be biquaternionic root of \u22121 \u03c3n Pauli matrices \u03c9n arbitrary complex numbers =1=2 symmetry plane along the axes of imaginary values i1 and i2 <=1 symmetry plane along the axes of reals and imaginary i1 values <=2 symmetry plane along the axes of reals and imaginary i2 values\nAppendix A\nConsidering the preliminaries given by (13)\u2013(16), (18) and (19), one can calculate 1-cycle stability of the biquaternionic map for p = 3 and p = 5. According to this, we obtain\nz3 = (SI + i\u03c3V)3 = S ( S2 \u2212 3V2 ) I + i\u03c3V ( 3S2 \u2212V2 ) , (A1)\nz5 = (SI + i\u03c3V)5 = S ( S4 \u2212 10S2V2 + 5V4 ) I + i\u03c3V ( 5S4 \u2212 10S2V2 + V4 ) . (A2)\nRepresenting (A1) and (A2) as two parts, for p = 3, we have\nSn+1 = Sn ( S2n \u2212 3V2n ) + d1, (A3) Vn+1 = Vn ( 3S2n \u2212V2n ) + D, (A4)\nand for p = 5 Sn+1 = Sn ( S4n \u2212 10S2nV2n + 5V4n ) + d1, (A5)\nVn+1 = Vn ( 5S4n \u2212 10S2nV2n + V4n ) + D. (A6)\nIntroducing perturbation in the same way as in (23) and (24) and introducing the Landau symbol in the obtained solutions to truncate higher-order terms, for p = 3, we have\n\u03b5Sn+1 = 3 ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5Sn \u2212 6SV\u03b5Vn + O ( \u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n ) , (A7) \u03b5Vn+1 = 3 ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5Vn + 6SV\u03b5Sn + O ( \u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n ) , (A8)\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 43 16 of 17\nand for p = 5\n\u03b5Sn+1 = 5 ( S4 \u2212 2S2V2 + V4 ) \u03b5Sn \u2212 20SV ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5Vn + O ( \u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n ) , (A9)\n\u03b5Vn+1 = 5 ( S4 \u2212 6S2V2 + V4 ) \u03b5Vn + 20SV ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5Sn + O ( \u03b5S2n, \u03b5V 2 n ) . (A10)\nUsing (29) and omitting the Landau symbol, for p = 3, we obtain\n\u03b5Sn+1 = 3 ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5Sn \u2212 6SV\u03b5\u03b1ni1, (A11) \u03b5Vn+1 = 6SV\u03b5Sn + 3 ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5\u03b1ni1, (A12)\nand for p = 5\n\u03b5Sn+1 = 5 ( S4 \u2212 2S2V2 + V4 ) \u03b5Sn \u2212 20SV ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5\u03b1ni1, (A13) \u03b5Vn+1 = 5 ( S4 \u2212 6S2V2 + V4 ) \u03b5\u03b1ni1 + 20SV ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u03b5Sn, (A14)\nwhich leads to construction of matrix of the form (32) and determination of eigenvalues for p = 3\n\u03bb1,2 = 3 ( S2 \u2212V2 ) \u2213 6SVi\u03c3, (A15)\nand for p = 5\n\u03bb1,2 = 5 ( S4 \u2212 4S2V2 + V4 ) \u2213 \u221a 10 ( S2V2 \u2212 2S3 + 2V3 ) i\u03c3. (A16)\nTaking the module of (A15) and (A16) and noting that |\u03bb| < 1, for p = 3 , we have\nS2 + V2 = 1 3 \u2192 \u2016z\u2016 = 1\u221a 3 , (A17)\nand for p = 5.\nS4 \u2212 4S2V2 + V4 = 1 5 \u2192 \u2016z\u2016 = 14\u221a5 .
