Alternative approaches3,4 to the use of 129Xe for lung ventilation imaging exist, however.\nAmong them, the use of inert fluorinated gases is the most advanced in terms of clinical applications and has the potential for large-scale deployment5. Despite inferior capabilities\n(lower SNR, no imaging of dissolved phase) to hyperpolarized gas, this approach offers a\nnumber of advantages in terms of cost (no polarizer needed) and ease of preparation and delivery of inhalable gas to the patient. As a matter of fact, fluorine-19 (19F) MRI has already\nshown its applicability and potential for certain pulmonary pathologies such as COPD and asthma6,7. However, validation studies are still needed to strengthen the robustness of 19F MRI,\nestablish its reproducibility and extend its attractiveness for the radiologists and clinicians.\nPage 1 of 4\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nJournal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nThe authors of the \"Volume-controlled 19F MR ventilation imaging of fluorinated gas\" paper8\naimed precisely at this kind of objective. In this study they investigated the use of a fluorinated\ngas delivery device and assessed its impact on the acquisition, the quantification and the repeatability of several 19F ventilation readouts. Additionally, they computed the correlation of 19F imaging parameters with predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 % pred) derived from pulmonary function testing.\nFor this purpose, 30 healthy volunteers and 26 COPD patients were examined using a normoxic\nmixture of perfluoropropane (C3F8) and oxygen. On the same imaging session, the subjects underwent successively a lung ventilation MRI protocol with and without the use of the volume-\ncontrolled gas delivery system. This MRI protocol was repeated for each subject one week later. The 19F MRI readouts assessed in this study were both static \u2013 the ventilated volume percentage at the initial first and last 19F images \u2013 and dynamic \u2013 time to fill, fractional ventilation and\nwash-in time.\nThe authors observed that, as a sign of improved reproducibility, the intraclass correlation coefficients between the first and second scan one week later increased for all the 19F MRI\nreadouts when using gas delivery system. In the same way, they also reported that the\ncoefficients of variation between first and second scan for static and dynamic imaging readouts\nwere lower for COPD and healthy subjects when using the gas delivery system. Additionally, strong and moderate linear correlations between 19F MRI readouts and FEV1% pred were strengthened when using the gas delivery system.\nOverall, this study demonstrates on a relatively large population the feasibility and interest of using a gas delivery system for 19F lung MRI. This type of device can be particularly useful to standardize 19F acquisitions based on multiple time-resolved breaths that generate ventilation\ndynamic measurements. Furthermore, this device will be especially important for patients with\nPage 2 of 4\nJohn Wiley & Sons\nJournal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nchronic lung diseases such as COPD or CF, where reliable follow-up is essential for patient\nmanagement.\nWhile the publication of XX et al represents an important step toward routine clinical practice of 19F lung MRI, it remains to be seen whether its imaging markers will provide clinically\nvaluable information for the diagnosis and phenotyping of lung diseases, the evaluation of drug\nor treatment efficacy, and the understanding of lung disease onset and progression.\nReferences\n1.
