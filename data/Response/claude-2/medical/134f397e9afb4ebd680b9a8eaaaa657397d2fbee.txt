 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the specific components of the cell wall and membrane that contribute to the differing susceptibility of F. meridionale and F. graminearum to plasma treatment. This could shed light on why F. meridionale was more easily inactivated. 

2. Test the efficacy of plasma treatment on a wider range of fungal species beyond F. meridionale and F. graminearum to see if there are general trends in susceptibility. This could help optimize treatment parameters.

3. Analyze the chemical changes induced in DON and D3G by plasma treatment to elucidate the mechanisms of toxin degradation and conversion. Identification of breakdown products could reveal if detoxification is occurring.

4. Evaluate the impact of plasma treatment on seed germination rates, seedling health, and plant growth when applied to agricultural seeds and grains. This is important for assessing feasibility as a pre-planting treatment. 

5. Investigate combining plasma treatment with other antifungal agents like prothioconazole to develop an integrated strategy for controlling fungi and mycotoxins. The synergistic effects of plasma plus fungicides should be explored.
