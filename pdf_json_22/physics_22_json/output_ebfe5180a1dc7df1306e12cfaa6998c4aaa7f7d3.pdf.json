INTRODUCTION\nTwo-dimensional quasi-relativistic Dirac electrons appear as low-energy excitations in many electronic systems, graphene arguably being the best-known example. Interactions between electrons can lead to various phase transitions at strong coupling, with the concomitant quantum critical behavior defining new generalized Gross-Neveu universality classes1\u20133. The latter have been a subject of numerous analytic4\u201323 and numerical studies24\u201338. Also, the multicritical behavior near points of the phase diagram where three (or more) phases meet has attracted considerable interest39\u201344. Recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations45, for example, have explored a situation where Nf = 2 four-component Dirac fermions are coupled to two order parameters, each appearing as three relativistic mutually anticommuting masses in the Dirac Hamiltonian, and transforming as a vector under an SO(3) symmetry group: the first internal SO(3) rotates between the charge-density-wave (CDW) and two components of the s-wave superconductor (sSC1, sSC2), and the second SO(3) rotates the three spatial components of the Ne\u0301el order (Ne\u0301el1, Ne\u0301el2, Ne\u0301el3).\nHere, we further investigate this multicriticality within a field-theoretic approach. We extend the previous analysis to a generalized Dirac system with coupled order parameters that transform under SO(na)\u00d7SO(nb). For the specific value of na = nb = 3, we come to a different conclusion about the nature of multicritical behavior than Ref. 45.\nIt is useful to first recall some basic facts about the mass-like order parameters for the two-dimensional Dirac fermions in question. Two-dimensional spin-1/2 elec-\ntrons on honeycomb lattice, to take a specific example, are described by eight-component Dirac fermions, due to having two spin, two valley, and two sublattice degrees of freedom. Its standard relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian therefore features an SU(4) symmetry that unifies and extends the spin and the valley (or chiral) symmetries, which by themselves would only yield the SO(3)\u00d7SO(3)' SO(4)\u2282 SU(4) group of symmetry. One pair of triplets of Dirac masses (which throughout this paper will be used interchangeably with order parameters) that would transform as (1, 0) + (0, 1) representation of this spinvalley SO(4) subgroup is the three components of the quantum spin Hall (QSH1, QSH2, QSH3) insulator as the first, and the CDW and the two Kekule\u0301 bond-densitywave (BDW1, BDW2) insulators as the second triplet.\nThe inclusion of superconducting mass order parameters requires, however, the usual Nambu-doubling of Dirac Hamiltonian into a sixteen-dimensional particlehole-symmetric Dirac Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian. The crucial observation then is that the maximal number of \u201ccompatible\u201d order parameters, insulating and/or superconducting, which are represented by mutually anticommuting Dirac masses in the Nambudoubled representation is five46. This number is ultimately determined by the antiunitary particle-hole symmetry inherent to Nambu\u2019s construction47. All 56 such quintuplets of compatible Dirac masses have been listed with the help of computer algebra in Ref. 46. Each triplet of mutually anticommuting masses can be found in only one quintuplet, but any pair of mutually anticommuting masses, remarkably, belongs to two different quintuplets47. This last feature will be of crucial importance for our further discussion. ar X iv :2\n20 6.\n04 07\n3v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 8\nJ un\n2 02\n2\n2 To quickly preview our results, we note that there are two main aspects of the problem. First, we observe that any two triplets of Dirac masses that mutually anticommute within the same triplet, but commute when from different triplets,69, can always be complemented by the same pair of some other two Dirac masses to their respective quintuplets. In other words, the only realization of the (1, 0) + (0, 1) mass order parameters is provided by two quintuplets that share a common pair of masses. The two quintuplets (CDW, sSC1, sSC2, BDW1, BDW2) and (Ne\u0301el1, Ne\u0301el2, Ne\u0301el3, BDW1, BDW2) are one such example, which would correspond to the two triplets studied in Ref. 45. Further, (CDW, sSC1, sSC2, BDW1, BDW2) and (sSC1, sSC2, QSH1, QSH2, QSH3) form another pair of quintuplets that would correspond to our example above48,49. Building on this result, we construct a unitary transformation in the Nambu space that changes the common pair of the two quintuplets, allowing us to exchange the first pair of above quintuplets for the second. This is of practical use, since the second pair of quintuplets has the two superconducting orders in common, with all the other orders appearing being insulators. One can therefore in complete generality consider a fully insulating realization of the (1, 0) + (0, 1) order parameters, and remain in the original (pre-Nambu-doubled) eight-dimensional representation.\nSecond, multicritical behavior has been an important part of general studies of critical phenomena from the beginning. Given two order parameters that transform as vectors under SO(na)\u00d7SO(nb) symmetry, based on high-order perturbative calculations and some nonperturbative arguments50, it is believed today that the bosonic field theory in three dimensions has a decoupled critical point for na + nb > 3, an SO(na + nb)symmetric critical point for na = nb = 1, and a mixedsymmetry (\u201cbiconal\u201d) critical point for na = 1 , nb = 2. To the first order in 4 \u2212 dimension, however, the decoupled fixed point is stable only when na + nb > 8, and the SO(na + nb)-symmetric fixed point is stable for na + nb < 4\n51. The main point is that there always exists a stable (critical) fixed point in the purely bosonic theory for the order parameters. This is in spite of the fixed points moving around with the change of parameters such as , na, and nb, and colliding with each other. The usual annihilation of fixed points and their transfer to the complex plane, relevant to many other field theories52\u201363, does not occur here.\nThe reason for this lies in the structure of the theory itself: (a) when one of the two quartic couplings vanishes and the order parameters decouple, they remain decoupled at all stages of the renormalization group (RG) transformation. This condition defines therefore an RGinvariant line, along which there always exists a WilsonFisher fixed point. (b) When the two quartic couplings have a particular ratio so that the theory acquires an enlarged SO(na + nb) symmetry, it retains it during the RG, so another Wilson-Fisher fixed point always exists on this invariant line as well. Due to the existence of these\ntwo invariant lines with concomitant Wilson-Fisher fixed points on them, the only change with varying the parameters such as the dimension, na, and nb in the theory is the exchange of stability of the two Wilson-Fisher fixed points with the third (biconal) fixed point, the location of which is not fixed by any symmetry. This is in contrast to the generic scenario; in general, when two fixed points collide they develop an imaginary part, and in the space of real (physical) couplings there remains only a runaway flow.57 This is avoided in the SO(na)\u00d7SO(nb)-symmetric bosonic theory only because of the existence of two RGinvariant lines from which the Wilson-Fisher fixed points cannot escape.\nThis crucial feature of the field theory is lost upon coupling to fermions. Since the Dirac fermions couple to both order parameters, the integration over any number of fermions unavoidably couples them. Furthermore, the SO(na + nb) symmetry for special values of the two quartic couplings is immediately violated as well. Hence, there is nothing to protect the fixed points from complexification after a collision, and that is precisely what we find. All four fixed points (including the Gaussian one) move when the parameter na = nb is changed, and in particular the stable (biconal) fixed point collides with the SO(na+nb) fixed point at fairly low number of fermions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss the algebra of Dirac mass order parameters, and perform the unitary transformation onto insulators. In Sec. III we introduce the Gross-NeveuYukawa field theory which features the two triplets of order parameters coupled to Dirac fermions. The RG flow in this theory computed to one-loop near four space-time dimensions is given in Sec. IV. The analysis of the fixed points and their collisions with the change of number of Dirac fermions is provided in Sec. V. Discussion of our results and the summary are given in Sec. VI. Mathematical details of the Clifford-algebraic structure of the mass order parameters of two-dimensional Dirac fermions and the alternative derivation of the RG beta-functions are given in the Appendices."

            "text": "We are interested in the relativistically invariant massterms that can be added to the standard two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian\nH0(~p) = p1\u03b11 + p2\u03b12, (1)\nwhere \u03b1i, i = 1, 2 are two 8\u00d78 Hermitian matrices satisfying the anticommutation relation {\u03b1i, \u03b1j} = 2\u03b4ij . This Hamiltonian represents the low-energy degrees of freedom of spin-1/2 electrons near two inequivalent valleys on graphene\u2019s honeycomb lattice, for example.\nTo have a unified treatment of both insulating (particle-number preserving) and superconducting (particle-number violating) mass-like order parameters\n3 we consider the usual Nambu-doubled Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian\nHBdG = H0(~p)\u2295 (\u2212HT0 (\u2212~p)) = p1\u03931 + p2\u03932, (2)\nwhere \u0393i are now 16\u00d7 16 Hermitian matrices, which still satisfy {\u0393i,\u0393j} = 2\u03b4ij .\nThe algebraic structure of the mass-like orders follows from the following observation: add two compatible (anticommuting) mass-terms of the above BdG Hamiltonian, with two 16 \u00d7 16 Hermitian matrices M1 and M2, such that {Mi,Mj} = 2\u03b4ij , and {Mi,\u0393j} = 0. The Hamiltonian is then\nH = HBdG +m1M1 +m2M2, (3)\nwith the parameters (masses) m1,2 real. The masses can even be taken to be arbitrary functions of space. The group of symmetry of the above Hamiltonian is SO(4)\u2261SO(3)\u00d7SO(3), generated by six 16 \u00d7 16 Hermitian generators Ai and Bi, i = 1, 2, 3, such that {Ai, Aj} = {Bi, Bj} = 2\u03b4ij , and [Ai, Bj ] = 0, cf. Ref. 47. In other words,\n[Ai,\u0393j ] = [Ai,Mj ] = 0, (4)\nand\n[Bi,\u0393j ] = [Bi,Mj ] = 0, (5)\ni = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, 2. This result follows from the theory of real representations of Clifford algebras64 and was derived in Ref. 47, where it was used to reveal the internal structure of the vortex configuration in the masses m1,2. It immediately follows that the two mass-matrices M1,2 can be embedded into the maximal set of five mutually anticommuting mass-matrices47 in two different ways: (1) MA = (M1,M2, AiX), and (2) MB = (M1,M2, BiX), i = 1, 2, 3. Here, the matrix X is defined as X = \u03931\u03932M1M2, so that it anticommutes with the matrices present in H: {X,Mi} = {X,\u0393i} = 0. This in turn implies that the Clifford algebra generated by the seven matrices CA = (\u0393i,MA) (CB = (\u0393i,MB)) is quaternionic64, i.e. that besides the unity matrix it has three additional Casimir operators Bi (Ai). More details of this construction were given in Ref. 47, and are here provided in App. A.\nFor our current purposes the crucial fact is that the two sets of mass-matrices AiX and BiX, which share a common pair (M1,M2) in their respective quintuplets MA and MB , commute, i.e.\n[AiX,BjX] = 0, (6)\nand transform as (1, 0)+(0, 1) representation of the above group SO(4). The inverse is also true: given two triplets of mutually anticommuting mass matrices such that any two matrices from different triplets commute, they always are completed by the same and unique pair of mass\nmatrices to their respective quintuplets. The above algebraic structure of the mass terms is thus a universal characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac equation for spin-1/2 particles on a bipartite lattice.\nAn important corollary is that the six order parameters in the (1, 0)+(0, 1) representation can always be assumed to be insulating. To show this, let us be specific, and choose\nCA = (\u03931,\u03932,K1,K2, C, S1, S2), (7)\nwith K1,2 being two matrices for the Kekule\u0301 bonddensity-wave orders, C for the charge-density-wave, and S1,2 for the two components of the s-wave superconducting order. The main assumption is that two (S1 and S2) out of five mass matrices in the algebra are two components of the same superconducting mass order parameter. The second algebra that contains (\u03931,\u03932,K1,K2) as a sub-algebra is then\nCB = (\u03931,\u03932,K1,K2, N1, N2, N3). (8)\nWe can identify one of the Casimir operators of CB as A1 = iS1S2, which rotates between two components of the superconducting order parameter, and thus is nothing but the particle number. Therefore, the massmatrices Ni, i = 1, 2, 3 satisfy [Ni, A1] = 0, and represent insulators70.\nLet us now perform the unitary transformation using\nU = ei \u03c0 4 [iK1S1+iK2S2], (9)\nwhich simply reshuffles the elements of the first Clifford algebra\nCA \u2192 UCAU\u2020 = (\u03931,\u03932, S1, S2, C,K1,K2).\nThe second Clifford algebra then transforms as\nCB \u2192 UCBU\u2020 = (\u03931,\u03932, S1, S2, Y1, Y2, Y3),\nwith some new mass-matrices Yi, given by Yi = UNiU \u2020. Since {Yi, S1} = {Yi, S2} = 0, it readily follows that\n[Yi, iS1S2] = 0 . (10)\nSince the matrix iS1S2 is the particle number operator, however, the three masses Yi evidently represent insulating order parameters71. The upshot is that in the 16\u00d716 BdG representation,\nU(HBdG + a1C + a2S1 + a3S2 + biNi)U \u2020\n= HBdG + a1C + a2K1 + a3K2 + biYi, (11)\nwith all six order parameters on the right-hand-side of the last equation representing insulators. The right-handside is then block-diagonal, and the Nambu doubling can be disposed of. The general two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian with two sets of mass-order-parameters that transform as (1, 0)+(0, 1) representation of the SO(4) can therefore simply be taken to be 8\u00d7 8 matrix.\n4"

This setup allows for an introduction of an additional matrix \u03b2 that obeys\n{\u03b2, \u03b1i} = 0 \u2200 i , and \u03b22 = 1 , (14)\nand we define all matrices \u03b1i, \u03b2 as Hermitian.

For general quadratic and quartic interaction parameters {ra, rb, \u03bba, \u03bbb, \u03bbab}, the Lagrangian Lab has SO(na)\u00d7SO(nb) symmetry. For \u03bbab = 0, the order parameters ~a and ~b are decoupled in Lab, and for ra = rb and \u03bba = \u03bbb = \u03bbab, the Lagrangian Lab acquires a larger SO(na + nb) symmetry.\nFor the remainder of this work, we restrict the number of bosonic field components in each order parameter to maximally three, i.e. na, nb \u2264 3, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The blue and the red lines are the points where the two beta-functions vanish, and the dashed gray line denotes \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb, where the theory becomes O(6)symmetric.\nLet us be on the critical surface ra = rb = 0, and for simplicity of presentation restrict the remaining quartic couplings \u03bb = \u03bba = \u03bbb, and \u03bb\n\u2032 = \u03bbab. The fixed-point coordinates then read \u03bb = 0, \u03bb\u2032 = 0 (GFP), \u03bb = 44 , \u03bb \u2032 = 0 (DFP), \u03bb = 56 , \u03bb \u2032 = 56 (IFP), and \u03bb = 3 136 , \u03bb\n\u2032 = 136 (BFP), see left panel of Fig. 1. To determine the stability of the fixed points, we calculate the stability matrix and evaluate it at the fixed points. The stability matrix of a fixed point (\u03bb\u2217, \u03bb \u2032 \u2217) is defined as\nS = ( \u2202\u03b2\u03bb \u2202\u03bb \u2202\u03b2\u03bb\u2032 \u2202\u03bb\n\u2202\u03b2\u03bb \u2202\u03bb\u2032 \u2202\u03b2\u03bb\u2032 \u2202\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 (\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032)\u2192(\u03bb\u2217,\u03bb\u2032\u2217) , (22)\nand its eigenvalues determine the stability of the respective fixed point, i.e. a positive eigenvalue corresponds to an infrared repulsive (unstable, relevant) direction, and a negative eigenvalue corresponds to an infrared attractive (stable, irrelevant) direction of the RG flow. (The parameters ra and rb that have been set to zero correspond of course to relevant directions.) Therefore, a stable fixed point needs both eigenvalues (\u03b81, \u03b82) of its stability matrix S to be negative.\nWe calculate the stability of the bosonic fixed points as listed above and find that the BFP is the only stable fixed point at one-loop, with the eigenvalues \u03b81 = \u2212 , \u03b82 = \u2212 /17. It is well known, however, that the oneloop calculation significantly overestimates the regime of stability of the BFP, as well as of the IFP for smaller number of bosonic field components. In a higher-order calculation it eventually turns out that in a O(na)\u2295O(nb) theory of two coupled bosonic order parameters, the DFP is stable for na + nb & 4, cf. Ref. 50.\nWe now take a closer look at the fixed points in the purely bosonic theory, which will be helpful once we include the fermions. The fixed points are defined by the equations\n\u03b2\u03bb = 0 , and \u03b2\u03bb\u2032 = 0 . (23)\nThe first equation defines an ellipse, shown in red in the right panel of Fig. 1. The second equation can be readily\nfactorized to read\n\u03b2\u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb \u2032( \u2212 16\u03bb\u2032 \u2212 40\u03bb) , (24)\nwhich defines two straight lines, i.e.\n\u03bb\u2032 = 0, \u03bb\u2032 = ( \u2212 40\u03bb)/16 , (25)\nas shown in blue in Fig. 1. The fixed points to this order of calculation are therefore given by the four intersections of the two straight lines with the ellipse. Furthermore, one intersection of the second straight line and the ellipse also lies on the line \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 (dashed gray line in Fig. 1).\nHigher-loop corrections to the flow would deform the ellipse and the second straight line, but still keep one of their intersections at the \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 SO(6)-symmetric line. \u03bb\u2032 = 0 also remains a solution of \u03b2\u03bb\u2032 = 0 at all orders of calculation. So the IFP and DFP always exist somewhere on these two straight RG-invariant lines. The only fixed point not constrained by the symmetries is the BFP, which can pass through IFP and DFP with a change of parameters, but cannot annihilate them.\nB. Inclusion of fermions for na = nb\nThe above geometrical picture behind the fixed points of the RG flow changes when fermions are included, as we discuss next, still focusing on the the case of SO(3)\u00d7SO(3) symmetry, i.e. na = nb = 3. We also assume g2a = g 2 b = g\n2. In this case, the ellipse is slightly deformed, but the main change is the avoidance of the crossing of the two straight lines of the solutions of \u03b2\u03bb\u2032(Nf = 0) = 0 due to the term \u221d Nfg4i , cf. Eq. (21). The resulting picture is presented in Fig. 2 for four different choices of Nf .\nIncreasing the number of fermions Nf starting from Nf = 0, we first observe that the positions of the intersections resulting from Eq. (23), i.e. the fixed points, approach each other until they collide at some Nf . This holds for both pairs of intersections originating from the purely bosonic fixed points, i.e. the pair {IFP, BFP} and the pair {GFP, DFP}. For the collision of the first pair, we numerically find Nf,c \u2248 0.0164, so that for Nf,0 > Nf > Nf,c there is no stable fixed point. The second pair collides at Nf,0 \u2248 1.485.\nTo further explore the landscape of fixed-point solutions of the model, we treat the number of bosonic components na = nb = n as a free variable and keep the parameter constraints, i.e. ra = rb, \u03bba = \u03bbb, ga = gb. To be explicit, we show the RG \u03b2 functions that can be extracted directly from Eqs. (17) to (21) as\n\u03b2g2 = g 2 \u2212 2(Nf + n+ 2)g4 , (26)\n\u03b2\u03bb = \u03bb\u2212 4(n+ 8)\u03bb2 \u2212 4n\u03bb\u20322 \u2212 4Nf\u03bbg2 +Nfg4 , (27)\n\u03b2\u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb \u2032 \u2212 16\u03bb\u20322\u22128(2+n)\u03bb\u03bb\u2032\u22124Nf\u03bb\u2032g2+3Nfg4 .

The faint dashed lines represent the case without fermions, Nf = 0, and are shown for comparison.\nthe first fixed-point collision after which the stable fixed point\u2019s coordinates acquire an imaginary part. Therefore, no stable real fixed-point solution exists for the theory at Nf = 2, at least at leading order in the epsilon expansion. Consequently, the system is not expected to feature true quantum critical behavior.\nOur results are in conflict with the numerical findings and the renormalization group analysis in Ref. 45. The difference in the RG results can be traced back to the fermionic contribution in Eq. (21), i.e. the term 3Nfg 2 ag 2 b which is reported with a different prefactor in Ref. 45. We have carefully checked our present calculation, and also confirmed that our results are in agreement with earlier works, cf. Refs. 40 and 42. An independent argument corroborating our finding is also presented in App. B.\nWe also note that for the special case of n = 1 there is an admissible fixed point for all Nf . Here, the Yukawa coupling has the fixed-point value g2\u2217 = /(6 + 2Nf ) and the bosonic couplings have the values\n\u03bb\u2217 = 3\u2212Nf +\n\u221a 9 +Nf (66 +Nf )\n144(3 +Nf ) , (29)\n\u03bb\u2032\u2217 = 3\u2212Nf +\n\u221a 9 +Nf (66 +Nf )\n48(3 +Nf ) . (30)\nThis fixed point is stable. For example, for Nf = 1 we find \u03b81 \u2248 \u22120.39 , \u03b82 = \u2212 , \u03b83 \u2248 \u22122.18 .

            "text": "The full system with two coupled and competing order parameters has a larger coupling constant space than the one we studied so far. In fact, it allows the two Yukawa couplings and also the two quartic couplings to be different. In that case the relevant RG equations are Eqs. (17) \u2013 (21), which feature a stable fixed-point solution, in contrast to the constrained system.\nTo analyze the fixed points we start with the flow of the two Yukawa couplings, since this subset of flow equations is independent of the quartic couplings. The subset of Yukawa beta-functions has four different fixed-point solutions Yi, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}, reading\nY1 : g 2 a = 0, g 2 b = 0 , (31)\nY2 : g 2 a = 0, g 2 b =\n1\n4 + 2Nf \u2212 nb , (32)\nY3 : g 2 a =\n1\n4 + 2Nf \u2212 na , g2b = 0 , (33)\nand Y4 with the Yukawa couplings\ng2a = 2nb \u2212Nf \u2212 2\nna(2+4nb+Nf )+(2+Nf )(nb\u22124\u22122Nf ) , (34)\ng2b = 2na \u2212Nf \u2212 2\nna(2+4nb+Nf )+(2+Nf )(nb\u22124\u22122Nf ) . (35)\nFixed point Y4 is the one that has been studied before in the SO(n)\u00d7SO(n) system, i.e. when na = nb and we enforced g2a = g 2 b . We can determine the stability matrix in the Yukawa subsector and diagonalize it. There we\n7 find that for Y4 the two eigenvalues are\n\u03b8g,1 = \u2212 , (36) \u03b8g,2 = 2(2\u2212 2na +Nf )(2\u2212 2nb +Nf )\nna(2+4nb+Nf )+(2+Nf )(nb\u22124\u22122Nf ) (37)\nFor Nf = 2 and na = nb, we find \u03b8g,2 = 2 na\u22122 na+4\n, so for na > 2 this fixed point is necessarily unstable, as \u03b8g,2 > 0.\nWe next leaveNf and na as free parameters, fix nb = 3, and consider Y2. The eigenvalues of the stability matrix are\nY2 : \u03b8g,1 = \u2212 , \u03b8g,2 = 2 Nf \u2212 4 1 + 2Nf . (38)\nForNf < 4, we find \u03b8g,2 < 0 and therefore this fixed point is potentially stable, provided that the bosonic sector also admits a stable solution. It turns out that this actually is the case and the fixed point coordinates of this stable fixed point in the bosonic sector read\n\u03bba = 4(na + 8) , \u03bbab = 0 , (39)\n\u03bbb = 1\u2212 2Nf +\n\u221a 1 + 4Nf (43 +Nf )\n88(1 + 2Nf ) . (40)\nWe note that this is in complete agreement with the findings in Ref. 40 upon setting na = 1. Diagonalization of the complete stability matrix for all five couplings provides three additional eigenvalues which are\n\u03b8\u03bb,1 = \u2212 , \u03b8\u03bb,2 = \u2212 1 + 4Nf (43 +Nf )\n1 + 2Nf , (41)\n\u03b8\u03bb,3 = 6\nna+8 \u2212\n5+34Nf + 5 \u221a 1+4Nf (43+Nf )\n22 + 44Nf . (42)\nThe first two are clearly negative. We evaluate the last one for Nf = 2 to find\n\u03b8\u03bb,3(na) = (\u2212 84\n55 +\n6\nna + 8 ) , (43)\nwhich is negative for na = 1, 2, 3, i.e. \u03b8\u03bb,3(1) = \u2212142/165, \u03b8\u03bb,3(2) = \u221251/55, \u03b8\u03bb,3(3) = \u221254/55. Therefore, this represents the stable fixed point of the RG flow, including the case when na = nb = 3, i.e. the SO(3)\u00d7SO(3) symmetry we are most interested in.\nFor the further discussion, we proceed with the concrete case of na = nb = 3 and recall that \u2013 at least at one-loop order \u2013 the stable fixed point is the one with Y2 in the Yukawa subsector and which is decoupled in the bosonic sector. That means that at the fixed point, the ~a field completely decouples from both, the fermions and the ~b field (this is true for any na = 1, 2, 3). Therefore, this sector of the model belongs to the purely bosonic Heisenberg universality class whereas the sector with the fermions and the ~b field belongs to the chiral Heisenberg universality class. In fact, the critical exponents for these\ntwo universality classes are known beyond the leadingorder expansion66,67. The correlation length exponent for the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class is very precisely known to be \u03bda = 0.712, cf. Refs. 51. The value of the correlation length exponent for the chiral Heisenberg universality class is less certain, with estimates laying in the range 0.84 < \u03bdb < 1.31, cf. Ref. 14.\nEmploying Aharony\u2019s scaling relation50,51 we can deduce the RG eigenvalue for the mixed quartic coupling that would couple the ~a and ~b fields at the decoupled fixed point. The scaling dimension of the mixed quartic coupling reads\n\u03b8ab = 1\n\u03bda +\n1 \u03bdb \u2212D , (44)\nwhere D is the space-time dimension. For the decoupled fixed point to be stable \u03b8ab needs to be negative. In leading-order expansion, we find that 1\u03bda = 2\u2212 na+2 na+8 = 2 \u2212 511 and 1 \u03bdb\n= 2 \u2212 8455 . Insertion into the expression above yields\n\u03b8ab = 2\u2212 5 11 + 2\u2212 84 55 \u2212 (4\u2212 ) = \u221254 55 , (45)\nat the leading order in -expansion. As a check, we observe that this value indeed coincides with \u03b8\u03bb,3(na = 3) from Eq. (43).\nUsing the best current estimates for 1/\u03bda,b from other methods, we find in D = 3\n\u03b8ab \u2248 1\n0.712 +\n1 \u03bdb \u2212 3 \u2208 [\u22120.83,\u22120.41] . (46)\nThe scaling dimension \u03b8ab seems therefore likely to be negative and the coupling \u03bbab irrelevant even at higher orders, supporting the scenario where the Heisenberg+chiral Heisenberg fixed point would remain stable beyond one loop. What is still missing to corroborate the stability of the Heisenberg+chiral Heisenberg fixed point is an argument for the RG scaling of the (vanishing) Yukawa coupling g2a.\nWe note that for na = nb, the situation is somewhat special: In that case the fixed points Y2 and Y3 are identical upon exchange of the labels a \u2194 b. Therefore, Y3 also has to be a stable fixed point if Y2 is stable. We explore this stability property in the Yukawa couplings for various configurations of na = nb = n \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, see Fig. 4. Interestingly, for n = 1 the fixed point Y4 is stable and for n = 3 the fixed points Y2, Y3 are stable. For n = 2, the fixed points Y2, Y3, Y4 all have a marginal direction in the RG flow.\nFor the case of na = nb = 1, Nf = 2 it is therefore interesting to also look at the possible fixed points and their stability in the bosonic sector. There we find a stable fixed point with coordinates\n\u03bba = 1 + \u221a 145\n720 = \u03bbb, \u03bbab =\n1 + \u221a 145\n240 .

            "text": "We have employed a one-loop renormalization-group approach to study the quantum multicritical behavior in a generalized Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for Dirac fermions coupled to two order-parameter fields. This work was partly motivated by the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) study of the lattice Hamiltonian presented in Ref. 45, where the quantum phase transition between a Nf = 2 Dirac fermion phase and a massive phase including a Ne\u0301el state and a superconductor-CDW state was investigated. Therein, a scaling collapse of the QMC data is found at critical coupling strength, providing evidence for a continuous quantum phase transition with a concomitant quantum critical point.\nUniversality suggests that this putative quantum critical point is described by the constrained continuum field theory studied in our Sec. V B. As we have shown, however, there is no stable fixed point for n = 3 and Nf = 2, i.e. the numerical findings appear to be incompatible with the universal continuum field theory. We therefore conclude that either (1) the lattice Hamiltonian of Ref. 45 should be described by a different continuum field theory, (2) the leading-order perturbative RG approach presented here is insufficient to capture the underlying fixedpoint structure, or (3) the QMC data actually exhibits a (very) weak first-order transition, which only appears to be continuous.\nAbout point (1), we can say that the continuum theory is constructed such that it shares the full O(4) symmetry of the lattice Hamiltonian, cf. Ref. 45. A different continuum theory should also fulfill that minimal requirement, which imposes a strong constraint. One possibility could be that topological contributions appear in the lattice realization, while they are not reflected in the present continuum setup. Option (2) would also be interesting since examples where the one-loop order fails to capture the general fixed-point structure of a model are rare. Possibilities for further studies include higher-order epsilon expansions, but also a large-Nf study at leading order.\nThe latter seems promising since at large Nf \u223c O(10) fermionic contributions in beta-function dominate and the critical point reappears68. An unusually large order parameter\u2019s anomalous dimension detected in Ref. 45 may be an indication of the appropriateness of the largeNf approach, in which \u03b7\u03c8 = 1 + O(1/Nf ). Finally, it may be computationally expensive to decide on the option (3), as weakly first-order and continuous transitions are naturally difficult to distinguish. Weakly first-order transitions are expected to appear in a number of spin systems. In the present context it would seem to require that the critical number of fermions for the disappearance of the stable fixed point Nf,c is below but closer to the physical number Nf = 2 than what we found. Higher order calculations may be able to shed more light on the matter."

Since P has the property P 2 = +1, there exists a representation where P = K, with K being complex conjugation, and P with a trivial unitary part. In this special basis, the 16\u00d716 BdG Hamiltonian reads\nH = p1R1 + p2R2 , (A1)\n9 where ~p = (p1, p2) = \u2212i\u2207 is the usual momentum operator, odd under P , and R1, R2 are two real Hermitian (symmetric) 16\u00d7 16 matrices with the anticommuting property\n{Ri, Rj} = 2\u03b4ij , i, j \u2208 {1, 2} . (A2)\nThe largest Clifford algebra that has a 16\u00d716 representation is\nC(5, 4) = (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, I1, I2, I3, I4) , (A3)\nwhere the Ri, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are real and Ij , j \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4} are fully imaginary (antisymmetric). All matrices Ri, Ij are hereafter chosen to be Hermitian, and to square to +1. They all also mutually anticommute.\nThe Clifford algebra C(n,m) is here defined as a set of n+m mutually anticommuting Hermitian generators which all square to +1, and are such that the first n are real, and the remaining m are imaginary. Note that this is a slight modification of the standard definitions as, e.g., given in Ref.64, where the fully real representation of C(n,m) are studied, at the cost of the last m elements being multiplied with an imaginary unit, and therefore taken as anti-Hermitian. In consequence the last m matrices in our definition square to +1 instead of \u22121, while preserving the nature of the representation. The difference between the two conventions reflects the difference between Minkowski and Euclidian spaces typically employed in particle and condensed matter physics.\nIn the present context of the 16\u00d716 massive Dirac BdG Hamiltonian in two spatial dimensions, we have n = 2, and then m = 5 sets the maximal number of compatible (anticommuting) masses.47 This is because one can construct the Clifford algebra\nC(2, 5) = (R1, R2, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5) , (A4)\nwith I5 = iR5R4R3, with I \u2020 5 = I5 and I 2 5 = +1. This algebra can be used to write the massive BdG-Dirac Hamiltonian with five mutually anticommuting mass terms, i.e.\nHBdG = p1R1 + p2R2 + 5\u2211 i=1 miIi , (A5)\nwhere the mi \u2208 R, with the spectrum ~p,\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u221a p21 + p 2 2 +m 2 1 +m 2 2 +m 2 3 +m 2 4 +m 2 5 . (A6)\nNote that this Hamiltonian anticommutes with the particle-hole operator P , as it should, because the parameters {mi} are real and therefore even under P , whereas the momentum ~p is odd. The full summary of the dimensions and the nature of real irreducible representations of Clifford algebras provided in Ref. 47 implies then that there cannot be more than five mutually anticommuting mass-terms that can be added to HBdG. The C(2, 5) is thus and the maximal Clifford algebra relevant to spin1/2 Dirac fermions in two dimensions.\nAn interesting fact about this algebra is that it is quaternionic64. In our convention this means that, besides unit matrix, it allows for three additional Casimir operators\n(A1, A2, A3) = (iR3R4, iR4R5, iR5R3) , (A7)\nwhich evidently commute with all seven matrices in C(2, 5). The three Ai close an SO(3) Lie algebra, mutually anticommute, and are imaginary and Hermitian.\nThis observation can be used to derive the central result quoted in the main text as follows. Take a subalgebra of the above C(2, 5) to be\nC(2, 2) = (R1, R2, I1, I2) . (A8)\nThen there exists precisely one other triplet besides (I3, I4, I5) which may be used to complete this subalgebra to the maximal, but different, C(2, 5). This new triplet will transform as a vector under the above SO(3) algebra of Casimir operators, and it reads\n(A1X,A2X,A3X) with X = R1R2I1I2 .\nThese three matrices are also all imaginary, Hermitian, and square to +1. We thus found another maximal C(2, 5) algebra which contains the same subalgebra {R1, R2, I1, I2} as the first one. Explicitly, it reads\nCA(2, 5) = (R1, R2, I1, I2, A1X,A2X,A3X) .\nTo distinguish it from the first one we added an index A in CA(2, 5), and we refer to the first one as CB(2, 5) hereafter. CA(2, 5) and CB(2, 5) share the same subalgebra C(2, 2) = (R1, R2, I1, I2). CA(2, 5) is of course also quaternionic, and the three non-trivial Casimirs are simply\n(B1, B2, B3) = (iI3I4, iI4I5, iI5I3) (A9)\nBi are also Hermitian and mutually anticommuting, and provide another imaginary representation of SO(3) Lie algebra.\nIn sum, given the 16\u00d716 representation of C(2, 2) as (R1, R2, I1, I2), there are two different ways to complete it to the maximal Clifford algebra C(2, 5):\n1. CB(2, 5) = (R1, R2, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5), with Casimir operators Ai, [Ai, CB(2, 5)] = 0, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3},\n2. CA(2, 5) = (R1, R2, I1, I2, A1X,A2X,A3X) with Casimir operators Bi, [Bi, CA(2, 5)]=0,i\u2208 {1, 2, 3}.\nThe two vectors (A1X,A2X,A3X) and (I3, I4, I5) are a (1, 0) + (0, 1) representation of the SO(3)\u00d7SO(3) algebra of Casimirs, which are\n(iR3R4, iR4R5,iR5R3, iI3I4, iI4I5, iI5I3)\n= (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3) , (A10)\n10\nwith [Ai, Bj ] = 0. In other words, the algebra C(2, 2) = (R1, R2, I1, I2) has the SO(4)'SO(3)\u00d7SO(3) algebra of Casimirs.\nOne can also summarize the above discussion by noting that\nR5 = R1R2R3R4I1I2I3I4\n\u21d2 B1X = I5, B2X = I3, B3X = I4 . (A11)\nSo the Clifford algebra C(2, 2) = (R1, R2, I1, I2), has the SO(4) Lie algebra of Casimir operators\n( ~A, ~B) = (iR3R4, iR4R5, iR5R3, iI3I4, iI4I5, iI5I3)\n= SO(3)\u00d7 SO(3) . (A12)\n( ~AX, ~BX) with X = R1R2I1I2 then transforms as (1, 0) + (0, 1) representation of this SO(4) Lie algebra. Finally,\nCA(2, 5) = C(2, 2) + ( ~AX),\nCB(2, 5) = C(2, 2) + ( ~BX),\nare the two maximal Clifford algebras that contain the original C(2, 2). This was quoted in the text.\nTransformation\nSay we are given the two maximal Clifford algebras CA(2, 5) and CB(2, 5) with the common subalgebra C(2, 2) = (R1, R2, I1, I2). We can construct two Clifford algebras with any other pair of imaginary matrices from CA(2, 5) (or CB(2, 5)) being common as follows:\nDefine\nU = ei \u03c0 4 [iI1(A1X)+iI2(A2X)] . (A13)\nIts action on CA(2, 5) is as follows:\n1. URiU \u2020 = Ri, i \u2208 {1, 2}\n2. UI1U \u2020 = ei \u03c0 4 iI1A1XI1e \u2212i\u03c04 iI1A1X\n= ei \u03c0 2 iI1A1XI1 =\u2212 ( sin \u03c02 ) I1A1XI1 = A1X\n3. UI2U \u2020 = A2X\n4. UA1XU \u2020 = \u2212I1\n5. UA2XU \u2020 = \u2212I2\n6. UA3XU \u2020 = A3X\nThe net result is the same set of matrices but with exchanges of I1 \u2194 A1X, I2 \u2194 A2X. The action on the matrices in CB(2, 5), on the other hand, is\n1. URiU \u2020 = Ri, i \u2208 {1, 2}\n2. UI1U \u2020 = A1X\n3. UI2U \u2020 = A2X\n4. UBiXU \u2020\n=ei \u03c0 4 (iI1A1X)ei \u03c0 4 (iI2A2X)BiXe \u2212i\u03c04 (iI2A2X)e\u2212i \u03c0 4 (iI1A1X) =ei \u03c0 4 (iI1A1X) [\u2212I2A2XBiX] e\u2212i \u03c0 4 (iI1A1X) = \u2212I1(A1X)(\u2212)I2A2XBiX = I1A1XI2A2Bi(X\n2) = \u2212I1A1I2A2BiX = \u2212I1I2A1A2BiX = \u2212iI1I2A3BiX.\nSo, we obtain\nCB(2, 5)\u2192 UCB(2, 5)U\u2020\n= (R1, R2, A1X,A2X, iI1I2A3BiX) , (A14)\nwith i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Let us make couple of remarks.\n1. The matrices iI1I2A3BiX are imaginary, since X is real and I1, I2, A3, Bi are imaginary.\n2. {Ri, iI1I2A3BiX} = 0, because Ri, i \u2208 {1, 2} commutes with iI1I2, A3, and Bi, but anticommutes with X = R1R2I1I2.\n3. {AiX, iI1I2A3BiX} = 0, since AiX, i \u2208 {1, 2} commutes with iI1I2 and BiX, but anticommutes with A3.\n4. iI1I2A3BiX mutually anticommute, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}.\nThe final result of the transformation is that\nCA(2, 5)\u2192 UCA(2, 5)U\u2020 = CA(2, 5) = (R1, R2, I1, I2, AiX) , (A15) CB(2, 5)\u2192 UCB(2, 5)U\u2020\n= (R1, R2, A1X,A2X, iI1I2A3BiX) , (A16)\nso that the transformed Cliffod algebras have the imaginary (mass) matrices (A1X,A2X) in common, besides the real matrices (R1, R2), of course. Again, the matrices from the two different remaining triplets (I1, I2, A3) and (iI1I2A3BiX) commute between themselves.\nIn the original notation, we obtain the relation: if CB(2, 5) = (R1, R2, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5) and UCB(2, 5)U\n\u2020 = (R1, R2, I3, I4, I1, I2, I5), then for UCB(2, 5)U \u2020 the Casimir SO(3) algebra is ~A = (iR3R4, iR4R5, iR5R3). Since X \u2192 UXU\u2020 = R1R2I3I4, so that the matrices ~AX = (iRkI1I2), k \u2208 {5, 3, 4}. So, we find that for UCA(2, 5)U\n\u2020 = {R1, R2, I3, I4, iRkI1I2}, k \u2208 {5, 3, 4} and the new (1, 0) + (0, 1) representation is\n(I1, I2, I5) + (iRkI1I2; k = 3, 4, 5) . (A17)\nAgain, all matrices in the first set commute with matrices in the second set, as it should be.\n11"

The general structure for the \u03b2 functions of g2i , \u03bbi, \u03bbab where i \u2208 {a, b} reads\n\u03b2g2i = ( \u2212 \u03b7i \u2212 2\u03b7\u03c8) g 2 i + cgi,1g 4 i + cgi,2g 2 ag 2 b , (B1)\n\u03b2\u03bbi = ( \u2212 2\u03b7i)\u03bbi+c\u03bbi,1\u03bb2i +c\u03bbi,2\u03bb2ab+c\u03bbi,3Nfg4i , (B2) \u03b2\u03bbab = ( \u2212 \u03b7a \u2212 \u03b7b)\u03bbab + c\u03bbab,1\u03bb2ab\n+c\u03bbab,2\u03bba\u03bbab+c\u03bbab,3\u03bbb\u03bbab+c\u03bbab,4Nfg 2 ag 2 b , (B3)\nwhere, from the general point of view, the coefficients ci,j and the rescaling coefficients \u03b7\u03c8, \u03b7i, i \u2208 {a, b} are undetermined at first.\nFor a model where the bosonic sector features a O(na)\u2295O(nb) symmetry, the coefficients c\u03bbi,j , i \u2208 {a, b}, j \u2208 {1, 2} and c\u03bbab,i, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} are well known from statistical models, see, e.g., Ref. 50. They read\nc\u03bba,1 = \u22124(na + 8), c\u03bbb,1 = \u22124(nb + 8) , (B4) c\u03bba,2 = \u22124nb, c\u03bbb,2 = \u22124na , (B5) c\u03bbab,1 = \u221216, c\u03bbab,2 = \u22124(na + 2) , (B6) c\u03bbab,3 = \u22124(nb + 2) . (B7)\nWe now restrict ourselves to the case where the Dirac mass terms related to the bosonic fields \u03c6i have anticommuting components and the same for \u03c7j , but \u03c6i and \u03c7j do not have to be mutually anticommuting. The rescaling coefficients \u03b7i, i \u2208 {a, b} are related to the wave function renormalizations of the bosons and at a fixed point they correspond to the boson anomalous dimensions. Diagrammatically, they are given by the one-loop diagram of the boson propagator with the closed fermion loop providing a factor of Nf . The expression for \u03b7i is well known, cf. Ref. 42, again\n\u03b7i = 2Nfg 2 i , i \u2208 {a, b} (B8)\nAlso \u03b7\u03c8 is known from the one-loop diagram of the fermion propagator42. Here, all boson components contribute additively\n\u03b7\u03c8 = 1\n2 nag\n2 a +\n1 2 nbg 2 b . (B9)\nNext, we consider the Yukawa couplings and the corresponding coefficients cgi,1 and cgi,2. The first coefficient, cg,1, is the one obtained from consideration of a Yukawa system with a coupling to a single order parameter, e.g., a\nNe\u0301el state or a CDW. It can also be inferred from Ref. 42 and it reads\ncgi,1 = 2(ni \u2212 2) i \u2208 {a, b} . (B10) Furthermore, we can use the RG flow equations from the single order parameter case to extract c\u03bbi,3,\nc\u03bbi,3 = 1 i \u2208 {a, b} . (B11)\nNow, the second Yukawa coefficients cgi,2 are not that obvious because they depend on the mutual anticommuting properties of the two different order parameters \u03c6 and \u03c7. Here, to connect to the work in Ref. 45, we can exploit our own RG flow equations from Ref. 40, where we considered the competition between the Ne\u0301el and the CDW state which corresponds to the case na = 3, nb = 1. The diagram corresponding to the coefficients cgi,2 is the one where the internal bosonic line is contributed from the order parameter that is not the external bosonic line of the considered Yukawa vertex. Therefore, the diagram for vertex ga comes with multiplicity nb and vice versa. The remaining factor is fixed by consideration of the contribution to the Ne\u0301el and CDW Yukawa coupling in Ref. 40. We find\ncga,2 = \u22122nb, cgb,2 = \u22122na . (B12)\nThe only coefficient left to fix is now c\u03bbab,4. It follows from the corresponding equation (Eq. (16)) in Ref. 40 because of the same anticommuting properties of the Yukawa vertices for the considered bosonic components. We find\nc\u03bbab,4 = 3 . (B13)\nWith this, all the coefficients are determined and the set of flow equations is complete. Putting all that together and slightly rearranging for better comparison, we obtain the following set of equations given as Eqs. (17) to (21) in the main text.\nFinally, we note that the beta functions for the quartic couplings differ in the fermionic loop contribution \u221d g4, which is particularly obvious when considering the constrained system where ra = rb, \u03bb = \u03bba = \u03bbb, \u03bb\n\u2032 = \u03bbab, and g2a = g 2 b = g\n2, cf. Eqs. (27) \u2013 (28). As a consequence, in the presence of fermions, the theory does not have an SO(6) symmetry even at one-loop level. To see this more directly, we can diagonalize the matrix\nY = ~a \u00b7 ~\u03c3 \u2297 I + I\u2297~b \u00b7 ~\u03c3 , (B14)\nwhich appears in the Yukawa coupling and which determines the loop contributions to the quartic couplings. The eigenvalues of Y are \u00b1(a\u00b1b). Expanding the fermion determinant for each component separately leads to a quartic term in the form\n\u223c (a+ b)4 + (a\u2212 b)4 = (a4 + 4a3b+ 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4) +(a4\u22124a3b+ 6a2b2\u22124ab3+b4)\n= 2(a4 + b4 + 6a2b2) .\nHere, we see how a relative factor of 6 arises in the betafunctions for the couplings \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032.\n12\n1 I.
