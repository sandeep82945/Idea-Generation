    "abstractText": "In this article a novel mechanism for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and the ensuing appearance of fermion mass terms in the action is proposed. The action contains massless fermions of the standard model coupled to gravity through a new type of nonminimal coupling to the vielbein field. The corresponding coupling constants in our approach become zero-dimension scalar fields. Such scalar fields provide the cancellation of the Weyl anomaly [Latham Boyle and Neil Turok, arXiv:2110.06258].",

The corresponding coupling constants in our approach become zero-dimension scalar fields.

INTRODUCTION\nIn this article a novel mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking, thus leading to the appearance of fermion mass terms in the action, is put forward. The assumed action contains the full set of standard model (SM) fermions coupled to gravity through a new type of nonminimal coupling to the vielbein field. In contrast to the fermionvielbein coupling via a constant term [1], we promote this coupling from a constant to being an actual field in its own right. Correspondingly, additional distinct scalar fields are introduced in the theory that furnish a set of coupling coefficients between the various different flavors of SM fermions to the vielbein. Adding scalar fields to the SM action is known to imply the cancellation of the Weyl anomaly [2]. We propose an action made up from the SM fermions coupled to the vielbein and fundamental scalar fields that (i) are the very coupling coefficients between the SM fermions and the vielbein, (ii) lead directly to the appearance of mass terms of the fermions, and (iii) generate a theory with a vanishing Weyl anomaly. This stands as a new model of the composite Higgs boson. The Higgs boson itself has a rich history, beginning with the discovery that the Higgs mechanism [3\u20138] is responsible for the presence of mass terms in the SM, where the introduction of the Higgs boson in the action spontaneously breaks local symmetries thus ascribing mass terms to the massive bosons and fermions. Explicitly, the SM comprises the SU\u00f03\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de gauge model of strong and electroweak interactions [9\u201314]. Through the Higgs\nmechanism the electroweak SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7U\u00f01\u00de group is spontaneously broken down to the U\u00f01\u00de symmetry of electromagnetism [3,6,7,15\u201317]. Couplings of the elementary Higgs scalar bosons also break quark and lepton chiralflavor symmetries, giving rise to hard mass terms for the quarks and leptons. The Higgs boson itself has been detected as the scalar excitation with a mass found at 125 GeV [18\u201323], consistent with theoretical predictions. Despite the success of the Higgs mechanism, the model admits a number of ambiguities [24]; perhaps the most striking one is the triviality of the model with fundamental scalar fields, as well an emerging hierarchy problem with vastly disparate energy scales in the theory, and more. This led to the question, if indeed the Higgs is a new fundamental particle of the SM in its own right, or rather is the Higgs itself composed of known fundamental particles of the SM? Composite Higgs models began with the suggestion by Terazawa et al. that due to its large mass, the top quark is a natural candidate for being a constituent of the composite Higgs boson [25,26]. In 1989, the original top-quark condensate model of Terazawa et al. was revived by Miransky, Tanabashi, Yamawaki, and later by Bardeen et al. [27\u201330], who proposed the top-quark condensate as a means of electroweak symmetry breaking. In this approach the Higgs is composite at short distance scales. Nevertheless this model conflicts with experimental observations on a number of counts. In these models the energy scale of the new dynamics was assumed to be at about 1015 GeV. Consistent with this value, these models give naive predictions for the Higgs mass at approximately 2mt \u223c 350 GeV [26\u201331], and present experimental data rule out such a value. A smaller value of the Higgs boson mass might be obtained if the calculations rely on large renormalization group corrections [27\u201330], due to the running of coupling constants between the working scale (1015 GeV) and the electroweak scale (100 GeV).

Even more, these models require fine-tuning of numerous parameters in order to match experimental results. But that aside, the models with four-fermion interactions should be taken as the phenomenological ones, in which only the leading order in the 1=Nc expansion is taken into account. The top seesaw model was advocated initially by Chivukula et al. [32] in response to the difficulties of the earlier top-quark condensate models. The model admits, in addition to the top quark, an additional heavy fermion, \u03c7 [32,33]. In particular, in the top seesaw model there is no need for fine-tuning of parameters, and a later version of the model by Dobrescu and Cheng [34] includes a light composite Higgs boson. In the 1970s the technicolor (TC) model was formulated [35,36] as an attempt to resolve the shortcomings of the SM already discussed, while providing sound theoretical predictions for the Higgs mass. TC is a gauge theory of fermions with no elementary scalars, yet at the same time inclusive of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and flavor symmetry breaking. In the TC model the Higgs, instead of being a fundamental scalar, is composed of a new class of fermions called technifermions interacting via technicolor gauge bosons. This interaction is attractive and as a result, by analogy with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductor theory, leads to the formation of fermion condensates. However, TC theory fails to produce mass terms for the quarks and leptons. For this reason the model was extended to the extended technicolor (ETC) model [37,38], but this model is inconsistent with experimental constraints on flavor changing neutral currents, and precision electroweak measurements. Later on an improved TC model called the walking technicolor model [39,40] was constructed that resolves these issues, although it still fails to predict correctly the measured value of the topquark mass. For a detailed pedagogical review of the TC and ETC models see Refs. [24,41]. After the technicolor models came the idea that the Higgs boson appears as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, as noted originally in Ref. [42]. This idea forms the basis of little Higgs models [43\u201348]. The model stems a wellknown result of Goldstone\u2019s theorem, namely that spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry yields massless scalar particles, or Goldstone bosons. By selecting the right global symmetry, it is possible to have Goldstone bosons that correspond to the Higgs doublet in the SM. Subsequently the partial compositeness model was conjectured, by Kaplan [49] initially. Therein each SM particle has a heavy partner that can mix with it. Like this, the SM particles are linear combinations of elementary and composite states via a mixing angle. The elegance of the partial compositeness model is its simplicity, without the need for deviations beyond the standard model, thus relying on the known fundamental particles only [50].\nMore recently, among a variety of theoretical papers that appeared between December 2015 and August 2016, there are several that consider both the 125-GeV Higgs boson, and the hypothetical new heavier Higgs boson as composite due to the new strong interaction, as noticed for example in Refs. [51,52]. In a different approach there are other papers devoted to the description of the composite nature of the heavier (750-GeV) Higgs boson only [53\u201366]. Other more modern composite Higgs models consist of thewalking model [67,68], the ideal walking model [69\u201372], the technicolor scalar model [73], Sannino\u2019s model of the generalized orientafold gauge theory approach to electroweak symmetry breaking [74], and the walking model in higher-dimensional SU\u00f0N\u00de gauge theories of Dietrich and Sannino [75,76]. A more comprehensive review of modern composite Higgs models can be found in [77]. Quantum gravity in the first-order formalism with either the Palatini action [78,79] or the Holst action [80] shares a property with the above composite Higgs models: it leads to a four-fermion interaction. This four-fermion interaction is now between spinor fields coupled in a minimal way to the torsion field [81,82], but importantly this four-fermion interaction leads to fermion condensates of the type that could constitute the composite Higgs. A similar idea has already been suggested in Ref. [83], namely that the torsion field coupled in a nonminimal way to fermion fields [84\u201386] could be a source of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. This type of action with fermion fields coupled to the vielbein is one of the main ingredients of our action. The other main ingredient flows from a theory that contains fundamental scalar fields with zero-mass dimension recently proposed in [2], as a way of simultaneously canceling both the vacuum energy and the Weyl anomaly. Starting with a theory of the SM coupled to gravity, the fermion and gauge fields are coupled to a background classical gravitational field, with a right-handed neutrino for each generation also coupled to the background field. This representation is a quantum field theory (QFT) on a classical background spacetime. The Weyl anomaly is a measure of the failure of the classically Weyl-invariant theory to define a Weylinvariant quantum theory, and can be expressed in terms of the number of different fields present in the theory. In the SM there are n0 \u00bc 4 ordinary real scalars in the usual complex Higgs doublet, n1=2 \u00bc 3 \u00d7 16 \u00bc 48 Weyl spinors (16 per generation), n1 \u00bc 8\u00fe 3\u00fe 1 \u00bc 12 gauge fields of SU\u00f03\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7U\u00f01\u00de, and a single gravitational field (n2 \u00bc 1). With these combinations the Weyl anomaly is nonzero. However, suppose that the Higgs and graviton fields are not fundamental fields but rather composite, such that their contributions to the vacuum energy and Weyl anomaly can be dropped, and n0 \u00bc n2 \u00bc 0. The implication is that by introducing n00 \u00bc 36 scalars with zero-mass dimension, then not only does the Weyl anomaly vanish, but also the vacuum energy vanishes as well.\n015021-2\nThis embodies our motivation for the starting point of this work: a model comprising Dirac fermions of the SM with a nonminimal coupling to gravity, that includes 36 fundamental scalar fields. The details of the construction of the theory is described in full in Sec. II A. We find that in this model, the theory admits mass terms for the fermions. By using the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion self-energy function, a relationship is derived between the top-quark mass, the Planck mass (the ultraviolet cutoff point of the loop integral), and the strength of the inverse coupling between the fermion fields and the vielbein. From this relation an estimation for the mass of the top-quark can be extracted. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the first main ingredient of the action is constructed, the piece that includes Dirac fermions coupled nonminimally to the vielbein field that describes the background gravitational field. of the action is formulated, namely the dynamical piece of the fundamental scalar fields described above. In Sec. IV the Schwinger-Dyson approach is implemented to calculate the leading-order piece of the self-energy of the dominant scalar field in the action, namely the scalar field that couples to the top quark, being the heaviest flavor. In this section the main result of the paper is derived, namely the emergence of a mass term for the top quark. A relationship between the top-quark mass, the coupling of the scalars to the vielbein (gravitational) field, and the cutoff energy of the loop integral (the Planck mass) is used to estimate the leading-order contribution to the top-quark mass. In Sec. V the main conclusions of the paper are summarized along with prospects for future research. There are two appendixes: Appendix A contains the main formulas for a Wick rotation used in the computation of the one-loop integral, and Appendix B contains full details of the angular integrals in the one-loop integral.

However, the integration limits will be adjusted to take values that agree with current experimental data, such that this singular point will lie outside of the integration range. This is\n015021-6\nelucidated in the next paragraph. The next step is to drop the contributions to the loop integrals in (37) and (38) from the region k < p while retaining just the pieces from the region k > p. This too is justified in the following paragraph. To aid the discussion below it is useful to expand the remaining terms in A and B in powers of p2 to yield\nA\u00f0p2\u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe 1 16\u03c02\u03b1\nZ \u221e\n0\ndk2 A\n\u00f0A2k2 \u00fe B2\u00de \u22121 \u2212\np2 k2 \u2212 p4 k4\n\u00feO\u00f0p6\u00de \u00f039\u00de and\nB\u00f0p2\u00de\u00bc 1 16\u03c02\u03b1\nZ \u221e\n0\ndk2 B \u00f0A2k2\u00feB2\u00de 1\u00fep\n2\nk2 \u00fep\n4\nk4\n\u00feO\u00f0p6\u00de:\n\u00f040\u00de The integrals in (37) and (38) are ultraviolet divergent. In contrast, notice that the terms in the expansions in the integrals, (39) and (39), except for the first term (independent of p) are infrared divergent. However, in our scheme we implement an infrared cutoff in addition to an ultraviolet cutoff. Physically the presence of this infrared cutoff is needed in order to satisfy present experimental bounds on the existence of extra scalar excitations. From this bound we derive that the infrared cutoff in the above integral should be of the order \u03bb \u223c 1 TeV. Evidently, the dominant contribution to B\u00f0p2\u00de originates from the large-k region, provided that \u03bb \u226b mt. The implication is that B is log divergent. The integral over k2 is assumed to have an upper limit at k \u00bc \u039b with \u039b finite. This essentially means that the four-momentum in the loop is bound from above (see Fig. 1). The upshot is that \u039b is large to the extent that the value of the integral is saturated by the region where k is close to \u039b. In physical terms the loop is dominated by large values of k, or equivalently, the loop is dominated by small distances of the order 1=\u039b, with \u039b of the order of the Planck mass. As a result it is reasonable to take p to be of the order of 100 GeV, close to the fermion (top-quark) mass. Since 1 GeV is much smaller than the Planck scale, p is effectively zero in the integral. The leading order (LO) in p2 contributions to A and B are straightforwardly read off Eqs. (39) and (40). By inserting a cutoff at the ultraviolet and at the infrared end of the spectrum, these LO contributions have the forms\nA0 \u00bc 1 \u2212 1\n16\u03c02\u03b1\nZ \u039b2\n\u03bb2 dk2 A0 \u00f0A20k2 \u00fe B20\u00de ; \u00f041\u00de\nB0 \u00bc 1\n16\u03c02\u03b1\nZ \u039b2\n\u03bb2 dk2 B0 \u00f0A20k2 \u00fe B20\u00de : \u00f042\u00de\nBy canceling a constant factor of B0 on both sides of (42) and substituting a reparametrization of the form B0 \u00bc mtA0, Eqs.

As mentioned above, we assume that \u039b \u226b \u03bb \u226b mt, where \u03bb is the infrared cutoff of the momentum k in the loop.

All other intermediate values of \u03b1 correspond to physical values of the fermion masses. For example, the top quark mass, which is approximately 175 GeV, is generated for \u03b1 \u00bc 1.86564. By comparing this value with the critical value of \u03b1, we see that a certain type of the fine-tuning is needed in the given model. As a consistency check, take the integrals in (37) and (38) but with the cutoffs k2 \u00bc \u03bb2 at the lower end and k2 \u00bc \u039b2 at the upper end of the spectrum, where recall that \u03bb \u226b p is assumed such that only the k > p contribution survives. Then substitute for A and B inside the integrands, the leading-order values found in (45) and (48). Select the values \u039b \u00bc 1019 Gev (the Planck mass), \u03bb \u00bc 1 TeV, mt \u00bc 175 GeV, and \u03b1 \u00bc 1.86564; then evaluate the integrals over k2. In this regime, the integrals as functions of p labeled as A\u0303\u00f0p\u00de and B\u0303\u00f0p\u00de, have the forms\nA\u0303\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe 1 16\u03c02\u03b1\nZ \u039b2\n\u03bb2 dk2\nA0k4\nA20k 2 \u00fe B20\n1\n\u00f0p2 \u2212 k2\u00de ; \u00f049\u00de\n015021-7\nB\u0303\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc 1 16\u03c02\u03b1\nZ \u039b2\n\u03bb2 dk2\nB0k2\nA20k 2 \u00fe B20\n1\n\u00f0k2 \u2212 p2\u00de ; \u00f050\u00de\nwhere in Eqs.

The values of A\u0303\u00f0p\u00de are very close to A0 \u00bc 12 as expected, while the values of B\u0303\u00f0p\u00de=A\u0303\u00f0p\u00de are very close to mt \u00bc 175 GeV, also as expected."

            "text": "In this paper we have proposed a novel scheme that could pave the way for the construction of the ultraviolet completion of the SM. The said mechanism, instead of the conventional Higgs boson field, features a set of 36 zerodimension scalar fields that give rise to dynamical symmetry breaking. In consequence we have presented a mechanism for obtaining fermion mass terms in the SM action. We have implemented this mechanism to the topquark sector of the action, and shown that it is capable of predicting a value for the top-quark mass in agreement with the measured value, within specific limits imposed on the\nenergy scale of the interactions between the scalars and the top-quark. These scalar fields are precisely the couplings between the fermions and the vielbein field of the background gravitational field. The form of the coupling we propose is a direct extension of the nonminimal coupling of fermions to the vielbein [1], in which the constant coupling terms are promoted to fields in their own right. We further generalize to a scenario where the coupling terms between the vielbein and the various different fermion flavors are distinctly different fields for each different fermion in the SM action. The outcome is that we obtain a total of 36 scalar fields that constitute the coupling terms. At the same time this is the precise number of zero-dimension scalar fields required to have a vanishing Weyl anomaly [2], this being the case for the action we have formulated. But more fundamentally, in the model that we propose, the zero-dimension scalar fields have manifestly geometrical origins. We assume that the sector of the theory containing these zero-dimension scalar fields is valid within the range of energy scales between \u03bb \u223c 1 TeV and \u039b \u223cmP \u223c 1019 GeV. The presence of the infrared cutoff, \u03bb is necessary in order to satisfy the currently known lower bound on extra scalar fields in the SM. The ultraviolet cutoff, \u039b, is naturally of the order of the Plank mass, the scale at which quantum gravity effects are expected to play a significant role. On grounds that the Weyl anomaly vanishes in the theory presented in this work, then arguably this theory offers a solution for the cosmological constant problem. We argue that within this theory the fermion masses are generated dynamically due to the exchange of such scalars between the SM fermions. We have tested our model by implementing a simplified toy-model version, containing just a doublet of the top quark and bottom quark interacting via the exchange of the zero-dimension scalars. Specifically, we used an approach based on the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equations (the so-called rainbow approximation), which enables a description of dynamical symmetry breaking.Our observations show that there exists a certain critical value of the coupling constant \u03b1. For smaller values (strong coupling) the dynamical fermion mass is generated. In order for the fermion mass to be close to the top-quark mass, the value of \u03b1 must be close to the critical value. Thinking beyond the results in this article, the toy model discussed here yields equal masses for both the top and bottom quarks. Without doubt this model should be generalized to incorporate different masses for the top and bottom quarks. In particular, a prospective generalized model should have a suppression of the bottom-quark mass in comparison with the top-quark mass. Above all, the interactions between other components of the scalars should be taken into account, which give rise to the smaller masses of these fermions. Further afield the question arises of how to incorporate the generation of the difference in\n015021-8\nmasses between the u and d quarks, the c and s quarks, as well as the difference in masses between the charged leptons and their neutrinos. This generalized theory is beyond the scope of this paper but will be addressed in a follow-up paper."

First write it as an integral from 0 to 2\u03c0 so that it can be converted into a contour integral along a closed circular path in the complex plane. Since cos \u03b8 \u00bc cos\u00f02\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u00de and sin2 \u03b8 \u00bc sin2\u00f02\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u00de, then In can equally be written as\nIn \u00bc Z \u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8 sin2\u00f02\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u00de\n\u00f0a \u2212 b cos\u00f02\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u00de\u00den\n\u00bc Z 2\u03c0\n\u03c0 d\u03be sin2\u03be \u00f0a \u2212 b cos \u03be\u00den ; \u00f0B4\u00de\nsuch that\nIn \u00bc 1\n2\nZ 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8 sin2\u03b8\n\u00f0a \u2212 b cos \u03b8\u00den : \u00f0B5\u00de\nNow write this as a closed integral over the variable z \u00bc ei\u03b8 in the complex plane, with sin \u03b8 \u00bc \u00f0\u2212i=2\u00de\u00f0z \u2212 z\u22121\u00de and cos \u03b8 \u00bc \u00f01=2\u00de\u00f0z\u00fe z\u22121\u00de:\nIn \u00bc i 8\nI dz\n2nzn\u22123\u00f0z2 \u2212 1\u00de2 \u00f02az \u2212 bz2 \u2212 b\u00den : \u00f0B6\u00de\nWrite the denominator of the integrand as\n\u00f02az \u2212 bz2 \u2212 b\u00den \u00bc \u00f0\u2212b\u00den\u00f0z \u2212 z1\u00den\u00f0z \u2212 z2\u00den; \u00f0B7\u00de\nwhere\nz1 \u00bc a\u00fe\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi a2 \u2212 b2 p\nb ; z2 \u00bc\na \u2212 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi a2 \u2212 b2 p\nb ; \u00f0B8\u00de\nto bring the integral into the form\nIn \u00bc 2n\u22123i I dz zn\u22123\u00f0z2 \u2212 1\u00de2\n\u00f0\u2212b\u00den\u00f0z \u2212 z1\u00den\u00f0z \u2212 z2\u00den : \u00f0B9\u00de\nNow the integral has the familiar form H dz f\u00f0z\u00de\u00f0z\u2212z1\u00den\u00f0z\u2212z2\u00dem where the contour is the unit circle with f\u00f0z\u00de analytic and continuous at z1 and z2, and it can be solved by the standard method of summing over the residues of f\u00f0z\u00de. Note carefully the location of the poles. From (B2) it follows that\na \u2212 b \u00bc p2 \u00fe k2 \u2212 2pk \u00bc \u00f0p \u2212 k\u00de2 > 0; \u00f0B10\u00de\n015021-9\nand there it is always true that\na > b: \u00f0B11\u00de\nAccordingly\nz1 \u00bc k p \u03b8\u00f0k \u2212 p\u00de \u00fe p k \u03b8\u00f0p \u2212 k\u00de; \u00f0B12\u00de\nz2 \u00bc p k \u03b8\u00f0k \u2212 p\u00de \u00fe k p \u03b8\u00f0p \u2212 k\u00de: \u00f0B13\u00de\nIn conclusion jz2j < 1 while jz1j > 1, so the pole at z1 is discounted because it is not inside the unit circle. This leaves two poles in the expression (B9): one at z \u00bc 0 and one at z \u00bc z2. For n \u00bc 2 the integral in (B9), by the Cauchy formula, has the form\nI2 \u00bc i 2 \u00f02\u03c0i\u00de 1 b2\n\u00f0z2 \u2212 1\u00de2 \u00f0z \u2212 z1\u00de2\u00f0z \u2212 z2\u00de2 z\u00bc0 \u00fe d dz \u00f0z2 \u2212 1\u00de2 z\u00f0z \u2212 z1\u00de2 z\u00bcz2\n\u00bc \u2212 \u03c0\u00f02pk\u00de2\n1\n\u00f0z1z2\u00de2 \u2212 \u00f0z22 \u2212 1\u00de2 z22\u00f0z2 \u2212 z1\u00de2 \u2212 2\u00f0z22 \u2212 1\u00de2 z2\u00f0z2 \u2212 z1\u00de3 \u00fe 4\u00f0z 2 2 \u2212 1\u00de \u00f0z2 \u2212 z1\u00de2 ; \u00f0B14\u00de\nwhile for n \u00bc 1 it is\nI1 \u00bc i 4 \u00f02\u03c0i\u00de 1\u00f0\u2212b\u00de d dz \u00f0z2 \u2212 1\u00de2 \u00f0z \u2212 z1\u00de\u00f0z \u2212 z2\u00de z\u00bc0 \u00fe \u00f0z2 \u2212 1\u00de2 z2\u00f0z \u2212 z1\u00de z\u00bcz2\n\u00bc \u03c0 4pk z1 \u00fe z2 z12z22 \u00fe \u00f0z2 2 \u2212 1\u00de2 z22\u00f0z2 \u2212 z1\u00de : \u00f0B15\u00de\nFinally. substitute the explicit forms of z1 and z2 to obtain\nI1 \u00bc \u03c0 2k2 \u03b8\u00f0k \u2212 p\u00de \u00fe \u03c0 2p2 \u03b8\u00f0p \u2212 k\u00de; \u00f0B16\u00de\nand\nI2 \u00bc \u2212 \u03c0 2k2\u00f0p2 \u2212 k2\u00de \u03b8\u00f0k \u2212 p\u00de \u2212 \u03c0 2p2\u00f0k2 \u2212 p2\u00de \u03b8\u00f0p \u2212 k\u00de: \u00f0B17\u00de\n[1] Sergei Alexandrov, Immirzi parameter and fermions with non-minimal coupling, Classical Quantum Gravity 25, 145012 (2008).
