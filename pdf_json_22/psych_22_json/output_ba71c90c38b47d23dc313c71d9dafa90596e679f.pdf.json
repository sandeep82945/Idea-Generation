In the current study, we investigated the resting-state functional\nbrain networks of healthy volunteers before and after drinking through graph-\ntheory analysis, aiming to ascertain the effects of acute alcohol intake on\ntopology and information processing mode of the functional brain networks.\nMaterials and methods: Thirty-three healthy volunteers were enrolled in this\nexperiment. Each volunteer accepted alcohol breathalyzer tests followed\nby resting-state magnetic resonance imaging at three time points: before\ndrinking, 0.5 h after drinking, and 1 h after drinking. The data obtained were\ngrouped based on scanning time into control group, 0.5-h group and 1-h\ngroup, and post-drinking data were regrouped according to breath alcohol\nconcentration (BrAC) into relative low BrAC group (A group; 0.5-h data, n = 17;\n1-h data, n = 16) and relative high BrAC group (B group; 0.5-h data, n = 16; 1-h\ndata, n = 17). The graph-theory approach was adopted to construct whole-\nbrain functional networks and identify the differences of network topological\nproperties among all the groups.\nResults: The network topology of most groups was altered after drinking, with\nthe B group presenting the most alterations. For global network measures, B\ngroup exhibited increased global efficiency, Synchronization, and decreased\nlocal efficiency, clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient,\ncharacteristic path length, normalized characteristic path length, as compared\nto control group. Regarding nodal network measures, nodal clustering\ncoefficient and nodal local efficiency of some nodes were lower in B group\nthan control group. These changes suggested that the network integration\nability and synchrony improved, while the segregation ability diminished.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nConclusion: This study revealed the effects of acute alcohol intake on\nthe topology and information processing mode of resting-state functional\nbrain networks, providing new perceptions and insights into the effects of\nalcohol on the brain.\nKEYWORDS\nalcohol, functional magenetic resonance imaging, graph theory, breath alcohol concentration, brain functional network, healthy volunteers"

            "text": "Alcohol is a common stimulant. Ethanol as one of the main components of alcohol is a small-molecular, lipid-soluble compound. It can enter the brain with the blood and then easily cross the blood-brain barrier and injure brain cells, resulting in damages to the brain function. According to the World Health Organization statistics (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2018), the unique flavor, euphoria-inducing and addictive properties of alcohol have turned approximately 2.3 billion people around the world into drinkers, including more than half of the population from the Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific. In the meantime, the side effects brought by harmful drinking have badly affected people\u2019s health and social stability. Statistically, harmful drinking was responsible for approximately 3 million deaths globally (5.3% of all deaths) in 2016, of which about 900 thousand deaths were attributable to alcohol. It has been reported that alcohol-related deaths are mostly associated with the changes in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions following the one-time alcohol overconsumption. In addition, alcoholic intoxication is usually the root of a series of health problems [mental disorder (Puddephatt et al., 2021), cardiovascular disease (Millwood et al., 2019), etc.] and social issues [violence (NORSTR\u00f6M and Pape, 2010), sexual misconduct (Fritz et al., 2010), etc.]. Therefore, it is of great significance to study brain function alterations after acute alcohol intake.\nBlood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) is often used in alcohol-brain studies, attributed to characteristics such as convenient data acquisition, non-invasive manner in detection of brain activity changes and availability of multiple brain activity parameters. However, most of the studies focused on alcoholic encephalopathy and corresponding brain alterations resulted from chronic alcoholism (Fritz et al., 2019). Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of studies relevant to acute alcoholism (Nikolaou et al., 2013; Spagnolli et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2015), but most of them were concentrated on specific brain regions or sub-networks after alcohol intake and the relationship between imaging findings and brain function. It is a fact that performance of higher brain functions such\nas the cognition, memory, and emotional functions is highly dependent on the coordination of multiple brain regions and sub-networks. In this context, the existing studies still have some limitations.\nGraph-theory analysis is emerging as a novel approach in studies concerning functional brain networks using imaging techniques. It enables the topological properties of functional brain networks to be analyzed from the macroscopic view of global brain network, putting it at an advantage over other analytic methods (Sporns et al., 2005; Petersen and Sporns, 2015). Currently, it has been widely adopted in the studies on the functional brain networks in either healthy or diseased persons (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; He and Evans, 2010; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Additionally, applications in alcohol-brain studies have been also reported (Lithari et al., 2012; Sjoerds et al., 2017; Kimbrough et al., 2020; Smith and Kimbrough, 2020). Under this background, graphtheory analysis has its unique value in studies concerning the mechanism for alcohol action on the human brain, and related experiments may offer new perspectives and ideas for the exploration of effects brought by acute alcohol intake on brain functions.\nThe present study intended to construct the restingstate functional brain networks of healthy volunteers at different time points before and after drinking using rfMRI. In the meantime, graph-theory analysis was performed to analyze the topological properties of the networks. Given the individual differences brought by variations in alcohol absorption and metabolic rates (Yoshida, 1983; Baraona et al., 2001), data of different time points after drinking were subgrouped based on the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) into A group with relative low BrAC and B group with relative high BrAC, for more detail about the grouping, please refer to section \u201cStatistical analysis.\u201d In that way, the topological alterations of functional brain networks at varying conditions were investigated, which may provide information for revealing the information processing mode of functional brain network after drinking and suggest a theoretical basis for the exploration of mechanism for alcohol action on the brain and for the prevention of secondary injuries caused by drinking.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org"

The volunteers were required to avoid anesthetic and psychotropic drugs for 1 month before the experiment, to abstain from coffee, strong tea, and all alcoholic food or beverages for 24 h before the experiment, and to refrain from eating for 6 h before the experiment. Besides, alcohol breathalyzer test was performed to ensure volunteers had not ingested alcohol prior to the experiment.\nThe experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College.

The Chinese Baijiu \u201cQinghua Fenjiu 20\u201d (53% VOL) produced in Shanxi Province, China, together with some food (biscuits, peanuts, etc.), was offered. Each volunteer accepted alcohol breathalyzer tests followed by MRI examinations at three time points: before drinking, 0.5 h after drinking, and 1 h after drinking. BrAC was detected by Alco-Sensor III breathalyzer (ALCPRO, Knoxville, Tennessee) (Borges et al., 2004) and the blood alcohol concentration was estimated accordingly. Thin-slice T1-weighted image and BOLD image data were collected before drinking, while only BOLD image data were collected 0.5 and 1 h after drinking. The volunteers were required to report their subjective feelings such as dizziness, headache, and euphoria and the presence of blushing at each time point.\nMagnetic resonance imaging acquisition\nMRI was performed on all subjects using a 3.0-T GE MRI system (Signa; General Electric Medical System, USA) with an eight-channel head coil (GE Medical Systems). All subjects underwent Ax 3D-BRAVO (three-dimensional brain\nvolume imaging) T1-weighted imaging scan base on gradient echo sequence to determine whether there were anatomical abnormalities of the brain before the rfMRI scans, the imaging parameters were set as follows: slice thickness = 1.2 mm, slice gap = 0 mm, TR/TE = 7.8/3 ms, FOV = 24 cm \u00d7 24 cm, flip angle = 15\u25e6, matrix = 256\u00d7 256, 248 slices.\nBOLD rfMRI data were acquired using gradient-echo echoplanar imaging sequences (slice thickness = 5 mm, slice gap = 0 mm, TR/TE = 2,000/30 ms, FOV = 24 cm \u00d7 24 cm, flip angle = 90\u25e6, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, 25 slices) to measure the individual fMRI data. The duration of the resting-state BOLD scan was 7 min, and it produced 210 frames (5,250 DICOM images). The subjects were told to close their eyes and not to fall asleep during the scanning."

Setting of sparsity thresholds can guarantee all the constructed networks have the same number of edges, enabling us to detect the inter-group differences. Based on previous studies (Yang et al., 2021), the sparsity threshold range was identified as 0.1\u20130.34 at intervals of 0.01 in this experiment.\nGlobal and nodal measures at different sparsity thresholds were calculated. The global measures included five small-world network parameters (clustering coefficient Cp, characteristic path length Lp, normalized clustering coefficient \u03b3, normalized characteristic path length \u03bb, and small-worldness \u03c3), two efficient network parameters (local efficiency Eloc and global efficiency Eglob), Assortativity and Synchronization. Cp, \u03b3, and Eloc are measures of network segregation, Lp, \u03bb, and Eglob are measures of network integration, while \u03c3 is measures of the efficiency of information transfers (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Assortativity represents for network resilience (Newman, 2002), and Synchronization reveals the possibility of all the nodes with identical waveform (Wang et al., 2015). Nodal measure included nodal degree, nodal betweenness, nodal clustering coefficient, nodal efficiency (nodal local efficiency and nodal global efficiency) and nodal characteristic path length. Table 1 provides mathematical definitions of network metrics.\nArea under curve (AUC) for each network measure within the sparsity thresholds (0.1\u20130.34 at intervals of 0.01) was calculated to provide a summarized scalar (independent from single threshold selection) with favorable sensitivity for the topological characterization of brain networks."

Which means that B group will include the data of 33 volunteers at different time points when the BrAC is relative higher at two time points, while A group will include the data when the BrAC is relative lower. Predrinking data served as control. This grouping aim to ensure that the data of B group are the data captured when the BrAC of each volunteer is the highest under the current experimental conditions, the results of B group can represent the state of all volunteers when their BrAC is high, and excluding the influence of individual differences on the experiment to the greatest extent possible.\nDemographic data were compared using Statistical Package of the Social Sciences (SPSS) 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). Repeated-measured analysis of variance (ANOVA) was\nused to analyze the inter-group differences regarding global network parameters if the data were normally distributed, otherwise Friedman test was applied. Bonferroni correction was utilized for multiple comparisons. Nodal network parameters were compared via paired-sample T-test in GRETNA toolbox, and multiple comparisons were corrected with false discovery rate (FDR). As pairwise comparisons were performed between nodal network parameters in this experiment, the P threshold generated by GRETNA divided by 3 was taken as the corrected threshold to identify nodes with statistical differences. To localize those neural circuits showing significant changes in functional connectivity strength, the Network-Based Statistic (NBS) method3 was used. A non-parametric permutation test (threshold = 2.6, p < 0.05, 10,000 permutations) was adopted to identify significant inter-group differences in functional connectivity strength."

Functional integration refers to the ability of combining the specialized information from various brain regions rapidly, while functional segregation is the ability to process information in a specialized way within connected brain regions (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). In terms of global network measures, B group showed significantly increased Eglob and evidently decreased Eloc, Lp, Cp, \u03bb, and \u03b3, as compared with the control group and A group. These changes demonstrated that acute alcohol intake altered the information processing mode of resting-state functional brain networks, leading to enhanced integration ability and decreased segregation ability.

Edge sizes represent the level of significance (for more information about the functional connectivity changes, please refer to Supplementary File 3).\n0.5 h group, Eloc and Lp reduced in 1 h group, which was also a manifestation of enhanced integration ability and weakened segregation ability of the functional network. Combining the findings, we found that the effects of alcohol on functional\nnetwork topological properties were more prominent when blood alcohol concentration was higher. Additionally, B group presented higher Synchronization than control group and A group, suggesting a convergence in the fluctuations between brain regions.\nConsidering that the functions of drunken volunteers including cognition, memory, movement, and sensation diminished in varying degrees, we speculated that the weakened network segregation ability might be the leading cause of the clinical manifestations of the volunteers and the improved integration ability and synchrony worked as the compensated alterations for maintaining the normal operation of functional networks. Previous studies (Mihic and Harris, 1996; Fingelkurts et al., 2004; Lithari et al., 2012) revealed that the alterations of information processing mode of functional networks after drinking might be correlated with alcohol-sensitive gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). The interaction of alcohol and GABAA receptors on cell membranes can inhibit the neuronal activity, leading to weakening of the network segregation ability while strengthening of inter-regional functional connectivity, which thereby enhances the integration ability of functional networks and synchrony between brain regions. Compelling evidence is also provided by studies of Lithari et al. (2012) and Cao et al. (2014) The current study also noted that the B group exhibited lower \u03c3 than control group and A group, indicating that the information transfer efficiency of functional brain networks declined after drinking, making the relative brain networks potentially more susceptible to dysfunction, which is consistent with the clinical manifestations of volunteers after drinking."

            "text": "In terms of nodal network measures, 16 nodes presenting significant differences in topological properties were identified in B group and control group. Some B regions presented decreased nodal local efficiency (n = 3/16) and all regions presented decreased nodal clustering coefficient, which were present concurrently in the dACC.R, frontal.R, and precentral gyrus.R. All the nodes were characterized by diminished nodal network segregation ability, consistent with the global measures.\nMost of these differential nodes belonged to SMN (43.8%) and CON (31.3%), and a small number of the nodes belonged to FPN (12.5%), DMN (6.3%), and CN (6.3%). SMN mainly manages somatosensory and motor abilities, CON, FPN, and DMN are believed to jointly control working memory, attention, decision-making, and other advanced cognitive abilities through interactions (Dosenbach et al., 2007; SonugaBarke and Castellanos, 2007; Anticevic et al., 2012), while CN is primarily associated with functions such as sensorymotor coordination, emotion, and cognition (De Benedictis et al., 2022). The alterations in topology of brain regions\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org\nand function of sub-networks are highly consistent with the impaired functions induced by drinking, which further supports our estimation that \u201cweakened network segregation ability is the leading cause of the clinical manifestations of the volunteers.\u201d Additionally, we also noted that alcohol might mainly act on dACC.R, frontal.R, and precentral gyrus.R, three brain regions with the most significant topological alterations. Studies (Dosenbach et al., 2007) revealed that CON and FPN constituted a system responsible for the top-down control over behaviors. In this context, the post-drinking decline in self-control might be partly due to the simultaneous decrease in segregation ability of CON and FPN.\nIt is noteworthy that there were no nodes with advanced network integration ability in all the groups, which might be on account of the stringent thresholds selected in the analysis of nodal network parameters."

            "text": "Edge analysis suggested that acute alcohol exposure can significantly alter the connectivity status of functional brain networks. Compared with the control group, the neural circuit of A group showed weakened connection strength, while B group showed both increased and weakened connection strength. By classifying the changed edges into two types: intranetwork connections where the connection nodes belong to the same sub-network and inter-network connections where the connection nodes belong to different sub-networks, we find that neural circuits with altered connection states are characteristic in the distribution of connection types. First, compared with the control group and A group, the edges in the neural circuits with increased connection strength in B group were more represented as inter-network connections, suggesting that the information exchange between different sub-networks increased, which was consistent with the significantly higher network integration ability of B group. However, considering that the functional network also has weakened inter-network connections after drinking, the improvement of integration ability is more likely to be the comprehensive result of the mutual influence of different types of inter-network connections after network rearrangement. This argument is also supported\nby the fact that in the B group, there are more edges with enhanced inter-network connections than with weakened internetwork connections. Second, in the neural circuits with weakened connections, both groups A and B showed different numbers of weakened intra-network connections, suggesting that the internal information exchange of the sub-networks was reduced. However, the circuits involving B group showed a larger proportion of weakened intra-network connections, which is consistent with the weaker network segregation ability of B group. The relative scarcity of edges exhibiting enhanced connectivity within the sub-network in circuits involving B group also supports this hypothesis.\nIn conclusion, alcohol may affect the integration and segregation abilities of functional brain networks by modulating different types of network connections. The improved integration ability was attributed to the increased connectivity between different sub-networks, while the weakened segregation ability was the result of the weakened intra-network connectivity. It suggests that the functional connection types of sub-networks is correlated with topological properties, and there may be a mutual influence relationship. Combining the two may better characterize the information processing mode of functional brain network.\nInformation processing mode alterations\nBy combining the results of each section, we tried to deduce the mechanism of alcohol\u2019s effect on the information processing mode of functional brain network, and explain the relationship between the change of information processing mode and clinical manifestations of volunteers. Alcohol inhibits neuronal activity by interacting with GABAA receptors on cell membranes and leads to strengthening of inter-regional functional connectivity. These changes are manifested in the enhanced inter-network connections and weakened intra-network connections in the network connection state, and in the topology of functional brain network showed that the network segregation ability and information transfer efficiency diminished, while the integration ability and synchrony improved. Combined with the results that Cp, Lp, and \u03c3 all decreased, we found that the topology\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 10 frontiersin.org\nof functional brain network changed to random network after drinking (Bassett and Bullmore, 2017). This means that the network is more unstable, and at the same processing efficiency, the functional brain network after drinking requires more cost to keep functioning. Drinking can change or even damage the information processing mode of functional brain network, and the deterioration of information processing mode is manifested as the impairment of volunteers\u2019 function (cognition, movement, sensation, self-control, etc.), which is also the main reason for secondary injury after drinking. Previous studies (Shine and Poldrack, 2018) have shown that the imbalance of separation ability and integration ability of brain network can affect individual task performance, which further supports our theory. Our findings may provide a theoretical basis for the development of drugs or therapies to curb inappropriate behavior (violence, drunk driving, sexual misconduct, etc.) after drinking."
