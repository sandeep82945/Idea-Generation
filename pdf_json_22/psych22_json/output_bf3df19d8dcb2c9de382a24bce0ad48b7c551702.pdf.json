Measurem entbased care can strengthen outcom es by optim izing interventions and prom oting alignm ent w ith standards, but it is still not w idely deployed in EIS. The authors conducted a scoping review by system atically identifying and synthesizing m easures used in EIS related to purpose (i.e., to assess patients, fam ilies, and program s), dom ains (e.g., sym ptom s, quality of life), and reporting perspectives (of patients, fam ilies, and clinicians).",

Iyer, Ph.D.\nObjective: The early intervention service (EIS) m odel for psychosis has been im plem ented w ith increasing frequency; yet, im proving outcom es across dom ains for all patients rem ains challenging. Measurem ent- based care can strengthen outcom es by optim izing interventions and prom oting alignm ent w ith standards, but it is still not w idely deployed in EIS. The authors conducted a scoping review by system atically identifying and synthesizing m easures used in EIS related to purpose (i.e., to assess patients, fam ilies, and program s), dom ains (e.g., sym ptom s, quality of life), and reporting perspectives (of patients, fam ilies, and clinicians).\nMethods: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO , CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for pertinent literature published betw een 20 00 and 20 20 . Tw o review ers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts and extracted data. Measures w ere classified as clinician- reported outcom e m easures (CROMs), patientreported outcom e or experience m easures (PROMs/\nPREMs), or fam ily- reported outcom e or experience m easures (FROMs/ FREMs).\nResults: In total, 172 m easures of 27 dom ains were identified from 115 articles. Nineteen m easures had been used to assess program s on fidelity, service engagem ent, and satisfaction; 136 to assess patients on duration of untreated psychosis, sym ptom s, functioning, quality of life, and others; and 17 to assess fam ilies on coping and burden, background, and others. Sixty percent were CROMs, 30% were PROMs/ PREMs, and 10% were FROMs/ FREMs.\nConclusions: Greater inclusion of PROMs and FROMs is needed because they align with the EISphilosophy of patient and family engagement and may improve shared decision making and outcomes. A comprehensive, meaningfully synthesized archive of measures can advance measurement- based care, services research, and data harm onization in early psychosis.\nPsychiatric Services in Advance (doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.202100506)\nPsychotic disorders usually begin in late adolescence or early adulthood and have profound personal, family, social, and economic impacts (1, 2). Consensus has emerged over three decades that high-quality care in early intervention services (EI Ss) and reduced treatment delay may improve outcomes, especially in the first episode of psychosis (3\u20135). The EI S model has been widely implemented in Australia, Canada, Denmark, H ong Kong, Singapore, and the United Kingdom (6). Similar models have also been rolled out in the United States (7\u201310).\nEI S guidelines identify elements and evidence-based standards of care essential to consistent high-quality services (11, 12). These standards include early and rapid access to care; use of low-dose second-generation antipsychotic medications; and a customizable package of evidence-based, recovery-oriented interventions focused on social and occupational functioning and the mitigation of symptoms and distress. The patient-oriented vision central to this model focuses on patient agency and responsibility for care, recovery, and individual life prospects.\nDespite superior outcomes in EI S for first-episode psychosis (FEP) (5, 13), achieving improvements such as\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u2022 A review of measures used in early intervention services (EISs) for psychosis identified 172 measures of 27 broad domains from 115 studies; all measures were assessed with respect to purpose (i.e., to assess patients, families, or programs), domains (e.g., symptoms and satisfaction), and reporting perspectives (of patients, families, or clinicians). \u2022 With respect to purpose, most measures (N5 136) were used to assess patients.\n\u2022 Only 30% of the measures were reported from patients\u2019 perspectives and 10% from family members\u2019 perspectives, although measures for both viewpoints are critically needed.\n\u2022 The included articles showed little evidence of meaningful involvement and input from service users and their families in the selection and use of measures in EISs for psychosis.\nPS in Advance ps.psychiatryonline.org 1\nsustained service engagement or (re)integration in employment or school for all patients remains challenging (14, 15). M ultidisciplinary research has also revealed gaps between actual implementation and evidence-based guidelines and best practices related to EI S (16\u201318).\nSubstantial and varied research in EI S has focused on measuring treatment delay (19, 20); pathways to care (21); symptomatology and clinical, functional, or long-term outcomes (22, 23); predictors and durability of post-EI S outcomes (24, 25); and service performance (4, 26, 27). Although this research has advanced understanding of progression, outcomes, and treatments, measurement-based care has not been consistently deployed in the everyday practice of EI S. Furthermore, measurement-based care itself remains an underresearched topic in the EI S field (28, 29), undermining the potential to identify patients who are making suboptimal progress or to improve interventions and outcomes.\nWe began by adopting Aboraya and colleagues\u2019 (30) definition of measurement-based care: \u201c The use of validated clinical measurement instruments to objectify the assessment, treatment and clinical outcomes, including efficacy, safety, tolerability, functioning, and quality of life, in patients with psychiatric disorders.\u201d I n this review, we broadened this defi nition to refer to the use of systematic data collection to monitor individual-level treatment and directly inform both care-related decisions (29, 31\u201335) and the standard of care in services (30, 36) by allowing aggregation of patient data (37). Furthermore, service-level measures, such as fi - delity monitoring (11), can be pertinent in measurement- based care because they can promote individual- and service-level adherence to best practices and clinical stan- dards in EI S.\nThe benefits of measurement-based care for clinical decision making and quality improvement have been increasingly recognized (29, 31, 33, 35). H owever, to support clinicians with evaluation of and ongoing adjustments to treatment, measurement-based care and assessments must be administered and analyzed systematically and continuously for every patient at the start of treatment. Such sustained measurement can also enrich research on illness progression, outcomes, long-term recovery, and service design (31, 33, 35, 38\u201340).\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROM s) (37, 41\u201343) and patient-reported experience measures (PREM s) are rich sources of information on care outcomes and experiences from the patient\u2019s perspective (44). PROM s and PREM s, together with similar family- and clinician-reported measures and more traditional information sources such as clinical-administrative data, can yield a comprehensive assessment of outcomes, quality of care, and service provision (37, 41). Especially in EI S, which emphasizes engagement of patients and families (45, 46), the inclusion of PROM s, PREM s, and family-reported measures is crucial (37, 41).\nAs an important fi rst step in advancing comprehensive measurement-based care in EI S, we conducted a scoping\nreview to identify and synthesize measures reported in the EI S literature with respect to their purpose (i.e., to assess patients, families, or programs), the domains covered (e.g., symptoms, functioning, quality of life), and reporting perspectives targeted (i.e., those of the patient, family, or clinician). These three categories were selected a priori as effective and efficient ways to describe, synthesize, organize, and assess the types of data gathered for each measure. I n addition to informing measurement-based care, this review sought to facilitate the standardization of measures used in EI S services.\nMETHODS\nSt udy Design This scoping review was part of a larger knowledge synthesis and implementation project, the M eaningful Assessment Protocol (M AP) study. We followed a five-stage methodological framework for scoping reviews (47) and organized the review on the basis of the PRI SM A Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRI SM A-ScR) checklist (48). (The checklist is available in the online supplement to this review.)\nResear ch Quest ions The following questions guided the research: What measures are used in EI S on the basis of peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2020?What are their purposes (i.e., to assess patients, families, or programs)? What domains (i.e., foci of data collection) are assessed?From whose perspectives (patient, family, or clinician) are these measures reported?\nI dent ifi cat ion of Eligible St udies A health sciences librarian (J.B.) developed the search strategy and performed searches in M EDLI NE, EM BASE, PsycI NFO, CI NAH L, Cochrane Trials, and Proquest Dissertations and Theses from January 1, 2000, to September 1, 2020, without language restrictions. The M EDLI NE strategy was developed with input from the project team to identify pertinent literature on EI S for psychosis and was peer reviewed by a second librarian by using the PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies) standard (49). Once finalized, the M EDLI NE strategy was adapted to other databases (the full search strategies are available here: https:/ / doi.org/ 10.5683/ SP3/ DUGJM W). Results from each database were exported to EndNote, and duplicates were removed. Publications were required to be in English, peer reviewed, published between 2000 and 2020, and pertinent to EI S for psychosis and to include one or more measures. Conference proceedings, dissertations, commentaries, letters to the editor, non\u2013full text publications, evaluations, and descriptions of single interventions (e.g., cognitivebehavioral therapy [CBT]) or scales (e.g., psychometric pr oper ties) w er e excluded. Ar ticles on comor bid gener al medi cal condi ti ons, phar macol ogi cal management, and\n2 ps.psychiatryonline.org PS in Advance\nneurocognitive assessments were excluded because previous reviews and guidelines have been published on these topics (50\u201354).\nDat a Ext r act ion Four reviewers, working independently in pairs, performed different stages of the review process. Title and abstract as well as full-text screening were conducted with Covidence software (55). Reviewers screened titles and abstracts for each retrieved citation and then reviewed the full texts of articles for inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed on all included articles by using astandardized form (see Key I tems Forming Part of the Data Extraction Templates in the online supplement). Disagreements regarding data screening or extraction were resolved by discussion and consensus between reviewers or, failing consensus, by two authors (M .F. and S.N.I .) who trained and closely supervised the review team.\nArticles included in this review comprised clinical and services research (trials and programs or service evaluations), study protocols, economic evaluations, guidelines, and fidelity assessments. Standardized data extraction forms were created for each type of article by using categories covered in pertinent critical appraisal tools and checklists: SQUI RE (Standards for Quality I mprovement Reporting Excellence) (56) for program evaluations, SPI RI T (Standard Protocol I tems: Recommendations for I nterventional Trials) (57) for study protocols, and CH EERS (Consolidated H ealth Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) (58) for economic evaluations. This process involved the creation of data extraction forms sensitive and relevant to each type of study and standardization of the extraction process, providing methodological rigor. Although the checklists were heterogeneous and some had inconsistent scoring information, no studies were excluded on the basis of quality because our primary goal was not quality assessment but the identification of measures used in EI S.\nThe extracted data were entered into a M icrosoft Excel spreadsheet. I tems extracted included study characteristics (title, authors, year, and journal); location and description of EI S; study aims, methods, and measures used; purposes and covered domains of the measures; stakeholders (patient, family, or clinician) from whose perspectives the measures were reported; administrative procedures; and psychometrics. M easures of general medical health, medication adherence, and adverse effects as well as neurocognitive assessments were excluded because articles dealing with these topics were also excluded from this review.\nSummar y and Repor t ing Study characteristics were summarized as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. All descriptive statistics and plots were generated with M icrosoft Excel.\nAn alphabetically arranged archive was created for the extracted measures, including their citations. M easures were classified and organized as clinician-reported outcome\nmeasures (CROM s), PROM s, or PREM s, or family-reported outcome or experience measures (FROM s and FREM s). CROM s involved an external observer, either a clinician or research staff member, who rated the interviews or scales."

Titles and abstracts were screened, and 611 articles were retained for full-text review (see PRI SM A flow diagram in the online supplement). Of these, 91 studies met the inclusion criteria. A hand search of 26 reviews (examined for studies mentioning the use of measures; these studies were further evaluated for inclusion) yielded 24 additional articles. To avoid repeat counting of the measures used in a single study, we included only assessments and measures reported in study protocol papers and excluded any publications reporting results that were linked to the protocol study already included.\nI n total, 115 studies were selected for data extraction. (See the online supplement for a list of the studies, measures used, intended assessment domains, and time points during treatment when measures were administered [Characteristics of Studies I ncluded]; an inventory of all measures, listed alphabetically by their acronyms [Alphabetized I nventory of M easures]; and a tabulation of measures by purpose, assessment domain [e.g., diagnoses, symptom assessment, and functioning], and reporting perspective assessed [Assessment Domains in Early I ntervention Services].)\nSt udy Locat ions The reviewed studies were from North America (N5 32), Western and Southern Europe (N5 25), Scandinavia (N5 24), the Asia-Pacifi c region (N5 16), Oceania (N5 14), Centr al and Easter n Eur ope (N5 2), and inter continental (I ndo-Canadian) (N5 2), representing 36 countries (Figure 1). Twenty percent (N5 23) of the studies were published in 2019 or 2020 (see Number of Publications by Year in the online supplement). The measures favored in EI S reflected certain regional preferences. (Cited studies are identified henceforth by study number from Characteristics of Studies I ncluded in the online supplement [e.g., S1, S2, etc.]) For example, the Role Functioning Scale (RFS) was used in nine studies, seven of which came from the H ong Kong Early Assessment Service for Young People With Psychosis (EASY) and Jockey Club Early Psychosis programs (references S55, S58, S59\u201362, S64), whereas the Service Utilization and Resources Form for Schizophrenia was used exclusively in North America (S25, S106, S109, S111, S114).\nSt udy Object ives and Design Sixty-seven studies (58%) assessed treatment outcomes in EI S.

Excluding 11studies (10%) without data collection (e.g., program descriptions and knowledge syntheses), study designs included descriptive and correlational designs (N5 45, 39%), randomized controlled trials (N5 20, 17%), quasi-experimental designs (N5 17, 15%), costeffectiveness studies (N5 10, 9%), cross-sectional cohort designs (N5 4, 3%), surveys (N5 3, 3%), pre-post implementation interventions using chart audits or administrative data (N5 2, 2%), consensus methodology (N5 1, 1%), guideline development (N5 1, 1%), and retrospective chart audit (N5 1, 1%).\nM easur ement T iming and Pur pose M easures for seven studies were recorded at service entry or project baseline, and 79 studies using entry and baseline measures had at least one additional time point: year 1 (N5 62), year 2 (N5 32), and year 5 or beyond (N5 17). Outcome assessments included patient symptom remission, recovery, housing, hospitalization, and functioning at 5 years in studies set in Canada (references S17, S34, S35), Denmark (S39, S44, S45), Norway (S80), Sweden (S89, S92), I taly (S70), and Japan (S75). Additionally, 7.5-year outcomes were assessed in one Australian study (S5) and 10-year outcomes in the Danish OPUS\u20131 studies (S38, S48), Danish-Norwegian Treatment and I ntervention in Psychosis Study (TI PS) (S77), and H ong Kong EASY programs (S55, S57, S58). The longest follow-up durations were reported for a 13-year Swedish study on employment (S92) and a Hong Kong EASY program 12-year study on suicide (S56).\nProgram assessment. Program assessments included three domains and involved 19 measures. Program fi delity was assessed by using seven measures in eight studies (references S16, S24, S25, S39, S42, S46, S48, S95), typically by using data from multiple sources, such as interviews, observation, chart reviews, and documents. Patient engagement was assessed by using a CROM , the Service Engagement Scale (SES), in two studies (S53, S95), and two studies used PREM s: the W orking Alliance I nventory (W AI ) (S26) and t he Scal e t o Assess T her apeut ic Rel at ionshi ps\u2013Pat ient (ST AR-P), Publ ic and Pat ient Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET), and the PatientCentered Outcomes Research I nstitute Engagement Activity I nventory (PECI ) (S25). Satisfaction with services was assessed during follow-up at multiple time points by using five measures in 12 studies (S6, S25, S41, S45, S46, S53, S84, S86, S87, S99, S107, S110). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), a PREM , and a modifi ed family version were most frequently cited (S41, S45, S46, S53, S84, S86, S87, S107, S110).\nProgram fi delity was assessed by using CROM s exclusively, whereas studies used CROM s and PREM s to assess patient engagement with services and PREM s or FREM s to assess satisfaction. Remarkably, no studies, including program or service model evaluations, evaluated clinician attitudes, knowledge, skills, or related competencies.\nPatient assessment. M ost measures (N5 136 of 172, 79%) were used to assess patient presentation at treatment or study entry and outcomes during follow-up. Characteristics assessed incl uded pr emor bi d funct ioni ng, dur at ion of untreated psychosis (DUP), diagnosis, symptomatology, comorbidity, risk, functioning, and quality of life, among\n4 ps.psychiatryonline.org PS in Advance\nothers (see Assessment Domains in Early I ntervention Services in the online supplement).\nThirty studies estimated DUP, with seven measures administered by clinicians or external observers; 23 of these studies used the interview-based (Early Recognition) I nventory for the Retrospective Assessment of the Onset of Schizophrenia (ERI RAOS and I RAOS), or Circumstances of Onset or Relapse Schedule (CORS) (references S19, S26\u201328, S30\u201332, S35, S37\u201339, S43, S45, S46, S50, S59\u201361, S64, S66, S67, S71, S73). DUP was usually assessed in studies reporting outcomes (N5 21 of 30, 70%) (see Characteristics of Studies I ncluded in the online supplement).\nI n 72 studies, diagnoses or diagnostic categories were established by using 15 measures, with the Structured Clinical I nterview for DSM Disorders (SCI D) used in 51 (71%) of these studies. The Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) was used in 10 studies (S39, S43\u201346, S49, S50, S99, S100, S102), and multiple other instruments were used in 11 studies (S15, S19, S37, S52, S69, S71, S72, S93, S94, S99, S112). Two studies used four patientreport measures (S3, S72), one study a family-reported measure (S52), and the others used CROM s, including interviews and checklists. Studies often established diagnoses at baseline and reassessed them after 1 year.\nPsychosis symptomatology was the most frequently assessed domain (N5 95 of 115 studies, 83%). Symptoms were assessed at single time points and at follow-up to determine change in clinical status by using 12 measures. Among studies assessing psychosis symptomatology, the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was used most frequently (N5 57 studies, 60%), followed by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS, N5 30, 32%), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS, N5 25, 26%), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, N5 21, 22%). Symptom measures for psychosis were commonly used in combination (see Characteristics of Studies I ncluded in the online supplement), and only three were PROM s: the Brief Symptom I nventory (BSI ), measuring paranoia, positive symptoms, anxiety, and depression (S2, S10); the Frankfurt-Pamplona Subjective Experiences Scale (FPSES) on subjective experiences (S72); and the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences\u2013Positive 15 (CAPE-P15) for psychotic-like experiences (S113).\nComorbid symptomatology was also assessed at multiple time points during treatment. Depression was assessed in 36 studies with six measures, including three PROM s and three CROM s. The Calgary Depression Scale, a CROM , was most frequently used (N5 25 studies, 69%), likely because of its specifi c focus on depression in schizophrenia (59) and its ability to distinguish depression from negative symptoms (60, 61). Five studies (S1, S8, S72, S101, S104) used the Beck Depression I nventory, a PROM . Anxiety and mania were each measured in five studies by using two PROM s (S112, S113) and one CROM (S7, S30, S32) for anxiety as well as one CROM for mania (S2, S51, S64, S88, S95). Substance use and related problems were assessed in 28 studies by using\n17 measures\u201412 CROM s and five PROM s (see Assessment Domains in Early I ntervention Services in the online supplement). Only seven of these studies used the following PROM s: Alcohol Use Disorder I dentifi cation Test (AUDI T) (S22, S33, S85, S89), Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis I nstrument (ADAD) (S6), Adolescent Alcohol and Drug I nvolvement Scale (AADI S) (S25), Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) (S22, S33), and Compulsive I nternet Use Scale (CI US) (S53). Suicidality and other risks (e.g., violence and danger ousness) w er e assessed in six studies using seven measur es, tw o of w hich\u2014the Adolescent Suicide Questionnaire\u2013Revised (ASQ-R) (S6) and I nventory of Suicide Orientation 3D\u2013Adolescent version (I SO-3D) (S2)\u2014 were PROM s.\n\u201cFunctioning\u201d was a broad term used by many researchers (see Characteristics of Studies I ncluded in the online supplement) that included overall functioning (both symptomatology and general functioning), social and occupational functioning, and premorbid functioning. Sixty-eight studies used 14 measures of overall functioning, including eight CROM s, four PROM s, and two FROM s (see Assessment Domains in Early I ntervention Services in the online supplement). The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) was used in 52 (76%) of these studies, whereas 22 reported using more than one measure of functioning, including PROM s such as the 12\u2013I tem Shor t-For m H ealth Sur vey (SF-12) for health status (S107, S110), the M ental H ealth I nventory (S3), the Warwick-Edinburgh Scale measuring well-being (S64), and the World H ealth Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WH O-DAS) 2.0 (S25). FROM s used to assess patient functioning included the WH O-DAS 2.0 and Life Skills Profi le (LSP-20) (S25).\nSocial and occupational functioning was assessed in 34 studies using 10 measures, including eight CROM s. Onefourth of studies under this domain utilized more than one measure. The Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) (S2, S3, S5, S12, S22, S33, S34, S52, S54, S55, S57\u201362, S64, S66, S93, S94) or SOFAS Personal and Social Performance Scale (SOFAS-PSP) (S7, S26) were used in 22 studies, the RFS in nine (S55, S58\u201362, S64, S107, S115), and the Social Functioning Scale (SFS) in two (S111, S114). Three studies used the SFS as a PROM (S10, S106, S112), and one (S95) asked patients to report on their use of time on a list of activities over the previous month. Nearly all studies assessing premorbid functioning (N5 25 of 26) used the Premorbid Adjustment Scale, a CROM .\nI n 36 publications, quality of life was assessed with 12 measures, most commonly H einrichs\u2019 Quality of Life Scale, a CROM (S2, S5, S7, S14, S17, S18, S19, S25, S33, S98, S109, S114). Six instruments measuring quality of life were PROM s: the World H ealth Organization Quality of Life Brief or 26 (WH O-QOL-BREF/ 26) (S5, S7, S51, S72, S75, S85), Wisconsin Quality of Life (WQOL) (S26, S29), Subjective Satisfaction With Life Scale (SSWL) (S89), EuroQOL\u20135 Dimension (EQ-5D) (S53, S95), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-18) (S53), and SF-12, a\nPS in Advance ps.psychiatryonline.org 5\ngeneral health measure (S62, S64). Quality of life was assessed at multiple time points during follow-up, frequently in conjunction with symptom assessments (N5 31 of 36 studies). Recovery was assessed with four PROM s (S25,"

Of 21 measures used to assess these domains, 12 were CROM s (one was both a CROM and PROM ) (see Assessment Domains in Early I ntervention Services in the online supplement). Ten studies (S2, S3, S5, S9, S12, S32, S34, S35, S39, S97) used multidimensional measures, such as illness and symptom history, by using three CROM s and one PROM .\nI n summary, patient presentations, symptomatology, functioning, and recovery were overwhelmingly measured with CROM s (N5 88 of 136, 65%). Very few measures were reported by patients (N5 45, 33%), and few studies used PROM s to measure psychotic and comorbid symptoms (S1, S2, S6, S8, S10, S25, S72, S101, S104, S112, S113) (see Assessment Domains in Early I ntervention Services in the online supplement).

Caregiving, coping, and burden were assessed in eight studies by using five measures, four of them FROM s, including four studies that used the Experience of Caregiving I nventory (ECI ) (references S6, S12, S18, S101). Expressed emotion and family functioning (S41, S73) and family background (e.g., genetic and obstetric histories) (S2, S52) were assessed with CROM s. Other family factors (e.g., depression, needs, quality of life, health, well-being, and functioning) were assessed in seven studies (S3, S10, S18, S25, S41, S45, S101), with six of eight measures used being FROM s."

            "text": "This comprehensive review evaluated measures used in EI S for psychosis to monitor multiple aspects of patient and family presentations and recovery over the course of treatment and examined the effectiveness of early intervention treatment models. As evinced by our review, research on EI S for psychosis has evolved considerably over the past 20 years. Well-designed studies, including several longitudinal investigations, have been informed by, and have iteratively informed, service innovations. M ost of the reviewed studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, Denmark,\nH ong Kong, Norway, Singapore, or the United Kingdom, countries that pioneered EI S for psychosis. By identifying, describing, and evaluating measures used worldwide in EI S for psychosis, we have created a valuable, synthesized archive of measures that can support future research into measurement-based care and services.\nEI Ss for psychosis are avowedly concerned with continually improving service quality and outcomes. M easurement science has long recognized the value of multi-informant, multilevel assessments (62) to enhance comprehensiveness and accur acy. M easur ement-based car e, an impor tant component of evidence-infor med car e, may fur ther this goal by helping pr ogr ams and ser vices or gover nments and regulatory bodies closely monitor program performance compared with clinical standards and guidelines. Systematically administering measures throughout treatment may also help to assess progress and generate data that will inform treatment decisions and personalize care for patients and families. I n the assessment of psychosis, this process should translate into the routine use of patient-, family-, and clinician-reported measures of multiple domains.\nCROM Dominance and Neglect of PROM s/ PREM s and FROM s/ FREM s Use of PROM s is promoted as a way of empowering patients to self-manage care and voice their opinions on service providers\u2019 decisions (41, 63, 64). PROM s, PREM s, FROM s, and FREM s show promise for improving outcomes and are favored by patients and their families (41, 64). Use of PROM s also aligns with early intervention guidelines in emphasizing patient and family engagement (65\u201368), yet this review revealed that PROM s/ FROM s and PREM s/ FREM s are used far less frequently than CROM s. Whereas 60% of measures were CROM s in the reviewed studies, only 30% were PROM s and 10% FROM s.\nThe predominant use of CROM s may stem from the strong focus on assessing symptomatology in psychosis research and may refl ect the priorities set by clinicians and researchers, who were the original leaders in creating these assessments. Assessments by clinicians and external observers may also have been prioritized for psychosis, a condition often characterized as involving loss of contact with reality, poor insight, and metacognitive difficulties (69). Limited use of PROM s may also reflect attitudes toward psychosis that underestimate or undervalue patients\u2019 capacity to provide useful information, which may be rooted in a defi cits-based model. Even social and occupational functioning was assessed primarily with CROM s, which may have precluded a patient-centered examination of what are now considered to be key dimensions, such as job satisfaction, perceived performance, and aspirations.\nAlthough CROM s were mainly used to assess patient characteristics and outcomes, relatively more FROM s than CROM s were employed in assessments of family factors. H owever, families were still rarely involved in rating patient functioning and symptoms, even though many young\n6 ps.psychiatryonline.org PS in Advance\npersons with FEP live with or are in close contact with their families (70). Families remain an untapped resource for patient assessment, particularly in relation to the question of patient functioning outside the clinic (71).\nT he results of our synthesis thus suggest that measur ement-based car e in EI S stands to benefi t fr om gr eater inclusion of PROM s and FROM s, w hich can complement clinician-r epor ted measur es to pr ovide a mor e compr ehensive under standing of tr eatment outcomes and effectiveness.\nCarlier et al. (72) identifi ed two complementary theories describing the operation of PROM s: the feedback intervention theory, which suggests that feedback on interventions and progress through PROM s informs providers\u2019 treatment decisions, and the therapeutic assessment theory, which considers the positive therapeutic effects of PROM s in involving patients in reviewing their own data and scores. Use of PROM s may also engender virtuous cycles of improvement in patient-provider communication; shared understanding of goals; enhanced clinician understanding of patient views and personal circumstances; and improved patient adherence, outcomes, and satisfaction with services. Patient and family reports on experience with services may also support quality improvement efforts.\nAn important direction of future research would be to evaluate the impact of the routine use of PROM s on patient outcomes in early psychosis. PROM s used in schizophrenia, psychosis, and associated conceptual and methodological issues were the subject of literature reviews (40, 44) that cited evidence for the use of short, psychometrically sound, and clinically relevant PROM s. I n the broader mental health fi eld, evidence on the benefits of patient-reported measures is mixed but still emerging. A Cochrane review (67) found insufficient evidence for the benefi ts of routine outcome monitoring with PROM s in treating common mental disorders. This finding was uncertain, however, given a high risk of bias in the included studies. Two more recent studies of PROM s in psychotherapy reported small-to-moderate effects on outcomes compared with treatment as usual, with one study reporting twice the levels of clinical improvement among clients who were predicted to have poor outcomes (73) and the other identifying positive effects in community settings but not in psychiatric settings (74).\nOverall, the increased use of PROM s and FROM s would align with the EI S philosophy of emphasizing patient and family engagement and principles of patient-oriented research (75). I deally, this alignment should be situated in the closer involvement of patients and families in treatment decision making and in services and research design and implementation. Patient and family involvement in service design and treatment delivery can identify new domains to assess and allow for the creation of new PROM and FROM measures.\nGr eat er Focus on Copr oduct ion and I mplement at ion Studies in this review focused mainly on the assessment of patient characteristics and outcomes, and patient data were\nfrequently pooled in evaluations of service models. Pooled patient-level DUP data, for instance, were often used as an indicator of treatment delay and a proxy for program accessibility. Given increased concern with fidelity to standards and implementation gaps in EI S, program-level implementation processes may need more direct and consistent assessment. Such assessment may include, but also extend beyond, fi delity measures to account for the fi t between the EI S model (or model components) and local contexts and for whether the EI S model can be adapted without compromising its inherent logic and core evidencebased features (69). Furthermore, higher adoption of PROM s and FROM s should emerge from more extensive involvement of patients and families, which could lead to wider uptake of evidence-based practices as well as innovation within the EI S model.\nRemarkably, only 12 of the 115 studies assessed patient and family satisfaction, and no study used a satisfaction measure tailored to EI S, thereby underlining an important gap and priority for measures development research in early psychosis. M easures are also needed to assess patient and family perceptions of key features of the EI S model, such as promoting hope and optimism as well as sensitivity to developmental and illness phases. M any assessments from our review, including the BPRS and PANSS for symptom assessment, the Lehman Quality of Life I nventory (LQOLI ) and H einrichs\u2019 Quality of Life Scale for quality of life, and the Strauss-Carpenter Scale for assessment of functioning, have long histories in schizophrenia research. Well-established measures are a strength but may also be problematic in that they were not specifically designed for younger individuals in the early phases of the illness. Some conventional measures may also use prescriptive framing and language that do not reflect the subjective experiences of patients and service users nor represent the empowering, hopeful philosophy of early intervention.\nAlong with the foci of this review (purpose, domain, and perspective), many additional aspects are important to consider in any efforts to implement measurement-based care more widely and meaningfully. Critical among these aspects is the level of stakeholder engagement (e.g., patients, family members, or caregivers) in the selection and implementation of measures. Even more fundamentally, their participation is vital in arriving at the constructs (i.e., domains) that are the focus of research and measurement-based care and in creating measures that assess such constructs. I n our review, only one included study (reference S25) provided details about the engagement of persons with lived experience in selecting or implementing measures.\nFuture studies should also systematically identify the domains in need of development of measures (particularly PROM s and FROM s). Our study reported on the number of measures per domain (further categorizing them as patient or family reported vs. clinician reported), which may be a crude indicator of gaps in the field. For some domains, it may also be reasonable that measures be assessed only from\nPS in Advance ps.psychiatryonline.org 7\ncertain reporting perspectives (e.g., satisfaction cannot be assessed from the clinician\u2019s perspective). Notwithstanding these nuances, the predominance of clinician-reported measures indicates the development or use of PROM s as a worthwhile direction of future research.\nFuture efforts should also evaluate the psychometric and other properties of measures, such as reliability (test-retest and internal consistency), validity (content validity, face validity, and construct validity), responsiveness (sensitivity to change), costs, length, cross-cultural validity, and availability in diverse languages, by using, for example, the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of H ealth M easurement I nstruments checklist (76).\nT o make such i nfor mati on easi ly accessi bl e to r e- sear cher s, cl ini ci ans, pat ient s, fami ly member s, pol icy makers, and others, our team developed an online database (M AP-PRO [an acronym that reflects a meaningful assess- ment protocol, patient-reported outcomes, and tools for pr ofessi onal use]), w hi ch pr esent s each of t he measur es i dent ifi ed i n thi s r evi ew, pr ovi di ng i nfor mati on such as r el iabi li ty, val idi ty, cost , l engt h, l anguage avai labi li t y, and t r ai ni ng and categor izi ng each measur e as a CROM , PROM , or FROM .

Such harmonization would also facilitate big-data platforms, data science, and rapid learning health care systems (77), thereby improving outcomes and service quality (78\u201380).\nPioneering work on data harmonization for outcome measures in EI S has been led by two important initiatives: the I nternational Consortium for H ealth Outcomes M easurement (I CH OM ) (in the area of psychotic disorders [psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder]) and the Core Assessment Battery (CAB) for the U.S. Early Psychosis I ntervention Network (EPI NET). The I CH OM used multiple methods (focus groups, systematic literature reviews, and the Delphi consensus process) and approaches involving international stakeholders (professionals, service users, and caregivers) to identify four outcome domains (symptoms, recovery, functioning, and treatment) and 14 core patientreported outcomes (81). The EPI NET National Data\nCoordinating Center is a research initiative focused on determining best treatments in EI S. EPI NET developed a CAB (EPI NET CAB) on the basis of standardized measures and individual items that assess key domains of EI S, such as psychosis psychopathology, recovery, contextual factors, and treatment. The CAB was developed through a consensus processby the EPI NET steering committee and isavailable on the EPI NET portal (81\u201383).\nWe note that research from low- and middle-income countries, where most individuals with FEP live, was underrepresented in our synthesis. This underrepresentation reflects the limited reach of EI Sin these contexts and may be partly due to the exclusion of non-English publications. Future efforts to identify suitable measures and their purposes and effectiveness will need a more global scope. Such measures should be developed and selected with respect to a given epistemic context and by adhering to principles of cultural sensitivity (84).\nSt r engt hs and Limit at ions To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review and synthesis of measures used in EI S for psychosis. Some eligible studies may have been overlooked because the search w as limited to published English-language studies. W e lar gely excluded studi es that used cr itical appr aisal tools for quality assessment, given that w e w ished to pr ior itize identifi cation of measur es used in EI S. Restr iction of the sear ch to publ ished, peer-r eview ed liter atur e may have intr oduced a bias tow ar d studies involving CROM s, w hich may have been view ed as mor e amenable to publication.\nA second limitation of this review stemmed from heterogeneity in the ways that data are collected for CROM s and who is involved in rating CROM s. Some of the CROM s identified in this review may have been implemented with an interview format, in which patients reported their satisfaction or perceived mental state and symptoms in response to questions. M ost of the included studies that reported on CROM s did not provide specifi c details on whether ratings were entirely based on responses directly provided by patients, informed by responses provided by patients but interpreted or judged by clinicians, or based on other information (e.g., information given by patient\u2019s primary clinician). Furthermore, some CROM s are designed to be completed by interviewers with specific training (e.g., SCI D), and others require raters to have no specific training (e.g., SES). The articles included in this review, however, did not always provide information on the level of training received by raters.\nI nterestingly, we found some literature indicating that CROM s (rather than PROM s) more accurately reflected symptoms (85, 86), whereas other evidence suggested that patients\u2019 reports of symptoms are more accurate. The accuracy of patient-reported symptoms was particularly true in research with adolescents (87), and the authors speculated that PROM s gave adolescents the feeling that their\n8 ps.psychiatryonline.org PS in Advance\n\u201c concerns are being heard directly,\u201d offering them a sense of agency (88) and autonomy (89).\nSimilarly, patient and family measures could have been used in EI Ss for psychosis to drive treatment decisions, but they were not reported in publications that focused on EI S outcomes. I t is also possible that EI Ss regularly use such important measures, a practice that strongly aligns with EI S philosophy, but that these programs do not have proper resources to engage in research activities or publish their assessment protocols or outcome data on services. We also recognize that some of the studies in this review may have used the same protocol and data, which may have resulted in an overestimation of the use of some measures. We recognize that this review did not integrate the perspectives of persons with lived experience in its planning, data synthesis, or writing. Finally, this review may have missed some measures by excluding studies focused on specifi c interventions (e.g., CBT) or broad therapeutic approaches and orientations (e.g., recovery). Although this exclusion was a limitation, it also refl ects the reality that such assessments do not have mainstream acceptance."
