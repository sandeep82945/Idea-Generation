1. **Investigate the effect of different degrees of TEMPO oxidation on the adsorption capacity and water flux of the beads.** This could be done by varying the amount of TEMPO and/or the reaction time. It is expected that a higher degree of oxidation would lead to a higher adsorption capacity but also a lower water flux. The optimal degree of oxidation would need to be determined for each specific application.


2. **Explore the use of different types of cellulose and alginate for the preparation of the beads.** For example, one could use different types of cellulose nanocrystals or nanofibrils, or different types of alginate with different molecular weights or degrees of acetylation. This could lead to beads with different properties, such as higher strength, better biodegradability, or improved adsorption capacity for specific pollutants.


3. **Investigate the use of the beads for the removal of other types of pollutants from water.** This could include heavy metals, organic pollutants, or emerging contaminants. The beads could also be used for the removal of pollutants from other sources, such as wastewater or industrial effluents.


4. **Develop a continuous process for the production of the beads.** This would be necessary for the large-scale production of the beads. The process could be based on a droplet-based microfluidics approach or a continuous extrusion process.


5. **Investigate the use of the beads in combination with other water treatment technologies.** For example, the beads could be used as a pre-treatment step for reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membranes. This could help to reduce the fouling of the membranes and improve their performance.
