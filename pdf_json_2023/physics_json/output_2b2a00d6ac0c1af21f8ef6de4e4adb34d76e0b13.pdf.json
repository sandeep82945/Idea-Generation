Essentially, OER is a four-proton coupled electron transfer process, demanding a higher energy to overcome its kinetic barrier compared to HER.3 Therefore, the development of efficient OER catalysts is crucial for enhancing the energy efficiency of water splitting. Generally, noble-metal oxide (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2) catalysts exhibit outstanding OER catalytic activity, however, their limited availability and expense restrict their practical use in wide-ranging industrial applications.4,5 It has been found that transition metal oxide-based compounds also exhibit\nical Engineering Guangdong Laboratory,\ngy for Materials Synthesis and Processing, 0070, China\nngineering Technology Research Institute\nna g, Hanshan Normal University, Chaozhou\n1000, China\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nexcellent OER catalytic activity, especially the low-cost and abundant NiO-based materials.6\u20138 However, the low electrical conductivity of pure NiO is not conducive to electron transport, limiting its OER performance. Therefore, combining NiO with other conductive materials (such as C and Ni) is a highly effective approach for improving its OER performance.\nCurrently, various methods have been used to modify NiObased catalysts, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD),9 hydrothermal,10 aqueous solution blow spinning.11 CVD method is capable of producing single-phase catalysts with controllable size and morphology. But it is difficult for CVD method to synthesize multiphase catalysts with complex structure, unless pre- or post-processing is performed. Hydrothermal method involves multi-step process, high-temperate, highpressure and several-hours reaction time. The aqueous solution \u2013 blowing method usually has uneven ber diameters and weak bonding between ber attachments and bers, resulting in unstable OER performance tests. In contrast, the LPPmethod is a one-step synthesis reaction that can be achieved under standard temperature and pressure conditions, with a shorter reaction time.12 And the nonequilibrium plasma, short discharge time and the quenching effect of the surrounding cooling solution restrict the critical size of the crystals, resulting in the synthesis of atomic-scale catalysts. Furthermore, a wide variety of nanomaterials could be obtained by changing the dielectric solution and electrodes, such as metal,13\u201319 nitrides,20 carbides,21 oxides nanoparticles,22\u201324 core\u2013shell and/or onionlike nanomaterials.25\u201327 Most of the raw materials in the\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19585\u201319594 | 19585\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

However, the high conductivity of the metal salt solution can quickly lead to electrode breakdown and cause short circuits, which is not conducive to the formation of plasma.\nIn this study, nickel rods instead of nickel salt were used as nickel source, and solvent-ethylene glycol solution was served as discharge solution, carbon source and reducing agent.28 And the effects of the composition andmicrostructure of the NiO/Ni/ C nanosheets on the OER performance were investigated. The EG30 presented a remarkable OER performance with the overpotential of 289.2 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122, indicating their great potential as an OER catalyst in oxygen production by the watersplitting."

The EG30 required the lowest overpotential (only 289.2 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, exhibiting the best OER activity.\nFig. 8b depicts the log j vs. overpotential image (plotted by taking the current density of Fig. 8a logarithmically), highlighting the oxidation peak in the electrochemical reaction. The formation of oxidation peak demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2 was converted into NiOOH during the electrocatalytic measurement. The conversion process is: Ni\u00f0OH\u00de2 ! OH NiOOH. In alkaline media, two different hydroxides (a-Ni(OH)2 and b-Ni(OH)2) can be formed on the surface of Ni and NiO. And both hydroxides are easily oxidized and form two different phases of NiOOH: a-Ni\u00f0OH\u00de2 ! OH g-NiOOH andb-Ni\u00f0OH\u00de2 ! OH b-NiOOH.9 Broad oxidation peaks in EG50, EG70, and EG90 could be attributed to the relatively larger overpotential required for converting Ni to NiOOH compared to NiO.\nFig. 8c illustrates the Tafel plots used to explore the catalytic kinetics of the samples. In general, the smaller the Tafel slope is, the better the catalytic performance exhibited. As displayed in the graph, the EG30 exhibits the smallest Tafel slope, measuring 88.29mV dec\u22121. CV curves can provide electrochemical Cdl values within the potential range when the electrode/electrolyte solution interface exhibits non-faradaic behavior (Fig. 8d). According to the equation ECSA = Cdl/Ce, where Ce is the capacitance per unit area of the electrolyte and Cdl is the double-layer capacitance. In plotting the current density versus scan rate in the non-faradaic region, Cdl is obtained from the slope of the line. In general, ECSA primarily considers the electrochemically active sites, whereas BET quanties all surface sites, encompassing both electrochemically active and inactive ones. Although the EG30 doesn't possess the largest SBET, it shows the best catalytic performance with the largest ECSA.\nFig. 8e illustrates the EIS Nyquist plots of the samples, with the equivalent circuit diagram and zooming diagram presented in the inset. The image appears as a semicircle in the highfrequency region and as a straight line in the low-frequency region, which can be tted to the curve using Zview soware. The diameter of the Nyquist diagram's semi-circle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance Rct, which exhibits an inverse relationship with the exchange current density of the\n19592 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19585\u201319594\nelectrochemical process. R2 is the electrochemical reaction electron transfer impedance, equivalent to Rct. The smaller the Rct is, the smaller the electrochemical impedance is. The faster the electron transfer rate, the better the OER performance. R1 is the internal resistance of the solution, which usually refers to the internal resistance of the electrolyte between the reference electrode and the working electrode. CPE is the constant phase element and W1 is the Warburg element (open). Apparently, EG30 possesses the smallest Rct and the fastest electron transfer rate, showing the best OER activity. The tted EIS Nyquist plots are shown in the Fig. S3 and Table S4\u2020 presents the EIS tted data table of different samples.\nFig. 8f summarizes the performance of the EG30 prepared in this study compared to the NiO/Ni/C8\u201310,38\u201344 and noble metal45,46 previously reported in literature. Herein, we mainly compare overpotentials and Tafel slopes. Generally, for the OER, the smaller the overpotential and Tafel slope indicates the better the OER performance of the catalyst,47 so the lower le-hand point in Fig. 8f is the better the performance. The overpotential of the as-prepared EG30 catalyst demonstrates comparable or superior performance in comparison to the NiO/ Ni/C system. The overall OER performance of noble metal is superior to that of the NiO/Ni/C system.\nIn summary, EG30 exhibited the best OER performance. Although EG10 has the largest SBET, it does not contain carbon, which plays a conductive role in the OER catalyst. Due to the formation of carbon sheets with abundant surface morphology, EG30 possesses a large SBET and the largest ECSA. The H2 + H2 + H3 type porous size distribution in EG30 is benecial for electron transport. All of these features have led to the best OER performance. In contrast to EG30, the decreased SBET demonstrates that EG50, EG70, and EG90 have excessive carbon which covers the activity sites of the NiO, resulting in weakening the OER performance."

            "text": "The pulsed plasma erodes the nickel rod and forms a large amount of high-temperature nickel molten nanodrops which could promote the decomposition of the organic compounds in the solution into carbon nanosheets. EG protects the nickel molten nanodrops from oxidation. By varying the concentration of EG, the morphology and structure of the resulting product can be tuned, ultimately resulting in the formation of NiO/Ni/C nanosheets. As the concentration of EG increases, the abundant surface morphology of carbon nanosheets appeared in the sample of EG50, EG70, and EG90. In contrast to the type of EG30 porous size distribution (H2 + H2 + H3), the other as-prepared samples possessed the H2 + H3 type. Comprehensive analysis shows that the best OER performance of EG30 is attributed to large SBET, a certain amount of carbon, and the H2 + H2 + H3 type multi-level porous size distribution.\nAuthor contributions\nRong Tu: funding acquisition, conceptualization, methodology, writing \u2013 review & editing.
