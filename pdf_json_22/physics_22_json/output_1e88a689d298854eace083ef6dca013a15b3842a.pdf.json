    "abstractText": "Microrobots can operate in tiny areas that traditional bulk robots cannot reach. The combination of acoustic actuation with microrobots extensively expands the application areas of microrobots due to their desirable miniaturization, flexibility, and biocompatibility features. Herein, an overview of the research and development of acoustics-actuated microrobots is provided. We first introduce the currently established manufacturing methods (3D printing and photolithography). Then, according to their different working principles, we divide acoustics-actuated microrobots into three categories including bubble propulsion, sharp-edge propulsion, and in-situ microrotor. Next, we summarize their established applications from targeted drug delivery to microfluidics operation to microsurgery. Finally, we illustrate current challenges and future perspectives to guide research in this field. This work not only gives a comprehensive overview of the latest technology of acoustics-actuated microrobots, but also provides an in-depth understanding of acoustic actuation for inspiring the next generation of advanced robotic devices.",

            "text": "As early as 1959, famous physicist Richard Feynman proposed in his speech: there is plenty of room at the bottom [1]. In his vision, these micro/nanoscale objects could be used for benefiting human beings in many kinds of situations. Since then, with the maturity of micro/nanotechnology and mechanical manufacturing, Feynman\u2019s vision has gradually become a reality. With the development of science and technology, there is an urgent need for people to develop delicate techniques that work on tiny objects or their postures, which can be undertaken by microrobots. Microrobots mostly reflect natural creatures, mimicking the appearance and movement of insects and small animals. According to their different forms of motions, microrobots can be divided into crawling robots, flying robots, and swimming robots. To date, these microrobots have received considerable attention in the fields of environmental monitoring, device flaw detection, military, and many other fields due to their small size, light weight, high flexibility, and diverse motion modes. However, due to the limitation of methodologies and difficulties in technological breakthroughs, many studies are still in the exploratory research phase. For the actuation of microrobots, the motor cannot be used as a power source like ordinary robots due to the size mismatch. Therefore, researchers have developed many different actuation methods, such as magnetic actuation, acoustic actuation, biological actuation, and chemical actuation. Magnetic actuation has the advantages of strong penetration, remote control, and non-destructive actuation for living organisms, but the safety of high-strength magnetic fields needs to be carefully considered, especially for biomedical applications. Biological actuation can be generally classified into bacteria-based actuation and eukaryotic cell-based actuation, but the organisms often show low structural flexibility and have a poor\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 481. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13030481 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 481 2 of 16\nlifespan. Chemical actuation usually relies on the energy generated by chemical reactions to power the microrobots. However, deficiencies are obvious such as the high risk of in vivo cross-reactivity, insufficient propulsion accuracy, short action time, and lack of instantaneous feedback. Acoustics can be regarded as a robust and reliable source to remotely manipulate microrobots. Comparatively, acoustic actuation offers many typical advantages in terms of strong penetration, high flexibility, and good biocompatibility, making it highly desirable for many emerging fields [2,3]. Table 1 shows the comparison of different actuation methods. In recent years, acoustics-actuated microrobots have gained considerable attention due to their promising potential use in diverse fields [4\u201311]. With the aid of acoustic actuation, many critical tasks can be performed such as targeted drug delivery [12\u201314], particle separation [15\u201317], mixing [18], pumping [19\u201322], self-assembly [23\u201325], microsurgery [26], microfluidic operation [27\u201329], and chemical analysis [30].\nTable 1.

We start by outlining common manufacturing methods of microrobots, followed by introducing different types of acoustics-actuated microrobots and application fields of acoustics-actuated microrobots (Figure 1). Finally, the current challenges and future research directions are presented. Owing to the unique merits of acoustic actuation, microrobots are expected to not only greatly improve the application outcome, but also significantly broaden the application range.

            "heading": "2.1. 3D Printing",
            "text": "Three-dimensional printing represents one of the rapid prototyping technologies. It is based on digital model files, using powdered metal, plastic, or other bondable materials to construct the object through layer-by-layer printing. Three-dimensional printing is widely used in the fields of biomedicine, microfluidic devices, micro-/nanooptics, micro/nanosensors, and biochips [32\u201337]. Due to its superior features in terms of simple equipment, low cost, high efficiency, and direct forming, 3D printing exhibited promising performance for use in the manufacturing of complex micro-/nanodevices [38\u201340].\nTwo-photon polymerization is a typical 3D printing technology that relies on the photopolymerization process initiated by a substance after two-photon absorption. The difference between two-photon and single-photon absorption is that when a substance undergoes single-photon absorption, it only needs to absorb a photon with a wavelength of \u03bb1 to go from the initial state S0 to the excited state S1; while two-photon absorption requires a substance to simultaneously absorb two photons with the same or different wavelengths to reach the excited states S1, S2, Sn, and then undergo a non-radiative transition to S1 (Figure 2). Generally, a substance can simultaneously absorb two photons at the focal point of the two beams of light to initiate the polymerization reaction. Therefore, two-photon polymerization usually occurs in places where the light is strong enough [41].

            "text": "Three-dimensional printing represents one of the rapid prototyping technologies. It is based on digital model files, using powdered metal, plastic, or other bondable materials to construct the object through layer-by-layer printing. Three-dimensional printing is widely used in the fields of biomedicine, microfluidic devices, micro-/nanooptics, micro-/nanosensors, and biochips [32\u201337]. Due to its superior features in terms of simple equipment, low cost, high efficiency, and direct forming, 3D printing exhibited promising performance for use in the manufacturing of complex micro-/nanodevices [38\u201340]. Two-photon polymerization is a typical 3D printing technology that relies on the photopolymerization process initiated by a substance after two-photon absorption. The difference between two-photon and single-photon absorption is that when a substance undergoes single-photon absorption, it only needs to absorb a photon with a wavelength of \u03bb1 to go from the initial state S0 to the excited state S1; while two-photon absorption requires a substance to simultaneously absorb two photons with the same or different wavelengths to reach the excited states S1, S2, Sn, and then undergo a non-radiative transition to S1 (Figure 2). Generally, a substance can simultaneously absorb two photons at the focal point of the two beams of light to initiate the polymerization reaction. Therefore, twophoton polymerization usually occurs in places where the light is strong enough [41]. Two-photon polymerization has the advantages of good spatial selectivity and strong material penetration, making it desirable for the manufacturing of microrobots.

Given its powerful propulsion force with a propulsion speed of up to 2250 \u00b5m/s, such a microrobot holds great promise to overcome the strong blood flow in arteries. It is generally ineffective for dealing with individual structures because the acoustic field has no selectivity to the object being manipulated. Recently, the application of acoustic radiation fields in a vibratory manner has been introduced to achieve selective addressing. Vibrating bubbles with different sizes trapped inside the microswimmer could generate enough thrust to propel microswimmers and be able to selectively drive individual microswimmers among the group (Figure 5C) [8]. Since the vibration of the bubble is selective to the acoustic field frequency [52], the bubble should vibrate effectively when the frequency of the sound field is equal to the resonant frequency of the bubble. A microrobot platform for drug delivery has been developed based on this principle [61]. The drugs and two bubbles (the inner bubble and the outer bubble, respectively) were arranged in the long tube, and the drugs were wrapped by two bubbles in the long tube. At the specified location, the outer bubble covering the opening of the long tube was discarded and the carried drugs were released by acoustic excitation of the inner bubble (Figure 5D). It is noted that the motion behavior of bubble-propulsion-driven microrobots in low Reynolds flow is complex, especially when the microbubbles are below the size range of 30 \u00b5m and vibrate near the solid wall due to nonlinear acoustic forces [59]. These kinds of acoustically driven robots have not been fully studied, and their directional control is still challenging. However, by adding a fin, the microrobot could carry out simple linear movements [60].

            "text": "In the bubble propulsion system, bubble propulsion is effective at the resonance frequency of the bubbles. If the bubble bursts, the entire system will lose the driving force. Therefore, the bubble driving system has certain inherent limitations. Alternatively, a sharp-edge propulsion system has been developed to achieve more robust acoustic actuation motions. The sharp-edge propulsion is inspired by single-celled organisms such as Escherichia coli and sperm, which move by swinging a sharp-edge-like tail [62\u201364]. Therefore, an artificial sharp-edge structure as the tail of the microrobot was proposed for facilitating the movement of the microrobots under the acoustic field. When a sharp structure responds to an acoustic drive, its special sharp structure creates a pair of counter-rotating eddies around its tip. This acoustic streaming phenomenon breaks the interface of laminar flow to promote the mass transfer of the fluid. The general theory of acoustic streaming has been widely introduced in the literature [65\u201367]. In addition to producing counter-rotating vortices, the sharp-edge also produces tadpole-tail-like wobbles that create forward propulsion. The concept of sharp-edge propulsion was proposed in 2006 [68]. To date, researchers have developed two different kinds of sharp-edge propulsion methods: helical wave propulsion and planar wave propulsion (Figure 6A). Compared to helical wave propulsion, planar wave prolusion has higher efficiency and performs faster linear velocity. Particularly, double-articulated tail propulsion achieved forward velocities as high as 2.5 mm/s (Figure 6B) [69]. This kind of microrobot exhibited frequency selectivity to realize steering, especially when using multiple flappers with different resonance frequencies. Similarly, a simpler and more straightforward microswimmer was fabricated by photolithography technology (Figure 6C), and the propulsion speed was able to reach up to 1200 \u00b5m/s [54]. The movement direction was regulated by changing the sharp-edge structures, and the positions of sharp-edge located on the microrobots could precisely control linear and rotational motion (Figure 6D) [54]. In addition, the propulsion speed was well adjusted by changing the input voltages and the number of sharp-edge structures. Moreover, based on\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 481 7 of 16\nthe sharp-edge structures, the research of acoustics-actuated microrobots can be extended to bionic robots [70]. The design of ultrasound-activated synthetic ciliary bands was firstly presented by mimicking starfish cilia. The working principle of cilia is similar to that of sharp-edge; under the action of the acoustic field, the cilia\u2019s vibration would actuate the movement of the starfish-like robot (Figure 6E). Therefore, it is possible to develop a miniature jet engine that transmits fluids through local body deformations without moving parts (Figure 6F) [71], indicating that the microjet engine might be the promising power source of microrobots in the future. Compared to microbubbles, sharp-edge structures possess robust structural stabilities even under extreme working conditions. Therefore, sharp-edge propulsion can be applied in a wider range of situations than bubble propulsion. However, the propulsion speed of sharp-edge propulsion still has extensive room to increase.

Trad tional drugs, in certain situations,\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 481 9 of 16\ncannot reach the treatment site as expected due to the narrowness of blood vessels and weakness of blood flow. Therefore, repeated administration is always employed. However, the increasing toxicity caused by a large quantity of drugs is unavoidable. Alternatively, if microrobots are inserted deep into the human body for targeted drug delivery and to release drugs at designated locations, this can not only minimize side effects, but also reduce the frequency of drug intake and improve the stability of drugs in the body [75]. A nanowire microrobot based on acoustic actuation and magnetic guidance was developed to release drugs in a pH-dependent way [76]. This microrobot was made up of a three-segment Au\u2013Ni\u2013Au nanowire and polypyrrole\u2013polystyrene sulfonate (PPy\u2013PSS) component which was attached to one end of the nanowire (Figure 8A). The drug was positively charged, and after static friction, the drug was loaded onto the negatively charged PPY-PSS component, and the loaded drug was found to be easily released in an acidic environment. Similarly, gold nanowires were developed to be a microrobot with a high drug payload capacity for cancer cell killing (Figure 8B) [77]. In addition, a porous hollow microrobot with a spiral cavity using a biotemplating synthesis method was developed for efficient drug loading. Under the megahertz-level acoustic field, the hollow spiral structure could be destroyed to release the drug (TS2-A-R1, Figure 8C) [78]. Furthermore, a particle swarm was developed as a micromanipulator to transport biological particles (Figure 8D) [79]. Locally enhanced microflows were generated around the micromanipulator, which could generate enough propulsion to propel the particles with different ultrasonic frequencies. Acoustic propulsion can be used not only as a propulsion mechanism for targeted drug delivery but also as a drug-assisted grasping tool. Recently, acoustic vibration bubbles were proposed to manipulate micro-objects (Figure 8E). The propulsion mechanism relies on the electromagnetic actuation, while the acoustic actuation is mainly used as an auxiliary actuation for grasping the device. This kind of microrobot can be operated in a channel of different shapes. By integrating electromagnetic driving and acoustic driving, researchers successfully manipulated fish eggs [80].

To broaden their applications in diverse practice settings, a systematic functional materials library should be built for researchers to source from. (3) Photolithography has an obvious flexibility defect for only producing uniform thickness, making it hard for fabricating complicated devices. Although 3D printing is more flexible, the precision is hard to meet the processing requirements. From a structural application aspect: (1) For bubble actuation, the main difficulty is how to maintain the stability of the bubble. When the bubble is vibrating, its size may change, resulting in a variation in the resonance frequency of the bubble, thereby affecting the effect of propulsion. In more serious cases, the bubble may burst, resulting in the propulsion being ineffective. Therefore, keeping the bubbles at a constant size and working stably is a key point. As described in Section 3.1, AMB (Armored microbubble) could survive for several hours under forced vibration, providing an insightful idea for solving the above-mentioned difficulties [59]. (2) The accurate control of the direction of the robots\u2019 movement is still not achieved [75\u201377]. When the microrobot travels deep into the human body, it is not reliable to rely only on acoustic actuation drugs. Therefore, combining other driving methods such as magnetic driving and electric driving to guide the robot for accurately targeting the desired locations is very necessary. Moreover, an instant feedback system should be built to be able to transmit information outside on time. (3) How to retrograde microrobots in fluids is another difficult problem [90]. A possible solution is shown in Figure 10. However, when the liquid flow rate is fast, those micro-swarm robots could no longer continue to travel retrogradely. Acoustics-actuated microrobots have attracted considerable attention in recent years, especially the tiny dimensions and flexible motions that allow them to access small, confined, and deep body parts that conventional medical devices cannot reach [95]. The acoustic field is a reliable actuating source, which can remotely and controllably actuate the movement of the microrobots. As an emerging technology, acoustics-actuation is an innovative and promising manner for contactless propulsion and the control of microrobots. Although the technology of acoustics-actuation is still not mature enough, it shows significant potential and will certainly benefit diverse research fields, such as treating arteriosclerosis, removing blood clots, cleaning wounds, and removing parasites. Regarding the challenging problems mentioned above, some researchers have already provided certain insightful solutions. It is believed that as manufacturing technology develops, acoustics-actuated microrobots will play vital roles and change our lives."
