"Research and development processes for new drugs represent a continuous fight against infectious diseases. Epidemic situations create pressure in the search for new drugs that do not generate side effects. Many proof-of-concept studies have been undertaken, but controlled trials are necessary to establish the effectiveness of astaxanthin in the treatment of numerous diseases. Currently, researchers are conducting clinical trials, investigating the remarkable effects of astaxanthin on inflammation and oxidative stress."
