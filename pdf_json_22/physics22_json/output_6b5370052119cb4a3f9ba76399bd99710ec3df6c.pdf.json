    "abstractText": "We consider a dark sector containing a pair of almost degenerate states coupled to the Standard Model through a dark photon mediator. This set-up constitutes a simple realization of the inelastic dark matter scenario. The heaviest dark state is long-lived, in the limit of a small kinetic mixing among the dark photon and the Standard Model hypercharge gauge boson, and/or of a small mass splitting among the dark states. We study the prospects for detection of this scenario at proposed LHC experiments dedicated to search for long-lived particles, namely FASER, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, AL3X, MAPP, ANUBIS and FACET. We consider both the cases of fermionic and scalar inelastic dark matter. We show that these experimental facilities can probe unexplored regions of the parameter space of this model, and we highlight their complementary roles.",

            "text": "In recent years, a rich experimental program has been put forward to search for Long Lived Particles (LLPs) [1, 2]. In accelerator experiments LLPs travel macroscopic distances before decaying, leading to signatures such as displaced vertices or missing energy. To fully exploit the potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), new experimental facilities dedicated to search for LLPs have been recently proposed, namely FASER [3, 4], MATHUSLA [5\u20137], CODEX-b [8, 9], AL3X, [10], MAPP [11, 12], ANUBIS [13] and FACET [14]. These proposed detectors would be located near the LHC Interaction Points (IP), and are designed to detect the decays of LLPs produced at the LHC, having at the same time the capability to dramatically reduce backgrounds. Interestingly, these projects are highly complementary to the existing LHC experiments ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. LLPs are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, see e.g. [6, 15, 16]. In particular, they often arise in dark sectors, which are scenarios postulating the existence of new states, possibly including Dark Matter candidates (DM), feebly coupled to the SM. In this work, we focus on the possibility of new SM singlets in the form of inelastic DM (iDM) [17]. This model contains two particles almost degenerate in mass, the lightest one being the DM candidate (of course in general an extension with more than two states is possible). If this pair of particles is then coupled to the SM only through tiny portal interactions, the decay of the heaviest dark state is suppressed and this state acts as a LLP. iDM is particularly attractive from the phenomenological point of view, because it allows to explain the cosmological DM abundance via the standard thermal freeze-out and, at the same time, evade existing bounds. Coannihilations of the iDM particles in the early Universe determine their relic abundance. On the other hand, these processes\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 0 0\nare suppressed at later times, allowing to fulfill the constraints from indirect DM searches and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, which are particularly tight for DM masses . fewO(10)GeV. The inelastic scattering of DM into nuclei is also suppressed, for large enough mass splitting among the dark states. Therefore, also direct detection constraints can be accommodated in this scenario. In general, the portal interactions among the dark sector and the SM can be described in terms of renormalizable (see [6, 15, 16] and references therein) or non-renormalizable portal operators [18\u201320]. We adopt the first option, considering a mediator between the SM and the dark sector in form of a dark photon [21, 22]. A relatively light mediator is required to explain the DM abundance via standard thermal freeze-out processes. Building upon ref. [21], we perform an analysis of this iDM model, focusing on future searches of LLPs at the LHC. Our goal is to extend the analysis of [21] to recently proposed experimental facilities.1 In particular, we determine the region of parameter space that can be explored by these proposed future LHC detectors, highlighting their complementary role in covering the parameter space of iDM models. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the iDM models under consideration. We will consider both scalar and fermionic iDM states. In section 3 we describe how the projected sensitivities are computed. We present our main results in section 4 and we offer our conclusions in section 5."

            "text": "Models of iDM have been proposed long ago as a simple way to evade the strong constraints coming from direct detection experiments [23, 24], and have later been used to reconcile the observations by the DAMA experiment with the exclusion limits derived from other direct detection experiments [17].2 Although recent analysis seems to exclude an iDM interpretation of the DAMA signal [25], in recent years iDM has been studied as a paradigmatic example of a dark sector that can evade the stringent bounds coming from direct detection [26] and CMB observations [27], with DM particles still being thermally produced. To illustrate the main idea, let us consider a scenario where, at leading order, the interaction between the dark and SM sectors occours via a trilinear vertex of the form D1-D2-mediator, where D2 is a dark state obeying m2 & m1 (with m1 and m2 the D1 and D2 masses, respectively) and D1 is the DM candidate. The mediator involved in this vertex is coupled to SM particles, providing therefore a portal between the dark sector and the SM. In an underground laboratory experiment, for a sufficiently large mass splitting\n\u2206 = m2 \u2212m1 m1 , (2.1)\nthe incoming DM particle D1 does not have enough energy to upscatter off a nucleus into the heavier state D2. Therefore bounds from direct detection experiments are evaded. At the same time, the iDM model can also fulfill the constraints on DM annihilations derived\n1We also update the geometry of the FASER and MATHUSLA detectors to the ones most recently considered by the experimental collaborations.\n2The mass splitting considered for this purpose is typically of O(100) keV, much smaller than the ones considered here.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 0 0\nfrom CMB data. In fact, in the early Universe, the cross section for co-annihilation of iDM pairs D1D2 into SM particles is suppressed by an exponential term exp[\u2212(m2\u2212m1)/T ] [28]. These co-annihilation processes are therefore irrelevant at late times, after the recombination era, as long as (m2 \u2212m1)/Trec 1, where Trec is the temperature at which recombination happens. For weak-size interactions, any mass splitting O(10) eV is sufficient to avoid the CMB bounds. More generically, for sufficiently large mass splitting, the constraints from indirect detection of DM are fulfilled in iDM models. On the other hand, as long as the mass splitting is not too large, the exponential factor is of O(1) at temperatures T \u223c m1, allowing for DM thermal production in the early Universe. Relevant constraints might arise from annihilations of D1 pairs, for instance processes such as D1D1 \u2194 ff\u0304 , where f are SM fermions. Similarly, also interactions mediating the D1 elastic scattering off nuclei might be present. These contributions are model dependent and will be discussed below.\nAs we will see in a moment, the situation presented above can be realized in a simple way for both fermionic and scalar dark states. For definiteness, we will consider the case in which the mediator between the dark sector and the SM is the so-called dark photon [29], i.e. the (massive) gauge boson associated with an additional U(1)\u2032 symmetry, that interacts with the SM via a kinetic mixing term:\nLint = 2 cos \u03b8w A\u2032\u00b5\u03bdB \u00b5\u03bd . (2.2)\nIn the previous equation, B\u00b5\u03bd and A\u2032\u00b5\u03bd are the field strengths of the gauge bosons associated with the hypercharge U(1)Y and the additional U(1)\u2032, respectively, cos \u03b8w is the cosine of the weak angle and is the kinetic mixing parameter. In the remainder of the paper, we will remain agnostic about the origin of the dark photon mass, supposing that any scalar degree of freedom associated with the spontaneous breaking of U(1)\u2032 is sufficiently decoupled from the D1, D2 and A\u2032 system. In the limit 1 and mA\u2032 mZ (with mA\u2032 and mZ the dark photon and Z boson masses, respectively), all SM fermions acquire a coupling to the dark photon of the form [30]\nLint = e A\u2032\u00b5 \u2211 f f\u0304Qf\u03b3 \u00b5f, (2.3)\nwhere eQf is the electric charge of the SM fermion f . This corresponds to the limit of photon-like interactions of the dark photon. However, since in our analysis we scan over the dark photon mass, considering also cases with a significant mixing between the A\u2032 and Z bosons, we use the full expressions for the couplings of A\u2032 to the SM states and of Z to the dark states [30]."

The latter can be generated, for instance, by the vacuum expectation value of some scalar state (in the minimal model, the same one that generates the dark photon mass). Notice that, since in the \u03b4m1,2 \u2192 0 limit the U(1)\u2032 symmetry is recovered in the fermionic sector, it is technically natural to have \u03b4m1,2 mD. In this limit the heavier state will typically be long lived.

(2.6)\nThe factor of i in the definition of \u03c7\u2212 amounts to a choice of phase that automatically guaranteesm1 > 0 under the assumptionmD > 0. With this choice of phase, the interactions with the dark photon can be expressed in terms of Majorana spinors \u03c71 = (\u03c7\u2212, \u03c7\u2020\u2212) and \u03c72 = (\u03c7+, \u03c7\u2020+), obtaining\nL\u03c7int = igd \u03c7\u03042\u03b3\u00b5\u03c71A\u2032\u00b5 +O ( \u03b4m1 \u2212 \u03b4m2\nmD\n) .

In the following, we will assume that these terms are negligible or simply not present (implicitly taking the limit (\u03b4m1 \u2212 \u03b4m2) \u2192 0).

            "text": "A similar reasoning can be applied to the case in which the dark sector is populated by scalar states. Considering a complex scalar \u03c6 = (\u03c62 + i\u03c61)/ \u221a 2 with charge +1 under U(1)\u2032, the relevant Lagrangian contains the terms:\nL = igd ( \u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2020\u03c6\u2212 \u03c6\u2020\u2202\u00b5\u03c6 ) A\u2032\u00b5 \u2212m2\u03c6\u2020\u03c6\u2212\n( \u03b4m2\n2 \u03c6 2 + h.c.\n) (2.8)\nwhere the mass term \u03b4m2 explicitly breaks U(1)\u2032 and splits the real scalars \u03c61 and \u03c62, which acquire squared masses m2 \u2213 \u03b4m2, respectively.

In this case, the annihilation cross-section \u03c61\u03c61 \u2194 ff\u0304 , as well as the \u03c61 elastic scattering off nuclei, are generated at the 1-loop level and will thus be parametrically suppressed by a factor ( /(4\u03c0))4, sufficient to avoid the present constraints. In what follows we will use the interaction Lagrangians of eqs. (2.7) and (2.9) for our phenomenological analysis. In the discussion above and in the following, we consider the case of a dark photon heavier than the iDM pair, i.e. m\u2032A > m1 +m2. The opposite limit corresponds to the secluded dark matter scenario [31], which has a different phenomenology. In that case, at colliders, which is the main focus of our work, A\u2032 will decay into SM particles, rather than iDM pairs. Moreover, in the early Universe, the DM abundance is controlled by the annihilations D1D1 \u2192 A\u2032A\u2032. These processes are strongly constrained by CMB and indirect detection bounds, see e.g. [32, 33]. Before concluding this section, we discuss current experimental bounds on the dark photon parameter space. Depending on the relative importance of and gd, the dark photon may decay mainly visibly (into SM particles) or invisibly (into dark sector particles) [34]. Since we are interested in the case in which the interactions between A\u2032 and the dark pair D1D2 are sufficiently strong to allow for DM thermal production, in this work we consider only the so-called \u201cinvisible\u201d dark photon. Focussing on the region mA\u2032 & 1MeV, the most stringent bounds come from the dedicated search at BaBar [35] and electroweak precision measurements at LEP [30]. The BaBar limits dominate in the region mA\u2032 . 8GeV, constraining . 10\u22123 in most of the parameter space and becoming as strong as . 4\u00d710\u22124 for masses mA\u2032 \u223c (4 \u00f7 6)GeV. On the other hand, LEP bounds dominate for larger A\u2032 masses and, as long as mA\u2032 6= mZ , put a milder bound of . 2\u00d7 10\u22122. Around mA\u2032 ' mZ the limit becomes stronger, improving by roughly one order of magnitude. In addition, in this region the mixing between the A\u2032 and Z bosons is close to maximal, with the Z boson potentially decaying into the dark states. For this reason, we also consider the bounds from Z \u2192 invisible [36]."

The first term can be simply obtained from the production cross-section of D1D2 pairs, that we evaluate with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, and the total integrated luminosity received by a given experiment, listed in section 3.2. Instead, the quantity fsignal can be computed as:\nfsignal = \u3008 fdec det \u3009 , (3.1)\nwhere fdec corresponds to the probability for a D2 particle to decay inside the detector and it is given by:\nfdec = e\u2212Lentry/LD2 \u2212 e\u2212(Lexit)/LD2 . (3.2)\nIt depends on the distance between the LHC IP and the point at which the D2 particle enters (exits) the detector Lentry (Lexit), and the decay length of D2 in the laboratory (LAB) frame, given by LD2 = c \u03c4D2\u03b3D2\u03b2D2 . Here \u03c4D2 is the decay time of D2, while \u03b2D2 and \u03b3D2 are respectively its speed in units of speed of light (c), and its Lorentz factor, in the LAB frame. Clearly, fdec vanishes for those trajectories of D2 which do not intersect the detector. In the region of interest, the main contribution to the D2 decay width comes from the decays D2 \u2192 D1ff\u0304 into a pair of SM fermions. While the contribution into leptons is straightforward to compute, for quarks we need to worry about the validity of perturbative QCD. We follow the strategy outlined in [19] and use a perturbative computation when m2 \u2212m1 > 2GeV, while in the opposite case we use chiral perturbation theory and vector mesons matrix elements to capture the hadronic decays. For more details, see [19]. Eq. (3.1) is computed averaging (\u3008\u00b7\u3009) over all the possible kinematical configurations of the D2 particles. For this purpose, we produced a sample of D1D2 events with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, that we then use to statistically evaluate eq. (3.1). Finally, in eq. (3.1), the quantity det takes into account the efficiency for the reconstruction of the events (that we simply take as 100%), and selection cuts. For the latter we impose a requirement on the energy of the visible final states employing the following strategy. Using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO we generate a sample of decays of D2 \u2192 D1ll\u0304, where l is a lepton. We then perform the appropriate Lorentz boost to go from the D2 frame to the LAB frame, we evaluate the sum of energies of the two leptons Evis, the visible particles, and we impose Evis > Ecut. The fraction of the events satisfying this requirement leads to the quantity det in eq. (3.1). This procedure can be used to evaluate det for each D1D2 event produced in our simulation. For FASER and FASER 2, we take Ecut = 100GeV, mimicking the cut considered in [3], for AL3X we adopt Ecut = 3GeV, as in [10], while for FACET Ecut = 10GeV [14]. For all the other experiments, we take Ecut = 1GeV, which is in the range of energy thresholds considered in [6].

The main results are presented in figure 1 and\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 0 0\nMATHUSLA FASER FASER 2 ANUBIS MAPP 1 MAPP2 2 CODEXb AL3X FACET 1 10 102 10-5 10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\nm1 [GeV]\n\u03f5\n\u0394=0.1 mA'/m1=3 MATHUSLA Ecut>1 GeV MATHUSLA Ecut>2 GeV FASER 2 Ecut>100 GeV FASER 2 Ecut>200 GeV 1 10 102 10-5 10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\nm1 [GeV]\n\u03f5\n\u0394=0.1 mA'/m1=3\nFigure 2. Left panel: the same as figure 1 but for the case of the scalar iDM model described in section 2.2. For illustration, we only show the case of the first benchmark considered (\u2206 = 0.1,mA\u2032/m1 = 3) as the results between the scalar and fermionic cases do not differ drastically for most of the experiments. Right panel: projected sensitivities of MATHUSLA and FASER 2 for the fermionic iDM model and for two choices of the energy threshold Ecut.\nfigure 2. The shaded grey region depicts the current experimental constraints on the invisible dark photon already mentioned in section 2, coming from BaBar [35] and LEP [30]. Since in the region mA\u2032 \u223c mZ the Z boson coupling to the dark states is not suppressed, we also include the bound coming from the Z invisible decay [36]. The colored contours, on the other hand, show the projected future sensitivities of the experiments listed in section 3.2. Finally, along the dashed black line the D1 abundance matches the observed one. Figure 1 and figure 2 correspond to the fermionic iDM (see section 2.1) and scalar iDM (see section 2.2) models, respectively. The forecasted sensitivities are very similar between the fermionic and scalar cases for most of the experiments. This can be understood in the following way: on the one hand, the lifetimes of \u03c72 and \u03c62 are very similar, and the same is true for production of fermionic and scalar iDM pairs from on-shell dark photon decays. On the other hand, events with very off-shell dark photons give rise to different energy distributions depending on the dark states spin, and this explain the differences observed among the two scenarios. For this reason, in figure 2 we only show the benchmark \u2206 = 0.1 and mA\u2032/m1 = 3. Concerning the predictions for the DM relic abundance, the difference between the fermionic and scalar cases is instead more pronounced, due to the different velocity dependence of the non-relativistic annihilation cross-section. As shown in figure 1 and figure 2, we find that most of the experiments will be able to probe regions of parameter space not excluded by current data and in which D1 can be 100% of the DM. More specifically we see that, for \u2206 = 0.1, the thermal line will be completely probed for m1 . 10GeV, while for \u2206 = 0.01 the thermal line will be approximately covered in all the parameter space considered. Comparing the \u2206 = 0.1 and 0.01 cases, we see that for the latter choice the sensitivity of LHC experiments moves to larger values of m1 and . This can be qualitatively understood looking at the decay width of D2 \u2192 D1ff\u0304 . In the limit of massless fermions and for small \u2206 we have \u0393 \u221d 2\u22065m51/m4A\u2032 [21]. A decrease of \u2206 can be compensated with an\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 0 0\nincrease of and m1 to obtain the same decay width (and hence lifetime), reproducing the behaviour observed. Instead, moving from \u2206 = 0.1 and 0.01 has only a modest impact on the predictions for the DM relic abundance. The situation is different for what concerns the role of the ratio between the dark photon and the DM mass. Going from mA\u2032/m1 = 3 to mA\u2032/m1 = 6 reduces the impact of the dark photon resonance for the DM annihilations in the early Universe. This implies that larger values of should be considered to obtain the same DM relic abundance. Let us also stress once more that the predictions for the DM abundance could be completely different in presence of non-thermal production mechanisms or scenarios of non-standard cosmology. Concerning the different experiments, as evident from the discussion in section 3, the sensitivity depends on a combination of several ingredients: the proximity of the detectors to the IP, their off-axis vs on-axis geometry, their size, luminosity received, and other factors such as the selection cuts performed in the analysis. As shown in figure 1 and figure 2, the different facilities considered here are complementary, but at the same time they cover overlapping regions of the parameter space. The sensitivity reach of the AL3X experiment is particularly remarkable, although the feasibility of this proposal strongly depends on the overlap with the ALICE physics program [10]. The ANUBIS experiment allows to reach sensitivities comparable to the ones for MATHUSLA despite the smaller detector size, a factor which is compensated by its proximity to the IP. From figure 1 and figure 2 one can notice that MATHUSLA typically probes slightly smaller values of , but ANUBIS allows to test complementary parts of the parameter space (see e.g. the region around m1 \u223c 20GeV in figure 2). The recently proposed forward detector FACET also offers good sensitivities. The main advantage with respect to the FASER 2 is its proximity to the IP (101 m for FACET and 650 m for FASER 2) and the larger solid angle coverage. These features allow an increased sensitivity with respect to FASER 2, at least as long as the background can be reduced to negligible levels as assumed in the original proposal [14]. The projected reach of MAPP 2 is complementary to the ones previously mentioned, despite the smaller integrated luminosity that this detector will receive (0.3 ab\u22121 instead of 3 ab\u22121). At masses m1 & 10GeV, the sensitivity curves are qualitatively similar to the ones for MATHUSLA, but shifted to larger values of . Overall, these facilities are complementary to CODEXb, FASER (FASER 2) and MATHUSLA, previously considered in [21], surpassing their sensitivities in some regions of the parameter space. At qualitative level, similar results have been found for different models, see e.g. [14, 42\u201344]. However, the comparison of one particular experiment over the others strongly depends on the physical scenario under consideration, motivating therefore our dedicated study for iDM. Concerning CODEXb, FASER 2 and MATHUSLA, we have found results similar to [21], once the same setup is adopted. For this study, we have used the most updated geometry proposals for FASER 2 and MATHUSLA. These lead to slightly decreased performances for the former detector, and increased sensitivities for the latter (especially around m1 ' 20GeV for the scenarios with \u2206 = 0.1 and mA\u2032/m1 = 3). Finally, we shall mention that searches of iDM complementary to those analyzed here can be performed at ATLAS, CMS and LHCb looking for displaced muons and time-delayed tracks [21], and at Belle II with displaced vertices and missing momentum signatures [45, 46].\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 0 0"

            "text": "We have considered a model of fermionic (and scalar) iDM coupled to the SM via a dark photon mediator. In this simple scenario, even for relatively light DM, it is possible to obtain the observed cosmological DM abundance via the standard freeze-out mechanism and, at the same time, fulfill the constraints from direct and indirect DM searches and CMB observations. The heaviest iDM state can be long-lived and it can be searched for at proposed LHC experiments. In this paper, we have updated and extended the analysis in [21], considering the future detectors FASER, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, AL3X, MAPP, ANUBIS and FACET. The main results are shown in figure 1 and figure 2. We find that the experimental facilities discussed here offer promising prospects for detection. They can cover complementary regions of the parameter space, significantly extending the reach of current and past experiments. In the case of the mass ratio mA\u2032/m1 = 6, and for the range of \u2206 considered 0.01 < \u2206 < 0.1, they will be able to completely probe the parameter space in which the lightest state constitutes 100% of the DM via the standard thermal freeze-out scenario."
