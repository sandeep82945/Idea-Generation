    "abstractText": "IMPORTANCE Time-based billing options for physicians have expanded, enabling many physicians to bill according to time spent instead of medical decision-making (MDM) level for fee-for-service outpatient visits. However, no study to date has estimated the revenue changes associated with timebased billing. OBJECTIVE To compare evaluation and management (E/M) reimbursement for physicians using time-based billing vs MDM-based billing for outpatient visits of varying lengths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This economic evaluation used 2019 billing data for outpatient E/M codes and 2021 reimbursement rates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Modeling of generic clinic templates was performed to estimate expected yearly E/M revenues for a single full-time physician working in an outpatient clinic using fee-for-service billing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Yearly E/M revenues for different patient visit templates were modeled. The standardized length of return patient visits was 10 to 45 minutes, and new patient visits were twice as long in duration. RESULTS Under MDM-based billing, increased visit length was associated with decreased E/M revenue ($564 188 for 30-minute new patient visit/15-minute return patient visit vs $423 137 for 40-minute new patient visit/20-minute return patient visit). Under time-based billing, yearly E/M revenue remained similar across increasing visit lengths ($400 432 for 30-minute new patient visit/ 15-minute return patient visit vs $458 718 for 40-minute new patient visit/20-minute return patient visit). Compared with time-based billing, MDM-based billing was associated with higher E/M revenue for 10to 15-minute return patient visits ($400 432 vs $564 188). Time-based billing was associated with higher E/M revenue for return patient visits lasting 20 minutes or longer. The highest modeled E/M revenue of $846 273 occurred for 10-minute return patient visits under MDM-based billing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this study showed that the relative economic benefits of MDM-based billing and time-based billing differed and were associated with the length of patient visits. Physicians with longer patient visits were more likely to experience revenue increases from using time-based billing than physicians with shorter patient visits.

Under time-based billing, yearly E/M revenue remained similar across increasing visit lengths ($400 432 for 30-minute new patient visit/ 15-minute return patient visit vs $458 718 for 40-minute new patient visit/20-minute return patient visit). Compared with time-based billing, MDM-based billing was associated with higher E/M revenue for 10- to 15-minute return patient visits ($400 432 vs $564 188). Time-based billing was associated with higher E/M revenue for return patient visits lasting 20 minutes or longer. The highest modeled E/M revenue of $846 273 occurred for 10-minute return patient visits under MDM-based billing.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this study showed that the relative economic benefits of MDM-based billing and time-based billing differed and were associated with the length of patient visits. Physicians with longer patient visits were more likely to experience revenue increases from using time-based billing than physicians with shorter patient visits.\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(8):e2229504. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29504"

Historically, time-based billing has counted only time spent face-to-face with patients.4 However, substantial changes to time-based billing occurred in the 2021 E/M guidelines. The 2021 guidelines allow physicians to bill for face-to-face time and for previously unreimbursed time spent on medical record review, documentation, and coordination of care on the day of the patient encounter.3,12 Because time-based billing monetizes previously unreimbursed services, it offers physicians an opportunity to increase revenue, compared with MDM-based billing, which still does not reimburse for these services. However, variations in patient panels and clinic schedules may be factors in different lengths of an average patient visit.13,14 In turn, individual physicians are likely to see different outcomes associated with these changes in billing. Changes to the economic incentives for different visit lengths could have downstream implications for clinic scheduling and patient access.\nIn this study, we aimed to compare E/M reimbursement for physicians using time-based billing vs MDM-based billing for outpatient visits of varying lengths. Specifically, to identify the economic incentives of expanded time-based billing for E/M revenue in different practices, we performed modeling of the expected E/M revenue for a single physician working in a primary care clinic. We then performed sensitivity analyses to illustrate how these billing changes altered the incentives for specialty physicians as well. We hypothesized that physicians with longer encounters would benefit the most from time-based billing."

We followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline.\nThe modeling of yearly E/M revenues for an individual full-time physician compared MDM-based billing revenue with time-based billing revenue. We defined full-time work as 8 hours a day of seeing patients for 220 days a year. We limited the analysis to new and return outpatient visits with CPT codes 99202 to 99215, which represent the codes physicians can use for time-based billing.4 To calculate the proportion of new and return visits seen by PCPs, we used 2018 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) summary data.15 We then assumed that the physician in the model matched the proportions from the NAMCS data, with 8.5% new patient visits and 91.5% return patient visits.15 We also assumed that the physician scheduled twice as much time to see new patients as return patients. These assumptions allowed us to construct yearly schedules for physicians to see patients at different time intervals.\nThe shortest patient visit template gave physicians 20-minute visits with new patients and 10-minute visits with return patients. We analyzed schedules at regular-length visits until the longest duration, which gave physicians 90 minutes for new patient visits and 45 minutes for return patient visits. From these schedules, we calculated the number of new and return patient visits that a physician seeing patients at each time interval would have per year. Although physicians can specify MDM-based billing or time-based billing for individual patients, the physician in the model used the same billing modality for all visits to enable a comparison of the maximal incentives offered by each billing method.\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(8):e2229504. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29504 (Reprinted) August 31, 2022 2/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/25/2024"

Substituting cardiology\u2019s billing distribution of higher mean E/M levels compared with primary care was associated with a 15% increase in all E/M revenues for MDM-based billing across visit lengths (eg, from $423 137 to $486 024 for 40-minute new patient visits and 20-minute return patient visits) (Table 2). This shift played a role in time-based billing compared with MDM-based billing maximizing E/M revenue only when new patient visits were 60 minutes or longer and when return patient visits were 30 minutes or longer. In contrast, using dermatology\u2019s lower E/M billing distribution was associated with a 32% decrease in all E/M revenues for MDM-based billing across visit lengths (from $423 137 to $287 849 for 40-minute new patient visits and 20-minute return patient visits). This shift played a role in time-based billing compared with MDM-based billing having greater E/M revenue starting at 30-minute new patient visits and 15-minute return patient visits. Table 2 shows that MDM-based revenue results were sensitive to the conversion factor used to account for unreimbursed work in MDM-based billing. We found that MDM-based revenue increased by 36% across visit lengths when the conversion factor was increased to 1 (from $423 137 to $574 980 for 40-minute new patient visits and 20-minute return patient visits), and MDM-based revenue decreased by 12% when the conversion factor was decreased to 0.65 (from $423 137 to $373 737 for 40-minute new patient visits and 20-minute return patient visits). Increasing the percentage of new patient visits to the 23% new patient rate of specialty physicians affected all E/M revenue calculations by less than 10% (Table 2). For this higher proportion of new patient visits, time-based billing was associated with more revenue than MDM-based billing starting at 40-minute new patient visits and 20-minute return patient visits ($418 978 vs $387 757). Using facility price reimbursement levels was associated with lowered E/M revenues globally without affecting the previously noted association between MDM-based billing and time-based billing (eTable in the Supplement)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "A variety of factors were associated with the length of patient visits, but any clinic must consider economic incentives to maintain its financial viability. The underlying hypothesis that physicians change their billing practices in response to shifting billing incentives is already supported by data, such as a recent study reporting that physicians began billing at higher levels just after the expansion of time-based billing.18 In the present economic evaluation, the models suggested that E/M revenue from MDM-based billing was associated with the number of patients seen per hour, incentivizing shorter patient visits. Conversely, we found that time-based billing removed the association between patients seen per hour and revenue, allowing physicians to have longer patient visits without a loss of E/M revenue. In this modeling, shorter visit lengths were associated with MDM-based billing that earned more revenue, although we acknowledge that physicians are unlikely to bill higher levels of MDM with extremely short visits. As clinic visits became longer, time-based billing became the revenue-maximizing strategy. Moreover, MDM-based billing and time-based billing yielded the most similar revenues in the model for 40-minute new patient visits and 20-minute return patient visits. This visit length in the model was associated with reported mean visit lengths in actual practice, suggesting that time-based billing has limited implications for many clinics.15,18,23\nThe highest E/M revenues in this study were associated with a combination of short patient visits and MDM-based billing. This finding demonstrates that time-based billing is unlikely to change financial incentives given for shorter visits.24,25 However, physicians with lower volume and longer patient visits can benefit from time-based billing in multiple ways. Because the models showed E/M revenue was greater with time-based billing at longer visits, physicians with longer patient visits were more likely to gain a revenue increase from the time-based billing option than physicians who scheduled shorter patient visits. In addition, because there was no association between E/M revenue and visit length under time-based billing, physicians with longer patient visits could further extend their patient visit length without a noticeable decrease in E/M revenue. Previous studies have shown that physicians with time constraints are less likely to complete preventive medicine tasks.26,27\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(8):e2229504. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29504 (Reprinted) August 31, 2022 6/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/25/2024\nTherefore, the flexibility in patient scheduling afforded by time-based billing could help physicians better address preventive medicine.28 A decrease in patients per hour could also be used to help physicians complete non\u2013face-to-face tasks, such as documentation, that traditionally have been pushed to after hours, potentially contributing to decreased physician burnout.29,30 At the national level, longer patient visits with a fixed health care workforce could be a factor in limited patient access to their physicians. Moreover, by reimbursing only physician time, time-based billing may penalize efficient physicians and team-based clinic workflows and reward inefficiencies while increasing health care costs.\nHigh-volume and low-volume clinics are often located in different areas and serve different patient populations.8,9 As such, the finding that time-based billing is less advantageous for highvolume clinics than low-volume clinics could have implications for health equity. As a corollary, highvolume, low-acuity specialties may be less likely to benefit from time-based billing.31\nDownstream sources of revenue and the health care system within which a clinic operates were factors in a clinic\u2019s scheduling, suggesting that E/M revenue does not exist in a vacuum. Similarly, individual physicians affiliated with a large health care system may react more directly to economic incentives affecting their personal earnings, not the clinic\u2019s overall revenue.32 Still, previous studies have found that clinics respond to economic incentives.14,18,32,33 More research is needed to better understand the complex economic associations between outpatient scheduling and billing incentives."

            "text": "This study has some strengths. The findings are generalizable to different specialties and clinics. The study reported yearly E/M revenue for a full-time physician, but the relative difference between MDM-based billing revenue and time-based billing revenue was unchanged for physicians not working a 40-hour work week. By incorporating data on after-hours documentation, we also accounted for the much longer work hours actually spent by many physicians who are scheduled to be in clinic for 40 hours a week.6-8 Although the base-case scenario used PCP billing data, the analysis can be readily repeated for specialty or even clinic-specific data. For example, we used previously published work to estimate the mean time spent on unreimbursed tasks per patient, but physicians can substitute individual data to obtain a personalized estimate.\nThis study also has some key limitations. First, we used Medicare data to identify the distribution of CPT codes for MDM-based billing. If Medicare beneficiaries required more MDM than patients without Medicare coverage, then use of Medicare data artificially increased the MDM-based billing revenues. We also were unable to account for the implications of recent changes to simplify MDM-billing guidelines because the MDM billing distribution in the model used 2019 data.\nSecond, we assumed that physicians used either MDM-based billing or time-based billing for all of their patient encounters. In actual practice, a physician can choose whichever billing method can generate a higher reimbursement.4 Similarly, in the model, the calculations held constant the E/M billing distribution for MDM across different lengths of visits. In practice, short patient visits are more likely to be coded at lower E/M levels, potentially contributing to MDM-based revenue being artificially high at shorter visits. Furthermore, longer visits are more likely to be coded at higher E/M levels, which could be associated with MDM-based revenue calculations being lower for longer visits.\nThird, the E/M revenue model excluded services other than patient visits with CPT codes 99201 to 99215 and thus did not consider other sources of revenue, such as preventive health visits or procedures. The model also did not consider downstream revenue associated with ancillary services (eg, laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging) or referrals made during visits. The financial value of these services and referrals can be much greater than the E/M revenue associated with direct patient visits.34 Downstream revenue is likely to vary greatly between specialties and even practices within a specialty but regardless serves as an economic argument against longer patient visits. Even if timebased billing allows a physician to not lose direct E/M revenue with longer patient visits, fewer visits may ultimately be a factor in decreased downstream revenue. For example, PCPs affiliated with a\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(8):e2229504. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29504 (Reprinted) August 31, 2022 7/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/25/2024\nlarge health care system generate referrals to that system\u2019s specialists, providing a source of revenue that goes well beyond the individual physician.

            "text": "In this economic evaluation, we reported yearly E/M revenue earned exclusively through MDM-based billing or time-based billing for an individual physician receiving 2021 CMS nonfacility price reimbursement rates. The economic benefits of MDM-based billing and time-based billing were associated with the length of patient visits. Using time-based billing, physicians with longer patient visits were more likely to experience revenue increases than physicians with shorter patient encounters. Possible future changes to billing regulations may have similar implications for physicians\u2019 economic incentives. Further studies using clinic- or system-level data may clarify the association of indirect and downstream revenue with the economic incentives offered by timebased billing.\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: July 17, 2022.\nPublished: August 31, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29504\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Miksanek TJ et al.
