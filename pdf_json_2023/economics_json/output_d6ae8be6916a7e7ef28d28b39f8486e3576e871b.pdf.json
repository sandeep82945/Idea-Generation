Osteoporosis affects 10\u201330% of women aged 40 + , and up to 10% of men in 7 developed economies in Asia Pacific. Fractures affect 500\u20131000 adults aged 50 + per 100,000 person-years. Policymakers and clinicians must address this problem. Purpose Osteoporosis and associated fractures result in considerable morbidity, loss of productivity, early mortality, and increased healthcare expenses. Many countries in the Asia Pacific (AP) region, especially middleand higher-income economies, are faced with aging and increasingly sedentary populations. It is critical to consolidate and analyze the available information on the prevalence and incidence of the disease in these countries. Methods We systematically reviewed articles and gray literature for Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, JSTOR, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and other databases for data published 2009\u20132018. We included articles with prevalence or incidence estimates for adults with osteoporosis or related fractures. Results All locations had data available, but of widely varying quantity and quality. Most estimates for osteoporosis prevalence ranged from 10 to 30% for women ages 40 and older, and up to 10% for men. Osteoporotic fracture incidence typically ranged between 500 and 1000 per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 50 and older. Both outcomes typically increased with age and were more common among women. Conclusion Osteoporosis and associated fractures affect significant portions of the adult population in developed economies in the AP region. Governments and healthcare systems must consider how best to prevent and diagnose osteoporosis, and manage affected individuals, to reduce healthcare costs and mortality associated with fractures.",

            "text": "Osteoporosis and associated fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality and represent a major source of non-communicable disease burden and healthcare resource utilization around the world.\nThe Asia Pacific (AP) region is comprised of South Asia, South-East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. An audit conducted in 2013 by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) encompassing 16 countries revealed a dearth of epidemiological information on osteoporosis and related fractures in the AP region [1]. In addition, only about one-fourth of the countries in the audit considered osteoporosis a national health priority, despite the burden of the disease and related fractures placed on healthcare institutions, reimbursement services, and patients. The number of people affected by osteoporosis and related fractures in this region is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades, largely due to the region\u2019s aging population, increasing urbanization, and its associated sedentary lifestyles. By 2050, more than 50% of the world\u2019s osteoporotic fractures are expected to occur in Asia, which will strain healthcare and government resources, especially considering the significant shortcomings in the quality and availability of health services for osteoporosis and related fractures currently present in many AP nations [1].\nSince many individuals with poor bone health are still of working age and actively contributing to these countries\u2019 economies, lost productivity and increased healthcare expenditures caused by preventable disease, fractures, and even deaths may become a heavy economic and societal burden. About one in four individuals suffering a hip fracture dies within a year, and other fragility fractures are also associated with premature mortality. Osteoporosis is more common in women, but its impact on health and survival is more marked in men than in women [2, 3].\nProfessional and health service organizations in the region are increasingly taking note of the importance of addressing osteoporosis and related fractures on a large scale. Organizations such as the Asia Pacific Consortium on Osteoporosis (APCO) and the IOF are working to highlight the economic, social, and health impact of osteoporosis and related fractures in the AP region. The knowledge and support of these organizations are available to provide governments the information and guidance they may need to craft action plans, data acquisition efforts, healthcare reimbursement policies, and more.\nThough the governments of some of the more developed economies in the region have begun to recognize osteoporosis as a healthcare priority, a lack of in-depth understanding of the impact that osteoporosis and related fractures have on populations, healthcare systems, and the\neconomy still exists. It is therefore crucial to gather data on the epidemiology of the disease in these locations to mitigate this gap in knowledge.\nThe objective of this systematic literature review was to obtain location-specific, epidemiological estimates of the prevalence and incidence of osteoporosis and related fractures in seven upper-middle- and high-income economies in the AP region: Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Estimates from any age, sex, or ethnicity group were of interest, provided the studies included at least one study arm considered reasonably representative of the broader population from which they were selected. The findings can be used by the governments of these countries and regions to inform policies or strategies for addressing poor bone health and its related societal burden."

In phase two, two reviewers independently reviewed all full-text articles, compared their decisions to align on any articles with mismatched selection status, and consulted the lead reviewer as needed for questions or final decisions. Translations were not obtained for the small number of non-English resources.\nOne reviewer extracted all data from the papers selected for inclusion and subsequently scored each included article for quality according to the criteria in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute\u2019s (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies [6]. NHLBI quality scores were recorded for each article and considered in interpretation of the findings. Quality assessment checks of the data and study quality categorizations were made by the lead data reviewer (author KB) at least once at each step.\nData sought included location/country, sex, age, and other pertinent population details; year(s) in which the research was conducted; densitometry technology used\nfor diagnosis of osteoporosis, criteria, and anatomical location of screening (heel, spine, hip, etc.); study type (longitudinal, review, cross-sectional, etc.); and estimates provided for prevalence of osteoporosis or incidence of related fracture, by body site. Summary tables were developed to provide location-specific ranges of osteoporosis prevalence and hip and vertebral fracture incidence by age group and sex."

Prevalence among women trended higher than among men in every age group and also appeared to increase with age [54, 55, 58, 59], although few estimates were found for women under 50.

Narrower age group prevalence estimates suggested that after the age of 50, prevalence (starting below 10% in ages 50\u201359) grew 10\u201320% with each decade of life [54, 55]. Femoral neck fracture incidence also varied considerably (with several estimates below 500 per 100,000 person-years for both men and women aged 50 +) [62\u201364] but appeared to increase with age, surpassing 1300 per 100,000 person-years in women by age 80 + [37, 49].

            "text": "In total, 316 papers were obtained discussing at least one of the two primary outcomes of interest, providing a detailed overview of the prevalence and incidence of\n1 3\nosteoporosis and related fractures in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. The preponderance of evidence from this study suggests that 5\u201310% or more of all adults in these seven developed economies suffer from osteoporosis. This is likely an underestimate due to a lack of formal or frequent testing, the silent nature of the disease prior to fractures, and the tendency not to medically treat the condition, which may leave many people unaware of their status (even after lowtrauma fractures), and result in a lack of data in treatmentbased databases. This study reflects a higher osteoporosis prevalence in many populations aged 50 + (20\u201340% and sometimes much higher), especially among women. Highend estimates of osteoporosis exceeded 50% in elderly female populations in many locations.\nIn most of the locations, estimates for hip fracture ranged between 500 and 1000 cases per 100,000 person-years, although estimates two or three times that rate became more common with increased age. Vertebral fracture incidence was most often reported between 200 and 600 cases per 100,000 person-years. Estimates of non-specified or general fragility fractures, or data reporting multiple types of fractures as a combined incidence, suggest that these locations have an overall fracture incidence of up to 2000 per 100,000 person-years, with some much higher and many (likely not all-inclusive fracture estimates) slightly below 1000 per 100,000.\nStudies published after the period of this review offer further data supporting the substantial prevalence of osteoporosis and related fractures in these locations. A recent\n1 3\nAustralian study reported secondary data suggesting that 20% of men and women aged 50 + will experience a vertebral fragility fracture and that this risk increases with age [114]. Recent literature in China supported osteoporosis prevalence estimates of 20\u201340% for women and near or less than 10% among men [115\u2013121], with related fracture incidence in the low hundreds per 100,000 person-years for adults aged 50 + [122]. Recent literature suggested a general osteoporotic fracture incidence of 971 per 100,000 personyears among women in Japan [123]. In Singapore, recent estimates range from 9.3 to 19.4% [124, 125] for the prevalence of osteoporosis among postmenopausal women and 0.7% among men aged 50 + [124]. One large Singaporean fracture database study reported that 7% of women ages 50 + had a history of fragility fracture [126], and a study examining hip fracture incidence in adults ages 50 + reported age-adjusted incidence of 253 per 100,000 among women\nand 125 among men [127]. Another study from Singapore reported estimated vertebral fracture rates of 300 and 130 per 100,000 for women and men, respectively, and other osteoporotic fracture rates of 465 and 205 per 100,000 for women and men, respectively [128]. In South Korea, osteoporosis prevalence was recently reported to be 22.4% among adults aged 50 + [129]. Another South Korean study found a prevalence of 3.97% and 6.93% among all Koreans taking part in its National Health Insurance and Medical Aid programs, respectively, with an incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures of 389\u2013408 per 100,000 person-years in Medical Aid recipients [130]; another study found that 17.9% of patients with a fragility fracture experienced a subsequent fracture, usually in less than 1\u00a0year [131]. In Taiwan, a large study reported osteoporosis prevalence of 18.13% in women and 17.95% in men aged 40 + [132]. Another Taiwanese study reported the combined incidence of developing\n1 3\nosteoporosis or suffering a fragility fracture to be 23.8 per 1,000 person-years [133].\nIt is clear that osteoporosis and associated fractures are a health issue of significant import for these AP countries and regions. In our review, the most robust data were available for adults in middle to late age, and osteoporosis and related fractures were generally more common among women than men. Due to the large and growing elderly populations in the AP region, the reported rates of osteoporosis can be expected to produce growing numbers of annual hip and other osteoporotic fractures in many nations, with significant mortality and consequences for economic, societal, and population health."

In Singapore alone, it is estimated that increased treatment of osteoporosis could avoid nearly 30,000 fractures from 2017\u20132035, and result in a cost savings of more than SGD330 million in that time period [128]. As osteoporosis and related fractures can result in significant health expenditures, lost work time and productivity, reduced quality of life, and reduced relative survival [135, 136], it behooves governments and healthcare systems in the AP region to consider how best to implement policies and processes for preventing osteoporosis, identifying it and its risk factors in adult men and women, and managing affected populations, in order to reduce the risk of initial and subsequent fractures.\nThe data obtained and reviewed for this study can potentially inform additional research on osteoporosis, related fractures, and their impact in the AP region, as well as subpopulation research to better understand osteoporosis\n1 3\nincidence and prevalence among adults with common comorbidities. This can then translate into public education, awareness, and screening campaigns and pave the way for policy and healthcare funding agency decision-making about osteoporosis treatment and fracture prevention."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "There are some limitations to this review. There was substantial variation in the data available and in the probable generalizability of the data. This was expected due to multiple reasons, including differences in resources and variations in reference groups for young BMD comparisons for T-scores. It has been shown that southeast Asians have lower BMD than Caucasians [145], and an overestimation of osteoporosis is likely if Caucasian normative data are used to determine T-scores [146, 147]. It is difficult to draw any\nconclusive comparisons regarding the rates of osteoporosis and related fractures in the locations of interest, due to the differences in the studies\u2019 reported data age ranges; definitions of the conditions of interest and outcomes reported; highly varied cultural, ethnic, and geographic groups; statistical adjustments to data; measurement sites, bone mineral density measurement device types, and reference data for BMD measurements; inclusion of secondary data and selfreported data; and time periods for original data collection. These variations limit comparisons across, and even within, the selected locations. Without further refining the data to allow direct comparison of more standardized populations, it will be difficult to reliably estimate osteoporosis prevalence and related fractures in the AP region.\nThe quality of some of the data collected may limit the validity of summary conclusions, even within the included locations. Many of the studies included in this review reported secondary data or small group/sub-population findings, which, together with quality limitations for some studies, reduce the generalizability of the findings. It is also probable that many \u201call adult\u201d estimates reported as secondary data represented narrower groups in their original studies, which could result in overestimations when reported as a figure for the entire adult population. Potential publication bias or bias stemming from oversampling of the most at-risk populations by virtue of gathering participants from hospitals and adults already engaged in bone health cohort studies, as numerous studies did, could also result in overestimation of the problem.\nVariation in osteoporosis definitions and technology, such as DXA versus quantitative ultrasound (QUS), makes some of the data difficult to compare; DXA is not widely available in rural or low-income areas, so this problem is likely to persist in the AP region. This is further complicated by a lack of local population reference BMD T-score values for both technologies. Numerous studies reported sizeable differences in prevalence estimates based on the reference data and scan site. It is possible that studies using Caucasian reference data, or even non-native Asian reference databases, do not provide accurate or appropriate estimates for certain AP populations. Until more localized reference datasets for BMD in young, healthy individuals can be obtained, however, this problem will affect many of the region\u2019s osteoporosis findings.\nFinally, this study did not include local language results or papers older than ten years at the time of execution due to the volume of search results eligible for full-text review."
