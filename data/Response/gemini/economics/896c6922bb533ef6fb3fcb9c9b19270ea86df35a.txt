1. **The impact of ESG performance on audit fees.** The paper finds that ESG performance is associated with a lower probability of an MAO, but it does not examine the impact of ESG performance on audit fees. Future research could investigate whether ESG performance is also associated with lower audit fees.
2. **The impact of ESG performance on the cost of capital.** The paper finds that ESG performance is associated with a lower probability of an MAO, which could lead to a lower cost of capital for companies with good ESG performance. Future research could investigate the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of capital.
3. **The impact of ESG performance on firm value.** The paper finds that ESG performance is associated with a lower probability of an MAO, which could lead to a higher firm value for companies with good ESG performance. Future research could investigate the relationship between ESG performance and firm value.
4. **The impact of ESG performance on auditor tenure.** The paper finds that auditor experience moderates the relationship between ESG performance and audit opinion, but it does not examine the impact of ESG performance on auditor tenure. Future research could investigate whether ESG performance is also associated with longer auditor tenure.
5. **The impact of ESG performance on auditor switching.** The paper finds that ESG performance is associated with a lower probability of an MAO, which could lead to less auditor switching for companies with good ESG performance. Future research could investigate the relationship between ESG performance and auditor switching.
