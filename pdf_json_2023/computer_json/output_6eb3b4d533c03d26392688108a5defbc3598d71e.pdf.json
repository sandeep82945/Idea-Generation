    "abstractText": "Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic still poses a major global health threat. In this setting, a number of useful machine learning applications have been explored to assist clinical decision-making, predict the severity of disease and admission to the intensive care unit, and also to estimate future demand for hospital beds, equipment, and staff. The present study examined demographic data, hematological and biochemical markers routinely measured in Covid-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a public tertiary hospital, in relation to the ICU outcome, during the second and third Covid-19 waves, from October 2020 until February 2022. In this dataset, we applied eight well-known classifiers of the caret package for machine learning of the R programming language, to evaluate their performance in forecasting ICU mortality. The best performance regarding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was observed with Random Forest (0.82), while k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) were the lowest performing machine learning algorithm (AUC-ROC: 0.59). However, in terms of sensitivity, XGB outperformed the other classifiers (max Sens: 0.7). The six most important predictors of mortality in the Random Forest model were serum urea, age, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, platelets, and lymphocyte count.",

As of 9 December 2022, 643,875,406 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6,630,082 deaths, have been reported to WHO [1]. One of the biggest challenges facing healthcare systems around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic is the surge in patient numbers and concomitant limited medical resources. Several recent studies suggest that machine learning-based predictive models of disease severity and outcome could meet these requirements in the best possible way permitting efficient allocation of resources in the intensive care unit [2-7]. However, no sufficiently validated prognostic models are currently in wide clinical use.\nIn this study, we aim to compare the performance of eight different machine\nlearning methods for predicting the mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), using a simple dataset containing demographic information and results of routine laboratory tests. We also aim to identify the most important variables associated with ICU mortality using machine learning methods."

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Sismanogleio General Hospital (no. 4333/2022). For this analysis, we used the caret package [8] in R [9], a well-known framework for building ML models. The caret package provides functions to support model training for complex classification and regression tasks. During a 17-month period from October 2020 until February 2022, all the patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia that were admitted to the ICU were included in the study. The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and the secondary outcome was the identification of predictive variables for mortality.\nWe investigated patient demographic data, blood biomarkers routinely measured in Covid-19 patients admitted to the ICU, bloodstream infection occurrence, and ICU outcome. Analytically, the data set includes the following variables: age, gender, Procalcitonin (PCT), Creatine Kinase (CPK), Troponin, Creatinine (CREA), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), serum levels of Urea (UREA), Ferritin (Ferr), serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (SGPT), total bilirubin (TBIL), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D-Dimer, International Normalized Ratio (INR), hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cells count (WBC), lymphocyte count (LYM%), neutrophil count (NEUT%), platelets (PLT), the presence of bloodstream infection (microbial or/and fungal, none) and the binomial ICU outcome (survival or death)."

The descriptive statistics for Age, Gender, and Outcome are summarized in Table 1. The best performance considering the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was observed with Random Forest (0.82), followed by XGB (0.80), while k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) were the lowest performing machine learning algorithm (0.59).

In this study, we evaluated eight classifiers to predict ICU mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. A random forest model outperformed other models in terms of AUC ROC among the various classification methods that were tested using a 10-fold CV. Renal function worsening and older age seem to be among the strongest predictors of unfavorable outcomes in compliance with similar studies [2,4,5,7,12]. Recent literature suggests that predictive modeling can be enhanced by using ML approaches, since they enable the detection of complex relationships between the outcomes of interest and the covariates, especially when trained in the individual data of a hospital, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods [2,3,6,13]. It is difficult to compare the performance of different predictive models, because each one was developed on patients with different characteristics, with different sets of attributes, and with different model development techniques [7].\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, it is a single-center study with data\ncollected from a single ICU, restricting the generalizability and external validity of the\nresults. Second, the dataset is limited to demographic characteristics and routine laboratory results retrieved from the hospital information system (HIS) and does not contain clinical patient data, which would undoubtedly add significant accuracy to the predictive ability of the machine learning models. Third, a serious drawback of the proposed ML model (RF), is its limited sensitivity (max 0.5), which is apparently due to the lack of clinical data from the dataset. We anticipate that our future studies besides laboratory and demographic data will additionally include clinical data from patients over longer time periods."
