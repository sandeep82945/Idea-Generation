1. **Investigate the relationship between childhood trauma and grazing behavior.** This study found no significant correlation between grazing and childhood trauma, but it is possible that grazing is a form of maladaptive eating that is less compulsive than binge eating and FA and, therefore, not specific to people with a trauma history. Future research could explore this possibility by examining the frequency of compulsive grazing in people with and without a history of childhood trauma.


2. **Examine the role of peer victimization in the development of FA.** This study found that peer victimization was significantly correlated with FA, even after controlling for other types of childhood trauma. Future research could investigate the mechanisms by which peer victimization leads to FA, such as by examining the role of negative body image and self-esteem.


3. **Explore the relationship between FA and other mental health conditions.** This study found that FA was significantly correlated with depressive symptoms, but it is possible that FA is also associated with other mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder. Future research could investigate these possibilities by examining the prevalence of FA in people with different mental health conditions.


4. **Investigate the effectiveness of treatments for FA.** There is currently no established treatment for FA, but some treatments that have been used for binge eating disorder or obesity may be helpful. Future research could investigate the effectiveness of these treatments for FA, as well as explore new treatments that are specifically tailored to the needs of people with FA.


5. **Examine the long-term consequences of FA.** This study found that FA was associated with greater psychopathological severity, but it is possible that FA also has other long-term consequences, such as an increased risk of chronic diseases or impaired social functioning. Future research could investigate these possibilities by following people with FA over time to examine their health and well-being.
