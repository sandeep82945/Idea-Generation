The associations between electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and the severity of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, have not been clearly elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the associations between depression and anxiety symptoms with ECG indices, and to predict the severity of depression and anxiety using ECG indicators.\nMethods: 61 outpatients with first-episode depression from the Shanghai Pudong New Area Mental Health Center were selected and met the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV. All participants provided self-reported scores on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and underwent the standard 12-lead ECG assessment.\nResults: Among the 61 included outpatients (mean [standard deviation, SD] age: 37.84 [13.82] years; 41[67.2%] were female), there were 2 (3.3%) outpatients without depression symptoms, 16 (26.2%) with mild depression, 19 (31.1%) with moderate depression, and 24 (39.3%) with severe depression. Ten (16.4%) outpatients did not have anxiety symptoms, 19 (31.1%) exhibited mild anxiety, 20 (32.8%) exhibited moderate anxiety, and 12 (19.7%) exhibited severe anxiety. Only 1 (1.6%) outpatient exhibited neither depression nor anxiety, 9 (14.8%) and 1 (1.6%) outpatients only exhibited depression and anxiety, respectively, and most outpatients (50 [82.0%]) had comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. In the correlation analysis, depression and anxiety severity levels were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.717, p < 0.01). Moreover, categorical anxiety significantly di ers in QT interval (p = 0.022), and continuous SAS scores were significantly correlated with QT interval (r = 0.263, p = 0.04). In addition, the correlations between ECG measurements and both categorical depression and continuous SDS scores were not statistically significant. The comorbidity of anxiety and depression was significantly correlated with heart rate (p = 0.039) and QT interval (p = 0.002). Disorder status significantly di ered with di erent QT intervals (p = 0.021).\nFrontiers inCardiovascularMedicine 01 frontiersin.org\nIn the prediction analysis, QT interval was the only significant predictor (p = 0.01, b = 0.058, Odds Ratio = 1.059) for comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms.\nConclusion: This study found that comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly associated with QT interval and heart rate. Additionally, QT interval could predict the comorbidity of these two psychiatric disorders. Further prospective research in a larger and high-risk population is needed.\nKEYWORDS\ndepression disorders, anxiety disorders, psychiatric symptoms, ECG abnormalities, cardiovascular disorders"

            "text": "Psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, are common in patients with coronary artery diseases, which are a major cause of death around the world (1). Previous research found that depression and heart disease are very common and often coexist (2). Similarly, anxiety is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, especially heart failure (3\u20135). One explanation for the widely observed associations between cardiovascular diseases and depression and anxiety is that depression and anxiety lead to altered inflammation status and sympathetic nervous system activity that may adversely affect the cardiovascular system (2, 6).\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive measure of cardiovascular functions that can reflect the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Researchers have found significant correlations between ECG indices and psychological disorders (7). For example, prolongation of QT interval has been related to depression symptoms in female patients with acute coronary syndrome (8). In addition, anxious participants were found to have a significantly lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) compared with healthy controls (9). Since there has been strong comorbidity between anxiety and depression (10\u2013 12), both of them were found to be related to decreased heart rate variability (HRV) (13\u201315). However, the impact of depression and anxiety symptoms on ECG measurements may depend on the type of anxiety (e.g., general anxiety or heart-focused anxiety) and the stage of depression (e.g., onset, maintenance or recurrent) (16). Additionally, researchers developed a model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) (a deep learning-based model) and long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder to predict the risk of depression based on ECG measurements (17). This model could differentiate between \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201crisky\u201d heartbeats, which correspond to different severity levels of depression. Although many studies have evaluated the associations of psychiatric\ndisorders with ECG measurements, they only focused on a few ECG indices.\nGiven that mental impairments can influence physiological functions, we assume that physiological presentations may in turn reflect mental health conditions. Moreover, compared with other depression and anxiety severity physiological evaluation methods (e.g., EEG, EMG, saliva tests, and Dermal electricity), the use of ECG is much more convenient and accessible, and a link between ECG to anxiety and depression symptoms could help us form a straightforward understanding of the psychosomatic disease. To our knowledge, how ECG measurements predict psychiatric disorders has been less studied previously. Therefore, we tried to fill this knowledge gap by predicting the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms based on main ECG indices.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we conducted correlation analyses of psychological and physiological data to investigate the association of depression and anxiety symptoms with ECG indices (namely heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, corrected QT interval [QTC], and QRS complex). Then we performed prediction analyses to evaluate whether the extracted ECG indices can predict symptom severity of depression and anxiety."

ECGs were recorded using a standard 12-lead tracing at rest in the supine position with a speed of 25 mm/s, an amplitude of 10 mm/mV, and a sampling frequency of at least 500Hz. We collected the PR interval (ms), QRS interval (ms), and QT interval (ms) as ECG data. The PR interval was the time from the onset of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex. This is an indication of atrioventricular node conduction. The QT interval was the time from the start point of theQRS complex, expressed as ventricular depolarization, to the return point (visualized) of the T wave. It results from ventricular repolarization. The corrected QT (QTc) interval was obtained by the tangent method and corrected for heart rate using Bazett\u2019s formula: QTc = QT/ \u221a RR (20). This formula has been commonly used and well established in previous research (21\u201323). Automated analysis was performed through a digitized multi-channel computer-assisted program (GE 12SL ECG Analysis), which uses validated algorithms for ECG parameters measurement. ECG analysis is described elsewhere (24)."

Correlations between depression status and all five ECG indices were not significant. After adjusting for age, sex, and\neducation level, the correlations remained insignificant (Table 3).\nAssociations between anxiety and ECG measurements\nAnxiety severity significantly differs in QT interval (p = 0.022), but not with other ECG indices (Table 2, Figure 3). Similarly, continuous SAS scores were significantly correlated with QT interval (r = 0.263, p = 0.04), but not with other ECG indices (Figure 1). Adjusting for age, sex, and education\nFrontiers inCardiovascularMedicine 08 frontiersin.org\nlevel, attenuated the significance of this correlation (adjusted p = 0.041) (Table 4).\nAssociations between comorbid depression and anxiety and ECG measurements\nDepression and anxiety levels were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.717, p < 0.01). When examining SDS and SAS scores simultaneously as continuous variables usingmultivariate regression analyses, it was found that SDS score was most strongly correlated with heart rate (\u03b2 = \u22120.215, p = 0.249), while SAS score was most strongly correlated with QT interval (\u03b2 = 0.275, p = 0.136). In addition, the comorbidity of anxiety and depression was significantly correlated with heart rate (p = 0.039) and QT interval (p = 0.002). Furthermore, disorder status only significantly differed with different QT intervals (p = 0.021).\nPrediction of symptom status using ECG measurements\nWe tried to predict symptom status using the five ECG indices. Four symptom statuses were defined in this study: (1) depression severity: 1-normal, 2-mild, 3-moderate, 4-severe; (2) anxiety severity: 1-normal, 2-mild, 3-moderate, 4-severe; (3) comorbid severity: 1-no symptom/low severity of both anxiety and depression, 2-depression only, 3-anxiety only, 4- comorbid anxiety and depression; (4) status of comorbidity: 1-none comorbid, 2-comorbid depression and anxiety.\nTo predict the depression severity, anxiety severity and comorbid severity, we conducted logistic regression analyses. However, we could not predict these three symptom statuses based on the available ECG measurements.\nTo predict the status of comorbidity, we used logistic regression analyses (binary logistic regression; forward logistic regression). Results suggested that QT interval was the only significant predictor for the status of comorbidity (p = 0.01, \u03b2 = 0.058, odds ratio [OR]= 1.059)."

These findings are consistent with those of Lapidus et al. (28), who discovered that a high level of anxiety was associated with increased QT dispersion, which may predispose to cardiac arrhythmias (28). Surprisingly, the current study did not detect any evidence of a significant correlation between depression and ECG indices. However, because of the small sample size of our study, caution must be taken in interpreting our observations. Prior research also yielded heterogeneous findings (significant or non-significant) on the relationship between depression symptoms and ECG measurements (29, 30).\nThe simultaneous analyses of continuous SDS and SAS scores revealed significant associations of depression with heart rate, and anxiety and QT interval. Therefore, it seems reasonable to determine whether the comorbidity of anxiety and depression is significantly correlated with heart rate and QT interval. Additionally, disease status only differed significantly with different QT intervals. Noteworthy, we could not detect a statistically significant relationship between depression and ECG indices until taking anxiety into account. This agrees with prior research showing that anxiety, but not depression, negatively influenced parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, suggesting that anxiety may be more related to adverse cardiological outcomes (15). However, some research also suggests that the association between anxiety and heart disease may be responsible for the comorbidity of depression (31). This inconsistency in causality may be due to the specific ECG indices selected, as prior research also found that benign palpitation was significantly associated with anxiety, but not depression (32). Another factor to consider is the stage of disease, as aforementioned in the introduction. For example, one study has suggested that anxiety may play different roles in different stages of depression in individuals with inherited cardiac disorders (33).\nAnother important finding of our study is that QT interval was the only ECG index that can be used to predict the comorbidity of depression and anxiety. Likewise, the reliability of using ECG features obtained from wearable devices for diagnosing anxiety has been validated (34), and a dose-response relationship has been found between the severity of depression and the risk of coronary heart disease (35). In addition, a prior study used heart rate variability to effectively discriminate between depression and anxiety patients (10). Another study also predicted depressed patients with suicidal ideation based on ECG recordings (36). In summary, it is possible to predict the severity of depression and anxiety using ECG indices."

            "heading": "Limitations and future work",
            "text": "The present study has many limitations to acknowledge. First, despite the robust risk adjustment during statistical calculation, confounding effects as a result of unmeasured variables, such as baseline health status, lifestyle (e.g., diet\nhabits, exercise habits), and current medication status, cannot be excluded. Future studies will be needed to further investigate these variables. In addition, it will be important for future studies to investigate how the other remaining ECG indices correlate with depression and anxiety symptoms. Second, there was a potential selection bias considering the small sample size of our study. Therefore, findings obtained based on this small sample may not be generalizable to other settings. However, as we aimed to investigate the association between ECG indices and earlier depression and anxiety symptoms in outpatients with first-episode depression, the sample used in this study was relatively representative. In the future, it is important to verify our results in longitudinal analyses with repeated measures in a large, high-risk population. Third, we only used SDS and SAS as depression and anxiety assessment tools, respectively. Due to the subjective nature of these two scales, recall bias may exist, and the evidence may be insufficient for establishing diagnoses. We believe that the correlation and prediction power would have been more statistically significant if more strict diagnoses were established. Fourth, although associations between ECG indices and depression and anxiety have been identified in this study, the causal mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Additionally, prospective studies are needed to clarify the pharmacological roles of depression and anxiety in the management of heart disease."
