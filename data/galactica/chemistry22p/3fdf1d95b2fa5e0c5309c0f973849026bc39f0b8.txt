Transition metals as catalysts for total VOC oxidation at low temperatures (150–280 ◦C) are a big challenge nowadays. Therefore, iron-modified SBA-15, AlSBA-15, and ZrSBA-15 materials with 0.5 to 5.0 wt.% Fe loading were prepared and tested for toluene oxidation. It was found that increasing Fe loading significantly improved the rate of oxidation and lowered the temperature of achieving 100% removal of toluene from above 500 ◦C for the supports (AlSBA-15 and ZrSBA-15) to below 400 ◦C for 5FeZrSBA-15. The formation of finely dispersed iron oxide active sites with a particle size less than 5 nm was observed on all the SBA-15, AlSBA-15, and ZrSBA-15 supports. It was found that the surface properties of the mesoporous support due to the addition of Al or Zr predetermined the type of formed iron oxide species and their localization on the support surface. Fe-containing SBA-15 and AlSBA-15 showed activity in total toluene oxidation at higher temperatures (280–450 ◦C). However, 5 wt. % Fe-containing ZrSBA-15 showed excellent activity in the total oxidation of toluene as a model VOC at lower temperatures (150–380 ◦C) due to the synergistic effect of Fe-Zr and the presence of accessible and stable Fe2+/Fe3+ active sites. 1. conclusions Iron-modified SBA-15, AlSBA-15, and ZrSBA-15 materials were successfully prepared. The formation of finely dispersed iron oxide species can be assumed based on the XRD, XPS, and TPR data. It was found that the surface properties of the mesoporous support due to the presence of Al or Zr determined the state of the formed iron oxide species, their dispersion, and reducibility. The obtained Fe-containing SBA-15 and AlSBA-15 samples showed high catalytic activity in toluene oxidation at higher temperatures (280–450 ◦C). However, the 5 wt. % Fe-containing ZrSBA-15 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity at lower temperatures (150–380 ◦C) most probably due to the synergistic effect of Fe-Zr
leading to the presence of accessible and stable Fe2+/Fe3+ redox active sites.
