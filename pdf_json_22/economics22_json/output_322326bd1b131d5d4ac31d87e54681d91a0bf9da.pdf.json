The study followed the STROBE reporting guideline.\nWe studied 4 abiraterone products, including 250- and 500-mg generic and brand-name tablets, for a common total dosage of 1000 mg/d. We used the FDA Orange Book to identify market entry of generic products approved through May 2022. We used Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Formulary and Pricing Information Files (2018-2022) to identify product coverage and expected annual out-of-pocket costs.3,4 We calculated point-of-sale prices (excluding rebates and discounts) and out-of-pocket costs assuming monthly fills, standard plan benefit design, and no other medication use. We also calculated a best-case scenario of 2022 out-of-pocket costs (lowest-cost Part D plan/pharmacy combination in Minneapolis, Minnesota) using the Medicare Part D Plan Finder,5 assuming the patient was diagnosed in January 2022. We analyzed data using Excel version 16.61 (Microsoft)."

Between 2018 and 2022, 12 generic 250-mg and 4 generic 500-mg abiraterone formulations came to market, with the first available in October 2018 and December 2020, respectively.\nExpected annual out-of-pocket costs ranged from $7491 to $10 148 across products and years (Figure 2). In 2022, out-of-pocket costs for 500-mg generic and brand-name abiraterone were $10 148 and $9298, respectively. The same was true when the Part D Plan Finder was used (Figure 2). However, out-of-pocket costs were much higher for 250-mg brand-name vs generic abiraterone (>$150 000 vs $1139)."

A patient able to price shop could pay approximately $1100 for a 1-year supply of 250-mg generic abiraterone\u2014one-seventh of the mean annual out-of-pocket costs.\nThis study has several key findings. First, although plans rapidly covered generic products, reductions in out-of-pocket costs were delayed. The 250-mg generic product (available since 2018, with 12 manufacturers) is now less costly than its brand-name counterpart, but the 500-mg product is not. It took more than 3 years for costs to decrease, mirroring data reporting that it takes multiple years and/or entrants for robust price competition.1,4 Second, out-of-pocket costs for Part D beneficiaries can be higher with generic products despite lower list prices (vs brand-name products) because of a program design flaw.2,4 Finally, we observed a broad range of out-of-pocket costs for the same drug and/or dose. Emphasizing this point, a patient without insurance can obtain an annual supply of abiraterone for $2202 from an online pharmacy platform\u2014lower than through their health plan.6\nA limitation of this study is that Medicare formulary files capture drug prices from the prior 3 months and may not reflect current prices. Regardless, Medicare Part D beneficiaries do not immediately benefit from price reductions associated with generic entry for specialty drugs. Proposals to correct the flaw that makes high-cost generic drugs more expensive to patients than brand-name drugs include eliminating manufacturer discounts from out-of-pocket spending calculations for brand-name drugs or extending the discount to generics.
