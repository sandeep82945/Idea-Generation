            "text": "Page 2/19\nIntroduction Mycotoxins are naturally occuring toxic compounds mainly produced by lamentous fungal species of Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium. These mycotoxin compounds are carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppresive and hepatotoxic effect (Shanakhat et al., 2017). Mycotoxins posses a serious threat in agriculture global industry as it costs billion dollar lost each year even the worst case scenario which can seriously threaten the human health. Moreover, although there are thousand of them exist, but only a few are a considerable food safety concern. Of the various classes of them, most prominent mycotoxins are a atoxin B1 (AFB1), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON) and zeralenone (ZEA) that implicated of the feedstock contamination globally (Nielsen et al., 2014). Taken together, this mycotoxin occurence is a persistent menace to nancial wellbeing which can result in an acute disease risk.\nFusaric acid (FA) also known as a picolinic acid derivative produced by many Fusarium species, particularly pathogenic strains of Fusarium oxysporum, the main causal agent for wilt diseases in wide variety of plant crops (Ram\u00edrez-Mosqueda et al., 2015; Gherbawy et al., 2021). This mycotoxin compound negatively induces damaging effect on plant viability and physiology by several mechanism by reduction of availability of metal, leaf plasma membrane inhibition and leakage of cell membrane integrity, increment of ROS content that resulting in pathological wilting (Dong et al., 2014; Jiao et al., 2014). Such systemic toxicity can lead to apoptosis, necrosis and even death. Moreover, FA was also reported to function as a quorum quencher against biocontrol agent, Pseudomonas chlororaphis and reduce the growth of bacteria through antibiosis mechanism (Bacon et al., 2004). Structurally, FA is an aromatic\nPage 3/19\nheteromonocyclic compound that carries an alkyl group at the 5-position of the pyridine ring and contains a carboxylic acid group (Hai et al., 2020). Owing to the butyl side chain, any host cell membranes can be impaired as a result of increased FA lipophilicity. The role of FA has undoubtedly been shown to contribute to the pathogenicity and virulence of Fusarium species in both plants and living host.\nIn the last few decades, several strategies have been reported to control mycotoxin contamination or eliminate the phytotoxin effect in feedstuffs including physical, chemical and biological detoxi cation approches (Zhu et al., 2017). Due to doubtly question regarding safety and cost implication held by physical and chemical methods, mycotoxin detoxi cation through biological approach has been extensively a preferable choice as it offers higher e ciency and more environmentally sustainable (Wang et al., 2017). Screening for FA-degrading bacteria by enrichment strategies is gaining an increasing attention. To date, microbial species of Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, Trichoderma, Burkholderia and Paenibacillus have been reported to degrade FA effectively (Hu et al., 2012; Raza et al., 2015; Quecine et al., 2016; Crutcher et la., 2017a; Tian et al., 2020). Along that way, several metabolites including fusarinol, hydroxyfusaric acid (8-HOFA), fusarinolic acid and 4-butyl-2-carboxy-pyrimidine have been identi ed as result of biochemical transformation into less toxic by-product compounds (Fakhouri et al., 2003; Stipanovic et al., 2011; Crutcher et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016). Although many FA-degrading microorganisms have been documented, there are a scarcity information in association of phytotoxicity assessment with respect to degradation products. To best to our knowledge, other diversity of bacterial species and their degradation products remain to be underexplored. Therefore, in this study, a novel FAdegrading strain, was isolated capable of degrading large amount of FA with the view of utilizing them as bioremediation agent in correspondence to promote green solution for mycotoxin control. Futhermore, any possibilities of byproducts produced in the FA degradation process was assessed. The toxicity effect of FA degradation products was examined for their phytotoxicity properties.\nMaterials And Methods\nEnrichment and isolation of FA-degrading bacteria The soil samples were collected, following the harvest of maize crops grown under organic management at research farm located on the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) (2\u00b015.6406\u2019N, 102\u00b0 73.2332\u2019E; Pagoh, Malaysia). Five-gram samples were added to 45 mL of BS (Basal Salt) mediuum supplemented with 50 mg L\u2212 1 of fusaric acid (FA) as a sole carbon source and agitated at 150 rpm at 30\u00b0C. FA standard was purchased from Thermo Scienti c (Loughborough, United Kingdom) and dissolved in 18% (v/v) methanol before adjusting the pH to 6.5 with 2 N NaOH to obtain a stock solution of 10,000 mg L\u2212 1. All chemicals used were of analytical grade, unless otherwise indicated. The composition of BS medium was as follows: 12.5 g L\u2212 1 KH2PO4, 3.8 g L\u2212 1 K2HPO4, 1.0 g L\u2212 1 (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 g L\u2212 1 MgSO4.7H2O with 0.5 mL of 10x trace element (TE) solution. The 10x TE solution consisted of 2.32 g L\u2212 1 H3BO3, 1.74 g L\u2212 1 ZnSO4.7H2O, 1.16 g L\u2212 1 FeSO4(NH4)2.SO4.6H2O, 0.96 g L\u2212 1 CoSO4.7H2O, 0.22 g L\u2212 1 (NH4)6MO7O24.4H2O, 0.08 g L\u2212 1 CuSO4.5H2O, 0.08 g L\u2212 1 MnSO4.4H2O. After 7 days, 10% of of the culture\nPage 4/19\nwere transferred to 45 mL fresh BS medium (supplemented with 50 mg L\u2212 1 of FA) and incubated for a further 7 days. Enrichment was performed for a third time according to the same procedures. After several enrichments, the diluted cultures were spread on a BS agar plate supplied with fusaric acid as a sole carbon and energy source at 30\u00b0C for 5 days. The resultant colonies with different colony morphology were repeatedly streaked on BS agar until purity was achieved. Each isolate was further streaked separately onto 1/10 TS agar plates for puri cation. The isolates were screened for their ability to utilize FA as a sole carbon source on the BS medium supplemented with 50 mg L\u2212 1 of FA.\nIdenti cation By Pcr Ampli cation And Dna Sequencing Gram staining kit (HiMedia Laboratories, India) was used in accordance the manufacturer\u2019s protocol in addition to 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The genomic DNA of isolated strain were extracted using PrimeWay Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Apical Scienti c, Malaysia) in accordance the manufacturer\u2019s protocol after 24h of cultivation in 1/10 TSB medium. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 min. Extracted DNA was evaluated with 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis to determine qualities and quantitites. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from each isolated strains was ampli d by PCR using universal primers 27F, 5\u2019- AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG \u2013 3\u2019 and 1492R, 5\u2019 \u2013 TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT \u2013 3\u2019. Amplication was performed in 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture using TC1000G PCR thermal cycler (DLAB, China). A PCR puri cation kit (NucleoSpin gDNA Clean-Up, MachereyNagel, France) was used to purify the PCR product, which was subjected to DNA sequencing using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Reference sequences retrieved from the GenBank database following BLAST searches were aligned with the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by using Neigbour-Joining methods in MEGA7.0 with the Kimura 2- parameter model. (Kumar et al., 2016). Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was performed to assess the support of the clusters.\nGrowth Rate And Fa Degradation Activity Of Imcc1007 Brie y, precultures of strain IMCC1007 were prepared by culturing cells in 250 mL asks containing 50 mL TSB medium, agitated at 150 rpm 30\u00b0C for overnight incubation. Then, precultures were inoculated into 50 mL BS medium supplemented with 50 mg L\u2212 1 FA. The initial turbidity at 600 nm (OD600) was set at 0.01 and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10h. The growth of strains was checked using UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Cary 60, Agilent, USA) at an optical density of 600 nm. Bacterial growth was monitored as increasing turbidity until the stationary phase. Samples were taken at regular intervals, from which residual FA was extracted. Control cultures were cultured in the BS medium without FA. The generation time was calculated based on the log10(OD600) of the obtained greatest slope de ned as the maximum growth rate (log10(OD600)h\u2212 1).\nQuanti cation Of Fa Residual Concentration\nPage 5/19\nThe residual concentration of FA were quanti ed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) at 0, 3, 6, 9, 10 and 12 h. Brie y, the culture medium containing 50 mg L\u2212 1 of FA after treated with strain IMCC1007 was ltered through a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe lter (Bio ow, Malaysia) after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. A culture ltrate was measured for FA concentration on a HPLC (LC1290 II, Agilent, USA) using C18 column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m) equipped with a photodiode array detector. The HPLC was run with a mobile phase composed of methanol and water at a ow rate of 0.8 mL min\u2212 1. FA was detected with 268 nm excitation wavelength at a retention time of 8.1 min. FA residual concentration was calculated according to a standard curve constructed against different concentrations using commercial FA standard. Speci cally, FA concentration were calculated with a calibration curve exhibiting an R2 = 0.992:"

Three key factors including incubation time (1, 3, 5, 7, 12 h), pH (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and temperature (20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C) affecting the FA degradation rate were selected. Medium without FA was used as negative control. The degradation tests were carried out with agitation at 150 rpm at 30\u00b0C for 12 h, FA residues were analyzed using HPLC.\nDegradation rate (%) were quanti ed by measuring sample peak areas and comparing against those of standard solutions. The FA degradation rate as follows:\nY = (X1 \u2013 X2) / X2 x 100%\nwhere X1 is the FA concentration in the negative control, X2 is the FA concentration in the treated sample, and Y is the degradation rate (%).\nFa Residues Analysis And Degradation Product Identi cation The FA degradation product residues identi cation after treatment with strain IMCC1007 were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/QTOF) (6560 Ion Mobility, Agilent, USA). Culture of FA degradation products were then ltered, extracted thrice with equal volume of ethyl acetate before drying with a rotary evaporator (OSB-2100, Eyela, Japan) and then dissolved in methanol. An injection volume of 2.0 \u00b5L was used. The column used was Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.8 um) and the mobile phase used was water (A) and methanol (B) with 0.1% formic acid at a ow rate of 0.25 mL min\u2212 1. From 0 to 3 min, 15% B was used; from 3 to 8 min, 85% B and nally from 8 to 15 min, 15% B was used. All electron spray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were acquired in the positive polarity.\nPage 6/19\nMass spectrum was set to be in the range of 100\u2013500 m/z. The masses corresponding to the possible degradation by-products were predicted by comparison with existing library (MassHunter, Agilent, USA).\nPhytoxicity Bioassay Test Of The Detoxi ed Fa Compound In Maize Seedlings In order to determine the toxicity of FA degradation product, extracted culture ltrate was used against maize seedlings to assess the phytotoxicity effect. Maize seeds (Zea mays) were surface-disinfected with 70% ethanol and 6% NaCIO thrice for 3 min, respectively before rinsed with sterile distilled water. Then, the seeds were placed in water agar plates in a dark condition to allow germination. Germinated seeds were grew on modi ed Hoagland agar (0.8 g L\u2212 1 Ca(NO3)2; 0.2 g L\u2212 1 KNO3, 0.2 g L\u2212 1 MgSO4, 0.12 g L\u2212 1 KH2PO4, 0.5 mL 10x TE, 15 g L\u2212 1 agar) until third true leaf appeared (Peterson et al., 2006). Different concentrations of FA (150 mg L\u2212 1 and 50 mg L\u2212 1) and FA degradation product solution were used to incubate germinated seeds for 3 h on leaf plants as for foliar application. Sterilized distilled water was used as a control treatment. Plants were evaluated for necrosis using 0\u20135 disease score and disease severity percentages were calculated. The number of lesions on each leaf were recorded after 1 week. The photosynthetic parameters of leaves including net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and transpiration rate (E) were measured using portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400, Li-Cor Bioscience, USA) under photon ux density of 1, 200 \u00b5 mol photons m\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 after the system reached at steady state equilibrium.\nStatistical Analyses All assays were conducted in triplicate, unless otherwise indicated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan\u2019s multiple-range tests were performed to analyze the differences between experimental mean values. Values are shown as the mean \u00b1 the standard deviation (SD).\nResult\nIsolation and identi cation of FA-degrading strain The soil samples from rhizosphere of maize plant were used for isolation of FA-degrading bacteria by the enrichment method with FA as a sole carbon and energy source at 30\u00b0C. After several enrichment culture, a turbid culture was observed in the BS medium supplemented with fusaric acid as a sole carbon and energy source, indicating the tolerance ability for growth. After puri cation, a pure colony, designated as IMCC1007 was nally obtained. We selected only one dominant strain, which showed rapid growth on FA at 30\u00b0C for further characterization. BLAST analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences (1408bp) of strain IMCC1007 was performed, where signi cant groupings were downloaded. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the strain IMCC1007 belonged to the genus Burkholderia, in the phylogenetic clade of\nPage 7/19\nBurkholderia cepacia (Fig.\u00a01A). The 16S rRNA sequence of IMCC1007 showed 99% similarity with to that of B. cepacia NBRC14074T. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this strain was deposited in the GenBank database with accession number OP522367. Strain IMCC1007 appeared a yellowish creamy and circular colonies on 1/10 TS agar plates (Fig.\u00a01B and C). IMCC1007 is an aerobic and gram-negative bacterium (Fig.\u00a01D). According to phylogenetic, physiological and biochemical test, this strain was known as Burkhoderia sp. IMCC1007.\nGrowth features of Burkholderia sp. IMCC1007 with FA\nThe growth rates and FA degradation of strain IMCC1007 were investigated at their optimum growth temperature (30\u00b0C) with initial 50 mg L\u2212 1. FA concentration. Strain IMCC1007 showed a short lag phase on early 3 h of incubation, reaching an OD600 0.06. After 10 h of incubation, the OD600 of the cultures reached a maximum growth rate (\u00b5) of 0.18 h\u2212 1 with an OD600 of approximately 0.19. After 12 h, strain IMCC1007 reached the stationary phase of growth (Fig.\u00a02A). The growth of IMCC1007 in the presence of FA was clearly observed. A correspondence of decrease in the FA concentration was observed on ltrate supernatant in the culture on HPLC analysis. After 12 h of incubation, 93% from the initial FA concentration has been degraded to the residual of about 4.87 mg L\u2212 1 (Fig.\u00a02B). No remaining FA concentration was detected after 14 h of incubation. Associated with this decrease, chromatograms revealed that the signi cant reduction of FA concentration by strain IMCC1007 over the 14 h culture as comparison with the initial hour of incubation (Fig.\u00a03A). Based on HPLC analysis, none of FA peak was observed at retention time of 8.1 under 268 nm (Fig.\u00a03B), indicating the FA was completely metabolized by strain IMCC1007.\nFa Degradation Rates In Correspondence To Incubation Time, Ph And Temperature Conditions The effect of incubation time, pH and temperature on degradation rates of IMCC1007 were investigated using 50 mg L\u2212 1 as the sole carbon source (Fig.\u00a04). For incubation time, FA degradation rates were determined at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 h. At 7 h incubation time, FA degradation rates increased rapidly up to 2- fold from 12.65 \u00b1 1.93% to 42.71 \u00b1 0.53% as compared to 5 h incubation time (Fig.\u00a04A). The highest degradation rate was achieved at 12 h incubation time with 92.43 \u00b1 1.94%. The degradation rates of acidic conditions were higher than alkaline conditions with exception of pH 6 that marked the highest degradation rates (92.95 \u00b1 0.52%), indicating FA degradation was more favarouble under slightly acidic to neutral pH condition. This pH-dependent result clearly showed that the soil pH (between 6\u20137) where the origin location of strain IMCC1007 is more likely contributed into this higher degradation rates. Notably, FA degradation activities were gradually dropped under alkaline conditions with 20.22 \u00b1 0.61% and 14.31 \u00b1 1.15% respectively (pH 8\u20139). From the temperature-dependent degradation test, the degradation rates were ~ 22% at 20\u00b0C and ~ 40% at 25\u00b0C respectively. FA degradation was more rapid at 30\u00b0C with 91.51 \u00b1 0.19% but showed a reduction trend at above 35\u00b0C onwards (Fig.\u00a04B).\nPage 8/19\nAnalysis Of Possible Degraded Fa By-products From LC-MS analysis, several possible chemical compounds were tabulated from extracts taken from 12 h of incubation time (Table\u00a01). Fusaric acid and its derivatives were determined as a major compound including 8-hydroxyfusaric acid (C10H13NO3) and 6-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid (C11H8O3). From this result, it was con rmed the FA was degraded by strain IMCC1007 aerobically. Degradation product such as 4- hydroxybenzoic acid (82.34%) appeared at retention time of 2.47 min and showed the m/z ion peak at 138.12 for the protonated adduct [M + H]+ (Fig.\u00a05). This ion peak corresponded to a molecular formula of C7H6O3. Other antimicrobial compounds such as oxicilin (67.78%) and chlorhexidine (79.51%) were also detected in mass spectrometry analysis.\nTable 1 Possible degraded-FA chemical compounds derived from extract detected after 12 h of incubation time.\nCompounds Molecular\nweight Chemical formula\nRetention time (min)\nPeak (%)\n4-Hydroxybenzoic acid 138.12 C7H6O3 2.47 82.34\n8-Hydroxyfusaric acid 196.21 C10H13NO3 11.43 58.16\n6-Hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid 188.17 C11H8O3 6.41 60.51\n5-Hexyltetrahydro-2-oxo3furancarboxylic acid\n214.12 C11H18O4 1.25 84.47\n12-Tridecene-4,6,8,10-tetraynal 180.06 C13H8O 0.78 89.96\nOxacilin 401.11 C19H19N3O5S 2.88 63.98\nChlorhexidine 504.21 C22H30Cl2N10 1.48 67.78\nTri oxystrobin 408.13 C20H19F3N2O4 1.26 79.51\nMetoxadiazone 222.06 C10H10N2O4 1.53 81.56\nCappariloside A 334.16 C16H18N2O6 2.53 97.62\nPhytotoxicity Of Degraded-fa Byproduct The degraded-FA byproduct showed no phytotoxic effects on 3 week-old maize seedlings. Plants with degraded-FA treatments showed tolerance with no phytotoxic effect as indicated by a minimal wilting score (6.3%). Of the compounds assessed, fusaric acid gives the most phytotoxic impact, showing severe wilting and observable necrosis at 150 mg L\u2212 1 (Fig.\u00a06). No toxicity or necrosis symptoms was observed in control treatment. The leaf photosynthetic rate of plants with high FA addition was 41% lower than control and degraded treatments respectively (Table\u00a02). In addition, at the highest concentration of FA\nPage 9/19\nbeing added, plants showed a reduced trends in all photosynthesis parameters as compared to other treatments.\nTable 2 Growth, necrosis and photosynthesis parameters of maize seedling plants.

However, very a few records with regards to bacteria capable of FA-degrading were disclosed so far (Toyoda et al., 1991; Utsumi et al., 1991; Hu et al., 2012; Simonetti et al., 2018). Those isolates were Klebsiella oxytoca strain HY-1, Pseudomonas cepacia strain UK1, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain K27a and Burkholderia ambifaria strain T16 respectively. In this study, Burkholderia sp. strain IMCC1007 was successfully isolated from the maize rhizosphere soil after serial transfer in minimal-enriched media with FA as a sole carbon source. This enrichment procedure recruited the growth of speci c group of native bacteria within mixed population by introducing a targeted sole carbon source in the laboratory-adapted condition (Spini et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of IMCC1007 revealed that this strain showed closest homology with members of the genus Burkholderia cepacia. Having said that Burkholderia cepacia possessed versatile metabolic capabilities and occupied wide range of ecological niches, various biotechnological applications including bioremediation of recalcitrant xenobiotics, biological control and plant growth promotion have gained their bene cial effects (Jung et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2020). To best of our\nPage 10/19\nknowledge, our isolated strain was different from reported literatures, thus enriching the diversity of FAdegrading bacteria.\nSeveral studies have indicated that some other degradation strains were screened using high mycotoxin level at the initial of evaluation rather than low concentrations (Kuang et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2018). Our study showed that the ability of IMCC1007 to degrade FA completely within 14 h at 50 mg L\u2212 1, exceeded our expectation. As for current challenge in mycotoxin detoxi cation research, mycotoxin should be completely degraded even at the highest concentration. Given the prevalence of mycotoxin detoxi cation agent development for early prevention, degradation ability on high concentration should be considered at rst. In the current study, the complete degradation of FA was presumably contributed through degradative enzymes or other bioactive compounds constitutively expressed by IMCC1007, making a good option for mycotoxin biotransformation rather than cell adsoption mechanism.\nThe success of on-site detoxi cation employing native microbial species could be voided by imbalanced nutrient and adverse conditions which are common in natural environment. Next, we explored the optimal degradation rate for different environmental conditions. Previous studies of bacterial growth concomitant with decreasing susbtrate showed that Stenotrophomonas sp. strain CW117 could degrade 47 mg L\u2212 1 of a atoxin (AFB1) and 51 mg L\u2212 1 of ochratoxin (OTA) within 24 h at 90\u00b0C, providing degradation rations of 91.2% and 91.8% respectively (Cai et al., 2020). Approximately up to 80% of FA (initial concentration, 2.5 mM) was degraded by Burkholderia ambifaria T16 after 20 h at 30\u00b0C (growth rate was recorded as 0.243 h\u2212 1) (Alvarez et al., 2022). Xu et al. (2017) reported that Bacillus shackletonii strain L7 exhibited the highest degradation rate at pH 8 and 70\u00b0C respectively at 72 h. In comparison with the published result data, the highest degradation rate of Burkholderia sp. strain IMCC1007 was greater than 90%, appeared at temperature 30\u00b0C and pH 6 respectively.\nDifferent results existed regarding to degradation products after FA biotransformation (Thanh et al., 2020; Crutcher et al., 2017b). The present result differed from previous research as fusarinol was not detected. The logical behind this may be due to difference of composition media used for incubation period. In this present study, conversion of FA into 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (C7H6O3) probably through chemical biotransformation. 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, also known as p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) was a phenolic derivative of benzoic acid. There were strong evidences that Burkholderia sp. possessed a ubiquitious benzoic acid degradation gene cluster in their genomic regions (Morya et al., 2020; Morya et al., 2019). Taking into account the degradation product detected and the observable growth under FA as a carbon source, we hypothesized that strain IMCC1007 hydrolyzed FA using this degradative pathway.\nMycotoxin residual fate after detoxi cation has become an issue in which the release of toxin intermediates that could be harmful to environment. FA was a causative agent for Fusarium wilt and damage effects of FA on plants was widely reported (L\u00f3pez-D\u00edaz et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014). 4- hydroxybenzoic acid also known as p-hydroxybenzoic acid has been reported to be less toxic (Gerig and Blum, 1991). This compound has the hydroxyl group (OH\u2212) in the position para to the carboxyl side chain and with no butyl side chain (Shalaby et al., 2012). To con rm the phytotoxicity of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid,\nPage 11/19\na bioassay on maize seedlings was performed. The signi cant decrease in phytotoxicity and photosynthetic parameters as FA-degraded byproduct (4-hydroxybenzoic acid) was sprayed on the maize seedlings. The result was in agreement with the result by Wang et al. (2020) as they reported that cucumber grown with FA gave a highly disease severity occurence. Reduced phytoxicity effect owned by 4-hydroxybenzoic acid has been observed on cucumber seedlings growth, which led to less changes in the rhizosphere microbial composition (Jin et al., 2020). The reduced phytoxicity of this compound indicates the importance of butyl side chain in FA toxicity. These results further support the potential for applying IMCC1007 for mycotoxin degradation in agrifood industry, hence reducing the utilization of chemical fungicides. This study showed zero risk towards human health as no potent harmful of FA degradative products were detected.\nConclusion Based on our result, soil-derived bacteria Burkholderia sp. IMCC1007 was successfully isolated by enrichment protocol, in which exhibited FA-degrading ability. Strain IMCC1007 showed faster growth rate by utilizing FA as a sole carbon and energy source despite being recalcitrant. It would be intriguing to characterize further the genes involved FA degradation with an attention to verify the metabolic pathways taken by IMCC1007 for energy production. The possible byproducts during FA degradation, 4- hydroxybenzoic, considerably less toxic than FA provides a novel insight into exploration of new metabolite in the development of mycotoxin detoxi cation strategies. Apart from acting as a detoxi cation agent, IMCC1007 can be a promising candidate for biofungicide against mycotoxinproducing fungi in wider applicable scale, aimed at cutting the dependency of chemical fungicide and minimizing loss in the agricultural productivity. With the above notions in consideration, the use of IMCC1007 would be economically and environmentally practical option in the mycotoxin suppression. Further studies on molecular levels is needed to ascertain the exact resistance mechanisms towards phytotoxic particularly FA.\nDeclarations Acknowledgements\nThis work was nancially supported by Quick Win UTMSPACE Research Grant (R.J130000.7709.4J556) and UTM Fundamental Research Grant (Q.J130000.3809.22H12).
