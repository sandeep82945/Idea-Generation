    "abstractText": "Hyperuricemia is linked to a variety of disorders that can have serious consequences for human health. Peptides that inhibit xanthine oxidase (XO) are expected to be a safe and effective functional ingredient for the treatment or relief of hyperuricemia. The goal of this study was to discover whether papain small yellow croaker hydrolysates (SYCHs) have potent xanthine oxidase inhibitory (XOI) activity. The results showed that compared to the XOI activity of SYCHs (IC50 = 33.40 \u00b1 0.26 mg/mL), peptides with a molecular weight (MW) of less than 3 kDa (UF-3) after ultrafiltration (UF) had stronger XOI activity, which was reduced to IC50 = 25.87 \u00b1 0.16 mg/mL (p < 0.05). Two peptides were identified from UF-3 using nano-high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013 tandem mass spectrometry. These two peptides were chemically synthesized and tested for XOI activity in vitro. Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Glu-Lys-Ile-Trp (WDDMEKIW) (p < 0.05) had the stronger XOI activity (IC50 = 3.16 \u00b1 0.03 mM). The XOI activity IC50 of the other peptide, Ala-Pro-Pro-Glu-Arg-LysTyr-Ser-Val-Trp (APPERKYSVW), was 5.86 \u00b1 0.02 mM. According to amino acid sequence results, the peptides contained at least 50% hydrophobic amino acids, which might be responsible for reducing xanthine oxidase (XO) catalytic activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of the peptides (WDDMEKIW and APPERKYSVW) against XO may depend on their binding to the XO active site. According to molecular docking, certain peptides made from small yellow croaker proteins were able to bind to the XO active site through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The results of this work illuminate SYCHs as a promising functional candidate for the prevention of hyperuricemia.",

            "text": "Uric acid has been identified as a recognized or prospective biomarker for various pathological conditions. Lifestyle factors such as high fructose intake, alcohol addiction, and a high-purine diet can all contribute to high levels of uric acid [1]. Hyperuricemia develops when serum uric acid concentrations surpass solubility limits (6.8 mg/dL at physiological pH). Chronic hyperuricemia may raise the risk of gout, which can lead to gout stones, acute arthritis, and other complications [2,3]. The major pathway of uric acid regulation involves the modulation of purine metabolism via xanthine oxidase (XO, EC 1.17.3.2), which is a molybdenum-containing homodimeric cytoplasmic enzyme with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 300 kDa [4,5]. It predominantly catalyzes the conversion of xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid in the human body. Therefore, substances effectively inhibiting XO can be used to prevent hyperuricemia, as exemplified by drugs such as allopurinol, which can provide short-term relief from the pain caused by gout [6]. However, these synthetic drugs often cause a variety of negative effects; for example, allopurinol is highly susceptible to drug cross-reactivity and may cause rashes [7,8].\nFoods 2023, 12, 982. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12050982 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 982 2 of 14\nAs a consequence, researchers are trying to create new inhibitors from natural sources that are safe, effective, and less expensive, such as food-derived bioactive peptides with a high XO inhibitory (XOI) effect and minimal side effects. XOI peptides are generally derived from protein hydrolysates by separation, purification, and identification, and include dairy products [9], nuts [10], and aquatic products [11,12]. For example, the peptides YF, WPDARG, ACECD, and FPSV were discovered in the hydrolysates of aquatic products and have been shown to alleviate hyperuricemia [11,13,14]. These bioactive peptides generated from dietary protein hydrolysates are typically easily absorbed and are safer than pharmaceuticals [15,16]. Furthermore, quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships and molecular docking approaches, which are widely used in the screening and discovery of natural small molecule active compounds, have contributed to the illumination of new peptides. Thus, it is important to explore physiologically active peptides from aquatic materials. The small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis, SYC), a Sciaenidae fish, is widely distributed as a benthic warm temperate fish in the coastal waters of China [17], favored by consumers because of its high nutritional value, umami taste, and tender texture [18]. However, certain characteristics of SYC limit its current utilization, such as its small size, susceptibility to perishability, and potent fishy smell [19]. Typically, it is processed into items such as fish cake, fish balls, and canned food [20\u201322]. Therefore, to improve the utilization and economic value of SYC, it is critical to develop higher-value-added products. In this work, we combined traditional testing methods with computer simulation techniques to acquire XOI peptides from SYC muscle. First, papain hydrolysates from SYC were graded by ultrafiltration (UF) technology. Next, the group with the greatest XOI effect was identified and the amino acid sequences of two peptides were obtained. The contribution of the synthesized peptides to the XOI activities of SYC was calculated. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis was used to model the interactions between these peptides and the XO active site and, thus, shed light on the XO inhibition mechanisms of SYC peptides. The XOI effects of the XOI peptides from SYC in vitro were elucidated."

SYC is rich in a variety of AAs, with a total amino acid (TAA) content of 824.45 \u00b1 10.50 mg/g, including 327.39 \u00b1 5.41 mg/g of essential amino acids (EAA) for humans, which accounted for 41.09% of the total. The major AAs of SYC protein were Glu (21.08%), Asp (9.41%), Lys (9.07%), and Leu (8.11%). SYC was rich in HAAs (34.22%), AAAs (9.39%), and BAAs (17.38%), indicating that SYC might be a source of uric-acid-lowering peptides. Hydrophobic amino acids (HAAs) (Met, Leu, and Ala), aromatic amino acids (AAAs) (Trp, Phe, and Tyr), and basic amino acids (BAAs) (Lys, His, and Arg) play essential roles in the uric-acid-lowering process of peptides [23,30,31]. A hydrophobic pocket formed by AA residues near the XO active core acts as a critical structural domain that is accessible to peptides with more HAAs [23]. These AAs can bind to XO via hydrophobic interactions, for example, altering its spatial structure and thereby limiting its activity. Furthermore, it has previously been claimed that proteins with charged AAs and AAAs, particularly Glu, constitute a valuable source of active XOI hydrolysis products [30]. Given that XO generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by utilizing molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor, the hyperuricemia-treating medicine allopurinol also has antioxidant activity [32]. Because of the significance of phenolic and indole groups as hydrogen donors, AAAs exhibit significant antioxidant action. Furthermore, AAs with charged residues interact with metal ions and restrict oxidative activity [33]. The physiological action of the peptides benefits from a decrease in ROS, which may be related to the effect that decreases uric acid [30]. These results support the evidence indicating that SYC is a potential source of uric-acid-lowering peptides.\nFoods 2023, 12, 982 6 of 14\nTable 1.

Subsequently, a one-way experiment was conducted on the enzymatic hydrolysis time of papain based on the XOI activity and achieved the best XOI active hydrolysates at 6 h (p < 0.05), as shown in Figure 1B, which may be because the SYC muscle was more sufficiently hydrolyzed, and more short peptides with high XOI activity were formed as the hydrolysis time increased.

Moreover, some research has used papain to create XOI peptides. For example, it was demonstrated that protein hydrolysates derived from bonito hydrolysates prepared with papain exhibited XOI activity [36].\nThe biological activity of peptides in fish hydrolysates primarily depends on their structural properties such as AA content, sequence, and hydrophobicity [37]. Table 2 shows the AA composition of SYCH, which has a total acid hydrolyzable AA content of 782.73 \u00b1 16.20 mg/g, an EAA content of 288.50 \u00b1 8.57 mg/g (36.86%), and an HAA content of 248.92 \u00b1 6.66 (31.81%). Studies confirmed that HAA facilitates the interaction with hydrophobic targets (e.g., cell membranes), thereby enhancing their bioavailability [13]. Additionally, SYCH is high in AAAs and BAAs, which may play a key role in the peptide\u2019s\nFoods 2023, 12, 982 7 of 14\nfunctional capabilities [30,36]. AAAs have benzene rings in their molecules. An AAA at one end of the peptide segment may be more beneficial for binding of the peptide to the enzyme\u2019s active domain since the presence of a benzene ring structure in these peptide segments is thought to have a substantial XO inhibition rate [11]. These findings imply that SYCHs may have bioavailability and anti-hyperuricemia activity, conducive to the next step of obtaining active peptides.\nData are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (n = 3).

MW distributions of SYCHs and UF-3 are depicted in Figure S1, and relative peak table of SYCHs and UF-3 MW distributions in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. He et al. [4] suggested that lowmolecular-weight peptides may be important contributors to the significant XOI activity of XOI peptides. The peptides in SYCHs were fractionated and the obtained fractions were individually tested in terms of their XOI activities. Figure 2B displays the outcomes of the XOI activity of the SYCH and the three fractions after UF. Comparing these four fractions revealed that the UF-3 (IC50 = 25.87 \u00b1 0.16 mg/mL) had the strongest ability to inhibit XO. UF-3 also showed low molecular weight (Figure 2A), which is consistent with the trend of inhibitory activity of XOI. He et al. [4] collected and examined eight fractions with different molecular weight distributions from the lyophilized ethanol-soluble fraction powder of tuna protein hydrolysates and found that the fractions of small peptides (<1 kDa) had remarkable XOI activity compared to the original hydrolysates and other fractions. Other studies found that peptides from skipjack tuna below 3 kDa had a greater inhibitory effect on XO than other fractions [34]. Similar to previous findings, our investigation found that the fraction with 3 kDa inhibited XO more than the SYCH and other fractions, indicating that the fraction with 3 kDa has structural properties recognized by XO and thus functions as a substrate for XO. Therefore, we selected UF-3 for the next identification stage. The AA compositions of SYCH and UF-3 (showing the strongest XOI activity) were evaluated by the acid hydrolysis method to confirm whether there is a potential link between AA composition and uric acid decrease. The makeup of the AA group shifted with the change in MW, Glu, Asp, and Lys were the most prevalent AAs in both SYCH and UF-3, as indicated in Table 2.

WW8 and AW10 were abundant in HAA (50% HAA residues), including Try, Tyr, Pro, and Ile, which is consistent with prior results on XOI peptides. The higher suppression of XO peptides compared to SYCH implies that peptides generated from SYC, notably WW8 and AW10, could be potential XO inhibitors. Thus, the peptides WW8 and AW10, which are non-toxic and non-hemolytic and have adequate good water solubility and XOI activity, were subjected to molecular docking to explain the relationship between peptides and XO.\n3.5.

The peptides WW8 and AW10 interacted with the protein, and WW8 established hydrogen connections with Ile1190, Ala1189, Leu744, and Gln1201, with hydrogen bond lengths of 3.5 \u00c5, 2.7 \u00c5, 2.0 \u00c5, and 2.4 \u00c5, respectively. WW8 also established electrostatic interaction with His579 and hydrophobic interactions with 24 AAs, including Val1200, Gly1197, Glu1196, Phe1219, Ile1235, Ile1229, Phe1232, Pro1230, His741, Ala1231, Tyr743, Phe238, Phe742, Tyr592, Met1038, Gly1039, Gly796, Gly1039, Met794, Gly795, Ala582, Gln585, Gln1194, and Gly1193. These AA residues appeared around the binding of AW10 to XO, including Arg912 and Met1038 with which they formed hydrogen bonds with lengths of 1.9 \u00c5, 2.1 \u00c5, and 3.4 \u00c5, respectively. Moreover, hydrophobic interactions with 22 AAs were distributed around the binding sites of AW10 in XOD, including Ala582, His579, Gln585, Met794, Gly796, Gly795, Leu744, Tyr743, Tyr592, Gly039, Gln194, Gly193, Gln021, Phe798, Ala1198, Glu1196, Ile1235, Phe1239, Gly1197, Val1200, Phe1232, and Ala1231, indicating that the hydrophobic force is another important factor driving the binding of AW10 to XO. It was hypothesized that although all peptides interact with different AA residues of XO, they all bind to XO mainly through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of XO. The lower XOI activity of IC50 for WW8 compared to AW10 could be attributed to a greater number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces between the WW8 and the XO interaction than AW10."

            "text": "Peptides (WDDMEKIW and APPERKYSVW) with XOI activity were identified after enzymatic hydrolysis and UF separation of SYC proteins, and the IC50 values (IC50 = 3.16 \u00b1 0.03 mM and 5.86 \u00b1 0.02 mM, respectively) of XOI activity were calculated in vitro. These findings were validated by molecular docking of the two peptides chosen for the strongest XOI activity, which highlighted the importance of hydrophobic bonds and hydrogen bonds in the establishment of a stable complex conformation and the resulting inhibitory effect of the peptides. We anticipate that these peptides can be employed to manage hyperuricemia as natural XO inhibitors. Bioactive peptides will continue to constitute an important area of study in the future, with an expanding array of uses in food, medicine, and cosmetics. Although peptides derived from SYC proteins exhibit XOI activity, in vivo experiments and clinical trial data are required to confirm these findings and explain unknown mechanisms. Clinical trial data are also necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of active peptides and ensure their bioavailability and safety profile. These are all objectives that must be fulfilled in the future.
