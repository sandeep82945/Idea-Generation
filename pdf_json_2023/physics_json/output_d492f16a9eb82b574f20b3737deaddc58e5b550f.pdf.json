    "abstractText": "Absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is a key factor determining the bioavailability of chemicals after oral exposure but is frequently assumed to have a conservative value of 100% for environmental chemicals, particularly in the context of highthroughput toxicokinetics for in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE). For pharmaceutical compounds, the physiologically based advanced compartmental absorption and transit (ACAT) model has been used extensively to predict gut absorption but has not generally been applied to environmental chemicals. Here we develop a probabilistic environmental compartmental absorption and transit (PECAT) model, adapting the ACAT model to environmental chemicals. We calibrated the model parameters to human in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro datasets of drug permeability and fractional absorption by considering two key factors: (1) differences between permeability in Caco-2 cells and in vivo permeability in the jejunum, and (2) differences in in vivo permeability across different gut segments. Incorporating these factors probabilistically, we found that given Caco-2 permeability measurements, predictions of the PECAT model are consistent with the (limited) available gut absorption data for environmental chemicals. However, the substantial chemical-to-chemical variability observed in the calibration data often led to wide probabilistic confidence bounds in the predicted fraction absorbed and resulting steady state blood concentration. Thus, while the PECAT model provides a statistically rigorous, physiologically based approach for incorporating in vitro data on gut absorption into toxicokinetic modeling and IVIVE, it also highlights the need for more accurate in vitro models and data for measuring gut segment-specific in vivo permeability of environmental chemicals.

The OED is subsequently compared with the exposure forecasts for risk-based prioritization of chemicals for further analysis (Wetmore et al., 2012; Wambaugh et al., 2015; Bell et al., 2018).\nCurrent implementations of RTK-based IVIVE, however, have focused on key parameters of hepatic metabolism, plasma distribution (free versus bound to proteins), and urinary excretion.

In brief, we first collected human in vivo and in vitro permeability data and corresponding fractional absorption measurements (Fabs) on drugs and environmental chemicals from the scientific literature. The different permeability measurements were used to quantify how permeability scales in vitro-to-in vivo and across gut segments. We then adapted the ACAT model to environmental chemicals. The primary difference between drugs and environmental chemicals is that drugs are usually in a formulation that undergoes dissolution and precipitation processes in the GI tract, whereas environmental chemicals are generally presumed to present in dissolved form. Therefore, the compartments and movement related to dissolution and precipitation processes were removed in the PECAT model. Furthermore, our previous version of the ACAT model had a simple, non-physiological structure (i.e., two-compartment model) to describe kinetics in the plasma and other tissues except GI tract and liver (Hsieh et al., 2021), and so did not include renal clearance or metabolism. Thus, the PECAT model includes separate physiologically based liver and kidney compartments, in addition to a lumped compartment for the rest of the body. Next, in vivo permeability and Fabs data from pharmaceuticals were used to calibrate the PECAT model and choose among three different hypothesized scaling approaches using in vitro Caco-2 apparent permeability measurements. Finally, we derived a new equation of Css from our PECAT model for IVIVE. Additional details follow."

The data for gut segment-specific permeability\non oral dose rate (Dose, mg/kg/h), unbound fraction of chemical in blood (fuBlood), glomerular filtration rate (GFR, L/h/kg), liver blood flow (QLiver, L/h/kg), and hepatic intrinsic clearance rate for first-order metabolism (CLint, L/h/kg):\nDose Css =\nGFR \u2219 fuBlood + QLiver \u2219 fuBlood \u2219 CLint\n(1)\nQLiver + fuBlood \u2219 CLint\nThus, most approaches assume that the fraction of the oral intake dose that is absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Fabs) is 100% (Wetmore et al., 2012; Wambaugh et al., 2015; Ring et al., 2017). However, it is known that some environmental chemicals have been found to have a low Fabs, e.g., Fabs for DDT and paraquat are lower than 15% (Chedik et al., 2017). Moreover, Wambaugh et al. (2018) demonstrated that the predictive ability of Css could be improved if bioavailability could be predicted accurately. Therefore, accurately predicting bioavailability of environmental chemicals is an important issue that needs to be resolved for human health risk assessment.\nThe situation for environmental contaminants contrasts with that of drug development, where the topic of predicting oral bioavailability has received a substantial amount of attention. Fabs of a drug is mainly determined by permeability and solubility in the gut lumen (Yim et al., 2020). There are two types of permeability measurements: effective permeability (Peff), which is measured by in vivo studies in humans, and apparent permeability (Papp), which is measured in in vitro cell systems, typically Caco-2 cells. Under the efforts to reduce animal testing, several computational models have been developed and integrated with in vitro studies to examine drug intestinal absorption (Billat et al., 2017; Cho et al., 2014). Two classes of computational models have emerged: one is constructed based on physicochemical descriptors of chemicals, i.e., empirical mathematical models and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR, or quantitative structure-property relationship [QSPR]); the other is based on integrating human physiological features, physicochemical properties of chemicals, and their interaction, i.e., physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling (Cabrera-P\u00e9rez and Pham-The, 2018).\nAn established physiologically based model used to predict drug intestinal absorption is the compartmental absorption and transit (CAT) model, developed by Yu and Amidon (1999). Agoram et al. (2001) expanded on this CAT model to construct the \u201cadvanced\u201d CAT (ACAT) model, with consideration of hepatic first-pass metabolism and adding more compartments to completely describe the dissolution and precipitation processes in the lumen and drug movement in enterocytes. Moreover, incorporation of in vitro permeability in the ACAT model has been extensively and successfully applied to predict the Fabs of drugs (Cho et al., 2014; Gobeau et al., 2016; Parrott and Lav\u00e9, 2002).\nThe main purpose of this study is to improve the current ap-\nAbbreviations: (A)CAT, (advanced) compartmental absorption and transit; CI, confidence interval; CLint , intrinsic clearance rate; Css, steady-state plasma concentration; EPA, Environmental Protection Agency; fuBlood, unbound fraction of chemical in blood; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; GI, gastrointestinal; HTTK, high-throughput toxicokinetics; IVIVC, in vitro to in vivo permeability correction; IVIVE, in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation; OED, oral equivalent dose; Papp, apparent permeability; PECAT, probabilistic environmental compartmental absorption and transit; Peff, effective permeability; QLiver, liver blood flow; RTK, reverse toxicokinetics\nALTEX 40(3), 2023 473\nS21). The in vivo Peff values of pharmaceuticals were mainly extracted from Lennern\u00e4s (1998), Lennern\u00e4s (2007), and Varma et al. (2012). Briefly, the values had been measured by a perfusion technique in the proximal region of the human jejunum lumen. The in vitro Papp data were from Artursson and Karlsson (1991), Bock et al. (2004), Lentz et al. (2000), and Volpe et al. (2007) and were all acquired by a permeability assay using Caco-2 cells. The percentages of absorption were also extracted from the above-mentioned references and compiled in the dataset.\nThe study of O\u2019Hagan and Kell (2015) provided an additional list of Caco-2 Papp for marketed drugs. This data provided sufficient data points to construct the distributions of in vitro to in vivo permeability correction (IVIVC) factors. Based on the list of chemicals with in vivo Peff , we extracted the corresponding Papp from O\u2019Hagan and Kell (2015).\nFor in vitro Papp of environmental chemicals, we collected values from the study conducted by Punt et al.

These Papp were measured in an Ussing chamber with human tissue, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon. The type of permeability data collected from Sj\u00f6gren et al. (2015) is the estimated regional intestinal Peff of drugs. Briefly, the authors used timecourse plasma concentration profiles to estimate the rate of absorption by a deconvolution approach, and further incorporated intestinal surface area and dose remaining in the gut lumen to estimate Peff in duodenum, jejunum, and colon.\nDrug/environmental chemicals in vivo and in vitro permeability and Fabs in human We located data from 80 drugs and environmental chemicals with both permeability and Fabs in humans from the literature (Tab.\n1 doi:10.14573/altex.2210031s\nFig. 1: Schematic of the overall\nstudy approach\nALTEX 40(3), 2023 474\nwith a traditional PBPK model, including the compartments liver, kidney, and the rest of the body.

We adapted this model to construct a PBPK absorption model specifically for environmental chemicals, and its structure is presented in Figure 2.\nFirst, we assumed that environmental chemicals are usually exposed in dissolved form in matrixes; therefore, the dissolution and precipitation processes of chemicals and the compartments of undissolved chemical in gut lumen segments were removed.

This assumption uses a two-step extrapolation approach. The uncertainty distributions for the predictions were derived by using the distributions of segment-specific ratios and IVIVC factors as inputs and MC simulation with 10,000 samples.\nModel evaluation Although the simulation was executed under the assumption of only considering passive transport, the issues of active transport and metabolism still should be discussed. The Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS), based on solubility and extent of metabolism, can be used to classify drugs and provides information on the effect of active transport on the absorptive process in the gut. We applied the classification criteria to both drugs and environmental chemicals (Benet et al., 2011; Bocci et al., 2022; Hosey et al., 2016; Wu and Benet, 2005; Tab. S2-S41). The detailed characteristics of each BDDCS class are compiled in Table 1. The subset of drugs with in vivo Peff and corresponding Fabs was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the PECAT model. Specifically, the Fabs distributions predicted by PECAT were compared with the corresponding observed Fabs.

We also utilized the percentage of the number of chemicals predicted within \u00b1 20% of \u0394Fabs as an index to evaluate predictive accuracy (Paix\u00e3o et al., 2012).

The reason for these two methods is that the in vivo Peff and in vitro Papp are measured in the proximal region of the human jejunum lumen and in Caco-2 cells from human colon tissue, respectively. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test with original and log-transformed values was used to investigate whether the ratios fit a normal or lognormal distribution.

Therefore, in vitro-to-in vivo correction (IVIVC) factors have been proposed as an empirical approach to address this issue. In this study, IVIVC factors were calculated by dividing the in vivo Peff by the in vitro Papp when both measurements were available (Tab. S2, S41). If more than one Peff was available for a given chemical, the average of the Peff values was used to calculate the ratio. As with gut segment ratios, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used with original and log-transformed values to assess whether the ratios fit a normal or lognormal distribution, and MC simulation was used for prospective prediction."

Scenario I incorporated the distributions of the Pi:Pjejunum ratio, and the comparison of the simulated relationship of permeability and Fabs with the observed in vivo Peff and human Fabs had a MAE of 8.9% (Fig. 5A, D; Tab. 4). Simulating with the same Pi:Pjejunum ratio distributions but comparing with in vitro Papp of drugs and environmental chemicals, the results in Figure 5A show that the simulated relationship with 95% confidence interval (CI) only captured less than two-thirds of the data points (62%; 49 out of the sum of 70 drugs and 9 environmental chemicals). Additionally, the MAEs of drugs and environmental chemicals were both around 29%, and the MEs of drugs and environmental chemicals were -28% and -29%, respectively, showing an underestimation of Fabs under Scenario I (Fig. 5D; Tab. 4). Under this set of extrapolation assumptions, the PECAT model can predict 41% of drugs (29 out of 70 data points) and 56% of environmental chemicals (5 out of 9 data points) within \u00b1 20% error ranges.

The average values of the Pi:Pjejunum ratio of duodenum, ileum, and colon are smaller than 1, meaning that the jejunum permeability is generally greater than that of other segments and the jejunum has better absorption activity (Fig. 3A; Tab. 2), but distributions for all three ratios include 1. Figure 3B shows that distributions of the Pi:Pcolon ratios of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum all have mean values greater than 1 (Tab. 2), so that the colon permeability is on average lower than that of other segments, though again the distributions overlap with 1.\nBased on the results of normality tests, both kinds of regional intestinal permeability ratios are consistent with being lognormally distributed (p-value > 0.05; Tab. 2). As for understanding the relationship among ratios, the correlation matrixes of log-transformed Pi:Pjejunum ratios shown in Figure S8A1 suggest that the relationships of the ratios have relatively low correlation, with an absolute Pearson\u2019s R of less than 0.7 (p-value > 0.05).

The development of RTK-based IVIVE over the last 10 years (Rotroff et al., 2010; Wambaugh et al., 2014, 2015, 2018; Wetmore et al., 2012, 2015) has focused on developing\nComparing among the three scenarios, we found that the smallest MAEs and the largest percentage of accuracy (within \u00b1 20%) were reached under the extrapolation assumptions in Scenario III, where the IVIVC factors and the Pi:Pjejunum ratios are both integrated. These results also suggest that the in vitro Papp in Caco-2 cells cannot be directly assumed to be equal to in vivo Peff in the jejunum.\nIn further validation with the supplementary database (Tab. S41) under Scenario III (Fig. S91), the simulated relationship curve with 95% CI using the PECAT model with the same two scaling ratios captured 91% of data points (148 out of 162 points), and had overall MAE and ME of 15% and 5%, respectively, as well as 72% of data points (117 out of 163) within a range of \u00b1 20% of predictions. These results are similar to the predictive performance found using the main dataset. These results confirmed that the PECAT model using Papp as input and incorporating IVIVC factors and Pi:Pjejunum ratios can be used to predict the range of possible Fabs values for environmental chemicals.\nTo examine possible differences in performance across chemical classes, we used BDDCS classes. Table 4 shows that MAEs of drugs in Classes III and IV were generally higher than in Classes I and II, no matter which scenario was implemented. The smaller MAEs of Class II (Tab. 4) could suggest that Fabs of chemicals that are dominantly affected by efflux transporters can still be predicted well using Caco-2 data and our PECAT model\nFig. 4: Density plot of in vivo to in vitro permeability ratio\nThe in vivo to in vitro permeability ratio is the jejunum in vivo Peff divided by the in vitro Caco-2 Papp for chemicals where both measurements are available. 242 data points from 28 drugs are included.\nTab. 3: Summary of distribution of in vitro to in vivo permeability ratio\nMean SD Geo Mean Geo SD p-value Selected distribution\nNormal LogNormal\n0.134 0.244 0.059 3.766 < 0.001 0.644 LogNormal\nALTEX 40(3), 2023 479\ncability domain limitations when applying our PECAT model to predict bioavailability of compounds transported mainly via active transcellular and paracellular pathways (Youhanna and Lauschke, 2021). However, although data on such factors may be available for individual pharmaceuticals to enable adjustments to be made, there is much less such information for environmental chemicals, so we decided to take an empirical approach and treat this chemical-to-chemical variability, as well as inaccuracies due to lack of this information, as an uncertainty for any particular substance.\nAs for the choice of the empirical approach, Sun et al. (2002) used a linear regression model to describe the relationship of Peff and Papp, and this method is equivalent to our ratio method but with the regression slope assumed to be fixed at 1. To assess the impact of this assumption, we also conducted linear regression modeling without fixing the slope (supplementary materials, Section 3.11), which demonstrated that fitting the slope did not result in any noticeable improvements. Because the ratio approach is simpler, we retained that in our analysis. Moreover, there were sufficient data from pharmaceuticals on both sources of variability to develop probabilistic distributions that could be integrated into the overall modeling framework. Indeed, we found that utilizing these uncertainty distributions enabled the PECAT to be accurate with a MAE of 13%. Thus, the PECAT model, along with the corresponding updated Css equation, can be readily incorporated into RTK-based IVIVE, enabling more accurate risk prioritization.\nmethods for quantifying distribution (plasma protein binding assays) and metabolism (e.g., hepatocyte suspensions), relying on simplifying assumptions for other aspects of toxicokinetics \u2013 absorption (e.g., 100% gut absorption) and excretion (passive glomerular filtration for free chemical). In particular, while oral absorption is recognized as a major issue for drugs, the advances in this area from pharmaceutical development have not been applied to environmental chemicals. Here, we aim to address this gap by adapting approaches used for pharmaceuticals, focusing on integrating the most commonly used drug models, i.e., in vitro Caco-2 permeability and the in silico ACAT model, to develop our PECAT model.\nBased on our literature review, we found a high degree of chemical-to-chemical variability in the relationship between in vitro permeability and in vivo fraction absorbed. This variability has two sources: differences between in vitro apparent permeability and in vivo effective permeability, and differences in in vivo permeability across gut segments. These differences are no doubt due to numerous physicochemical factors as well as differences in the degree of active versus passive transport. For example, cases when the IVIVC is far away from 1 are likely due to the different expression levels of certain active uptake/ efflux transporters and/or different paracellular permeability between Caco-2 cells and human jejunum (Vaessen et al., 2017; Youhanna and Lauschke, 2021). The different physiology and proteomes of Caco-2 cells and human jejunum implied appli-\nTab. 4: Summary of mean absolute errors (MAE) and mean errors of comparing reported and predicted Fabs using drug and environmental chemicals permeability (Peff and Papp) under three simulation scenarios\nScenario Permeability BDDCS Overall\nClass I Class II Class III Class IV Not classified\nMean absolute errors\nI Drug Peff 5.13 2.99 14.12 27.10a 7.72a 8.90\nDrug Papp 29.30 22.65 49.89 41.54 7.26 29.29\nEnvi.

The in vivo data points of pharmaceutical chemicals were collected from Lennern\u00e4s (1998 and 2007) and Varma et al. (2012) and the in vitro ones were compiled from Artursson and Karlsson (1991), Bock et al. (2004), Lentz et al. (2000) and Volpe et al. (2007). The in vitro data of environmental chemicals was from Punt et al. (2022) and Turco et al. (2011).\nALTEX 40(3), 2023 482\nClass II (under Scenario III) can also explain that the assumption of \u201cswitched-off\u201d active transporters results in overpredicted Fabs, because the absorption of Class II drugs is affected by efflux transporters. On the other hand, O\u2019Hagan and Kell (2015) compared the apparent permeability measured without and with efflux inhibitors, and they concluded that there are no order-of-magnitude discrepancies between the two kinds of permeability. This is consistent with our finding that MAEs of Class II drugs are similar to those of Class I drugs, meaning Fabs of Class II drugs can be well predicted by our PECAT model.\nThe second key limitation is that we found very few environmental chemicals with both Caco-2 in vitro data and in vivo measurements of gut absorption. Although Caco-2 data can be generated relatively quickly, it is likely that in vivo measurements will need to rely largely on historical data, and systematic evidence mapping may be useful to determine the chemical space for which such data are available. In addition, we tried to use BDDCS criteria to classify environmental chemicals. However, the limited data on metabolism and solubility (Hosey et al., 2016; Wu and Benet, 2005) means that logP alone is used to classify metabolism, and ExpoCast with water solubility data from the EPA CompTox Chemical Dashboard is used to obtain specific solubility (dose number). These limitations could result in significant misclassification. Therefore, we also referred to other literature to classify the environmental chemicals. Most environmental chemicals in our study were classified as Class II (details shown in Tab. S31). Nonetheless, the assessment of PECAT performance by class is challenging and limited. Therefore, the PECAT model as currently formulated can, depending on the measured Caco-2 apparent permeability, lead to a very large range of predictions for permeability and fraction absorbed. At this point, it may be appropriate to view the current PECAT model as an initial screening tool in a tiered approach for environmental chemicals.\nThus, it will be important to test the PECAT model with additional datasets to better characterize its performance, particularly since the input distributions for IVIVC factors and gut segment-specific permeability ratios are based on drugs, which generally inhabit a different space of physicochemical properties as compared to environmental chemicals.\nFinally, chemical exposures occur via a variety of environmental media, and absorption after oral exposure, in particular, may be dependent on whether the compound is found in water, food, or soil, as well as whether the individual is in a fasted state. The PECAT model does not currently address such media-specific and time-dependent differences in absorption. However, for environmental chemicals, it is likely difficult to obtain data to parameterize these processes. The environmental chemical-specific Caco-2 permeability dataset is still limited, and development of a large dataset of uniformly conducted experiments would be helpful to improve application and testing of the PECAT model for environmental chemicals.\nOverall, we have developed a probabilistic, physiologically based modeling framework to integrate in vitro Caco-2 permeability measurements to make predictions of bioavailability that can be readily incorporated into risk assessment in general and\nWhen using Caco-2 permeability data to estimate in vivo permeability, the effect of various experimental settings such as pH value and absence/presence of transporter inhibitors on the IVIVC ratio should be discussed. We summarized the detailed information on experimental settings for the chemicals used to derive our IVIVC ratios in Tables S2 and S41, and examined the distributions based on different pH value and absence/presence of transporter inhibitor. These results are summarized in the supplementary materials, Section 3.21; we found that there are also no significant differences between distributions considering all IVIVC ratios or only considering IVIVC ratios under specific experimental settings, meaning that different pH value and presence of efflux transporter inhibitor would not significantly affect the distribution of IVIVC ratios for the datasets we utilized. We also should note that our empirical approach for IVIVC and segment-specific permeability ratios incorporates uncertainties related to passive vs. active transport. Specifically, while our model assumes only passive transport, the in vivo effective permeability and ex vivo apparent permeability data used to build these distributions include both active and passive transport. Thus, the uncertainty distributions for the IVIVC and segment-specific permeability ratios include the errors from assuming only passive transport. That being said, it is likely that our model is more suitable for chemicals absorbed by passive processes.\nOur approach has a number of limitations that require additional research. Most importantly, our model assumes that gut absorption is due to passive diffusion only. Although the model structure includes the possibility of active transport (both influx and efflux) and intestinal metabolism, these features are \u201cturned off\u201d (parameter values set to zero) in the simulations presented here because Caco-2 apparent permeability measurements (in the absence of inhibitors) do not provide any separate information on these processes. Thus, chemical-specific data from newer in vitro models (Youhanna and Lauschke, 2021) offer the possibility of improving the accuracy of PECAT model predictions. However, in the meantime, we believe the probabilistic outputs from PECAT appropriately reflect these uncertainties, though the accuracy appears different for different chemical classes.\nIn particular, although Caco-2 apparent permeability measured without transporter inhibitors cannot provide detailed information on absorptive and metabolic processes, BDDCS can assist in generally understanding the effects of active efflux and absorptive transporters on the performance of our model. In Figure 5, most data points of classes III and IV are located far away from the prediction line with more than \u00b1 20% differences. Based on Table 1, the absorption process of drugs in these two classes is determined by absorptive transporters and both absorptive and efflux transporters (Wu and Benet, 2005; Benet et al., 2011). This suggests that adding information on active transporters should increase accuracy when predicting the Fabs of chemicals in Classes III and IV. The negative mean error of drugs in Class III may indicate that \u201cswitched-off\u201d active transporters cause an underprediction of Fabs, because the absorption of Class III drugs in gut is determined by absorptive transporters.
