    "abstractText": "Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is an important and active part of the atmosphere. As known, microwave PWV retrieval is well applied for the ocean but challenging over land. In this article, we creatively established a microwave PWV retrieval spatial model over land using the back-propagation (BP) neural network to combine the high precision ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data and high spatial continuity satellite-borne data. Three-year data from 167 GNSS stations located in western America were utilized for training the network, and 40 untrained sites were selected as the test set. Rootmean-square error (RMSE) of the test set can reach 3.90 mm and 3.88 mm in the ascending (As) and descending (De) orbits. Then, we analyzed the influence of land cover types on the model over land. As a result, we found that stations located in the area with a single large-scale continuous land cover type had higher retrieval accuracy. In contrast, stations with diversified land cover types had lower precision. Furthermore, after fully considering the impact of land cover type, we performed an improved model with 61 stations on the single large-scale continuous grasslands, and the results of 8 stations as the test set showed that the RMSE could reach 3.41 and 3.31 mm in the As and De orbits. Compared with the spatial model established previously, the accuracy had been improved by about 13%. We think this is due to the stable physical properties (such as microwave emissivity) of the single large-scale continuous land cover type.",

PWV retrieval with high spatial resolution and accuracy can help us in environmental\nmonitoring and further improve space geodesy accuracy.\nThere are two methods commonly utilized to retrieve PWV, which are ground-based and space-based [10]. Ground-based observations usually have higher accuracy. The commonly used ground observation methods include GNSS observations, ground-based microwave radiometer observations, and radiosonde observations (RAOBs) [11], [12]. Among these methods, RAOBs can only detect the atmosphere twice daily, which has a poor time resolution. Differently, GNSS observations and ground-based microwave radiometers can\nprovide continuous observations with relatively high time resolution. However, ground-based observation can only be regarded as a technology in the point domain. It is challenging to apply on a global scale due to the high cost of constructing ground-based observation stations [13]. In contrast, spacebased observation, such as polar-orbiting satellites, can observe global data [14], [15]. Thus, space-based observation can be regarded as a measurement in the surface domain. According to the measurement band of the satellite-borne sensor, spacebased observation can be divided into two categories: optical\nand microwave remote sensing. Visible sensors such as the Global Ozone Monitoring Experience 2 (GOME-2) measuring on the water vapor absorption lines in the blue spectral band [16], near-infrared and thermal infrared sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measuring on the water vapor absorption lines near 0.94\u03bcm and 11\u03bcm are the standard tools of optical remote sensing used to retrieve PWV [14], [17], [18]. Due to the relatively short waveband of optical remote sensing measurement, the spatial resolution of water vapor retrieval in the optical band is\nEnvironmental Exploration Technology and Application, Ministry of Natural Resources, Guangzhou, China 510000 (e-mail: 202017714@mail.sdu.edu.cn; nanjiang@sdu.edu.cn;).

However, they have their own defects . Visible light remote sensing can only obtain data during the daytime, and infrared remote sensing can only be used for retrieval under clear sky conditions due to the weak penetrating ability [14],\n[17]. In contrast, although the spatial resolution of microwave remote sensing is lower than that of optical remote sensing, the microwave has a relatively strong penetration ability, so it can be used to retrieve PWV under nearly all conditions [19]. Water vapor has a strong absorption line near 22 GHz, and passive microwave sensors measuring at microwave frequencies of 18 and 23 GHz of the Earth's surface-atmosphere system are commonly used to retrieve PWV [20], [21]. Among these sensors, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is a widely used sensor.\nConsidering the characteristics of the high accuracy and time resolution of ground-based measurement and high spatial resolution of the space-based measurement, many algorithms have been proposed to integrate ground-based and space-based measurements. Among these algorithms, the neural network method is novel and reliable. Zhang and Yao [22] proposed a neural network method to use the high-quality GNSS PWV to calibrate and optimize the MODIS and European Centre for Medium\u2010Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) PWV\nbased on the dense GNSS stations in North America. Compared to the original MODIS and ERA5 PWV, the total improvements\nin root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 37.1% and 15.8%. In the spatial domain, most GNSS stations have been wellcalibrated, but there were still some stations that have not been well-calibrated. Stations with large RMSE were mainly distributed in the western coastal areas. Ma et al. [23] proposed a novel NIR retrieval algorithm based on MODIS products and GNSS stations located in North America, which had an excellent accuracy improvement in the entire spatial domain. Also, this research indicated that the land cover types in the spatial domain greatly influenced the retrieval model and\nanalyzed the model performance on different land cover types. Xiong, et al. [24] utilized a similar method to fuse GNSS, MODIS, and REA5 PWV data in CHINA at different timescales, and validation results demonstrated that modifying the MODIS and ERA5 PWV at the monthly timescale results had the best accuracy. Jiang, et al. [25] applied the back propagation neural network (BPNN) method to combine AMSR2 and GNSS data to retrieve PWV on the global scale. Data from 2012-2016 and 2017 at 82 GNSS stations distributed globally were utilized as training and test sets. The validation\nresults showed that the best mean RMSE of the test set was 3.53 mm. In the above studies, they only utilized the data of different time periods at the fixed GNSS stations as training and test sets. These algorithms can only predict the PWV values in the time domain on the trained stations , but they cannot predict the untrained stations. Therefore, these algorithms were still made in the time domain without extending to the spatial domain. In this article, we aimed to establish a spatial retrieval model to complete the prediction in the time and spatial domains over land using a neural network. Ground-based GNSS and satelliteborne microwave sensor AMSR2 data were utilized to build the\nmodel. Compared with infrared or visible light frequencies,\nmicrowave technology can get data under nearly all conditions and has been successfully applied over the oceans [26]. But microwave retrieval is challenging over land due to the variable emissivity of the complex land surface. And the accuracy of\nmicrowave PWV retrieval in the spatial domain is seriously affected by the complexity of land surface parameters [19]. Thus, for the spatial model over the land we established, here we will further improve the model by introducing the land cover types.\nIn this article, we selected the western region of the United States to establish a PWV retrieval spatial model using the neural network method to combine the AMSR2 and GNSS data. The GNSS-derived PWV (GNSS-PWV) data and other related parameters of 207 GNSS stations from the SuomiNet network\nof 2015-2017 and corresponding brightness temperature (Tbs) data of AMSR2 were selected as the dataset to train and test the neural network. Then, we further introduced the influence of land cover type on the built model over land in the spatial domain, and we proposed an improved model considering the land cover type in the end.\nThis article consists of five Sections: Section \u2160 is the introduction, Section II includes the data used in this article, Section III is the theory, Section IV consists of the results and discussion, and Section V is the conclusion."

It was carried on the sun-synchronous satellite Global Change Observation Mission 1st - Water \"SHIZUKU\" (GCOM-W 1) launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on 18 May 2012 [29]. The nominal passing time of AMSR2 is 1:30 am/pm over the equator, and this time will shift in each orbit. Also, the pixels in other latitude areas have different\nacquisition times [30]. The launch of AMSR2 and AMSR-E can help us better detect the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. In recent years, AMSR2 and AMSR-E have been widely applied to retrieve PWV and other products (such as land surface air, temperature and soil moisture) related to Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere [10], [25], [30], [34].\nThe Tbs products of AMSR2 were utilized to retrieve PWV, they are available in three levels: Level-1 (L1) is original observation, Level-2 (L2) is swath product of Tbs and Level-3 (L3) is global gridded Tbs product [31]. The products used in this article were global gridded products at 0.1-degree spatial\nresolution.

Many products related to the earth can be derived from the MODIS measurement. These products can be\ndivided into three categories: land, atmosphere, and ocean.\nThe global land cover type product MCD12C1 used in this article belongs to the land category. It describes land cover characteristics derived from observations of Terra and Aqua\nMODIS data and provides an annual image of the global land cover type. Each product file is a global grid product with a resolution of 0.05-degree, including 17 land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme\n(IGBP) [33]. We downloaded the products for the three years 2015 to 2017 and calculated the three-year average land cover type. The 17 land cover classes of the three-year average land cover type are shown in the color bar in Fig. 1. They are expressed by number 1-17 in the grid. The average land cover type of 2015-2017 was used here. The base map of Fig. 1 demonstrates the distribution of average land cover type in the experimental area.\nIn the experimental area, we can find that the land cover type\nis complex. In the northwest coastal area, there are dense forests.\nIn the southwest coastal area, there are mixed land cover types of grasslands, croplands, and urban. The land cover type in the central and northern parts is relatively simple, with grasslands playing a main role in this area. The south is a large area of shrublands, and Permanent is mixed in the shrublands. Northeast and southeast areas have some scattered Croplands. On these complex land cover types, dense GNSS stations are utilized to establish the spatial model."

When the neural network error exceeds the minimum preset mistake, the neural network will backpropagate to adjust the weights and thresholds. In the end, the neural network training stops when the neural network error reaches the preset minimum value or reaches the maximum training iterations .\nDue to the complex parameters over land related to microwave PWV retrieval, it is difficult to reflect the exact\nrelationship of PWV to each nonlinear parameter using the atmospheric radiative transfer equation. Therefore, the neural network is utilized here as a reliable method to deal with the relationships between PWV and each related parameter. Due to the strong water vapor absorption band near 22 GHz, 18 and 23 GHz channels of AMSR2 were widely used for PWV retrieval [37], [38]. Then, the absorption frequencies of CLW are 89 GHz and 36 GHz, and the polarization difference of 89 GHz and 36 GHz can be used to indicate the impact of CLW [39]. Land surface temperature and elevation can be obtained from\nSuomiNet GNSS Network and expressed as \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc3b. \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc3b are other parameters related to PWV retrieval [38], [39]. These related parameters will be applied as inputs in the neural network.\nFig. 3 shows the BP neural network structure designed in this article.

And, the whole 2015-2017 data of the 40 untrained stations in blue-red color shown in Fig. 1 were selected as the test set to predict. For the spatio-temporal matching for AMSR2 and GNSS data, the bilinear interpolation method was applied to perform spatial matching, and linear\ninterpolation was used to unify the time of GNSS-PWV with AMSR2. After spatio-temporal matching,71844 pairs of matched points of the training set and 17716 pairs of matched points of the test set for the As orbit were detected, 86777 and 20065 pairs of matched points for the De orbit were obtained.\nFig. 4 shows the points density figures , and it illustrates the comparison results between PWV from the BP neural network and GNSS.

In the As orbit (Fig. 4(a) and (b)), the R and RMSE values are 0.87 and 3.74 mm for the training set, 0.85 and 3.90 mm for the test set. In the De orbit (Fig. 4(c) and (d)), the R and RMSE values are 0.89 and 3.65 mm for the training set, 0.88 and 3.88 mm for the test set. The R values are all greater than 0.85, showing that the PWV from the BP neural network and GNSS PWV have a strong correlation. Then, RMSE was utilized to compare the accuracy. We can find that\nthe prediction accuracy of the test set is about 0.2 mm lower than the training set, which is small. This proved that the built model had excellent performance in predicting the PWV of the untrained stations in the time and spatial domains. Additionally, the results show that De orbit can match more points , and the accuracy of De orbit is slightly higher. We think that the lower accuracy of As orbit is attributed to the interference of sunlight. According to the microwave radiation transmission model, microwave sensors receive radiation emitted by the atmosphere and land surface [29, 38]. Thus, solar radiation can interfere\nwith the measurement. As known, the As orbit data are mainly collected during the daytime, and the De orbit data are observed at night. Therefore, the As orbit can get more interference from sunlight than the descending orbit, which causes that As orbit\nhas slightly lower accuracy.\nFurther, we calculated the RMSE on individual stations. Fig. 5 shows the RMSE histogram of stations as the test set. From Fig. 5, we can find that the RMSEs of different stations are uneven and have a big difference. There are about 5 stations in As orbit and 4 stations in De orbit with RMSEs larger than 5 mm. Then, we completed the spatial distribution of RMSE on individual GNSS stations, and Fig. 6 shows the results. The results of Fig. 6 show that the selected area has an uneven retrieval accuracy distribution. And the stations with high accuracy (blue points) are primarily located in the northern and\ncentral regions, while the stations with low accuracy (red and yellow points) are mainly distributed in the southwest and southeast area. We think it may be caused by the complex land cover types in the selected area."

On land, different types of land cover have different physical properties, which means the complexity of land cover types can cause the variability of land surface physical parameters. Thus, we think that the complex land cover types in the selected test area led to uneven spatial PWV retrieval accuracy.\nTo verify the above analysis, we need to simplify the land cover types to find the laws. Firstly, we performed the\nexperiment on the single land cover type. According to the land cover type on the station, we divided the GNSS stations into 8 categories. As shown in Table 1, in the selected area, most stations belong to the type of grasslands, with 94 stations,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Then, as shown in Fig. 1, the distributions of grasslands and shrublands are relatively clustered, and there were enough stations to establish the spatial model, while the distributions of other land cover types are relatively scattered. Therefore, we selected grasslands and shrublands as examples to establish a spatial model on the single land cover type.\nFig. 7 shows the RMSE spatial distribution on individual GNSS stations of the spatial model on grasslands and shrublands. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that stations located\non continuous grasslands and shrublands have higher accuracy,\nwhile stations with lower accuracy are located in the areas of grasslands and shrublands mixed with other land cover types. Take Fig. 7(a) and (c) as examples, the stations in the southwest and southeast are located on the grasslands, but they are scattered and surrounded by croplands and other land cover types. Therefore, the variability of the physical properties and physical parameters happens in these mixed land cover types, which will further cause low PWV retrieval accuracy. On the contrary, stations located on the entire grasslands areas without\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Fig. 7(b) and (d) show a similar phenomenon, stations located on entire shrublands have higher accuracy,\nwhile stations with lower accuracy are located on mixed land cover types. According to the results, we can conclude that the proposed spatial model can achieve relatively higher accuracy on a single large-scale continuous land cover type, but lower accuracy on mixed land cover types. This is because the single large-scale continuous land cover type has stable physical properties, but the mixed land cover types have variable physical properties.\nAccording to the above analysis, removing the stations located on the mixed land cover types and building the model\non the single large-scale continuous land cover type will improve the model. Thus, we only selected the GNSS stations located in the central single large-scale continuous grasslands area to build an improved spatial model. There were 61 stations selected for the improved model, 8 stations were utilized as the test set, and the remaining stations were utilized as the training set. After spatio-temporal matching, 23462 and 3323 pairs of matched points were selected as the training and test sets in the As orbit, 27653 and 3612 pairs of matched points were chosen in the De orbit. Similarly, the point density figures and RMSE\nspatial distribution figures on individual GNSS stations were utilized to verify the improved spatial model, which are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.\nFrom the results in Fig. 8, the BIASs are all close to 0, and the STDs are close to the RMSEs, which shows a low system difference. In the As orbit (Fig. 8(a) and (b)), the R and RMSE values are 0.79 and 3.35 mm for the training set, 0.77 and 3.41 mm for the test set. In the De orbit (Fig. 8(c) and (d)), the R and RMSE values are 0.83 and 3.24 mm for the training set, 0.84 and 3.31 mm for the test set. Compared with Fig. 4(a)\u2013(d), the\naccuracy of the improved model had increased by about 13%. From the results in Fig. 9(a) and (b), we also can see that the RMSEs in most points are small with blue color, which means the RMSE distribution is relatively uniform in the selected central area. This is because the improved model was built on a single large-scale continuous grasslands area. In this area, grasslands play a leading role without other land cover types. Thus, this area has single physical properties. The 13% accuracy improvement benefits from the switch in physical properties from variability to stability. This is also why\nmicrowave is well applied to the ocean.\nIn summary, the improved model established on the single large-scale continuous grasslands had a great performance. This example also verified the theoretical analysis in Fig. 7 that the microwave spatial model had high accuracy on the single largescale continuous land cover type but low accuracy on the mixed land cover types."

First, we successfully applied BP neural network to establish a spatial PWV model combined with the ground-based GNSS data and AMSR2 space-borne remote sensing data. The untrained\nstations were utilized as the test set to predict the PWV in the time and spatial domains. In the comparison of GNSS-PW V, the RMSEs of the test sets can reach 3.90 mm of As orbit and 3.88 mm of De orbit, and this proved that the spatial model we\nbuilt had an excellent prediction performance. Further, we found that the RMSE on individual GNSS stations was distributed unevenly. Second, we proposed that the great variability of physical properties (such as microwave emissivity parameter) happened on the complex land cover types and led to the uneven distribution of RMSE on individual GNSS stations. From the examples of grasslands and shrublands, we found that the spatial model had relatively higher accuracy on a single large-scale continuous land cover type, but had lower accuracy on mixed land cover types. This is because the single\nlarge-scale continuous land cover type has stable physical properties, and the mixed land cover types have variable ones. To further verify the above analysis, we proved an improved model on the single large-scale continuous grasslands in the central region. From the results, RMSEs are 3.41 mm of As orbit and 3.31 mm of De orbit for the test set. Compared with the spatial model established on all land cover types, the accuracy had been improved by about 13%, and the retrieval accuracy also had a more uniform spatial distribution. This accuracy improvement benefits from the switch in physical\nproperties from variability to stability.\nIn this article, based on the characteristics of GNSS and remote sensing observations, we used BP neural network to execute the combined operation with the point domain observations of GNSS stations and surface domain observations of remote sensing. Then, the PWV values of the untrained stations were well predicted in the time and spatial domains. And we analyzed the uneven spatial distribution of retrieval accuracy on the individual station. Additionally, the relationships between retrieval accuracy and land cover types\nwere discussed in depth. This study will probably make a contribution to microwave PWV retrieval and interdisciplinary research on remote sensing and GNSS.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.
