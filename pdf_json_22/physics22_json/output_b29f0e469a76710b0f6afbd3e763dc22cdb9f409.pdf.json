    "abstractText": "Using mock data for the Hubble diagrams of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and quasars (QSOs) generated based on the standard model of cosmology, and using the least-squares method based on the Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, we first put constraints on the cosmographic parameters in the context of the various model-independent cosmographic methods reconstructed from the Taylor 4 and 5 order expansions and the Pade (2,2) and (3,2) polynomials of the Hubble parameter, respectively. We then reconstruct the distance modulus in the framework of cosmographic methods and calculate the percentage difference between the distance modulus of the cosmographic methods and that of the standard model. The percentage difference is minimized when the Pade approximation is used which means that the Pade cosmographic method is sufficiently suitable for reconstructing the distance modulus even at high-redshifts. In the next step, using the real observational data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs, gamma-ray-bursts (GRBs), and observations from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in two sets of the low-redshift combination (SNIa+QSOs+GRBs+BAO) embracing the redshift range of 0.01 < z < 2.26 and the high-redshift combination (SNIa+QSOs+GRBs) which covers a redshift range of 0.01 < z < 5.5, we put observational constraints on the cosmographic parameters of the Pade cosmography and also the standard model. Our analysis indicates that Pade cosmographic approaches do not reveal any cosmographic tension between the standard model and the observational data. We also confirm this result, using the statistical AIC criteria. Finally, we put the cosmographic method in the redshift-bin data and find a larger value of \u03a9m0 extracted from s0 parameter compared with those of the q0 parameter and Planck-\u039bCDM values.",

            "text": "Can high-redshift Hubble diagrams rule out the standard model of cosmology in the context of cosmographic method?\nS. Pourojaghi,1 N. F. Zabihi,1 and M. Malekjani1, \u2217\n1Department of Physics, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan 65178, Iran\nUsing mock data for the Hubble diagrams of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and quasars (QSOs) generated based on the standard model of cosmology, and using the least-squares method based on the Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, we first put constraints on the cosmographic parameters in the context of the various model-independent cosmographic methods reconstructed from the Taylor 4th and 5th order expansions and the Pade (2,2) and (3,2) polynomials of the Hubble parameter, respectively. We then reconstruct the distance modulus in the framework of cosmographic methods and calculate the percentage difference between the distance modulus of the cosmographic methods and that of the standard model. The percentage difference is minimized when the Pade approximation is used which means that the Pade cosmographic method is sufficiently suitable for reconstructing the distance modulus even at high-redshifts. In the next step, using the real observational data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs, gamma-ray-bursts (GRBs), and observations from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in two sets of the low-redshift combination (SNIa+QSOs+GRBs+BAO) embracing the redshift range of 0.01 < z < 2.26 and the high-redshift combination (SNIa+QSOs+GRBs) which covers a redshift range of 0.01 < z < 5.5, we put observational constraints on the cosmographic parameters of the Pade cosmography and also the standard model. Our analysis indicates that Pade cosmographic approaches do not reveal any cosmographic tension between the standard model and the observational data. We also confirm this result, using the statistical AIC criteria. Finally, we put the cosmographic method in the redshift-bin data and find a larger value of \u2126m0 extracted from s0 parameter compared with those of the q0 parameter and Planck-\u039bCDM values.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn 1998, observations of SNIa confirmed that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion [1\u20133]. In addition, this accelerated phase has been approved by a large body of the cosmic observations including Wilkinson the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [4\u20136], the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), WMAP, 2dFGRS, and 6dFGS observations of the largescale structure (LSS), and the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements [7\u201312], high-redshift galaxies [13], high-redshift galaxy clusters [14, 15] and weak gravitational lensing [16\u201318]. In order to interpret the accelerated expansion of the universe, some cosmological groups modified the standard theory of gravity and considered that the theory of general relativity (GR) encounters problems on cosmological scales [19\u201323]. For a recent review see [24]. In contrast, other groups have considered an unknown substance with negative pressure the so-called dark energy (DE) as a responsible for this acceleration. From the later point of view, the simplest cosmological model is the \u039bCDM model, also known as the concordance model, which has a constant equation of state (EoS) for DE equal to \u22121. In this model, the \u039b and CDM stand for cosmological constant and cold dark matter, respectively. Even though the \u039bCDM cosmology is in good agreement with a large\n\u2217 malekjani@basu.ac.ir\nbody of the observational data, it suffers from fundamental problems like fine-tuning and cosmic coincidence [25\u2013 29]. In addition, recently a conflict in the Hubble constant value has been emerged by CMB measurements of Planck with classical distance ladder [30]. These discrepancies have led to cosmological tensions, which have been a popular topic lately, and a wide variety of DE models with time-varying EoS have been emerged so far to solve these problems [31\u201339]. For a recent review about the cosmological tensions of the standard model of cosmology, we refer the reader to [40]. In recent years, many efforts have been made to obtain the best cosmological model with the lowest inconsistency with observational data. By comparing different models, some have been ruled out, though some showed good agreement with the observational data (see [41\u201346]). While the expansion of the universe can be investigated model dependently, one can study the expansion history of the universe directly from observational data without considering any particular model. These approaches are recognized as model-independent methods. Gaussian process is a non-linear Bayesian approach that can directly reconstruct observational data. The method is based on the distribution over function, and a covariance function will be included to connect two distinct data points, and the process will progress to predict other data values in higher redshifts [47\u201349]. This approach has been applied broadly in cosmology [49\u201354]. Another model-independent method is the smoothing method, a non-parametric iterative approach that reconstructs functions from an initial ansatz. It uses a smoothing kernel, and each step results in a better fit for ar X iv :2 21 2. 04 11 8v 1 [ as tr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n8 D\nec 2\n02 2\n2 the cosmological data [55]. Genetic algorithm is another model-independent approach inspired by natural selection used in [56] on supernova Ia data to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z). More details and applications of the Genetic algorithm in cosmology can be found in [57]. Artificial neural network (ANN) can be considered as another model-independent method that has also been used as a non-parametric reconstruction of the cosmological functions that does not assume any statistical distribution of observational data [58]. Finally, the cosmographic approach, which would be used in this paper as a model-independent approach, is basically defined on the basis of the Taylor expansion of cosmological functions of scale factor a (or equivalently cosmic redshift z) such as Hubble parameter and luminosity distance around the present time z = 0. This approach has commonly been used in literature [59\u201370]. This method relies only on the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe described in the FriedmanLemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. While a Taylor expansion with respect to redshift z can estimate the cosmic evolution at z \u223c 0, it fails at high redshifts (see [71\u201373] for earlier attempts). The main issue of Taylor series in z-redshift, is the convergence problem at high redshifts causes to serve the error propagation in Taylor series and consequently reduces the cosmography prediction [61, 74\u201376]. One possible way to improve the cosmography method is the use of the auxiliary variables to re-parameterize the redshift variable through functions of z, for example y-redshift as y = z/(1 + z) [63]. The other way is to assume a smooth evolution of the observable quantities by expanding them in terms of rational approximations like Pade [64, 65, 75, 77\u201379] and Chebyshev polynomials [80].\nRecently, Lusso, et. al., [67] by using the high-redshift Hubble diagrams of QSOs and GRBs claimed the existence of a big tension between the cosmographic parameters of the standard \u039bCDM model and those of the cosmographic method defined on the basis of the logarithmic expansion of the luminosity distance in terms of y-redshift [see also 81]. Notice that the result of [67] is impacted by cosmographic method, as explained in [82]. The cosmographic approach presented in [67], has been extended to a general case by applying the orthogonalized logarithmic polynomials of the luminosity distance [69]. In this general case, the authors of [69] showed a big tension (> 4\u03c3) between the standard model and model-independent cosmographic method using the Hubble diagrams of SNIa and QSOs. It should be emphasized that the above tension depends on the slope parameter of the log-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosities of QSOs described by logLX = \u03b3 logLUV + \u03b2. The non-evolution treatment of this relation against cosmic redshift has been tested in [81]. They drove an average value for the slope parameter \u03b3 \u223c 0.6, insensitively from the specific choice of the redshift bins of their analysis. However, it is mentionable that the authors of [83] showed a slight\nchange of the slope parameter can make the 4\u03c3 tension disappear. In the other word, they found that the QSOs relation can affect the cosmographic constraints. Going beyond the standard model, Rezaei et al., in [68] investigated three different DE parameterizations namely wCDM, CPL and Pade parameterization for EoS parameter using the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs and GRBs in the cosmographic method . Based on the 4th order Taylor expansion of the Hubble parameter, they showed that these parameterizations are consistent with model-independent cosmographic approach. The same study has been done for the holographic dark energy (HDE) model with time-varying EoS parameter in [84]. In the context of cosmographic method based on the 4th order Taylor expansion of the Hubble parameter, Pourojaghi and Malekjani showed that there is no tension between HDE model and high-redshift Hubble diagrams of QSOs and GRBs [84].\nOn the other hand, the authors in [85] have shown that the logarithmic polynomial expansion of the luminosity distance, which is the basis for the strong claim [67, 69, 81] that there is a deviation of about 4\u03c3 from the flat-\u039bCDM model when fitted to high-redshift Hubble diagrams of QSOs and GRBs, holds up to redshifts z \u223c 2. In other words, the log polynomial approximation cannot recover the flat-\u039bCDM model at higher redshifts and thus undermines the 4\u03c3 tension claim [see also 82]. Overall, we should be very careful when applying the cosmographic method at high-redshifts, implying that we should be able to recover the flat-\u039bCDM model. It is worth noting that the direct fit of the standard model to the QSOs data shows a deviation of about 4\u03c3 in the best-fit matter density \u2126m0 = 0.9 from the flat-\u039bCDM value \u2126m0 = 0.3 [82]. In this fit, a universe without DE (\u2126m = 1) lies within the 1\u03c3 confidence region. We note that the dynamical DE models are in complete agreement with high-redshift Hubble diagrams of QSOs and GRBs in the context of the cosmographic method [68, 84]. On the basis of the above description, we should validate the cosmographic approach before getting any conclusion at high-redshifts. In this regard, the authors of [64] showed that the cosmographic approach based on the rational Pade series performs better than the standard Taylor series at redshifts z > 1. In addition to Pade polynomials, the other rational polynomials that have been used in cosmographic method is the Chebyshev approximations [80]. It has been shown that the rational Chebyshev series works better than standard Taylor series and reduces the error truncation [80]. In the context of inverse cosmography [see 66], the Chebyshev-like EoS parameter of DE mimics the Pade EoS parameter at high-redshifts, but it has a divergence at low-redshifts [86].\nOne possible way to examine the validity of the cosmographic method at high-redshifts is the use of mock data for the Hubble diagram generated upon the\n3 cosmological model. In this concern, we expect that the distance modulus of both cosmographic method and cosmological model are to agree with the mock data. In fact any tension between cosmographic method and mock data has not physical meaning and therefore is related to the error truncation of the mathematical approximation used in cosmographic approach. We investigate both Taylor and Pade approximations of the Hubble parameter used in cosmographic method for reconstructing the distance modulus of SNIa, QSOs and GRBs. Using mock data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa and QSOs produced based on the normal distribution around the mean value \u00b5\u039b(zi), where \u00b5\u039b(zi) is the distance modulus of the standard flat-\u039bCDM model, we can choose the best approximation of Hubble parameter for cosmographic method. The goal of our analysis based on mock data is to show that the rational pade approximation performs better than Taylor series beyond z = 1, where the standard cosmographic approach suffers from convergence problem. We will show that unlike to Taylor series, the approximation is under control in the rational Pade polynomials. After fixing the cosmographic method that performs at higher redshift with a minimum error truncation, we compare the best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters of standard \u039bCDM model obtained using the real observational data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs and GRBs, with those of the model-independent cosmographic method constrained with the same data sets. Comparing these two measurements can lead us to get a reasonable conclusion about the consistency of the standard \u039bCDM model with the observational Hubble diagrams from SNIa, QSOs and GRBs.\nThe layout of this article is as follows: In section II, we will introduce cosmographic approaches based on the linear Taylor series, and rational Pade series. We then present the cosmographic parameters for cosmographic approaches and also for the standard \u039bCDM model. In section III, the process of producing mock data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa and QSOs has been presented. We then study the validation of the cosmographic methods using mock data. In section IV, using the combinations of low-redshift and high-redshift observational data, we put observational constraints on the cosmographic parameters of the flat-\u039bCDM model and compare the results with the confidence regions of the model-independent cosmographic method obtained from the same data sets. Ultimately, in section V, we conclude this work."

            "text": "Recently, many attempts have been made to investigate the model-independent approaches, extracting information directly from the observational data instead of\nutilizing DE models. Cosmography is one of the modelindependent methods, which profits from an uncomplicated assumption of homogeneity and isotropy, and can assist us to investigate the evolution of the universe. By using the Friedman- Lemaitre- Robertson- Walker (FLRW) metric, one can express cosmographic parameters by scale factor derivatives with respect to cosmic time as follows [73]:\nH = a(1) a , q = \u2212 a (2) aH2 , j = a(3) aH3 ,\ns = a(4)\naH4 , l =\na(5) aH5 ,m = a(6) aH6 , (1)\nWhere a(n) denotes the nth derivatives of the scale factor. We note that cosmography parameters are independent of dark energy and its equation of state. Hence the cosmography procedure is purely independent of the model. The cosmographic parameters pointed above are extremely valuable observables for extracting information from the universe when calculated at the present time. Moreover, each has a physical meaning behind them, making them proper for explaining the expansion history of the universe. Hubble function with the equation of H = a\u0307a indicates the expansion or contraction phase of the universe (a\u0307 > 0\u2192 H > 0\u2192 expansion). Sign of the deceleration parameter, q = \u2212 a\u0308aH2 , controls the accelerated or decelerated expansion phase of the universe. When q < 0, a\u0308 > 0 reveals that the universe is in accelerating phase. Other cosmographic parameters will become important at higher redshifts. For more information about the physical meanings of cosmographic parameters, we refer the reader to [84]."

            "text": "As mentioned before, there are limitations in using cosmography based on Taylor\u2019s expansion of z-redshift at high-redshifts. In other words, Taylor\u2019s expansion of the Hubble diagram has divergence problems at z > 1; consequently, the predictions will be unproductive. On the other hand, though utilizing y-redshift in Taylor\u2019s expansion improve the high-redshifts divergence problem. Since we cannot continue the Taylor expansion (both zredshift and y-redshift) to infinity, the error truncation in a particular order causes an inaccuracy in our computations and consequently affects the results. One of the approaches proposed to overcome this limitation is utilizing the rational Pade approximation to reconstruct the Hubble parameter [64, 65, 75, 79]. Compared to Taylor\u2019s expansion, the Pade parametrization has better efficiency. Since the rational Pade approximation makes divergence amplitude larger, it can increase the convergence domain of the approximation. Thus utilizing it leads to more accurate results in such a way that in cases where Taylor expansion loses efficiency because of divergency, Pade approximation can be a better solution. Typically, a Pade approximation in (n,m) order can be defined as follows:\nPn,m(z) = P0+P1z+...+Pnz\nn\n1+Q1z+...+Qmzm =\nn\u2211 i=0 Piz i\n1+ m\u2211 j=0 Qjz j , (10)\n5 where P and Q coefficients correspond to the Taylor expansion coefficients as below:\nPn,m(0) = f(0) P \u2032n,m(0) = f \u2032(0)\n.\n.\n.\nP (n+m)n,m (0) = f (n+m)(0) . (11)\nConsidering a Taylor expansion as f(z) = \u03a3\u221e0 Ciz i and equalizing it with the Pade approximation, P and Q coefficients can be achieved according to the Taylor series coefficients as follow:\n\u221e\u2211 i=0 Ciz i =\nn\u2211 i=0 Piz i\n1 + m\u2211 j=0 Qjz j .

Therefore coefficients of Pade approximation based on the Taylor expansion coefficients can be achieved having n+m+ 1 equations and n+m+ 1 unknowns.

Nevertheless, in order to make a comparison between the cosmographic method and model, we additionally have to extract the cosmographic parameters of model. In the context of GR, by assuming a flat FLRM metric, the Hubble parameter for a universe composed by radiation, matter and DE can be written as follows:\nH2(z) = H20 [\u2126m0(1 + z) 3+ , \u2126r0(1 + z) 4 + (1\u2212 \u2126m0 \u2212 \u2126r0)e3 \u222b dz 1+z (1+w)] , (16)\nwhere H0, \u2126m0 , and \u2126r0 represent values of the Hubble parameter, pressure-less matter, and radiation energy density, respectively, at the current time.

We use the Pantheon sample for supernovae type Ia dataset with redshift ranging 0.01 < z < 2.26 that contains 1048 type Ia supernovae gathered from different surveys like PanSTARRS1, SDSS, SNLS, various low-z, and HST samples [88]. We also use 1598 data points ranging 0.04 < z < 5.1 for QSOs as the distance indicator from [81]. We use the observed redshift and error bars of SNIa and QSOs from the above dataset for generating mock data. The theoretical distance modulus for a given redshift is as follows:\n\u00b5(z) = 5 log10(1 + z) \u222b z 0 dz E(z) + \u00b50 , (19)\nwhere \u00b50 = 42.384 \u2212 5 log10(h). We first calculate the distance modulus for the flat-\u039bCDM model, \u00b5\u039b(zi), in any given redshift zi from Eq.(19) and by implementing Eq.(17). Here, we set the canonical values \u2126m0 = 0.3 and h = 0.7. Mock data are generated using a normal distribution with \u00b5\u039b(zi) as mean and \u2206\u00b5(zi) as standard deviation. Here, \u2206\u00b5(zi) are considered as the observational errors of SNIa and QSOs data points, and zi are their observational redshifts. To ensure that our mock data has been well produced upon the \u039bCDM model, we put constraints on the \u2126m0 parameter using mock data and compare the result with the canonical value \u2126m0 = 0.3. To do this, we adopt the standard minimization of chi-square function based on the statistical MCMC algorithm as below:\n\u03c72 = \u2211 i [\u00b5th(zi)\u2212 \u00b5moc(zi)]2 \u03c32i . (20)\nWhere \u00b5th and \u00b5moc denote theoretical and mock distance modulus, respectively, and \u03c3i indicates corresponding errors of mock data. We can confirm the procedure of generating mock data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa and QSOs, if the canonical value \u2126m0 = 0.3 is in full consistency with 1\u03c3 confidence region of \u2126m0 obtained from our MCMC analysis. After confirming that mock data is performing precisely, free parameters of the Taylor and Pade expansions will be constrained using this mock data within the context of MCMC algorithm. Ultimately, distance modulus of standard \u039bCDM and each of the Pade and Taylor expansions can be calculated using the best fit values of the free parameters. The percentage difference between distance modulus of \u039bCDM and each of the expansions which is given by\n\u2206 = \u00b5cosmography \u2212 \u00b5\u039b\n\u00b5\u039b \u00d7 100 , (21)\nshows the accuracy of the cosmographic method. Lower \u2206 for each pair of comparison between expansions and the \u039bCDM model can reveal the minor error truncation, which indicates that the mentioned expansion will work better when used in the model-independent cosmographic approach.

            "text": "In Fig.(1), our constrain utilizing mock SNIa data indicates \u2126m0 = 0.3\u00b10.013. Since the canonical value of \u2126m0 is in 1\u03c3 confidence level, we conclude that the mock data for the Hubble diagram of SNIa are properly generated on \u00b5\u039b(z). Furthermore, using Eq.(18), the best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters for the flat standard model are obtained as reported in the first row of Tab.I. On the other hand, using mock SNIa data, we constraint the cosmographic parameters model-independently for different cosmographic methods defined based on the 4th and 5th order Taylor expansions as well as Pade (2,2) and Pade (3,2) approximations, respectively. Our numerical results for various cosmographic methods are presented in Tab. II. In Fig.(2), we show 1\u03c3 to 3\u03c3 confidence levels of q0 and j0 parameters for the different cosmographic methods. We observe that in the cases of cosmographic methods beyond 4th order Taylor series, we get larger confidence regions for cosmographic parameters q0 and j0. Now, using the best-fit values of cosmographic parameters, we reconstruct the distance modulus for different cosmographic methods and compare them with that of the standard flat-\u039bCDM model. We also compare the best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters q0 and j0 obtained in flat-\u039bCDM with the confidence regions of the same parameters obtained in cosmographic methods. Results are shown in Fig. 3. Our results for the cosmographic method based on the 4th order Taylor series are shown in panels (A & B). In panel (A), we observe that the difference between the distance modulus of the standard model and that of the cosmographic method based on the 4th order Taylor series reaches to 0.39% at redshift z = 2.5. In panel (B), we observe no significant difference between \u039bCDM value and confidence region of cosmography for q0 parameter, while a 3.2\u03c3 deviation is seen for the j0 parameter. We also observe tensions 6.22\u03c3 and 5.22\u03c3, respectively, for higher cosmographic parameters s0 and l0 by comparing first rows of Tabs. (I & II). These big differences indicate that the cosmographic method based on the 4th order Taylor series is inadequate to reconstruct the distance modulus up to redshift z = 2.5. We emphasize that mock SNIa data were generated based on the standard \u039bCDM model. Therefor, we expect the standard model to be well fitted to the mock data. On the other hand, as a model-independent approach, we expect the cosmographic method to be consistent with mock data and consequently with the standard \u039bCDM model. Hence, in the analysis based mock data, any significant difference between the cosmographic approach and the standard model can be interpreted as an inadequacy of the cosmographic method due to errors of mathematical approximation. The insufficiency of the 4th order Taylor expansion of the Hubble parameter is also confirmed from the statistical AIC and BIC criteria in [83].\nIn panels (C & D), we display the results for cosmography based on the 5th order Taylor series. In panel\n(C), we observe that the percentage difference between the reconstructed distance modulus in cosmographic method and that of the flat-\u039bCDM model reduces to 0.28%. Consequently, we detect no tension between flat-\u039bCDM model and cosmographic method in q0 \u2212 j0 plane in panel (D). Comparing the first row of Tab. I and the second row of Tab.II, we also observe that the higher cosmographic parameters s0, l0 and m0 of the standard model are consistent with those of the cosmographic method. This means that we can apply the cosmographic method defined on the basis of the 5th order Taylor series of the Hubble parameter for reconstructing the distance modulus at redshifts lower than z = 2.5. In panels (E & F), we present our results for Pade (2,2) approximation. In this case the percentage difference reduces to the value 0.22% and consequently we have no tension between cosmographic parameters q0 and j0 of the standard model and those of the cosmographic approach. In addition, we detect the statistical 1.3\u03c3 and 0.11\u03c3 errors, respectively, for the values of s0 and l0 parameters (compare first row of Tab.I and third row of Tab.II). Hence, cosmography based on the rational Pade (2,2) approximation is also an appropriate model-independent method for reconstructing the distance modulus diagram at SNIa redshifts. Notice that Pade (2,2) has one lower free parameter than 5th order Taylor series. Though, Pade (2,2) approximation shows reasonable consistency with the \u039bCDM model, examining Pade (3,2) approximation can also enhance the certainty of employing the Pade approximation in the context of the cosmographic approach. In panels (G & H) of Fig. 3, we present our results for Pade (3,2) cosmographic method. The difference between distance modulus of Pade(3,2) cosmography and the standard model is 0.16%, which is the lowest value compared with the previous cases. It is reasonable to infer that in this case, the error of Pade (3,2) is so small that it can be considered almost negligible. On the other hand, same as Pade (2,2), the cosmographic parameters of the standard model, including q0 and j0 parameters, are well constrained in confidence levels of the cosmographic approach based the Pade (3,2) approximation. Correspondingly, the difference between the s0, l0, and m0 parameters in the two approaches is 0.09\u03c3, 1.08\u03c3 and 0.66\u03c3, respectively. Thus, we have an excellent consistency between Pade (3,2) cosmographic method and standard model, indicating that this case of cosmographic method can be applied for reconstructing the low-redshift (redshifts smaller than \u223c 2.5) distance modulus diagram model-independently."

In Fig. 4, we see that the canonical value \u2126m0 = 0.3 is full consistent with the constrained value with the difference lower than 1\u03c3 error. This means that mock data for Hubble diagram of QSOs generated based on the canonical value \u2126m0 = 0.3 and h = 0.7 are properly fitted to the standard \u039bCDM model. Now, using Eq. (18) and constraints on \u2126m0 obtained from mock QSO sample, we obtain the best fit-values and 1\u03c3 to 3\u03c3 confidence levels of cosmographic parameters in the flat-\u039bCDM model, as reported in the second row of Tab.(I). Comparing the first and second rows of Tab.(I), we see that the best-fit values of cosmographic parameters in flat-\u039bCDM model respectively obtained from mock SNIa and mock QSOs are consistent to each other. In the next step, using mock QSOs data, we constrain the cosmographic parameters in the context of various cosmographic methods considered in this work. Results are presented in Tab.(III). In addition, in Fig.(5), we show 1\u03c3 to 3\u03c3 confidence regions of cosmographic parameters q0 and j0 for different cos-\nmographic methods. As a quick result, we observe that the confidence level of j0 obtained from the cosmographic method based on the 4th order of Taylor expansion completely differs from j0 = 1 which means that this cosmographic method is not valid. Using the best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters presented in Tab.(III), we reconstruct the Hubble diagram in the context of cosmographic methods as shown in left panels of Fig. (6). In right panels, we show the confidence regions of q0 and j0 parameters and compare the results of cosmographic methods with \u039bCDM values. In panel (A), we observe that the percentage difference between reconstructed distance modulus in cosmographic method based on 4th order Taylor series and \u00b5\u039b reaches to 0.69% at z \u223c 5.5. In panel (B), our constraint shows that q0 and j0 parameters in cosmographic approach based on the 4th order Taylor series are equal to q0 = \u22120.963+0.054\u22120.046 and j0 = 2.75 +0.13 \u22120.17, while corresponding values in the standard flat-\u039bCDM model are q0 = \u22120.553+0.014\u22120.014 and j0 = 1.00. This issue indicates a big difference equal to 7.9\u03c3 on q0 and 11.6\u03c3 on j0 parameters, as shown in panel (B). According to\n10\n11\nthe above result, it is evident that the cosmographic approach based on the 4th order Taylor expansion of the Hubble parameter will not be consistent with the standard model at higher redshift [see also 68, 81]. This inconsistency is due to the error of 4th order Taylor series at high-redshifts. Nevertheless, as shown in panel (C) of Fig.(6), utilizing the cosmographic approach based on the 5thorder Taylor expansion of the Hubble parameter can decrease the percentage difference to the value 0.58%. In addition, we can notice that despite the Taylor\u2019s 4th order expansion, no significant difference can be shown between q0 and j0 parameters in \u039bCDM model and confidence regions in cosmographic method based on the 5th order Taylor expansion, as shown in panel (D) of Fig.(6). It can be concluded that by increasing the order of Taylor expansion, the difference between cosmographic parameters of the \u039bCDM model and confidence regions of the cosmographic method based on the Taylor series will decrease. In the other words, the inconsistency between Taylor cosmographic method and the standard model will vanish. Comparing the constrained values of the second row of Tab.(III) and the second row of Tab.(I), we observe no significant difference between higher cosmographic parameters of the model-independent cosmographic approach and flat-\u039bCDM cosmology. This result shows that we can use the cosmographic method based on the 5th order Taylor expansion to reconstruct the distance modulus up to high-redshift z \u223c 5. In panels (E & F) of Fig.(6), our results for the cosmographic method based on the Pade (2,2) approximation have been shown. As shown in panel (E), employing cosmography based on the Pade (2,2) approximation reduces the difference in distance modulus diagrams to 0.02%. In addition, panel (F) shows that in this case, the consistency between the cosmographic parameters in the model-independent approach and the standard model is higher than the previous case. Ultimately, the cosmographic parameters have been constrained using the cosmographic approach based on the Pade (3,2) approximation. In this case, the difference between the distance modulus diagram in the standard model and the cosmographic approach is 0.42%, which is less than the 4th and 5th order Taylor expansions but more than Pade (2,2) approximation. According to the panels G and H in Fig.(6), together with the results of fourth-row in Tab.(III), we report no deviation between the cosmographic parameters in this approach and the standard model. Based on the above results, it can be inferred that in higher redshifts, cosmography using the 5th order Taylor expansion and the approximations of the Pade(2,2) and (3,2) can be a reliable approach for reconstructing the Hubble diagram of cosmological objects like QSOs and GRBs. Although the 5th order Taylor series in cosmographic method works correctly at high-redshifts, the Pade (2,2) approximation with one lower free parameter is more reliable approximation to be employed. Accordingly in the next section, we constrain the cosmographic parameters using the real observational data for the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs and GRBs in\nthe context of cosmographic method defined based on the Pade (2,2) and Pade (3,2) approximations. In this concern, if the observational data reveals any significant deviation between the cosmographic parameters of cosmographic methods and flat-\u039bCDM model, it can be interpreted as an observational tension for standard model."

In this section, we compare the flat\u039bCDM model with the Pade cosmographic approaches, using the real observational data. Since the error truncation of Pade (2,2) and Pade (3,2) are negligible at least up to redshift z \u223c 5.5, if any tension between the cosmographic parameters of standard model and those of the cosmographic method is revealed using the observational Hubble diagrams or other cosmological data, it is due to the standard model itself. In this study, we set two combinations of observational data samples including Hubble diagram of SNIa in the Pantheon catalogue, BAO measurements, binned data for Hubble diagram of QSOs, and the Hubble diagram of GRBs. We mention that the complete sample of QSOs contains 1598 data points ranging 0.04 < z < 5.1, while we used a binned catalogue including 25 data points from [81]. More details of sample selection and the procedure of binned data have been discussed in 81. The data sample for GRBs used in this research contains 137 data points at the redshift range 0.03 < z < 5.5 collected in [89]. We note that the GRBs sample in [89] has 141 data points extended to redshift 9.3. However, we neglect 4 data points at redshifts higher than z = 5.5, because our Pade cosmographic methods was not examined beyond z \u223c 5.5, in the previous section. We\n12\nuse the BAO data from seven different surveys: 6dFGS, SDSS-LRG, BOSS-MGS, BOSS-LOWZ, WiggleZ, BOSSCMASS, BOSS-DR 12 [for details see 90, 91]. Sample (i) includes the low-redshift data: SNIa+BAO+QSOs (up to z=1.8)+GRBs (up to z=2), which embraces redshift range 0.01 < z < 2.26 and sample (ii) includes all observational data: SNIa+QSOs+GRBs that covers redshift\nrange 0.01 < z < 5.5. Notice that the binned QSOs up to z = 1.8 contains 16 data points from all 25 data points. In addition, GRBs at z < 2 includes 76 data points from all 141 data points. In the case of sample (i), we read the total chi-square from\n\u03c72tot = \u03c7 2 SNIa + \u03c7 2 QSOs(z<1.8) + \u03c7 2 GRBs(z<2) + \u03c7 2 BAO,(22)\nand in the case of sample (ii), we use\n\u03c72tot = \u03c7 2 SNIa + \u03c7 2 QSOs + \u03c7 2 GRBs . (23)\nOur numerical results for minimizing \u03c72 function in the context of MCMC algorithm have been reported in Tabs.(IV , V & VI). In Tab.(IV), we first report the best fit values of the free parameters of the flat-\u039bCDM model for both dataset combinations and then show the best fit values of the cosmographic parameters of the model, utilizing Eq.(18). In Tab.V (Tab.VI), we present the best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters in the context of Pade cosmographic methods, using sample (i) (sample ii). In the following, we discuss our numerical results in this section.\nA. Numerical results for sample (i)\nAs it is shown in the upper part of Tab.(IV) for sample (i), using the low-redshift observations including SNIa, QSOs (z < 1.8), GRBs (z < 2) and BAO, we can put observational constraints on the cosmological parameters \u2126m0 and h of the standard flat-\u039bCDM model as \u2126m0 = 0.3011 +0.008 \u22120.008 and h = 0.7167 \u00b1 0.0018. Our constraints on h = H0/100 is between the Planck measurement H0 = 67.4 \u00b1 0.5 kms\u22121Mpc\u22121 [92] and local determinations H0 = 73.0 \u00b1 1.4 kms\u22121Mpc\u22121 [93]. Using\n13\nour constrains on \u2126m0 and Eq.(18), we obtain the bestfit values of the cosmographic parameters in flat-\u039bCDM cosmology, as reported in the middle part of Tab.(IV) for sample (i). Finally, we report the minimum value of \u03c72 function and corresponding AIC value in the lower part of Tab.(IV). In the next step, we constraint the cosmographic parameters in the context of Pade cosmographic methods, using the datasets of sample (i) as shown in Tab.(V) and Fig.(7). In Fig.(7). we have shown 1\u03c3 to 3\u03c3 confidence levels of the cosmographic parameters q0 and j0 in the context of Pade (2,2) and Pade (3,2) approaches. We observe that the \u039bCDM value (q0 = \u22120.548, j0 = 1.0) is inside the confidence regions of cosmographic methods, meaning that there is no observational tension between standard \u039bCDM cosmology and datasets of sample (i). Quantitatively speaking, the differences between best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters of the flat-\u039bCDM model and those of the Pade (2,2) cosmographic method are 1.4\u03c3 for q0, 0.97\u03c3 for j0, 1.18\u03c3 for s0 and 4.4\u03c3 for l0. All these differences (except l0) are the statistical error of the MCMC algorithm and cannot be considered as observational tension. Our comparison between standard \u039bCDM model and Pade (3,2) cosmographic method shows 2.05\u03c3, 1.55\u03c3, 1.22\u03c3, 2.23\u03c3, and 1.3\u03c3 deviations for the cosmographic parameters q0, j0, s0, l0 and m0, respectively. Like Pade (2,2), these deviations show that there is no significant tension between \u039bCDM cosmology and Pade (3,2) method and consequently observational data in sample (i). In addition, we report the values of \u03c72min, AIC and \u2206AIC for Pade cosmographic approaches in Tab.(V). Form the statistical AIC criteria, we observe no strong evidence (|\u2206AIC| > 6) against the flat-\u039bCDM model. This result is in agreement with cosmographic analysis for both Pade (2,2) and Pade (3,2) shown in Fig.(7). In similar study, Hu and Wang [83] have shown that the Pade approximations perform well compared to other approximations. We mention that their data sample consists of low- and high-redshift SNIa and GRBs and their Pade approximation directly used for luminosity distance.\nB. Numerical results for sample (ii)\nOur constraint on the free parameter \u2126m0 of the flat\u039bCDM model using the dataset of sample (ii) including the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs and GRBs represents \u2126m0 = 0.295 \u00b1 0.012. Using this constraint and Eq.(18), we report the best-fit values of the cosmographic parameters in the context of standard model in the last column of the middle part of Tab.(IV). The statistical results are reported in the last column of the lower part. We observe that, in this case, q0 is equal to \u22120.557\u00b1 0.019, which is in 1\u03c3 confidence level of its corresponding value obtained form sample (i). This means that the q0 parameter in standard model does not change considerably due to varying the low-redshift Hubble diagrams to high-redshift data. This result is valid for higher cosmographic parameters s0, l0 and m0 (see our constraints for samples (i) and sample (ii) in Tab. IV). In the context of Pade cosmographic methods, our constraints on the cosmographic parameters using sample (ii) are reported in Tab.(VI). In addition, we show 1\u03c3 to 3\u03c3 confidence levels of q0 and j0 parameters in Fig.(8). We observe that the best-fit values of q0 and j0 parameters of Pade (2,2) cosmographic method are very close to those \u039bCDM values. In fact, using sample (ii), the best-fit values of q0 and j0 in Pade (2,2) cosmographic method respectively decreases as 11% and 42% compare to corresponding values obtained from sample (i). On the other hand, we observe 2.55\u03c3 and 1.68\u03c3 deviations between best-fit values of q0 and j0 obtained in Pade (3,2) cosmographic approach with those of the standard \u039bCDM model (see Fig.8). We mention that these deviations do not show any tension between Pade (3,2) and standard model and therefore can be assumed as statistical errors of the MCMC algorithm. Form the view point of AIC criteria, as reported in the lower part of Tab.(VI), we observe no strong evidence (|\u2206AIC| > 6) against the standard \u039bCDM model."

            "text": "Let us start with the results of the recent work [94] in which the authors showed that QSOs at redshifts lower than zmax \u223c 0.7 recover the Plank-\u039bCDM Universe (flat\u039bCDM model with \u2126m0 ' 0.3), in agreement with the predictions of the SNIa observations. By increasing the redshift range to z > 0.7, one can get the transition from the Planck-\u039bCDM Universe to the Einstein-de Sitter Universe (EdS) (spatially flat FLRW with only pressureless matter.) From the observational point of view, the QSOs and SNIa are very different objects since SNIa in the Pantheon catalogue are more populated toward low-redshifts, while the QSOs in the Risaliti-Lusso sample [81, 95] are more numerous at higher redshifts. Interestingly, using the SNIa data at z > 1, the authors of [94] have shown a substantial increase of \u2126m0 and a\n14\ndecrease in the H0 measurement at redshifts higher than zmin = 1. It is emphasized that any evolution of the H0 value is equivalent to the evolution of the absolute magnitude of SNIa, which means that we have a stark choice between a SNIa cosmology and a flat-\u039bCDM Universe. The same result with a different analysis was achieved by placing the standard flat-\u039bCDM model in the redshift bin of observational data, including observational Hubble data (OHD), SNIa and QSOs, supporting the idea of [96]. In the line of [94] and [96], we explore here the redshift evolution of \u2126m0 using the Pade cosmographic method. For this purpose, we first remove the data of SNIa and QSOs at redshifts smaller than z = 1, respectively, from the Pantheon catalogue and binned QSOs sample. We repeat our cosmographic analysis in the context of the Pade (3,2) approximation using the reduced binned sample of QSOs at redshifts z > 1 (14 data points out of all 25 data) and 23 SNIa data points out of all 1048 data points in the Pantheon catalogue. The numerical results for the cosmographic parameters q0 and s0 obtained from the SNIa sample (z > 1), binned QSOs sample (z > 1) and combined SNIa+QSOs samples (z > 1) are shown in Tab. (VII). For comparison, we then show our results obtained from all data points of SNIa and QSOs. Substituting the numerical results of q0 and s0 into Eq. (18), we obtain the best-fit value of \u2126m0 for standard model, as shown in Tab. (VII). Note that our cosmographic analysis for higher parameters l0 and m0 yields non-real solutions (complex values) of \u2126m0 from the corresponding quadratic and cubic relations in Eq. (18). Therefore, we restrict our analysis to the parameters q0 and s0 and their linear relations in Eq. (18). The \u2126m0 value resulted from q0 \u2212 \u2126m0 and s0 \u2212 \u2126m0 relations is approximately \u223c 0.5 for the restricted data samples at z > 1, as reported in the up-part of Tab. (VII). This result is in contrast to the Planck-\u039bCDM Universe and approximately in agreement with the predictions of [94, 96]. Moreover, the value of \u2126m0 \u223c 0.5 predicted by our cosmographic approach supports the result of [97], where it was shown that the higher value of \u2126m0 is likely related to the high-redshift QSOs at z \u223c 2\u22125. We repeat the above analysis for data samples consisting of all SNIa, QSOs and SNIa+QSOs data points and report our results in the down-part of Tab. (VII). We see that the extracted \u2126m0 value from\nq0 is close to the Planck-LCDM value \u2126m0 = 0.3, as expected. While there is a potential to get larger values of \u2126m0 from the cosmographic parameter s0.This result is due to this fact that s0 parameter becomes more relevant than q0 at high-redshifts. Notice that this result is obtained without restricting data samples to z > 1. Hence, any larger value of \u2126m0 extracted from s0 directly relates to this fact that s0 is more relevant at higher redshift, while q0 is more significant at low redshifts."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "The cosmographic approach is used as a modelindependent method to reconstruct the Hubble expansion of the universe. In this context, we use relevant mathematical series to reconstruct the Hubble parameter. The coefficients of this reconstruction which are related to the time derivative of the Hubble parameter (known as cosmographic parameters) can be constrained utilizing statistical methods and observational data. In other words, we can constrain the cosmographic parameters model-independently. Since the cosmographic method is a mathematical technique, it can serve as a benchmark for testing the physical models proposed in the field of cosmology. In this work, we examined the standard flat-\u039bCDM model from the viewpoint of cosmographic method using the Hubble diagrams of SNIa, QSOs, and GRBs, as well as the BAO observations. We investigated the Taylor series and rational Pade polynomials using mock data for SNIa and QSOs. We showed that in the redshifts z < 2.5, where SNIa objects were observed [88], the 4th order Taylor expansion is insufficient to reconstruct the Hubble parameter, while the 5th order Taylor series, Pade (2,2) and Pade (3,2) polynomials are acceptable approximations. At higher redshifts and in the redshift interval 0 < z < 5.5, where QSOs have been observed [98], we have shown that Pade cosmographic approaches are the useful approximations to reconstruct the Hubble function in a model-independent manner, while the 4th order Taylor series is strongly rejected. In the next step, using the low-redshift combination of the Hubble diagrams from SNIa, binned QSOs, GRBs and also the BAO measurements as well as the high-redshift com-\n15\nbination of the Hubble diagrams for SNIa, binned QSOs and GRBs, we showed that the cosmographic parameters of the standard flat-\u039bCDM model are well consistent with those of the Pade cosmographic methods. In other words, our results for both low- and high-redshift Hubble diagrams, do not show any cosmological tension between the constrained values of the cosmographic parameters in the flat-\u039bCDM model and those of the cosmographic method based on the rational Pade polynomials. This result is against the cosmographic tension presented for standard model, using the high-redshift Hubble diagrams from QSOs and GRBs in [67, 81]. In addition, from the viewpoint of statistical AIC criteria, our Pade cosmographic analysis showed no strong evidence against the standard \u039bCDM cosmology. Finally, we put the cosmo-\ngraphic method in redshift-bin of Hubble diagram data in order to explore the possibility of the variation of \u2126m0 extracted at high-redshift observations. Using the restricted data points of SNIa, QSOs and SNIa+QSOs samples at z > 1, we found larger values of \u2126m0 for standard flat-\u039bCDM model extracted from both q0 and s0 parameters. This result confirms a transition form Planck-\u039bCDM value \u2126m0 = 0.3 at low-redshift to larger values at high-redshifts [see also 94, 96]. In addition, using all data points of SNIa, QSOs and SNIa+QSOs samples, we extracted a larger value of \u2126m0 from s0 parameter, while the extracted value from q0 parameter is sufficiently close to Planck-\u039bCDM value. This result is expected because the s0 (q0) parameter is more relevant at high-(low) redshifts.\n[1] A. G. Riess et al. (Supernova Search Team), Astron. J. 116, 1009 (1998), arXiv:astro-ph/9805201.
