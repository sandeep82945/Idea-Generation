    "abstractText": "Background. Errors have seldom been evaluated in computer-aided detection on brain metastases. This study aimed to analyze false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs) generated by a brain metastasis detection system (BMDS) and by readers. Methods. A deep learning-based BMDS was developed and prospectively validated in a multicenter, multireader study. Ad hoc secondary analysis was restricted to the prospective participants (148 with 1,066 brain metastases and 152 normal controls). Three trainees and 3 experienced radiologists read the MRI images without and with the BMDS. The number of FNs and FPs per patient, jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit (FOM), and lesion features associated with FNs were analyzed for the BMDS and readers using binary logistic regression. Results. The FNs, FPs, and the FOM of the stand-alone BMDS were 0.49, 0.38, and 0.97, respectively. Compared with independent reading, BMDS-assisted reading generated 79% fewer FNs (1.98 vs 0.42, P < .001); 41% more FPs (0.17 vs 0.24, P < .001) but 125% more FPs for trainees (P < .001); and higher FOM (0.87 vs 0.98, P < .001). Lesions with small size, greater number, irregular shape, lower signal intensity, and located on nonbrain surface were associated with FNs for readers. Small, irregular, and necrotic lesions were more frequently found in FNs for BMDS. The FPs mainly resulted from small blood vessels for the BMDS and the readers. Conclusions. Despite the improvement in detection performance, attention should be paid to FPs and small lesions with lower enhancement for radiologists, especially for less-experienced radiologists. applyparastyle \"fig//caption/p[1]\" parastyle \"FigCapt\" applyparastyle \"fig\" parastyle \"Figure\" This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Analysis of false negatives and false positives N eu oO n clog y Key Points \u2022 The blood vessels are the main cause of false positives (FPs) for artificial intelligence (AI). \u2022 AI assistance increases detection of FPs for less-experienced readers. \u2022 Small lesions with low enhancement are easily missed by both readers and AI. Various computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms for brain metastasis (BM) detection have been proposed over the past decade for potential applications in clinical practice.1\u201311 In particular, deep learning-based neural networks are increasingly being used to automatically learn representative features from raw medical images.4\u201311 While deep learning has shown substantial progress in the automated detection of BMs, the vast majority of studies have focused on the stand-alone performance of the systems in internal retrospective testing in a research setting, instead of validating the system using additional external, larger, and more heterogeneous datasets.1\u20139 Thus, it is not possible to determine the significance of the results of previous studies in the clinical realm. One major challenge to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is the development of user-centric workflow integration. Studies assessing the efficiency and generality of CAD tools for BM detection within a radiology workflow are extremely limited. In a retrospective study,12 4 reviewers using a CAD system as a second reader improved the figure of merit (FOM) from 0.874 to 0.898 (P < .01) but took 40% longer to review the images. Another multireader study demonstrated that CAD-assisted physicians achieve a higher sensitivity for lesion detection than unassisted physicians (91.3% vs 82.6%, P = .030).13 Although detection sensitivity has been shown to improve for readers as they use these systems, the errors, for example, false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs), resulting from these systems have been given insufficient analysis. To understand the potential clinical capability of a CAD system for BM detection and investigate its effect on practitioners, we conducted a prospective multicenter, multireader study of a BM detection system (BMDS). As we previously showed an increase in sensitivity and decrease in reviewing time for readers assisted by this system,11 in this study, we performed a quantitative analysis, focusing on the FN and FP outcomes of this tool for readers with versus readers without CAD assistance. Further, we analyzed the associations between lesion characteristics and FNs. Materials and Methods Study Design and Participants A detailed description of this prospective, multicenter, multireader study has been presented elsewhere.11 This ad hoc secondary analysis was restricted to participants in the multireader evaluation (Table 1). Briefly, the reading study prospectively included 148 patients (male:female, 1.3:1; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), 51 \u00b1 11 years; age range, 22\u201378  years) with newly diagnosed BMs (with no more than 50 lesions) and 152 control patients (male:female, 1:1; mean age \u00b1 SD, 56  years \u00b115; age range, 21\u201373  years) with an extracranial primary tumor, but without evidence of BM, recruited from February 1 to May 23, 2021. All patients underwent three-dimensional (3D)-enhanced brain MRI. One thousand and sixty-six BMs were identified, with a mean size of 7.1 \u00b1 6.0 mm (range: 1.8\u201359.7  mm), a mean number of 7  \u00b1  7.6 (range: 1\u201348) per patient, and a median of 4.  Of these lesions, 83.3% (888/1,066) had a diameter \u226410 mm. In multireader experiment, 9 radiologists with varying degrees of experience (trainee [<3  years], experienced [5\u201310 years], and expert [>10 years]) were recruited from Importance of the Study Despite encouraging results on brain metastasis detection, the false-negative and false-positive results from the artificial intelligence (AI) system and the radiologists, with and without the use of AI, have never been fully described or not addressed. We performed a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, multicenter, multireader study on a deep learning brain metastasis detection system. Our previous study has shown that radiologists improve detection performance with the use of AI. Thus, in this study, we focused on the false-negative and false-positive outcomes generated by the AI system and by observers; lesion-based performance; and the characteristics of missed lesions. Our study contributes to a more complete understanding of the behavior of both the AI system and radiologists. Moreover, we present issues that require attention from radiologists in the application of this system. This analysis enables further model development and facilitates radiologists\u2019 usage.

Briefly, the reading study prospectively included 148 patients (male:female, 1.3:1; mean age \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), 51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0years; age range, 22\u201378\u00a0 years) with newly diagnosed BMs (with no more than 50 lesions) and 152 control patients (male:female, 1:1; mean age \u00b1 SD, 56\u00a0 years \u00b115; age range, 21\u201373\u00a0 years) with an extracranial primary tumor, but without evidence of BM, recruited from February 1 to May 23, 2021. All patients underwent three-dimensional (3D)-enhanced brain MRI. One thousand and sixty-six BMs were identified, with a mean size of 7.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0mm (range: 1.8\u201359.7\u00a0 mm), a mean number of 7\u00a0 \u00b1\u00a0 7.6 (range: 1\u201348) per patient, and a median of 4.\u00a0 Of these lesions, 83.3% (888/1,066) had a diameter \u226410\u00a0mm.\nIn multireader experiment, 9 radiologists with varying degrees of experience (trainee [<3\u00a0 years], experienced [5\u201310\u00a0years], and expert [>10\u00a0years]) were recruited from\nImportance of the Study\nDespite encouraging results on brain metastasis detection, the false-negative and false-positive results from the artificial intelligence (AI) system and the radiologists, with and without the use of AI, have never been fully described or not addressed. We performed a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, multicenter, multireader study on a deep learning brain metastasis detection system. Our previous study has shown that radiologists improve detection performance with the use of AI. Thus, in this study, we focused on the false-negative and false-positive outcomes generated by the AI system and by observers; lesion-based performance; and the characteristics of missed lesions. Our study contributes to a more complete understanding of the behavior of both the AI system and radiologists. Moreover, we present issues that require attention from radiologists in the application of this system. This analysis enables further model development and facilitates radiologists\u2019 usage.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /neuro-oncology/article/25/3/544/6658946 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n546 Luo et\u00a0al.

In the second mode, the same data were presented again in a random order, and the readers used the BMDS at the beginning of the assessment.\nThe main study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions (No. B2021-198-01), and informed consent was obtained from the patients prospectively.\nGround\u00a0Truth\nThe ground truth was established by 3experts (with 30, 28, and 11\u00a0years of experience) from 3 institutions. The experts independently read each case and confirmed the lesions in consensus. The follow-up brain MRI images will be reviewed to identify whether the suspected lesions were real metastases or not if there were divergences.\nThe lesion characteristics, including the number, size, shape, location, relative signal intensity, and the presence of necrosis, were confirmed by 2 radiologists with 12 and 9\u00a0 years of experience and recorded for correlation analysis with the FN results. The lesion size was defined as the largest diameter on the axial image. The shape was classified as regular (round or oval with a smooth margin) or irregular (not meeting the definition of a regular shape). The minimum distance between metastasis and the brain surface was calculated, and the metastases with a distance of \u22641\u00a0mm were defined as brain surface lesions. The relative signal intensity was defined as the ratio of the lesion intensity to the lateral pterygoid muscle intensity within the same patient. Necrosis was categorized as no necrosis, <50% of the lesion volume, or >50% of the lesion volume."

Analysis of false negatives and false positives\nThe BMDS was integrated into our routine Picture Archiving and Communication System in May 2021. The entire computation is performed once the patient finishes the MRI scan, unlike conventional workstations in which radiologists are required to trigger the computation. The system was directly connected to all MRI scanners that perform brain scanning. Once a patient scan is finished, the scanner automatically sends data in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format to the BMDS system for computation. When radiologists open the system, they do not need to wait for computation, as the BMDS results have already been computed and are immediately available for the radiologists. However, in the multireader study, an abbreviated version of the BMDS was installed on personal computers, instead of being integrated into the workstation. In the preprocessing step, the DICOM files were read and stacked to form a volumetric data format. Here, we used the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative file format to store the volumetric data for reading. No other preprocessing steps were used.\nStatistical Analysis\nFor BMDS, the numbers of FPs and FNs and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated on a per-patient basis. The lesion-based detection performance was evaluated using the FOM value from jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis (RJAFROC: Analysis of Data Acquired Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Paradigm and Its Extensions; R package). In JAFROC analysis,15 each case is attributed equal importance, regardless of the number of lesions. Therefore, we selected weighted (w) AFROC analysis, which ensures that each disease case exerts equal importance, rather than AFROC, in which a case with more lesions has greater influence. We assigned equal weights to all lesions in a case. In addition, we used a 1-treatment random-reader random-case analysis model, in which BMDS was regarded as an additional reader, to establish the wAFROC model for the BMDS. For readers in the 2 reading sessions, the number of patientbased FPs and FNs were calculated and compared using Wilcoxon\u2019s signed-rank test. We used a 2-treatment randomreader random-case analysis model to construct wAFROC curves in consideration of our fully crossed reading design. The wAFROC-FOMs of the readers were calculated and compared using the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz-Hillis method of significance testing between the 2 reading modes. The correlations between lesion features and FN number were assessed using binary logistic regression for the BMDS and the readers. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) or R package 4.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and were 2-sided, with a significance level of 0.05.\nby assisted readers than unassisted readers (with vs without the BMDS, 0.24 v.\u00a00.17; P < .001), This trend was maintained for trainees, who showed an increase of 0.15 FPs (with vs without the BMDS, 0.27 vs 0.12; P < .001). However, there was a slight decrease of 0.01 FPs (with vs without the BMDS, 0.20 vs 0.21; P < .035) for experienced readers. At the individual reader level, using the BMDS resulted in a significant increase of 0.12\u20130.18 FPs for the trainees and 1 experienced reader, whereas the number of FPs decreased slightly but not significantly for the other 2 experienced readers. Furthermore, most (82.5%) of the FPs for readers using the BMDS were attributed to the BMDS, meaning that the FPs were generated by the BMDS and not rejected by the readers when they were supported by BMDS (displayed as \u201cBMDS Contribution\u201d under the \u201cPer-Patient False Positives\u201d column in Table 2). In a subgroup analysis (Supplementary Table 1), more FPs were observed in BM patients than control subjects, with or without the BMDS (without: BM patients vs controls, 0.25 vs 0.08, P < .001; with BMDS: BM patients vs control, 0.39 vs 0.09, P <\u00a0.001).\nThe mean number of FNs per patient significantly decreased from 1.98 to 0.42 for readers assisted by the BMDS, representing a 78.3% decrease. With the support of BMDS, readers improved detection sensitivity, and 85.2% of the more identified lesions were detected by BMDS (displayed as \u201cBMDS Contribution\u201d in the \u201cPer-Patient False Negatives\u201d column in Table 2). There were significant reductions in the number of FNs in the assisted mode for both the trainees and experienced readers (with vs without the BMDS, 0.39 vs 2.14, P < .001; with vs without the BMDS, 0.45 vs 1.82, P < .001, respectively). Similarly, this decrease in the number of FNs was mainly due to more identifications by the BMDS, which contributed to 86.3% and 84.0% of the lesions omitted by trainees and experienced radiologists, respectively.\nBy using BMDS, the pooled FOM value improved from 0.87 to 0.98 (increment, 0.11; P < .001; Figure 1A), with an increase of 0.12 (0.86 vs 0.98, P < .001) for trainees and an increase of 0.10 (0.87 vs 0.97, P < .001; Figure 1B) for experienced radiologists. Meanwhile, FOM values were similar between assisted reading and the BMDS alone (0.98 vs 0.97, P > .05; Figure 1A). For the individual reader, the FOM values improved from 0.84\u20130.89 to 0.97\u20130.98. The detailed results for each reader are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1C and D."

            "text": "We conducted a secondary analysis of FP and FN results of a multicenter, multireader CAD study on BM detection. In this study, the numbers of FPs and FNs per patient with the BMDS were lower than in previous studies. For BMDSassisted reading, the number of FPs increased by 41% (0.07 vs 0.17, P < .001) but the number of FNs decreased significantly by 79% (1.55/1.98, P < .001), compared with unassisted reading. Thus, the overall lesion-based detection performance of the readers significantly improved with use of the BMDS (FOM value increase, 0.11, P < .001). Moreover, both the increase in the number of FPs and the decrease in the number of FNs for assisted readers were mostly attributable to the BMDS. We further analyzed all of the images and found that blood vessels were mostly\nmisidentified as BMs, resulting in FPs for the BMDS and the readers. Although the lesion characteristics associated with FN outcomes for the BMDS and the readers were somewhat different, the most important characteristic for both was a smaller lesion\u00a0size.\nResearch on CAD systems for detecting BMs has focused on measuring the stand-alone performance of CAD algorithms.1\u201310 However, in the clinic, CAD is never used alone; rather, it is always used in conjunction with radiologists. Therefore, research interest has focused on the incremental improvements afforded by CAD, including studies assessing observer performance.11\u201313 The consistent conclusion from these observer studies is that CAD improves the detection sensitivity of observers by 4.3%\u2013 21.0%.11\u201313 The study by Yin, et\u00a0 al. showed a 40% reduction in reading time when CAD was used as a concurrent reader,11 whereas Sunwoo, et\u00a0al. reported that the time increased by 40% when CAD was used as a second reader.12 The major difference between this study and previous observational studies is that we focused on FNs and FPs for CAD and for radiologists, which have not been thoroughly quantitatively analyzed in previous studies. Moreover, we analyzed the MRI characteristics associated with FP and FN outcomes. Improved observer detection sensitivity and reduced reading time have been reported for readers assisted by a BM CAD system. However, there have been concerns about the CAD system\u2019s effects on readers\u2019 FPs,\nCBA D\nI\nF\nG H\nE\nJ\nK L M N O P\nFig. 3 Examples of false positives and false negatives.

Vessels in G and H were incorrectly reported as nodules by the readers, especially the trainees. Similar to D, an experienced reader mistakenly reported a lesion in I\u00a0due to a slightly hyperintense region. An infarction in J was wrongly judged as a metastasis by 2 trainee readers. A\u00a06\u00a0mm metastasis with a necrotic core in K was missed by the BMDS. The BDMS also failed to detect a 10\u00a0mm lesion located near the brain\u2013skull interface in L, with an irregular shape and indistinct margin. Both of these lesions were detected by all readers. A\u00a0small lesion (2\u20133\u00a0mm, M\u2013P) adjacent to the brain\u2019s exterior surface or near to the blood vessels was also easily missed by both the BMDS and the readers. Nodules in M and N were missed by the BMDS, but detected by some of the readers. On the contrary, a small lesion in O was overlooked by all readers but detected by the BMDS. A\u00a03\u00a0mm lesion in P was missed by the BMDS and all of the readers.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /neuro-oncology/article/25/3/544/6658946 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n554 Luo et\u00a0al. Analysis of false negatives and false positives\nand further, how to decrease the number of lesions overlooked by the CAD system and the readers. Our study provides guidance for the improvement of BM CAD algorithms and issues that need to be addressed by readers when using CAD systems.\nIn clinical applications, radiologists are required to confirm whether markers presented by detection systems are true or false. FPs can occur for a variety of reasons (Table 3) but are most commonly (51.0%\u201394.5%) caused by blood vessels,1,3,4,7,9\u201311 such as the dural venous sinuses,1,3,10 internal carotid artery,1,3 choroid plexus,6,8 small or peripheral vessels,4,11 and developmental venous anomalies.7,8 Other causes, such as enhanced meninges,7,11 variations in brain tissue contrast,6,8 pineal bodies,10 and extracranial tissues,9 have also been reported. Our results were largely consistent with those of previous studies and revealed that vessels, mostly peripheral brain vessels or diploic vessels, were the main contributors (~80%) to FPs. As reported by Park, et\u00a0al.,7 the BMDS misidentified enhanced dura mater as metastases (9.6%, 11/115). Moreover, mimic lesions with slight enhancement or a slightly higher signal (Figure 3D, 6.9% [8/115]) were found in FPs generated by the BMDS. We speculate that those FPs may be small vessels or artifacts. Occasionally, pineal bodies were detected as lesions (Figure 3F). In contrast to the findings from previous studies,2,9 some infarctions that manifested as regions with a necrotic core were misclassified as BMs. This was found in 3.5% (4/115) and 13% (55/424, Figure 3J) of the FPs for the BMDS and readers, respectively, particularly in cases with multiple lesions. We calculated the average number of FPs per case in the BMDS only, readers only, and readers with BMDS groups as 0.38, 0.17, and 0.24, respectively. This result indicated that more FPs were generated by our model than by the readers. In addition, although a significant proportion of the FPs produced by the BMDS was rejected by the readers (ranging from 40% [46/115] to 83% [95/115] for individual readers), BMDS-assisted readers also had an increased number of FPs, compared with unassisted readers, especially the trainees. Much of this increase (73%\u201390% for individual readers) was attributed to the FPs induced by the BMDS, rather than misidentification by the readers (Table 3). Almost all of the additional FPs were peripheral vessels manifesting as small, blurry areas with a slightly higher signal than the surrounding area (Figure 3D, H).\nThe basic task of such a detection system is to identify the lesion or person that requires further evaluation due to the risk of having a BM. The BMDS missed 73 lesions in 32 patients, resulting in a mean of 0.49 (73/148) FNs per patient, which was significantly lower than the number of FNs for unassisted readers. Nonetheless, the BMDS achieved a perfect patient-based NPV of 100%; thus, it is expected to accurately identify normal cases that do not need to be read by a radiologist. This preselection would increase the efficiency of screening for BMs. The most striking characteristics of the FN lesions were their small size, necrotic core (resembling a halo with ring-enhancement), indistinct margin, and low contrast enhancement (Figure 3K, L). These image features were included in a multivariate analysis (Figure 2). Our findings strongly suggest that a small size and low intensity are the dominant factors contributing to FNs, as also shown in previous studies.3\u20135,16\u201318 Several studies have also shown that lesions on the brain\nsurface, the edge of the brain, or the gray matter\u2013white matter boundary may be missed by CAD systems.2,5,9 In our analysis, lesion location (brain surface or not) did not affect the FN of our model. Whereas, nonbrain surface lesions were more likely to be missed by unassisted readers, accounting for about 90% of all missed lesions.. The potential explanation is that the small lesions located near the gray matter\u2013white matter interfaces or within the white matter have a lower-contrast ratio in GRE images, thus, they become less conspicuous and are difficult to be recognized. Readers also missed more BMs in patients with multiple lesions. Fortunately, this could be overcome by using the BMDS, because lesion number and location did not affect the detection of BMDS. In addition, similar to the BMDS, it was not surprising that lesions that were smaller and/or had lower signal intensity were also likely to be overlooked by human readers (Figure 3N\u2013P).\nAs indicated by the findings described above, readers and AI are complementary. The BMDS had a high-detection sensitivity of 89% for small BMs (\u22643\u00a0mm) which are likely to be missed by radiologists, higher than the reported highest sensitivity of 82.4%,7 and markedly superior to the pooled sensitivity of 27% (244/906) obtained by 6 radiologists in our study. AI helped increase the radiologists\u2019 detection rate, demonstrating a 79% reduction in FNs in our analysis. Moreover, radiologists may reduce the FPs generated by AI. JAFROC analysis showed that readers assisted by the BMDS acquired higher FOM values than either the BMDS or the reader alone. The results of this study also imply that readers should not rely too heavily on the CAD. The BMDS had a sensitivity of 93.2%, while readers assisted by the BMDS had a sensitivity of 94%, indicating that the readers may have had little contribution to BM detection. In addition, FPs should be taken seriously, especially for trainees, as there was a 125% increase in FPs when they used the\u00a0BMDS.\nOur study had several limitations. First, compared with a randomized crossover study,13 the improvements in observer performance may have resulted from reading order bias in this sequential reading design.19 For the comparison of reader performance with and without AI assistance, the experiment with AI support occurred second. The readers may have remembered the locations of the BMs they marked during unassisted reading. To address this issue, we included a memory wash-out period between the first and second reads. In addition, the cases were presented in a random order for the second reading. Therefore, the 2 experiments (with and without AI assistance) may be regarded as independent, minimizing the recall bias. It was also used in other AI-aided studies, such as in breast20 and in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.21 Second, almost all of the images included in current model are based on 3D GRE. These sequences have a lower-contrast ratio for metastasis on bright white matter and their \u201cbright blood\u201d contrast also make normal cortical vessels much more prominent than with spin echo-based pulse sequences. Thus, small lesions located the white matter may be missed and the small cortical vessels can be confused with small lesions. Third, although the BMDS achieved a perfect NPV in the multicenter evaluation, we did not determine whether it could be used for preselection. Fourth, the clinical characteristics associated with FN outcomes were not analyzed.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /neuro-oncology/article/25/3/544/6658946 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n555Luo et\u00a0al. Analysis of false negatives and false positives N\neu ro-\nO n colog y We considered that the MRI findings were more important for radiologists to detect BMs. Finally, we performed a quantitative description for FPs, instead of correlation analysis.\nIn the future, we would like to improve our study from the following aspects. First, to reduce the FPs of blood vessels, we would like to develop algorithms to suppress vessels on contrast-enhanced images. Similar idea had been proposed for CT lung nodule detection.22 Image segmentation methods can be used to extract intracranial blood vessels and suppress/remove them from the brain parenchyma. Then, deep learning models, for example, BMDS, can be applied on vessel-free MRI images. This could be quite effective in reducing FPs on vessels. Second, to reduce the FNs of BMDS, we would like to collect more difficult cases as additional training data to improve BMDS. This study showed that several variables, as shown in multivariate analysis, were significantly associated with more FNs. As deep learning systems are data-driven, adding those bad-performed cases to re-train the model could lead to better detection performance. Third, our team is working on multiple sequence models that constructed using postcontrast 3D FSE T1-weighted imaging with or without black blood imaging, postcontrast T1-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequence, and combination of these sequences, respectively. Further, the detection performances, FPs, and FNs among the models will be compared and discussed."

Moreover, radiologists are supposed to be conscious of the characteristics associated with FN outcomes when reading with CAD assistance."
