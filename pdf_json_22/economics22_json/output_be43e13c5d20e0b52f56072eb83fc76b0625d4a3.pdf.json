    "abstractText": "To study the intelligent and e\u0086cient stock portfolio in China\u2019s \u0089nancial market, based on the relevant theories such as deep learning (DL) neural network (NN) and stock portfolio, this study selects 111 stable stocks from the constituent stocks of the China Security Index (CSI) 300 from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, as the research samples. \u00aden, it analyzes these research samples and imports the relevant data of 111 stocks into the DLNNmodel.\u00ade corresponding prediction results of stock prices are obtained. Finally, the stock portfolio model based on DL NN is compared with the data results of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 50 Index and CSI 500 Index.\u00ade results show that the closing prices of the selected 111 stocks are relatively stable and \u009auctuate up and down around the horizontal axis, and the positive and negative returns are relatively balanced, roughly between \u22125% and 5%. \u00adere is a phenomenon of \u009auctuation aggregation to a certain extent. Comparing the prediction results of di\u009cerent models reveals that the prediction results of model c are closest to the actual stock price trend. Comparing the relevant returns of the proposed stock portfolio with other stocks uncovers that the annualized return of the stock portfolio based on the DL NN model is 47.44%. \u00ade sharp ratio is 1.52, the maximum pullback is 18.15%, the monthly excess return is 3.11%, and the information ratio is 0.82. Compared with other indexes, the proposed stock portfolio shows the best results. \u00aderefore, the proposal of the stock portfolio based on DL NN provides a theoretical basis for the development of the \u0089nancial \u0089eld in the future.",

With the fast-forwarding socioeconomic level and the gradual opening of the nancial market, more and more opportunities have been brought to investors [1, 2]. erefore, how to maximize the return on investment (ROI) is one of the key issues that every investor or enterprise pays attention to for a long time. A stock portfolio is a collection of stocks, bonds, and - nancial derivatives held by investors or nancial institutions, aiming to spread the risk. A portfolio can be seen as a combination at several levels. e rst level is the combination of risk assets and risk-free assets due to the dual needs of safety and pro tability. e second level is to consider how to combine risky assets. e stock portfolio based on\ndeep learning (DL) neural network (NN) shows the advantage of a relatively high ROI rate in the nancial market. Accordingly, this study will deeply analyze the stock portfolio using DL NN [3].\nDe la Torre-Torres et al. put forward the capital asset pricing model, which held that the relationship between the expected return of assets and asset risk was linear.e capital asset pricing model was simple and clear but had obvious limitations.emodel\u2019s assumptions were di cult to realize in real life [4]. Mussa and Ismail analyzed theoretical formulations and solutions used in portfolio selections, discussing the construction of portfolio models and the corresponding extension problems. Years of research and development have accumulated a large amount of research data in the portfolio investment eld. It is less feasible to process and calculate the data by relying on traditional data\nHindawi Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2022, Article ID 7957097, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7957097\nanalysis methods. -erefore, experts and scholars have gradually started to use DL to conduct investment portfolio research [5]. Ping and Hao used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based model to solve the dynamic portfolio optimization problem. Dynamic portfolio optimization allocated funds to a series of assets in sequence according to the investor\u2019s return and risk status during continuous trading cycles. -ey simulated trading with realistic constraints using real financial market historical data and demonstrated that the proposed model achieved higher returns than previous benchmark trading strategies and model-free DRL models [6]. Mensi et al. constructed a portfolio optimization model based on DRL and improved the traditional mean-variance model. -ey found that the new model performed well in risk prediction and control through model backtesting, proving that the model had a certain practical value [7].\nTo sum up, based on DL NN, this study takes 111 stable stocks in Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SHZ) from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, as the research object. -en, it makes an in-depth analysis and adds these stocks to the DLNNmodel to predict the stock price trend. Finally, the stock trends of the SSE 50 Index and Chinese Security Index (CSI) 500 are compared with them, and the result of the stock portfolio based on DL NN is the best.-is study aimed to provide a methodological reference for future research on constructing stock portfolio. -e organizational structure of this study is shown in Figure 1."

DL stems frommachine learning (ML) as a new research direction.ML studies how computers simulate or realize the learning behavior of animals to learn new knowledge or skills, rewrite the existing data structure, and then improve the program performance. Obviously, DL is strongly related to NN inML. In turn, NN is also DL\u2019s main algorithm and implementation means. It is fair to say that DL is an improved NN algorithm [8\u201310]. -e theoretical model of DL is shown in Figure 2.\n-e calculation basis of the DL algorithm is to observe the decline degree of the error function of the NN and then correct the weight and deviation of the neuron layer accordingly [11]. -e specific calculation method reads the following:\nQa+1 \ufffd Qa \u2212 cada.

FN stands for the number of incorrectly classified negative cases. Lastly, N indicates the total number.\nAnalyzing the research content of DL unveils mainly three different methods.\n(1) -e NN system based on convolution operation is the CNN model with convolution calculation. It calculates the feedforward NN with a depth-wise structure. CNN structures four layers: input, convolution, pooling, and full connection, and is one of the representative algorithms of DL [15, 16]. Figure 3 details the CNN architecture.\nRt \ufffd I Bt bt\u22121, xt  + Pf , (11)\nYt \ufffd I AI \u00b7 bt\u22121, xt  + PI( .

Yt stands for input gate. Lastly, Pf and PI are the activation function (AF) of forget gate and input gate, respectively. DL is also applied in the field of stock portfolio, such as stock price prediction. -e simplest method is to use the autoregressive model, as counted by the following equation:\nXt \ufffd c +  P\ni\ufffd1 \u03d5iXt\u2212i + \u03b5t. (13)\nIn equation (13), Xt represents the stock price series.

According to equation (13), linear regression can be used for verification, and its mathematical model is transformed into the following equations:\nXt \ufffd f \u03a6 \u2192T X \u2192 t,P + c , (14)\nX \u2192\nt,P \ufffd Xt\u2212 1, Xt\u2212 2, . . . , Xt\u2212 P(  T . (15)\nIn equations (14) and (15), T represents the transposition of various equations. X \u2192 is the linear regression of stock price series. f means an inverse function, and the remaining letters share the same meaning as in the above equations.\n(2) Self-coding NNs based on multilayer neurons include auto-encoder and sparse coding, which have recently attracted extensive attention [17, 18]. -e self-encoder is a kind of artificial neural network used in semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.\nIt can characterize and learn the input information. -e self-encoder represents the learning algorithm in a general sense and is applied to dimensionality reduction and outlier detection. -e self-encoder constructed with a convolution layer can be applied to computer vision problems, including image noise reduction and neural style migration, as explained in Figure 4.\n(3) -e deep belief network (DBN) is pretrained through multilayer self-coding NN and then combined with identification information to optimize NN\u2019s weights. -e model can be used for both unsupervised learning and supervised learning [19, 20]. DBN is a probability generation model. Compared with the neural network of the traditional discrimination model, the generation model establishes a joint distribution between observation data and labels. -e whole neural network can generate training data according to the maximum probability by training the weights between its neurons. DBN can identify features, classify data, and generate data. DBN algorithm is an efficient learning algorithmwith a wide range of applications and strong expansibility. It can be applied to handwritten word recognition, speech\nrecognition, and image processing in ML, as detailed in Figure 5.\n-e specific calculationmethod is presented in equations (11) and (12).\n-e parameter setting of the DL NN model is listed in Table 1.\n2.2. StockPortfolio. An investment portfolio is a collection of stocks, bonds, and financial derivatives held by investors or financial institutions to spread the risk. A portfolio can be seen as a financial asset combination at several levels. In the first level, the combination of risk assets and risk-free assets is considered due to the dual needs of safety and profitability. Risk-free assets need to be combined for safety, and risk assets need to be combined for profitability. -e second level of a portfolio is to consider combining risk assets. Two asset portfolios with poor or negative correlation can be combined to yield a greater risk return than individual assets. -us, the portfolio combination helps keep the portfolio\u2019s efficient frontier away from risks [21\u201323].\n-e relevant theories about portfolios are as follows. (1) Nonquantitative portfolio strategy: the core idea of this strategy is \u201cdo not put eggs in the same basket.\u201d -e most common classifications are fundamental analysis and technical analysis [24]. Fundamental analysis analyzes the current situation of the stock from the aspects of the economic cycle, industry, and company texture and judges its fundamental texture to make investment strategies [25]. Technical analysis refers to producing technical indicators through standard charts or constructed signal data in the capital market. Differently put, technical analysis is based on the assumption that \u201chistory can repeat itself\u201d to predict market behavior. -en, it adopts specific strategies after the emergence of some specific index characteristics. -e K-line chart analysis method is most commonly used [26]. Both methods also have some limitations. -e fundamental analysis method may judge the future direction of the stock price. However, it cannot make a specific quantitative judgment, thus adding a great opportunity cost in a complex environment [27]. -e technical analysis method signals the operator to judge whether and how to operate. However, it is too dependent on the subjective consciousness and experience of the operator and lacks objectivity [28]. (2) Quantitative portfolio strategy makes certain assumptions before implementation [29, 30]. First, investors are rational. Second, investors only rely on the game\u2019s mean and variance rather than external information; finally, investors are in the same single investment period [31\u201333]. -e calculation of the mean-variance model reads the following:\nmin \u03b42 rp  \ufffd   wiwjcov rirj , (16)\nE rp  \ufffd E wiri( . (17)\nIn equations (16) and (17), rp represents the overall PR. ri indicates the income of the ith asset. wi stands for the weight of the ith asset. \u03b42(rp) means the variance of the PR, namely the overall risk of the portfolio. cov(rirj) signifies\nthe covariance of the ith asset and the jth asset. -en, the calculation of the expected PR of a single security or portfolio reads the following:\nri \ufffd rf + \u03b2i \u2217 rm \u2212 rf , (18)\nIn equation (18), rf is the risk-free return rate. \u03b2i is the \u03b2 coefficient of the ith portfolio. rm indicates the expected return rate of the overall market. rm \u2212 rf stands for market premium.\nSome emergencies can also lead to the stock market\u2019s collapse, such as war and economic crisis. In particular, value at risk (VaR) canmeasure the changes in asset prices in extreme cases. -e specific calculation reads the following:\nRiskt \ufffd yt \u2212 \u03bc(  \u2212 1 yt \u2212 \u03bc( \u2032 \u2208 R, (19)\nIn equation (19), yt \u2208 R represents the stock return at the current time. \u03bc \u2208 R means the average historical returns.  (yt \u2212 \u03bc)\u2032 \u2208 R indicates the covariance of historical returns. \u03bc is the coefficient of price change. -en, to create a stable and profitable portfolio investment strategy, a sharp ratio (SR) needs to be used, and its specific calculation is given as follows:\nM \ufffd rp \u2212 rf\n\u03c3p . (20)\nIn equation (20), M represents the SR. r represents the expected PR. rf means the risk-free interest rate. \u03c3p refers to the portfolio standard deviation."

Based on the above three principles, the selected sample data have reference value and are helpful to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model.\n(2) Selection of Research Objects. In this study, the constituent stocks of the CSI 300 Index after preliminary screening are used as research samples, and the time interval is all stock trading days between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021.

Stock Portfolio Analysis Based on Deep Learning (DL) Neural Network (NN). Subsequently, to study the construction of the stock portfolio from different angles, this section inputs the relevant data of 111 stocks into the DLNN model to predict stock closing price. -e specific situation is counted in Figure 10.\n-e difference between the three models is that the stock data of model a are not processed by an algorithm, the stock data of model b are added with other transaction information and standardized, and the stock data of model c are dimensionally reduced on the basis of model b. From Figure 10, the closing price of stocks is predicted by model a, model b, and model c, respectively. -e comparison reveals the fitness of different models\u2019 predicted and actual stock closing prices.

Moreover, with the increase in input variables in the DL NNmodel, the final prediction results have been improved.\n-en, mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are calculated according to the predicted stock closing price.
