"The first management implication derived from the research is that winery managers should join the wine routes where their wineries are located, since wine tourism activity under a wine route can provide several advantages, such as increased wine sales in the winery itself, improved reputation, and diversification of activities. For its part, the tourism observatory of the Wine Routes of Spain should provide constant information to the market on the characteristics of its wine tourism offer, encouraging activities to increase the notoriety of the collective brands it represents. In the same way, the results of the research can serve as a guide for managers to make investments through acquisitions and/or own investments in wineries located on the routes with a greater economic impact."

"Despite the contributions made, it is also possible to establish certain limitations of the work. In this sense, it should be noted that the research addresses the economic impact derived from visits to wineries and museums, so that the total impact of wine tourism in the destinations that make up the routes would be greater if other concepts such as accommodation, restaurants or activity companies were considered. In addition, the information used comes from the OTVE may affect the magnitudes obtained, given that historically there has been a tendency to underestimate the number of wine tourists because not all visitors to wineries and museums have been included."
