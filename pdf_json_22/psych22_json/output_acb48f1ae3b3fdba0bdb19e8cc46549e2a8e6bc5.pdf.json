    "abstractText": "Introduction Although prevalence of smoking in the USA has been decreasing for decades, smoking rates among low-income individuals remain elevated. Theories from behavioral economics and prior research suggest that financial stress may contribute to the difficulty that low-income smokers face in quitting. The present work is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial that incorporated financial coaching and social services referrals into smoking cessation treatment. Primary analyses showed that participants randomized to the intervention (N = 208) were significantly more likely not to smoke, to have lower financial stress, and to be able to afford leisure activities (p < .05) than were control participants (N = 202). Methods This paper investigates subgroup discrepancies in attendance of intervention sessions and in uptake of various components of this intervention through exploratory analysis. Results Analysis using logistic regression indicated that decreased age, not having received higher education, and having income less than $1000 per month were predictive of decreased counseling attendance (p < .05). Few demographic factors were predictive of uptake of counseling components among those who attended counseling. Conclusions These results can guide future efforts to increase participant engagement in the intervention. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03187730.",

            "text": "The US Surgeon General first identified smoking as a public health hazard nearly 60\u00a0years ago (Brawley et\u00a0al., 2014). Since that announcement, prevalence of smoking has decreased by nearly 30% (Gallup, 2018). But smoking rates of low-income individuals remain elevated (Bock et\u00a0al., 2014). Today, among people 18\u00a0years and older, those living below the poverty line are twice as likely to smoke as those living at or above 200% of the poverty line (CDCTobaccoFree, 2019). Some of the incomerelated tobacco use disparity may be due to differential access to treatment (Koma et\u00a0al., 2017; Lazar & Davenport, 2018). However, although several interventions have proven effective in the short-term, even clinically efficacious interventions tend\nto fail to successfully foster long-term abstinence among lowincome people who smoke (Bull et\u00a0al., 2014).\nHaving low income is an indicator of a more complex issue: poor financial health. Financial health is a key social determinant of health defined as one\u2019s ability to manage expenses, afford needs, minimize and recover from financial shocks, minimize debt, and build wealth (Weida et\u00a0al., 2020). Poor financial health is consistently associated with poor physical health and well-being in the USA and is one of the greatest sources of chronic stress among adults in the USA (Bethune, 2015). In people with low incomes, stress in general (Cambron et\u00a0al., 2019), and financial stress in particular (Kendzor et\u00a0al., 2010) are significant barriers to achieving long-term smoking cessation. Moreover, behavioral economics research suggests that economic deprivation induces people to focus on their immediate needs for survival, leaving them depleted of the emotional and cognitive resources needed to resist immediate gratification and prioritize delayed goals, such as quitting smoking (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013; Vohs & Faber, 2007). Clinical and public health interventions related to financial hardship often focus on a single issue, such as food insecurity or access to care, * Jacob Tempchin jtempchin@gradcenter.cuny.edu 1 Center for\u00a0Alcohol and\u00a0Addiction Studies, Brown University School of\u00a0Public Health, Providence, USA 2 Department of\u00a0Population Health, New York University School of\u00a0Medicine, New\u00a0York\u00a0City, USA\n1 3\nrather than targeting individuals\u2019 overall financial health. Financial incentive interventions that provide temporary monetary rewards for quitting are increasingly studied in the field of smoking cessation and are effective at increasing short-term abstinence rates (Halpern et\u00a0al., 2015; Kendzor et\u00a0al., 2015; Mantzari et\u00a0al., 2015; Volpp et\u00a0al., 2009). However, small monetary rewards for quitting do not remediate financial hardship as a structural determinant of long-term smoking and risk for relapse.\nA recent randomized controlled trial (RCT; Rogers et\u00a0al., 2022) demonstrated that a smoking cessation intervention that incorporated money management coaching, screening for financial benefits, and referral to community-based financial empowerment services resulted in significantly increased smoking abstinence, and decreased financial distress, compared to a minimal usual care control. However, intervention uptake overall was modest, with only 55% of participants randomized to the Intervention attending at least one intervention session within the 6-month intervention period. Among people who began the intervention, 85% received money management coaching, 47% completed the financial benefits screening, and 37% scheduled an appointment with a financial empowerment center. Previous studies of financial coaching have reported program uptake around 50% (Moulton et\u00a0al., 2013; Theodos et\u00a0al., 2015), and the only other smoking cessation RCT to include referral to community-based social services reported that only 47%\nof participants accepted the social services referral (Haas et\u00a0al., 2015). To help inform future efforts devoted toward increasing low-income patient engagement in financial coaching and benefits referrals, the present study is a secondary analysis of the RCT by Rogers et\u00a0al. (2022) that investigates participant factors associated with intervention engagement."

The remaining sessions were on-site or over the phone, depending on participant preference and needs.\nAll Intervention participants received a base program that included evidence-based smoking cessation coaching to help them develop an individualized quit plan (Fiore et\u00a0al., 2008; Rogers et\u00a0al., 2016). The coaching used problem-solving therapy to enhance motivation and efficacy, learn from prior quit attempts, identify and cope with triggers, and address environmental barriers. Participants were also offered a free 4-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The intervention integrated two financial coaching components into the cessation coaching sessions:\nScreening and referral for financial benefits and empower\u2011 ment programs. Counselors offered to screen participants for benefits using the \u201cNYC Access\u201d website\u2014a centralized resource for identifying city, state, and federal programs in multiple domains, including housing, education, childcare, health care, and legal aid. The counselors also offered to schedule participants an appointment with a NYC Financial Empowerment Center (FEC) to receive counseling to help with major financial issues. FEC counseling is free and confidential, regardless of income or immigration status.\nMoney management coaching. Interventionists offered participants money management coaching following a protocol adapted from a money management\u2013based substance use intervention (Black & Rosen, 2011). The coaching followed best-practices in financial coaching by working with participants longitudinally to develop and work toward client-centered goals. The coaching had two primary objectives: (1)\nto help participants create and maintain a household budget to meet short- and long-term goals and (2) to highlight and reinforce the link between tobacco cessation and the participant\u2019s goals through the release of discretionary income spent on tobacco. The counselors helped participants create an ideal monthly budget and identify three goals that they would work on during the coaching. Tobacco spending and savings were discussed during each session to reinforce the link between quitting smoking and achieving one\u2019s goals."

            "text": "Social determinants of health (SDH), including financial hardship, often have greater impact on health than do medical interventions (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014). There is growing effort among health care systems to implement programs for screening and referring patients to SDH resources (Andermann, 2018; Sundar, 2018); yet, although there is growing research interest in this area (e.g., Alexander et\u00a0al., 2019; Kendzor et\u00a0al., 2020), there have been few published RCTs evaluating the efficacy of interventions that directly target poor financial health to improve health behavior outcomes, such as tobacco use (Viswanathan et\u00a0al., 2021). This has created a gap in empirical knowledge on how to structure such programs to optimize patient engagement, satisfaction, and impact (Viswanathan et\u00a0al., 2021). This study is the first to examine factors that predict initial attendance and subsequent component uptake of an intervention that integrated financial coaching and benefits referrals into smoking cessation treatment for low-income people who smoke. Results showed that the rate of initial intervention attendance increased with participant age, education, and income. This finding is concerning, as it points to a missed opportunity to reach smokers with the lowest income and\neducational levels\u2014two populations with persistent disparities in tobacco use who may be most in need of a program that targets socio-contextual determinants of tobacco use (NCCDPHP, 2014).\nA promising finding was that participants belonging to other marginalized populations did not experience disparities in initial intervention attendance. This included people who were homeless, immigrants, people who preferred Spanish language, people with high rates of psychological distress, people who were unemployed, people with lower levels of health literacy, and people with lower levels of motivation and confidence to quit smoking. Additionally, once participants attended at least one intervention session, there were few patient factors associated with uptake of the individual intervention components. Overall, the intervention engagement patterns found in the current analysis suggest that future research may need to focus on decreasing disparities in initial program attendance to ensure equitable reach and impact of multi-component financial coaching programs. Once equity in initial program attendance is achieved, research should focus on increasing access to individual intervention components across all participants.\nPrior research has found that directly linking patients with financial services (available on site or virtually) may be key to\nTable 2 Comparison of logistic regression models\nDependent variable:\nAttend counseling Receive money management coaching\nReceive referral to FEC Receive assistance with ACCESS\nOR [p-value] (95% CI) OR [p-value] (95% CI) OR [p-value] (95% CI) OR [p-value] (95% CI) Predisposing characteristics Age \u00a0 Under 48 Ref Ref \u00a0 48\u201354 0.75 [.56] (0.30\u20131.92) 3.26 [.72] (0.90\u201311.80) \u00a0 55\u201360 1.25 [.62] (0.52\u20133.02) 4.12 [.02] (1.23\u201313.77) \u00a0 Over 60 4.20 [< .01] (1.58\u201311.20) 2.25 [< .17] (0.71\u20137.09)\nEducational attainment \u00a0 Less than high school grad Ref \u00a0 High school grad or equivalent 1.93 [.15] (0.79\u20134.76) \u00a0 At least some higher education 2.72 [.03] (1.13\u20136.55)\nPrefers speaking Spanish 0.32 [.06] (0.10\u20131.04) Perceived need Financial distress \u00a0 Low Ref \u00a0 Medium 2.71 [.14] (0.73\u201310.06) \u00a0 High 6.92 [.03] (1.16\u201341.13)\nEconomic deprivation from smoking\n4.27 [.07] (0.87\u201320.85)\nIncome greater than $1\u00a0k per month\n2.70 [< .01] (1.34\u20135.46)\nObservations 177 107 113 105\n1 3\noptimizing patient access and engagement (Dalembert et\u00a0al., 2021). On-site services fully integrated into health programs limit the time and financial burdens on patients, and also offer increased ease of data sharing between health and financial programs. Prior research has also found that the degree of uptake of programs devoted to screening and referring patients to social needs resources can vary by the referral approach (passive versus direct or warm hand-off), the accessibility of referral sites, and the intensity of time and labor required by patients to access resources (Ruiz Escobar et\u00a0al., 2021; Sanderson et\u00a0al., 2021). The fact that the on-site money management coaching provided by the current program\u2019s smoking cessation counselors was the most frequently received intervention component in the current study, while the referral to an FEC was the least frequently received component, is consistent with this prior research. Many community-based FECs are now offering online or telephone-based coaching, which should reduce access barriers and help with client engagement, and there is growing research into mobile financial coaching programs that should be explored as a referral option for health care patients who are unable to attend in-person programs (Collins et\u00a0al., 2017). Remote interventions like these may prove particularly important given the cultural shift toward virtual healthcare we have seen in the years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (Vosburg & Robinson, 2022). Moreover, remote interventions may have an outsize facilitative impact on attendance for those individuals who were least likely to attend sessions in our study\u2014workingaged people, those with low incomes, and those with no higher education\u2014as people in these groups may tend to have less flexible schedules and/or fewer resources to enable travel to in-person interventions.\nOne limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. Although the parent trial included 414 participants, the analytic samples for the regression models in this study are the subset of participants randomized to the Intervention group with complete data on variables of interest."
