Specifically: Fig. 1 TEM images appear to contain multiple highly similar areas. Fig. 8 a4 and b1 appear to contain an overlapping area. Fig. 9 d4 image appears to contain two highly similar areas. The authors have stated that the images in Fig. 1 originated from the same source image. They have also provided raw data to address these concerns; however, the same similarities were found in the raw data files by the publisher.
