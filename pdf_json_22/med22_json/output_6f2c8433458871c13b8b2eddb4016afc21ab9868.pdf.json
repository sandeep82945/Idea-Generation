    "abstractText": "Abiotic stress disturbs plant cellular redox homeostasis, inhibiting seed germination and plant growth. This is a crucial limitation to crop yield. Glutathione reductase (GR) is an important component of the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle which is involved in multiple plant metabolic processes. In the present study, GRs in A. sativa (AsGRs) were selected to explore their molecular characterization, phylogenetic relationship, and RNA expression changes during seed imbibition under abiotic stress. Seven AsGR genes were identified and mapped on six chromosomes of A, C, and D subgenomes. Phylogenetic analysis and subcellular localization of AsGR proteins divided them into two sub-families, AsGR1 and AsGR2, which were predicted to be mainly located in cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and chloroplast. Cis-elements relevant to stress and hormone responses are distributed in promoter regions of AsGRs. Tissue-specific expression profiling showed that AsGR1 genes were highly expressed in roots, leaves, and seeds, while AsGR2 genes were highly expressed in leaves and seeds. Both AsGR1 and AsGR2 genes showed a decreasing-increasing expression trend during seed germination under non-stress conditions. In addition, their responses to drought, salt, cold, copper, H2O2, and ageing treatments were quite different during seed imbibition. Among the seven AsGR genes, AsGR1-A, AsGR1-C, AsGR2-A, and AsGR2-D responded more significantly, especially under drought, ageing, and H2O2 stress. This study has laid the ground for the functional characterization of GR and the improvement of oat stress tolerance and seed vigor.",

Without stresses, ROS in the organism maintain the dynamic equilibrium by various antioxidative defense mechanisms [3,4]. The equilibrium of ROS-producing and ROS-scavenging can be changed under stressful conditions, which thus leads to the excessive accumulation of ROS, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and nucleic acid damage [4]. Recent studies have substantiated that ROS play a pivotal role in the regulation of seed germination, dormancy, and longevity [1,2,5]. However, adverse seed storage and germination conditions often lead to ROS accumulation, and inhibit germination and normal seedling establishment. The major sources of ROS production in plants are chloroplasts, mitochondria, peroxisome, apoplast, etc. [3]. In orthodox seeds, the mitochondrion is the main source of ROS (especially in seed germination) [6]. Therefore, alleviating the excessive accumulation of ROS and maintaining the dynamic balance of ROS are key to coping with the adverse environment. In plants, the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle as an antioxidant system, which involved enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, plays a vital role in detoxifying\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11650. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231911650 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11650 2 of 19\nROS [7]. Glutathione (GSH; c-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine), an omnipresent low-molecularweight thiol compound, is a strong non-enzymatic antioxidant and an essential metabolite with multifunction in plants [8,9]. It participates in various biological processes, including antioxidant defense, redox signaling, xenobiotics detoxification, etc. [8,9]. Due to the nucleophilic nature of their cysteine residues, GSH can be converted to oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Typically, the intracellular GSH concentration is kept at the millimole levels, and up to 90% GSH is in its reduced form under normal conditions [8]. Glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) belongs to the NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase group of flavoproteins and plays an important role in catalyzing the reduction of GSSG to GSH using NADPH as electron donor in eukaryotes and prokaryotes [7,10]. The redox balance of the GSH/GSSG couple is essential for maintaining seed vigor and normal germination, and the increase of endogenous and exogenous GSH is beneficial for seed vigor improvement under stress [11\u201313]. The expression levels of GR genes can be significantly induced by unfavorable conditions. The deletion or down-regulation of GR genes would lead to the decrease of seed vigor [14]. Moreover, GR activity increases during germination both in embryo and endosperm. These suggest that GSH and GR play a considerable role in the maintenance of the intracellular redox balance and biological functions. In plants, GRs are mainly localized in chloroplast, mitochondria, and cytosol [10]. Previous works have classified GR proteins into two clades of GR1 and GR2 on the basis of the presence of N-terminal extension. GR1 is a shorter cytosolic enzyme, and GR2 representing the elongated organellar proteins can target the GR proteins in both mitochondria and chloroplast [15]. NADPH binding domain, FAD binding domain, and the interface domain binding the two subunits of GR proteins are identified in GR proteins. GRs have been suggested to play a central role in maintaining the reduced GSH pool and improving abiotic and biotic stress resistance [10,16,17]. The localizations where GR is active are also the sources of ROS, such as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Oxidative stress caused by drought, temperature, heavy metals, salinity, and hydrogen peroxide can induce changes of GR gene expression and GR enzyme activity [10,18,19]. Overexpression of GRs improved the stress resistance in transgenic plants, and the deletion of GRs led to the decrease of antioxidant capacity [14,20\u201322]. The GR protein encoded by a small gene family has been described in many crops and model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica juncea, Brassica rapa, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, Aegilops tauschii, and Triticum aestivum [15,17,23,24]. The genome-wide identification of GRs, and characterizing its structure and function, would be useful for future functional and mechanism studies on GR proteins. In addition, RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of GR genes indicated that they strongly responded to abiotic and biotic stresses and plant hormones [17,18]. Typically, two or three GRs are found in the above reported species. Recently, seven GR genes were identified in the allohexaploid genome (AABBDD) of bread wheat [24]. Oats (Avena sativa) are also an allohexaploid species (AACCDD, 2 n = 6 x = 42) and rank sixth in world cereal production due to high nutritional and medicinal value and broad distributions [25]. The identification of essential gene families, especially antioxidant gene families, has not been carried out in oats, as the chromosome-scale reference genome was recently available (https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG3/graingenes-data-downloads, accessed on 24 November 2021) [26,27]. In addition, the central roles of GSH and GRs in seed vigor maintenance and seed germination have been demonstrated, but the divergent roles of different GR isoforms in seed germination under stress have not been reported. The aim of this study was to identify A. sativa GR genes in the whole genome level, and perform analysis of gene and protein structure, in silico subcellular localization prediction, and biochemical characterization. Moreover, the relative expressions of these members in response to the treatments of drought, salt, cold, CuSO4, H2O2, and ageing were compared by qPCR, in seed imbibition. This work can be utilized in future genetic improvement of A. sativa for stress tolerance and seed vigor.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11650 3 of 19"

All GR proteins are divided into two well-differentiated clades. Clade I contained AsGR1, AlGR1, AiGR1, AtGR1, OsGR2, and TaGR2 proteins, and Clade II consisted of AsGR2, AlGR2, AiGR2, AtGR2, OsGR1, OsGR3, and TaGR1 proteins. Both A. sativa and bread wheat are allohexaploid and have the same number of GRs, but there are three AsGRs and four TaGRs in Clades I, while four AsGRs and three TaGRs in Clade II. The distribution and classification of the GR members from A and D subgenomes are identical in the two species, but the classification is different in the unique B or C subgenome. AsGR2-C1 and AsGR2-C2 with close proximity on chromosome 4C were in the same clade, which indicated that AsGR2-C1 and AsGR2-C2 may be a result of expansion of tandem replication. Additionally, the grouping of AsGR proteins is highly associated with their in silico subcellular localization prediction results. AsGR1 proteins were predicted to be localized in the cytosol, and AsGR2 proteins were mainly localized in the plastid and mitochondria (Table 2). The results are consistent with the experimental subcellular localization of AtGRs and OsGRs and in silico prediction of TaGRs. Taken together, phylogenetic analysis and in silico subcellular localization indicated that GR, as an important oxidoreductase, has formed two main isoforms that may play specific roles in different tissues and under different environmental conditions. Therefore, it is of great significance to precisely regulate cellular GSH pool during plant development and stress conditions.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11650 5 of 19Int. J. ol.

A total of seven GR proteins were identified in A. sativa, which is the same number as that in bread wheat and more than those in other species. It suggested that the GR family members are closely related to their genome duplication events and genome size [24]. GR proteins were initially classified into cytosolic and chloroplast types based on the presence of a typical chloroplast signal peptide at the N-terminus. The AsGR family members were also divided into two clades and were consistent with the predicted subcellular localization. AsGR2-C2 in the chloroplast clade showed a deletion of 230 amino acids at the N-terminus, which may affect its localization and functions. Moreover, GR3 isoform was found in rice, B. distachyon, and sorghum, but does not appear in A. sativa and bread wheat [24,37]. It suggested that the evolution of GR genes in monocots is complicated. Additionally, AtGR1 and AtGR2 of Arabidopsis have several homologous in A. sativa, wheat and rice, which suggests that the evolutionary divergence of GR genes occurs after the split of monocotyledon and dicotyledon [38]. To understand the structure consistence and divergence of GR proteins, the gene structures and functional motifs of AsGR members were analyzed. The exon-intron patterns of AsGR genes showed that chloroplastic GR genes consisted of fewer exons as compared to cytosolic GR genes, which was highly consistent with the those of T. aestivum, Ae. tauschii, B. distachyon, S. bicolor, B. juncea, B. rapa, etc. [17,24]. However, the exon number of AsGR genes were more than those in most of the other species, which might be due to exon gain, insertion, and exonization during plant evolution [39]. Previous studies have indicated the higher number of exon/intron of cytosolic GR genes might be associated with its expression level [17]. Introns also have been shown to increase transcriptional efficiency of numerous genes in a variety of organisms [40]. Moreover, genes with multiple exons and introns can form more variable splicing isoforms and participate in different regulatory networks. Briefly, the structural changes of GR genes in oat play an important role in its subcellular expression and transcriptional regulation to cope with adverse environment. A total of 15 motifs were discovered in 7 AsGR proteins, which was consistent with bread wheat and B. distachyon [24], but less than 19 motifs in Chinese cabbage, Brassica rapa, and Brassica napus [16,17]. In most cases, chloroplastic GRs showed more motifs than cytosolic isoforms, and several specific motifs can be found in chloroplastic GRs [24]. In the present investigation, motif 10 associated with the N-terminal targeting signal peptide was found in AsGR2-A, AsGR2-C1 and AsGR2-D and showed high identify with chloroplastic signal peptide of TaGRs and OsGRs [15,24]. Previous studies have found that alanine was the most abundant amino acid in monocot transit peptides, whereas serine was the most abundant in eudicot genotypes. In eudicots, serine was more abundant with 30% more serine on average compared with monocot transit peptides [41]. The serine ratio of chloroplast signal peptide in AsGR proteins was 5.9%, which was significantly lower than that of Arabidopsis (27.9%). Additionally, motif 12 and motif 13 are specific to AsGR2 and AsGR1, respectively. Motif 14 is at the N- and C- terminals in AsGR1 and AsGR2, respectively. This divergence might be associated with their biochemical activity and functional diversity, as cytosolic, chloroplastic, and mitochondrial GR isoforms showed great difference in catalytic activity [23,42]. Expression profiling is important for understanding gene functions and screening of candidate genes. Genes specifically expressed in different tissues often have specific functions as well. AsGR1-A and AsGR1-C were highly expressed in non-imbibed seeds, roots, and leaves, and might have a pivotal role in oxidative stress in these tissues. Similarly, the cytosolically localized BcGR1.1 in Chinese cabbage was highly expressed in the roots, and BcGR1.1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed less damage to the root system under copper stress [16]. The cytosolic isoforms in bread wheat (TaGR2-A, TaGR2-B1, TaGR2B2 and TaGR2-D), rice (OsGR2) and Arabidopsis (AtGR1) were also highly expressed in root [15,24]. On the other hand, chloroplast/mitochondrial double-localization AsGR2 isoforms were expressed strongly in leaves, lemmas, and dry seeds. Chloroplastic GRs\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11650 13 of 19\nhas been confirmed to be highly expressed in leaves and have the function of maintaining leaf function and coping with senescence [22]. As lemmas were reported to contribute on seed filling especially under adverse conditions, high expression of GR may act on the protection of photosynthetic system in lemmas [43]. In plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts are the main source of ROS. At the later stage of seed development, seeds are subjected to dehydration stress and may have the risk of excessive accumulation of ROS [44]. TaGR1-B and TaGR1-A were found upregulated at this stage, which would be conducive to alleviating the excessive accumulation of ROS in seeds. High expression levels of AsGR2 genes were detected in dry A. sativa seeds, which might be beneficial for maintaining seed longevity. The positive role of GR genes in coping with stress has been widely reported. The deletion and low expression of GR genes are often associated with poor stress resistance, while overexpression of GR improves the capacity to withstand oxidative damage caused by abiotic stresses [16,20,23,45]. Expression profiling indicated AsGR genes were significantly induced during seed germination under drought stress, especially in the early stage of imbibition, and AsGR2 genes were more remarkable. This may be considerable for the special biological process of seed germination, since highly reduced GSH pools are needed in the early stage of seed imbibition, so as to alleviate the accumulation of ROS under strong respiration and display the reduction modification of proteins required for germination [11,14]. AsGR genes showed diverse responses to salt treatment during germination. The functions of GR genes under salt stress have been well characterized in wheat, tomato, rice, Stipa purpurea, and other species [24,36,37,46]. It was reported that salt stress inhibited radicle elongation during seed germination of A. sativa, wheat, and rice, while cytoplasmic GR isoforms are highly expressed in roots, which may have a significant protective effect on radicle elongation [47,48]. Under H2O2 treatment, AsGR1-A, AsGR1-D, AsGR2-A, and AsGR2-D expressions were strongly induced during seed imbibition, indicating that they have more significant effects on protection against oxidative damage, and stress specific induction may exist for AsGR genes. Seed ageing is an inevitable and complex process, and its mechanisms have not been well revealed so far. The deletion of chloroplast specific GR2 leads to the embryo lethality, while lack of mitochondrial GR2 leads to a partially oxidized glutathione pool and decreased seed ageing resistance of Arabidopsis [14,21]. In addition, our previous study found that the expression of GR1 in aged A. sativa seed embryos (aged from 24 d to 42 d) decreased by 50%\u201370% compared with the control after imbibition for 24 h and that GR2 levels decreased significantly in minorly and moderately aged seeds, but were raised significantly in severely aged seeds [33]. In present study, the expression of AsGR2-C2 and AsGR2-D decreased significantly in dry seeds after ageing treatment, but they increased rapidly in the early stage of imbibition. Ageing may cause damage to the mitochondrial structural and functional systems [13,30,49]. In the early stage of seed imbibition, excessive respiration can increase the electron transport of mitochondria, which will lead to electron leakage and ROS accumulation [6]. In this study, the expression of AsGR2-A, AsGR2-C1, and AsGR2-D was highly expressed in the early stage of seed imbibition, which could alleviate the damaged redox homeostasis in mitochondria and ensure the energy supply for seed germination. It is suggested that AsGR2 might be more active on the maintenance of redox homeostasis during germination, especially under PEG, ageing, and H2O2 stress. Cis-regulatory elements in the promoters control development and physiology by regulating gene expression. Hormone and stress responsive elements are the main functional factors detected in the promoters of AsGR genes. This study analyzed the expression of AsGR genes under stress during seed germination, but the response of AsGR genes to hormone should also be concerned. The crosstalk of hormonal and redox signals has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the regulation of plant resistance, leaf senescence, seed germination, seed development, and seed longevity [50\u201352]. Plant growth and environmental adaptation are regulated by various combinations of cis-elements, and only a small set of responsive genes can be regulated by a single cis-element [53]. GA, ABA, SA,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11650 14 of 19\nMeJA, and IAA responsive elements combined with stress responsive elements may play an important role in the regulation of stress resistance and development. Moreover, these cis-elements seem to be species-specific and subcellular localization-specific. For instance, ABA-responsive elements were not found in the promoter of pea GR genes [54], but only in the promoter of AsGR2 genes and not in the promoter of AsGR1 genes in A. sativa. ABA is a crucial factor of seed vigor, and it has been found to play a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS production and energy metabolism in recent years [55,56]. It is hypothesized that the interaction between mitochondrial GR2 and ABA may play a role in regulating seed vigor. Consequently, the regulatory relationship between AsGR2 genes and hormone signaling should be focused on in the future."

For A. sativa tissue-specific expression profiling of AsGRs, twelve samples including seeds, roots, leaves, stems, florets and lemmas were used. In detail, seed samples were collected in imbibition phases (imbibition for 0 h, 12 h and 24 h) and development phases (8, 15 and 30 days after flowering, DAF). Young leaves, lemmas and florets were collected at flowering stage, and old leaves were from plants at 30 DAF. The roots were obtained from 10-day-old plants. To understand the expression profiling of AsGRs during seed germination under salt, drought and heavy metal stresses, seeds were subjected to 150 mM NaCl, 20% PEG 6000 and 200 mg L\u22121 CuSO4\u00b75H2O solution for imbibition, respectively [63\u201366]. For oxidative stress, seeds were imbibed in 2% H2O2, since the germination percentage decreased from almost 100% to 45% after treatment. For control, cold treatment and ageing treatment, seeds were imbibed in distilled water. Seed ageing treatment were according to Xia et al. [13], and seeds ageing time was according to our previous investigation [33]. Cold treatment was carried out at 10 \u25e6C, while control and other treatments were imbibed at 20 \u25e6C in the plant growth incubator under 16 h dark and 8 h light cycle. Seed samples were collected after imbibition for 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 72 h, which included the three major phases of oat seed imbibition under normal conditions. Each tissue sample contained three biological replicates, and each replicate was collected from at least ten seeds or plants. The collected tissue samples were then ground into powder in liquid nitrogen."

Structure analysis suggested AsGR genes were highly conserved and that AsGR1 contained higher number of exon/introns. Both AsGR1 and AsGR2 genes have relatively high expres-\nInt. J. Mol.

Their responses to drought, salt, cold, copper, H2O2, and ageing treatments were quite different during seed imbibition. Among the seven AsGR genes, AsGR1-A, AsGR1-C, AsGR2-A, and AsGR2-D responded more significantly, especially under drought, ageing, and H2O2 stress. It suggested that they might be more active on the maintenance of redox homeostasis during seed imbibition under unfavorable conditions. The present study will lay the foundation for future studies on verifications of the precise regulation of GR genes in A. sativa. Finally, stress-responsive AsGR genes can be used for genetic improvement of stress resistance and seed vigor in oat.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms231911650/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.M. and M.S.; methodology, M.S. and S.S.; software, M.S., S.S., Z.J. and H.Z.; validation, M.S. and S.S.; formal analysis, M.S. and S.S.; investigation, M.S., Z.J., W.M., C.M., C.O., L.H. and J.W.; resources, P.M.; data curation, M.S. and Z.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.M., M.L. and S.J.; visualization, M.S.; supervision, P.M. and S.J.; project administration, P.M.; funding acquisition, P.M.
