    "abstractText": "We perform a Bayesian study of a generalization of the basic \u03b1-attractor T model given by the potential V (\u03c6) = V0 [ 1\u2212 sech ( \u03c6/ \u221a 6\u03b1Mpl )] where \u03c6 is the inflaton field and the parameter \u03b1 corresponds to the inverse curvature of the scalar manifold in the conformal or superconformal realizations of the attractor models. Such generalization is characterized by the power p which includes the basic or base model for p = 2. Once the priors for the parameters of the \u03b1-attractor potential are set by numerical exploration, we perform the corresponding statistical analysis for the cases p = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4, and derive posteriors. Considering the original \u03b1-attractor potential as the base model, we calculate the evidence for our generalization, and conclude that the p = 4 model is preferred by the CMB data. We also present constraints for the parameter \u03b1. Interestingly, all the cases studied prefer a specific value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio given by r \u2243 0.0025.

            "text": "The physical processes that gave origin to our universe remain unknown. The most accepted hypothesis, that at the very beginning the spacetime undergoes an exponential expansion, is the so called inflation paradigm [1, 2]. Once such expansion ends, a reheating period must have taken place leading to the hot big bang. Inflation is usually modelled by a scalar field, dubbed the inflaton field. It is approximately after 380,000 years from this initial stage, that we are able to look at the early universe through the first light coming from the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) and infer the physics of the inflationary era. Particularly, the primordial fluctuations of the inflaton field are imprinted in several observables, such as the spectral index ns, the scalar and tensor amplitude As and At respectively, and the quotient between these quantities: the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nr = At As . (1.1)\nThis synthesizes in a single number the tensor fluctuations of the metric field, also known as the primordial gravitational waves. This is a prediction of the inflationary paradigm, and several experiments have been performed to detect them, such as Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization (BICEP, r < 0.73 at 95%) [3], QUEST at DASI (QUaD, r < 0.48 at 95%) [4], the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP, r < 0.38 at 95%) [5], the Q/U Imaging ExperimenT (QUIET, r < 2.7 at 95%) [6], Planck Satellite Collaboration (r < 0.06 at 95%) [7], the South Pole Telescope (SPTpol, r < 0.44 at 95%) [8]. The current upper bounds on r have been reported by the combined BICEP/Keck and Planck data [9], with a value given by r < 0.032 at 95%, whereas futures experiments such as LiteBIRD would impose constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio with upper limits of the order r \u2243 0.003 [10]. It is therefore of great relevance to investigate the dynamics of the inflaton field, and looking for some prediction of particular models with the aim of elucidate which kind of potentials are able to reproduce CMB observations. From all the families of scalar field potentials (see e.g. Table 1 from [11] for some examples of several forms of V (\u03d5)), we will focus in those known as \u03b1-attractor models. Specifically, we carry out a Bayesian study of \u03b1-attractor models of inflation of the type T [12]. Several\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nrealizations of \u03b1-attractors have been studied with considerable detail in recent years1 [14\u2013 20], since they fall at the so called sweet spot of the parameter space preferred by Planck data [21]. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic Bayesian study of them is still missing. The present article intends to address this problem using a generalization [22] V = V0 [ 1\u2212 sechp(\u03d5/ \u221a 6\u03b1Mpl) ] of the basic model V = V0 tanh2(\u03d5/ \u221a 6\u03b1Mpl) of \u03b1-attractors of type T characterized by the presence of a definite positive function that allows the generalization to be viable as an inflation model for any rational value of the parameter p. This generalization also has the peculiarity that the first term in the expansion of the potential around the origin, where reheating should take place, is quadratic with the parameter p appearing only as a multiplicative factor of \u03d52 and of higher order terms, where \u03d5 is the inflaton field. We focus in particular the cases with p = 1 , 2 , 3 and 4, which have been also studied analytically within the slow roll approximation [23].\nIn our analysis, the members of the family of potentials (models) are identified by a specific value of the exponent p defined above, whereas the main parameters of the model to be constrained are the amplitude of the potential V0, and \u03bb (in the original notation \u03bb \u2261 1/ \u221a 6\u03b1). This is directly related to the curvature of the inflaton scalar manifold. Specifically, the Ka\u0308hler metric defines the metric in the field space, and \u03b1 (or \u03bb) is inversely (directly) related to the curvature scalar in the inner space (for more details see [12, 24]). Within the Bayesian study itself, we consider flat priors for (V0 , \u03bb), which were settle by the aim of numerical exploration with the Boltzmann code class [25], which incorporates a module to simulate inflation for a given inflationary scalar field potential V (\u03d5) . The statistical analysis was carried out with the public Monte Carlo code Monte Python [26], from which the posteriors for the inflaton potential parameters, (the logarithm of) V0 and \u03bb , are derived, as well as those of cosmological parameters such as the number of e-folds for the inflationary period N\u22c6, the spectral index ns, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. The value of the latter is an important result: for any of the values of p we have explored, all the cases present r \u2243 0.0025. Figure 1 shows that this result is in good agreement with current and forecast constraints on r. As a final part of our analysis, we perform a Bayesian selection of models within the family under study with p = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4, for which we have used the public software MCEvidence [27]. Our results show that the case p = 4 is favoured over the base model with p = 2, which represents the standard \u03b1-attractor model with tangent potential. On the other hand, the cases p = 1 and p = 3 are disfavoured by CMB data.\nThis article is organised as follows: in Section 2 we briefly review the basic \u03b1-attractor model of inflation of the type T with emphasis on two of its generalizations: One given by the potential of Eq. (2.3) and a second generalization, the one here studied, given by the potential in (2.4). Relevant formulas for the slow-roll parameters and observables are presented and relations between the parameters of the inflationary model with their values in the class package are established. In Section 3 we perform a numerical analysis of the model, by including the potential (2.4) in the Boltzmann code class. This allows us to establish the priors for the potential parameters V0 and \u03bb, such that the range of values for both of them, for any value of p = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4, are consistent with reported values of observed physical quantities such as the scalar amplitude As, the spectral index ns, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. In Section 4 we show the results from the statistical analysis. We use the Bayes\u2019s Theorem: 1.- to obtain the posteriors for [log V0 , \u03bb ,N\u22c6 , ns , r] and 2.- to calculate the evidence and the Bayes\u2019s factor for each value of p, considering as the base model p = 2. Finally we provide\n1Even the authors have studied such models in the context of dark energy [13].\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nour concluding remarks in Section 5."

            "text": "In a recent article a new generalization of the basic \u03b1-attractor model has been proposed [22]. The basic model is defined by the potential [12]\nV (\u03a8) \u221d \u03a82, (2.1)\nwhere \u03a8 \u221d tanh(\u03bb\u03d5/Mpl) makes \u03d5 a canonically normalized field identified with the inflaton in a class of phenomenological models of the type [28]\n1\u221a \u2212g L = 1 2 M2plR\u2212 1 2 M2pl\n(\u2202\u00b5\u03a8) 2\n(1\u2212 \u03bb2\u03a82)2 \u2212 V (\u03a8), (2.2)\nwhere Mpl is the reduced Planck mass given by Mpl = 2.44\u00d7 1018GeV. The potential (2.1) is naturally generalized to V (\u03a8) \u221d \u03a8p giving rise to the form [12],\nVt = V0 tanh p ( \u03bb \u03d5\nMpl\n) . (2.3)\nOn the other hand the generalization proposed in [22] is given by V (\u03a8) \u221d 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03a82)p/2 resulting in the potential\nVs = V0\n[ 1\u2212 sechp ( \u03bb \u03d5\nMpl\n)] . (2.4)\nNotice that for p = 2, the original potential (2.3) is recovered. The main distinction between (2.3) and (2.4) is that the latter involves a positive definite function, and it thus produces a series of well-behaved inflationary potentials for practically any value of the parameter p (including odd and fractional values of p). This is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nContrary to the potential (2.3), the generalized potential (2.4) also has the peculiarity that the first term in the expansion around the origin is quadratic with the parameter p appearing only as a multiplicative factor of \u03d52 and of higher order terms as:\nVs V0 = 1 2 p\n( \u03bb \u03d5\nMpl\n)2 \u2212 1\n24 p(2 + 3p)\n( \u03bb \u03d5\nMpl\n)4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.5)\nThe properties of this potential and its advantages have been already analyzed in detail [22]. In the present work, our main goal is to fully explore the scope of such inflationary model, making use of both numerical tools and statistical methods, in order to assess its viability and evaluate specific predictions on physical observables.\n2.1 \u03b1-attractor inflation in class\nTo simulate the evolution of linear perturbations in the universe and to compute the CMB anisotropies as well as large scale structure observables, we use the numerical code class [25]. The usual expressions for the slow-roll parameters \u03b7 and \u03f5 are defined in the primordial.c module as follows:\n\u03b7 = M2pl V \u2032\u2032\nV , \u03f5 = M2pl 2\n( V \u2032\nV\n)2 , (2.6)\nwhile the observables corresponding to the scalar spectral index ns, the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and the scalar and tensor amplitudes at horizon crossing As and At are, respectively, given by\nns = 1 + 2\u03b7 \u2212 6\u03f5 , r = 16\u03f5 , As = 1\n24\u03c02\u03f5\nV\nM4pl , At =\n2 3\u03c02 V\nM4pl . (2.7)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nwhere Mpl \u2261 1/ \u221a 8\u03c0GN is the reduced Planck mass which we take as Mpl = 1/ \u221a 8\u03c0. For the specific model Eq. (2.4) the amplitudes at horizon crossing are given by\nAs = V0 M4pl\n[ sech ( \u03bb \u03d5\u22c6Mpl )]\u22122p [ 1\u2212 sechp ( \u03bb \u03d5\u22c6Mpl )]3 12p2\u03c02\u03bb2 [ 1\u2212 sech2 ( \u03bb \u03d5\u22c6Mpl\n)] , (2.8) At =\n2V0 3\u03c02M4pl\n[ 1\u2212 sechp ( \u03bb\n\u03d5\u22c6 Mpl\n)] , (2.9)\nwhere \u03d5\u22c6 is the inflaton value at the time scales leave the horizon. Finally, the correspondence between the parameters of the inflationary model (V0 , \u03bb , p) with those in class (Vparam0, Vparam1, Vparam2) is\nVparam0 = V0 M4pl , Vparam1 = \u03bb , Vparam2 = p .

Due to the complexity of the equations, only in the p = 2 case has it been possible to find an analytical expression in closed form for the tensor-to-scalar ratio r in terms of the scalar spectral index ns and the number of e-folds N\u22c6 during inflation. This is given by\nr = 4(N\u22c6\u03b4ns \u2212 2)2\n1 +N\u22c6(N\u22c6\u03b4ns \u2212 2) , (2.11)\nwhere \u03b4ns is defined as \u03b4ns \u2261 1\u2212 ns. It is not hard to show that ns is bounded by [22]\n1\u2212 2 N\u22c6 \u2264 ns < 1\u2212 2 N\u22c6 + 1 N2\u22c6 . (2.12)\nThus, we see that the range of ns is very small and proportional to 1/N2\u22c6 . These models have been further studied in ref. [23], where constraints from the reheating epoch are imposed. In addition to the cases previously studied, here we will add the case p = 3, for which it is possible to write the parameters, V0 and \u03bb, in terms of the observables ns and r and use the ranges reported by Planck and other experiments to constrain their ranges. The resulting expressions, however, are too intricate, and not worth writing explicitly. Note that Eq. (2.12) implies that the range of allowed values for ns is dictated by that of 1/N2\u22c6 . In the considered model, \u03b7 is of order 1/N\u22c6, so it is of order \u03b72. This shows that, for example, in equation (2.7), contributions of order \u03b72 must be included in ns. However, the above has been written in the first order Slow-Roll approximation for illustrative purposes, since the Bayesian analysis is performed numerically without approximations."

            "text": "As mentioned in Section 2.2, it has been possible to obtain analytical expressions for the case p = 2, whereas for p = 1 and p = 4, semi-analytical formulas have been useful to infer some of the properties of such models (see [22]). As a first step in the analysis of these models, we implement the \u03b1-attractor model in class, and we solve numerically the inflationary phase\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nconsidering the inflaton potential given by (2.4). In particular, we take as reference point the study in ref. [22], and consider at first the same values of the exponential p = 1 , 2 , 4 (for the complete analysis, however, we include in the following section the odd case p = 3). For the same exact value obtained from the semi-analytical solutions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, the e-fold number N\u22c6, and the potential parameters V0 and \u03bb, we have obtained the numerical values of the spectral index ns from class. This can be seen in Figure 3, where the relative difference for the spectral index \u2206ns between the semi-analytical and numerical results, is shown. The gray band covers the region for each value of r and for each case p = 1, 2, 4, of the percentage difference on ns on the range of N\u22c6 \u2208 [50 , 60]. In particular, the solid line corresponds to the highest difference which occurs for p = 1 and N\u22c6 = 50, whereas the lower difference (dashed line) is obtained for the case p = 4 and N\u22c6 = 60. The model under study has the particularity that an expansion around its minimum always has a quadratic term as its main contribution, the parameter p playing a weak role not as a power of \u03d5 as in the tanhp model but as a coefficient of the powers of \u03d5 only (see (2.5)). Therefore, we can think that perturbative reheating occurs for \u03c9re \u2248 0. In this case and following [29], [30] the priors for N\u22c6 have been calculated in [23], where the inflationary constraints coming from reheating are studied and given there in Table 1. Thus, the priors we use for N\u22c6 are consistent with a reheating epoch.\nFigure 3 thus shows that the values for ns are recovered in a very good approximation. In fact, for all cases the relative differences are \u2272 0.030%. The numerical solutions obtained from class for the scalar amplitude ln(1010Aclasss ) = 3.045, were always consistent with the current value reported by Planck Collaboration 2018 [21]: ln(1010As) = 3.044 \u00b1 0.014. This is important since, with no a priori constraints for the range of values of the potential parameters V0 and \u03bb, solving the inflationary phase with class allowed us to determine the values of potential (2.4) consistent with the current observed values of ns and As, when p and N\u22c6 are specified. This is useful to establish the priors for the parameters of the \u03b1-attractor potential.\nAdditionally, in Figure 4 we observe that as the number of e-fold increases, the value\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nof ns also increases for a given p. On the other hand, we can see that the value of r is not restricted for any value of N\u22c6 = 50 , 55 , 60 (solid, dashed, and dotted line respectively), or by any of the exponents p = 1 , 2 , 4 (green, blue, and red respectively). Both aspects mentioned above, i.e., the correlation between N\u22c6 and ns, and the lack of a preferred value of r, will be looked at in detail through the statistical analysis of Section 4.\nThe range of values for the potential parameters V0 and \u03bb, determined by the corresponding range of observables obtained from class, is illustrated, for the relevant cases, in Figure 5. It is important to mention that the numerical precision allows for values of the tensor to scalar ratio as small as r \u223c 10\u22125, which in turn allows for larger values of the potential parameter \u03bb for each case of p considered, given N\u22c6. Therefore, our priors on \u03bb will be numerically bounded from above, but for all the cases such maximum values of \u03bb will be consistent with the current constraints on r < 0.032 [9]."

            "text": "Following the approach of Section 3, we have included in our analysis a new the case for the potential (2.4): p = 3, that is, a new, odd value of p. In order to obtain the priors for [V0 , \u03bb] when p = 3, we have made an interpolation between the range of values obtained for such parameters when considering p = 2 and p = 4. Moreover, we have verified that the values obtained for the cosmological parameters As , ns and r, where consistent with the reported values by observations, just as we did for the cases p = 1 , 2 and 4 in the previous Section. According to Bayes\u2019 theorem, the probability of a model M with a set of parameters \u0398, in light of the observed data D, is given by the Posterior P:\nP(\u0398 | D,M) = L(D | \u0398,M)\u03a0(\u0398 | M) E(D | M) , (4.1)\nwhere L is the Likelihood function, \u03a0 represents the set of Priors, containing the a priori information about the parameters of the model and E is the Evidence. For any value of p, the parameter space we are considering is given by [100\u03c9b , \u03c9cdm , 100\u03b8s , \u03c4reio , log V0 , \u03bb ,N\u22c6],\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nwhich are the standard cosmological parameters for the amount of baryons \u03c9b and cold dark matter \u03c9cdm, the angular diameter distance \u03b8s, the optical depth \u03c4reio, the potential parameters V0 , \u03bb, as well as the number of e-fold N\u22c6. The priors are indicated in Table 1. On the other hand, as a derived parameters of interest we will obtain posteriors for ns and r as well.\nFor a given model M , the Bayesian Evidence E (hereafter simply the evidence) is the normalizing constant in the right hand side of Eq. (4.1). It normalises the area under the posterior P to unity, and is given by\nE(D | M) = \u222b d\u0398L(D|\u0398,M)\u03a0(\u0398|M) . (4.2)\nThe evidence can be neglected in model fitting, but it becomes important in model comparison. In fact, when comparing two different models M1 and M2 using Bayes\u2019 theorem (4.1), the ratio of posterior probabilities of the two models P1 and P2 will be proportional to\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nthe ratio of their evidences, that is\nP1(\u03981 | D,M1) P2(\u03982 | D,M2) = \u03a01(\u03981|M1) \u03a02(\u03982|M2) E1(D | M1) E2(D | M2) . (4.3)\nThis ratio between posteriors leads to the definition of the Bayes Factor B12, which in logarithmic scale is written as\nlogB12 \u2261 log [ E1(D | M1) E2(D | M2) ] = log [E1(D | M1)]\u2212 log [E2(D | M2)] . (4.4)\nIf logB12 is larger (smaller) than unity, the data favours model M1 (M2). To assess the strength of the evidence contained in the data, Jeffreys [31] introduces an empirical scale, see Table 2.\nWe show in Figure 6 the posteriors for the \u03b1-attractor parameters log V0 , and \u03bb, as well as for the standard cosmological inflation parameters N\u22c6 , ns , and r. The posteriors were obtained by using the CMB likelihood from Planck Satellite 2018, which is publicly available in http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#cosmology. Thus, we generated the corresponding Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Monte Python2. The (logarithmic) amplitude of the \u03b1attractor potential presents a nearly flat posterior for all values of the exponential p, indicating that V0 has approximately the same probability to match CMB observations for values in the range V0 = [ 10\u221214 , 10\u221212 ] . On the other hand, we show for the first time, constraints on the theoretical parameter encoding the curvature of the K\u00e4hler manifold, \u03bb, as displayed in Table 3:\nAdditionally, we have obtained that any value of p study here, the tensor to scalar ratio is consistent with\nr \u2243 2.5\u00d7 10\u22123 \u00b1 10\u22125 , (4.5) 2Notice that we do not include the posteriors for the standard cosmological parameters 100\u03c9b , \u03c9cdm , 100\u03b8s , \u03c4reio in Figure 6, since they do not present major changes with respect to their tightly constrained values from Planck [7]. For such parameters we obtained (specifically for p = 3): 100\u03c9b = 2.24+0.0127\u22120.0121 , \u03c9cdm = 0.12 +0.000786 \u22120.000774 , 100\u03b8s = 1.04 +0.000269 \u22120.000285 , \u03c4reio = 0.0534 +0.00717 \u22120.00606 .\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nas can be seen in Figure 6. This constitutes a prediction of the family of \u03b1-attractor models with potential (2.4). Thus, as opposed to the semi-analytical results obtained in Section 3, the statistical analysis of data constrains the value of r. We find interesting that all the models considered in this work agree in one specific value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio.\nFrom the posteriors we also confirm the relation we obtained numerically for N\u22c6 and ns: as N\u22c6 increases, ns increases as well (see disscusion in Section 3 and Figure 4), that is, these quantities are correlated. When broadening the priors for these parameters we found a long delay in convergence and practically no change in this behavior. On the other hand, it is also evident from the posteriors that \u03bb is anti-correlated with either N\u22c6 or ns. This implies lower values of \u03bb to be preferred by CMB observations according to the estimated value of N\u22c6, and the observed value of ns. In Section 5 we discuss the corresponding values for the parameter in the original notation \u03b1, and the physical implications in field space.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nWith the posteriors at hand, we are en route to calculate the evidence. This can be computed through a variety of techniques [34\u201341], and several programs have been developed to compute the evidence for cosmological models by solving the multidimensional integral given by Eq. (4.2) [42\u201346] (for a Bayesian analysis of several inflationary models, some of the authors have used these numerical tools, see for instance [47]). One alternative to calculate the evidence is given by [27], where the unnormalized posterior P\u0303(\u0398 | D,M) is proportional to the number density n(\u0398 | D,M), we have, P\u0303(\u0398 | D,M) = a n(\u0398 | D,M) . Since the number density is given by\nn(\u0398 | D,M) = N P(\u0398 | D,M) = N P\u0303(\u0398 | D,M) E(D | M) , (4.6)\nwhere N is the lenght of the chain, then,\nE(D | M) = a N , (4.7)\nand thus, once knowing the proportionality constant a, the evidence E can be directly obtained from the MCMC chains. The open source software MCEvidence [27] is designed to compute the Bayesian evidence from MCMC sampled posterior distributions. The code takes the k\u2212th nearest-neighbor distances in parameter space using the Mahalanobis distance to estimate the Bayesian evidence from the MCMC samples provided by the chains. Employing this approach, Table 4 shows the (logarithmic) evidence ln Ep, the Bayes factor 2 logBp2 when choosing the case p = 2 as the reference model, and the strength of the evidence for each value of p. The evidence for the case p = 1 was already studied in [11, 48] (Mutated Hilltop Inflation (MHI) in the notation of the mentioned references), but in such study it was compared to the Higgs Inflation (HI) potential as the base model. In that case, the authors analyzed three separate cases for the prior of the parameter \u00b5 which plays the role of our 1/\u03bb within the hyperbolic secant function. They found that the MHI is disfavoured over HI, just as in our case when comparing p = 1 with the base model we consider, p = 2.\nThus, whereas odd values of p are not preferred over the base model with p = 2, the case p = 4 results favoured by CMB observations with a positive strength according to the Jeffreys\u2019 scale. We can understand why this is so by looking at the spectrum of CMB anisotropies shown in Figure 7. The figure displays the spectrum of the CMB radiation taken by the Planck Satellite Collaboration [7], together with the numerical solutions for each value of p = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4. As stated in Section 4, V0 can take any value within the priors. Thus, we take values of V0 \u2243 10\u221213, which are consistent with the observed As , ns and r3. In the case of \u03bb, we have used the mean value reported in Table 3. The remaining cosmological parameter to consider is N\u22c6. From the posteriors we see that larger values of N\u22c6 are most\n3For this last parameter we obtained the numerical value matching our result r \u2243 0.0025.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nlikely, according to CMB data. Consequently, the numerical solutions will better fit the data as the e-fold number gets larger. This is precisely the case: for N\u22c6 = 50 and 55 (top and middle plots respectively in Figure 7) the relative difference increases as p increases. However, when considering N\u22c6 = 60 (bottom) the relative difference is lower and the best fit to CMB data, is given by the case p = 4. As we mention above, larger values of N\u22c6 are most likely according to CMB data. Thus, the correlation between N\u22c6 and ns implies that for the spectral index the most likely values are larger as well. However, notice that the range of maximum probability of ns obtained for each p (see dark regions (1\u03c3) in the N\u22c6 \u2212 ns plane in Figure 6) is all contained within the standard deviation reported by Planck Satellite Collaboration, given by ns = 0.965\u00b1 0.004."

            "text": "The inflationary paradigm stipulates an exponential expansion at the initial stage of the universe, and the signatures of such process can be inferred from the CMB radiation. Particularly, the presence of primordial gravitational waves is a prediction of inflation and, if detected, this will allow to understand the physics of the universe at very early times. In the present work we have analyzed the family of models dubbed as \u03b1-attractors in the form proposed in ref. [22]. While in previous works such models have been explored semi-analytically, showing a favourable behavior to describe the physics of inflation (and reheating), we now have implemented, through numerical and statistical analyses, their viability as promising candidates for an inflaton potential in the light of CMB data. It is interesting to note that the value of the tensor-scalar ratio r remains approximately equal to 0.0025 regardless of the values of the parameter p for the four cases studied. This value of r falls comfortably within the upper limits imposed by current collaborations such as BICEP/Keck (r < 0.032) and the expected values of future experiments such as LiteBIRD (r < 0.003). It would be interesting to study cases with p > 4 to see whether the value r \u2248 0.0025 starts to change significantly (work is being done in that direction). Moreover, we have imposed constraints on the inflaton parameter \u03bb, that is, after we ran chains in a MCMC process in order to find the most likely value of \u03bb given the CMB data. This goes beyond the superposition of semi-analytical solutions on posterior plots of the ns \u2212 r plane. The latter procedure, may give some idea on the range of values for inflationary models consistent with observations. However, the rigorous approach in order to obtain robust results is to implement a statistical analysis where the parameters of the inflationary potential of interest are properly contained in the parameter space, as done here. As described in Section 1, \u03bb \u2261 1/ \u221a 6\u03b1 is related to the curvature scalar in the field space, and the values we have obtained from the posteriors for \u03bb (see Figure 6 and Table 3), are useful to generate posteriors for \u03b1, which we show in Figure 8. A reference work performing MCMC analyses for \u03b1-attractor models, although for other inflaton potential (specifically, the double-well inflationary potential) is [49]. It will be interesting to study higher values of p aiming for insights related with the Bayes\u2019s factor for this family of models. From Table 4 we see that odd values of p are less favoured for increasing p, whereas for even p the Bayes\u2019s factor is larger as long as p increases, resulting in a preferred model for the larger studied value of p. Exploring larger values of p we hope to find a maximum in the Bayes\u2019s factor. Work in progress gives us hope since we find that consistent semi-analytical solutions are obtained only if r is larger than its upper bound, which should be disfavoured by the Bayesian analysis. Moreover, fractional values of\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\u2013 13 \u2013\np can also contribute to understand whether some trend is present in the Bayes\u2019s factor for these inflationary models. This will be studied in detail elsewhere.\nIn summary, we have performed a Bayesian study of models belonging to a class of \u03b1attractors defined by the potential V (\u03d5) = V0 [ 1\u2212 sechp ( \u03d5/ \u221a 6\u03b1Mpl )] where \u03d5 is the inflaton field and the parameter \u03b1 corresponds to the inverse curvature of the scalar manifold in the conformal or superconformal realizations of the attractor models. We have studied in particular the cases p = 1, 2, 3 and 4, with the interesting result that the tensor-to-scalar ratio r takes approximately the same value r \u2243 0.0025 in all case. A possibility is that this value of r is being reached in some \u201cuniversal\u201d limit (similar to what happens with the tanhp attractors) where the power p does not play an important role, and thus such parameter is useless to choose a realization preferred by data. To make this choice, we determine the Bayes factor for each case, using p = 2 as the base model, and found that the p = 4 case is preferred by the CMB observations, as shown in the Table 4. Note that the power p in the potential, when expanded around the origin according to the Eq. (2.5), appears only as a multiplicative factor of the quadratic and higher order terms. Thus, the selection made by the statistical analysis is not among potentials with a radically different behaviour around the minimum (as in the tanhp potential of Eq. (2.3)). Instead, it is among quadratic potentials around their minimum with slightly different coefficients.\n\u2013 14 \u2013"
