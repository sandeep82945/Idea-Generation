 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Compare the informativeness of resting-state fMRI and task fMRI data for other cognitive systems and networks beyond the default mode network studied here. The authors suggest the need to cover different networks to make more general conclusions about resting-state fMRI.

2. Investigate how different noise correction methods impact the informativeness of resting-state and task fMRI data. The paper mentions physiological noise as a potential confound, so exploring noise correction techniques could be useful.

3. Test whether similar results hold for other tasks that engage the default mode network, such as false belief, trait judgement or autobiographical memory tasks. This could validate the finding that task fMRI provides more information than resting-state for this network.

4. Apply the analysis approach to patient populations to evaluate optimal imaging protocols for investigating dysfunctional networks relevant to different disorders. The authors suggest this as important for clinical utility.

5. Examine how choices in data analysis steps, like group-level analysis methods for resting-state fMRI, influence the informativeness of the data. The paper points out this could impact the peak coordinates selected for modeling.
