Thus, there have been efforts to guard the perovskite nanocrystals from their surrounding environment by enclosing them in a matrix or shielding them with a protective layer.20\u201322 For instance, perovskite nanocrystals were directly synthesized in diblock copolymer micelles and showed improvement in their stability with the help of the micellar shells.23,24\nDiblock copolymers typically form nanoscale spherical micelles consisting of soluble coronas and insoluble cores, in a selective solvent for the corona block, which can then be processed into a lm by various coating techniques25,26 and can further be combined with functional polymers.27,28 Furthermore, the functionalization of copolymer micelles can be achieved effectively by incorporating nanoscale elements such as nanoparticles, quantum dots, and uorophores into the micelles.29 For example, a single layer of diblock copolymer\niversity, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea. 568; Tel: +82-2-883-2154\ntion (ESI) available.

Green uorescent lms were rst produced by synthesizing CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in diblock copolymer micelles and coating them on various substrates including stretchable elastomers and exible polymers. In the case of a freestanding lm with green uorescence, we observed a good stability of the emission against water. Aer anion exchange reactions, we also obtained blueand red-emitting lms of copolymer micelles having perovskite nanocrystals. Accordingly, by stacking them sequentially, we were able to fabricate a white-emitting lm of copolymer micelles containing only perovskite nanocrystals without the support of other kinds of emissive materials."

Then, to the 2.0 wt% solution (1 mL) of PS-b-P2VP micelles having CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, ZnCl2 or ZnI2 in methanol was added with vigorous stirring.

A micellar lm was obtained by spin-coating, dipcoating, or drop-casting from a solution of PS-b-P2VP micelles having perovskite nanocrystals onto various substrates such as quartz, Si wafers, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomers, and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) lms.

Then, PbBr2 was added to the micellar solution and selectively loaded into the P2VP cores. CsBr dissolved in methanol was nally added to the micellar solution, resulting in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in the P2VP core.\nUpon the addition of CsBr into the micellar solution, we immediately observed green emission. The inset of Fig. 2a shows a green-emitting solution under UV illumination. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum (solid line) from the solution has a maximum intensity at 515 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 21 nm, which matches with the value in previous reports.6,32 It is noted that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in PSb-P2VP micelles showed the quantum yield of 51% and the uorescence lifetime of 8 ns in the ref. 23. In the UV-Vis spectrum (dashed line), we can also nd a characteristic absorption edge of CsPbBr3 near 510 nm. To conrm the formation of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, TEM images were obtained as shown in Fig. 2b. Micelles appear as dim gray spheres with blurred boundaries. Inside the micelles, however, we can distinguish 2\u2013 4 dark nanoparticles of 6 nm in diameter. We note that the hydrodynamic diameter of PS-b-P2VP micelles having CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by DLS is 69 nm (Fig. S1\u2020). The high-resolution TEM image (inset of Fig. 2b) conrms the orthorhombic crystalline structure of the CsPbBr3 perovskite, where the measured values of 4.2 A and 6.0 A for d-spacing correspond to the (200) and (002) lattice planes, respectively. The size of the perovskite nanocrystals in the block copolymer micelles can be modied by adjusting the amount of perovskite precursor or by employing block copolymers with various molecular weights,29 which can affect the absorption and uorescence properties of the perovskite nanocrystals.33\nWe can fabricate a lm consisting of a monolayer of PS-bP2VP micelles by adjusting the coating conditions. Fig. 3a shows an SEM image of a spin-coated monolayer of PS-b-P2VP micelles containing CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, in which the spherical micelles ( 42 nm in diameter) are arranged in a quasihexagonal order with an inter-particle distance of 55 nm without overlapping. A monolayer of micelles was also fabricated by dip-coating (Fig. S2\u2020). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, we can observe uniform green uorescence from a spin-coated monolayer on a quartz substrate. In the PL spectrum of this monolayer (Fig. 3b), the maximum intensity is located at 515 nm with a FWHM of 22 nm, identical to that from the micellar solution (Fig. 2a), implying that the micelles with CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were coated without deterioration.\nIn addition, we prepared a monolayer of PS-b-P2VP micelles having CsPbBr3 nanocrystals on a stretchable PDMS elastomer by spin-coating, which was conrmed by SEM (Fig. S3a\u2020). As shown in Fig. 4, the micelle-coated PDMS elastomer exhibited green uorescence, which was maintained under the extension\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The uorescence spectrum of the stretchable lm (Fig. 4b) is almost identical to that of the monolayer lm (Fig. 3). Aer recovered from extension, the elastomer still showed uorescence without severe defects on the surface, presumably because the micelles arranged in the monolayer can be separated by extending their relative distance without being damaged during extension.34 The monolayer of micelles on the PDMS elastomer was preserved aer extension without deterioration of the spherical shape of the micelles (Fig. S3b\u2020).

With an increase in the amount of ZnCl2, the uorescence color changed from green to light blue and then blue.

It is noted that these PL spectra show relative intensities without normalization, and a PL spectrum of the green emission was obtained using a 1/3 diluted solution due to the high uorescence intensity. We also note that the PL intensities highly decrease aer anion-exchange reactions as reported in the literature.35 The decrease of PL intensities in perovskite nanocrystals aer anion-exchange reactions is associated with deep trap states in the bandgap due to halide vacancies by different anion sizes.36,37\nDue to the weak uorescence intensity from a monolayer of PS-b-P2VP micelles containing perovskite nanocrystals aer anion exchange reactions, a lm consisting of multilayered micelles was fabricated by lowering the spinning speed (1000\n6392 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 6389\u20136395\nrpm) during spin-coating. Fig. 6 is an SEM image of the PS-bP2VP micelles having CsPbBr3 nanocrystals on a Si substrate aer spin-coating. From the top-view image, we can nd that spherical micelles are preserved and randomly arranged overall, although a quasi-hexagonal arrangement can be locally observed. The side-view image (inset of Fig. 6) conrms that the lm thickness ( 129 nm) is larger than the micelle diameter ( 42 nm), indicating a multilayer of micelles.\nA green-emitting lm in Fig. 7 was obtained by the same procedure used to prepare the lm shown in Fig. 6, with the exception of a exible PET lm as substrate. Because of the multilayered micelles having CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, the lm exhibits much brighter uorescence than the monolayer shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. In Fig. 7, we can also observe blue and red emissions from the lms of multilayered micelles with perovskite nanocrystals aer halide exchange reactions, which were prepared under the same spin-coating condition. As shown in the PL spectra given in the photographs, the maximum intensities of blue, green, and red emissions appear at 464 nm, 512 nm, and 660 nm, respectively.

However, the uorescence intensities of both red- and blue-emitting lms were considerably lower than that of the green-emitting lm as shown in the PL spectra given in the photographs. It is worthwhile to note that the emissions of all three colors are apparently unchanged from curved lms as displayed in Fig. 7, presumably because the perovskite nanocrystals are imbedded in polymeric micelles.\nSince uorescent lms in three primary colors of blue, green, and red can be produced as shown in Fig. 7, a white-emitting lm can be expected with combination of PS-b-P2VP micelles containing perovskite nanocrystals. However, there were large variations in the PL intensities of the three colors so that it was necessary to adjust the thickness of each colored layer with a proper coating condition for reasonable white emission. A redemitting lm of micelles was rst drop-casted from a thicker micellar solution (2.0 wt%) compared to a spin-coating solution (0.5 wt%). Then, green- and blue-emitting lms of micelles were sequentially spin-coated onto the red-emitting lm. A thicker solution (2.0 wt%) was also used for the blue-emitting lm. It is\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nnoted that the thickness ( 18 mm) of the white-emitting lm (Fig. S4\u2020) was substantially larger than that ( 129 nm) of the green-emitting lm (Fig. 6). Aer sequential coating of micelles having red-, green-, and blue-emitting perovskite nanocrystals, a PL spectrum of white emission was obtained as shown in Fig. 8, which has three maxima at 462, 517, and 673 nm. Each wavelength of the three maxima corresponds to that in the spectra of the individual lms of three primary colors of perovskite nanoparticles. We note that this observation can be an evidence against halogen migration or segregation, which would be restricted by the stacked structure of the lm as well as by the corona layer encompassing the nanocrystals. The polymeric parts in the lm would suppress the diffusion of halogen anions associated with photo-induced charge carriers.24 The color coordinate of the spectrum is (0.29, 0.31) marked as a white dot in the CIE diagram (inset of Fig. 8), which is close to the white color of (0.31, 0.33). It is worthwhile to note that a white-emitting lm is demonstrated with three primary colors from perovskite nanocrystals in polymeric micelles without other emissive materials.22,38 We also note that a decent choice of emission colors can be expected by adjusting the intensity of each color, based on the trianglemark with three color coordinates of blue, green, and red emissions of the spectrum (inset of Fig. 8).\nTo fabricate a freestanding lm of PS-b-P2VPmicelles having perovskite nanocrystals without a supporting substrate, a lm of the micelles was drop-casted and detached from the substrate. As shown in the inset of Fig. 9, a green-emitting lm of 10 mm in thickness was separated from the substrate without discernible damage and was freely held. Freestanding lms of blue and red emissions were also obtained by dropcasting. Although the lms were immersed in water for longer than 30 min during the detaching process, there was no noticeable deterioration in emissions (Fig. 9), so that we intentionally submerged a green-emitting lm in water (Fig. 10). Aer 30min, the lm well maintained green uorescence (Fig. 9 and 10), indicating that the water-sensitive perovskite nanocrystals were protected by the hydrophobic polystyrene corona of the polymeric micelles.39 In addition, proper protection can apparently be obtained by favor of the lm structure, in which polystyrene coronas overlap with each other, when the extremely low water permeability of polystyrene is considered.40\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 6389\u20136395 | 6393\nFig. 10 A freestanding film of the PS-b-P2VP micelles having greenemitting perovskite nanocrystals immersed in water under UV illumination.
