Exploring Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) Activation: Develop and apply advanced genetic and epigenetic activation techniques to awaken silent or inactive BGCs in Aspergillus strains. This approach could uncover novel polyketides with unique structures and biological activities, expanding the chemical diversity and therapeutic potential of fungal secondary metabolites.

Structural and Functional Analysis of Polyketide Synthases (PKSs): Conduct detailed structural and functional analyses of PKSs involved in polyketide biosynthesis in Aspergillus. Understanding the molecular basis of starter unit selectivity, chain-length control, and post-polyketide modifications could enable the rational design and engineering of PKSs to produce novel polyketides or to improve the production of existing compounds.

Investigation of Polyketides in Symbiotic and Stress-Induced Conditions: Explore the production of polyketides in Aspergillus spp. under symbiotic interactions with other microorganisms or in response to environmental stresses. This research could reveal how microbial interactions and environmental factors influence the biosynthesis of polyketides and may lead to the discovery of novel compounds induced under specific conditions.

Development of Heterologous Expression Systems for Polyketide Production: Establish and optimize heterologous expression systems for the production of Aspergillus-derived polyketides. This could facilitate the scalable production of valuable polyketides that are difficult to obtain from natural fungal cultures, enabling further pharmacological studies and potential commercialization.

Pharmacological Studies and Drug Development from Novel Polyketides:Conduct comprehensive pharmacological evaluations of newly discovered polyketides for a broad range of therapeutic applications, including anticancer, antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory activities. This research could lead to the development of novel drug candidates for various diseases, leveraging the medicinal potential of Aspergillus-derived polyketides.
