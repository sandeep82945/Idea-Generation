 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Apply the Bind&Bite method to other proteins besides HIV-1 envelope to demonstrate broad applicability. Proteins like antibodies, enzymes, or membrane proteins would be interesting targets.

2. Optimize the reaction conditions (pH, temperature, etc) to increase yield and kinetics of the isopeptide bond formation between the coiled-coil peptides. This could make the method faster and more efficient. 

3. Explore the use of different amine-reactive sites (ARS) besides squaramide to vary the reactivity and stability. This could expand the types of chemical modifications that can be attached.

4. Develop orthogonal Bind&Bite systems with different coiled-coil pairs to enable simultaneous dual labeling of proteins. This would allow more complex modifications.

5. Explore performing the Bind&Bite reaction intracellularly by using ARS groups that are stable but still reactive inside cells. This could enable protein labeling and tracking in living systems.
