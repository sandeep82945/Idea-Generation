    "abstractText": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a Gram-positive bacteria, is one of the most common human pathogen responsible for the significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. S. aureus is a human commensal that colonizes the skin surfaces, nasopharynx region, and other parts of the body (axilla, gastrointestinal tract, groin, throat, vagina, etc.) (Braga et al., 2014; Sakr et al., 2018). Although a large number of carriers of S. aureus in a population generally remain asymptomatic (Kumar et al., 2015; Horn et al., 2018), the entry of the bacteria into the bloodstream through any cut or opening in epithelial or mucosal surface can cause serious infections, including endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, etc. and affect vital internal organs, such as heart, bone, lungs, etc. (Lowy, 1998; McCaig et al., 2006; David and Daum, 2017). The biofilm-forming property of S. aureus is an important virulence factor that helps the bacteria in evading host immune system (Davies, 2003) and make it resistant toward conventional antibacterial agents like antibiotics (Vor et al., 2020). Further, biofilm formation by S. aureus on surface of medical implant devices like prosthetic joints, catheters, pace makers, etc. can lead to the failure of device, chronic infection, and need for repeat surgery (Lister and Horswill, 2014; Khatoon et al., 2018). The treatment of S. aureus infection is further critically challenged by the emergence of antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains: methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin\u2010intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), and vancomycin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA). These problems culminate into the significant Abstract Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a pathogenic bacteria that causes a variety of potentially fatal infections. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus has made treatment even more difficult. In recent years, nanoparticles have been used as an alternative therapeutic agent for S. aureus infections. Among various methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles, the method utilizing plant extracts from different parts of a plant, such as root, stem, leaf, flower, seeds, etc. is gaining widespread usage. Phytochemicals present in plant extract are an inexpensive, eco-friendly, natural material that act as reducing and stabilization agent for the nanoparticle synthesis. The utilization of plant-fabricated nanoparticles against S. aureus is currently in trend. The current review discusses recent findings in the therapeutic application of phytofabricated metal-based nanoparticles against Staphylococcus aureus.",

S. aureus is a human commensal that colonizes the skin surfaces, nasopharynx region, and other parts of the body (axilla, gastrointestinal tract, groin, throat, vagina, etc.) (Braga et al., 2014; Sakr et al., 2018). Although a large number of carriers of S. aureus in a population generally remain asymptomatic (Kumar et al., 2015; Horn et al., 2018), the entry of the bacteria into the bloodstream through any cut or opening in epithelial or mucosal surface can cause serious infections, including endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, etc. and affect vital internal organs, such as heart, bone, lungs, etc. (Lowy, 1998; McCaig et al., 2006; David and Daum, 2017). The biofilm-forming property of S. aureus is an important virulence factor that helps the bacteria in evading host immune system (Davies, 2003) and make it resistant toward conventional antibacterial agents like antibiotics (Vor et al., 2020). Further, biofilm formation by S. aureus on surface of medical implant devices like prosthetic joints, catheters, pace makers, etc. can lead to the failure of device, chronic infection, and need for repeat surgery (Lister and Horswill, 2014; Khatoon et al., 2018). The treatment of S. aureus infection is further critically challenged by the emergence of antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains: methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin\u2010intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), and vancomycin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA). These problems culminate into the significant\nKeywords: Staphylococcus aureus, phytofabricated nanoparticles, antibacterial, metal nanoparticles.\nResumo Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) \u00e9 uma bact\u00e9ria patog\u00eanica que causa uma variedade de infec\u00e7\u00f5es potencialmente fatais. O surgimento de cepas de S. aureus resistentes a antibi\u00f3ticos tornou o tratamento ainda mais dif\u00edcil. Nos \u00faltimos anos, as nanopart\u00edculas t\u00eam sido utilizadas como um agente terap\u00eautico alternativo para infec\u00e7\u00f5es por S. aureus. Entre os diversos m\u00e9todos para a s\u00edntese de nanopart\u00edculas, o que utiliza extratos vegetais de diferentes partes de uma planta, como raiz, caule, folha, flor, sementes etc., vem se destacando a partir do uso generalizado.

Compare to chemically synthesized nanoparticles, nanoparticles fabricated via biogenic routes (microbes and plant) are biocompatible (Hakim et al., 2005; Tripp et al., 2002). One major drawback of microbe-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is their slow rate of synthesis (Zhang et al., 2011), and they can also be expensive compared to plant extract based synthesis (Sathishkumar et al., 2010; Mittal et al., 2013). On the other hand, the plant-based method can produce stable nanoparticle at much faster rate than microorganismsbased synthesis (Iravani, 2011). Another advantage of the use of plant extract for the nanoparticles fabrication is the extracellular nature of synthesis that does not call for any downstream processing (Nabikhan et al., 2010). The extracts of various parts, such as roots, stems, flowers, leaves, fruits, seeds, etc. of a plant have been efficiently used for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles in a simple, cost-effective, and environment-friendly method that does not generate toxic chemicals and microbial debris obtained in chemical and microbial methods respectively. The phytochemicals present in the plant extracts serve as both natural reducing and stabilizing agent (Kirubaharan et al., 2012), thus making need for external reducing and stabilizing agent unnecessary. Proteins, amino acids, polysaccharides, enzymes, and secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, terpenoids, etc. present in plant extracts are generally responsible for reducing metal salts to corresponding metal nanoparticles (Akhtar et al., 2013; Mittal et al., 2013; Kuppusamy et al., 2016).\nThe plant-mediated green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles, generally, involves common steps with some minor changes. First, the desired part of plant (root, stem, leaf, flower, seed, fruit, bark, or any extracellular secretion like gum karaya, milk, etc.) is collected from the plant, followed by washing and drying. The next is phytochemical extraction in an appropriate solvent such as water, methanol, ethanol, etc. The extracted fraction then filtered to remove any particulate matter. The next step involves reduction of metal ions by mixing plant extract with the metal salt (example, AgNO3, K2TeO3, H2PtCl2, Zn(NO3)2, CuSO4, HAuCl4, etc.) for which the nanoparticle is desired. Finally the synthesis of nanoparticles using plant extracts is confirmed by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer, followed by the analysis of size and shape using techniques like scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy identify the presence of plant derived functional groups, like aldehyde, amine, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alcohol, phenol, carbonyl, ketone, etc. on the surface of synthesized nanoparticles. Phase identification of crystalline structure is done by X-ray diffraction analysis. Nanoparticles based on metals such as silver, gold, copper, zinc, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium, rare-earth metals, etc. have been successfully synthesized from plants. The present review discusses the utilization of phytofabricated metal nanoparticles for their therapeutic application against S. aureus.\nmorbidity, mortality, and healthcare-associated costs, due to S. aureus-related infections (Schmidt et al., 2015; Klein et al., 2019). Therefore, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains, and consequently increasing risk of lifedebilitating infections, and lack of development in new antibiotics has forced scientist to search novel antibacterial therapeutics such as those based on nanoparticles against S. aureus. Nanoparticles are the core of nanotechnology; these are structures with size in the range of 1 and 100 nm. The features like low toxicity, ability to cross blood-brain barrier, (Parveen et al., 2012), lower proclivity in comparison to the antibiotics to induce resistance by a microbe (Stankic et al., 2016) makes them promising therapeutic alternative against S. aureus. The successful use of metal-based nanoparticles as antibacterial agent against S. aureus have been shown by multiple research studies. The present review highlight the application of such nanoparticles those that synthesized using plant extracts against various S. aureus strains (Figure 1)."

            "text": "Silver is one of the most widely studied metal for its antibacterial properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from the extracts of important medicinal plants like Cannabis sativa (Singh et al., 2018), Withania coagulans (Tripathi et al., 2019), red ginseng (Singh et al., 2016b), Panax ginseng (Singh et al., 2016a), Aloe vera (Abalkhil et al., 2017), Catharanthus roseus (Ahmad et al., 2020), cinnamon (Premkumar et al., 2018) have been exploited successfully against S. aureus. Similarly, several current studies for the elimination of S. aureus have successfully harnessed AgNPs prepared from plant byproducts or plant waste, such as coconut shell (Sinsinwar et al., 2018), corn-cob (Doan et al., 2020), fruit peel (Annu et al., 2018), waste vegetable fibers (Jaybhaye, 2015), sugarcane bagasse (Aguilar et al., 2018), fruit pomace (Vishwasrao et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019), etc. The efficacy of phytofabricated AgNPs against drugresistant S. aureus strains have been reported by multiple studies (Das et al., 2017; Kasithevar et al., 2017; Ansari and Alzohairy, 2018; Qais et al., 2019). Further, AgNPs fabricated via Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract (Ali et al., 2015), tea leaf powder extract (Goswami et al., 2015), red ginseng root extract (Singh et al., 2016b), Ocimum gratissimum leaf extract (Das et al., 2017), Convolvulus arvensis leaf extract (Hamedi et al., 2017), Curcuma aromatica tubers extract (Thomas et al., 2017), yellow bell pepper extract (Ahmed et al., 2018), Hungarian wax pepper and green bell pepper extracts (Lotha et al., 2018), Euphrasia officinalis leaf extract (Singh et al., 2018), garlic clove extract (Vijayakumar et al., 2019), Thymus serpyllum leaf extract (Erci and Torlak, 2019), Nardostachys jatamansi rhizome extract (Muthuraman et al., 2019), Artemisia scoporia plant extract (Moulavi et al., 2019) employed successfully for the inhibition of biofilm formation by S. aureus. Ali et al. (2015) used Eucalyptus globulus leaves extract to prepare AgNPs in a rapid microwave assisted method. The plantfabricated AgNPs at 30 \u03bcg/ml after 24 h of treatment able to inhibit 82\u00b13% biofilm formed by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA. Similarly, Moulavi et al. (2019) in their study showed that Artemisia scoporia plant extract-fabricated AgNPs can inhibit the biofilm formation by clinical multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR) S. aureus strain by affecting the expressions of icaA and icaR genes involved in the biofilm formation and pathogenesis of S. aureus infections. Das et al. (2017) used Ocimum gratissimum leaf extract to prepare AgNPs from silver nitrate salt precursor and investigated their effect on MDR strain of S. aureus. The AgNPs were found to inhibit the biofilm formation by MDR S. aureus, and authors suggested two main steps involved in AgNPs mediated killing of S. aureus: first, the nanoparticles enters into the cell via disrupting the cell membrane, and this followed by induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by nanoparticles.\nPlant-fabricated AgNPs, apart from being used alone, have also been incorporated into material system, such as hydrogels (Jayaramudu et al., 2017; Lustosa et al., 2017; Paul and Londhe, 2019), textile fibers (Zhou and Tang, 2018; Aboutorabi et al., 2019; Maghimaa and Alharbi, 2020), surface coatings (Jyoti and Singh, 2017; Thomas et al., 2017) with capability to inhibit S. aureus infections. Bardania et al.\n(2020) synthesized AgNPs using whole Teucrium polium plant extract and embedded the nanoparticles in poly lactic acid/poly ethylene glycol (PLA/PEG) film. The authors found nanofilms to inhibit the growth of S. aureus in a concentration-dependent manner.\nPlant-fabricated AgNPs have also been used in combination with commercial antibiotics to take advantage of their synergistic antibacterial effect on S. aureus (Gurunathan et al., 2014; Padalia et al., 2015; Jyoti et al., 2016; Hussein et al., 2019). In one such study, AgNPs synthesized from Allophylus cobbe leaf extract exhibited the least minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) value and thus the highest antibacterial activity than conventional antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and vancomycin, against S. aureus (Gurunathan et al., 2014). Moreover, against S. aureus, the combination of phytofabricated AgNPs and tested antibiotics found to be more lethal in comparison to antibiotics or nanoparticles alone (Gurunathan et al., 2014). These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy that involves combination of antibiotics and phytofabricated metal nanoparticles to treat S. aureus infections.\nThe plant synthesized AgNPs have also been investigated for their wound healing efficacy against S. aureus-generated wound in animal models. For instance, phytofabricated AgNPs synthesized from the cranberry powder aqueous extracts exhibited a size-dependent antibacterial activity toward S. aureus in in vitro and also showed wound healing potential for S. aureus-induced wound in a rat model (Ashour et al., 2015). Similarly, Rajasekharreddy et al. (2017), in a an interesting experiment, investigated therapeutic effect of the AgNPs prepared using flavonoids isolated from leaf extract of Ricinus communis L. plant on S. aureus infected silkworm. The flavonoids loaded AgNPs cured S. aureus infection in silkworm by promoting expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and oxidative stress-related genes and phagocytosis of S. aureus in silkworm larvae. Likewise, phytofabricated\nAgNPs loaded with drugs (Jackson et al., 2019) and antibiotic (Harshiny et al., 2015; Shanmuganathan et al., 2018) has also been implicated as therapeutic agents against S. aureus.\nFinally, other silver-based nanoparticles such as Ag2O (Khatun et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2019; Maheshwaran et al., 2020; Rashmi et al., 2020; Vinay et al., 2020), AgO (Mahlaule-Glory et al., 2019), AgCl (Huo et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2018; K\u00fc\u00fcnal et al., 2019) have been effectively synthesized using plant extracts and reported for their efficacy against S. aureus."

Further, there are some studies that took advantages of mixture of extracts from two different plants for the synthesis of AuNPs with potential against S. aureus. For example, in a very exciting study Muthukumar et al. (2016) compared the antibacterial activities against S. aureus of AuNPs fabricated from leaf extracts of either Carica papaya or Catharanthus roseus and AuNPs fabricated from the mixture of leaf extracts of these two plants. In comparison to AuNPs fabricated from leaf extract of either of the plant, the AuNPs synthesized using mixture of leaf extracts of both the plants exhibited highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Likewise, Awad et al. (2019) utilized mixture of Olea europaea fruit extract and Acacia nilotica husk extract as reducing and stabilizing agent for the synthesis of AuNPs and reported its antibacterial activity against S. aureus.\nDue to the reports of lack of antibacterial activities for phytofabricated AuNPs against S. aureus by some studies (Gopinath et al., 2014; Patra and Baek, 2016; Singh et al., 2016a; Chokkalingam et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2018; Chahardoli et al., 2019; Vo et al., 2019), the importance of plant species on nature of fabricated gold nanoparticles and their capacity to kill S. aureus could not be more emphasized. Similarly, parts of a plant species can also be a determining factor for the antibacterial capability of phytofabricated AuNPs against S. aureus. To give an example, in a recent study of Moustafa and Alomari (2019), AuNPs synthesized from the leaf extract of plant Peganum harmala L exhibited bactericidal activity against S. aureus, whereas AuNPs obtained from the seed extract of the same plant did not show any activity toward S. aureus. The main factor for such contrasting effect was attributed to the difference in the nature of bioreductants, in this case polyols present in the two extracts, that gave rise to different biocapping reduction pathways and thus to AuNPs with different characteristics: leaf extract contained higher molecular weight polyol molecule and produced monodispersed and isotropic AuNPs, whereas seed extract contained lower molecular weight polyol molecules and produced polydispersed and anisotropic AuNPs.\nSimilar to the phytofabricated AgNPs, phytofabricated AuNPs loaded into clothes fibers have also emerged as therapeutic alternative against S. aureus (Ganesan and Prabu, 2019; Ullah et al., 2019). Apart from this, the synergistic combination of plant generated AuNPs with commercial antibiotics is another therapeutic strategy that have been utilized abundantly against S. aureus (Ahmed et al., 2014; Nagajyothi et al., 2014; Kalita et al., 2016)."

Hassanien et al. (2018) for the first time used leaves extract of Tilia plant for the preparation of CuNPs. The spherical shaped CuNPs with average size between 4.7 and 17.4 nm exhibited excellent antibacterial activity toward S. aureus. The CuNPs loaded with rifampicin inhibited the growth of S. aureus by penetrating the bacterial cell, bringing changes in its morphology, and damaging its genomic DNA. In an interesting approach, Rezaie et al. (2017) used ashes of burnt leaves and stems of Seidlitzia rosmarinus plant for the in-situ fabrication of cauliflowerlike copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) on the polyester fabric. The polyester fabric loaded with biosynthesized CuONPs was found to possess antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Similar application of CuONPs was shown by Vasantharaj et al. (2019) who used aqueous leaf extract of Ruellia tuberosa plant to prepare CuO nanorods with size range of 20\u2013100 nm and coated the nanoparticles on the cotton fabric. The CuONPs alone and coated on cotton fabric were reported to be active against S. aureus. Similarly, Sathiyavimal et al.

Spherical shaped PdNPs with 27\u00b12 nm size were prepared using Moringa oleifera peel extract in a microwave assisted green synthesis and found to be lethal to the S. aureus (Surendra et al., 2016). Polyhydroxy compounds present in the Phyllanthus emblica seed extract were responsible for the reduction of palladium acetate into PdNPs in the study of Dinesh et al. (2017). The green PdNPs were spherical with average size 28\u00b12 nm and able to kill the S. aureus in agar well diffusion assay (Dinesh et al., 2017). Similarly, PdNPs fabricated via aqueous extract of plant Sapium sebiferum were found to control the growth of S. aureus (Tahir et al., 2016). Bhakyaraj et al. (2017) used palladium chloride as precursor and Melia azedarach leaf extract as bioreductant and stabilizer for the synthesis of PdNPs with average size of 10 nm and showed the effectiveness of the nanoparticles against S. aureus. Gnanasekar et al. (2018) also used palladium chloride as precursor, but they took advantage of medicinal plant Couroupita guianensis fruit extract to obtain PdNPs. The active phenolic compounds present in the fruit extract were reported to be responsible for the reduction of metal salt and formation of PdNPs. Further, the spherical shaped PdNPs with size between 5 and 15 nm were effective against S. aureus (Gnanasekar et al., 2018)."

Cubic and rectangular shaped platinum nanoparticle (PtNPs) with particle size of 22 nm were prepared using leaf extract of Xanthium strumarium plant by Kumar et al. (2019). The phytofabricated PtNPs were capped with hydroxyl and amino functional groups and exhibited antibacterial activity toward S. aureus. Similarly, aqueous leaf extracts of medicinal herbs Jatropha gossypifolia and Jatropha glandulifera were used as bioreductant to prepare PtNPs from the precursor hexachloroplatinic acid in the study of Jeyapaul et al. (2018). The chemical groups like amine, carboxyl, and carbonyl present in leaf extract of both plants played a major role in the reduction of hexachloroplatinic acid to PtNPs that demonstrated antibacterial activities against S. aureus in disc diffusion assay (Jeyapaul et al., 2018). Very recently, Selvi et al. (2020) utililzed Tragia involucrata leaf extract for the fabrication of PtNPs. Proteins and secondary metabolites such as polyphenols, alkaloids, and flavonoids significantly contributed in the formation of PtNPs by reducing the precursor hexachloroplatinic\nBrazilian Journal of Biology, 2022, vol. 82, e268052 7/17\nacid.

Many studies synthesized cerium oxide (Ce2O3) nanoparticles via plants such as Acalypha indica (Kannan and Sundrarajan, 2014), Moringa oleifera (Surendra and Roopan, 2016; Valsaraj and Divyarthana, 2019), watermelon (Yadav et al., 2016), Gloriosa superba (Arumugam et al., 2015), Leucas aspera (Malleshappa et al., 2015), and Olea europaea (Maqbool et al., 2016) and reported their inhibitory effect on S. aureus growth. Nanosheets of dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3) with size range 100\u2013200 nm were fabricated using Syzygium travancoricum leaf extract and formed significant zone of inhibition against S. aureus in disc diffusion assay (Gopinath et al., 2017). In the recent research by Kumar et al. (2020), Mutingia calabura leaf extract was applied to reduce lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate into lanthanum nanoparticles.

Such nanoparticles generally provide enhanced antibacterial activities than their monometallic counterpart. Plant extracts have also been used to fabricate variety of multimetallic nanoparticles with application against S. aureus. For example, in a comparative study the authors synthesized nanoparticles of monometallic Ag and Au, and bimetallic Ag-Au from the bark extract of Guazuma ulmifolia L. plant (Karthika et al., 2017). The highest antibacterial activity against\nS. aureus was shown by Ag-Au alloy nanoparticles followed by AgNPs, whereas AuNPs did not show any activity (Karthika et al., 2017). Similarly, AgNPs, AuNPs, and bimetallic AgAuNPs were fabricated using aqueous root extract of Plumbago zeylanica plant by Salunke et al. (2014). The phytofabricated monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles demonstrated inhibitory activity against S. aureus. Yallappa et al. (2015) using aqueous leaves extract of Jasminum sambac successfully synthesized Au, Ag, and Ag-Au alloy nanoparticles. The authors reported the highest antimicrobial activity for Au\u2013Ag alloy nanoparticles than monometallic AuNPs and AgNPs against S. aureus.\nKombaiah et al. (2018) prepared single phase cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (CoFe2O4NPs) using okra extract as a reducing agent and demonstrated their antibacterial property against S. aureus. Similarly, bimetallic core-shell Cu-Pt nanoparticles prepared from the extract of shoots and leaves of Agrimoniae herba plant have been found to be toxic for S. aureus, with the MIC and MBC value of 16.7\u00b15.8 \u03bcg/mL and 33.3\u00b111.6 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Dobrucka and Dlugaszewska, 2018). Karthikeyan et al. (2019) employed Gymnema sylvestre leaf extracts to prepare lanthanum doped ZnONPs (33 nm), cerium doped ZnONPs (27 nm), and neodymium doped ZnONPs (23 nm), with varied shapes like spherical, spindle, hexagonal, and flake. Among all the phytofabricated nanoparticles, ZnONPs doped with lanthanum showed the best antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Similarly, many other phytofabricated multimetallic nanoparticles, such as Au-CuO and CuO-ZnO from Cnici benedicti flower extract (Dobrucka et al., 2019), Ag-Ni from Canna indica leaf extract (Akinsiku et al., 2018), Ag-Au from Annona squamosa extract (Syed et al., 2019), ZnO-CuO from Mentha longifolia leaf extract (MohammadiAloucheh et al., 2018), Ag-Pd from Terminalia chebula fruit extract (Sivamaruthi et al., 2019), Cu-doped ZnO from Clerodendrum infortunatum leaf extract (Khan et al., 2018), ZnFe2O4 from Limonia acidissima fruit extract (Naik et al., 2019), Ag-Pd core-shell nanoparticle from almond nut and blackberry fruit extract (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2017), ZnOAg from Mirabilis jalapa leaf extract (Sumbal et al., 2019), AgNPs decorated magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposites from Matricaria chamomile flower extract (Ocsoy et al., 2017), ZnO-Ag nanocomposites from Thymus vulgaris leaf extract (Zare et al., 2019), and Ag\u2013Fe3O4 from Crataegus pinnatifida leaf extract (Li and Yang, 2016), etc. have been successfully used for their antibacterial propensities against S. aureus.

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for multitude of life-threatening infection, and emergence of its drugresistant strains has created challenge for its therapy. Plant extract are the cheap source for diverse phytochemicals that can be used as reducing and stabilizing agent in the nanoparticles synthesis process. The phytofabricated nanoparticles of various metals (Ag, Au, Cu, Zn, Ni, Pd, Pt, rare-earth metals, etc.), metal oxide (CuO, ZnO, NiO, TiO2, iron oxide, etc.), and multimetals have emerged as a novel therapeutic alternative to conventional antibiotics to restrict S. aureus infection. Further, the effectiveness of phytofabricated metal nanoparticles against S. aureus hinge on the type of plant and parts (seed, flower, root, leaves, stems, bark, gum, peel, etc.) of a plant. The encouraging results of phytofabricated metal nanoparticles against S. aureus must be strengthened with the studies on their cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Similarly, understanding the mechanism of killing of S. aureus by phytofabricated metal nanoparticles is also necessary to overcome the possibility of S. aureus resistance to nanoparticles (Elbehiry et al., 2019). Therefore, for S. aureus-associated infections, phytofabricated metal nanoparticles can be a long-term viable solution in clinical settings and further present opportunities for future research."
