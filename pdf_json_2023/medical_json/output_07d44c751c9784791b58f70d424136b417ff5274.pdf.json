    "abstractText": "As the unique cell type in articular cartilage, chondrocyte senescence is a crucial cellular event contributing to osteoarthritis development. Here we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis and activation of Notch signaling promotes chondrocyte senescence and osteoarthritis development, which is negatively regulated by myosin light chain 3. Myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) protein levels decline sharply in senescent chondrocytes of cartilages from model mice and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Conditional deletion of Myl3 in chondrocytes significantly promoted, whereas intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus overexpressingMYL3 delayed, OA progression inmale mice. MYL3 deficiency led to enhanced clathrin-mediated endocytosis by promoting the interaction between myosin VI and clathrin, further inducing the internalization of Notch and resulting in activation of Notch signaling in chondrocytes. Pharmacologic blockade of clathrin-mediated endocytosisNotch signaling prevented MYL3 loss-induced chondrocyte senescence and alleviated OA progression in male mice. Our results establish a previously unknownmechanism essential for cellular senescence and provide a potential therapeutic direction for OA.",

Here we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis and activation of Notch signaling promotes chondrocyte senescence and osteoarthritis development, which is negatively regulated by myosin light chain 3. Myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) protein levels decline sharply in senescent chondrocytes of cartilages from model mice and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Conditional deletion of Myl3 in chondrocytes significantly promoted, whereas intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus overexpressingMYL3 delayed, OA progression inmale mice. MYL3 deficiency led to enhanced clathrin-mediated endocytosis by promoting the interaction between myosin VI and clathrin, further inducing the internalization of Notch and resulting in activation of Notch signaling in chondrocytes. Pharmacologic blockade of clathrin-mediated endocytosisNotch signaling prevented MYL3 loss-induced chondrocyte senescence and alleviated OA progression in male mice. Our results establish a previously unknownmechanism essential for cellular senescence and provide a potential therapeutic direction for OA.\nCellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest, which has been noted as one of the hallmarks of aging1,2. The typical features of senescent cells include elevated expression of p21-, p16INK4A-, and p53positive staining for senescence-associated \u03b2\u2011galactosidase, and secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors3,4. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic and disabling joint disorder with multiple risk factors including age, obesity, trauma, genetics, and sex, which aging is the most prominent one5,6. Chondrocytes, a unique cell type in cartilage tissue, undergo cellular senescence with aging and contribute to dysregulation of anabolic and catabolic homeostasis in cartilage during OA development7\u20139.

However, the occurrence and regulatorymechanismof chondrocyte senescence has not yet been fully addressed.\nRecent reports have elaborated that disrupted endocytosis including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), the major endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells, is involved in cellular senescence13\u201315. CME controls the transport of the majority of transmembrane receptors and transporters from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm with the aid of a clathrin coat16,17. Although this transport is essential for numerous cellular processes, such as the maintenance of membrane homeostasis and the regulation of intercellular signaling18, the role of CME in chondrocyte senescence and OA development has not been reported.\nThe myosins are a large family of actin-activated mechanoenzymes that generate force and movement along actin filaments by hydrolyzing ATP to produce mechanical energy19,20. Previous studies have identified several myosins as specific binding partners of clathrin that associate with clathrin-coated structures (CCS), among which myosin VI (MYO6) serves as a motor protein to move CCS into the cell by moving towards the minus ends of actin filaments21\u201323.\nIn this study, we uncovered the vital role of myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) in CME-mediated Notch signaling activation and chondrocyte senescence. Loss of MYL3 in chondrocytes leads to enhanced CME by promoting the interaction between MYO6 and clathrin, and consequently induces the internalization of Notch receptors and nuclear translocation of Notch intracellular domain (NICD), resulting in the activation of Notch signaling, chondrocyte senescence and OA."

            "text": "CME is enhanced andMYL3 expression is decreased in senescent chondrocytes To investigate the role of CME in chondrocyte senescence, we examined endocytosis of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated transferrin as amarker of general CME. Primary chondrocytes at passage seven or with H2O2 treatment displayed senescence phenotypes with increased senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) positivity and p16INK4a expression (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a).We also noticed a stronger transferrin uptake and enhanced biotinylated transferrin uptake (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), indicating that CME is enhanced in senescent chondrocytes.\nFurther, to explore themechanisms that control CME and cellular senescence in chondrocytes, we performed proteome-wide screening with articular cartilage from young (2-month-old) and aged (12-monthold)mice. In the3171 proteins identified,MYL3, amemberbelonging to the myosin families which known to be involved in the regulation of CME, was found to be the most downregulated protein among the myosin families in the cartilage of agedmice compared to youngmice. (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1). Next, immunofluorescence (IF) staining of MYL3 was performed in articular cartilage from mice aged 2, 12, and 24 months, and we confirmed that as cartilage degeneration progressed, Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores, markers for senescence (p16INK4a), DNA damage (\u03b3-H2AX), and CME (MYO6 and clathrin) in articular chondrocytes were all upregulated. However, the ratio of MYL3-positive chondrocytes in aged mice was significantly lower compared with that in young mice (Fig. 1d, e, Supplementary Fig. 1d). In addition, we confirmed the reduced expression of MYL3 in damaged cartilage compared to intact human cartilages, accomplishedwith increased senescence, DNAdamage, and CME markers (Fig. 1f, g, Supplementary Fig. 1e). Additionally, in the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgeryinduced posttraumatic OA mice model, we also detected\nsignificantlydecreasedMYL3 levelwith enhanced senescenceandCME in chondrocytes of articular cartilage alongwith the progression ofOA (Fig. 1h, i, Supplementary Fig. 1f). Western blot analysis showed that chondrocytes at passage seven or chondrocytes exposed to H2O2 displayed increased protein levels of senescence markers and decreased protein levels of MYL3 (Supplementary Fig. 1g, h).\nTaken together, thesedata demonstrated that CME is enhanced in senescent chondrocytes, while MYL3 is reduced during chondrocyte senescence and OA progression.\nMYL3 inhibits CME and protects chondrocytes against cellular senescence We then explored the role of MYL3 in CME and cellular senescence in chondrocytes. Firstly,we tracedCMEby co-stainingMYO6andclathrin in chondrocytes at different passages and observed elevated CME at passage seven compared with passage two (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Inhibition of CME process through pharmacological (dynasore) or genetic (clathrin knockdown or enforced DynK44A mutant expression) approaches decreased the levels of senescence markers at different passages or with H2O2 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). These data suggest that inhibition of CME process protect against senescent in chondrocytes. Next, in chondrocytes with Myl3 knockdown lentivirus (Myl3-KD), we noticed a stronger transferrin uptake than control, while overexpression of Myl3 showed less (Fig. 2a). Consistent with the results of H2O2 stimulation, knockdown of Myl3 enhanced, while overexpression of Myl3 (Myl3-OE) inhibited, transferrin uptake (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To illustrate how MYL3 regulated CME, we tested whether MYL3 interacted with MYO6 or clathrin, two major regulators of CME. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed thatMYL3 interacted withMYO6, but did not bind to clathrin (Fig. 2b, c). In chondrocytes stimulated by H2O2, the interaction, and co-localization of MYO6 and clathrin were enhanced compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Moreover, following Myl3 knockdown, we noted that the interaction between MYO6 and clathrin was strengthened but was restrained when MYL3 was overexpressed (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3b). Using IF double staining, we confirmed that in chondrocytes of passage sevenorwithH2O2 stimulation, co-locatedMYO6 and clathrin were enhanced byMyl3 knockdown and decreased when MYL3 was overexpressed (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 3c). We noticed that knockdown of Myl3 enhanced SA-\u03b2-Gal activity and the protein level of senescence markers and SASP factor (Mmp13) at bothpassages two and seven,while overexpressionofMyl3 showed opposite effects (Fig. 2f\u2013i). Moreover, following treatment with H2O2, knockdown of Myl3 also significantly increased SA-\u03b2-Gal activity and elevated the protein level of senescencemarkers and SASP factor, while overexpression of Myl3 exerted the opposite effects (Supplementary Fig. 3d\u2013f). Taken together, our data indicate that MYL3 negatively regulates CME to protect against cellular senescence in chondrocytes by inhibiting the interaction between MYO6 and clathrin.\nDeletion of MYL3 in chondrocytes promotes chondrocyte senescence and OA progression in mice Next, we generated Col2a1-Cre: Myl3fl/fl (Myl3-KO) conditional knockout mice and Col2a1-CreERT2:Myl3fl/fl (Myl3-iKO) inducible conditional knockout mice. The Myl3-KO mice exhibited similar gross appearance and morphology at embryonic day 18.5 and at 3 months of age (Supplementary Fig. 4a\u2013d), while the organization of the growth plates and body weights were also comparable with those of control mice (Supplementary Fig. 4e\u2013h). These data indicated that deletion of Myl3 in chondrocytes did not affect the skeletal development of the mice.\nNext, the histopathological changes of joints in aged Myl3-KO mice were analyzed (Fig. 3a). IHC analysis confirmed the knockout efficiency with decreased expression in chondrocytes from 6- and 18-\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6190 2\nmonth-old Myl3-KO mice (Fig. 3b). We found that the cartilage destruction in 6-month-old Myl3-KO mice was worse, and became more severe at 18 months of age, accompanied with aggravated synovial inflammation but comparable osteophytematurity compared with age-matched control mice (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Accordingly, the OARSI scores, as well as synovial inflammation scores were both significantly increased in agedMyl3-KOmice (Fig. 3d). IF and IHC analysis confirmed the dramatically increased expression of senescence (p16INK4a), DNA damage (\u03b3-H2AX), and catabolic marker (MMP13), as well as decreased nuclear level of HMGB1 in the cartilage of aged Myl3-KO mice (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5b). Subsequently, male Myl3-iKO mice and control littermates were used to\nFig. 1 | CME is enhanced and MYL3 expression is decreased in senescent chondrocytes. a Images and quantification of SA-\u03b2-Gal positivity and IF staining of p16INK4A in mouse primary chondrocytes at passage 2 and 7. n = 5, bars = 25\u03bcm. b Images and quantification of transferrin endocytosis in mouse primary chondrocytes at passages 2 and 7. n = 5, bars = 25\u03bcm. c Quantification of the relative expression of myosins with a proteome-wide screen for the proteins of articular cartilage from 2- or 12-month-old mice. d Images of Safranin-O and IF staining of MYL3, p16INK4A, \u03b3H2AX and quantification (e) of OARSI scores, MYL3-, p16INK4A- and \u03b3H2AX-positive cells and in articular cartilage from 2-, 12- and 24-month-old mice, blue indicates DAPI staining of nuclei. n = 8, bars = 50\u03bcm. f Images of Safranin-O, IHC of MYL3 and p16INK4A, and IF staining of \u03b3H2AX and quantification of OARSI,\nMYL3-, p16INK4A- and \u03b3H2AX-positive cells (g) in intact (n = 5) and damaged (n = 9) articular cartilage sections collected from OA patients.

IHC analysis confirmed the knockout efficiency in chondrocytes from Myl3-iKO mice after tamoxifen injection (Fig. 3g). Unsurprisingly, histological examination showed more severe OA progression at both 6- and 10 weeks post DMM surgery in Myl3-iKO mice, as evidenced by reduced cartilage areas, aggravated synovial inflammation, partiallyincreased osteophyte maturity, and markedly increased OARSI scores (Fig. 3h, i and Supplementary Fig. 5c). IHC analysis demonstrated enhanced cellular senescence with increased senescencemarker, DNA damage, and catabolicmarker, as well as the decreased nuclear level of HMGB1 in cartilage fromMyl3-iKOmice comparedwith controlmice at 6- and 10weeks post DMM surgery (Fig. 3j and Supplementary Fig. 5d). Therefore, these results reveal that Myl3 deletion resulted in accelerated OA development by promoting chondrocyte senescence. Overexpression ofMYL3 attenuates development of age-related and experimental OA in mice To explore the role of upregulated MYL3 in chondrocytes and in OA pathogenesis, adeno-associated virus encoding Myl3 overexpression plasmid was intra-articularly injected into wild-type mice (Myl3-OE). The histopathological changes of joints in Myl3-OE mice were then analyzed at 6 months and 18 months of age (Fig. 4a). IHC analysis showed significantly elevated MYL3 expression in the articular cartilage of Myl3-OE mice compared with controls (Fig. 4b). Histological examination showed that the cartilage destruction and proteoglycan loss were significantly ameliorated, while OARSI scores were significantly lower in aged Myl3-OE mice compared with controls, while the synovial inflammation and osteophyte maturity were not changed (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6a).

We also analyzed the influence of MYL3 overexpression on posttraumatic OA (Fig. 4f). Consistently, increased protein abundances of MYL3 were confirmed in the articular cartilage of Myl3-OE mice (Fig. 4g). Amelioration of DMM-induced cartilage breakage was observed at both 6- and 10 weeks post-surgery, but synovial inflammation was only improved at 10 weeks post-surgery (Fig. 4h, i and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Furthermore, IHC analysis showed decreased senescence, DNA damage, and catabolic marker, as well as increased nuclear level of HMGB1 expression inMyl3-OE mouse cartilage after DMM surgery (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Fig. 6d). Thus, our data suggest that overexpression of MYL3 ameliorates age-related and posttraumatic OAmanifestations in mice through suppression of chondrocyte senescence.\nLoss of MYL3 promotes the activation of Notch signaling and induces senescence by enhancing CME To comprehensively discuss the underlying mechanisms through which MYL3 regulates chondrocyte senescence, we performed RNA sequencing analysis with primary chondrocytes from Myl3-KO and control mice. Among the 142 differentially expressed genes, 99 genes were upregulated and 43 genes were downregulated in Myl3-KO chondrocytes versus controls. The representative top 20 most significantly upregulated genes with altered expression are shown in Supplementary Table 2. From these we focused on the Notch transcription factor Hes1, which was upregulated 4.8-fold (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis revealed an enrichment in differentially-regulated genes associated with Notch signaling (Supplementary Table 3, Fig. 5b). To validate these results, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were performed and the results confirmed that Myl3 deletion enhanced expression of Notch-related (HES1, HEY1 and NICD) and senescence-related genes (p16, p53) (Fig. 5c, d). IF staining confirmed the enhancement of NICD in the DMM model, age-related\nOA, and damaged cartilage from OA patients (Supplementary Fig. 7a\u2013c), suggesting that Notch signaling is activated in senescent chondrocytes in vivo.\nGenetic studies suggest that activationofNotch signaling requires CME24, so we then questioned whether MYL3 regulated Notch signaling while blocking CME. First, we confirmed that Notch signaling is activated via CME in senescent chondrocytes, as the co-localization of NICD and clathrin were enhanced following treatment with jag1 recombinant protein (Fig. 5e).We also found that the co-localization of NICD with clathrin was enhanced in senescent chondrocytes or in cartilage from Myl3-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e), confirming that Notch signaling is activated in senescent chondrocytes via CME process in vivo. The enhanced expression and co-localization of NICD with clathrin, RAB5, or RAB7 caused by jag1 treatment could be blocked by treatment with the Notch pathway inhibitor RO4929097, dynasore or MYL3 overexpression (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Compared with control, Myl3-KO chondrocytes had enhanced expression of NICD and its co-localization with Clathrin, RAB5, or RAB7, which could be eliminated via treating with RO4929097 or CME inhibitor dynasore, DynK44A overexpression or clathrin knockdown (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. 9a\u2013c). Western blot analysis showed that expression of p16INK4a, p53, \u03b3H2AX, HES1, and HEY1 were all upregulated with jag1 treatment but downregulated in jag1 with RO4929097, dynasore, and MYL3 overexpression treatment (Fig. 5g). Upregulated expression of p16INK4a, p53, \u03b3H2AX, HES1, and HEY1 caused by Myl3 knockout could be recovered with RO4929097, dynasore, DynK44A overexpression or clathrin knockdown (Fig. 5h). Moreover, we observed that the constitutively active form of Notch (extracellular domain-deprived Notch mutant, Notch-DeltaE) could upregulate the expression of p16INK4a, p53, \u03b3H2AX, HES1, and HEY1, which could be reversed byRO4929097,MYL3 overexpression, dynasore, and clathrin knockdown (Fig. 5i).\nFurther, we noticed that jag1 treatment orMyl3-KO promoted the senescence of chondrocytes with enhanced SA-\u03b2-Gal activities and\nFig. 3 | Deletion of MYL3 in chondrocytes promotes chondrocytes senescence and OA progression in mice. a Schematic illustration of the spontaneous agerelated OAmodel in control andMyl3-KOmice. b Images and quantification of IHC staining of MYL3, Safranin-O staining images (c), OARSI and synovial inflammation scores (d), and IF staining images of p16INK4A and \u03b3H2AX (e) in sagittal sections of joints from control and Myl3-KO mice at 6 months and 18 months. n = 8 independent biological replicates per group, bars = 50\u03bcm. f Schematic illustration of posttraumaticOAmodelwithDMMsurgery in control andMyl3-iKOmice.g Images\nand quantification of IHC staining of MYL3, Safranin-O staining images (h), OARSI and synovial inflammation scores (i), and IF staining images of p16INK4A and \u03b3H2AX (j) in sagittal sections of joints from control andMyl3-iKO mice at 6- and 10- weeks post-surgery. n = 8 independent biological replicates per group, bars = 50\u03bcm.

Western blot analysis showed that expression of p16INK4a, p53, \u03b3H2AX, HES1, and HEY1 were all upregulated in Myl3-KO chondrocytes but downregulated inMyl3-OE orMyl3-KOwith inhibitor treatment (Supplementary Fig. 10a\u2013d). Consistently, we found similar changes of SA-\u03b2-Gal activity in Myl3-KO, Myl3-OE, and Myl3-KO with inhibitor chondrocytes exposed to H2O2 (Supplementary Fig. 10e).\nThese data indicate that loss of MYL3 activates Notch signaling and induces senescence by enhancing CME, pharmacologic targeting of Notch signaling or inhibition of CME through pharmacological and genetic approaches prevents cellular senescence caused by MYL3 depletion in vitro.\nInhibition of CME-Notch signaling prevents MYL3 loss-induced chondrocyte senescence and alleviates age-related and experimental OA Toconfirm the critical role of targetingMYL3 andCME-Notch signaling in chondrocyte senescence, we compared the protective effect of the Notch pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and the CME inhibitor dynasore on theprogression of posttraumatic or age-relatedOA inMYL3-KOand control mice. As expected, intraarticular injections of dynasore attenuated cartilage destruction in both control and Myl3-iKO mice at 6 weeks post-surgery. The severity of DMM-induced OA in Myl3-iKO mice was comparable to that in control mice after dynasore treatment (Fig. 6b, c, Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). Moreover, dynasore treatment significantly inhibited Notch signaling, eliminated senescent chondrocytes, and decreased SASP secretion in cartilages from both control and Myl3-iKO mice, as the expression of MMP13, NICD, HES1, p16INK4a, and \u03b3H2AX were all downregulated and nuclear HMGB1 was upregulated (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 11c). Further, we used RO4929097 to treat Myl3-iKO and control mice after DMM surgery\n(Fig. 6e). At 6 weeks post-surgery, mice treated with RO4929097 showed markedly reduced cartilage degeneration in comparison with vehicle treatment alone, as demonstrated by increased Safranin-O staining for proteoglycans, cartilage thickness and normalized OARSI scores. The severity of DMM-induced OA in Myl3-iKO mice was also comparable with that in control mice after RO4929097 treatment (Fig. 6f, g, Supplementary Fig. 12a). IHC staining confirmed the diminished numbers of senescent chondrocytes, decreased SASP factor and inhibited Notch signaling in articular cartilage of control and Myl3-iKO mice treated with RO4929097 (Fig. 6h, Supplementary\nFig. 12b, c). Additionally, intraarticular injections of RO4929097 in both control and Myl3-KO mice at 18 months of age showed similar changes (Supplementary Fig. 13). Together, our data suggest that pharmacologic targeting of CME-Notch signaling in vivo would reduce the number of senescent chondrocytes and decrease SASP secretion, ultimately alleviating age-related and experimental OA."

However, how to define chondrocyte senescence and determine the underlying mechanisms remain key challenges for developing targeted therapy in OA27. With articular cartilage from aged mice, we screened and found that MYL3 expression was significantly reduced compared to young cartilage. In cultured chondrocytes and OA cartilage, we noticed that MYL3 expression negatively correlated with p21 and p16INK4A, two major proteins that act as mediators of cell cycle arrest, which is associated with senescence. In vivo conditional deletion of Myl3 in chondrocytes significantly promoted, whereas intraarticular injection of adenoassociated virus expressing MYL3 delayed, OA progression. Our data identify MYL3 as a negative indicator of chondrocyte senescence and OA progression.\nFig. 4 | Overexpression of MYL3 attenuates age-related and experimental OA development in mice. a Schematic illustration of Ad-Myl3 or Ad-control delivery schedules in an age-related OA model in mice. b Images and quantification of IHC staining of MYL3, Safranin-O staining images (c), OARSI and synovial inflammation scores (d), and IF staining images of p16INK4A and \u03b3H2AX (e) in sagittal sections of joints from control and Myl3-OE mice at 6 months and 18 months. n = 8 independent biological replicates per group, bars = 50\u03bcm. f Schematic illustration of AdMyl3 or Ad-control delivery schedules in a posttraumatic OA model with DMM surgery in mice. g Images and quantification of IHC staining of MYL3, Safranin-O\nstaining images (h), OARSI and synovial inflammation scores (i), and IF staining images of p16INK4A and \u03b3H2AX (j) in sagittal sections of joints from control andMyl3OEmice at6- and 10weeks post surgery;n = 8 independent biological replicates per group, bars = 50\u03bcm.

Aberrant endocytosis contributes to cellular senescence. CME and caveolaemediated endocytosis represent major types of endocytosis that are implicated in senescence30,31. Previous studies claimed that senescent fibroblasts downregulate amphiphysin 1 among the CME components, coincident with reduced endocytosis of transferrin receptors14. However, the elevation of transferrin expression was found in our study, indicating that CME was enhanced in senescent chondrocytes, which was in accordance with an early study that showed an increase in the rate and degree of endocytosis in aged chondrocytes32. More importantly, reduced CMEwas previously demonstrated to be insufficient to induce senescence, as knockdown of clathrin adaptor complex AP2 causes growth arrest but does not recapitulate the senescent phenotype15. Mechanistically, we found thatMYL3negatively regulates CME by inhibiting the interaction between MYO6 and clathrin. This study investigates the role of MYL3 in CME, and suggests that MYL3 may act as a negative meditator of CME in senescent cells. Our data reveals a previously unexplored molecular mechanism for enhanced CME, with loss of MYL3 promoting chondrocyte senescence in vivo and in vitro, and establishes the vital role of CME and MYL3 in the progression of OA. To elucidate how increased CME caused by MYL3 deletion in chondrocytes promotes senescence, we carried out RNA sequencing and noted that the Notch pathway may be the most probable downstream signaling pathway of MYL3 and CME in chondrocytes. Previous studies have proved that endocytosis plays an important role in the activation and regulation of Notch signaling24,33,34, and activated Notch signaling triggers cellular senescence, characterized by increased p53 and p21 expression35,36. In our study, we found robust increased p21 expression and SA-\u03b2-gal activity in Myl3 knockout chondrocytes, as\nFig. 5 | Loss of MYL3 promotes the activation of Notch signaling and induces senescence by enhancing CME. a Volcano plot of RNA-seq of primary chondrocytes from control and Myl3-KO mice.

Overall, we conclude that MYL3 plays a negative role in CME-mediated Notch signaling activation and cellular senescence. Multiple studies have demonstrated that Notch signaling is a critical regulator of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte differentiation38, but the exact role of Notch signaling in OA development remains controversial39. Sustained Notch activation in joint cartilage leads to early and progressive OA, while transient Notch activation results in enhanced synthesis of cartilage matrix and maintenance of cartilage40,41. Conditional deletion of RBPj or HES1 to inhibit Notch signaling in chondrocytes ameliorates experimental OA, but inhibition of Notch signaling by overexpression of a Notch1 antisense construct enhances chondrocyte hypertrophy and exacerbates experimental OA42,43. In our study, overexpression of Myl3 or treatment with CME inhibitor and Notch signaling inhibitor RO4929097 to prevent the activation of Notch signaling in an aged or posttraumatic OA model resulted in alleviated chondrocyte senescence and cartilage destruction, suggesting that targeting overactivated Notch signaling is sufficient to prevent cellular senescence and OA development. Our study confirmed that activated Notch signaling is deleterious for chondrocyte homeostasis andwould promote OA progression. In summary, we conclude that during the development of OA, a decrease in the level ofMYL3 in chondrocytes enhances the interaction ofMYO6with clathrin and increases CMEof Notch receptor to activate Notch signaling, triggers chondrocytes senescence, promotes cartilage destruction, and aggravates OA progression. Supplementation of MYL3 and targeting blockade of CME-Notch signaling effectively ameliorates chondrocyte senescence and OA development in mice (Fig. 7). Our findings provide a molecular target for chondrocyte senescence and therapeutic strategies for OA. However, this study does have limitations. The precise dissection of trafficking dynamics involved in Notch activation following MYL3 downregulation remains elusive, given the variety of endocytosis/recycling subcellular compartments implicated in this complex process. Another limitation pertains to our inability to identify the specific cause for the reduced MYL3 protein level observed in senescent chondrocytes. Further investigation is warranted to accurately define the specific role of MYL3 in trafficking dynamics and to determine whetherMYL3 impacts the senescence of cells other than chondrocytes."

To determine the significanceof the difference, a T test was conducted on the relative quantitative values of protein in the two groups of samples, resulting in the calculation of a corresponding P value, which served as the significance index. The default threshold for significance was set at a P value < 0.05. To meet the normal distribution requirements of the T test, the relative quantitative values of proteins were logarithmically converted using Log2 before the test.

Eukaryotic mRNA was enriched using Oligo beads and prokaryotic mRNA was enriched by removing rRNA with a RiboZero\u2122 Magnetic Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). The enriched mRNA was fragmented into short fragments using fragmentation buffer and reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers. Then second-strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I, RNase H, dNTP, and buffer. The cDNA fragments were purified with a QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation products were size selected by agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR amplified, and sequenced using an Illumina Novaseq 6000 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China). GO enrichment analysis was implemented using the GOseq R Package and DAVID online tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). Pathways of differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the KEGG database (http://www.kegg.jp/ kegg/) and GESA software (v4.0.3)."
