    "abstractText": "Co\u2010culture systems of rice and aquatic animals can contribute to the ecological intensification of agriculture by reducing nutrient loss and the need for N fertilizer application and by enhancing nutrient\u2010use efficiency. However, the input of high\u2010protein diets into paddy fields, to facilitate the growth of aquatic animals, has been found to increase N pollution and acidification of the soil. Although soil amendments have been widely used to ameliorate acidic soils, reduce N2O emissions, and improve agronomic production, the relationship between soil amendments and aquatic animal remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of calcined dolomite (hereafter referred to as dolomite) as an acidic soil amendment and Ca\u2013Mg supplement in rice\u2013crab co\u2010culture using Eriocheir sinensis crabs (Chinese mitten crabs). High\u2010throughput sequencing was used to examine crab bacterial community composition and crab hepatopancreas biology. Although the water pH was significantly increased in the dolomite group, the number, composition, and diversity of bacteria identified in crab gut microbiome did not vary significantly between the dolomite and control groups. In the dolomite group, the probiotic agents Candidatus Hepatoplasma and Lactobacillus were highly abundant in the crab gut, and immune\u2010 and retinol metabolism\u2010related genes were significantly upregulated in the crab hepatopancreas. Overall, dolomite application increased crab health and water pH. Dolomite is a low\u2010cost amendment, with better stability, compared to other soil amendments, thus making it ideal for sustainable and clean rice\u2013aquatic animal co\u2010culture.",

However, the input of high\u2011protein diets into paddy fields, to facilitate the growth of aquatic animals, has been found to increase N pollution and acidification of the soil. Although soil amendments have been widely used to ameliorate acidic soils, reduce N2O emissions, and improve agronomic production, the relationship between soil amendments and aquatic animal remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of calcined dolomite (hereafter referred to as dolomite) as an acidic soil amendment and Ca\u2013Mg supplement in rice\u2013crab co\u2011culture using Eriocheir sinensis crabs (Chinese mitten crabs). High\u2011throughput sequencing was used to examine crab bacterial community composition and crab hepatopancreas biology. Although the water pH was significantly increased in the dolomite group, the number, composition, and diversity of bacteria identified in crab gut microbiome did not vary significantly between the dolomite and control groups. In the dolomite group, the probiotic agents Candidatus Hepatoplasma and Lactobacillus were highly abundant in the crab gut, and immune\u2011 and retinol metabolism\u2011related genes were significantly upregulated in the crab hepatopancreas. Overall, dolomite application increased crab health and water pH. Dolomite is a low\u2011cost amendment, with better stability, compared to other soil amendments, thus making it ideal for sustainable and clean rice\u2013aquatic animal co\u2011culture.\nSoil amendments are widely used in agriculture to retain nutrients and pesticides and reduce the contamination of surrounding areas and groundwater1. They have positive effects on soil fertility and yields, helping to close nutrient cycles and ensuring food security2\u20134. It is well established that co-culture systems of rice and aquatic animals can contribute to the ecological intensification of agriculture by providing multiple ecosystem services, promoting biological pest control, reducing pesticide use, improving soil quality, and enhancing crop yields5,6. Although rice\u2013aquatic animal co-culture can reduce the need for N fertilizer application, enhance nutrient-use efficiency, and reduce nutrient loss, it can also cause severe N pollution and soil acidification as aquatic animals require high-protein diets and excrete N-rich urine and feces into the bottom soil of paddies7,8. Nonetheless, the relationship between soil amendments and aquatic animal remains to be clarified.\nSoil amendments such as biochar and limestone are widely used in agriculture to address soil acidification and increase soil pH. They have positive effects on soil fertility and yields, helping to close nutrient cycles and ensuring food security2,3. The use of biochar as a soil amendment positively impacts an array of soil processes, benefiting soil biology, controlling soil-borne pathogens, enhancing N fixation, improving soil physical and chemical properties, decreasing NO3\u2212 leaching and N2O emissions, and remediating contaminated soils1. However, limestone is the most widely applied amendment in agricultural soil because it has a lower price and application dosage than biochar9. Moreover, compared to biochar, liming can increase the concentrations of Ca2+ and exchangeable Mg2+ and soil cation exchange capacity and reduce potential acidity (H+ + Al3+)10.\nAmong the available amendments, dolomitic lime has been verified as an effective amendment for paddy field soil contaminated by trace elements11. As it is relatively inexpensive and simultaneously provides Ca and Mg,\nOPEN"

Calcined dolomite is better than uncalcined dolomite in improving soil acidity14. After dolomite is calcined, the CaCO3 and MgCO3 in the ore are transformed into CaO and MgO, which react with soil water to produce Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. In addition, Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 can gradually release calcium and magnesium while neutralizing soil acidity, providing calcium and magnesium nutrients for the paddy field.\nRice\u2013crab co-culture is a rice-based ecological aquaculture system commonly used in China15,16. It improves soil nutrient levels and increases soil-to-rice nutrient translocation capacity7. However, economically important aquatic animals, such as fish, crayfish, and frogs, require high-protein diets for gonad development and weight gain17,18. Inevitably, the input of high-protein diets into paddy fields results in increased N pollution and acidification of the soil. Our previously published study indicated that high-protein diets can reduce soil pH and microbial diversity in rice\u2013crab co-culture8. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of dolomite, a type of limestone that is common and affordable in China, on paddy field water quality, the abundance and community composition of microbes in Eriocheir sinensis crabs (Chinese mitten crabs), and the physiological status of the crabs when applied in a rice\u2013crab co-culture environment. We hypothesized that dolomite amendment could increase Ca2+ and Mg2+ supply and have desirable effects on the physiological status of crabs. Thus, by determining the efficiency of soil amendments in rice\u2013crab co-culture systems, we aim to provide key solutions for improving food production while promoting environmental safety."

In total, 12,000 late megalopa-stage Eriocheir sinensis crabs (Chinese mitten crabs; average weight, 7.34 \u00b1 1.32\u00a0mg) were obtained from Panjin Guanghe Crab Industry and randomly distributed within the 6 fields (2000 crabs/field). The two treatments in the field experiment were set as no dolomite treatment (CK) and dolomite treatment (DOL). Based on the results of our previous experiment, the dolomite quantity in the DOL group was set at 1.5\u00a0kg/m2.

During the 30-day experiments, no significant differences in temperature, salinity, NH3\u2013N, or NO2\u2013N were found among the 5 groups (P > 0.05). The pH of dolomite-treated water in all groups was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05), increasing gradually with increased amounts of dolomite. DO was not conspicuously altered in the high-dolomite groups (2.5\u00a0kg/m2 and 3.5\u00a0kg/m2). However, with 0.5\u00a0kg/m2 of dolomite, DO was significantly reduced compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Alkalinity in the 3.5\u00a0kg/m2 group increased significantly after 3\u00a0days compared to the other groups.\nImpact of dolomite on crab intestine bacterial diversity A total of 868,803 raw sequence reads were generated from the gut samples. After quality filtering and denoising, 786,111 clean reads were retained, with an average of 63,959 non-singleton reads per sample (Table\u00a01). We used alpha diversity indices to estimate bacterial richness and diversity in the DOL and CK groups. Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices did not differ significantly between the DOL and CK groups (Fig.\u00a01). This finding was supported by the rarefaction and rank abundance curves, which illustrate the richness and diversity of each sample, respectively (Figs.\u00a0S2, S3). Beta diversity was evaluated using principal coordinates analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (Figs.\u00a0S4, S5).\nThe five most abundant gut bacterial phyla were Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and TM7 (Fig.\u00a02A). Dolomite had no effect on taxonomic composition at the phylum level but caused significant differences at the genus level. As shown in Fig.\u00a02B, the probiotic bacterium Candidatus Hepatoplasma was more\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:17932 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39099-1\nabundant in the dolomite group, while acidophilic bacteria such as Lactococcus and Bacteroides were more abundant in the control group.\nThe heat map showing correlations of phylum-level abundance within different time points revealed that TM7, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were highly abundant in the control group (Fig.\u00a03A). However, at the genus level, Lactobacillus, C. Hepatoplasma, Shigella, Paracoccus, and Rhodobacter were more abundant in the dolomite group than in controls (Fig.\u00a03B). These patterns further demonstrate that probiotic bacteria populations were significantly higher in the dolomite group than in the control group.\nCrab hepatopancreas MiSeq gene expression analyses A summary of the transcriptomic sequences is presented in Table\u00a02. In the NR database, 90.92% of unigenes were annotated (Table\u00a03). Compared with the control group, the dolomite group showed 376 DEGs (P < 0.05), with 224 upregulated genes and 152 downregulated genes (Table\u00a0S1). Heat map clustering results also indicated that most DEGs could be divided into two classes (Fig.\u00a04).\nThe results of GO analysis showed that the top three pathways under the \u201ccellular component\u201d category were \u201cmetal ion binding\u201d, \u201ccation binding\u201d, and \u201cmetallopeptidase activity\u201d (Figure\u00a0S4). A directed acyclic graph of the \u201ccellular component\u201d category was constructed (Fig.\u00a05), which indicated that metal binding-related pathways were enriched. Using KEGG enrichment analysis, the most significantly enriched metabolism-related pathway was found to be \u201cfructose and mannose metabolism\u201d followed by \u201cretinol metabolism\u201d, which was predominantly enriched in the upregulated DEGs (Figure\u00a0S6).\nAfter the uncharacterized genes among the 376 DEGs were eliminated between the control and dolomite groups, we obtained 157 upregulated genes (Table\u00a0S2) and 118 downregulated genes (Table\u00a0S3). The DEGs related to immune function, including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, cytochrome P450, cryptocyanin, heat shock protein (HSP) 70, and HSP 90, were significantly upregulated in the dolomite group.

Although the excreta of aquatic animals provides sufficient nutrients for crop growth, our previous research showed that the high-protein diets of these animals negatively affect paddy soil and cause acidification8. Moreover, the main cause of soil acidification in China is the accumulation of exogenous protons and the loss of basic ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ caused by the excessive application of N fertilizer24.\nLime is commonly applied to soil to correct soil acidity25. Available liming materials include limestone (CaCO3), quick lime (CaO), slaked lime [Ca(OH)2], and dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2], which vary in their ability for neutralizing acidified soil. Among these, dolomite, which is rich in Ca and Mg, has been demonstrated to be a better acidic soil conditioner than is lime; moreover, it is cost effective compared to lime26,27. After dolomite is calcined, its Ca2+ and Mg2+ content is gradually released, and the release rate steadily increases over time, which is in line with the growth rhythm28. In the present study, calcined dolomite addition increased water pH slowly but steadily, maintaining a consistent pH of 8.0\u20138.3 for 30\u00a0days; it was not affected by other water chemical indices. With the same application time and amount, quick lime and hydrated lime treatments are more efficient than is dolomite in increasing pH29. Nevertheless, based on the results of soil and water pH indices, the application of calcined dolomite tends to be more reliable and economical in terms of effectiveness and stability in minimizing the soil acidity problem in rice\u2013crab co-culture. Moreover, dolomite contains Mg, which is essential for crustacean growth and development30.\nChinese mitten crabs are highly valued and are thus an important part of the rice\u2013crab co-culture system. Therefore, it is necessary to understand their physiological status within this system, especially under dolomite application.

The probiotic bacterium C. Hepatoplasma was more abundant in the dolomite group than in the control group, but the converse was true for the acidophilic bacteria Lactococcus and Bacteroides. C. Hepatoplasma in the intestines of juvenile Panulirus ornatus and mitten crabs may play a symbiotic role in nutrient absorption31,32. Moreover, Lactobacillus, which has potential probiotic properties in crab33, was also more abundant in the dolomite group than in the control group. These findings suggest that the microbial communities in the intestines of crabs have an overall high average similarity among the dolomite and control groups, as reflected by the biodiversity and richness of intestinal microbiota and the most dominant community members at the phylum level.\nFigure\u00a01. Alpha diversity of bacterial groups in crab gut from the dolomite and control groups in a rice\u2013crab co-culture system.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:17932 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39099-1\nNotably, Notably, in addition to the findings mentioned earlier, we observed significant upregulation of immune function-related genes, such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase, cytochrome P450, cryptocyanin, HSP 70, and HSP 90, in the hepatopancreas of crabs in the DOL groups compared to the control group. This finding aligns with previous studies in crustaceans, where immune genes are known to be stimulated in response to various stimuli. Conversely, under acidic conditions, these immune genes are typically downregulated34. This suggests that maintaining an adequate level of magnesium (Mg) in the environment may play a crucial role in preventing rapid bacterial proliferation and reaching infectious levels in the giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii)35. Over 500\u00a0mg/kg MgO supplementation resulted in the best survival and growth of M. rosenbergii post-larvae36. In the present study, calcined dolomite had an MgO content of 35.70%, which may also promote growth in mitten crabs.\nBased on KEGG pathway analysis, the retinol metabolic pathway and related genes were significantly upregulated in dolomite crabs compared to controls.

In this metabolic pathway, retinol is first oxidized to retinaldehyde, and retinaldehyde is then oxidized to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid acts as a ligand for retinoic acid signaling activities to directly regulate gene expression. RDH is an important enzyme in retinol metabolism and can protect cells from non-aldehyde-related toxicity. In the present study, the expression of RDH-related genes was significantly upregulated, indicating that dolomite induced retinol metabolism. Lower pH and acidified environments can have a deleterious effect on the overall homeostasis of retinoic acid in cells37. Therefore, dolomite application helps to increase water and soil pH and eventually has a positive impact on crab health in rice\u2013crab co-culture systems.\nFigure\u00a03.

High-protein diets are widely used in this system, increasing the risk of N pollution and soil acidification due to undigested protein-rich feed and feces. A convenient, low-cost, and stable amendment was applied to regulate agriculture processes, while at the same time increasing the production of rice\u2013crab coculture systems. This study demonstrated that the addition of calcined dolomite in a rice\u2013crab co-culture system increases water pH and crab health over the whole production period. The present study was conducted only in north of China; therefore, further research is needed to determine the effects of dolomite addition on co-culture systems with different types of soils, particularly under acidic and metal-contaminated field conditions."
