    "abstractText": "Dihydropyridine drugs are well known as photodegradable pharmaceuticals. Herein, we evaluate the photostability of felodipine (FL) medicine (Splendil\u00ae (SPL) tablets) and its altered forms (powders and suspensions). FL is a type of dihydropyridine drug, but its photochemical behavior is unknown. FL contents after ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation for 24 h were monitored using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Values of the residual amounts of FL in UV-irradiated SPL powders and suspensions were 32.76 \u00b1 4.88% and 0.79 \u00b1 0.74%, respectively, with the generation of two photoproducts (FL photoproduct 1 and 2). To identify the chemical structures of these photoproducts, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS/MS) analysis was performed. Based on their mass-to-charge ratio values and fragment patterns, it was proposed that FL photoproduct 1 was a pyridine derivative and FL photoproduct 2 was an FL dimer. Interestingly, generation rates of FL photoproduct 1 and 2 were dependent on the presence of the aqueous media. The photodimerization of FL was induced in UV-irradiated SPL suspensions. This is the first report evaluating the photostability of SPL tablets and its altered forms and estimating FL photoproducts induced by UV irradiation in the formulation of SPL.",

Yamashita et al. showed the color change of several medicines without a press through package (PTP) sheet under LED lighting and fluorescent lighting [1]. Furthermore, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) of several normal plain tablets, such as amlodipine, nifedipine and nilvadipine, were photodegraded when these tablets were pulverized and photoirradiated [2]. In a clinical situation, there are several cases where tablets are crushed and packaged followed by storage in the houses of patients. Our previous reports also showed that long-term storage (for up to 90 days) of crushed amlodipine oral disintegration tablets in the package near the window of a house, where it is exposed to sunlight irradiation, resulted in a decrease in their APIs [3]. The decrease in APIs means the weakening of the beneficial effect of a medicine. So, the photostability evaluation of a photosensitive medicine and its altered forms (powders and suspensions) is an important issue for their safe use. Photodegradation of pharmaceuticals results in the generation of their photoproducts. In the case of dihydropyridine drugs, the dihydropyridine ring is easily oxidized, followed by the generation of a pyridine derivative [4\u20137]. Dihydropyridine drugs have been used for the reduction of high blood pressure but are well known as photosensitive drugs. Nifedipine is one of such dihydropyridine drugs and its main photoproduct is known as a pyridine derivative with a nitroso group [8\u201310]. This photoproduct was generated by the elimination\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 697. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15020697 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 697 2 of 12\nof a hydrogen atom in the dihydropyridine ring by one oxygen atom of the nitro group followed by the additional elimination of a hydrogen atom. Interestingly, its ability to inhibit calcium channels is quite weak or non-existent compared with that of nifedipine [11\u201313]. On the other hand, this photoproduct showed the antioxidative potency [14]. These studies indicate that different natures of photosensitive pharmaceuticals lead to different photoproducts. On the contrary, photoexposure might lead to the expression of an adverse effect. For example, dacarbazine is photoconverted to 5-diazoimidazole-4-carboxamide which induces vascular pain even though dacarbazine has no effect [15]. Several reports including our previous studies showed that the toxicological potencies of photosensitive pharmaceuticals were induced by ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation through the generation of their photoproducts [16\u201321]. Stability test guidelines have been established by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Regulation of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) (ICH-Q1A, Stability testing of new drug substances and products) for the evaluation of the stability of pharmaceuticals [22]. The ICH-Q1A gives the test conditions, such as the long-term storage testing (under the condition of 25 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C/60 \u00b1 5% relative humidity (RH) or 30 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C/65 \u00b1 5% RH for 12 months), the intermediate storage testing (under the condition of 30 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C/65 \u00b1 5% RH for 6 months) and the accelerated storage testing (under the condition of 40 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C/75 \u00b1 5% RH for 6 months). Furthermore, for the determination of intrinsic stability, stress tests are carried out under severe conditions (heat, humidity and photoexposure). In the case of photostability evaluation, test guidelines (ICH-Q1B, Photostability testing of new drug substances and products) have also been established [23]. Obtained results are described in the interview form and used as the evidence for the determination of the type of a final package and a dosage form of test pharmaceuticals. However, photostability tests focused on medicines which are out of a PTP sheet or changed to powders and suspensions are not performed. For most tablets, the effect of changes to dosage form on their photostability is unclear. With this in mind, in this study, we first evaluate the effects of crush and suspension on the photostability of API. We believe this information is important for their safe use. In the present study, we performed the photostability evaluation of Splendil\u00ae 2.5 mg (SPL) tablets whose API is felodipine (FL, Figure 1). SPL tablets is an original medicine of FL tablets. FL is a type of dihydropyridine drug and chemically ethyl methyl (4RS)-4(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate. Its molecular formula and molecular weight are C18H19Cl2NO4 and 384.25 g/mol. FL is widely used and can simultaneously reduce the blood pressure of patients and significantly increase the plasma auxin concentrations [24]. This compound is a crystalline powder with very low water solubility [25], resulting in poor oral bioavailability [26]. Tres et al. reported the detection of FL in the environment using fluorescence techniques [27]. This is the first report focused on the photochemical behavior of FL tablets. Firstly, residual amounts of API in UV-irradiated SPL tablets and its altered forms (powders and suspensions) were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Next, chemical structures of two photoproducts were elucidated by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS/MS) analysis. Finally, the photodegradation mechanism of SPL tablets was discussed based on the obtained results. As a result of this study, it was clarified that the photostability of SPL tablets decreased by the change of the dosage form, and two FL photoproducts, which were a pyridine derivative and an FL dimer, were identified in the UV-irradiated SPL powders and suspensions. Interestingly, generation rates of these photoproducts were affected by the dosage forms of SPL tablets, suggesting that the form of medicines might contribute to the photodegradation mechanism of APIs.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 697 3 of 12\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13\nFigure 1.

In the first step, the evaluation of the validity of the HPLC method was performed. Results are summarized in Table 1. Obtained validation parameters were suitable for the evaluation of FL content.\nUV irradiation experiments for SPL tablets and its altered forms were carried out. UV irradiation was performed using a black light. It mainly emits UV-A (most abundant wavelength is 360 nm). UV-A is the main component of UV-range light in sunlight. Furthermore, our previous study showed that the photodegradation induced by UV-A irradiation was comparable to that induced by sunlight irradiation [16]. We think that this study demonstrates the photostability evaluation in the actual conditions as much as possible. Effects of UV irradiation for 24 h on APIs in tablet samples, powder samples and suspension samples of SPL tablets were evaluated by HPLC. Typical chromatograms are shown in Figure 2. In the case of tablet samples, one peak derived from FL was detected at a retention time of 7.9 min. UV irradiation had no effect on SPL tablets because the peak area of FL was not changed, and other peaks were not detected. SPL tablets are film-coated tablets, so their APIs were protected from UV irradiation and the photodegradation was not induced. On the other hand, changing their dosage forms to powders and suspensions resulted in the decrease in photostability as shown in Figure 2D,F. Both the decrease in API and the generation of two photoproducts (FL photoproduct 1 and 2, retention times were 6.0 min and ca. 15 min, respectively) were observed after UV irradiation. This result suggests that FL photoproduct 1 has higher polarity than FL judged from the faster retention time in C18 column. On the contrary, FL photoproduct 2 seems to have lower polarity. Among two altered forms, the photodegradation of APIs in SPL suspensions were more significant because the peak of API was slightly detected. Other photoproducts were not detected in this experiment. In our experiments, the control samples of SPL powders and suspensions did not change, indicating that the degradation of SPL resulted from only UV irradiation, and other factors, such as temperature and humidity, had no contribution on it. UV spectra of FL and two FL photoproducts recorded by a PDA detector are shown in Figure 3. FL showed a characteristic maximum absorption at 361 nm which was derived from a dihydropyridine moiety. In contrast to FL, both FL photoproduct 1 and 2 showed no absorption between 300 and 400 nm, strongly suggesting that these photoproducts might not have the dihydropyridine moiety. Additionally, the change of the color of SPL tablets, powders and suspensions were not observed by UV irradiation. The residual amounts (%) of APIs and the generation rates (%) of two FL photoproducts in tablet samples, powder samples and suspension samples are summarized in Figure 4. Residual amounts of APIs in UV-irradiated powders and suspensions (32.76 \u00b1 4.88%\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 697 6 of 12\nand 0.79 \u00b1 0.74%, respectively) were significantly less than those of the control samples (94.69 \u00b1 2.52% and 100.22 \u00b1 0.83%, respectively). Similarly to the HPLC chromatogram, residual amounts of APIs were not influenced by UV irradiation when tablet samples were irradiated. These results indicated that changing the dosage form of SPL tablets to powders and suspensions decreases the photostability because of the loss of a film coating and the enhancement of a light emission efficiency to their APIs, as shown in our previous reports [29]. It is possible that the crushing of SPL tablets for the improvement of medication compliance in a clinical situation might result in the decrease in its beneficial effect when SPL powders are packaged and stored in a place where they are exposed to sunlight.

We thought two FL photodegradation pathways were independent because two FL photoproducts were not generated step by step as shown in Figure 2. This is the first study focused on the photochemical behavior of an FL medicine. It has been reported that oxidation of the dihydropyridine ring was the main photodegradation pathway of various dihydropyridine drugs such as amlodipine and nifedipine in the solid-state [2]. Obtained results in this experiment also indicated that a pyridine derivative of FL was the main photoproduct when SPL powders were UV-irradiated (Figure 2D). Elimination of proton radical is a trigger of the oxidation of a dihydropyridine ring of FL, followed by the elimination of proton from nitrogen atom resulting in the formation of an aromatic moiety. However, in the case of SPL suspensions, the main photoproduct was FL photoproduct 2 due to its higher generation rate compared with FL photoproduct 1 (Figure 4B). It is proposed that two FL molecules might be bound to form FL photoproduct 2 through the bridging of each dihydropyridine ring by a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. These results make it possible to estimate that the photodimerization of FL might be easily induced in aqueous media, compared with in the powder form, because FL molecules could move freely and there is less distance between FL molecules. A promotion of the photodimerization resulted in the suppression of FL oxidation and the decrease in the generation rate of FL photoproduct 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the dosage form contributes to the formation of photoproducts in addition to the photodegradation rates. It is possible that other factors except for an aqueous media, such as irradiation efficiency and oxygen molecules, might have a crucial role in the photodegradation pathway. In addition, FL photodegradation might be affected by the pH value, which is derived from the proton ion content and dominates the state of ionization of FL in the suspension form, so further research is needed to evaluate the FL photodegradation under several conditions.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 13"

Elimination of proton radical is a trigger of the oxidation of a dihydropyridine ring of FL, followed by the elimination of proton from nitrogen atom resulting in the formation of an aromatic moiety. However, in the case of SPL suspensions, the m in photoproduct was FL photopr duct 2 due to i s higher g neration rate compared wit FL hotoproduct 1 (Figure 4B). It is proposed that tw FL olecules might be bound to form FL photoproduct 2 through the bridging of each dihydropyridine ring by a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. These results make it possible to estimate that the photodimerization of FL might be easily induced in aqueous media, compared with in the powder form, because FL molecules could move freely and there is less distance between FL molecules. A pro-\notion of the photodimerization resulted in the suppression o FL oxidation and the decrease in the generation rate of FL photoproduct 1. To the best of our kn wledge, this is the first study showing that the dosage form contributes to the formation of photoproducts in addition to the photodegradation rates. It is possible that other factors except for an aqueous media, such as irradiation efficiency and oxygen molecules, might have a crucial role in the p otodegr dation pathway. In addition, FL photodegradation might be affected by the pH v lue, w ich is derived from the proton i content nd dominates the state of ionization of FL in the suspension form, so further research is needed to evaluate the FL photodegradation under several conditions.\nScheme 1. Summary of estimated FL photodegradation.\nMoreover, there are several additives in SPL tablets. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) and iron (\u2162) oxide (Fe2O3) are utilized as coating agents, but they are well-known photocatalysts. They are excited by UV irradiation and transfer their excited energy to other compounds [30\u201332]. When SPL tablets are crushed or suspended, light emission efficiency to TiO2 or Fe2O3 might be improved, resulting in the enhancement of their photocatalytic activities. Excited TiO2 or Fe2O3 were able to form reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals, which might withdraw the hydrogen atom from FL followed by the formation of FL photoproduct 1. Additionally, the energy transfer from TiO2 or Fe2O3 to FL might promote the formation of FL photoproduct 2. The contribution of additives might be an important issue for the photochemical behavior of film-coated tablets in the case that they are crushed or suspended."

The chemical structures of two photoproducts were identified from ESI-LC/MS/MS analysis of the UV-irradiated SPL\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 697 11 of 12\npowders and suspensions. In this study, the effect of UV irradiation on the pharmacological activity and the expression of adverse effects of SPL were not evaluated. It is reported that the formation of the pyridine derivative and the pharmaceutical dimer triggered the expression of unexpected biological activities [14,33]. It is concerning that the SPL medicine, which is crushed or suspended, might have a lower pharmacological activity when it is irradiated by sunlight on account of the fact that UV is a component. The influence of photoirradiation on most medicines, when they are out of the PTP sheet and their dosage forms are changed, are not evaluated, so further research is needed that focuses on the photochemical behaviors of medicines.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.K., S.A. and H.N.; Methodology, K.K. and M.K.; Formal Analysis, K.K.; Investigation, K.K.; Resources, H.N.; Data Curation, K.K.; Writing\u2014Original Draft Preparation, K.K.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing, H.N.; Supervision, S.A. and H.N.; Project Administration, K.K. and H.N.; Funding Acquisition, K.K.
