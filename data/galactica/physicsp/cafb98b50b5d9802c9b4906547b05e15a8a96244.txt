Plasmonic nanomaterials have attracted great attention in the field of catalysis and sensing for their outstanding electrical and optical properties. Here, a representative type of nonstoichiometric Cu2−xSe nanoparticles with typical near-infrared (NIR) localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) properties originating from their copper deficiency was applied to catalyze the oxidation of colorless TMB into their blue product in the presence of H2O2, indicating they had good peroxidase-like activity. However, glutathione (GSH) inhibited the catalytic oxidation of TMB, as it can consume the reactive oxygen species. Meanwhile, it can induce the reduction of Cu(II) in Cu2−xSe, resulting in a decrease in the degree of copper deficiency, which can lead to a reduction in the LSPR. Therefore, the catalytic ability and photothermal responses of Cu2−xSe were decreased. Thus, in our work, a colorimetric/photothermal dual-readout array was developed for the detection of GSH. The linear calibration for GSH concentration was in the range of 1–50 μM with the LOD as 0.13 μM and 50–800 μM with the LOD as 39.27 μM. To evaluate the practicability of the assay, tomatoes and cucumbers were selected as real samples, and good recoveries indicated that the developed assay had great potential in real applications. 1. conclusions In conclusion, a type of Cu2−xSe nanoparticles was used as both the nano-enzymatic and photothermal reagent. Because of the high copper deficiency, Cu(I)/Cu(II) coexisted in the Cu2−xSe nanoparticles and acted as a source of optically active holes. GSH, as a natural hole-scavenger, captured the holes of Cu2−xSe, inducing the peroxidase-like activity inhibition and the decreased photothermal efficiency, which were regulated by their reduced NIR LSPR. Therefore, a Cu2−xSe mediated colorimetric/photothermal dual-readout sensing platform for glutathione was developed and applied in the real samples with a satisfactory result.
