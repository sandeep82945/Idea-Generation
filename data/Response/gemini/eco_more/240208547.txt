1. **Extending the results to more general settings.** The paper considers the setting of repeated fair division between two players with private valuations over a cake. It would be interesting to extend these results to more general settings, such as settings with multiple players, settings with more complex valuations, or settings with different fairness criteria.
2. **Investigating the impact of different learning algorithms.** The paper considers the use of fictitious play as a learning algorithm for repeated fair division. It would be interesting to investigate the impact of using other learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning or Bayesian learning.
3. **Analyzing the impact of noise.** The paper assumes that the players have perfect information about the other player's valuations. It would be interesting to analyze the impact of noise on the results, such as noise in the players' valuations or noise in the players' observations of each other's actions.
4. **Developing new strategies for exploiting or defending against exploitation.** The paper provides a strategy for Alice to exploit a nearly myopic Bob. It would be interesting to develop new strategies for exploiting or defending against exploitation in more general settings.
5. **Applying the results to real-world problems.** The results of the paper could be applied to a variety of real-world problems, such as the allocation of resources, the division of property, or the scheduling of tasks. It would be interesting to explore these applications in more detail.
