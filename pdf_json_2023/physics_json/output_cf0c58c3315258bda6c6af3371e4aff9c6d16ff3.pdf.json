Chem. Chem. Phys., 2018, 20, 12898\u201312907, https://doi.org/10.1039/\nC7CP08054A.\nThe authors would like to highlight that one of their closely related papers published in Frontiers in Laboratory Medicine1 should have been cited as ref. 69 in the captions for Fig. 1 and 3 in the published version of the present paper. Parts of Fig. 1 and 3 in this article were first published in ref. 1 and were not correctly attributed to the previously published report. The images in this paper and ref. 1 both correspond to the characterisation of TiO2 nanoparticles via the same synthesis methods. Due to the overlap in the synthesis and characterisation, ref. 69 should have been cited in this Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics paper. The missing ref. 69 is listed below as ref. 1.\nThe corrected version of each caption is:\nFig. 1 TEM micrographs of TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized (A and B) without AA and using BzOH/TTIP molar concentration ratios of (A) 7.12; (B) 14.24; or (C\u2013H) in the presence of AA using BzOH/TTIP ratios of (C and D) 14.24; (E and F) 11.42; (G and H) 7.12 and AA/BzOH molar concentration ratios of (C) 0.07; (D) 0.34; (E) 0.11; (F) 0.45; (G) 0.10; and (H) 0.36 (scale bar = 20 nm).
