    "abstractText": "Lotus flower polysaccharide (LFP) and lotus seedpod polysaccharide (LSP) were separated by water extract\u2013alcohol precipitation, and their structures and biological activities were investigated. The results of monosaccharide composition showed that LFP and LSP were composed of nine monosaccharides, fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid, with the molar percentages of 0.18: 0.43: 2.26: 45.22: 32.14: 4.28: 8.20: 6.28: 1.01 and 2.70: 1.02: 8.15: 45.63: 20.63: 1.44: 2.59: 16.45. LSP and LFP exhibited molecular weights of 9.37 \u00d7 104 Da and 1.24 \u00d7 106 Da, respectively. SEM showed that LFP and LSP have similar structures; XRD analysis showed that both polysaccharides had crystalline structure and amorphous structure. The results of ABTS+, DPPH, hydroxyl radical scavenging experiment, and a reducing power experiment showed that LFP and LSP had good antioxidant capacity. Cell viability findings showed that polysaccharide concentrations of lotus flower and lotus seedpod could enhance cellular proliferation ranging from 25 to 400 \u03bcg/mL without cytotoxicity. By inducing the production of crucial proteins in the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway, LFP and LSP were able to induce autophagy in RAW264.7, according to the results of the RT-PCR and Western blotting assays.",

It has been used for more than 2000 years as an herbal remedy, functional food, and vegetable. The lotus is not only an ornamental plant in China [2] but also an important dual-use resource with rich nutritional value and pharmacological activity [3]. Lotus contains flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and other bioactive substances, which have immunomodulatory, antioxidant, memory-improving, and nervous system-regulating effects. The lotus flower is rich in proanthocyanidins, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, quercetin, and dietary fiber, which have pharmacological activities such as antioxidant effects, memory and cognitive improvement, antibacterial properties, blood sugar and lipid regulation, anti-tumor effects, and improvement of the nervous system [4]. The modern research indicates that polysaccharide is a kind of natural macromolecule that exists widely in nature [5]. It has many biological activities, such as anti-oxidation, immunomodulation, anti-tumor, and so on [6]. Polysaccharides are widely used in food, health products, cosmetics, and other industries because of their biodegradable, non-toxic properties, biocompatibility, and low processing costs [7]. Researchers are becoming more and more interested in polysaccharides as an essential component of the many components\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3828. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15183828 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3828 2 of 15\nof the lotus. Little research has been performed on how the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides from various regions of the lotus affects the biological activity of those polysaccharides, compared to the strength of those effects on other portions of the lotus\u2019 polysaccharides. In this paper, the polysaccharides of lotus flower and lotus seedpod were extracted by water extraction and ethanol precipitation, and their molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, and IR properties were assayed; furthermore, the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties were evaluated by in vitro antioxidant experiments and cell models. The results of this study provide an experimental basis for the research and development of LFP and LSP as pharmaceutical and food supplements."

First, the ABTS+ working solution was formed by combining 7 mmol/L ABTS+ solution with 2.45 mmol/L K2S2O8 solution in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio and allowing the mixture to react for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. For use, 10 mL of working solution was adjusted with PBS (pH = 7.0) solution until its absorbance at 734 nm was 0.70 \u00b1 0.05. Then, 200 \u00b5L of various LFP and LSP sample solution concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg/mL) were combined with 1.2 mL of the ABTS+ solution and thoroughly mixed. The same concentration of vitamin C (Vc) solution was employed as the control group, and the reaction solution was then left at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance of the reaction solution at 734 nm was measured, and the formula was applied for calculating ABTS+\u2019s ability to scavenge free radicals:\nScavenging ability (%) = (1 \u2212 AX/AX0)] \u00d7 100\nwhere: Ax represents the sample solution reaction mixture\u2019s absorbance; AX0 indicates the background absorbance of the reaction mixture with the same volume of deionized water PBS mixed solution replacing the ABTS+ solution.\n2.4.2. DPPH Free Radical\nThe samples\u2019 ability to scavenge DPPH radicals in vitro was measured using a modified version of the Wang et al. [11]. method. An equivalent volume of newly prepared DPPH (dissolved in ethanol) solution was combined with 500 \u00b5L of various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/mL) of LFP and LSP solutions, and the reaction mixture was left to stand in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. As a positive control, the same volume of distilled water served as the blank, and the same concentration of Vc solution served as the positive control. The DPPH radical scavenging ability of the reaction solution was determined using the following formula:\nScavenging ability (%) = (1 \u2212 AX/AX0)] \u00d7 100\nwhere: AX represents the sample solution reaction mixture\u2019s absorbance. AX0 denotes the absorbance of an equal volume of anhydrous ethanol replacing the reaction mixture of the DPPH solution.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3828 4 of 15\n2.4.3. Hydroxyl Radical\nFirst, 400 \u00b5L of polysaccharide sample solutions at various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/mL) were added to 400 \u00b5L of 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 mol/L salicylic acid 70% ethanol solution and 400 \u00b5L of 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 mol/L FeSO4 solution, and subsequently, to 800 \u00b5L of H2O2 (6 \u00d7 10\u22123 mol/L) solution. The reaction solution was then heated at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min with Vc as the positive control and the same amount of distilled water as the blank group in place of the sample solution. The absorbance of the reaction solution at 510 nm was measured, and the ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals was calculated by the following equation:\nScavenging ability (%) = [(AX \u2212 A0)/(AX0 \u2212 A0)] \u00d7 100\nwhere: A0 is the same volume of deionized water used to replace the sample reaction mixture\u2019s absorbance. AX represents the sample solution reaction mixture\u2019s absorbance. AX0 is the absorbance of the reaction mixture with the same volume of deionized water instead of the H2O2 solution.\n2.4.4. Reducing Power\nModifications were made to the method developed by Gao et al. [12] for measuring the reducing capacity of the samples. Specifically, 500 \u00b5L of phosphate buffer solution (pH = 6.8) and 0.1 mL of 1% (w/v) potassium ferricyanide solution were added to 200 \u00b5L of various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/mL) of LFP and LSP sample solutions, and the reaction solution was then incubated at 50 \u25e6C for 20 min. After rapidly cooling, the reaction solution was combined with 0.5 mL of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution. For 5 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm. The absorbance of the reaction product was measured at 700 nm using Vc as a positive control. The strength of the sample\u2019s reducing power is represented by the reaction system\u2019s absorbance; the higher the absorbance value, the greater the sample\u2019s reducing power.\n2.5. Assay of Immunomodulatory Activity of LFP and LSP 2.5.1. Cell Cultivation\nThe RPMI1640 media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin after RAW264.7 were cultured in an incubator at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2. Every two to three days, the cells were passaged.\n2.5.2. Cell Viability\nThe cell viability of SRP was detected by the CCK-8 method [13]. RAW264.7 in the logarithmic growth phase was seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well, and 100 \u00b5L of cell suspension was added to each well. The wells were then grown in a cell incubator at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to determine the viability of the LFP and LSP. LPS was introduced to the positive control group at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, the administration groups at concentrations of 25, 50, and 50, and the blank control group at a concentration of 100 \u00b5L total culture solution. Each well received 10 \u00b5L of CCK-8 after 6 h of incubation. After 1 h, the OD value at 450 nm was determined.\n2.5.3. Phagocytosis Assay\nRAW264.7 in the logarithmic growth phase was inoculated into 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well, 100 \u00b5L cell suspension was added to each well, and then it was cultured in a cell incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 \u25e6C for 24 h. The supernatant was absorbed out, washed twice with PBS and 100 \u00b5L of neutral red staining solution was added to each well. After incubation in an incubator for 4 h, the supernatant was discarded, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and 200 \u00b5L lysis solution (50% ethanol: 50% acetic\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3828 5 of 15\nacid = 1:1) was added to each well. The light absorption was discovered at 540 nm after 4 h of incubation at room temperature.\n2.5.4. Scratch-Wound Assay\nThe method of cell scratch\u2013wound assay was as reported by Zubair et al. [14]. RAW264.7 was inoculated at a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per well and cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h, then scratched with the tip of a 200 \u00b5L gun to ensure uniform damage. The scratched cells were washed three times with PBS to eliminate the damage before being cultured for 24 h in media containing various concentrations of LFP and LSP (25, 50, 100, 200 \u00b5g/mL) and LPS (1 \u00b5g/mL). Samples were taken, and cell movement in the same place was examined.\n2.5.5. Extraction of mRNA and Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction\nTable 1 shows the primer sequences for RT-PCR. The RNA was isolated using the Trizol procedure and evaluated for concentration and quality using Nanodrop8000. The obtained RNA was then used as a template for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription using HiScriptIIIRTSuperMix qPCR(+gDNA). Fluorescence quantification reaction systems were prepared by Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix. The 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT method was used to record the change in the relative expression of each gene at the end of the reaction.\n2.5.6. The Western Blotting and Total Protein Extraction Assays\nThe total protein of cells was separated by protein lysate. The BCA kit was utilized to measure protein quantity, transferred to a PVDF membrane using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, sealed in skim milk for 2 h, and then incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C with diluted primary antibody. The next day, any remaining primary antibody was removed using TBST solution, and the secondary antibody was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After being added, the secondary antibody was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Three TBST buffer washes were followed by the development of the secondary antibody."

Discussion The most popular method for extracting polysaccharides from various lotus sections is water extraction [30]. Polysaccharides can be extracted from various portions of the lotus using various methods, including microwave-assisted extraction, ultrasonic-assisted extraction, enzyme-assisted extraction, alkali extraction, and acid extraction [30,31]. As an important component of different parts of the lotus, the polysaccharide has attracted more and more attention from researchers. The effects of simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides from various lotus sections on the bioactivity of lotus leaf polysaccharides have been the subject of numerous studies [32]. However, there are few studies about its effect on the biological activity of polysaccharides in other parts of the lotus. In this study, LFP and LSP were selected for research. They were separated by water extraction and alcohol precipitation, and their yields were 5.57% 0.04%, and 2.51% 0.03%, respectively."

They were separated by water extraction and alcohol precipitation, and their yields were 5.57% 0.04%, and 2.51% 0.03%, respectively. Polysaccharide structure and physiological function are intimately connected [33]. The biological activity of polysaccharides in different regions of the lotus will be influenced by their molecular weight, uronic acid content, protein content, and polyphenol concentration. Feng et al. [34] reported that lotus leaf polysaccharide with low molecular weight and high uronic acid content showed a stronger effect in scavenging ABTS and DPPH free radicals\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3828 13 of 15\nand reducing power of iron ions, which was consistent with the results in this paper that LSP with low molecular weight and high uronic acid content had higher ABTS free radical resistance and reducing power than LFP. Wu et al.\u2019s research also confirmed that lotus leaf polysaccharide with low molecular weight and high uronic acid content has stronger biological activity in immunomodulation in vitro [31]. The six monosaccharides, galactose, glucose, mannose, rhamnose, xylose, and arabinose, made up the majority of the LSP, as reported by Ma Guangqiang et al. [35]. The results of monosaccharide analysis in this paper showed that LFP and LSP are heteropolysaccharides composed of nine monosaccharides with a richer monosaccharide composition. Herbal polysaccharide can enhance immune activity by regulating cell division and differentiation [36]. Both LFP and LSP can stimulate RAW264.7 to promote cell proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis. In the control of the immune system and the inflammatory process, NF-\u03baB is crucial [37]. TLR4 is an important member of the toll-like receptor family, which was proven to be involved in mediating immune inflammatory response [38]. Therefore, the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway is an important pathway for inflammatory signal transduction. Autophagy is a cellular mechanism of self-degradation, transformation, and energy production. Activation of toll-like receptors in pattern recognition can induce autophagy and regulate the inflammatory response [39]. LC3 is the signature protein of autophagy; P62 is the substrate of autophagy degradation; The identification and packing of degradation substrates are crucial aspects of its function. In mammalian cells, Beclin 1 overexpression encourages autophagy, and Beclin 1 expression rises as autophagy advances. Therefore, LC3, Beclin 1, and p62 are selected as the indexes of autophagy [40]. Our findings indicate that LFP and LSP, at concentrations of 25\u201350 \u00b5g/mL, can dramatically enhance the expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-\u03baB p65, and p62 proteins. As a result, LFP and LSP may induce autophagy in RAW264.7 by triggering the production of important TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway proteins."

For the polysaccharide structure, FTIR results showed that LFP and LSP had functional groups of polysaccharides; XRD analysis showed that both polysaccharides exhibited crystalline structure and amorphous structure. The crystallinities of LFP and LSP were 22.76\u25e6 and 21.78\u25e6, respectively. SEM showed that the surfaces of LFP and LSP were smooth and spherical. The biological activities of LFP and LSP were initially investigated. The results of ABTS+, DPPH, the hydroxyl radical scavenging experiment, and the reducing power experiment showed that LFP and LSP had good antioxidant capacity. The cell viability data demonstrated that LFP and LSP may enhance cell proliferation and without cytotoxicity.
