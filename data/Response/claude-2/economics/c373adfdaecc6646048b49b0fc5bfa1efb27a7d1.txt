 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of COVID-19 on wine tourism in other wine-producing countries besides Spain. The paper found a major decline in 2020, but it would be interesting to see if this trend held true globally or just in Spain. 

2. Conduct surveys or interviews with wine tourists to better understand motivations, preferences, and satisfaction. The paper relied on secondary data, but primary research could provide additional insights.

3. Analyze strategies and best practices for wine routes and wineries to recover tourism post-COVID. As the paper showed declines in 2020, research on how to bounce back could be useful. 

4. Study the relationship between wine route certification/quality standards and tourism demand. The paper discussed certification but did not empirically test its impact. This could be examined.

5. Develop and test marketing or promotional tactics to increase wine route visibility and attract more tourists. The paper concluded some routes are better known than others, so research on effective marketing could help even the playing field.
