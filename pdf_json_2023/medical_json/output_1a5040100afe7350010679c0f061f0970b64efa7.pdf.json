    "abstractText": "Current antidepressants have limitations due to insufficient efficacy and delay before improvement in symptoms. Polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene have been linked to depression (when combined with stressful life events) and to altered response to selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors. We have previously revealed the antidepressant-like properties of the iron chelator deferiprone in the 5HTT knock-out (KO) mouse model of depression. Furthermore, deferiprone was found to alter neural activity in the prefrontal cortex of both wild-type (WT) and 5HTT KO mice. In the current study, we examined the molecular effects of acute deferiprone treatment in the prefrontal cortex of both genotypes via phosphoproteomics. In WT mice treated with deferiprone, there were 22 differentially expressed phosphosites, with gene ontology analysis implicating cytoskeletal proteins. In 5-HTT KO mice treated with deferiprone, we found 33 differentially expressed phosphosites. Gene ontology analyses revealed phosphoproteins that were predominantly involved in synaptic and glutamatergic signalling. In a drug naive cohort, the analysis revealed 21 differentially expressed phosphosites in 5-HTT KO compared to WT mice. We confirmed the deferiprone-induced increase in Tyrosine hydroxylase serine 40 residue phosphorylation (pTH-Ser40) (initially revealed in our phosphoproteomics study) by western blots, with deferiprone increasing pTH-Ser40 expression in WT and 5-HTT KO mice. As glutamatergic and synaptic signalling are dysfunctional in 5-HTT KO mice (and are the target of fast-acting antidepressant drugs such as ketamine), these molecular effects may underpin deferiprone's antidepressant-like properties. Furthermore, dopaminergic signalling may also be involved in deferiprone's antidepressant-like properties. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

            "text": "improvement in symptoms. Polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene have been linked to depression (when combined with stressful life events) and to altered response to selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors. We have previously revealed the antidepressant-like properties of the iron chelator deferiprone in the 5- HTT knock-out (KO) mouse model of depression. Furthermore, deferiprone was found to alter neural activity in the prefrontal cortex of both wild-type (WT) and 5- HTT KO mice. In the current study, we examined the molecular effects of acute deferiprone treatment in the prefrontal cortex of both genotypes via phosphoproteomics. In WT mice treated with deferiprone, there were 22 differentially expressed phosphosites, with gene ontology analysis implicating cytoskeletal proteins. In 5-HTT KO mice treated with deferiprone, we found 33 differentially expressed phosphosites. Gene ontology analyses revealed phosphoproteins that were predominantly involved in synaptic and glutamatergic signalling. In a drug naive cohort, the analysis revealed 21 differentially expressed phosphosites in 5-HTT KO compared to WT mice. We confirmed the deferiprone-induced increase in Tyrosine hydroxylase serine 40 residue phosphorylation (pTH-Ser40) (initially revealed in our phosphoproteomics study) by western blots, with deferiprone increasing pTH-Ser40 expression in WT and 5-HTT KO mice. As glutamatergic and synaptic signalling are dysfunctional in 5-HTT KO mice (and are the target of fast-acting antidepressant drugs such as ketamine), these molecular effects may underpin deferiprone's antidepressant-like properties. Furthermore, dopaminergic signalling may also be involved in deferiprone's antidepressant-like properties.\n1. Introduction Currently prescribed antidepressants have limited utility due to suboptimal efficacy and a latency period of up to 8 weeks before substantial benefits are observed (Gaynes et al., 2009; Trivedi et al., 2006). Although the new class of fast-acting glutamatergic antidepressants such as ketamine have shown therapeutic potential, they have extensive side-effect profiles (Driesen et al., 2013; Ho & Zhang, 2016; Shiroma et al., 2020). These constraints indicate the need to develop novel fast acting and effective antidepressant therapies.\nWe have previously discovered that the iron chelator deferiprone has acute antidepressant-like properties on the serotonin transporter knock-out (5-HTT KO) mouse model of depression (Uzungil et al., 2022). Importantly, iron is a co-factor for monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis (Roberts & Fitzpatrick, 2013) and involved in reactive oxygen species production (Crichton et al., 2011), which is implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology (Bakunina et al., 2015; Bhatt et al., 2020). Critically, we found that acute deferiprone treatment had no effect on levels of iron in multiple brain regions, indicating that deferiprone\u2019s antidepressant-like properties are not mediated directly through altering iron levels (Uzungil et al., 2022).\nThe new class of fast-acting antidepressants including ketamine, exhibit their antidepressant properties by affecting glutamatergic signalling (Zarate et al., 2006). The mechanism of action includes altering AMPA and NMDA receptor activity, in addition to astrocytic recycling of glutamate via the GLT-1 transporter (Aleksandrova et al., 2017; Y. Chen et al., 2022). The downstream effect of ketamine and typical monoaminergic antidepressants is to enhance synaptic plasticity (Abdallah et al., 2016; R. S. Duman et al., 2016; N. Li et al., 2010). Dysfunctional synaptic plasticity is a prominent pathology of MDD and an important mechanism for the therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs (R. S. Duman et al., 2016).\nAdditionally, glutamatergic receptor signalling is mediated by nNOS activity, which is an enzyme implicated in MDD by affecting synaptic plasticity (Zhou et al., 2018). Excess levels of nitric oxide has been found in patients with MDD and the SSRI paroxetine reduces levels of nitric oxide, via the inhibition of its precursor enzyme\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The nNOSPSD-95-NMDA synaptic complex has developed as a novel target for antidepressant drugs (Doucet et al., 2012). Relevant to the iron chelator deferiprone, the metal influences levels of nitric oxide; and deferiprone was shown to alter eNOS levels in the periphery (Koskenkorva-Frank et al., 2013; Sriwantana et al., 2018). The nitric oxide system also influences 5-HTT function as activity of nNOS results in phosphorylation of 5-HTT via intracellular kinase activity (Chanrion et al., 2007; Garthwaite, 2007; Zhu et al., 2004).\nIn addition to glutamate, dopaminergic signalling is dysregulated in MDD patients and drugs acting on dopaminergic signalling can augment antidepressant properties of therapeutics (Belujon & Grace, 2017; Kato & Chang, 2013; Thase et al., 2007). Tyrosine hydroxylase is the precursor enzyme involved in the production of dopamine, with phosphorylation of the serine 40 residue involved in mediating the enzyme\u2019s activity (Daubner et al., 1992). Iron is a co-factor involved in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, with the iron chelator deferoxamine increasing levels of pTH-Ser40 in cell culture (Connor et al., 2009; Roberts & Fitzpatrick, 2013).\nThe 5-HTT KO mouse model was used in the current study as polymorphisms of the 5-HTT gene are implicated in MDD and these mice display depression-related behaviours (Caspi et al., 2003; E. A. Duman & Canli, 2015; Kalueff et al., 2010; Uzungil et al., 2022; Wilson et al., 2020). An additional utility of the 5-HTT KO mouse is that it is considered a treatment resistant model, as both allelic polymorphisms of the 5-HTT gene and 5-HTT KO mice have reduced response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs (Holmes et al., 2002; Serretti et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2020). 5-HTT KO mice also have increased expression of oxidative stress, a mechanism known to be perturbed by iron levels (Crichton et al., 2011; M\u00f6ssner et al., 2002).\nBrain-wide regions are implicated in MDD, with prefrontal cortex dysfunction being consistently paired in both preclinical and clinical studies (Pandya et al., 2012; Pizzagalli & Roberts, 2022). Similarly, the 5-HTT KO mouse model exhibits prefrontal cortex dysfunction that is associated with protein and signalling pathway dysregulation\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

We had previously observed that acute deferiprone treatment had an effect on the activity of numerous brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (Uzungil et al., 2022). Due to the relative functional homogeneity of the prefrontal cortex, in the current study we focused on determining the action of deferiprone in this brain region.\nOne method to determine global molecular actions of deferiprone is to conduct a phosphoproteomics analysis following acute administration of the drug. Phosphorylation or dephosphorylation is a protein post-translational modification event which can be used as an indirect maker of protein activity or inactivity (Ramazi & Zahiri, 2021). Our lab has previously demonstrated a reversal of phosphoproteomic dysregulation in Huntington\u2019s disease mice following environmental enrichment (Mees, Li, et al., 2022).There is evidence that patients with MDD have an altered phosphoproteome, with synaptic proteins being implicated in the differential expression profile (Martins-de-Souza et al., 2012). A phosphoproteomics analysis has also been utilised to determine that synaptic protein phosphorylation is involved in the antidepressant-like properties of ketamine following acute treatment (Xiao et al., 2020). The 5-HTT KO mouse also has altered prefrontal cortex phosphorylation of key proteins (Goodfellow et al., 2014).\nUtilising a phosphoproteomics analysis, whose experimental workflow is depicted in Fig. 1, the current study explored the molecular effects of acute deferiprone treatment on the 5-HTT KO mouse model of depression. To determine the drug\u2019s mechanism of action and potentially link it to the behavioural antidepressant-like properties, we assessed protein phosphorylation changes following acute treatment of deferiprone in the prefrontal cortex.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

            "text": "Our study is the first to explore molecular actions of deferiprone following the discovery that the drug has acute antidepressant-like effects. This was done by exploring the effects of deferiprone on the phosphoproteome of the 5-HTT KO mouse model of depression. Analysing prefrontal cortex samples in WT mice, we found that deferiprone predominantly implicated phosphoproteins which are involved in cytoskeletal organisation. Meanwhile in KO mice, the phosphoproteome data indicated that proteins involved in glutamatergic signalling, synaptic, dopaminergic and cytoskeletal organisation were affected by deferiprone treatment. As we have previously found deferiprone has acute antidepressant-like properties in the Porsolt swim test (PST) in KO mice and in both genotypes in the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) (Uzungil et al., 2022), it is possible that these molecular factors may be underpinning deferiprone\u2019s potential therapeutic properties.\nThe drug\u2019s molecular actions were determined through an examination of the effect of deferiprone on phosphorylation, as it is an indirect marker of protein activity and one of the most common post-translational modifications dictating biological function (Ramazi & Zahiri, 2021). Its relevance for depression research is due to the fact that dysregulation of the phosphoproteome is observed in MDD patients, as well as other CNS disorders (Martins-de-Souza et al., 2012; Morshed et al., 2021). Furthermore, phosphoproteomics analysis has been utilised to determine the acute molecular mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs such as ketamine (Xiao et al., 2020). Our study focused on determining the effect of deferiprone in the prefrontal cortex as we had previously found that the drug increased neural activity in this region in both genotypes (Uzungil et al., 2022), in addition to the prefrontal cortex being relatively homogenous in regards to cytoarchitecture and function compared to other brain regions."

S. Duman et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2012; N. Li et al., 2010). 5-HTT KO mice also have deficits in synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine densities, indicating a potential critical dysfunction resulting in the observed depression-related phenotype of this mouse model (Chaji et al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021). It is therefore possible that the 5-HTT KO selective effects of deferiprone on phosphorylation of synaptic signalling proteins may be due to genotype specific synaptic signalling dysfunction. The 5-HTT KO selective effects on protein phosphorylation may also explain the antidepressantlike behavioural effects we have previously observed in this depression mouse model (Uzungil et al., 2022). A phosphoproteomics analysis of ketamine treatment had also found effects on synaptic transmission, indicating a potential shared mechanism of action with deferiprone (Xiao et al., 2020). We have identified Pacsin1a, a phosphoprotein involved in synaptic function, as hypophosphorylated by deferiprone. Interestingly, the differentially expressed Serine 343 phosphosite of Pacsin1 has been shown to result in internalisation of AMPA receptors when phosphorylated (Anggono et al., 2013), suggesting that deferiprone may increase AMPA receptor availability by preventing internalisation.\nAnother synaptic protein which was hypophosphorylated following deferiprone treatment in 5-HTT KO mice was the scaffolding protein disks large homolog 4 (Dlg4), otherwise known as PSD-95, on the serine 418 phosphosite. Interestingly, this phosphosite is regulated upstream by LTP suggesting a direct link between deferiprone treatment and synaptic function in the 5-HTT KO mice (J. Li et al., 2016). Serotonin plays a modulatory role on synaptic plasticity through an interaction with synaptic density proteins including PSD-95, which may underpin genotype specific effects of deferiprone in our model of serotonergic dysfunction (B\u00e9camel et al., 2004; Lesch & Waider, 2012).\nPSD-95 also plays a key role in glutamatergic signalling, as it was 1 of 3 differentially expressed phosphosites following deferiprone treatment in 5-HTT KO mice linked to the KEGG \u201cglutamatergic synapse\u201d pathway. This was not surprising as synaptic processes are altered by glutamatergic neurotransmitter signalling (Popoli et al., 2011). The other 2 phosphosites implicated in \u201cglutamatergic synapse\u201d pathway were the transporters, Slc1a2 otherwise known as GLT-1 (which had the largest increase in\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Although the GLT-1 differentially expressed phosphosite has not been previously annotated, GLT-1 has been implicated in antidepressant activity and is a glial glutamate transporter (Pham et al., 2020). Ketamine and fluoxetine\u2019s antidepressant properties have both been linked to their actions at GLT-1 (J.-X. Chen et al., 2014; Gasull-Cam\u00f3s et al., 2017, 2018; Jia et al., 2020). Ketamine blocks GLT-1 activity which results in an increase in AMPA receptor activity, which therein has its antidepressant-like actions in the prefrontal cortex through an enhancement of serotonergic activity, identifying the link between GLT-1 function and serotonergic transmission (Gasull-Cam\u00f3s et al., 2017, 2018). The serine 52 hyperphosphorylation of Slc38a1 has been linked to upstream regulation by RICTOR, which enhances mTOR signalling (Robitaille et al., 2013). mTOR synaptic signalling has been linked to rapid antidepressant effects of NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine, and may therefore signify a downstream effect on phosphorylation at Slc38a1 (N. Li et al., 2010). Therefore, the 5-HTT KO selective effect of deferiprone on glutamatergic transmission and synaptic signalling may potentially underpin the previously discovered genotype specific antidepressant-like effect in the PST (Uzungil et al., 2022).\nAnother protein of interest which was altered following deferiprone treatment in 5-HTT KO mice was tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters. This is relevant as iron is a co-factor in TH and necessitates iron availability for its function (Ramsey et al., 1996). Interestingly, the increase in phosphorylation of the serine 40 residue following acute deferiprone treatment in 5-HTT KO mice, observed in the phosphoproteomics analysis, has been implicated as a downstream effect of various antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs including ketamine, haloperidol and clozapine (H\u00e5kansson et al., 2004; Nishi et al., 2008; Snyder et al., 2007). This evidence suggests that deferiprone has a similar effect of phosphorylating TH as other psychiatric drugs, which is known to be an important mechanism for their therapeutic actions.\nOur western blot analysis confirmed the increase in phosphorylation of TH of the serine 40 residue observed in 5-HTT KO mice during the phosphoproteomics analysis. Additionally, the western blot analysis also found an increase pTH-Ser40 following acute deferiprone treatment in WT mice. Importantly we observed no change in levels\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

These findings confirm previous observations in cell culture that iron chelators such as deferoxamine increase levels of pTH and the pTH/TH ratio, which was reflected in our deferiprone findings (Connor et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of the serine 40 residue of TH has been shown to play a critical role in dopaminergic transmission, synaptic plasticity and reward related behavioural outcomes, factors that are all implicated in MDD (Liu et al., 2018; McIntosh et al., 2013). In addition to glutamatergic and synaptic protein phosphorylation effects of acute deferiprone treatment which we have mentioned, TH and dopaminergic pathways might be an additional molecular mechanism which contributes to the antidepressant-like properties of deferiprone. Critically, linking these mechanisms, dopaminergic pathways are important for ketamine\u2019s antidepressant properties, suggesting a combinatory role of glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission in effective antidepressants (Belujon et al., 2016; Belujon & Grace, 2017; Carreno et al., 2016). These findings suggest that acute iron chelation increases phosphorylation of TH at the serine 40 reside which via downstream pathways has the potential to have positive effects on behaviours associated with MDD.\nIt is possible that the acute antidepressant/anxiolytic-like effects of deferiprone observed in the NSFT in both genotypes is primarily driven by an increase in pTHSer40 levels (Uzungil et al., 2022). This hypothesis would be in line with prior findings that reward processes and dopaminergic signalling are implicated in NSFT performance (Bahi & Dreyer, 2019; Shuto et al., 2020). Moreover, the lateral amygdala is also involved in consummatory motivational processing in the NSFT (Cabeza et al., 2021) and was a region which we found to be heavily implicated in the action of deferiprone (Uzungil et al., 2022), Therefore, it is possible that the behavioural effects of deferiprone in both genotypes in the NSFT is driven by the increase in pTH-Ser40 levels.\nAlthough our western blot analysis reflects the findings of increased pTH-Ser40 expression in 5-HTT KO mice during phosphoproteomics analysis, the increase in WT mice in western blot analysis was not replicated in the phosphoproteomics analysis. It is possible that the increased variability in WT groups compared to 5-HTT KO groups\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

            "text": "cytoskeletal organisation in both genotypes The phosphoproteomics dataset indicates that in both genotypes, cytoskeletal organisation signalling was affected by acute deferiprone treatment in the prefrontal cortex. A prominent cytoskeletal protein which was the only hypophosphorylated phosphopeptide following deferiprone treatment in both genotypes was alpha-adducin (ADD1). Another adducin protein beta-adducin (ADD2), which had the second largest fold-change increase following deferiprone treatment in 5-HTT KO mice, has been shown to be altered in the brains of patients with MDD (Martins-de-Souza et al., 2012). Furthermore, hyperphosphorylation of the ADD2 Serine 602 phosphosite has been linked to upstream regulation by ERK 1/2 activity (Zennadi et al., 2012), which is a signalling pathway involved in the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine (R\u00e9us et al., 2014). Neuronal plasticity is dependent upon the dynamics of the cellular cytoskeleton to alter the architecture of the dendrite and form neurite outgrowths (Fukazawa et al., 2003; Szab\u00f3 et al., 2016). Post-translational modification of cytoskeletal proteins have been shown to be maladaptive in MDD and stress induced models of depression (Martins-de-Souza et al., 2012; Soetanto et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2013). Conversely, both fluoxetine and ketamine have actions on cytoskeletal proteins to alter synaptic remodelling, necessary for their antidepressant-like actions (Bianchi et al., 2009; Colic et al., 2019; Zunszain et al., 2013). One example of a protein which was differentially expressed following deferiprone treatment in WT mice was stathmin 1 (STMN1) which has a role in microtubule dynamics and plays a role in synaptic plasticity. Polymorphisms of the STMN1 gene in humans has been linked to cognitive and affective disturbances indicating the role of this protein in depression-related behaviours including emotional interference processing (Ehlis et al., 2011). The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that STMN1 also plays a role in the MAPK signalling pathway, which is implicated in the rapid antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in animal models (R\u00e9us et al., 2014).

Finally, in agreement with our previous findings that deferiprone was not altering iron levels in various brain regions following acute treatment (Uzungil et al., 2022), we found that there were only a couple of phosphopeptides involved in iron regulation (BLVRA and NDRG1). Our findings indicate that deferiprone is predominantly acting in an ironindependent manner to phosphorylate proteins in the prefrontal cortex. This would suggest that deferiprone is acting in an iron-independent manner to exert its antidepressant-like properties."

As deferiprone has been shown to effect eNOS activity peripherally, the PSD-95/NMDA/nNOS complex may be implicated in the actions of the drug (Doucet et al., 2012; Sriwantana et al., 2018). Further evidence for the potential role of the NOS pathway in the actions of deferiprone is reflected in the hypophosphorylation of a phosphosite of the histamine H1 receptor (HRH1) in 5-HTT KO mice, as histamine has been shown to increase nNOS activity at HRH1, however the serine 344 phosphosite has not been extensively annotated (Yang & Hatton, 2002). In addition to HRH1, in WT mice we found that deferiprone treatment resulted in reduced phoshphorylation of serine 2 phosphosite on the NDRG1 protein. Nitrosative stress, which is implicated in MDD, antidepressants and iron regulation, is involved in NDRG1 activity whereby nitric oxide upregulates NDRG1 activity (Dhir & Kulkarni, 2011; Finkel et al., 1996; Hickok et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2001). Iron chelation by non-deferiprone drugs including deferoxamine were shown to upregulate NDRG1 levels, which influences neurotransmitter release, however the effect on this phosphosite was not explored (Kovacevic & Richardson, 2006; Le & Richardson, 2004). The effect of deferiprone on NOS signalling proteins PSD-95, HRH1 and NDRG1 in either genotype coupled with role of iron chelators in NOS pathways demands further exploration of the potential NOS-driven acute antidepressant-like properties of deferiprone.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The GO overrepresentation analysis did not reveal any process as being increased in the differential expression list against a reference genome indicating there was not a large change to the phosphoproteome. However, many kinases and phosphatases have been previously implicated in 5-HTT trafficking and function which we did not find to have an effect on the phosphoproteome in the prefrontal cortex (Annamalai et al., 2012; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Jayanthi et al., 2005; Ragu Varman et al., 2021; Samuvel et al., 2005). Although the prefrontal cortex is dysregulated in 5-HTT KO mice, it may not be the region of the most widespread changes in kinase/phosphatase activity. Instead, regions which we found to be differentially activated in 5-HTT KO mice in our previous c-Fos study included the dorsal raphe and amygdala (Uzungil et al., 2022), which may exhibit more extensive changes to the phosphoproteome. Furthermore, the hippocampus is another region which has extensive changes in the 5-HTT KO mice and may be another region of interest (Renoir et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2021).\nWe were also able to confirm that the detected differential expression of phosphosites were not due to changes in total protein levels as none of the targets were altered in expression in the global proteomics analysis. Proteins such as BNDF and synaptic scaffolding proteins from previous studies that were shown to be reduced in KO rodents unfortunately were not identified in the current study (Brivio et al., 2019; Molteni et al., 2010). This is likely due to the methodology of proteomics analysis which is not sensitive to proteins with low abundance (Geiger et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2019). However, as proteins associated with our differentially expressed phosphosites were not changed in the global proteomics analysis, this indicates that the phosphoproteomics results were not confounded by changes in absolute protein levels in 5-HTT KO mice.\nAn interesting finding was that compared to 5-HTT KO mice, WT mice treated with deferiprone had greater proportion of differentially expressed phosphosites which were hypophosphorylated.

As none of the differentially expressed phosphosites following deferiprone treatment were differentially expressed constitutively due to genetic ablation of the 5-HTT either during phosphoproteomics analysis, or the associated protein in global proteomics analysis, these findings would suggest a differential molecular response to deferiprone treatment in each genotype. This finding would be compatible with our previous reporting on the difference in behavioural, brain region activity and functional network connectivity following deferiprone treatment in either genotype (Uzungil et al., 2022). It is therefore possible that the 5-HTT KO specific therapeutic properties of deferiprone may be driven by an increase in phosphorylation/activity of proteins implicated in depression pathways which is not replicated in WT animals."

A phosphoproteomics analysis of smaller regions with cellular homogeneity may reveal more robust effects of deferiprone on molecular targets. As deferiprone has been previously shown to have antidepressant-like properties and the current phosphoproteomics analysis has identified molecular mechanisms involved in the action of existing antidepressant, this study is an important benchmark for further experimentation. It would also be informative to examine other brain regions implicated in the antidepressant-like properties of deferiprone and MDD such as the amygdala, as they may reveal additional molecular factors involved in deferiprone\u2019s therapeutic mechanism of action.\nThe data indicates that acute deferiprone treatment on the prefrontal cortex alters phosphorylation of proteins involved in synaptic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic signalling in the 5-HTT KO mouse model of depression. Additionally, there was an effect on proteins involved in cytoskeletal organisation irrespective of genotype. It is likely too simplistic to suggest that one protein or neurotransmitter is involved in the positive effects of a therapeutic in a complex disorder like MDD. Instead, it is probable that a combinatory effect of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter signalling on synaptic plasticity and cytoskeletal protein mechanisms are involved in deferiprone\u2019s antidepressant-like properties.

These results would indicate that deferiprone has actions similar to the fast-acting antidepressant glutamatergic antagonist ketamine.
