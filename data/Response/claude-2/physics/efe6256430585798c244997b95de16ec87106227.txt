 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Isolate and characterize the metallophores responsible for REE binding in the strains identified. Determine the chemical structure and binding affinities.

2. Investigate the genetics involved in metallophore production and regulation. Identify the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms. 

3. Test a wider diversity of bacterial strains for REE metallophore activity to determine how widespread this ability is taxonomically.

4. Determine the toxicity thresholds and mechanisms of REEs in diverse bacterial species beyond standard lab strains like E. coli. 

5. Explore the biotechnological potential of metallophores for REE biorecovery and recycling from waste streams and low grade ores. Test binding and recovery efficiency.
