    "abstractText": "The current recommendations by Indian experts who are focused on the challenges in the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in rural areas, due to limited catheterization (CATH) lab facilities and interventional cardiologist coverage across the country, are described. 120 cardiologist experts drafted recommendations during ten advisory board meetings conducted from April to May 2022. Experts framed statements based on experience, collective clinical judgment from practical experience, and available scientific evidence regarding ACS. The consensus positioned fondaparinux as highly useful in non-CATH-lab-based hospitals for patients diagnosed with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) patients who cannot be shifted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable centres, or for patients who are thrombolysed at peripheral centres.",

            "text": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the foremost causes of mortality worldwide. India has a tremendous ACS load globally, with a burden 3\u20134 times that of America, 6 times that of China, and 20 times that of Japan. ACS accounts for 3 million fatalities (25% of all deaths) annually in India [1, 2]. One of the main challenges in rural communities is the combination of health disparities not necessarily found in larger communities and limited\nservices for managing critical conditions like ACS. Thus, cardiologists in a rural setting face a medically underserved population, which results in a patient base that traditionally has little or no preventive care, which equates to higher mortality rates.\nIn 1960, urban India had a 2% prevalence of ischemic heart disease, but by 2013, this had increased by approximately 7 times to 14%. Similarly, rural areas experienced an increase in prevalence, with the disease more than quadrupling from 1.7 to 7.4% between 1970 and 2013. Among individuals living in villages, the prevalence of coronary heart disease was 1.7% for males and 1.5% for females [3]. A significant ACS registry from Kerala also found that over 40% of patients with ST-segment elevation MI sought medical attention more than 6 h after experiencing symptoms. Furthermore, the quality of medical care received in rural areas during and after hospitalization was inferior compared to that provided in urban areas [4].\nAnother priority for rural populations should be timely connectivity to hospitals with wellequipped centres for ACS patients. The lack of primary care leads to emergency departments being overburdened with non-urgent medical needs. This is necessary when transporting patients, such as those experiencing an ST elevation ACS (STE-ACS), from areas more than 30 min away [5].\nIndia has the highest burden of ACS globally, yet little is known about the treatments and outcomes of these diseases [6]. There is an inverse relation between mortality rates and socio-economic strata of patients. Due to a lack of timely intervention, the actual mortality is likely higher than reported, and the difference across socioeconomic strata might be more pronounced [7].\nThe availability and accessibility of PCIequipped centres and qualified technicians is limited in rural parts of India. Furthermore, international guidelines for ACS management are not standardized in India and may not be suitable in all geographies. Hence, there is an urgent need for expert recommendations and an adaptable protocol for the management of ACS specifically in rural areas. This document provides adequate guidance for doctors working\nin non-catheterization (CATH)-lab-based hospital settings without cardiologist support where a simple guide or treatment protocol could be useful for achieving better initial management of patients arriving with a symptom of ACS. This article does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors."

            "text": "ACS refers to any constellation of clinical symptoms similar to acute myocardial ischaemia. ACS is categorized into ST elevation ACS (STE-ACS), non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), and unstable angina (UA). STE-ACS occurs due to the complete and prolonged occlusion of an epicardial coronary blood vessel and is defined based on confirmatory tests: ECG criteria and troponin levels (Fig. 1). Globally, 38% of patients who present to a hospital with ACS have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction [8]. NSTE-ACS usually occurs due to severe coronary artery narrowing, transient occlusion, or microembolization of the thrombus or atheromatous material. NSTE-ACS patients have symptoms consistent with ACS and troponin\nelevation but no electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with STE-ACS. Unstable angina and NSTE-ACS differ primarily in the presence or absence of a detectable troponin leak [9]. The history, a physical examination, an ECG, biochemical markers, and an echocardiogram (ECHO) are essential for making an appropriate diagnosis [10]. ECG availability and ECG-based diagnosis remains the crucial primary step for diagnosing and managing any case of ACS. If a patient presents with ST elevation or anterior ST depression, it should be considered a STEMI until proven otherwise and treated as such. Transient ST elevation, ST depression, or new T-wave inversions are indicative of NSTEMI. To diagnose NSTEMI, patients must have symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated troponin levels but no ECG changes consistent with STEMI. The primary difference between unstable angina and NSTEMI is the presence or absence of a detectable troponin leakage [9]."

            "text": "The initial goal of therapy for ACS is focused on stabilizing the patient\u2019s condition, relieving\nischaemic pain, and providing antithrombotic therapy to reduce myocardial damage and prevent further ischaemia. Initial management includes morphine, oxygen, sublingual or intravenous nitro-glycerine, aspirin (162\u2013325 mg), and clopidogrel (300\u2013600 mg loading dose). High-risk patients with NSTEACS are managed with aspirin, clopidogrel, unfractionated heparin, or low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH), intravenous platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex blockers (e.g. tirofiban, eptifibatide), and a beta-blocker for early revascularization [11, 12].\nFor over a decade, aspirin and clopidogrel have been the standard of care for preventing major thrombotic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The PLATO study compared ticagrelor and clopidogrel in patients with either ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and found that ticagrelor use was associated with a 16% reduction in the first occurrence of vascular death, MI, or stroke compared to clopidogrel [13] (Table 1).\nBased on the evidence summarized above and the institute-specific protocols, the physician\u2019s discretion, and patient requirements, appropriate antiplatelet therapy to manage ACS can be decided upon.\nAnticoagulant therapies form the cornerstone of ACS management. Previously, unfractionated heparin (UFH) was the most commonly used parenteral anticoagulant; however, there are limitations with UFH, such as an adjustable dose\u2013response, a small therapeutic window that requires frequent monitoring, and a higher risk of side effects such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, severe haemorrhage, and osteoporosis [6]. Enoxaparin, a LMWH, has primarily replaced unfractionated heparin in clinical practice due to fewer side effects, its higher anti-factor (AFXa) activity, and its more predictable dose\u2013response relationship. However, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) still remains the most clinically relevant non-haemorrhagic complication. In contrast to heparin and LMWHs, fondaparinux does not bind to PF4, most likely because it has fewer negatively charged sulfate groups than heparinoids and lacks the sugar domain\nrequired to bind to PF4. More extensive clinical trials in which patients received fondaparinux failed to show any HIT cases [17].\nThe use of anticoagulants is limited due to several factors. One of these factors is inadequate knowledge and awareness of the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants in managing ACS. Additionally, primary healthcare professionals at nursing homes who do not have CATH labs are hesitant to prescribe anticoagulants because of the risk of bleeding. Poor adherence to medication and routine monitoring is also a barrier to anticoagulation. Patient self-monitoring and self-management are not fully utilized [18]. In the same context, the OASIS-6 trial investigated the effectiveness of fondaparinux in STEMI patients. The study found that fondaparinux was more effective in preventing death or MI at 30 days compared to unfractionated heparin in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (HR = 0.79; P = 0.003) [19] (Table 2).\nThe introduction of fondaparinux was a fundamental milestone in anticoagulation because it provided proof of the concept of selective factor Xa inhibition with excellent clinical results [24].\nAccording to the 2020 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, fondaparinux is recommended as a choice of antithrombotic treatment in NSTE-ACS patients without atrial fibrillation who are to undergo PCI intervention following a delay while the patient is transferred within a stipulated time frame. A single bolus of UFH is administered at the time of PCI to prevent the risk of catheter thrombosis [25].\nThe ESC guidelines (2017) recommend daily fondaparinux after an STE-ACS patient has been treated with streptokinase. As per the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, fondaparinux is recommended for index hospitalization for up to 8 days or until revascularization when there is any anticipated delay to performing primary PCI within 120 min [26] (Table 3)."

If STE-ACS is suspected, success in outcomes will depend on adequate pre-hospital care resources and prompt access to the healthcare facility. This requires efficient logistics and transportation, trained medical personnel, availability of therapeutics, and optimal communication with the healthcare providers in the affiliated hospital, enabling early activation of the CATH lab. In this context, educating primary healthcare physicians regarding the diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of ACS remains the mainstay of this protocol development."
