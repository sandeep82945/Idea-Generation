 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a quantitative study using a survey to examine students' perceptions of the "risk factors" and important skills related to resilience against media manipulation. This could complement the qualitative findings from the content analysis. 

2. Explore teachers' perspectives on incorporating topics related to media literacy and critical thinking into compulsory education through interviews or focus groups. This could provide insights into the feasibility and challenges of implementing the proposals.

3. Develop and evaluate educational interventions, tools or programs aimed at improving media literacy and critical thinking skills related to identifying and handling media manipulation among students. 

4. Examine the relationships between the identified "risk factors" and actual susceptibility to or sharing of misinformation among students using regression analysis or structural equation modeling. 

5. Conduct cross-cultural comparisons of media literacy education approaches and students' resilience against media manipulation across different countries. This could identify effective strategies to implement more broadly.
