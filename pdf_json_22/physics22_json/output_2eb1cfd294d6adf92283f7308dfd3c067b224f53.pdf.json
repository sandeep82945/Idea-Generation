            "text": "Proton radioactivity is one of the typical decay mode for odd-Z emitters beyond the proton drip line and is the only decay mode for some intermediate-mass nuclei [1]. Since its first discovery in 1970 [2], proton radioactivity has become a powerful tool for studying the nature and structure of proton-rich nuclei, as it can provide information about shell structure, bound and unbound nuclear states, etc. [3]. In addition, the proton radioactivity energy and orbital angular momentum carried by the emitted proton have a significant effect on the half-life of the proton radioactivity [4]. Therefore, the proton radioactivity studies help to determine the orbital angular momentum carried by the emitted proton and characterize its wave function within the nucleus [5\u20139].\nUp to now, there are many methods or models used to study the proton radioactivity half-life can be classified into two categories [10]. One involves quantum mechanical tunneling through the nuclear mean-field of single-particle resonances [11\u201314]. Typical methods or models are the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock (HF) calcu-\nlation using effective phenomenological interactions and covariant density functional theory (CDFT) in the relativistic mean-field (RMF) form [14, 15]. Another is the calculation of the probability of proton penetration into the potential barrier by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation [16, 17], such as two-potential approach (TPA) [18], the single-folding model (SFM) [19, 20], the Coulomb potential and proximity potential model (CPPM) [21, 22], and so on. In the study of proton radioactivity, the nuclear potential between emitted proton and daughter nucleus usually determines the accuracy of the model and calculations. In our previous study of proton radioactivity half-life, we successfully described the emitted proton-daughter nucleus nuclear potential using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) microscopic model [23, 24]. Furthermore, we compared 115 sets of Skyrme interaction parameters constructed for different purposes and found that the most suitable Skyrme parameter to describe the proton radioactivity half-life is SLY7. The construction of the Skyrme interaction parameters is mainly for reasonably describing the ground state properties of nuclei on the periodic ta-\n\u2217 This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12175100), the construct program of the key discipline in Hunan province, the Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province, China (Grant No. 18A237), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (Grant Nos. 2015JJ3103, 2015JJ2123), the Innovation Group of Nuclear and Particle Physics in USC.\n1)E-mail: lixiaohuaphysics@126.com \u00a92020 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of\nModern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd\n010201-1\nble of elements and the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) rather than for the description of the proton radioactivity process of the nucleus. Therefore, all work using Skyrme-Hartree-Fock to study proton radioactivity may requires a set of Skyrme parameters specifically for calculating proton radioactivity instead of the existing Skyrme parameters. In this work, based on the relationship between the Skyrme parameter and the amount of macroscopic nuclear matter, we use the two-potential approach with Skyrme-HartreeFock (TPA-SHF) to study the sensitivity of proton radioactivity half-life to the amount of macroscopic nuclear matter [25]. Moreover, we give a set of Skyrme parameters for the study of proton radioactivity based on the constraints on the macroscopic quantities of nuclear matter.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Sec. II the theoretical framework for proton radioactivity half-life is described in detail. In Sec. III, the detailed calculations, discussion and predictions are provided. A brief summary is given in Sec. IV."

            "text": "The aim of this work is to study the proton radioactivity half-life based on the relationship between macroscopic quantities and Skyrme parameters [25]. For study the sensitivity of proton radioactivity to macroscopic quantities [25], we adopt the set of Skyrme parameters MSL0 obtained by empirical values of macroscopic quantities to ensure that the adjustment of macroscopic quantities is not out of line with the actual values. The macroscopic quantities and the corresponding Skyrme parameters are listed in Tab. 1. G\u20320(\u03c10) is the Landau parameter whose value can vary from approximately 0 to 1.6, depending on the method and the model [31\u201333]. In this work, the experimental data of spin, parity, the proton radioactivity energy Qp, and proton radioactivity half-lives are taken from the latest evaluated nuclear properties table NUBASE2020 [34] and the latest evaluated atomic mass table AME2020 [35, 36] except for those of 140Ho, 144Tm, 151Lu, 159Re, and 164Ir, which are taken from Ref. [37]. The standard deviation \u2206 indicates the divergence between experimental data and the the proton radioactivity halflives calculated by TPA-SHF, which can be expressed as \u2206= \u221a \u2211\n(lgTexp1/2(s)\u2212 lgT cal 1/2(s)) 2/n.\n010201-3\nUsing the MSL0 parameter set, we systematically calculate the proton radioactivity half-lives of 69\u2264 Z \u2264 81 nuclei with Sp = 1 [24]. The detailed results are plotted in Fig. 1. The blue circle and red triangle represent the logarithmic form of the experimental data and the logarithmic form of the calculated proton radioactivity half-life, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the proton radioactivity half-lives vary in a wide range from 10\u22126 s to 102s. Although the proton radioactivity half-life variation is up to eight orders of magnitude, the theoretical point follows the experimental point well and almost coincides with it. Furthermore, we can obtain the standard deviation \u2206 between the experimental\ndata, and the calculated proton radioactivity half-life is equal to 0.405, which means the theoretical proton radioactivity half-lives calculated by TAP-SHF with MSL0 (TPA-SHF-MSL0) can reproduce the experimental data well.\nTo clearly reveal the dependence of the theoretical proton radioactivity half-lives on each macroscopic quantity, we varied one portion at a time while keeping all other macroscopic quantities at their default values in MSL0. In the present work, the variation of each macroscopic quantity was controlled within the experimentally obtained values to ensure that the dependencies we obtained were meaningful. To intuitively reflect the relationship between the theoretical proton radioactivity half-life change and the evolution of each macroscopic quantity, we plotted the standard deviations between experimental data and the calculated proton radioactivity half-lives corresponding to the change of each macroscopic quantity in Fig. 2. From this figure, we can clearly see that the variety of different macroscopic quantities causes different effects on the standard deviations between experimental data and the calculated proton radioactivity half-lives. The standard deviation shows a robust correlation with \u03c10 and a relatively weak correlation with GS . For the other seven macroscopic quantities, their changes have little effect on the standard deviations between experimental data and the calculated proton radioactivity half-lives. The discovery of this relationship means that we can constrain the Skyrme parameters using two macroscopic quantities that significantly affect the standard deviation, which has a higher weight in the standard deviation calculation. Thus, a new set of Skyrme parameters suitable for calculating the proton radioactivity half-life is obtained with as few adjustable parameters as possible. Similarly, such a relationship, in\n010201-4\nturn, limits the range of these two macro parameters. Its means that the actual value of \u03c10 is around 0.156fm\n\u22123, and the real value of GS is about 187 MeV fm 5.\nIn this work, the new Skyrme parameter MQSP is given by fitting the two highest weight macroscopic quantities \u03c10 and GS , and the detailed results are listed in Tab. 2. The new theoretical value of the proton radioactivity half-life can be calculated by TAP-SHF with MQSP (TPA-SHF-MQSP). To verify the accuracy of our given new Skyrme parameters for calculating the proton radioactivity half-life, the universal decay law for proton radioactivity (UDLP) was chosen as a comparison. The UDLP is given by Qi et al. [38], which is an extension of the universal decay law (UDL) [39, 40]. In UDLP, the logarithm of proton radioactivity half-life can be expressed as\nlog10T 1 2 = a\u03c7\u2032+b\u03c1\u2032+c+dl(l+1), (25)\nwhere \u03c7\u2032 = ZpZd \u221a \u00b5\nQp and \u03c1\u2032 =\n\u221a\n\u00b5ZpZd(Ad 1 3 +Ap 1 3 ).\nHere the parameters a = 0.386, b = \u22120.502, c = \u221217.8 and d= 2.386 are determined by fitting to experimental data of proton radioactivity taken from Ref. [38]. As a comparison, we used TPA-SHF-MSL0,TPA-SHF-MQSP and UDLP to calculate the proton radioactivity half-life, respectively, and the results are listed in Tab. 3. In this table, the first four columns represent the parent nuclei, the orbital angular momentum l taken away by the emitted proton, the proton radioactivity energy Qp, and the logarithmic form of the experimental proton radioactivity half-lives, respectively. The following three columns represent the logarithmic form of theoretical proton radioactivity half-lives calculated by TPA-SHF with the Skyrme effective interaction of MSL0 (TPASHF-MSL0), TPA-SHF with the Skyrme effective interaction of MQSP(TPA-SHF-MQSP), and UDLP denoted as MSL0, MQSP, and UDLP, respectively. From this table, we can clearly see that the theoretical proton radioactivity half-lives calculated by TPA-SHF-MQSP can reproduce the experimental data well.\nTo intuitively compare the TPA-SHF-MSL0, TPASHF-MQSP, and UDLP with experimental data, the logarithmic deviations between experimental data of proton radioactivity half-lives and calculated ones are shown in Fig. 3. In this figure, the X-axis represents the mass number of proton radioactivity parent nucleus, and the Y-axis represents the logarithmic deviations. The three different colors and symbols refer to the calculations obtained by three different models. From Fig. 3, we can clearly see that the values of lg(T cal1/2\u2212T exp 1/2 ) obtained by TPA-SHF-MQSP are mainly near zero, indicating that the theoretical half-life of proton radioactivity calculated using our model is in good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, this figure shows that the calculations using TPA-SHF-MQSP can better reproduce the experimental data than TPA-SHF-MSL0 and UDLP for most nuclei. In order to intuitively compare\n010201-5\nthe deviations between the half-lives of proton radioactivity obtained by different models and experimental data, we calculated the standard deviation and obtained \u2206MSL0 =0.405, \u2206MQSP =0.362, and \u2206UDLP =0.459 represent standard deviations between lgTMSL01/2 , lgT MQSP 1/2 , lgTUDLP1/2 , andlgT exp 1/2 , respectively. These results show that the TPA-SHF-MQSP method is better than the other models in calculating the spherical proton radioactivity half-lives. Therefore, it is credible to use TPASHF-MQSP to study the proton radioactivity half-lives.\n1/2 . The black square, the red"
