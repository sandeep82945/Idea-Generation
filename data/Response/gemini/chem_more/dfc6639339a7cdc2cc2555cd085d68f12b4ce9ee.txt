1. **Investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, ergosterol, and menaquinone as MCM7 inhibitors.** This could involve testing the compounds in cell-based assays and animal models of cancer to determine their ability to inhibit MCM7 activity and suppress tumor growth.
2. **Explore the molecular mechanisms by which ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, ergosterol, and menaquinone inhibit MCM7 activity.** This could involve biochemical and biophysical studies to determine how the compounds interact with MCM7 and interfere with its function.
3. **Investigate the potential synergistic effects of combining ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, ergosterol, and menaquinone with other cancer therapies.** This could involve testing the compounds in combination with other drugs or radiation therapy to determine whether they can enhance the efficacy of these treatments.
4. **Develop novel MCM7 inhibitors based on the structural information obtained from the molecular docking and MD simulation studies.** This could involve designing and synthesizing new compounds that are predicted to have improved binding affinity and inhibitory activity against MCM7.
5. **Investigate the potential of ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, ergosterol, and menaquinone as chemopreventive agents for cancer.** This could involve studying the compounds in animal models of cancer to determine whether they can prevent or delay the development of tumors.
