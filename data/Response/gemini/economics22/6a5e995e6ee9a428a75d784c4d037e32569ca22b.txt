1. **Investigate the long-term impact of COVID-19-related changes in work and income loss on mental health issues.** This could be done through longitudinal studies that follow workers over time to assess how their mental health changes in response to the pandemic.
2. **Examine the impact of changes in working conditions and financial hardships on workers' mental health in different countries and cultures.** This would help to determine whether the findings of the current study are generalizable to other populations.
3. **Explore the role of social support and resilience in buffering the negative impact of COVID-19-related changes on workers' mental health.** This could be done through studies that examine the relationship between social support, resilience, and mental health outcomes among workers who have been affected by the pandemic.
4. **Develop and evaluate interventions to support workers' mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.** This could include interventions that focus on promoting psychological detachment from work, reducing work-family conflict, and increasing financial security.
5. **Examine the impact of COVID-19-related changes on the mental health of specific groups of workers, such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, and low-wage workers.** This would help to identify groups of workers who are particularly vulnerable to mental health problems during the pandemic and develop targeted interventions to support them.
