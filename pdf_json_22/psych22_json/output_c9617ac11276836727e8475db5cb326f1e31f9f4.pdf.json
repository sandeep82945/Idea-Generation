    "abstractText": "Risk factors for psychological distress among help-seeking youth are poorly understood. Addressing this gap is important for informing mental health service provision. This study aimed to identify risk factors among youth attending Jigsaw, a youth mental health service in Ireland. Routine data were collected from N = 9,673 youth who engaged with Jigsaw (Mean age = 16.9 years, SD = 3.14), including presenting issues, levels of psychological distress, age, and gender. Confirmatory Factor Analysis identified thirteen factors of clustering issues. Several factors, including Self-criticism and Negative Thoughts, were strongly associated with items clustering as psychological distress, however these factors were poorly predictive of distress as measured by the CORE (YP-CORE: R2 = 14.7%, CORE-10: R2 = 6.9%). The findings provide insight into associations between young people\u2019s identified presenting issues and self-identified distress. Implications include applying appropriate therapeutic modalities to focus on risk factors and informing routine outcome measurement in integrated youth mental health services.",

Common manifestations of youth mental health problems include anxiety, low mood or depression, self-harm, substance use, and behavioural problems [2, 3]. Youth mental health issues are associated with poorer educational and vocational outcomes [4], can negatively impact on personal relationships [5], and are a leading contributor to death by suicide [6]. Over time, youth mental health problems can develop into chronic mental health conditions in adulthood [7], with up to 80% of mental health conditions having an onset by age 26 [8]. Recent evidence from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland indicates an increase in mental health problems\namong adolescents (defined in this study as ages 12 to 17) and young adults (ages 18 to 25), particularly among females [9\u201311]. Across these studies, the rise in mental health problems corresponds to increases in levels of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicidality. Together, these mental health problems are commonly known as manifestations of psychological distress [12, 13]. The rise in psychological distress among youth is a significant cause for concern in protecting their health, survival, and quality of life, which warrants an investigation into the risk factors for psychological distress in youth."

            "text": "Previous research on risk factors has focused on personal psychological and behavioural risk factors, alongside contextual risk factors at different levels of young people\u2019s ecological systems [14]. In previous research on depression and anxiety, the evidence base for psychological risk factors (e.g. self-criticism, perfectionism, repetitive negative thoughts, and rumination) [15\u201321] and behavioural risk factors (e.g. alcohol use and conduct problems) [10], has drawn typically from cross-sectional studies. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to infer a causal relationship. However the * Niall Mac Dhonnag\u00e1in niall.mac-dhonnagain@ucdconnect.ie 1 School of\u00a0Psychology, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland 2 Jigsaw\u2014The National Centre for\u00a0Youth Mental Health, Dublin, Ireland 3 School of\u00a0Psychology, Ulster University, Coleraine, UK\n1 3\nevidence base is stronger regarding behavioural risk factors and self-harm, where longitudinal studies have shown that behavioural factors predict self-harm over time [22, 23]. Contextual risk factors identified previously include sociodemographic risk factors (e.g. low socio-economic status, minority sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, pansexual; LGBAP), ethnic minority status, female gender) [24\u201327], family risk factors (e.g. adverse childhood experiences, high levels of parental criticism) [10, 28], interpersonal risk factors (e.g. bullying, issues with peers and romantic relationships) [29\u201331], poor connectedness in school and long-term unemployment [32\u201334]. However, research has typically focused on isolated risk factors, with few studies including multiple risk factors to predict psychological distress in youth.\nA subsample of the general population of youth who are at high risk of psychological distress are help-seeking youth attending mental health services in primary care. For example, evidence from headspace Australia\u2014a youth mental health service established in 2006 [35] \u2014indicates that 69% of attendees to the service display high levels of psychological distress, compared to 9% of youth in the general population [36]. Yet, what is known about risk factors for psychological distress among youth largely draws from studies conducted in the general population [10, 24, 27, 37] rather than through research with help-seeking youth who demonstrate a higher level of risk. Although some studies have focused on risk factors for self-harm or on prior suicidality as a predictor of outcomes in help-seeking youth [38, 39], these studies did not provide insight into psychological, behavioural, and contextual factors predicting anxiety and depression. An examination of the patterns between risk factors and psychological distress specifically for help-seeking youth could inform service provision, helping to meet the needs of youth and improve mental health outcomes."

Examples include headspace Australia, Israel [35, 43], ACCESS Open Minds (Canada) [44], and Jigsaw (Ireland) [45]. Research to date has indicated that anxiety and depression or low mood are typically the most common presenting issues among help-seeking youth [36, 46\u201349]. However, young people are likely to attend services with more than one presenting issue, with previous research identifying selfcriticism, anger, substance use, and a range of contextual issues as common presenting issues [47, 50\u201352]. In addition, the co-occurrence of youth mental health difficulties is\nwell-established in previous research (e.g. co-occurrence of suicidal ideation and behavioural difficulties among youth) [53].Yet few studies have examined relationships between presenting issues [48], either to identify how presenting issues co-occur, or to identify whether there are clear factors underlying presenting issues that could be understood as risk factors for psychological distress among help-seeking youth."

Psychological distress scores were gathered by clinicians in the initial screening session, whereas presenting issues were typically inputted onto the JDS by clinicians following the initial screening and the assessment session. It was possible for clinicians to add further presenting issues to the JDS throughout the intervention. Presenting issues consisted of 123 binary items listed on the JDS, nested under eight categories (Thinking, Interaction, Physical, Feelings, Behaviour, School/Work, Family/Peers/Relationships, Community/Setting), with an open-ended space available under each category to describe additional presenting issues (a list of all presenting issues with information on prevalence is included in Table\u00a0S1, Supplementary Materials). Therefore presenting issues included but were not limited to a young person\u2019s mental health difficulties, with some presenting issues related to the young person\u2019s broader social context. Presenting issues were gathered based on the information the young person had shared with the clinician in the initial screening and assessment, but there were no standard definitions of the presenting issues provided to clinicians. Presenting issues were gathered on the JDS to assist clinicians with case management and for the purposes of research and evaluation in Jigsaw.\nPresenting issues identified by clinicians were coded \u201cYes\u201d on the JDS and items that were not selected were coded \u201cNo\u201d by default. As such, there were no missing data among the presenting issues. The content of open-ended presenting issues was examined and, where appropriate, re-coded into existing binary variables. In addition, where issues were observed to occur with some frequency, new presenting issue items were generated (e.g. Physical Discomfort and Sickness). Presenting issues with very low prevalence (i.e. < 1%) were omitted, yielding a final set of 82 presenting issue items for the analysis.\nPsychological distress was measured via the Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation (CORE) measures; either the YP-CORE [55] (for age 12 to 16\u00a0years; N = 5007) or the CORE-10 [56] (for ages 17 to 25\u00a0years, N = 4666).

Regarding missing data, only young people who completed all ten items of a CORE measure (N = 9664) or had only one item missing (N = 9) were included in the sample.

EFA models with 1 through to 14 factors were estimated using Weighted Least Squares Means- and Variances-adjusted (WLSMV) to allow for the analysis of binary data, under the assumption of bivariate normality underlying the presenting issues [59], and Oblique (Geomin) rotation was applied, allowing factors to correlate. Fit indices were used to assess the relative and absolute fit of all the models, summarised in Table\u00a01, where thresholds were in line with previous research [59\u201362]. Models with acceptable model fit were then tested using CFA.\nThe Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) were examined with caution, as both indices are affected by sample size [63]. For factor loadings (\u03bb), \u03bb \u2265 0.3 was considered acceptable [64], with items with \u03bb < 0.3 removed. At the factor level, Average Variance Explained (AVE) was calculated to compare convergent validity across factors, and Joreskog\u2019s Rho (\u03c1\u03b7) \u2265 0.7 was set as the threshold for composite reliability [65]. Factor analyses were conducted on Mplus 8.4 [66].\nTo address the second aim, Pearson correlations were conducted using factor scores to examine associations between individual factors derived from the factor analysis and psychological distress. For the third aim, multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive power of multiple factors on psychological distress. To assess multicollinearity, tolerance values of \u2265 0.1 were\n1 3\nconsidered acceptable for the multiple regression analysis [64]. Pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses were performed on SPSS 24 [67]."

Although the factors were poor predictors of the intensity of psychological distress as measured by the CORE and YPCORE, psychological, behavioural, and contextual factors were associated with presentations of Feeling Anxious, Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing, and Self-harm and Suicidality. This may have implications for service provision with youth, as this study highlights areas where youth can be supported with their mental health. In addition, the findings can inform data capture practices in IYMHS, including identifying presenting issues that accurately reflect the issues facing young people and informing routine outcome measurement in services.\nPresentations of Feeling Anxious, Feeling Depressed/ Withdrawing, and Self-harm and Suicidality were all\nassociated with psychological factors Self-criticism and Negative Thoughts. This supports previous cross-sectional studies where self-criticism and repetitive negative thinking were associated with psychological distress in youth [16\u201318], and shows that this association is strong among help-seeking youth. In previous research with adults, perfectionism and repetitive negative thinking have been identified as transdiagnostic risk factors, rather than factors that predict one specific type of mental health problem [68, 69]. As Self-criticism and Negative Thoughts were associated with each of Feeling Anxious, Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing and Self-harm and Suicidality in this study, this may reflect on the transdiagnostic nature of these risk factors for youth, although further research with youth is warranted.\nIn identifying an association between Self-criticism, Negative Thoughts, and manifestations of psychological distress, there are potential implications for service provision with youth. To help reduce negative thinking and self-criticism, therapeutic modalities such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) [70, 71] and Compassion-focused Therapy (CFT) [72] could be applied in brief interventions. IYMHS have commonly endorsed the use of CBT in brief interventions [42], but CFT is less commonly noted in IYMHS research to date [45].\nBehaviourally, Risky Behaviour and Acting Out were most closely associated with Self-harm and Suicidality, whilst also showing strong associations with Feeling Depressed/ Withdrawing. The relationship between behavioural factors and self-harm and suicidal behaviours is well-established in previous research [22, 23, 53] and supported by the findings of this study. Overall, this suggests that clinical staff should be mindful of behavioural presenting issues such as anger, alcohol use, and substance use among help-seeking youth\n1 3\nas potential indicators of risk of Self-harm and Suicidality, or of Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing. Indeed, behavioural risk factors are an under-researched area in IYMHS, where routinely-used outcome measures such as the CORE measures [55, 56] or the Kessler Distress Scale [73] typically do not pick up on behavioural issues affecting youth. Ongoing research in Orygen and headspace is underway to identify a wide set of standardised measures relevant to youth presentations [46]. The presence of behavioural presenting issues in this sample highlights the potential need to measure issues such as anger, and drug and alcohol misuse in help-seeking youth alongside measuring psychological distress.\nMost contextual factors were strongly associated with Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing. Problems with Peers was most strongly associated with Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing and Self-harm and Suicidality, supporting previous research in the general population which identified bullying,\nisolation, and difficult peer relationships as risk factors for psychological distress [29, 30]. For School Problems, youth presenting with procrastination, confusion, and general academic problems were also likely to present with signs of Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing. Together, these findings point to the school environment as an important area for supporting youth through anti-bullying strategies, supporting isolated youth, and young people experiencing difficulties with schoolwork, all of whom are vulnerable to developing psychological distress. The identification of a Trauma factor, again associated most strongly with Feeling Depressed/ Withdrawing and Self-harm and Suicidality supports previous research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as predictors of psychological distress [28]. In the context of providing brief intervention support, this reinforces the need for IYMHS to consider trauma-informed approaches when working with youth, which has been identified in national\nTable 4 Multiple regression\n***p < 0.001, **p < .01, *p < .05\nFactor YP-CORE\nB SE \u03b2 t\n(Constant) 1.933 1.145 1.687 Gender (female) 3.097 0.206 0.204 15.038*** Age 0.699 0.076 0.122 9.217*** Negative thoughts \u2212\u00a00.785 0.628 \u2212\u00a00.047 \u2212\u00a01.251 Self-criticism 4.635 0.942 0.174 4.922*** Acting out \u2212\u00a00.433 0.368 \u2212\u00a00.033 \u2212\u00a01.177 Risky behaviour \u2212\u00a00.177 0.510 \u2212\u00a00.008 \u2212\u00a00.348 Problems with family \u2212\u00a01.645 0.977 \u2212\u00a00.057 \u2212\u00a01.684 Problems with peers 0.156 0.602 0.007 0.259 Physical health and eating 2.256 0.499 0.079 4.517*** School problems 1.323 0.622 0.051 2.128* Trauma 1.568 0.791 0.071 1.983* Lack of support structures 0.709 0.829 0.029 0.856\nFactor CORE-10\nB SE \u03b2 t\n(Constant) 11.350 0.862 13.161*** Gender (female) 1.356 0.195 0.101 6.968*** Age 0.220 0.041 0.078 5.371*** Negative thoughts \u2212\u00a01.489 0.535 \u2212\u00a00.114 \u2212\u00a02.786** Self-criticism 1.887 0.818 0.089 2.308* Acting out \u2212\u00a01.357 0.354 \u2212\u00a00.100 \u2212\u00a03.835*** Risky behaviour 1.568 0.367 0.106 4.270*** Problems with family 0.394 0.842 0.016 0.468 Problems with peers 1.915 0.613 0.097 3.125** Physical health and eating 2.922 0.474 0.121 6.159*** School problems 1.082 0.550 0.050 1.968* Trauma 1.900 0.642 0.116 2.962** Lack of support structures \u2212\u00a02.448 0.626 \u2212\u00a00.142 \u2212\u00a03.910***\n1 3\nmental health policy in Ireland [74]. Physical Health and Eating was among the strongest predictors of Feeling Anxious, Feeling Depressed/Withdrawing, and Self-harm and Suicidality. The strong associations identified in this study may be explained in part by the co-morbidity between eating disorders, anxiety, low mood, and self-harm established in previous youth research [75].\nNotably, the associations between psychological, behavioural, and contextual factors and presentations of psychological distress did not translate into predicting the intensity of psychological distress in this study. The nature of data capture in the study may have contributed in part to this issue. Young people\u2019s presenting issues were captured as binary variables, and the factors were generated based on these data. However, many of these presenting issues have been studied as continuous variables in previous youth research [10, 17]. The reduction of these issues into binary data may have affected the predictive validity of the data. For example, young people who presented with perfectionism may have had mild, moderate, or severe presentations relating to this issue, and a binary variable did not reflect the dimensional nature of the underlying construct for this and similar presenting issues. Overall, this may have had implications for the predictive power of the factors on psychological distress."

            "text": "Strengths of this study include the large sample of helpseeking young people and the breadth of presenting issues gathered. Limitations include statistical restrictions in working with binary data where presenting issues had low prevalence, issues of clarity with some presenting issues, high levels of missing data among demographic variables, the cross-sectional nature of the data, and the focus on risk factors only without the consideration of protective factors for youth mental health. The benefits and shortcomings relating to each of these issues are discussed below with suggestions for future research and data capture practices with IYMHS.\nOne of the key strengths of this study is in the use of a large dataset which was routinely collected in an IYMHS. This allowed for an analysis of patterns of presenting issues and psychological distress in over 9000 help-seeking youth which builds on previous research with Jigsaw [47, 48], and adds to international research in improving our understanding of youth engagement with IYMHS [36, 50, 51]. Mental health research is a field that has typically been plagued with issues of small samples leading to analyses that are underpowered [76]. The use of routine outcome measurement in mental health services provides an opportunity to address this issue, by gathering data naturalistically with help-seeking individuals as they engage with services [77].\nA further strength of this dataset was in the breadth of presenting issues recorded. This allowed for the identification of factors that reflected on issues underlying presentations to IYMHS. Yet the heterogeneity of the presenting issues posed a challenge for measuring the predictive power of risk factors on psychological distress, as many presenting issues had low levels of prevalence. Of the original 123 presenting issues in the dataset, 82 issues were prevalent in more than 1% of the sample which were included in this analysis, and only 21 issues were prevalent in more than 10% of the sample. This led to statistical restrictions in this study, as low prevalence can reduce the accuracy of a variable predicting a given outcome [39]. In future, IYMHS might consider reducing the number of presenting issues on their data systems, which could be informed by the factors generated in this study (e.g. Panic Attacks, Heart Racing, and Anxiety could all merge under one Feeling Anxious factor), leading to a smaller number of concise presenting issues that more accurately predict psychological distress.\nYet there is also a case for the inclusion of other presenting issues or renaming presenting issues to clarify the nature of the issues affecting help-seeking youth. LGBAP sexuality, for example, has been identified in previous research as a risk factor for psychological distress [25]. In the dataset used in this study, sexual orientation was not captured, and the presenting issue labelled Sexual Identity Issues had very low prevalence. The label for this presenting issue was not sufficient to capture the diversity of sexual orientations among young people, which may have contributed to the low prevalence. Measurement of gender in this dataset was limited to male and female, although subsequent updates to the JDS are more inclusive as they allow young people to specify their gender identity. In addition, demographic variables showed high levels of missingness, possibly because it was not compulsory for staff to complete these sections on the JDS. This meant important equity-related variables, such as living circumstance, family of origin, and education and employment status could not be included in the analysis. To improve on this in future research, consistency may be achieved by allowing young people to complete the demographic questions themselves, for example while they are in a waiting room or at the beginning of a session with the assistance of their clinician.\nDue to the cross-sectional nature of the data, the relationships identified between risk factors and psychological distress do not provide insight into causality, instead highlighting co-existence between particular presentations and manifestations of psychological distress. Future research could potentially focus on longitudinal outcomes based on presentations to IYMHS, although the findings from this study demonstrate the methodological difficulties in establishing those associations.\n1 3\nFinally, the focus of the present study was on risk factors only, but young people also experience protective factors in areas such as family, peers, school, along with having personal strengths that were not measured in this study [14]. In future, data systems could also capture young people\u2019s strengths and protective factors, helping to provide a broader picture of the factors that are buffers against psychological distress alongside capturing risk factors."

            "text": "This study identified 13 factors underlying young people\u2019s presentations to Jigsaw, an IYMHS in Ireland, by analysing a large dataset of young people who had engaged with Jigsaw for a brief intervention. Factors were identified that were strongly associated with presentations of psychological distress, including Self-criticism, Negative Thoughts, Physical Health and Eating and Risky Behaviour. By identifying risk factors among a large sample of help-seeking youth, the findings provide insight into areas in which clinical staff may focus on during an intervention to help young people who are in distress. Furthermore, the challenges and limitations identified in this study in gathering young people\u2019s presenting issues and demographic information can inform IYMHS in improving routine outcome measurement and data capture with youth. Overall, this study provides a novel contribution to the growing field of IYMHS, which prioritises the application of evidence-informed mental health support to young people.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10578- 022- 01436-2.\nFunding This research was supported through the YouLead programme, funded by the Health Research Board in Ireland (Grant no.
