    "abstractText": "Drought is the single greatest abiotic factor influencing crop yield worldwide. Plants remain in one area for extended periods, making them vulnerable to natural and man-made influences. Understanding plant drought responses will help us develop strategies for breeding drought-resistant crops. Large proteome analysis revealed that leaf and root tissue proteins respond to drought differently depending on the plant\u2019s genotype. Commonly known as tomatoes, Solanum Lycopersicum is a globally important vegetable crop. However, drought stress is one of the most significant obstacles to tomato production, making the development of cultivars adapted to dry conditions an essential goal of agricultural biotechnology. Breeders have put quite a lot of time and effort into the tomato to increase its productivity, adaptability, and resistance to biotic and abiotic challenges. However, conventional tomato breeding has only improved drought resistance due to the complexity of drought traits. The resilience of tomatoes under drought stress has been the subject of extensive study. Using contemporary sequencing approaches like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has dramatically aided in discovering drought-responsive genes. One of the most prominent families of plant transcription factors, WRKY genes, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development in response to natural and abiotic stimuli. To develop plants that can withstand both biotic and abiotic stress, understanding the relationships between WRKY-proteins (transcription factors) and other proteins and ligands in plant cells is essential. This is despite the fact that tomatoes have a long history of domestication. This research aims to utilize Lupenone, a hormone produced in plant roots in response to stress, to increase drought resistance in plants. Lupenone exhibits a strong affinity for the WRKY protein at -9.64 kcal/mol. Molecular docking and modeling studies show that these polyphenols have a significant role in making Solanum Lycopersicum drought-resistant and improving PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281293 November 8, 2023 1 / 15 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

            "text": "Crop production faces considerable challenges from stress, salt, and drought\u2014two aspects of climate change that are particularly damaging to sustainable agriculture. Agriculture productivity is likely to be constrained due to the atmosphere, which is expected to become significantly less favorable as a result of ongoing greenhouse gas emissions [1]. As a result, evaporative and transportive losses, as well as soil dryness and salinity, would all increase, as would the danger of insect and disease infestation. The unfavorable conditions are harmful to the plants\u2019 development, survival, and crop quality. Drought conditions are widely known to be particularly damaging to the growth of potatoes as a crop. The fundamental reason is that tomatoes have more fragile roots than other plants. When a plant is deprived of its essential amount of water, it will experience stress, which may result in the loss of leaf tissue. This mortality usually occurs in bands that radiate outward from the leaf\u2019s borders. It is probable that some individuals will confuse this with the late blight. Plants are especially prone to the detrimental effects of stress when rapidly developing or when they are subjected to other conditions that cause them to lose more water through transpiration. Under these conditions, it may be difficult to create a plan that takes advantage of the times when the ground is dry and moist. When there is a lot of humidity in the air, the rate at which water is lost through perspiration slows down. When huge plants are housed in pots that are too small for them, it might be difficult to maintain an optimum moisture level in the soil. The absence of light green, wilted border tissue around leaf symptoms, the absence of pathogen growth, and the absence of stem lesions distinguish physiological harm from late blight. In contrast, late blight can be identified by the presence of all three features. Low or high temperatures, protracted droughts or floods, excessive amounts of salt in the soil, and other abiotic conditions are some environmental variables that typically result in low yields [2]. The tomato is typically regarded as one of the most economically significant horticultural crops produced worldwide. Furthermore, it is an important crop for agricultural output in dry and semi-arid environments. Abiotic stressors, particularly those caused by a water shortage, negatively impact tomato production, which is especially true in the Mediterranean region. The processes that govern responses to water stress in this horticultural species are poorly understood, and only a few genes involved in tomato drought tolerance have been found. Even though tomatoes are incredibly significant economically, this is the case. The tomato, scientifically known as Solanum Lycopersicum, is a common vegetable that could be harmed if the conditions were unfavorable [3]. Tomatoes grown in open fields are more susceptible to non-living factor damage because they are closer to these factors than greenhouse-grown tomatoes. These factors include the impact of drought and extreme heat on crop production, the length of the growing season, and the amount of land available for crop cultivation. When plant roots are exposed to temperatures below freezing, they lose the majority of their ability to transport water throughout the plant. As a result, the water becomes more viscous, and the essential membrane found in the roots becomes less conductive [4]. As a result, plants can absorb less water, potentially leading to water stress in\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281293 November 8, 2023 2 / 15\nFunding: The authors are grateful to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this study through the Large Research Group Project, under grant number RGP 2/100/43.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nthe shoots. As a result, the tomato leaves begin to wilt, and both photosynthesis and water loss are halted [5]. There are 5936 members of the WRKY transcription factor family discovered in various plant systems (PlantTFDB 3.0). WRKY is the sweet potato DNA-binding protein SPF1, which may help control gene expression, as described for the first time [5]. The moniker \"WRKY\" refers to their WRKY domain, which begins at the N-terminus with a relatively consistent sequence of WRKYGQK and ends with a Cx4-5Cx22-23HxH or Cx7Cx23HxC zincfinger motif [4, 6]. Much research has been done on the WRKY domain, specifically how it regulates genes and communicates with other molecules within plant cells. WRKY transcription factors were previously thought to be involved in plant pathogen defense [6, 7]. However, later research has shown that they are linked to abiotic stressors [7], seed dormancy and germination [8\u201310], and seed development [10, 11]. The ability of most WRKY proteins to identify TTGACC/T W-box sequences in the promoter region allows them to be identified [6, 12, 13], but this does not suggest that they all perform the same function. Controlling the specificity of WRKY transcription factors thus necessitates more than simply identifying the necessary W box promoter components. This could be due to interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, and chromatin remodeling, making transgenic tobacco more vulnerable to cold, Lupenone (L.N.), salt, and dehydration stressors [14]. There is evidence that WRKY proteins can communicate with calmodulin, a Ca2+-binding signaling molecule. Recent proteomics research revealed that the WRKY and 14-3-3 proteins collaborate (illustrated in Fig 1A) [14].\nBesides, drought causes a significant drop in agricultural production by disrupting growth,\nnitrogen and water interactions, photosynthesis, and assimilate partitioning. Plants react differently to drought stress based on species, growth stage, and other variables. High-temperature stress causes a cascade of morphological, biochemical, and physiological changes in plants, significantly affecting plant growth and development. Heat shocks caused by increasing air temperatures are now a critical limiting factor to agricultural output worldwide. Changes in the timing and location of harvests might result from this temperature increase. Damage to proteins, disruption of protein synthesis, inactivation of critical enzymes, and membrane damage are all possible outcomes of prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Heat stress may have profound impacts on cell division. These problems harm plants because they may stunt\ndb.html); (b) A model for genes that regulate decreases water loss by upregulating cell wall and stomatal regulator genes during drought [17].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281293.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281293 November 8, 2023 3 / 15\ntheir development and promote more oxidative damage. In addition, short exposure to high temperatures during seed filling may hasten filling, leading to poor grade and a lower yield [15, 16].\nDuring the rapid development phase of drug discovery, natural compounds based on the\nlow toxicity profile of small-molecule inhibitors could be beneficial. Squalene, created via farnesol pyrophosphate tail-tail condensation, is cyclized to create terpenoids. There are numerous biological uses for terpenoids. There are innumerable triterpenoids in plants. The majority of triterpenes include 30 carbon atoms and six isoprene units. Triterpenoids and saponins are present in both single-celled and double-celled plants. Compositae, Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, Euonymus, Rubiaceae, Olive Branch, and Labiatae are among the plant families that contain free triterpenes [3]. More than 30 species have skeletons made of triterpenoid molecules. Four or five rings make up the majority of triterpenes. The majority of the pharmacological and biological activities of pentacyclic triterpenes involve lowering inflammation, safeguarding the liver, battling cancer, and altering the immune syste [18, 19]. Pentacyclic triterpenoids include -amyrin, -amyrin, oleanane, friedelin, lupane, and hopane [19]. The lupine type of triterpenoids has the most basic structure. E is a carbon ring with just five members compared to the six-membered carbon rings A, B, C, and D. The E ring\u2019s 19th position is changed to an isopropyl group for the setup. Of the three ketones, only the lupine-type triterpenoid nuclear ring possesses connected double bonds at positions 1 and 2. Having a ketone group in the third ring position, Lupenone is a polar triterpenoid of the lupane type that is rare in compounds [20]. Dichloromethane is combined with lupeol, P.C.C., and P.C.C. at room temperature to create Lupenone [9]. Doctors and researchers are interested in Lupenone because of its pharmacological properties; it\u2019s found in Euphorbia segetalis [21]. Lupenone may treat Chagas disease, viral infections, diabetes, and inflammation. However, the majority of research on lupenone\u2019s anti-viral and anti-tumor activities is conducted in a laboratory, and in-vivo investigations are still required to verify the results of the lab studies. This research has demonstrated the various ways Lupenone can aid in the drought struggle in Solanum Lycopersicum.\nMolecular Docking is the method most frequently used in structure-based ligand design\nbecause it allows one to consider the action of small molecules in particular protein targets and predict the structure of the ligand-receptor complex. The goal of this study was to search the PubChem database for Lupenone, a novel chemical that could improve drought resistance by blocking the WRKY gene\u2019s transcription factor. Researchers used virtual screening and structure-based docking approaches to determine the molecule that effectively inhibits a target. The compound of interest (the target compound) and the compound that performed the best allaround was examined for structural stability in this study. Studies using molecular dynamics simulations were used in the investigation. To make Solanum Lycopersicum a viable contender in the battle against drought resistance, the main objective of this research is to identify a novel chemical that acts as a potent enhancer of drought resistance in Solanum Lycopersicum."

Because of this, a chemical reaction is triggered in the enzyme. The \"active site\" of an enzyme is a portion of the enzyme that is shaped in a certain way that allows it to attach to a particular type of molecular substrate. AS helps chemical compounds establish enough contact sites so that they can bind strongly to the enzymes of choice. This allows AS to ensure that the microenvironments for catalysis are adequate and ideal. Therefore, to establish a solid connection between our chemical and the active side of the protein, we examined the active side of the protein using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer version 19.1.0.18287. This was done so that we could achieve our goal. This was done in order to create a strong binding affinity in the end product. The binding site in the protein complex was also discovered and utilized in creating the receptor grid by using the virtual screening application AutoDock Vina. A virtual highthroughput screening of ten distinct compounds was carried out with AutoDock Vina 4.2.6. The compounds were chosen based on their best binding energy scores with the macromolecule with PDB ID: 2AYD. The best-docked posture with the highest binding energies was selected for re-docking and additional research out of the nine possible poses for each ligand, ranked from top to lowest according to the binding energies they produced."

During the configuration process, the grid point spacing was set to its default value of 0.431 angstroms, and the exhaustiveness was set to 8. PyMol and the Discovery Studio Visualizer 2021 were used to examine the output files, which were saved in the pdbqt format. The ligand binding was tested for validity and improved upon using the co-crystallized ligand [25].\nThe specific molecular mechanism of the target protein is responsible for the binding of\nLupenone. This work aims to determine the inhibitory concentration of each candidate molecule and to find the molecule that, according to the results of the virtual screening, is the most effective at interacting with 2AYD. Using the steepest descent method (1000 steps), which was followed by the addition of the AMBER ff4 force field, the structure of 2AYD was simplified so that it could be more easily understood. This needed to be taken care of before the docking study with the essential ligands could get underway. Before beginning, the investigations into the interaction, the protonation states of the 2AYD that would be involved were tested for neutralization. This was done before beginning the investigations. With the assistance of AutoDock version 4.2.6 [27, 28], researchers could conduct experiments on molecular Docking. Polar hydrogen bonds, Kollman and Gastieger charges, and other electrostatic forces were combined to produce the receptor and ligands. After merging the nonpolar hydrogens, the receptor and ligand molecules were finally saved in the pdbqt format.

On the other hand, the root means square fluctuations (RMSF) of the different amino acids that make up the C-\u03b1 backbone of 2AYD showed the most negligible fluctuations, which indicates that the protein structure is stable. The relative means squared deviation of Lupenone-bound protein simulation trajectories across a timescale of 100 ns. Every piece of data is measured three times to ensure accuracy, and the Y-axis is shifted after each iteration. After a total of 100 ns, the final structure of 2AYD had significant deviations from the reference structure, with an average difference of 2 between it and residue positions 230\u2013250. (Depicted in Fig 3B). Fig 3C visually represents the typical number of hydrogen bonds established between Lupenone and the various proteins throughout the 100 ns simulation. The MD simulation of Lupenone and 2AYD revealed a significant number of hydrogen bonds. Throughout the simulation, a total of two hydrogen bonds were established. The increased number of hydrogen bonds between protein 2AYD and Lupenone has helped to strengthen the binding and enhance the drought resistance, which has contributed to the simulation\u2019s success in maintaining its stability. In addition, the radius of gyration, also known as Rg, was calculated. Rg is an indicator of the size and compactness of the protein when it is in a state where it is attached to the ligand. Fig 3(D) depicts the Rg plots for convenience. According to the Rg plot of the C-\u03b1 backbone, the 2AYD protein displays Rg values ranging from 27.8 to 28.0 angstroms, suggesting significant compactness with an average of 0.3 angstroms from the start to the finish of the 100 ns simulation.\nLigand interaction of Lupenone with predicted docked residues of 2AYD demonstrated the establishment of substantial hydrogen bonds. Apart from this, other non-bonded interactions,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281293.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281293 November 8, 2023 8 / 15\nsuch as hydrophobic interaction and water bridges (illustrated in Fig 4). These interactions interplayed a critical role in making a stable complex between the protein and the ligand.\nThe illustration in Fig 5A highlights ligand characteristics such as RMSD, the radius of\ngyration (rGyr), intramolecular hydrogen bond, molecular surface area (MolSA), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and polar surface area (P.S.A.).

The binding free energy of each protein-Lupenone complex, as well as the impact of other non-bonded interactions energies, were estimated (Table 2). With 2AYD, the ligand Lupenone has a binding energy of -50.268 kcal/mol. non-bonded interactions like GbindCoulomb, Gbind Covalent, Gbind Hbond, Gbind Lipo, GbindSolvGB, and GbindvdW govern Gbind.

Furthermore, the GbindHbond interaction values of Lupenone-protein complexes demonstrated stable hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues. In all of the compounds, Gbind SolvGB and Gbind Covalent exhibited unfavorable energy contributions, and so opposed binding. These conformational changes lead to better binding pocket acquisition and interaction with residues, which leads to enhanced stability and binding energy.\nThus MM-GBSA calculations resulted, from MD simulation trajectories well justified with\nthe binding energy obtained from docking results moreover, the last frame (100 ns) of MMGBSA displayed the positional change of the Lupenone as compared to 0 ns trajectory signify the better binding pose for best fitting in the binding cavity of the protein.\nThe free energy landscape of (FEL) of achieving global minima of C\u03b1 backbone atoms of proteins with respect to RMSD and radius of gyration (Rg) are displayed in Fig 7. 2AYD bound to Lupenone achieved the global minima (lowest free energy state) at 2.77 \u00c5 and Rg 32 \u00c5 (Fig 7).

            "text": "Depending on the severity and duration of the stress, abiotic factors (drought, flood, heat, and salt) significantly impact tomato production, causing yield losses of up to 70%. Drought is the most harmful abiotic stress, and tomatoes are susceptible since they lack special genes for drought stress tolerance. Just 20% of agricultural land is irrigated globally, and only 14.5% of it is adequately watered. Under these circumstances, droughts frequently occur, which severely restricts the yield predicted from genetic potential and breeding value [35]. The two main ways that drought alters the relationship between plants and water are the formation of R.O.S. and tomato plants\u2019 physiology [36, 37]. Many cultivated and wild species have the gene(s) for drought tolerance. Still, it is difficult to utilize them due to the wide genetic gap between them and the barriers inhibiting embryonic development both before and after transcription. However, computational aid was used to alter the host tomato transcriptional gene(s) for drought stress tolerance. The severity of droughts is the one abiotic element that has a significant impact on agricultural output. Since they are immobile and anchored in one location, plants are vulnerable to environmental and human effects. It is essential to understand how plants react to dry environments to create more drought-resistant cultivars. A large range of drought-responsive proteins have been identified through proteomic analysis of leaf and root tissues; each of these proteins is regulated by a particular set of genes in the plant\u2019s genome. In response to biotic and abiotic stimuli, the WRKY gene family members, one of the most diverse sets of plant transcription factors, are essential for plant growth and development. More significantly, WRKY genes regulate how plants respond to pressures brought on by humans and the environment. For the development of plants with greater resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors, it is essential to understand the complex interactions between WRKY proteins and other cellular components, such as other proteins and ligands. The level to which we can accomplish this depends on our knowledge.\nThe authors of this study suggest controlling transcription factor activity in response to\nLupenone, a chemical compound, to boost plant resistance to drought and other stresses. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to examine the predicted structure\u2019s unusual behavior when immersed in water. As an added bonus, the structure can be used to gauge the level of difficulty of any ligand or molecule intended to interact with the WRKY transcription protein. Lupenone has a strong affinity for the WRKY protein, with a binding energy of -9.64 kcal/mol. Molecular Docking and modeling were utilized to determine that polyphenols are a key factor in improving drought tolerance in Solanum Lycopersicum. In order to characterize the drug\u2019s binding affinity to the drought transcription factor-associated target, knowledge of the binding energies of the ligand-target interaction is essential. At long last, we\u2019ve identified a Phyto-agent, Lupenone, that may increase drought tolerance in cultivated tomato plants."
