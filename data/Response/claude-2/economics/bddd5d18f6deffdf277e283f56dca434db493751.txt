 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Examine the effectiveness of different policy tools for green fiscal consolidation in emerging economies. For example, compare carbon taxes versus redirecting fossil fuel subsidies towards clean energy investments. 

2. Analyze the barriers to greater green bond issuance in emerging economies and evaluate solutions to increase green finance flows. This could involve surveying different stakeholder groups.

3. Investigate the design and implementation challenges of green conditionality policies. Case studies of countries that have tried tying bailouts to green objectives could provide lessons learned. 

4. Assess the feasibility and impact of debt-for-nature swaps to simultaneously address debt burdens and accelerate clean energy transitions in developing nations. Model different swap mechanisms and quantify potential climate and economic outcomes.

5. Conduct an empirical evaluation of the claim that fiscal stimulus for clean energy boosts economic growth more than general stimulus spending. This could involve econometric analysis of different nations' recovery spending and growth rates.
