    "abstractText": "Background: Filgotinib is a small molecule with preferential inhibition of Janus kinase type 1, approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in Scotland in May 2022. We present the first real-world experience on its use in clinical practice. Methods: In this retrospective, observational, cohort study we assessed patients with active ulcerative colitis who received filgotinib in NHS Lothian, Scotland. Baseline demographic, phenotype, and follow-up data were collected via review of electronic medical records. Results: We included 91 patients with median treatment duration of 39 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 23-49). Among the cohort, 67% [61/91] were biologicand small molecule-na\u00efve, and 20.9% [19/91] had failed one and 12.1% [11/91] two or more classes of advanced therapy. Of the biologicand small molecule-na\u00efve patients, 18% [11/61] were also thiopurine-na\u00efve. Clinical remission [partial Mayo score <2] was achieved in 71.9% [41/57] and 76.4% [42/55] of patients at Weeks 12 and 24 respectively. Biochemical remission [C reactive protein \u22645 mg/L] was achieved in 87.3% [62/71] at Week 12 and 88.9% [40/45] at Week 24. Faecal biomarker [calprotectin <250 \u03bcg/g] remission was achieved in 82.8% [48/58] at Week 12 and 79.5% [35/44] at Week 24. At the end of follow-up, median 42 weeks [IQR 27-50], 82.4% [75/91] of patients remained on filgotinib. Severe adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 2.2% [2/91] and there were 8.8% [8/91] moderate adverse events that required temporary discontinuation. Conclusion: These are the first reported data on the real-world efficacy and safety of filgotinib in ulcerative colitis. Our findings demonstrate that filgotinib is an effective and low-risk treatment option for these patients.",

            "text": "Filgotinib, a small molecule with preferential inhibition of Janus kinase [JAK] type 1, received approval for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [UC] in Scotland in May 2022.1 Its approval was based on the positive outcomes from the phase 2b/3 SELECTION trial programme, demonstrating both efficacy and safety in UC2 with rapid and sustained symptom relief demonstrated in post hoc analysis.3\nJAKs, a group of four intracellular tyrosine kinases, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, play a pivotal role in governing various cellular processes, including inflammatory pathways. They are responsible for promoting the functions\nof lymphocytes and cytokines and are critically involved in essential bodily functions like haematopoiesis and defence against viral infections.4\nThe rationale for developing filgotinib lies in its specific affinity to JAK1, distinguishing it from the previous available small molecule tofacitinib, which exhibits a non-specific affinity to JAK1, JAK3, and at higher doses to JAK 2 and TYK 2, earning its label as a pan-JAK inhibitor.5 The hypothesis is that a more selective inhibition of JAKs will induce fewer adverse events while maintaining its efficacy. Although there are indirect comparisons between these molecules, a direct head-to-head trial has not been done.6\nic.oup.com /ecco-jcc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad187/7464040 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nDespite the promising results from clinical trials, to date, no real-world data have been published yet concerning filgotinib\u2019s efficacy and safety in UC. However, filgotinib has been used in other immune-mediated diseases for which there are available data, such as rheumatoid arthritis.7,8\nIn the Edinburgh IBD Unit, filgotinib started to be used from July 2022, with a significant number of UC patients receiving it as a first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the real-world effectiveness and safety of filgotinib in UC, while also identifying predictive factors associated with favourable treatment response. This study aims to provide valuable insights that complement existing clinical trial data, assisting clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the use of filgotinib in UC."

One had a Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome that occurred 2 weeks after filgotinib initiation while the patient was taking also metronidazole for a dental infection. The other patient died from a biliary sepsis in the context of a disseminated malignancy that was unknown at time of commencing filgotinib."

Our cohort is particularly noteworthy as it comprises a substantial proportion of biologic/small molecule-na\u00efve patients, known to exhibit better responses to therapies compared with those previously exposed to such treatments. The data we have gathered demonstrate filgotinib\u2019s efficacy in a relatively treatment-na\u00efve UC patient population with predominantly moderately active disease, with significant\nimprovements in clinical, biochemical, and faecal biomarker parameters observed at Week 12, which were further maintained through Week 24. Notably, clinical, biochemical, and faecal calprotectin remission at Week 12 was achieved in 71.9%, 87.3%, and 82.8% of patients, respectively, with a persistence rate exceeding 85% at 6 months. These findings are particularly encouraging, as they translate into meaningful outcomes for UC patients, with a substantial number of individuals experiencing the normalizsation of symptoms, inflammatory biomarkers, or both.\nIt is important to acknowledge that randomised trials represent the optimal approach for studying therapy efficacy and safety. However, such trials are often conducted in a selective and controlled manner to ensure high internal validity, which may raise concerns about the generalisability of the findings to ethnically diverse and heterogeneous populations.11 Our real-world cohort study serves as a valuable complement to randomised trials, addressing this limitation and providing insights into filgotinib\u2019s effectiveness in a broader clinical setting.\nThe SELECTION trial, which evaluated filgotinib\u2019s efficacy in UC, employed an ambitious primary endpoint including endoscopy assessment, setting a high standard for evaluating the drug\u2019s performance as compared with previous smallmolecule trials.12\u201314 The primary endpoint was defined as clinical remission considered as Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, with rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and at least 1 point decrease in stool frequency from baseline for a subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 10.2 At Week 10, they found that 26.1% of biologic-na\u00efve and 11.5% of biologic-experienced patients on filgotinib 200 mg met the endpoint. Whereas the endoscopy assessment at Week 12 limits the direct comparison of results between our study and the SELECTION trial, it reflects the pragmatic nature of real-world data, where such evaluations might not be feasible or practical in every patient.\n0\nBaseline\n7\n88\nWeek 12 Week 24\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n54\n89\n48\n58\n62\n71\n41\n57\n35\npMayo <2\nCRP <5mg/L\nFC <250\u00b5g/g\n44\n40\n45\n42\n55\n10\n75\nFigure 1 Clinical, biochemical, and faecal calprotectin biomarker remission at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24 from filgotinib initiation.

Partial Mayo score was used although remission was considered with a partial Mayo \u22642 as compared with our study, where we defined clinical remission as partial Mayo <2. In our study, 71.9% of our patients achieved clinical remission by Week 12 as compared with 53.9% [biona\u00efve in SELECTION] and 33.2% [bio-experienced in SELECTION] at Week 10.3\nIdentifying predictive factors for therapy persistence in IBD is of paramount importance. Our study yielded low albumin levels [<36 g/L] as associated with lower drug persistence. Although the small number of drug discontinuation could be an explanation for the lack of further associations, low albumin levels are often seen in more severe cases of UC. In fact, hypo-albuminemia has served as a prognostic marker in other studies and it has been associated with increased clearance of infliximab.15 Further investigations with larger cohorts are essential to delve deeper into predictive factors and enhance our understanding of filgotinib\u2019s long-term efficacy and response.\nOne of the favourable characteristics of filgotinib as compared with tofacitinib is its specific affinity to JAK1, which was hypothesised to induce fewer side effects. In our study, 15 patients [16.5%] had any adverse event and most of them were of mild or moderate severity, as compared with the SELECTION trial where approximately 60% of the patients had any adverse events with no differences between the drug and placebo.2 These differences could respond to the length of follow-up and to the retrospective nature of our study that may have influenced the reporting of mild side effects. Notably, no differences in total cholesterol levels were observed in our cohort, whereas a small increase in lipids levels\nwas reported in the SELECTION trial after induction. One possible explanation for this is that 15.4% [14/91] of our cohort had cholesterol levels \u22655.9 mmol//L prior starting filgotinib, and were started on statins at that stage with consequent decrease of cholesterol levels by Week 12.\nFilgotinib use in the UK has garnered acceptance among clinicians owing to its competitive pricing, which is closer to that of anti-TNF biosimilars than other new agents. This positive reception is further facilitated by its convenience as an oral medication that can be prescribed during clinic appointments and initiated on the same day, with fewer side effects than repetitive courses of steroids and faster onset of action as compared with thiopurines, with no need to attend infusion units reducing health care resources. Our cohort showcases data wherein the majority of patients exhibit moderately active disease in the context of a steroid-dependent or steroidrefractory setting. Previously, commencement of a thiopurine would be considered in this scenario. However, it is plausible that JAK inhibitors may change this drug positioning from this point onwards, given the efficacy and decreased need to monitor and titrate filgotinib as compared with thiopurines.\nOur study has several strengths, including a diverse patient population and contributions to the current knowledge of JAK1 inhibition in UC. Nonetheless, there are some limitations to our study. First, this is a retrospective study and this could have impacted on the number of side effects recorded and data collection. There were also incomplete data for effectiveness outcomes. Finally, the follow-up was short although over 50% of the cohort was exposed to the drug for at least for 6 months. This time period still remains too early to draw firm conclusions about the medium to\n0,0\n0 100 200 300\nCensored\n400\n0,2\n0,4\n0,6\nPr ob\nab ili\nty o\nf su\nrv iv\nal\nFollow\u2212up (days)\n0,8\n1,0\nFigure 2 Kaplan\u2013Meier curve for filgotinib persistence.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ecco-jcc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad187/7464040 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nlong-term efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with filgotinib in UC.\nOur study highlights the importance of real-world data in complementing findings from randomised trials. Future studies are needed, focusing on longer follow-up and trying to find potential predictive factors of better response that would strengthen the evidence supporting filgotinib\u2019s use in UC therapy. In conclusion, this real-world cohort study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of filgotinib in patients with UC in a cohort with a majority of biologic/small molecule-na\u00efve patients and moderately active disease. The findings demonstrate that filgotinib effectively induces and maintains remission in UC patients, with favourable clinical, biochemical, and faecal biomarker responses persisting up to 6 months, with a favourable safety profile observed.\nFinancial support CWL is funded by a UKRI [UK research and Innovation] Future Leaders Fellowship \u2018Predicting outcomes in IBD\u2019 [MR/S034919/1].
