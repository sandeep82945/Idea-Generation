    "abstractText": "Salix koreensis Anderss (SKA) has been used traditionally to treat inflammation, pain, and edema. SKA has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, but no study has examined its effects on skin wound healing. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of the absolute extracted from SKA flower (SKAFAb) on skin wound healing-associated responses in keratinocytes. SKAFAb was produced using a solvent extraction method and its chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The effects of SKAFAb on HaCaT cells (a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line) were investigated using a Boyden chamber and 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine incorporation, sprout outgrowth, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, and water-soluble tetrazolium salt assays. Sixteen constituents were identified in SKAFAb. SKAFAb promoted HaCaT cell proliferation, migration, and type I and IV collagen productions. SKAFAb increased sprout outgrowth and increased the phosphorylations of serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in HaCaT cells. These results indicate that SKAFAb promotes keratinocyte proliferation and migration, probably by activating Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, and induces collagen synthesis in keratinocytes. SKAFAb may be a promising material for promoting skin",

            "text": "The skin protects the body against harmful exogenous events and can rapidly and effectively restore the integrities of damaged tissues [1]. Skin wound healing immediately after injury proceeds in four successive but overlapping stages, namely, hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [2]. The regulations of these processes are associated with complex interactions between cells, chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and blood elements [3]. Wound healing can be disrupted by factors, such as infection, tissue necrosis, stress, and disease [2]. An abnormality in any one of these stages of healing can disrupt the healing process [1]. Such disruptions can cause undue stress and place financial burdens on patients and their families. Therefore, appropriate and effective pharmacotherapy, management, and treatments are required to achieve complete recovery of damaged skin.\nPlants 2022, 11, 246. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11030246 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nDuring wound healing, keratinocytes (the predominant cells in the epidermis) act as a crucial player in the re-epithelialization process [2]. Re-epithelialization is essential and triggered to restore the epidermis, which is the most important contributor to skin barrier function [4]. In damaged skin, epidermal keratinocytes exhibit re-epithelializationpromoting biological activities, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation [5,6]. The migratory and proliferative activities of keratinocytes are stimulated by various factors, such as growth factors and cytokines, during the proliferative stage of skin wound healing [7]. These factors are known to be activated by signals mediated by intricate intracellular signaling cascades, which include the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [8,9]. Collagen has also been reported to be required for healing-related responses in the skin during all healing phases [10,11]. For example, collagen plays a pivotal role in attracting cells, such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts to wounds [11], and products resulting from its cleavage have been reported to participate in the enhanced migrations and proliferation exhibited by wound healing-related cells [12]. Therefore, it would appear that suitable regulation of the biological activities in keratinocytes might provide a strategy to promote skin repair. Many therapies have been devised to promote skin repair, but their efficacies are limited [13]. On the other hand, it has been reported that natural products can enhance skin repair [14], and in particular, plants continue to be used in traditional medicine for this purpose [15,16]. Many plants or plant extracts have been reported to have broad therapeutic abilities and minimal adverse effects [15,16]. Thus, plants and their extracts have become a focus for the development of effective, safe alternative therapies for the treatment of skin wounds [17]. Many plants of the Salix genus have been used traditionally to prevent oral inflammation and dental caries and to treat various conditions, such as fever, pain, and inflammation [18]. Furthermore, they have also been reported to have antioxidant, anti-obesity, hepatoprotective, and anti-cancer activities [18]. Salix koreensis Anderss (SKA; family Salicaceae), also reported as the Korean willow is a deciduous broad-leaved tree that grows in wetlands and is well distributed in East Asia, including Korea and China [19]. SKA has been reported to have antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects [20,21]. However, the effects of SKA on skin wound healing have not been investigated. In addition, the biological activities of SKA flowers or their extracts are unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the absolute extracted from SKA flower (SKAFAb) on wound healing-linked responses in HaCaT cells (a human keratinocyte cell-line)."

To determine the proliferative and migratory activities of keratinocytes exposed to SKAFAb, we first tested whether SKAFAb (1\u2013250 \u00b5g/mL) affected HaCaT cell viability using a watersoluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay. SKAFAb significantly increased HaCaT cell viability at concentrations of 50 to 250 \u00b5g/mL, but had no effect at 1 or 10 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 2a). Next, we evaluated the effect of SKAFAb (1\u2013250 \u00b5g/mL) on proliferative activity using the\n5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. SKAFAb significant increased HaCaT cell at 10 to 200 \u00b5g/mL, and this peaked at 100 \u00b5g/mL (149.26 \u00b1 8.51% vs. untreated controls) (Figure 2b).\nThe effect of SKAFAb on migratory activity was analyzed at SKAFAb (1\u2013250 \u00b5g/mL) using the Boyden microchemotaxis chamber assay. At concentrations of 50 to 150 \u00b5g/mL, SKAFAb showed a significant increase in HaCaT cell migration (Figure 3a,b), and this was at a maximum at 100 \u00b5g/mL (165.87 \u00b1 5.16% vs. untreated controls) (Figure 3b)."

Thus, we examined the effects of SKAFAb on collagen synthesis in keratinocytes using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Figure 6, In conditioned media of HaCaT cells, SKAFAb (1\u2013150 \u00b5g/mL) increased type I and IV collagen levels in a concentrationdependent manner. Increased type I collagen level was significant at 150 \u00b5g/mL, whereas type IV collagen level was significant at SKAFAb concentrations of 50 and 150 \u00b5g/mL (from 50 to 150 \u00b5g/mL). The levels of both collagens peaked at a concentration of 150 \u00b5g/mL (127.33 \u00b1 5.72% vs. untreated controls for type I collagen, Figure 6a; and 136.54 \u00b1 3.73% for type IV collagen, Figure 6b)."

            "text": "The skin healing effects of plants and plant extracts have been extensively investigated with a view toward developing agents that promote wound healing agents because of their minimal side effects and low development costs [28,29]. In the present study, we found that SKAFAb induced the proliferation and migration of HaCaT cells and increased HaCaT cell sprout growth in a collagen sprouting assay, which can simultaneously observe migration and proliferative ability [24,25,30]. These results confirm that SKAFAb can stimulate the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. However, these observations have not been previously reported. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence that SKAFAb promotes keratinocyte migration and proliferation. It has been well established that keratinocyte migration and proliferation are essentially required for the re-epithelialization of wounded skin [8]. Re-epithelialization is an important process for restoring the new epidermis for the healing of damaged skin [2,4]. Therefore, our findings suggest that SKAFAb might positively aid skin wound healing. In the present study, GC/MS analysis of SKAFAb identified 16 components that might be responsible for the ability of SKAFAb to increase HaCaT cell migration and proliferation. Several of the compounds identified were associated with migratory or proliferative activity against various types of cells. For example, a literature search revealed that one of these components, nonanal, enhanced proliferative and migratory activities and upregulated growth factor genes, such as keratinocyte growth factor in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells [31]. Verbenone had an antiproliferative effect on ovarian carcinoma cells [32]. Moreover, Figueiredo et al. reported that 1-eiocanol and 2-nonadecanone were the main constituents of the Kielmeyera coriacea extract inhibiting migration of murine melanoma cells and suggested that they might be components responsible for the ability of Kielmeyera coriacea extract to inhibit the migration of melanoma cells [33]. These reports imply that SKAFAb may affect keratinocyte migration and/or proliferation. In the present study, we confirmed the ability of SKAFAb to promote HaCaT cell migration. However, none of the components detected has been reported to affect keratinocyte migratory or proliferative activities or other wound healing-linked responses. Therefore, we suggest that further studies be conducted to investigate the effects of these compounds on keratinocytes. Wound healing is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, and MAPKs are known to be associated with the regulations of many cellular events, including cellular proliferation and migration [3]. The MAPK family is composed of three major subfamilies, namely, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK, which have all been reported to mediate ker-\natinocyte migration and proliferation [26,34]. Activation of p38 MAPK signaling has been reported to be associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation and migration [35,36], and its inhibition was reported to inhibit keratinocyte migration and proliferation [37]. Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation also suppressed keratinocyte migration and proliferation [38,39], whereas its upregulation increased both [26,40,41]. Zhao et al. reported that JNK activation enhanced keratinocytes migration and proliferation [26], whereas others have reported JNK activation had no effect [35,42]. These reports imply that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling molecules may act as important contributors to the migratory and proliferative activity of keratinocytes, but JNK may not. In the present study, SKAFAb at 10 to 250 \u00b5g/mL enhanced the phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK and JNK and at 100 to 200 \u00b5g/mL enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HaCaT cells. Thus, our observations indicate that SKAFAb enhances the migration and proliferation of HaCaT cells by phosphorylating MAPKs. In addition, Akt activation has also been reported to mediate keratinocyte migration and proliferation [40,41,43]. We found that SKAFAb at concentrations of 50 to 250 \u00b5g/mL enhanced Akt phosphorylation in HaCaT cells, which indicates that SKAFAb may promote migration and proliferation through Akt activation. Therefore, SKAFAb might have mediated migratory and proliferative responses by activating Akt and/or MAPK signal transduction. Collagen is a major component of ECM in the dermis and is known to be synthesized and secreted by keratinocytes or fibroblasts and to function as a scaffold for keratinocytes [44]. Collagen is importantly related to skin wound healing and to have crucial functions during the proliferative and remodeling phases [10,44]. During the proliferative phase of the wound healing process, collagen facilitates keratinocyte migration across wounds [8,44], and its cleavage products can also promote migratory and proliferative responses in keratinocytes [12]. Interstitial collagen type I is the primary collagen of skin and a key player in skin healing [44\u201347], whereas basement collagen type IV is involved in membrane formation [44,48]. Woodley et al. reported that type I and type IV collagens increase keratinocyte migration [49]. Previous studies have shown many plant extracts enhance the syntheses and secretions of type I and/or IV collagens by HaCaT cells [25,30,50], which implies keratinocytes can synthesize and secrete collagen types I and IV. In the present study, SKAFAb increased collagen type I at concentrations of 150 \u00b5g/mL and 50 and IV syntheses 150 \u00b5g/mL in HaCaT cells. Therefore, our findings suggest that SKAFAb may have a positive effect on skin healing by promoting the syntheses of collagen types I and IV by keratinocytes."

These results indicate that SKAFAb might promote skin wound healing by positively stimulating keratinocyte migratory and proliferative responses, possibly through MAPK and/or Akt-mediated signaling pathways, and by facilitating collagen synthesis by keratinocytes.
