Comparative Efficacy of Different Bowel Preparation Agents: While this study focused on PEG, future research could compare the efficacy, patient tolerance, and side effects of various bowel preparation agents, including sodium picosulfate, magnesium citrate, and newer agents. This would help to identify the most effective and patient-friendly regimen for SBCE preparation.

Impact of Bowel Preparation Timing in Emergency Settings: Given the study's focus on elective SBCE, future research could explore the impact of bowel preparation timing in emergency settings, such as for patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. This could involve assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of rapid bowel preparation protocols in improving SBCE diagnostic yield in urgent cases.

Role of Diet and Medication on Bowel Preparation Quality: This study did not delve deeply into the effects of diet and medication on bowel preparation quality. Future studies could investigate how specific dietary restrictions or modifications, as well as the use of prokinetics or other medications, might improve the effectiveness of bowel preparation and enhance SBCE outcomes.

Longitudinal Studies on Bowel Preparation and Small Bowel Pathologies: Future research could focus on longitudinal studies tracking patients with specific small bowel pathologies, such as Crohn's disease or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, to observe how different bowel preparation timings affect the diagnosis, management, and long-term outcomes of these conditions.

Technological Enhancements to Improve SBCE Diagnostic Yield: Beyond bowel preparation, research could explore technological advancements in capsule endoscopy itself, such as improved image quality, the ability to control the capsule's movement, or the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance the detection of subtle lesions. This could include developing capsules that are less affected by debris or poor visibility conditions.
