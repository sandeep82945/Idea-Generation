ABSTRACT Significance The purpose of this research was to measure flavour loyalty and identify how current cigarillo users may respond to a hypothetical flavour ban in the USA. Methods Cigarillo users aged 21\u201328 (n=531) were recruited between October 2020 and April 2021 to participate in an online survey. Respondents categorised their preferred, usual and current cigarillo flavours. Individuals who preferred tobacco flavours were compared with individuals who preferred any other flavours. Strength of preferences, or flavour loyalty, was defined when an individual\u2019s preferred flavour matched what they use both usually and currently creating a spectrum of individuals with a strong tobacco preference (n=34), weak tobacco preference (n=20), weak flavour preference (n=162) and strong flavour preference (n=315). Those preferring tobacco were aggregated into any tobacco preference (n=54). Results Individuals who preferred any flavour scored higher on a scale of nicotine dependence. There was a dose\u2013response relationship in those who said they would discontinue cigarillos if flavoured options were not available: 11.4% of individuals with any tobacco flavour preference, 27.8% of those with a weak flavour preference and 38.1% of those with a strong flavour preference. A similar trend was noted among those who would switch to another product: 19.2% of those with tobacco flavour preference, 34.3% of those with a weak flavour preference and 43.2% of those with a strong flavour preference. Conclusion Individuals who display strong flavour preferences were more likely to say they would discontinue use or seek out alternative flavoured products following a ban on flavoured cigarillos.",

In the USA, among those who report current LCC use, more than half, or 60.0%, of adolescent users aged 12\u201317 years and 70.7% of current young adult users aged 18\u201324 years report\nthe availability of preferred flavours is among the reasons they use LCCs.8 Attributes that go in hand with flavour beyond taste, such as smell and descriptors on product packaging, may also contribute to the appeal of flavoured products.9 10\nIn April 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a new product standard that would ban menthol in cigarettes and non- tobacco characterising flavours including menthol in cigars including LCCs.11 Research evaluating the effectiveness of comprehensive bans of flavoured tobacco products describes a reduction in the prevalence of flavoured product use or sales of flavoured products but prevalence increases among other unflavoured tobacco products among teens and young adults.12 13 A study on the hypothetical impact of the proposed US restrictions on menthol cigarettes and characterising flavours in cigars found many adult users of these products would substitute with flavoured products still available, such as\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC \u21d2 Flavour is a common reason why young adult populations initiate and sustain cigarillo use. Studies evaluating flavour ban policies suggest that individuals may switch to alternative tobacco products yet little is known about how flavour preference may play a role in how young adult cigarillo users may respond to a hypothetical cigarillo flavour ban.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS \u21d2 This study is the first to examine flavour use as a dimension of consumer loyalty. Individuals with strong flavour preferences are more likely to concurrently use other flavoured products and, when faced with a hypothetical cigarillo flavour ban, were more likely to say that they would discontinue cigarillo use or switch to another flavoured product compared with those who prefer tobacco flavours.\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n\u21d2 This study is the first to define flavour loyalty with respect to cigarillo use and suggests that the magnitude of flavour preference is likely to impact subsequent behavioural change when faced with a flavour ban.\n(IIT P atna).

Discounting and advertising content have been much more comprehensively explored as dimensions of consumer loyalty and engagement.19 Cigarette- based research has found specific attributes, including flavour, have been shown to contribute to or lead to product switching across or within brands.20 There is limited research, however, on if this holds for other products such as cigarillos or filtered cigars.\nCigarillos, or short narrow cigars containing 3\u20134 g of tobacco and typically do not have a filter, comprise most (94.2%) of the unit sales for cigar products in the USA.21 This research, as a result, focuses specifically on cigarillo product use. The purpose of this research was to propose a measure of the strength of cigarillo flavour preferences as an indicator of flavour loyalty and identify different ways current young adult cigarillo users may respond to a cigarillo flavour ban in the USA."

Additionally, eligible participants had to reside in the USA and self- report use of two or more cigarillos in the past 7 days. Sexual and gender minority individuals who identified as women who did not identify as heterosexual and individuals who identified as transwomen were oversampled due to higher prevalence of cigarillo use within that population.24 Participants were administered an online survey regarding their tobacco use behaviours and flavour preferences and received a $15 incentive on survey completion. Valid surveys were determined based on several quality control measures such as duplicate IP addresses and those determined to be outside of the USA as well as respondents missing more than two out of three attention check questions.25\nOverall, 7086 individuals were screened for participation. Of these, 3183 (44.9%) met the eligibility criteria and were invited\nto participate; 1037 (32.6%) began the survey and 844 (81.4%) completed the survey. Overall, 586 (69.4%) individuals were determined to have a valid survey response. Individuals who had partial or incomplete responses, or answered fewer than 80% of questions, were excluded from analysis per guidelines from the American Association for Public Opinion Research26 leading to a total sample of 531 (90.6%)."

All respondents selecting any flavour besides tobacco were combined into a flavour preference group while those selecting tobacco were considered the tobacco preference group. Strength of preference, or flavour loyalty, was measured by determining if their recent and usual cigarillo use behaviours matched their preference (flavour or tobacco). To capture this, they were asked what flavours, if any, they used in the past 30 days and what flavours, if any, they usually use. A spectrum of flavour loyalty was created reflecting a preference (flavour or tobacco) and whether or not their preference was both recently and usually used (strong if both recently and usually used and weak if recently or usually used or not used recently/usually at all): strong tobacco preference (n=34), weak tobacco preference (n=20), weak flavour preference (n=162) and strong flavour preference (n=315). Due to the low sample sizes observed among those preferring tobacco, this group was aggregated in any tobacco preference (n=54) regardless of the strength of their preference."

Having any flavour preference was associated with higher nicotine dependence scores compared with those with any tobacco preference at 2.98 (95% CI 2.88 to 3.08) and 2.64 (95% CI 2.42 to 2.87), respectively.\nOverall, use of flavoured cigarillos within the past 30 days was reported among 81.7% of the study population while current use of the tobacco- flavoured options was much lower at 23.9%. Despite strength of flavour preference, 9.5% (95% CI 6.3% to 12.8%) of those with a strong flavour preference reported using an unflavoured cigarillo in the past 30 days and 46.3% (95% CI 32.6% to 60.0%) of those with a tobacco preference reported using a flavoured cigarillo in the past 30 days (online supplemental table 1). Individuals with a strong flavour preference were more likely to use other flavoured products such as e- cigarettes and hookah.\nFlavour loyalty was associated with product discontinuation with 38.1% (95% CI 32.7% to 43.6%) of those with a strong flavour preference saying they would not continue to use cigarillos versus just 11.4% (95% CI 2.6% to 20.5%) of those with any tobacco flavour preference (table 2). This group was also most likely to indicate they would switch to another product with that product most likely being a flavoured option, specifically menthol cigarettes, flavoured e- cigarettes or another flavoured tobacco product, and less likely to be an unflavoured or tobacco- flavoured option.\nPathways for how current cigarillo users may respond to a ban on cigarillo flavours are depicted in figure 1. Nearly onefifth, 19.8% (n=99), indicated they would not continue using cigarillos and would also not switch to another product (red) while 42.0% (n=210) would continue using unflavoured cigarillos and not switch to another product (orange).

Our research highlights a substantial prevalence of flavour use in general with strong flavour preferences\namong cigarillo users. While no difference was observed in ever and current polyproduct use, individuals with stronger flavour preferences were more likely to concurrently use other flavoured products, such as e- cigarettes and hookah. Research on consumer loyalty for cigarette users suggests strong consumer relationships likely facilitate product loyalty making individuals less likely to quit or switch to alternative products.32\u201334 The high prevalence of individuals in reporting they would continue to use unflavoured cigarillos (67.8%), with or without substituting other products, suggests similar loyalty may exist among cigarillo product users. However, a substantial number of individuals indicated they would switch to another flavoured product\nFigure 1 Pathways of response for young adult (21\u201328 years) cigarillo users when faced with a hypothetical ban on cigarillo flavours in the USA.\n(IIT P atna).

Behavioural intention has been demonstrated to correspond to behavioural change.35 Our research supports the prior findings that flavour bans are not likely to altogether eliminate tobacco use among young people.29 There is a substantial portion of young adult cigarillo users who will continue using unflavoured cigarillos, which is associated with higher nicotine dependence and tobacco flavour preference.\nIndividuals who preferred any flavour demonstrated higher levels of nicotine dependence compared with those with tobacco flavour preferences and were more likely to have a stronger reaction to a hypothetical flavour ban either discontinuing cigarillo use altogether or seeking out an alternative flavoured product. While a limitation of this study is that we are not able to assess the factors contributing to nicotine dependence among those with some degree of flavour loyalty, flavourants may be an addictive component reinforcing the bioavailability of nicotine in the brain.36 37 Future research could benefit from studying the addictive potential and neurological impact of other tobacco and nicotine flavourants.38\nImplications for tobacco regulatory policy Concurrent use of flavoured e- cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is high among cigarillo users as is the frequency of those who said they would switch to them if they could no longer access flavoured cigarillos. It can be reasonably expected that prevalence in use of these products will increase following the implementation of any flavour policy that excludes them, including the FDA\u2019s proposed product standards. In the\nUSA, the FDA can limit flavours in ENDS via authorisation decisions39 but it is unlikely the proposed product standards will be extended to ENDS products in the same way it has been applied to combustible tobacco products.40 Similarly, most flavour bans on a global scale cover flavours or additives used in combustible tobacco products while few include ENDS and, among those that do, policies are less comprehensive than those applied to combustible tobacco products.41 The broader implications of this are difficult to ascertain in the short term as ENDS are considered an important tool for harm reduction for current combustible tobacco users42 yet still pose a larger risk for the broader population, particularly adolescents and young adults.43 Both perspectives are critical to consider for public health policy but result in competing priorities for public health practitioners and policy makers.44\nThis research relies on an individual\u2019s own definition of what would be considered a flavour. Cigarillo users increasingly report being unsure whether they use flavoured products8 and users may disagree how and whether particular cigarillos are flavoured,45 possibly corresponding with the growing number of cigarillos available with non- characterising or concept flavours\u2014 those with names not explicitly indicating the product\u2019s flavour, such as \u2018Silver\u2019, \u2018Casino\u2019 or \u2018Wild Rush\u2019.46 Furthermore, chemical analysis of cigarillos shows variation in the level of highintensity sweeteners present within unflavoured products47 as well as the presence of similar flavour additives in concept and explicitly flavoured cigarillos.48 Individuals who said they would continue using unflavoured cigarillos may still be exposed to the same flavour additives and sweeteners. This presents a challenge in measurement for this research as well as others seeking to classify flavoured cigar products.
