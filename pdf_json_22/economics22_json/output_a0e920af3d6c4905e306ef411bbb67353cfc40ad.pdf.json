All Rights Reserved.\nKeywords Employee satisfaction Learning and development Malaysia Relations with superiors Telecommunications industry Wages and welfare.\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a decline in employee satisfaction. It would appear that ensuring the contentment of one's workforce in their place of employment is the most significant obstacle that companies must overcome. Therefore, this study examined the effects of wages and welfare, relations with superiors, and learning and development on employee satisfaction in Malaysia. The study employed a cross-sectional design, and the research instruments were adapted from several prior studies. Employees working for a telecommunications company in Malaysia completed a total of 162 questionnaires online. The research hypotheses were analysed using SPSS Version 26.0. The findings show that although relations with superiors had a significant positive effect on employee satisfaction, learning and development had an even stronger positive effect. On the other hand, wages and welfare did not display a significant effect on employee satisfaction. This study makes a unique contribution to theoretical understanding by investigating these factors in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic as intrinsic and extrinsic components impacting employee satisfaction. Additionally, this research gives corporate organisations vital insights to ensure they can maintain a competitive edge in their industry.\nContribution/Originality: The effects of COVID-19 continue to put pressure on the majority of businesses in Malaysia, and it is essential that these companies take the appropriate actions and make the most expedient decisions possible in order to overcome the challenges they face. Our study contributes to the motivation-hygiene theory by examining the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that keep Malaysian employees satisfied during the COVID19 pandemic."

            "text": "As a result of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, the world has come to a halt; businesses are finding it difficult to stay afloat and are looking for inventive ways to do so (Diab-Bahman & Al-Enzi, 2020). Most companies did not have a conventional contingency plan in place in the event of an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the outbreak of COVID-19, business production and operations have been severely harmed (Song, Wang, Li, Yang, & Li, 2020). Employee happiness in Malaysia was measured in the COVID-19 Job Report by\n192\n\u00a9 2022 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.\nCOVID-19. Meanwhile, the number of employees not happy with their job amongst those currently working increased from 18% to 40%. Past studies have used \"job happiness\" and \"job satisfaction\" interchangeably (Qaiser, Abid, Arya, & Farooqi, 2020). This means that employee satisfaction has dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic, and employee dissatisfaction has increased. Therefore, the greatest challenge that organisations are currently facing is ensuring that their employees are content at work (Ntimba, Lessing, & Swarts, 2021). Organisations thus need to know about the many factors that affect how satisfied employees are with their jobs (Enkhbaatar, Gurbazar, & Choijil, 2021).\nThere are various telecommunications service providers in Malaysia who compete with one another to attract more clients to their services by offering similar services with varying coverage levels, pricing ranges, and customer benefits (Shamsudin, Azmi, Nayan, Esa, & Kadir, 2020). To establish long-term dominance, these telecommunications companies must drive productivity through their employees' job performance and job satisfaction (Kanapathipillai & Azam, 2020). Fundamentally, a telecommunications service provider's duty is to increase customer communication through wireless and wired communications to achieve domestic and worldwide network information exchange via electronic devices (Shamsudin et al., 2020). In addition, employees' work and professional lives, as well as corporate priorities in general, have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic (Sija, 2021). Technology has played a vital role in the COVID-19 pandemic since it has allowed all tasks to continue to be executed (Sapta, Muafi, & Setini, 2021). However, technostress has risen because due to the technology-related job demands during the pandemic, and employers should provide training and tools to help employees cope with the effects of remote working (Molino et al., 2020). This training can assist employees in maintaining their mental health and developing positive work attitudes (Song et al., 2020). In addition, education and training facilities for employee growth might impact other elements that bring satisfaction (Uddin, Uddin, Paul, Khan, & Ali, 2019). Nevertheless, employees whose pay was reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic or who were concerned about losing their jobs were reported to have lower job satisfaction and a higher intention to leave (Song et al., 2020). A positive association between job satisfaction and employee performance in terms of the compensation payment system has also been reported (Rachman, 2021). Many different incentive types, including equity, salary, promotion, and rewards, give employees a sense of satisfaction (Chen, 2020). Furthermore, relations between employees and employers also play an important role in keeping employees satisfied (Uddin et al., 2019). Superiors who listen to and understand employees' thoughts and needs, interact with them, and provide timely assistance make them feel valued (Tang, Lee, Huang, Rahman, & Wu, 2021).\nThus, the purpose of this research is to address the research question, \"What are the perceived effects of wages and welfare, relations with superiors, and learning and development on employee satisfaction in Malaysia's telecommunications industry?\" Answering this question is critical since few previous studies have been conducted on employee satisfaction in the telecommunications industry, particularly in Malaysia (Kanapathipillai & Azam, 2020). The results of this study are intended to be applied in sustainable human resource management to increase companies\u2019 sustainable competitive advantage by enabling flexible managerial decisions to maximise employee satisfaction (Strenitzerov\u00e1 & Achimsk\u00fd, 2019)."

The theory is based on two elements \u2013 motivation factors and hygiene factors \u2013 both of which can affect one's job satisfaction (Rai, Thekkekara, & Kanhare, 2021). Herzberg based this theory on the findings of job satisfaction studies and the observation that some aspects of employment lead to job happiness, while others lead to job dissatisfaction (Nazari, Sayadi, Pourkiani, & Kamali, 2020). Equal levels of authority and responsibility, appropriate recognition and professional advancement, achievement, personal growth, and enthusiasm in the job are\n193\n\u00a9 2022 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.\njob security, physical working conditions, compensation, and supervision quality are examples of \"hygiene\" factors, which, if not provided, can lead to job unhappiness (Rai et al., 2021). The factors are thus split into motivational factors (intrinsic) and hygienic factors (extrinsic) (Sobaih & Hasanein, 2020). Job satisfaction is caused by motivating or intrinsic elements, such as progress, success, and the nature of work, whereas job dissatisfaction is caused by retaining or external variables, such as salary, job security, company policies, and business management (Nazari et al., 2020). Performance, employment, progression, and growth all affect one's work effectiveness, but hygiene aspects, including remuneration, working environment, coworker relationships, and leadership role, affect job satisfaction (Ali, Mustapha, Jalila, Elias, & Nordin, 2021). Employees are motivated to do their work because of the hygienic element, and they work hard to achieve their goals because of the motivational factor. Motivational factors produce favourable job attitudes or job content, which leads to improved workplace performance (Sobaih & Hasanein, 2020). If the hygiene factors are met, employees will be happy at work, and if the motivational factor is met, employees will be driven to do their best (Ali et al., 2021)."

            "text": "A fair and equitable salary-performance system can help smooth employee relations and promote a harmonious working environment from the perspective of organisational change (Ma, Shao, & Li, 2019). However, employees may be enticed to quit their positions and transfer jobs frequently because of competition in compensation, working conditions, and favoured management regimes (Tung, Van Anh, & Anh, 2019). On the other hand, when appropriately compensated in accordance with their type of work and job title, employees will feel satisfaction at work (Saman, 2020). Management teams frequently attempt to improve employee job satisfaction by increasing salaries. This may be acceptable to a certain extent because such compensation allows employees to make ends meet (Londa & Permatasari, 2020). Management teams provide compensation to increase job satisfaction and employee performance, using it as a tool to motivate employees (Saman, 2020). In addition to the salary or income employees earn, complete welfare and a benefits system in addition to a decent income will help improve employee satisfaction (Tang et al., 2021). These kinds of benefits and compensation plans were created to encourage, appeal to, reward, and retain employees (Ali & Anwar, 2021). Following the completion of specified work, organisations provide rewards in the form of money and non-financial incentives as a token of appreciation (Ng & Salamzadeh, 2020). Normally, the compensation employees receive in exchange for the services they provide helps improve employee job satisfaction (Sija, 2021). When compensating employees with pay, three primary factors must be considered: it must be equal to the work the employee has provided, competitive in relation to market prices in the business sector, and the amount must encourage the employee to work as effectively as feasible (Ali & Anwar, 2021). A wellmanaged wage system can improve employee motivation, productivity, and satisfaction. Therefore, companies can use wages as a motivator and a determinant in enhancing employee motivation and confidence at work. Meanwhile, compensation can increase employee job satisfaction (Purwanto & Perkasa, 2021). Greater welfare facilities also contribute to increased job satisfaction among employees (Beloor, Swamy, Nanjundeswaraswamy, Swamy, & Nagesh, 2020). Employee compensation and benefits must be based on the type and quality of work completed so that employees believe they are being fairly compensated for their role and contribution (Ingsih, Prayitno, Waluyo, & Suhana, 2020).

The supervisor is the person with the most influence over an employee's pay, career advancement, and other administrative matters and is, therefore, the most significant and influential person at work (Alam & Singh, 2019). A good supervisor should be able to set objectives, instil a positive attitude in the workplace, and raise employee understanding of the value of training (Winarto & Chalidyanto, 2020). One of a supervisor's roles is to detect any concerns with their employees' performance and to guide and motivate them to enhance their performance (Alam & Singh, 2019). Supervisors must pay attention to supervision methods, interpersonal relations, and job security because these factors are all linked to employee job satisfaction (Londa & Permatasari, 2020). An employee\u2019s confidence in a supervisor's qualities and traits to perform well as a leader will increase if the supervisor has a good understanding of the concept of development and the fact that support from the organisation, supervisor, and partners has an impact on the employee's performance. If the supervisor frequently supervises the staff\u2019s work, the employees will feel guided and cared for. Supervisory interactions and supervisors\u2019 willingness to listen to and understand employees' ideas and needs, communicate with them, and assist them in a timely manner make subordinates feel appreciated and understood (Tang et al., 2021). Supervisors must provide employees with encouragement, support, and effective work advice (Sija, 2021). The quality of supervision is important because individuals in the organisation must see their supervisor as competent at developing people, leading by example, and providing complete support in their work. For this reason, aside from the employee's work circumstances and wages and benefits received, the relationship with the supervisor influences employee satisfaction (Ingsih et al., 2020).

Employees are more likely to believe they are appropriately compensated for their efforts if the organisation provides them with growth opportunities (Ma et al., 2019). Employees gain confidence in their ability to execute tasks, leading to the feeling that they are highly qualified for their jobs and have prospects for advancement. At the corporate level, everyone agrees that well-organised and thorough staff training is essential for boosting employee satisfaction (Kanapathipillai & Azam, 2020). Therefore, organisations should provide any required training, coaching, and mentorship to help employees improve their knowledge and abilities, thereby demonstrating that they care about their employees' success (Manivannan & Bhuvaneswari, 2020). For corporate leaders of telecommunication companies, training is the most important method of improving job satisfaction (Kanapathipillai & Azam, 2020). This is because training is often regarded as one of the most universal strategies for increasing an organisation's productivity and performance levels (Siddiqui & Sahar, 2019). Companies that ignore training programmes as a strategy for improving employee satisfaction will not be able to achieve an optimal level of employee job satisfaction and will thus be susceptible to high dissatisfaction, low morale, and ultimately high turnover (Kanapathipillai & Azam, 2020). This is because employee satisfaction is influenced by the availability of ample learning materials and the planning of employees' personal development (Tang et al., 2021).

The findings revealed that both learning and development and relations with superiors are significant in predicting satisfaction among employees in the telecommunications industry.\nSpecifically, the results of this study indicated that learning and development is the most important factor in determining employee satisfaction in the Malaysian telecommunications industry, which provides support for Hypothesis 3. The results of our study are consistent with those obtained by Enkhbaatar et al. (2021), Kanapathipillai and Azam (2020), and Uddin et al. (2019). When employees are provided with the right learning and development, their weaknesses can be turned into strengths that can help employees excel in their jobs. Employee training increases employees\u2019 job skills and knowledge while increasing their confidence in their abilities. Employees benefit from training in terms of both job security and job satisfaction. In addition, employees who participate in employee training and development are more likely to have a positive attitude toward their employers. Employees should be assigned tasks that allow them to learn and grow quickly in their job. This provides employees the opportunity to learn from their job. Companies should also provide employees with opportunities for career enhancement so that they can grow within the company. Aside from that, companies should create policies that prioritize necessary training and development for all employees \u2013 they should all be given the opportunity for training. Employees' career and skill development should be companies\u2019 priority. Company policies should align with this priority to ensure that employee career and skill development are given importance. Employee turnover is reduced by both general and firm-specific training. This is because generic skills can assist employees in increasing their sense of connection with the firm, allowing them to leverage training opportunities\n198\n\u00a9 2022 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.\nworkforce boosts innovation. Employer-provided on-the-job training can help employees be more innovative (Na, 2021). Employers should be motivated to maintain training programmes because they can improve employee performance. Employees that participate in training activities, such as seminars, workshops, and technical training, will become better employees (Alhempi & Supeno, 2021).\nThe study\u2019s second hypothesis was that relations with superiors positively affect employee satisfaction. The findings supported this hypothesis and therefore aligned with those of Ingsih et al. (2020), Ma et al. (2019), and Sija (2021). When workplace relations are healthy and harmonious, the working environment will be encouraging. This includes relations with superiors as well. A healthy and happy working environment will cause employees to work happily, making them more committed to their job and improving their productivity. Since employees spend considerable time in the workplace each day, it is essential to have good relationships in the workplace, including with superiors. In addition, a superior is the person employees will seek advice from concerning their work. If the working relationship with their superiors is good, employees will not hesitate to seek advice from them. When problems at work are solved immediately, employees are more satisfied with their work. Hence, good relations with the supervisor are beneficial to employees. Companies can make it part of a superior\u2019s job to set appropriate goals for their subordinates, always be available to their employees to listen to their opinions, and always encourage their employees, especially when they have problems. Superiors can provide proper guidance to employees in setting appropriate goals for their career growth. Superiors must always be open and welcome opinions from their employees. There is a chance that these employees may bring new ideas to the company. Superiors can play the role of a motivator by encouraging employees when they have problems. Encouragement from superiors will help employees to face and handle their challenges. In addition, companies should strongly encourage all their employees to communicate with each other without fear, so that it is easy and comfortable for employees to get along with their superiors. Employees who have a strong and healthy relationship with their employers, one that is based on mutual respect, are more likely to be happy, loyal, and productive in the long run, which will benefit the entire organisation (Staniec, 2021). Furthermore, since work settings must be supportive, encouraging, hopeful, and stimulating to ensure the highest degree of job satisfaction, leaders, using different types of conduct, have the power and ability to affect an increase or reduction in job satisfaction (Bakoti\u0107 & Bulog, 2021). Finally, businesses should maximise employee engagement through internal communication, and all employees should have the ability to be engaged (Ver\u010di\u010d, 2021). Hence, internal communication can improve employee engagement.\nThe last finding of this study, which related to H1, was the insignificant effect of wages and welfare on employee satisfaction in the Malaysian telecommunication industry, which contradicted the findings of Ali and Anwar (2021), Londa and Permatasari (2020), and Tang et al. (2021), who found that wages and welfare influenced employee satisfaction. It also contradicted the Herzberg motivation-hygiene theory. Workload and stress may play a role in employees feeling they receive insufficient pay. Employees who work more than a reasonable number of hours may not feel that their pay is adequate or fair. Thus, wage dissatisfaction may be linked to workloads and jobrelated stress (Young, Moulton, Julian, Smith, & Butler, 2021). Consequently, this factor should be investigated further."
