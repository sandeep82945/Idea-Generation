    "abstractText": "The body muscle is an important tissue used in organisms for proper viability and locomotion. Although this tissue is generally well studied and characterized, and many pathways have been elucidated throughout the years, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of its transcriptome and how it controls muscle development and function. Here, we have updated a nuclear FACS sorting-based methodology to isolate and sequence a high-quality muscle transcriptome from Caenorhabditis elegans mixed-stage animals. We have identified 2848 muscle-specific proteincoding genes, including 78 transcription factors and 206 protein-coding genes containing an RNA binding domain. We studied their interaction network, performed a detailed promoter analysis, and identified novel muscle-specific cis-acting elements. We have also identified 16 high-quality muscle-specific miRNAs, studied their function in vivo using fluorochrome-based analyses, and developed a high-quality C. elegans miRNA interactome incorporating other muscle-specific datasets produced by our lab and others. Our study expands our understanding of how muscle tissue functions in C. elegans and in turn provides results that can in the future be applied to humans to study muscular-related diseases.",

            "text": "The body muscle is an important tissue used in organisms for proper viability and locomotion. Muscle tissue\u2019s structure, shape, and size change depending on its function and location. In humans, there are three main types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles, each responsible for a different form of contraction. Smooth and cardiac tissue contract involuntarily and are mainly located on the surface of organs. In contrast, skeletal muscles contract voluntarily.\nThe contractile unit of the muscle is the sarcomere. It is composed of at least thirty different proteins, of which the most abundant are myosin and actin, and is ultimately responsible for the contraction reaction leading to movement.\nThe model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is ideal for studying muscle development and morphogenesis due to its well-characterized transcriptome, fully mapped cell lineage, and the availability of several methods for genetic engineering.\nThe basic contractile unit of the muscle is the sarcomere, which is strongly conserved in its structure and\n*Correspondence: Marco Mangone mangone@asu.edu 1 Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA 2 Virginia G.

C. elegans sarcomeres are composed of myosin-containing thick filaments and actin-containing thin filaments, which are responsible for the contraction reaction leading to movement through the myosin heads pulling on the actin filaments [1]. A notable difference between the worm and vertebrates is the absence of the costamere and Z-disc, which in vertebrates anchors the actin filaments to the extracellular matrix. However, worms contain a structure called the dense body, which performs the same function [2]. In addition, over 200 proteins have been identified in C. elegans to be essential for the assembly, maintenance, and function of the sarcomere, many of which have human orthologs [3]. C. elegans is also a popular choice for studying disorders affecting humans, including muscular dystrophy [4\u20136], since many human disease genes, when introduced in worms phenocopy the symptoms [7\u201310].\nC. elegans possess two large muscles: the pharynx and the body muscle. The pharynx is localized to the front of the animal and is responsible for food intake and the physical crushing [11]. It is composed of eight layers of non-striated muscles, surrounded by epithelial and neural tissue. The body muscle tissue comprises 95 striated muscle cells localized throughout the animal\u2019s body and is functionally equivalent to the vertebrate skeletal muscles [1]. The contractile unit of the muscle is the sarcomere. It is composed of at least 30 different proteins, of which the most abundant are myosin and actin, and is ultimately responsible for the contraction reaction leading to movement. The sarcomere is highly conserved between nematodes and vertebrates and is composed of repeated units of a complex mesh of thin (I-band) and thick (A-band) filaments. The thin filaments are mainly composed of actin and anchor each sarcomere to the dense bodies and stabilize the entire structure. Conversely, the thick filaments are mostly made of myosin and are attached to the M-line and mediate tension generated during muscle contraction.\nTo properly develop and maintain functional body muscle tissue, gene expression must be strictly regulated. Our group and others in the past finely characterized the transcriptome of the C. elegans body muscle in the adult stage [12, 13] and during the embryonic development [14] and identified important regulatory mechanisms used by muscle cells to maintain their homeostasis.\nIn addition to the identification of important genes in this tissue, our group and others recently identified that tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation (APA), a poorly characterized mechanism that produces genes with different 3\u2032untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) isoforms, is an important regulatory mechanism used by cells to evade the negative regulation effected by microRNAs\n(miRNAs) [12, 13]. Still, the complexity and depth of this form of regulation are currently unknown. Regulation of gene expression also depends on miRNAs, which are short ncRNAs that target regulatory elements in 3\u2032UTRs and repress gene expression in the cytoplasm [15, 16].\nSince their discovery, several groups, including our lab, have shown that miRNAs influence gene regulation considerably [17]. The canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway begins with the transcription of pri-miRNAs in the nucleus, which fold into a hairpin structure [17]. The microprocessor complex cleaves the pri-miRNAs into a shorter stem-loop structure, the pre-miRNAs, which are then exported to the cytoplasm [17]. Once in the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNAs are cleaved into mature miRNAs, which associate with an Argonaute protein as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [17\u201319]. When loaded into the RISC, miRNAs bind to complementary target sequences within the 3\u2032UTRs of genes to be repressed [17]. This implies that the 3\u2032UTRs and their isoforms are integral for miRNA-based regulation.\nSeveral strategies have been developed to sequence tissue-specific transcriptomes and miRNAs in C. elegans. These methodologies utilize either fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) [14, 20, 21], immunoprecipitation [12, 13, 22], or RNA modification techniques [23]. Each of these approaches has unique advantages but also presents several caveats. Methodologies utilizing FACS allow for high purity and stringency when isolating RNA from cells or nuclei. These approaches rely on tissue-specific promoters to drive fluorochromes expression in cells or nuclei. After isolation, the fluorescent cells or nuclei may be readily sorted using FACS, then either sequenced [20, 21] or processed using microarrays [14].\nImmunoprecipitation and antibody-based approaches have also been widely used to isolate the transcriptomes of specific tissues. This approach provides considerably high yields of RNA compared to FACS-based methods and is generally much more cost-efficient.\nBrosnan et\u00a0 al. (2021) used an epitope labeled Argonaute protein expressed in specific C. elegans tissues to immunoprecipitate tissue-specific miRNA populations from the body muscle, intestine, and neurons [22].\nAlberti et\u00a0 al. (2018) developed a methodology named \u201cmicroRNAome by methylation-dependent sequencing (Mime-seq)\u201d to identify tissue-specific miRNA populations from complex animals at the level of single-cell specificity [23]. The Mime-seq approach expresses a transgenic methyltransferase (Ath-HEN1) from Arabidopsis thaliana in an animal system, allowing the labeling of small RNAs. Mime-seq has been utilized in C. elegans and Drosophila and improved tissue-specific miRNA identification compared to previous immunoprecipitation-based methods [23].\nOur group also used an immunoprecipitation-based approach to identify transcripts targeted by miRNAs within the C. elegans intestine, and body muscle [24] and observed transcripts were targeted differentially between the two tissues. While identifying the miRNA targets provided valuable information regarding tissue-specific gene regulation, a major limitation of this study was that we could not identify the specific miRNAs involved.\nHere, we describe a novel nuclear FACS sorting-based approach named \u201cNuc-Seq,\u201d to allow the isolation and sequencing of high-quality muscle transcriptomes and miRNA populations from C. elegans mixed-stage animals. Using this method, we have identified 2848 musclespecific protein-coding genes, studied their interaction network, performed a detailed promoter analysis, and identified novel muscle-specific cis-acting elements. Using fluorochrome-based analyses in\u00a0 vivo, we developed a high-quality muscle miRNA interactome, which incorporates other muscle-specific datasets produced by our lab and others."

            "text": "We wanted to improve the annotation of the body muscle transcriptome by developing a nuclear FACS-based strategy to isolate and sequence transcriptomes from C. elegans body muscle nuclei. We named this approach \u201cNuc-Seq.\u201d Our final goal was to identify the body muscle transcriptome and its miRNA population expressed explicitly in this tissue.\nTo test the feasibility and optimize this approach, we first performed experiments using the C. elegans strain BN452, which ubiquitously expresses the mCherry fluorochrome fused to the histone H2B ortholog gene his58 [25] (Fig.\u00a0 1). We fractionated this worm strain using mechanical stress and separated two fractions: one cytoplasmic and one enriched with mCherry fluorescent nuclei (Fig.\u00a01A, B and the \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section). Using a Western blot approach, we successfully tested these two fractions for the presence of known cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (Fig.\u00a01C). Importantly, these nuclei are stable over time with minimal degradation after several hours (Supplemental Fig. S1). We then performed the FACS sorting step and successfully isolated a large pool of mCherry-positive nuclei, with over 34% of all the events being mCherry-positive (Fig.\u00a0 1D). We named this updated approach Nuclear Sequencing (Nuc-Seq).\nWith these results in our hands, we decided to move forward and limit the expression of the mCherry::his-58 cassette in the body muscle tissue. We cloned the his-58 gene, fused it to the mCherry fluorochrome, and then\nforced its expression only in the body muscle tissue using the promoter region of the C. elegans ortholog of the myosin heavy chain gene (myo-3) (Fig.\u00a02A upper panel). As expected, the resultant transgenic worm restricts the expression of the mCherry fluorochrome in the body muscle nuclei (Fig.\u00a02A lower panel), with fewer fluorescent nuclei compared to the experiments in the BN452 strain (Fig.\u00a0 2A). We then performed the FACS sorting step (Fig.\u00a0 2B). Although the number in sorted nuclei is significantly less than those obtained with the positive control BN452, we could still isolate a large population of mCherry-positive nuclei across from each of our replicates, which we then extracted and sequenced RNA from.\nThe identification of\u00a0the\u00a0C. elegans body muscle transcriptome We performed three sequencing reactions in duplicates (technical triplicates), two from our body muscleexpressing nuclei (body muscle enriched), and one from nuclei isolated from BN452 (negative controls) (a total of six samples). We obtained approximately 55M mappable reads for each sample (including our technical replicates). For most of the samples, we could map more than 97% of the total reads (Supplemental Fig. S2A). The results obtained with our biological replicates correlate well (Supplemental Fig. S2B-D).\nWe have identified 2848 protein-coding genes in the C. elegans body muscle tissue, corresponding to ~14% of all C. elegans protein-coding genes (20,362 protein-coding genes; WS250) (Fig.\u00a03 and Supplemental Table S1). Using comparative data from Kim et\u00a0 al. [26], we identified human orthologs for 1872 worm genes (66%).\nWhile some of our top hits have not been characterized yet, as expected, we detected many known components of the sarcomere, such as many of the proteins that form the thick filaments (myosin heavy chain genes, myo-3, unc-54) and myosin light chain (mlc-1), and sarcomere organization and structural factors (unc-15, unc-45), as well as those that form the thin filaments, including several actin genes (act-1, act-3, act-4) and structural factors (unc-60, unc-73) (Fig.\u00a0 3A and Supplemental Fig. S3). We also detect orthologs of the tropomyosin gene lev-11, which in resting sarcomere blocks myosin binding to actin, and other notable genes previously known to be in the C. elegans body muscle tissue (Fig.\u00a03A and Supplemental Fig. S3).\nOur dataset identified 78 transcription factors, including mdl-1, skn-1, xbp-1, mxl-3, all previously known to be expressed in the body muscle tissue, and 207 non-ribosomal proteins containing an RNA binding domain (Supplemental Table S1). Within this group, we identified K08D12.3, an ortholog of the human\nZNF9, which is mutated in myotonic dystrophy type 2, mbl-1, a MUSCLEBLIND-type of mRNA splicing regulator required for muscle dense body organization, locomotion, and vulval morphogenesis, and etr-1, an ortholog of the human CUG-binding protein CUGBP1, which is required for embryonic muscle development and has been implicated in myotonic dystrophy (Supplemental Table S1).\nNext, we studied the interaction network of the identified C. elegans muscle genes. We used the STRING database [26] for this analysis, which contains known C. elegans predicted and functional protein-protein interactions. Using our top 2000 genes, we produced a large network containing 1995 nodes and 31,449 edges (Fig.\u00a03B). The genes are highly interconnected (Fig.\u00a03B), producing six large distinguished sub-networks involved in body muscle formation, maintenance, protein production, and energy storage (Fig.\u00a03B). A GO term analysis shows functional enrichments for actin filament binding, skeletal muscle myosin filament assembly, mitochondrial functions, and ATP biosynthesis: all processes functioning in the body muscle tissue (Fig.\u00a03B). Seventy-one percent of all genes identified in this study are protein-coding genes, followed by ncRNAs, which are also very abundant (Fig.\u00a04A; top left). The largest functional category is receptors, followed by RNA-binding proteins, cytoskeleton, and various enzymes (Fig.\u00a0 4A; top right). Based on WormBase data, 31% of the genes identified in this study show unique muscle tissue expression (Fig.\u00a04B; top left). Almost all genes are present throughout development (Fig.\u00a0 4B; top right). Most genes show cytoplasmic localization, and 36% of them are expressed in operons (Fig.\u00a04B; bottom panels).\nThe C. elegans body muscle PROMOTERome Next, we sought to study the core promoters of the genes identified in this study to pinpoint potential motifs transactivated by muscle-specific transcription factors. We have extracted 500 nucleotides upstream and 100 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site of the 2848 genes we mapped in this tissue and plotted their nucleotide distribution (Supplemental Fig. S4). We detected an enrichment of thymidine nucleotides just upstream of the transcription start site in these genes (Supplemental Fig. S4 Panel A). Repeated polythymine motifs (T-blocks) have been previously reported in C. elegans core promoters, and their presence correlates with gene expression levels [27]. We also performed a motif enrichment analysis in these core promoters and identified several novel cis-acting elements (Supplemental Fig. S4 Panel B and Supplemental Table S2). We mapped 12 members of the human Krueppel-like\ntranscription factors family (KLF), which are important regulators of gene expression in vertebrate development and are involved in muscle health and disease [28]; Myogenin (MYOG), a muscle-specific basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in muscle development, myogenesis, and repair [29]; and NHLH1, a helixloop-helix transcription factor that is involved in growth and development of a wide variety of tissues and species [30] and has been linked to muscle growth and development [31]. The complete list is shown in Supplemental Table S2.\nThe C. elegans body muscle miRNAs We then aimed to detect and study the body musclespecific miRNA population identified in our study. Using stringent parameters (see the \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section), we identified 16 miRNAs expressed in the C. elegans body muscle tissue (Fig.\u00a0 5A and Supplemental Table S3). Several of these miRNAs have also been previously described to be expressed in this tissue by other groups [32], and impairing their function either leads to defects in the muscular fiber formation or shows an uncoordinated phenotype [23, 33] (Supplemental Table S1). We validated the body muscle localization of some of these miRNAs using two independent approaches: a GFP-based approach using worm strain expressing this fluorochrome under the control of specific miRNA promoters (Fig.\u00a05B) and a modified RT-qPCR approach using muscle-specific miRNAs immunoprecipitated from a C. elegans strain expressing a GFP::ALG-1 chimera in the body muscle tissue (Supplemental Figs. S5 and S6) [24, 34].\nBoth approaches provided strong evidence that our Nuc-Seq approach identified bona fide muscle-specific miRNAs. Importantly, this RT qPCR approach also allowed us to determine which one of the two miRNA strands (5p or 3p) was loaded in Argonaute. We determined that the 5p strand was preferred for let-7, miR-34, miR-228, miR-239a, miR-239b, and miR-5551. The 3p strand was preferred for miR-1, miR-77, miR-80, miR230, and miR-250. miR-392 did not have a distinct strand preference and was detected at lower levels than other miRNAs. We also performed RT qPCR with primers\nfor miR-1, which was surprisingly below our detection threshold from our nuclear sequencing data (Supplemental Figs. S5\u00a0and S6). With this data, we constructed a body-muscle miRNA interactome. We performed MiRanda miRNA prediction using stringent parameters, querying the 16 miRNAs with the preferred 5p or 3p strand identified in this study to the body muscle-specific 3\u2032UTRome data we published in the past [12, 13] network (Fig.\u00a05A).\nWhile most body-muscle genes are targeted by a single miRNA, 11 genes are targeted by two miRNAs, two genes (gld-1, daf-16) are targeted by three miRNAs, and one gene (lin-14) is targeted by four miRNAs (Fig.\u00a05A). Our most interconnected miRNA is miR-5551, an uncharacterized C. elegans-specific miRNA predicted to target 22 muscle-expressed protein-coding genes we detected in this tissue (Fig.\u00a0 5A). A GO term analysis shows that its targets control contractile fibers, sarcomere, and myofibril formation (Supplemental Fig. S3). Let-7 and the closely related miR-241 are also present. These miRNAs temporally regulate larval development and have been previously identified in the pharyngeal and vulval muscles [32, 35]. Among the predicted target genes, we identified several genes in the DAF insulin pathway that control muscle health and aging [36, 37]."

We clustered all 2848 protein-coding genes identified in this study using previously published protein-protein interaction data. Each gene is shown as a pink dot. Within this network, we identified six smaller, highly interconnected subnetworks shown in different colors. The genes in each subnetwork were independently subjected to GO term enrichment analyses shown with colored panels above each respective subnetwork\n(See figure on next page.)\nbeen previously identified in the muscle tissue and play an important role in muscle contraction and muscle health in general. We have identified almost all genes that form the sarcomere structure and are required for muscle contraction (Supplemental Fig. S3). When clustered using previously published protein-protein interaction data [38], the C. elegans muscle transcriptome is highly interconnected (Fig.\u00a0 3B), with several notable subnetworks corresponding to mRNA processing, protein synthesis, ATP metabolism, and muscle cell\nFig. 5 The C. elegans body muscle Interactome. A The 3\u2032UTRs of the 2848 protein-coding genes identified in this study were screened for miRNA targets in their 3\u2032UTRs using 16 high-quality body-muscle miRNAs identified in this study. We identified four subnetworks. Each miRNA is shown in grayscale and varies in size, depending on its number of predicted targets. Each target is shown in a different color, depending on the number of predicted miRNA targets in its 3\u2032UTR, as from the miRanda algorithm. Red: one target, yellow: two targets, green: three or more targets. B Transgenic C. elegans strains expressing GFP fluorochrome under the control of three miRNAs identified in this study. Let-7 (VT1153), miR-230 (VL347), and miR-241 (VT1189). All three strains show strong body muscle expression in young adult worms\n(See figure on next page.)\ndevelopment (Fig.\u00a03B), all consistent with the function of this tissue.\nRecently, similar methodologies have been utilized with success in fruit flies and mice. For example, the Fly Cell Atlas published high-quality transcriptome data from 15 somatic tissues, including other tissues that cannot be directly dissected, and contain nuclei from muscle tissue obtained from whole heads or whole body [39]. Similarly, in mice, fluorescent nuclei have been purified from skeletal myofibers [40] and in syncytial skeletal muscle cells throughout development [41]. Together with ours, these studies highlight complex regulatory networks occurring in the muscle tissue.\nWe have also performed a promoter analysis, studying the promoter composition of the genes identified in this study (Supplemental Fig. S4). Our study identified the presence of polythymine motif (T-blocks), previously reported by others, directly upstream of the transcription start site, and using prediction software (Meme Suite [42]), we have also identified many potential elements of muscle-specific transcription factors used to control gene expression in this tissue.\nOur approach also allowed us to identify 16 high-quality muscle-specific miRNAs. Unfortunately, since NucSeq identifies nuclear pre-miRNAs, we can only identify the miRNAs, but not which strand (5p or 3p or both) is loaded in the Argonaute protein. To bypass this limitation, we used a modified miRNA-CLIP approach coupled with RT qPCR analysis to determine which miRNA strand, the 5p or the 3p, was loaded into the Argonaute complex. We tested 11 miRNAs we identified from nuclear sequencing and additionally tested miR-1, which was not identified from nuclear sequencing. Interestingly, we found that miR-1-3p was highly expressed from our pulldown of ALG-1 in the body muscle. In contrast, some miRNAs that had high FPKM values, such as miR5551, had noticeably lower expression levels from our RT qPCR data (Supplemental Fig. S6). One critical difference between our two methods of miRNA profiling was that the miRNAs were sequenced from the nucleus instead of the cytoplasm. A possible explanation for the differences in expression is that certain miRNAs may localize to the nucleus or not be exported and associate with Argonaute proteins as mature miRNAs. Previous studies have also described nuclear-localized miRNAs [43\u201345] and characterized their functions [46]. Future studies investigating the miRNAs found in high abundance in our nuclear sorting but not from our cytoplasmic RT qPCR could help explain these discrepancies and if these miRNAs have biological functions.\nTo strengthen our miRNA interactome results, we also ignore miRNAs described in miRbase with less than 1000 reads. Another stringent filter we used excluded\nthe miRNAs located within introns of other genes (mirtrons). The C. elegans WS250 release contains 257 miRNAs, including 118 mirtrons. We removed the mirtrons because the density of reads within their genomic regions in genes with small introns made it too difficult to map them with high confidence. This step automatically removed 46% of all C. elegans miRNAs from our analysis and may explain why several body muscle miRNAs identified by others [23] are not present in our list. In addition, we used very stringent filters during the miRNA identification step using the miRanda algorithm, which may have also reduced the number of target predictions.\nWe believe that all these stringent filters and rules, while significantly reducing the number of miRNAs and their identified target genes, increase the quality of our hits.\nWe have validated the body muscle localization of several miRNAs identified in our study (Fig.\u00a05B and Supplemental Figs. S5\u00a0and S6).\nThe body muscle miRNA interactome produced by clustering our 16 high-quality miRNAs and the miRanda predictions using 3\u2032UTRs data from our 2848 proteincoding genes identified in this study showed seven subnetworks. One large subnetwork contained 12 miRNAs (Fig.\u00a0 5). Eighty-eight genes in this large subnetwork are connected to single miRNAs, but exceptions occur with gld-1 and daf-16, each targeted by three miRNAs (let-7-5p, miR-392-5p and miR-4937-5p for gld-1, and let-7-5p, miR-241-5p, and miR-793-5p for daf-16). Interestingly, the heterochronic gene lin-14 is targeted by four miRNAs in this tissue. More experiments must be performed to validate these hits and understand how and why these genes are specifically regulated in the body-muscle tissue. It is also important to note that our approach did not allow us to identify the pharyngeal muscle transcriptome, which represents the secondlargest muscle tissue in C. elegans and could provide an important new angle to study the complete muscle tissue transcriptome and miRNAome in this organism.\nIn conclusion, we have produced an updated C. elegans body muscle transcriptome and miRNA interactome, which will allow future studies to better understand the function of this tissue in normal states and diseases."

The mapped reads were converted into a bam format and sorted using SAMtools software using standard parameters [49]. We processed ~285M reads from all our datasets combined and obtained a median mapping success of ~93%. We used the Cufflinks software [50] to estimate the expression levels of the genes obtained in each dataset as per their BAM files. We calculated the fragment per kilobase per million bases (FPKM) number in each experiment and performed the comparison using the Cuffdiff algorithm [50]. We have pooled the four experimental samples into\ntwo sets, named set1 and set2, and the two replicates using the BN452 into a new set named \u201cBN452 nuclear.\u201d We used the median FPKM value \u22655 in the set1 and set2 dataset as a threshold to define positive gene expression levels. The results are shown in Supplemental Fig. S2 and Supplemental Table S1 using scores obtained by the Cuffdiff algorithm [50] and plotted using the CummeRbund package.\nmiRNA target identification The predicted miRNA targeting network was constructed by extracting the longest 3\u2032UTR sequence for each of the 2848 protein-coding genes identified in our study from the body-muscle transcriptome dataset we identified in past studies [12, 13]. We converted the 3\u2032UTR sequences to FASTA format and parsed the file using the miRanda algorithm [51] using stringent parameters (-strict -sc -1.2). We used either the 5p or the 3p strand identified in our IP-coupled RT-qPCR approach shown in Supplemental Figs. S5\u00a0 and S6. All 16 miRNAs used were identified in this study with an FPKM value \u22651 (Supplemental Table S1). This value represents the top 5% of miRSVR scores produced by the miRanda algorithm. We also restrict the analysis to pairing scores >150 and energy score < \u22127. We only used miRNAs that have been previously detected in C. elegans with more than 1000 reads in the miRbase database (www. mirba se. org) and that are not present in introns of protein-coding genes. The miRanda algorithm produced 118 high-quality predicted targets for 16 miRNAs. The networks were then built using the Cytoscape software [52] and uploaded to the Network Analyst online software [53] to produce the images shown in Fig.\u00a05.\nmiRNA validation To validate the RNA sequencing data shown in Fig.\u00a0 3B, three specific transgenic C. elegans strains were purchased from the CGC (VT1153, VL347, and VT1189). These strains drive GFP expression under the control of let-7, miR-230, or miR-241 promoters, respectively. Each strain was imaged using identical settings for brightfield and GFP expression. These transgenic strains were imaged using a Leica DMi8 Inverted microscope. The miRNA validation in Supplemental Fig. S5\u00a0 and S6 was performed using miRNA immunoprecipitated from a C. elegans strain expressing ALG-1 fused to the GFP fluorochrome expressed specifically in the body muscle tissue [24]. The immunoprecipitation step was performed using anti-GFP antibodies (Chromotek GTMA-10) as previously described [24]. Briefly, six mixed-stage 100\u00d715mm confluent plates of transgenic C. elegans strains expressing\nthe pmyo-3::ALG-1::GFP construct were washed 3\u00d7 at 1500 rpm for 3 min. Crosslinking and RNA extraction was performed as previously described [24]. RNA was quantified; then, 465\u00a0 ng of immunoprecipitated RNA was polyuridylated (New England Biolabs, cat no. M0337S) and reverse transcribed (Invitrogen; cat: no. 8080044) using a stem-loop poly-A reverse primer for the first strand reaction as previously described [34]. Eleven miRNA-specific forward primers were designed and shown in Supplemental Table S4. Primers with low melting temperatures were not used. Polyuridynated cDNA was diluted to a 1:2 or 1:10 ratio depending on the miRNAs\u2019 abundance. We used a 1:10 cDNA dilution for let-7, miR-34, miR-77, miR-80, miR-228, and miR-1 and a 1:2 cDNA dilution for miR-230, miR-239a, miR-239b, miR-250, miR-392, and miR-5551. The relative abundance of each miRNA was calculated based on an exogenous positive control."
