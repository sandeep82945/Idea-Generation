"Theorem 36: (Formal version of Informal Theorem 2) Let C be the measure on U(2n) induced by local random quantum circuits of depth d. Then, there is a d′ = O(n) such that at any depth d ≥ d′, for any ≤ 1/225, and for any distribution D over {0, 1}n it holds PrU∼C[dTV(PU, D) ≥ ] ≥ 1 − c2−n, where c is a constant that can be bounded by c < 7 × 106 < 220."

"Corollary 38: Let , > 0 and let D be any probability distribution over {0, 1}n satisfying dTV(D, ) > + where is the uniform distribution. Let C denote the measure over brickwork random quantum circuits as in Definition 5. Then, there is a d′ = O(n) such that at any depth d ≥ d′ it holds PrU∼C[dTV(D, PU) < ] ≤ 32n2."

"Lemma 39: Let , > 0, X be some domain, be a measure over X and Q ∈ X an arbitrary distribution. Then for any D ∈ X it holds PrP∼[dTV(P, D) < ] ≤ max { frac(, Q, ), PrP∼[dTV(P, Q) ≤ 2 + ] }."
