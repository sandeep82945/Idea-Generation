Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) plays important immunoregulatory roles in the inflammatory diseases, but its possible function in ALF remains to be characterized. In this study, we detected the phosphorylation level of Btk in ALF mouse liver and analyzed the protective effects of Btk inhibitor on survival rate and liver damage in ALF mouse models. We measured the expression levels of various inflammatory cytokines in the ALF mouse liver and primary human monocytes. In addition, we examined the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse models with or without Btk inhibition. Clinically, we observed the dynamic changes of Btk expression in PBMCs of ALSS-treated patients. Our results showed that Btk was upregulated significantly in the experimental ALF mouse models and that Btk inhibition alleviated liver injury and reduced the mortality in these models. The protective effect of Btk inhibitors on ALF mice partially depended on the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. Clinical investigations revealed that the dynamic changes of Btk expression in PBMCs could predict the effect of ALSS treatment. Our work shows that Btk inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy for ALF. Moreover, Btk is a useful indicator to predict the therapeutic effect of ALSS on liver failure, which might have great value in clinical practice. The Journal of Immunology, 2022, 209: 1156 1164.\nAcute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by rapid and severeliver injury, coagulation disorders, and hepatic encephalop-athy as a consequence of massive hepatocyte death (1). As an important organ, a dysfunctional liver gradually leads to multiple organ dysfunction syndromes with high mortality. ALF is induced by various causes, such as viral infections (hepatitis B or C or others), alcohol addiction, and drug abuse (2, 3). Dysfunction in the liver immune microenvironment is recognized as the major cause of ALF (4 7). Death of hepatocytes on the one hand activates the innate immune response, which is involved in various liver-resident immunocytes; on the other hand, immune chemokines recruit massive immune cells to the liver, resulting in the imbalance between effector and regulatory immunocytes in the local immune microenvironment (8, 9). The modulation of innate immune function is therefore a potential strategy in the treatment of ALF (7). Currently, there are no practicable therapeutic approaches for ALF other than an artificial liver support system (ALSS) or liver transplant, which are limited by the lack of donor plasma or organs. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternative strategies for the treatment of ALF (10, 11). Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is an important member of Tec family, along with Tec, Itk, Rlk, and Bmx (12). It was first identified as a key regulator in almost all stages of B cell development, including\nproliferation, maturation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migration (13, 14). Patients with Btk deficiency are prone to bacterial infections (15, 16). Further studies revealed that Btk directly activates multiple signaling pathways, which induced the production of various immune components, such as ILs, IFNs, TNFs, and so forth. Therefore, Btk is also identified as an emerging player in the regulation of the innate immune response (17). However, little research has focused on the possible roles of Btk in the regulation of the liver immune microenvironment, and it is still unknown whether Btk has a role in the pathogenesis of ALF. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been demonstrated as one of the most important players in the innate immune response, which is closely related to various liver inflammatory diseases (18 22), including ALF (23 25). Previous studies have confirmed that Btk is also involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an integral functional complex that consists of NLRP3, NLRP3 adaptor, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) (26, 27). On the basis of the theory described above, we speculated that interrupting the signal transduction between Btk and the NLRP3 inflammasome might provide a new strategy in the treatment of ALF.\n*The State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; and \u2020Shanghai East Hospital, Shanghai, China 1B.Y. and S.C. contributed equally to this work. 2M.Z. and C.Z. are cosenior authors.\nORCIDs: 0000-0002-5789-1575 (S.C.); 0000-0002-2829-3429 (G.L.); 0000-0001-6502- 5442 (C.Z.); 0000-0001-6159-9879 (M.Z.).\nReceived for publicationNovember 23, 2020.

We analyzed the effects of Btk inhibition on inflammatory signaling pathways, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) in ALF models. Furthermore, we also observed the dynamic changes of Btk expression levels in the PBMCs of patients with ALF after ALSS treatment, revealing the vital role of Btk in the process of ALF."

The change of p-Btk expression in liver immunocytes (CD3\u2212) was on a rollercoaster ride during the observation time, showing a rapid increase and then decrease in a short period of time (Supplemental Fig. 1). To observe which cell type was changed most obviously in a lethally dosed LPS/D-GalN-induced ALF model, subgroup analysis in CD3\u2212 immunocytes was conducted (Fig. 1A). Our data showed that the proportions of total CD3\u2212 cells and their subgroup cells, including B cells, myeloid cells, and NK cells, were changed in a dynamic manner, suggesting that the liver immune microenvironment had undergone tremendous changes in a short period of time. In particular, a large number of myeloid cells were recruited into the liver significantly as the stimulation time progressed (Fig. 1B). We also found that the p-Btk expression of total CD3\u2212 cells and myeloid cells were enhanced under LPS/D-GalN stimulation and that its percentage\now nloaded from http://journals.aai.org/jim m unol/article-pdf/209/6/1156/1641814/ji2001323.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\nreached a significant difference at \u223c30 min (Fig. 1C). Similar experiments were also conducted in the Con A induced ALF mouse model (Supplemental Fig. 2). Our data showed that in experimental ALF, the phosphorylation level of Btk was increased at an early stage, and we speculated that inhibition of Btk phosphorylation might prevent the development of ALF.\nThe inhibition of Btk phosphorylation alleviated liver injury and reduced mortality of ALF mice\nTo determine the protective effect, we observed the effect of Btk inhibitors on the survival rate of mice with experimental ALF. Our data showed that acalabrutinib (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the mortality rate in mice treated with a lethal dose of Con A (30 mg/kg) when compared with the untreated group (p < 0.001). Also, the survival time in the medium-dose group (1 mg/kg) was significantly prolonged compared with untreated groups (p < 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in survival rate between 0.1 mg/kg and untreated groups (p > 0.05), the smalldose group also showed an improved survival rate. Meanwhile, we observed a dose response relationship in median survival time\nbetween the four groups; that is, median survival time increased as the dose of acalabrutinib increased (Con A group, 10.25 h; 0.1 mg/kg group, 12 h; 1 mg/kg group, 16.5 h; 10 mg/kg group, 20 h). Those results suggested that a Btk inhibitor can prolong the survival time in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In addition, the effect of acalabrutinib on LPS/D-GalN induced ALF mice was similar to that on Con A induced ALF (Fig. 2B). Thus, the above results suggested that Btk inhibitor can prolong the survival time and reduce the mortality of experimental ALF mice. Subsequently, we analyzed the liver function and pathogenic changes in those acalabrutinib-pretreated mice with ALF. Btk inhibitor protected mice from LPS/D-GalN induced ALF, showing that the serum levels of both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in ALF mice were downregulated in the acalabrutinib-pretreated group (Fig. 2C, 2D). Moreover, H&E staining also showed that acalabrutinib significantly alleviated liver injury (Fig. 2E). The results in LPS/D-GalN induced ALF were repeatable in Con A induced ALF (Supplemental Fig. 3). Thus, treatment with Btk inhibitor can significantly alleviate liver injury to decrease the mortality of ALF.\nFIGURE 1. Btk activation was enhanced in an LPS/D-GalN induced experimental ALF model. C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10 mg/kg LPS and 800 mg/kg D-GalN for 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min, and the liver immune cells were obtained via mechanical separation.

The results showed that acalabrutinib significantly decreased the protein levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10 in the culture\nsupernatant of human primary CD141 monocytes stimulated by LPS compared with the untreated group (Fig. 3A). Our quantitative PCR assay also showed that the mRNA levels of\ncytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10 in the liver tissue were significantly increased at 6 h after LPS/D-GalN treatment compared with the normal control group. Acalabrutinib significantly decreased\nthe mRNA levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 (Fig. 3B), which indicated that the Btk inhibitor downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improved the immune microenvironment of the ALF model induced by LPS/D-GalN. These results were similar in the Con A induced ALF model (Fig. 3C). The above results indicated that inhibition of Btk phosphorylation can reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines in liver tissue to maintain the immune balance in the liver microenvironment.\nBtk inhibitor reduced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse ALF\nOur previous work confirmed that the NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in the development of ALF (25), and it was clarified that Btk regulated the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (26, 27). Hence, we supposed that a Btk/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway participated in the ALF process. To verify this hypothesis, the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver of the ALF mouse model was detected at protein and mRNA levels separately. As shown in Fig. 4A and 4B, the expression of NLRP3 was upregulated significantly at 6 h after LPS/D-GalN injection, and acalabrutinib pretreatment partially inhibited its expression. The mRNA\nlevels of NLRP3 in acalabrutinib pretreatment group were also decreased obviously compared with those in the LPS/D-GalN group (Fig. 4C). However, the expression level of Btk did not show the expected significant difference (Fig. 4D). Because dual-signal stimulation was required for the full activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, priming signal LPS and activation signal ATP were applied for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro (28). Our study on mouse PDMs showed that the mRNA expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1b, except ASC) was upregulated by LPS combined with ATP, and this upregulation could be inhibited by acalabrutinib treatment (Fig. 4E). We also analyzed the protein expression of the main NLRP3 inflammasome components in mouse PDMs. In the presence of both LPS and ATP, the expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, pro IL-1b, and cleaved IL-1b was increased at the protein level, and acalabrutinib significantly inhibited their expression but had no effect on pro caspase-1 and ASC (Fig. 4F). Then, we investigated whether Btk inhibition hampered ASC oligomerization during NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a critical step for subsequent caspase-1 activation (29). Our immunofluorescence staining on ASC specks showed that both LPS and ATP were required to induce inflammasome assembly, and the Btk inhibitor hampered ASC oligomerization significantly to\nFIGURE 3.

(A) Btk inhibitor acalabrutinib (Ac-Ib) decreased the secretion of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10 in human primary CD141 monocytes (hMos) stimulated by LPS. The concentrations of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10 in culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. After being pretreated with 10 nM Ac-Ib for 30 min, the hMos were stimulated by 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. (B) Ac-Ib reduced the mRNA expression levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in liver tissues from the LPS/D-GalN induced mouse ALF model. C57BL/6 mice were treated with a nonlethal dose of LPS (10 mg/kg)/D-GalN (400 mg/kg) for 6 h, and Ac-Ib dosed with 10 mg/kg was administered 30 min before LPS/D-GalN injection. The total mRNA in the mouse liver was extracted by TRIzol, and relative gene expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and normalized to GAPDH (n 5 3).

The above results suggested that the Btk inhibitor protected mice from ALF partially via decreasing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. 5).\nBtk expression was downregulated in patients with ALF with effective ALSS treatment\nALSS treatment can quickly remove the harmful factors in plasma, correct the immune imbalance within a very short period, and facilitate the recovery of liver function in patients with ALF. Thirty-one patients with ALF with ALSS treatment were collected and tested for p-Btk/Btk protein levels via Western blotting. Among them, 1\npatient received ALSS treatment five times, 2 received ALSS treatment four times, 6 received ALSS treatment three times, 7 received ALSS treatment two times, and the remaining 15 received ALSS treatment one time. Western blotting showed that ALSS treatment could reduce the expression levels of p-Btk/Btk in 21 patients (Fig. 6A). However, there were 10 patients in whom a decrease in the expression of p-Btk/Btk could not be measured (Fig. 6B). Statistically, among the 31 patients with ALF with ALSS treatment, 18 patients showed clinical improvement after ALSS treatment; among them, 16 patients (16 of 18; 88.9%) showed a decrease in p-Btk/Btk expression. Among the other 13 patients who showed\nFIGURE 4. Btk inhibitor reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

These results suggested that p-Btk/Btk expression level might be a predictor of the effect of ALSS treatment on ALF. Furthermore, to validate the above results, we performed the FCM\nanalysis again to check the p-Btk expression in PBMCs of another 10 patients with ALF who gained benefits from ALSS. FCM analysis revealed that the expression of p-Btk in CD3\u2212 PBMCs of these patients decreased in various degrees (Fig. 6D, 6E). Our results indicated that Btk might be a new potential biomarker for not only evaluating the curative effect of ALSS treatment on patients with ALF but also predicting disease outcomes."

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that Btk inhibition prevents liver damage from partial warm ischemia and in situ reperfusion in a mouse model via modulating neutrophil recruitment and activation (30), and they have shown that the neutrophil Btk signalosome is involved in integrin activation of liver sterile inflammation (31). In this study, we showed that the expression of Btk was upregulated in animal models of ALF and that a Btk inhibitor significantly improved the survival rate and attenuated liver damage in experimental ALF models. The protective effect of Btk inhibition was associated with the reduction of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling (Fig. 5). Moreover, we found that Btk might be a feasible biomarker to indicate whether patients with ALF could benefit from ALSS treatment. Although it is well known that immune factors play important\nand complex roles in the pathogenesis of ALF, the mechanism of ALF is not completely clear. To explore the potential role of Btk in\nthe pathogenesis of ALF, we observed the dynamic changes of Btk during the process of ALF. We confirmed that the expression level of p-Btk changed quickly in a dynamic process under the stress of acute liver injury, and our data were consistent with those from Weber\u2019s group (27). Some researchers have pointed out that Btk protein has its own internal mechanism in its autoinhibition and activation (32), which might partially explain this dynamic change of Btk in the inflammatory state. After analyzing the dynamic changes of Btk signaling during mouse ALF, we hypothesized that the inhibition of Btk phosphorylation might protect mice from ALF. We found that by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Btk, liver damage in mice with ALF induced by either LPS/D-GalN or Con A was alleviated significantly, and the survival rate was improved, along with a decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in liver tissues, such as IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6. To elucidate whether the data obtained from the animal model are applicable to patients with ALF, we used normal PBMCs from healthy donors and isolated CD141 monocytes. We found that the expression of those inflammatory cytokines was significantly increased in the supernatant of cultured human CD141 PBMCs treated by LPS, and the Btk inhibitor significantly reduced these cytokines. Thus, Btk inhibition effectively protected liver injury from ALF in vivo and weakened the LPS-mediated mononuclear macrophage immune response in vitro. Unfortunately, we have not observed a meaningful reduction in liver damage or in mortality using an LPS/D-GalN or Con A \u2014induced ALF model in Btk-null mice, which was reported by the research using a mouse polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid induced acute hepatitis model (33), and we have also discussed this discrepancy, which might be caused by a variety of complex factors, in a published review (34). For example, Btk has many sites in every domain to bind with different molecules and regulate their\nFIGURE 5. The underlying mechanism of Btk inhibitors in the protection of ALF. Both innate and adaptive immune systems jointly participate in ALF development, and the disorder of various cytokines plays a central role in signal transduction of hepatocyte death. Btk inhibitors can restore the immune balance in the liver of ALF via reducing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and controlling the cytokine storm to alleviate the injury of ALF.\now nloaded from http://journals.aai.org/jim m unol/article-pdf/209/6/1156/1641814/ji2001323.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\nphysiological activities, which means that Btk is involved in multiple signaling transduction pathways and has complex and pleiotropic functions (35). Furthermore, other Tec family members, such as Tec and Itk, were confirmed to have an overlap with Btk in some functions, especially that Tec has similar functions of Btk in some degree (36, 37). In addition, this discrepancy is not unique to Btk; other molecules, such as receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (38), are also multifunctional regulators of cell death. Overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a central step in the development of various deleterious inflammations, such as ALF. Regulation of NLRP3 function is recognized as an effective strategy in the treatment of inflammatory diseases (39). Previous studies had clarified that Btk regulated the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (26, 27), and our team\u2019s work also revealed that the NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in the development of ALF (25). Hence, we supposed that the Btk/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway participated in ALF progress. To verify this hypothesis, the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver of an ALF mouse model was detected at protein and mRNA levels. We found that the NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly increased in these models. According to our previous work, miR-17 from the mesenchymal stem cell derived exosome could alleviate LPS/D-GalN induced mouse ALF via reducing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome\n(25). Another study also demonstrated that Btk was essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation via linking NLRP3 with ASC to eventually form bioactive IL-1b and IL-18 (26). In this study, Btk inhibitors interrupted the signaling transduction of the NLRP3 inflammasome at both RNA and protein levels in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the protective effect of the Btk inhibitor on ALF was related to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Systemic inflammatory responses are closely related to the development of ALF (40). Therefore, it is an important and feasible strategy to substitute fresh healthy plasma for ALF patient plasma, which contains various toxic substances and inflammatory mediators, such as endotoxin, bilirubin, TNF-a, ILs, and so forth. On the basis of this theory, ALSS treatment is currently proved to be an effective therapeutic strategy that can reduce the mortality of patients with ALF in addition to liver transplant (41). ALSS treatment can relieve persistent injuries and repair the liver tissue, which provides valuable time for liver transplant or other treatments. However, not all patients with ALF benefit from ALSS treatment, and some of them even have no response to ALSS. Currently, there is still no mature and popularized systematic tool to evaluate the therapeutic effect of ALSS (42, 43). In clinical practice, the improvement of ALF patient symptoms and the recovery of liver function are mainly considered positive outcomes, and the observation of the recovery of immune function is rarely included. In our study, we analyzed the expression\nFIGURE 6. Btk expression was downregulated in patients with ALF after ALSS treatment.

We found that the phosphorylation level of Btk was decreased in patients with ALF who gained benefits from ALSS treatment, and those with no response to ALSS treatment also showed that no significant decrease in the expression of Btk. As a central immune regulator, the expression levels of Btk before and after ALSS treatment can reflect the changes in the patient\u2019s systemic inflammatory and immune responses, and we thought the change of p-Btk might have a relationship with the therapeutic effect of ALSS on the liver immune system. We found that Btk was not only a potential therapeutic target for ALF treatment but also a marker for the outcomes of patients with ALF treated with ALSS. It should be noted that the number of patients included in this study was limited, so large-scale investigations are needed in further research. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that Btk participated in ALF progress via NLRP3 inflammasome signaling and that Btk inhibition played a protective role in ALF. Moreover, Btk was an important molecule that indicated the therapeutic effect of ALSS on ALF. Therefore, Btk was a therapeutic target for the treatment of ALF, which might have great value in clinical practice."
