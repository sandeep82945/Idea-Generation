 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this review paper on ergot alkaloids:

1. Further investigate the receptor binding affinities and downstream signaling effects of the C-8-S epimers of ergot alkaloids using radioligand binding assays, cell-based functional assays, and in vivo studies. Compare to the corresponding C-8-R epimers.

2. Conduct toxicity studies with the C-8-S epimers in animal models to determine their potential to cause adverse effects like vasoconstriction, reduced milk production, etc. Compare to the C-8-R epimers. 

3. Analyze the stability and conversion kinetics of the C-8-S epimers to the R epimers and vice versa in biological matrices like blood, tissues, digestive fluids. 

4. Develop analytical methods to accurately quantify C-8-S epimers in food and feed samples. Determine proportions of epimers in samples from different geographic regions.

5. Conduct feeding trials in livestock with feed containing known amounts of C-8-S epimers to determine effects on health parameters. Compare to feeding trials with C-8-R epimers.
