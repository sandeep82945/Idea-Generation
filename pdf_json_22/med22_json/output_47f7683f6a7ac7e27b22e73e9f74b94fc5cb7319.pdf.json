    "abstractText": "Background: The protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element\u2010binding protein (CREB) has been suggested to be related to the inhibition of the proliferation of non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel diarylcyclohexanone derivative, MHY4571, in regulating the PKA\u2010CREB pathway and to study its anti\u2010tumor role in squamous NSCLC. Methods: We designed MHY4571 as a novel PKA inhibitor with acceptable in silico ADME properties and tested it in vitro in lung cancer cell lines and in vivo in xenograft and orthotopic mouse models of squamous cell lung carcinoma. Results: MHY4571 inhibited PKA activity (> 70% inhibition) and suppressed the expression of p\u2010PKA and p\u2010CREB dose\u2010dependently. MHY4571 treatment reduced lung cancer cell viability and promoted caspase 3\u2010dependent apoptotic cell death. Orally administered MHY4571 significantly suppressed lung tumor growth in xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. PKA catalytic subunit alpha\u2010silencing by siRNA (siPKA) strongly attenuated CREB phospho\u2010 rylation; siCREB did not alter PKA protein levels or its phosphorylation, suggesting that PKA is an upstream regulator of CREB activity. MHY4571 acted synergistically with cisplatin (on co\u2010treatment) to induce apoptotic cell death in lung",

MHY4571 treatment reduced lung cancer cell viability and promoted caspase 3\u2011dependent apoptotic cell death. Orally administered MHY4571 significantly suppressed lung tumor growth in xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. PKA catalytic subunit alpha\u2011silencing by siRNA (siPKA) strongly attenuated CREB phospho\u2011 rylation; siCREB did not alter PKA protein levels or its phosphorylation, suggesting that PKA is an upstream regulator of CREB activity. MHY4571 acted synergistically with cisplatin (on co\u2011treatment) to induce apoptotic cell death in lung cancer cells.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "The development of targeted therapies has redefined the treatment paradigm for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring actionable driver mutations [1]. However, a paucity of actionable driver mutations and the emergence of acquired resistance are unmet needs for researchers. Overall, 80\u201385% of all human lung cancers are NSCLCs, which comprise two major histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Targetable oncogenes have not been identified in the squamous cell carcinoma histological subtype of NSCLC; in contrast, several such oncogenes have been found in the adenocarcinoma subtype. Consequently, the five-year survival rates among patients with advanced squamous NSCLC treated with current chemotherapeutic regimens are approximately 5\u20136% [2, 3]. Advances in systemic therapies using immunotherapy have recently shown promise in the clinic [4, 5]. Although encouraging, the benefits of immunotherapy are still restricted to a small proportion of lung cancer patients, and progression occurs within a few months of administering the therapy. Therefore, target discovery and mechanism-of-action examinations have essential roles in drug development for patients with squamous NSCLC.\nPKA, also known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, is not known to be an oncogene. However, growing evidence suggests that this kinase may contribute to cancer progression [6]. For instance, PKA-mediated pathways play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis [7\u20139]. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a protein downstream of PKA, is a vital transcription factor that controls the expression of several genes, including cell cycle regulators [10].\nFunctional studies in NSCLC cell lines and genetically engineered lung cancer mouse models of CREB-regulated transcription coactivators support the tumor-promoting role of CREB-mediated transcriptional activation in NSCLC [11\u201313].\u00a0 Previous studies have reported that the PKA-CREB axis has tumor-promoting effects in lung cancer [14, 15]. Additionally, inhibiting the PKA-CREB signaling pathway prevents tumor cell proliferation in lung cancer [16].\nSeveral protein kinase inhibitors have been developed to terminate PKA signaling by dephosphorylating PKA substrates [17]. These chemical PKA inhibitors, including cAMP analogs, have been shown to inhibit PKA activity\nby binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the PKA catalytic subunit [18]. However, small-molecule inhibitors have drawbacks, such as the need for dosage at high concentrations and non-specific off-target effects. Therefore, more research on PKA inhibitors is needed to overcome these drawbacks and improve specificity.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel diarylcyclohexanone derivative, MHY4571, in regulating the PKA-CREB pathway and to study its antitumor role in squamous NSCLC.\u00a0 In addition, we also sought to evaluate the synergetic effects of MHY4571 and cisplatin on cell viability in squamous cell lung cancer cell lines."

To investigate the mechanism whereby MHY4571 inhibited PKA activity, we conducted two different computerized docking simulations. Daphnetin, a known PKA inhibitor [23], preferentially binds to the ATP-binding site in the PKA catalytic alpha subunit structure (Fig.\u00a0 1B). Docking simulation of MHY4571 to the ATP binding site revealed that MHY4571 binds to the same site as daphnetin.

Overall survival analysis (A, GSE4373, p = 0.024; B, GSE17710, p = 0.001) and relapse\u2011free survival (C, GSE17710, p < 0.001) of the patients with squamous NSCLC were performed using Cox proportional hazard models and follow\u2011up data for the indicated period. The result was as follows. The blue line indicates the group with low PRKACA expression ((a) n = 43, (b) n = 18, (c) n = 18) and the green line indicates the group with medium PRKACA expression ((a) n = 43, (b) n = 19, (c) n = 19). The red line indicates the group with low PRKACA expression ((a) n = 44, (b) n = 19, (c) n = 19).

Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm. E Total cell lysates of normal human lung epithelial BEAS\u20112B cells and four different squamous\u2011cell lung carcinoma (SQC) cell lines (NCI\u2011H1703, HCC95, SK\u2011MES\u20111, and SNU\u20111330) were subjected to western blot analysis for the expression levels of P\u2011PKA and PKA C\u03b1.

Data are the means \u00b1 SD (n = 3)\nsignificant clinical benefits according to the dataset of patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma obtained from GEO. We analyzed NSCLC human tissue microarrays by immunostaining with the P-PKA antibody and found that 6.7% of the human tumors examined showed positive staining for P-PKA (Fig.\u00a0 2D). In analyzing the expression levels of PKA catalytic subunit in human squamous lung cancer cell lines, western blot showed a consistent PKA level and revealed that the phosphorylation level of PKA (p-PKA) was higher in squamous cell lung carcinoma cells (NCI-H1703 and HCC95) than in a normal broncho-epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) (Fig.\u00a02E).\nTreatment with\u00a0MHY4571 inhibits the\u00a0proliferation of\u00a0squamous cell lung cancer cells As the PKA-mediated signaling pathway was reported to have a tumor-promoting effect [8], we hypothesized that elevated PKA activity would be associated with squamous NSCLC cell proliferation and that the regulation of PKA activity by MHY4571 would inhibit cancer growth. Accordingly, to assess the anti-proliferative activity of MHY4571, its growth-inhibitory effects were investigated in squamous lung cancer cell lines and a normal bronchial epithelial cell line using the MTT assay. The lung cancer cell lines showed varied responses to MHY4571; however, the response was minimal in BEAS-2B cells (Fig.\u00a0 3A). The NCI-H1703 cell line was chosen for further experimentation as it was sensitive to treatment, and BEAS-2B was selected as the control cell line. MHY4571 showed anti-proliferative effects in the colony formation assay (Fig.\u00a0 3B) and the Annexin V apoptosis assay (Fig.\u00a03C). MHY4571 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK (Fig.\u00a0 3D). MHY4571 treatment induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and enhanced cell death (Fig.\u00a03E).\nFig. 3 MHY4571 induces apoptosis in human lung cancer cells (A). The normal broncho\u2011epithelial cells (BEAS\u20112B) and four different human squamous lung cancer cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MHY4571 for 24 h, and then the percentage of cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. B NCI\u2011H1703 cells were treated with MHY4571 for 8 h, and the medium was replaced with a fresh medium. After incubation for 10 days, colonies were stained with crystal violet. C NCI\u2011H1703 cells were treated with variable concentrations of MHY4571 for 24 h. The cells were stained with Annexin V\u2011FITC/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. D NCI\u2011H1703 cells and HCC95 were incubated with MHY4571 as indicated for 24 h. The blots were probed with antibodies against P\u2011Akt, Akt, P\u2011ERK, and ERK. \u03b2\u2011actin was used as an internal control. E PARP and procaspase\u20113 were detected to determine the apoptotic effects of MHY4571. Data are the means \u00b1 SD (n = 3). Significance was calculated by the student\u2019s t\u2011test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 vs. vehicle\u2011treated cells)\nMHY4571 reduces cell viability by\u00a0repressing PKA\u2011CREB signaling To examine the association between PKA signaling and lung cancer cell proliferation, we used two squamous NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H1703, and HCC95. We first confirmed that treatment with MHY4571 reduced the p-CREB-to-CREB ratio in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a0 4A; Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig.\u00a0 S1). We also determined the active transcription of CREB target genes, E2F family members, E2F1, E2F2, and E2F8. We found that E2F mRNA and proteins were decreased by the treatment with MHY4571 in dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a04B & C).\nWe then evaluated whether PKA was an upstream regulator of CREB and examined the functional consequences of inactivating PKA or CREB to better understand the function of these pathways in promoting lung cancer cell proliferation. We performed western blot assay in cancer cells transfected with siPKA or siCREB (transfected cells vs. scrambled control cells (siControl)).\nWe found that siPKA-treated cells showed decreased levels of p-PKA and p-CREB, but siCREB-treated cells showed a downregulation of p-CREB alone, suggesting that PKA is an upstream modulator of CREB (Fig.\u00a0 4D & E). Next, we examined whether PKA-CREB signaling is associated with cell viability. We found that siPKAor siCREB-transfected cells showed decreased viability compared to scrambled control-treated cells (Fig.\u00a04F).\nMHY4571 significantly suppresses tumor growth To determine whether MHY4571 inhibits in\u00a0vivo tumor growth, we used NCI-H1703 xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. The tumor volumes and masses in mice administered MHY4571 (5\u00a0 mg\u00a0 kg\u22121, 10\u00a0 mg\u00a0 kg\u22121, and 20\u00a0 mg\u00a0 kg\u22121 daily) were significantly smaller than those in the vehicle control group (Fig.\u00a0 5A). Additionally, MHY4571 was well tolerated at these doses (Fig.\u00a0 5A). Immunohistochemical analysis for p-PKA and p-CREB (a well-known target of PKA) showed that control tumors\nFig. 4 MHY4571 induces apoptosis through, at least in part, the PKA/CREB axis in human squamous carcinoma lung cancer cells. A NCI\u2011H1703 cells and HCC95 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of MHY4571 for 24 h, and western blot analyses were conducted to investigate the expression of P\u2011CREB and CREB. B, C NCI\u2011H1703 cells and HCC95 cells were treated with MHY4571 at 0, 5, and 7.5 \u00b5M for 24 h, and then the mRNA expression levels of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F8 were analyzed by quantitative RT\u2011PCR and western blot analyses. \u03b2\u2011actin was used as an internal control. Significance was determined using student\u2019s t\u2011test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 vs. vehicle\u2011treated cells). D, E NCI\u2011H1703 cells and HCC95 cells were transfected with siPKA, siCREB, and scramble siRNA (negative control) for 48 h, and then the expression levels of P\u2011PKA, PKA, P\u2011CREB, and CREB proteins were analyzed by western blot. \u03b2\u2011actin was used as a loading control. Significance was determined using student\u2019s t\u2011test (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001 vs. scramble siRNA transfected cells). F NCI\u2011H1703 cells and HCC95 cells were transfected with siPKA, siCREB, and scramble siRNA (NC) for 24, 48, and 72 h, and then MTT assay was performed to confirm cell viability. Results are expressed as the means \u00b1 SD of three individual experiments. Significance was determined using student\u2019s t\u2011test test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 vs. scramble siRNA transfected cells (NC))\n(untreated vehicle controls) showed subpopulations of p-PKA- and p-CREB-positive cells; however, treatment with MHY4571 reduced p-PKA and p-CREB positivity (Fig.\u00a0 5B). The results of the TUNEL assay showed that MHY4571 treatment led to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells (Fig.\u00a05C).\nBecause the two high doses (10\u00a0 mg\u00a0 kg\u22121 and 20\u00a0mg\u00a0 kg\u22121) did not show any unacceptable side effects or toxicities in experimental xenograft mice, we further examined the effects of MHY4571 at these two doses on the growth of orthotopically implanted lung cancer tumors. The bioluminescence imaging results indicated a gradual increase in tumor volume in the control group compared with that in the two treatment groups. The final tumor volumes on day 21 after the start of treatment were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05, treatment vs. control; Fig.\u00a05D). There was a corresponding result for tumor volume treated with 10\u00a0mg\u00a0 kg\u22121 and 20\u00a0mg\u00a0 kg\u22121 MHY4571.\nEffect of\u00a0combined treatment with\u00a0cisplatin and\u00a0MHY4571 in\u00a0squamous cell lung cancer cells Next, we investigated whether combined treatment with MHY4571 and cisplatin had synergistic effects on cell death. We used compusys, a publicly available\ndatabase, to determine the synergistic effects and found that co-treatment synergistically increased apoptosis based on the results of the MTT assay (Fig.\u00a0 6A and B). Similar synergistic effects were observed in the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay (Fig.\u00a0 6C) and colony formation assay (Fig.\u00a06D). We then evaluated whether the combination of MHY4571 and cisplatin induced additional cytotoxicity in the normal epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Our results showed that the co-treatment did not significantly increase cell death in BEAS-2B cells (Fig.\u00a0 6E). Furthermore, the combination treatment induced caspase-3 and PARP-1 cleavage and inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK (Fig.\u00a06F). All the above effects showed dose-dependent trends. These findings demonstrate that MHY4571 has dose-dependent and caspase-3-dependent cytotoxic effects in lung cancer cells but not in normal epithelial cells."

Our data from in\u00a0 vitro and in\u00a0 vivo experiments revealed that MHY4571 functions as a novel PKA inhibitor in NSCLC and exerts anticancer effects\nFig. 5 MHY4571 inhibits tumor progression in a mouse xenograft and orthotic model. A After NCI\u2011H1703 cell injection, mice harboring human lung tumors were treated with vehicle (control) or MHY (5, 10, and 20 mg kg\u22121).

Statistical significance is indicated as ** P < 0.01\nmediated by the inactivation of the PKA-CREB signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that PKA could be a therapeutic target for squamous cell lung carcinoma, and the suppression of PKA activity by MHY4571 could potentially be employed to treat this cancer type.\nThe \u201cdruggable\u201d driver oncogenes in NSCLC that have been successfully targeted include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase, BRAF, RET, and ROS1. Newly developed antibody\u2013drug conjugates and small molecule inhibitors of other oncogenes, such as cMET and Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), are currently being tested in clinical trials. The incidence of these driver oncogenes is approximately 1\u201310%, except for EGFR and KRAS, which have relatively high incidences of up to 20\u201330% [25]. In this study, we used tissue microarrays to evaluate the expression of p-PKA in NSCLC cells. Our data revealed that 16 of 236 NSCLC specimens (6.7%) were p-PKA-positive; this number was comparable to that for the other driver oncogenes. Our data and previous studies [10, 24] indicate that a high level of PKA activity is associated with a poor prognosis and OS in lung cancer. This suggests that PKA activity, at least in part, is required for cell proliferation in NSCLC. Using the structure of the well-known PKA inhibitor H89 as the starting point, we designed novel PKA inhibitors. As shown in Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig.\u00a0 S2, H89 consists of two aromatic rings (A and C) connected by a linker (B). Based on the structural characteristics of H89, several diaryl derivatives with 2,6-dimethylenecyclohexanone or 2,5-dimethylenecyclopentanone moieties as linkers were designed and synthesized. Based on the preliminary screening results, (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(4-fluoro3-methoxybenzylidene) cyclohexanone (MHY4571) was selected for further experiments. We also compared the effectiveness of MHY4571 to H89 and found that MHY4571 has relatively more cytotoxic effects in PKA overexpressed H1703 cells (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig.\u00a0 S3). Results from the docking simulation analysis suggest that MHY4571 binds to the ATP pocket of the PKA catalytic subunit. We then performed protein kinase assays to investigate whether MHY4571 exerts an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity by reducing ATP concentrations. Results from protein kinase assays involving the measurement of radioactive ATP concentrations showed that MHY4571 reduced PKA activity. Western blot analysis showed that MHY4571 tends to inhibit PKA\nFig. 6 Effect of combined treatment with cisplatin and MHY4571 in NCI\u2011H1703 cells. NCI\u2011H1703 cells were incubated for 24 h treatment with 1:1 drug mixture (cisplatin/MHY4571) in increasing concentrations. Combined effects were determined using A MTT assay and B CI values. Results are mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3, expressed as a percentage of that in vehicle\u2011treated control cells. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 vs. MHY4571\u2011treated cells).

E NCI\u2011H1703 cells and BEAS\u20112B cells were incubated with or without 7.5 \u03bcg/mL cisplatin and/or 7.5 \u03bcM MHY4571 for 24 h, and combined effects were assessed using MTT assay. ###P < 0.001 for the combination of cisplatin plus MHY4571 vs. cisplatin\u2011treated cells (student\u2019s t\u2011test). F Total proteins were prepared and immunoblotted for PARP, procaspase\u20113, P\u2011Akt, Akt, P\u2011ERK, and ERK. \u03b2\u2011actin was used as a loading control\nphosphorylation (Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a0S4). However, further studies are warranted to confirm the phospho-PKA level and its particular phosphorylated site. Kinase inhibition assay results showed that MHY4571 also inhibited other kinases to a lower degree (< 70%); the exception was RET (wild-type and S891A), which showed a > 70% inhibition (Fig.\u00a01D). However, MHY4571 did not improve cell viability in the LC-2/ad cell line harboring a CCDC6RET\u00a0 fusion; this genetic alteration is the most frequent RET rearrangement observed in NSCLC [26] (Additional file\u00a0 1 Fig.\u00a0 S5). In addition to selectivity concerning kinases, it is also essential to focus on selectivity for tumor cells compared to normal cells. Our data showed that MHY4571 had minimal effect on the viability of normal cells (BEAS-2B), while it was highly effective in reducing the viability of lung cancer cell lines.\nOur data demonstrated that the downregulation of p-PKA by MHY4571 suppressed NSCLC tumorigenesis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function for PKA in NSCLC cell lines, and in\u00a0vivo tumor mass. These findings are supported by previous studies that reported that the inhibition of PKA leads to antitumor effects in lung cancer [14]. We also found that combination treatment with MHY4571 and cisplatin synergistically reduced cell viability. Further experimentation is warranted to determine the optimal dose of MHY4571 and cisplatin that is efficacious and does not show adverse effects when used as part of the combination therapy.\nInterestingly, it has been observed that activating PKA can induce tumor cell proliferation through CREB activation in lung cancer [27]. MHY4571 exerted tumorsuppressive functions through the PKA-CREB signaling pathway in\u00a0 vitro and NSCLC tumors in\u00a0 vivo. Previous studies have revealed that the activation of PKA, the mitogen-activated kinases ERK1/2, and CREB is associated with the proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cells [14]. Downregulation of the PKA-CREB pathway inhibited hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, cell migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells [28]. These results suggest that the PKA-CREB pathway plays an essential role in the proliferation of cancer cells, and this pathway can be targeted for the treatment of lung cancer. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F8 are E2F family members and are overexpressed in lung cancer cells (compared to normal human lung tracheobronchial epithelial cells). These E2Fs play a critical role as target genes of CREB in the growth of lung cancer cells [29]. This led us to hypothesize that the MHY4571mediated downregulation of the PKA-CREB pathway may be associated with cell cycle arrest via modulating molecules such as E2Fs. Consistent with a previous study, we found that the overexpression of E2Fs was abrogated by MHY4571 treatment. Future studies should focus\non elucidating the detailed mechanisms underlying the PKA-CREB-mediated regulation of E2Fs and the eventual suppression of NSCLC cell viability.\nThe limitation of this study was that we used the siRNA technique for gene-silencing of PKA catalytic subunit alpha. The siRNA method has variable effects in terms of the extent of gene knockdown and could generate offtarget effects through a different mechanism. Thus, for future detailed mechanistic studies, gene knockout techniques, such as the CRISPR/cas9 method, are warranted to knock out PKA expression."
