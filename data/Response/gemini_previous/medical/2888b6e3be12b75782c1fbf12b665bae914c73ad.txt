1. **Investigate the mechanisms of protection induced by the candidate vaccines:** 
- Conduct further studies to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of the candidate vaccines, such as the role of different antibody isotypes, cytokine profiles, and cellular immune responses.


2. **Evaluate the efficacy of the candidate vaccines in different animal models:** 
- Test the candidate vaccines in other animal models, such as non-human primates, to assess their cross-protective potential and generalizability.


3. **Explore the potential of the candidate vaccines for use in combination:** 
- Investigate the possibility of combining the candidate vaccines to enhance their protective efficacy and broaden their spectrum of activity against different strains or species of Baylisascaris.


4. **Investigate the long-term durability of the immune response induced by the candidate vaccines:** 
- Conduct long-term follow-up studies to assess the persistence of protective immunity and the need for booster vaccinations.


5. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccines in target populations:** 
- Conduct clinical trials in captive giant pandas and other susceptible populations to assess the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccines under field conditions.
