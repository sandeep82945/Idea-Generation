Contrary to non-relativistic density functional theory (DFT), spin\u2013orbit coupling, however, leads to a non-vanishing paramagnetic current density. Density functionals depending on the kinetic energy density, such as meta-generalized gradient approximations, should therefore be constructed in the framework of current DFT (CDFT). The latter has previously exclusively been used in the regime of strong magnetic fields. Herein, we present a consistent CDFT approach for relativistic DFT, including spin\u2013orbit coupling. Furthermore, we assess the importance of the current density terms for ground-state energies, excitation energies, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding, and spin\u2013spin coupling constants, as well as hyperfine coupling constants, \u0394g-shifts, and the nuclear quadrupole interaction tensor in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The most notable changes are found for EPR properties. The impact of the current-dependent terms rises with the number of unpaired electrons, and consequently, the EPR properties are more sensitive toward CDFT. Considerable changes are observed for the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functionals, as well as the B97M family and TASK. The current density terms are less important when exact exchange is incorporated. At the same time, the current-dependent kernel ensures the stability of response calculations in all cases. We, therefore, strongly recommend to use the framework of CDFT for self-consistent spin\u2013orbit calculations. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nA theoretical framework for physical and chemical properties of heavy elements necessitates a consideration of quantum mechanics and the inclusion of special relativity.1\u20139 The so-called relativistic effects refer to the difference between the results obtained from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and its relativistic counterparts, such as the Dirac equation or approximations thereof.10\u201315 These relativistic effects are commonly partitioned into a scalar-relativistic contribution, associated with the spatial contraction of the electron density, and spin\u2013orbit interaction, which describes the energetic splitting of the atomic p, d, and f states. The latter leads to\na breakdown of the spin symmetry and necessitates a complex two-component (2c) or four-component (4c) formalism when treated self-consistently. Due to the increased computational costs of a relativistic framework, mid-scale or large-scale calculations are typically performed with density functional theory (DFT) methods. This is usually done in a non-collinear formalism16\u201332 using the total particle density matrix and the spin magnetization vector. The expression of the exchange\u2013correlation functional itself is taken from the non-relativistic limit and evaluated with the so-called spin-up and spin-down quantities similar to the one-component unrestricted Kohn\u2013Sham (UKS) formalism. Relativistic corrections to the functional expression were shown to be marginal.33\u201338 In\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 204102 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0122394 157, 204102-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 23:05:22\nrecent years, such spin\u2013orbit density functional methods have become available in many quantum chemistry software suites.39\u201347 The two-component and four-component generalization of the local spin density approximation (LSDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is straightforward. However, a sophisticated generalization of meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and most local hybrid functionals (LHFs)48\u201353 requires additional considerations. In detail, spin\u2013orbit coupling is a form of magnetic induction.2,54,55 This is also illustrated in Refs. 4, 56, and 57 with the introduction of spin\u2013orbit coupling in the spirit of an internal magnetic field. Here, the interaction of the electron spin with the field of a charge in relative motion leads to magnetic induction. This effect induces a paramagnetic current density j\u20d7 p of the one-electron spinor functions {\u03c6j}. Here, the orbital contribution is defined as\nj\u20d7 p,0 = \u2212 i 2\u2211j (\u03c6\u2020j \u2207\u20d7\u03c6j \u2212 [\u2207\u20d7\u03c6j] \u2020\u03c6j), (1)\nand the spin counterparts using the Pauli matrices \u03c3u follow as\nj\u20d7 p,u = \u2212 i 2\u2211j (\u03c6\u2020j \u03c3u\u2207\u20d7\u03c6j \u2212 [\u2207\u20d7\u03c6j] \u2020\u03c3u\u03c6j) \u2200u \u2208 {x, y, z}. (2)\nIn two-component calculations, the paramagnetic current density of the ground state does not generally vanish.53,55,58,59 In other words, current-carrying states60\u201363 are observed. As noted in Ref. 64, for Kramers-restricted systems, the total or particle contribution of the paramagnetic current density vanishes, but the spin counterparts do not. Consequently, the kinetic energy density \u03c4 of meta-GGAs needs to be generalized and the most suited ansatz to generalize \u03c4 is to consider the paramagnetic current density j\u20d7 p itself. Here, j\u20d7 p does not depend explicitly on the specific magnetic perturbation.65\u201367 Thus, the generalized kinetic energy density reads\n\u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 \u2212 j\u20d7 2p 2\u03c1 with \u03c4 =\u2211 j ( \u02c6\u20d7p\u03c6j) \u2020 (\u02c6\u20d7p\u03c6j), (3)\nwith the electron density \u03c1 and the momentum operator \u02c6\u20d7p. We note in passing that \u03c4\u0303 originally arises for the Fermi curvature65 or the time-dependent electron localization function68 of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Using Eq. (3), the density functional approximations do not only depend on the electron density \u03c1 and its derivatives but also on the current density j\u20d7 p. Accordingly, functionals need to be constructed in the framework of current density functional theory (CDFT).58,69\u201383\nCurrently, CDFT is well established for molecular calculations in strong magnetic fields,58,76,80\u201383 i.e., formulations and implementations for ground-state energies, gradients, and excitation energies have been presented. However, we are not aware of a detailed study on spin\u2013orbit coupling within the framework of CDFT. In this work, CDFT will therefore be applied to the self-consistent treatment of spin\u2013orbit interaction, and we study its impact on ground-state energies, excitation energies, and magnetic resonance parameters, where the spin\u2013orbit perturbation is\nintroduced by either spin\u2013orbit effective core potentials1 (ECPs) or the one-electron exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian.84\u201394 Besides calculations in strong magnetic fields and CDFT, the generalized kinetic energy density was applied to linear response theory for time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT),95,96 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra,97,98 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties,97\u2013102 and magnetizabilities.100 In all these approaches, the paramagnetic current density of the ground state was assumed to vanish. Yet, the non-zero response of the current density already substantially affects the results in spin\u2013orbit perturbation approaches of the g-tensor for transition-metal complexes with a doublet ground state.98 Therefore, a generalization to a self-consistent treatment of spin\u2013orbit coupling, which also includes the current density in the calculation of the ground-state density matrix, seems promising\u2014especially for chemical systems with more than one unpaired electron."

(14)\nEquations (11)\u2013(14) arise from applying the 2 \u00d7 2 Pauli-spin matrices and the 2 \u00d7 2 unit matrix \u03c30 on the full 2c density matrix P\u03bc\u03bd = \u2211iC \u03bc i C \u03bd\u2217 i with an additional prefactor of 0.5 for the (anti-)symmetrization. C\u03bci are the respective complex 2c Kohn\u2013Sham spinor coefficients. Furthermore, P\u03b1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd = \u2211iC \u03bc i,\u03b1C \u03bd\u2217 i,\u03b1 denotes the corresponding sub-block of the full density matrix. The remaining density matrices P\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd and P \u03b2\u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd can be obtained accordingly by replacing one or both coefficients C\u03bci,\u03b1 by C \u03bc i,\u03b2. The density \u03c1, gradient of the density \u2207\u20d7\u03c1, and the kinetic energy density \u03c4 accordingly arise solely from the symmetric parts of Eqs. (11)\u2013(14). The symmetric parts are Re(P\u03b1\u03b1) + Re(P\u03b2\u03b2), Re(P\u03b1\u03b2) + Re(P\u03b2\u03b1), Im(P\u03b1\u03b2) \u2212 Im(P\u03b2\u03b1), and Re(P\u03b1\u03b1) \u2212 Re(P\u03b2\u03b2). On the contrary, the paramagnetic current density is an anti-symmetric quantity, arising from the complimentary anti-symmetric parts, i.e., Im(P\u03b1\u03b1) + Im(P\u03b2\u03b2), Im(P\u03b1\u03b2) + Im(P\u03b2\u03b1), Re(P\u03b1\u03b2) \u2212 Re(P\u03b2\u03b1), and Im(P\u03b1\u03b1) \u2212 Im(P\u03b2\u03b2).\nThe derivatives of the XC energy needed for the construction of the two-component Kohn\u2013Sham equations can be written as\nVXC(r\u20d7) = \u03b4EXC\n\u03b4\u03c1(r\u20d7) \u03c30 +\u2211\nu\n\u03b4EXC\n\u03b4mu(r\u20d7) \u03c3u\n= \u03b4EXC\n\u03b4\u03c1(r\u20d7) \u03c30 +\u2211\nu\n\u03b4EXC\n\u03b4s(r\u20d7) mu(r\u20d7) \u03c3u s(r\u20d7) (15)\nfor the density \u03c1 and the non-collinear spin magnetizations mu. \u03c1 and mu can be obtained from the symmetric (sy) parts of the density matrices Mu as\n\u03c1(r\u20d7) =\u2211 \u03bc\u03bd\nM0, sy\u03bc,\u03bd [\u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7)\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7)], (16)\nmu(r\u20d7) =\u2211 \u03bc\u03bd\nMu, sy\u03bc,\u03bd [\u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7)\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7)]. (17)\nNote that the kinetic energy density and j\u20d7 p are implicit and not explicit functionals of the density as discussed in Ref. 83. For the purpose of an implementation, the XC potential in a matrix representation is required. Hence, the derivative is formed with respect to the density matrices instead of the particle density and the spin magnetization.103 This directly leads to the matrix expression of VXC, i.e., VXC\u03bc\u03bd = \u27e8\u03c7\u03bc\u2223VXC(r\u20d7)\u2223\u03c7\u03bd\u27e9. Further necessary ingredients, i.e., the gradient of the density \u2207\u20d7\u03c1, the kinetic energy density \u03c4, and the paramagnetic current density j\u20d7 p, can be obtained from Mm (with m \u2208 {0, x, y, z}) as\n\u2207\u20d7\u03c1m(r\u20d7) =\u2211 \u03bc,\u03bd\nMm, sy\u03bc\u03bd [\u2207\u20d7\u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7)\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7) + \u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7)\u2207\u20d7\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7)], (18)\n\u03c4m(r\u20d7) = 1 2\u2211\u03bc,\u03bd Mm, sy\u03bc\u03bd [\u2207\u20d7\u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7) \u22c5 \u2207\u20d7\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7)], (19)\nj\u20d7 p,m(r\u20d7) = \u2212 i 2\u2211\u03bc,\u03bd Mm, as\u03bc\u03bd [\u2207\u20d7\u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7)\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7) \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc(r\u20d7)\u2207\u20d7\u03c7\u03bd(r\u20d7)]. (20)\nAs the paramagnetic current density is an anti-symmetric (as) quantity, the implementation of the XC potential also requires a generalization of the code infrastructure. Thus, we need the same density matrices as for the evaluation of exact exchange, and the current density can lead to contributions even in a Kramers-restricted framework.64\nThe derivative of the XC energy with respect to one of the density matrices M can then be obtained using the chain rule accordingly as\n\u03b4EXC \u03b4Mm\u03bc\u03bd = \u222b [ \u2202gXC \u2202\u03c1(r\u20d7) \u2202\u03c1(r\u20d7) \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202gXC \u2202\u2207\u20d7\u03c1(r\u20d7) \u2202\u2207\u20d7\u03c1(r\u20d7) \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202gXC \u2202\u03c4\u0303(r\u20d7) \u2202\u03c4\u0303(r\u20d7) \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd ] d3r,\n(21)\nwhere the last term arises from the current-dependent meta-GGA ingredient \u03c4\u030383 and m \u2208 {0, x, y, z}. By inserting Eq. (3), this term can be rewritten as\n\u2202\u03c4\u0303 \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03c4 \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 j\u20d7 p \u03c1 \u2202 j\u20d7 p \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd + j\u20d7 2p 2\u03c12 \u2202\u03c1 \u2202Mm\u03bc\u03bd .

(31)\nHere, k and l mark that the derivative could be taken with respect to two different density matrices, but usually they coincide up to the corresponding spinor cases. A detailed discussion and recipe for the implementation of Eq. (31) is provided in Ref. 58. We note that excited states can carry currents even if the ground-state current density vanishes, which was already considered by Bates and Furche.95 However, the CDFT framework leads to additional terms, which were previously neglected.28,113,124 For instance, Eq. (31) gives rise to coupling terms of two currents, yielding quadratic and j\u20d7 4p dependent terms.58\nThe local hybrid exchange\u2013correlation kernel is extended similarly. Currently, we neglect the calibration function in the two-component kernel.28 So far, this is only relevant for LH14t-calPBE,110 LH20t,52 and LHJ-HFcal.53 The other implemented functionals, such as LH07t-SVWN,125 LH07s-SVWN,126 LH12ct-SsirPW92,127 LH12ct-SsifPW92,127 LH20t\u2217,52 mPSTSa1,51,100 mPSTS-noa2,51,100 Johnson\u2019s 2014 local hybrid (LHJ14),50 LHJ-HF,53 Tao-Mo-Holzer-Franzke (TMHF),53 and TMHF-3P53 as well as the parent local hybrids Lh-BLYP and Lh-PBEPKZB,48 do not make use of a calibration function.\nD. Implementation The current density functional framework for spin\u2013orbit coupling was implemented in the TURBOMOLE quantum chemistry program suite.47,128\u2013130 The implementation is based on the machinery developed for strong magnetic fields58,131\u2013133 as well as the existing 2c meta-GGA26,124 and LHF routines28,53,100,112,113 with the standard kinetic energy density. Interfaces for Libxc134\u2013136 and XCFun137 are available to allow for calculations with (almost) all presented density functional approximations. Shared-memory parallelization is supported by the OpenMP standard throughout the SCF procedure and all properties.138,139\nNote that the generalized kinetic density and the paramagnetic current density require reworked thresholds. We have tightened the internal thresholds for the screening procedure109,140 by three orders of magnitude, as previously done for local hybrids in Ref. 101. This avoids oscillating energies during the SCF procedure.\nHerein, we have implemented the spin\u2013orbit coupling CDFT approach for ground-state energies and densities, which also allows us to calculate EPR properties.119,120 Additionally, geometry gradients are implemented for meta-GGAs by extension of the existing machinery.26,141 Furthermore, CDFT is available for the XC kernel of excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)124 and the correlation kernel augmented Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (cBSE),142 NMR spin\u2013spin coupling constants,101,102 as well as static, dynamic, and damped polarizabilities.28 Additionally, the XC kernel is the only relevant DFT ingredient for NMR shieldings and shifts with a common gauge origin.143 A respective X2C implementation is briefly discussed in the supplementary material."

Dirac\u2013Fock effective core potentials are used to model the inner 60 electrons of each bismuth atom (ECP60MDF).145 This is combined with a two-component self-consistent procedure to account for spin\u2013orbit coupling.

Parameters for the Gaussian charge distribution are taken from Ref. 174.

SCF procedures are converged to at least 10\u22128 Eh, and a threshold of 10\u22127 a.u. indicates convergence in the CPKS equations.

Therefore, the X2C Hamiltonian in the diagonal local approximation to the unitary decoupling transformation (DLU) is employed,97,101,119,120,141,155,178,179 which allows for large-scale applications180,181 with substantially reduced computational costs.

Consequently, a common gauge origin placed at the metal center is sufficient, and we use the restricted magnetic balance condition143 for the g-tensor. The x2c-QZVPall-2c basis set is used for all elements,157 and the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) is applied with the default parameters to compensate the negative charge.182,183 Very large grids (grid 5a) are employed.109,140,168 Structures are taken from Ref. 117, and SCF energies are converged with a threshold of 10\u22129 Eh. We consider the same meta-GGA-based functionals as for the TD-DFT and NMR study. Additionally, we use three local hybrid functionals, namely, LHJ14,50 LH20t,52 and TMHF.53\nResults with the standard kinetic energy density and the TPSS,146 TPSSh,146,160 r2SCAN,161,162 r2SCAN0,161\u2013163 LHJ14,50 LH20t,52 and TMHF53 functionals are taken from Refs. 53, 119, and 120. The nuclear g-factors are \u22120.365 389 0 (95Mo), 0.235 569 6 (183W), 1.263 201 9 (43Tc), 1.287 881 3 (187Re), and 0.439 955 5 (189Os).\nFifth, the hyperfine coupling constant of [TbPc2]\u2212, Pc = bis(phthalocyaninato) and gN = 1.342 752 3 for\n159Tb, with six unpaired electrons is studied. Here, the paramagnetic spin\u2013orbit term is the leading contribution.119,184 The structure is taken from Refs. 184 and 185. Calculations are performed with the Tao-Mo,159 TPSS,146 TPSSh,146,160 r2SCAN,161,162 r2SCAN0,161\u2013163 B97M,164 \u03c9B97M,165 LHJ14,50 and TMHF53 functionals. LH20t52 is excluded as the calibration function leads to an unfavorable 2c SCF behavior, and the SCF procedure did not converge in 300 cycles and 12 days on 24 OpenMP threads of an Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Gold 6212U central processing unit (CPU) @ 2.40 GHz. We use similar but tighter computational settings than in Ref. 119. The mSNSO-DLUX2C Hamiltonian97,101,119,141,155,178,179 in the finite nucleus model174 is applied together with the x2c-TZVPPall-2c basis set for Tb156 and the x2c-SVPall-2c basis set for the other elements.156 This basis set was shown to be sufficient for the Tb HFC constant.119 Very large grids (grid 5a) are employed.109,140,168 Moreover, the reduction of spherical grid points near a nucleus (pruning) is suppressed. The SCF procedure is converged with thresholds of 10\u22127 Eh for the energy and 10\u22127 a.u. for the root mean square of the density matrix. COSMO is applied with the settings for tetrahydrofurane (THF), i.e., a permittivity of \u03b5r = 7.520, a refraction index of n = 1.4050, a solvation radius of 1.30 \u00c5, and the default radii for the atoms.182,183 Additional calculations of La(II) and Lu(II)-based single molecule magnets186 are presented in the supplementary material. There, we discuss the HFC tensor, the g-tensor, as well as the electric field gradient and the nuclear quadrupole interaction tensor."

            "heading": "A. Ground-state energies of bismuth cluster cations",
            "text": "In order to assess the impact of the ground-state current density on molecular properties, we first investigate how ground-state energies and properties are impacted. In Ref. 144, Kelting et al. presented experimental studies and quantum chemical calculations on small bismuth cluster cations. For these calculations, a two-component approach was used in order to capture the effects induced by spin\u2013orbit coupling. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the relative stability of different isomers, \u0394Estab. The meta-GGA functional TPSS was used without considering the ground-state current density, i.e., ESO[j\u20d7 p = 0]. In this section, we revisit the investigation of bismuth cluster cations from Ref. 144, additionally taking the self-consistent relaxation of the ground-state current density into account as previously described in Sec. II A. We, thus, compare the total energy including spin\u2013orbit coupling with a relaxed current density, ESO[j\u20d7 p], to the treatment without considering j\u20d7 p. The difference between these two quantities (that is, the impact of the current density on the total energy) is presented in Table I as \u0394ECDFT. Moreover, the relative stability of isomers is calculated both without considering the current density, \u0394Estab[j\u20d7 p = 0], and with its relaxed counterpart, \u0394Estab[j\u20d7 p].\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 204102 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0122394 157, 204102-6\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 23:05:22\nEvidently, the relaxation of the ground-state current does have an impact on the total electronic energy, regardless of whether the systems exhibit Kramers symmetry. In a Kramers-restricted framework, the real and symmetric matrices in Eqs. (12)\u2013(14) are zero. However, their anti-symmetric counterparts used for the current density are not and CDFT consequently leads to energy changes for closed-shell systems. The energy associated with a ground-state current relaxation is of the order of a few dozen meV for these clusters, increasing in magnitude with an increasing cluster size. Following the variation principle, the inclusion and relaxation of the current density always results in a lower energy. The relative stability of isomers, however, is less affected by the relaxation of the ground-state current due to error compensation. For Bi5+, the deviation is \u223c12 meV, which amounts to an overall deviation of more than 2%. The interplay between the structure and the impact of the current density is illustrated by the relative energies of the isomers of Bi6+. Here, isomer II is only slightly affected as the relative stabilization of isomer I decreases from 24.8 to 24.5 meV. However, a large\nchange is observed for isomer III with a rise from 31.7 to 36.0 meV. That constitutes an increase by almost 14%. The two isomers of Bi8+ are also particularly affected, exhibiting a deviation of about 6 meV for the relative stability, which amounts to more than 4%. Other systems, such as the four isomers of Bi9+, show significantly less impact of a ground-state current relaxation, with deviations well below 1%.\nThe impact of the current density drastically depends on the density functional approximation. TPSS shows a modest dependence on the current density for magnetic properties.98 Therefore, we repeat the same calculations with the TASK functional. These results are listed in Table I as well. Significantly larger discrepancies between \u0394Estab[j\u20d7 p = 0] and \u0394Estab[j\u20d7 p] can be observed. The stability of isomer I of Bi5+ is severely overestimated if the ground-state current is neglected, with a deviation of 166 meV (around 30%). A similarly large deviation occurs for the relative stability of isomer III of Bi6+, where the stability of the isomer is overestimated by 43.5 meV (about 27%). Other cases are less problematic, but\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 204102 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0122394 157, 204102-7\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\ndeviations of up to 30% are not uncommon for the relative stabilities of the respective isomers. We also note that TASK changes the energetic order of the isomers for Bi6+, Bi8+, Bi10+, Bi11+, Bi13+, and Bi14+. The largest changes between TPSS and TASK are observed for Bi10+. Isomer I (C2v) is more stable than isomer II (Cs) by about 160 meV with TPSS. However, the latter isomer is lower in energy by more than 600 meV with TASK. This shows a substantial dependence of the cluster cations on the density functional approximation.\nTo summarize, the impact of the ground-state current density on the total energy is small. Yet, the error by not considering the current is clearly not negligible for all isomers. This particularly affects relative energies and stabilities, which are target quantities in many fields of quantum chemistry. Moreover, Kramers-symmetric closedshell systems suffer from the same errors as open-shell systems. In general, it is advisable to consider the self-consistent relaxation of the ground-state current density for systems with pronounced spin\u2013orbit coupling."

The mean average deviations and maximum deviations found for eight of the ten investigated molecules, all of them involving metal centers, are well below 0.05 eV. Compared to the general error of TD-DFT, which is up to 0.3 eV even for good density functionals, the additional kernel terms are not too important. This is in line with the findings of Bates and Furche95 and also with the more recent study of Liang et al.96 Contrarily, it was already suspected that relativistic effects may amplify the impact of the current density.58,95 This can be confirmed especially for non-hybrid meta-GGA functionals, as shown in Table II.\nTable II shows that especially functionals that strongly depend on the kinetic energy density \u03c4 are largely impacted by adding the current-dependent terms.

The mean and median deviations range up to 0.15 and 0.14 eV, outlining that the changes are quite significant even compared to the usual error bars of TD-DFT, set to 0.3\u20130.4 eV. The high median deviations also suggest that the influence is not caused by a few outliers, but rather systematic. By investigating the differences for every system individually, it also becomes clear that the shift for a functional is not uniform.\nFigure 1 outlines the deviations caused by neglecting the paramagnetic current density for the TASK functional. Clearly, some molecules are more affected than others. The largest deviation is found for TlH, where it can reach nearly 0.8 eV. In-between are AuH, the palladium and platinum chloride anions, as well as the uranyl complexes, where deviations of roughly 0.3 eV are found. In contrast, the rhenium complex [Re(bpy)(CO)3I] is hardly affected at all, and also for the tungsten oxide anion, only minor effects are observed. This is a rather critical result: TASK aims at describing non-locality and related effects and does so by enforcing large variants of the enhancement factor FX with respect to the kinetic energy density \u03c4. Therefore, semi-local functionals that aim at recovering charge-transfer (CT) excitations will be heavily affected by the current-dependent modification of the kinetic energy density, even for non-CT excited states. For these functionals, an appropriate modification of \u03c4, therefore, must be considered.\nFor hybrid functionals, the impact of j\u20d7 p is quickly reduced. For example, TPSSh has roughly only half the variation of TPSS. Some hybrids, such as TPSSh, may on average not see a lot of changes, but still spikes in deviation are obtained. These spikes range from 0.05 to 0.1 eV, making them less pronounced than the errors of semi-local functionals, yet still significant. Additionally, the general sign of the deviation is flipped for some hybrid functionals and molecules, yielding blue-shifts upon incorporating the current density. For semi-local functionals, only red-shifts are observed.\nJ. Chem.

The current density becomes strikingly important for HfO, as the ground state is deemed unstable if the current is neglected. Furthermore, r2SCAN also shows an instability for UO2+2 if the paramagnetic current density is neglected. Given this severe uncertainty of a possible identification of an unstable ground state, even though it is actually stable, current density terms need to be included in 2c meta-GGA and local-hybrid-based TD-DFT calculations."

For instance, the 1K(H\u2013F) coupling changes by 2 \u00d7 1019 T2/J, equaling almost 10%. This confirms the observations in Sec. IV B. The comparably pronounced dependence of the current density on TASK also holds for the shielding constants of HF. For hydrogen, the shielding constant changes by almost 1 ppm from 28.31 to 29.14 ppm. For all other functionals, the changes are typically in the range of 1%\u20133%. This is in line with the previous finding that the current density generalization from \u03c4 to \u03c4\u0303 is more important for open-shell systems than for closed-shell systems.98 For open-shell molecules, the current density induced by spin\u2013orbit in the ground state is considerable, and therefore, the coupling of the current in this state with the excited states is also more pronounced. For closed-shell systems, the main contribution stems from the terms with j\u20d7 p in the excited states of the XC kernel."

For the HFC, the current density functional framework leads to no real improvement, and the results are almost unaffected by the additional terms in the exchange\u2013correlation potential. This is due to the comparably small contribution of the paramagnetic spin\u2013orbit (PSO) contribution97,117,119 for these complexes. The scalar-relativistic Fermi-contact contribution is by far the dominating term. Thus, spin\u2013orbit interactions and current-dependent terms are of minor importance for many of these complexes.\nMatters are different for the g-tensor, as this quantity is defined via spin\u2013orbit coupling, i.e., all non-trivial terms of the g-tensor essentially arise due to spin\u2013orbit perturbations.97,204\u2013206 Here, the current density leads to notable changes in the MAPD of 6.5% and 5.2% for r2SCAN and r2SCAN0, respectively. B97M shows the largest change by a reduction of the MAPD from 34.43% to 25.17%. For TPSS, TPSSh, and Tao-Mo, much smaller changes of 1.0%\u20132.7% are observed. Still, the current density improves the results in all of these cases.\nAt first glance, only the standard deviation of TASK is affected by the current density. The sharp increase can be mainly attributed to [MoOBr5]2\u2212. The MAPD with respect to the experiment does not change notably, which is in stark contrast with the previous results presented herein and in our previous work using a perturbative ansatz.98 The largest changes of the individual results is again found for TASK. However, the impact of the current density on the MAPD with respect to the experiment cancels out. CDFT substantially improves the results for the 4d complexes, whereas it leads to a serious deterioration for the 5d complexes. Therefore, the impact of the CDFT framework with respect to the parent density functional is shown in Fig. 4. TASK, M06-L, B97M, M06-2X, r2SCAN, and r2SCAN0 are substantially affected by the current density, while almost no change is found for TPSS, TPSSh, M06, \u03c9B97M, and the Tao-Mo functional.

This effect is more pronounced for the current-dependent version of the tested functionals, leading to an iterative procedure for the solution of the response equations with semi-local functionals. Without the current density response, no iterations are required due to symmetry reasons.97 In line with the expectations, larger changes are evident for the current density functionals.

            "text": "We have investigated the effects of the paramagnetic current density j\u20d7 p on several properties in the relativistic regime using twocomponent density functional theory. We find significant effects for semi-local meta-generalized gradient approximation functionals in many properties for open- and closed-shell molecules. The errors\nof neglecting j\u20d7 p can be vast, leading to severely deteriorated results or even unstable states, as observed, for example, for the excitations of the HfO molecule on several occasions. As argued by Bates and Furche,95 further neglecting j\u20d7 p will also break the sum rules of TD-DFT in the limit of an infinite basis set. Another known issue is also that iso-orbital indicators may become ill-defined in some systems if j\u20d7 p is neglected. Therefore, we conclude that it is indeed necessary to take into account the current-density dependence for semi-local functionals that depend on the kinetic energy density. Unfortunately, this leads to a significantly raised computational effort that needs to be invested. For example, solving the coupledperturbed Kohn\u2013Sham equations occurring in the determination of NMR parameters or in time-dependent density functional theory is roughly four times more expensive due to the additional terms that need to be taken into account and the tightened thresholds for the numerical integration.\nOverall, the SCAN and Minnesota functional families as well as the B97M and TASK density functional approximations show the largest dependence on the current density. In particular, for TASK, the results are substantially affected by the inclusion of the current density. This may be rationalized by the enhancement factor FX with respect to the kinetic energy density \u03c4 and the constraints introduced in the construction of this functional. Generally, semi-local functionals that aim at recovering charge-transfer (CT) excitations will be notably affected by the current-dependent extension of the kinetic energy density\u2014even for non-CT excited states. Among the studied properties, the largest impact of the current density is observed for EPR g-tensors.\nFor (local) hybrid functionals, the influence of the paramagnetic current density is less pronounced. However, it can be significant occasionally. For these functionals, the cost of evaluating exact exchange largely outweighs that of the terms arising from j\u20d7 p. Additionally, restoring the iso-orbital constraint is of formal importance for local hybrids. Thus, we also recommend to take it into account for the latter class of functionals.\nTaking together, the results also indicate that an extension of this work to the gauge-invariant two-component formulation\nJ.

First, the current density substantially affects the results already when using a common gauge origin as shown herein. Second, the straightforward generalization of the kinetic energy density with the principle of minimal coupling ensures gauge-origin invariance209 yet leads to artifacts,98,99 especially for relativistic calculations and open-shell systems.98\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe supplementary material is available with the data for the statistical evaluation presented in the main text.

            "text": "Becke outlined in Ref. 66 that neglecting the current density is also the cause of too high energies for atomic states with magnetic quantum numbers ML when complex spherical harmonic basis\nfunctions are used. For real basis functions, which are not eigenfunctions of Lz , we can show that a similar effect can be observed. For each of the p-block atoms B, C, O, and F, two Hartree\u2013Fock, one being a generalized Hartree\u2013Fock (GHF) solution with Lz = 0 [which is identical to the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) solution] and the other one being a GHF solution with Lz = 1, are calculated. Then, at each GHF density, simply the energy of the TASK and TPSS functionals and that of their current-dependent version cTASK/cTPSS are calculated non self-consistently. The results, outlined in Table V, clearly show that also in this case, including the paramagnetic current density reduces the gap between these two states significantly, in excellent agreement with the effects observed by Becke.66\nFor the strongly current-dependent TASK functional, the importance is furthermore considerably higher than for TPSS. Interestingly, cTASK for this specific case outperforms cTPSS. This can be attributed to its stronger current-dependence, but also error cancellation between exchange and correlation may have a positive effect in this case.66 When spin\u2013orbit coupling is turned on, of course, only MJ is a good quantum number. Given the excellent performance of current-dependent DFT in situations with different ML, we also expect it to provide significant advantages over standard DFT for treating degeneracies of atomic multiplets with different values of MJ."
