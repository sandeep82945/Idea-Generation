            "text": "Journal of the Physical Society of Japan LETTERS\nSpin Conductivity Based on Magnetic Toroidal Quadrupole Hidden in\nAntiferromagnets\nSatoru Hayami1 and Megumi Yatsushiro1,2\n1Department of Applied Physics, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan 2Department of Physics, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan\nWe report our theoretical results on spin conductivity in antiferromagnets by focusing on the role of the magnetic toroidal quadrupole (MTQ) in electron systems. The MTQ is characterized as a time-reversal-odd rank-2 polar tensor degree of freedom in electrons, which is distinct from conventional rank-1 magnetic and magnetic toroidal dipoles. Based on a microscopic sd model analysis for a tetragonal system under both collinear and noncollinear antiferromagnetic orderings, we clarify that the MTQ becomes a source of an extrinsic spin conductivity even with neither a uniform magnetization nor spin-orbit coupling. We also list all the magnetic point groups to accommodate the MTQs as a primary order parameter as well as the candidate antiferromagnetic materials.\nA magnetic toroidal (MT) moment, which corresponds to a time-reversal-odd polar tensor, is one of the fundamental moments as well as electric and magnetic moments.1\u20133) Especially, the dipole component of the MT moment, i.e., the MT dipole (MTD), has been extensively studied in both theory and experiment, since it becomes a source of parity-violating physical phenomena in magnetic materials, such as the linear magnetoelectric effect,4\u20138) nonreciprocal directional dichroism,9\u201314) nonlinear magnon spin Nernst effect,15) and nonreciprocal magnon excitations.16\u201322) Although such MTD-related phenomena were originally investigated in magnetic insulators in the field of multiferroics, recent studies have clarified that the emergence of the MTD in magnetic metals results in similar multiferroic phenomena,23\u201330) nonreciprocal transport,31\u201333) spin-orbital-momentum locking,34) and nonlinear spin Hall effect,35) which extends the scope of MTD-related materials.36\u201338)\nThe MTD has often been described by the vector product of the position vector ri and the classical spin Si at site i, whose expression is given by1,2, 39,40)\nT = g\u00b5B\n2 \u2211 i ri \u00d7 Si, (1)\nwhere g and \u00b5B represent the g factor and the Bohr magneton, respectively. Hereafter, we omit g and \u00b5B in the expression. From Eq. (1), the MTD emerges under a vortex spin configuration, as shown in Fig. 1(a), whose spatial inversion (P) and time-reversal (T ) parities are odd owing to Pri = \u2212ri and T Si = \u2212Si; the MTD is distinct from the magnetic dipole characterizing a time-reversal-odd axial vector quantity like spin. The MTD manifests itself in various descriptions based on the quantum mechanical-operator expressions:41,42) the orbital hybridization43,44) and bond current.45\u201347)\nThe concept of the MTD moment is extended to higher-rank MT moments, which are referred to as MT multipoles39\u201341,48) or hyper-toroidal moments.49) Such higher-rank MT multipoles are described by a nonuni-\nform spatial distribution of the MTD. For example, the expressions of the higher-rank MT multipoles for a magnetic cluster with Si are given by using the spherical harmonics Ylm(r\u0302) as 50\u201353)\nTlm = cl \u2211 i (ri \u00d7 Si) \u00b7\u2207i [ rliY \u2217 lm(r\u0302i) ] , (2)\nwhere l and m represent the azimuthal quantum number and magnetic quantum number (\u2212l \u2264 m \u2264 l), and cl is the numerical coefficient. Since the spatial parity of Ylm(r\u0302i) is given by (\u22121)l, that of Tlm depends on the rank; the even(odd)-rank MT multipole is invariant (variant) under the P operation. Thus, physical properties under even-rank MT multipoles are qualitatively different from those under odd-rank MT multipoles like MTD. Nevertheless, an even-rank MT system has been less studied compared to an odd-rank one, since its characteristic features have been masked owing to the absence of uniform vector quantity.\nIn this Letter, we investigate the nature of the evenrank MT multipoles in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems in order to explore the possibility of exhibiting intriguing physical phenomena even without the uniform magnetic dipole (axial-vector quantity) and MTD (polarvector quantity). By focusing on the l = 2 component of\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n07 32\n6v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 1\n5 A\npr 2\n02 2\nthe MT multipole, i.e., the MT quadrupole (MTQ), in AFMs, we find that the emergence of the MTQ causes spin conductive phenomena. The mechanism does not rely on atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This is qualitatively different from that in the noncentrosymmetric nonmagnetic systems, where the antisymmetric SOC plays an important role. Although the present mechanism is closely related to the previous findings in the SOC-free AFMs with the spin-split band structure,54\u201360) we show that the nonzero spin conductivity survives even without the spin-split band structure. We demonstrate it by exemplifying both the collinear and noncollinear AFM orderings in the tetragonal system. Moreover, we list all the magnetic point groups (MPGs) with the MTQs but without the magnetic dipole in addition to the candidate materials. Our results open up a new direction of AFMs as a spin current generator based on the MTQ, which stimulates further exploration of the functional materials applicable to spintronics.\nLet us start by showing the cluster-multipole expression of the MTQ in AFMs, which is obtained as the l = 2 component in Eq. (2):\nTu = \u2211 i (2zit z i \u2212 xitxi \u2212 yit y i ), (3) Tv = \u221a\n3 \u2211 i (xit x i \u2212 yit y i ), (4)\n(Tyz, Tzx, Txy) = [ \u221a 3 \u2211 i (yit z i + zit y i ), (cyclic)], (5)\nwhere ti = ri\u00d7Si. The MTQ is described by the spatial distribution of the local MTD ti, as schematically plotted in the case of Tv [Eq. (4)] in Fig. 1(b). All the MTQs have even P parity but odd T parity. Although such a transformation regarding P and T is common to that of the magnetic dipole (uniform magnetization), the transformation regarding other point group operations, such as the mirror and rotational operations, is different owing to the different rank of multipoles.61,62) In terms of the representation theory, the MTQs can belong to the different irreducible representations from the magnetic dipoles under an MPG. We find 22 MPGs with the finite MTQ but without the magnetic dipole, as discussed below (see Table I), where pure MTQ-related physical phenomena are expected.\nThe expressions in Eqs. (3)\u2013(5) also give a relationship between the MTQ and the AFM spin configuration. To demonstrate that, we here consider an eight-sublattice rectangular solid, as shown in Fig. 2(a). When supposing that the basal plane is square, the eight-sublattice system belongs to the MPG 4/mmm1\u2032. By performing the multipole expansion for the magnetic cluster based on the virtual atomic cluster method,52) one finds that five out of twenty-four AFM spin configurations possess nonzero MTQ moments and belong to the different irreducible representation from the magnetic dipole; the five irreducible representations are represented as A\u22121g \u2295 2B \u2212 1g \u2295 2B \u2212 2g (the superscript stands for the timereversal parity). Here, the irreducible representations of A\u22121g, B \u2212 1g, and B \u2212 2g correspond to nonzero Tu, Tv, and Txy, respectively.\n(a) (b)\nAmong them, we examine two AFM orderings with Tv as examples, which are characterized by the collinear and noncollinear spin configurations, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. In the noncollinar spin configuration in Fig. 2(b), each spin points along the \u3008110\u3009 direction. In both AFM cases, the system reduces to 4\u2032/mmm\u2032. Although one obtains nonzero Tv for these AFM spin configurations by evaluating Eq. (4), its appearance is intuitively understood from the spatial distribution of the MTD in each plaquette; the Tv-type distribution appears as shown by the pink arrows in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), which well corresponds to the distribution in Fig. 1(b).\nNext, we consider the lattice system consisting of the eight-sublattice unit cell, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The sd model Hamiltonian is given by\nH = \u2212 \u2211 ij\u03c3 tijc \u2020 i\u03c3cj\u03c3 \u2212 \u2211 i\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 hi \u00b7 c\u2020i\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u2032ci\u03c3\u2032 , (6)\nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3 (ci\u03c3) is the creation (annihilation) operator for site i and spin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193. The Hamiltonian consists of the hopping term with the five hopping parameters (t, t\u2032, tz, t \u2032 z, txy) in Fig. 2(c) and the AFM mean-field term to induce the spin configurations in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). For example, we set hA = (0, 0, h) for the collinear spin configuration in Fig. 2(a) and hA = (\u2212h,\u2212h, 0) for noncollinear one in Fig. 2(b). In the following, we set t = 1 as the energy unit and set t\u2032 = 0.5, tz = 0.6, and t \u2032 z = 0.3. We take the equal lattice constants for both x and z directions for simplicity.\nWe briefly discuss the stabilization mechanisms of the spin configurations, i.e., the origin of hi, in Figs. 2(a)\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n(a) (c)\n(b) (d)\nxy with fixed ne = 0.2 for h = 0.2 and\nh = 2 at (c) txy = 0 and (d) txy = 0.2.\nand 2(b). One of the mechanisms is the direct exchange interaction between the neighboring spins; the ferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg interaction along the z (x and y) directions favors the collinear spin configuration in Fig. 2(a), while the ferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg interaction along the x and y (z) directions in addition to the AFM interaction along the \u3008110\u3009 direction can lead to the noncollinear spin configuration in Fig. 2(b).63) Another mechanism is based on the effective magnetic interaction in itienrant magnets;64) the instability toward the spin configurations in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) has been discussed in the double exchange model and the periodic Anderson model in the limit of the square (t = t\u2032 and tz = t \u2032 z = txy = 0) 65\u201367) and cubic (t = t\u2032 = tz = t \u2032 z and txy = 0) 67\u201370) lattices. In addition to these factors, although the SOC might play a role in determining the spin directions, we neglect it in order to examine the behavior driven by the magnetic phase transition.\nAs the MTQ is characterized by the rank-2 polar tensor, its emergence leads to various physical phenomena, such as the linear magneto-elastic effect and the nonlinear magnetoelectric effect.41,62) Among them, we focus on the spin-conductivity tensor \u03c3 \u03b7(s) \u00b5\u03bd in J\n\u03b7(s) \u03bd =\u2211\n\u00b5 \u03c3 \u03b7(s) \u00b5\u03bd E\u00b5, 61) which has often been refereed to as the magnetic spin Hall effect;71\u201376) J \u03b7(s) \u03bd = J\u03bd\u03c3\u03b7 represents the spin current with the spin \u03c3\u03b7 and E\u00b5 represents the electric field for \u00b5, \u03bd, \u03b7 = x, y, z. We compute \u03c3 \u03b7(s) \u00b5\u03bd by evaluating the J \u03b7(s) \u03bd -J\u00b5 correlation function based on the Kubo formula following Ref. 76 with the scattering rate \u03c4\u22121 = 10\u22122 and the temperature T = 10\u22122, unless otherwise mentioned. The summation of the wave vector k\nand (b) \u03c3 z(s) xy and \u03c3 z(s) yx for h = 0.2 and h = 2 at txy = 0 in the noncollinear AFM in Fig. 2(b).\nis taken over 1203 grid points in the first Brillouin zone. Nonzero components of \u03c3 \u03b7(s) \u00b5\u03bd in the 4\u2032/mmm\u2032 symmetry under the AFM orderings are given by \u03c3 x(s) yz , \u03c3 x(s) zy , \u03c3 y(s) zx , \u03c3 y(s) xz , \u03c3 z(s) xy , and \u03c3 z(s) yx .\nWe first discuss the result for the collinear AFM in Fig. 2(a). Owing to the absence of the SOC, only the z component of \u03c3 \u03b7(s) \u00b5\u03bd becomes nonzero, i.e., \u03c3 x(s) yz = \u03c3 x(s) zy = \u03c3 y(s) zx = \u03c3 y(s) xz = 0. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the filling\n(ne = \u2211 i\u03c3\u3008c \u2020 i\u03c3ci\u03c3\u3009/8) dependence of \u03c3 z(s) xy for h = 0.2 and h = 2 at (a) txy = 0 and (b) txy = 0.2. Both results in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) indicate that nonzero \u03c3 z(s) xy is obtained for small h = 0.2 and large h = 2 unless the system becomes insulating at ne = 1. Moreover, we confirm that only the symmetric component of the spin conductivity, i.e., \u03c3 z(s) xy = \u03c3 z(s) yx , appears, which is expected from the symmetry analysis in the presence of Tv. 61)\nMeanwhile, one finds that the magnitudes of \u03c3 z(s) xy in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) are substantially different from each other; the values with txy = 0.2 is much larger than those with txy = 0 by the order of 10 3. Their difference is understood from the different mechanisms of \u03c3 z(s) xy that originates from the electronic band structures; the system with txy 6= 0 exhibits the spin-split band structure in the form of kxky\u03c3z [inset of Fig. 3(b)], while that with txy = 0 does not [inset of Fig. 3(a)].\n54,55,77,78) The absence of the spin splitting with txy = 0 is attributed to the fact that there are no microscopic degrees of freedom in the hopping term to couple to the AFM mean fields.55) Since the spin splitting as kxky\u03c3z indicates the direct coupling between the spin current Jy\u03c3z \u223c ky\u03c3z (Jx\u03c3z \u223c kx\u03c3z) and input field Ex (Ey) that flows the electric current in metals Jx \u223c kx (Jy \u223c ky), \u03c3z(s)xy is largely enhanced for txy 6= 0. In fact, the intraband pro-\ncess is dominant for txy 6= 0 [Fig. 3(b)], while only the interband one is present for txy = 0 [Fig. 3(a)]. Such a difference is found in the \u03c4\u22121 dependence of \u03c3 z(s) xy in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d); the case for txy = 0 (txy 6= 0) is proportional to \u03c4\u22121 (\u03c4), which means that the interband (intraband) process is dominant.\nTo further examine the difference in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) from the viewpoint of the model-parameter dependence, we expand \u03c3 z(s) xy as a polynomial form of products of the Hamiltonian matrix at wave vector k, H(k), and the velocity operator, vk = \u2202H(k)/\u2202k, based on the procedure in Ref. 79. As a result, the lowest-order contribution to \u03c3 z(s) xy is given by ht2xy for txy 6= 0, while that is given by h(t2 \u2212 t\u20322)2 for txy = 0. This indicates that the complicated hopping path in real space is necessary in the case of txy = 0, which tends to suppress \u03c3 z(s) xy .\nNext, we discuss the spin conductivity for the noncollinear AFM in Fig. 2(b). In the noncollinear AFM, all the components allowed from the symmetry (\u03c3 x(s) yz , \u03c3 x(s) zy , \u03c3 y(s) zx , \u03c3 y(s) xz , \u03c3 z(s) xy , and \u03c3 z(s) yx ) become nonzero. We show the behaviors of \u03c3 x(s) yz and \u03c3 x(s) zy in Fig. 4(a) and those of \u03c3 z(s) xy and \u03c3 z(s) yx in Fig. 4(b) against ne for h = 0.2 and h = 2 at txy = 0. We omit the results of \u03c3 y(s) zx and \u03c3 y(s) xz , as they are related to \u03c3 x(s) zy and \u03c3 x(s) yz owing to the 4\u2032 symmetry. In contrast to the collinear AFM case, as shown in Fig. 4(a), there is an antisymmetric component between \u03c3 x(s) zy and \u03c3 x(s) yz , i.e., \u03c3 x(s) zy \u2212 \u03c3x(s)yz 6= 0, which is attributed to the noncollinear structure; y-spin component contributes to the difference between \u03c3 x(s) zy and \u03c3 x(s) yz . Both \u03c3 x(s) yz and \u03c3 x(s) zy show similar behavior to that in Fig. 3(a), where only the interband process contributes to the spin conductivity; the diagonal hopping in the xz and yz plane like between sublattices A and H is necessary to enhance the spin conductivity through the intraband contribution owing to the spin-split band structure. For \u03c3 x(s) yz and \u03c3 x(s) zy , the lowest-order essential model parameter dependence is given by h(t2 \u2212 t\u20322)(t2z \u2212 t\u20322z ). Another differece from the collinear AFM is found in \u03c3 z(s) xy and \u03c3 z(s) yx , as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 4(b). In the noncollinear AFM, the out-of-plane z-spin component of the spin conductivity also becomes nonzero, as pointed out in the previous studies.72,73) In the present noncollinear AFM structure, we obtain the antisymmetric spin conductivity to satisfy \u03c3 z(s) xy = \u2212\u03c3z(s)yx , as shown in Fig. 4(b). However, it is noted that the mechanism of \u03c3 z(s) xy and \u03c3 z(s) yx is different from that depending on \u03c4\u22121 or \u03c4 in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d); \u03c3 z(s) xy and \u03c3 z(s) yx does not show the \u03c4 dependence. In other words, the intrinsic interband process like the spin Hall effect in the nonmagnetic systems with the SOC80,81) and longitudinal spin conductivity in the systems with the electric toroidal dipole82) is dominant for \u03c3 z(s) xy and \u03c3 z(s) yx , where the vector chirality degree of freedom in the plaquette ACBD or EGFH plays a similar role to the SOC. Thus, this component is regarded as a secondary effect owing to the effective SOC under the noncollinear spin configuration rather than the MTQ-driven effect. The necessity of the noncollinear spin configuration is verified in the parameter expansion of\n\u03c3 z(s) xy ; the essential model parameters are proportional to h2 as given by h2(t2 \u2212 t\u20322)2.83)\nSo far, we have shown that the AFM with the MTQ in the 4\u2032/mmm\u2032 system in Fig. 2(c) exhibits the characteristic spin conductivity. We discuss the possible magnetic systems from the symmetry viewpoint to stimulate experimental findings of the MTQ-related phenomena. Among all 122 types of MPGs, the MTQ becomes active for 42 MPGs.62) Furthermore, for 22 out of 42 MPGs, the MTQ is regarded as a primary order parameter, as the lower-rank magnetic dipole is not activated. We list these 22 MPGs accompanying the MTQs in Table I, where the information about the P symmetry, other activated multipoles contributing to the spin conductivity (T0 represents the MT monopole and Mxyz, M3b, and M \u03b2 z represent the magnetic octupoles),61,62) and candidate materials reported in MAGNDATA94) are also shown. As these 22 MPG systems are not affected by the magneticdipole-related phenomena, one can expect pure MTQrelated phenomena.\nTo summarize, we have investigated the MTQ, which corresponds to the time-reversal-odd rank-2 polar tensor degree of freedom, accompanied by the AFM spin configuration. By analyzing the sd model in the presence of the AFM mean fields under the 4\u2032/mmm\u2032 symmetry, we found that both collinear and noncollinear AFMs exhibit spin conductivity with the dissipation once the MTQ is activated. We have shown two types of mechanisms for spin conductivity: One arises from the interband process without the spin-split band structure, while the other arises from the intraband process induced by the spinsplit band structure. We provided all the MPGs to possess the MTQ but without the magnetic dipole in order to stimulate exploration of MTQ-related physics.\nAcknowledgments This research was supported by\nJSPS KAKENHI Grants Numbers JP19K03752, JP19H01834,\nJP21H01037, and by JST PRESTO (JPMJPR20L8).
