Extension to Dynamic Environments: Explore how the model and its mechanisms adapt when agents and/or facilities can move over time. This involves investigating how temporal changes in agent locations or environmental factors affecting the scaling function influence the optimal facility placement, and developing dynamic strategyproof mechanisms to continuously update facility locations in response to these changes.

Multi-Facility Location Problem: Extend the model to accommodate multiple facilities, where each agent's cost is influenced by multiple scaling factors corresponding to their distance to each facility. Research could focus on developing efficient algorithms to find the optimal locations of multiple facilities while considering the interactions between different scaling functions and their cumulative impact on agents' costs.

Experimental Evaluation and Real-World Applications: Conduct empirical studies to validate the theoretical models and mechanisms using real-world data. For example, analyze the placement of emergency services, public transportation stops, or mobile network towers in urban planning. These studies could help refine the models to better capture the complexities of real-world scenarios and test the practicality of proposed mechanisms in achieving fair and efficient outcomes.

Robustness to Information Asymmetry and Uncertainty: Investigate the robustness of the proposed mechanisms under conditions of information asymmetry, where agents have incomplete or inaccurate information about others' locations or the scaling function. Additionally, study the impact of uncertainty in the scaling function due to unpredictable environmental changes, and develop mechanisms that are resilient to such uncertainties.

Non-Continuous Scaling Functions and Alternative Distance Metrics: Explore the implications of using non-continuous scaling functions, such as those with discrete jumps or highly non-linear behaviors, on the facility location problem. Additionally, consider alternative distance metrics beyond the L1 norm, such as L2 (Euclidean) or other norms, to understand how they affect the optimal solution and the design of strategyproof mechanisms.
