Longitudinal Studies on Mental Health Outcomes: Investigate the long-term mental health outcomes of IM trainees who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic during their training. This research could explore how pandemic-related stressors (e.g., increased burnout, decreased supervision) have impacted their mental health over time and identify strategies that have been effective in mitigating these impacts.

Effectiveness of Virtual Education Modalities: With the shift to virtual conferences and remote education, it's essential to assess the effectiveness of these new teaching modalities compared to traditional in-person methods. Research could focus on evaluating educational outcomes, trainee satisfaction, and knowledge retention to inform future curriculum development in times of crisis.

Impact of Pandemic on Career Choices: The paper suggests that the pandemic may influence trainees' career choices, with some being more likely to choose a subspecialty. Future research could explore how the pandemic has shaped the career trajectories of IM trainees, including factors influencing their specialty choices and whether these changes are temporary or represent a longer-term shift in career planning.

Systemic Racism and Discrimination Experiences: The paper highlights an increase in systemic discrimination experienced by trainees during the pandemic. Future studies could delve deeper into the experiences of discrimination among healthcare workers, focusing on the causes, effects on well-being and professional development, and strategies for addressing and reducing discrimination within healthcare institutions.

Financial Impact and Compensation Models: With many trainees not receiving additional compensation despite increased workloads and risks, future research could explore the financial impact of the pandemic on trainees. This includes assessing the adequacy of existing compensation models, the financial stress experienced by trainees, and proposing equitable compensation strategies that acknowledge the contributions and risks undertaken by trainees during crises.
