This study aims to verify the hepatoprotective activity of XHP and explain its possible mechanism.\nMethods: The hepatoprotective activity of XHP was evaluated by constructing a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease, and the mechanism of XHP was preliminarily explained by utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS), proteomics and network pharmacology.\nResults: The current study demonstrated that treatment with XHP ameliorated acute alcohol-induced liver injury in mice by significantly reducing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and triglycerides (TGs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Remarkably, treatment also increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content. UPLC-QTOF/MS, 199 compounds were identified as within the makeup of the XHP. Network pharmacology analysis showed that 103 targets regulated by 163 chemical components may play an important role in the protective liver effect mediated by XHP. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis suggest that the HIF-1, FoxO, PI3K-Akt, insulin, and thyroid hormone signaling pathways are key modulators of XHP\u2019s effects. Finally, eight key targets including Mapk1, Mapk3, Akt1, Map2k1, Pik3ca, Pik3cg, Raf1, and Prkca were verified by molecular docking and proteomics analysis, which provide insight into the hepatoprotective effect observed with XHP treatment.\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\nConclusion: In summary, these results improved upon knowledge of the chemical composition and the potential mechanisms of hepatoprotective action of oral XHP treatment, providing foundational support for this formulation as a viable therapeutic option for alcoholic liver disease.\nKEYWORDS\nalcohol liver disease, chemical components, molecular docking, network pharmacology, Proteomics"

            "text": "Excessive drinking is an important public health problem in the world and a major risk factor for high morbidity and mortality from alcohol liver disease (ALD), which is the second most common liver disease (1, 2). ALD is a complex syndrome that consists of several stages including mild alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic liver fibrosis, and alcoholic cirrhosis (3, 4). Because ALD is an advanced and incurable progressive disease, early prevention and treatment can attenuate the development of irreversible lesions (5).\nIn China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to prevent and treat ALD has historically been a common treatment regimen. For example, Bupleurum chinense DC. (B. chinense) and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (S. baicalensis) are routinely used as modern clinical herbal treatments for liver disease (6). Additionally, Ephedra sinica Stapf (E. sinica), Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (C. cassia), and Smilax glabra Roxb. (S. glabra) have been shown to mediate benefits within the liver. The rest of the herbs are shown to strengthen and eliminate toxins (7\u2013 12). On the basis of summarizing various classical liver-protecting prescriptions, this study combines commonly used TCM to make a novel treatment, called the XHP. While, anecdotally, this XHP combination had a positive feedback within the community for patients suffering from ALD, scientific evidence regarding the effect of XHP as a treatment for ALD lacking the mechanism of action for potential liver benefits is unclear.\nThe recent rise in network pharmacological approaches provides an effective opportunity for studying the effects of a multi-component and multi-target therapy, such as that of complex TCM formulations (13, 14). However, traditional network pharmacology methods are typically established by querying chemical components present in established databases, but the exact composition of many TCM therapies are not well understood.\nHowever, advancements within modern high-resolution mass spectrometry and bioinformatics provide the opportunity for identifying the chemical formulation of previously enigmatic TCM therapies. Specifically , ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/ MS) coupled with UNIFI software offers the advantage of reliably identifying specific compounds within commonly used TCM.\nIn the present study, the above techniques were utilized to study the hepatoprotective effect and mechanism of XHP in the setting of\n02\nALD. The comprehensive chemical profile of XHP was identified with UPLC-QTOF/MS together with UNIFI software. A mouse model of acute alcoholic liver injury was employed to evaluate the hepatoprotective efficacy of XHP. Network pharmacology analysis predicted potential XHP targets, which were confirmed with proteomics and molecular docking experiments."

            "text": "Histological analysis via HE staining (Figure 1A) demonstrated that livers from mice in the healthy control group exhibited normal hepatic lobe structure and typical hepatic cord arrangement. As expected, analysis of liver cells from mice in the alcohol-only model group exhibited moderate flaky edema, disordered hepatic cord arrangement, and swelled hepatocytes surrounding the central vein, and vesicular steatosis was observed in the cytoplasm. In mice treated with alcohol, XHP exposure dose-dependently ameliorated these pathological markers. The contents of ALT and AST in serum were key biological indicators for evaluating liver function, which could directly reflect the degree of liver damage (17). Alcohol induced a significant increase in serum ALT and AST, with the AST content almost twofold higher than ALT, which is a typical feature of alcoholic liver disease clinically. Treating mice with alcohol liver injury with either the XHP-M and XHP-H dose significantly reduced serum ALT and AST levels (Figures 1B, C).\nExcessive ethanol intake could induce fat synthase activity and accumulate a large amount of triglycerides, which in turn would lead to abnormal blood circulation in the liver, increased portal pressure, and accelerated deterioration of ALD (18, 19). As shown in Figure 1D, the triglyceride content of the alcohol-control group was twofold higher relative to healthy controls. Both the XHP-M and XHP-H doses significantly reduced TG levels in the liver (p < 0.05), suggesting that XHP treatment regulates TG liver storage. Oil red O staining (Figure 1E) further confirmed this observation, as a large number of lipid droplets were apparent in alcohol-only\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 05\nsamples, and XHP attenuated this response in a dosedependent manner.\nOxidative stress is an important mechanism underlying the progression of ALD (20). SOD activity and MDA and GSH content are reliable measures of antioxidant capacity (21\u201323). XHP treatment in mice experiencing alcohol-induced liver injury dosedependently reduced levels of oxidative stress as the greatest benefits with regard to MDA levels (Figure 1F), SOD activity (Figure 1G), and GSH levels (Figure 1H) returned to levels observed in healthy controls with XHP-H. Taken together, the hepatoprotective mechanism of XHP may be related to enhancing the liver\u2019s ability to resist lipid peroxidation and scavenge oxygen free radicals.\n3.2 Identification of chemical constituents in XHP\nThe constructed XHP library contained a total of 1,501 chemical components, 363 from E. sinica, 349 from B. chinense, 280 from G. uralensis, 220 from C. cassia, 190 from P. ginseng, 188 from L. chinense, 143 from S. baicalensis, 76 from R. glutinosa, 55 from A. macrocephala, and 34 from S. glabra.\nThe mass spectrometry data collected in positive and negative ion mode were automatically referenced to the UNIFI database.

Figure 6B demonstrates the significant differences in protein expression between all three experimental groups. In addition, the protein expression levels of eight key targets in the treatment group showed a back regulation. Mapk1, Mapk3, and Map2k1 belong to the main members of the MAPK family (31), which play an important role in many pathological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and the inflammatory response. Taken together, inhibiting protein expression of MAPK has the potential to effectively alleviate inflammation alcoholic liver disease. Akt1 regulates cell proliferation and growth, reduces the expression of Akt1 protein in the body, and effectively inhibits the proliferation of liver cancer cells and promotes their apoptosis (32). The high expression of Pik3ca and Prkca could cause liver cancer cells to proliferate. The function of Pik3cg gene was related to cell growth, survival, proliferation, movement, and morphology.
