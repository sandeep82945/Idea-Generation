All desensitizations were carried out at outpatient settings under close observation with one-onone nurse-to-patient care in the allergy unit. If any BTR occured during the protocol, infusion was suspended and the reaction was treated. After the reaction resolved, the protocol was continued starting from the previous step which BTR occured.

BTR rates are higher in platins compared to other chemotherapeutics.6\u201311 There are some studies reporting the outcomes of desensitizations and the BTRs with platins.6\u201315 However, only a few studies have evaluated risk factors for BTRs with platins and reported different risk factors from each other such as the number of previous platin infusions \u2265 10 courses, total IgE level \u2265 100 U/mL, drug skin test positivity, or severe initial HSRs for moderate to severe BTRs.7,9,13 Further studies are needed to identify patients in the risk group.\nThe aim of this study was to define the outcomes of desensitizations, list the characteristics of BTRs, and to identify the risk factors for BTR in patients with thoracic malignancies who underwent desensitization with cisplatin or carboplatin."

            "text": "In this study, we retrospectively reported the characteristics of initial HSRs, the outcomes of desensitizations, and the characteristics and risk factors for the development of BTRs with cisplatin and carboplatin in patients with lung cancer and MPM. During the study period, a total of 105 desensitizations were performed in 47 patients. Thirtythree BTRs were observed in 46.8% (n = 22) of the patients. In most of the patients (72.7%, n = 16), the first BTR was observed in the first desensitization course. There was no statistical difference in the frequency or the severity of BTRs between cisplatin and carboplatin. Skin test positivity with cisplatin and carboplatin was 43.5 and 50%, respectively. Skin test positivity was not found to be associated with initial HSR severity but BTR development was statistically significantly higher in patients with positive skin tests. As a result of multivariate analysis, previous platinum infusions \u226510 courses were found to be an independent risk factor for BTR development.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study has the largest lung cancer and MPM patient population among studies evaluating platin desensitization outcomes in the literature. Thirty-three lung cancer and 14 MPM diagnosed patients were included in the study. Although platins are first-line treatment options in both NSCLC and SCLC (small cell lung cancer), all of the patients with lung cancer included in this study over a 9-year period were diagnosed as NSCLC. In a study that included 142 patients who developed platin- induced HSR over a 5-year period, three patients with SCLC and two patients with NSCLC were reported.22 Although no difference was found in terms of BTR development between NSCLC subtypes in our study, it can be more clearly evaluated whether the development of HSR with platins in SCLC is more rare than in NSCLC in future studies with larger patient populations.\nHSRs to platins are usually IgE-mediated and require previous exposure before immunological sensitization; therefore, the incidence of HSRs increases with multiple exposure.18,23,24 A study investigating the clinical features of HSR to carboplatin in 205 patients reported that the incidence of HSRs was increased from 1 to 27% in patients who received seven or more courses.25 In our study, initial HSRs occurred at median 8 (range: 4\u201315) infusion of culprit platin, similar to some previous studies.10,15,25,26\nST is the most widely used diagnostic tool in the evaluation of platin HSRs. In this study, skin test positivity with cisplatin and carboplatin was 43.5 and 50%,\nto be desensitized in subsequent courses; two BTRs were observed in three patients, and three BTRs were observed in four patients.\nWhen initial HSR and first BTR were compared in patients who developed BTR, no statistically significant difference was observed in terms of clinical symptoms (Table 3) and severity of reactions (p = 0.577) (Table 4). There was also no statistical difference between first BTR severities among the patients with positive or negative skin tests (p = 0.402).\nAll but one BTR occured during bag 3 and one BTR occured 15 minutes after the end of the desensitization procedure. Most of the BTRs (63.6%; 21 of 33) occured at the last step of the protocol.\nIn the treatment of BTRs, epinephrine was administered in nine patients (27.3%); two of them had severe BTRs and seven of them had moderate BTRs. Epinephrine administration in the treatment of first BTR was found to be significantly higher in patients who were administered epinephrine during the initial HSR (p = 0.036).\nThe target dose could be achieved in 97 of 105 (92.4%) desensitization courses. The characteristics of the remaining eight patients were as follows: one patient did not want to continue the procedure, two patients were in the last course of their therapy and the primary physician decided not to continue the procedure, one of them had severe BTR, three patients had a second BTR during the continuation of the procedure, one of them required two repeated doses of epinephrine, two patients required epinephrine administration for BTR and we decided not to continue procedure, and one of them had severe BTR.\nTable 3 Comparision of the initial HSR and first BTR clinical symptoms in the BTR-positive group.\nClinical symptoms, n (%) Initial HSR First BTR P\nCutaneous 19 (86.4) 22 (100) Respiratory 8 (36.4) 5 (22.7) 0.309 Cardiovascular 6 (27.3) 5 (22.7) 0.100 Gastrointestinal 6 (27.3) 3 (13.6) 1.00 Neurologic 4 (18.2) Laryngeal 2 (9.1) 3 (13.6) 0.260 Other systemic 6 (27.3)\nHSR, hypersensitivity reaction; BTR, breakthrough reaction.\nTable 4 Comparision of the initial HSR and first BTR severities in the BTR-positive group.\nReaction severity\nFirst BTR Grade\nP Mild, n (%) Moderate, n (%) Severe, n (%)\nInitial HSR Grade\nMild, n (%) 5 (22.7) 3 (13.6) 1 (4.5) 0.577 Moderate, n (%) 3 (13.6) 4 (18.2) Severe, n (%) 4 (18.2) 1 (4.5) 1 (4.5)\nHSR, hypersensitivity reaction; BTR, breakthrough reaction.\nlevel \u2265 100 U/mL (OR:8.24, 95% CI:2.06\u201330.02).7 Kim et al. reported 1143 desensitizations with one bag protocol performed in 228 patients. Six hundred and fifty one of the desensitizations were performed with platins in 123 patients (57 oxaliplatin, 49 carboplatin, and 17 cisplatin). BTR rate was 34% for platins. They reported that severe initial HSRs were a significant risk factor of moderate to severe BTRs, especially in platins (OR: 1.556, 95% CI:1.05\u20132.28), and that the use of steroid was statistically significant in reducing the occurrence rate of moderate to severe BTRs and this preventative effect was more pronounced for platins (OR: 0.504, 95% CI:0.311\u20130.818). They also reported that the BTR rate was decreased in patients who went through several desensitization cycles (OR:0.944, 95% CI: 0.899\u20130.992).9 In another study, Gorgulu Ak\u0131n et al. reported 232 platin desensitizations in 72 patients (38 carboplatin, 21 oxaliplatin, and 13 cisplatin) with 56 BTRs in 33 patients. They reported that the drug skin test positivity increased the risk of BTRs (OR:5.058, %95 CI:1.371\u201318.665).13\nPatients with diagnosis of lung cancer or MPM were included in this study. Since it was not used in the treatment of thoracic malignancies, there was no oxaliplatin-treated patient in our study. In our study, in agreement with Caiado\u2019s report, previous platin infusions \u226510 courses were found to be an independent risk factor for BTRs (OR:17.641, 95% CI: 1.211\u2013256.971). Although skin test positivity was statistically significantly higher in the BTRpositive group (66.7% vs 27.8%, p = 0.025) in univariate analysis, it could not be defined as a risk factor in multivariate analyses."

            "text": "In conclusion, further studies are needed to evaluate whether the development of HSRs with platins is more frequent in NSCLC patients than SCLC patients. Since skin test positivity was found to be higher in patients who were tested >20 days after initial HSR, repeat ST may be considered after negative skin test results performed in the early period after the initial HSR. The desensitization procedure is not completely risk-free. BTRs during platin desensitizations seem to be at a substantial level. Although most of the BTRs are mild, severe BTRs can also be seen. BTRs may be more severe than initial HSRs in a small number of patients. Epinephrine administration during BTRs was found to be higher in patients who were administered epinephrine during the initial HSRs. In this study, previous platin infusions \u2265 10 courses were defined as an independent risk factor for BTR development. Defining additional risk factors for BTR and identification of patients in the risk group will guide the management of platin HSRs and the determination of appropriate desensitization approaches."

In different studies, skin test positivity was reported to be between 34.8 and 98% with carboplatin and between 0 and 90.9% with cisplatin.8,10\u201312,18\u201320,22,26 One of the reasons for reporting such different results may be the time interval between the initial HSR and ST. Performing ST in the early period after initial HSR may have a risk of false negative results due to anergy. It is recommended to perform skin tests at least 2 weeks after the initial HSR and to repeat ST after a negative result if it is performed during the first 4\u20136 weeks following the initial HSR.24,27\u201329 The skin test reactivity in our study was relatively low compared to some other studies. This is probably due to the short interval between the initial HSR and ST. This period was median 19 (range: 1\u201360) days. In most of the patients (93.9%, 31 of 33), skin tests were performed before the first desensitization course and no repeat skin tests were performed due to the retrospective nature of the study. We consider that the statistically significant increase in the positivity rate in those with time interval between the IR and skin tests >20 days supports our belief. If skin tests performed in the early period were negative, repeat ST may be considered to increase the sensitivity of skin test.\nIn this study, no correlations were found between the initial HSR severity and the skin test positivity compatible with some previous studies.8,10,13,15 However BTR development was statistically significantly higher in patients with positive skin tests (66.7% vs 27.8%, p = 0.025).\nDuring the study period, a total of 105 desensitizations were performed in 47 patients. Around 46.8% (22 of 47) of the patients had 33 BTRs. There was no statistical difference in the frequency or severity of BTRs between cisplatin and carboplatin. In previous studies, 33\u201359% of the patients were reported to have BTR during platin desensitization.6\u20138,10,12\u201315,24\nMost of the patients (72.7%, n = 16) had their first BTR during the first desensitization course. Although the majority of BTRs (57.6%) were mild, 18.2% of the patients had more severe BTRs than the initial HSR. Initial HSR was mild in one of two patients with severe BTR. Epinephrine administration in BTRs was found to be statistically significantly higher in those who were treated with epinephrine in the initial HSR (p = 0.036). Our data showed that the desensitization procedure is generally successful and safe, but not completely risk-free, and that more severe reactions than the intial HSR can be seen in a small number of patients. Therefore, it is important to administer desensitization under appropriate conditions and by experienced allergists.\nRisk factors for BTRs during platin desensitizations have been identified in only a few studies.7,9,13 Caiado et al. reported the outcomes of 1471 desensitizations in 272 patients with different antineoplastics and monoclonal antibodies. One hundred and thirty six of the patients were desensitized to platins (80 oxaliplatin, 49 carboplatin, 7 cisplatin) and had 112 BTRs during 689 desensitizations. A subgroup of platin patients (127 of 136) was further analyzed to investigate risk factors for BTRs and two idependent predictors were identified with multivariate analysis; previous platin infusions \u2265 10 courses (OR:4.11, 95% CI:1.17\u201314.52) and total IgE\n15.
