1. **Incorporate renewable power uncertainties into the reserve requirement selection process.** The paper assumes that the reserve requirement is fixed and determined based on a historical analysis of load and renewable generation data. However, in reality, renewable power generation is uncertain and can vary significantly from day to day. This uncertainty can lead to situations where the reserve requirement is either too high or too low, resulting in either wasted resources or insufficient reserves to meet demand. Future research could explore methods for incorporating renewable power uncertainties into the reserve requirement selection process, in order to ensure that the reserve requirement is always adequate to meet demand while also minimizing the cost of providing reserves.


2. **Develop new market mechanisms for the procurement of energy and reserve that are more efficient and effective.** The paper proposes a new market mechanism for the procurement of energy and reserve that is based on a rolling-window optimization approach. This mechanism has several advantages over traditional market mechanisms, such as the ability to handle uncertainty and the ability to provide dispatch-following incentives to generators. However, there is still room for improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of this market mechanism. Future research could explore new market mechanisms that build on the work of this paper, in order to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the energy and reserve markets.


3. **Investigate the impacts of the proposed market mechanism on the behavior of generators and consumers.** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed market mechanism and shows that it has several desirable properties, such as dispatch-following incentives and cost recovery for generators. However, it is important to also investigate the impacts of the proposed market mechanism on the behavior of generators and consumers in practice. Future research could conduct empirical studies to examine how the proposed market mechanism affects the bidding behavior of generators, the investment decisions of generators, and the consumption patterns of consumers.


4. **Extend the proposed market mechanism to other regions and countries.** The paper focuses on the application of the proposed market mechanism to a single region. However, it is important to also investigate the applicability of the proposed market mechanism to other regions and countries. Future research could explore the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing the proposed market mechanism in different regions and countries, and could also develop modifications to the proposed market mechanism that make it more suitable for different regions and countries.


5. **Develop new methods for forecasting load and renewable generation.** The accuracy of the load and renewable generation forecasts is critical to the effective operation of the energy and reserve markets. However, forecasting load and renewable generation is a challenging task, due to the inherent uncertainty of these variables. Future research could explore new methods for forecasting load and renewable generation that are more accurate and reliable. These new methods could be used to improve the performance of the proposed market mechanism and could also be used to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the energy and reserve markets.
