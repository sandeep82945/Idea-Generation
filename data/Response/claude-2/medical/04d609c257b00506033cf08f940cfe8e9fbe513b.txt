 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the hybrid virtual/in-person hospital-at-home model to traditional inpatient hospitalization. This could provide valuable data on the financial viability and savings potential of scaling up hospital-at-home programs.

2. Explore the patient experience and satisfaction with the hospital-at-home model, especially comparing urban versus rural patients. Qualitative data could identify areas for improvement.  

3. Evaluate clinical outcomes in higher risk patient populations like those requiring intensive care or complex medical management. This could expand the types of patients eligible for hospital-at-home.

4. Examine the impact of hospital-at-home on reducing healthcare disparities and improving access for rural and underserved communities. Both quantitative and qualitative data could be collected.

5. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing hospital-at-home to inpatient hospitalization for specific conditions. This would provide high-quality evidence on clinical outcomes like mortality, readmissions, patient recovery/function.
