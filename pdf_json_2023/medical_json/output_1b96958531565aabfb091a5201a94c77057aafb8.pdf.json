MFEIT image sequences were obtained according to certain imaging algorithms, and the area ratio of the ROI (AR_ROI) and the mean value of the reconstructed resistivity change of the ROI (MVRRC_ROI) on both the left and right sides of these images were extracted. The geometric asymmetry index (GAI) and intensity asymmetry index (IAI) were further proposed to characterize the symmetry of MFEIT images based on the extracted indices and to statistically compare and analyze the differences between the two groups of subjects on MFEIT images.\nResults: There were no significant differences in either the AR_ROI or the MVRRC_ROI between the two sides of the brains of healthy volunteers (p > 0.05); some of the MFEIT images mainly in the range of 30 kHz \u2013 60 kHz of patients with brain diseases showed stronger resistivity distributions (larger area or stronger signal) that were approximately symmetric with the location of the lesions. However, statistical analysis showed that the AR_ROI and the MVRRC_ROI on the healthy sides of MFEIT images of patients with unilateral brain disease were not significantly different from those on the affected side (p > 0.05). The GAI and IAI were higher in all patients with brain diseases than in healthy volunteers except for 80 kHz (p < 0.05).\nConclusion: There were significant differences in the geometric symmetry and the signal intensity symmetry of the reconstructed targets in the MFEIT images between healthy volunteers and patients with brain diseases, and the above findings provide a reference for the rapid detection of intracranial abnormalities using MFEIT images and may provide a basis for further exploration of MFEIT for the detection of brain diseases.\nKEYWORDS\ncerebral, MFEIT, image features, area and signal intensity of ROI, symmetry, intracranial abnormality, detection"

            "text": "Most brain diseases have extremely high rates of death and disability (1, 2). Some brain diseases, such as stroke, have an abrupt onset and rapid progression. There are some advanced diagnostic techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, CT and MRI cannot meet some urgent clinical needs, such as the monitoring and early detection of an intraoperative brain injury, real-time monitoring and assessment of intracranial conditions of patients with critical brain diseases, or dynamic evaluation of the effects of drugs for cerebral edema treatment, due to their large size, high costs and risk of radiation exposure. Therefore, an imaging technology that is portable has high sensitivity in detecting intracranial conditions and can dynamically and continuously acquire brain imaging data from patients at the bedside in real time is urgently needed to help doctors make early diagnoses and take timely measures to not only save patients\u2019 lives but also greatly improve the prognosis of patients with brain diseases.\nThe special anatomy of the brain makes it a world-class challenge to investigate technologies suitable for the detection and continuous monitoring of brain diseases. However, current imaging technologies are deficient in terms of practical applications. For example, although ultrasound imaging techniques can theoretically reflect the occurrence of brain diseases, ultrasound cannot penetrate the skull, and ultrasonography is only applicable for infants with unclosed skulls (3), while for adults, the ultrasound probe can only be\u00a0placed on the skull bone suture to detect nearby intracranial conditions, and this technique can only detect a limited range of brain lesions. In addition, NIR spectroscopic imaging techniques can be\u00a0used to identify cerebral lesions by applying certain wavelengths of NIR light to the surface of the human head and using the abnormal intensity of reflection according to the different absorption rates of NIR light by different brain tissues. However, the NIR optical signal attenuates with increasing depth into the skull (4) and generally has good detection ability for tissues within 1\u20132 cm under the skull (5); the deepest detection range is up to 4 cm below the skull (6), which is not suitable to the detection of deep brain lesions.\nElectrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a novel medical imaging technique that is based on the principle of applying a certain safe excitation current to the human surface while measuring the body surface voltage and then reconstructing the image according to a specific imaging algorithm. Moreover, EIT is advantageous in that it is noninvasive, used in functional imaging, does not use radiation, and uses a small, portable device, which has great potential and application in the rapid detection of intracranial conditions in patients with brain diseases. In 2013, a researcher reported the feasibility of using EIT to monitor intracranial electrical impedance changes in humans (7). The EIT technique in this report is time-differential EIT (tdEIT), which reflects the change in the resistivity distribution of the measured cranial brain at a point in time relative to the resistivity distribution at a reference point in time. This algorithm is fast and greatly reduces systematic and measurement errors in the data by the time difference. However, the shortcoming of tdEIT is that in practice, it is difficult to obtain reference data corresponding to the time before disease onset, so it is not suitable for situations where lesions have formed and do not change over a short time. Therefore, there is a need for a one-time brain EIT imaging technique that can reflect the absolute intracranial condition and examine the intracranial promptly during the patient\nmonitoring period so that the progression of brain disease can be\u00a0assessed dynamically.\nIt has been found that static EIT, symmetric imaging and multifrequency EIT(MFEIT) techniques are currently suitable for one-time cerebral EIT imaging. The static EIT technique reconstructs the absolute value of the resistivity distribution within the subject and may provide more complete and reliable information, but the impact of its model error and measurement noise on the quality of the reconstructed image is particularly severe. As a result, the static imaging algorithm has extremely strict requirements for data quality and electrode position, which, together with the long imaging time of this algorithm, is highly limited in clinical applications. Most of the current research on this technology is focused on breast and lung imaging, mainly for optimization of imaging quality and improvement of imaging speed, basically at the stage of numerical simulation studies and physical model studies (8\u201310), and individual studies have imaged the human chest and lungs (11, 12). Due to the complex anatomy of the human head and the high resistivity of the skull, the imaging results of the static EIT technique in the human brain have not been reported.\nSymmetrical imaging is an EIT imaging technique designed in a specific application scenario of the human brain in which it is assumed that the resistivity distribution of the healthy human brain is approximately left\u2013right symmetric, that brain lesions are usually located unilaterally or that bilateral lesions of the brain cannot be\u00a0 completely symmetric and that lesions will break the original symmetry of the resistivity distribution of the healthy human brain. Based on this assumption, in 2014, an investigator proposed a symmetrical EIT (Symmetrical EIT, SEIT) method, which implemented imaging of simulated brain lesions on an ideally symmetric brain simulation model and a physical model of the brain (13), but the imaging results of this method on the human brain have not been reported because its assumption only holds on the human brain with inherently good impedance symmetry. In 2018, a similar symmetry imaging method called \u201cSdEIT\u201d was reported, and its feasibility was verified on simulation and physical models (14). In 2019, a dual-frequency SdEIT method was reported, and its application scope and requirements were studied based on the measured data of patients with brain diseases. The results showed that the method had high requirements for the impedance symmetry of the human brain and the symmetry of the electrode position (15), and the conditions for its practical application are demanding. The asymmetry of the human brain itself and the asymmetry of the measurements limit the practical application of symmetric electrical impedance imaging, and no imaging results of such methods on bulk human brains have been seen.\nMFEIT, also named \u201cfrequency-difference EIT (fdEIT),\u201d reflects the variation in the resistivity distribution inside the subject with frequency based on the differential components of the EIT data at two different frequency points of the subject, and similar to temporal differential imaging, the frequency differential can greatly reduce the influence of systematic and measurement errors in the data. In addition, because there are large differences in the impedance spectra between normal human brain tissues and diseased brain tissue in specific frequency bands, it is possible to reflect the intracranial condition (whether it has occurred and the location of the lesion, etc.) of patients with brain diseases by MFEIT in specific frequency bands. In 2006, the UK UCL research team reported an MFEIT system for\nFrontiers in Neurology 03 frontiersin.org\ndetecting brain lesions (16) and obtained the frequency difference imaging results of simulated brain lesions on the human brain physical model. In 2012, the group compared the results of five fdEIT imaging algorithms on a phantom of the human brain and hypothesized that the weighted fdEIT is expected to be\u00a0used for imaging lesions in the human brain (17). In 2014, the group proposed a spectrally constrained MFEIT algorithm for differentiating the types of stroke lesions and imaged them on a simulation model of the human brain, but the imaging results were easily affected by electrode errors and errors in the shape of measured objects (18). In 2016, the group reduced the impact of electrode model error on the imaging quality of multifrequency EIT by reconstructing the conductivity spectrum and the positions of electrodes simultaneously (19). In the same year, another group reported a spectral decomposition fdEIT algorithm and imaged simulated stroke lesions on a phantom of the human brain (20). However, the imaging results of MFEIT in the human brain have not yet been reported, and the differences in cerebral MFEIT images between healthy individuals and patients with brain diseases have not been reported, which limits the application of MFEIT in imaging the human brain.\nIn this study, cerebral MFEIT data from a group of healthy volunteers and a group of patients with brain diseases were collected and subjected to frequency-difference imaging, and the symmetry of cerebral MFEIT images was analyzed to summarize the differences in the characteristics of those images between healthy individuals and patients with brain diseases, laying the foundation for the establishment of a rapid assessment method for intracranial abnormalities based on cerebral MFEIT images."

The driving current applied to the subjects\u2019 heads was a sinusoidal alternating current with a root mean square value of 176 \u03bcA. The opposite excitation-adjacent measurement mode was adopted to decide the electrode pair (e.g., 5\u201313) excited by the current and the corresponding electrode pairs (e.g., 6\u20137, 7\u20138, 8\u20139, 9\u201310, 10\u201311, 11\u201312, 14\u201315, 15\u20130, 0\u20131, 1\u20132, 2\u20133, 3\u20134) to measure the boundary voltages that form the EIT data after the current excites all the opposite electrode pairs.\nCerebral EIT data collection from healthy volunteers was performed in a dedicated laboratory with temperature controlled at 24 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and 52% \u00b1 1% humidity in 2022. The subjects were lying in the horizontal position with 16 electrodes placed equidistantly on their scalp, and then the EH-300 was used to detect the electrode contact impedance to determine whether the electrodes were making good contact, and the electrodes with poor contact were adjusted until the contact impedance of all electrodes was below the limit of 350 ohms. After the electrodes were applied, the MFEIT data of the subjects\u2019 brains were collected (as shown in Figure\u00a02). Two frequency cycles were acquired."

            "text": "Brain diseases such as stroke and brain injury have high mortality and disability rates. Cerebral edema secondary to cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia and brain injury often leads to increased intracranial pressure, and high intracranial pressure can easily induce lifethreatening conditions such as brain herniation (22). These intracranial conditions develop rapidly, so it is necessary to assess the patient\u2019s intracranial condition in time to adjust the diagnosis and treatment strategy accordingly. EIT technology is advantageous in that it is noninvasive, harmless and allows continuous measurement of brain parameters. Based on the differences in the dielectric properties of different brain tissues, EIT data are selected for differential imaging in the frequency band where the resistivity spectrum of brain lesions differs from that of normal brain tissues, and the imaging results reflect the change in resistivity of brain tissues in each region with respect to frequency (20). The advantage of frequency-differential EIT over temporal differential EIT is that the former can reflect intracranial abnormalities in a one-time imaging manner without a reference EIT data corresponding to the time before the onset of brain diseases, which is helpful to obtain the patient\u2019s intracranial condition in time. The electrical impedance group of UCL University (18, 23\u201325) and the electrical impedance group of the Fourth Military Medical University in China (26, 27) have conducted in depth studies of cerebral MFEIT, and the research strategy of selecting frequency bands of fdEIT based\non the dielectric properties of biological tissues has been proven successful through physical and animal model studies (17). However, studies on the characteristics of fdEIT images and the differences in those characteristics between healthy subjects and patients with brain diseases have not been reported. For this reason, we\u00a0explored the use of fdEIT imaging with measured cerebral MFEIT data from healthy volunteers and patients with brain diseases in the range of commonly measured EIT frequencies and investigated the characteristics and differences in imaging results between the two groups of subjects.\nIn this study, we\u00a0 performed MFEIT imaging on 16 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with brain diseases. From the MFEIT images of the human brain, the images of the healthy subjects are approximately left\u2013right symmetric, which is consistent with the left\u2013right approximate symmetry of the variations in resistivity of the normal brain tissues on both sides, and two stronger resistivity distribution regions approximately symmetric about the left\u2013right symmetry axis can be\u00a0observed within the posterior regions of the MFEIT images of the healthy human brain. This is similar to the results of MIT imaging of the healthy human brain reported by a Russian research group (28), see Figure\u00a07 in the literature. It is clear from the analysis of the anatomical images of the human brain in the coronal and sagittal planes that in the posterior part of the temporal lobe, the horizontal width and the lead thickness of the brain tissue will reach a maximum, as shown in Figure\u00a012 below, with the horizontal width maximum marked by the red arrow and the lead thickness maximum marked by the black dashed line. The horizontal width maximum and the lead thickness maximum are marked on the EIT image of one healthy volunteer according to the same geometric scale, and the two marking lines fall just in the area of stronger resistivity change on the EIT image, as shown in the right part of Figure\u00a012. Thus, the larger spatial volume distribution of brain tissue in the posterior temporal lobe may be\u00a0the reason for the two approximately left\u2013right symmetrical distributions of stronger resistivity changes in the posterior part on the EIT images of the healthy human brain. On the contrary, the reconstructed images of the 8 patients were not as symmetrical as that of the healthy subjects. We\u00a0selected a CT or MRI slice with the largest lesion size each for one patient to display the patient\u2019s intracranial condition, even if the lesion is not in the electrode plane of EIT. The reason for this choice is that EIT does not just display resistivity distribution of the plane where the electrodes are located. It displays the projection of the distribution of electrical resistivity changes in the three-dimensional space of the measured head on the 2D plane. Under the current electrode configuration, even if the lesion is not on the electrode plane, it will still affect the distribution of electric fields applied to the measured head by EIT and can still be\u00a0reconstructed by EIT.\nFIGURE\u00a05 Cerebral MFEIT imaging results of a healthy volunteer (30 kHz-100 kHz).\nFrontiers in Neurology 08 frontiersin.org\nAs seen in the results of this study, the GAI and IAI of cerebral MFEIT images of the healthy subjects were significantly lower than those of the patients with brain diseases at the frequency range of 30 kHz-100 kHz, suggesting that the symmetry of MFEIT images in this frequency band could potentially be\u00a0 used for the rapid determination of abnormal intracranial conditions. Further analysis of the incidence of positive events in cerebral MFEIT images of the patients with brain diseases (especially with cerebral hemorrhage) shows that the resistivity change of the lesion region with the frequency was weaker than that of normal brain tissue in the contralateral region that was near-symmetrical to the lesion in the range of 30 kHz\u00a0- 60 kHz. The dielectric properties of stroke lesions\nFIGURE\u00a06 Cerebral MFEIT imaging results of the patients (P1 \u2013 P8) with brain diseases (30 kHz-100 kHz). The red box corresponds to the observed high electrical resistivity changes in the symmetrical area on the opposite side of the patient\u2019s lesion.\nFrontiers in Neurology 09 frontiersin.org\nand normal brain tissue were reported in the literature in 2016 (29) (see Figure\u00a04 in the literature). The amount of variation in the real part of the electrical impedance of each tissue with frequency in descending order in the range of 1 kHz-100 kHz is brain white matter > ischemic brain tissue > brain gray matter >hemorrhagic tissue. In the framework of the current fdEIT algorithm, whether the biological tissue in a certain cerebral region is imaged depends on the comparison of the impedance change with the frequency of the biological tissue in the region with that in the adjacent region: when there is a large change in impedance with the frequency of a certain tissue, the image of this tissue will be\u00a0reconstructed with a larger area or a stronger signal intensity. In the patients with an intracranial hematoma in this study, the rate of electrical impedance change with the frequency of normal brain tissue was higher than that of the hemorrhagic lesion in the selected frequency band for fdEIT, so a stronger resistivity change distribution was presented in the contralateral area of the hemorrhagic lesion. It is known from the electrical impedance spectrum of biological tissues that the resistivity\nvariation with frequency of healthy brain tissue is higher than that of brain lesions in the frequency range of EIT imaging in this study, the fdEIT image of the patient (e.g., Figure\u00a06, row 4) showed a higher resistivity change on normal brain tissue in the contralateral region that was near-symmetrical to the lesion than that on the lesion side, which was different from the image performance on one side of a healthy volunteer. The rate of electrical impedance change with the frequency of biological tissues in the brain is a key factor in determining whether a certain tissue can be\u00a0reflected by the fdEIT algorithm used in this study. Biological tissues with a larger rate of electrical impedance change with frequency will be\u00a0reflected by the fdEIT in preference to the tissues with a smaller rate, presenting reconstructed targets in their corresponding locations of the image with a larger area or stronger intensity. The above experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the current MFEIT for detecting intracranial abnormalities.\nIn addition, according to the dielectric properties of rabbit brain tissues and stroke tissues reported in the literature, the amount of resistivity variation with frequency is greater in ischemic tissue than in normal brain tissue and blood in the lower frequency band (DC-500 Hz) (30), while in the higher frequency band (200 kHz-1 MHz), the amount of resistivity variation with frequency is greater in blood than in normal brain tissues and ischemic brain tissue (29), Therefore, in the future, this study will broaden the measurement frequency range of the MFEIT system to allow a wider range of MFEIT measurements and imaging covering the above frequencies, thus enabling MFEIT to detect cerebral ischemia in the low frequency band and cerebral hemorrhage in the high frequency band and to show higher resistivity changes at the location corresponding to the lesions. This approach will allow a more visual representation of the presence and development of intracranial abnormalities.\nIn the observation of cerebral MFEIT images of each patient, we\u00a0found that there was a stronger resistivity change area on the normal side of the patient and the area approximately symmetrical with the patient\u2019s lesion about the axis of symmetry of the coronal plane of the brain. However, statistical analysis did not find a difference in the ROI area or ROI signal intensity between the affected sides and the normal sides of the patients. The possible reason is that the difference between normal brain tissue and lesions in the reconstruction resistivity changes on the fdEIT images of these frequencies is small. Although the number of patients in the present study is small, in future research, more patients with brain diseases can be\u00a0recruited to participate in cerebral MFEIT imaging experiments to further support the rule mentioned above. There has been some progress in image feature recognition in AI technology (31, 32). Zhang Tao summarized the application progress of depth learning in EIT image reconstruction from three aspects: single network reconstruction, depth learning combined with traditional algorithm reconstruction, and multi-network hybrid reconstruction (33). In general, AI technology provides a new method to improve the performance of EIT image reconstruction. In the future, to ensure that sufficient cerebral MFEIT images of patients with brain diseases are available, researchers can use artificial intelligence technology such as an artificial neural network (ANN) or support vector machine (SVM) to identify the affected side and the healthy side of the patient\u2019s brain based on MFEIT images and estimate the location of the lesions.\nFIGURE\u00a07 Area ratio of the ROIs of the healthy volunteers and the patients with brain diseases. The ARRs of the affected group and the healthy group correspond to the ROIs on the affected sides and normal sides of the patients, respectively. The left group and the right group of ARRs correspond to the ROIs on the left sides and right sides of the healthy volunteers, respectively. Black dots are outliers.\nFIGURE\u00a08 Signal intensity of the ROIs of the healthy volunteers and the patients with brain diseases.

Black dots are outliers.\nFrontiers in Neurology 10 frontiersin.org\nThe method of detecting intracranial abnormalities based on the symmetry of MFEIT images proposed in this study may have two benefits. The first benefit is that healthy people in the community or grassroots clinics can be\u00a0 screened to identify potential brain diseases at an early stage for effective measures to be\u00a0taken that may reduce the occurrence of brain diseases. In this regard, we\u00a0have encountered a typical case. A staff member of Daping Hospital of Army Medical University (male, 44 years old) asked us for help during the period we\u00a0carried out cerebral\nMFEIT data collection on healthy volunteers. He\u00a0reported that he\u00a0had frequent pain in the right side of the brain and wanted to have a look at the brain through MFEIT. We\u00a0 conducted a standard MFEIT data acquisition procedure for him according to the experimental protocol in this paper and found that the MFEIT images of his brain were asymmetric compared with the normal subjects, and the area of the ROI reconstructed on the right side of each image was smaller than that on the left side (as shown in Figure\u00a013). Based on this result, we\u00a0estimated that there might be\u00a0 abnormalities in the right brain of this person. We\u00a0 suggested further brain imaging examination. Brain CT showed that the subject had a strip of high-density shadow on the right side of the suprasellar area. Cerebral angiography (CTA) showed that there were abnormalities on the right side of the subject\u2019s brain: tortuous C7 segment of the right internal carotid artery and right embryonic posterior cerebral artery. After inquiry, the subject was found to be\u00a0addicted to alcohol and prone to excitement. We\u00a0 suggest that he\u00a0 reduce alcohol consumption, control emotions, and monitor blood pressure to prevent brain diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage that may occur in the later stage. The second benefit is that MFEIT can be\u00a0used to continuously collect data during the monitoring of critical neurosurgical patients and evaluate the intracranial abnormalities of such patients in real time based on changes in the symmetry of the obtained MFEIT images, thereby possibly preventing the occurrence of secondary cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral hernia and other emergencies.\nThere are several limitations of this study that need to be\u00a0noted. First, this study was an exploratory study, so the number of patients recruited was relatively small, and second, the patients recruited in this study were at different stages of morbidity. In future studies, more precise detection of intracranial conditions, such as accurate localization of lesions and identification of lesion types, will require optimization of the clinical protocol and grouping of subjects according to different types of brain diseases, different stages of the diseases (i.e., different times from the onset of the diseases), and different lesion locations. Third, the EIT imaging is two-dimensional, and a two-dimensional EIT image reflects the projection of the three-dimensional resistivity changes of the measured object on the two-dimensional plane, so the spatial resolution of 2D EIT is difficult to be\u00a0defined. Therefore, the spatial resolution of 2D EIT image is not evaluated at present. In future research, we\u00a0will use a 3D EIT with higher spatial resolution to reflect intracranial abnormalities of the measured object. And the spatial resolution of 3D EIT image will be\u00a0evaluated accurately. Four, the main purpose of the study is to explore detection of intracranial abnormalities based on the difference in the symmetry of multi-frequency EIT images between healthy volunteers and patients with brain diseases, so we\u00a0 have not yet evaluated the performance of fdEIT in detecting lesion size. However, in our previous tdEIT imaging research, it was found that the similar EIT system could detect resistivity disturbances that account for 0.35% of the total volume of the imaged target (34). In further studies, after accumulating a large amount of patient data, we\u00a0may be\u00a0able to establish the relationship between the size of reconstruction targets on fdEIT images and the lesion size evaluated by CT of MRI. Then fdEIT will be\u00a0 a useful tool to detect intracranial conditions.\nFIGURE\u00a09 Positive rates of AR_ROI and SI.\nFIGURE\u00a010 Geometric asymmetry index for the healthy volunteers and the patients with brain diseases.
