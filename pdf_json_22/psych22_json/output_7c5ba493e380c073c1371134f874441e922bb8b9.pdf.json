            "text": "Trauma-informed practice has been advocated in schools as a way to support teachers in understanding the nature and consequences of trauma and in building emotionally healthy classroom environments (Overstreet & Chafouleas, 2016; SAMHSA, 2014). It is a strengths-based approach that builds knowledge of the pervasive biological, psychological and social consequences of trauma with the ultimate aim of ameliorating, rather than exacerbating, their effects (Harris & Fallot, 2001; SAMHSA, 2014). Trauma-informed approaches provide a contextual understanding of the children\u2019s behaviors, recognizing them as survival strategies rather than manifestations of disorder or deficit. While there are a variety of trauma-informed approaches, frameworks and strategies, the core underlying principles have been identified as safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, choice and empowerment, peer support, cultural humility and respect for diversity (Harris & Fallot, 2001; SAMHSA, 2014). Increasingly, trauma-informed approaches are recognized as important in mitigating the negative impact of trauma and promoting the growth and success of all students, but especially those affected by trauma (Brunzell et al., 2016; Dorado et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2021).\nWhilst implementing trauma-informed practice involves changes to school systems as a whole, teachers\u2019 attitudes toward trauma-informed practice and their psychosocial competencies, are thought to be important drivers of the day-to-day and moment-to-moment interactions that determine the extent to which the school operates in a traumainformed way (Baker et al., 2016; Metz et al., 2007). For instance, teachers with positive attitudes toward traumainformed care are more likely to view each student as being affected in some way by their experience (rather than viewing their behavior as inherently oppositional or defiant) and to respond to students with compassionate and empathy (Thomas et al., 2019).\nIn addition to shifting attitudes and enhancing knowledge, trauma-informed approaches also emphasize self-care for educators. Self-care in this context involves paying specific attention to the health and wellbeing of teachers and other school staff and acknowledging that supporting adversity-affected students can be a source of amplified teacher stress (Kim et al., 2021)."

            "heading": "Teacher Stress and Burnout",
            "text": "Figley (1995) and Maslach (2003a) observed that there is a cost to caring for helping professionals, and this cost is increasingly evident amongst education staff as many countries report high levels of teacher stress (Education Support, 2019; Foley & Murphy, 2015; Montgomery & Rupp, 2005). Frequently, the risks that teachers face to their professional quality of life are described as burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious or secondary traumatization. Stamm (2010, 2012) observed that professional quality of life incorporates significant risks (compassion fatigue) as well as considerable benefits (compassion satisfaction).\nCompassion fatigue is the product of bearing witness to the suffering of others resulting in a reduced ability or capacity to be present with others, and feelings of powerlessness, isolation, and confusion (Figley, 2002). Stamm ( 2010) conceptualizes compassion fatigue as consisting of two elements: burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Burnout entails physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and decreased sense of efficacy. It is typically caused by the chronic strain that results from insufficient resources and excessive demands or incongruence between individuals and the work they do (Maslach, 2003b). Secondary traumatic stress occurs when teachers who have direct contact with children\u2019s traumatic stories, exhibit responses similar to those who have experienced trauma first-hand. These responses might include, re-experiencing the trauma through dreams, recollections, and/or flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma through detachment from others, and heightened/persistent arousal evident by difficulty sleeping, becoming irritable or being hyper-vigilant (Figley, 2002). Secondary traumatic stress and burnout are more common when teachers have their own personal experience of trauma, when the demands of work exceed available resources, and when there are feelings of having little control over the quality of services provided (Caringi et al., 2015). Experiencing stress and burnout is obviously distressing for teachers themselves, and it is predictive of negative outcomes for students (Oberle & Schonert-Reichl, 2016).\nFigley & Stamm (1996) noted that the key to preventing compassion fatigue lies in professionals detecting and reinforcing the sense of satisfaction they derive from working with clients/students. Stamm (2010) uses the term compassion satisfaction to refer to the positive and protective emotional state that one achieves through helping others and feeling success in one\u2019s job. According to Stamm it is \u201cthe pleasure you derive from being able to do your work well\u201d (2010, p. 2). Thus, to remain effective and vital in their work, teachers must be able to recognize and find joy in their caring role. Whilst the construct of compassion has\n1 3\n124\nJournal of Child & Adolescent Trauma (2023) 16:123\u2013133\nbeen frequently overlooked, there is now growing interest in exploring the role of compassion in professional practice."

XXV). It has been identified as a promising construct for frontline professionals in terms of its ability to promote psychological wellbeing, as well as increase sensitivity to detect, tolerate and respond to distress in others (Gilbert et al., 2011). Self-compassion entails turning toward our own experience - even when it is painful - and extending understanding, warmth and kindness to oneself (Neff & Germer, 2018). Extending compassion towards ourselves in this way inclines us toward being more giving, caring and supportive in our relationships with others (Gilbert & Choden, 2015).\nNeff (2003) conceptualized self-compassion along three dimensions: self-kindness (versus self-judgment), which is the intentional act of extending warmth and understanding when we suffer, fail, or feel inadequate; common humanity (versus isolation), which is about honoring the unavoidable fact that life involves suffering for everyone, without exception; and mindfulness (versus over-identified), defined as being aware of moment-to-moment experience, without judgement. Self-compassion is positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness, optimism, positive affect, wisdom, personal initiative, curiosity, and exploration and negatively associated with depression, anxiety, negative affect, rumination, and thought suppression (Neff, 2003; Neff et al., 2009).\nResearch with teachers has shown that self-compassion reduces psychological distress and burnout and enhances teachers\u2019 ability to create and maintain optimal classroom environments (Dave et al., 2020; Flook et al., 2013; Jennings, 2014). However, despite the importance of compassion in engaging with the distress, at present, little is known about the role that self-compassion plays in teachers\u2019 attitudes toward trauma-informed practice, nor their overall sense of professional wellbeing."

            "text": "In recent years, educational policy in Ireland has placed a strong emphasis on whole-school wellbeing promotion and on continuum of support models, which makes provision for both universal and targeted approaches in recognition that children have different needs at different times (Department of Education and Skills, 2019; National Educational Psychological Service, 2007). However, whilst there is growing consensus internationally of the need for trauma-informed\napproaches in education and other human services sectors, no policy exists in Ireland that explicitly addresses childhood adversity or offers guidance for organizations on responding to the needs of traumatized children (Prevention and Early Intervention Network, 2019).\nDespite the absence of explicit policies and resources in the area, many education professionals have recognized the need within their own schools and have begun researching and implementing trauma-informed approaches of their own volition. Several continuing professional development courses have been made available in response to demand from educators, and a pilot Nurture Schools project was launched in 2020 across a network of schools (Educate Together Nurture Schools Project). Thus, the impetus for trauma-informed approaches in Ireland is emerging in an organic, bottom-up fashion, as practitioners seek ways to respond to the strengths and needs within their own school communities. However, because these bottom-up changes have not, thus far, been met by a top-down commitment in legislation, policy or resourcing, efforts to embed traumainformed approaches are fragmented and largely based on the commitment and resourcefulness of individual school leaders. Overall awareness of trauma-informed approaches across the education sector remains limited. Furthermore, whilst there have been some studies of teacher stress in Ireland (Darmondy & Smyth, 2011; Foley & Murphy 2015; INTO, 2015), there is a gap in research on teacher quality of life and compassion within the Irish context."

It sought to investigate whether compassion mediates the experience of burnout and secondary-traumatic stress, and contributes to a willingness to engage with, and respond to, student distress as would be required by trauma-informed approaches. Teachers completed the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL), which measures secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and compassion satisfaction, as well as the Self-Compassion Scale and the Attitudes and Readiness for Trauma-Informed Care (ARTIC) Scale. They also provided personal details (gender, age, experience) and school characteristics (sector, geographical location, socio-demographic profile). We hypothesized that teachers would demonstrate broadly positive attitudes toward trauma-informed practice and that higher self-compassion and compassion satisfaction would be associated with more positive views of trauma-informed practice.\n1 3\n125\nJournal of Child & Adolescent Trauma (2023) 16:123\u2013133\nschools in Ireland close on March 12th 2020 for the remainder of the academic year; the vast majority (98%) of participants had responded prior to this."

The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL5) is a 30-item scale, which prompts participants to reflect on relationships and compassion towards people they work with. It comprises two constructs: Compassion Satisfaction (CS) and Compassion Fatigue (CF). CS describes the positive aspects of one\u2019s professional role; the degree of pleasure derived from doing your job well. CF describes the negative aspects \u2013 it is comprised of Burnout (BO) and Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). BO is associated with a loss of hope and difficulties carrying out work duties effectively. STS measures exposure to the trauma of others through work. The scale has been used in a variety of contexts internationally and has been psychometrically validated (Stamm, 2010). Cronbach\u2019s alpha levels observed for the current study were CS: 0.91, BO: 0.83, and STS: 0.82.\nThe Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) is a 26-item questionnaire that provides an overall self-compassion score and six subscale scores.

            "text": "Mean scores for each of the three measures employed in the study are displayed in Table 2. On the ProQOL5, participants scored highly on the Compassion Satisfaction subscale, which indicates they tend to find meaning and purpose in their work. Fewer than 2% (n = 7) of participants scored within the low range on this measure (see Fig. 1). On the Burnout subscale, nearly three-quarters of participants (73.5%, n = 277) reported moderate levels, around a quarter (26.3%, n = 99) reported low levels, and just one participant (0.3%) reported a high level of burnout. About half of participants (49.1%, n = 185) reported low levels of Secondary Traumatic Stress, with the other half (50.7%, n = 191) reporting moderate levels, and one participant (0.3%, n = 1) reporting a high level.\nOn the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), nearly two-thirds of participants (60.8%, n = 228) scored between 2.5 and 3.5, which is considered the moderate range. Sixty-three participants (16.7%) were low in self-compassion, and 22.3%\nstudy were: SCS total 0.91, self-kindness 0.80, self-judgement 0.79, common humanity 0.76, isolation 0.77, mindfulness 0.71 and overidentification 0.72.\nThe Attitudes Related to Trauma-Informed Care (ARTIC35) was used to measure participants\u2019 attitudes towards trauma-informed care in relation to their work. This 35-item scale can be used in educational settings that have not yet implemented trauma-informed approaches. The language is adjusted to suit the context, such that the term student is used rather than client. The measure uses a 7-point scale in between two contrasting statements, and participants are asked to indicate where they would place themselves on this continuum. It consists of five subscales, these are:\n127\n4 includes Professional Quality of Life scores. This final model with all variables included explains 34.2% of the variance in ARTIC-35 scores. About half of this is explained by the addition of the three ProQOL subscales (Model 4 in Table 4). In the final model (Table 5), age remains a significant predictor, with older teachers showing more positive attitudes, and teaching in a single-sex boys\u2019 school predicted less favorable attitudes. Further, self-compassion and compassion satisfaction were strong predictors of more positive attitudes toward trauma-informed care."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The results show that in general, teachers display an orientation towards their students and towards themselves that is conducive to trauma-informed practice. Positive dispositions were evident across all five subscales of the ARTIC and the total score. Overall, teachers had moderate levels of self-compassion. They exhibited low to moderate levels of secondary traumatic stress and burnout, and notably high levels of compassion satisfaction, indicating that they tend to embrace their caring role and find meaning and purpose\n(n = 84) reported high self-compassion scores. A breakdown of scores across the six subscales is presented in Fig. 2. The average score on the ARTIC-35 was 5.01 (SD = 0.65). This constitutes a score above the mid-point of 4, indicating favorable attitudes towards trauma-informed care.\nAs displayed in Table 3 all three measures were correlated. There was a strong positive correlation between the ARTIC and Compassion Satisfaction (0.53). High ARTIC35 scores are associated with lower Burnout (-0.41) and lower Secondary Traumatic Stress scores (-0.20). There was also a positive correlation (0.31) between the ARTIC and the SCS.\nA hierarchical regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between demographic variables, professional quality of life, self-compassion, and attitudes to trauma-informed care. Variables are entered stepwise to allow for a comparison of the unique contribution and mediating effects of different blocks of variables. In model 1, gender and age were entered into the model to ascertain the extent to which these variables can predict ARTIC35 scores. In model 2, school characteristics were added. Model 3 includes self-compassion scores, and finally, model\n1 3\nJournal of Child & Adolescent Trauma (2023) 16:123\u2013133\naccess to trauma-informed professional development programs. The results suggest a need for greater awareness of trauma-informed practice and enhanced capacity building in the Irish context. They also suggest that these measures would be positively received, given teachers\u2019 self-reported capacities and dispositions.\nThe relationship between quality of life, self-compassion, and attitudes towards trauma-informed care were weak to moderate overall but showed a pattern whereby positive attitudes toward trauma-informed care were associated with higher compassion satisfaction and self-compassion, less burnout and less secondary traumatic stress. The compassion constructs (compassion satisfaction and self-compassion) were the most significant predictors of positive attitudes toward trauma-informed practice and remained significant even when other factors were controlled for. These findings correspond with previous research. For instance, Jennings (2015) found that higher levels of teacher self-compassion were associated with greater classroom emotional support. Christian-Brandt et al., (2020) found that high levels of compassion satisfaction were associated with perceived effectiveness of trauma-informed care. Whilst further research is needed to determine causality, these results suggest that compassion plays an important role in teachers\u2019 professional wellbeing and creating optimal environments to support students impacted by trauma.\nThe results also showed some interesting variations on the self-compassion subscales. As noted in the Introduction, self-compassion is comprised of three elements (kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness), each of which has a positive and negative pole (Neff, 2003). This study found that teachers display a healthy tendency toward mindfulness and common humanity, yet extending kindness towards themselves seems harder. Thus, teachers may benefit from having opportunities to engage in experiential compassionbased practices, which could be done informally through teacher-led communities of practice, and/or through more formal and structured programs.\nRegarding demographic and school variables, this study found that gender, the educational role of participants, and school sector (primary or secondary) did not predict attitudes toward trauma-informed care; nor did the disadvantage (DEIS) status or geographical location of the school. However, older teachers were more likely to display positive attitudes toward trauma-informed care, whilst teachers in single-sex boys\u2019 schools held attitudes that were less favorable. Our finding in relation to teachers\u2019 age conflicts with that of Christian-Brandt and colleagues (2020), who found that older teachers displayed less positive views regarding the perceived effectiveness of trauma-informed care. However, our finding corresponds with existing research within the Irish context. The ARTIC assesses the various responses\nin their work. Furthermore, compassion satisfaction was the strongest predictor of positive attitudes toward traumainformed care, followed by self-compassion.\nThe results in relation to compassion satisfaction are generally positive and in line with previous findings demonstrating that an ethic of care and a desire to sustain positive interpersonal relationships are central drivers in teachers\u2019 practices (O\u2019Toole & Simovska, 2021). However, the ARTIC results recorded in this study were lower overall compared to those involving other research participants and in other jurisdictions, including frontline health and social care professionals in Ireland (O\u2019Toole & Dobutowitsch, 2020), educators in the United States (Kim et al., 2021), residential care professionals in Australia (Galvin et al., 2020), and student teachers in Canada (Rodger et al., 2020). All of these studies reported average or median ARTIC scores between 5.08 and 6.10. These findings are perhaps unsurprising considering the lack of acknowledgement of childhood adversity and trauma-informed practice within Irish educational policy landscape. It should be noted however, that meaningful comparison across studies is difficult, since norms/benchmarks for the ARTIC scale are not currently available. In addition, some of the studies mentioned above used the ARTIC to assess attitudes following the provision of professional development training. At the time of data collection for this study, teachers had extremely limited\n1 3\n129\nJournal of Child & Adolescent Trauma (2023) 16:123\u2013133\nof working often without sufficient resources or training. Many teachers in Ireland and elsewhere felt a deep sense of frustration and anger at perceived lack of support from central educational authorities (Kim & Asbury, 2020; O\u2019Toole & Simovska, 2021). The pandemic has also exposed children to unprecedented disruption, and whilst some children may have benefited from increased interactions with parents and siblings during periods of lockdown, many others have experience elevated emotional distress and are at heightened risk for experiencing domestic violence, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and economic hardship (Hamoda et al., 2021; Mahase, 2020; Marmot et al., 2020; United Nations, 2020).\nWith evidence of increased distress and trauma experienced by children during the pandemic, it is clear that a commitment to resourcing trauma-informed approaches in schools is needed now, more than ever. Furthermore, teachers were dealing with the professional and personal impact of the pandemic on their own lives, but also acutely aware of the inequalities and adversities faced by their students, with many remaining devoted to their students during periods of lockdown, sometimes with the cost of increased stress, vulnerability or concern for themselves or their own families (O\u2019Toole & Simovska, 2021). Previous authors have argued that support for teachers is the \u201ccritical missing ingredient\u201d from school trauma-informed efforts (Luthar & Mendes, 2020, p. 153). In future trauma-informed work, it will be essential that teacher wellbeing is prioritized and supported systemically, as it is clear that teacher and student wellbeing are co-dependent and intimately entangled (O\u2019Toole, 2022b).\nThere is a need, therefore, for greater systemic support for nurturing compassion and trauma-informed approaches in education. This might include making provision for compassion-focused practices (as noted above), but it will also be important that compassion and relationship-oriented practices are embedded and embodied within education systems in a holistic way (Treisman, 2017). Senge ( 1990) argues that systems thinking is the conceptual cornerstone of any learning organization. In relation to schools, a systems approach necessitates a whole-school perspective; seeing the dynamic and relational processes, rather than focusing solely on individuals or discrete parts. It means facilitating dialogue to build a shared vision, and taking collective informed and committed actions for change. Senge and colleagues (2019) have developed the Compassionate Systems Framework in Schools, the aim of which is to grow \u201ccompassionate integrity\u201d in students and teachers - fostering awareness of human inter-connectedness; which they argue is vital to human prosperity and even survival, especially in a world grappling with immense environmental, political and socioeconomic challenges.\nand dispositions of educators to students experiencing emotional distress and behavioral difficulties. Previous studies in Ireland have highlighted that responding to students with emotional and behavioral difficulties is one of the biggest concerns of teachers in the early stages of their careers, who are likely to be younger (Clarke et al., 2012; O\u2019Toole & Burke, 2013). This suggests there is a need for greater support for trainee and newly qualified teachers. Whilst the past decade has seen substantial reform in teacher education at all stages of the continuum - from initial teacher education, induction and continuing professional development (Harford & O\u2019Doherty, 2016) - questions remain about how teachers are prepared for the complexity of children\u2019s emotional and behavioral needs (Darmody & Smyth, 2011). To date, behavior management approaches emphasizing external control of children\u2019s behavior through positive and negative consequences have dominated in schools, despite growing calls for more relationship-oriented and restorative approaches, which are more likely to engender supportive learning communities and promote student autonomy (Brophy, 2006; Brummer, 2020).\nResults showed that teachers in single-sex boys\u2019 schools held less positive attitudes toward trauma-informed practice. Previous authors have argued that these schools can reinforce hypermasculine and heteronormative discourses, potentially cultivating a culture of \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019 (Cushman, 2010; Hickey & Mooney, 2018). The attitudes and dispositions required for trauma-informed practice (care, compassion, emotional understanding) are entirely at odds with myths surrounding dominant masculinity (e.g., toughness, dominance, emotional insensitivity). It has been noted that school personnel can be \u2018sucked into\u2019 the prevailing culture of their school. For instance, Burke (2011) describes how staff became tolerant of - and even complicit in - reinforcing dominant masculine norms in one all-boys\u2019 school. Thus, it seems possible that our participants were influenced by the culture that pervades in all-boys\u2019 schools and that this negatively impacted their attitudes toward trauma-informed practice. Additional research is needed to investigate this further. However, it is noteworthy that compared to European counterparts, Ireland has a uniquely high number of gender-segregated school (one-third of all second-level students and 17% of primary-level pupils attend a single-sex schools). The current results reinforce concerns about gender-segregated education in the Irish context.\nThis study found moderate levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress were typical for Irish educators. Data gathering for this study occurred just prior to the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in Ireland. Research has shown that the pandemic has increased the levels of stress for both educators and children. For instance, during lockdowns, teachers were required to rapidly adapt their ways\n1 3\n130\nJournal of Child & Adolescent Trauma (2023) 16:123\u2013133"

It is possible that there is self-selection bias, and that the data reflect the views and attitudes of individuals with an interest in the topic and prior training. However, there are no indicators to suggest that the data are skewed due to a systematic bias. It is also worth noting that the ARTIC is only an indicator of attitudes; it does not assess whether teachers\u2019 behaviors are consistent with their attitudes. Furthermore, the views of individual teachers may not be in concordance with school-wide ethos or values in which they work. Future studies should consider organizational processes of the school as a whole, including the barriers and facilitators to the co-creation, implementation and sustainment of compassion and trauma-informed approaches.\nAcknowledgements Financial support for this study was received from Kildare Children and Young People\u2019s Services Committee.\nFunding Open Access funding provided by the IReL Consortium\n1 3\n131\nJournal of Child & Adolescent Trauma (2023) 16:123\u2013133\nFoley, C., & Murphy, M.
