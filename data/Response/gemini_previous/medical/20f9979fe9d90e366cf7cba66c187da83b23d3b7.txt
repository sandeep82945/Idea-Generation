1. **Investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on stroke outcomes.** The study only looked at in-hospital lethality, but it would be important to know if COVID-19 has any long-term effects on stroke survivors, such as an increased risk of recurrent stroke, cognitive impairment, or functional disability.


2. **Examine the impact of different COVID-19 variants on stroke outcomes.** The study did not differentiate between different COVID-19 variants, but it is possible that some variants may be more likely to cause severe complications in stroke patients. Future studies should investigate the impact of different variants on stroke outcomes.


3. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments for COVID-19 in stroke patients.** The study did not examine the effectiveness of different treatments for COVID-19 in stroke patients. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of different treatments, such as antiviral medications, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies, in reducing the risk of complications and death in stroke patients with COVID-19.


4. **Explore the role of vaccination in preventing stroke in patients with COVID-19.** The study did not examine the role of vaccination in preventing stroke in patients with COVID-19. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of stroke in this population.


5. **Develop and implement strategies to improve the care of stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.** The study highlights the need for improved care of stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should develop and implement strategies to improve the care of these patients, such as telemedicine, home-based care, and post-acute rehabilitation.
