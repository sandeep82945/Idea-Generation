Comparative Effectiveness of Age Adjustment Methods Across Different Health Systems: Investigate the effectiveness of the proposed age-adjustment methods in health systems with varying characteristics (e.g., predominantly public vs. private healthcare systems, high-income vs. low-income countries). This research could explore how different health systems' efficiency is impacted by age structure adjustments and identify the most effective methods for diverse healthcare settings.

Impact of Other Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors on Health Expenditure and System Efficiency: Beyond age, other factors such as socioeconomic status, urban vs. rural demographics, and prevalence of chronic conditions could significantly affect health expenditure and system efficiency. Future studies could develop and assess models that integrate these factors alongside age to provide a more holistic view of health system efficiency.

Longitudinal Study on the Evolution of Health System Efficiency Over Time: Conduct a longitudinal study to observe how the efficiency of health systems evolves over time with changing population age structures. This could involve tracking efficiency scores over several years or decades to understand how demographic shifts impact health system performance and how effectively age-adjusted models predict these changes.

Developing and Testing New Models for Health Expenditure Adjustment: Inspired by the limitations and findings of this study, research could focus on developing innovative models for adjusting health expenditure that incorporate emerging health technologies, telemedicine, and other factors influencing healthcare costs and delivery. This could also include exploring the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in predicting health system efficiency.

Global Comparative Analysis Using Age-Adjusted Health Expenditure Models: Conduct a comprehensive global analysis comparing health system efficiency across countries using the age-adjusted health expenditure models proposed in this study. This research could identify best practices and policy implications for optimizing health system performance worldwide, considering different age structures and demographic trends.
