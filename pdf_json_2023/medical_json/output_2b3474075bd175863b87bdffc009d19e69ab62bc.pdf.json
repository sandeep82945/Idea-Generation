    "abstractText": "With continued innovations in neuromodulation comes the need for evolving reviews of best practices. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRG-S) has significantly improved the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and it has broad applicability across a wide range of other conditions. Through funding and organizational leadership by the American Society for Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN), this best practices consensus document has been developed for the selection, implantation, and use of DRG stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. This document is composed of a comprehensive narrative literature review that has been performed regarding the role of the DRG in chronic pain and the clinical evidence for DRG-S as a treatment for multiple pain etiologies. Best practice recommendations encompass safety management, implantation techniques, and mitigation of the potential complications reported in the literature. Looking to the future of neuromodulation, DRG-S holds promise as a robust intervention for otherwise intractable pain.",

            "text": "With the introduction of new medical therapies, there is an inevitable growth of fundamental knowledge and improvements in outcomes. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRG-S) is a novel form of neuromodulatory therapy, that, rather than placing the electrical field over the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, as with conventional, tonic spinal cord stimulation (t-SCS), is placed near the cell nuclei of the afferent neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Given its novelty, the corresponding body of evidence is evolving compared to longer-employed therapies. The pivotal ACCURATE study, published in 2017, demonstrated superiority of DRG-S to t-SCS in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and causalgia.1 Additional studies have shown results differing from past t-SCS work, from potential treatment indications to functional and psychological outcomes. Supporting basic science work is also demonstrating that on a cellular, mechanistic level, DRG-S is functioning in a different manner.\nStimulating at the DRG is currently accepted as an alternative form of neuromodulation used for complex regional pain syndrome I and II and dermatomal pain syndromes, although additional benefits compared to t-SCS are becoming apparent. Targeting the somata of the pseudo-unipolar afferent nerve fibers allows access to all nerve fiber types.\nJournal of Pain Research 2023:16 839\u2013879 839 \u00a9 2023 Chapman et al.

Both modalities utilize a tonic waveform; however, DRG-S has efficacy when delivered in a subthreshold, paresthesia-free manner, at frequencies as low as 4 Hz, and when delivered intermittently.2\u20134 None of these are possible with conventional t-SCS.\nEarly basic science work identified filtering of afferent fibers at the DRG as the basic mechanism of action.5\u20137 However, filtering afferent signaling does not explain the effects of DRG-S on broad, multi-dermatomal conditions with a single lead placement.8,9 These effects suggest orthodromic effects from neurostimulation, an accepted mechanism of t-SCS, but rarely discussed with DRG-S. Single lead coverage of low back pain led to a theory that stimulating the DRG of the cutaneous branches of a dermatome led to inhibition at points of convergence centrally in the dorsal horn (DH).10 Additional antidromic effects from DRG-S on the sympathetic nervous system, namely its ability to influence neuroinflammation and tissue perfusion in peripheral vascular disease, are only beginning to be explored.11\u201314\nWhile these potential clinical benefits, alternative mechanisms, and potential expanded indications are worthy of excitement, a corresponding growth of prospective randomized research is still developing. This best-practice manuscript is meant to serve as a guide to the current state of the use of DRG-S, utilizing peer-reviewed literature, a reliance on clinical evidence, experience, and expert opinion, to assist practitioners in the application of this therapy in the safest, most efficacious manner, and to ensure the highest level of patient care. This builds on previous work by Deer et al, with an update of recent evidence.15"

            "text": "The DRG is the bundle of cell bodies of sensory afferent neurons situated at the intervertebral foramen of each of the 31 pairs of human spinal nerves. Sensory information travels centrally along a mixed spinal nerve to the DRG, where afferent axons bifurcate to give rise to a stem axon and a central axon, the T-junction.16\nAt the DRG, the perineurium encasing the spinal nerve root is replaced by a thicker layer of dura mater, with the arachnoid space starting at the proximal segment of the DRG.17,18 Thereafter, the dorsal and ventral roots travel in the subarachnoid space to their appropriate vertebral levels to split into nerve rootlets, entering at separate levels of the spinal cord. See Figure 1.\nThe DRG also contains non-neuronal cells and tissues vital to supporting and protecting the functions of the nucleus. Each neuronal cell body is encased by satellite glial cells. These cells support the somata and have interconnecting gap junctions which are involved with the sensitization of adjacent neurons.19,20 See Figure 2. In addition to connective tissue, there is a group of immune cells consisting mainly of macrophages and lymphocytes, blood vessels, and bundles of sympathetic nerve fibers.21"

After inflammation, partial nerve injury, or direct compression of the DRG,22,23 a portion of its afferent cell bodies may become sufficiently hyperexcitable and generate ectopic action potentials (APs).24 These ectopic APs are relayed to the T-junction where they may collide with incoming APs to decrease neural input.25 Action potentials can also be initiated in adjacent, unaffected C-fibers in the DRG and propagate centrally to cause signs and symptoms associated with neuropathic pain.21,23,26 Paintransmitting C-fibers are particularly prone to the effects of ectopic APs.5,7,27 See Figure 3A.\nAPs are initiated in the peripheral terminals of DRG neurons, although there are some small-fiber afferent sympathetic fibers that are capable of sending APs back down the same axon. This process is known as the dorsal root reflex (DRR).28 The DRR is utilized in peripheral vascular innervation, where the release of substance P and calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) from the peripheral terminals contributes to vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation.29 This system allows for the effects of antidromic propagation of APs with DRG-S. See Figure 3B and C.\nBy increasing or decreasing afferent signaling through ectopic APs, the DRG is positioned to serve as the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of information from the external and internal environments to the CNS.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 840\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

The anterior border of the foramen is formed by the posterior aspect of the adjacent vertebral bodies, intervertebral disc, and the lateral expansion of the posterior longitudinal ligament. The dorsal border is the superior and inferior articular processes and facet joint. The roof and floor of the neural foramen are formed by the pedicles of the respective levels.\nThe size of the lumbar foramen ranges in transverse and sagittal measurement from 8.5 mm wide and 18 mm tall at L1 to 10\u00d722.5 mm at L5.33\nJournal of Pain Research 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress\n841\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nThe DRG usually lies in the superior portion of the foramen close to the rostral pedicle.34 In the thoracic and lumbar levels, the DRG is positioned in close approximation to the vertebral pedicle, with the L5 DRG found intraforaminal in roughly 75% of cases, with only 6% found extraforaminal.35 In contrast, the sacral DRG was more likely to be found within the spinal canal than the neuroforamen. The S1 DRG is intraforaminal in up to 60% of cases, at S2 DRG the majority are in the spinal canal (50\u201385%), and at the S3 and S4 all the DRG are within the canal.35,36\nThe neural tissue and vessels are suspended in the foramen by transforaminal and intraforaminal ligaments. The 5 transforaminal ligaments are thick, rigid, and often unyielding, and their function is to support the intraforaminal structures. Measuring 2\u20135 mm and crisscrossing the foramen, these ligaments occupy a significant portion of the foraminal area. The finer intraforaminal ligaments suspend the neural and vascular tissues and prevent them from contacting the transforaminal ligaments and periosteum, enabling electrophysiological transmissions.37 These ligaments in addition to bony overgrowth may be potential obstacles to DRG-S lead placement.

            "text": "Blood supply to the DRG is provided by the spinal branch of the dorsal trunk of the segmental arteries. The radiculomedullary branches provide blood supply to the spinal nerve, running alongside the ventral aspect of the DRG and nerve roots.38 After piercing the DRG, the vessel forms a subcapsular capillary plexus, then penetrates deeper, branching into intraganglionic vessels, forming a dense capillary network, that directly interacts with sensory neurons.39 Capillaries in the DRG are fenestrated and lack a blood\u2013brain barrier, allowing blood-borne molecules to directly enter the DRG and interact with neuronal and non-neuronal cells.40 The regulation of blood flow to the DRG is achieved by muscular sphincters which adjust flow to functional and metabolic demands.41\nPeripheral nerves generally have a tight blood\u2013nerve interface, similar to the blood\u2013brain barrier, especially in comparison to the intensely vascularized and highly permeable vascular interface of the DRG.39 This permits a threefold increase of blood flow within the DRG as compared to a peripheral nerve.42\nThis porous barrier allows for systemic states such as diabetes mellitus and permits blood-borne toxic substances such as chemotherapeutic agents access to sensitive neuronal tissue. The alpha-motoneurons which are housed within the tight blood\u2013 brain barrier of the CNS, and not the DRG, are less susceptible to such injury. This microstructural feature, specific for the DRG, likely explains why anti-neoplastic and anti-HIV agents preferentially induce a peripheral sensory polyneuropathy.39\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 842\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nMultiple changes in the DRG are seen in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN): changes in microvascular blood flow,43 histologic changes such as thickening of the perineural cell basement membrane,44 changes in metabolic and immunologic processes, and a severity-dependent decrease in DRG volume.45\u201350 These pathophysiological changes seen in DPN support the notion that DPN originates at the DRG rather than the peripheral nerve itself.51,52\nThese observations suggest the DRG plays a central and primary role in the pathogenesis of sensory polyneuropathies, further supporting its role as a therapeutic target."

Sympathetic fibers are relayed to the hypothalamus, which controls the autonomic response. Efferent signals travel down the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus to reach sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord. Preganglionic fibers exit through the ventral root and enter the sympathetic chain through the white ramus communicans (WRC) to synapse onto sympathetic postganglionic neurons located in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. The postganglionic fibers, which are unmyelinated C-fibers, exit the sympathetic chain through the grey ramus communicans (GRC) to join the mixed spinal nerve at that level, and go on to their targets.53\nSympathetic tone is predicated on the frequency of AP firing, with lower frequencies seen in basal tone, and higher frequencies in excitatory states, such as vasoconstriction.54 In turn, antidromic propagation of APs at very low frequencies could provide a normalizing effect on the vasculature and decrease neurogenic inflammation.14,28,29,53,55,56\nSympathetic preganglionic WRC neurons can synapse with anywhere from 1:4 to 1:32 postganglionic GRC neurons,57 and as such the sympathetic nervous system has been described as an amplifier of neural transmission.

In 1995, Wright and Collition placed SCS leads at the L2 DRG based on Nakamura et al\u2019s concept of sympathetic convergence and reported satisfactory results over 8 months.61,62 In 2011, the second case\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 844\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nreport described an SCS lead over the C2 DRG for post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).63 Alo et al described lumbar and sacral nerve root stimulation with leads placed transforaminally or sacrally via the sacrococcygeal hiatus, where they likely captured the DRG that lie within the sacral canal.32,64\nThe DRG emerged as a potential target for neuroelectrical modulation secondary to work beginning in the 1980s.65,66 It was in September 2004 that the first patent was filed for a novel device to stimulate the DRG specifically.67 See Figure 5. At this time, t-SCS on the dorsal columns was the standard and sole option, relying on paresthesia that was prone to position-related changes in stimulation. It was technologically primitive by today\u2019s standards, combined with less robust lead configurations leading to less coverage for low back and even less so for the distal extremities. DRG-S was conceptualized to meet some of these shortcomings.\nApplying a lead on the DRG required several modifications from the existing t-SCS systems. These included a smaller lead diameter, increased flexibility, a reduced contact size, and a novel technique for device implantation. In addition, device programming needed to allow finer adjustments as dosing needs were substantially lower than previously utilized.\nThe proof-of-concept, first-in-human work was performed on three patients in 2008. This experience helped mold the next phase of lead and delivery engineering, IPG modification, and lead placement methodology. Once a reproducible device was available, a pilot study was conducted in the spring of 2009 that demonstrated a statistically significant pain improvement over 72 hours.68 The next phase of research was moved to Europe and Australia in 2010. Two small multicenter studies demonstrated safety and efficacy of targeting the DRG for foot pain and FBSS,69,70 and this led to regulatory approvals in Europe and Australia in 2011.\nIn 2012, Deer et al published the 2009 study data, where 8 of 10 trialed subjects achieved pain relief while reporting no adverse events, using average settings of 68 Hz, pulse width of 200 \u00b5s, and 0.800 mA.71 Shortly after that publication, in a multicenter European and Australian prospective trial of DRG-S, Liem et al again demonstrated safety and efficacy of DRG-S in 32 patients followed for 6 months.72 Eighty-nine percent of patients with neuropathic foot pain achieved significant pain relief, an area that is often challenging to cover with t-SCS.\nJournal of Pain Research 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress\n845\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nGiven the results of early studies, a prospective, multicenter, randomized comparative effectiveness trial of 152 subjects diagnosed with CRPS I and II of the lower extremities, comparing DRG-S to t-SCS, named the ACCURATE trial, was initiated.1 As with the Liem trial, this trial included pain conditions or painful regions such as the foot, knee, and inguinal areas that have historically been more challenging to treat, even with t-SCS, and used average settings of approximately 20 Hz, 300 \u00b5s, and 0.900 mA. Further programming advancements followed, as by 2019 it was identified that DRG-S was effective without the need for paresthesia recruitment, and by the next year it was revealed that DRG-S was effective at frequencies as low as 4 Hz and when dosed intermittently.2\u20134"

DRG-S demonstrated superiority compared to SCS for CRPS I and II at 3 (p < 0.0004) and 12 months (p < 0.0004).

Thirty-two of 39 patients proceeded to implant after trial (82%) with 28/32 responders (87.5%) at 6 weeks and 21/32 (66%) at a mean of 18 months' follow-up. A burst protocol was preferred in the majority, 78% (25/32), of patients. As the leads and SCS system used in this study were not designed to treat the DRG, the inability to fine-tune frequency and amplitude may have played a role in this preference over t-SCS."

Ten patients also had S1 leads placed for lumbar radicular pain or sacroiliac joint pain. Patients experienced a 76% reduction in VAS (9.3 to 2.2), and a 78% improvement in ODI, a 180% improvement in EQ-5 (0.30 to 0.84), a 93% improvement in psychological status as measured by the MCS (SF-36 30.8 to 59.5), and a 108% improvement in PCS (SF-36 23.8 to 49.4). Moreover, 70% of patients reduced opioid consumption, with two stopping completely.\nAnother study measuring the effects of frequency on outcomes included 20 patients titrated to 4 Hz.2 Their cohort included 20 patients, of which 8 had a history of prior lumbar fusion, 2 with laminectomy/discectomy, and 10 treated for NSLBP. All patients had bilateral T12 leads to cover lower back pain and a combination of unilateral or bilateral S1 or other lumbar leads to cover lower extremity pain. Frequency was titrated from a mean of 16 Hz to 4 Hz over a mean period of 80 days with pre-DRG -S, pre-titration, and post-titration outcomes measured. Efficacy was maintained at 4 Hz, as their improvements from baseline of 77% in VAS (8.8 to 2.0), 72% (67 to 19) in disability, and a 145% improvement in mood (EQ-5D 0.33 to 0.81) were maintained at 366 days post-implant. The cohort also maintained an opioid reduction of 87 to 43 MME and a reduction in the number of interventional procedures performed over the equivalent pre-DRG-S period from 0.5 to 0.04 per month. The article was published with a sister review of literature article on the mechanisms underlying stimulation at 4 Hz.79\nIn additional work from this group, measuring changes in quantitative sensory testing (QST) measurements, 11 patients were followed: 6 with a history of FBSS and 5 with NSLBP.125 Leads were placed at T12 and S1 for all patients, with 2 patients requiring leads at L4. Quantitative sensory testing was performed in patients before trial lead placement and either before trial lead removal or at the one-month follow-up after permanent implant. Patients experienced a 77% reduction in VAS, a 62% improvement in ODI, an 80% improvement in EQ-5, a 24% improvement psychological status as measured by the MCS (SF-36 42 to 52), and a 104% improvement in PCS (SF-36 23 to 47). The paper also demonstrated a normalization of pressure pain threshold, mechanical detection threshold, and conditioned pain modulation, signs of DRG-S improving both the nociceptive and neuropathic components of LBP.\nHuygen et al followed 56 patients treated with DRG-S for 1 year with mixed diagnoses. Twenty-five of these patients were treated for FBSS.126 Lead locations were not mentioned. Baseline NRS improved from 8 to 3.9 in FBSS patients at 1 year. The overall cohort also contained 24 patients with CRPS I and II, post-amputation pain, radicular pain, and others.

Pre DRG-S mean VAS was 8.6 and reduced to 3.9 with therapy. Pain intensity returned to 3.7 at 20 Hz but increased with higher frequencies reaching 5.8 at 80 Hz. Significant differences among the groups were shown over VAS, MPQ, EQ-5D, and BDI, and it was concluded that 20 Hz was a more optimal frequency."

Findings included greater systolic blood pressure with left-sided compared to right-sided leads, and normalization of blood pressure in all hypertensive patients. These findings were maintained over 2 years as well as MME decrease from 88 to 50. MSNA decreased 13%.

An additional case detailed a patient trialed with both SCS and DRG-S with comparative PtCO2 improvements. SCS improved to levels consistent with the literature,152,153 whereas DRG-S improved transcutaneous oxygen monitoring levels to near normal values.\nIn a case report, Hagedorn et al used DRG-S to treat erythromelalgia-related pain of the bilateral feet.154 Erythromelalgia is a neurovascular disorder classically characterized by erythema, warmth, and episodic burning pain in the feet, hands, and face. It is believed to be due to a defect in A\u03b4- and C-sympathetic afferent neurons. At 3 months post implant, the patient reported an 80% improvement in pain, as well as improved sleep and standing tolerance.\nNeurogenic inflammation is a process by which the inflammatory process occurs through antidromic signaling along afferent sympathetic nerves.

Additionally, measured were effects on QST and associated inflammatory biomarkers and gene transcription. Ipsilateral L4 DRG-S was found to provide pain relief and improved functional status in this small patient cohort.

The sacrum is formed by the fusion of five progressively smaller sacral vertebrae and their costal elements, stabilizing the lordotic lumbar spine at the lumbosacral angle, which measures roughly 35.182,183 Two ridges run lateral to the midline sacral crest called the intermediate crests, formed from the fused articular processes of the sacral vertebrae. They are largest at the S1 level, where they may partially obstruct the medial aspect of the S1 posterior sacral foramen (PSF) in the AP view. This ridge narrows and forms the sacral cornua caudally; it is a landmark for the sacrococcygeal hiatus, and lies just medial to the S4 PSF.\nThe sacral canal measures approximately 30 mm in width and 20 mm in height at the S1 level, and decreases in diameter caudally to the sacral hiatus.184\u2013186 The thecal sac ends at approximately the S2 level.\nThe sacral foramina have an anterior and posterior component. The anterior sacral foramen (ASF) communicates with the sacral canal through the intervertebral foramina, which is bordered rostrally and caudally by the pedicles and laterally by the fused winged sacral transverse processes.187 The PSF is an opening on the dorsal aspect of the sacrum which allows the sensory fibers to exit. The 4 PSF and ASF vary in size widths and depths, with the S1 PSF measuring 12\u00d710 mm followed by a smaller 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm S2 PSF.184,185 The rostral border of the S1 PSF lies approximately 2.5 cm from the superior margin of the sacrum and medial border 2 cm from midline, and 2.5 cm from the PSIS.188 In the lateral view, the ASF lies at the level of the remnant of the fused sacral intervertebral discs.\nThe ASF fan out inferolaterally, with the DRG and nerve root exiting the sacral canal at approximately 30\u00b0 degrees ventrally and 15 caudad to the transverse plane, and are accompanied by foraminal vessels. Intraforaminal instrumentation should be minimized as the DRG is sensitive to both physical and chemical stimuli.189,190 This avoids the potential for neuritis, paresthesia, or weakness, all of which are commonly self-limited.191\u2013193\nJournal of Pain Research 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress\n859\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nAccessing the sacral foramen can be challenging, as the PSF is smaller than the ASF and its view is often obscured under fluoroscopy.

Our initial target for the S1 foramen is the medial aspect of the PSF, measuring 2.0 cm from midline and 3.0 cm from the squared sacral promontory. See Figure 11.\nThere are several principles to placement:\n\u25cf Minimize instrumentation after posterior foraminal access. \u25cf Passing the lead can often be performed without the introducer. \u25cf Intra-canal loops can be challenging to place, and should be performed cautiously, in both the awake and IONM\npatient.\nUse a 22g Quincke \u201cfinder\u201d needle to enter the PSF, and, after confirmation, remove and replace with the Tuohy needle.

Apply gentle caudad pressure on the Tuohy hub and advance the introducer sheath several millimeters rostrally. As the tip appears in the cephalad direction, slowly continue advancing the introducer sheath and lead rostrally. Once the lead bows in the rostral direction, retract the stylet 3\u20134 cm and attempt to advance the lead.

            "text": "To date, cervical and thoracic DRG-S above the level of T10 is off-label in the United States, but is approved in many areas of the world, and is performed off-label in the USA. Potential applications published in literature include CRPS of the upper extremity, intercostal neuralgia, post-surgical neuropathic pain in the hand, thorax, breast, and shoulder, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and PHN. Benefits of DRG-S in the cervical and thoracic spine are similar to those demonstrated in the lumbar region. As the spinal cord lies ventrally, lead placement at these levels holds inherent risk, which can be limited with safety monitoring precautions as mentioned in this paper and should be reserved for experienced implanters.\nThe smaller A\u03b4- and C-fibers reach their end organ targets through the sympathetic chain. Lead placement directed at the stellate ganglion, with its ability to amplify sympathetic signaling, has the potential to have profound results. Along these lines, the most targeted levels in the cervical spine are C8 and C7, respectively for neuropathic pain. Propagation into the sympathetic chain allows for multi-dermatomal coverage for neuropathic pain syndromes, colloquially described as \u201ccross-talk\u201d.\nThe normal spine transitions from thoracic kyphosis to a cervical lordosis. Recent cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered prior to DRG-S, particularly in those over the age of 40, or with a history of cervical spinal disease. The average healthy adult cervical spinal canal diameter from C3-C7 measures approximately 13 mm, with roughly 8 mm or 60% taken by the spinal cord itself.197,198 Disc herniations, osteophytes, and ligamentous hypertrophy may further decrease this diameter and limit the ability and potentially increase risks of placement. The larger curved introducer sheath protrudes 8 mm from the shaft, and thus ventral rotation can lead to contact, displacement, or trauma to neural structures.\nThe cervical ventral and dorsal roots exit the spinal canal over the pedicle and enter a bony groove formed by the short transverse process of the cervical vertebrae. The foramina of the cervical spine are distinct from the lumbar spine in that there is a medial and lateral zone, with the medial zone the opening of the spinal canal at the level of the pedicle, and the lateral zone the bony transverse process and groove.199 The bony projection of the lateral foramina travels at a 45- degree angle ventrally and protects its contents with the bony anterior and posterior tubercles.200 The vertebral artery transects this bony lateral foramen through the transverse foramen. The DRG lies outside the spinal canal within the lateral foramen dorsal to the vertebral artery. See Figure 12. The relation of the DRG to the vertebral artery within the bony groove makes it imperative not to pass the introducer sheath outside of the medial foramen. The vertebral arteries enter the transverse foramen at the level of C6, travels within the bony transverse processes, and above C1 heads centrally to join the contralateral vertebral artery to form the basilar artery of the brainstem. Injury to this artery can potentially lead to paralysis, stroke, or death.\nIn some settings, it may be prudent to access the foramen with the shorter bevel sheath. Bevel control is imperative as rotation of the bevel ventrally can lead to contact with the cord. Guidewire utilization can limit sheath manipulation during lead placement. The pliability of the guidewire and lead are less likely to cause vascular insult should contact occur.\nThe extra-canicular location of the DRG at these levels are lateral to the pedicle and lie in the oblique plane as described above. Thus, programming should occur using contacts over this region.\nCervical and thoracic DRG-S lead placement should be reserved for experienced implanters who are well versed with DRG-S. The procedure must be performed with either the awake patient or using IONM, with small, precise movements, with constant reevaluation of neurologic status.\nAs such, when it comes to choosing the optimal patient for cervical DRG-S, the most common diagnosis is neuropathic pain in the hand, as the C6-8 levels may carry less inherent risk. The potential to influence the sympathetic nervous system at these levels may allow for multi-dermatomal coverage with a single lead placement. Placement above C5 is generally not\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 862\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nrecommended or supported in the current evidence. Fortunately, because of the mechanisms discussed, placement at C6 or below, usually provides adequate coverage for the entire upper limb. The eventual development of a paddle lead for DRG may make higher cervical placement more accessible for conditions such as occipital nerve pain or lower facial pain."

A case series by Skaribas et al detailed coverage of the entire foot with S1 placement,201 as further evidenced in multiple patients from other case reports and series.2,8,58,128 See Table 5.\nFor mixed-pain syndromes lead placement is more specific, requiring leads placed at each DRG innervating the source of pain, whether bone, muscle, or skin. This is secondary to the more specific pain transmitting A\u03b4- and C-fibers, which travel in Lissauer\u2019s tract to specific spinal segments to synapse with second-order neurons. Here, accompanying A\u03b4- and C-fiber LTMRs modulate sensation through pre- and post-synaptic inhibition. Stimulated A\u03b2 fibers enter at the corresponding spinal segment, eventually joining the inhibitory collateral network of the dorsal columns.80 Additionally, capitalizing at points of convergence within the spinal cord may offer multi-dermatomal mixed-pain syndromes such as low back pain.8 See Figure 13."

We have witnessed DRG-S progress from higher-frequency settings similar to t-SCS71 to the lowest frequency of the device\u2019s programming capabilities, 4 Hz.2 The fractional charge delivery of DRGS directly modulates A\u03b4- and C-fibers in addition to afferent A\u03b2 fibers and makes for a more specific form of neuromodulation.\nThe 6.1\u00d75\u00d71.3 cm commercial DRG BluetoothTM enabled IPG can power 4 leads simultaneously. The characteristic that sets the Proclaim IPG from SCS is its ability to deliver a more specific, finely tuned delivery of electrical current, with ranges demonstrated in Table 6. The Proclaim IPG\u2019s initial charge is 3.0 V, and it has a proposed lifespan of 6.5 years using a two-lead configuration.159 However, a recent evaluation of IPG battery consumption of 106 consecutive patients implanted with a mean 3.7 leads per patient for a mean 22 months used only 0.013 V, or less than 5% of the\nJournal of Pain Research 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress\n865\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ncharge until the elective replacement indicator alarm is activated.209 These details on charge delivery and battery usage reveal that 6.5 years using 2 leads was likely an underestimation of potential IPG lifespan.\nThe 1.0 mm commercially available slim tip lead is available in 50 cm or 90 cm lengths, each with four 1.25 mm metallic contacts spaced by 5 mm spanning its distal 2.5 cm. SCS leads can be utilized on the DRG with systems capable of subthreshold parameters, although lead diameter and technical challenges to placement are of concern.\nThe patient programmer is an application which gives the patient control of their device based on programs set forth by the clinician programmer. This gives the patient control over several functions, including turning their device on and off and changing to \u201csurgery mode\u201d or \u201cMRI mode\u201d if necessary. Most importantly, it allows one to toggle between different pre-determined programs, and once within a program it allows the patient to adjust the strength of stimulation per lead in picoamps. This empowers the patient to self-regulate should subtle changes occur over time.\nThe clinician programmer is the master controller for the implanted DRG-S system, controlling settings on the patient programmer. Fifteen individual programs can be created and stored, utilizing varying contact configurations, each with adjustable parameters of frequency, pulse width, amplitude, and \u201con/off\u201d paradigms. System data can be queried, including patient demographics, impendence levels of electrodes per lead, and the total remaining charge on the IPG. \u201cMRI mode\u201d and \u201csurgery mode\u201d regulation is also available."

This technology allows patients greater access to reprogramming other than those determined by geographic limitations. After patient consent, remote reprogramming can be performed through a wireless connection between the clinician and patient virtually.210\nWhen programming, there are several general principles:\n1. Program delivery should be below sensory perception. 2. Deliver the lowest possible efficacious dose, which in turn conserves energy. 3. Total charge delivered/second is measured in microcoulombs per second (\u00b5C/s), and is the product of frequency\n(Hz) \u00d7 pulse width (pW) \u00d7 amplitude (mA). 4. Adjustment pW for dermatomal coverage \u2013 although paresthesia-based dermatomal coverage may not be\nnecessary.107\n5. Dosing paradigms based on \u201con/off\u201d paradigms. 6. Avoid overstimulation through patient education.\nThe DRG-S system utilizes a tonic waveform delivered through a 4-contact lead. Effective at paresthesia and paresthesiafree levels, device programming should start at subthreshold levels given patient preference for paresthesia-free pain relief.211,212 Incremental steps in picoamps allows the ability to fine-tune the electrical field over the DRG with a tonic waveform, and results in a far lower total charge per second for efficacy.79\nIdeally, programming is performed with the guidance of recent imaging. As the DRG is most commonly located under the pedicle,213 programming begins with paresthesia mapping with electrodes under the pedicle.\nElectrical current travels from anode (+) to cathode (-), and their configuration shapes the electric field. The energy required for depth of penetration is proportional to the distance and number of the anode and cathode. Although multiple\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 866\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nderivations with 4 contacts are possible, the most basic for DRG-S is the \u201cskipped bipole\u201d configuration, which would create an electrical field over 1 cm in length, displaced toward the cathode. A simple \u201cextended guarded array\u201d configuration of (+, -, -, +) can span over 2 cm, at the expense of increased electrical output.\nUsing the three adjustable parameters, attempt to allocate dermatomal paresthesia in the pain distribution. Dermatomal coverage may not be achieved in some cases, and the closest possible distribution is acceptable. Dermatomal coverage does not predicate pain relief as seen with t-SCS.\nThe need for intraoperative paresthesia mapping is at the discretion of the provider. A lead placed with two contacts within the foramen in the AP and lateral fluoroscopic view is often adequate. Initial post-operative programming should be delayed until any anesthetic effects have dissipated. Waiting this period also allows any fluid in the epidural space and foramen to dissipate as well. Saline, heme, or serous fluid increases impedance and can lead to overstimulation if the patient is programmed before these fluids dissipate.\nAfter selecting the electrode array, the following approach can be utilized:\n1. Increase mA to the threshold\nParesthesia is typically achieved in lumbar DRG at <1.0 mA and is dependent on the distance of the electrical field generated from the DRG. Inability to capture paresthesia would indicate that the chosen contacts are outside the field of neural tissue. Sacral leads may require slightly higher mA given the larger anterior sacral foraminal diameter and an often perpendicularly placed lead relative to the laterally spanning DRG.33,214 Additionally, variables such as facet arthropathy, osteophytes, and disc material that can cause foraminal size to rapidly decrease are absent in the sacrum.\n2. Adjust pulse width for additional dermatomal coverage\nPulse width (pW) is the duration of the pulse applied, and initial programming can be started at 260 \u00b5s. As with SCS, adjustment of the pW can be used to capture different nerve fibers within the electrical field. Interestingly, when applied to the DRG, we see decreasing pW extending dermatomal paresthesia coverage. The opposite often occurs with SCS. Given that the mA is relatively fixed to subthreshold levels, pW is the variable most likely used to achieve a change in dermatomal coverage.\n3. Frequency is the number of cycles/second measured in Hertz (Hz).\nDRG-S has efficacy at the range of frequencies available with the Proclaim IPG. Although 20 Hz is the default frequency and the rate most published on, efficacy has been demonstrated at as low as 4 Hz, and at much higher levels.2,72,79 With no demonstrable differences in clinical outcomes within this range, the four-fold decrease in charge delivered/second favors using very low frequencies. Of note, lowering frequency may require a small increase in mA to recapture subthreshold levels.\nIf unable to achieve paresthesia, distribute the electrical field across different contacts of the array. If unable to achieve paresthesia with multiple contact distributions, an evaluation for lead migration should be made and confirmed with imaging.\nPatient education on the use of the patient programmer and understanding of appropriate therapeutic levels of stimulation is paramount to success and limits reprogramming visits. A patient that comprehends that stimulation levels should be maintained just below sensory perception prevents the patient from dropping their stimulation significantly and falling outside the therapeutic window. The level at which DRG-S loses efficacy below paresthesia threshold is not yet known, thus educating the patient to keep their amplitude 1 step (0.025 mA) below their sensing stimulation assures coverage.\nIf the patient has inadequate pain relief with their current program/programs and is within the therapeutic window, then attempts at reprogramming can be made.\nOptions for reprogramming are:\nJournal of Pain Research 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S364370 DovePress\n867\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n1.

As such, infection rates seen in earlier European DRG-S studies compared to US studies demonstrate substantially higher rates.72,82,223 North et al in 2020 in the PROMISE RCT demonstrated that the incidence of infection for subjects trialed with SCS >10 days was 24.1% vs 1.4% for subjects trialed \u226410 days, and early European DRG-S studies used extended trials of up to 30 days.224 Similarly, earlier studies used paresthesia-based programming with frequencies similar to SCS, leading to a battery depletion time which was similar to an SCS non-rechargeable IPG.72,225,226 And the initial lead iteration contained a \u201cball tip\u201d lead that was prone to dislocation, adding to the hardware complications.

General anesthetics should be avoided, including intravenous general anesthetics such as propofol without IONM while leads are being placed. Minimize foraminal instrumentation with the semi-rigid introducer sheath and rotating its bevel ventrally in the canal. Consider repositioning the introducer sheath or re-accessing the epidural space at a different location rather than making multiple repeated failed attempts at foraminal passage.\nThe authors recommend monitoring for neural function through the awake patient or through IONM."
