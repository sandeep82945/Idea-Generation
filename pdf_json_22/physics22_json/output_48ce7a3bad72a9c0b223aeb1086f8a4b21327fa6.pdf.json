            "text": "Organic photomechanical crystals transform light into mechanical work via the changes in solid-state structure that result from a photochemical reaction.1 These structural changes can induce elongation, bending, twisting, photosalience, and other behaviors.2\u20135 While numerous examples of photomechanical behaviors can be found in the literature,6\u201314 a predictive understanding of the relationships between molecular structure, crystal packing, photochemical transformation, and the mechanical work output remains elusive. Such understanding is vital for the rational design of photomechanical engines based on molecular crystals.15\nIn principle, determining the work output of a light-induced crystal-to-crystal transformation should be straightforward.

First, it is oen difficult to determine the structure of the product crystal aer photoreaction. Performing solid-state photochemical reactions in bulk crystals oen causes them to shatter, complicating diffraction experiments.6,16,17 If the photoproduct absorbs strongly at the excitation wavelength (positive photochromism), then a photostationary state is reached and complete conversion is impossible. To circumvent this problem, one might isolate the photoproduct in solution and recrystallize it. Unfortunately, the product crystal grown in this manner may have a different crystal packing from that formed by direct photoconversion in the solid-state.18 Finally, if the reaction is thermally reversible (T-type), the photoproduct may be too short-lived for practical structure determination. Progress in measuring experimental work outputs directly has been made recently,13 though such techniques are not yet widespread.\nEven if the photoproduct crystal structure can be determined experimentally, this leads to a second, more fundamental challenge: how does the transformation from the reactant to the product crystal actually occur? As with gas expansion cycles in thermodynamics, this process should consist of a series of welldened steps, each of which can be associated with an energy change. To simplify the problem, we will concentrate on\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 937\u2013949 | 937\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 2\n1 D\nec em\nbe r\n20 22\n.

It should be noted that the most commonly reported mode of photomechanical crystal actuation involves bending due to partial conversion that yields a reactant\u2013product bimorph structure.19\u201321 In principle, a bending crystal can be divided into subdomains that undergo expansion/contraction aer complete conversion, so this approach should be general and adaptable to bending as well.\nThe signicant experimental and conceptual challenges in this eld motivated us to turn to computational chemistry to predict the structures, transformations, and properties of photomechanical crystals entirely from rst-principles. Organic molecular crystal structure prediction has advanced considerably in recent years, thanks in large part to the development of accurate and computationally efficient electronic structure models for the solid state,22\u201325 which have considerably enhanced researchers' abilities to predict the thermodynamically most stable polymorphs.26\u201344 As a result, successful examples of crystal structure predictions in the Blind Tests,45\u201347 pharmaceuticals,48\u201352 and organic materials53\u201360 are accumulating rapidly.\nSuccessful application of crystal structure prediction to photomechanical crystals would enable rst-principles design and optimization of this promising class of materials. Unfortunately, this effort faces two major challenges. First, instead of generating the landscape of candidate structures for a single species, as in traditional crystal structure prediction, predicting a solid-state photomechanical response requires understanding the structures and transformations between two distinct crystal energy landscapes (reactant and product). Second, energetic stability cannot be the primary criterion for identifying the photochemical polymorph produced by the solid-state reaction. High photon energy and the steric constraints created by the solid-state reaction environment can drive the reaction toward a high-energy, thermodynamically metastable product.61 In other words, the conventional crystal structure prediction goal generating a modest number of low-energy polymorphs is replaced by the challenge of identifying the relevant structure(s) from a much larger pool of higher-energy candidate structures.\nHere, we develop a new, rst-principles methodology for predicting solid-state molecular crystal photomechanical transformations that overcomes these difficulties. It generates structures using crystal structure prediction, employs a crystalline topochemical hypothesis to predict the solid-state photochemical transformations, and establishes a photomechanical engine cycle that characterizes the anisotropic work produced by the structural changes. This theoretical approach is validated on two well-characterized [4 + 4] anthracene derivative photodimerization systems (9MA and 9TBAE, Fig. 1). This negative photochromic reaction permits complete conversion of the crystals to a stable photodimer form, avoiding mixtures and facilitating comparison to theory. We also use the theory to predict the photodimer crystal structure of a T-type reversible crystal (9AC) that has not yet been measured experimentally but may be more practical for actuator applications. The large \u223c107 J m\u22123 work densities computed for all three systems demonstrate the exceptional promise of organic molecular crystal\n938 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 937\u2013949\nengines. Moreover, our ndings demonstrate how molecular crystal packing plays a key role in determining the anisotropic work generated, emphasizing the value of theoretical tools capable of characterizing the stress and strain generated in these transformations."

            "text": "The crystal energy landscape for photomechanical materials based on the anthracene [4 + 4] photodimerization will typically contain at least three notable structures: the reactant crystal, a polymorph of the photochemical product crystallized from solution (referred to as the solution-grown dimer, or SGD), and the SSRD polymorph generated through the solid-state crystalto-crystal photochemical reaction. The SSRD is central to the photomechanical process, and we hypothesize that the SGD and SSRD crystal structures will match only in rare cases. Our rst task is to identify and characterize these structures. The monomer reactant and SGD product will frequently be the thermodynamically most stable polymorphs on their respective landscapes, while the SSRD lies quite a bit higher in energy.\n3.1.1 9MA. For 9MA, the initial force-eld-level crystal structure prediction landscapes contain the experimental monomer and SGD structures, though the monomer lies \u223c6 kJ mol\u22121 higher than the most stable predicted monomer crystal, while the SGD is the second-most stable form on its landscape at +0.1 kJ mol\u22121. However, further renement of the landscapes with increasingly accurate levels of theory shis the 9MAmonomer and SGD to become the global minimum energy structures on their respective crystal structure landscapes (ESI Fig. S5 and S6\u2020). Aer correcting for the \u223c60 kJ mol\u22121 intramolecular DFT delocalization error with SCS-MP2D according to eqn (2), the monomer and SGD crystals become nearly isoenergetic (Fig. 2).\nChem.

Energetic stability alone cannot be used as a criterion for the SSRD, since the constraints of the solid-state reaction environment can produce an SSRD that is highly metastable.61 A similar focus on high-energy structures occurs when predicting structures of porous organic materials,56,57,60 though there it stems from the models' omission of guest/ solvent molecules which stabilize the pores experimentally.\nA key conceptual advance in this paper lies in extending the topochemical principle to the problem of predicting the photoproduct crystal structure, rather than just the photoproduct molecule by itself. Solid-state anthracene [4 + 4] photodimerization reactions only occur when the reactive carbon atoms lie within 4.2 A\u030a and satisfy various orientational constraints.85\u201387 Moreover, the steric constraints imposed by the crystalline lattice limit molecular reorganization aer the photochemical transformation, thereby constraining the photoproduct crystal structure and inhibiting its relaxation to the lowest-energy SGD packing. Therefore, instead of relying on an energetic stability criterion, we identify the SSRD based on the crystal packing relationships that connect structures\n940 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 937\u2013949\nbetween the monomer and photodimer crystal energy landscapes.\nSpecically, we predict the product of the crystal-to-crystal transformation with no experimental information by generating an initial topochemical SSRD crystal in which the reacting monomer pairs in the predicted monomer crystal are replaced by photodimer molecules having the same positions and orientations, as described in ESI Section S1.2.\u2020 Constrained DFT relaxation of this crystal structure with the lattice vectors held xed at their monomer crystal values produces the protoSSRD. Subsequent unconstrained relaxation of the proto-SSRD atoms and lattice vectors produces the nal equilibrium SSRD structure. Applying this procedure to 9MA (Fig. 3a), we nd that the SSRD retains the same P21/c space group as the reactant monomer crystal, and it matches the rank #27 structure on the DFT photodimer crystal structure prediction landscape (Fig. 2) with an excellent rmsd15 overlap of 0.14 A\u030a.\nDetermining the 9MA SSRD crystal structure experimentally is difficult, since bulk crystals fracture aer about \u223c30% photodimerization under ambient conditions.88 Turowska-Tyrk and coworkers recently showed that photodimerization of single 9MA crystal can be carried to completion without fracture at elevated pressures in a diamond anvil cell.85 The SSRD structure predicted here (at 0 GPa) is an outstanding match for the experimental X-ray crystal structures reported at 0.1 and 0.4 GPa, with rmsd15 values of only 0.12 A\u030a (Fig. 2).\nMorimoto et al. observed that single microcrystal plates could expand by a factor of 1.07 along their c-axis while remaining intact.89 Presumably, these crystals also adopt the SSRD structure aer conversion. To conrm this, we performed powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments on 9MA microplates aer photodimerization. Fig. 4 compares the experimental PXRD pattern with a simulated one for the predicted SSRD structure. The microplates were not powdered, so their\nhotodimers after DFT refinement and the single-point intramolecular s are indicated.

Peak positions match within 0.2\u00b0, which is consistent with the differences in volumes between the different experimental pressures and 0 K DFT calculations. Furthermore, the peak with enhanced intensity at 10.6\u00b0 corresponds to the 001/100 Miller planes, which lie parallel to the bc crystal plane and thus horizontal along the substrate. The preferred orientation of the crystals should lead to enhanced intensity of this peak, as observed. Interestingly, aer photoconversion the experimental SSRD pattern disappears over the course of 1 hour as the plates become almost completely amorphous (ESI Fig. S4\u2020). Waiting for 5 days or heating the 9MA sample did not lead to recrystallization into the low energy SGD form, suggesting there is a considerable barrier to reorder the molecules into this polymorph. The rapid loss of the SSRD structure suggests that it is highly unstable. Previously, we observed that 9MA powders appeared to transform directly from monomer to the SGD photodimer structure.19 We suspect that the sample\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\npreparation process used in that work, which involved grinding the crystals aer UV irradiation, facilitated the SSRD-to-SGD transition and caused us to miss the presence of the SSRD intermediate. All these observations are consistent with the SSRD being a high-energy polymorph that can be stabilized by the application of mechanical pressure.\nThe 9MA monomer to SSRD structural transformation is anisotropic: the DFT-calculated cell contracts 2.6% and 3.7% along the a and b crystallographic axes, but it expands by 5.9% along c and the monoclinic angle b increases by 3.2% (Fig. 5a). The calculated expansions and contractions are slightly less than observed experimentally in the 9MA microplates,89 which may be a consequence of temperature effects since the calculations were done at 0 K. The large elongation along the c axis stems from an increase in lateral spacing between photodimers, rather than from the butterying of the anthracene rings upon photodimerization. Energetically, the SSRD lies a rather large 10.1 kJ mol\u22121 above both the monomer and SGD crystal structures. Previous polymorphism surveys suggest that only \u223c1\u20133% of polymorph pairs differ by 10 kJ mol\u22121 or more, and such large energy differences are even less common for rigid molecules such as 9MA and its photodimer.61,90,91\nOverall, both crystal structure prediction and the in silico topochemical SSRD formation approach independently produce the same SSRD structure.

Together with the successful prediction of the monomer and SGD crystals, these results demonstrate that the important 9MA crystal structures and the solid-state photochemical transformation can be predicted entirely from rstprinciples.\n3.1.2 9TBAE. Next, we further validate our crystalline topochemical approach by determining the solid-state photochemical transformations in 9TBAE. For simplicity, we omit the full crystal structure prediction steps. Instead, we start from the experimentally-known monomer crystal structure, relax it with DFT, and then predict the associated topochemical SSRD structures.\nPrevious NMR crystallography work established the structure of the 9TBAE SSRD as an ensemble of six, closely related and dynamically interconverting structures that differ only subtly in the torsional angles of the tert-butyl groups.92 Applying the topochemical approach to the 9TBAE monomer (Fig. 3b) predicts a P21/n SSRD structure that is similar to those six structures identied in the earlier study. Although the topochemical SSRD here retains the monoclinic symmetry of its parent monomer crystal, it overlaps with the six experimentally inferred orthorhombic structures with rmsd15 values around 0.4 A\u030a. Further conrmation of the topochemically-predicted SSRD comes from the X-ray diffraction structure for a partially photodimerized 9TBAE crystal.18 Extracting photodimer components from that partially-reacted experimental structure and relaxing them with DFT produces a P21/n symmetry structure in excellent agreement with the topochemically predicted one (rmsd15 = 0.11 A\u030a).

The 9TBAE unit cell expands 6.0% along the a axis, largely due to the butterying motion of the anthracene rings. Simultaneously,\n942 | Chem.

The c and b lattice parameters change only slightly, and the net volume change is small. These structural changes are consistent with the mechanism and magnitudes of nanorod elongation observed previously.6,93\n3.1.3 9AC. Now consider monoclinic 9AC. Structural characterization of its SSRD has proved experimentally infeasible todate due to the short photodimer lifetimes (seconds to minutes),94,95 which makes theoretical predictions essential to understanding the transformation. Fig. 3c and 5c show the topochemically-predicted crystal transformation. Whereas the photodimerizations of 9MA and 9TBAE both involve substantial elongation along a crystallographic axis, monoclinic 9AC exhibits only modest changes in the a, b, and c lattice parameters. Instead, the major transformation occurs via the 7.3% decrease in the b angle.\nThe one-dimensional stacking geometry in the 9AC crystal is qualitatively different from the herringbone geometry seen in 9MA and 9TBAE. This leads to a very different morphology change. The lack of extension along a major crystal axis probably explains why it has been more difficult to detect length changes for 9AC nanorods, although bending and twisting are much more readily observed.94,96,97"

            "text": "Now that the photochemical structural transformations are understood for all three systems, we need a conceptual framework to predict the work output. We establish an idealized fourstep photochemical engine cycle (Fig. 6) that enables characterization of the work that could potentially be performed by a given material:\n1. The cycle begins with an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d and complete solid-state photodimerization of the monomer species, converting the equilibriummonomer crystal to the proto-SSRD. The proto-SSRD retains the monomer unit cell parameters and is therefore highly strained.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFig. 6 The proposed photomechanical engine cycle for anthracene systems consists of: (1) topochemical photodimerization within the monomer unit cell to form the proto-photodimer (SSRD), (2) relaxation of the strained proto-photodimer to perform forward work, (3) topochemical dissociation of the photodimer back to the monomer within the photodimer unit cell (proto-monomer), and (4) reversework generated by relaxation of the proto-monomer back to the original equilibrium structure.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The associated stress release transforms the crystal structure anisotropically and produces \u201cforward\u201d mechanical work.\n3. The photodimer dissociates to a strained proto-monomer\u2014the monomer packed within the SSRD lattice parameters.\n4. The proto-monomer relaxes back to the original equilibriummonomer crystal structure, producing mechanical work in the \u201creverse\u201d direction.\nIn other words, chemical transformation creates the strained crystalline state, and relaxation of the associated stress produces work. Although the lattice parameter changes in Step 4 exactly mirror those from Step 2, the work performed in the forward and reverse directions will differ because the stress/ elastic constants differ between the proto-SSRD and protomonomer. In practice, this means that a photomechanical engine can perform net work similar to a traditional Carnot cycle based on gas expansion/compression. In the case of a photomechanical crystal, the input photon(s) act as an effective high temperature bath.\nIt is important to emphasize that real-world photomechanical crystals are expected to deviate from this idealized photochemical engine cycle. First, the solid-state photodimerization process does not occur instantly. Nevertheless, Raman spectroscopy experiments in certain photomechanical crystals suggest that the photochemical reaction and resulting crystalto-crystal transformation do largely precede the relaxation of the unit cell.98,99 Solid-state photochemical reactions can also\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nexhibit cooperative kinetics due to the changing local crystalline environment as the mixture of reacted and unreacted species evolves.100 However, such kinetic effects do not alter the nal thermodynamic state achieved aer complete reaction of the crystal and are therefore ignored in this idealized engine model.\nSecond, the solid-state photochemical reaction may not always reach 100% completion, whether due to positive photochromism or crystal packing reasons. For example, photodimerization within the one-dimensional monomer stacks in monoclinic 9AC occurs stochastically and only reaches \u223c75% completion, with the remaining monomers becoming isolated and unable to react.97,101 Crystal defects, impurities, and the experimental light source can also impact the extent of reaction.\nThird, many photomechanical processes are not reversible in practice. For example, the 9MA SSRD transforms to an amorphous material instead of reverting back to the monomer (ESI Fig. S3\u2020), while the 9TBAE SSRD slowly converts to the SGD.18 On the other hand, 9AC photodimerization is thermally reversible on the timescale of minutes.97 In other photochromic and photomechanical crystals, the reverse reaction can be triggered via a different wavelength of light102,103 or external pressure.104\nDespite these caveats, the idealized photomechanical engine cycle presented here provides a useful framework for quantifying the nature and magnitude of work that could hypothetically be performed by the system and for comparing the photomechanical responses of different materials."

            "text": "Having dened the photomechanical engine cycle, we analyze the photomechanical performance of 9MA, 9TBAE, and monoclinic 9AC. There are several different energies that are involved in the photomechanical cycle. We rst consider the energetics of the photochemical reaction itself. The computed solid-state photodimerization reaction energies differ signicantly across 9MA, 9TBAE, and 9AC. 9MA photodimerization is the least endothermic at 10.1 kJ mol\u22121. For 9TBAE, the photodimerization energy increases to 32.1 kJ mol\u22121, reecting the steric penalty of the bulky tert-butyl ester groups. The 9TBAE SSRD is computed here to lie 12.0 kJ mol\u22121 above the SGD, similar to what was found previously.61 On the other hand, the 101.2 kJ mol\u22121 photodimerization energy for monoclinic 9AC is several-times larger than the other two systems. The constraints of maintaining the hydrogen-bonded tetramer units within the 9AC lattice make this solid-state reaction energy even larger than the already endothermic 9AC gas-phase photodimerization.95 The highly endothermic forward reaction in 9AC could imply a relatively small reverse reaction thermal barrier in accord with the Hammond postulate. This might explain why 9AC photodimerization is thermally reversible, unlike 9MA and 9TBAE. However, detailed investigation of the reaction kinetics is beyond the scope of the present study. In any case, all of these endothermic reaction energies are small relative to the 300 kJ mol\u22121 energy input provided by the 400 nm photons driving the dimerization.\nIn our photomechanical engine framework, the actual mechanical work is done not by the photoreaction, but by the\nChem.

Fig. 7 presents the energies for each step of the cycle in each species, while Fig. 8 plots the corresponding anisotropic work densities for the forward photodimerization (Step 2) and reverse dissociation (Step 4) portions of the engine cycle.\nConsider rst the forward photodimerization process in 9MA. The proto-SSRD lies 21.9 kJ mol\u22121 above the equilibrium monomer crystal. Relaxation of the proto-SSRD unit cell to its equilibrium geometry stabilizes it by 11.8 kJ mol\u22121 (for a net reaction energy of 10.1 kJ mol\u22121). Fig. 8a plots the computed elastic work produced by relaxation of the proto-SSRD. The maximal 25.0 MJ m\u22123 work density occurs roughly along the c axis, which is unsurprising given the large 5.4% elongation in that direction. Much less work is produced by the smaller contractions along the a and b axis.\nWhile 9MA does not exhibit solid-state photochemical reversibility experimentally, we can examine what would happen if it completed the photomechanical engine cycle. The proto-monomer formed via dissociation within the photodimer unit cell lattice parameters is 0.7 kJ mol\u22121 more stable than the SSRD, and it relaxes 9.4 kJ mol\u22121 back to the original monomer unit cell. So while the lattice parameter changes upon dissociation mirror those from the photodimerization, the smaller stress and relaxation energy associated with photodimer dissociation translate to amaximum elastic work density of only 12.3 MJ m\u22123 for Step 4 of the engine cycle (Fig. 8b) that is half as large as the forward (Step 2) work.\n9TBAE exhibits somewhat larger energy changes than 9MA throughout the engine cycle (Fig. 7). At the same time, the maximum forward-direction work density of 46.7 MJ m\u22123 for 9TBAE (Fig. 8c) is nearly double that of 9MA. Notably, the 6.0% expansion along the a axis produces far more work than the\nFig. 7 The energetics associated with the four stages of the photom monoclinic 9AC.\n944 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 937\u2013949\n8.5% contraction along the b. The a expansion reects the bending out of the anthracene rings, while the b contraction stems from the energetically \u201csoer\u201d compression of the void space created as the monomer units slide into register to react.\nAs noted earlier, photodimerization of monoclinic 9AC is highly endothermic. The proto-SSRD lies 119.1 kJ mol\u22121 above the monomer, compared to 21.9 and 61.0 kJ mol\u22121 for 9MA and 9TBAE, respectively. However, the 17.9 kJ mol\u22121 relaxation energy of the 9AC proto-SSRD is intermediate between that of 9MA (11.8 kJ mol\u22121) and 9TBAE (31.5 kJ mol\u22121). Correspondingly, the maximal work density of 30.1 in the forward direction is closer to that of 9MA than that of 9TBAE (Fig. 8e). Whereas the maximal work density for 9MA and 9TBAE is performed along a crystallographic axis, the maximal work density in 9AC occurs in between the a and c axes\u2014it stems largely from the 7.3% contraction of the b angle upon photodimerization. As for 9MA, the reverse work resulting from the photodimer dissociations in 9TBAE and 9AC are substantially smaller than for the forward photodimerizations (Fig. 8d and f).\nTaken together, these results reveal several important features of these photomechanical crystals: rst, the model predicts photomechanical crystal work densities of \u223c107 J m\u22123, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the experimental work densities that have been reported experimentally to-date for thermosalient and photomechanical organic crystal actuators (\u223c10\u2013105 J m\u22123)13,81,105 or photomechanical polymers (up to \u223c105 J m\u22123).13,106 It will be important to see if future experiments can conrm these high predicted work densities. Second, the work resulting from the photodimerization is roughly double that produced by the dissociation. This reects how the anthracene monomer crystals deform much more readily (i.e. with less stress) than the photodimer ones. Third, the anisotropic structural changes produce work that is also\nechanical engine cycle differ significantly across 9MA, 9TBAE, and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFig. 8 The predicted work densities for the forward photodimerization and reverse dissociation reactions of 9MA, 9TBAE, and monoclinic 9AC are highly anisotropic.

This highlights the importance of crystal morphology and orientation for device performance. Fourth, the amount of the work performed by a switchable photomechanical material cannot always be inferred from the crystallographic change in lattice parameters (strain) alone; the stress component of the work also depends signicantly on the molecular packing. This is evident in the disparities seen for the 9TBAE work densities along the a and b axes and in the differences between the forward and reverse directions for all three systems. Fih, the reaction energetics are somewhat decoupled from the amount of photomechanical work performed. 9AC photodimerization is much more endothermic than the other two species, but 9TBAE can perform considerably more mechanical work. This suggests that it may be possible to design materials that tune the reaction reversibility and the photomechanical work semi-independently.\nFinally, we briey consider the photon-to-work efficiencies of these photomechanical engine cycles. Based on the \u223c12\u2013 30 kJ mol\u22121 Step 2 relaxation energies per reactive pair in the engine cycle (Fig. 7),\u223c5\u201310% of the input 400 nm (300 kJ mol\u22121) photon energy is converted to forward work. Subtracting the energy change from the reverse direction (Fig. 7, Step 4), we estimate that \u223c1\u20135% of the input photon energy is converted to net work. Of course, given the anisotropy of the structure transformation and its resulting work, not all of that relaxation energy will translate into the forward/reverse work for a given actuator mode. Nevertheless, the efficiencies will likely remain in the range of a few percent for these photomechanical engines. For comparison, experimental photon-to-work efficiencies up to 0.1% have been determined for the bending\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nmotions of azobenzenes,13 though they are frequently much lower for photomechanical actuators.13,107 At the other extreme, a simple 1-D model suggests that efficiencies of up to 55% are achievable in principle.108"

Anisotropic work density calculations can provide guidance on the potential performance of a material and how one should design an actuator that maximizes the work performed for a desired task. For example, to li an object from below using a linear actuator, one might focus on forward expansion work and let gravity facilitate the reverse contraction process. On the other hand, linear contraction work could be used to li an object from above. From Fig. 5 and 8, we can see that the same crystal can be used for both types of work simply by changing its orientation with respect to the load.

It addresses several long-standing challenges surrounding the design of solid-state photoswitching and photomechanical systems, including the difficulties associated with determining the crystal structures of the photoproducts, with anticipating how changes to molecular structures will impact the crystal structures, and with understanding how crystal structure determines the mechanical response properties. The proposed photomechanical engine cycle provides a framework for characterizing the anisotropic photomechanical responses in these systems. It can be used to identify which crystal orientations or morphologies can best exploit the work produced by the photochemical transformation and to compare the potential for photomechanical work across different materials.\nWhile the present study focuses on anthracene-based crystals, these same techniques can readily be applied to other solid-state photoswitching crystals, such as azobenzenes and diarylethenes. The detailed atomistic pictures generated with these techniques could also provide the foundation for multiscale models13 that could predict photomechanical behaviors in nanoscale actuators and would facilitate the development of practical organic crystal engines.\nData availability\nAll relevant data is included in the ESI\u2020 materials already.\nAuthor contributions\nBeran conceived the research project with Bardeen, with additional input from Mueller and Al-Kaysi.
