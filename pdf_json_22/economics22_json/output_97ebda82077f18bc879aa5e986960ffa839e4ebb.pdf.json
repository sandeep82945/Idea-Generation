    "abstractText": "The lockdowns imposed during the COVID\u201019 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on people\u2019s time use. This article analyses the changes in time spent on household tasks and parenting by men and women during the lockdowns of the spring and autumn of 2020 in France, by social category, education, working arrangements and family configurations, using data from the major longitudinal EpiCov survey. The time spent on housework was high in the spring of 2020 and caring for children was particularly time consuming. This additional domes\u2010 tic and parental burden affected both women and men, but women continued to perform the majority of the housework, in spite of the similar working conditions between the sexes during this period. During the first lockdown, women at the top of the social hierarchy, who generally perform fewer household chores, spent far more time than usual on these tasks, thereby tempo\u2010 rarily reducing social differences.

This article analyses the changes in time spent on household tasks and parenting by men and women during the lockdowns of the spring and autumn of 2020 in France, by social category, education, working arrangements and family configurations, using data from the major longitudinal EpiCov survey. The time spent on housework was high in the spring of 2020 and caring for children was particularly time consuming. This additional domes\u2011 tic and parental burden affected both women and men, but women continued to perform the majority of the housework, in spite of the similar working conditions between the sexes during this period. During the first lockdown, women at the top of the social hierarchy, who generally perform fewer household chores, spent far more time than usual on these tasks, thereby tempo\u2011 rarily reducing social differences.\nJEL: J22 Keywords: COVID\u201119, lockdown, housework, parenting time, gender, social class, inequality\n*INED; **INSEE; ***Nathalie Bajos and Josiane Warszawski (scientific leads), Guillaume Bagein, Fran\u00e7ois Beck, Emilie Counil, Florence Jusot, Nathalie Lydie, Claude Martin, Laurence Meyer, Ariane Pailh\u00e9, Philippe Raynaud, Alexandra Rouquette, Delphine Rahib, Patrick Sicard, R\u00e9my Slama, Alexis Spire.

In France, working hours decreased or fell to zero for employees faced with job losses, a reduction in hours, or partial unem\u2011 ployment; for others, particularly those in front\u2011 and second\u2011line jobs, they remained sta\u2011 ble or increased (Barhoumi et al., 2020; Jauneau & Vidalenc, 2020). The introduction of remote working allowed those who were able to con\u2011 tinue working in this way to reclaim the time that they would usually spend commuting, but blurred the lines between the private and pro\u2011 fessional domains. The periods of lockdown and the introduction of the curfew limited the leisure activities that people could participate in outside the home, due to both the restric\u2011 tions on movement and the closure of sports and cultural establishments. On the other hand, households were faced with increased demands in terms of household chores. Staying at home meant that more meals needed preparing and more shopping and cleaning had to be done (Craig & Churchill, 2021; Sevilla & Smith, 2020), while opportunities to outsource or del\u2011 egate these tasks were limited by the closure of canteens and restaurants and the fact that many home help services were no longer available, particularly during the first lockdown in spring 2020. This increase in housework represents a break in the long\u2011term trend, which has seen a gradual decline in housework for women in France (Champagne et al., 2015), as is the case in other Western countries (Pailh\u00e9 et al., 2021; Kan et al., 2011), brought about by the increase in employment among women, the develop\u2011 ment of household appliances and alternative products, and by a change in expectations and norms when it comes to housework.\nDuring the first lockdown, the closure of nurs\u2011 eries, primary schools, secondary schools and extracurricular activities meant that parents of young and school\u2011age children also had to look after them all day and provide more intensive support for their education (Thierry et al., 2021). Regardless of their social environment, fami\u2011 lies prioritised the well\u2011being of their children in accordance with good parenting standards (CAFC, 2021). This increased investment in activities with children seems to continue the trend observed in recent decades, for both women and men alike.\nFrom the start of the first lockdown, the ques\u2011 tion arose as to how gender inequalities would change, in particular when it came to domestic and parental activities. Some saw the pandemic\nas a potential catalyst for gender convergence. By creating an exceptional situation in which the working conditions of partners became very similar, for example as a result of everybody working from home, the lockdown allowed for greater involvement of men in the private sphere, an area in which women usually invest more time. Therefore, for Alon et al. (2020) many fathers had to assume the primary responsibility for childcare, which may ultimately contribute to eroding the social norms that underlie the unequal division of domestic and parental work between women and men.\nHowever, many quantitative surveys have instead shown that gender inequality has remained the same or even worsened over the course of the pandemic, and the findings appear to be linked to the context and type of activities (domestic or parental) carried out. All of the studies carried out in Western countries have shown a sharp increase in unpaid work, particularly among women (Craig & Churchill, 2021; Sevilla & Smith, 2020), with the extent of this varying depending on how strict the lockdown measures in place were and the duration and extent of school closures and disruption to lessons. The degree to which men were involved prior to the pandemic is also a key determining factor for the variations observed. In Anglo\u2011Saxon countries, men significantly increased their involvement in domestic tasks (Petts et al., 2021; Shafer et al., 2020; Hupkau & Petrongolo, 2020). In southern European countries, their involvement was limited, particularly when compared with the very significant increase in housework for women (Farr\u00e9 et al., 2022; Del Bocca et al., 2020). Men in particular contributed more than usual to parenting, whether it be in Anglo\u2011Saxon countries (Sevilla & Smith, 2020; Andrew et al. 2020; Petts et al., 2021), continental Europe (Kreyenfeld & Zinn, 2021; Hipp & B\u00fcnning, 2020) or southern Europe (Biroli et al., 2021). The gender gap has even narrowed in Australia (Craig & Churchill, 2021; Craig, 2020) and Canada (Shafer et al., 2020). In Germany, the more even split of childcare observed at the start of the pandemic (Kreyenfeld & Zinn, 2021) subsequently reduced (Boll et al., 2021). In southern Europe and the UK, women took on the majority of the increased childcare burden (Farr\u00e9 et al., 2022; Del Bocca et al., 2020), which brought about a widening of the gender gap (Hupkau & Petrongolo, 2020). These studies looked in particular at the impact of the change in working conditions on participation in house\u2011 work during the pandemic. A small number of studies analysed the social differences and, once\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 2022 5\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\nagain, the results were contrasted depending on the context. In Spain, for example, female graduates saw the amount of time that they spent on unpaid work increase more than any other group (Farr\u00e9 et al., 2022), while, in Germany, it was the men and women with a lower level of education who spent more time caring for children (Kreyenfeld & Zinn, 2021).\nIn France, in the initial surveys performed on small or non\u2011representative samples, women stated that, during the pandemic, housework and parenting in particular increased (Champeaux & Marchetta, 2021). On average, the time that women devoted to housework and parenting during the first lockdown remained higher than that of men (Safi et al., 2020), but housework was shared a little more evenly between partners than before the pandemic (Boring & Moroni, 2021), particularly in the case of couples where the man was not working or was working from home (Dominguez\u2011Folgueras, 2021).\nThis article aims to further explore these initial findings using data from the large longitudinal and representative EpiCov survey (Box 1). We will analyse the differences in time spent on household and parenting tasks by men and women during the 2020 spring and autumn lock\u2011 downs (Box 2) and in particular the differences based on socio\u2011professional category, income, qualifications, working arrangements and family configuration.\nFollowing a brief recap of the main theories concerning housework, in section 2, we will describe the data and method used. In the third section, we will describe the changes observed with regard to employment and working hours during the first two lockdowns, followed by the descriptive and then multivariate findings concerning the amount of time spent on house\u2011 hold tasks, and finally those for the time spent on parenting tasks."

            "heading": "1. Three Main Theories on Housework",
            "text": "The unprecedented experience of lockdown provided an opportunity to better understand the determinants of household and parental work and the mechanisms for its distribution between the genders. Three broad explanations are usually put forward. The first relates to available time: time spent on household tasks is inversely proportional to time spent at work for both women and men alike and therefore largely depends on their working hours (Presser, 1994; Blair & Lichter, 1991; Bianchi et al., 2000; Gershuny et al., 2005). The health crisis has severely disrupted the time that people\nhave available. In France, the average number of hours worked decreased by around 35% during the first lockdown when compared with the same period of the previous year (Jauneau & Vidalenc, 2020); it can therefore be expected that both men and women who did not work during lockdown will have spent more time on housework. This has been observed by many studies: the increase in the burden of household and parenting work is linked to occupational changes during lockdown (Adams\u2011Prassl et al., 2020; Sevilla & Smith, 2020; Zoch et al., 2021; Dominguez\u2011Folgueras, 2021). However, the empirical results differ for the two genders: the time spent by men on childcare and household chores during the pandemic was more dependent on their working conditions than was the case for women (Andrew et al., 2020; Sevilla & Smith, 2020; Hank & Steinbach, 2021), which is at odds with traditional findings, which show that the amount of time spent by women on housework stretches more around time spent on paid work than is the case for men. This means that, before the pandemic, women were more likely than men to increase the amount of time spent on housework, for example during periods of unem\u2011 ployment (van der Lippe et al., 2018). In this sense, lockdown was an unprecedented situation that could help us to understand how time spent on household chores varies depending on paid work. Indeed, it presented an exogenous and unanticipated shock to the working hours of both men and women alike, something that the anal\u2011 ysis can take advantage of, seeing as this change to working hours is not a priori linked to gender roles,1 whereas changes in the working hours of men and women are usually shaped in advance by norms and earlier decisions concerning the gender\u2011based division of work. The constraints of working hours are usually endogenous for everyone, so it is difficult to assess their role.\nA second group of explanations concerns the relative resources of each partner. According to economic theories of conjugal specialisation, the time spent by each partner on household chores depends on comparative advantages in professional and private spheres (Becker, 1985). In heterosexual couples, since, on average, men earn more than women, they devote more time to paid work, while women spend more time doing housework. More recent economic theories highlight the bargaining power between spouses, which is dependent on their respective resources (Chiappori, 1997; Behrman, 1997). According to sociological analyses based on\n1. Except with regard to the distribution by occupation and sector.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 20226\nthe relative resources of partners, the distribu\u2011 tion of unpaid work within couples reflects the power relationships in which the partner with the highest income (generally the man) or with the highest level of education tends to delegate housework to the other (Shelton & John, 1996). Although lockdown did not have any impact on relative levels of education, it did affect the relative economic resources of the partners in situations in which one partner unexpectedly lost their job or suffered a drop in income as a result of part\u2011time working or a reduction in working hours. In addition, a higher level of education or higher salary within the household could provide one of the partners, and in particular the woman, who performs the vast majority of the house\u2011 work, with the means to outsource some of that housework without having to negotiate with the other partner (Gupta, 2007). From that perspec\u2011 tive, the near\u2011impossibility of outsourcing housework during the first lockdown may have resulted in the renegotiation of the distribution of tasks to be performed based on relative resources among those households who usually rely on outsourcing (often the wealthiest).\nThe third perspective explains the gender disparities observed in the performance of housework as the result of the gender roles instilled in people from childhood, which are deeply internalised (Cunningham, 2001; Akerlof & Kranton, 2000). According to constructivist approaches to gender performance or \u201cdoing gender\u201d, these roles are reinforced by practices (Berk, 1985; Brines, 1994; West & Zimmerman, 1987): women display their gender identity through the household tasks they perform (West & Zimmerman, 1987; Brines, 1994). Couples may even compensate for an atypical situation from the point of view of gender (for example, households in which the woman is the main breadwinner) by adopting a traditional division of work (Brines, 1994). From this perspective, the pandemic would not be expected to bring about any significant change to the organisation of household tasks due to the deep\u2011rooted nature of these gender practices."

            "heading": "2.1. Data",
            "text": "We make use of the data from the large longi\u2011 tudinal EpiCov survey, the sample for which is representative of the French population (Box 1), in which the same people were questioned in May and November 2020 with regard to the amount of time that they spend on household and parenting tasks. Our population of interest is that\nof working age people (20 to 65 years), whether they have a partner or not, who responded to the long questionnaire during the first wave, so 10,466 people (4,770 men and 5,696 women) and during the second wave, so 8,379 people (3,709 men and 4,670 women). Of the latter, 69% have a partner and 39% are parents of minor children (see Table A1 in the Appendix).\nIn the absence of reference data on the division of housework just before the pandemic,2 we will compare the time spent on housework and parenting in May and November 2020. The impact on time was much less pronounced in the autumn than in the spring: in autumn, schools remained open, economic activity had largely resumed and with it, the amount of time spent doing paid work (Box 2); working full\u2011time from home was also significantly less widespread and there were far more options for outsourcing housework. We are working on the assumption that this situation is fairly close to \u201cnormal\u201d. The comparison between May and November is therefore a way, albeit imperfect, to measure the impact of the first lockdown on time spent on household and parenting tasks. This may appear to be a strong assumption, as it is not impossible that the first lockdown had a learning effect and led to the reallocation of tasks, particularly for parents or new remote workers, which could have a lasting impact on the organisation of time within families. Without an identical measure of the amount of time spent on each task before lockdown, this is difficult to judge. This assumption of a sort of \u201creturn to normal\u201d does appear credible, however. For example, a study carried out in the United Kingdom using data from the Understanding Society panel showed that the distribution of housework, which had become more equal during the spring lockdown, had returned to the pre\u2011lockdown situation by September 2020 (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2021). In addition, in the French context, other events affecting paid working hours in a signif\u2011 icant and lasting manner, such as the 35\u2011hour reform, only had a minimal impact on time spent performing housework (Pailh\u00e9 et al., 2019a) and long\u2011term changes are generally extremely slow (Champagne et al., 2015). The bias is also well\u2011known: if the first lockdown allowed men to participate in the long\u2011term, measuring the difference between the two periods underesti\u2011 mates their greater involvement during the first lockdown.\n2.

            "text": "Given the specific nature of our variable of interest (time spent on housework and parenting is reported in seven bands), we estimate the regressions for each interval. The dependent variable y refers to the time spent on household chores, measured in hours per day and reported via seven bands in the EpiCov survey. If A0 0= , A A A A A A1 2 3 4 5 60 0 5 1 2 4 6= = = = = =, . , , , , and A T C7 24= \u2212 \u2212 , where C is the time spent parenting and T is the time spent doing paid work, with the values at the extreme ends of the ranges being referred to as \u201cthresholds\u201d. An ordered probit model (or an interval regression, Greene & Hensher, 2010) at known thresh\u2011 olds (with those thresholds being observed) assumes that there is a link between the range j and a latent, non\u2011observed variable y* taking\nthe form y j A y Ai j i j= \u21d4 \u2264 <\u22121 * and that this latent variable follows a linear model of type y xi i i * = \u2032 +\u03b2 \u03b5 .\nThe main variables of interest for studying the link between available time and time spent on housework are the work situation during lock\u2011 down and the amount of time spent on paid work. The time spent doing paid work is measured across the seven days preceding the survey. We construct a professional activity situation variable for each survey, for which the modalities are as follows: not working (in education, stay\u2011at\u2011home parent, retired, etc.), unemployed (job seeker), full or partial technical unemployment, working on site, working full\u2011time from home, hybrid working and miscellaneous leave (special leave of absence, sick leave, holidays, etc.).\nBox 1 \u2013 The EpiCov survey EpiCov (Epid\u00e9miologie et Conditions de vie li\u00e9es au Covid-19 \u2013 Epidemiology and Living Conditions associated with COVID\u201119), a representative survey conducted by INSERM and the DREES (the statistics and research directorate of the ministry of health and social affairs) with the assistance of INSEE and Sant\u00e9 publique France (the French Health Authority) surveyed people aged 15 and over via the internet or telephone in mainland France, Martinique, Guadeloupe and R\u00e9union in order to monitor the dynamics of the pandemic, living conditions and exposure to the virus (for a detailed description, see Warszawski et al., 2021). The same people participated in the survey at several points during the pandemic. Around 135,000 people responded during the first wave (of the 371,000 people drawn at random based on tax data), which took place between 2 May and 2 June 2020, the period between the strict lockdown and the first phase of opening up (see Box 2). Around 110,000 people participated in the second wave of the survey between 26 October and 30 November 2020 and 85,000 people responded to the third wave during the summer of 2021. Only the first two waves of the survey are used here. The questionnaire included questions concerning the amount of time spent performing household chores, which were addressed to a randomly drawn sub\u2011sample of respondents (around 10% of respondents, so 13,500 people): Over the last seven days, how much time, on average, have you spent on common household chores (cooking, shopping, cleaning, laundry) each day? Over the last seven days, how much time, on average, have you spent looking after your children or grandchildren under the age of 18? In order to facilitate the response, seven response options were offered: 0 minutes; less than 30 minutes; more than 30 minutes but less than 1 hour; more than 1 hour but less than 2 hours; more than 2 hours but less than 4 hours; more than 4 hours but less than 6 hours; 6 or more hours.\nBox 2 \u2013 The measures of restriction during the first two lockdowns The first strict population lockdown was in place from 17 March to 11 May 2020 across the whole of the French territory. All activities deemed to be non\u2011essential were shut down and people were asked to work from home wherever possible. Schools, nurseries and leisure and social facilities were closed and people were only permitted to leave the house to go to work, to go shopping, for health reasons or due to a family emergency and to exercise alone for no more than an hour and within a maximum radius of one kilometre from home. From 11 May, businesses reopened, as did primary and secondary schools, albeit very gradually. By 2 June, movement was no longer restricted within mainland France and bars and restaurants reopened. The second lockdown, in place from 30 October to 15 December 2020 in mainland France, was less strict than the first. Remote working once again became the rule, but the list of essential activities was longer and many industries were permitted to continue trading. Nurseries and schools remained open. Movement was once again limited, as was the case in spring. From 28 November, people were permitted to travel within a radius of 20 km from their home and for up to three hours. \u201cNon-essential\u201d businesses reopened, with the exception of bars and restaurants and cultural establish\u2011 ments. On 15 December, people were allowed to move around during the day, but a curfew was introduced between 8 pm (6 pm in 25 departments) and 6 am. On 16 January 2021, the curfew was brought forward to 6 pm, before being gradually relaxed.

The information on the standard of living of the household (income per consumption unit, in deciles) is taken from the 2018 tax files.4\nThe control variables are: age, family situation, whether the partner works outside of the home (as opposed to working full\u2011time from home or not working), the survey period, the residential location variables (\u00cele\u2011de\u2011France, other region within mainland France, overseas) and the type of accommodation (house or apartment).\nThe estimations were made on the basis of pooled data from the two waves, with interaction between the survey period (May vs November) and our variables of interest. Two specifications are estimated, one with working hours and the other with employment status. We routinely compare men\u2019s and women\u2019s hours, estimating the regressions for each gender. We provide a graphical representation of the predicted hours following these regressions (the results of the regressions performed for both waves together are presented in the Online Appendix, Table S\u20111 for time spent on housework and S\u20112 for time spent parenting).5"

However, prior to the pandemic, in the 20\u201165 age bracket, women were more likely to be not working than men.6 The proportion of unemployed people does not vary by gender. The recourse to remote working, which was not widespread before the crisis, was a little more common among men (9% reported working remotely) than among women (7.5%) prior to lockdown (Figure I).\nThe spring 2020 lockdown made working condi\u2011 tions that were previously the exception much more common, such as technical unemployment or the possibility of working full\u2011time from home. In May 2020, in the seven days preceding the first questionnaire, 12.4% of men and 11.5% of women (or 17.4% and 18.1% respectively of those actively employed prior to lockdown) were affected by full technical unemployment,7\n16.6% of men and 16.0% of women of working age (or 21.5% and 24.1% respectively of those actively employed prior to lockdown) were working full\u2011time from home and 33.5% of men and 25.3% of women (or 42.5% and 37.0% of those actively employed prior to lockdown) were working exclusively on site, a situation that has become less frequent, but is still more common among men than women.\nDuring the second lockdown in autumn 2020, which was less strict, interruptions to economic activity were less frequent and there were more opportunities to work on site (48.8% of men and 40.9% of women, or 61.1% and 56.7% respectively of those actively employed before the health crisis and who work exclusively on\u2011site). Full technical unemployment was significantly less common (2% of those actively employed before the health crisis). Full\u2011time remote working also became less common, having been replaced by hybrid working, with employees alternating between working on\u2011site some days and working from home on other days. We should also note the more frequent leaves, since the second wave of the survey was conducted in part during the All Saints\u2019 school holidays. Once again, we observed relatively few differences between the genders with regard to working conditions (except for among those who do not work).\nFigure II shows the average time spent on paid work each day. Around 30% of men and 35% of women did not work or no longer worked at all during May 2020.

For example, during the first lockdown, women who spent between six and eight hours per day on paid work also spent more than two hours doing housework. Men in the same situation only spent\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\nparticularly cooking as a result of the closure of canteens and restaurants, and housework due to the more continuous presence of adults and children in the home or the increased sanitary measures to be taken. This difference between the two periods with equivalent working time is significantly more marked for women, which demonstrates their greater over\u2011investment during the first lockdown.\nThe type of professional activity is also linked to the amount of time spent on housework (Figure IV). Men and women who do not have a job, whether they be not working, unemployed or in technical unemployment due to a cessation of business brought about by the health crisis, or on leave at the time of the survey, report a higher average amount of time spent on household chores than those who are actively employed.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 202212\nThis discrepancy is more pronounced for women than for men. The amount of time spent on household chores is fairly similar for those who are working, whether that be on site, full\u2011time from home or alternating between the two. It therefore does not appear that the commuting time reclaimed by remote workers has been reassigned to household chores.\nWith the given work situation and other char\u2011 acteristics, on average, people devoted an equivalent amount of time to household chores during the first and second lockdowns, with the exception of those working on site, who devoted more time to household chores during the first lockdown, particularly women working on site who even spent more time on household chores than women who were working from home. They may also have had to do more laundry and cleaning so as not to risk infecting other household members. This fairly surprising finding could stem from the unobserved char\u2011 acteristics of these on\u2011site workers during the first lockdown. For example, some may have non\u2011standard schedules, allowing them to perform more tasks during the day, or a need to over\u2011invest in the household during a period in which they were the only ones not at home all the time. This finding could also be linked to the possible difficulty in accounting for time spent on household chores when the boundaries between the professional and private spheres become blurred. For example, those working from home could have performed household chores in short bursts, such as during tea breaks, or while working. This porosity between activ\u2011 ities makes it more difficult to quantify the amount of time spent on household chores and may result in this being under\u2011reported by homeworkers. The available data, which are less precise than the data from the French Time Use survey (Box 3) do not support these interpreta\u2011 tion paths. Aside from women who work on site, the minor differences observed between the two lockdown periods in the amount of time spent on household chores for those with an equivalent work situation demonstrate that the changes in their working conditions have broadly contrib\u2011 uted to the changes in their involvement in housework."

            "text": "The family configuration (couple life, family size and the age of children) influences both the amount of housework to be done and the possibility of sharing tasks between the various members of the household (Figure V).\nOrdinarily, the presence of children increases the amount of housework required, particularly when they are young. This phenomenon was also observed during the health crisis. Women who were living with a partner and had one or more children under the age of 12 reported the highest average amount of time spent on housework, followed by those living with a partner, but whose youngest child is over 12, then single mothers. Women living with a partner devote more time to domestic chores than those who do not live with a partner, taking on more than the additional chores associated with the fact that they are living with another person. The circumstances surrounding the first lockdown exacerbated these differences: mothers performed even more household chores, particularly those with children under the age of 12 (all else being equal, on average, they devoted almost three hours per day to housework) and single mothers (two and a half hours on average). Mothers and women living with a partner but without children spent almost half an hour more each day on housework during the spring than in the autumn. However, the amount of time spent on housework by single women without children did not change during the health crisis.\nDuring the first lockdown, men living with a partner and fathers of young children partici\u2011 pated far more than usual with the housework, spending more than two hours per day on this, compared with one and a half hours during the second lockdown, the same as men living with a partner but without children. In other family configurations, it was primarily the women who took on the additional household chores required as a result of the increased needs of the other members of the household. During the second lockdown, the participation of men was no longer dependent on their family situation, as is usually observed (Champagne et al., 2015). Therefore, the over\u2011investment of fathers has not continued, and the assumption of a return to normal appears to have been confirmed."

All else being equal, there was no significant difference in the amount of time spent on house\u2011 work by women during the first lockdown based on their standard of living. Conversely, during the second lockdown, the amount of time spent on household chores fell in line with the standard\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 2022 13\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\nof living, and was significantly reduced when compared with the first lockdown for women in the wealthiest households. The latter were no doubt \u2013 once again \u2013 able to outsource a certain number of chores; something that was almost impossible during the first lockdown. For men, on the other hand, the average time spent on household chores varied little based on their standard of living during both the first and second lockdowns. Regardless of their standard of living, the amount of time that they spent on housework during the first lockdown was higher than that observed during the autumn, but did\nnot vary significantly based on their standard of living.\nThe findings are similar for other social stratifi\u2011 cation indicators, such as their level of education or their socio\u2011professional category (Figure VI).

Those with the highest level of\nBox 3 \u2013 Measuring time on the basis of self\u2011declarations Different methods can be used to measure the amount of time spent on household and parenting activities (Solaz, 2009). Activity diaries, used by Time use surveys, are the most reliable and objective method. People use the activity booklets to make a note of the way they used their time over one or two days using time intervals (usually 5 or 10 minutes). A duration is obtained by adding together the amounts of time spent on the various household activities performed throughout the day. This collection method is not particularly sensitive to memory and social desirability biases and limits measurement errors. However, such surveys are fairly costly, and response rates are sometimes low due to the significant amount of effort required on the part of the respondent. Another method that can be used is to ask the respondent how much time they think they spend on average doing housework or a particular task. The findings are less precise and undoubtedly objective, but are less costly to obtain. This is the method that was used for the EpiCov survey used for this study. Methodological studies comparing the two types of measurements have observed that self\u2011reported times may be greater than those measured using activity diaries (Bianchi et al., 2000). It is likely that respondents are including time spent doing housework simultaneously with other activities (Juster & Stafford, 1991; Kan, 2008). The discrepancy between the two measurements may be greater when working hours are irregular and when the amount of time spent on housework is small (Robinson, 1985; Gershuny et al., 2005). Gender-based differences do not appear to be consist\u2011 ent. Women are better than men at reporting the amount of time they spend on housework in Britain (Kan, 2008), but this is not the case in Norway or Denmark (Bonke, 2005).\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\neducation devoted less time (around 20 minutes less per day) to housework than during the first lockdown. For men, the same was true of income: their degree of participation in household chores remained the same, regardless of their level of education. On average, they devoted a little more than an hour and a half per day to housework (so an hour less than women). No significant difference was observed between the first and second lockdowns with the exception of men with secondary level education, who participated less during the second one.\nDuring the first lockdown, and still while checking individual, professional and family characteristics, no changes were observed in the average amount of time spent on household chores by women according to their socio\u2011 professional category, which is at odds with what is observed outside of the context of the pandemic, where the amount of time spent on housework decreases as their position in the social hierarchy increases (Brousse, 2015). However, this social gradient re\u2011emerges during the second lockdown. Women in management positions and intellectual professions spent significantly less time performing housework, as was the case for associate professionals and white\u2011collar workers, albeit to a lesser extent. The social gradient was more pronounced among men than among women during the first lockdown, and was more stable: tradespeople and managers spent less time on household chores than associate professionals, white\u2011collar\nworkers and manual labourers. In other words, the spring lockdown did not bring about any differences in participation in household chores for men depending on their social categories; however, it erased social categories for women."

This stability of parenting time in the case of typical working hours is linked to the fact that the care that women provide cannot be compressed. Although men participated more in parenting during the first lockdown, their degree of investment was largely determined by their working hours: the more hours they worked, the less they helped out, and there was no plateau as was the case for\nwomen. This finding is consistent with what has been observed in other national contexts. In other words, parenting time is less flexible for women than it is for men. Regardless of their professional constraints, women devoted more time to their children. Nevertheless, fathers also took on double the amount of daily work during the first lockdown. Parenting time decreased significantly in November 2020 when compared\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 2022 17\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\nwith the spring, regardless of the amount of time spent doing paid work, following the same trend as was observed for housework. The lower limit was around two and a half hours per day for men, regardless of whether they spend between six and eight hours per day on paid work, or more.\nAmong those who do not work, no difference was observed in the time devoted to children, regardless of whether they were unemployed or on leave, particularly during the first lockdown (Figure VIII). Parenting time is longer and men experiencing technical unemployment or on leave during the first lockdown took advantage of the time this freed up in order to look after their children, approximately five hours per day on average. Based on their working conditions, men working full\u2011time from home devoted more time to their children during the first lockdown, although the differences between them and those working on site were not significant. Regardless of their working conditions, working fathers and mothers alike devoted more time to their children during the first lockdown than during the second (one hour more per day for those working full\u2011time from home).\nThis parenting time is, of course, strongly linked to the family configuration, particularly when the children are young10 (Figure IX). The care and educational supervision that a child requires varies depending on their age. During the pandemic, mothers living with a partner with at least one child under 12 and single mothers devoted significantly more time to their children than mothers living with a partner with one or more older children, regardless of the period, but more so during the first lockdown. Parenting time was particularly long during the first lock\u2011 down for mothers of children under 12, who spent five and a half hours a day looking after their children on average, compared with less than four and a half hours a day in November. Single mothers also devoted a great deal of time to their children, but there were no significant differences between the two periods, and they spent slightly less time than mothers living with a partner. The latter finding is unexpected, since single mothers are not able to rely on a partner to reduce the burden of looking after children. The smaller amount of parenting time spent by mothers who live alone when compared with those living with a partner during the first lock\u2011 down could be linked to the fact that the children from single\u2011parent families were older11 or more independent.\nThe same trends are observed for men: the differences in time between the two periods are\nlarge for fathers of preschool or primary school children, while the differences are small for other family configurations. For both men and women alike, the time devoted to children over the age of 12 did not change between the two lockdowns, since they are more independent when it comes to school work and leisure time.\nIn normal times, social differences are usually a little less marked for parenting time than for time spent doing housework: the women with the highest levels of education spend just as much time or even more time with their children, while they spend less time on housework than those that are not as well\u2011educated (Sayer et al., 2004). This relationship between the level of education and parenting time was also observed during the first lockdown: all else being equal, women with a secondary and higher education spent more time with their children than those with a lower level of education, with all mothers with a tertiary qualification spending the same amount of time with their children on average (Figure X), which demonstrates the value placed on education and good parenting standards by the most highly educated people during the first lockdown, that were relaxed during the second lockdown. The relationship between the level of education and parenting time therefore follows an inverse U curve. The trends among men are different, with very little difference being observed based on their qualification and among the most educated; however, those who a priori have more egali\u2011 tarian standards participated less than the others during the first lockdown, which is at odds with what is usually observed (with the exception of men without qualifications). This lesser involve\u2011 ment by the most educated men during the first lockdown, a phenomenon that was also observed in Germany (Kreyenfeld & Zinn, 2021) may result from their more demanding professional constraints (tasks associated with managing a team remotely, for example). Finally, it is for those with a secondary education and those who have completed two years of higher education that the difference in parenting time between the two periods is the greatest, which is indicative of their greater involvement during the spring lockdown.\nWhile there is no income gradient for parenting time for men, the differences are more marked for women, particularly during spring 2020. All\n10. This parenting time is also linked to the number of children (Pailh\u00e9 et al., 2019b) but we have decided to focus on the age of the eldest child to limit crossover and keep the number of subgroups reasonable. 11. Our models do not check the age of the children in single-parent households for staffing reasons.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 202218\nelse being equal, the parenting time devoted to children was higher during the first lockdown for women belonging to the wealthiest households (above the 6th standard of living decile). These are also the women for whom the amount of time devoted to children fell the most between the first and second lockdowns, most likely as a result of heavier use of paid childcare or outsourced activities (extra\u2011curricular activities, for example) at that time.\nFor men, there are clear differences based on socio\u2011professional category: whether during the first or second lockdown, white\u2011collar workers report the highest parenting times, followed by associate professionals. These differences across socio\u2011professional categories are less marked among women, with the exception of manual labourers, who devoted less time on average to their children during the first lockdown, with equivalent activity, perhaps because their partner was not working (manual labourers, with whom they are often paired as a result of social homogamy, were the most likely to have been experiencing technical unemployment), or because they are less well\u2011equipped for super\u2011 vising their children\u2019s school work since, on average, they have a poor level of education. With the notable exception of female manual labourers, the socio\u2011professional category has no impact: both men and women alike devoted significantly more time to their children during the first lockdown than during the second. Those who are in managerial or intermediate\nprofessions saw the largest reduction in the amount of time they devoted to their children between the first and second lockdowns. Regardless of the social stratification indicator used, it was the most privileged mothers who increased their parenting time the most during the first lockdown, whether that be because some had time when they would normally have been at work freed up, because their child\u2019s normal (extra\u2011curricular) activities were no longer possible, because childcare services were closed or even because they over\u2011invested in caring for their children to prevent them from spending too much time in front of a screen (CAFC, 2021).\n* * *\nThe lockdown measures and restrictions on movement put in place to combat the COVID\u201119 pandemic disrupted daily schedules and brought about an increase in housework and parenting. The amount of time that was devoted to these tasks was particularly high during the first lockdown in spring 2020, and that increased housework and parenting workload involved both men and women alike. The decline in time dedicated to household activities in the autumn, which was more marked among men, appears to indicate a rapid return to normal, as S\u00e1nchez et al. (2021) observed in the United Kingdom. The restructuring of people\u2019s time brought about\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 202220\nby the first lockdown therefore does not appear to have had a lasting impact and our starting assumption of a return to normal in the autumn appears plausible.\nLooking after children, and in particular the youngest ones, was especially time\u2011consuming for parents: the equivalent of more than one part\u2011time job. Some time devoted to children cannot be reduced, particularly during the times when schools were closed. However, the length of that time also reveals the weight of good parenting standards, such as that of parental availability to ensure the best possible development of the child (Hays, 1996; Lareau, 2011). The monitoring of school work presented a particular challenge for parents, they invested heavily in their children\u2019s education over long periods of time to provide schooling within the home (CAFC, 2021; Thierry et al., 2021). This parenting time varied more than the amount of time spent doing housework during the lockdowns. It was very high during the first lockdown, but reduced during the second lock\u2011 down in the autumn of 2020 due to the fact that schools remained open and it was once again possible to outsource.\nAs studies conducted in other national contexts have shown, the time spent performing house\u2011 hold and parenting tasks was highly sensitive to people\u2019s occupational status and working hours, with this being the same during the first and second lockdowns. Time availability, the assignment of which was exogenous during the first lockdown, played a key role in the amount of time allocated to household chores. However, contrary to the theoretical predictions, this difference in time spent on household chores based on occupational status does not have the same impact on men and women. Indeed, it was more marked for men than for women. This greater flexibility of time spent doing house\u2011 work around time spent doing paid work has only been observed for men within the context of the pandemic, the increase in time spent on household chores in the event of unemployment generally being higher for women than for men. The exceptional period of the first lockdown, which was marked by a complete retreat into the home, increased needs and a change in the conditions under which paid work was carried out, which may even have involved the complete stoppage of work, resulted in men investing an unprecedented amount of time in household chores. Due to their initial low investment, men had a greater margin for increase, whereas women were already close to the limit of what it is possible to do.\nThe increase in time spent on household tasks was seen in all socio\u2011professional categories. During the first lockdown, women belonging to higher social classes performed more house\u2011 work than normal, to the point that the social differences usually observed in the performance of domestic tasks were eliminated during this period. The extra time spent on housework by the most educated women when compared with the least educated was greater for French women than for German women, but less than for Spanish women (Farr\u00e9 et al., 2021; Kreyenfeld & Zinn, 2021). Those with the highest level of education typically rely more heavily than others on outsourcing housework, and their standards as regards home maintenance are more flexible. They were the least affected by the lockdown measures (CAFC, 2021). Parenting time, which usually depends little on the level of education, was actually higher for mothers with the highest levels of education during the first lockdown.\nIn spite of the occupational status of both men and women becoming more similar \u2013 and the reduced potential for outsourcing housework \u2013 women continued to perform the bulk of household chores. The amount of time spent by men on household chores has certainly increased, but to a lesser extent, such that the gender\u2011based distribution of housework has only been slightly affected as a result of this exceptional situation. Gender\u2011based differences were still prominent: with the same working hours or with identical occupational statuses, the differences between men and women remained. Although the amount of available time played a part in this, gender roles still explain a large proportion of the time spent on household chores, both during lockdown and in normal times. In addition, these findings indicate that gender\u2011based differences are more resistant to change than social differences.\nAlthough, in terms of available time, working hours remain a key factor in determining the amount of time invested in household and parental tasks, the differences between the sexes remain, even when their work situation is the same. The available time theory alone therefore cannot explain the allocation of time that was observed during lockdown. The fact that the most educated women and those in higher social classes participated particularly heavily in housework during the first lockdown suggests that their resources did not allow them to negotiate greater involvement by their part\u2011 ners. However, in the absence of couple\u2011level data that would allow for the examination of the distribution of the relative financial resources of each partner, it is not possible to test the relative\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0 536-37, 2022 21\nHousework and Parenting during the Lockdowns in France\nresources theory in this case. Finally, the fact that the gender\u2011based differences persist far more than social differences demonstrates that the weight of gender norms is heavy, even in situations where the professional activities of men and women are more evenly matched. This joins many other studies that demonstrate the resilience of gender norms, in keeping with the theories based on gender roles. This resilience is particularly evident when it comes to the types of tasks that are performed by men and women\n(Blair & Lichter, 1991; Tai & Treas, 2013). Men generally perform occasional tasks, which may be organised based on their availability, while women are more likely to take on the less pleasant, more time\u2011consuming, repetitive and routine tasks. This need for permanent avail\u2011 ability is added to by all of the work they do in organising family life and anticipating and taking care of the needs of others, which was especially burdensome during the lockdown periods.\nLink to the Online Appendix: https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/fichier/6477744/ES_Pailhe\u2011et\u2011al_Annexe\u2011en\u2011ligne_Online\u2011 appendix.pdf\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAdams\u2011Prassl, A., Boneva, T., Golin, M. & Rauh, C.

Francesca Marchetta**\nAbstract \u2013 Stay\u2011at\u2011home policies during the COVID\u201119 pandemic challenged household members who faced forced cohabitation and increased housework (domestic chores and childcare). Based on individual data collected online from partnered women during the spring 2020 in France, we study the lockdown effects on housework division and conflicts between partners. We find that during the lockdown, couples experienced minor changes in the allocation of housework, mainly carried out by women. Simultaneously, men increased their participation in the production of household goods mainly through \u201cenjoyable\u201d or \u201cquasi\u2011leisure\u201d activities. Our results suggest that the gendered connotation of domestic work can be context\u2011dependent and not stable over time. Tensions between partners, reported by women, increased during the lockdown, and appear to be strongly correlated with an unequal division of housework. Overall, our results suggest that this period did not structurally affect the gender stereotypes at home.\nJEL: D13, J12, J13, J16, J22 Keywords: COVID\u201119, housework, childcare, intrahousehold tensions, gender roles\n* Universit\u00e9 de Namur, CRED; ** Universit\u00e9 Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI.

            "text": "COVID\u201119 pandemic, the first lockdown in spring 20201 harshly affected and challenged couples\u2019 activities and organization. The effects of forced and constant presence at home impacted the quantity of domestic chores and childcare (Farr\u00e9 et al., 2021; Del Boca et al., 2020), the occurrence of domestic tensions (Biroli et al., 2021), and even intimate part\u2011 ner violence (i.e. Arenas\u2011Arroyo et al., 2021; Beland et al., 2021). Helplines observed a dra\u2011 matic rise of distress calls in western countries (Leslie & Wilson, 2020; Bullinger et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2020) as well as in developing countries (Ag\u00fcero, 2021; Perez\u2011Vincent & Carreras, 2020). In France, 13% of couples (and 16% of those with children) reported more frequent disputes (Barhoumi et al., 2020), police interventions for family disputes rose by 44%, and the number of calls to helplines for domestic violence doubled.2 Furthermore, 49% of couples reported tensions or conflicts over the housework during the lockdown, and one\u2011third of the women who reported frequent disputes suffered from verbal abuse.3\nIn this paper, we address two intertwined research questions: (i) Did the lockdown induce a redistribution of housework within couples? And if yes, in which tasks did men increase their participation? (ii) Is there a relation between the occurrence of conflicts and the unbalanced sharing of housework during the lockdown?\nWe use original data that we collected, via an online survey between April 21 and May 10, 2020 in France, from 2,844 partnered women. These data are not representative, since the women in our sample are younger, slightly more educated and more active in the labor market than French women on average. This survey provides fine\u2011grained information, based on women\u2019s perceptions. They self\u2011reported their own and their partner\u2019s contribution to housework, and the occurrence of conflicts in their couple before and during the lockdown.4 The analysis takes into account the couples\u2019 confinement status, i.e. whether each partner continued to work at their workplace, or was at home, working remotely or in a status of reduced activity.\nWe find a reduction in the gender gap in partic\u2011 ipation in housework among couples who experienced an important increase of the home production (i.e. those with children) and for who women kept working, whether from home or at their workplace, during the lockdown. For totally confined parents, the change was driven\nmainly by fathers\u2019 participation in \u201cenjoyable\u201d or \u201cquasi\u2011leisure\u201d activities during lockdown (shopping and playing with kids). This finding suggests a feeble effect of the lockdown on housework division between partners.\nThis also indicates that individual preferences play an important role in shaping intrahousehold equilibrium. When the quantity of household public goods that need to be produced increases and the opportunities for leisure are reduced, men\u2019s preferences have a crucial role in deter\u2011 mining the new equilibrium. The increase in the men\u2019s contribution to activities that became a \u201cquasi\u2011leisure\u201d in the lockdown period, indicates that the gendered nature of a task could respond to its relative attractiveness rather than being an absolute feature. This finding confirms Stratton\u2019s finding that men\u2019s preferences drive their commitment to household tasks (Stratton, 2012).\nFor couples with children, we also find that conflicts increased when the gender gap in the distribution of household activities increased during the lockdown. We document that this increase in tensions is mainly associated with an increased gap in the contribution to the task of cleaning, known as one of the most time\u2011 consuming and less enjoyable domestic tasks.\nOur paper first contributes to the literature on the gendered division of production of public goods within households, and in particular on the relationship between gender preferences and the within\u2011couple variation of household tasks division over time. We also relate to the economic and sociological literature analyzing the link between the occurrence of conflicts and the allocation of tasks between partners, and between men\u2019s participation in household activities and the risk of separation. We show that an increase in the unbalanced division of\n1. The first announcement of the lockdown, on March 12, 2020, imposed the closure of kindergardens, schools and universities for an unspecified time. Other restrictive measures followed, announced on March 16, 2020: going out of home was limited to essential activities, such as food shopping and working (when working from home was unfeasible, e.g. for \u201cessential workers\u201d), plus the possibility of going out for a walk or physical activities for at most one hour per day within a one\u2011kilometer radius from home. 2.

Finally, we contribute to the emerging literature on the effects of stay\u2011at\u2011home policies during the COVID\u201119 pandemic. To the best of our know\u2011 ledge, our paper is the first in the literature to explore the link between the division of house\u2011 work and the occurrence of conflicts between partners during the confinement period and the only one that looks at the partner\u2019s involvement in specific household activities for France.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 1 provides a brief review of relevant literature, then Section 2 presents a concep\u2011 tual framework where the possible effects of lockdown on the division of household tasks and on the probability of conflict occurrence are presented. Section 3 describes our original dataset and illustrates the empirical strategy. The results are presented in Section 4, then we conclude."

            "text": "The fact that women carry out a disproportionate share of housework \u2013 the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d \u2013 is well established in the empirical literature. The asymmetric allocation of housework between partners has also been largely highlighted since the seminal theoretical papers by Becker (1965) or Gronau (1977). Despite a large reduction of the gender gap in the labor market, women continue to perform most of the housework (see a literature review by Lachance\u2011Grezla & Bouchard, 2010). Besides time availability, many unobservable factors, such as social norms, stereotypes or preferences, remain and are shaping the gender gap across cohorts. Exploiting changes in the labor market partici\u2011 pation of partners, Killewald & Gough (2010) and Foster & Stratton (2018) show that recently unemployed men increase their share of house\u2011 work, but to just around half of the time devoted by women to them. \u00c1lvarez & Miles\u2011Touya (2019), exploiting a specific feature of the Spanish Time Use Survey, provide evidence that men increase their contribution to housework in their non\u2011working days, but to a lesser extent than women.\nAs observed by Kahneman et al. (2004), house\u2011 hold tasks differ in terms of pleasantness and physical effort. Van Berkel & De Graaf (1999) show that cooking and shopping are considered enjoyable housework by men and women, while both dislike cleaning. This is in line with Shaw\n(1988), who found that cooking was among the preferred tasks by both partners. Empirical work on housework often distinguishes between \u201cfemale\u2011type housework\u201d or chores, which includes laundry, housecleaning, washing dishes and cooking, and \u201ctotal housework\u201d. Shopping is included in the second category, together with gardening, pet care and other tasks that can be considered as semi\u2011leisure (Kahneman et al., 2004). Using an experiment, Couprie et al. (2020) investigate the influence of gender stereotypes and find that partners overspecialize in specific tasks in accordance with gender role. Interestingly, Stratton (2012) shows that the more men dislike doing housework, the less they are committed to it and the more time their partner spends on it. Gender preferences could thus drive the involvement of the partner in housework.5\nThe literature also points to interactions between the housework division, marriage stability and the risk of separation. Sociological empirical work shows that the risk of separation is lower in couples where the man is more involved in domestic chores and childcare (Cooke, 2006; Sigle\u2011Rushton, 2010; Ruppanner et al., 2018). Norman et al. (2018) find that fathers\u2019 involve\u2011 ment in childcare in the first year after birth is associated with couple stability, but this is not necessarily so with other tasks. Altintas & Sullivan (2016) and Van der Lippe et al. (2014), show that frictions about housework division among partners are one of the main sources of marital conflict.6\nThe COVID\u201119 pandemic and lockdown have logically incentivized issues and research about housework division. Several studies have docu\u2011 mented the increase in the number of hours allocated to domestic chores and childcare, and the change in couples\u2019 behavior. In Spain, Farr\u00e9 et al. (2021) show a slight increase in male partners\u2019 share of housework, but also that women still do most of it. They also show that the increase in men\u2019s contribution to house\u2011 work was mostly concentrated on shopping. In Italy, Del Boca et al. (2020) find that men increased the time spent on gratifying tasks, such as activities with children, rather than the time spent on chores. Andrew et al. (2020), using data\n5. Van der Lippe et al. (2013) suggest that gender preferences for house\u2011 work also matter for outsourcing. Conversely, Auspurg et al. (2017) find little evidence of any systematic gender difference in preferences. 6. There is also evidence of a negative association between psychologi\u2011 cal distress and the distribution of housework among partners (Lennon & Rosenfield, 1994; Kalmijn & Monden, 2012; Harryson et al., 2012). Carlson et al.

In France, public transfers for partial unemployment in France were equivalent to 72% of the wages, and could not fall below the minimum wage. Furthermore, in the extraordinary situation, many employers maintained the same income (completing the public transfers). Partial unemployment concerned 25% to 30% of French workers during the first two months of the pandemic. 11. This assumption can also be seen as a natural by\u2011product of the fact that home working saves on commuting time, which is not included in the time constraint of each parent. 12. We do not consider here the particular case where both parents were working at their workplace during the lockdown. For most couples in this situation both partners worked in the health sector; the increase in the need of production of public goods was lower, as childcare was provided for their children in French schools and kindergartens. 13. If one of the parents works outside, then he or she would have an advantage in the provision of some specific public goods implying to go out, such as shopping.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202232\nrelationship between the variations in the utility of partners, home\u2011production of house\u2011 hold goods and intrahousehold conflicts. The reduction in the opportunities for leisure, the increase in the home production of household public goods and the variation in (paid) work hours and conditions during lockdown clearly induced an (inward) shift of the utility possi\u2011 bility frontier of the households. Partners were forced to negotiate a new equilibrium on this new possibility frontier. The point that describes the level of utility of the two parents during the lockdown can correspond to a different (absolute or relative) variation in each partner\u2019s utility with respect to the pre\u2011lockdown equilibrium. We hypothesize that, if either the woman or the man (or both) perceives the new equilibrium (corresponding to an abrupt change and not to the outcome of repeated interactions in a stable setting) as unfair, tensions could arise from attempts to induce a movement along the (new and lower) utility frontier. During the lockdown, a variation in the time devoted to the home\u2011production of public goods, and in the allocation between the partners of the tasks with a higher leisure component, represent the two main ways to move along the utility possibility frontier of the household. Conflicts could thus be associated to the perception by one of the partners to make a disproportionate contribution to the home\u2011production of public goods (while possibly not benefiting from a reduction in her own labor supply compared to her partner), and notably for those tasks that have a low or non\u2011existent leisure component.\nIn the article, we draw from Section 2.3 the test\u2011 able assumption that different outputs in terms of housework division depend on the type of working shock experienced in the couples. When the lockdown shock is asymmetric, the partner whose time constraint is the most reduced or benefiting from the technological shock of remote working will provide most of the increase in the home production. We can empirically verify this assumption on couples in which only one partner worked outside during the lockdown or for those at home but with different employ\u2011 ment statuses. When the shock is symmetric, i.e. both faced the same working conditions (remote working or not working), the redistribution of housework is driven by preferences for leisure. If men derive a greater utility for leisure, they should be more involved in activities with higher leisure components, while women should provide most of the increase in home production. We can empirically test this prediction on both (temporary) unemployed or remote working\npartners. From Section 2.4, we empirically test if changes in the home production division lead to an increase in conflicts among partners during the lockdown. We notably assume that highly unequal division of housework drives conflicts."

We finally rely on 2,844 women who reported back\u2011 ground characteristics (location, age, education, and activity status before and during lockdown). The same background information is reported for their partners.\nBecause of the participants\u2019 self\u2011selection and the absence of a sampling strategy, this is not a representative sample of women. Indeed, beyond the fact that all of them live in couple, the sample differs notably from national\u2011level figures in some other characteristics (see Table A1 in Appendix). First, it includes 40% of graduated\n14. A first version of the survey was developed by Lidia Farr\u00e9 (Universitat de Barcelona) and Libertad Gonzales (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) with the aim of collecting early data on the labor market and intrahouseholds relationships during the lockdown. For France, we developed our survey, named Enqu\u00eate sur l\u2019Impact \u00e9conomique et social du Covid\u201119 sur les M\u00e9nages (EICM), using online tools. Similar surveys were carried out in Italy, Germany and Austria. The French and the Italian versions of this sur\u2011 vey included detailed questions to parents on children\u2019s time use, and the French survey included some questions on the conflicts between partners during the lockdown. Our survey also provides information on parents\u2019 evaluation of children learning process and emotional well\u2011being, and on distance learning methods, analyzed in Champeaux et al. (2022). 15. Using Facebook Ads Manager (FAM) allowed us to promote our survey and to amplify our audience. Most of the information was collected during the last two phases of the survey campaign (80% of the sample). 16. This might reflect a greater interest of women in the topics of the survey.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 33\nCouples in Lockdown: \u201cLa vie en rose\u201d?\nwomen compared to 24.4% among women aged 25 to 64, according to national statistics from INSEE. This might reflect a particular interest of highly educated women in the survey\u2019s topics. We consider this by weighting to correct for the representativeness of the lowest educated women.17 Second, it over represents women active in the labor market: 80.5% in our sample, vs. 76.7% in the population of French women aged 25 to 49. The women in our sample are also younger, with an average age of 37 vs. 43.318 in the French population. Finally, 57% of them have a child; this makes two\u2011child families also over\u2011represented in our sample, leading to a potential overestimation of the childcare burden during the lockdown. Otherwise, thanks to the sample size and the dissemination of the survey, the geographical location of respondents across regions is close to that of the metropolitan French population (except for Paris and its region, and the Auvergne Rh\u00f4ne\u2011Alpes region). Aware of these specific characteristics, we underline that our results only refer to this population sample."

The response included six modalities: 1\u2011 always me; 2\u2011 me most of the time; 3\u2011 my partner and me equally; 4\u2011 my partner most of the time; 5\u2011 always my partner; 6\u2011 another person. Only a minority of respond\u2011 ents selected the sixth modality (less than 1% either before or during the lockdown, except for cleaning before the lockdown, with 4.4%).\nWe use these responses to build measures of the woman\u2019s participation in the production of household goods. Specifically, we respec\u2011 tively assign the values 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0 to the first five modalities,20 and the value of 0.5 (i.e. equal sharing) to the sixth modality.\nFor each housework task and childcare activity, we then obtain a value from 0 to 1, that indicates the woman\u2019s share in the task. Correspondingly, the man\u2019s share is considered as the reverse of the woman\u2019s involvement. For example, if woman declares that she takes care of the task\nmost of the time, we consider her share of the task being 75% and partner\u2019s share 25%.\nWe also build two general indexes obtained by computing the average of the woman\u2019s partic\u2011 ipation in all activities; the first index is only composed of domestic chores, the second adds childcare.\nWe denote Shareit the share of housework done by women, that can be measured for each of the three scopes of the indicator: (i) the woman\u2019s share of domestic chores; (ii) the woman\u2019s share of domestic chores and childcare (for women with children); (iii) the women\u2019s share of work for each one of the household activities.\nConfinement status \u2013 To take into account the different types of situations that were possible during the first lockdown, we differentiate four \u201cconfinement status\u201d: 1\u2011 both partners working outside (at their workplace); 2\u2011 the woman working outside; 3\u2011 her partner working outside; 4\u2011 both partners staying at home. In this last situ\u2011 ation, we further distinguish more in detail the combination of (temporary) unemployment and teleworking: either both partners teleworking, or both temporary unemployed, or one teleworking and the other \u2013 the man or the woman \u2013 tempo\u2011 rary unemployed.\nConflicts \u2013 Each respondent was asked whether the occurrence of conflictual situations with their partner had changed during the lockdown compared with before. Five responses were proposed: much more frequent, a little more, not different, a little less, much less. Based on this question, we create a dependent variable named Conflictit, that takes the value one for the period t0 or t1 in which the woman experienced the highest conflictual situations. Therefore, if the occurrence of conflicts decreased during the lockdown, the dummy is equal to 1 in t0 and 0 in t1. Conversely, Conflictit is equal to 1 at time t1 and 0 for t0 if the occurrence of conflicts increased. For a couple that did not experience any change in conflict\u2019s occurrence, the dummy is equal to 0 in both t0 and t1.\nBeyond these three central variables, the survey also provides information on the employment status of the respondent and her partner before and during the pandemic, on their respective contribution to the total household income, and on some other household characteristics.\n17. All our results (available upon request) remain stable when unweighted. 18. See https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2381476. 19.

            "text": "and Conflicts\nAs mentioned earlier, the lockdown may have strongly affected the production of household goods, because of the increase in the time spent at home and the disappearance of outsourcing options (especially childcare with the closed schools). Table A2 in Appendix presents the main descriptive statistics based on our sample of partnered women, before and during the lockdown. Before the pandemic, women with children devoted 80 minutes more to domestic chores than those without, but both reported a similar increase of about 3 hours in such activ\u2011 ities during the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, the time spent in childcare considerably increased during the lockdown, from 2.5 to 10 hours, i.e. four times higher.21\nFigure I shows that women did most of the housework before the pandemic and the lock\u2011 down did not change this situation, as the gender gap remained positive in each activity.22 This is consistent with other research using represent\u2011 ative data (e.g. Barhoumi et al., 2020; Pailh\u00e9 et al., 2022). Gender gaps were already higher before the lockdown for couples with children (see also Figure A1 in Appendix), indicating that women take the additional burden due to the presence of kids. Couples with children experienced on average a substantial reduction of the gap in shopping activities, while fathers also increased their participation in all activities except cleaning. Conversely, in couples without children, men did not increase their share for\nmost tasks, except for shopping which presents the greatest change. This is similar to the results of Mangiavacchi et al. (2021) in Italy and Farr\u00e9 et al. (2021) in Spain, where the gender gap on shopping became negative during the lockdown. Cooking and shopping (and playing with kids for couples with children) are the activities in which men were already more involved before lockdown. This stylized fact might illustrate the leisure component of some tasks and a differ\u2011 ence in preference for leisure between genders.\nFigure II illustrates the change in the gender gap in housework by confinement status for all couples (for children related activities only couples with children are used). We observe a higher reduction in the gender gap in the group where only the woman worked outside during the lockdown. Conversely, the gender gap increases for all activities when men worked outside, except shopping. Figure II also shows a very small reduction in the gender gap for some activities when both partners were in the same situation (i.e. working outside or both at home). This illustrates the heterogeneity of the division of housework across confinement statuses and the necessity to consider the couple\u2019s confine\u2011 ment status in our empirical strategy.\nConcerning conflicts, Figure III shows that most women reported that there was not any change in the frequency of conflicts with their partner. However 28% of those with children and 22% of those without reported an increase.\n21. The survey asked no question about activities like changing nappies, bathing, feeding or dressing babies. This could affect the measurement of the distribution of tasks for couples with at least one young child, i.e. 39.4% of the couples with children in our sample. 22. Here, the gender gap is computed as the difference between women\u2019s and men\u2019s shares. When the gender gap is zero, the task is equally dis\u2011 tribut ed among partners, while a positive gap means that women take care of most of the burden.\nFigure I \u2013 Gender gap(a) in housework by task\n.6 .4\n.2 0\n.6 .4\n.2 0\nBefore the lockdown During the lockdown\nLaundry Homework w. children Cleaning Playing w. children Cooking Shopping Laundry Cleaning Cooking Shopping\nGap GapA \u2013 Couples with children B \u2013 Couples without children\n(a) Woman\u2019s share \u2013 Man\u2019s share Sources and coverage: EICM, authors\u2019 online survey collected in France from April 21 to May 10, 2020; partnered women.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 35\nCouples in Lockdown: \u201cLa vie en rose\u201d?\nFigure II \u2013 Gender gap in housework, by task and confinement status\n.6 .4\n.2 0\n.6 .4\n.2 0\n.6 .4\n.2 0\n.6 .4\n.2 0\nBefore the lockdown During the lockdown\nA \u2013 Both partners at home B \u2013 The woman working outside\nC \u2013 Her partner working outside D \u2013 Both partners working outside\nGap Gap\nLaundry Homework w. children Cleaning Playing w. children Cooking Shopping Laundry Homework w. children Cleaning Playing w. children Cooking Shopping\nLaundry Homework w. children Cleaning Playing w. children Cooking Shopping Laundry Homework w. children Cleaning Playing w. children Cooking Shopping\nGap Gap\nSources and coverage: EICM, authors\u2019 online survey collected in France from April 21 to May 10, 2020; partnered women.\nFigure III \u2013 Occurrence of conflicts A \u2013 Couples without children B \u2013 Couples with children\n80 60\n40 20\n0\nLess conflicts More conflictsNo change Less conflicts More conflictsNo change\n80 60\n40 20\n0\nBoth at home Man outside\nWoman outside Both outside\n% %\nSources and coverage: EICM, authors\u2019 online survey collected in France from April 21 to May 10, 2020; partnered women.\nThis difference between couples with and without children is also observed with INSEE data (Barhoumi et al., 2020).

Income inequality between partners (measured by the woman\u2019s con\u2011 tribution to the couple\u2019s total income reported by women) does not appear to change the occurrence of conflicts during the lockdown: around 25% reported more conflicts whether the contribution was equal or not.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202236\nfixed\u2011effects model with two time periods, before and during the pandemic.

The coefficient \u03b80 consequently captures the effect of the lockdown on the distribution of housework when both partners stayed at home and \u03b8s capturing the conditional effect to each s situation. Therefore, we need to interpret total effects as \u03b80 + \u03b8s for each s situation.\n24 In one specification, Lockdownt is also interacted with a dummy (Children) that is equal to 1 if the couple lived with one child or more during the lockdown.

First, as the outbreak affected the whole population in France, we are unable to establish a counterfactual group, which would have helped us to clearly identify the relation\u2011 ships between lockdown, housework division and conflicts among partners.25 In other words, we are not able to assess what would have been intra\u2011 household dynamics during this period without the pandemic. Furthermore, our data only allow observing the division of housework perceived by the respondent, but not the actual housework divi\u2011 sion. Consequently, we can only analyze women\u2019s perceptions on the variations in household task division and conflicts occurrences during the lockdown. In the survey, we asked for retro\u2011 spective pre\u2011lockdown information; this could have induced a recall bias and thus a mea sure\u2011 ment error. We believe that this is not the case because the survey took place only 5 to 7 weeks after the beginning of the lockdown, and because the lockdown induced a really clear\u2011cut change in the daily life. Moreover, although respondents\u2019 time invariant characteristics are absorbed in first differences, our identification strategy fails to capture potential time\u2011variant unobservables, which can both play on housework division and on conflicts, e.g. the respondent\u2019s ability to deal with time constraints. Finally, our results are valid for a specific population of women, living in heterosexual couples, better educated and more often active in the labor market than on average."

In cases (i) and (ii), the time constraint is similar for the two partners, but not in case (iii). We then reexamine more closely the redistribution of the household tasks in each of these situations, limiting the analysis to couples with children, since no redistribution is observed in couples without children where both partners are at home. The results are presented in Figure V. First of all, it is worth noting that, in the vast majority of couples in our sample who stayed at home during the lockdown, both partners were teleworking. There was no redistribution when the father was working from home while the mother was not. This result is symmetric to that shown in Figure IV\u2011B, where the father was the only outside worker of the household. We find an important redistribution\nof tasks in favor of women when they were the only parent working from home, again in line with the results for women who worked outside. Here again, the lockdown effect is then not similar across genders: while men in temporary unem\u2011 ployment increased their participation when their partner was teleworking, women did not. Most interesting are the situations in which the two partners experienced the same working condition: the redistribution was significant but small when both worked from home, while relaxing the time constraint for both created a more substantial redistribution in favor of women.26\n26. Note that couples at home where both partners were unemployed and couples where only the man was teleworking during the lockdown repre\u2011 sent a small part of the sample (respectively 2% and 4.5%). Estimates could be less precise on these subsamples.\nCouples in Lockdown: \u201cLa vie en rose\u201d?\nSo far, we have considered the aggregate shares of domestic work and childcare. Based on our conceptual framework, we now explore the potentially heterogeneous involvement of the partners in different tasks, following the assumption that preferences might drive the tasks redistribution, notably in couples whose partners experienced a symmetric shock on the labor market. In order to understand if some specific tasks are behind the results, we re\u2011estimate Eq. (1)\nwith the woman\u2019s share in each task as outcome. The results are presented in Figure VI.\nWhen mothers were the only one working out of home, their partner\u2019s contribution increased in all tasks, except shopping. This is the situation in which the redistribution is really effective between partners. For couples without children, when the woman was the only one working outside, men only increased their participation in cleaning, thus not inducing a significant redistribution.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202240\nWhile we found an overall no\u2011effect when only men worked outside during the lockdown, we note here that they significantly reduced their participation in the main domestic chores such as cleaning, cooking or laundry, as well as in childcare, while fathers increased their participa\u2011 tion only in shopping. The absence of an overall effect may then result from a reorientation of the type of activities men are involved in. When both partners worked outside, we only find a redistribution in favor of women for homework with children. This is consistent with the previous result of a significant effect of the lockdown on the overall share of housework for couples where both partners worked outside only when child\u2011 care was included in the index. For couples with children where both partners were at home, the redistribution effect is driven only by shopping and playing with children. Looking more closely at couples at home, we remark that the only situ\u2011 ation in which men took care of the activities with a low leisure component (e.g. cleaning and laundry), is when his partner was working from home.27 For couples without children, although the effect on total housework was not significant, we observe a reduction in the woman\u2019s contri\u2011 bution to shopping for confined couples, even if this decrease is smaller than for couples with children in the same situation. We also observe a positive effect of the lockdown on women\u2019s share of laundry when their partner worked outside during the pandemic. Other results for couples without children are non\u2011significant.\nWe can conclude from these analyses that, on average, the lockdown did not result in a large change in the division of housework. The main changes are observed, almost exclusively, for couples with children and where at least one of the two partners was staying at home during the lockdown, i.e. couples who experienced both a significant increase in the production of household public goods and a shock on the labor market. Where only one of the partners worked outside, the other logically increased his or her contribution to all housework activities. The case of shopping suggests a rational assignation of this task to the partner who was already out for his/her work.\nFor couples where both partners were at home during the lockdown, we showed that the reduc\u2011 tion in women\u2019s overall share of housework is mainly driven by couples where the man was not teleworking. This finding confirms the intuition, mentioned in the conceptual framework, that the partner whose time is least constrained takes care of most of the household tasks.\nHowever, gender preferences seem to play a role as well, considering the leisure dimension (in\nthe context of the lockdown) of the task \u2013 shop\u2011 ping \u2013 in which men increased their participation. In a situation where people were only allowed to go out for essential tasks, shopping became an interesting activity for those staying at home, a kind of leisure, and may have represented an escape from forced cohabitation. The case of shopping during the lockdown suggests that the \u201cgender\u201d of a task could be context\u2011dependent rather than being a stable, essential feature.28"

            "text": "and Conflicts Occurrence\nWe explore now whether the harmony between partners has been affected by the lockdown. As mentioned earlier, this period represented a sudden shock in the household environment. We assume that the process of renegotiation about household goods production led to an increase in tensions.\nThe results of the estimation of Eq. (2) are presented in Table 2. We firstly show results for the full sample (col. 1 to 2) then distinguish between couples without and with children (col. 3 to 5). We find that the occurrence of conflicts increased on average for all the couples during the lockdown (col. 1). However, only couples with children experienced more conflicts linked to the distribution of the housework during the lockdown.29 Given that, we decide to focus exclusively on couples with children.\nTo clearly depict our main findings (col. 5), Figure VII represents the results across the confinement situations.30\nFirstly, we observe a significant and positive rela\u2011 tionship between women\u2019s share of housework\n27. The results on the various working situations of partners at home, not presented here, are available from the authors upon request. 28. An alternative explanation for the increase in men\u2019s participation in shopping might exist. Shopping could have been considered a risky activity due to the pandemic, and men could have assumed their traditional role of \u2019protector\u2019 of the family, taking the risk upon themselves. In this scenario, shopping was likely to become a male\u2011connoted task and the household\u2019s choice was to conform to social gender roles (Couprie et al., 2020). 29. For couples without children, we find that only an extremely unbal\u2011 anced housework division was associated to a significant increase in the occurrence of conflicts between partners when the woman was at home. However, very few couples were in such a situation. When the woman was working outside, no increase in conflicts due to housework division is observed. These results are available upon request. 30. Due to the interaction terms in the Eq. (3), \u03b8 captures the effect of the lockdown on conflicts when both Shareit and Statuss are equal to 0. The \u03b2 measures the average effect of the division of housework during the lockdown. As Shareit is a continuous variable from 0 to 1, and in order to obtain the total effect, we need to carry out non\u2011linearity analyses for each value of Shareit. Moreover, as we included interaction terms between the lockdown dummy and the couple\u2019s confinement status, we also need to interpret each situation during the pandemic. For couples with both partners at home (Status0 = 0, the reference), this means interpreting total effects \u03b8 + \u03b2 \u00d7 Shareit, and computing the combined coefficients\u2019 values and stand\u2011 ard errors for each potential value of Shareit. For couples in other status, total effects are interpreted as \u03b8 + \u03b2 \u00d7 Shareit + \u03b8sStatuss.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 41\nCouples in Lockdown: \u201cLa vie en rose\u201d?\n(i.e. domestic chores and childcare) during the lockdown and the increase in conflicts regardless of the couple\u2019s confinement status. When both parents worked outside, the effect is significant and positive only for an extremely unequal sharing, i.e. where the woman carried out almost all the housework. Only a few couples (161)\nwere in this confinement situation. When only the father was working outside, the turning point of the mother\u2019s share of housework, i.e. from which we observe a significant effect on conflicts, is lower than in the previous situation, suggesting a lower tolerance for an unequal distribution of tasks in this case.

Sources and coverage: EICM, authors\u2019 online survey collected in France from April 21 to May 10, 2020; partnered women.\ncouples in this subgroup experienced conflicts because of the prevalence of an unequal house\u2011 work division during the lockdown. Finally, when the father stayed at home (i.e. either when both parents stayed at home or only the mother was working outside), even a slightly unbalanced housework division led to increase the conflicts during the lockdown. The threshold from which the woman\u2019s share of housework increased the occurrence of conflicts does not differ between couples with both partners at home and couples where the woman was the only one working outside (respectively 60% and 56%). However, the magnitude of the effect is different, more substantial when only the father stayed at home, as expected.31\nWe now explore the specific case of both partners at home, distinguishing teleworking and (temporary) unemployment. The results, presented in Figure VIII, show that conflicts are linked to an unequal division of housework only when women worked from home.\nThe estimation results of the role of each activity in the occurrence of tensions among at\u2011home parents and a graphical presentation are provided in Appendix 2. We remark that an increase in the woman\u2019s participation in any household activity during the lockdown increased the occurrence of conflicts between partners. Remarkable differences emerge across activities, with the magnitude of coefficients systematically higher and the slope steeper for cleaning and for the two activities related to children. The results32 are similar for couples in which one of the two partners worked outside during lockdown, while conflicts increased in couples where both parents worked outside only in the case of an unequal division for the activity \u201cplaying with children\u201d.\nAll in all, these results suggest that an unequal division of housework was more likely to result\n31. The results are similar when only domestic chores are considered (cf. Table 2, col. 4). 32. Not presented in the paper but available upon request.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 43\nCouples in Lockdown: \u201cLa vie en rose\u201d?\nin increased conflicts during the lockdown when only the mother was working outside or when both parents stayed at home and the mother was teleworking. In these two situations, women experienced an intense time constraint (combining work and increased domestic tasks) which may have led to tensions with the partner over the distribution of housework. This would be consistent with the assumption, made in Section 2, that the necessity to negotiate a new equilibrium in a short period could increase the risk of conflicts. We also show that conflicts particularly increased when mothers increased their share of cleaning and childcare (see Appendix 2). Being the most time consuming task, cleaning is also one of the chores with the lowest leisure component and the highest female connotation. It is likely that mothers were unsat\u2011 isfied with an equilibrium where their partners carried out the most pleasant tasks, and conflicts appeared as a mean to renegotiate a better sharing.\n* * *\nThe allocation of housework within couples is typically stable over time, with a gendered connotation of a large number of tasks (Akerlof & Kranton, 2010). However, the COVID\u201119 epidemic, and the ensuing lockdown adopted in spring 2020, have brought a sudden and unprece\u2011 dented shock to this stable allocation. The quantity of household tasks increased and challenged the partners\u2019 abilities to respond to the shock. At the same time, the disappearance of most leisure opportunities may have led to changes in the attractiveness of some household tasks, given their possible \u201cquasi\u2011leisure\u201d connotation. Furthermore, in addition to the increased burden of housework, the anxiety about the pandemic, its evolution and its economic consequences, the disruption of social life and a forced cohabitation also contributed to an increase in the likelihood of the occurrence of violence (Arenas\u2011Arroyo et al., 2021) and tensions between partners.\nBased on an original conceptual framework and data collected in France during the spring 2020 lockdown, our results suggest no drastic changes in housework division between partners. Women remained the main provider, notably in activities with a low leisure component. Substantial heter\u2011 ogeneities are observed according to the presence of children in the household, the confinement status of the couple and the employment status of the individual. As drawn in the conceptual frame\u2011 work, we empirically show that the redistribution became more favorable to women only when the two partners experienced an asymmetric shock\non the labor market and women had a tight time constraint (i.e. when the mother worked outside and the father at home or the mother worked from home while the father was temporarily unem\u2011 ployed). Facing a sizeable increase in household tasks, it is likely that fathers who were at home during the lockdown felt compelled to increase their share of household tasks. Nevertheless, when possible (i.e. when their partner was also at home), they increased only their share in activ\u2011 ities already considered as enjoyable (especially playing with kids) or that became in the context (such as shopping). Compared to the other tasks, shopping was also a highly noticeable activity for the other household members during the lock\u2011 down and could help the protagonist to bargain his lower involvement in other housework.\nOur results also suggest that conflicts between partners in couples with children increased with the share of household activities carried out by women, particularly when men stayed at home during the lockdown. Most of the increase in conflicts were related to childcare and cleaning, suggesting that the unequal division of work in these activities could be perceived by women as less acceptable in the context. As expected, the renegotiation of the production of household public goods on a short period of time is associated for women to an increase in the perceived occur\u2011 rence of conflicts with their partners, in particular when men\u2019s involvement is low in less pleasant activities, like cleaning.\nBased on the perceptions of a population of relatively highly educated and active women, we show that men behave following their gender role. However, they adapt to the contingent situation. A female\u2011connotated activity like shopping became an almost exclusive prerogative of males when it gained in attractiveness. The gendered nature of a task does not seem stable and responds to its changing attractiveness. Male preferences seem to drive the division of house\u2011 hold activities between partners, and the choice of domestic activities in which they engage, notably depending on their leisure component, is not neutral on the harmony between partners.\nAll in all, the lockdown does not seem to have redefined gendered roles at home or induced a structural change of the housework division. These findings shed light on the importance of gendered preferences as well as time constraints to understand what barriers remain for an equal housework division between partners. With the recent development of remote work in many sectors, further research is needed to investigate mid and long\u2011term effects of such situations.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202244\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAg\u00fcero, J.

Both reveal that family arrangements appeared generally flexible, since time use changed significantly in the context of the crisis, leading to men becoming much more involved in household chores and parenting in particular. However, far from being unprece\u2011 dented, this flexibility is compatible with a traditional division of roles according to gender. The changes observed may result from a model of domestic production in which the man plays the role of a secondary worker who can be mobilised in the event of the unavailability of the primary worker, the woman. Decisions made by families in France are still anchored to gender norms; not only does this constitute a waste of resources, it also generates temporal inequalities that may manifest as intra\u2011family conflicts.\nJEL : J16, D13, I31 Keywords: Domestic production, parental time, intra\u2011household decision\u2011making\n*Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LEST, Aix\u2011en\u2011Provence.

Of all of the upheavals experienced at this time, one has attracted particular attention: the near\u2011 universal switch to remote working blurred the line between people\u2019s professional and pri\u2011 vate lives. The closure of schools and nurseries during the first lockdown increased the paren\u2011 tal burden and would have encouraged men\u2019s involvement in the home, contributing to shat\u2011 ter the thin and artificial boundary between these two worlds.\nThis interweaving of the family and professional spheres is nothing new, nor is it unknown. Family life (children, partner) generates a set of constraints and opportunities that have their share of consequences on the professional lives of those involved. Such constraints most often affect women, whose role remains largely devoted to the family, in accordance to the norms governing gender\u2011based distribution of roles in society. The difficult balance between family life and professional life is, in fact, widely used to explain gender inequality on the labour market.\nThe inverse relationship, from job characteristics to intra\u2011family arrangements, requires a study into the private sphere, whose functioning is far less observed. Family arrangements informally determine the terms of those productions said domestic (housework and looking after chil\u2011 dren). Family is a key element in the production of living standards as well as in the reproduc\u2011 tion and transmission of human capital. Unpaid domestic production, which is poorly observed, uses time as its primary resource, a common denominator that is visible and measurable, subject to compromises and conflict between family and professional lives which are deeply intertwined.\nMany European countries take action to facili\u2011 tate the coordination of these two areas. In this regard, France ranks among the most generous countries (Th\u00e9venon, 2008). It has high fertility rates coupled with a high level of women\u2019s participation in the labour market. However, Goodin et al. (2008) temper this finding of the effectiveness of the French welfare state: based on the concept of temporal autonomy, the authors find that gender inequality is particularly marked when it comes to discretionary time1 (a difference of 5 hours on average in France in 1998 compared with just 1 hour in Germany).2\nMoreover, the socio\u2011fiscal system does not seem to reduce the significant temporal inequalities within families in which both partners work. Regardless of the measure adopted, the unequal distribution of domestic work between men and women in France was, and still is, the norm. It creates huge inequality within couples in cases where both partners work (Ponthieux & Schreiber, 2006). Women still take on the bulk of the domestic work, even if they are more productive than their partner and invest more of their time in paid work (Sofer & Thibout, 2015). One thing is for sure: some of the public or private means of outsourcing domestic production, which reduced intra\u2011family temporal inequalities between men and women, became unavailable as a result of the lockdown imposed during the COVID\u201119 crisis."

            "text": "The articles by Ariane Pailh\u00e9, Anne Solaz and Lionel Wilner (referred to as PSW below) and by Hugues Champeaux and Francesca Marchetta (referred to as CM below) in this issue both analyse the impact of the COVID\u201119 crisis on time use within families. Indeed, the crisis constituted an exogenous contextual change of unprecedented magnitude. Observing the behaviours adopted by families in response to this crisis provides valuable insights into intra\u2011family arrangements and their possible disruptions. Such studies are of interest for a number of reasons. First, they provide valuable recent descriptive data on the distribution of time within families in France. They contribute to the literature measuring the economic and social impacts of the COVID\u201119 crisis. Finally, they provide basic insights into the way in which families function.\nIn particular, the exogeneity and the magnitude of the shock that affected the majority of house\u2011 holds makes it possible to observe the impact of context variables the variation of which can usually only be observed by comparing different households. However, the measure of the inherent impact that variations in context between households have on behaviour is usually blurred by the fact that the context is in part chosen by the households themselves\n1. Discretionary time is time that can be spent as chosen. It is defined as the total amount of time available during a week (168 hours) minus the time needed to meet economic needs (number of working hours required in order to reach the poverty line), social needs (half of the median time spent on housework, cooking, shopping and looking after children) and biological needs (4/5ths of the median time spent on personal care and sleep). 2. See Goodin et al. (2008), Figure 3.1.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536\u2011537, 2022 53\nComment \u2013 Did the COVID\u201119 Crisis Contribute to a Change in the Gender\u2011Based Division of Work within Families?\n(through intra\u2011household negotiation inter\u2011 actions or couple formation). Consider, for example, the impact of remote working. It is possible to compare the distribution of domestic time between households working on site and households in which one member is working from home. However, such a measure would not allow identifying the impact of remote working, since work from home can be chosen based on objectives related to time use (e.g. working from home on a Wednesday to take care of children). This issue of endogeneity does not arise here and is one of the key elements of value added of the two articles.\nHowever, the methodology applied differs between the two articles. PSW rely on a set of cross\u2011tabulations based on the longitudinal EpiCov survey, which is representative of the French population and was conducted during the two lockdowns in 2020. CM use multivari\u2011 ate regressions, isolating the specific impact\nof the context from the results of a one\u2011off survey, based on a non\u2011representative sample of women with partners. The information on the pre\u2011lockdown situation is based on retrospective question. PSW compare the two lockdowns interpreting the second lockdown as a return to normal. In both cases, the information about time use was collected in a minimalist manner, via a question requiring an individual evaluation. PSW do not have any informa\u2011 tion regarding the partner, whereas CM have unilateral information about the intra\u2011family sharing of tasks. This second article is better equipped to identify the lockdown impact on intra\u2011family arrangements, while the first article is more robust, and provides an overview of the heterogeneity of the impacts for different types of family.\nThe main context impacts considered in the two articles are outlined in the Diagram below.\nDiagram \u2013 Comparison of the context impacts measured by the two articles\nFirst lockdown Schools: largely closed Nurseries: largely closed Outdoor recreation: almost zero Remote working: widespread High over-unemployment\nSecond \u201clockdown\u201d Schools: classes sometimes cancelled Nurseries: reduced capacity Outdoor recreation: reduced Remote working: encouraged Low over-unemployment Before Schools: normal Nurseries: normal Outdoor recreation: normal Remote working: rare No over-unemployment\nCM 2,866 women with a partner, retrospective,\nindividual domestic time, distribution within the couple and conflicts\nPSW 8,000 to 10,000 people, all types of\nhousehold, longitudinal, representative, individual domestic time\nThis diagram shows that, unlike during the first lockdown, the context effects of the second lockdown are relatively close to the pre\u2011crisis situation; however, their magnitude differs within each sub\u2011dimension.\nWhat about the multi\u2011dimensional nature of the shock? Based on recent theories on intra\u2011family decision making, the authors identify different transmission channels through which the shock of the first lockdown could have changed domestic time (household tasks and parenting) and its inter and intra\u2011household distribution. The closure of schools, nurseries and restaurants would have contributed to an increase in family needs in terms of domestic production. At the same time,\nunemployment, a reduction in commuting time and reduced leisure opportunities outside the home created more available time for domestic production, with potential differences between the household members. The emergence of remote working is, for its part, likely to have brought about a change in domestic production technology, allowing for an intensification of time use, which also amounts to an increase in resources in terms of available time.3 In short, the first COVID\u201119 lockdown gave rise to more family needs, but also more individual\n3. The authors mention other channels, such as a change in the valuation of domestic time (shopping preferences, etc.).\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536\u2011537, 202254\ntemporal resources. Variations in needs depend on the structure of families, whereas variations in temporal resources depend on the employment situation of individuals. There is therefore a change in the distribution of temporal resources. Family and individual effects combine in the \u201cblack box of intra\u2011household decision\u2011making\u201d, leading to behavioural changes in the way in which time is used.\nImpacts of Lockdown on the Use of Time by Men and Women: Major Impacts, but No Role Reversal"

            "text": "the first lockdown generally brought about a significant increase in the amount of time devoted to domestic chores and parenting. For domestic chores, the median impact was around +15 to +30% per person. The amount of time devoted to parenting increased in even greater proportions, but with considerably different magnitudes between the two articles.\nTime spent on housework and, particularly, on parenting by men appears highly elastic depending on the context variations (increased needs, employment conditions and working hours). The temporal resources gained as a result of partial unemployment, remote working and leave were used in unprecedented ways during the lockdown to increase the amount of time devoted to parenting by men. The amount of time spent on household chores and parenting by women, which was already very high, appeared to be less sensitive to the context impacts.\nIn spite of this, the distribution of domestic chores between men and women changed very little on the whole with the COVID\u201119 crisis. Women continued to take on the bulk of house\u2011 hold chores and parenting duties (especially doing the laundry, teaching children, cleaning and cooking). The increased investment of men observed at the aggregate level comes mainly from an increased investment by men living in couples with children where the woman went out to work during lockdown. In this specific case, unprecedented falls are observed in the proportion of time spent by women on parenting, the distribution of which becomes more equal. For couples where both partners worked, the majority of whom working from home during the first lockdown, the slight reduction in the amount of time spent on domestic chores by women came exclusively from a change in the distribution of time spent on shopping (a type of time subject to changes in valuation).\nPrevious work based on INSEE\u2019s Enqu\u00eates Emploi du Temps (Time Use Surveys) have demonstrated that the amount of time spent by men on household chores and parenting can be more flexible than that of women. This is a surprising finding given what we know about the lack of flexibility in the time men spend on paid work. Ponthieux & Schreiber (2006) observed that the time spent by men on domestic chores increases with the amount of domestic produc\u2011 tion (total housework time). It also increases when the woman is relatively more invested in paid work (higher wage or more working hours). Bloemen & Stancanelli (2014) estimate all direct and cross elasticities of wages for different joint time allocations within couples. They observe that the amount of time spent on parenting and domestic chores by men appears to react posi\u2011 tively to women\u2019s wages;4 this is not the case for time spent on domestic chores and parenting by women, which is very weakly influenced by men\u2019s wages. Conversely, women\u2019s allocation of time (paid work, domestic chores and parenting) is highly dependent on their own hourly wage, whereas men\u2019s use of time is only weakly deter\u2011 mined by their own wage level. In other words, it is the situation of women on the labour market that determines the way in which domestic time is distributed within families, and this is indeed what is observed by CM. This situation is in line with the idea of a gender\u2011based distribu\u2011 tion of roles, assigning the main role in terms of contributing to domestic production to the woman. However, this traditional distribution of roles leaves room for exceptional and reversible adjustments, as shown by CM and PSW as well, in this case with an increase in the amount of time spent outside of paid work by men, which would be comparable in its functioning to the phenomenon of the additional worker, and would be activated in case of unavailability of the main worker.\nThis interpretation is in line with the conclu\u2011 sions drawn by Sofer & Thibout (2015). The absence of a role reversal when the woman is more heavily invested in the labour market than the man reflects the existence of deep\u2011rooted gender norms in the division of chores within households, counteracting the logic of economic efficiency, which predicts that the members of the couple specialise according to their produc\u2011 tivity and comparative advantages rather than their gender (see the literature from the seminal research by Becker, 1965).

A temporary deviation from the social norm can also be a cause of tension and violence. It is extremely difficult and somewhat arbitrary to establish a causal link, but the corre\u2011 lations between lockdown, temporal inequalities and conflicts highlighted by CM undoubtedly point to possible avenues to improve the under\u2011 standing of families function.\nThe economic and societal challenges of stud\u2011 ying the family as a source of production for the current and future well\u2011being of the population are crucial.\nThe conclusions of PSW and CM clearly converge. No, the COVID\u201119 crisis has not helped to change the gender based distribution of\ndomestic chores and parenting within families. The intra\u2011family adjustments observed constitute crisis adjustments. In this sense, families were able to make use of unusual resources, in this case men\u2019s time, to perform the share of the domestic chores that the women were unable to take on.\nWhile it is gratifying to note that the alignment of the distribution of roles with societal gender norms did not prevent intra\u2011family adjustments being made in times of crisis, those adjust\u2011 ments were largely inadequate. Intra\u2011household violence has increased. Could some of these tensions have been avoided if such gender norms limiting behaviour societal did not exist?\nMany of the explanations referred to in this commentary refer to studies based on old data (the last French TUS, the Enqu\u00eate Emploi du Temps, dates from 2010). Regular time use surveys, supplemented by information that allows volumes and preferences for domestic and parental production to be assessed, are essential if we are to learn more about the family sphere functioning. This sphere, the functioning of which is still largely dependent on women, is a major source of gender inequality. Lacking visibility, its role as a shock absorber in times of crisis is worth highlighting and should be recognised.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBecker, G. S. (1965). A theory of the Allocation of Time.

Households are described as eager to move to bigger homes, with large green spaces, in less dense areas. According to a survey by MeilleursAgents (an online real estate platform) in 2021,1 among people who have changed their primary res\u2011 idence since July 2020 or planned to do so before January 2022, one half changed their search criteria to have a garden (39% of them), to be closer to nature (34%) or to live in a smaller city (19%).\nYet, attraction to rural areas is not a new phenomenon. Over the previous three decades, a report from the Observatoire des Territoires (2018) concludes that France has experienced a decrease in population concentration, with big centres losing attractiveness while the surrounding areas attract new inhabitants. According to D\u2019Alessandro et al. (2021), between 2007 and 2017, the average annual population growth was 0.66% in rural areas, but only around half of that (0.38%) in urban areas. The attraction for rural areas seems to be mostly restricted to rural suburban cities. In 2017, 26.9% of people moving from an urban to a rural area moved to a city in the catchment area of a city centre (D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2021).\nIn addition, though yearly residential mobility is higher in France than in Europe on average (11% of the French population moving each year vs 9% in Europe), the Observatoire des Territoires (2018) notes that French people move less and less far since 1990. Three\u2011quarters of movers choose a location close to their current residence (in the same d\u00e9partement). This report also shows that the mobility rate decreases with age and increases with education level, and that managers, professionals and associate profes\u2011 sionals tend to move further, between Paris and other big cities, than clerical or service and sales workers. Housing market constraints prevent all social classes from moving in the same direction or to the same places, which may reinforce social segregation.\nIn 2019, a survey from Ifop2 revealed that 57% of people living in urban areas wanted to leave. Three main obstacles prevented them from taking the leap, specifically, the lack of services (for 60%), the lack of transport infrastruc\u2011 tures (for 53%), and difficulties in accessing employment (for 46%). The use of telework since COVID\u201119 crisis, firstly widespread and mandatory during the first lockdown and then\nmore balanced and negotiated between workers and employers, could remove this third obstacle to urban exodus, at least partially.3 Since March 2020, MeilleursAgents has noted a 13% increase in transaction volume in rural areas.4 This trend also seems to be reflected in the evolution of residential property prices:5 in 2020, Paris experienced a decline in prices, while rural areas experienced a greater increase in prices than the largest cities. The price increase mainly concerns rural suburban areas6 (+9.7% in 2020) and rural areas with a large proportion of secondary homes.\nHowever, can we speak of an urban exodus since the COVID\u201119 crisis? The impact of the COVID\u201119 crisis on the determinants of residen\u2011 tial mobility is obviously an emerging subject in the literature. Based on the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax microdata, Li & Su (2021) observe that, since the COVID\u201119 pandemic, Americans both moved from imme\u2011 diate dense surroundings of city centers to suburbs that are more distant with lower density, and from high\u2011density population metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to low density MSAs, thus partially counterbalancing the spatial sorting. They then use a spatial equilibrium model to analyze the welfare effects of these migration changes. Ramani & Bloom (2021) use both data from address changes from the"

In other words, households are prepared to move away but not too far. Also relying on Zillow data, in addition to productivity, amenity and industry indices, Brueckner et al.

They also show that telework imposes capital losses on real estate owners in high\u2011productivity cities and capital gains to renters. Furthermore, as remote work reduces commuting costs, they find that it increases disutility for places with high crime rates and high taxes. This phenomenon makes the suburbs more attractive.\nIn the case of France, the detailed and represen\u2011 tative data that would allow analyzing whether the determinants of residential mobility have changed since the COVID\u201119 crisis are not yet available.7 To provide some early answers to this question and contribute to the literature, we turn to an analysis of the change in households\u2019 inten\u2011 tions to move since the start of the COVID\u201119 crisis, based on users\u2019 searches on the real estate platform MeilleursAgents.

We then estimate nested logit models, again separately for urban and rural resi\u2011 dents, to analyze users\u2019 intentions in a sequence where they choose first whether they intend to stay in the same catchment area or to move to another one and, in each options, if they target an urban or a rural city.

It attracts 2.4 million unique visitors per month, with 500,000 online estimates per month made by the users.9 The use of such high frequency data in the academic literature is very recent and promising, since it makes it possible to explore users\u2019 behaviour by following each step of their home\u2011buying project. MA traffic data has already been used by Vidal (2021) to analyze matching and pricing mechanisms on the real estate market. Van Dijk & Francke (2018), Rae & Sener (2016) and Piazzesi et al. (2020) also exploit platform traffic data to calculate market tightness indicators and to analyze market segmentation.\nWe can track users who log onto the MA plat\u2011 form with their user ID, which is required to obtain estimates (but not for consulting ads for instance). The estimation tool is based on a form in which users provide information on their status (owner, owner\u2011seller or buyer), the characteristics of the dwelling estimated and its location. The tool returns a price range for the dwelling. For users who seek an estimate as buyers, the tool is used at an advanced stage of\n7.

Indeed, because users need specific information, they generally use it to estimate the price of a dwelling that they have visited or they are going to visit: they want to have an idea of the price to make an offer close to market price. Consequently, we use these estimations, that reveal a strong intention to buy (but not that the purchase was actually made), as an early information of a buying process.\nIn order to reconstruct an intended mobility path, we select in our database the users who make an estimate both as owner and as buyer. We thus have information on the initial location (from the owner estimate) and on the desired location (from the buyer estimate). Moreover, we have informa\u2011 tion on the characteristics of the current residence and of the searched one (detailed in Appendix).\nThe sample consists exclusively of homeowners. Beyond credit access conditions, income or anticipation of price changes, the choice of occupancy status is influenced by position in the life cycle (see Artle & Varaiya, 1978 for the first theoretical model that introduced life cycle in the determinants of home\u2011ownership). The rate of home\u2011ownership sharply increases with the stabilization of professional situations at the start of a professional career. The birth of children often leads homeowner couples to opt for a house with more space around, with a stable peak zone reached around at 60 years of age. The rate of home\u2011ownership also varies over the territory, with larger shares of owners in the crowns of local hubs, periurban spaces and less densely populated hinterland than city centres (INSEE, 2017).\nWe cannot rule out potential selection bias linked to the use of remote matching tools, either in terms of users\u2019 education or distance between the current and the desired location.10 Unfortunately, we have no information on the characteristics of the users (e.g. age or income) or their household (e.g. number of children living at home) though the literature has stressed their role in explaining residential mobility choices. However, the size of the dwelling and the number of rooms, likely to be correlated with family size, can capture part of this effect. Another data limitation is that the MA website is not used uniformly throughout France, the activity being mainly driven by Paris and other big cities areas. We also need to keep in mind that the increase in website traffic is simultaneous to our period of study."

Firstly, we remove the outliers,\ni.e. estimates for dwellings with a very small (less than 9 square meters) or a very large (more than 250 square meters) surface.

We also remove estimates that return a very low or a very high price, i.e., for which the price is lower than half the first percentile and more than twice the 99th percen\u2011 tile of prices estimated. Finally, to avoid having estimates made by robots in our data set, we remove the percentile of users who made the highest number of estimates in the period.\nSecondly, we account for multiple estimates by the same user. Regarding buyer estimates, if a user made several estimates of the same dwelling, we keep only the most recent one. Regarding owner estimates, if a user made several estimates for the same address in the same city (or for another address but in an iden\u2011 tical area or with an identical number of rooms), we keep the oldest one because it represents the first intention to move. In the event of several searches in the same month by the same user, we keep only the last estimate because we infer that the user\u2019s visits for the previous properties were unsuccessful. Thirdly, among all possible types of property that are estimated (principal residence, secondary residence, dwelling owned for investment purposes), we only keep the esti\u2011 mates done for principal residences.11\nOnce this data processing is complete, we keep all owner estimates (i.e. those who have an intention to move and those who do not) and we merge them by user ID with buyer estimates. As a result, we have information concerning the owner estimate (location and characteristics of the principal residence) and the buyer estimate (location and characteristics of the principal resi\u2011 dence, as well as those of the desired property).12"

We postulate that the typical user first estimates the value of the property they own to have an approximate idea of their maximum budget before starting their search for a new home, and then make estimates for the dwellings they visit to ensure that they are not overpriced.

For that purpose, we use the rural zoning from the Observatoire des Territoires,13 which splits French cities between 4,193 urban cities and 30,772 rural cities based on the INSEE communal density grid. Figures S1\u20111 and S1\u20112 in the Online Appendix (link at the end of the article) map the territorial coverage of our owners and buyers estimates.\nWe also use the INSEE zoning of catchment areas14 to characterize more precisely the intended mobility, accounting for the area of influence of major French cities. A catchment area is a set of municipalities, in a single block and without enclaves, which defines the extent of the influence of a population and employ\u2011 ment pole on surrounding municipalities, this influence being measured by the intensity of commuting. A catchment area is composed of a \u201cp\u00f4le\u201d (cluster) and a \u201ccouronne\u201d (periphery). The \u201cp\u00f4le\u201d is determined with respect to thresholds of population density and employ\u2011 ment level.

Additionally, catchment areas are ranked according to their population size (see Online Appendix, Figure S2\u20112).\nFurthermore, we characterize municipalities using a large range of socioeconomic data from INSEE, specifically the median population income, services and equipment levels (cf.

This number then sharply increased just after the first lockdown to such an extent that it exceeded the level before COVID\u201119, with an average of 108.6 estimates per day against 93. After a decrease during the second lockdown, this number continued to grow until the end of the last lockdown, reflecting an increasingly marked desire to migrate as the pandemic (and the restrictive measures) continue.\nRegarding the place of origin of people with an intention to move, there is almost no difference before and after COVID\u201119. By contrast, we\nobserve an effect on the choice of destination. Searches in rural areas represented 16.7% before the COVID\u201119 crisis and have increased to 20.4% since the beginning of the pandemic. Looking at the sub\u2011periods within the crisis (Table 2), we observe that the rate of searches in rural areas is the highest during the first lock\u2011 down, with 22.6% of searches. It then slightly dropped between the end of the first lockdown and the end of second lockdown, yet remaining above the pre\u2011COVID level. Since then, the attraction for rural areas has been persistent, showing moderate growth. The demand for houses follows a similar trend with respect to the timing of the crisis, showing an increasing desire to live in a house (see Table 3).\nThe analysis of migration intentions (Table 4) shows that urban\u2011urban intentions to move were largely predominant before the crisis with three\u2011quarters of intentions, followed by urban\u2011rural (9.2%), rural\u2011urban (8%) and rural\u2011rural (7.5%) migration. During the first lockdown, intentions of urban\u2011urban migration decreased to two\u2011thirds, essentially due to the simultaneous rise of rural\u2011rural and urban\u2011rural migration intentions. The largest increase over the period concerns urban to rural migration intentions, from 9.2% to 12.2%.\nLastly, we combine the categorization of catchment areas with the intention to move to a rural vs an urban zone.

            "text": "To estimate the effect of the COVID\u201119 crisis on the residential migration intentions, we estimate logit models. Discrete choice models are used in most empirical studies to describe and understand household location choices. In addition to national factors (mortgage, infla\u2011 tion rates, demographic changes and economic context), the literature distinguishes among three categories of determinants. The first concerns the trade\u2011off between prices (and thus dwelling size) and accessibility to employment (Waddell, 1993; Srour et al., 2002; Rivera & Tiglao, 2005; Cornelis et al., 2012). Additionally, the sensi\u2011 tivity to the distance to place of work may vary if remote working is available (Ettema, 2010, in the Netherlands). The second set of determinants groups spatial and social amenities, e.g. school quality (Pinjari et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2005; Bayoh et al., 2006), service density (Zondag & Pieters, 2005), security (Filion et al., 1999), presence of green spaces (Gueymard, 2006) or quality of the neighborhood (De Palma et al., 2005, 2007; Goffette\u2011Nagot & Schaeffer, 2013). The last set of determinants includes household characteristics, i.e., income and household size (Waddel, 1996) and life cycle (Walker & Li, 2007; Habib & Miller, 2007). Regarding all these determinants, Schirmer et al. (2014) notice that household preferences should be compared with the same level of choice. Indeed, in their literature review, Schirmer et al. (2014) point out that early studies used discrete choice models at an aggregated level (choice of zone) but that building\u2011 or unit\u2011level data should be preferred (Habib & Miller, 2009; Lee et al., 2010).\nWe estimate two binary logit models and then a nested logit model, both estimated on two distinct sub\u2011samples, one of urban residents and the other of rural residents. The dependent vari\u2011 able is the location of the target property, and the effect of the COVID\u201119 crisis is captured via the date of the search. We use alternatively only a binary variable equal to 1 if the search occurred after March 12, 2020 (i.e. the announcement of the first lockdown) and 6 binary variables corresponding to the sub\u2011periods defined by the lockdowns (see Appendix 1), the pre\u2011COVID period going from January 2019 to the start of\nthe first lockdown. All the specifications include a wide range of structural and socioeconomic variables describing the origin and the destina\u2011 tion. The selection of control variables is done by elastic net (Zou & Hastie, 2005).\nThe choice of location is made among a set of mutually exclusive alternatives and decision makers choose the alternative that provides them the highest level of utility. Independent variables describe each alternative in terms of location characteristics (socioeconomic envi\u2011 ronment) and dwelling characteristics (area, number of rooms, etc.). As we cannot observe all the characteristics of the alternatives, an error term is introduced in the model (Train, 2003). The nested logit model has the advantage of overcoming the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) problem, which arises when, among a set of alternatives, odds of choosing A over B does not depend on whether some other alternative C is present or absent. Contrary to a multinomial logit model, the nested logit model groups together alternatives suspected of sharing unobserved effects into nests, which sets up the disturbance term correlation that violates the assumption. In other words, alternatives are gathered by groups in which the IIA assumption holds, but it does not hold across groups. These nested logit models can be estimated only if there is a limited number of alternatives. Moreover, a reference alternative needs to be set and all interpretations are relative to this alternative."

            "text": "We then estimate a nested logit model, which has the advantage of allowing for dependence across responses by grouping alternatives into groups called nests (Thurston et al., 2009). It allows for some correlation in the error terms in the same nest, while still assuming that error terms of different nests are uncorrelated. In\nother words, the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives holds within each nest. The choice of the location is such that each indi\u2011 vidual first chooses among the two limbs that represent the choice of intending to stay in the same catchment area or to change to another one and, conditionally on it, the choice of a rural or an urban municipality is made (Figure I).\nIn a general framework (Cameron & Trivedi, 2005), with J limbs indexed by j and Kj branches indexed by k in each limb j, the joint probability pjk of being on limb j and branch k amounts to the probability pj of choosing limb j multiplied by the probability pk j of choosing branch k condi\u2011 tional on being on limb j, i.e.: p p pjk j k j= \u2217 .\nUsing the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, we get:\np p p e e\ne e jk j k j\nz I\nm\nJ z I\nx\nl\nK x\nj j\nm m m\nk j j\nj l = =\n+\n= + =\u2211 \u2211 * *\n' '\n'\n' '\n'\n/\u03b1 \u03c1 \u03c1\n\u03b1 \u03c1\n\u03b2 \u03c1\n1 1\n' /\u03b2 \u03c1j j (5)\nwhere the vector of explanatory variables zj varies only over limbs and the vector of explana\u2011 tory variables xjk varies over both limbs and branches.

Our dependent variable is a binary variable reflecting a change of \u201cstate\u201d (i.e. from one catchment area to another one) so that the estimated coefficients capture the impact of the variables on the probability of this change of state. The control of numerous characteristics of the origin and destination cities enables a precise understanding of the structural and locational characteristics of housing that households look\nfor in another catchment area. Most intentions to move, i.e. two\u2011thirds, target the same catchment area, as shown by descriptive statistics over the whole period, which reflects a strong attachment to the territory of origin because of family, friends or work.\nTable 6 reports the estimation results (odds ratios) for the main variables of interest of binary logit models where the dependent variable is equal to 1 when residents have the intention to stay in the same catchment area and 0 if they have the intention to move to another one.\nFigure I \u2013 Decision tree\nUrban Rural Urban RuralUrban Urban\nUrban resident Rural resident\nSame catchment area Same catchment areaOther catchment area Other catchment area\nRural Rural\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 65\nResidential Migration and the COVID\u201119 Crisis\nThe models are estimated for the sub\u2011sample of urban residents (columns 1 to 3) and for the sample of rural residents (columns 4 to 6).

The pandemic has thus led to a greater desire to move out of the initial catchment area. The category of the municipality of origin or destination has highly significant effects on the intention to stay in the same catchment area, with suburban residents (origin: \u201ccouronne\u201d)\nbeing the most attached to their catchment area, but almost no role on the intensity of the COVID\u201119 effect, as shown by the interaction terms (see column 2). The detailed timing of the crisis shows that the effect of the pandemic is strongly significant in all sub\u2011periods (column 3), except during the first lockdown, which appears as a period of inaction, where people may either have had difficulties project ing into the future or been waiting for the end of the lockdown to start a real estate project, probably due to the possibility to visit properties again."

The\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202266\ncontinuing crisis results in a reinforced desire for mobility for urban residents.\nFor the residents of rural municipalities (col. 4 to 6 of Table 6), the decrease in the probability to stay in the same area is less pronounced in the period since March 2020 overall. We estimate that since the beginning of the crisis, the odds for a rural resident to search for a dwelling in the same catchment area rather than in another one is 0.892 times lower. This effect is essentially driven by searches made after the end of the third lockdown, the only period for which the associ\u2011 ated coefficient is significant at the 1% threshold.\nWe complete the analysis by estimating logit models where the binary dependent variable is the intention to move to an urban vs a rural city, still separately for the urban and rural sub\u2011samples. Table 7 reports the results for the\nvariables of interest related to COVID\u201119 and the category of the municipality of origin or destination (the detailed results are available from the authors).\nFor urban residents, the odds to search for a residence in an urban rather than a rural city is 0.923 times lower since the beginning of the pandemic (Table 7, col. 1); it drops to 0.644 for a resident from a p\u00f4le searching for a residence in the p\u00f4le also when interactions are introduced between the COVID\u201119 dummy variable and the category of the municipality of origin or destination (col. 2). This appeal for rural areas is more pronounced since the end of the second lockdown (col. 3), as reflected by the decrease in the odds ratios (Figure III).\nBy contrast, the crisis has no impact on the probability of choosing urban over rural\nFigure II \u2013 Probability of staying in the same catchment area (Odds ratios)\n01/01/2019 - 11/03/2020 12/03/2020 - 10/05/2020 11/05/2020 - 27/10/2020 28/10/2020 - 15/12/2020 16/12/2020 - 30/03/2021 31/03/2021 - 02/05/2021 03/05/2021 - 20/09/2021\n1 0.924 0.929\n0.886\n0.883\n0.91\n0.776\n0.917 0.905\n0.818\n0.958\n0.876 0.846\n(significativity in bold)\n3rd lockdown2nd lockdown1st lockdown\nUrban Rural\nFigure III \u2013 Probability of choosing urban over rural (Odds ratios)\n01/01/2019 - 11/03/2020 12/03/2020 - 10/05/2020 11/05/2020 - 27/10/2020 28/10/2020 - 15/12/2020 16/12/2020 - 30/03/2021 31/03/2021 - 02/05/2021 03/05/2021 - 20/09/2021\nUrban Rural\n1\n0.802 0.902\n0.939\n0.872 0.849\n0.754\n1.092\n0.913\n1.082\n0.945 0.899\n1.111\n(significativity in bold)\n2nd lockdown1st lockdown 3rd lockdown\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 67\nResidential Migration and the COVID\u201119 Crisis\nmunicipalities for rural residents (Table 7, col. 4 to 6). This strong result thus establishes that the COVID\u201119 crisis generated a change in prefer\u2011 ences of location, but only for urban residents.\nTo complete the analysis, we have also estimated a multinomial logit model detailing the category of the city of destination (centre, periurban area \u2013 couronne \u2013 and rural zone \u2013 hors attraction des p\u00f4les) to explore whether it influences the inten\u2011 tion to move (the results, not presented here, are available from the authors). The interaction of the category of city with the COVID\u201119 dummy appears significant only for the subsample of urban residents, for periurban areas (couronne) vs centre. This means that, since the COVID\u201119 crisis, urban residents living in city centres are\nmore inclined to move than those living in periurban areas.\nFinally, we analyze the estimation results of the nested logit model. The first level choice is between staying in the same catchment area or moving to another one. Conditionally to the choice of catchment area, the choice is then between moving to an urban or to a rural munici\u2011 pality. In other words, residents decide whether to stay close to their job and conditionally posi\u2011 tion themselves on the urban\u2011rural gradient. The reference category is moving from the initial catchment area to a rural area. Table 8 reports the results for the variables of interest related to COVID\u201119 and the category of municipality of origin or destination (the detailed results with\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202268\nall control variables selected by elastic net are available from the authors).\nSince the beginning of the crisis, the odds that a resident from an urban area searches for a residence in the same catchment area rather than in a rural city in another catchment area is 0.887 times lower for a rural destination and even lower for an urban destination, with an odds ratio of 0.861 (Table 8, col. 1). In other words, since the beginning of the crisis, urban residents are less likely to intend to stay in the same catchment area, especially to buy in an urban area, rather than change catchment area to buy in a rural area. These changes are mainly driven by searches after the third lockdown (Table 8, col. 2). Indeed, the only significant and low coefficient appears for the joint choice of moving to an urban city\nin the same catchment area. The strongest effect after the third lockdown could be explained by the increased awareness that the sanitary crisis and the associated restrictions could settle durably. Another explanation could be that there was less compliance with the restrictions related to the second and third lockdowns than during the first lockdown, which may have questioned the authorities\u2019 ability to manage the health crisis and generated a feeling of anxiety about the future, and in turn, a greater desire for change.\nThe results are less significant for rural resi\u2011 dents, although they still show a reduction in the probability of intentions to stay in the same catchment area since the COVID\u201119 crisis, even more pronounced after the end of the last lockdown.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 69\nResidential Migration and the COVID\u201119 Crisis\n* * *\nUsing owner and buyer estimates from the MeilleursAgents platform, we were able to reconstruct migration intentions over the period from January 2019 to September 2021, and thus to analyze how the COVID\u201119 crisis has changed the location preferences in France. Descriptive statistics show that after a time of shock during the first lockdown, the number of buyer estimates exceeded the pre\u2011COVID level and has continued to grow afterwards, which might reveal more intentions to move. The demand for houses and real estate located in secondary locations (\u201cp\u00f4les\u201d, \u201ccouronnes\u201d) and outside of the attrac\u2011 tion poles has increased relatively significantly since the beginning of the pandemic while it is the reverse for city centres that may appear less attractive. Our estimations of logit and nested logit models make it possible to isolate the post\u2011COVID effect on both the intention to change one\u2019s catchment area and to move to rural areas. We indeed observe a clear trend towards an urban exodus, as the odds that an urban resident searches for a residence in an urban city rather\nthan in a rural city is 0.644 times lower since the beginning of the pandemic for households coming from a pole and searching for a residence in a pole. Both urban and rural residents are also more inclined to leave their catchment area to relocate further away, which may have been facil\u2011 itated by the development of telework. Finally, we show that since the beginning of the crisis, urban residents are more likely to seek housing in a rural city in a different catchment area.\nWhile our data provide advanced information on migration intentions in real time, they provide no information about users and reflect an activity on the website mainly driven by the Paris area and areas of other big cities. Our sample is reasonably representative, but the analysis could also be extended to renters and first home buyers, who were not included in this analysis. Next steps would also consist in carrying out an inference causal analysis of COVID\u201119 and better characterizing migrations using a gravity model. Finally, we could use the catchment area zoning in greater detail in order to test whether the results from Ramani & Bloom (2021) hold in the case of France.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nArtle, R. & Varaiya, P.

More precisely, we explore whether household demand for residential proper\u2011 ties has been impacted by this crisis. Based on data on property transactions recorded between 2016 and 2021, we compare the evolution of prices before and after the crisis. The comparison is done between municipalities within urban areas on one hand, between urban areas on the other. Within urban areas, we show that the less dense municipalities that are farthest from the centre are also those where prices have risen the most. This reflects the desire among households for more spacious properties on the outskirts of urban centres. The results of the analysis of the evolution of prices between urban areas suggest, in line with urban economics theory, that a change in dynamics has occurred in favour of the least productive agglomerations.\nJEL: R14, R21, R31, R41 Keywords: COVID\u201119, housing prices, property markets\n*Universit\u00e9 Paris\u2011Est Cr\u00e9teil, ERUDITE (EA 437) and TEPP\u2011CNRS (FR 2042); **Universit\u00e9 Paris\u2011Est Cr\u00e9teil, ERUDITE (EA 437); Universit\u00e9 Paris\u2011Est Cr\u00e9teil, ERUDITE (EA 437), CEET and TEPP\u2011CNRS (FR 2042).

For households, the lock\u2011 downs and the development of tele working, which have had an impact on both the profes\u2011 sional and private spheres, have in particular led to a reconsideration of the choice of residential location and/or the characteristics of desired housing. On this latter point, the Qualitel 2020 Barometer1 on the aspirations of French people in terms of space and interior design shows for example that households living in an apartment would like to have a house (58%), a garden (82%), a terrace or balcony (79%), larger rooms or a greater number of rooms. However, these characteristics are more often those of housing located outside urban centres, where prop\u2011 erty prices are relatively more affordable, but which may be further away from jobs. In this respect, the health may have modified or rein\u2011 forced aspirations already present, as working remotely made the need of proximity between housing and work more flexible."

Working remotely, which was introduced on a large scale during the first lockdown (involving 40% of companies), led to a reconsideration of the link between place of residence and place of work. It also seems to be a lasting change in working conditions: at the end of the first lockdown, nearly 26% of employers said they wanted to continue the prac\u2011 tice (Duc & Souquet, 2020). More than a year after the start of the pandemic in the summer of 2021, the proportion of people regularly working remotely in the Paris region was 42%, which is twice the figure for 2019 according to a study by the Institut Paris R\u00e9gion (Brajon & Leroi, 2022). On average, the same trend is observed in OECD countries, although with strong differ\u2011 ences across countries, as shown by a recent\nstudy based on job advertisement data (Adrjan et al., 2021); in particular, their results show that restrictions related to the management of the health crisis increased the prevalence of working remotely in job offers more than the relaxation of those restrictions has reduced it.\nThese different elements lead us to questions on the effects that the COVID\u201119 crisis may have on the location choice of household and, consequently, on property markets and territorial and urban dynamics. Household preferences were directly affected, with an adjustment of the trade\u2011offs between different types of amenities and the increased flexibility of the link between area of residence and area of employment. However, the COVID\u201119 crisis also acted to accelerate location choices that were already evolving following deeper societal questions relating to the climate crisis or work\u2011life balance, for example. The question is therefore whether these changes have \u201ccrystallised\u201d due to the health crisis in terms of location choices and whether they are discernible in property markets in France.\nThere is already a relatively large body of work in the economic literature, particularly based on Chinese and American data. However, at the time of writing this article, we did not find work analysing the effects of the COVID\u201119 crisis on the French residential property market.3 In this article, we therefore seek to explore the potential changes in the dynamics of the French residential property market after the emergence of COVID\u201119 in March 2020: has household residential demand been affected by the shock caused by COVID\u201119 and is it reflected by changes in property prices?\nRelying on urban economics theories, we consider that the pandemic may have had two main effects: on the one hand, within agglomer\u2011 ations, an increase in the demand for space and a decrease in transport costs, which should lead to a change in the land rent gradient throughout urban areas (decrease in the gradients associated with distance and density in absolute values). On the other hand, an increase in the prices in urban areas where productivity is the lowest and in those with the most amenities.\nWe empirically test these hypotheses by stud\u2011 ying the dynamics of residential property prices\n1. https://www.qualitel.org/barometre\u2011qualitel/resultats\u20112020/ 2. https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. 3. Since then, we can cite Breuill\u00e9 et al. (2022) in this same issue, and France Strat\u00e9gie (2022) on the evolution of residential property since the emergence of COVID\u201119, and Bergeaud et al. (2021) on the dynamics of corporate property.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 77\nCOVID\u201119 and Dynamics of Residential Property Markets in France: An Exploration\nin France before and after the start of the health crisis. To do this, we use property valuation appli\u2011 cations (Demandes de Valeurs Fonci\u00e8res \u2013 DVF) from 2016 to 2021. Identification is carried out using a difference\u2011in\u2011differences estimation, as in various works (Brueckner et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Liu & Su, 2021), but we propose a strategy that allows potential differences in trends depending on the level of treatment to be taken into account, as in Dustmann et al. (2022). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this method is applied to studying the effects of the pandemic on property prices.4\nOur results indicate a change in price dynamics within large French agglomerations: the municipalities farthest from the centre and with a low population density experienced a price increase following the crisis. In the short term, reconfiguration effects appear to be less significant between urban areas than between municipalities within urban areas. However, in line with theoretical expectations, there appears to be a reduction in the income\u2011related gradient, with a relative increase in the attractiveness of less productive urban areas compared to more productive ones.\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows: after a review of the empirical literature in Section 1, we present in Section 2 the elements of the theories of urban economics on the basis of which we formulate hypotheses to be tested, then we present the data and the empirical approach of the study. The results are set out in Section 3; we discuss the results and set out our conclusions in a final section."

            "text": "The effects of the COVID\u201119 crisis on household location behaviour have resulted in a variety of work, notably in China and the United States.\nFor China, the study by Cheung et al. (2021) on the city of Wuhan uses property transaction data from nine districts between January 2019 and July 2020 to identify the impact of the crisis on housing prices and household behaviour. The results, based on hedonic price models, reveal that housing prices fell by 5% to 7% after the outbreak of the pandemic and recovered after the lockdown. However, the authors show that the price gradient from the centre to the outskirts of urban areas has flattened. Recent work by Bricongne et al. (2021) reveals a similar trend in the United Kingdom. Based on data grouping together sale prices in online property adver\u2011 tisements and final prices recorded by notaries, they show a decrease of around 80% in property\nmarket activity during the COVID\u201119 crisis. In addition, property prices have increased in rural areas, and decreased near London. These results suggest a change in household behaviour, and a preference for low\u2011density residential areas.\nHuang et al. (2021) extend the previous analysis on China by studying property transactions in sixty cities between January 2019 and September 2020. The results of a difference\u2011in\u2011differences analysis show a negative and moderate effect on property prices but a strong negative effect on transaction volumes, which collapsed just after the emergence of COVID\u201119. Housing prices fell by about 2% on average, but the price of apartments near city centres has fallen more sharply; the authors conclude that the crisis has changed household preferences with regard to their location choices. Finally, Qian et al. (2021) also examine the impact of COVID\u201119 on property prices. Using difference\u2011in\u2011differences models, they find that property prices in regions where COVID\u201119 cases are confirmed would have dropped by 2.5%. This effect persisted for three months and its extent increased over time. However, this effect seems to be observed only in the regions the most affected by the pandemic.\nFor the United States, Gupta et al. (2021) study the variations in prices and rents following the pandemic in the thirty largest agglomerations. They estimate a model in which price is a func\u2011 tion of distance to the city centre, of local and temporal fixed effects and of various control variables measured before the pandemic. They show that prices have continued to rise despite the COVID\u201119 crisis, but more strongly in neighbourhoods located away from the centre than in central neighbourhoods, leading to a significant flattening of the land rent gradient.\nRamani & Bloom (2021) also examine the effects of the COVID\u201119 crisis on property markets and migration patterns in major American cities. To that end, they estimate models in which the change in prices (or population) between February 2020 and February 2021 is explained by changes in population density during the previous period, distance to the centre and fixed effects. Two major facts emerge. First, they highlight a shift in the demand for property (from both households and companies) from the centre to the outskirts of major cities. This is the so\u2011called \u201cdoughnut effect\u201d, which reflects a decline in city\u2011centre activity and a shift to the peri\u2011urban ring. This effect seems particularly\n4.

Next, no movement of this type appears between the major cities considered. The existence of an \u2018intra\u2019 effect, but not an \u2018inter\u2019 effect suggests that the development of working remotely now makes it possible to move away from one\u2019s workplace, but that the persistence of hybrid forms of work (combining working on site and at home) limits the possibility of living too far away and, therefore, in another major city.\nHowever, work by Brueckner et al. (2021) appears to lead to different results. Focusing on inter\u2011agglomeration effects, and concentrating particularly on the effect of the COVID\u201119 crisis on working remotely, they decompose the variations in property prices according to the potential telework of urban areas in the United States. Based on estimates that combine telecommuting potential and a measure of city productivity, their analysis shows that cities with high productivity and high potential for telework have seen prices fall since the onset of the health crisis. However, no significant price change is observable for agglomerations with few amenities and high telecommuting potential.\nFinally, Liu & Su (2021) also examine the impact of the pandemic on demand for housing on the"

Under these conditions, prop\u2011 erty prices decrease continuously with distance to the CBD, while the size of housing per indi\u2011 vidual increases with the distance. In addition, since housing size increases with distance to the centre, population density decreases across urban space.\nBased on the conclusions of the Alonso\u2011 Muth\u2011Mills model, it is easy to understand how the COVID\u201119 crisis can change the existing urban equilibrium. Indeed, the possibility to work from home can alter two major param\u2011 eters of the Alonso model. On the one hand, it decreases the cost of transport to the CBD. Since it is no longer necessary to go to the workplace every day, the cost of transport is reduced at any point in the urban area. Locations close to the centre, which were sought after due to low transport costs, therefore become relatively less advantageous. In other words, the lower the transport cost, the lower the price difference between central and peripheral locations."

This phenomenon is increased due to changes in household pref\u2011 erence in relation to housing size following successive lockdowns. All else being equal, a unit of space then provides a higher utility than before. As housing sizes are fixed in the short or medium term, households will choose to relocate where housing sizes correspond to their demand. This results in valuing locations where space is accessible. Thus, bid\u2011rents will increase in sparsely populated locations. There should then be an increase in prices and population in the areas where space is most accessible, i.e. areas that were originally sparsely populated.\nOn this basis, we retain two initial hypotheses: \u2011 Hypothesis 1: Property prices fall near the CBD and rise in more distant locations. \u2011 Hypothesis 2: Demand increases in sparsely populated locations, leading to higher prices and populations in these locations.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 79\nCOVID\u201119 and Dynamics of Residential Property Markets in France: An Exploration"

The work of Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982) is better able to account for potential price dynamics between agglomerations following the crisis. This work models the trade\u2011offs made by households between the wage they can obtain, the level of amenities they can enjoy and the property price they have to pay in a given region. The wage is set exogenously by the level of productivity of the region and the level of amenities is also assumed exogenous. With a constant level of amenities, the regions with the highest wages must also have high property prices. Conversely, with a constant level of productivity (i.e. equal wages), the spatial equilibrium will be achieved by higher property prices in regions with more amenities.\nThe development of remote working, which is one of the consequences of the COVID\u201119 crisis, has the effect of making the relationship between the place of work and the place of residence more flexible, revealing new spatial trade\u2011offs within the framework of the model set out above. Brueckner et al. (2021) explicitly incorporate the possibility of working remotely in this model, considering that an individual can work in any city without the need to reside there. They show that if cities differ only in their level of productivity, the implementation of remote working will allow a part of the population to move to the least productive city, where the price of property is lower, while continuing to work for a company in the most productive city and benefitting from higher wages. In the end, these migrations will lower property prices in the most productive city, with a loss of population, and will increase them in the less productive city.\nThen, they examine what happens with constant productivity levels, but different amenity levels. The development of telework allows a part of the population to move to the most attractive city in terms of amenities, while keeping their job in the city with fewer amenities. In this case, there will be an increase in price differences between cities. Another mechanism can rein\u2011 force this effect: the lockdowns increased the value attached to certain amenities, for example natural spaces.\nWe thus retain two other hypotheses: \u2011 Hypothesis 3: Prices fall in high\u2011productivity agglomerations and rise in low\u2011productivity agglomerations.\n\u2011 Hypothesis 4: Prices rise in agglomerations with a high level of amenities and fall in agglom\u2011 erations with a low level of amenities."

Table 1 provides an overview of the construction of the samples.\nThe DVF are used to calculate the logarithm of the average price in municipalities (for intra\u2011urban area analysis) and in urban areas (for inter\u2011urban area analysis).\nFor explanatory variables, multiple sources are used: \u2011 The distance to the centre of the urban area is calculated for each municipality using the projec\u2011 tion systems of the French national geographic institute (Institut g\u00e9ographique national \u2013 IGN). The centre corresponds to the central business district in each of the urban areas chosen7 and the distance is a Euclidean distance calculated from\n5. https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/demandes\u2011de\u2011valeurs\u2011foncieres\u2011 geolocalisees/. 6.

This first indicator is used in relation to H1: \u201cproperty prices fall near the central business district\u201d. \u2011 The population density in the municipalities is calculated from the data from the INSEE population census (for the year 2017). This indicator allows us to test H2: \u201cdemand rises in sparsely populated locations\u201d. The median incomes of urban areas are determined using the localised social and tax file (Fichier Localis\u00e9 Social et Fiscal \u2013 Filosofi) for the year 2017. Median incomes will be used as a proxy for the productivity in the urban area8 and thus allow us to test H3, according to which \u201cprices fall in high\u2011productivity agglomerations\u201d. \u2011 We also use indicators of natural amenities in the territories, in relation with H4 according to which \u201cprices increase in agglomerations with a high level of amenities\u201d.9 The amenities of the urban area are determined using the Corine Land Cover database, which provides a biophysical inventory of land use and its evolution, produced by visual interpretation of satellite images according to a 44\u2011item classification.10 On this basis, for the year 2018, we calculate the propor\u2011 tion of municipalities with natural areas and/ or traversed by water courses (rivers and major tributaries) in the urban area. Specifically, we identify the municipalities that have one of these natural amenities and calculate the proportion they represent in the total number of municipal\u2011 ities in the urban area.\nTable 2 presents descriptive statistics for the sample of municipalities and the sample of urban areas. They show that prices increase over time in both samples. Prices also appear higher on average in the sample of municipalities than in the sample of urban areas. This is due to the exclusion of the municipalities in urban areas with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants. The population density measured across the sample of municipalities is higher than that measured\nfor France as a whole (105.5 inhabitants/km2 in 2018). This is also due to the exclusion of municipalities from small urban areas, where the population density is much lower. Finally, the proportion of houses in the transactions is lower at urban area level than at municipality level because of the restriction to these more densely populated areas where apartments are more frequent."

But, as indicated by Brueckner et al. (2020), since the coefficients of interest are related to interactions between variables and the post\u2011COVID\u201119 period, the risk of bias related to their omission is relatively limited.12 Nevertheless, for the intra\u2011urban area analysis, although we use a wide range of fixed effects, identification is based on the assumption that no shock other than COVID\u201119 affects differently housing prices in municipalities depending on their population density or distance to the centre of the area. Our results remain subject to the assumption of the absence of other shocks along\u2011 side COVID\u201119 that would differently affect municipalities within areas on a non\u2011seasonal basis. For example, it could be that the results of the municipal elections at the end of June 2020 led to variations between municipalities, with the establishment of moratoriums on construc\u2011 tion in some cities. However, for this to create a bias in estimates, the establishment of these moratoriums would have to be systematically correlated with the distance from the centre or the population density of the municipalities, which seems unlikely.

We calculate an average, weighted by population in 2017, of price indices at municipality level and we compare the price evolution between municipalities according to distance to the centre (with a threshold of 25 km corresponding to the median distance) on the one hand, and according to population density (with a threshold of 279 inhabitants/km2 corresponding to the median population density), on the other.\nThe evolution of prices is quite close in both groups of municipalities, whether before or after the appearance of COVID (Figure I\u2011A). In contrast, a change is evident in the evolu\u2011 tion of prices according to population density (Figure I\u2011B): they rise more sharply in the most densely populated municipalities over the period 2017\u20112020, then more quickly in the least densely populated municipalities from March 2020 onwards.\nFigure II shows the variation in property prices according to the median income of the urban area, which is used as a proxy for produc\u2011 tivity.

The results ultimately show a relative increase in prices in municipalities which have a lower population density and are farther from the centre."

Reading note: Each additional 1 kilometre of distance to the centre of the urban area is associated with a 1.15% drop in prices in the municipality. After March 2020, the drop in prices is 1.11% (\u22121.15+0.04). Sources: DVF 2016\u20112021; INSEE, 2017 population census.\ndensity by one additional inhabitant/km2 was associated with a price increase of 0.0016% in a municipality between 2016 and March 2020 (Table 3, col. 1). Applying the post\u2011COVID change (col. 5), the same increase in population density was associated with a price increase of only 0.0011% (0.0016\u22120.0005). This suggests that the attractiveness of purely urban amenities, present in densely populated areas, has lessened in favour of greater demand for space.\nThere is also a change in relation to the distance from the municipality to the centre of the urban area. The price gradient associated with distance changed from \u22121.15% for each additional kilo\u2011 metre farther away from the centre to a gradient of \u22121.10% (\u22121.15+ 0.05) after March 2020. The\ndistance to the centre of the area, which repre\u2011 sents a point of interest for households, therefore remains a factor of lower prices, but less of a factor since the start of the pandemic than it was previously. While proximity to the centre is still sought after in the demand for property, it now seems less valued.\nThe results obtained with the flexible specifi\u2011 cations (equation 3) are presented in Figure IV, first with the same controls as in column 4 of Table 3, then in a version where their (linear) price trends before COVID are removed, i.e. the flexible version of the results presented in column 5 of Table 3. The coefficients correspond to the estimated gradient variations compared to the reference period of 2019.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 87\nCOVID\u201119 and Dynamics of Residential Property Markets in France: An Exploration\nAs the previous results suggest, even if the coefficients estimated before the emergence of COVID\u201119 are not always significant, we observe a downward linear trend in the variation of the gradient related to distance (Figure IV\u2011A): before 2020, the distance\u2011related price gradient was lower in absolute value in 2016 than in 2019 and appears to have increased in a fairly linear manner between these two periods; there seems to have been a trend towards concentration around city centres. The year 2020 marks a clear break and a reversal of the trend evidenced by a decrease in the gradient in absolute value. The presence of a trend prior to COVID\u201119 would therefore tend to cause an underestimation of the effects of the pandemic on the distance\u2011 related price gradient. When the previous trend is removed (Figure IV\u2011B), the effects of the pandemic appear even more clearly.\nThe analysis is substantially identical with respect to the evolution of the population density\u2011 related gradient. Here too, there is a clear break in 2020: the trend towards rising prices in densely populated municipalities compared to less densely populated municipalities before the emergence of COVID\u201119 is followed by a clear relative decrease in prices in densely populated municipalities."

When all controls are included (column 5), we see, after the appearance of the COVID crisis, a relative decrease in prices in urban areas where incomes are high, compared to urban areas where they are lower. While urban areas that show strong economic dynamism (measured by household income) remain very attractive and are therefore subject to strong demand for property, these phenomena are less pronounced after the appearance of COVID. This suggests a possible inflection in preferences, with urban areas with more modest dynamics having new appeal. It is likely that initially lower property prices will generate greater demand, which will ultimately contribute to higher prices in these markets."

We estimate the same specifications as those presented in column 5 of Table 3 for municipalities, and column 4 of\nTable 4 for urban areas, varying the start date of the pandemic between 2017 and 2019. The results (see Appendix) show \u2013 reassuringly \u2013 no significant change at the 5% threshold in price dynamics after these fictitious pandemics.\n* * *\nIn this article, we have sought to explore how the pandemic has affected household location choices and residential property markets in France. The results show that, at the intra\u2011urban area level, prices increased relatively more in the least densely populated areas as well as in the areas located farthest from urban centres after the emergence of COVID\u201119, suggesting that households are seeking more space and place less value on the positive externalities that can be produced by a high population density. At the inter\u2011urban areas level, the level of productivity, reflected by the level of income, also partly explains the differences in price variations. In contrast, we do not find any significant effect related to the level of amenities.\nOur results therefore support the expectations of hypotheses 1 and 2, according to which property prices decrease in the centre and increase in the periphery of urban areas, where population densities are lower. They join the results of Gupta et al. (2021) and Ramani & Bloom (2021) based on American data. The former show that the crisis has indeed led to lower property prices and rents in city centres and higher prices in areas away from the centre (flattening this relationship between distance to the centre and prices in most US metropolitan areas). The latter show, in major American cities, a shift (the \u201cdonut effect\u201d) in household demand for property from densely populated city centres towards more sparsely populated suburban locations.\nOur estimates also support hypothesis 3, according to which prices rise in agglomerations with low productivity. This result is in line with those obtained by Brueckner et al. (2021) which show, on the basis of US data, downward pres\u2011 sure on property prices in high\u2011productivity cities following the health crisis and the development of working remotely. In contrast, hypothesis 4, according to which prices would tend to increase in agglomerations with a certain level of natural amenities, is not verified in our estimates. On this point, our results therefore differ from those obtained by Brueckner et al. (2021) showing that property prices have increased in cities with high\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 202290\nlevels of amenities and decreased in cities with low levels of amenities. However, for natural amenities, the authors use a richer set of indi\u2011 cators (differences in temperature, precipitation, proximity to the oceans, etc.), some of these not being available at the level of analysis carried out here. We therefore cannot rule out that the amenities that we take into consideration are not necessarily those for which the value placed on them has changed the most.\nOur exploration also has other limitations that we must emphasise. In particular, we consid\u2011 ered that the pandemic was able to affect the demand for property mainly through two factors: the increased use of telework and changes in preferences related to successive lockdowns. This allowed us to identify a limited number of hypotheses that could then be tested. However, this does not exclude other effects that the pandemic may have had on behaviour related to demand for property: for example, fear of conta\u2011 gion may have increased the psychological costs of transport. In this case, households would opt for locations close to the centre or would give preference to the use of a private vehicle, with an additional cost. This could then mitigate changes in the price gradient across the urban space. It is also not possible for us to distinguish between the respective effects of the two potential factors, or to say that they are precisely the ones that explain the observed evolutions of prices. Deeper societal changes, particularly in relation to work\u2011life balance, may contribute to some of the changes just as much as changes directly caused by the crisis. If this is the case, the health crisis may have acted as an accelerator, leading households to concretise mobility projects they already considered before COVID.\nKeeping these limitations in mind, it would nevertheless seem that, at intra\u2011urban area level, we are witnessing a strengthening of\nthe phenomenon of peri\u2011urbanisation that has already been under way for several decades. The effect observed on the prices of the residential property markets of distant and sparsely popu\u2011 lated municipalities suggests that it is primarily individuals who can work remotely, who are often executives and have strong economic and cultural capital, that have flocked to peri\u2011urban municipalities. Therefore, in addition to an effect on property prices, these potential changes in the social composition of the inhabitants can ultimately have consequences on the overall economic dynamics of the municipalities. This can lead to gentrification processes, with increased inequality and greater exclusion of the most fragile social categories. Nevertheless, if relatively wealthy populations arrive in municipalities where less affluent populations can remain despite rising price dynamics, for example through social housing, this could foster social diversity."

In addition, it is difficult to determine whether the changes observed over the study period will be confirmed in the longer term or whether they are only temporary: our data stopped in July 2021, at a time when the pandemic was not over and government recom\u2011 mendations on working remotely were still in place.

To stop the spread of the virus, governments took unprecedented action: administrative closures of establishments, strict population lockdowns, curfews, etc. This had an unavoidable impact on the econ\u2011 omy: at global level, GDP fell by 3.3% in 2020 (International Monetary Fund, 2021). In France in 2020, business suffered a historic decline, with a 7.9% drop in GDP in constant euro terms (Amoureux et al., 2021). The pri\u2011 vate sector in particular was very severely impacted by the health crisis: the Urssaf Caisse nationale estimate identified 275,800 sala\u2011 ried job losses (Boulliung & Amoros, 2021). Temporary employment in particular levelled out, matching the different restriction mea\u2011 sures in the short term. However, job losses in France were avoided thanks to the partial activity scheme and the various aid schemes and arrangements offered by the State (soli\u2011 darity funds, state\u2011guaranteed loans, direct tax remittances, etc.).\nThe business sectors are split heterogeneously over French territory, which is why the regions were not affected to the same extent by the economic crisis. As such, departments special\u2011 ising in tourism or industry were affected first: for example Corsica or Savoie, or even Ain and Pas\u2011de\u2011Calais (Charton & Durieux, 2021). Conversely, regions in which the use of remote working is more common, such as \u00cele\u2011de\u2011France, were relatively more resistant to the health crisis (OECD, 2020).\nTo better understand the heterogeneous impacts of the health crisis on employment in France, regional analyses have been carried out in order to isolate the effect associated with the sectoral structure of local employment. They are based on the shift\u2011share method, which makes it possible to break down a change or a rate associated with employment (for example, changes in the number of jobs or the rate of use of the partial activity scheme) into a structural effect reflecting the sectoral breakdown of local employment and a local residual effect obtained by difference (Kubrak, 2018). The first analyses of the health crisis show that, although the sectoral employment structure is a significant component in explaining the variability of the shock between the regions, it alone is not sufficient to explain this entirely. For example, works studying the impact of the health crisis based on the change in the number of jobs (Bouvart et al., 2021) or based on the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill (Barrot,"

            "text": "fied as having best withstood the health crisis thanks to significant local effects are primarily situated in Brittany and Nouvelle\u2011Aquitaine (DATAR, 2021).\nIn addition to the sectoral structure of local jobs, the issue of the location of the companies there\u2011 fore appears to play a central role in assessing the local impact of the health crisis. Since the work of Paul Krugman on geographic economy (Krugman, 1991), it is generally recognised that the economic agents are dependent on the local context. Accordingly, companies appear to set up in dense areas as they are looking for clustering economies, which can lead to different ripple effects. As these are associated with the location of the agents, we more often talk of geographic spillover effects (Baumont et al., 2000). These mechanisms could even be the \u201ckey driver of performance in regions\u201d and neighbouring regions (Carr\u00e9 et al., 2019; Yang & Wong, 2012). In France, significant spillover effects have been highlighted, in relation to company creations in metropolitan areas (Brunetto & Levratto, 2017) and, in employment areas, in the number of jobs between 2009 and 2015 (Carr\u00e9 et al., 2019).\nCan we identify the factors that explain the heterogeneity of the impact of the health crisis accross territories? Are local sectoral structures a key factor? In this article, we study the terri\u2011 torial impact of the health crisis based on the evolution of the wage bill in the private sector, using data from the Agirc\u2011Arrco (the fund for supplementary pensions in the private sector) wage database. We place at the centre of the analysis the concepts of structural effect and local effect, via a spatial analysis.\nStudying the change in the private wage bill has a double advantage: this indicator makes it possible to account for the effect of the health crisis on the number of jobs, and it also inte\u2011 grates its impact on wages and, thereby, the massive reliance on the partial activity scheme.\nWe look more deeply into the concept of local effect with spatial econometric methods. Indeed, it appears to be important to gain a better understanding of the local effect, shown in the literature as essentiel, to explaining the heterogeneous impact of the health crisis in France. To account in greater detail for the role played by neighbouring effects, the concept of spatial autocorrelation is used to study the influence of neighbouring regions; it is defined\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 97\nRegional Analysis of the Impact of the 2020 Health Crisis on the Private\u2011Sector Wage Bill: Structural and Local Effects\nas the correlation, positive or negative, between a variable for a given zone and the same variable calculated in the neigh bouring regions (Loonis & Bellefon, 2018).\nAfter a brief presentation of the data used in section 1, section 2 presents the heteroge\u2011 neous impact of the 2020 health crisis on the private\u2011sector wage bill at employment zone level. The link between local sectoral compo\u2011 sition and the change in private\u2011sector wage bill is analysed using the shift\u2011share method. In section 3, we explore the other factors that explain the differentiated impact of the health crisis by region."

At this aggregation level, specific subsectors that were relatively unaffected by the health crisis are sometimes associated with other sectors that were heavily affected. For example, the \u201cother manufacturing industries\u201d sector includes the medical and dental supplies and instrument manufacturing subgroup, as well as the specific jewellery, games and toys, musical instruments and sporting goods manu\u2011 facturing subsectors. Furthermore, temporary workers (employment\u2011related activities sector employees) are not classified into the sector in which their contract is performed. However, this form of employment is heavily concentrated in certain sectors (manufacturing industry, construction, transport and storage): the effect of the health crisis on employment may therefore be underestimated in these sectors.\nThe analysis is restricted to metropolitan France, as French overseas departments and territories were affected differently by the measures seeking to curb the pandemic. The territorial grid used in the study is the employment zone, defined as \u201ca group of municipalities in which most of the active population live and work\u201d (L\u00e9vy et al., 2020).

Some sectoral specificity indices are strongly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficients significantly different from zero) to the change in the 2020 private\u2011sector wage bill (Table 1).\nThe regions most affected by the health crisis include, in particular, Corsica (Calvi,\nFigure I \u2013 Average change in private\u2011sector wage bill by employment zone between 2019 and 2020\n-21.0 -7.4 -5.7 -4.6 0.0 0.7\nNotes: The categories correspond to the quartiles of the average change in the private\u2011sector wage bill between 2019 and 2020; an additional category relates to the one employment zone (Manosque) that experienced positive growth.

These regions share a high degree of specialisation in the hospitality sector, associ\u2011 ated with their tourist appeal (this sector is at least 3.5 times larger in these regions than in the rest of France), and the construction sector, to a lesser extent. However, these specialisations appear to be negatively correlated to the local change in the private\u2011sector wage bill, with the highest specificity index values associated with the lowest wage\u2011bill variation values.\nThe more industrialised regions belong to the group of zones most impacted by the health crisis. Some regions particularly affected are situated in the north and north\u2011east of France, with employment zones specialising in the automotive industry (specificity indices above 5, see Appendix 2), metalworking (specificity indices above 14) and metal product manufac\u2011 ture (specificity indices above 2.5). This metal specialisation is also found in central France. The changes here are highlighted by Chausse et al. (2021).\nConversely, the employment zones least affected by the health crisis are primarily found in the west and south\u2011west of France. This relates firstly to the Breton and western regions as well as employment zones situated further south. These regions specialise in the food industries; as also shown by Bouvart et al. (2021), this sector is at least six times larger in these employment zones than in the rest of France. In the west, some regions specialising in the insurance sector were relatively resistant to the health crisis (for example Niort: \u22121.5%), as were some zones specialising in the manu\u2011 facture of chemicals and chemical products. This confirms the resilience of the chemical\nindustry, as also shown by Boisbras (2021). Lastly, some regions in the east were affected to a relatively lesser extent, these regions also specialising in the manufacture of chemicals products (specificity indices above 10), or in scientific research and development (specificity indices above 8)."

If, all other things being equal, the region is more specialised than the average (i.e. metro\u2011 politan France) in the sectors generally spared from the health crisis, its structural effect will be positive.\nThe difference, for each employment zone z, between the change observed and the change expected forms the local effect: Local effectz = Variation MSz \u2013 Expected variation MSz. It can be interpreted as the gap between the sector\u2011based private\u2011sector wage bill changes at regional and national level, weighted by the wage bill structure by business sector in the zone.\nThe difference between the change observed at regional level and the national variation allows us to define two groups of regions: if the difference is positive (or negative), this means that the region experienced a higher (lower) variation in the private\u2011sector wage bill than the national change. The employment zone is therefore more (less) dynamic and fared rela\u2011 tively better (worse) in terms of withstanding the health crisis. Furthermore, the difference between the change observed at regional level and the national variation is the same as the sum of the structural and local effects:\nVariation MS National variation MS Structural effect Loc z z \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \u2212 = + al effectz\ufffd\nThis is why the effects of the health crisis that are explained by the sectoral component of jobs can easily be separated from those associated with a local effect.\nThe map showing the results of this analysis can be found in Appendix 3 and the regional typology based on this method is presented in Appendix 4. We also provide a particularly focused look at the 20 regions that were most/least affected by the health crisis, the results of which are similar to those obtained by Bouvart et al. (2021) in terms of the rate of use of partial activity. This is explained by the choice to examine the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill as it includes the effects backed by the use of the partial activity scheme.4 For example, regions specialising in sectors heavily impacted by the health crisis are characterised by a strongly negative structural effect (Figure II\u2011A).

In these zones, the local effect is also negative, and accentuates the sectoral shock associated with the health crisis.\nConversely, in the most dynamic regions (Figure II\u2011B), two positive effects combine. On the one hand, the effect associated with the sectoral employment structure is either negative but weak, or positive. This is explained by the presence of sectors that withstood the health crisis particularly well, such as the food indus\u2011 tries (Rennes and Vitr\u00e9 employment zones), the chemicals industry (Boll\u00e8ne\u2011Pierrelatte) or the insurance sector (Niort).

Furthermore, other analyses estimate that it is these local effects that prevail if the impact of the health crisis is examined on the basis of the change in the number of jobs (Bouvart et al., 2021). Therefore, dimensions other than the business sectors must be taken into consideration."

            "text": "Given the literature and recent studies carried out on similar issues, the study of the location of companies and the inclusion of interactions between neighbouring regions seem to be inter\u2011 esting dimensions to analyse. To examine the influences between neighbouring regions, it is necessary to define the concept of proximity. An initial possibility is to base the definition of proximity on the notion of distance between regions. This distance could itself be defined in several ways, using geometric concepts6 or\nbased on the closest neighbours. Another possi\u2011 bility, which we have used here, is to take into consideration common borders between regions, i.e. the notion of contiguity. The study data are calculated at employment zone level: these are surface area data, which sometimes correspond to administrative borders. In this case, proximity in the sense of contiguity is commonly used. The concept of proximity is shown statistically by a weighting matrix, W, for which each element defines the proximity link between one region i and another region j. As the primary definition used for proximity is contiguity, the elements of the associated weighting matrix are therefore defined as:\nwij i j = 1\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffdif\ufffd the\ufffd employment \ufffd zones and\ufffd have\ufffd a\ufffd common\ufffd border\n\ufffd otherwise0\n   \nThere are two statistical tests that can be used to test the presence of spatial autocorrelation, incorporating the proximity relationships defined in W : Moran\u2019s I test and Geary\u2019s C test \u2013 the first being generally preferred in the litera\u2011 ture due to its stability. They make it possible to check whether the value obtained in the given region is close to the values obtained for the same variable in the neighbouring zones (Loonis & Bellefon, 2018).\nThe study of the local variations in the private\u2011sector wage bill in 2020 shows that the spatial autocorrelation is positive and signifi\u2011 cant: similar values are pooled in neighbouring regions.7 This result is in line with those of other analyses that highlight the positive spatial autocorrelation of various indicators associated with the labour market (the number of jobs in Levratto et al., 2017; the change in the number of jobs in Carr\u00e9 et al., 2020; the unemployment rate, the rate of informal employment and real salaries in Koike Quintanar, 2019).\n5. Indeed, the correlation between the deviation from the national average variation and the structural effect increased significantly in 2020 (Dunn and Clark test, Dunn & Clark, 1969). Moreover, a study released by the CDC Institute for Research shows that this relationship was stronger in 2020 than it was at the time of the 2008\u20112009 financial crisis (Pacini et al., 2021). This finding is due to the fact that the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill includes the use of the partial activity scheme, which was more widespread during the 2020 health crisis than during the 2008\u20112009 crisis, and which differs greatly by business sector (see Appendix 1). 6. \u201cDelaunay triangulation is a geometric method that connects the points in the form of triangles so as to maximise the minimum of all the angles of the triangles (this triangulation tends to avoid sliver triangles). [\u2026]. The sphere of influence graph links two points if their \u2018circles from the nea\u2011 rest neighbour\u2019 intersect. [\u2026]. The Gabriel graph links two points pi and pj if and only if all other points are outside the circle with diameter [pi ;pj] [\u2026].

This conclusion is robust as the results are significant irrespective of the concept of proximity used.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022102\nThe spatial autocorrelation at employment zone level calculated for the 2018\u20112019 variation is also significant, though to a lesser extent. Moran\u2019s index I 8 is 0.2 when calculated for the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill by employment zone between 2018 and 2019 and 0.34 between 2019 and 2020 (Table 2): this suggests that the health crisis has accentuated the overall spatial autocorrelation.\nThe analysis of the spatial autocorrelation indi\u2011 cators may also be carried out on the structural effects and local effects from the shift\u2011share breakdown (Levratto et al., 2017). As these two variables are correlated to the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill, the tests also conclude that there is a positive and signifi\u2011 cant spatial autocorrelation. Conversely, the spatial autocorrelation of the structural effects is almost unchanged between 2019 and 2020 (0.29 compared with 0.28), in contrast to the spatial autocorrelation of the local effects (0.15 compared to 0.32). It would therefore seem that the increase in the spatial autocorrelation of the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill is due to an increase in the spatial autocorrelation of local effects during the health crisis. In other words, the more intensive link between neighbouring regions in 2020 is not linked to the regions\u2019 sectoral specialisations, but to local effects. Specifying a spatial model will make it possible to clarify these different relationships."

Specifying the model in this way makes it possible to test the relationship between the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill in 2020 and the structural effect, on the one hand, and the local (residual) effect, on the other.\nFor this, and as the spatial autocorrelation of the variation in the private\u2011sector wage bill has been proven, it is possible to introduce the proximity\nmatrix W into the model. As the relationship of proximity may operate on several levels, there are different ways of specifying a spatial model.\nSpatial correlation may be present in unobserved characteristics, in which case W intervenes in the model error: this is the SEM (Spatial Error Model), which is formulated as follows: Y X u= +\u03b2 , where u Wu= +\u03bb \u03b5 . Starting from the principle that the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill for a given region depends on that of its neighbouring regions, the model, which in this case is a spatial autoregressive model (SAR), also known as an endogenous interaction model, is formulated as follows: Y WY X= + +\ufffd\u03c1 \u03b2 \u03b5. The change in the private\u2011sector wage bill of a given region can also depend on the structural effects of its neighbouring regions: Y X WX= + +\u03b2 \u03b8 \u03b5, this is the exogenous interaction model (spatial lag X, SLX). Lastly, the spatial Durbin model (SDM) involves both endogenous and exoge\u2011 nous interactions: Y WY X WX= + + +\u03c1 \u03b2 \u03b8 \u03b5 9 (Loonis & Bellefon, 2018). The idea behind this initial approach is twofold: to estimate the variability in the changes in the private\u2011sector wage bill explained by the variability in the structural effects (and therefore to measure the extent to which the sectoral structure is a key factor in explaining the heterogeneous impact of the health crisis), and to identify the level at which the spatial autocorrelation operates when the specified model contains the structural effect as the only explanatory variable. This is why these four models are estimated.\nOnce the estimates have been carried out for"

The SDM model is currently used in the literature, as it is more robust against poor specification choices (Loonis & Bellefon, 2018). 10. Several approaches coexist for choosing the most appropriate model. The bottom\u2011up approach consists in starting by testing an OLS model, then carrying out Lagrange multiplier tests on \u03bb and \u03c1 (Anselin et al., 1996). The top\u2011down approach consists in starting the other way round, by testing an SDM model (LeSage & Pace, 2009). The mixed approach takes the start of the bottom\u2011up approach, and, in the case of spatial interactions, suggests testing an SDM model (Elhorst, 2010). The summary of these approaches is taken from Loonis & Bellefon (2018).\nTable 2 \u2013 Overall Moran\u2019s I values in 2019 and 2020 associated with the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill, structural effects and local effects\nAverage change in the wage bill Structural effects Local effects 2019 0.20 0.29 0.15 2020 0.34 0.28 0.32\nNotes: The values are different from zero at significance level alpha=0.01.

With an adjusted R\u00b2 of 0.60 (in other words, 60% of the variability in local changes in the private\u2011sector wage bill is due to the variability in structural effects), the local sectoral struc\u2011 ture is therefore the first factor explaining the heterogeneous impact of the health crisis on the private\u2011sector wage bill.\nThe results of estimating an SEM model also confirm the results presented previously: the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill in 2020 also depends on other unobserved characteristics with a spatial autocorrelation (\u03bb significantly different from 0), and incorporating the local effect. With the aim of clarifying the local effects, namely variability which is still to be explained, a model containing the structural effect (expressed as the deviation from the average national private\u2011sector wage bill vari\u2011 ation between 2019 and 2020) and additional explanatory variables representing other aspects of the local pre\u2011health crisis context (calculated in 2019) is tested as part of the second approach.\nThere are many determining factors of local effects. The local effect could incorporate other characteristics of the local labour market, such as \u201cthe size of the companies established in the local area or the level of qualification of the labour force\u201d (Bouvart et al., 2021), the \u201ccontraction in local demand linked to the drop in activity\u201d or even the \u201cdevelopment of remote working\u201d but also, given the nature of the 2020 crisis, the potential effect of the local \u201cepidemic intensity\u201d (Barrot, 2021). It is also useful to assimilate the local effect to the more global concept of regional attractiveness (Zaninetti, 2016). Lastly, Levratto & Carr\u00e9 (2013) associate it more with geographic and/ or political concepts: \u201cgeographic situation in the national economic space, measures taken in favour of or to the detriment of the region, the region\u2019s own dynamism, etc.\u201d. The Herfindahl index11 is introduced into the model to represent the size of establishments, and the proportion of executives12 is selected to reflect the level of qualification of the workforce. The unem\u2011 ployment rate, used as a proxy for the economic situation, is also added.\nFurthermore, following other spatial studies on employment (Carr\u00e9 et al., 2020; Brunetto & Levratto, 2017; Levratto et al., 2017), we also introduced the number of jobs per km\u00b2 (i.e. the job density), which captures clustering effects, and an indicator of the region\u2019s predominantly residential nature that represents the openness of the employment zone\u2019s activities to the\noutside.13 Lastly, given the specific nature of the employment\u2011related activities sector (tempo\u2011 rary employment) during the health crisis, in particular with regard to the partial activity scheme (see Appendix 1), we also introduced the proportion of jobs in this sector.14"

The different practical approaches this time lead us to choose the SDM model as the most robust; this is also the one that gives the best performance of all the models tested (highest R2, lowest AIC15). The formulation of this model suggests that the spatial autocor\u2011 relation no longer functions in the error term \u2013 as was the case in the first approach with the structural effect as the sole explanatory vari\u2011 able; the addition of further variables therefore seems to allow for a greater understanding of the local effect that presents a spatial autocor\u2011 relation. As the SDM model contains spatially offset variables WY and WX, the interpretation of the relationships between the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill and the different explan\u2011 atory variables must still take into consideration interactions and feedback between regions, which is why the direct and indirect effects are generally used to break down these different relationships (Loonis & Bellefon, 2018). The direct effect corresponds to the impact of a change in an explanatory variable in this region on the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill in employment zone z. This indicator takes into consideration the feedback effects observed between employment zones: an explanatory\n11. For each employment zone, the Herfindahl\u2011Hirschman (HHI) index is equal to the sum of the squares of the shares of the region\u2019s establishments in its employment. It is a measure of local market concentration. 12. The concept of executive is defined here as belonging to the catego\u2011 ries laid down in Articles 4&4 bis or 36 of the French National Collective Agreement on Retirement and Insurance for Executives of 14 March 1947, on the creation of the AGIRC (General Association of Pension Institutions for Executives) scheme. The definition of \u201cexecutive\u201d within the meaning of the AGIRC does not exactly match that of the INSEE socio\u2011professional nomenclature. 13. The \u201cresidential zone\u201d indicator is taken from the employment zone typology given in L\u00e9vy et al. (2020). It is built around the concept of presen\u2011 tial sphere, which \u201ccovers activities implemented locally for the production of goods and services aiming at the satisfaction of the needs of persons present in the zone\u201d. 14. Other variables could have been tested, but they were not ultimately included as they are strongly correlated with the variables selected above. This is the case for the proportion of new jobs in total jobs in 2019, the pro\u2011 portion of permanent contracts in 2019, the decile ratio of salaries in 2019 and the proportion of days spent in partial activity in 2020. As a result, the absence of correlation was verified for all explanatory variables selected (structural effect, Herfindahl index, proportion of executives, unemployment rate, job density, residential zone, and proportion of jobs in the employment\u2011 related activities sector). 15. The adjusted R\u00b2 of the SDM model is 0.67, whereas it was 0.60 when the structural effect was the only explanatory variable. This result suggests that the structural effect is the predominant factor explaining the heteroge\u2011 neous impact of the health crisis on the private\u2011sector wage bill, to a much greater extent than the other local characteristics.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022104\nvariable for a given region z can have an effect on the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill in region z, but also on that of its neighbouring regions, which, in return, impacts region z.

It therefore represents the spillover effect."

This result (also obtained in 2019) is different from that obtained by Carr\u00e9 et al. (2020) in relation to the variation in salaried employment. This suggests that the private\u2011sector wage bill (which incorporates the simultaneous effects on workforce and wages) is less sensitive to the economic context and the agglomeration effects than the salaried workforce when considered on its own.\nThe variables associated with the business sectors (the structural effect and the share of temporary employment in salaried jobs in 2019) have a direct positive effect that is significantly different from zero. The relationship between the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill and the structural effect is therefore again verified using this specification: if, all other things being equal, the region is more specialised than the average (metropolitan France) in sectors heavily impacted by the health crisis, it belongs to the\ngroup of regions for which the private\u2011sector wage bill fell the most. This result suggests that this relationship does not depend on the location of the region and its neighbours. Furthermore, the temporary employment sector (employment\u2011 related activities) plays a determining factor in the local variation of the private\u2011sector wage bill. Temporary jobs, characterised by lower wage levels (\u221223% compared with the average salary per capita in metropolitan France in 201916), are the first to be lost in the event of a crisis, forming a sort of \u201csafety valve\u201d (P\u00e9rez et al., 2015). The regions with the highest levels of temporary employment therefore benefitted from a favourable composition effect: their private\u2011sector wage bill fell by less than their workforce numbers.17 This is particularly prevalent in Brittany, and especially in seven employment zones forming a cluster (Box). For example, in the Pontivy\u2011Loud\u00e9ac employ\u2011 ment zone where 29.1% of jobs in 2019 were held by temporary workers, the number of employees fell by 5.2% and the wage bill by 1.7% in 2020, and in the neighbouring zone of Lamballe\u2011Armor (25.4% temporary jobs in 2019), the number of employees fell by 4.9% while the wage bill fell by 3%. Moreover, due to temporary workers commuting from one employment zone to another (the \u201ccommuters\u201d), the temporary employment effect spills over\n16. By way of comparison, Urssaf Caisse nationale estimates that the average salary per capita of temporary workers is 15% lower than the total average salary per capita in 2020 over a wider scope: metropolitan France and overseas departments and territories (Boulliung & Amoros, 2021). 17. This categorises them in the employment zones having best with\u2011 stood the health crisis, in the sense of the change in their private\u2011sector wage bill between 2019 and 2020. Conversely, the regions characterised by lower temporary employment (for example, Corsica, see Box) directly accessed the partial activity scheme to withstand the health crisis, which has an immediate effect on their private\u2011sector wage bill (see Appendix 1), an effect accentuated by the salary levels of jobs accessing the partial acti\u2011 vity scheme in 2020 (on average 15% higher than the average salary per position in metropolitan France).\nTable 3 \u2013 Direct and indirect effects Explanatory variables Direct effects Indirect effects Structural effect (2019\u20112020 change) 1.430 [1.248,1.611] \u22120.013 [\u22120.518,0.489] Proportion of executives (2019) \u22120.072 [\u22120.121,\u22120.021] 0.031 [\u22120.120,0.187] Job density (2019) 0.000 [\u22120.000,0.000] 0.000 [\u22120.000,0.000] Unemployment rate (2019) \u22120.090 [\u22120.219,0.031] 0.072 [\u22120.187,0.330] Residential zone (2020) \u22120.004 [\u22120.010,0.001] \u22120.024 [\u22120.041,\u22120.009] Proportion of jobs in the temporary employment sector (2019) 0.087 [0.045,0.131] 0.148 [0.037,0.267] Concentration (Herfindahl index \u2013 2019) \u22121.349 [\u22121.913,\u22120.775] \u22120.282 [\u22121.986,1.499]\nNotes: Empirical confidence intervals (2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of 1,000 Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations \u2011 MCMC) are given in brackets; if 0 is included in the confidence interval, the effect is not significant.

This result, for 2019, confirms the concentration effect shown by Arqui\u00e9 & Bertin (2021), who highlight the fact that \u201ca higher concentration, due to the increased weighting of large employers on the labour market, is accompanied [\u2026] by lower salaries, especially for lower paid employees\u201d. Furthermore, the effect is accentuated during the health crisis (coefficient \u22121.330 in 2020 compared with \u22120.513 in 2019 for SDM models) via an effect on the workforce: Carr\u00e9 et al. (2019) suggest that large companies have a greater tendency to reduce their workforce in periods of economic crisis. Moreover, it appears that the labour force qualification level is linked to activity concentration. Indeed, small and medium\u2011sized enterprises (with fewer than"

In addition, the estimate shows that the proportion of executives also had a significant and negative direct impact on the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill in 2020.18 This result, which may seem, at first glance, to be unexpected, is in line with those of Levratto & Garsaa (2016), who also highlight the link with company size, and with the industrial specialisation of certain regions that employ few executives. This would seem to help explain why the Breton regions (average rate of executives of 11.4%) withstood the health crisis particularly well.\nLastly, the residential zone indicator turns out to be non\u2011significant in terms of the direct effect\n18. The variable was not, however, significant in 2019.\nBox \u2013 Clusters and Spillover Effects\nTo go further in the spatial analysis of the local effect, local Moran\u2019s I values can be calculated. These are part of the LISA indicators (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) developed by Anselin (1995) and make it possible to detect groupings of similar values, known as clusters. These clusters could reveal potential spillover effects, i.e. spillover mechanisms between regions could influence the local effect and, ultimately, the change in the local wage bill. Calculating the LISA associated with the local effect identifies two clusters. For almost all employment zones in Corsica, low values for the local effect are associated with equally low values in neighbouring territories (low\u2011low) \u2013 which is a sign of a positive local spatial autocorrelation, and has a significant upward influence on the overall spatial autocorrela\u2011 tion process at the level of metropolitan France. In Brittany, in seven employment zones (previously identified as those that best withstood the health crisis), high local effect values are associated with equally high values in neighbouring regions (high\u2011high). The significant spillover effects (but in this case, in the other direction) highlighted in Corsica and Brittany confirm that the concept of local effect partly overlaps with the specific characteristics of the temporary employment sector, a result that is also suggested by the significance of its indirect effect. In Brittany, the spillover effect probably flows through commuters: in 2019, 37.4% of temporary jobs in the Breton cluster were held by commuters, compared with 31.4% on average.\nTable \u2013 Local effects and proportion of temporary jobs (%) in 2019 in the employment zones identified in the clusters\nRegion Employment zone Local effects in 2020 Proportion of temporary jobs in 2019\nBrittany\nAuray 2.4 11.3 Carhaix\u2011Plouguer 0.4 10.2 Dinan 2.1 29.8 Lamballe\u2011Armor 3.6 25.4 Lorient 2.5 15.5 Plo\u00ebrmel 2.2 22.6 Pontivy\u2011Loud\u00e9ac 3.6 29.1\nCorsica\nAjaccio \u22122.0 3.3 Bastia \u22123.1 4.6 Calvi \u22128.5 0.0 Corte \u22124.6 0.0 Ghisonaccia \u22121.7 0.0 Porto\u2011Vecchio \u22122.4 1.4\nMetropolitan France \u2011 13.0\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022106\nbut significant in terms of the indirect effect. The residential employment zones have more working employees than the number of jobs available in the region, with many of these therefore working in neighbouring regions. While this variable does not have a determining effect on the local variation of the private\u2011sector wage bill, it may, conversely, have an indirect effect via proximity relationships; the location of certain employment zones close to residen\u2011 tial zones therefore has a negative effect on the change in their private\u2011sector wage bill. This negative effect seems to be linked to the health crisis as the variable was not significant in 2019. In the Lyon employment zone (Figure III), where the private\u2011sector wage bill fell by 3.6% in 2020 on average, we see a more marked drop in the wage bill of workers commuting from a residential zone (for example, Bourgoin\u2011Jallieu: \u22124.9%) than among commuters from a non\u2011 residential zone (Saint\u2011Etienne: \u22122.6%) or even than non\u2011commuters (living and working in the Lyon employment zone: \u22123.7%). This result suggests that the variation in the private\u2011sector wage bill has been detrimentally impacted to a greater extent due to the profile of the commuters coming from residential zones than by that of other employees. Commuters are\noverrepresented among executives and highly qualified professions (40% of positions in 2019, compared with 32% on average, nationally19), who are more likely to have kept their salaries during the 2020 lockdowns due to the use of remote working (Jauneau & Vidalenc, 2020). However, the use of remote working was more difficult to implement in certain situations, such as for people with children to look after.20 There are more households with children in residen\u2011 tial areas, such as Bourgoin\u2011Jallieu (42.5% of households in the employment zone had children in 2018), than in non\u2011residential areas (for example, 35.5% in Lyon in 201821). This result suggests that households with children had a greater tendency to reduce their profes\u2011 sional activities than other households due to the closure of schools during the first lockdown (Pailh\u00e9 et al., 2022).\n19. This result is consistent with other studies on the subject (Coud\u00e8ne & L\u00e9vy, 2016; IAU \u00cele\u2011de\u2011France, 2016). 20. Work stoppages were authorised during the first lockdown for parents who had to look after their children due to school closures. 21. Source: INSEE.

It confirms the very clear correlation between the change in the private\u2011sector wage bill and the sectoral composition of local jobs, a result already obtained in other estimations made on the subject. Furthermore, the temporary employment sector played a significant role as a shock\u2011absorber of the effects of the health crisis. The article identifies two other factors associ\u2011 ated with the local labour market that explain the different impact of the health crisis on the regions: the labour force qualification level and the concentration of activities. Lastly, the results shows that, for a given region, its neighbouring regions have an influence on the variation in the private\u2011sector wage bill: on the one hand, the shock\u2011absorbing role of the temporary employ\u2011 ment sector spills over into neighbouring zones\nthrough commuters, especially in Brittany. On the other hand, the regions neighbouring a resi\u2011 dential zone, primarily Paris and Lyon, would have withstood the health crisis more success\u2011 fully if they had not suffered a shock due to their employees commuting from neighbouring residential zones."

Partial activity may take two forms: either a \u201creduction in the duration of the working week\u201d, or a \u201ctemporary closure of all or part of the establishment\u201d. Between March and May 2020, the employer was compensated for 70% of the gross hourly remuneration, limited to 4.5 times the minimum wage (SMIC) hourly rate. On 1 June 2020, the compensation fell to 60%, except in sectors affected by the crisis (the S1 sectors, which include, in par\u2011 ticular, the tourism, hotel, restaurant, sport, culture, air transport, and events sectors, as well as the S1bis and S2 sectors) in which it remained at 70%. (Sources: https://www.service\u2011public.fr/professionnels\u2011entreprises/vosdroits/F23503). Use of the scheme rose significantly in 2009, linked to the 2008 economic crisis (Nevoux, 2018). It was shown that partial activity had a significant impact on safeguarding jobs in companies experiencing a decline in turnover due to the crisis. The safeguarded jobs are \u201cpermanent\u201d jobs (permanent contracts), with partial activity having only a slight impact on \u201ctemporary\u201d jobs (temporary employment, fixed\u2011term contracts, etc.). This shock\u2011absorbing role against the impact of the crisis on job losses is also confirmed by the initial analyses of the health crisis. The Observatoire fran\u00e7ais des conjonctures \u00e9conomiques (French Economic Observatory \u2013 OFCE) estimates that the partial activity scheme saved 1.4 million FTE jobs in 2020 (OFCE, 2021). Use of the partial activity scheme is not equal among the business sectors. The sectors that made the greatest use of the partial activity scheme in 2020 are linked to tourism, culture and leisure (Figure A1). These sectors were affected by the two lockdowns in 2020, in spring and autumn (Chausse et al., 2021). Conversely, four sectors used the scheme to a very limited extent: these were those whose activities were heavily required during the health crisis (medical\u2011social and social accommodation, human health activities) as well as other sectors such as financial service activities, and computer programming, consultancy and related activities. These latter two sectors are characterised by a high rate of executives (52% and 76%, respectively, compared with the national average of 19%). The employment\u2011related activities sector (tem\u2011 porary employment) stands out: although it experienced a 15% reduction in the wage bill, it had a lower rate of use of the partial activity scheme (2.5% of days worked in this sector fell under this scheme). Use of the partial activity scheme is also heterogeneous across the regions. Those making the greatest use of the scheme were Provence\u2011Alpes\u2011C\u00f4te\u2011d\u2019Azur and Corsica (C\u0153ur\u00e9, 2021).\nFigure A1 \u2013 Business sectors by change in the private\u2011sector wage bill between 2019 and 2020 and the proportion of days in partial activity in 2020\nCreative, artistic and performing arts activities\nFinancial service activities Employment-related activities\nHuman health activities\nSporting, recreational and leisure activities\nOther personal service activities\nTrade & repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles\nMetal product manufacture\nAccommodation\nMedical-social and social\naccommodation\nMotion picture production\nProgramming and other IT activities\nFood and beverage service activities\nNational average\n\u22125\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\u221240 \u221235 \u221230 \u221225 \u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0 5\n% days in partial activity in 2020\nChange in the wage bill 2019 and 2020 (%)\nNotes: The size of the circles is proportional to the weighting of the employment in the sector in 2020. For legibility reasons, sectors with a wei\u2011 ghting of less than 1% are not represented. Reading note: The food and beverage service sector represented 5.5% of all positions held in metropolitan France in 2020 in the private sector. Between 2019 and 2020, its wage bill fell by 31.2%; the number of days spent in partial activity in 2020 in this sector represented 28% of the number of days in employment.

The first group is formed of 34 employment zones, representing 22.1% of salaried jobs in metropolitan France in 2020, which experienced a change in their private\u2011sector wage bill above that observed in metropolitan France, associated with positive structural and local effects; these are the regions that best withstood the health crisis. The second group (71 employment zones, 17.4% of salaried jobs in 2020) includes the regions with resilience in the face of the crisis based on specific local characteristics. The third group (three employment zones, 17.9% of salaried jobs in 2020) is formed of employment zones with resilience in the face of the crisis based on the sectoral employment structure. The fourth group (45 employment zones, 9.7% of salaried jobs in 2020) is formed of the regions for which the negative impact of the health crisis is associated with the sectoral employment structure. The fifth group (23 employment zones, 9.8% of salaried jobs in 2020) is formed of the regions for which the impact of the health crisis is based on specific local characteristics. Lastly, the 111 employment zones that constitute the sixth group (23% of salaried jobs in 2020 in metropolitan France) are the regions in the most difficulty: they combine negative structural and local effects. These are the zones most negatively impacted by the health crisis.\nFigure A4 \u2013 Region typology\nGroup 1: +/+/+ Group 2: +/-/+ Group 3: +/+/- Group 4: -/-/+ Group 5: -/+/- Group 6: -/-/-\nNotes: Group 1: +/+/+; Group 2: +/\u2212/+; Group 3: +/+/\u2212; Group 4: \u2212/\u2212/+; Group 5: \u2212/+/\u2212; Group 6: \u2212/\u2212/\u2212. The first sign corresponds to the change in the wage bill compared to the national average, the second sign to the structural effects and the third sign to the local effects, in line with the method suggested by Carr\u00e9 & Levratto (2013). Reading note: The Calvi employment zone (group 6) shows a negative deviation from the national average wage bill variation (\u221215.7%), a negative sector\u2011based effect (\u22127.3%), and a negative local effect (\u22128.5%). The Rennes employment zone (group 1) shows a positive deviation from the national average wage bill variation (+2.4%), a positive sector\u2011based effect (+0.4%), and a positive local effect (+2%). The Paris employment zone (group 3) shows a positive deviation from the national average wage bill variation (+0.8%), a positive sector\u2011based effect (+1%), and a negative local effect (\u22120.2%).

Many protein plans aimed at boosting the supply of legumes have succeeded one another without managing to solve the issue. Does it mean that French agriculture is economically tied to grain production using imports of synthetic fertilisers and to off\u2011farm livestock production using soya imports? The novelty of our quantitative analysis is to take into account the role of French consumers\u2019 potential demand for products that are free from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Our prospective simulations show that, while this demand is a far more powerful driver for reduc\u2011 ing imports of GMO soya cake than traditional subsidies for legumes, it is unlikely to lead to a significant improvement in protein self\u2011sufficiency, as net imports of other protein\u2011rich products are increasing. In contrast, substantial progress could be made by improving the productivity of forage land.\nJEL: Q11, Q16, Q18 Keywords: protein self\u2011sufficiency, genetically modified organisms, markets, France\n* UMR SMART (Joint Research Unit for Agricultural Structures and Markets, Resources and Land), Institut Agro \u2013 INRAE (French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment), Rennes, France.

Though initially moti\u2011 vated by purely economic considerations, recent protein plans increasingly emphasise the direct environmental benefits of these crops. Due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil, legumes reduce the need for synthetic fertilisers on cultivated land, thereby reducing direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nDespite nearly 50 years of public support for this sector, France remains largely dependent on imports of PRPs, particularly soya cake for animal feed. The degree of public support and the raw material price ratios have so far had little impact on the decisions of French producers and users in terms of favouring domestic PRP production. The evolutions in recent years are due more to the growth of the first\u2011generation biofuel sector, the consumption of which has been capped, than to French protein plans. Moreover, the expansion of legume crops does not always appear to be the best solution for mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture (Pellerin et al., 2017). Strong public support for legumes as part of the fight against climate change is therefore unlikely to be achieved in the near future. Finally, while PRP trade policies are managed at the EU level, many Member States that are even more dependent on imports from third countries than France consider that specialisation and international trade based on comparative advantages could lead to potential improvements in standards of living (Mah\u00e9, 2005). As third countries have comparative advantages in terms of protein production (especially soya), they find imports preferable to local supply. This is reflected, for example, in attitudes towards free trade treaties with Canada and the Mercosur countries.\nIs France set to remain heavily dependent on PRP imports for the foreseeable future? In other words, is French agriculture economically tied to grain production facilitated by imports of synthetic fertilisers and to off\u2011farm livestock production facilitated by PRP imports, thereby generating excess nitrogen polluting our air, soil and water (Magrini et al., 2015)? Will the new national plant\u2011based protein plan announced in December 2020 deliver only modest results like its predecessors?\nThis article aims to make a quantitative contri\u2011 bution to the complex and perennial debate on plant\u2011based protein by incorporating a new dimension, which is increasingly being discussed but has not been extensively measured to date: French consumer demand for local food products without genetically modified organ\u2011 isms (GMOs). Imported PRPs, especially soya, are largely derived from genetically modified crops. Consumer leverage could therefore be used to help reduce French protein dependence by reducing the amounts of these GMO\u2011based products imported. Several surveys indicate a potential demand from French consumers for GMO\u2011free food products and locally produced foods in general (FranceAgriMer, 2018). Agri\u2011food industry stakeholders are increas\u2011 ingly moving to meet this potential demand, as detailed at the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l\u2019Alimentation (French National Food Conference) (Terres Univia, 2017).\nThis potential demand from French consumers concerns dried legumes and processed foods (meat and dairy products). A methodology that takes into account the different products and players in the food sector is essential to quan\u2011 tify this new driver of consumer demand and to compare it with the more conventional drivers of public support. We therefore develop an original computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that separates the non\u2011GMO sectors from \u201cconventional\u201d sectors. CGE models are widely used for the ex ante assessment of the impact of public policies (such as free trade agreements and agricultural policies), whether in terms of production, trade, demand, price and market impacts in general. Our static model allows for the quantification of a wide range of consequences of different prospective scenarios, e.g. involving the acreage dedicated to legume crops or the dependence on GMO soya imports, including potential reductions in grain and/or animal product exports. It therefore allows us to determine whether gains in protein self\u2011 sufficiency might come at the expense of a loss of self\u2011sufficiency in other sectors and, ultimately, the risk of a loss of agri\u2011food trade surplus. It also measures the impact on revenue generated by agricultural and agri\u2011food activities, enabling us to assess possible conflicts between protein self\u2011sufficiency and the economic returns of the sectors. Our approach therefore provides a unified and coherent quantification of the various issues surrounding the broad topic of plant\u2011based protein. However, our static model does not cover all the issues at stake, such as transient and long\u2011term effects on biodiversity or\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 117\nProtein Deficit in France \u2013 A Prospective Analysis\nnet GHG emissions, which is why no normative analysis of the objective of reducing France\u2019s protein deficit has been conducted.\nOur prospective simulations show that, while this potential consumer demand is a far more powerful driver for the reduction of GM soya cake imports than traditional subsidies for legumes, it is unlikely to lead to a signif\u2011 icant improvement in protein self\u2011sufficiency, as net imports of other PRPs are increasing. In contrast, substantial progress could be made by improving the productivity of forage land. Changes in consumer demand have a greater positive impact on French agricultural and agri\u2011food revenue than public subsidies.\nThe rest of the article is organised as follows: the first section provides a more detailed description of the issue under study; the second summarises the main findings of the available literature; the third is devoted to the model developed, with emphasis on the original elements introduced, and describes the scenarios tested; the fourth reviews the outcomes of these scenarios and includes a sensitivity analysis. The conclusion summarises the main findings and suggests possible extensions to this empirical study."

            "text": "Both plant and animal proteins are made up of amino acids. The nutritional value of a protein is dependent on its ability to provide the amino acids essential for the growth of the organism concerned and to replenish the proteins in its body. Not all proteins contain the same amino acids. When it comes to human nutritional needs, sources of animal proteins are more balanced in terms of amino acids than plant proteins, some\u2011 thing that can be corrected for by combining different sources of plant protein (e.g. grains and legumes).1\nThe rest of this article focuses on animal proteins and plant proteins used for animal feed. Due to the lack of macroeconomic data, sources of plant proteins used directly in human food have been omitted from the analysis. According to microeconomic data collected by Agrosynergie (2018), these mainly include dried legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans, etc.) and soya beans. They represent a niche but growing market driven largely by the increasing popularity of vegetarian and vegan diets. These proteins enjoy a positive image in terms of health and environ\u2011 mental benefits, but a negative one in terms of\ndigestibility and convenience (preparation time). The prospects of these markets depend largely on the public research strategy in this area and on the actions of the processing industry (Magrini et al., 2018).\nOn average, it takes about 4.9 kg of plant protein to produce 1 kg of animal protein (weighted according to the weights of the different animal species) (Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2016). Indeed, live\u2011 stock have specific protein requirements for growth and maintenance, which are covered by coarse fodder (grazed/harvested grass, maize/fodder beet, etc.) and single or mixed concentrate feed. The latter are made from different raw materials, and those containing more than 15% protein are considered PRPs. For example, grains are composed mainly of starch, a source of energy, and are therefore not classified as PRPs, even though they do contain protein. Oilseed (especially soya) cakes on the other hand are protein\u2011rich products. Dry pulses (peas and faba beans) have a medium starch and protein content.\nFigures I and II below show how the production and use of PRPs in animal feed in France and Europe have changed since 1973. While their use increased sharply at the beginning of the study period, since 2000, it has grown only marginally in Europe and even declined in France, due to a more modest increase in livestock production volumes and increased productivity in these sectors. Soya cake is the most widely consumed PRP, followed by other oilseed cakes (rapeseed and sunflower). PRP production also increased significantly at the beginning of the study period, with more modest increases since the early 2000s. Production of rapeseed and sunflower cake has increased considerably, partly due to the expansion of the biofuel industry. In contrast, production of legumes decreased substantially over the same period. The French PRP deficit has always been less pronounced than the European deficit, partly due to the available agricultural land, the scale of livestock production and national policies."

Therefore, the EU and France came to depend on soya bean and soya cake imports from the US, Argentina and Brazil. In a highly concentrated global soya market, such a dependence was a weakness for the European animal production sector (in 1973, the United States reduced its soya exports due to a severe drought). As a result, Europe implemented various protein plans to boost European legume production,\nthe first of which dates back to 1975 and the latest to 2020.\nSupport for legume and soya bean acreage and production has been a recurrent feature of these protein plans.2 Since 1992 and the MacSharry reform of the Common Agricultural\n2.

However, combined changes in support, crop prices, yields and variable production costs led to a decline in margins per hectare of land dedicated to legume crops between 1992 and 2008 relative to the margins per hectare of competing crops (Ramanantsoa & Villien, 2012). This contributed to a sharp decline in French land allocated to legume crops.3 The CAP Health Check in 2008 brought an increase in relative support for legume acreage, leading to an increase in the amount of land dedicated to growing these crops.\nThe latest plan (period 2014\u20112020) falls within the framework of the post\u20112013 CAP, with combined support for land dedicated to legume crops, including fodder crops, in amounts ranging from \u20ac100 to \u20ac200/ha. These crops are now also indirectly supported by the eligibility criteria for direct payments under the first pillar of the CAP, which encompass the bulk of agricultural budget support. These criteria, known as \u201cgreening\u201d, require the maintenance of minimum areas of ecological interest, which include protein acreage. The agri\u2011environmental and climate measures under the second pillar of the CAP are another public instrument promoting legume crops and recognising their positive environmental impacts (input reduction through longer rota\u2011 tions). However, restrictions/bans on plant protection products (e.g. against faba bean seed beetle) have made these crops less attractive to farmers. During that period, the acreage devoted to legumes in France increased only marginally. In contrast, the acreage devoted to soya increased significantly, partly due to new seed varieties that were better suited to different geographical areas and to the implementation of a French soya charter involving the various stakeholders in the industry in order to meet the French demand for non\u2011GMO soya. Despite this increase, legumes still accounted for only a modest share (4%) of French arable land surface area, which was largely dominated by grains.\nThe health crisis that emerged at the beginning of 2020 brought the issue of French sovereign ty to the fore, not only in terms of medical equipment (masks) but also in relation to food supply. Jaravel & M\u00e9jean (2021) begin by demonstrating that, in terms of vulnerability, the French agri\u2011food supply is just behind the chemical sector. They then propose three meas\u2011 ures aimed at building a realistic and effective\nresilience strategy without resorting to exces\u2011 sive protectionism: greater diversification of supplies, expansion of storage capacity for low value\u2011added products and, finally, increased innovation for vulnerable inputs at the techno\u2011 logical frontier. However, the government\u2011led France Relance recovery plan includes further measures intended to boost French production, including the supply of plant proteins. This new plan aims to double the acreage devoted to legumes by 2030, to 8% of the available agricul\u2011 tural land. In concrete terms, this plan, initially endowed with 100 million euros, provides public funds to help structure supply chains (inspired in part by the example of the soya sector) and encourage investment in agricultural holdings (the initial budget of 20 million euros was used up in the first year and a new budget for the same amount was approved in 2021). These amounts remain well below the combined subsidies for acreage dedicated to legume crops (under the national low\u2011carbon strategy, the budget announced for 2027 alone amounts to 236 million euros). Like previous plans, it includes actions to promote human consumption of legumes (not explicitly covered in this article) and support varietal research.\nIn this respect, GMO seed crops have been banned in France since 2008 (only one crop \u2013 maize \u2013 is allowed in Europe, which is mainly grown in Spain); however, about a hundred GMO crops and their by\u2011products are autho\u2011 rised for import and use in food and feed. This includes soya beans and by\u2011products such as soya oil and soya cake. These authorised GMO products are subject to traceability and labelling obligations, with an exemption threshold to account for possible cases of accidental presence (e.g. in the management of raw material trans\u2011 port). These obligations do not apply to products (dairy, meat) from animals that may be fed GMO raw materials. Operators in these sectors can choose to declare that their livestock have been fed \u201cGMO\u2011free\u201d, at extra cost to themselves and/ or to consumers.\nGMO farming began in the mid\u20111990s and has grown steadily since then, recently approaching 190 million hectares, i.e. more than 10% of the world\u2019s arable land, concentrated in three coun\u2011 tries: the United States, Brazil and Argentina (75, 50 and 24 million hectares, respectively).\n3. Other factors contributed to this decline, including greater volatility in the yields of these crops and blocking of supply chains (Zander et al., 2016; Magrini et al., 2016). To our knowledge, there is no econometric quantification of the relative contributions of these different factors to changes in PRP acreage/production/balance sheets.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022120\nThey mainly consist of soya, maize, cotton and rapeseed, with almost 96, 60, 25 and 10 million hectares, respectively. As a result, almost 80% of the soya grown worldwide is GMO, making it increasingly difficult to supply certified non\u2011GMO soya in France and Europe.\nThis expansion of GMO crops is partly due to the ever\u2011increasing numbers of new GMO seeds being authorised (Nes et al., 2021). Resistance to herbicides (especially the controversial glyphosate) and insects are still the dominant traits of GMO crops. New GMO seeds target other characteristics, such as increased resist\u2011 ance to climatic hazards or changes in the nutritional composition of products. Moreover, while GMOs are organisms whose genetic material has been detectably altered, this is not the case for seeds produced through new tech\u2011 nologies, generally grouped together under the term \u201cgenome editing\u201d, which were introduced in laboratories in the mid\u20112000s. These tech\u2011 nologies, also used in gene therapy (Parisi & Rodriguez\u2011Cerezo, 2021), do not insert one or more genes from another organism into the genome of an organism: rather, they selectively modify a genetic sequence within an organism by means of different processes, such as gene mutation, activation or silencing. The products created using these new technologies can also be obtained by conventional (natural) plant breeding techniques. A major advantage of these new technologies is their lower procurement cost in research and development (only 5% of the cost of conventional technology \u2013 Bullock et al., 2021). The cultivation of these new seeds has recently begun in the United States (Gotch et al., 2021).\nEuropean countries have debated at length the legal status of the products created using these new technologies. In July 2018, the EU Court of Justice temporarily settled the debate on the grounds that they should be governed by the rules applied to GMO products. However, in the spring of 2021, following a request from the European Council, the European Commission published a report that was more favourable to these new technologies and derivatives, stressing on the one hand that they can contribute to more sustainable food systems and therefore to the objectives of the Green Deal, and on the other hand that the current EU legislation on GMOs, adopted in 2001, is no longer appropriate. The debate on these technologies and the resulting products, as well as their possible contributions to protein self\u2011sufficiency, are therefore being reopened in Europe and France (see for example Le D\u00e9aut, 2021)."

            "text": "French and European protein independence is a long\u2011standing issue that has given rise to numerous research projects. This article is limited to a summary of recent studies that include economic computations.\nIn terms of supply, many studies consider the size of the agricultural holding, the field crop farm and/or the mixed crop\u2011livestock farm. These studies mainly analyse the potential trade\u2011offs between economic and environmental objec\u2011 tives where levels of legume/PRP production/ use vary. They include prospective and ex post comparative analyses, but make no attempt to statistically explain farmers\u2019 choices in terms of levels of production of PRPs. Summarising the findings of the various French studies conducted to date, Magrini et al. (2015; 2016) conclude that there is no trade\u2011off for French farms: the expansion of legume crops is beneficial in the long term, within the framework of appro\u2011 priate rotations, from both an environmental and economic point of view. These results are not consis tently observed in other production regions. As an example, Reckling et al. (2016) evaluate the same trade\u2011offs between the economic and environmental effects of the integration of legumes in five European regions. These authors find that, while the introduction of legumes led to significant reductions in nitrous oxide emissions and nitrogen fertiliser use, it also led to a decrease in gross margins in three out of five regions. More recently, Cortignani & Dono (2020) show that the expansion of legume crops promoted by the greening measures of the CAP improved the environmental balance of Italian farms as expected, but to the detri\u2011 ment of economic (income) and social (salaried and non\u2011salaried work) impacts. Lastly, using a micro\u2011econometric model that takes into account the heterogeneity of French agricul\u2011 tural holdings, Koutchad\u00e9 et al. (2021) quantify the impact of coupled subsidies on extensive margins, i.e. on decisions to include legumes in crop rotation. They also show that these subsidies have much more limited impacts on intensive margins, i.e. the number of hectares cultivated once the crop is integrated into the crop rotation.\nSome macroeconomic analyses have examined the supply of legumes at national level in France. The latest to our knowledge was provided by Ramanantsoa & Villien (2012), who simu\u2011 lated the impacts of different public support schemes for legume and soya bean production at national level using the MAGALI supply model.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 121\nProtein Deficit in France \u2013 A Prospective Analysis\nThey showed that the price changes considered would have a greater impact on PRP land use and production than direct subsidies. They also pointed out that the cost of reducing GHG emissions is high in relation to the carbon price.\nOther studies have focused specifically on the French demand for PRPs, in particular by French animal feed companies. Le Cadre et al. (2015) therefore investigated the possible use of locally produced, certified non\u2011GMO soya cake, showing major raw material substitutions and once again the importance of relative prices.\nEurope\u2011wide studies covering all aspects of legume/PRP markets are more numerous (recent examples include Henseler et al., 2013; Kalaitzandonakes et al., 2014; Kuhlman et al., 2017; Deppermann et al., 2018; Jensen et al., 2021; Gotch et al., 2021). Using the CAPRI model, Kuhlman et al. (2017) test six scenarios, finding that those in which foreign GMO prod\u2011 ucts were rejected (captured by a reduction in imports) in Europe and the introduction of a carbon tax were the most effective for promoting legume production. The scenario combining a tax on meat consumption and a subsidy for the consumption of vegetables has a neutral effect on the acreage devoted to legume crops, due to the decrease in the land used for soya as a result of the decrease in meat production. Deppermann et al. (2018) use the Globiom model to simulate the impacts of restricting animal feed to using only local raw materials until 2050; it resulted in a decrease in milk and meat production, as well as in the acreage used for grain production (replaced by legumes). The authors found that the gain in protein indepen dence came at the expense of self\u2011sufficiency for animal prod\u2011 ucts and grains. Jensen et al. (2021) use the Aglink\u2011Cosimo model developed by OECD and FAO to quantify the impact of three scenarios on European protein autonomy: a subsidy coupled to land used for legume production, an increase in pea and soya yields and finally a halt in palm oil imports for biodiesel production. A priori, the latter scenario should stimulate European rapeseed oil production (to replace palm oil) and simultaneously European rapeseed cake production, thereby reducing the need to import soya cake. The authors find that only the second scenario (increased yields) leads to a significant improvement in European protein self\u2011suffi\u2011 ciency. Lastly, Gotch et al. (2021) examine the economic issues related to the legal status of crops derived from new genome editing tech\u2011 nologies. For these authors, the economic and environmental impacts are negative, consider\u2011 able and quite similar to those calculated by\nDeppermann et al. (2018) if the EU keeps these products in the GMO category.\nIn all the above\u2011mentioned studies, the methods applied do not explicitly differentiate between the GMO and non\u2011GMO sectors, mainly because of the lack of data to measure them, but more theoretical studies have investigated the impacts of the introduction of GMO technologies and their regulation. For example, Moschini et al. (2005) concluded that the introduction of GMO food products would have a negative impact on the European economy due to the high costs of traceability and segregation. This is also due to the resistance of European consumers to taking up these products/technologies, as recently measured by Marette et al. (2021)."

            "text": "Compared to the various macroeconomic models mentioned above, our CGE model makes it possible to simultaneously consider consumers, producers and the entire sector, with two major original elements: the database constructed and the specification of the behaviour of economic agents. Indeed, this model describes the French agricultural and agri\u2011food sectors in great detail, distinguishing between sectors described as certified non\u2011GMO and other sectors (\u201cconven\u2011 tional\u201d). Clearly, this separation in two of the diversity of French agricultural sectors is reduc\u2011 tive, as it, for instance, places the organic sector and others that use plant protection products in the former group, but it is still an improvement on existing models, which generally consider a single market/technology for each product. Moreover, the specification of producer/ consumer behaviour is more complex than conventional CES production/utility functions, in order to better capture the economic trade\u2011offs of these agents between the two sectors.\nOur CGE model is otherwise traditional in its general principles: it is a static model, allowing the analysis of steady states and not the dynamics between these states; it presup\u2011 poses pure and perfect competition in all product markets, with the price balancing supply and demand. It is a single\u2011country model centred on France; trade with other countries is specified with the traditional Armington specification. The economic behaviours of agents in the \u201cRest of the World\u201d are specified through export and import demand functions.\nFor the macroeconomic closure, we assumed that investment is determined by savings, which is itself determined by an exogenous savings\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022122\nrate for French households. Public consumption of goods and subsidy/tax rates on the various cash flows are also fixed. The balance of the State budget is ensured by a variation in net levies on households. Finally, the trade balance is fixed and the real exchange rate endogenous. Kilkenny & Robinson (1990) showed that none of these macroeconomic assumptions had any substantial bearing on the market impacts that we measure and constitute the aim of this article. In the same vein, Gohin & Moschini (2006) showed that for agricultural policy reform scenarios, the impacts on markets measured by a CGE model were very similar to a partial equilibrium (PE)\nmodel defined on the same sectors of interest. In this article, we opted for the use of the full CGE model, which poses no additional difficulties in terms of data resolution and acquisition; CGE modelling, which satisfies Walras\u2019 law, ensures the economic consistency of the findings.\nThe database of our CGE model is a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) representing the macroeconomic accounts of the French socio\u2011economic system; its structure is detailed in the Box below. The remainder of this section sets out the main specifications of economic behaviour and the three scenarios tested.\nBox \u2013 The Social Accounting Matrix\nThe basic SAM at the French level was constructed based on the tables of the National Accounts (INSEE): Input\u2011Output Table (IOT) and Table of Integrated Economic Accounts (TIEA), in the version that includes 17 activities. At this stage, there is only one aggregate sector for agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Agricultural production was then differentiated from forestry and fishing, and the products of the French agricultural sector were differentiated using different data sources from INSEE and Agreste: Resource\u2011Use Balances (RUB), supply balances, agricultural accounts and price or quote data. A distinction was also made between the various agri\u2011food sectors and their energy consumption based on ESANE, a system used for the compilation of INSEE\u2019s annual company statistics, FranceAgriMer\u2019s statistical data, Agreste\u2019s Enqu\u00eates triennales sur l\u2019alimentation animale (three\u2011yearly surveys on animal feed) and INSEE\u2019s Enqu\u00eate annuelle sur les consommations d\u2019\u00e9nergie dans l\u2019industrie (annual survey on industrial energy consumption \u2013 EACEI). Next, a distinction was made between farms in Brittany and the Loire region, which are particularly active in livestock production, and the rest of France using data derived mainly from regional agricultural accounts, the Tables de l\u2019Agriculture Bretonne (TAB) and the memento of agricultural statistics of Pays de la Loire. The main originality of our SAM lies in the distinction between conventional and certified non\u2011GMO goods for a number of products from agriculture and the agri\u2011food industries, whether produced, traded or consumed on the French market. Only limited data are available on animal products fed with or without GMOs. We used the study by Tillie & Rodr\u00edguez\u2011Cerezo (2015) whose data date back to 2012 and concern the European markets for certified non\u2011GMO soya and its by\u2011products (see table below). Market data were collected for 14 EU countries, including France, for three types of soya\u2011derived products: soya beans, soya cake and soya\u2011containing compound feed for livestock. We used these data to make assumptions about the quantities and prices of various certified GMO\u2011free products (including concentrate feed, milk, meat).\nTable \u2013 Characteristics of non\u2011GMO markets Data % non\u2011GMO (quantity) Premium/additional cost (%) Soya bean imports 10 +15.65 Soya cake imports 10 +20.10 Production of concentrate feed for poultry 10 Production of concentrate feed for cattle 19 Production of concentrate feed for swine 7 Concentrate feed +18.85 Cost of broiler chicken production +19.50 Cost of milk production +7.50 Cost of pork production +14.50 Consumer price of poultry meat +16.20 Consumer price of eggs +16.40 Consumer price of milk +12.70 Consumer price of pork +14.00\nSources: Tillie & Rodriguez\u2011Cerezo (2015)\nWe had access to the quantities of non\u2011GMO certified and conventional soya and soya cake imports and the quantities of non\u2011GMO certified compound feed produced in France for poultry, cattle and swine. Based on operator surveys, Tillie & Rodr\u00ecguez\u2011Cerezo (2015) also provided the additional costs of non\u2011GMO certified soya, soya cake or concentrate feed according to regulatory tolerance thresholds. The authors also estimated the increase in production costs for one kilogram of chicken, milk and pork from certified non\u2011GMO fed animals and the difference in retail prices for animal products labelled as being derived from non\u2011GMO fed animals. \u2794\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 123\nProtein Deficit in France \u2013 A Prospective Analysis"

Three farms are included in our model: one representative of the agricultural sector in Pays de la Loire, one representative of Brittany and one representative of the rest of France. We only distinguish between the two main French regions for livestock production in terms of agricultural production due to availability of the data. Each farm maximises its profits under technical constraints. The decision variables are the inputs specific to each output, acreage allocated to the different crops, numbers of animals, non\u2011attributable intermediate consumption (such as insurance services) and salaried jobs. The maximisation programme depends on input and output prices, fixed factors (material and building capital, total agricultural surface area and self\u2011employed\nlabour) and technological possibilities. For the latter, we follow Koutchad\u00e9 et al. (2021) and model crop yields using a quadratic func\u2011 tion specific to each crop, dependent on the quantities of inputs used (fertilisers and plant protection products). However, these yields do not depend on the number of hectares culti\u2011 vated. Gross margins are derived per hectare for each crop, assuming that producers determine the optimal crop rotations that maximise the sum of these margins multiplied by the acreage allocated to these crops, minus a concave cost function dependent on acreage. We proceed in the same way for each animal activity: the yields per animal are then quadratic func\u2011 tions of feed intake (concentrates and fodder for herbivores), and the optimal numbers of animals maximise the sum of margins minus a concave cost function which depends on the number of animals.\nTechnologies in multi\u2011product sectors are traditionally specified with CES functions. The results are then used to model land use trade\u2011offs and came under significant criticism due to the non\u2011additivity of quantities. Gohin (2020) solved the problem by developing a quadratic approach. However, it is parameter\u2011 intensive.

Next, we estimated the number of animals fed with certified non\u2011GMO feed in relation to certified non\u2011GMO concentrate feed produced in France. In order to determine the value of the certified non\u2011GMO production of the various animal products, we applied marked\u2011up producer prices, assuming that these producer prices reflected the increase in production costs estimated in Tillie & Rodr\u00ecguez\u2011Cerezo (2015). For the agri\u2011food sector, we assumed that the production of products from non\u2011GMO fed animals is proportional to the domestic production of non\u2011GMO fed animals and that the increase in production costs at the farmer level is passed on along the chain. For household consumption, we assumed that the proportion of certified non\u2011GMO goods is the same as that of certified non\u2011GMO goods produced in France. We applied the premium paid by consumers for certified non\u2011GMO products as estimated in the report by Tillie & Rodriguez\u2011Cerez (2015) and reported in the table to the values obtained. Overall, our analysis distinguished between 26 agricultural products(i) and 19 products from the agri\u2011food industry.(ii)\n(i) For crop production, we distinguished between soft wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, non-GMO soya, conventional soya, sunflower, peas, faba beans and other oilseeds, fodder, fruit and vegetables and beet. For animal production, we distinguished between cattle, calves, swine, milk, poultry and eggs, and for each of these products, we determined the proportion of non-GMO products. The remainder of these values is classified as \u201cother agricultural products\u201d.

It is therefore assumed that a minimum necessary amount is allocated to food and non\u2011food goods. This expenditure system makes it possible to capture non\u2011homothetic income effects, which are regularly estimated in econo\u2011 metric studies conducted on both microeconomic and macroeconomic data. The choice between food and non\u2011food goods is made according to a Cobb\u2011Douglas function, which is not critically important in our analysis, as prices of other goods vary little in the simulated scenarios.\nWithin food goods, consumers then make a choice between meat, dairy products, eggs, cooking oils and other food goods, again using a LES function. The choice between other food goods (fruit, beverages, etc.) is made according to a Cobb\u2011Douglas function, again without prejudice, as the prices of these goods vary little in our scenarios. A choice is also made between different meats (beef, pork, poultry and other meats) according to a new LES function. The final level of decision\u2011making is between certified non\u2011GMO and conventional products and concerns eggs, dairy products and different meats. This last level of trade\u2011off is specified by a CES\u2011LES function. This function, which is used in the MIRAGE model, is parsimonious, regular and more flexible than the LES function in taking into account price effects, the latter restricting goods to the status of gross comple\u2011 ments. This allows for greater relevance in the analysis of a change in French consumer demand for GMO\u2011free food products."

            "text": "The parameters of the production and utility functions are calibrated using SAM data and price or expenditure elasticity. For agricultural supply, the parameters are determined on the basis of the econometric findings of Koutchad\u00e9 et al. (2021). For example, the price elasticity of wheat production is 0.55, broken down into a surface area effect (0.50) and yield effect (0.05). For (non\u2011GMO) soya produced in France, these elasticities are respectively 0.80, 0.54 and 0.26. For final household demand, we rely mainly on the econometric findings of Caillavet et al. (2016), and for the distinction between non\u2011GMO and conventional food goods on the recent econometric estimates on organic dairy products by Lindstr\u00f6m (2021). For trade, we assume that France is a small country on the world markets for agricultural and agri\u2011food products. The same values were therefore adopted for the price elasticities of export demand (to the nearest whole number), import supply and Armington substitution elasticities.\nFontagn\u00e9 et al. (2022), who have estimated these elasticities econometrically, find values close to 10 for animal products. This value is therefore used for conventional food products. However, to reflect the preferences of French households for local and certified non\u2011GMO products, we retain a value of 0.1 for the own\u2011price elasticity of import supply in order to take account of the fact that foreign producers may also want to offer certified non\u2011GMO food products, competing with those produced in France, especially for French households located near land borders (with Germany for example). Similarly, the own price elasticity of export demand is set at \u22120.1. This means that foreign consumers also tend to favour domestic non\u2011GMO production. These two elasticities are not supported at all by the econometric estimation, so we conduct a sensi\u2011 tivity analysis of the results obtained with these elasticities."

            "heading": "3.2. Definition of Scenarios",
            "text": "A number of proposals have been made to improve protein self\u2011sufficiency, at the national and/or European level (see literature review). Here, we consider three contrasting scenarios in terms of protein independence strategies, all tested on our model calibrated for the year 2011, for two reasons: on the one hand, this avoids the need to establish a reference scenario (e.g. for 2030), which is a tricky exercise: for example, there is a lack of information to quantify the trend in certified non\u2011GMO sectors in France over the last ten years. On the other hand, the main economic variables have shown little change over the last ten years, the main excep\u2011 tions being the steady decline in the number of farms, the rise of soya and the decline in the price of sugar (which was high in 2011 compared to the average of the last ten years). Conversely, the levels of production and prices of the main agricultural commodities observed in 2011 are in line with the average of the last ten years. The results presented here should therefore be understood as the effects that would have occurred in 2011 had these scenarios been implemented, economic stakeholders had adapted to them (according to the elasticities mentioned above) and markets had reached a new steady state.\nThe first scenario (\u201cCoupled subsidies\u201d) is a conventional one that appears in all protein plans and is regularly tested in analyses. It concerns the increase in coupled aid for the cultivation of soya and legumes authorised by the new CAP and already planned in France as part of its national low carbon strategy. It simulates\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 125\nProtein Deficit in France \u2013 A Prospective Analysis\nan amount of coupled aid of \u20ac200/ha for soya, pea and faba bean crops (compared to \u20ac0/ha for soya in 2011 and \u20ac155/ha for peas and faba beans), which is close to the maximum amount of coupled aid paid for the last 10 years for a legume crop.\nThe second scenario (\u201cTechnical progress\u201d) simulates a varietal improvement that would compensate for the productivity gap between legumes and wheat (Magrini et al. 2016) through investment in research, at least initially driven by public authorities. As pointed out by Alston & Pardey (2021), it is not easy to determine the research and development expenditure needed to obtain a given varietal improvement; therefore, the costs associated with this scenario are omitted from our compu\u2011 tations and, as mentioned in the introduction, no normative analysis is conducted. We assume that this varietal improvement would lead, all else being equal, to an increase in yield per hectare of 25% for peas/faba beans/soya and 12.5% for fodder. Note that Jensen et al. (2021) made more conservative assumptions (8% for the former, 0% for the latter), consistent for these latter crops with almost zero efforts in recent years in terms of varietal selection for grassland forage species (ACTA, 2021). These conservative assumptions are also consistent with the vision of lock\u2011in described in Magrini et al. (2016), where research efforts focused primarily on \u201cmain\u201d plants. As a counterpoint, new genome editing technologies no longer focus exclusively on these plants; some are applied to protein and fodder crops (alfalfa, ryegrass) (Parisi & Rodriguez\u2011Cerezo, 2021). It is impossible to predict whether these new technologies will be authorised in France and in Europe in the short\u2011to\u2011medium or long term. Our aim here is just to test a breaking scenario.\nThe third scenario (\u201cDemand\u201d) simulates an increase in consumer demand for French and certified non\u2011GMO products. We then assume a doubling of the demand for eggs, poultry and pork, all else being equal. Initially these demands represent 10%, 10% and 7% of total demand for these products by French households in terms of volume. For certified non\u2011GMO beef and dairy products, the initial levels of demand are higher (20%) and a 50% increase is assumed. Correspondingly, demand for conventional products decline such that initial budgets are unchanged. As the prices of certified non\u2011GMO products are higher than those of conventional products, these assump\u2011 tions imply a decrease in the overall quantities consumed. These assumed trends (all else being\nequal) are based on increases in the consumption of organic products in recent years and on the health, environmental and societal concerns of households. Therefore, according to CR\u00c9DOC surveys summarised in FranceAgriMer (2018), the \u201cMade in France\u201d criterion has become the main criterion for choice, ahead of price and food safety. This third scenario is in line with a trend identified in Soler & Thomas (2020) of French households preferring to consume smaller quantities of better quality food. It is also consistent with recent analyses quantifying the effects of a reduction in red meat consump\u2011 tion motivated by health and environmental considerations (Cavaillet et al., 2016; Bonnet et al., 2018). Finally, the scale of our shocks (leading to market shares for non\u2011GMO products ranging from 20% to 30%) is consistent with the objective set out in the European Green Pact to reach 25% organic products by 2030."

            "text": "Unsurprisingly, the first scenario involving increased coupled subsidies to soya, pea and faba bean acreage leads to an increase in planted acreage (e.g. 8.6% for soya). The percentage increase is higher for soya than for the other two crops as the increase in the coupled subsidy is also higher. However, these increases remain modest and far from the stated objectives of doubling production. Consider the example of soya. In this scenario, the coupled subsidy is increased from \u20ac0/ha to \u20ac200/ha, which repre\u2011 sents an equivalent price increase of 17.1% based on the initial soya yield. All else being equal, and in particular before modification of the equilibrium prices, this stimulates an increase in soya acreage of 9.2% (given the elasticity of 0.54 reported previously) and there\u2011 fore in production of the same level. Smaller increases are obtained of 8.6% for acreage and 8.1% for production (Table 1\u2011A). Indeed, the additional production leads to a fall in the price of certified non\u2011GMO soya beans (Table 1\u2011B) of around 1.8%, which reduces the initial effect of the subsidy on both planted acreage and yields (a decrease of 0.5%, consistent with the own price elasticity of the soya yield). Another, more limited effect, leading to a modest increase in French soya bean production, stems from the increase in the acreage planted with high\u2011protein peas and faba beans.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022126\nThis supplement of non\u2011GMO French soya beans goes mainly to the French vegetable fat industry, with little change in trade (imports and exports).

However, this repre\u2011 sents an increase of only 1.8% of this tonnage\nas a large proportion (almost 80%) is originally imported (Table 1\u2011C). The consequences are somewhat different for peas and faba beans, as a high percentage (around 30%) is exported. Production supplements are therefore also partly exported, which contributes to a smaller fall in prices (0.4% compared to 1.8% for soya beans).\nTable 1 \u2013 Simulation findings by scenario: variation in level and % from baseline Baseline\nvalue Scenario 1 \u201cCoupled subsidies\u201d Scenario 2 \u201cTechnical progress\u201d Scenario 3 \u201cDemand\u201d\nLevel (%) Level (%) Level (%) A \u2013 Impacts on French crop production (acreage in thousands of hectares, production in thousands of tonnes) Wheat acreage 4,990 \u22121.70 \u22120.03 \u22124.95 \u22120.10 9.55 0.19 Wheat production 36,236 \u221212.15 \u22120.03 \u221237.97 \u22120.10 69.86 0.19 Rapeseed acreage 1,560 \u22120.55 \u22120.04 \u22121.38 \u22120.09 2.49 0.16 Rapeseed production 4,812 \u22121.60 \u22120.03 \u22125.85 \u22120.12 8.23 0.17 Soya acreage 40 3.45 8.62 3.22 8.05 2.80 7.00 Soya production 137 11.06 8.07 44.12 32.20 13.63 9.95 Pea acreage 180 3.02 1.68 11.89 6.60 0.31 0.17 Pea production 1,070 15.69 1.47 318.54 29.77 2.00 0.19 B \u2013 Impacts on prices (\u20ac/tonne) Conventional soya 354 \u22120.13 \u22120.04 \u22121.03 \u22120.29 \u22121.00 \u22120.28 Non\u2011GMO soya 403 \u22127.34 \u22121.82 \u221234.62 \u22128.59 48.92 12.14 Conv. soya cake 300 0.16 0.05 \u22121.50 \u22120.50 \u22121.92 \u22120.64 Non\u2011GMO soya cake 340 \u22125.29 \u22121.55 \u221228.88 \u22128.49 55.41 16.30 Conv. poultry 1,880 0.02 0.00 4.17 0.22 \u22125.36 \u22120.28 Non\u2011GMO poultry 2,120 \u22122.12 \u22120.10 \u221212.13 \u22120.57 214.93 10.14 Soft wheat 183 0.02 0.01 \u22120.26 \u22120.14 0.14 0.08 C \u2013 Impacts on demand for raw materials for animal feed (thousands of tonnes) Wheat 11,328 1.05 0.01 \u2212146.56 \u22121.29 67.70 0.60 Conv. soya cake 3,416 \u22121.30 \u22120.04 \u2212151.92 \u22124.45 \u2212149.94 \u22124.39 Other oil cakes 4,134 \u22123.73 \u22120.09 \u2212145.33 \u22123.52 74.09 1.79 Non\u2011GMO soya cake 452 8.34 1.84 31.57 6.99 17.26 3.82 D \u2013 Impacts on livestock production (thousands of tonnes) Conv. pork 1,895 0.00 0.00 \u22121.65 \u22120.09 \u221294.29 \u22124.98 Non\u2011GMO pork 148 0.01 0.01 0.09 0.06 110.12 74.41 Conv. poultry meat 1,678 \u22120.03 0.00 \u22122.70 \u22120.16 \u2212111.68 \u22126.66 Non\u2011GMO poultry meat 186 0.09 0.05 0.67 0.36 117.96 63.42 Conv. cow\u2019s milk. 19,226 \u22120.55 0.00 416.40 2.17 \u22121,414.47 \u22127.36 Non\u2011GMO cow\u2019s milk 5,880 0.07 0.00 \u22121.07 \u22120.02 2,136.26 36.33 E \u2013 Impacts on trade Wheat (000t) 18,267 \u221211.00 \u22120.06 124.58 0.68 \u221285.16 \u22120.47 Conv. soya cake (000t) 3,061 0.11 0.00 \u2212141.03 \u22124.61 \u2212142.48 \u22124.65 Conv. pork meat (\u20acM) \u221213 0.05 \u22120.36 \u221211.81 90.87 183.52 \u22121,411.72 Conv. poultry meat (\u20acM) 396 0.01 0.00 \u22129.95 \u22122.51 124.75 31.50 Conv. dairy products (\u20acM) 2,344 \u22120.53 \u22120.02 388.70 16.58 988.64 42.18 PRP (\u20acM) \u2212897 6.21 \u22120.69 174.37 \u221219.44 10.46 \u22121.17 Agri/agro balance (\u20acM) 10,843 \u221212.90 \u22120.12 873.58 8.06 1,570.69 14.49 F \u2013 Impacts on business income and employment Farm income (\u20acM) 38,114 10.93 0.03 643.16 1.69 336.34 0.88 AFI income (\u20acM) 29,814 0.04 0.00 74.10 0.25 590.48 1.98 Agricultural salaried employment 230,674 \u22128.03 0.00 4,449.33 1.93 2,743.49 1.19 Agri\u2011food salaried employment 534,661 6.37 0.00 1,142.40 0.21 9,197.38 1.72\nFor meat, the unit of measurement is the tonne of carcass equivalent (see https://www.franceagrimer.fr/FAQ/VIANDES/Viandes\u2011Que\u2011signifie\u2011T.E.C).

The use of soft wheat in animal feed even increases slightly, comple\u2011 menting the rations fed to poultry. The increases in certified non\u2011GMO granivore and herbivore production (Table 1\u2011D) are actually very limited, the most significant in percentage being poultry production, which is more reliant on soya cake than other animal production.\nIn terms of trade in products (Table 1\u2011E), net exports of soft wheat fall slightly, mainly due to a slight decrease in allocated production and acreage. More surprising is the near stagnation of imports of conventional soya cake, while their use in animal feed falls slightly. This is due to the fact that the French fat sector uses its crushing plants more frequently for the crushing of certified non\u2011GMO soya beans than for that of conventional soya beans, resulting in a decrease in French production of conventional soya cake. However, imports of conventional soya beans decrease, causing the French PRP balance to improve by 6.4 million euro. Protein self\u2011sufficiency improves, but only marginally. In contrast, the French agricultural and agri\u2011food trade balance deteriorates by around 12.8 million euro, mainly due to the decline in grain exports.\nWhile this scenario improves farm incomes by almost 11 million euro for an additional budgetary expenditure of 21 million euro, i.e. a transfer efficiency of 0.5 (Table 1\u2011F), this does not lead to an increase in paid labour in agriculture, but rather to an increase in the rental value of agricultural land. This scenario bene\u2011 fits vegetable production, which is relatively less labour\u2011intensive and more land\u2011intensive. The impacts on the agri\u2011food industries are negligible.\nIn general, for this scenario, the main results of our simulation are consistent with those obtained in the literature (e.g. Jensen et al., 2021), which emphasise the modest impacts of acreage\u2011based subsidies on the markets. Our main contribution is to show the differentiated impacts between the conventional and certified non\u2011GMO sectors. This first scenario also gives credibility to our modelling choices."

            "text": "Some of the mechanisms identified above are also at work in our second scenario. Indeed, all else being equal, an increase in yields leads to an increase in margins per hectare, which encour\u2011 ages a change in crop rotation in favour of seed\nand forage legumes. This results in an increase of 8% in the French acreage of non\u2011GMO soya beans (Table 1\u2011A). In contrast to the previous scenario, the increases are higher in terms of percentage of production (close to 32% for soya beans) due to the exogenous increase in yields. In fact, the increase in production once again leads to price reductions (exceeding 8% for non\u2011GMO soya beans, Table 1\u2011B), which limit the increase in yields and ultimately production. The increase in legume acreage is at the expense of all other arable crops; forage acreages are also down slightly because yield growth is assumed to be lower.\nIn terms of animal feed (Table 1\u2011C), we again see an increase in the use of certified non\u2011GMO soya cake, which is more competitive in price. By contrast, reductions in the use of other PRPs are significant, especially conventional soya cake (of the order of \u2212150,000 tonnes) and even grains (by a similar tonnage for wheat). This is explained by the increase in the production of fodder for own consumption. In fact, production of herbivores increases (Table 1\u2011D), with total milk production increasing by 1.6%, i.e. by over 400 million litres.\nThis scenario leads to an increase in certified non\u2011GMO granivore production, to the detri\u2011 ment of conventional granivore production, as the cost of certified non\u2011GMO feed is reduced. Conversely, conventional milk production increases and milk production from non\u2011GMO fed cows stagnates. This is due to the greater weight of fodder in the production costs of conventional milk than in those of certified non\u2011GMO milk. Indeed, all fodder produced in France is non\u2011GMO and can therefore be used in both sectors. However, the non\u2011GMO sectors are subject to additional traceability and labelling costs (cf. section 3.1 for sizing).\nIn terms of trade (Table 1\u2011E), this scenario leads to a significant decrease in imports of conventional soya cake (nearly 150,000 tonnes) and, at the same time, an almost equivalent increase in net exports of wheat, mainly due to the above\u2011mentioned effects on animal feed. Although net exports of white meats decline, net exports of dairy products increase very strongly, also contributing to the improvement of the French agricultural and agri\u2011food trade balance: this gain approaches one billion euro.\nThis scenario is also positive in terms of agri\u2011 cultural and agri\u2011food income as well as salaried employment in both sectors (Table 1\u2011F). In particular, the increase in salaried agricultural employment is significant because livestock\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022128\nactivities (especially dairy) are labour intensive. Employment increases comparatively more slowly in the agri\u2011food industries, as the positive effects obtained in the meat and dairy industries are partially mitigated by a decline in employ\u2011 ment in the compound feed industry.\nOnce again, the main results for this scenario are qualitatively in line with those obtained in the literature (e.g. Jensen et al., 2021), which emphasise the importance of technological progress. Our results appear stronger, mainly because we assumed an increase in forage yields of 12.5%. In fact they are critically dependent on this assumption. If, conversely, we assume no increase in forage yields, the impacts are once again modest, as in the first scenario. Fodder is rarely studied in global macroeconomic approaches (Gohin, 2020), usually due to the lack of available data, but our analysis illus\u2011 trates the importance of taking it into account in agri\u2011environmental issues."

            "text": "The logic of the counterpart of this third scenario is different. The shift in demand towards French certified non\u2011GMO products leads to an increase in the prices of the relevant products (Table 1\u2011B). Conversely, it leads to price decreases for conventional products. For example, the increase is 10.1% for certified non\u2011GMO poultry meat with a decrease of 0.3% for the conventional counterpart. These price changes are necessary to stimulate a shift in supply from French farmers and agri\u2011food companies. Demand for certified non\u2011GMO raw materials for animal feed is increasing, justifying a price increase of more than 16% for certified non\u2011GMO soya cake. The increase in the price of certified non\u2011GMO soya beans, however, is slightly less (12%) because, in our scenario, the soya oil extracted from them is not more valuable to French consumers.\nUnsurprisingly, this scenario also leads to an increase in legume and soya bean acreage (Table 1\u2011A) and, on the other hand, to an increase in grain and oilseed acreage. At the end of the simulation, only fodder acreage decreased. The main explanation is that the increase in demand for certified non\u2011GMO white meat is higher than that for livestock products (red meat and dairy products). However, white meat production does not require fodder, only simple and compound concentrated feed.\nThis scenario too leads to a significant decline in the use of conventional soya cake in animal feed (150,000 tonnes, Table 1\u2011C). This decline\nis partly offset by certified non\u2011GMO soya cake and partly by the consumption of other oilseeds, particularly rapeseed produced in France, i.e. non\u2011GMO. There is also an increase in the use of soft wheat for animal feed for the same reasons.\nTotal animal production (certified non\u2011GMO and conventional) increases (Table 1\u2011D) even though total French demand for these products decreases. For example, French pork production increases by 16,000 tonnes. This is due to terms of trade effects: conventional French production becomes more competitive in price. Indeed, agri\u2011food companies make better margins on certified non\u2011GMO products sold on the domestic market, which allows them to reduce their margins on conventional production.\nThis scenario leads to a considerable increase, of more than 1.5 billion euro, in the French trade surplus in agricultural and agri\u2011food products (Table 1\u2011E), mainly due to animal products. In contrast, the PRP deficit is barely reduced (by only 10 million euro). In fact, the decline in imports of conventional soya cake is offset primarily by an increase in imports of other oilseed cakes and to a lesser extent by a decline in exports of peas and faba beans.\nThis scenario is favourable to agricultural and agri\u2011food incomes, as well as to salaried employment in these sectors (Table 1\u2011F). The percentage effects are strong for agri\u2011food indus\u2011 tries, especially the dairy and meat industries, which are the target of new French consumer demands. Unlike the previous two, this scenario does not lead to an increase in the rental value of agricultural land, so the increase in agricultural incomes primarily benefits active farmers."

            "text": "The findings presented above obviously depend on many modelling assumptions and choices with regard to the calibration of behavioural parameters. As noted in section 3.1, the choice of many parameters was based on econometric studies. The notable exception concerns the parameters governing trade in non\u2011GMO prod\u2011 ucts. So far, we have assumed low own\u2011price elasticities of export demand and import supply for these products (\u22120.1 and 0.1) compared to conventional products (\u221210 and 10). In this sensitivity analysis, the latter values are assumed for both product types (i.e. \u221210 and 10). This is an extreme calibration as it implies that French households no longer favour local products, and similarly foreign consumers no longer favour their local production.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022 129\nProtein Deficit in France \u2013 A Prospective Analysis\nThis alternative calibration only marginally affects the results of the first coupled subsidy scenario, as the price impacts are small with the standard version. For example, the price of non\u2011GMO soya beans falls by 1.2%, compared to 1.8% with the central calibration.\nThe results of the second crop improvement scenario change more significantly. For example, the fall in the prices of non\u2011GMO soya beans and soya cake amounts to 5%, compared with 8.5% with the central calibration. This is because it becomes easier for French producers to export their additional production of non\u2011GMO soya beans and soya cake on the world market, which limits the price drop. However, this does not lead to a significant change in the French protein deficit, which is reduced by 181 million euro, compared to 174 million euro with the central calibration. That is because at the same time, net trade in conventional oil cakes improves less, as these are still used in animal feed due to price effects. The effects on agricultural and agri\u2011food incomes are unchanged.\nThe results of the demand change scenario also change perceptibly. The price increase for non\u2011GMO poultry is only 6.6%, compared to 10.1% with the central calibration. Again, this does not lead to a significant change in the French protein deficit: the balance improves by 24 million euro, compared to 10 million euro with the central calibration. Again, this results from a substitution between GMO soya cake and other oil cakes. Finally, it is worth noting that, in this scenario, farm incomes do not improve with the alternative calibration, whereas they increase by 336 million euro with the central calibration. This is due to lower animal production (espe\u2011 cially milk), which generates more value added than crop production.\n* * *\nFrench protein independence is a nearly 50\u2011year\u2011old antiphon, which endures to this day, in the face of economic pressures. Will the new context \u2013 characterised by the health crisis that emerged in 2020, the increasingly perceptible changes in societal demands in favour of the environment and localism, and the emergence of new plant breeding technologies \u2013 allow these economic pressures to be over\u2011 come? This article provides some answers to this question through the development of an original\neconomic model and the quantification of three contrasting scenarios.\nThe results of our simulations show that changes in French consumer demand for products derived from non\u2011GMO fed animals is a much more powerful driver for reducing soya cake imports than traditional coupled subsidies for legume crops. However, this demand scenario does not lead to a significant improvement in protein self\u2011sufficiency, as imports of other oil cakes increase. The trade balance of agricultural and agri\u2011food products improves significantly, mainly due to the increase in net exports of dairy products. Moreover, this demand scenario increases the income of agri\u2011food activities, slightly less so those of agricultural activities, stimulating their net job creation.\nThe scenario of coupled support for legume acreage, which is the preferred scenario in all the protein plans that have succeeded one another over the past 30 years, has little effect on the markets for plant\u2011based products and no effect on the markets for animal products. French legume production grows less than the dedicated acreage, as coupled subsidies do not provide an incentive to increase yields. As a result, the effects on agricultural and agri\u2011food incomes are barely noticeable.\nIn contrast, the scenario of crop improvement for fodder and seed legumes logically leads, by extending the scope of possibilities, to an improvement in protein self\u2011sufficiency, in the agricultural and agri\u2011food trade balance, as well as in agricultural and agri\u2011food revenues. French households enjoy an additional supply of white meat from non\u2011GMO\u2011fed animals. However, the growth of fodder has a negative impact on the compound feed sector.\nIn short, this quantitative study shows that several drivers are necessary to reduce the French protein deficit and that this reduction cannot depend solely on public action but also on citizens in their consumer behaviour and acceptance or not of new technologies.\nAs in any empirical study, many hypotheses were put forward to obtain the above findings, which require further exploration. In particular, a more detailed representation of the agricultural sectors beyond that used in this article with the original separation of the certified non\u2011GMO sectors in France (distinction of the organic sectors or pulses used directly in human food) would help to improve robustness.\nECONOMIE ET STATISTIQUE / ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS N\u00b0\u00a0536-37, 2022130\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nACTA (2021).

Aucune proposition initiale de plus de 12 500 mots (11 500 pour les soumissions en anglais) ne sera examin\u00e9e.\nLa soumission doit comporter deux fichiers distincts :\n\u2022 Un fichier d\u2019une page indiquant : le titre de l\u2019article ; le pr\u00e9nom et nom, les affiliations (maximum deux), l\u2019adresse e-mail et postale de chaque auteur ; un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de 160 mots maximum (soit environ 1 050 signes espaces compris) qui doit pr\u00e9senter tr\u00e8s bri\u00e8vement la probl\u00e9matique, indiquer la source et donner les principaux axes et conclusions de la recherche ; les codes JEL et quelques mots-cl\u00e9s ; d\u2019\u00e9ventuels remerciements.\n\u2022 Un fichier anonymis\u00e9 du manuscrit complet (texte, illustrations, bibliographie, \u00e9ventuelles annexes) indiquant en premi\u00e8re page uniquement le titre, le r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les codes JEL et les mots-cl\u00e9s.\nLes propositions retenues sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es par deux \u00e0 trois rapporteurs (proc\u00e9dure en \u00ab\u00a0 double-aveugle\u00a0 \u00bb). Les articles accept\u00e9s pour publication devront \u00eatre mis en forme suivant les consignes aux auteurs (accessibles sur https://www.insee.fr/fr/ information/2410168). Ils pourront faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un travail \u00e9ditorial visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer leur lisibilit\u00e9 et leur pr\u00e9sentation formelle.\nPublication\nLes articles sont publi\u00e9s en fran\u00e7ais dans l\u2019\u00e9dition papier et simultan\u00e9ment en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais dans l\u2019\u00e9dition \u00e9lectronique. Celle-ci est disponible, en acc\u00e8s libre, sur le site de l\u2019Insee, le jour m\u00eame de la publication\u00a0; cette mise en ligne imm\u00e9diate et gratuite donne aux articles une grande visibilit\u00e9. La revue est par ailleurs accessible sur le portail francophone Pers\u00e9e, et r\u00e9f\u00e9renc\u00e9e sur le site international Repec et dans la base EconLit.\nMain objectives of the journal\nEconomie et Statistique / Economics and Statistics publishes articles covering any micro- or macro- economic or sociological topic, either using data from public statistics or other sources. Particular attention is paid to rigor in the statistical approach and clarity in the concepts and analyses. In order to meet the journal aims, the main conclusions of the articles, as well as possible limitations, should be written to be accessible to an audience not necessarily specialist of the topic.\nSubmissions\nManuscripts can be submitted either in French or in English; they should be sent to the editorial team (redaction-ecostat@insee.fr), preferably in MS-Word format. The manuscript must be original work and not submitted at the same time to any other journal. The standard length of an article is of about 10,000 words (including boxes if needed, tables and figures, appendices, bibliography, but not counting online appendices if any). Manuscripts of more than 11,500 words will not be considered. Submissions must include two separate files:\n\u2022 A one-page file providing: the title of the article; the first name, name, affiliation-s (at most two), e-mail et postal addresses of each author; an abstract of maximum 160 words (about 1050 characters including spaces), briefly presenting the question(s), data and methodology, and the main conclusions; JEL codes and a few keywords; acknowledgements.\n\u2022 An anonymised manuscript (including the main text, illustrations, bibliography and appendices if any), mentioning only the title, abstract, JEL codes and keywords on the front page.\nProposals that meet the journal objectives are reviewed by two to three referees (\u201cdouble-blind\u201d review). The articles accepted for publication will have to be presented according to the guidelines for authors (available at https://www.insee.fr/en/ information/2591257). They may be subject to editorial work aimed at improving their readability and formal presentation.\nPublication\nThe articles are published in French in the printed edition, and simultaneously in French and in English in the online edition. The online issue is available, in open access, on the Insee website the day of its publication; this immediate and free online availability gives the articles a high visibility. The journal is also available online on the French portal Pers\u00e9e, and indexed in Repec and EconLit.\nEconomics StatisticsAND\nEconomie Statistique ET\nN\u00b0 536-37 - 2022\nISBN 978-2-11-162370-5 - ISSN 0336-1454 - ECO 536-37 Parution d\u00e9cembre 2022 - PRIX : 17,20 \u20ac 9 7 8 2 1 1 1 6 2 3 7 0 5 N\u00b0\n5 36\n-3 7\n- 2 02\n2 EC\nO N\nO M\nIE E\nT ST\nA TI\nST IQ\nU E\n/ EC\nO N\nO M\nIC S\nA N\nD S\nTA TI\nST IC\nS"
