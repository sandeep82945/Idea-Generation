1. **Investigate the effect of Puramatrix™ hydrogel on the chondrogenic differentiation of other cell types, such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).** This would help to determine the versatility of Puramatrix™ as a chondrogenic differentiation platform and its potential for use in a wider range of clinical applications.


2. **Explore the use of Puramatrix™ hydrogel as a delivery vehicle for chondrogenic growth factors or other bioactive molecules.** This could potentially enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of hASCs and improve the quality of the engineered cartilage tissue.


3. **Investigate the long-term stability and biocompatibility of Puramatrix™ hydrogel in vivo.** This would be important for assessing the safety and efficacy of Puramatrix™ for use in clinical applications.


4. **Study the effect of Puramatrix™ hydrogel on the integration of engineered cartilage tissue with native cartilage.** This would be important for determining the potential of Puramatrix™ to be used in cartilage repair or regeneration strategies.


5. **Develop a 3D bioprinting approach to create Puramatrix™-based cartilage constructs with controlled architecture and composition.** This would allow for the fabrication of patient-specific cartilage constructs with improved functional properties.
