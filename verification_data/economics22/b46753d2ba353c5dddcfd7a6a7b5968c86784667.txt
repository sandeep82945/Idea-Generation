Based on the provided text, the portions mentioning future research directions or areas that require further investigation are as follows:

1. "However, although resource and waste management represent a topical and current concern, little research has been conducted on the environmental impacts of tourism, and additional investigations must be addressed to enhance environmental sustainability."

2. "Although several authors and practitioners have experienced, explored, and tested circular economy and sustainability strategies in the hospitality industry, a comprehensive and critical review on this topic still needs to be conducted."

3. "Still, several major issues in this area are under-researched, such as their related environmental externalities and issues, such as food waste or packaging waste, which represent an increasing share on a global scale."

4. "The same trends are detected in lodging accommodation-industry research, which appears marginally interested in waste management. Although restaurants and hotels have the potential to quantify food waste and packaging waste, which are mainly produced in the final consumption stage and especially outdoors, several authors have not addressed their efforts towards this issue, instead focusing on air emissions related to energy consumption or water pollution, yet neglecting all the hidden costs associated with waste generation, from cradle to grave."

5. "Our research confirms a lack of harmonized indicators for measuring ecological transition, as well as a lack of data. In light of the uncommon measurement and monitoring tools used in the hospitality industry, public authorities should suggest practices, together with a set of indicators to monitor the environmental transition, with also a set of homogeneous and standardized measurement methodologies, which could boost comparability and replicability among food services and lodging accommodation activities."

6. "Although the European Union, through the Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/1597 on common methodologies and minimum quality requirements for the homogeneous assessment of food waste quantities and composition, has suggested suitable tools to measure food waste, hotels and restaurants have not yet considered the importance of measurement and monitoring practices."

These excerpts suggest areas for future research, including the need for more comprehensive reviews on sustainability strategies in the hospitality industry, addressing under-researched issues like environmental externalities and waste management, developing harmonized indicators for ecological transition, and emphasizing the importance of measurement and monitoring practices in the hospitality sector.
