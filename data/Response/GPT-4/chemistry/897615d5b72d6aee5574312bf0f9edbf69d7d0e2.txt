Integration of Capsomer Surface Charge Effects into Assembly Models: The preliminary investigation into charged capsomers highlighted the impact of electrostatic forces on assembly behavior. Future research could further explore the detailed role of surface charges in capsid assembly, including the effects of varying charge distributions and strengths. Studies could aim to understand how different patterns of charge distribution on capsomers influence the self-assembly process and the stability of the resulting structures under various ionic strength conditions.

Exploration of Capsomer-Capsomer Interaction Dynamics: While this study focuses on steric attraction and capsomer deformability, future research could delve deeper into the dynamics of capsomer-capsomer interactions. This could include investigating how transient binding events, characterized by a balance of bond-forming and bond-breaking, are influenced by capsomer deformability and interaction strength. Such research might offer insights into optimizing conditions for reversible interactions that promote efficient self-assembly.

Development of Multi-Scale Models: The current model provides insights at a specific scale of assembly. Future studies could develop multi-scale models that bridge the gap between atomistic details and the coarse-grained approach presented here. These models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the assembly process by incorporating detailed atomic interactions, hydrodynamic effects, and the influence of the surrounding medium, potentially leading to more accurate predictions of assembly outcomes and kinetics.

Study of Environmental and Solution Conditions on Assembly: The assembly behavior of capsomers is influenced by solution conditions such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength. Future research could systematically study these effects, particularly focusing on how changes in environmental conditions alter the deformability and interaction strengths of capsomers. This could lead to a better understanding of how viruses assemble in diverse biological contexts and inform the design of assembly conditions for nanotechnological applications.

Application to Heterogeneous Capsid Assembly: This study primarily considers the self-assembly of identical capsomers. Future research could extend this model to explore the assembly of heterogeneous capsomers, which is relevant for viruses that assemble from multiple types of protein subunits. Investigating the rules governing the co-assembly of different capsomer types could unveil new principles of capsid organization and offer strategies for designing complex nanostructures with specified functions.
