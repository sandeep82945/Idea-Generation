Increased generic competition has created opportunities for low-cost generic drugs to enter and scale up their use (8). As a result of policies and the successive expiration of patents for originator drugs, the size of Chinese generic market continues to increase. These low-cost generic drugs are expected to further moderate the growth of China\u2019s basic medical insurance fund expenditures. China\u2019s market share and influence in the world are continuing to rise, and it has now become the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world after the United States, and Chinese drug prices are receiving widespread attention from the global market. However, we do have some concerns about competition and price in the generic drug industry in China. In the Chinese market, although generic companies have large production capacity, lower costs for raw materials and labor, and a huge amount and market for generic drugs, etc. (9). Unfortunately, the quality of generic drugs is not high, and we doubt that generic OPEN ACCESS",

To find out how the generic competition affects drug price in this area, this study examines how the quantity of generic drug manufacturers can influence average drug price in the Chinese market.\nMethods: This study uses a rigorous selection of drugs from the 2021 China\u2019s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), and uses drug-level fixed effects regressions to estimate the relationship between competition and price within each drug.\nResults: We note that drug prices decline with increasing competition in the Chinese market, but not in a perfectly linear manner, with marginal price declines decreasing after the fourth entrant and \u201crebounding\u201d at subsequent entrants, especially the sixth.\nDiscussion: The findings suggest the importance of maintaining effective competition between suppliers to control prices, and that the government needs to further control generic pricing, especially for late entry generics, to ensure effective competition in the Chinese market.\nKEYWORDS\ngeneric drug, competition, drug price, China, pharmaceutical industry\n1.

On the other hand, although there are 2,210 ANDA applications for generic drug registration in China in 2021, representing a 81.30% increase over the previous year (13). we\u00a0find that currently approved generic drug submissions are very homogeneous (14), mainly for existing generic drugs, and we\u00a0doubt the newcomers will be\u00a0able to reduce drug prices as much as the former (15). Therefore, further research is required on the relationship between the number of competitors and prices in China.\nConsiderable literature exists with differing estimated effects on the relationship between the number of competitors and prices in generic drug markets. Frank and Salkever (1995) (16) examined the effect of the number of generic sellers (N) on prices using IMS data from 1980 to 1991 for a sample of 32 drugs that lost patent protection during 1984\u201387. The results indicate that each entrant would reduce the price of generic products by 5.6\u20137.2%. Berndt, Conti, and Murphy (2017) (17) use IMS national sales perspective data from the fourth quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2016 and find that the elasticity of price with respect to the number of manufacturers ranges from \u22120.710 to 0.777, assuming an estimated elasticity of 0.75, an increase from two to three manufacturers implies a 30% price decrease, while when molecular fixed effects are included, the study shows that an increase from two to three manufacturers implies a price decrease of approximately 15%. Nguyen (2021) (18)used Medicare Part D drug events (PDEs) from 2007 to 2018, using drug-level fixed and random effects to estimate the relationship between competitors and prices within each drug, the study found that drug prices decreased as the number of competitors increased, with prices decreasing by 20% in markets with three competitors; in markets with 10 or more competitors, prices continued to decrease by 80% relative to pre-generic entry prices. Kesselheim (2017) (19) examined the relationship between the number of generic manufacturers and the relative prices of generic versus brand-name drugs using 2008 MarketScan commercial claims data, showing that the relative price of drugs with one generic competitor declined to 87% and then to 77%, and further to 60% with three manufacturers; the study also found that generic entry had the most significant impact on the top three manufacturers, with marginal relative prices decreasing as the number of manufacturers increased. Reiffen and Ward (2005) (20), using IMS data on 31 drugs that were off-patent in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with competition represented by a dummy variable for generic sellers, found a negative relationship between price and the number of firms, and that as the number of firms increased, an additional firm\u2019s marginal effect tends to decrease. In the study on the Chinese market, Dave, Hartzema and Mingyue Zhao and Jing Wu (2016) (21) used data from the Urban Employees\u2019 Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) database in Tianjin, and Jing Wu et\u00a0al. (2014) (22) used data from 2002\u20132005 from 11 public tertiary hospitals in three Chinese cities, studied the role of regulation and competition in the drug market, and they both found that generic competition still lowers prices under government regulatory policies in China.\nThe general conclusion of these studies is that generic competition is closely related to drug prices, but there are some differences in the level of specific correlation, and the differences in these outcomes may\nbe\u00a0 attributed to the different drug samples studied, the various periods, the different national situations, and the selection of statistical models. Few such studies exist on the relationship between generic competition and drug prices in the Chinese market, and the existing literature relates primarily to the relationship between price and competition under the government\u2019s price regulation policy in China, which may not reflect the actual situation of the Chinese market at this point. This study will fill the current lack of research and enrich the pricing research system in China, which may have a greater reference value in formulating drug policy in China, especially drug pricing policy. The findings of this study are relevant for other countries since concerns about the effectiveness of generic substitution and harmonization of generic drug applications are not unique to China. These two problems exist in most countries around the world, especially in developing countries with similar conditions to China (15, 23).\nIn this study, we\u00a0investigate the relationship between competitors and prices within each drug using data for 101 drugs that lost their patents in the 2021 China\u2019s NRDL, using a linear regression model with drug-level fixed effects. We\u00a0examine the relationship between competition and generic prices using two measures of competitive effectiveness: (1) the number of generic drug manufacturers as a continuous variable, and (2) a dummy variable representing the number of generic competitors. We\u00a0want to address two key issues identified above. First, does the average market price of a drug vary based on number of generics on the Chinese market? Second, does the average market price of a drug continue to decrease with each new market entrant after the original drug has lost its patent exclusivity, or does it stabilize after the early participants?"

            "text": "This study refers to the original drug for the period of patent protection for invention granted by the Intellectual Property Office of the People\u2019s Republic of China or the drug labeled as originally developed in the National Development and Reform Commission documents. Generic drugs are drugs containing the same active ingredients as the product being copied, and with the same indications, dosage forms, specifications, routes of administration, bioequivalence and quality in line with the same requirements as the product being copied.\nSince China\u2019s NRDL is unified and adjusted by the National Healthcare Security Administration, drugs that meet the basic conditions of clinical necessity, safety and effectiveness are included in the NRDL for management, and the included drugs is in a high number, covering a wide range of therapeutic areas, and they are all common clinical supplies. It is a good representation of the actual situation of China\u2019s drug market. To investigate the relationship between the number of drug manufacturers and prices in the mainland China market, we\u00a0screened drugs from the 2,860 drugs (1,486 western drugs and 1,374 proprietary Chinese drugs) in the 2021 China\u2019s NRDL. Our exclusion criteria were as follows.\n(1) Exclude competition in drugs before 2015, i.e., exclude generic drugs that first entered the market before 2015, because\nFrontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin.org\ngovernment pricing of drugs was abolished in mainland China only after 2015 (3). (2) Exclude biological drugs. Because of the complex macromolecular structures and manufacturing processes of biologics, biosimilars cannot be\u00a0exact replicas of the originator drugs as chemical generics, and usually require animal testing and clinical studies to confirm similar efficacy before they can be\u00a0marketed. Moreover, due to high research and development costs, stringent manufacturing conditions, high marginal manufacturing costs, and blurred patent boundaries, biosimilars have higher competitive barriers, so the market pricing logic of biosimilars is usually different from that of chemical generics (24), and the price elasticity of biosimilars is smaller compared to chemical generics. (3) Exclude drugs less than four quarters after the first generic entered the market to observe the relationship between the number of drug manufacturers and prices over time.\nAll drugs included in the study after passing the exclusion. The drugs in our study were defined by a combination of active ingredient, route of administration and dosage form. We\u00a0ended up with a total of 101 drugs screened, the specific screening process is shown in Figure\u00a01. The unit of analysis was a drug-quarter (active ingredientdosage form-quarter), an approach that significantly reduces the number of observations compared to implicitly treating each month as an independent observation, which tends to reduce the statistical significance of our results, but the final results show that we\u00a0were still able to find significant competitive effects.\nThe baseline price for each drug is the average price for the four quarters before a generic entered the market for that drug to ensure exogeneity of the baseline price. This baseline price is the baseline\nagainst which we\u00a0 compare the trajectory of price changes across quarters since the first generic entered. As China fully implements generic drug consistency evaluation after 2016 (5), at the drug level, we\u00a0consider the quality and efficacy of both originator and generic drugs to be\u00a0consistent, and therefore we\u00a0use the average market price that includes both originator and generic drugs as the independent variable in our study, rather than either one alone.\nIn China\u2019s drug market, there are many different types of prices, such as factory prices of enterprises, hospital purchase prices, national volume-based procurement prices, medical insurance negotiation prices, retail prices of retail pharmacies, etc. However, for now, many of these prices are already equivalent. In 2017, China required all public hospitals to abolish drug markups and not to sell drugs at a markup on top of factory prices (25), and in most cases, hospital procurement prices are equivalent to corporate ex-factory prices/collection price/negotiated price, so we\u00a0believe that using public hospital procurement prices is more reflective of the real competition in the drug market than retail pharmacies.\nThe drug price datum are the average quarterly prices of all manufacturers\u2019 tenders in each Chinese province from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2022 under each generic drug obtained from the Pharnexcloud website. Pharnexcloud is a one-stop search platform for China\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical industry, in which the bidding database integrates and includes the drug procurement prices of most public hospitals in 31 provinces and municipalities in China. All of its datum come from the official government websites of each province, and the website is only responsible for integration and inclusion. For cross-year comparisons, all prices use an inflation rate of 2.1% (26) (expressed as the average of the Consumer Price Index for the last 3 years published by the\nFIGURE\u00a01 Screened flow chart.\nFrontiers in Public Health 04 frontiersin.org\nNational Bureau of Statistics of China) discounted and adjusted to the prices in the 2nd quarter of 2022.\nWe prefer to use the number of producers to indicate generic competition as opposed to the drug\u2019s labeler, because even the original drug producer may commission other firms to bid, which usually does not generate price competition. This means that using the labeler causes competition to emerge earlier and has a smaller estimated effect. We\u00a0consider a drug manufacturer as entering if it has positive sales in the first month after at least one quarter of zero sales, and the dependent variable of the study is the number of generic drug manufacturers entering the Chinese market for that drug from 2015\u20132022."

            "text": "The main dependent variable in this study is the ratio of the average market price after market entry with a generic drug relative to the baseline price of the originator before generic entry. The main independent variable is the number of manufacturers of the generic drug entering the Chinese market.\nWe use both the number of producing manufacturers as a continuous variable and a series of dummy variables to account for competition. This is because when the number of producing manufacturers is used as a continuous variable as an explanatory variable, the implicit assumption is that the effect of each increase in the number of manufacturers is the same regardless of the initial number of manufacturers (20). Therefore, we\u00a0introduce a series of dummy variables to represent the number of manufacturers in the China market to examine how the marginal effect of an additional number of drug manufacturers on the average market price varies with the number of generic firms.\nWe used fixed effects and random effects applied at the drug level to control for different drug factors. Using the Hausman test, we\u00a0finally chose fixed effects to control for the potential endogeneity of the relationship between the number of competitors and price (27).\nIn addition, since there are some literatures indicating that competition is intense for a period of time after the expiration of a drug patent and later diminishes over time (19, 20), we\u00a0follow each drug for at least 4 quarters after the first generic entry to see if there is an impact on drug prices over time in the Chinese drug market and if the relationship between the number of generic manufacturers and prices changes over time as in other countries.\nAlso, since other factors besides the number of generic manufacturers may affect the price, we\u00a0also tried to introduce some control variables to our model.\n(1) Market size (16, 18, 19) expressed as the number of units sold for the generic drug (both originator and generic) in 2022, in million units. We\u00a0believe that if the market size is small, it may enter saturation competition soon, and a larger market size may be\u00a0in a competitive market for a long time; however, at the same time, a larger market will attract more suppliers to enter, while a smaller market may not be\u00a0as attractive. (2) National negotiation of drugs (28), a policy variable, is represented as a dummy variable. Since 2016, China has adopted a drug national negotiation policy in order to reduce\ndrug prices, and the drugs are covered by China\u2019s NRDL after successful negotiations, which usually result in significant reductions in drug prices. (3) Volume-based procurement of drugs (29), a policy variable, expressed as a dummy variable. With the government as the largest buyer, consolidating the number of drugs used in public hospitals in order to obtain drug discounts and reduce drug prices, the policy of centralized quantity purchasing of drugs usually results in a significant reduction in the average market price of drugs. Due to the great number and complexity of provincial alliances for volume-based procurement at the local level, this study refers only to national-level volume-based procurement of drugs.\nWe believe that both drug national negotiation and volume-based procurement are only transient policy effects, although they can significantly reduce prices in the current period, they do not exert sustained downward policy pressure on drug prices (basically do not affect the trend of price changes) (30, 31). After the point in time of drug national negotiation and volume-based procurement, competition is still the main factor that makes prices lower. Controlling for national negotiations and volume-based procurement will allow identification of the ceteris paribus effects of the number of generic manufacturers."

Our study drugs include 12 negotiation drugs, 32 centralized procured drugs, and 7 that have both participated in national negotiations and in national volume-based procurement.\nWe expect the number of generic vendors to be\u00a0highly correlated with the size of the market in which they compete, i.e., larger markets will attract more vendors (32), we\u00a0 divide the market into small, medium, and large categories, according to the average of the number of generic drugs sold at the time of their first market entry and the last observation due to the long time span, the high variability in market size, and the excessive price differences between drugs.\nTable\u00a0 1 shows the maximum number of competitors for the studied drugs by market size, using the number of largest competitors in the market at the last quarter of the study (2022q2) as a statistical criterion.

This study applies regressions with drug-level fixed effects using two different methods to construct the model to focus on the effect of the number of competing manufacturers on the price for each drug, while controlling for other factors affecting the model using variables such as time variables, market size, national negotiations, and drug banding.\nFirst of all, We\u00a0 finally found that in the Chinese market, the number of generic manufacturers is always significantly negatively correlated with drug prices, that is, as the number of generic drug manufacturers increases, the average drug market price continues to decrease, which is similar to the situation in other countries in the\nTABLE\u00a05 Effect of the number of generic drug manufacturers on drug prices (based on Method 2).\nCoefficient value\np-value\nNumber of generic\ndrug manufacturers\n(Nj)\n1 \u22120.118922 0.000\n2 \u22120.1654992 0.000\n3 \u22120.1879174 0.000\n4 \u22120.2388876 0.000\n5 \u22120.2360711 0.000\n6 \u22120.2154436 0.000\n7 \u22120.2885595 0.000\n8 \u22120.2806422 0.000\n9 \u22120.2834121 0.000\n10 (and above) \u22120.2939239 0.000\nTime \u22120.0087823 0.000\nNational Negotiation (Neift) \u22120.1445838 0.000\nVolume-based Procurement (VBPift) \u22120.1828591 0.000\nSize \u22120.0000911 0.001\nConstant 2.998563 0.000\nUsing the relative price ratio in the drug market as the dependent variable and dummy variables such as the number of generic manufacturers as independent variables, all study drugs were regressed using stata 16.0 at the drug molecular level fixed effects, with N = 0, i.e., when no generics were available and only one supplier of the original brand product was used as the control group.

And the results of both approaches suggest that the erosion of price cost margins caused over time has led to a reduction in prices. In addition, for different therapeutic areas, the impact of generic manufacturers\u2019 entry on the average market price may be\u00a0different, and for special therapeutic areas such as cancer, the price decrease may be\u00a0greater than the average market situation, which may be\u00a0due to the high demand and low price elasticity of cancer patients, so the original cancer drugs are priced high to earn excess profits, and the first few generics enter before the price returns to the drug itself real value. This reinforces the significance of generic substitution.\nSecond, we\u00a0also find that there are some differences in the Chinese drug market from other countries. According to our findings, the effect of the number of generic manufacturers in the Chinese market on drug prices is not perfectly linear, but shows a sharp decline\nfollowed by a gradual leveling off, and is smaller than the range estimated by most of the literature (see Table\u00a06 for results from other literature). We\u00a0suspect that the lower patent prices in China compared to the U.S (33) may leave little room for further price reductions for originator drugs after patent expiration, and that even with generic manufacturers, originator drugs do not necessarily lower prices, resulting in smaller average market price declines than in other countries. However, we\u00a0 find that drug price reductions through supply-side market competition are limited, but the coefficients on the two policy variables suggest that price reduction pressure from the buyer\u2019s perspective through health insurance can have a very significant effect, and if health care purchasers were to promote intense competition for price discounts, we\u00a0would expect a greater decline in average market prices than the existing extent.\nAnd, unlike some studies that suggest that marginal prices continue to decline as the number of competitors increases, our study supports the view of another part of the literature that marginal price declines after about four to six entrants. We\u00a0find that in markets with about four competitors, relative prices decline by 23.89% (the expected price ratio of the average market price to the average pre-generic entry brand price is 76.11%). In contrast, in markets with 10 competitors, the price decreases by a maximum of 29.39% relative to the pre-generic entry price. This suggests that the entry of the first few generic manufacturers can significantly reduce drug prices, but later generics do not provide the expected price reductions.\nLast but not least, we\u00a0also found that the impact of the number of generic manufacturers on prices in the Chinese drug market is subject to a \u201crebound\u201d phenomenon, i.e., as the number of generic manufacturers increases, prices fall sharply and then rebound slightly. After analyzing the raw data, we\u00a0found that this is due to the fact that some generic drug manufacturers\u2019 pricing is much higher than that of the original drug, which increases the average market price. By examining the relevant literature, we\u00a0found that there was also a small rebound in some international literature (19), However, none of them analyzed the reasons for it.

First, the rebound phenomenon may be\u00a0due to the special pattern of the Chinese drug market. In the Chinese market, public medical institutions are the main sales channel for drugs. However, there is a limit to the number of drug specifications in public hospitals, which means some hospitals that are already fully equipped with drugs need to transfer the corresponding number of drugs if they want to add new drugs. And usually, all drugs in public hospitals must go through a complex review process by the hospital\u2019s pharmacy management committee, and the frequency of most tertiary hospitals\u2019 pharmacy committees is once a year or once every 6 months. When several generic drugs enter the market, they may have basically met the market demand of public hospitals, and the market is almost completely taken up, especially for the national negotiation drugs and centralized quantity procurement drugs. As the selected varieties acquired most of the public (and private) markets, the unselected varieties and subsequent generic entrants divide the remaining small market. Competition is more intense at this time, and later generic manufacturers may not get the expected feedback by simply lowering their list prices. If later generic entrants have to offer rebates (aggregate discounts) in order to gain larger business volumes from hospitals (or to even enter the hospital market), they may increase their list prices to the point that generic prices could be\u00a0two to three times that of originator products. Alternatively, subsequent generic manufacturers may be\u00a0tempted to promote their products as a differentiated alternative to justify a higher price. However, if health care payers do not consider this differentiation worthwhile, then the price premium is no longer justified. Later entrants will have no choice but to lower their prices to match those of their competitors or lose sales. Subsequently, even if generic manufacturers do not change their pricing strategy, as new generic products entered the market at low prices, they brought the average market price back to normal levels, thus leading to a \u201crebound\u201d phenomenon in our results. A related study found that in drug markets with fuller generic competition, competition among companies forced illegal rebates to occur and dominate, resulting in smaller absolute price elasticities for generics, which supports our speculation (34).\nThe second possibility is that the entry of the first few generic drug manufacturers has significantly reduced drug prices, especially under the national drug price negotiation and the volume-based drug procurement policies, the market structure has changed, and health insurance as the largest buyer is committed to suppressing drug prices, and the continuous downward pressure on prices usually drives manufacturers to suppress costs, but the generic drug consistency evaluation policy sets a minimum limit for generic drug quality, in order to keep reaching normal drug quality, making it impossible for companies to ensure profitability and produce in an unstable or unsustainable economic situation, which could lead to supply disruptions and shortages of drugs that could be\u00a0followed by a retaliatory price rebound. Afterwards, prices returned to the normal range as new generic manufacturers came to market to relieve supply pressure. Frank (2021)\u2018s study (35) shows some upward trends in generic prices in the U.S. markets that corresponded to periods when the shortages and recalls were at their highest levels. However, we\u00a0did not find a similar empirical study in China market, which may be\u00a0 a direction for further research to follow.\nOur findings also have some policy implications. First, we\u00a0support the policy of generic drug consistency evaluation and generic substitution, and promote effective market competition plays a similar role as expected in lowering drug prices, reducing pharmaceutical cost expenditures, and saving health insurance funds, and governments can vigorously promote generic substitution while ensuring drug quality. And the price reduction pressure exerted by health insurance as a buyer can bring significant results, and governments must actively promote competition for price discounts while ensuring the quality of drugs. Second, we\u00a0 found that the first few entering generics can significantly reduce drug prices, while later generic entrants do not significantly reduce market price. Governments should pay attention to the review and approval of the first few generics, especially for drugs without competitive manufacturers or with insufficient competition. Furthermore, governments must pay attention to supplyside policies, monitor drug costs, and further regulate and control generic drug pricing, both to prevent late-entry generics from reserving rebate space to set high prices and to prevent drug shortages due to continued downward pressure on prices, and to maintain effective and adequate as well as transparent and fair market competition.\nThere are still some limitations of our study and further research is needed in the follow-up. First, although we\u00a0screened among 3,260 drugs in the drug list, we\u00a0ended up with only 101 representative drugs, which is only a small fraction of China\u2019s large drug market. Subsequent inclusion of data on more drugs and tracking the entry and exit of their generic manufacturers, as well as inclusion of interaction variables between different dosage forms under the same generic name and different active molecules in the same therapeutic area to control for the impact of other types of competition will help us further understand the impact of competition on drugs. Second, although our study chose to use the mean method to measure the average drug market price due to the lack of clarity regarding the market share of each manufacturer under the same generic name in China, this may be\u00a0very crude, as opposed to using a price index or a price weighted by volume, which may be\u00a0more appropriate and should be\u00a0used in subsequent studies if possible. Finally, the lack of data on rebates for drugs leads to our inability to measure the true price of drugs, which implies that the actual effect of generic competition may be\u00a0larger than the results estimated in this study, especially for generic drugs that enter the market later, the difference in pricing strategies determines that their prices are likely to be\u00a0high, leading to our underestimation of the effect of competition. However, the potential underestimation of these effects is mitigated by the fact that rebates may also be\u00a0paid for originator drug pricing, and our findings still have some credibility and reference value."
