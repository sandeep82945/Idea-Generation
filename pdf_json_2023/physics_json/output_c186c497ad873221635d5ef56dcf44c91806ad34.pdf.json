    "abstractText": "Six undescribed capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes sarcocrassolins A\u2013F (1\u20136) and one related known analog pavidolide D (7) were isolated from Sarcophyton crassocaule, a soft coral collected off the Nansha Islands, in the South China Sea. Their complete structures, relative configurations and absolute configurations were established through comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, quantum mechanical nuclear magnetic resonance (QM-NMR) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Sarcocrassolins D (4) and E (5) showed inhibitory activity against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 cells with IC50 values of 76.8 \u00b1 8.0 \u03bcM and 93.0 \u00b1 3.8 \u03bcM, respectively.",

The first cembranoid, named cembrene, was isolated from the oleoresin of the white bark pine in 1962 [2]. Afterward, plenty of cembranoids have been isolated from plants, insects or marine organisms. The capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes, which have a 5/11-fused bicyclic carbon skeleton, are thought to be biogenetically produced from cembranoids via transannular cyclization between the C-3 and C-7 positions or ring rearrangement [3\u20135]. Capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes are rarely encountered. Hitherto, only 48 capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes have been reported from 14 species of soft corals (including Sarcophyton boettgeri [3], Sarcophyton trocheliophorum [6\u20139], Klyxum flaccidum [10], Sinularia rigida [11], Sinularia polydactyla [12], Sarcophyton mililatensis [13], Sinularia pavida [14], Sarcophyton elegans [15], Lobophytum sp. [16], Sarcophyton solidun [17], Cespitularia sp. [18], Alcyonium coralloides [19], Lobophytum pauciflorum [20], and Sinularia humilis [21]). Moreover, these capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes have been proved to possess a wide variety of biological activities, including anticancer [10,15], anti-inflammatory [3,20] and inhibition of tyrosine protein phosphatase 1B [8,12].\nMar.

The HRESIMS data at m/z 391.2820 (calculated as 391.2819 for C22H40O4Na, [M + Na]+) revealed the molecular formula of 1 to be C22H40O4 with three indexes of hydrogen deficit, which was validated by the 13C NMR and DEPT data. The presence of hydroxy and olefinic groups was suggested by the IR absorption bands at 3418 and 1638 cm\u22121, respectively. Five methyl groups (\u03b4H 0.99, 1.07, 1.08, 1.10, 1.26), two methoxy groups (\u03b4H 3.19, 3.22), one oxymethine (\u03b4H 3.59) and one olefinic proton (\u03b4H 5.02) were detected in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectrum revealed twenty-two carbon signals, including four quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 146.7, 83.2, 79.4, 79.3), five methines (\u03b4C 121.0, 78.7, 52.0, 50.0, 32.8), six methylenes (\u03b4C 37.5, 23.1, 35.7, 25.1, 33.2, 21.3), five methyls (\u03b4C 21.6, 23.1, 26.5, 19.2, 19.1) and two methoxy groups (\u03b4C 48.1, 49.5) (Table 2). A double bond in 1 accounted for one degree of unsaturation and indicated that the structure had two rings as a result of the remaining two indexes of hydrogen deficit.

The ROESY experiment did not allow for deter ining the relative configuration of C-8, C-11 and C-12 due to the presence of a highly flexible macrocycle.

QM-NMR calculations on eight potential isomers 1a\u20131h (Figure 4) were then performed.

The ROESY spectrum verified the E configurations of the double-bonds \u22061 and \u220611, with the essential cross peaks of H-2 (\u03b4H 5.00)/H3-16 (\u03b4H 1.08) and the lack of H-11 (\u03b4H 5.38)/H3-20 (\u03b4H 1.69).

The relative configuration of C-8 and C-13 could not be established from the ROESY experiment either. However, an appropriate single crystal of compound 2 was obtained in a solution of MeOH/H2O (20:1). Ultimately, as shown in Figure 5, the absolute configuration of 2 was obtained by analyzing the X-ray crystallographic data (Flack parameter: \u22120.3(4)) and was unambiguously established as 3S, 4S, 7R, 8R, 13S.\nMar.

The significant HMBC cross peaks from H3-20 (\u03b4H 1.69) to C-11 (\u03b4C 127.9)/C-12 (\u03b4C 134.3)/C-13 (\u03b4C 76.2), and from H-2 (\u03b4H 5.00) to C-14 (\u03b4C 38.3) as well as the 1H-1H COSY cross peaks of H-13 (\u03b4H 3.97)/H-14a (\u03b4H 1.97) and H-13 (\u03b4H 3.97)/H-14b (\u03b4H 2.80), f rt er supported this conclusion. The ROESY spectrum verified the E configurati of the double-bonds \u03941 and \u039411, with the essential cross peaks of H-2 (\u03b4H 5.00)/H3-16 (\u03b4H 1.08) and the lack of H-11 (\u03b4H 5.38)/H3-20 (\u03b4H 1.69). In addition, the key ROESY cross peaks of H-2 (\u03b4H 5.00)/H3-18 (\u03b4H 1.06) and H-2 (\u03b4H 5.00)/H-7 (\u03b4H 2.15), along with the lack of cross peak of H-2 (\u03b4H 5.00)/H-3 (\u03b4H 2.34) indicated that H-7 and H3-18 were co-facial, while H-3 was on the opposite side of the molecule (Figure 3). The relative configu ation of C-8 and C-13 could not be established from the ROESY xperiment ither. However, an appropriate single crystal of compound 2 was obtained in a solution of MeOH/H2O (20:1). Ultimately, as shown in Figure 5, the absolute configuration of 2 was obtained by analyzing the X-ray crystallographic data (Flack parameter: \u22120.3(4)) and was unambiguously established as 3S, 4S, 7R, 8R, 13S.\nFigure 5. Single-crystal X-ray structure of 2 (the ellipsoids are shown at a 30% probability level).\nSarcocrassolin C (3) was isolated as a colorless oil and assigned the molecular formula C22H40O4, identical to that of 1, according to the HRESIMS ion peak at m/z 391.2819 (calculated as 391.2819 for C22H40O4Na, [M + Na]+), with three degrees of unsaturation. The characteristic infrared absorption bands at 3431 and 1632 cm\u22121 indicated the presence of hydroxy and olefinic groups, respectively. By comparing the 1H NMR and 13C NMR data of compounds 3 and 1, we found that compound 3 was highly similar to 1. Following that, the analysis of NMR data of compound 3 implied that compounds 3 and 1 shared the same planar structure. The main difference was that H-7 upfield-shifted significantly from \u03b4H 2.88 in 1 to \u03b4H 1.97 in 3. Meanwhile, the higher value of JH-3/H-7 (11.5 Hz) in 3 compared to JH-3/H-7 (5.3 Hz) in 1 indicated that 3 and 1 exhibited different configurations at C-7. The ROESY cross peak between H-7 (\u03b4H 1.97) and H3-18 (\u03b4H 1.06) together with the lack of ROESY correlation between H-3 (\u03b4H 2.36) and H-7 (\u03b4H 1.97) also validated this hypothesis. The double-bond \u22061 in 3 possessed E-geometry, according to the ROESY cross peaks between H-2 (\u03b4H 5.16) and H3-16 (\u03b4H 1.10). The correlations of H-2 (\u03b4H 5.16)/H3-18 (\u03b4H 1.06) and H-2 (\u03b4H 5.16)/H-7 (\u03b4H 1.97) showed in ROESY spectrum, whereas no cross peaks of H-3 (\u03b4H 2.36)/H3-18 (\u03b4H 1.06) and H-2 (\u03b4H 5.16)/H-3 (\u03b4H 2.36) were observed (Figure 3).\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 645 7 of 13\nThis indicated that H3-18 and H-7 were co-facial, whereas H-3 was on the opposite side of the molecule. The identical key ROESY correlations between compounds 3 and 2 indicated that the relative configuration of C-3, C-4 and C-7 in compounds 3 and 2 could be the same and established as 3S*, 4S*, 7R*, which was unambiguously defined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction in compound 2. The ROESY experiment also failed to identify the relative configuration of C-8, C-11 and C-12. Therefore, eight potential isomers 3a\u20133h (Figure S57) were calculated. The correlation coefficient R2= 0.9981 (DP4+ probability, 100%) indicated that the experimental NMR results of 3 were more consistent with 3c (3S*, 4S*, 7R*, 8R*, 11S*, 12R*) than other isomers. Consequently, the relative configuration of 3 ended up being established as illustrated in Figure 1. Sarcocrassolin D (4) was obtained as a colorless oil. Its molecular formula was established as C21H38O4 by HRESIMS data at m/z 731.5432 (calculated as 731.5432 for C42H76O8Na, [2M + Na]+). The analysis of the NMR data of 4 showed that 4 mostly resembled 3. The major difference between 4 and 3 was at the C-8 position, where the methoxy group in 3 was substituted by a hydroxy group in 4. This alteration was further validated by their 14-mass unit difference. The double-bond \u22061 in 4 was proposed to have E-geometry, in accordance with the ROESY cross peak between H-2 (\u03b4H 5.21) and H3-16 (\u03b4H 1.11). Furthermore, the relative configuration of C-3, C-4 and C-7 could be tentatively established as 3S*, 4S* and 7R*, respectively, based on the similar crucial ROESY correlation between 3 and 4 (Figure 3). Finally, eight potential isomers 4a\u20134h (Figure S58) were calculated to explicate the spatial arrangement of C-11, C-12 and C-8. The correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9835 (DP4+ probability, 100%) suggested that 4e (3S*, 4S*, 7R*, 8S*, 11R*, 12R*) was more compatible with the experimental NMR results. Consequently, the relative configuration of 4 was defined as shown in Figure 1. The HRESIMS ion peak at m/z 345.2398 (calculated as 345.2400 for C20H34O3Na, [M + Na]+) revealed the molecular formula of sarcocrassolin E (5) to be C20H34O3 with four indexes of hydrogen deficit. The existence of hydroxy and olefinic groups could be determined by the characteristic infrared absorption bands at 3393 and 1650 cm\u22121, respectively. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed twenty carbon signals, which were classified by DEPT and HSQC spectra and then attributed to four quaternary carbons, five methines, six methylenes and five methyls. One double bond and one epoxy ring were composed of two methines, C-2 (\u03b4C 120.4, \u03b4H 5.31) and C-11 (\u03b4C 61.7, \u03b4H 3.16), as well as two quaternary carbons, C-1 (\u03b4C 146.5) and C-12 (\u03b4C 60.1), which contributed to the two indexes of hydrogen deficit. The remaining two indexes of hydrogen deficit thus revealed that the molecule contained two rings. Following that, the entire planar structure of 5 could be constructed using the 2D NMR data as depicted in Figure 2. When the NMR data were further analyzed, it became clear that compound 5 and sarcophytrol B [7], a capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpene that had previously been identified, were highly similar. The major difference was the configuration of double-bond \u22061. In fact, that had an E configuration in 5 and Z configuration in sarcophytrol B, which was established by the ROESY cross peaks between H-2 and H3-16 in compound 5. It was also possible to establish the relative configurations of C-3, C-4 and C-7 as 3S*, 4S* and 7R*, respectively, by the similar key ROESY cross peaks observed in compounds 4 and 5. Consequently, four possible isomers 5a\u20135d (Figure S59) were calculated. Based on the experimental results, the NMR data of compound 5 provided the highest degree of matching for 5d (3S*, 4S*, 7R*, 8S*, 11S*, 12R*), with 100% probabilities. Consequently, the relative configuration of 5 was defined as 3S*, 4S*, 7R*, 8S*, 11S* and 12R* (Figure 1). Sarcocrassolin F (6), isolated as a colorless oil, had a molecular formula C21H36O3 based on the HRESIMS data at m/z 359.2557 (calculated as 359.2557 for C21H36O3Na, [M + Na]+). The analysis of its 1H and 13C NMR spectral characteristics data showed that 6 displayed extensive resemblance to 1, except for the existence of an exocyclic double bond at C-8, C-19 in 6 instead of a methoxy and a methyl at C-8 in 1, which was validated by key HMBC cross peaks from H-19 to C-7/C-8/C-9. According to the noticeable ROESY cross peak of H-2/H3-16, the double-bond \u22061 in 6 was proven to be of the E-geometry. The\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 645 8 of 13\nROESY cross peak between H-2 and H3-18, along with the lack of cross peaks of H-2/H-3 and H-3/H3-18, indicated that H-3 and H3-18 were oriented on the opposite side of the molecule. Due to the insufficient signals, ROESY correlations were unable to ascertain the relative configuration of C-7. However, the nearly identical coupling constant of JH-3/H-7 (5.9 Hz) in 6 and JH-3/H-7 (5.3 Hz) in 1 revealed that H-3 and H-7 had the same orientation in both molecules. Finally, the QM-NMR using DP4+ probability analysis was carried out for the four potential isomers 6a\u20136d (Figure S60) to explicate the spatial arrangement of C-11 and C-12. The experimental data indicated that 6d (3S*, 4S*, 7S*, 11S*, 12R*) was more consistent with the correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9975 (DP4 + probability, 100%). Consequently, the relative configuration of 6 was depicted as drawn in Figure 1. Compound 7 was identified as pavidolide D on the basis of the MS and NMR data analyses and comparison with the NMR data from a previously reported article [14]. Because all compounds 1\u20137 possessed the same 5/11-fused bicyclic carbon skeleton and were obtained from the same animal material, it was reasonable to assume that they originated from the same biosynthetic pathway. According to their structural characteristics, a potential biosynthetic pathway of compounds 1\u20137 has been postulated (Scheme 1). The precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via 14,1 cyclization and dehydrogenation generates intermediate cembrene A. Subsequently, the 5/11-fused bicyclic carbon skeleton was generated by epoxidation and transannular cyclization from cembrene A. Finally, all compounds 1\u20137 were obtained after undergoing a series of reactions (such as methylation, epoxidation and dehydrogenation). Mar.

The transfected cells were then stimulated using LPS (50 \u00b5L, 500 ng/mL) for 24 h after being treated with 50 \u00b5L solution of the tested compound at different concentrations (100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 12.5 \u00b5M) for 1 h. Then, 100 \u00b5L of supernatants were taken from each well, and 100 \u00b5L of Griess reagent (40 mg/mL) was added into a new 96-well plate. Finally, using a microplate reader, the absorbance of each well was measured at the wavelength of 540 nm. The IC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism 9.0. The positive control employed was quercetin. The cytotoxicity of compounds against RAW264.7 cells was determined by the MTT method."

            "text": "In conclusion, six uncommon capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes, sarcocrassolins A\u2013F (1\u20136), and one related known analog pavidolide D (7) were isolated from the soft coral S. crassocaule collected off the Nansha Islands. Due to the presence of a highly flexible macrocycle, the configuration assignments of capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes are still confronted with huge challenges. In our continuing efforts, the absolute configuration of compound 2 was assigned based on an X-ray crystallography study, and the relative configurations of the remaining compounds were established through QM-NMR using DP4+ probability analysis. Despite the fact that the soft coral S. crassocaule has been acknowledged as a major source of cembrane-type diterpenes, the capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes have not been previously reported. This is the first time that capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes were described in the soft coral S. crassocaule. Consequently, the soft coral S. crassocaule could be a potential source of structurally diverse capnosane-type macrocyclic diterpenes. In anti-inflammatory testing, all isolated compounds were assayed for the inhibitory activity on NO release in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Sarcocrassolin D (4) and sarcocrassolin E (5) exhibited weak inhibitory effects. Furthermore, all compounds were tested for cytotoxicity. Unfortunately, none of the compounds demonstrated notable activity.\nMar.
