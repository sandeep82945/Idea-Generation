    "abstractText": "One-dimensional photonic crystal structures have been widely used to enhance fluorescence. However, its fluorescence enhancement is low-fold because of a weak excitation field region. In this paper, we used a genetic algorithm to assist in the design of two photonic crystals based on Al2O3 and TiO2 materials. One of them has a defect consisting of SiO2. The Fabry-Perot cavity (FP cavity) formed by the sandwiched photonic crystal achieves up to 14-fold enhancement of the excitation electric field. We modulate the electric field radiation distribution of the fluorescent material by using photonic forbidden bands. For a 3.18 \u03bcm thick layer of the fluorescent solution, the structure achieves up to 60-fold fluorescence enhancement. We also discussed that the reason for the different enhancement abilities in different places is the phase change caused by the optical path difference. This design is expected to have applications in display, imaging, etc.",

            "text": "Fluorescence-enhanced structures are widely designed for environmental monitoring, biochemical, medical, and display applications [1\u20136]. Many studies have been conducted to investigate structures for localized fluorescence enhancement, and these studies often use surface plasmas [7,8], resonant cavities [9\u201312], and photonic crystals [13,14] to achieve fluorescence enhancement. For example, Boxiang Song et al. [15] designed a structure with a gold sphere as the tip with the excitation electric field localized between the gold spheres; Jungeun Song et al. [16] designed a triangular hole and circular hole array structure with the excitation electric field concentrated in the holes; Nikhil Ganesh et al. [17] designed a perforated photonic crystal with the electric field similarly concentrated in the holes. Songtao Hu et al. [18] coated quantum dots among the gaps of opal structures, which is also the region with the strongest excitation field. However, local area fluorescence enhancement tends to focus on certain hot spots. For large-area fluorescence enhancement, some hot spots will lead to overexcitation of fluorescent material in some regions and low utilization of fluorescent material in other non-hot areas, leading to low overall fluorescence utilization and decreased device lifetime. Some studies have explored considerable area fluorescence enhancement, e.g., Markus Nyman et al. [19] used surface plasmon as an enhanced excitation field. Weina Zhang et al. [20] also used surface plasmon in combination with microlenses to achieve 260-fold enhancement, but the electric field strength of surface plasmon decays substantially with propagation distance. This means that the layer of fluorescent material cannot be increased in thickness. Hongyun Xuan et al. [21] assembled a one-dimensional photonic crystal with ZnO spheres and coated the quantum dots on the sphere surface, and such a structure\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7803. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15217803 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7803 2 of 10\nobtained a specific excitation electric field enhancement on the sphere surface. Patrick et al. [22] designed a two-dimensional photonic crystal structure to achieve full-plane enhancement, but its enhancement multiplicity varied considerably at different horizontal positions. Ehsan Eftekhar et al. [23] used an opal structure to construct a resonant cavity to achieve fluorescence enhancement of Rhodamine B, but the enhancement multiplicity was not high. Besides, one-dimensional photonic crystals enable large-area fluorescence enhancement. The work of combining photonic crystal and fluorescence enhancement always regards the photonics crystal as a non-loss structure of reflector [24\u201327]. Without adding other structures, the one-dimensional photonic crystals own a low fold. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement structure with a large area and high magnification need to be designed. Some works add the fluorescence material as a part of the photonic crystal. But these layers\u2019 depths are usually lower than one-quarter of the wavelength [28\u201330]. In summary, there are no structures to achieve efficient enhancement in a large area and a high-thickness layer of fluorescent material. Therefore, we propose to realize fluorescence enhancement using one-dimensional photonic crystals. Since one-dimensional photonic crystals will make the excitation electric field intensity will be precisely the same in one plane, ensuring the same fluorescence excitation enhancement multiplier in the same plane. In addition, we design two photonic crystals with high reflectivity to excitation light and high transmittance to emission light versus high transmittance to excitation light and high reflectivity to emission light through the genetic algorithm-assisted design of photonic crystal parameters and combine the two photonic crystals to achieve an upper limit beyond the excitation enhancement of a single common photonic crystal due to the resonant cavity. Compared to some works with a high Q factor [31,32]. It is worth stating that these designs focus on the source in the cavity. The walls of the optical cavity can own the high reflection for the wavelength of the source, however, our design is aiming for two wavelengths whose dipole source is in the cavity, and the plane wave is out of the cavity. These are the two main processes of photoluminescence. Because the plane wave is out of the cavity, we need to ensure the plane wave passes the back-forward photonic crystal first, which needs a low reflection of the back-forward photonic crystal. As a result, we have a lower Q factor than previously observed."

            "text": "The finite difference time domain method is one of the effective methods to solve the complex electromagnetic environment generated by the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the matter, and in principle, it can solve the problems of arbitrary forms of electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic wave technology. The finite-time difference method takes a discrete approach to the E and H components of the electromagnetic field with alternate sampling in space and time, and in this way, the Maxwell rotational equations with time variables are transformed into a set of difference equations, and the spatial electromagnetic field is solved step by step in the time axis. The genetic algorithm [33], as a traditional optimization algorithm, is suitable for problems with a moderate number of optimization parameters. The algorithm filters the excellent set of parameters by the fitness function and generates and retains parameters by cross-variance and genetics. The parameters that we optimize by the algorithm are shown in the Table 1. The fitness function reflects the performance of the corresponding parameter structure (The algorithm flow is shown in Supplementary Section S1: Genetic Algorithm). Here we use the finite difference time domain method to calculate the excitation light reflectance Rc1p of the forward photonic crystal; the transmittance Tc1d of the forward photonic crystal point source; the extreme value Emax of the square of the enhanced electric field mode generated by the combination of the backward photonic crystal and the forward photonic crystal; and the reflectance Rc2d of the back photonic crystal point source. The plane wave approximation represents the value of Rc2d (the explanation of this method is given in Supplementary Section S2: Plane wave approximation of spherical waves), and the fitness function is defined by the product of the transmission and reflection values of the\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7803 3 of 10\ncorresponding photonic crystal, as shown in Equations (1) and (2). A high fitnessc1 resulting from the optimization of the genetic algorithm means that the forward photonic crystal has a high reflectance of the excitation light and high transmittance of the emission light, and a high fitnessc2 means that the backward photonic crystal has high transmittance of the excitation light and high reflectance of the emitted light. Overall, these elements reflect the performance of the structure. The Rc1p and Emax respond to the properties of the structure excitation process. Rc1p is related to forward photonic crystals only; Emax is related to forward and back-forward photonic crystals. The Rc2d and Tc1d respond to the properties of the structure emission process. Rc2d is related to back-forward photonic crystals only; Tc1d is related to forward photonic crystals only. We calculate different simulation files with a plane wave or dipole, which include one or more parts of the forward PC, backward PC, and layer of the fluorescent solution.\nAll materials we selected are based on low prices and are easy to access. The Al2O3 [34], SiO2 [35], and TiO2 [36] have these characteristics (the index of materials will be shown in the Supplementary Document Section S3: Index of materials in 400\u2013600 nm)"

After the genetic algorithm-assisted design, we finalized the photonic crystal parameters, as shown in Figure 1a,b, and the transmittance and reflectance of the corresponding two photonic crystals for the excitation wavelength vicinity. It can be found that the backward photonic crystal has a high transmittance near the excitation wavelength of 528 nm, while the forward photonic crystal has a high reflectance. The overall schematic diagram of the structure is shown in Figure 2a. The excitation light reaches the forward photonic crystal and propagates backward due to the photonic forbidden bands. We indicate the reason for electric enhancement in the layer of the fluorescent solution is the F-P cavity consists of a layer of the fluorescent solution and two photonic crystals. Figure 2d shows that the reflection of the plane wave will cause another change of phase by photonic crystal. The electric field will be enhanced when the phase in the cavity changes by a nearly even number of \u03c0 (detailed proof is available in Supplementary Document Section S4: F-P cavity). The photonic crystals led to a phase difference of 48 degrees, and when the plane wave propagates in the cavity for one cycle, its optical distance was nearly about 33.7 \u03c0. The phase difference caused by the photonic crystal can compensate for the propagating phase difference, which ultimately results in enhanced light field interference.

Through numerical calculations, we can 223\nachieve a maximum of 60-fold enhancement under x, y, and z polarizations. We analyzed 224\nthe enhancement conditions of the excitation electric field in the FP cavity.

            "text": "In summary, we designed a one-dimensional photonic crystal large-volume fluorescence enhancement structure containing a Rhodamine 6G (3.18 \u00b5m). By adjusting the photonic cryst l parameters and considering the introduction of defects through the genetic algorithm-assisted design, the large-volume enhancement of Rhodamine 6G is finally achieved by combining the optical resonant cavity under the action of the forbidden band and the conduction band of the photonic crystal. Through numerical calculations, we can achieve a maximum of 60-fold enhancement under x, y, and z polarizations. We analyzed the en ancement conditio s of the excitation electric field in the FP cavity. We also illustrate the periodic enhan ement characteristics of the reflective fl orescence enhancement structure at large volume enhanced fluorescence and perform a qualitative analysis. This design can be used in fields such as displays and further improve device lifetime.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma15217803/s1.
