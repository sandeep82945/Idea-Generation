INTRODUCTION\nMathematical analogies between quantum mechanical systems and vibrating elastic systems have been made since the earliest days of quantum mechanics, when in 1926, Schro\u0308dinger observed that the \u201csquare\u201d of what we now think of as the time-dependent Schro\u0308dinger equation resembles the equation of motion of a vibrating plate [1, 2]. Looking at this in reverse, the EulerBernoulli operator for a freely vibrating plate can be factored into two Schro\u0308dinger-like operators: \u22022t + \u2206\n2 = (i\u2202t + \u2206)(\u2212i\u2202t + \u2206), a property useful in certain solution schemes [3, 4], while it has similarly been shown that the Fo\u0308ppl-von Ka\u0301rma\u0301n operator describing large deflections of the plate can be factored into two nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger-like operators [5]. However, such analogies are fundamentally limited by the fact that the real, scalar transverse plate deflection or some derivative thereof stands in for a complex wavefunction. A closer continuum elastic analogy can be made to one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and this involves a rod or elastica that deflects in two transverse dimensions. Here the components of the deflection vector (or even more powerfully, as we will see, the components of the transverse projection of the tangent vector) can play the roles of Re[\u03a8] and Im[\u03a8]. While aspects of the 1d quantum - 3d rod analogy have appeared in the literature before, the focus has been on time-independent phenomena [6\u201311], specific forms of interaction relevant to semiflexible polymer systems [6\u20138], and nonlinear effects such as bend-twist coupling [9, 10], rather than on pushing the linear timedependent analogy to the point of becoming an isomorphism, as we do here.\nThe value of such an isomorphism is, of course, in the potential to learn something about elastic systems from quantum systems, and vice versa, just as analogies\n\u2217 tyler.engstrom@unco.edu\nbetween the band structure of electronic systems and vibrations of isostatic frames [12], metamaterials [13], jammed packings [14], and continuous plates with patterened resonators [15] have recently been used to predict the existence of topologically protected edge modes in the latter four. As a more historic example, de Gennes showed that quantum fluctuations of a 1d Fermi gas can be mapped to thermal fluctuations of 2d polymeric systems (albeit flexible, not semiflexible polymers), where a \u201cno-crossing\u201d condition for polymer chains plays the role of Fermi statistics [16]. While both the quantum and classical elastic systems considered here are comparatively simple, we nevertheless gain some surprising new insights. We find, for example, that de Broglie relations and uncertainty principles govern momentum-carrying transverse deformation pulses in periodic, inextensible, force and torque-free rods, and that vibrating inextensible rings may carry quantized orbital angular momentum reminiscent of spin. Additionally, a vibrating rod that experiences a spatially periodic body force, such as might be generated by internal interactions, can constitute a classical analog of a 1d Bloch electron (distinct from a phononic crystal in that the vibrations are flexural). The key to all this turns out to be the higher order and therefore virtually unused \u201csquared\u201d Schro\u0308dinger equation.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II develops the quantum side of the analogy and Section III develops the elastic side, as generally as possible. Section IV concerns a specific elastic application, namely the ring or periodic rod mentioned above, for which the analogy lends considerable insight. We end in Section V with suggestions to use the analogy to explore new physics."

            "heading": "III. DYNAMICALLY AND HELICALLY BUCKLED ROD",
            "text": "Equations (6) come from an isomorphic rewriting of a problem in d = 1 quantum mechanics, but in this Section, we attempt to reinterpret them as classical elastic equations of motion for an object living in R3 = R2\u2297Rd. Such a reinterpretation requires neglecting certain terms that have no clear physical meaning in the elastic context, yet these terms involve parameters that do have physical meaning in the elastic context. The conditions on the parameters (and solution regimes) under which these extra terms are negligible establish the limits of validity of the analogy.\nWith this philosophy in mind, we momentarily ignore the last two terms on the right hand sides of Eqs. (6), and notice that what remains are the 3d equations of motion of an Euler-Bernoulli beam with circular cross section, hereafter, a rod. Table I suggests its scale. The rod undergoes transverse deflection from the x-axis pro-\nportional to \u03a8\u20d7, has mass per unit length \u03c1 and bending modulus B, and sustains both an axial moment (torque) M and an axial body force P (x). (P > 0 where the rod is in compression and P < 0 where it is in tension.) Notice that P accounts for twist-induced tension, sug-\ngesting the internal structure of the rod is a bundle of inextensible fibers [18]. This picture is consistent with a single-valued bending modulus for the composite rod structure provided there is no cross-linking [17]. The rod also experiences a \u201csubstrate\u201d force, e.g., from being embedded in an elastic gel, with force constant per unit length K(x). The case of Eqs. (6) with M = K = C = 0 and P > 0 is known as the dynamical buckling equation [19\u201321], yet the extra features described above are well-studied extensions of linear buckling [22\u201324], if not typically together and in a dynamical context. Counterintuitively, even when a rod is everywhere in tension it\n3 can buckle given suitable boundary conditions [25]. The case of Eqs. (6) with P = K = C = 0 describes flexural vibration of a rod with pre-twist [26].\nAs x\u2192 0, the second and fifth terms on the right hand sides of Eqs. (6) can be combined into \u00b1(M\u03a8\u20322,1)\u2032\u2032 where M(x) =M+C(x)x2/2. So for part of the rod, the physical effect of C is to generate a variable axial moment [24]. However, this coefficient doesn\u2019t appear to have a simple physical interpretation that is valid for the entire rod, and so to make Eqs. (6) precisely analogous to an elastic system, we must neglect (and justify neglecting) the C and C \u2032 terms. To do this we introduce the rod length L and note three different cases.\nCase 1: Spatial derivatives of P are negligible, and ML/B and PL2/B are both \u226a 1 so that we may retain terms only to linear order in these quantities in the nondimensionalized equations of motion (lengths measured in units of L, time in units of L2 \u221a \u03c1/B). On the quantum side, this case corresponds to the semiclassical approximation with weak potentials. On the elastic side, it corresponds to small terminal twist angle \u03d5 = (1+\u03bd)ML/B where \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio, and P well below the Euler buckling threshold \u03c02B/L2. Equations (6) reduce to\n\u2212\u03c1\u03a8\u03081 = B\u03a8\u2032\u2032\u2032\u20321 +M\u03a8\u2032\u2032\u20322 + P\u03a8\u2032\u20321 , (7a) \u2212\u03c1\u03a8\u03082 = B\u03a8\u2032\u2032\u2032\u20322 \u2212M\u03a8\u2032\u2032\u20321 + P\u03a8\u2032\u20322 . (7b)\nTo linear order in ML/B, the twist-induced tension contribution to P is not accounted for, and all elastic parameters become independent of one another. Incidentally, static helically buckled rod configurations described by Eqs. (7) map onto the dynamics of a symmetric top that remains nearly upright and has its bottom point fixed, an instance of the Kirchhoff kinetic analogy [22].\nCase 2: For solutions composed entirely of shortwavelength (\u03bb \u226a L) Fourier modes, and for P slowly varying on the scale of \u03bb, the low-derivative-order terms on the right hand sides of Eqs. (6) can be negligible, even when their coefficients are not necessarily small. Specifically, for the C terms to be negligible compared to the M terms we require (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)2 \u226b p/2 + \u03d52/8 and for the K terms to be negligible compared to the P terms we require (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)2 \u226b p/4 + \u03d52/8 + \u03d54/64p, where we have defined p = PL2/B and set \u03bd = 0 for simplicity. This allows for modest values of twist \u03d5, for example four complete twists when P is near the Euler threshold and \u03bb \u226a L/4, yet still corresponding to small torsional strain since the latter is equal to \u03d5 divided by the (extremely large) aspect ratio of the rod. Equations (7) also apply to this case.\nCase 3: M = 0 (or removed via a gauge transformation) and P (x) is an arbitrary function. Equations (6) uncouple and there is a special relationship between the elastic parameters: K = P 2/4B+P \u2032\u2032/2 \u2248 P \u2032\u2032/2 when P is small. In general the substrate term vanishes when P is the solution of an Emden-Fowler equation.\nHere through Section IV we mostly focus on Cases 1 and 2, and at the end of Section V we return to Case 3.\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"w1Ttk7lHt3Nndh2ZdfmZALopvBk=\">AAAB6HicbVA9SwNBEJ2LXzF+RS1tFoNgFe6CqGXAxsIiARMDyRH2NnPJmr29Y3dPCEd+gY2FIrb+JDv/jZvkCk18MPB4b4aZeUEiuDau++0U1tY3NreK26Wd3b39g/LhUVvHqWLYYrGIVSegGgWX2DLcCOwkCmkUCHwIxjcz/+EJleaxvDeTBP2IDiUPOaPGSs27frniVt05yCrxclKBHI1++as3iFkaoTRMUK27npsYP6PKcCZwWuqlGhPKxnSIXUsljVD72fzQKTmzyoCEsbIlDZmrvycyGmk9iQLbGVEz0sveTPzP66YmvPYzLpPUoGSLRWEqiInJ7Gsy4AqZERNLKFPc3krYiCrKjM2mZEPwll9eJe1a1buses2LSr2Wx1GEEziFc/DgCupwCw1oAQOEZ3iFN+fReXHenY9Fa8HJZ47hD5zPH6CxjMY=</latexit> L\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"S7oHCo5W8JQ4fjgvl8pIagCgn8g=\">AAAB73icbVA9SwNBEJ2LXzF+RS1tFoNgFe6CqGXAxsIigvmA5Ahzm71kye7dubsnhCN/wsZCEVv/jp3/xk1yhSY+GHi8N8PMvCARXBvX/XYKa+sbm1vF7dLO7t7+QfnwqKXjVFHWpLGIVSdAzQSPWNNwI1gnUQxlIFg7GN/M/PYTU5rH0YOZJMyXOIx4yCkaK3V6Q5QSyV2/XHGr7hxklXg5qUCORr/81RvENJUsMlSg1l3PTYyfoTKcCjYt9VLNEqRjHLKupRFKpv1sfu+UnFllQMJY2YoMmau/JzKUWk9kYDslmpFe9mbif143NeG1n/EoSQ2L6GJRmApiYjJ7ngy4YtSIiSVIFbe3EjpChdTYiEo2BG/55VXSqlW9y6p3f1Gp1/I4inACp3AOHlxBHW6hAU2gIOAZXuHNeXRenHfnY9FacPKZY/gD5/MHdo6Piw==</latexit>\nL\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"8RKVYy1uCOgieyoAmFxSqcx6sGk=\">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</latexit> t\u0302 = 1 L 2, p 2 L 1, p 2 L 2\nFIG. 1. Arbitrary small 3d deformation produced by subjecting a straight inextensible rod (oriented along x\u0302) to a relative compression \u03b3 (shown greatly exaggerated). The vector function \u03a8\u20d7 = \u03a81y\u0302+\u03a82z\u0302 appearing in the expression for the rod\u2019s unit tangent vector t\u0302 satisfies a \u201csquared\u201d Schro\u0308dinger equation (Eqs.(7)) as well as a normalization-like constraint.\nThe essentially constant coefficients in Eqs. (7) mean that\n\u03a8\u20d7 can now be interpreted as any scaled derivative of the rod\u2019s transverse deflection u\u20d7(x, t) = u1(x, t)y\u0302 + u2(x, t)z\u0302. A particularly compelling choice is \u03a8\u20d7 = u\u20d7\u2032/ \u221a 2\u03b3L, as this gives rise to a geometrical constraint 1 = \u222b dx\u03a8\u20d7 \u00b7 \u03a8\u20d7 if the rod is inextensible, i.e., if the contour length of its centerline does not change. Here L is redefined as the projected (onto the x-axis) length of the rod, and \u03b3 is its relative compression (not to be confused with axial strain, and not necessarily implying that P > 0). Figure 1 shows\nthis geometry, and how \u03a8\u20d7 becomes a scaled transverse projection of the rod\u2019s tangent vector. The inextensibility constraint written above is the leading order term in an expansion and so is valid only when u\u20d7\u2032 \u00b7 u\u20d7\u2032 \u226a 1 everywhere, meaning \u03b3 \u226a 1. Inextensibility is a good assumption for semiflexible polymers \u2014 it being an ingredient of the wormlike chain model [17] \u2014 and is consistent with the internal structure of the rod inferred earlier, even though that structure is not accounted for at linear order in ML/B. So setting aside the broader analogy that\ncan be made without specifying \u03a8\u20d7 in favor of the deeper one that can be made by assigning \u03a8\u20d7 = u\u20d7\u2032/ \u221a 2\u03b3L to an inextensible rod, we proceed with the latter assignment except where otherwise noted. Thus, there exist \u201cnormalized\u201d solutions of Eqs. (7) of the form\n\u03a8\u20d7(x, t) = \u2211\nn\nR(\u2212\u03c9nt)cn\u03c8\u20d7n(x), (8)\nwhere (H\u0303/\u210f)\u03c8\u20d7n = \u03c9n\u03c8\u20d7n, \u03b4nm = \u222b dx \u03c8\u20d7n \u00b7\u03c8\u20d7m, 1 = \u2211 n c 2 n,\n4 and in rod language,\nH\u0303 \u210f = \u2212\n\u221a B\n\u03c1\n \u2202 2 x + 2 ( M 4B )2 + P2B 2 ( M 4B ) \u2202x\n\u22122 ( M 4B ) \u2202x \u2202 2 x + 2 ( M 4B )2 + P2B\n  .\n(9) Note the identity R(\u03b1) = exp[\u03b1R(\u03c0/2)], Euler\u2019s for-\nmula for 2d rotations. The \u03c8\u20d7n are, in general, nonplanar due to M , they rotate at angular frequencies \u03c9n, and they correspond to stationary states. That is, if \u03c8n = \u03c8n,1 + i\u03c8n,2 is an eigenstate of H\u0302 with eigenvalue\nEn, then \u03c8\u20d7n = (\u03c8n,1, \u03c8n,2) is an eigenstate of H\u0303 with the same eigenvalue. While the above described solution is not the only form of solution to Eqs. (7) \u2014 more gen-\nerally, the \u03c8\u20d7n satisfy the \u201csquared\u201d eigenvalue equation (H\u0303/\u210f)2\u03c8\u20d7n = \u03c92n\u03c8\u20d7n \u2014we focus on this form since it is also a solution of the lower order Eq. (2) with (9) and therefore gives maximum contact with quantum mechanical methods and results.\nThe linear Eqs. (7) are agnostic as to whether \u03c1 is mass per unit length in the x-direction or mass per unit contour length (the local conversion factor being 1+\u03b3L\u03a82), and therefore, we are free to choose the latter definition, which is the more realistic for an inextensible rod. A consequence is that purely transverse vibration of the inextensible rod is associated with a longitudinally propagating momentum. One way to see this is by combining the continuity equation \u2202t[\u03c1(1 + \u03b3L\u03a8\n2)] + \u2202xg = 0 with Eqs. (2) and (9) to obtain the momentum density\ng(x, t) = \u22122\u03b3L \u221a \u03c1B [ \u03a8\u20d7 \u00b7R (\u03c0 2 ) \u03a8\u20d7\u2032 + M 4B \u03a82 ] . (10)\nComparing to the quantum mechanical momentum density, i.e., m times the probability current \u2212(\u210f/m){Re[\u03a8\u2217i\u03a8\u2032] + (qA/\u210f)|\u03a8|2}, leads to the identification\n\u210f = 2\u03b3L \u221a \u03c1B, (11)\nin terms of rod parameters. Putting this in the relationship B/\u03c1 = (\u210f/2m)2 further identifies m = \u03b3\u03c1L. This result makes intuitive sense: the rod has mass \u03c1L (to leading order), and so the pulse mass set in motion by a relative compression \u03b3 is \u03b3\u03c1L (to leading order). In other words, the isomorphism connects a massive quantum particle with a much more massive (by a factor of \u03b3\u22121) elastic rod. For a field theoretic perspective on the rod\u2019s momentum density, we introduce the Lagrangian density\nL = 1 2\n[ \u03c1( \u02d9\u20d7u)2\u2212B(u\u20d7\u2032\u2032)2\u2212Mu\u20d7\u2032 \u00b7R (\u03c0 2 ) u\u20d7\u2032\u2032+P (u\u20d7\u2032)2 ] , (12)\nfrom which Eqs. (7) can be obtained. The last two terms represent energy stored by twisting and work done by P , and within Case 1, i.e., to linear order in ML/B, these terms are isomorphic to \u2212A\u00b5j\u00b5 of classical electrodynamics. This follows from our previous results qA\u00b5 = \u2212\u03b3L(P, \u221a \u03c1 4BM, 0, 0) and j \u00b5/q \u2194\n(\u03a82, g/\u03c1\u03b3L, 0, 0). Calculating the relevant component of the energy-momentum tensor\nT\u03b1\u00b5 = [ \u2202L \u2202ui,\u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2 ( \u2202L \u2202ui,\u03b1\u03b2 )] ui,\u00b5 + \u2202L \u2202ui,\u03b1\u03b2\nui,\u03b2\u00b5 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u00b5L, (13)\nderived in Appendix A, gives momentum density g = \u2212T 01 = \u2212\u03c1 \u02d9\u20d7u \u00b7 u\u20d7\u2032, which matches Eq. (10) when M = P = 0. (To see this, use u\u20d7 as the dependent variable in Eq. (2), which is a valid procedure within Cases 1 and 2 as discussed above.) For yet a third perspective, consider the following geometric argument due to Rowland and Pask [27]. Setting up a waveform in an initially straight inextensible rod requires that one end of the rod move by a distance \u03b3L = 12 \u222b L 0 dx(u\u20d7\u2032)2 toward the other, as shown in Figure 1. If the waveform has only one spectral component, then the solution has the property u\u20d7\u2032 = \u2212 \u02d9\u20d7u/x\u0307, where x\u0307 is the phase velocity (we will see a specific example in Section IV). Substituting this for one factor of u\u20d7\u2032 in the integrand yields \u222b dt \u02d9(\u03b3L) = \u2212 12 \u222b dt \u02d9\u20d7u\u00b7u\u20d7\u2032, hence g = \u2212 12\u03c1 \u02d9\u20d7u\u00b7u\u20d7\u2032, half of that predicted by the other two methods when M = P = 0. Rowland and Pask point out that this geometric argument gives the correct result for inextensible strings, and in that linear dispersion context the waveform need not be restricted to one spectral component."

(14) is, up to a rigid translation of the guiding center,\nu\u20d7n(x, t) = \u2212 \u221a 2\u03b3\nkn R(knx\u2212 \u03c9nt)z\u0302, (15)\nand one can readily verify that u\u20d7\u2032n = \u2212(kn/\u03c9n) \u02d9\u20d7un as required by the geometric argument. Letting the plane of the ring be perpendicular to the z-axis, (L/2\u03c0) \u222b L 0 dxg yields orbital angular momentum\n5 Lz =\n   \u210f ( n\u2212 \u03d5\u03d50 ) , g from continuity equation, \u210f ( n\u2212 2 \u03d5\u03d50 \u2212 1 n [ 2 ( \u03d5 \u03d50 )2 + p8\u03c02 ]) , g from energy-momentum tensor,\n\u210f ( n 2 \u2212 \u03d5 \u03d50 \u2212 1n [( \u03d5 \u03d50 )2 + p16\u03c02 ]) , g from geometric argument.\n(16)\nThe first two methods predict Lz is quantized in units of \u210f when M = P = 0, while the third method intriguingly predicts Lz is quantized in units of \u210f/2 whenM = P = 0. Of course, when we say \u201cunits of \u210f\u201d we are assuming the factor of length change \u03b3L in \u210f is independent of n, which is not intuitive for elastic rings. And yet the isomorphism is describing a particular elastic ring for which \u03b3L is indeed independent of n. Next we consider nonzero M and P within a sub-case of Case 2 corresponding to 4\u03c02L/\u03bb \u226b p/2 + \u03d52/8. Within this sub-case the terms \u223c 1/n in Eq. (16) are negligible, and the Lz spectrum becomes periodic in \u03d5 with period \u03d50 or \u03d50/2, depending on method. Thus \u03d50 (or \u03d50/2) plays a role comparable to that of the flux quantum for a conducting loop in a magnetic field [28, 29], just not in a thermal equilibrium sense since here the total energy (found by changing the signs of the last three terms in Eq. (12) and integrating over x) is not also periodic in \u03d5. Letting Eqs. (14) describe the periodic straight rod and setting M = P = 0 yields a set of de Broglie relations: px = \u222b dxg = \u210fkn (using one of the first two methods for g) and E = \u210f\u03c9n (equal parts kinetic and potential energy and also applicable to the ring). There is also orbital angular momentum Lx = \u222b dx\u03c1u2n\u03c9n = \u210f, which makes the rod reminiscent of an OAM beam [30]. Now suppose the rod is sufficiently long that we can take the kn to be continuous. The general t = 0 state of the rod is given by\n\u03a8\u20d7(x, 0) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0\n\u222b dk R(kx)\u2126\u20d7(k), (17)\nwhere \u2126\u20d7(k) is the continuum generalization of cny\u0302 in Eqs. (8) and (14a). The relationship between \u03a8\u20d7(x, 0)\nand \u2126\u20d7(k) is isomorphic to that of a Fourier transform\npair, as shown in Appendix B. Thus if \u2126\u20d7(k) is a peaked vector function with characteristic peak width \u2206k, then\n\u03a8\u20d7(x, 0) describes a transverse deformation with characteristic length \u2206x (as in the lower image of Figure 1), and by a property of Fourier transforms, \u2206x\u2206k >\u223c 1. This inequality is generic and unremarkable, but when combined with the first de Broglie relation for the rod, it becomes the rather more remarkable Heisenberg uncertainty principle\n\u2206x\u2206px >\u223c \u210f. (18)\nAn energy-time uncertainty principle follows from the other de Broglie relation: a transverse deformation pulse of spatial extent \u2206x moving at the group velocity \u2202\u03c9/\u2202k \u223c \u2206\u03c9/\u2206k takes time \u2206t \u223c \u2206x\u2206k/\u2206\u03c9 >\u223c 1/\u2206\u03c9\nto pass a particular point, hence\n\u2206t\u2206E >\u223c \u210f.

            "text": "Conventional wisdom has it that Eq. (18) is fundamentally quantum mechanical, foreign to classical mechanics. While this may be true for classical mechanics of particles, it is evidently not so for classical mechanics of elastic continua. One might argue that \u210f would not appear in any purely classical theory, but we again point to Table I which demonstrates that a rod with ratio of bending modulus to linear density equal to (\u210f/2me)2 is comparable to a microtubule or in fact something a bit heavier \u2014 a classical object indeed. And recall that the right hand side of Eq. (18) can be written purely in terms of classical rod parameters, per Eq. (11). It is somewhat unsatisfying that three different methods give three different results for g, and thus the inextensible ring\u2019s Lz, but a few comments are in order. First, the geometric argument makes use of a \u03b3 = 0 reference state that is distinct from that of other two methods, and also appears to have no counterpart in the quantum problem. (A complex wavefunction that is \u201cstretched out\u201d beyond the extent of its real-space domain is an unphysical concept.) Second, the previously mentioned equipartition of energy when M = P = 0 suggests that half of the g obtained from the first two methods may actually be a pseudo-momentum density associated with potential energy transport. This has also been suggested for inextensible strings [27]. Third, recall that quantum mechanics itself suffers from method dependence: half-integer angular momenta defy an apparently rigorous separation of variables method but yield to an algebraic method. Indeed, the possibility of the inextensible ring\u2019s Lz being quantized in units of \u210f/2 hints at the notion of the ring as a particle-like entity. We have seen that this \u201cparticle\u201d would have mass greater by a factor of \u03b3\u22121 than the mass m of some corresponding particle. If m = me, which again suggests taking B and \u03c1 values from a microtubule, then we may crudely estimate \u03b3L = \u210f/2 \u221a \u03c1B \u223c 10\u221217 m, and crudely estimate the ring\u2019s mass to radius ratio as 2\u03c0me/\u03b3L \u223c 10\u221212 kg/m. The slenderness requirement (L \u226b microtubule radius) leads to an estimate \u03b3 \u226a 10\u22129; for \u03b3 this small, the EulerBernoulli description and the form of the inextensibility constraint we have used are essentially exact. Attempting to further constrain \u03b3 and L would be an interesting direction for future work.\n6 Another future direction concerns the analog of wavefunction collapse. Conventionally in dynamical buckling (whereM = K = 0 and P is a positive constant), one assumes that a perturbation with wave number k grows at rate \u03c3(k). This leads to a prediction that the fastestgrowing, hence, most probable mode is the one with k = \u221a P/2B, a result that is in good agreement with experiments on rings confined to buckle in plane [19]. (As the authors point out, this agreement can be taken as evidence that the ring curvature is negligible for slender rings, as we have assumed in Section IV.) The natural question to ask in the present context, however, is not which mode is selected out of an unbuckled state, but which mode is selected out of a superposition state? Because Eq. (18) is linked to the statistical interpretation in quantum mechanics, its presence here also hints at a statistical interpretation, i.e., that the c2n may be probabilities of the outcomes of measurements, such as of the straight rod\u2019s Lx = \u222b dx\u03c1u2\u03c9.\nFinally, let us return to Case 3, where \u03a8\u20d7 \u223c rod deflection and P (x) is an arbitrary function. A convenient property of the isomorphism is that if PL2/B is a weak sinusoidal function, so is (KL4/B) \u2248 (PL2/2B)\u2032\u2032. This suggests engineering out-of-phase sinusoidal variations in the axial body force and in the substrate stiffness. One way to achieve the former could be by manipulating intrachain interactions in a stiff polyelectrolyte \u2014 already implicated in buckling [8] \u2014 by creating an alternating pattern of charged and neutral monomer blocks [31]. If such a polymer were made to vibrate in a non-dissipative environment of similar polymers, all parallel to and in registry with the first, the effective K from that environment should oscillate out of phase with P and be tunable in strength through the environment density. Eigenstates of Eq. (9) would then be expected to have the Bloch form\n\u03c8\u20d7n,k(x) \u223c R(kx)w\u20d7n,k(x), (20)\nwhere n is a band index and the function w\u20d7 has the periodicity of the monomer pattern. Assuming such a system could be realized experimentally, one might then imagine adiabatically varying the boundary conditions \u2014 certain of which are equivalent to twist via a gauge transformation \u2014 to search for more exotic physics such as the Zak phase [32], but in a classical setting."
