Mechanisms of AMR Development in Relation to Temperature Variability: Conduct experimental studies at the microbiological level to understand how temperature fluctuations influence the genetic mechanisms of AMR development, focusing on horizontal gene transfer among bacteria. This research could help clarify the biological pathways through which temperature affects the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

Impact of Climate Change on AMR in the One Health Context: Investigate the broader implications of climate change on AMR across different ecosystems, including wildlife, agriculture, and urban environments. This multidisciplinary study would encompass the One Health approach, examining how changing climates alter interactions among humans, animals, and their shared environments, subsequently influencing AMR patterns.

Socioeconomic and Governance Factors Influencing AMR: Dive deeper into the role of socioeconomic status, healthcare infrastructure, and governance in mitigating or exacerbating AMR spread. This could involve comparative analyses across countries with varying income levels and governance efficiencies to identify best practices and policies that effectively reduce AMR.

Longitudinal Studies on AMR Trends and Antibiotic Consumption: Design longitudinal studies to track AMR trends over time in relation to antibiotic consumption patterns, both in human healthcare and in agriculture. Such studies could help identify causative relationships and effective points of intervention to reduce AMR proliferation.

Development and Evaluation of AMR Mitigation Strategies: Based on findings that antibiotic consumption and governance are significant factors in AMR, develop and evaluate targeted intervention strategies aimed at promoting judicious antibiotic use and improving healthcare governance. This research could include the implementation of stewardship programs, public awareness campaigns, and policy reforms, followed by assessment of their impact on AMR rates.
