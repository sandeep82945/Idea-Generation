1. **Investigate the use of different metal ions in the MOF structure to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor.** For example, lanthanides such as europium or dysprosium have been shown to have strong luminescence properties that could be exploited for sensing applications.
2. **Explore the use of different organic ligands in the MOF structure to tailor the sensor's response to specific analytes.** For example, ligands with different functional groups could be used to enhance the binding affinity of the sensor for melamine or other target molecules.
3. **Develop a portable or handheld device based on the MOF sensor for on-site detection of melamine in milk powder and other food products.** This would enable rapid and convenient screening of food products for adulteration.
4. **Investigate the use of the MOF sensor for the detection of other food contaminants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, or mycotoxins.** This would expand the applicability of the sensor and make it a valuable tool for ensuring food safety.
5. **Explore the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze the sensor data and improve the accuracy and reliability of the detection method.** This could help to automate the detection process and reduce the risk of false positives or false negatives.
