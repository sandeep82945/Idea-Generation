    "abstractText": "When a mobile manipulator\u2019s wheel loses contact with the ground, the manipulator may overturn, causing material damage, and in the worst case, putting human lives in danger. The overturning stability of wheeledmobilemanipulatorsmust not be overlooked at any stage of themobilemanipulator\u2019s life, starting from the design phase, continuing through the commissioning period and extending to the operational phase. The various overturning stability criteria formulated throughout the years do not explicitly consider normal wheel loads, with most of them relying on the prescribed stability margins in terms of overturning moments. These formulations commonly consider the overturning moments regarding axes connecting the adjacent manipulator\u2019s contact points with the ground and could be notably restrictive. Explicit expressions for the supporting forces of the manipulator provide the best insights into the relevant affecting terms that contribute to the overturning (in)stability. They also reduce the necessity for considering about which axis the manipulator could overturn and simultaneously enable the formulation of more intuitive stability margins and on-line overturning prevention techniques. The present study presents a general dynamics modelling approach in the Newton\u2013Euler framework using 6D vectors and provides normal wheel load equations for a typical 4-wheeled rigid-chassis mobile manipulator traversing uneven terrain. The given expressions are expected to become the standard guidelines in considered wheeled mobile manipulators and to provide a basis for effective overturning stability criteria and overturning avoidance techniques. Based on the presented results, specific improvements of the state-of-the-art criteria are discussed. INDEX TERMS Mobile manipulators, multibody dynamics, tip-over monitoring, wheel normal loads.",

INTRODUCTION Mobile manipulators have considerable application potential in various fields such as mining, logging, construction, earthmoving, searching and rescuing, agriculture, and planetary exploration [1]\u2013[3]. The overturning stability of these vehicles equipped with a manipulator arm is crucial regardless of the level of automation. Heavy-duty mobile manipulators face the risk of overturning if operated inadequately by an unskilled (tele)operator and in case of unexpected occurrences. Slope negotiations in sites where soil may also be unstable can be incredibly challenging [4]. In dexterous, manoeuvrable, compact, and lightweight robots, the risk of overturning is due to a high centre of mass (COM) and small\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Hassen Ouakad .\nweight and ground base, especially in combination with high loads and accelerations [5].\nSimple thought experiments can suffice to introduce the motivation for the following analysis. Let us consider, for example, a lightweight wheeled platform that carries amanipulator arm of comparable weight. It is intuitively clear that overturning can occur under specific disadvantageous arm postures, especially with external forces acting on the manipulator tip, for example, when carrying a load or interacting with surroundings. An additional aggravating factor, in this case, can be sloped and rugged terrain. Overturning begins by making one or more ground reactions equal to zero at first; then, if some preventive action is not taken in time, material and collateral damage are imminent. Although the mobile manipulator will eventually topple on one of its sides, loss of contact with the ground for one wheel is a reason for alarm. Extra special care must be taken\nVOLUME 11, 2023 2022 The Authors. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In other mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, where a human-operated heavy-duty mobile manipulator (e.g., an excavator) is working in an environment with other people nearby, human lives can be at stake in a severe turn of events if overturning occurs. These considerations in two different settings also emphasise the significance of monitoring tyre loads even in semi- and nonautomated solutions, making overturning stability indicators necessary in regular everyday use. However, in the absence of (tele)operator action, fully automated solutions rely wholly on how well the overturning stability indicator is formulated.\nThe overturning analysis of a mobile manipulator should come into focus starting from the early design stages where the number of wheels, size, mass, the position of the manipulator arm and, possibly, other manipulator parameters are optimised to maximise the workspace and provide the relative stability margin against overturning in the most critical predicted cases [6]. Even detailed analyses such as these, performed in advance, may not be able to anticipate the specific, unexpected course of events during operation. Thus, overturning monitoring should create an alert and start the overturning avoidance sequence whenever an overturning danger exists.\nA well-defined overturning stability indicator may explicitly or implicitly address the wheel supporting forces. It must also include all the relevant factors that affect the forces. Although the relevance of each one, per se, might not be the same from case to case, all potentially influential factors must be preliminarily considered in a general contemplation. These include all the system masses and moments of inertia, together with all the significant linear/angular accelerations/velocities/positions and terrain slopes.\nAs the literature review in Section II shows, overturning stability monitoring in wheeled mobile manipulators has received significant attention continuously over the years. Although various approaches with different underlying concepts and modelling complexities have been proposed, the methods usually lack detailed expressions for normal loads and overturning stability criteria considering the supporting forces accompanied by full-dynamics modelling. It must be noted that for some reason, a gap exists between the fields of research of car and mobile manipulators in calculating wheel supporting forces, although weight transfer to tyres is a common sphere of interest. Once this particular gap is overcome and the expanded expressions for normal tyre loads are derived from the full-dynamics model, overturning axes will not have to be considered any more.\nThe overturning criterion can be formulated most naturally in terms of normal loads. By monitoring normal wheel loads, one can effectively trace if the value of any supporting forces approaches some prescribed critical value, which is an intuitive problem solution. As the main contribution, the present study closes one existing gap between car and mobile manipulator dynamics by providing an extension of expressions for normal car wheel loads to the case where a manipulator arm exists on\ntop of a wheeled platform. We further show how the overturning stability indicator based on wheel loads removes the need for addressing overturning axes, while neither imposing additional restrictions nor being computationally demanding. Appropriate alternatives to the state-of-the-art overturning criteria are suggested but do not take the central focus here.\nThe present study provides a detailed dynamics model, under the veil of the Newton\u2013Euler (N\u2013E) formalism using 6D vectors of a 4-all-wheel-drive (4AWD) rigid-chassis mobile manipulator negotiating uneven terrain. The specimen 4AWDmobile manipulator is chosen for analysis since it offers a fair amount of generality without introducing excessive complexity. Heavy-duty machines with Ackermann or skid steering can be considered special cases of the case presented here. Additional efforts must be made in the case of articulated steering and in the case of six or more wheels. The special wheel-legged chassis case in which the position of the wheels can be adjusted during operation must be also analysed separately and is not covered by the present study. Because the same reasoning and line of thought as presented here should be followed in those situations, they will not receive special attention in the following analysis.\nSubsystem-by-subsystem modelling and underlying analysis were performed in detail with a minimum number of reasonable assumptions to balance the complexity and practicality with the modelling accuracy. Expressions for normal wheel loads are derived in a neat and structured manner. These provide the basis for the proposed overturning force (OTF) criterion, which does not rely on a typically used overturning axis, and can be considered as a quick and better alternative to the state-of-the-art criteria. It is expected that this or similar criteria will become a de-facto standard overturning stability indicator in mobile manipulators. Having explicit expressions for normal wheel loads makes it easy to perform term-by-term analysis starting from the design phase. It also makes the formulation of overturning prevention actions more straightforward. Apart from getting good general insights, end-users will also be able to tailor the given expressions according to their own needs.\nThe validity of the derived expressions for normal forces is verified in the Simscape MultibodyTM by comparing results to the unbiased reference from the renowned software.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II gives a literature overview to situate the present study better. Section III motivates the use of the N\u2013E formalism in the discussed context. Section IV presents the essential mathematical preliminaries. Section V addresses the kinematics of a mobile manipulator negotiating a slope. Section VI provides 6D vector models of the wheel and chassis dynamics. Section VII deals with equations whose solutions are tyresupporting forces. SectionVIII presents the simulation results and suggests improvements of relevant tip-over stability and avoidance criteria along with parameter uncertainty analysis. Section IX contemplates the obtained results. Section X summarises the conclusions drawn.\n43236 VOLUME 11, 2023\nII. LITERATURE REVIEW The idea of the zero moment point (ZMP), [7], addresses a point on the ground where the resultant moment of the external and inertial forces is equal to zero. Initially proposed in [8] for use in mobile manipulators, referring to the position of the ZMP with respect to the stability polygon, it has remained a key aspect of the research on overturning stability and related topics. Often, remarkably simplified dynamics models are combined with ZMP, and this fact has been a common cause for criticism in the mobile-manipulator community. Using the ZMP-based stability criterion from paper [9], paper [10] reported that the ZMP is a less sensitive indicator than the Force-Angle (FA) or Moment-Height Stability (MHS) for certain mobile manipulators. However, ZMP has proven to be helpful in on-line trajectory planning both for light and heavy mobile manipulators [11]\u2013[13] and for quadrupedal ones with wheels [14]. It contrasts the full-dynamics modelling narrative promoted here, with the primary aim being deriving expressions for supporting forces.\nContinuing efforts on developing improved tip-over indicators gave rise to the FA indicator [15], with heavy-duty mobile machines serving as the primary source of inspiration. Note that this criterion would provide a relevant and reliable indication at low speeds and with external forces of large magnitudes. The FA stability indicator considers the angle between the net force (excluding the ground support reaction forces) reduced to the planarmass system\u2019s COMand the rays connecting the sameCOMwith the ground connection points. A vital aspect of the discussion concerns the tipping-over axis. Natural tip-over and tripped tip-over notions have been introduced. The tip-over is considered natural if overturning occurs about one of the axes connecting the manipulator support points in contact with the ground (support polygon vertices). The tripped tip-over occurs about an axis representing a linear combination of the abovementioned axes. Examination of the tripped tip-over seems to be abandoned in mainstream research, and it will be recalled here. A FA tip-over prevention algorithm was presented in [16].\nIn [17], also assuming that tipping-over will occur about one of the axes connecting the manipulator wheels, the MHS stability criterion was formulated utilising the overturning moments without explicitly addressing ground reactions. A simple method to include the chassis COM height was presented and created a significant impact. Being a direct consequence of the dynamics modelling in the N\u2013E framework, it has neatly brought focus to forces/moments acting at the chassis/manipulator base connection. The formulation has opened a path to more detailed stability criteria by explicitly addressing certain key factors in the normal load analysis. An on-line tip-over preventionMHS-based criterion was proposed in [18] and was compared to the FA-method based.\nThe study [19] resumed the established trend of formulating tipping-over stability indicators using moments about the manipulator supporting polygon axes. The Tipping Over Moment (TOM) criterion is an extended and improved\nversion of the MHS. It includes the wheeled platform weight in the analysis and presents a reasonably formulated criterion, which, similarly to its predecessor MHS, does not explicitly consider the inertial forces and ground reactions of the wheeled platform. The TOM essentially investigates the values of the anti-tipping-over moment, referring to the negative moment values as the ones providing stability. These moments are compared to the prescribed relative stability margin values, as in paper [20] for a dual-armed wheel robot. In [21], the TOM was used to calculate the deceleration of a mobile manipulator such that tip-over was prevented.\nBy examining the research trends in the tip-over stability of mobile manipulators, researchers have attempted to improve the TOM by performing modelling with fewer approximations in a usable manner. In the study [22], a significant Improved Tipping Over Moment (ITOM) indicator was proposed. This indicator is qualified to be named like that because it includes a wheeled platform\u2019s inertial forces in the TOM. These forces have been usually neglected terms throughout the years in this line of research, although they are undoubtedly worth considering, in light of the significant dynamic coupling between the manipulator arm and the wheeled platform. The analysis which led to the ITOM formulation considered a manipulator negotiating a constant slope in the direction of motion. As with TOM, tipping-over axes with ITOM were again assumed to connect vertices of the support polygon, and thus, the supporting forces were not explicitly considered. It was also argued that analytic expressions for ITOM are hard to obtain. A complex manipulator arm inevitably leads to complicated equations ofmotion; however, with careful rearrangement in a structured manner, many significant insights can be obtained from neat analytic expressions. Although specific challenges exist, it is plausible to obtain relatively simple analytic expressions for supporting forces by expanding ideas from car dynamics.\nA detailed discussion regarding the terrain slope has usually been avoided when the tip-over stability was examined. Commonly, two Euler angles at most were considered to be sufficient to describe the orientation of the chassis to the inertial frame of reference, fixed in the earth-tangent plane. Interestingly enough, weight transfer to wheels of an accelerating platform negotiating a slope has been an omnipresent topic in car dynamics, [23].\nWeight transfer to the wheels, i.e. the tyre normal load, had always required special attention in the field of car dynamics because the standard tyre/road interaction models use the normal force to calculate the remaining tyre/road forces/moments, [24]\u2013[25]. Thus, this issue has been recognised and has been widely addressed, usually providing approximate expressions which are sufficient to address car motion. The problem of quantifying wheel loads becomes complicated in mobile manipulators with a manipulator arm attached to the chassis and interacting with the surroundings. In the general case, where the tyre weight can not be neglected, and both manipulator posture and movements will\nVOLUME 11, 2023 43237\naffect the normal tyre load, existing straightforward expressions require an extension.\nAn effort for explicitly formulating a tipping-over stability criterion using wheel loads can be found in [26], in which the analysis of the dynamics is over-simplified. Explicit formulation using normal wheel loads is experimentally addressed in [27] on a small-scale laboratory test bench. However, because the discussed approach requires the measurement of normal loads, it falls out of the perspective for the proposed narrative because of the high cost and potentially impossible force sensor integrity preservation in heavy-duty mobile manipulators. Explicit formulation of the stability criterion in terms of the wheel loads for a 3-wheeled mobile robot together with real-time tip-over prevention and path following control using fuzzy and neural-fuzzy approaches can be found in [28]. Related detailed derivations, in this 3-wheeled case, have been provided in the predecessor paper [29], which also advocates the monitoring of normal wheel forces.\nA recent study assessing the rollover risk in a 4-wheeled articulated-steering vehicle recognized the case in which one wheel off the ground is the dangerous state [30]. The authors used neural networks to estimate the rollover risk probability without detailed dynamics modelling, exploiting experimental data.\nReferences [31]\u2013[32] provide detailed models for articulated-steering and wheel-legged manipulators, respectively. These models are extensive and were verified using renowned software; however, they both provide expressions for normal forces as proportional to tyre and spring deformation, respectively. This way to model the wheel loads in simulation software is one of the best and most common [3], [33], and these expressions are known to provide reliable numerical solutions. Written like this, they deal with consequences rather than causes and induce the need for likely retroactive decision-making regarding the relevant factors in overturning stability. The present study intends to raise awareness of the need to reformulate expressions for normal wheel forces in all relevant steering configurations, following the presented ideas.\nBased on the literature review above, the present study aims to provide a solution for the identified gap between car andmobilemanipulator dynamics. By removing the overturning axis restrictions, we aim to establish a trend of monitoring supporting forces as the most relevant overturning stability factor in wheeled mobile manipulators.\nIII. CHOOSING THE MODELLING FORMALISM Among the various approaches for dynamics modelling, the Lagrange formulation, which is based on kinetic and potential energies, and the N\u2013E formulation, which is based on the balance of forces acting on a rigid manipulator link, are the most common, with the N\u2013E approach considered as more fundamental [34].\nIn the recursive N\u2013E algorithm (RNEA), the number of computations linearly increases with the number of degrees of freedom (DOF). Using the RNEA, linear/angular velocity\nvectors are calculated from a manipulator arm base to a manipulator arm tip. Forces/moments are calculated in the reverse order, going from the manipulator arm tip to the arm base. In the case of mobile manipulators, it will be interesting to note that the kinematics analysis starts with the chassis and branches towards each wheel and the manipulator arm tool centre-point (TCP). Irrespectively of the underlying case, kinematic relations must first be appropriately established because all the subsequent results depend on them.\nReformulations of the RNEA equations using 6D vectors where linear and angular velocities are stacked together, apart from leading to the more compact notation, allow a problem be solved more directly, at a higher level of abstraction, [35]. Mathematical models formulated using the 6D vector RNEA are also indispensable, for example, in the virtual decomposition control (VDC) field of research, [36].\nApart from the 6D RNEA benefits mentioned above, the primary motivation for using the N\u2013E formulation here is that the free-body diagram analysis allows the direct inclusion of ground reaction forces in the dynamics analysis. In line with this direct inclusion of the manipulator supporting forces, all relevant geometric and inertial properties are naturally included in the expressions, which will be derived here as the main result.\nA 6D vector dynamics model of a mobile manipulator will be derived starting with the derivation of a wheel dynamics model, followed by that of a chassis dynamics model. As a manipulator arm, a serial-parallel hydraulic manipulator will be used and modelled using the state-of-the-art N\u2013E model given in [37], although any N\u2013E model of any manipulator arm would fit in the proposed narrative.\nIV. MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES Inevitable terms and notions are presented here from [38].\nEvery rigid body in the analysis will have at least one three-dimensional coordinate system {A} (called frame {A} in the following text) attached to it.\nLet the linear and angular velocities as sensed in frame {A} be denoted throughout the paper as Av = ( Avx Avy Avz )T and A\u03c9 = ( A\u03c9x A\u03c9y A\u03c9z\n)T , respectively. Furthermore, adopting the notation from [38], the 6D linear/angular velocity vector in frame {A} is given as follows:\nAV = ( AvT A\u03c9T )T \u2208 R6. (1)\nLet the force and moment vectors applied to the origin of frame {A} be similarly denoted as velocities using notation Af = ( Afx Afy Afz )T for forces and similar notation Am = ( Amx Amy Amz\n)T for moments. Similar to (1), the 6D force/moment vector, as sensed and expressed in frame {A}, is introduced as follows:\nAF = ( Af T AmT )T \u2208 R6. (2)\nFurthermore, let frame {B} be attached to the same rigid body as frame {A}. Moving the force from the origin of frame {A} to the origin of frame {B} introduces the moment of that\n43238 VOLUME 11, 2023\nforce about the origin of frame {B}. Then, quantities from (1) and (2) can be transformed among the frames using relations:\nBV = AUTB AV , (3)\nand\nAF = AUB BF, (4)\nwhere AUB \u2208 R6\u00d76 in (3) and (4) is a force/moment transformation matrix, transforming the force/moment vector measured and expressed in frame {B} to the same force/moment vector measured and expressed in frame {A}. The transformation matrix can be further written as follows:\nAUB = ( ARB O3\u00d73(\nArAB\u00d7 ) ARB ARB\n) , (5)\nwhere ARB \u2208 R3\u00d73 is a rotation (direction cosine) matrix from frame {A} to frame {B}, O3\u00d73 denotes a 3-by-3 zeromatrix, and ( ArAB\u00d7 ) in (5) is a skew-symmetric matrix operator, intended for cross-product calculation, which is defined as follows:(\nArAB\u00d7 ) =  0 \u2212rz ryrz 0 \u2212rx \u2212ry rx 0  , (6) with rx , ry and rz denoting distances from the origin of frame {A} to the origin of frame {B} along the frame {A} x-, y- and z-axis, respectively.\nThe net force/moment vector AF\u2217 \u2208 R6 of a rigid body in frame {A} is defined as follows:\nMA d dt\n( AV ) + CA ( A\u03c9 ) AV +GA = AF\u2217, (7)\nwhere MA \u2208 R6\u00d76 is the mass matrix, CA ( A\u03c9 ) \u2208 R6\u00d76 is the matrix of Coriolis and centrifugal terms, and GA \u2208 R6 includes the gravity terms. Detailed expressions for matrices in (7) when a body-fixed frame adopts all the body motions are given in [38]. In cases when it is not convenient for the underlying analysis to assume that the body-fixed frame adopts all the body motions, as will be here when analysing wheel dynamics, a straightforward application of expressions from [38] is not possible, and reformulation is required.\nV. KINEMATIC CHAIN Let us observe a rigid chassis of a mobile manipulator negotiating a slope in Fig. 1. Manipulator arm and wheels are not shown here for the sake of visibility and clarity. Their respective orientations are defined relative to the chassis orientation andwill be addressedwhen required and appropriate.\nFor the sake of clarity, it is necessary to address certain underlying assumptions before proceeding with the analysis\nsince theywill strongly affect the derivation of kinematics and dynamics relations. Assumption 1: \u2018\u2018Flat-Earth\u2019\u2019 equations sufficiently describe the mobile manipulator dynamics. Corollary 1 [39]: Description of the dynamic behaviour of a mobile manipulator over a small area of non-rotating Earth is sufficiently exact for the simulation and analysis needs.\nEarth-fixed frame {G} (OXYZ ) from Fig. 1 will be considered as the inertial frame throughout the following analysis. The body-fixed frame {BC} (CxBCyBCzBC) with its origin in the chassis COM is chosen to adopt all the linear/angular body motions.\nThe transformation matrix relating frames {G} and {BC} will be given by the yBC \u2212 xBC \u2212 zBC rotation sequence to align the two considered frames. It is given with (8), as shown at the bottom of the page.\nThe angles 8 and 2 are related to the terrain slope, and angle9 is related to the orientation in the local ground plane, as illustrated in Fig. 1. A rotation matrix that relates the body {BC} and inertial frame of reference {G} enables easy extraction of the angular velocity components in the {BC} frame from the skew-symmetric matrix:(\nBC G \u03c9BC\u00d7\n) =\nBCRG GR\u0307BC , (9)\nwhich is formed per pattern in (6), and where BCG \u03c9BC labels the angular velocity of the chassis with respect to the inertial frame of reference {G}, expressed in the {BC} frame. The angular velocity is obtained by employing (8) in (9) in combination with (6), which provides the following:\nBC G \u03c9BC =  8\u0307 cos9 + 2\u0307 cos8 sin9\u22128\u0307 sin9 + 2\u0307 cos8 cos9 9\u0307 \u2212 2\u0307 sin8  , (10) which is one of the essential factors that is required to be known in the following kinematics and dynamics analysis.\nA simple example motivates the discussion regarding the terrain slope properties. When a wheeled platform is transiting an uneven terrain, strictly speaking, in the general case, each wheel is experiencing different ground slope values and gradients. This traversing introduces an error in the calculations if the local terrain slopes beneath each wheel are not obtained and are not accounted for correctly, as could be done using reconstruction from high-density laser scans [40].\nNot accounting for the terrain properties in detail may not be a significant issue, especially in the case of gentler terrains that possess no ruggedness. Even when the terrain is not locally placid, the introduced error may not be effective for a long time. These considerations also give rise to the idea of modifying the tip-over stability criterion to further emphasise the terrain slope properties.\nGRBC =  cos2 cos9 + sin2 sin8 sin9 cos9 sin2 sin8\u2212 cos2 sin9 cos8 sin2cos8 sin9 cos8 cos9 \u2212sin8 \u2212cos9 sin2+ cos2 sin8 sin9 cos2 cos9 sin8+ sin2 sin9 cos2 cos8  (8) VOLUME 11, 2023 43239\nLet us observe the planar situation from Fig. 2 that suffices to overlook the essential aspects of an uneven terrain motion and illustrate ideas related to the assumptions about to be introduced.\nThe effects of the traversing grade, crest, and dip have been well studied in the field of car dynamics and can be easily extended to the analysis here for the sake of completeness and generality, [41]\u2013[42]. The centrifugal force affects wheel loading, and the differences in road curvature between the front and rear axle result in slightly different directions of normal axle forces. Normal forces with an asterisk subscript N \u2217i , i = 1, 2 denote wheel forces acting in the exact direction,\nwhereas Ni, i = 1, 2 denotes the normal forces acting in the approximately determined direction by knowing the chassis orientation with respect to the Earth-tangent plane. If the geometrical properties of the terrain are assumed to be unknown and are not accounted for, modelling errors are inevitable. Let us consider a set of commonly used assumptions for unknown terrain properties that are acceptable without introducing significant modelling errors. In addition, let us assume that a considered mobile manipulator will traverse an uneven terrain such that it decreases its velocity as the flatness of the terrain reduces. This situation is likely to be valid in practice and ensures that the centrifugal acceleration v2/Rh does not have to be accounted for. Assumption 2: The ratio of a manipulator COM velocity squared v2 and the path curvature radius Rh is close to zero. Corollary 2: The centrifugal acceleration is negligible and does not affect the wheel loads. Not accounting for different directions of normal forces at the front and rear axle will introduce a certain modelling error that can not be avoided if these are not explicitly accounted for. Angles \u03c71 and \u03c72 from Fig. 2 illustrate these sources of the modelling errors. An efficient way to analyse this effect on the modelling error is to perform simulations in sophisticated software packages in which the terrain is given as a cloud of points. As the only possible and commonly used solution in these situations, where these angles are unknown, the following assumption on the terrain is introduced: Assumption 3: All the wheels make contact with the same, locally flat, ground plane. Corollary 3: The supporting forces acting on the manipulator wheels are mutually parallel. Note that angle values 8 and 2 are dominant and influential in the overturning analysis. Angular velocity components\n43240 VOLUME 11, 2023\n8\u0307 and 2\u0307 in (10), on the other hand, are a simple consequence of the geometrical properties of the terrain.\nIf the terrain has mild slope gradients or the manipulator traverses the terrain with low velocity when slope gradients are significant, as already assumed, the contribution of terms 8\u0307 and 2\u0307 in the analysis of the forces can be neglected. Assumption 4: The terrain itself and how the manipulator traverses uneven terrain does not significantly affect the angular velocity components of the chassis. Corollary 4: Angular velocity components 8\u0307 and 2\u0307 are significantly smaller and less influential than the steering angular velocity 9\u0307 and thus can be neglected, causing the following expression to hold approximately:\nBC G \u03c9BC =\n( 0 0 9\u0307 )T . (11)\nEquation (11) follows from (10), based on Assumption 4. Assumptions 1 - 4 provide a basis for formulating the kinematics and dynamics relations. In the following discussion, subscripts FL, FR, RR, and RL will be used very often; these subscripts denote the Front/Rear Left/Right (usually wheel). Let us further consider the 4AWD platform from Fig. 3 which is the same manipulator wheeled platform as in Fig. 1, now shown in more detail, including wheels. The terms chassis and wheeled platform may be used interchangeably.\nThe wheeled platform\u2019s COM is located at point C , which also acts as the origin of the right-handed frame {BC} with its xBC-axis pointing in the longitudinal direction and with the yBC-axis pointing in the lateral direction of the chassis motion. The position of each wheel with respect to the COM is determined with the set of 6 fixed lengths, labelled as l1, l2, and wi, i = FL,FR,RR,RL. Fig. 4 shows a mobile manipulator\u2019s simple oriented graph (SOG). The SOG in Fig. 4 shows that systematic kinematics calculations start from the velocity of the chassis COM and then branch towards wheels and manipulator TCP on the manipulator arm.\nIn the considered case of the platform\u2019s planar motion, as a consequence of Assumption 4, the chassis will presumably have velocity components only in the local levelground plane. Each wheel\u2019s linear velocity can be calculated by knowing the magnitude and direction of the linear velocity of the chassis. Let the vector of the chassis COM linear velocities, with respect to the inertial frame of reference, and expressed as would be measured in the local chassis frame {BC}, be the following:\nBC G vBC = VC cos\u03b2CVC sin\u03b2C 0  = BCvxBCvy 0  , (12) where VC denotes the magnitude of the chassis COM velocity, and \u03b2C denotes the instantaneous velocity angle of the chassis. If the angular velocity of the chassis is determined with (11), then by knowing values for BCvx, BCvy and 9\u0307, the magnitudes of all the wheel-related Vi, i = FL,FR,RR,RL and auxiliary i = F,R velocities can be calculated as [43] follows:\nVFL sin\u03b2FL = VC sin\u03b2C + l2 9\u0307, (13)\nVFL cos\u03b2FL = VC cos\u03b2C \u2212 wFL 9\u0307, (14)\nVFR sin\u03b2FR = VC sin\u03b2C + l2 9\u0307, (15)\nVFR cos\u03b2FR = VC cos\u03b2C + wFR 9\u0307, (16)\nVRR sin\u03b2RR = VC sin\u03b2C \u2212 l1 9\u0307, (17)\nVRR cos\u03b2RR = VC cos\u03b2C + wRR 9\u0307, (18)\nVRL sin\u03b2RL = VC sin\u03b2C \u2212 l1 9\u0307, (19)\nVRL cos\u03b2RL = VC cos\u03b2C \u2212 wRL 9\u0307, (20)\nVF sin\u03b2F = VC sin\u03b2C + l2 9\u0307, (21)\nVF cos\u03b2F = VC cos\u03b2C , (22)\nVR sin\u03b2R = VC sin\u03b2C \u2212 l1 9\u0307, (23)\nVF cos\u03b2R = VC cos\u03b2R, (24)\nwhere the instantaneous velocity direction angles \u03b2i, i = FL, FR, RR, RL, F, R are determined as follows:\n\u03b2FL = arctan VC sin\u03b2C + l2 9\u0307\nVC cos\u03b2C \u2212 wFL 9\u0307 , (25)\n\u03b2FR = arctan VC sin\u03b2C + l2 9\u0307\nVC cos\u03b2C + wFR 9\u0307 , (26)\n\u03b2RR = arctan VC sin\u03b2C \u2212 l1 9\u0307\nVC cos\u03b2C + wRR 9\u0307 , (27)\n\u03b2RL = arctan VC sin\u03b2C \u2212 l1 9\u0307\nVC cos\u03b2C \u2212 wRL 9\u0307 , (28)\n\u03b2F = arctan VC sin\u03b2C + l2 9\u0307\nVC cos\u03b2C , (29)\n\u03b2R = arctan VC sin\u03b2C \u2212 l1 9\u0307\nVC cos\u03b2C . (30)\nBy having all the instantaneous velocity angles \u03b2i, the tyre and auxiliary sideslip angles can be calculated, if the wheel and auxiliary steering angles \u03b4i are known, as follows:\n\u03b1i = \u03b2i \u2212 \u03b4i, i = FL, FR, RR, RL, F, R. (31)\nKinematic relations in a manipulator arm have to be established from case to case, and thus, no general approach can be presented here. However, it is clear that in the formation of a kinematics chain of the manipulator arm, the starting point will be the chassis, with the TCP at the end of the chain.\nVI. 6D VECTOR MOBILE MANIPULATOR DYNAMICS A. WHEEL DYNAMICS The vehicle dynamics are mainly affected by the tyre/road interaction, that is, by forces and moments generated under the tyres. These forces and moments are usually modelled by combining empirical and theoretical approaches. The appropriate planes and frames in which the tyre/road interactions will be expressed and quantified are introduced and are shown in Fig. 5. The wheel-centre plane (wcp) contains a flat disk obtained by narrowing the tyre, whereas the vertical plane (vp) is always normal to the ground plane (gp), [44].\nThe center of the i-th tyre frame {Ti}, i = FL, FR, RR, RL, is at the centre of the tyreprint. The tyreprint is assumed to be at the wheel-centre plane and the ground plane intersection.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 43241\nIt follows the wheel\u2019s orientation, with its zti-axis always in the vertical plane. The wheel frame {Wi} has its origin at the wheel centre, where the COM is also assumed to be located. It will be chosen to move together with the wheel, except the spinning, because this benefits the dynamics analysis.\nAlthough the wheel dynamics analysis benefits from using the non-spinning frame, [45], this does not allow the straightforward use of existing ready-to-use 6D dynamics equations as in the, for example, VDC mainstream form, where it is assumed that each body frame adopts all body motions.\nThe i-th wheel from Fig. 5 has its COM velocity vector laying in the plane parallel to the ground plane, which implies the following:\nTivi = Vi cos\u03b1iVi sin\u03b1i 0  , (32)\nwhich can be expressed in the i-th wheel frame {Wi}, using the sideslip angle \u03b1i and the camber angle \u03b3i as follows:\nWivi =  Vi cos\u03b1iVi sin\u03b1i cos \u03b3i \u2212Vi sin\u03b1i sin \u03b3i  . (33) In (32) and (33), kinematic relations (12) - (31) are to be consulted. The i-th wheel, considered independently from the\n43242 VOLUME 11, 2023\nvehicle, has the \u0307i angular velocity component about the ywi-axis and the \u03b4\u0307i component about the zti-axis. Note that each wheel, considered as a part of a vehicle in the later analysis, will, in addition to these angular velocity components, adopt the angular velocity of the chassis and the term Wi G \u03c9BC quantifies this, which seems to be often neglected or overlooked. Referring to Fig. 5, the angular velocity vector of the i-th wheel can be expressed in the i-th non-spinningwheel frame {Wi} as follows:\nWi\u03c9i =  0\u0307i + \u03b4\u0307i sin \u03b3i \u03b4\u0307i cos \u03b3i +WiG \u03c9BC . (34) As is already mentioned, because for the frame {Wi}, we choose not to adopt the wheel\u2019s spinning motion, quantified by \u0307i, the angular velocity of the i-th wheel frame {Wi} per se is given as follows:\nWi\u03c9Wi =  0\u03b4\u0307i sin \u03b3i \u03b4\u0307i cos \u03b3i +WiG \u03c9BC . (35) The change of linear momentum of the i-th wheel, expressed in the wheel frame {Wi}, can be written as follows:\nmiWi v\u0307i + mi ( Wi\u03c9Wi\u00d7 ) Wivi + miWig = Wi f \u2217i , (36)\nwith mi denoting the mass of the i-th wheel, Wig = ( 0 0 g )T being the gravity acceleration vector, and Wi f \u2217i representing the total force vector acting on the i-th wheel, both expressed as would be measured in the {Wi} frame. The remaining equations required to describe the wheel motion give the angular momentum change as follows:[\nWiI ] Wi \u03c9\u0307i + ( Wi\u03c9Wi\u00d7 ) ([ WiI ] Wi\u03c9i ) = Wim\u2217i , (37)\nwith [WiI] representing the inertia tensor of the i-th wheel about the {Wi} frame axes and Wim\u2217i representing the total external moment vector acting on the i-th wheel, expressed as would be measured in the {Wi} frame. We note that in both (36) and (37), the frame angular velocity exists given per (35), whereas (34) participates only in (37).\nAt this point, the 6D dynamics model can be formed. The translational and rotational i-th wheel dynamics are thus described per (36) and (37). By introducing the 6D linear/angular velocity vectorWiV i per (33) and (34) as follows:\nWiV i = (Wivi Wi\u03c9i ) , (38)\nthe 6D wheel/tyre dynamics equations can be given in the compact form:\nMWi WiV\u0307 i + CWi WiV i +GWi = WiF \u2217 , (39)\nwith matricesMWi , CWi and the vector GWi being: MWi = ( mi I3\u00d73 O3\u00d73 O3\u00d73 [WiI] ) , (40)\nCWi = ( mi (Wi\u03c9Wi\u00d7) O3\u00d73 O3\u00d73 (Wi\u03c9Wi\u00d7) [WiI] ) , (41)\nGWi = ( mi Wig 03\u00d71 ) . (42)\nThe inertia matrix MWi remains symmetric here, as when the body frame adopts all body motions. Notably, matrixCWi is now not anti-symmetric in general.\nB. WHEEL/CHASSIS INTERACTION The next topic requiring attention is the interaction between the wheel and chassis per the modelling modularity property and appending on the wheel/tyre subsystem dynamics analysis. If the aerodynamic forces acting on the wheel itself are neglected, the essential and unavoidable external forces/moments to be accounted for will undoubtedly remain the tyre/road interaction forces/moments TiF, the wheel actuation and joint friction moments WiFa and the wheel/chassis interaction forces/moments Wi\u03b7i.\nBy referring to Fig. 6 for providing graphical insights, the total force acting on each wheel, i.e. the right-hand side of (39), can be written as the following sum:\nWiF \u2217 = \u2212 Wi\u03b7i + WiUTi TiF+WiFa, (43)\nwith i = FL,FR,RR,RL in the case considered here. Once the wheel inertial forces and the forces formed at the tyreprint centre are known, the wheel/chassis interaction force vector Wi\u03b7i, whichwill directly actuate the chassis, can be calculated as follows:\nWi\u03b7i = \u2212 WiF \u2217 + WiUTi TiF+WiFa, (44)\nwith i = FL,FR,RR,RL. Even in the general case with n wheels, each wheel\u2019s dynamics could be given with (39), where the total force acting on each wheel is (43). Beginning the analysis from a manipulator with n wheels and with articulated steering would undoubtedly cause derivations of all the underlying expressions to be filled with numerous terms that could divert attention from the essence.\nC. CHASSIS DYNAMICS We now focus on the chassis of the considered 4AWD vehicle in Fig. 6. The chassis dynamics, in this case, can be easily described, assuming that the frame {BC} adopts all the chassis motions.\nThe total force acting on the chassis is given as follows:\nMBC BCV\u0307 + CBC BCV +GBC = BCF \u2217 , (45)\nwhere the detailed expressions for matrices MBC , CBC and GBC are the same as in [38]. The total force acting on the chassis can be equivalently represented by the following sum:\nBCF \u2217 = BCUBM BMF+ \u2211 i=FL,...,RL BCUWi Wi\u03b7i, (46)\nwhere BMF represents the manipulator base reaction force, and Wi\u03b7 represents the wheel/chassis interaction expressed\nVOLUME 11, 2023 43243\nas would be measured in the {Wi} frame. All the existing tipping-over criteria have been derived assuming that in (44), terms WiF\u2217 and WiFa are equal to zero. While the MHS assumed that the left-hand side of (45) equals zero, the TMO considers only theGBC term, and the ITMOuses the complete left-hand side of (45) as given here.\nVII. WEIGHT TRANSFER TO MANIPULATOR WHEELS In the derivation process of MHS, TOM and ITOM, at this modelling stage, with underlying assumptions being valid, the moments about the axes connecting the supporting polygon vertices have been formed, and no further steps are taken towards the analytical determination of the supporting forces.\nAs a consequence of Assumption 3, the forces supporting the wheel only affect the linear motion in the direction of their action and angular motions about axes in the plane parallel to the level-ground plane, i.e. pitching and rolling angular motion. Consequently, when we have only three equations, the challenge in the process of determining the forces is that there are fewer equations than unknown variables in the case of four or more wheels. Additional reasonable relations for connecting the tyre loads are then introduced to obtain the closed-form system of equations, as in [46], or the solution is found using a matrix pseudoinverse.\nBefore proceeding further, the wheel forces and moments must be addressed since it may simplify the following analysis. When performing dynamics analysis at the wheel level, the wheel\u2019s inertial forces are critical for predicting the wheel\u2019s motion. In contrast, neglecting the wheel\u2019s inertial\nforces could lead to much simpler final expressions without introducing significant modelling errors when calculating the normal loads. Let us take, for example, a moving mobile manipulator which accelerates. If the chassis mass is a few times the mass of the wheels, then its contribution to the inertial forces of the system is dominant. In the case of a manipulator moving at low to zero velocities during the working tasks, even the inertial forces of the chassis are certainly negligible because accelerations of the manipulator arm are the ones having significant velocities and accelerations. These considerations motivate the neglection of the wheel inertial forces for each wheel. If this neglection may not be valid in the particular case, the full-dynamics model presented here extends results to any desired extent.\nAccounting for the weight of wheels will not make the normal force expressions significantly complex and could be a significant factor, especially when big heavy wheels of heavy-duty machines at low velocities are being considered. Assumption 5: Inertial forces of all the wheels are negligible with respect to the chassis inertial forces. Corollary 5: Inertial forces of each wheel and all wheel actuation torques are neglected, leaving only the respective wheel weights to be considered when calculating normal loads. In the normal load analysis, the wheel/chassis interaction force will have the following form:\nWi\u03b7i = \u2212GWi + WiUTi TiF, (47)\nwith TiF = ( Ti fx Ti fy Ti fz 0 0 0 )T .\n43244 VOLUME 11, 2023\nTo avoid more complicated notations in the following expressions, additional reasonable assumptions on the wheels, which are commonly understood in such analyses, are applied here. If some of these may not hold in a specific case, a more general result can be obtained following the presented procedure. Here, it is assumed that: Assumption 6: All the wheels are nominally equal, having zero camber angles, same masses, same radii, and same lateral distances from the chassis COM. Corollary 6: All the wheel distances from the chassis wi, wheel masses mwi and wheel radii Rwi have equal values, which are labelled as w, mw and Rw, respectively, with camber angles \u03b3i = 0, where i = FL,FR,RR,RL. The three equations of motion in which normal loads participate follow from a combination of (45) and (46), and these are (48)\u2013(50), as shown at the bottom of the page. Combining themwith (51) and (52), as shown at the bottom of the page, provides three equations with four unknown normal loads TFL fz, TFR fz, TRR fz, TRL fz. Auxiliary vectors used in (48) \u2013 (52) are xf = ( 1 0 0 0 0 0\n)T , yf = (0 1 0 0 0 0)T , zf = ( 0 0 1 0 0 0\n)T , x\u03c4 = (0 0 0 1 0 0)T , y\u03c4 =( 0 0 0 0 1 0\n)T . Before presenting the main result, it is vital to address how the base frame of the manipulator arm is oriented to the frame {BC} at the chassis COM. The mutual orientation of these frames will, of course, affect the final expressions for the normal wheel loads. In the general case, this orientation\ncan be any, and if it were to be accounted for directly, many additional terms in final expressions coming from the rotation matrix coefficients would appear. For the sake of analysis clarity, it is convenient to have both the manipulator arm base{ B\u2032M } frame, which adopts all the manipulator base motions,\nand frame {BM} with the same origin as { B\u2032M } , but with the same orientation as {BC}, per Fig. 6. By doing so, the generality of the model is retained while ready-to-use expressions for normal loads are derived and presented as simply as possible. The considerations above that are introduced simply for the convenience of presentation lead to the assumption: Assumption 7: Frame {BM} at the connection of the manipulator arm base and the chassis has the same orientation as that of frame {BC} at the chassis COM. Corollary 7: The rotation matrix from frame {BC} to the frame {BM} is an identity matrix BMRBC = I3\u00d73. The main implication of Assumption 7 is that an inevitable and insignificant burden is placed on the end-user to calculate BMF before using the main results. If the equations derived below are to be used directly, one must transform the forces/moments from frame { B\u2032M } to frame {BM} as:\nBMF = BMUB\u2032M B\u2032MF.

If the solution obtained using the pseudoinversion is to be avoided, a unique solution for the supporting forces can be obtained by introducing a suspension-related assumption. It connects the normal load differences on the front and rear axle. Following the vehicle dynamics modelling principles, we introduce Assumption 8 [46]: The lateral load difference across the front axle is some fraction of the total lateral load difference. Corollary 8: The following equation is recognized:\nTFR fz \u2212 TFL fz = D ( TFR fz + TRR fz \u2212 TFL fz \u2212 TRL fz ) , (54)\nwith D \u2208 [0, 1].

The vector BMF is assumed to have the following structure:\nBMF = \nBM fx BM fy BM fz BMmx BMmy BMmz\n , (59)\nand thus the used notation in (56)\u2013(58). Further, the position vector of frame {BM} with respect to frame {BC}, expressed in the {BC} frame is as follows:\nBC BC rBM = xCAyCA zCA  , (60) and the components of this vector account explicitly for the placement of the manipulator arm base and how this placement affects the supporting forces.\nThe chassis tensor of inertia can be assumed to have a general form with no zero elements, where the chassis moments\nof inertia about the {BC} frame axes are denoted by BC Iij = BC Iji, i, j = x, y, z, and participate in (56)\u2013(58). In addition to the moments of inertia, the wheeled-platform mass has to be considered, and it is denoted by mBC. The chassis COM height above the ground, a known contributing term, is labelled as zC and is also sketched in Fig. 6.\nThe lengths l1 and l2 have been already introduced in Fig. 3 and are addressed in SectionV. They represent distances from the chassis COM to the rear and front axle, respectively.\nFinally, terms rij, where i, j = 1, 2, 3 are the ij-th coefficients of the transformation matrix (8), and it is these terms that account for the slope angles and thus for the chassis orientation with respect to the Earth-tangent plane.\nBy solving the system of equations (55), compact expressions for each tyre\u2019s supporting force can be obtained in the form of the following neat sums with eleven terms in each:\nTFL fz = 11\u2211 i=1 \u03b6FL,i, (61) TFR fz = 11\u2211 i=1 \u03b6FR,i, (62) TRR fz = 11\u2211 i=1 \u03b6RR,i, (63) TRL fz = 11\u2211 i=1 \u03b6RL,i. (64)\nAnalytic expressions for all the contributing terms in (61)\u2013(64) are given by (65)\u2013(108), [(65)\u2013(68), as shown at the bottom of the next page]. Each term can be considered static if its contribution exists irrespective of the motion of the chassis or manipulator arm. Magnitudes of static terms are affected by the system masses, slope angles, manipulator arm posture, and the position of the connection point between the manipulator and the chassis. How the chassis and wheel weight forces contribute to the supporting forces is quantified with (65) \u2013 (68). In this case, slope angles are important contributors, together with the COM height. Stato-dynamic terms (69) \u2013 (88) describe how the manipulator arm affects the normal loads. The location of the arm connection point with the chassis (60) plays an integral role in these terms.

SIMULATION RESULTS A. VALIDATING THE PROPOSED EXPRESSIONS The presented derivation procedure and, consequently, the solutions for normal wheel loads have been based on the basic principles of rigid body dynamics with several reasonable assumptions introduced in the derivation process. As an external independent means for a self check-up, the Simscape MultibodyTM simulation will be used here to advocate the justifiability of the proposed modelling scheme and provide insights into how the introduced assumptions affect the final solution when they are not entirely valid. A 4AWD mobile manipulator in the simulation environment can be freely chosen because the equations are not tailored to any specific chassis shape or manipulator arm and their properties.\nNotably, there exists a temporary inability to provide referent normal force values on an uneven, complex geometry terrain in the software used. State-of-the-art methods used to simulate a motion over an uneven terrain use clouds of points. Each contact force is based on the penetration and velocity of the individual point of the cloud. The Spatial Contact Force block does not support sensing when connected to a point cloud block, [47]. This fact has forced simulations here to be performed on a flat surface for the sake of providing an unbiased self-check comparison. Even these will suffice to highlight the benefits of monitoring wheel loads instead of tipping-over moments about pre-defined axes. In the case of uneven terrain, the argumentation brought out during the derivation process provides a firm basis regarding the temporary absence of unbiased self-check means. When the motion of a mobile manipulator is simulated over a flat surface, a spring-damper model for the soil can be used while ignoring the terrain geometry, as suggested and implemented in [48].\nThus, the reference values for the result comparisons and proof-of-concept purposes can be obtained relatively easy.\nFlat-surface simulations are, in any case, significant when testing both static and dynamic terms at the same time. It is also expected that in the case of large angular velocities, more significant discrepancies between the referent results and the analytic ones will occur due to the introduced assumptions that neglect the wheel dynamics. These cases can be realistically simulated only on flat terrain. On uneven terrain, static terms will usually prevail because the manipulator will not have high linear/angular velocities in those cases.\nThe heavy-dutymobile manipulator shown in Fig. 7 will be used in the simulation. Themanipulator armwill intentionally perform motions with significant angular accelerations to create BMF components of a considerable magnitude. The simulation may exaggerate a situation that is likely to occur in practice but simultaneously tests the static and dynamic factors for a wider spectre of affecting values. All mass-related and other relevant physical properties of the manipulator arm can be found in [49], together with the detailed description of the calculation procedures for the forces. The other relevant simulation parameters are listed in Table 1. The manipulator arm has also been intentionally oriented towards the front left wheel such that the rear right wheel is in the greatest danger of losing ground contact. This occurrence is one of those that are not likely to be detected using the\n43248 VOLUME 11, 2023\nexisting indicators, and thus, it is of primary interest here to reveal how the proposed approach prevails the ITOM and its predecessors.\nLinear/angular chassis velocities in the simulated case are shown in Fig. 8. Forces/moments generated at the manipulator arm/chassis connection BMF are shown in Fig. 9. Initially, these forces and moments are mainly caused by the motion of the manipulator arm and have been magnified by abrupt steering actions that are purposedly introduced to test the contribution of the angular velocity.\nValues of the supporting forces calculated using the proposed approach, using (61) \u2013 (64) are shown in Fig. 10, along with the corresponding errors, and these results are significant from two viewpoints.\nFirst, they show an excellent agreement between the simulation and analytic results. This fact proves the efficacy of the proposed extendable model with valid underlying assumptions. The proposed equations qualify as a good starting point for calculating the supporting forces considering the obtained matching with the Simscape MultibodyTM results. Although the discrepancies between the analytic and simulation results depend on more than introduced assumptions, such as on the solver choice, integration time, and soil model, for the investigated manoeuvre, the maximum absolute error is negligible at first, with a maximum value of approximately 130N as the motion becomes sharp, which is arguably more than acceptable considering the magnitudes of forces. The end-user can investigate the dissimilarities from the referent results and decide if a more complex model is required. In the absence of referent simulation or experimental results, the given methodology can be adopted in all the practical situations involving the considered class of mobile manipulators.\nB. STABILITY CRITERIA IMPROVEMENTS From the second standpoint, improvement with respect to the ITOM is noticeable. Namely, by observing the values for TRR fz, we can see that the rear right wheel loses contact with the surface at the point in time when the simulation\nVOLUME 11, 2023 43249\nends. The convention in the ITOM tip-over stability indicator is such that the negative values imply the tip-over stability.\nThe transition from the negative to positive ITOM values can occur only when the two wheels lose contact with the ground.\n43250 VOLUME 11, 2023\nAs shown in Fig. 11, although a positive gradient in some may exist, the highest ITOM indicator value is far below zero, indicating strong tip-over stability when the rear right wheel loses contact with the ground.\nMonitoring the supporting forces per the suggested equations is intuitive and proved to be a better choice than monitoring the tipping-over moments about particular axes, no matter how detailed the underlying dynamics model is. The overturning force (OTF) stability measure emerges smoothly from the ongoing discussion as a simple alternative to ITOM. In contrast to the established procedures of comparing tipping-over moments, a comparison of the overturning forces with the prescribed stability margins is proposed. The overturning force is simply a wheel supporting force, which is given as follows:\nOTFi = Ti fz, (109)\nwhere i = FL,FR,RR,RL. For a reasonably chosen optimal margins OTFi,opt, one can now similarly write:\nOTFi = OTFi,opt +1OTFi. (110)\nThe tip-over avoidance function from [22] can be easily swapped with the following:\n\u03c3 = 1 2 \u2211 i ||1OTFi||22 , (111)\ni = FL,FR,RR,RL. This introduces the benefit of having analytically partial derivatives \u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03be which are used in the\ntip-over avoidance scheme which has already been proven to work, with \u03be = ( BCvx BCvy 9\u0307 )T . In light of the performed analysis, it is also more relevant to choose a OTFi,max margin.\nC. PARAMETRIC UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS Because the presented study dominantly focusses on mathematical modelling and formulation of the wheel supporting forces, the implication of change in various parameters must be considered. An analysis like this can also be helpful to simultaneously test the exactness of the proposed expressions in a separate uncorrelated manoeuvre. In the parametric uncertainty analysis, the mobile manipulator will move forward until it stops and will then resume its motion in reverse when the steering action is also applied. The manipulator arm\u2019s orientation is kept the same as in the previous example. The manipulator velocities during this manoeuvre are shown in Fig. 12. All the relevant parameters are randomly varied in the range\u00b110% of their nominal values; these parameters are the lengths, angles, masses, and moments of inertia. Again, joint motions in the manipulator arm have been commanded using a set of uncorrelated sinusoidal changes with significant gradients.\nFig. 13 shows the shaded area between the largest and smallest error for forces/moments BM fx , BM fy, BM fz, BMmx , BMmy, BMmz at the manipulator arm base and Fig. 14 does the same for all the wheel supporting forces TFL fz, TFR fz, TRR fz, TRL fz.\nEach force/moment error is defined as the difference between the force/moment value obtained using unexact relevant parameters, and the exact value provided by SimscapeTM. Fig. 13 indicates that, as expected, when discussing the manipulator arm base forces, parametric uncertainties mainly affect the force normal to the chassis and overturning moments. The reasons are comprehensible since the manipulator arm weighs approximately 1000 kg, and a 10% error in the manipulator arm mass introduces an error of approximately 1 kN that can only be increased in the considered test conditions with significant accelerations of arm links. The manipulator arm creates overturning moments, which can be erroneously calculated if the manipulator masses are not known precisely along with moment arms. Illustrating this in numbers, a 50 kg error in mass at the moment arm of 2 m introduces an error of approximately 1 kNm. Again, because all the possible manipulator parameters were varied and accelerations were significant, the error had understandable magnitudes. It is also noticeable that the moment error about the axis parallel to the chassis rotation axis eventually increases when the chassis angular velocity grows. Examining each of the 11 relevant terms one by one makes it clear how these errors are distributed to the supporting force errors. Further, the eventual 10% chassis mass error in the considered example indicates that an error of 2 kN is introduced and is distributed partially to each wheel. Thus, the magnitudes of the errors shown in Fig. 14 can be justified.\nWhat makes the presented parametric uncertainty analysis interesting is to show that, as expected, the magnitudes of the errors for the FL and RR wheels are large. Differences in the error ranges are expected considering that the orientation of the manipulator arm is again as shown in Fig. 7. It is\nVOLUME 11, 2023 43251\nvalid to conclude that when accounting for some error safety margin, limiting cases with largest errors should be found from the predicted workspace. This error margin should be included as fixed or adaptively in the overturning stability\ncriterion. It could make the criterion more conservative, but we must try to avoid cases in which the prescribed force limit is undetectably reached in the presence of parametric uncertainties.\n43252 VOLUME 11, 2023\nIn the sketchy mobile manipulator considered in the present study, the chassis mass and its COM position, along with the manipulator arm position and orientation, are chosen such that the extreme case of losing the terrain contact can be investigated relatively easily. Such a simulation setting and tracing zero supporting forces are very convenient for proof-of-concept purposes when discussing the magnitudes of normal forces and the benefits of monitoring these in contrast to overturning moments.\nThe sensitivity of the overturn danger anticipation and overturn preventing algorithms to parametric uncertainty on an uneven terrain would require a completely separate analysis considering the required amount of work. It would also be convenient to conduct it with a realistic wheeled platform design where the supporting forces are better balanced between wheels in the nominal working posture. In addition, sensor nonidealities, sensor data fusion and other related topics, together with their effect, should be investigated.\nAll the simulations were run on a machine with Intel R\u00a9\nCore TM\ni5-10310U CPU @1.70 GHz and 16.0 GB RAM in MATLAB R\u00a9 2021b for academic use.\nIX. DISCUSSION When simulating the motion of different mobile manipulator configurations over flat or uneven terrain, some spring-damper soil models are known to provide reliable results for normal forces. These contact models are widely accepted in the robotics community. A wide range of studies for various steering configurations is available with remarkable dynamics models but with expressions for normal forces relying on the tyre-soil contact dynamics. If these values for normal wheel forces are to be used inside the simulation environment, most often, for modelling the other tyre force/moments, no objection can be made about them. In practice, multiple benefits could be obtained if the supporting forces were monitored during the operation. One significant improvement addressed here in detail could be the better assessment of the overturning stability. The performance of the mobile manipulator could additionally benefit from performing additional on-line calculations where the wheel supporting forces participate. Direct measurement of the supporting forces usually falls out of the scope because the force sensors are expensive and unresistant to shocks, which must be especially considered with heavy-duty working machines. In these cases, the tyre-soil contact models may also be an unreliable and impractical choice. The first reason is that the tyre/spring deformations may be difficult/expensive to measure considering the nature of the quantities and the range of the expected measured values. The other reason is that the tyre/spring stiffnesses must be known perfectly, and the solution becomes very sensitive to changes in this parameter since all the results largely depend on it. Expressing the normal wheel forces in terms of quantities that are likely to be measured with much higher accuracy during the mobile manipulator operation, like linear/angular velocities and accelerations, is much more reasonable. Combining\non-line measurable quantities with other physical quantities, whose values are likely to be known in advance with a relatively high degree of accuracy, is the primary goal that the research community must set and prioritize. The present study gives a solution like this for a class of 4-wheeled mobile manipulators with rigid chassis. Ready-to-use analytic results like this for supporting wheel forces in 4-wheeled mobile manipulators with rigid chassis cannot be found in the existing literature on mobile manipulator dynamics. Although the opposite case may be argued, obtaining these expressions does not pose a significant challenge if the line of thought commonly employed in vehicle dynamics is followed. After the careful formulation of subsystem-by-subsystem dynamics, using the compact 6D vector form, which explicitly includes the ground reaction forces, an appropriate system of equations with tyre loads as unknowns can be formed. The EOMs in which normal loads participate are initially hard to handle and provide highly impractical solutions. An elegant, easy-to-solve system is obtained by carefully combining these with the remaining EOMs. With reasonable assumptions, the solution for each normal force is a neat sum of 11 terms that accurately captures the normal load changes. This sum can be potentially simplified further or made even more complex from case to case if required. It is highly likely that the wheel dynamics will be neglected and that, consequently, the given compact sums that approximate the exact solutions can be readily used because these do not depend on the steering principles. Even if it is determined that wheel dynamics must be included in the calculation of normal forces, the proposed approach leads to the most general solution possible, which is significantly more complex.\nAn independent comparison of the obtained analytical results with the results obtained using Simscape MultibodyTM for one random wheeled platform with a heavy-duty serial-parallel manipulator on top verifies the adequacy of the proposed equations. It must be emphasised that the normal forces in the simulation have been modelled using the spring-damper model. Result comparison proves that the same results can be obtained using these two different approaches where the one using equations derived here is more likely to be the one chosen for practical applications.\nAs the extremely important field of application for these expressions, the community must consider overturning stability and prevention analyses.\nIn contrast to the existing tipping-over stability criteria, from now on, normal loads can be relatively easily imported to tip-over stability analysis. This new opportunity of inclusion offers significant effectivity. The assumptions on the tipping-over axis can be removed finally. A simple consequence is that all the possible underlying causes of overturning (in)stability are comprehended when working in terms of forces. Furthermore, it is intuitively clear that prescribing relative stability margins in terms of forces is more accessible and straightforward than overturning moments about different axes, which brings the derived results close to the broader audience of readers and end-users.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 43253\nX. CONCLUSION Expressions for normal wheel loads based on the tyre-soil contact dynamics are a proven modelling choice for simulation purposes of wheeled platforms such as cars and mobile manipulators. For on-line monitoring of tyre supporting forces, these are likely to be hardly applicable or inapplicable. This fact did not raise much concern in the community of mobile manipulators, especially when considering 4- or more-wheeled configurations. Instead of monitoring normal wheel forces when assessing the manipulator overturning stability, overturning moments about the fixed axes were more commonly considered, and stability criteria were built upon these. Such an approach relies on the action and reaction principle where moments made by the wheel supporting forces about axes connecting wheels can be calculated, but particular values for each of them are not obtainable. The present study showed, using an example of a 4-wheeled rigid-chassis mobile manipulator, how monitoring the normal forces provides significant benefits and in certain situations anticipates the overturning danger much better than the methods based on the overturning moments. In light of this, it is clear that reformulations of expressions for normal wheel loads in terms of linear/angular velocities along with reliable geometric and mass quantities are highly desirable.\nWe show how specific car dynamics modelling approaches can be systematically extended to one class of mobile manipulators. It can also be expected that many more will follow for different configurations not addressed here, following the same line of thought.\nWith the closed gap between the car dynamics and mobile manipulators for the analytical determination of the wheel supporting forces, new tipping-over criteria and tipping-over avoidance schemes can be formed.\nModifiable analytic expressions like the ones presented here seem to be a logical continuation of ongoing efforts in the research community and should represent the first step in modifying the overturning stability criteria, naturally, in terms of normal wheel loads.\nThe present study also calls for the detailed analysis of uneven terrain because it is known to introduce certain modelling errors and has not received enough attention over the years. With the discussion of an uneven terrain effect in more detail, we suggest investigating tipping-over stability indicators, which also emphasise the terrain configuration since these may present an exciting and significant improvement to the existing ones.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors express their gratitude to Dr. Janne Koivum\u00e4ki and Lionel Hulttinen for providing positive criticism and constructive feedback for improving the content of the article and the material presentation.
