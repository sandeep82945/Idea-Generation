    "abstractText": "Two studies aimed to examine cultural differences in social support provision, with or without solicitation, in Japan and the United States (US). In Study 1, we replicated a previous study with Japanese university students. We found that the Japanese participants did not provide social support when it was not solicited, as compared with when it was solicited. Furthermore, in Study 2, participants were asked to respond to a questionnaire regarding a hypothetical stressful situation experienced by a close other and to indicate their willingness to provide support. We confirmed our hypothesis that Japanese participants hesitate to provide unsolicited support to close others (such as family members or close friends), even when they recognize that the close others are in need, whereas the American participants do not hesitate to provide such support. Contrastingly, regarding solicited support, the Japanese and Americans were equally ready to provide support, as hypothesized. The cultural difference in social support resides in the provision of unsolicited support. These results suggest that differences in culturally appropriate responses to needy people are responsible for the difference in the provision of unsolicited vs. solicited social support.",

The term \u201csocial support\u201d has long been attracting attention in social psychology to refer to this kind of everyday personal help. Social support is defined as a form of support that leads the individual to believe that they are cared for, loved, esteemed, and a member of a network of mutual obligations (Cobb, 1976). A central and traditional topic in social psychology on social support is the study of the stressbuffering effect that social support provides (e.g., Cohen and Wills, 1985). In the 1990s, cultural psychologists began to argue that there could be\u00a0cultural differences in social support.

One possibility is that the sense of \u201crelational concern\u201d (Taylor et\u00a0al., 2004; Kim et\u00a0al., 2006) is more pronounced among East Asians, that is, they tend to be\u00a0reluctant to seek social support to cope with their difficulties and stresses because they are concerned that their accruing potentially negative reputation could burden their group harmony (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2006). This standard interpretation by cultural psychologists is well-taken in the field. In the present study, we\u00a0 extend the implications of relational concern to support providers\u2019 psychological mechanisms. As a matter of course, social support is an act of mutuality between the support-provider and the supportrecipient. However, previous studies on social support, focusing on relational concern, has been slanted toward the supportrecipient\u2019s perspective.\nChen et\u00a0al. (2012) exceptionally focused on support providers\u2019 motivations. Based on their findings, they suggested that support provision in Western European countries is generally intended to enhance the support recipient\u2019s self-esteem, whereas, in East Asian countries, support provision is intended to achieve closeness with the support recipient. They further suggested that these cultural differences in social support provision reflect differences of self-construals (Markus and Kitayama, 1991). Those with interdependent self-construals, in which the self is formed by establishing harmonious relationships, may consider the intimacy of those relationships when offering social support to others. It is conceivable that those who hold this interdependent selfconstrual, in which the self is formed by establishing harmonious relationships, would consider the intimacy of those relationships when offering social support to others.\nConsidered together, Taylor et al.\u2019s (2004) and Chen et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2012) findings suggest that East Asians take interpersonal relations into consideration, such that their support does not disrupt interpersonal harmony with the support recipient. Taylor et\u00a0 al.\u2019s (2004) study reports that people in East Asian cultures hesitate to seek social support because they are concerned about bringing their personal problems to other\u2019s attention. Asian support providers are motivated to provide their support to achieve closeness with the person in need (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012). Then, how does relational concern lead East Asians to behave in relation to the interactions between people in need and potential support providers? To answer this question, a \u201ccultural game player\u201d perspective would be\u00a0 useful (Hashimoto et\u00a0 al., 2011; Hashimoto, 2019). According to this perspective, culturally unique behaviors represent adaptive strategies rather than simple expressions of personal psychological mechanisms. These behaviors are often tailored to enable players to succeed in socially adaptive tasks and thereby obtain valuable resources from others. Regarding the provision of social support in a culture with relational concern (Taylor et\u00a0 al., 2004; Kim et\u00a0 al., 2006),\nwe\u00a0assumed that in East Asian countries, social support would be\u00a0 less likely to be\u00a0 sought and consequently, more likely to be\u00a0provided hesitantly, unless it was solicited explicitly. This is because potential support providers would anticipate the possibility that people in need are not necessarily eager to be\u00a0helped owing to their relational concern and thus, offering support may have an adverse effect on their psychological wellbeing. It is possible that for those people social support is embarrassing and thus, they may respond to the support provider negatively. This way, the psychological mechanism of relational concern matters not only for support recipients, but also for potential support providers.\nIn summary, we\u00a0hypothesized that potential support providers in East Asian countries would be\u00a0hesitant and less likely to provide social support when it is not solicited, because they expect an unpleasant response from the support recipients in such situation. This reasoning, based on the cultural game player perspective, differs from Chen et\u00a0al. (2012), who did not take into consideration an inhibitive factor in social support provision caused by relational concern. In other words, solicitation is assumed to play an important role in the provision of social support in East Asia, where people hesitate to provide support unless explicitly solicited. To examine our hypothesis, we\u00a0adopted a method used by Chen et\u00a0al. (2012), which assumes a certain level of support provision, and examined the relation between solicitation and provision of support. Additionally, Chen et\u00a0 al. (2012) listed motivation to closeness and to restore the self-esteem of the distressed person as major motivations for providing social support. We\u00a0expected that the importance of interpersonal relationships would motivate one to restore the psychological well-being of a person in distress. A possible operation of this motivation was examined in Study 1 by adding additional question items. Furthermore, in Study 2, we\u00a0examined the differences between Japan and the U.S. in the effect of solicitation using the hypothetical scenario method.\nStudy 1: Solicitation and provision of support in Japan"

The questionnaire asked participants to retrospect on the last 3 months, and to recall and describe a highly stressful recent event experienced by a close other (a friend or family member). Then participants were asked, \u201cDid you\u00a0 actually support someone close to you\u00a0 who was experiencing a highly stressful event?\u201d After they described the event, they were also asked to indicate the extent to which three types of motivation behind their social support provision were applicable. Two of the three types of motivation scales were used by Chen et\u00a0al. (2012): motivation for closeness, measured with three items (such as \u201cI wanted my close other to feel close to me\u201d) and motivation for self-esteem, measured with three items (such as \u201cI wanted my close other to have high selfesteem\u201d). These two types of motivation are consistent with the discussion of cultural self-construals (e.g., Markus and Kitayama, 1991) and worthy of consideration. However, it should be\u00a0noted that the mean values for Japanese participants on the scale measuring the two types of motivation are below the midpoint in Chen et\u00a0al. (2012). This result suggests that these two types of motivation may not be\u00a0dominant motives underlying the provision of support in Japanese participants. In Study 1, therefore, we\u00a0added three new questions. First, in terms of motivation for social support, we\u00a0 created and added the motivation for restoration of well-being (such as \u201cI wanted my close other to live a happy life like they did before\u201d). Here, we\u00a0expected the observed tendency for Japanese participants to score lower on the motivation for closeness and motivation for self-esteem to be\u00a0 due to the limited focus, and assumed by focusing on restoring a more general well-being the motivation for support could be\u00a0accessed. Second, we\u00a0added a new item related to hesitation in providing support (specifically, \u201cI thought it was better not to provide support unless my close other explicitly asked me for help\u201d) to the questionnaire so that we\u00a0could examine inhibitors as well as facilitators for support provision (hesitation). Here, we\u00a0 expected that Japanese participants would tend to be\u00a0hesitant about providing social support unless it was solicited by the person in need. Third, we\u00a0also included a questionnaire item asking whether they were explicitly solicited to provide social-support by the close other in the event they recalled. Based on our hypothesis, we\u00a0expected that participants would tend to not provide support unless it was solicited.\nAs shown in the Results section, we\u00a0used the chi-square test to assess the relationship between the presence or absence of solicitation and the social support provision to examine our hypothesis. Furthermore, as an exploratory analysis, we\u00a0 also\nthey provided support. Additionally, the Japanese participants in Study 2,\nwho participated in a different study, were asked to complete the present\nstudy\u2019s questionnaire as an additional questionnaire. The findings of the\nother study have already been published.\ndivided the groups after we\u00a0checked the participants\u2019 response to whether they provided support or not and whether they were asked to support or not, and compared the scores regarding motivation scales between these groups by using t-tests and ANOVAs.

As can be\u00a0seen, the Japanese participants did not provide support when it was unsolicited as compared with when it was solicited (Chi-square test: \u03c72(1) = 11.27, p < 0.001), indicating that the presence or absence of solicitation for support has a significant effect on Japanese people\u2019s provision of support, even when they are aware that their close other is distressed.2 This result provides a clear support for our hypothesis. In addition, our exploratory analysis demonstrated that those who did not provide support were more hesitant (M = 4.18) as compared with those who provided support (M = 3.27, t-test: t (173) = 3.52, p < 0.001).3 Furthermore, among those who reported that they were not explicitly asked to provide social support by their close others, there was a significant difference in hesitation between support providers (M = 3.29) and non-providers (M = 4.21; t (125) = 3.24, p = 0.002), which supports our hypothesis as well.4\nThe findings in Study 1 provide a coherent picture of social support provision in Japan. Japanese people are highly influenced by the presence or absence of support solicitation from the recipients when they make a decision to provide personal support to distressed people. However, in Study 1, participants were just asked to freely recall situations in which a close other was in a stressful situation. Thus, there remains a possibility that these situations differed among the participants. In Study 2, we\u00a0controlled for such differences by using a scenario method. In addition, Study 2 examined if Japanese participants would attempt to take care of close other\u2019s psychological well-being based on their nuanced social interactions, to the extent that they would\n2 Considering the unbalanced sample size regarding the participants\u2019 gender,\nwe\u00a0performed a log-linear analysis with gender and solicitation as independent\nvariables, but gender did not show a significant main effect (\u03c72(1) = 0.14, n.s.)\nand a significant interaction effect of these (\u03c72(1) = 0.88, n.s.): there was only\na significant main effect of solicitation (\u03c72(1) = 8.56, p < 0.01). 3 The mean differences between these two groups of people were found\nin motivation for restoration of well-being (t (173) = 2.76, p = 0.006), whereas\nno significant difference was found in motivation for self-esteem (t\n(173) = 2.20, p = 0.029) and motivation for closeness (t (173) = 0.15, p = 0.877).\nNote that the t-tests here are set at the significance level of 0.0125, which\nis equal to 0.05/4.\n4 For more detailed descriptive statistics, including other scales, see the\nSupplementary Table S1.

Previous studies (Taylor et\u00a0al., 2004; Kim et\u00a0al., 2008) have found that Japanese people hesitate to solicit support, a tendency that was also confirmed by Study 1. The participants in Study 1 (72.6%; 127/175) tended to report that they were not explicitly asked for social support by their close others. This result can be\u00a0interpreted as an observation that solicitation of social support is uncommon among Japanese people, even among those who are close to each other. People in distress may hesitate to solicit support and consider it embarrassing to do so; however, one cannot restore psychological well-being when support is not solicited. If Japanese people take such psychological interactions into consideration as the cultural game player perspective suggests, the findings in Study 1 would not be\u00a0 replicated in the U.S. Study 2 examined cultural differences in response to the presence/absence of solicitation for support by controlling the situation using a scenario method.

In the following questions, we\u00a0will ask about such stressful events in daily life. Participants were then asked to imagine the following situation: Recently, your close other experienced a very stressful event. After reading this statement, participants were asked the following questions and then asked to respond with one of four responses: \u201cIf your close other experienced a very stressful event, would you\u00a0support him/her?

The questionnaire further asked participants whether they would provide support in situations where there was clear support solicitation from a close other and in situations where there was not.

That is, less than half of Japanese participants (33.05%) answered that they would offer support, whereas most American participants (88.5%) answered that they would offer support (Chi-square test: \u03c72(1) = 44.33, p < 0.001),5 providing a clear and strong support to our hypothesis. This difference disappeared in the solicited condition (\u03c72(1) = 0.01, n.s.), in which most participants from both cultures answered they would offer support. In the no-information condition, contrastingly, there was a smaller but significant difference, such that 88.1% of Japanese participants and all American participants returned a positive answer (\u03c72(1) = 6.72, p = 0.009).6 Some Japanese participants in this condition may well have assumed that the distressed person was not soliciting support.\nThe motivations underlying support provision were found to vary with culture. Table\u00a01 shows the descriptive statistics of three measures of motivation and a measure of hesitation along with their reliability in each country. As can be\u00a0seen, the restoration of psychological well-being is most stressed among Japanese\n5 Due to the distributional skewness of our data, the same analysis\npresented in footnote 2 could only be\u00a0performed under the unsolicited\ncondition, but as in Study 1, gender did not show a significant main effect\n(\u03c72(1) = 0.49, n.s.) and interaction effects of these (\u03c72(1) = 0.09, n.s.), there\nwas only a significant main effect of culture (\u03c72(1) = 7.42, p < 0.001).

This result suggests that Japanese people are more concerned with the distressed person\u2019s psychological state than with simply providing support to remove the tangible burden of the distressed person. It is possible that Japanese people like to confirm that their support will not embarrass the recipient. In line with this reasoning, Japanese participants hesitated to provide support to a greater extent than their American counterparts (M = 4.57 vs. 2.58, t (167) = 7.59, p < 0.001)."

            "text": "The findings in Studies 1 and 2 provide a coherent picture of social support provision among Japanese people in comparison to American people. Japanese support providers are involved in a more nuanced psychological interaction with the potential recipient of social support. Apparently, Japanese people are eager to know in advance if their support will be\u00a0 welcomed by the potential recipient, as they tend to be\u00a0motivated to restore the psychological well-being of the distressed other and they know there are people who do not wish to solicit support (to avoid disruption of interpersonal relationships). As a result, Japanese people hesitate to provide social support when it is not solicited by the distressed person, even when they are close to the person. This mental process is not found in the American culture, where people do not have rigid social norms (Gelfand et\u00a0al., 2011) and are less worried about disrupting interpersonal relationships by receiving social support.\nA psychological mechanism of hesitation in seeking and receiving social support has been shown in previous cultural psychological studies (e.g., Taylor et\u00a0al., 2004; Kim et\u00a0al., 2008; Mojaverian and Kim, 2013; Ishii et\u00a0al., 2017). In the present study, we\u00a0attempted to extend the psychological mechanism from the support recipient\u2019s perspective to the provider\u2019s\nFIGURE\u00a02 Provision rate of solicited and unsolicited social support among Japanese and American participants.\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nperspective. Interestingly, the data from the present study demonstrate that providing and seeking social support among Japanese participants is more nuanced than it has been thought in previous studies. Distressed people are hesitant to seek support because they fear a potentially negative evaluation from the support provider. Similarly, the provider also expects a potentially negative evaluation from the support recipient and thus hesitates to provide support. This is consistent with the findings of Niiya et\u00a0al. (2022), who also examined the provision of social support among Japanese people and found that it is highly dependent on the assessment of the needs of others. One could assume from these results that the \u201crejection avoidance\u201d on both sides makes it difficult to support each other (Hashimoto and Yamagishi, 2013, 2016). Yamagishi and colleagues have argued that in long-term and \u201cclosed\u201d relationships, where acceptance of needed resources from closely related providers is the primary condition for survival, being sensitive to these resource providers\u2019 feelings and avoiding their rejection is an adaptive strategy (Yamagishi et\u00a0al., 2008, 2012; Yamagishi and Hashimoto, 2016). In this sense, it is plausible that Japanese participants are less likely to seek and provide social support due to mutual avoidance of rejection. Obviously, this line of interpretation needs to be\u00a0 examined in a future study, by addressing important questions such as of \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d Japanese people provide their support according to the situation.\nSeveral issues remain to be\u00a0addressed in future research. First, because both Studies 1 and 2 measured only the verbal responses of the participants, future studies could examine people\u2019s real social support in an experimental setting. Second, although the current study focused on the presence or absence of solicitation in discouraging social support provision, other potential factors need to be\u00a0 examined in more detail and reexamined using experimental procedures. Third, the crosscultural comparison was limited to the difference between Japan and the US. Because it is known that Japanese youths have a strong tendency toward rejection avoidance (Hashimoto, 2021), it is possible that hesitancy to providing social support is a phenomenon unique to Japanese youths in East Asia. Future studies should examine if the present findings are unique to the\nJapanese youth. Despite these limitations, the present study contributes to our understanding of the cultural differences in social support. Japanese people\u2019s provision of social support can be\u00a0affected by factors absent in the West."
