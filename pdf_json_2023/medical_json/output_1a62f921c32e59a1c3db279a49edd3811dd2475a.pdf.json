    "abstractText": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the microbiota play an important role in human and animal health and, when used as probiotics, can contribute to an increased growth performance in livestock management. Animals living in their native habitat can serve as natural sources of microorganisms, so isolation of LAB strains from wild boars could provide the opportunity to develop effective probiotics to improve production in swine industry. In this study, the probiotic potential of 56 LAB isolates, originated from the ileum, colon, caecum and faeces of 5 wild boars, were assessed in vitro in details. Their taxonomic identity at species level and their antibacterial activity against four representative strains of potentially pathogenic bacteria were determined. The ability to tolerate low pH and bile salt, antibiotic susceptibility, bile salt hydrolase activity and lack of hemolysis were tested. Draft genome sequences of ten Limosilactobacillus mucosae and three Leuconostoc suionicum strains were determined. Bioinformatic analysis excluded the presence of any known acquired antibiotic resistance genes. Three genes, encoding mesentericin B105 and two different bacteriocin-IIc class proteins, as well as two genes with possible involvement in mesentericin secretion (mesE) and transport (mesD) were identified in two L. suionicum strains. Lam29 protein, a component of an ABC transporter with proved function as mucinand epithelial cell-adhesion factor, and a bile salt hydrolase gene were found in all ten L. mucosae genomes. Comprehensive reconsideration of all data helps to select candidate strains to assess their probiotic potential further in animal experiments.",

            "text": "A balanced and highly diverse microbiota is essential for healthy life of living organisms in the animal kingdom. Perturbed balance of the microbiota may lead to disease development. Conditions in industrial scale livestock production frequently result in increased stress and health problems. Farming conditions, environmental and nutritional effects and weaning difficulties are the main stress factors in the pig production sector affecting significantly animal health and production. The usage of antibiotics, to overcome stress related negative health effects as well as for growth promotion particularly, was banned in the European Union and in many other countries [1]. Probiotics, used as feed supplements, can serve as alternatives to antibiotics in various cases to avoid economic losses in swine production [2]. Probiotics have beneficial impacts on the balance of gastrointestinal microbiota, the ability to fight enteric pathogens, and capacity to support the immune system [3].\nLactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the most commonly used microorganisms as probiotics. LAB display a strong antimicrobial activity against a range of pathogenic microorganisms and can provide nutritional and health benefits to the hosts [4]. Among LAB, the most commonly used probiotic strains belong to lactobacilli [5], at a large extent due to the \u201cGenerally Regarded as Safe\u201d (GRAS) status of these organisms [6]. Probiotic strains for pigs can improve growth performance, feed conversion efficiency, nutrient utilization, community structure of intestinal microbiota, gut health and regulate the immune system. There are several requirements for probiotic bacteria, the most important being that they must be harmless to the host, i.e. they must not have hemolytic activity or carry acquired antibiotic resistance determinants. It must also possess beneficial properties, such as antibacterial activity, pH and bile acid tolerance, vitamin production, immune-stimulatory activity. However, a given strain does need to possess all the beneficial properties. The roles of Lactobacillus sp. as probiotics for swine were reviewed widely [2, 7].\nThe source of probiotic strains is important, and they should be isolated from the intestinal microflora of the host animal species in order to achieve easier intestinal colonization and more specific applications. Host specificity was observed among lactobacilli isolated from human and animal sources [8]. Lactobacilli and streptococci isolated from swine have shown better adherence to swine squamous epithelial cells than strains isolated from other animals [9], indicating that survival of probiotic bacteria is dependent on a host-specific environment.\nAlthough there is an extensive literature on the intestinal flora of domestic pig, the knowledge on the intestinal flora of wild boar, which are taxonomically the same species, is scarce. One of the main differences between domestic pigs and wild boars,\napart from genetic differences, is that wild boars have to survive under natural conditions without the use of any feed additives, antibiotics or probiotics used in livestock production. Their microbiota may contain beneficial microorganisms that help to prevent various diseases and provide resistance to pathogens. As a result of domestication and prolonged selection in large-scale farming, the composition of the gut microbiota of domestic pigs has changed significantly, and bacterial strains with physiologically beneficial effects that are still found in natural populations may have been lost. Wild boars have a very diverse fecal bacterial community, probably due to their complex food structure [10], therefore it is possible to isolate microorganisms with different properties. Furthermore, wild boars have generally shown high tolerance and/or resistance to many diseases, suggesting that their gut bacteria may be a good source for isolation of potential probiotic strains. Therefore, we have chosen the intestinal contents of the different segments of the intestinal tract of wild boars as a source for the isolation of useful microorganisms. Recognition of the value of wild boar as a potential source of probiotic strains has been reported recently [11, 12].\nThe aim of the present study was to identify LAB isolated from wild boars and to screen them for probiotic attributes and safety properties in\u00a0vitro, in order to select strains that can be used as direct fed microbials in the swine industry. The sampled wild boars were living in their native habitat, in one of the less human-affected regions in Hungary. Guidelines for the evaluation of probiotic activity of candidate strains, recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) [13] and reviewed in several articles [14\u201316], were followed to characterize the isolates. Determination of draft genome sequences and their bioinformatic analyses also facilitated the selection of candidate strains for further evaluation in animal experiments as direct-fed microbials for pigs."

Wild boars were shot during regular hunts organized by the local hunting party in F\u00fcz\u00e9rkoml\u00f3s, the rightful owner of this hunting area for hunting with reference to the LV of 1996 Hungarian State Law on wildlife protection, wildlife management, and hunting, where the boars were professionally eviscerated. All the animals were healthy except for boar #1, which showed signs of enteritis with diarrhea [17]. Four of the wild boars were sows (#1 - #3 and #5) and one boar was male (#4). Three of the sampled animals were adults (#1 - #3), while two (#4\n1 3\nand #5) were young animals. During sampling, the parts of the intestinal tract designated for sampling were sealed with forceps, excised and transported to the laboratory under refrigerated and anaerobic conditions using anaerobic jars and processed within 24 h. The intestinal contents from ileum, colon, caecum and rectum were removed under sterile conditions."

The diameters of inhibition zones were determined after anaerobic incubation at 35 \u2103 for 24 h by using a Scan 500 inhibition zone reader (Interscience, France). Strains were categorized as resistant (R), intermediate (I) or susceptible (S) according to interpretative standards described previously [27]. The interpretation for oxacillin and azithromycin were based on data reported by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [29] for staphylococci, as no other data of inhibition zone diameters for Limosilactobacillus were found in the literature. However, LAB strains showed various patterns when disks of 1 \u03bcg oxacillin were used [30, 31].

Sequence of the lam29 gene was identified in each L. mucosae draft genome sequence by BLAST search. Genes were cut using seqret program [50]. Multiple alignment was constructed using Mafft (version 7.429) [51] with the following parameters:\n--treeout --thread 10 --localpair --maxiterate 2000 --clustalout \u2013reorder\nThe final tree was drawn using the ape package of R [42]. BSH genes were identified using Tblastn [52] search, because the query sequence was protein. Seqret from Emboss [50] was used to cut the region of the genes. Multiple alignment was constructed using Mafft with the same parameters as mentioned above. The final tree was drawn using the ape package of R [42]."

Altogether, 1650 ileum, 1049 colon, 727 caecum and 908 rectum isolates were collected; 1128, 1624, 655, 409 and 518 derived from wild boar #1 to wild boar #5, respectively. Aerobic condition provided 2738 isolates, while semi-anaerobic and anaerobic gave 436 and 1160 ones, respectively.\nFor the screening of isolates from the strain collection, isolates belonging to four genera such as Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Weissella could be identified by LAB specific PCR. PCR positive isolates were purified by sub-culturing and plating until pure colonies were obtained, and a secondary strain collection (894 isolates) has been created from pure cultures. For further screening and characterization, 166 strains were selected (Supplementary Table\u00a01). PCR specific for Leuconostoc genus was suitable to identify 20 strains which belong to this genus\n1 3\n(Supplementary Table\u00a01), while classification of the rest of the isolates required other sequence-based method, such as 16S sequencing."

We have intended to see whether the Lam29 protein gene exist in our strains. The corresponding coding region has been identified in each L. mucosae draft genome sequence, and they were compared to sequences of other L. mucosae strains found in the NCBI database.

In our study we report our efforts to isolate lactic acid bacteria from freeliving wild boars to select strains with probiotic values for swine industry.\nTo establish a primary strain collection, colonies were isolated from gut content at four locations of the gastrointestinal tracts (ileum, colon, caecum and rectum) of five wild boars. The use of six different media in three incubation conditions (aerobic, semi-anaerobic and anaerobic) ensured that a broad spectrum of bacteria was isolated.\nFor screening the isolates, a PCR-based approach was an efficient way to narrow down the strain collection by using a primer pair, specific for four genera (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) [18]. The narrowed collection including the genus Lactobacillus, the one that has been found to be safe for consumption (having \u201cGenerally Regarded as Safe\u201d (GRAS) status) [6]. PCR positive isolates were further classified by culture-based methods. This step led to further selection of the isolates, since only well-culturable strains are suitable for probiotics development, so strains not meeting this criterium were omitted from further study.\nBased on the above criteria, 166 strains were selected for further screening. Since having antimicrobial activity is one\nof the main requirements for probiotics, the isolates were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against four tester strains and according to their antimicrobial activity pattern, 56 strains were selected for further analysis.\nTaxonomic identification at species level, based on 16S rDNA sequence determination and comparison to sequences in reference databases, was essential for further characterization of potential probiotic isolates. It is worth mentioning that a major reclassification of lactobacilli species was performed recently [34], renaming the former species Lactobacillus mucosae to Limosilactobacillus mucosae. Leuconostoc suionicum is a young species, it was first established as a subspecies within the L. mesenteroides species [58] and later became a self-standing species [35]. Out of our 166 strains we have identified so far, 61 L. mucosae and 11 L. suionicum strains (Supplementary Table\u00a01). There is currently no explanation why only these two species were identified from our samples instead of isolating more species, particularly from lactobacilli. However, it remains possible that other species are present among the remaining 94 isolates.\nL. mucosae was discovered by Roos et\u00a0al. [59] as a new Lactobacillus species with in\u00a0vitro mucus-binding ability, isolated from pig small intestine. Since then, L. mucosae strains were isolated from human source, such as feces [60], ileal epithelium [61], vaginal tract [62] and from bovine\n1 3\nintestine and stool [63], as well as from milk of goat [64], sheep [65] and donkey [66]. Recently, the isolation and comparative genome analyses of 93 of L. mucosae strains from different niches have been reported [55]. Taxonomic position of the species within the genus Limosilactobacillus has been confirmed recently [67]. In parallel to isolation of new L. mucosae strains of different origins, the evaluation of the probiotic potential of the species was also performed, confirming that L. mucosae strains can be selected as probiotics since they possess a broad spectrum of biological functional attributes [66]. L. mucosae strain LM1 has been studied extensively in\u00a0vitro [59, 68\u201373] and its probiotic potential was also investigated in\u00a0vivo [74].\nL. mucosae strains have been shown to inhibit a number of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogens [71], such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica [69] and Staphylococcus aureus [75]. Our results are consistent with these findings, 56 out of the 61 identified L. mucosae strains exerted antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus, while 38 of them had inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus (Supplementary Table\u00a01 and Table\u00a01).\nRegarding Leuconostoc suionicum, the first complete genome sequence was published in 2017 (L. suionicum DSM 20241 [76]). Currently, 2 complete and 8 draft genome sequences are available in the NCBI database, and recent reclassification within the Leuconostoc genus confirmed the taxonomic status of the species [77]. A high degree of similarity between the genome sequences of L. suionicum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides was detected, which is not surprising since the previous L. suionicum strains belonged to a subspecies of Leuconostoc mesenteroides [35]. Studies addressing probiotic assessment of microorganisms in the genus Leuconostoc, in particular L. mesenteroides species, are very diverse in the literature but no detailed probiotic study has been performed on strains of L. suionicum species. It was shown that all 20 Leuconostoc strains, including the 11 L. suionicum ones exerted antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus but not against Streptococcus thermophilus (Supplementary Table\u00a01 and Table\u00a01).\nIt is very important that probiotic strains do not cause any harm to the host organism, so their safety of use should be monitored in this respect as well. According to safety regulations and standards [1], \u2013 \u201cStrains of micro-organisms carrying an acquired resistance to antimicrobial(s) shall not be used as feed additives, unless it can be demonstrated that resistance is a result of chromosomal mutation(s) and it is not transferable.\u201d \u2013, determination of the antibiotic susceptibility profile of potential strains should be performed. The aim is to exclude the presence of any transmissible, acquired antibiotic resistance gene, but the presence of non-transmissible, intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes is acceptable or\ncan be even beneficial. Seven antibiotics (erythromycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, vancomycin, oxacillin and azithromycin) were used to determine the antibiotic resistance/susceptibility patterns of the selected strains by disc diffusion method.\nIn general, most Lactobacillus species are intrinsically resistant to kanamycin, vancomycin and trimethoprim, while sensitive to tetracycline, erythromycin and oxacillin [78, 79]. However, acquired determinants encoding resistance for tetracycline and erythromycin were detected in some Lactobacillus species [79]. It is difficult to say how reliably the vast amount of data and analyses accumulated for the genus Lactobacillus can be applied to the genus Limosilactobacillus. Data on the susceptibility of L. mucosae strains are sparse, but two strains reported were resistant to vancomycin and sensitive to tetracycline and erythromycin [66]. As expected, all 47 L. mucosae strains tested were resistant to vancomycin and kanamycin but surprisingly 5 strains were sensitive to trimethoprim. All 47 strains were sensitive to erythromycin. Although none of the strains were resistant to tetracycline, oxacillin and azithromycin, 18, 12 and 10 strains had intermediate phenotype, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). If all strains with intermediate antibiotic resistance are excluded, 21 of the 47 L. mucosae strains need to be excluded from further probiotic development.\nLeuconostoc species have intrinsic resistance to vancomycin and trimethoprim, while atypical resistance to kanamycin, tetracycline and erythromycin has been observed [80]. All 9 L. suionicum strains tested were resistant to vancomycin, trimethoprim and kanamycin (Fig.\u00a01), and all strains were sensitive to erythromycin. While vancomycin and trimethoprim resistance are acceptable, the presence of kanamycin resistance raises concerns. It will be necessary to prove their non-transmissible nature if the strains are selected for probiotics development. Intermediate phenotypes were also detected: 1 strain to tetracycline and 2-2 strains showed intermediate resistance to oxacillin and azithromycin respectively (Fig.\u00a01). These results suggest that a total of 3 out of 9 L. suionicum strains should be considered for exclusion.\nAs a molecular approach we have used specific primer pairs to reveal the presence of blaZ gene for ampicillin, tet(K) for tetracycline, sat4 for streptothricin, mph(C) and msrA for macrolides, mecA for meticillin and oxacillin, dfr(A) for trimethoprim, aph(3)-III for kanamycin resistance by PCR methods [28]. None of these genes were present in our strains investigated. Since both the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility and PCR tests have serious limitation, whole genome sequence could be a good way to assess the safety of the strains. Draft whole genome sequences of ten L. mucosae and three L. suionicum strains were determined. Bioinformatic analysis ruled out the presence of any known acquired antibiotic resistance gene within these genomes.\n1 3\nBased on this result, there is no reason to exclude any of these candidate strains due to presence of prohibited transmissible antibiotic resistance.\nTaxonomical identity of the strains was confirmed in three independent ways. Primarily, 16S rDNA sequencing gave convincing results for species-level identification. Using draft genome sequences, K-mer analyses identified the best matching sequences in the database and thus, in addition to species determination, the closest relatives were identified at strain level (Table\u00a03). Finally, analysis of the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the genomes of our own and some related strains in the NCBI database confirmed the previous results, and phylogenetic trees showed the relationship between the strains investigated (Fig.\u00a02A and B).\nPhylogenetic relationship of the strains, as shown by both, the pairwise values of the similarity matrix of the ANI analyses (Supplementary Table\u00a04) and phylogenetic trees (Fig.\u00a02A and B), indicate that our isolation and screening protocol worked well and allowed the identification of distinct strains for both species. L. mucosae strain F7, F88 and F108 are closely related to the type strain L. mucosae LM1 and some other known strains in the database, while the other 7 strains form a separate subclade (Table\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a02A). The similarity between L. suionicum strains F150 and F156 is 99.9999 % based on FastANI analysis, indicating that they could be identical. Although it would not be a surprising result, since they derived from the same sample, but their behavior was different in both, the antimicrobial activity test (Table\u00a01) and antibiotic susceptibility profile (Fig.\u00a01), so they are still considered to be different strains.\nBacteriocin production of some LAB strains may ensure their stable persistence in the microbial population as they may have competitive advantage over other microorganisms. The presence of enterolysin A genes was reported in several L. mucosae strains by sequence analyses [55]. However, there was no known bacteriocin gene detected either in our L. mucosae strains, or in the closest relative L. mucosae LM1, although some of the strains, such as F1, F2, F4 and F7, exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against several different microorganisms.\nThe sequences of the two very closely related L. suionicum strains (F150 and F156) contained such genetic elements that are likely to be involved in antibacterial function, whereas we could not identify bacteriocin related genes in the closely related F151. From the antibacterial factors identified in Leuconostoc strains F150 and F156, mesentericin B105 could theoretically be functional, as it has been reported that the MesDE secretion machinery is capable of transporting and maturing different pre-bacteriocins, mesentericin Y105 and B105 [81]. Since the mesDE genes in strains F150 and F156 showed significant similarity to the mesDE genes of the mesentericin Y105 system, and it has been previously shown that the mesentericin\nY105 system is cross-compatible with B105 system [81, 82], and as a consequence, functional mesentericin B105 may be present in F150 and F156 strains. In addition to mesDE genes, the mesentericin operon in different Leuconostoc strains also contained some additional genes [83], however, we have not identified similar genes in the region.\nIt is well known that there are multifunctional proteins, sometimes called moonlighting proteins, which perform two or more functions in addition to their primary (originally identified) function [84]. In lactobacilli, the following proteins have been reported to act as mucin adhesion factors: elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chaperonin GroEL, and ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter [85]. The presence of the mucus-binding protein (MUB) leaded to the discovery of the new species, Lactobacillus mucosae [59] and mucinadhesion ability of L. mucosae LM1 was tested in vitro [69]. The elongation factor Tu, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the phosphocarrier protein HPr were upregulated in L. mucosae LM1 when co-cultured with intestinal porcine epithelial cells [72]. In L. mucosae a 29-kDa protein (Lam29), an ABC transporter component protein has been identified and its mucin- and epithelial cell-adhesion capability was proved [48, 49]. The presence of an orthologue gene of the ABC transporter protein has also been demonstrated in the L. mucosae LM1 genome [68].\nIt is evident that mucin binding ability of the strains investigated needs to be addressed experimentally, since even more than one adhesion factor may be involved, and their combined effect should be determined. However, the Lam29 protein appears to be a L. mucosae-specific mucin adhesion factor, and the presence of the lam29 gene in the sequenced strains raises the possibility that the strains possess one of the desirable properties of probiotics, the ability to bind mucins. The likelihood of the presence of a functional lam29 gene in our strains investigated is further supported by the fact that the proven mucin-binding L. mucosae LM1 was their closest relative in the entire database (Table\u00a03), the relationship of this gene family is presented in Fig.\u00a03A.\nGut microbial enzymes contribute significantly to bile acid metabolism through deconjugation and dehydroxylation reactions to generate unconjugated and secondary bile acids. These microbial enzymes (which include bile salt hydrolase (BSH)) are essential for bile acid homeostasis in the host and represent a vital contribution of the gut microbiome to host health [86].\nConjugated bile acids are toxic to bacteria, particularly at low pH, and can affect the bacteria growth in different regions of the GI tract [87]. BSH can confer a protective effect to certain bacteria through bile acid deconjugation and can be an advantage during bacterial colonization, thus BSH activity can be associated with a higher survival of\n1 3\nintestinal transit by rendering them more tolerant to bile salts. Therefore, it has become a selection criterium for probiotics [88\u201391]. However, it is yet not completely clear whether BSH activity is a desirable property [92], as high levels of certain secondary bile acids have proinflammatory effect [93] and can promote the development of infectious, inflammatory or malignant diseases [94, 95]. On the other hand, abundance of the bsh gene was significantly reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and type-2 diabetes [96].\nBSH enzymes are present in various microbial species in most phyla [89]. It was shown that BSH-positive LAB commonly exists in the GIT and the BSH activity of LAB was correlated with their natural habitat [97]. BSH-encoding lactobacilli have primarily a vertebrate-adapted lifestyle as opposed to environment- or plant-associated lactobacilli [95].\nThe number of bsh alleles can vary, with up to 4 different alleles occurring in certain isolates of different Lactobacillus species [98\u2013103], but misclassification of bsh genes in databases has also occurred [98, 103]. It was shown by in silico analysis of 8 Lactobacillus mucosae genomes that all of them contained only one bsh gene [98]. More than 300 LAB strains belonging to several genera have been investigated and BSH activity was found in the majority of Lactobacillus strains but was absent in L. mesenteroides strains [97]. Our results coincide with these findings, since BSH activity was found in all the 47 L. mucosae strains investigated (Table\u00a02) and identified one bsh gene in each of the 10 sequenced genomes (Fig.\u00a03B). Surprisingly, no bsh gene was found in the genome sequence of L. mucosae LM011 (Accession number: CP062966.1). On the other hand, our 9 L. suionicum strains did not show any BSH activity (Table\u00a02), and three sequenced genomes did not contain any bsh gene.\nFor probiotics development, isolation of candidate bacteria, assessment of their probiotic potential and safety attributes in\u00a0vitro are only the beginning steps. In this context, a wide range of in\u00a0vitro attributes should be investigated, preferably using a combination of classical microbiological, molecular biological and genomic methods. In this way, the range of potential probiotic strains can be narrowed down considerably, as we have done in our current work. However, even the most careful in\u00a0vitro experiments cannot provide a conclusive answer as to which strains are suitable for use as probiotics. As a consequence, potential probiotic strains can and should be tested in targeted animal experiments.\nIn our study, from the rich primary collection of isolates from different gut contents of wild boars, 56 strains were selected for detailed analyses. The majority of the strains possessed antibacterial activity against four different common bacteria, including pathogenic ones, and were highly tolerant to stress factors, characteristic for gut environment, such as low pH and high bile concentration. None of the strains had hemolytic activity, and there was no sign\nof having any transmissible antibiotic resistance genes as well. It is still not clear whether high BSH activity will be a desirable attribute for the final probiotic development, but by having the full spectrum (strong, medium and weak activity in L. mucosae strains and no activity in L. suionicum strains) available, it gives us the opportunity to select strains with the desired characteristics. Further assessment in the course of in\u00a0vivo feeding experiments is necessary to prove the usefulness of probiotic strains in pig farming.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12602- 023- 10113-2.\nAcknowledgements The Gr\u00f3f Istv\u00e1n K\u00e1rolyi Hunting Party (F\u00fcz\u00e9rkoml\u00f3s, Hungary) is acknowledged for providing permission to sample the hunted wild boars in the Zempl\u00e9n Mountains, Hungary.
