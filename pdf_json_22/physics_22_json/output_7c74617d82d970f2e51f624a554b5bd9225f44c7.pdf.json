We study the case in which one discretization for the nonlinear term is used in the snapshots (that are computed with a full order method (FOM)) and a different discretization of the nonlinear term is applied in the POD method. We prove that an additional error term appears in this case, compared with the case in which the same discretization of the nonlinear term is applied for both the FOM and the POD methods. However, the added term has the same size as the error coming from the FOM so that the rate of convergence of the POD method is barely affected. We analyze the case in which we add grad-div stabilization to both the FOM and the POD methods because it allows to get error bounds with constants independent of inverse powers of the viscosity. We also study the case in which no stabilization is added. Some numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis. AMS subject classifications. 35Q30, 65M12, 65M15, 65M20, 65M60, 65M70, 76B75.",

In this paper, we study the numerical approximation of incompressible flows with POD methods.\nWe consider the Navier-Stokes equations\n\u2202tu\u2212 \u03bd\u2206u+ (u \u00b7 \u2207)u+\u2207p = f in (0, T ]\u00d7 \u2126, \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0 in (0, T ]\u00d7 \u2126, (1)\nin a bounded domain \u2126 \u2282 Rd, d \u2208 {2, 3} with initial condition u(0) = u0. In (1), u is the velocity field, p the kinematic pressure, \u03bd > 0 the kinematic viscosity coefficient, and f represents the accelerations due to external body forces acting on the fluid. The Navier-Stokes equations (1) must be complemented with boundary conditions. For simplicity, we only consider homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions u = 0 on \u2202\u2126.\nIn practical simulations one can apply some given software to compute the snapshots. It could then be the case that a different discretization is used for the discretization of the nonlinear term in the FOM method and the POD method (the last one being typically implemented by means of a hand-made code instead of an existing one). Our aim in this paper is to study the influence of the use of different discretizations for the nonlinear terms on the final error bounds of the POD method.\nIn [19] POD stabilized methods for the Navier-Stokes equations were considered and analyzed for a case in which the snapshots are based on a non inf-sup stable method and a case in which the snapshots are based on an inf-sup stable method. In the present paper, we consider the second case. Our snapshots are based on an inf-sup stable method and, as in [19], we add grad-div stabilization to both the FOM and the POD methods. We analyze the case in which different discretizations are applied for the nonlinear term. Adding grad-div stabilization we are able to prove error bounds for the method with constants that do not depend explicitly on inverse powers of the viscosity, although, as usual, may depend on it through the norms of the theoretical solution.\nIn the recent preprint [14] we have found an study of the consistency of the nonlinear discretization in FOM and POD methods. In this reference no stabilization is included neither in the FOM nor in the POD method. The authors of [14] conclude that the use of different discretizations in the nonlinear term yields additional terms that prevent the POD method from recovering the FOM accuracy. In the present paper, we prove, in agreement with the results in [14], that there are some additional terms in the error bound of the final POD method coming from the use of different discretizations in the nonlinear terms. We prove that the additional terms have the size of the L2 error in the velocity and the L2 error of the divergence of the velocity of the FOM method. This holds both for the methods with grad-div stabilization and also for the plain methods considered in [14]. We then conclude that there is no inconsistency in the error bounds using different discretization for the nonlinear terms in the FOM and POD methods.\nFollowing [14], we analyzed a concrete case in which the so called divergence or skew-symmetric form of the nonlinear term (commonly used in practice) is used for the FOM method and the EMAC form, see [4], is applied for the POD method. The error analysis for any other combination of discretizations of the nonlinear terms with analogous properties could be carried out in a similar way. The EMAC formulation was designed to conserve energy, momentum and\nangular momentum. Considering a continuous in time method it is easy to see, as we prove in Section 4, that the effect of grad-div stabilization in a method with EMAC form for the nonlinear term is a lost of kinetic energy. The method maintains however the conservation of the momentum and angular momentum. In practice, as stated in [5], a fully version of a method with EMAC form for the nonlinear term is applied. In [5] it is proved that using Newton method for the nonlinear term is the option from which more quantities are still conserved, although the conservation of the kinetic energy is lost. In this sense, adding grad-div stabilization incurres in the same phenomena so that it seems not to be a hard problem since either kinetic energy or any other properties will be lost with the EMAC formulation in the fully discrete case.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce some notation. In Section 3 we state some preliminaries concerning the POD method. Section 4 is devoted to the error analysis in which one considers different discretizations for the nonlinear term in the FOM and POD methods. In Section 5 we present some numerical experiments. We end the paper with some conclusions."

For the discretization of the nonlinear term we consider the following form, the so called divergence or skew-symmetric form,\nbh(u,v,w) = ((u \u00b7 \u2207v),w) + 1\n2 ((\u2207 \u00b7 u)v,w). (9)\nIt is well-known that considering the discrete divergence-free space V h,l we can remove the pressure from (8) since unh \u2208 V h,l satisfies for n \u2265 1(\nunh \u2212 u n\u22121 h\n\u2206t ,vh\n) + \u03bd(\u2207unh,\u2207vh) + bh(unh,unh,vh)\n+\u00b5(\u2207 \u00b7 unh,\u2207 \u00b7 vh) = (f n,vh), \u2200vh \u2208 V h,l.

(23)\nFrom (23) it can be observed that the EMAC form of the nonlinear term implies a modification of the pressure, i.e., in a velocity-pressure formulation of a method with the EMAC form for the nonlinear term the pressure approximation converges to p\u2212 12 |u|\n2 instead of to the original pressure p in (1).

(24)\nThis means that the grad-div stabilization produces a lost in the kinetic energy. As stated in the introduction, considering a fully discrete method with Newton discretization for the nonlinear term one has also the effect of a lost of kinetic energy, see [5]. On the other hand, it is easy to prove that the grad-div term has no negative effect in the conservation of linear and angular momentum so that both are still conserved. To prove this, one can argue as in [13, Theorem 3.3] and observe that the test functions used to achieve the conservation of linear and angular momentum have divergence zero so that the grad-div term does not affect the proof."

In case an approximation to the pressure is also required one can use a supremizer pressure recovery method. This procedure is analyzed in [19], see also [17]. One can argue exactly as in [19, Theorem 5.4] to get an error bound for the pressure, in which, as in Theorem 4.2, one will have to add to the error terms in [19, Theorem 5.4] those coming from the different discretizations used in the nonlinear terms (i.e. fourth and fifth terms on the right-hand side of (39))."

From (49) and arguing as before we conclude\nTheorem 4.5 Let u be the velocity in the Navier-Stokes equations (1), let ur be the grad-div POD approximation without stabilization (case \u00b5 = 0) and assume that the solution (u, p) of (1) is regular enough. Then, assuming condition (48) holds, the error can be bounded as follows n\u2211 j=1 \u2206t\u2016ujr \u2212 uj\u201620 \u2264 3Te2TCu ( \u2016e0r\u201620 + CT\u03bd\u2016Sv\u20160 dv\u2211 k=r+1 \u03bbk\n+CT (h\u22122 + \u03bd\u22121)C(u, p, \u03bd\u22121, l + 1)2 ( h2l+2 + (\u2206t)2 ) +C\u03bd\u22121h2lT\u2016|u|2\u2016L\u221e(Hl) ) + 3T\ndv\u2211 k=r+1 \u03bbk\n+3TC(u, p, \u03bd\u22121, l + 1)2 ( h2l+2 + (\u2206t)2 ) . (50)\nThe final error bound depends explicitly on \u03bd\u22121 and on both the L2 error of the FOM velocity approximation and the error in the divergence of the FOM approximation (that we have bounded by the H1 error).\nRemark 4.6 Alternatively, we can also bound the method without grad-div stabilization in a way that inverse constants of the viscosity do not appear explicitly in the constants. However, the error depends on the error of the plain Galerkin method (12) which in terms depend on \u03bd\u22121.\nTo this end, instead of (37), we can write, integrating by parts\n1 2 (|unh|2,\u2207 \u00b7 enr )| \u2264 1 2 (|unh|2 \u2212 |un|2,\u2207 \u00b7 enr )|+ 1 2 |(|un|2,\u2207 \u00b7 enr )| = 1\n2 |(\u2207\n( |unh|2 \u2212 |un|2 ) , enr )|+ 1 2 |\u2207 ( (I \u2212 PQh)|un|2 ) , enr )|\n\u2264 C\u2016un + unh\u20161,\u221e\u2016un \u2212 unh\u20161\u2016enr \u20160 + 1\n2 \u2016(I \u2212 PQh)|un|2\u20161\u2016enr \u20160\n\u2264 C ( \u2016un \u2212 unh\u201621 + \u2016(I \u2212 PQh)|un|2\u201621 ) + 1\n2 \u2016enr \u201620.\nThen, applying (3), instead of (39) we get\n|I| \u2264 (1 + CC1,inf) \u2016enr \u201620 + C\u2016\u2207\u03b7nh\u201620 + C\u2016unh \u2212 un\u201621 +C\u2016(I \u2212 PQh)|un|2\u201621),\nand then, for Cu = 1 + CC1,inf and \u2206tCu \u2264 1/2, we conclude\n\u2016enr \u201620 + \u03bd n\u2211\nj=1\n\u2206t\u2016\u2207ejr\u201620 \u2264 e2TCu ( \u2016e0r\u201620 + CT\u03bd\u2016Sv\u20160 dv\u2211 k=r+1 \u03bbk\n+CTC(u, p, \u03bd\u22121, l + 1)2h\u22122 ( h2l+2 + (\u2206t)2 ) +Ch2(l\u22121)T\u2016|u|2\u2016L\u221e(Hl) ) .\nAs pointed out in [8], from the above error bound we observe that the grad-div stabilization could be suppressed when we use the EMAC form of the nonlinear term in the ROM method and we can still obtain error bounds with constants independent of inverse powers of \u03bd, apart from the dependence thought the error of the plain Galerkin method. However, the price to be paid is a lower rate of convergence. Compare the last term on the right-hand side above with (45). The rate of convergence obtained with this argument is also lower than the bound (50)."

            "text": "In this section, we present numerical results for the grad-div reduced order model (ROM) (20), introduced and analyzed in the previous section. Actually, a comparison is performed by using both the skew-symmetric (9) and the EMAC (21) form for the discretization of the nonlinear term at ROM level. The numerical experiments are performed on the benchmark problem of the 2D unsteady flow around a cylinder with circular cross-section [21] at Reynolds number Re = 100 (\u03bd = 10\u22123 m2/s). The open-source FE software FreeFEM [11] has been used to run the numerical experiments, following the setup from [19].\nFOM and POD modes. The numerical method used to compute the snapshots for the grad-div-ROM (20) is the grad-div finite element method (FEM)\n(8) described in Section 2, with the skew-symmetric form (9) of the nonlinear term. A spatial discretization using the Hood\u2013Taylor MFE pair P2 \u2212 P1 for velocity-pressure is considered on a relatively coarse computational grid (see [19]), for which h = 2.76 \u00b7 10\u22122 m, resulting in 32 488 d.o.f. for velocities and 4 151 d.o.f. for pressure.\nAs in [19], for the time discretization, a semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula of order two (BDF2) has been applied (see [2] for further details), with time step \u2206t = 2 \u00b7 10\u22123 s. Time integration is performed until a final time T = 7 s. In the time period [0, 5] s, after an initial spin-up, the flow is expected to develop to full extent, including a subsequent relaxation time. Afterwards, it reaches a periodic-in-time (statistically- or quasi-steady) state.\nThe POD modes are generated in L2 by the method of snapshots with velocity centered-trajectories [10] by storing every FOM solution from t = 5 s, when the solution had reached a periodic-in-time state, and just using one period of snapshot data. The full period length of the statistically steady state is 0.332 s, thus we collect 167 velocity snapshots to generate the POD basis U r.\nNumerical results for grad-div-ROM with different discretization of the nonlinear term. With POD velocity modes generated, the fully discrete grad-divROM (20) is constructed as discussed in the previous section, using the semiimplicit BDF2 time scheme as for the FOM, and run with both skew-symmetric (as for the FOM) and EMAC (different from the FOM) formulation of the nonlinear term in the stable response time interval [5, 7] s with \u2206t = 2 \u00b7 10\u22123 s. The initial reduced-order velocity is given by the L2-orthogonal projection P vr of the velocity snapshot at t = 5 s on the POD velocity space U r.\nFirst of all, to assess on the one hand the behavior of the proposed grad-divROM (20) with both skew-symmetric and EMAC form of the nonlinear term, and illustrate on the other hand the theoretical convergence order predicted by the numerical analysis performed in section 4, we plot the discrete `2(L2) squared errors in velocity with respect to the grad-div-FEM (8) solution. In particular, in Figure 1 we show the errors in the reconstructive time interval [5, 5.332] s (used to compute the snapshots and generate the POD modes) in terms of r (number of POD modes). The theoretical analysis proved that, for sufficiently small h and \u2206t as it is the case, the velocity error should scale as \u039br = \u2211dv k=r+1 \u03bbk (see result (45)), and this is recovered in Figure 1 for both discretizations of the nonlinear term. Following the hints given by the error bound (45), for the current setup for which Sv2 = \u2016Sv\u20160 = 2.17 \u00b7102, we actually found that Sv2\u039br is an upper bound for the velocity error. Also, we note that when using a different online discretization of the nonlinear term (EMAC) with respect to the offline phase (skew), the ROM error is barely affected, as suggested by the theoretical analysis.\nIn Figure 2, we show the errors in the stable response time interval [5, 7] s. Thus, we are actually testing the ability of the skew-symmetric and EMAC grad-div-ROMs to predict/extrapolate in time, since we are monitoring their performance over an interval six times larger than the one used to compute the snapshots and generate the POD modes. In this case (not contemplated by the analysis), we notice that the errors increase and, for r > 12, we observe a flattening effect due to the fact that the time interval [5, 7] s is already quite large with respect to the time period used to generate the POD basis. Thus, although we increase the number of POD modes, we do not notice so much the error de-\ncrease. In any case, for small r, the theoretical rate of convergence is recovered, and again very similar results are obtained for both online discretizations of the nonlinear term.\nTo further assess the numerical accuracy of the grad-div-ROM (20) with both skew-symmetric and EMAC form of the nonlinear term, the temporal evolution of the local drag and lift coefficients, and kinetic energy are monitored and compared to the FOM solutions in the stable response time interval [5, 7] s. To compute drag and lift coefficients, we used the volume integral formulation from [15], where the pressure term is not necessary if the test functions are taken properly in the discrete divergence-free space V h,l (4) (by Stokes projection, for\ninstance), as done in [9, 23]. Numerical results for drag and lift predictions using r = 8 velocity modes in the whole time interval [5, 7] s are shown in Figures 3-4, where we display a comparison of grad-div-FEM (8) with the skew-symmetric form of the nonlinear term, and grad-div-ROM (20) with both skew-symmetric and EMAC form of the nonlinear term.\nFrom these figures, we see that both online discretizations of the nonlinear term agree reasonably well with the FOM data, although using a different formulation of the nonlinear term (EMAC) leads to a slightly inaccurate decrease of the drag coefficient as time increases. Similar conclusions can be obtained from Figure 4 for the lift coefficient. The good match that we observe using the same discretization for the nonlinear term as for the FOM (skew) is gradually lost using a different formulation of the nonlinear term (EMAC) in the online phase, which leads to a slightly inaccurate decrease of the lift coefficient too as time increases.\nIn Figure 5, we show the temporal evolution of the kinetic energy using r = 8 velocity modes for the different grad-div-ROMs compared to grad-div-FEM in the whole time interval [5, 7] s. We observe that when considering in the ROM the skew-symmetric form of the nonlinear term (as for the FOM), the kinetic energy is maintained stably around the FOM values, while a slightly inaccurate decrease of the kinetic energy is observed with a different online formulation of the nonlinear term (EMAC) in the predictive time interval [5.332, 7] s. To sum up, using the same discretization of the nonlinear term in the ROM as in the FOM seems to perform slightly better for the considered quantities of interest, providing longer time stability and accuracy, while having very little effect on global error evaluations shown above, as predicted by the numerical analysis."

In the case in which grad-did stabilization is added to both the FOM and POD methods error bounds with constants independent of inverse powers of the viscosity can be obtained. Comparing the case in which the same discretization of the nonlinear term is used for both FOM and POD methods we have checked that there is an added term in the error that has the size of the error of the FOM method (in the L2 norm of the velocity and the L2 norm of the divergence of the velocity).\nOn the other hand, in the case in which no stabilization is added neither to the FOM nor to the POD method, we have carried out two different error analysis. In the first one, the error bounds depend on inverse powers of the viscosity and on the L2 error of the velocity and the L2 error of the divergence of the velocity of the FOM method plus the L2 error of the projection of the square modulus of the velocity onto the FEM pressure space. In the second one, we are able to prove error bounds with constants independent of inverse powers of the viscosity but with the price of having bounds that depend on the H1 norm of the FEM velocity error and the H1 error of the projection of the square modulus of the velocity onto the FEM pressure space. Moreover, since the bounds for the plain Galerkin method depend on inverse powers of the viscosity the dependence on \u03bd\u22121 cannot completely be avoided also in this case.\nOverall, we have identified all the terms in the error bounds for different combinations of discretizations of the nonlinear term adding or not grad-div stabilization.\n5 5.5 6 6.5 7\nt\n0.5\n0.55\n0.6\n0.65 0.7 K in e ti c e n e rg y grad-div-ROM (Skew) grad-div-ROM (Emac) grad-div-FEM (Skew)"
