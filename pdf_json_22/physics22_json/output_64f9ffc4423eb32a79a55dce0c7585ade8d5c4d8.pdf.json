The planned physics program at the LHC and future colliders will require three-loop electroweak and mixed electroweak-QCD corrections to single-particle production and decay processes and two-loop electroweak corrections to pair-production processes. This article presents a new seminumerical approach to multiloop multiscale Feynman integrals calculations which will be able to fill the gap between rigid experimental demands and theory. The approach is based on differential equations with boundary terms specified at Euclidean kinematic points. These Euclidean boundary terms can be computed numerically with high accuracy using sector decomposition or other numerical methods. They are then mapped to the physical kinematic configuration by repeatedly solving the differential equation system in terms of series solutions. An automatic and general method is proposed for constructing a basis of master integrals such that the differential equations are finite. The approach also provides a prescription for the analytic continuation across physical thresholds. Our implementation is able to deliver 8 or more digits of precision, and has a built-in mechanism for checking the accuracy of the obtained results. Its efficacy is illustrated with state-of-the-art examples for three-loop self-energy and vertex integrals and two-loop box integrals.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L111301\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), all building blocks of the Standard Model (SM) have been experimentally confirmed, with the only exception of the Higgs self-coupling, which still awaits direct measurement. However, the SM does not account for important phenomena such as dark matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry, so that physics beyond the SM is needed. It is reasonable to expect that this new physics couples to the electroweak and/or Higgs sector of the SM, since there are important model-building constraints for couplings to the strong force [1]. Therefore, possible evidence for such new physics can be explored in precision studies of electroweak and Higgs physics at the high-luminosity run of the LHC (HL-LHC) or one of several proposed future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders: FCC-ee [2], CEPC [3], ILC [4,5], CLIC [6,7]. Through their high\nintegrated luminosities of several ab\u22121, these machines will be sensitive to very small deviations between the measured value and the SM expectation for a given observable. Thus they can probe extremely feebly coupled new particles or very large new physics scales of tens of TeV. The SM predictions for these precision analyses are\nobtained by computing higher-order quantum corrections. At the HL-LHC, some of the most interesting precision studies are Higgs boson production and lepton pair (Drell-Yan) production. For the former, one of the largest sources of theoretical uncertainty stems from mixed QCDelectroweak corrections [8,9]. While some partial results at this order have been computed [10\u201314], contributions from electroweak diagrams with internal top quarks, both for 3-loop Higgs production and 2-loop Higgs\u00fe jet production, are still needed to complete this missing piece. For Drell-Yan production, 2-loop electroweak corrections for the full process pp \u2192 l\u00fel\u2212, not just on the Z-boson resonance, are important since LHC measurements cover a broad range of invariant mass [15,16]. Similarly, electroweak 2-loop corrections for several different pair-production processes will be essential for the physics goals of future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders [17]: e\u00fee\u2212 \u2192 W\u00feW\u2212, e\u00fee\u2212 \u2192 ZH, and e\u00fee\u2212 \u2192 ff\u0304.

Currently, some results for mixed QCD-electroweak 2-loop corrections are available [18\u201321], but so far no complete electroweak 2-loop calculation for any pairproduction process has been carried out. Even higherorder corrections will be needed for studies of Z-boson production and decay at these future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders, as well as the indirect prediction of the W-boson mass from the Fermi constant. To match the expected experimental precision, 3-loop and partial 4-loop self-energy and vertex corrections will be required [17,22], which is one order of perturbation theory beyond the current state of the art [23]. It should be emphasized that these are loop corrections in the full SM, involving many massive particles inside the loops. The currently most advanced techniques for analytically computing such multiloop Feynman integrals first reduce them to a small set of master integrals, which then are solved by constructing suitable differential equations (DEs); see Ref. [24] for a recent review. Both of these steps require integration-by-parts (IBP) equation systems [25,26] that become computationally difficult for multiloop integrals with many masses. Instead, one must resort to numerical integration techniques. The recent calculation of full 2-loop corrections to Z-\nboson production and decay [23,27,28] made use of numerical evaluations based on sector decomposition (SD) [29\u201333] and Mellin-Barnes (MB) representations [27,34\u201338]. However, these methods require large amounts of computing resources and do not always converge to the required level of accuracy, so that a straightforward extension to more loops and/or legs is not possible. Based on previous experience [28], we expect up to 5 digits precision loss due to numerical cancellations between individual loop integrals, so that at least 8 digits of precision are required in many cases for practical applications. This article introduces an efficient but still very general approach that can be applied to many challenging 2- and 3-loop problems with multiple mass and momentum scales [39]. The key elements are a system of DEs, with boundary terms evaluated at one or more Euclidean (spacelike) kinematic points (which can be reliably determined to high precision with numerical methods). The DEs are then solved, using series expansions, to obtain the final result at the physical Minkowski (timelike) kinematic point. This approach, which is already fully automated in its main parts, will be described in more detail in the next section. In Sec. III we will apply this technique to examples of SM self-energy and vertex Feynman integrals that occur in three-loop Z-decay corrections. The chosen examples are\nvery difficult to evaluate with other analytical or numerical methods. A summary and outlook are given in the final section. Additional examples and implementation details can be found in the Supplemental Material [40]."

            "text": "Solving Feynman integrals from DEs is an approach initiated in the last decade of the last century [41\u201344]. Many families of Feynman integrals admit a choice of master integrals for which the system of DEs has a particularly simple \u201ccanonical\u201d form [45], which in many cases can be straightforwardly solved in terms of multiple polylogarithms. More generally, not all Feynman integrals are of polylogarithmic type, and it can become increasingly difficult to find a closed set of analytic functions in terms of which the DEs can be solved. In such cases, one interesting approach, which allows to tackle a wider class of problems, evaluates a set of master integrals by numerically solving a DE system, either in terms of kinematic parameters [46\u201348] or in terms of an auxiliary mass flow variable [49\u201351]. In this work, we use the approach of iterated series expansions [52,53], and extend it to make it fully automated. For this purpose, we use the program DiffExp [54], which needs as an input a basis of master integrals resulting in a finite system of differential equations. While in several cases a basis was found where the strategy works [55\u201359], in the present work we construct such a basis in an automatic way. The implementation details of this strategy are presented in the Supplemental Material [40]. When crossing a physical threshold with DiffExp, we have to be consistent with the Feynman i\u03b4 prescription. In practice, we consider all unitarity cuts across a diagram topology [60], and for each cut we obtain a linear polynomial of the form s \u2212M2, where s is the square of the momentum flowing across the cut, andM2 is the square of the sum of the masses of the cut propagators. Each polynomial is assigned a \u00fei\u03b4 prescription and given to DiffExp, which allows for the automated crossing of the unitarity cut. We do not search for anomalous thresholds [61,62], which cannot be found by unitarity cuts. This was sufficient for our applications as we did not observe such thresholds during the transport from the Euclidean to the physical region. In general, DiffExp will give an error if a singularity is encountered for which a delta prescription is not provided. This way, we manage to fully automate the question of crossing thresholds. In previous studies, it was not discussed how to perform the basis choice and threshold crossing in an automated fashion. Let us give a brief overview of the method. Consider a basis of master integrals (MIs), F\u20d7\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de, depending on a single scale x. We work in dimensional regularization, with D \u00bc 4 \u2212 2\u03f5 space-time dimensions. We may then derive DEs of the form\nL111301-2\nd dx F\u20d7\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de \u00bc M\u0302\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00deF\u20d7\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere M\u0302\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de is a block-triangular matrix. Each block is associated with a sector of integrals. If we denote such a sector by f\u20d7i\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de, we can decompose the DEs in the form\nd dx f\u20d7i\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de \u00bc Mi\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00def\u20d7i\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de \u00fe Bi\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00deg\u20d7i\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere Mi\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de denotes the diagonal block of M\u0302\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de corresponding to the sector i, and Bi\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00deg\u20d7i\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de captures the off-diagonal terms. One can then expand the integrals and matrices in \u03f5:\nf\u20d7i\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de \u00bc X\u221e j\u00bc\u2212k f\u20d7\u00f0j\u00dei \u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de\u03f5j;\nMi\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de \u00bc X\u221e j\u00bc0 M\u00f0j\u00dei \u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de\u03f5j; \u00f03\u00de\nand solve the system order by order in \u03f5. For a given basis, the condition that Mi\u00f0x; \u03f5\u00de is finite in \u03f5 is not always manifest. It is not trivial to find such a finite form, but an algorithmic procedure is provided in the Supplemental Material [40]. For further ideas and software to help facilitate the choice of MIs, see Refs. [63\u201370]. The DEs system in Eq. (2) fixes the master integrals up to some boundary conditions. It turns out that in the case of our automated DEs approach, a convenient choice for the boundary terms are MIs which are finite in the dimensional regulator \u03f5. We use the package Reduze [71\u201374] to identify these MIs. They can be evaluated efficiently for Euclidean kinematics using the method of SD, since only a small number of sectors is needed for finite integrals and no contour deformation is required to avoid Minkowskian thresholds. We employ the package pySecDec [30,31] for this purpose. The derivation of a DEs system is done with the help of the IBP reduction program Kira [75\u201378]. With the boundary terms fixed numerically and the DEs system derived analytically, we transport the Euclidean point to the Minkowski point with the aid of the method of series expansions of the DEs system [46,52,53,79] as implemented in DiffExp [54]. As demonstrated in the Supplemental Material [40], see therein e.g. in Fig. 4, we may choose different Euclidean points to fix the boundary terms numerically. This allows us to obtain a numerical error estimate of our automated method by taking the difference of two generated results for the same final Minkowski point. A more detailed discussion of the error estimate is provided in the Supplemental Material [40]. Typically, the transport from the Euclidean boundary point to the physical Minkowski kinematics requires several steps since the convergence radius of the series expansion at\nthe boundary point is not large enough to reach the target point. The program DiffExp automatically determines the convergence radius and the number of required transport steps. In general, the complexity of the multiloop computation increases with the number of loops and independent scales and the number of MIs involved. In our automated approach, the largest investment of computing resources is required for the IBP reduction with Kira and the numerical evaluation of the boundary terms with pySecDec. However, the former needs to be done only once for a given Feynman integral family, and the latter only once for a given choice of mass-parameter values. Our strategy for the transport to the Minkowski region with DiffExp automatically deals with thresholds, and it is very fast, so that one can easily evaluate results for multiple different kinematic points, as needed e.g. for phase-space integrations. Quantitative information on the run time for our approach is given in the Supplemental Material [40]. There the reader can also find a description for how our method can be extended to problems with multiple timelike momentum scales."

            "text": "To demonstrate the power and broad applicability of our method, in the following and in the Supplemental Material [40], we present examples for 3-loop self-energy and vertex integrals and 2-loop box integrals. As discussed in the Introduction, these are all examples of key theory ingredients for the physics program of future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders and/or the HL-LHC. The 3-loop integrals are needed for currently unknown third-order corrections to electroweak precision observables connected with Z-boson production and decay, whereas two-loop box integrals are important to improve the precision of several 2 \u2192 2 processes, such as W\u00feW\u2212, ZH or ff\u0304 production [82]. The technique described in this article allows one to compute the desired integrals to, in principle, arbitrary order in the dimension regularization parameter \u03f5 \u00bc \u00f04 \u2212D\u00de=2 with multidigit precision. To achieve a certain order \u03f5k, some boundary terms need to be evaluated to higher orders k0 > k in \u03f5. The required order k0 is determined automatically from the IBP relations. For the examples shown below, some simple boundary-term integrals have to be computed to O\u00f0\u03f57\u00de, whereas no more than O\u00f0\u03f53\u00de is needed for more complicated boundary terms. When evaluating the boundary terms with SD as implemented in pySecDec, the computing time grows approximately linear with the order in \u03f5. All of the following numerical examples are based on the input parameters given in the Supplemental Material [40]."

            "text": "In this work, we have proposed an efficient and versatile approach for the evaluation of a wide class of massive multiloop, multiscale Feynman integrals numerically, with typically 8 or more digits precision. It is based on the method of DEs with boundary terms specified for Euclidean kinematics, which are transported to the physical Minkowski kinematics using series solutions of the DEs. The Euclidean boundary-term integrals avoid all threshold singularities and thus can be straightforwardly evaluated numerically. Our implementation combines the public programs Kira, Reduze, pySecDec and DiffExp in a way that allows us to automatically construct the required integral families and the transport from the Euclidean boundary point to the physical kinematic point, including the analytical continuation across thresholds. In principle, the technique can be extended to higher numerical accuracy and to wider classes of integrals with more loops and more external legs. A major bottleneck are the IBP reductions that are needed to construct the DEs system. A significant speed-up of this step is achieved when using numerical values for the relevant mass and kinematic parameters. In addition, the evaluation of the boundary terms for Euclidean kinematics can be timeconsuming if a high level of precision is required. Fortunately, there are ongoing improvements to the SD\nand MB methods; see e.g. Refs. [31,86,87]. In this respect, also new public packages based exclusively on DEs can be directly applied [88,89]. It is worth mentioning that the 3-loop examples presented in this article are very difficult to solve with existing analytical techniques (e.g. using IBP and DEs) and general numerical methods (such as SD or MB methods). The proposed new technique is sufficiently general to provide the foundation for the computation of the required 3-loop corrections needed for electroweak and Higgs precision studies at the HL-LHC and future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders, which are key elements of the physics program of these machines [9,22]. Other applications include flavor physics at Belle-II and low-energy precision tests of the Standard Model."
