1. **Investigate the effect of different ionic liquids on the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the ionic liquid, but other ionic liquids may have different effects on the reaction mechanism and product selectivity.
2. **Explore the use of different metal porphyrins as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** Cobalt porphyrin was used as the catalyst in the study, but other metal porphyrins may have different catalytic activities and selectivities.
3. **Investigate the effect of different reaction conditions on the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study was conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, but other reaction conditions may affect the reaction mechanism and product selectivity.
4. **Develop a theoretical model to describe the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in ionic liquids.** A theoretical model could help to understand the reaction mechanism and predict the effects of different reaction conditions and catalysts.
5. **Design and synthesize new ionic liquids and metal porphyrins that are optimized for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used commercially available ionic liquids and metal porphyrins, but new materials could be designed and synthesized to improve the reaction efficiency and selectivity.
