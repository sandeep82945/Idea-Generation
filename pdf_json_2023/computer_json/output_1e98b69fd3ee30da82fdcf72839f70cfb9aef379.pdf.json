    "abstractText": "Recently, the wearable internet of things (WIoT) has brought a new dimension of connectivity to wireless body area networks (WBANs). For instance, the WIoT provides valuable functions, such as collecting, analyzing, and transmitting data for real-time health monitoring of medical services. However, designing a clustering and routing protocol is challenging because WIoT attributes are subject to high interference in dense deployment, social mobility, and limited energy. In a WIoT-enabled WBAN, cooperative control is the fundamental function of clustering and routing. Cluster-based routing protocols are preferred for WBAN because of their scalability. However, one-hop neighbor-based clustering approaches do not ensure connectivity and reachability owing to node mobility. The existing two-hop-based clustering protocols are mostly centralized-based approaches, which are unsuitable for dynamicWBANs. In this paper, we propose a distributed energy-efficient two-hop-based clustering and routing protocol (DECR) targeting WIoT-enabled WBAN. In DECR, in the cluster formation phase, each node obtains the information of its neighbor nodes within the two-hop range. We utilize the modified grey-wolf optimization algorithm for the cluster head (CH) selection and routing optimization. Node connectivity and residual energy were jointly considered when determining the CH in each cluster. We also developed an analytical model to determine the optimal number of clusters by considering intraand inter-cluster transmission distances to reduce the overall transmission distance and number of transmissions. Finally, we proposed a routing algorithm to ensure energy-efficient packet delivery fromCH to sink. Our simulation outcomes revealed that the proposed DECR significantly outperforms the existing clustering and routing protocols in various performance metrics.

INTRODUCTION Recently, the wearable internet of things (WIoT) has fascinated increased interest in both academic and industrial areas because of its wide range of potential applications. WIoT enables a new dimension of wireless connectivity in wireless body area networks (WBANs), which helps improve the remote healthcare system and real-time health monitoring [1]. According to the Statistics Korea report, 16.5 per-\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Adamu Murtala Zungeru .\ncent of South Korean population was aged 65 and older in 2021, which, by 2050, will be more than 44 percent [2]. Due to the large number of aged people, the cost of healthcare may increase significantly. In this case, WBANs can provide senior citizens with a cost-effective healthcare system [3]. WBANs can be a possible solution for the aging society\u2019s healthcare, various chronic diseases, and shortage of medical facilities. Owing to the advancement of microprocessors, Wi-Fi interfaces, global positioning systems (GPS), wireless charging, battery technology, smart watch, smartphones, wearable technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, and\nVOLUME 11, 2023 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Tier-1 is intra-WBAN communication, consisting of a set of sensors placed on or implanted into the human body. Tier-2 is inter-WBAN communication using smartwatches, smartphones, and personal computers. Ad hoc architecture is distributed to communicate in this tier with a random topology. The function of Tier-2 is to forward the information sent by the sensor to Tier-3 (terminal center) through 3G/4G/5G, WLAN, and other wireless technologies.\nIn recent years, wearable devices are becoming a potential candidate for the hub of IoT and WBANs [6]. Wearable devices have become famous for health monitoring tools since they can collect data from human body biosensors and transmit vital data while moving [7]. Wearable devices enhance the quality of human life and make our daily life safe. WBAN can be realized in an ad-hoc manner consisting of WIoT devices. Due to the significant increase in WIoT users, we predict that within the next few years, the number of WIoT users and mobile phone users will be the same [8]. In addition, the densely deployed WIoT may cause interference between adjacent WBANs. Therefore, the interference between inter-WBANs should be eliminated to maintain the quality of the network. Besides the characteristics of traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs), such as limited battery capacity, low computational power, and unreliable wireless channel, WIoT-based WBANs have many unique features, including highly dynamic network topology, timevarying channel quality, and high mobility [9].\nMoreover, to maintain reliable data communication, cluster-based routing protocols are widely used in existing literature [10]. One of the main challenges associated with WBANs is the reliable transmission of data to a sink while minimizing the power consumption of the WBAN [11]. In WBANs, clustering is utilized to maintain the topology of networks, and routing establishes the path between the source to the destination node for reliable data transmission. Since WIoT devices generally have limited battery capacity, WBAN lifetime is determined by the energy consumption rate of WIoTs. Thus, energy efficiency is a key issue in designing the clustering and routing protocol in WBANs. There are two well-known approaches for clustering; one is centralized, and another is distributed. Centralized clustering is suitable for small and static networks. However, for dynamic networks, distributed clustering is widely used in existing literature [12]. Moreover, the dual sink approach is more reliable in WBANs in terms of network lifetime, network stability, and energy efficiency [13].\nTo reduce energy consumption in WBANs, researchers have come up with various new ideas. Energy-efficient clustering and routing are key research issues [14]. Generally, in the cluster-based approach, the entire network is divided into several groups or clusters, where the network follows a hierarchical structure. Most clustering approaches divide all\nnodes into two categories: Cluster member (CM) and cluster head (CH). A CH is elected among all nodes in the cluster based on node positions, energy, and the degree of a node. CMs sense and collect the data, then transmit them to the CH; the CH node is responsible for transmitting the data to the sink node. The clustering approach solves the network topology control and long-distance communication issues. Therefore, cluster-based routing protocols reduce the node energy consumption, prolong the network lifetime, and have a low communication overhead. Due to human social mobility, WIoTs move at random. Hence, network topology control becomes an important issue, which makes the proposed cluster distributed and self-organized. Moreover, intra- and intercluster distance affect the optimization of clustering. Therefore, the minimization and maximization of these parameters make topology control an NP-hard problem.\nRecently, several meta-heuristic algorithms have been widely used to find optimal solutions for NP-hard problems [15]. Meta-heuristic algorithms have become popular among researchers due to their flexibility, simplicity, and low complexity. For example, over the past two decades, several bio-inspired optimization methods such as particle swarm optimization [16], grey-wolf optimization [17], and whale optimization [18] have been widely used in different kinds of ad-hoc networks for localization, topology control, clustering, CH selection, and routing.\nHowever, system complexity and overhead may increase by considering two-hop neighbor information [19]. At the same time, two-hop neighbor information extends the local view of the network. The availability of more information about the network topology increases the overall network performance. In the existing literature [20] and [21], it is observed that the clustering and routing protocol based on two-hop neighbors provides stable clustering and requires a smaller number of hops from source to destination compared with one-hop neighbors information-based clustering and routing. However, due to the significant increase in system complexity and overhead, considering three- or more-hop neighbors is less attractive for clustering and routing. Thus, choosing two-hop neighbor is the tradeoff between performance enhancement and protocol complexity.\nA. CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY This article proposes a distributed energy-efficient clustering and routing protocol (DECR) for WIoT-enabled WBAN. For the clustering purpose, we utilized two-hop neighbor information. Two-hop neighbor information extends the local view of network topology, which assists in handling the node mobility and network topology change. The primary contribution of the article is summarized as follows:\n\u2022 In the clustering phase, to optimize the cluster intraand inter-transmission distance, we utilized two-hop neighbor information for cluster formation. Moreover, two-hop neighbor information extends the local view of network topology, which assists in making optimal\n5048 VOLUME 11, 2023\nrouting decisions. An optimal energy-efficient clustering prolongs the network lifetime by reducing the network energy consumption. \u2022 In the CH selection phase, we utilized a modified grey-wolf optimization (MGWO) algorithm to select the CH node. For energy-efficient transmission in intracluster communication, the CH plays a key role. In our proposed approach, a distributed intra-cluster routing is performed based on a one-hop neighbor node as a relay for transmitting data to the CH in the two-hop neighborbased cluster. MGWO utilized the WIoT node fitness value to select the CH. MGWO optimizes the average transmission distance among the nodes within the same cluster. \u2022 In the routing phase, CH utilized MGWO-based routing to transmit the data to the sink node via the CH. The proposed approach utilized the grey-wolf hierarchical structure to transmit data, which minimizes long transmissions and reduces the transmission distance to each CH.\nB. OUTLINE OF THE PAPER The remainder of this paper is arranged in the following way. Section II shows a brief overview of existing literature in this field. In Section III, we examined the preliminaries concerning the motivating scenario, network model, and energy model. Section IV presents the proposed DECR algorithms, including cluster formation, CH selection, and routing. An extensive computer simulation is conducted to evaluate the performance of DECR, compared with the existing approaches in terms of various performance metrics. Finally, in section VI, we present conclusions and future works.\nII. REVIEW OF RELATED STUDIES Due to the recent development in wireless communication and IoT devices, WBAN has become the new dimension of the remote healthcare system. WBAN works in a threelayer architecture. The tire-1 consists of various body sensors. These body sensors collect biosignals from the human body and transmit them to a body control unit, for instance, PDA. In wireless communication, the tire-1 is classified as an intra-WBAN communication, where sensor nodes are static, and the distance between sensor nodes and PDA is very short. The tier-2 forms a network of WBANs composed of several intra-WBANs. Moreover, the tier-2 WBAN contains inter-WBAN communication, where biosignals are further transmitted to the sink node in a multi-hop communication fashion. In modern times, many IoT devices, such as smart watches, WIoT, smart clothing, activity tracker, smart footwear, medical wearable, patches, and jewelry [7], work as tier-2 communication. The Tier-3 network supports emergency services, hospital networks, doctors, medical workers, and emergency transports. In the last decade, much research has been done on intra-WBAN communication. Due to the recent development of WIoT, now is the\ntime to focus on inter-WBAN communication in an ad hoc manner. Several research works have been done for interWABN communication. However, there have been many unsolved issues such as social mobility issues, energy consumption, network lifetime, and reliability of communication systems.\nMu et al. [3] presented a spectrum allocation method for inter-WBAN. The approach tried to mitigate the inter-WBAN interference in a dense deployment using a machine learning-based intelligent partition method for clustering. They considered human social mobility for topology control and clustering. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach performs well in the fast topology of altering inter-WBAN. Mu et al. [22] presented a selforganized dynamic clustering (SDC) method to minimize the interference between multiple WBANs. The proposed method borrowed the cellular network concept to allocate the channel between multiple WBANs. The self-organized method enhanced the reliability of data transmission between inter-WBAN. They used frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA), where FDMA works with a cluster framework and TDMA operates on a superframe structure. In [23], the authors proposed a cochannel inter-WBAN coexistence method empowered by a bio-inspired model to avoid inter-WBAN interference. Each WBNA sends a superframe in a distributed manner to avoid interference. Cellular-assisted D2D communication with a radio resource allocation scheme is used to minimize the collision between twoWBANswhen they are within the radio range of each other [24].\nShimly et al. [25] investigated the cross-layer routing performance for inter-WBAN. In this research, they analyzed the performance of shortest-path routing (SPR) and cooperative multi-path routing (CMR). The performance shows that the alternative paths in CMR performed well in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. Zahid et al. [26] proposed an energy-efficient harvestedaware clustering and cooperative routing called E-HARP. The main contributions of the E-HARP are dynamic CH selection and cooperative routing. First of all, an optimal cluster is selected based on the cost function. A cost function is designed based on node residual energy, required transmission power, link signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and energy loss. Secondly, a routing protocol applies through the CM nodes\u2019 cooperative effort. The performance shows that E-HARP performed well in energy consumption, throughput, delay, and network lifetime. Olivia et al. [27] proposed a data-centric load-aware routing protocol called DLQoS for dynamic WBAN to address the network congestion and prolong the network lifetime. In this protocol, they considered data delivery time, reliability, throughput, and network lifetime as key data-centric parameters. To ensure the performance of data-centric paraments, they jointly considered the neighbor nodes\u2019 link quality and node information. Moreover, the proposed protocol distributed the traffic load by a buffer management system since node mobility significantly impacts\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5049\nclustering and routing protocol performance, resulting in frequent topology changes and packet loss. Asim et al. [28] proposed an efficient cluster formation for IoT-enabled WBAN called MT-MAC. To ensure network integrity, the authors considered the node handover mechanism among the virtual clusters in the network. Simulation results reveal that MT-MAC reduces significant packet loss during node mobility.\nLi et al. [29] investigated the performance analysis for body-to-body networks (BBNs), where an end-to-end delay and packet loss are key performance metrics. In this research, all nodes can freely and stochastically move in the network area. Taking into account nodemobility, they introduced node entrance probability and network entrance probability in the proposed framework. Moreover, they used the Markov chain model for node behaviors. Simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for mobile WBAN. Raj et al. [30] proposed an opportunistic energy-efficient and load balanceaware routing protocol for WIoT-enabled WBAN. The authors address the WIoT data aggression delay and routing loops in the proposed protocol. Fawad et al. [31] proposed a clustering and routing technique based on ant lion optimization (ALO) for WBAN. They utilized the ALO algorithm for the optimal number of clusters. The result shows the effectiveness of the ALO algorithm compared to existing other bio-inspired algorithms in various scenarios. Khan et al. [32] proposed energy-harvested and cooperative-enabled energyefficient routing called EHCRP for IoT-WBANs. They considered multiple parameters for path cost calculation, such as node residual energy, number of hops from source to sink, traffic congestion, path quality, and available bandwidth. Due to the path cost estimation function, EHCRP performs well during data transmission by multi-hop routing. According to [33], a dynamic hierarchical protocol based on combinatorial optimization (DHCO) is proposed to achieve a balance between sensor node energy consumption and network longevity. Instead of selecting the cluster head or the next hop node, the DHCO algorithm establishes a feasible routing set for each sensor node. Authors in [34] provide an overview of various multi-objective optimization algorithms. Towards improving the energy efficiency of ultra-dense WSNs, the authors proposed the use of a combined approach of unsupervised learning and genetic algorithms [35]. A novel algorithm was proposed in [36] that applies machine learning techniques and genetic algorithms to improve the performance of ultra-reliable and low-latency WSNs (uRLLWSNs). In the proposed algorithm, the fetal dataset, denoted by the population, is designed by utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm to construct a two-tier network topology. A method for energy conversion is then developed to prevent cluster heads from becoming overloaded during clustering. The purpose of this multi-objective optimization model is to simultaneously address multiple optimization objectives including the maximum network connectivity and reliability as well as the longest network lifetime. Table 1 summarizes the clustering and routing protocols in WBANs.\nIII. PRELIMINARIES In this section, we introduce a motivational scenario, network model, assumptions, energy model, and the associated assumptions. In addition, the MGWO algorithm is explained as preliminary knowledge of our study. Here are the notations used throughout the paper in Table 2.\nA. MOTIVATION SCENARIO In this paper, we consider the application of WBAN in a public space such as a park or outdoor exercise area. In the scenario, all users have WIoT devices such as a smartwatch. A smartwatch collects the body biosignal from the various sensors installed in the human body. The received biosignal from the human body is transmitted to a static sink node in the deployed area, as shown in Fig. 1. In our application scenario, we assumed that the position of the sink node is in the middle of the deployed area. In addition, the sink node has a 5Gmodule to transmit the data to the healthcare monitoring center for further processing. In this model, we demonstrated that users transmit the WIoT-sensed data to the sink node by multi-hop communication.\nB. SYSTEM MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS In our network model, we considered n number of WIoT devices that are uniformly distributed and randomly deployed in a M \u00d7 M square region, and the sink node is placed at the center of the region, as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, all the WIoT users have human walk mobility at a speed of 2\u20135 m/s [37]. All the WIoT nodes have a communication radius of R, which is a circular area. Initially, all WIoT nodes\n5050 VOLUME 11, 2023\nhave the same energy level and are aware of it. There is no further energy supply when all the WIoT nodes are deployed.\nWhen a node drains off its battery power completely, it is considered a dead node. Each node can measure the distance between its neighbor nodes, or the sink node based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The sink node has unlimited energy, processing power, and buffer capacity and can cover the entire deployed area. The proposed DECR has three phases: clustering, CH selection, and routing, as shown in Fig. 2. In the next section, we explain all three phases.\nC. ENERGY MODEL In this paper, we utilized the first-order radio model [16] to measure the energy consumption of the WIoT nodes. The required energy for transmitting l bits of data over d distance is ETx(l, d), and the receiving energy is ERx(l). The equations of transmitting and receiving energy are represented by Equations 1 and 2, respectively.\nETx(l, d) =\n{ l \u00b7 Eelec + l \u00b7 \u03b5fs \u00b7 d\n2, if d < d0 l \u00b7 Eelec + l \u00b7 \u03b5mp \u00b7 d4, if d \u2265 d0,\n(1)\nERx(l) = l\u00b7Eelec, (2)\nwhere Eelec is the energy required for electronic circuitry, d0 is the threshold distance, and \u03b5fs and \u03b5mp are the energy associated with the transmitter amplifier for free-space fading and multipath fading respectively. Threshold distance can be calculated as follow\nd0 = \u221a \u03b5fs\n\u03b5mp , (3)\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5051\nD. MGWO ALGORITHM MGWO is inherited from the GWO algorithm. The GWO is one of the bio-inspired optimization algorithms designed based on grey wolves\u2019 leadership and hunting strategy [38]. The main principle of the GWO algorithm is simplicity. Hence, a quick speed and high\u2013precision search is easy to achieve using this model. GWO is widely used to solve many optimization problems in the real world. Several swarm algorithms mimic the hunting and searching behaviors of some animals. For example, in GWO, wolves are labeled into four categories: alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), delta (\u03b4), and omega (\u03c9). The alpha wolf is the dominant leader and decision-maker. The beta wolf helps the alpha wolf to make decisions, and the beta takes over the alpha if the alpha passes away. The delta wolf is the third strong wolf who dominates the omega wolf, and the omega wolf follows the orders of the alpha and beta wolves. As the GWO algorithm follows the leadership hierarchy between wolves, three solutions can be obtained during the optimization process. Therefore, compared to other bioinspired algorithms, the GWO has significantly less probability of yielding premature solutions or falling into a local minimum [39] and [40].\nThe grey wolf hunting behavior follows three steps: finding, encircling, and attacking the prey. The population of N wolves is denoted as X = [X1, . . . ,Xn, . . . ,XN ]. Position of the nth wolf in D dimensional search space is defined as Xn = [ X1n , . . . ,X d n , . . . ,X D N ]T . The mathematical model for grey wolf hunting [41] behavior can be represented as\nXdn (t + 1) = X d p (t)\u2212 A d n \u2223\u2223\u2223Cdn \u00b7 Xdp (t)\u2212 Xdn (t)\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (4) where t is the iteration, Xdp is the position of the prey in d\ndimension, and Adn \u2223\u2223\u2223Cdn \u00b7 Xdp (t)\u2212 Xdn (t)\u2223\u2223\u2223 is the size of the encirclement. Adn and C d n are coefficient vectors denoted by\nAdn = 2a \u00b7 r1 \u2212 a, (5)\nand\nCdn = 2 \u00b7 r2, (6)\nwhere r1 and r2 are random numbers between [0, 1], and variables a (decreasing linearly from 2 to 0) are the functions of the iteration steps:\na = 2(1 \u2212 t\ntmax ), (7)\nwhere t shows the current iteration and tmax is the maximum number of iterations [42].\nTo find the optimal solution, the GWO algorithm simulates the behavior of wolves. It utilized three fittest solutions and, in turn, used these three solutions to update other solutions. For other iterations, the positions of the wolves are updated\nas follows:\nXdn,\u03b1 (t + 1) = X d \u03b1 (t)\u2212 A d n,\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223Cdn,\u03b1 \u00b7 Xd\u03b1 (t)\u2212 Xdn (t)\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (8) Xdn,\u03b2 (t + 1) = X d \u03b2 (t)\u2212 A d n,\u03b2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Cdn,\u03b2 \u00b7 Xd\u03b2 (t)\u2212 Xdn (t)\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (9) Xdn,\u03b4 (t + 1) = X d \u03b4 (t)\u2212 A d n,\u03b4\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Cdn,\u03b4 \u00b7 Xd\u03b4 (t)\u2212 Xdn (t)\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (10) Xdn (t + 1) =\n1 k \u2211 k\u2208\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4 Xdn,k (t + 1) (11)\nwhere k denotes the three wolves \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4, and k = 3. The standard GWO algorithm only considers the global best value without considering individual wolf experiences during iteration. To consider the individual wolf experience, we added the memory in each wolf inspired by the PSO algorithm. Finally, the proposed MGWO updates the positions as follows:\nXdn (t + 1) = \u00b51 \u00b7 1 k \u2211 k\u2208\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4 Xdn,k (t + 1)\n+ \u00b52 \u00b7 r3 \u00b7 1 k \u2211 k\u2208\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4 (Xdn,best \u2212 X d n,k (t)), (12)\nwhere social and individual learning factors of wolves are defined by \u00b51 and \u00b52 respectively, r3 is a random value with range [0, 1], and Xdn,best represents the personal historical best solution of the wolf.\nIV. DECR ALGORITHMS In this section, the DECR algorithms for WBANs are discussed in detail, which include clustering, CH selection, and routing algorithm.\nA. TWO-HOP NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY For the two-hop clustering in a distributed fashion, each node needs to obtain its two-hop range neighbor information.\nHello packet is used to obtain the neighbor node information in our case node two-hop connectivity ratio (TCR), energy factor (EF), and node stability factor (NSF). The node EF indicates residual energy level. Each WIoT node has its immediate one-hop and two-hop neighbor nodes. Moreover, each node has its unique identification number and has a neighbor table containing various neighbor information in the Hello packet formulated in Fig. 3. Any node i needs to broadcast the initial Hello packet, as shown in Fig. 3(a), before a new round starts. The Hello\n5052 VOLUME 11, 2023\npacket contains SelfIDi,TCRi,EF i, and NSF i. If a node i receives the Hello packet from a node j, it indicates the node i and j are within a one-hop communication range (R). In the same way, the node j exchanges the Hello packet with the node i. After that, the node i updates its neighbor tables, which contain the node j information, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The neighbor table contains valuable information about neighbor nodes including node position, energy level, and distance. In this way, the node i obtains the one-hop neighbor information from the node j. However, the node i detects the node k information from the node j Hello packet, which indicates that the node k does not have direct communication with the node i, and the node k is a two-hop neighbor node of the node i. Through this process, we obtain the one-hop and two-hop neighbor node information.\nB. TCR To extend the local view of the network we utilized TCR [43], which presents the connectivity ratio of a node with its neighborhood. To obtain the TCR, a node accesses its two-hop neighbor node information. The TCR value for a node i is calculated as follows:\n\u03c8i =\n N2(i)\u2211 j=1 |N (j)| j\u2208N2(i)  + |N (i)| [N2(i)] + 1 , (13)\nTCRi = |N (i)| \u2212 \u03c8i, (14)\nwhere N2(i) is the two-hop neighbor nodes of the node i and \u03c8i is the average connectivity within the two-hop neighbor node of the node i. A node having a high TCR value indicates that it has a large number of neighbor nodes within its transmission range. Such a node is considered to be selected as a CH node.\nC. EF As we mentioned earlier, initially all the nodes have the same energy level. However, after several rounds, the battery starts to drain. Nodes placed near the sink node and CH nodes drain the battery faster than other nodes because of further processing and communication tasks. Therefore, the node residual energy is critical in extending the network lifetime by choosing a CH node considering energy balance. The residual energy level of node i can be calculated as follows:\nEF i = Ere(i) E int (i) , (15)\nwhere Ere(i) and E int (i) are the residual and initial energy of node i, respectively. As we consider the two-hop neighbor range, the normalized energy factor for the two-hop range can be estimated as follows:\n\u03c6i = Ere(i) max [ EreN2 (i) ] , (16) where \u03c6i is the normalized EF and EreN2 (i) indicates the set of residual energy of the two-hop node i.\nD. NSF The node stability affects cluster lifetime. The main objective of NSF is to find the appropriate node that is close to CH as shown in Fig. 4. In our cluster model, we consider the node stability factor based on transmission power as follows:\nNSF =  1 \u2212 \u2223\u2223dmin \u2212 dij\u2223\u2223 dmin , 0 \u2264 dij < dmin 1, dmin \u2264 dij \u2264 dmax\n1 \u2212 |dmin \u2212 dmax | R\u2212 dmax , dmax \u2264 dij \u2264 2R,\n(17)\nwhere dij, dmin, and dmax are the distance between node i and j, minimum transmission distance (0 \u2264 dmin < dmax), and maximum transmission distance (dmin < dmax \u2264 R), respectively.\nMoreover, R, 2R are one-hop, two-hop communication distances. If the distance between two nodes i and j is dmin that means they are very close to each other resulting in higher NSF. On the other hand, if the distance is dmax then they are far away from each other, but still within a communication radius, as shown in Fig. 4.\nE. CLUSTER FORMATION The communication for WIoT is represented by a graph G = (V ,E), where V is the number ofWIoT nodes and E is the set\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5053\nof links betweenWIoT nodes. For cluster formation based on TCR, EF, andNSF, we compute a weight factorWi as follows:\nWi = \u03b7 \u00d7 TCR+ \u03b8 \u00d7 EF + \u03be \u00d7 NSF, (18)\nwhere \u03b7, \u03b8 , and \u03be are the weight coefficients of the corresponding metrics and \u03b7 + \u03b8 + \u03be = 1. Our proposed DECR algorithm is distributed where each node obtains the two-hop neighbor information. As we considered three critical parameters TCR, EF, and NSF during the clustering process, the DECR works in highly dynamic networks. The pseudo-code for the proposed clustering algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Cluster Formation of DECR Input:Node information Output: Cluster formation Procedure 1: Initialize N (i) = \u2205 and Wi = 0. 2: for every node i \u2208 V do 3: Broadcast Hello packet (IDi,TCRi,EF i,NSF i); 4: if any node i received Hello packet do 5: |N (i)| = |N (i)| + 1; 6: Update the TCRi value by Equation (14); 7: Node degree Deg (i) = |N (i)|; 8: Update the CRL i list; 9: end if 10: Update weight valueWi by Equation (18); 11: Broadcast Hello packet; 12: N1(i).add (One-hop neighbor node); 13: N2(i).add (Two-hop neighbor node); 14: N1\u22122(i) \u21d0 N1(i) \u22c3 N2(i) 15: end for end procedure\nAt the initial stage, each node exchanges the Hello packet, as shown in Fig. 3(a). After receiving the Hello packet, each node builds its neighbor table based on the connectivity ratio, which also gives us the degree of a node. Subsequently, each node builds a clustering record list (CRL) based on the\ndegree of a node. In the second step, the weight factor is calculated by Equation (18), and again, each node broadcasts the Hello packet, as shown in Fig. 3(b). After receiving the Hello packet, Algorithm 1 completes the one- and two-hop neighbor node lists. Finally, after obtaining the one-hop and two-hop node information, the proposed algorithm forms a cluster, which includes one-hop and two-hop neighbor nodes.\nF. OPTIMAL NUMBER OF CLUSTERS Assume that the average number of clusters is C and the average number of nodes per cluster is NC , where N is the number of nodes [44]. The number of CH per cluster is only one, therefore each cluster contains NC \u2212 1 number of the cluster member nodes. As we consider two-hop neighbors for clustering, the number of one-hop and two-hop nodes per cluster is calculated as follows\nE[N 1] = \u03c0R2\n\u03c0 (2R)2 \u00b7 ( N C \u2212 1 ) . (19)\nE[N 2] = ( N C \u2212 1 \u2212 |N (i)| ) = 3 4 ( N C \u2212 1 ) . (20)\nAs intra-cluster distance is a key parameter, we consider the two-hop neighbor-based clustering. A two-hop neighborbased cluster will be larger than a one-hop-based cluster. The average distance square between the CH node and two-hop neighbor nodes is expressed as\nd(CH,N2) = M2\n2\u03c0C , (21)\nwhere M is the square area. The average distance square between the CH node and one-hop neighbor nodes is presented as\nd(CH,N1) = M2\n8\u03c0C . (22)\nTherefore, the average distance square between one-hop neighbor nodes and two-hop neighbor nodes can be defined as\nd(N1,N2) = M2\n8\u03c0C . (23)\nTwo-hop neighbor nodes transmit the data to one-hop neighbor nodes. The energy consumption for this transmission is defined as\nETx(2h,1h) = N2 \u00b7 ETx (l,1d)\n= 3 4 ( N C \u2212 1 ) \u00b7 l \u00b7 ( Eelec + \u03b5fs \u00b7 M2 8\u03c0C ) . (24)\nThe energy consumption for receiving data from two-hop nodes to one-hop neighbor nodes is defined as\nERx(2h,1h) = N1 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 ERx (l)\n= 3 4 ( N C \u2212 1 ) \u00b7 l \u00b7 Eelec. (25)\n5054 VOLUME 11, 2023\nThe energy consumption of transmitting aggregate data from the one-hop neighbor to the CH node is defined as\nETx(1h,CH) = N1 \u00b7 ETx (l, d)\n= 1 4 ( N C \u2212 1 ) \u00b7 l \u00b7 ( Eelec + \u03b5fs \u00b7 M2 8\u03c0C ) . (26)\nThe energy consumption of received aggregate data from the one-hop neighbor to the CH node is defined as\nERx(1h,CH) = N1 \u00b7 ERx (l)\n= 1 4 ( N C \u2212 1 ) \u00b7 l \u00b7 Eelec. (27)\nTherefore, total energy consumption for data transmission between two-hop neighbor nodes to CH node can be calculated as follows\nEintra = ETx(2h,1h) + ERx(2h,1h) + ETx(1h,CH) + ERx(1h,CH).\n(28)\nFor the inter-cluster transmission, we used relay nodes to transmit the data to the sink, and energy consumption for relay inter-cluster data is defined as\nErelay = ERx (l)+ ETx (l, d) . (29)\nThe total energy consumption Etotal of the entire network will be a summation of all intra-cluster and inter-cluster energy consumption. First derivation of Etotal provides the optimal number of clusters as follows\ndEtotal dC = 0. (30)\nCopt = { C | C \u2208 N ,\ndEtotal dC\n= 0 } . (31)\nFinally, for the N number of nodes the optimal probability to become CH in the network is CoptN .\nG. CLUSTER HEAD SELECTION For the CH selection, we utilized the MGWO algorithm. The CH selection process is described in Algorithm 2. As GWO algorithm offers the three best solutions alpha, beta, and delta according to the sequence. Therefore, the alpha node is the best solution with the best knowledge about the search space whose position is more likely to be near the prey. Initially, the CH is selected based on the node connectivity ratio and energy level. We formulated a fitness function based on TCR value and EF as follows:\nF(CHm) =  \u03bb \u00b7 Ere(i) E int (i) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u00b7 TCRi, Ere(i) > 0\n0, Ere(i) \u2264 0. (32)\nwhere \u03bb is the weight coefficient of the corresponding fitness function. A nodewith higher residual energy and connectivity ratio will be selected as a CH. When the current alpha node\nenergy level reaches the threshold level, the next CH may choose from the beta node. CH lifetime is obtained as follows\nCHLTm = Ere(i) Etotal , (33)\nwhere Etotal indicates the total amount of energy consumption in a single round. Subsequently, the position of the prey is updated as follows\nXdn (t + 1) = Fn,\u03b1X d n,\u03b1 (t + 1)+ Fn,\u03b2X d n,\u03b2 (t + 1)\n+ Fn,\u03b4Xdn,\u03b4 (t + 1) , (34)\nFn,\u03b1 = F\u03b1\nF\u03b1 + F\u03b2 + F\u03b4 ,Fn,\u03b2 = F\u03b2 F\u03b1 + F\u03b2 + F\u03b4 ,\nFn,\u03b4 = F\u03b4\nF\u03b1 + F\u03b2 + F\u03b4 , (35)\nwhere Fn,\u03b1 , Fn,\u03b2 , and Fn,\u03b4 are the weight of the alpha, beta, and delta wolf respectively and F\u03b1 , F\u03b2 , and F\u03b4 are the three best fitness values.\nAlgorithm 2MGWO-Based CH Selection Input: Clusters Cm and number of nodes N Output: Cluster head CHm, where m = 1, 2, . . . , ??. /\u2217 Initialization phase \u2217/ 1: Initialize the position of the wolf pack X = [X1, . . . ,Xn, . . . ,XN ]. 2: Initialize the MGWO parameters (a,Adn ,C d n ). /\u2217 Computation \u2217/ 3: while (t < tmax), do 4: for each search agent CHm do 5: Compute the fitness value using Equation (32); 6: Select the three best solutions Xdn,\u03b1 , X d n,\u03b2 , and X d n,\u03b4; 7: Update the coefficient vector (a,Adn ,C d n ); 8: Update the wolf position using (8)\u2013(12); 9: Update the prey position using (35); 10: end for 11: t = t+ 1 12: end while 13: return CHm\nInitially, the positions of the wolf pack and the MGWO parameters are initialized in lines 1\u20132. For each round to select the CH from the wolf pack, a fitness value is computed based on Equation (32). According to the principle of the MGWOalgorithm,we obtain the three best solutions by using Equations (8)\u2013(12). Finally, the algorithm selects the alpha wolf as a CH.\nH. ENERGY-EFFICIENT ROUTING In this paper, routing is categorized in two ways. First, all the WIoT nodes transmit their data to the nearest CH node. Nodes placed at a two-hop distance from CH transmit their data to one-hop neighbor nodes, and then one-hop neighbor nodes transmit the received data to its nearest CH. Second, CH receives data and aggregates the data. After intra-cluster transmission, inter-cluster transmission happened. Details of\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5055\nthe process of intra-cluster transmission are described in the first part of Algorithm 3. To optimize the inter-cluster transmission, we utilized the MGWO algorithm. The proposed algorithm\u2019s objective is to choose the high residual nodes during routing to distribute energy over the whole network and minimize the transmission distance between the CH to the sink.\nWhen the sink node is out of range from the CH nodes, the CH nodes utilized the multi-hop routing to transmit data to the sink. In the routing path, we choose high residual energy nodes as follows:\nRPnext\u2212hop(CH i,CH j) \u221d E re(CH j), (36)\nwhere RPnext\u2212hop(CH i,CH j) is the next-hop routing between CH i and CH j. A CH needs to select its nearest CH for data transmission as follows\nRPnext\u2212hop(CH i,CH j) \u221d 1\n(CH i \u2212 CH j) . (37)\nA CH requires to choose the next hop CH, who is nearest to the sink node as follows\nRPnext\u2212hop(CH i,CH j) \u221d 1\n(CH j \u2212 sink) . (38)\nFinally, the MGWO fitness value is computed for routing as follows\nRPnext\u2212hop(CH i,CH j)\n\u221d Ere(CH j)\u2225\u2225CH i \u2212 CH j\u2225\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u2225CH j \u2212 sink\u2225\u2225 . (39)\nMini : F = RPnext\u2212hop(CH i,CH j)\n\u221d Ere(CH j)\u2225\u2225CH i \u2212 CH j\u2225\u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u2225CH j \u2212 sink\u2225\u2225 . (40)\nInter-cluster routing is presented in Algorithm 3 second part.\nI. COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY In our networkmodel, we considerN number ofWIoT nodes. Every node is involved in the CH selection process by broadcasting the Hello packet. Therefore O(n) number of packet broadcast for CH selection. After the CH selection, CHm node broadcasts an announcement, where O(m) number of packets broadcast. All the CMs need to compare the distance after getting the CH announcement. The total communication overhead for the clustering process is O(mn). Moreover, each node broadcasts the Hello packet to its one-hop neighbor nodes; thus, the algorithm overhead for this process requires O(n). We assume that the maximum number of iterations is tmax . The total communication overhead for the clustering process is O(mn2tmax). To compute the overhead for routing we assume that hmax number of hops are required to send the data from CM to sink. Thus, the communication overhead for CHm number of nodes isO(mhmax). In DECR, the total overhead is the combination of clustering and routing overhead, that isO(mn2tmax+ mhmax).\nAlgorithm 3MGWO-Based Routing Input: Cluster formation, Cluster head CHm, where m = 1, 2, . . . , M.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION To evaluate the performance of the proposed DECR, we conducted an extensive computer simulation using MATLAB R2021a [45]. Moreover, we compared our proposed DECR with two recent clustering and routing protocols, MTMAC [28] and ALOC [31]. Both ALOC and MT-MAC were designed for WBAN applications.\nA. SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT In our simulation, initially, 100 nodes are deployed in a 100m \u00d7 100m square region. All nodes are uniformly distributed in a random fashion. The sink node is placed at the center of the region with the coordinate of (50m, 50m) for scenario-1 and in the scenario-2 sink position is outside of the network area with the coordinate of (0m, 0m). All nodes have a random waypoint mobility (RWM) model, and the speed of nodes is 2 to 5 m/s [37]. Simulation parameters are summarized in Table 3.\nWe compared DECR with MT-MAC and ALOC in terms of the packet delivery ratio (PDR), control overhead (CO), average end-to-end (AE2E) delay, network lifetime, network energy consumption, cluster building time, and cluster\n5056 VOLUME 11, 2023\nlifetime. The definition of the above performance metrics is defined in [21].\nB. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION FOR SCENARIO-1 In this subsection, we analyzed and compared the performance of DECR algorithm with the existing clustering and routing protocol.\nThe simulation environment is presented in Fig. 5, where 200 nodes are deployed randomly and uniformly distributed on a 100 m2 square region.\nThe sink node indicated by the black color is located at the center of the region. All the nodes can move freely and follow the RWM model, which is more similar to the human walk."

Node densities have an impact on PDR. Because of the low density, the nodes face frequent link disconnection problems resulting in low PDR. After increasing the number of nodes, PDR increases sharply for all the protocols. However, our proposed DECR performs better than MT-MAC and ALOC. This is because we considered the two-hop neighbor-based clustering that works better than the one-hop neighbor-based clustering. Two-hop neighbor information extends the overall network knowledge and reduces packet loss even in high nodemobility.Moreover, when the number of nodes is less, the number of CH is also less; thus, CM nodes need to transmit data to the CH from a distance. However, after increasing the number of nodes, the number of CH increases as many, resulting in higher PDR."

When the node energy goes down from a certain threshold level, the algorithm needs to activate the CH selection process since a short cluster lifetime increases the CO because of re-clustering and CH selection. Fig. 10 depicts that the cluster lifetime decreases as node densities increase. Due to the node mobility, the network topology frequently changes, resulting in a lower cluster lifetime."

DECR balances the energy consumption between the nodes, resulting in a slower node death rate. Our proposed approach balances the network topology well by better clustering, optimizing the number of CH, balancing the transmission distance into the cluster, and reducing the inter-cluster transmission distance, leading to less energy consumption in the network. Low energy consumption, higher residual energy, and a higher number of living nodes indicate the protocol stability.\nC. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION FOR SCENARIO-2 In scenario-2, 200 nodes are deployed randomly and uniformly distributed on a 200 m2 square region and a sink node is placed outside of the network area. Here, DECR has been simulated for evaluating the PDR, AE2E delay, the total number of raw packets to sink, and average network energy consumption rate in scenario-1 and 2. Additionally, the simulation results of the round of first node death (FND), half node death (HND), and all node death (AND) are presented and their outcomes have been compared with existing clustering algorithms in Table 4.\nWe found that the proposed algorithm extends the network lifetime, and this happens because of the inclusion of energyefficient clustering, CH selection, and packet routing strategy. The number of raw packets sent to the sink node can well represent the transmission efficiency of the routing protocol. For both scenarios, DECR shows higher FND, HND, and AND compared with ALOC and MT-MAC. Results show that when the sink is placed outside of the network area, shorter is the life span of WIoT nodes. The amount of data is spectacular when the sink is located at the center of the network.\nVI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have proposed a distributed energyefficient clustering and routing protocol for WIoT-enabled WBANs. The proposed DECR has three phases: cluster formation, CH selection, and routing. For the cluster formation,\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5059\nwe utilized two-hop neighbor information. Two-hop neighbor information extends the local view of the network topology, which helps maintain the network topology. Moreover, we also introduce new factors such as TCR, EF, and NSF, which are jointly considered for cluster formation. In the CH selection phase, we utilized the MGWO algorithms inspired by GWO. The node TCR and residual energy are considered to select the CH node. Our proposed analytical model helps compute the optimal number of clusters in the network. Finally, our energy-efficient routing optimizes intra- and inter-cluster communication. The simulation results indicate that the proposed DECR is superior in performance metrics such as PDR, AE2E delay, control overhead, cluster building time, cluster lifetime, and network energy consumption. Additionally, the distributed energy balancing among the nodes significantly prolongs the overall network lifetime.\nIn our future work, we will consider finding more optimal solutions using different heuristic algorithms.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the editor and anonymous referees for their constructive comments for improving the quality of this paper.\nREFERENCES [1] B.
