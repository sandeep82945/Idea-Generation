Blennow 1 1Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg\nCSF biomarkers reflecting the core Alzheimer\u2019s disease ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration) pathologies are available. Specific ATN biomarkers include A\u00df42, phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) and \u201ctotal\u201d tau (T-tau), and the A\u00df42/40 and P-tau/A\u00df42 ratios. They show very high performance to identify amyloid deposition and AD, also in the very early stages of the disease. These tests are today available on fully automated lab analyzers and FDA approved methods, with superior precision. More recently, promising blood biomarkers for AD have also been developed, which will be of great importance when the new amyloid immunotherapies will be available in the clinic. The plasma A\u00df42/40 ratio, measured using either immunoassays or immunoprecipitation - mass spectrometry (IP-MS) methods show high concordance (AUCs of 80-90%) with brain amyloidosis evaluated by PET. However, the effect size (fold change) for plasma A\u00df42/40 ratio is very low (only around 10% decrease in amyloid PET positive cases). This results in low robustness, which may cause difficulties for introduction in clinical routine use. Promising data have been reported for several phosphorylated tau species (P-tau181, P-tau217, and P-tau231) in blood, with specific increases in AD and high concordance with tau PET. Recent studies show high correlations between these P-tau species in both CSF and plasma, suggesting that differences are minor, but recent studies suggest that P-tau231 shows the earliest change, while P-tau217 increases with severity of disease and show a higher fold change. There are also several different methods for all the plasma P-tau variants, both immunoassays and mass spectrometry methods. Neurofilament light (NFL) levels are increased in CSF and blood in AD, but NFL is a general neurodegeneration biomarker showing high levels in many other neurodegenerative disorders. Brain-derived tau (BD-tau) is a novel AD-type neurodegeneration biomarker that show promised as the N-component in the blood ATN framework. Likely, blood biomarkers will fit better for risk prediction, in algorithms together with APOE and age, as first-in-line triage tools."
