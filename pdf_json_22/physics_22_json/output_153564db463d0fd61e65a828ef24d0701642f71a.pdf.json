    "abstractText": "We report the on-surface synthesis of a nonbenzenoid triradical through dehydrogenation of truxene (C27H18) on coinage metal and insulator surfaces. Voltage pulses applied via the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope/atomic force microscope were used to cleave individual C\u2013H bonds in truxene. The resultant final product truxene-5,10,15-triyl (1) was characterized at the single-molecule scale using a combination of atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our analyses show that 1 retains its open-shell quartet ground state, predicted by density functional theory, on a two monolayer-thick NaCl layer on a Cu(111) surface. We image the frontier orbital densities of 1 and confirm that they correspond to spin-split singly occupied molecular orbitals. Through our synthetic strategy, we also isolate two reactive intermediates toward the synthesis of 1 \u2013 derivatives of fluorenyl radical and indeno[1,2\u2013a]fluorene, with predicted spin-doublet and spin-triplet ground states, respectively. Our results should have bearings on the synthesis of non-benzenoid high-spin polycyclic frameworks with magnetism beyond Lieb's theorem.",

            "text": "Polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) have emerged as an important molecular platform for investigating structure-property relationships and emergent phenomena in purely organic materials. Given their finite size, the electronic properties of PCHs critically depend on the molecular size, shape, edge structure and the presence of non-benzenoid rings. In particular, by virtue of their molecular topology, certain PCHs may exhibit an open-shell (magnetic) ground state, which makes them highly attractive for applications in molecular electronics, spintronics and non-linear optics.1\u20133 The synthetic chemistry of open-shell PCHs has gained unprecedented traction since the advent of on-surface synthesis,4 where reactive open-shell molecules that are otherwise unstable in the solution phase can be synthesized and stabilized on solid surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Additionally, molecules synthesized via this approach are amenable to atomic-scale structural and electronic characterization using scanning probe techniques.5\u20137.\nA prototypical example of open-shell PCHs is the family of [n]triangulenes, which are non-Kekul\u00e9 triangular PCHs containing n benzenoid rings along each edge (Fig. 1a). Since the attempt of Clar and Stewart in 1953 to synthesize [3]triangulene,8 the syn-\nthesis of [n]triangulenes remained an enduring challenge for almost 70 years.9,10 In 2017, on-surface generation of [3]triangulene was reported,11 where its three-fold symmetric structure and spinpolarized frontier states were visualized by means of scanning probe microscopy. Since then, on-surface syntheses of larger triangulene homologues12\u201314 and other triangulene-based open-shell PCHs15\u201317 have been reported. Magnetism in [n]triangulenes arises as a direct consequence of a sublattice imbalance in the bipartite honeycomb lattice, such that it is impossible to pair up all pz electrons into \u03c0-bonds, which thus generates radicals. An intuitive way to predict the magnetic correlation between radicals in PCHs is Lieb's theorem,18,19 which states that the ground state total spin quantum number S = (N\u2013N*)/2, where N and N* denote the two interpenetrating triangular sublattices of the honeycomb lattice. For [n]triangulenes, N\u2013N* = n\u20131 > 0, which leads to a high-spin ground state (S > 0) with a linear scaling of S with n.\nAmong the multitude of open-shell molecules realized to date both in solution and on surfaces,20\u201322, an overwhelming majority are benzenoid systems. However, few examples of non-benzenoid open-shell systems exist in literature,23\u201332 despite the unique opportunities they offer in investigating the interplay of aromaticity and magnetism,27,33,34 and electronic structure tuning of carbonbased nanostructures.29,35 Moreover, it has been recently proposed that non-benzenoid biradicals with triplet ground states, formed in hydrocarbon flames, play an important role in incipient soot formation.36 Lieb's theorem is generally applicable to any bipartite system at half filling described by a repulsive Hubbard model, thus accounting for the magnetic ground states of many PCHs. However, magnetic correlations in non-benzenoid molecules, where the bipartite symmetry of the underlying lattice is broken, cannot be captured by this rule. This opens new opportunities to engineer spin correlations with non-benzenoid rings beyond the constraints of Lieb's theorem.37,38 Among the existing nonbenzenoid open-shell systems, most are reported to exhibit a singlet (S = 0) ground state, while systems with high-spin ground states are rare, with two notable examples being a tetrabenzoChichibabin hydrocarbon reported by Zeng et al.23 and a cyclopenta-ring-fused oligophenylene decaradicaloid reported by Liu et al.,27 with both systems exhibiting an open-shell triplet (S = 1) ground state. However, open-shell non-benzenoid systems with S > 1 remain elusive. Previously, there have been attempts to synthesize the non-benzenoid three-fold symmetric PCH truxene5,10,15-triyl (1, Fig. 1b) in solution, which possibly exhibits an open-shell quartet (S = 3/2) ground state. Frantz et al.39 attempted the formation of mesityl-substituted 1 via reduction of a triol\n2\nprecursor with SnCl2 under acidic conditions, which, however, resulted in a dihydromonoradical product. Recently, Yang et al.40 reported the synthesis of a derivative of 1 consisting of 1- and 9- anthracenyl substituents where delocalization of spin density to the anthracenyl substituents led to thermodynamic stabilization of the triradical, although a low spin concentration of less than one spin per molecule was found via solid state electron spin resonance measurements. However, isolation of the parent 1 hitherto remains elusive.\nHere, we report the synthesis of 1 and demonstrate its open-shell quartet ground state. Starting from truxene (10,15-dihydro-5Hdiindeno[1,2-a;1\u00b4,2\u00b4-c]fluorene), an ambient-stable PCH, the tip of a combined scanning tunneling microscope (STM)/atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to sequentially cleave three C\u2013 H bonds, ultimately leading to the formation of the non-Kekul\u00e9 species 1 on metal surfaces and thin insulating films. We study the electronic structure of 1 using a combination of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, wherein we confirm the open-shell ground state of 1 and detect the orbital densities of the associated singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs). Furthermore, our atomic manipulation-based synthetic approach allows us to isolate and image two reactive intermediates toward the synthesis of 1 (Fig. 1c), viz. derivatives of fluorenyl radical (2) and indeno[1,2a]fluorene (3) \u2013 the indenofluorene regioisomer with the largest predicted diradical character and open-shell triplet ground state."

            "text": "Solution synthesis of truxene. Truxene was obtained in 71% yield by trimerization of indan-1-one following a previously reported procedure by Dehmlow and Kelle.41 Indan-1-one was added to a mixture of acetic acid and concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution was stirred for 16 h at 100 \u00b0C, and then poured on ice. The solid precipitate was washed with water, acetone and dichloromethane to give truxene as a white powder.\nGeneration of triradical on coinage metal surfaces. We started by exploring the formation of 1 through tip-induced dehydrogenation of truxene on Au(111) and Cu(111) surfaces. Dehydrogena-\ntion events were induced by positioning the STM tip over the center of the molecule and opening the feedback loop at typical tunneling conditions of V = 0.2 V and I = 1.0 pA (where V and I denote the sample bias and tunneling current, respectively). From this setpoint, the tip was retracted by about 5 \u00c5 to limit the tunneling current, and the sample bias was ramped to 4.0\u20134.6 V, where abrupt changes in the tunneling current indicated manipulation events (see Fig. S1 for a representative I(V) curve for dehydrogenation of truxene). As shown in the sequence of constant-height AFM images in Fig. 2, dehydrogenation of truxene was reproducibly achieved on both Au(111) (Fig. 2a\u2013d) and Cu(111) (Fig. 2e\u2013 h) to generate 1. The adsorption conformation of 1 is qualitatively different on the two surfaces: in contrast to its largely planar adsorption on Cu(111) (Fig. 2g, h), 1 exhibits a non-planar adsorption conformation on Au(111), where the apical carbon atoms of the three pentagonal rings are not resolved in AFM imaging (Fig. 2d), explained by them being closer to the surface compared to the other carbon atoms of the molecule.42 We tentatively attribute the difference in the adsorption conformation of 1 on the two surfaces to the different surface lattice parameters of Au(111) and Cu(111), such that commensurability of the apical carbon atoms of the pentagonal rings with the on-top atomic sites of the surface (which maximizes bonding interactions) is achieved for Au(111) but not for Cu(111). We note that based on the Clar structure of 1 (Fig. 1b), the pentagonal ring apices are expected to bear the largest spin densities, which likely makes them the most reactive moieties in 1. Our interpretation is further supported by a previous work by Di Giovannantonio et al. on the synthesis of indeno[2,1\u2013 b]fluorene polymers on Au(111),43 where both tilted and planar configurations of individual indenofluorene units were observed depending on whether or not the highest spin density-bearing carbon atoms were adsorbed on on-top Au sites.\nElectronic structure of triradical. To experimentally access the electronic structure of 1, we used two monolayer-thick (2ML) NaCl films on Cu(111) as an insulating layer to electronically decouple the molecule from the underlying metal surface. As shown in Fig. 3, formation of 1 on 2ML NaCl/Cu(111) could be reliably achieved, albeit larger sample biases (typically 5.4\u20135.7 V) at tip-sample distances of about 15 \u00c5 were required for\n3\ndehydrogenation reactions than on Cu(111). On the 2ML NaCl/Cu(111) surface, the molecules were frequently displaced by interaction with the tip before any manipulation events occurred. Therefore, we studied molecules that were adsorbed at the edge of 3ML NaCl islands.11,44\nTo study the electronic structure of 1, we first performed spinpolarized DFT calculations. Our calculations predict an open-shell quartet ground state of 1 in the gas phase, with the open-shell doublet (S = 1/2) state 100 meV higher in energy (see Fig. S2 for DFT calculations for 1 in the open-shell doublet state), implying a robust high-spin ground state of 1. Fig. 4a shows the spinpolarized DFT energy spectrum of 1 around the first three molecular orbitals, which correspond to three SOMOs (denoted as \u03a81, \u03a82 and \u03a83) with a ferromagnetic correlation between the populating spins. Furthermore, while \u03a82 and \u03a83 are degenerate, \u03a81 is lower in energy for both the occupied (spin up) and unoccupied (spin\ndown) channels. Also shown in Fig. 4b is the computed spin density distribution of 1, where the largest spin density is present at the apices of the pentagonal rings, in agreement with the Clar structure of 1 (Fig. 1b).\nOur STM experiments support the principal outcomes of our theoretical analyses. Differential conductance (dI/dV) spectrum acquired on 1 on 2ML NaCl/Cu(111) (Fig. 4c, d) reveals two distinct peaks at V = \u20132.00 V and V = 1.15 V, which we assign to the positive (PIR) and negative ion resonances (NIR), respectively. Figures 4e shows constant-height STM images acquired around the PIR, gap (V = 0.20 V) and NIR (see Fig. S3 for additional STM images). While the STM image acquired in the gap resembles the geometrical shape of 1, images recorded at the PIR and NIR exhibit orbital densities where the salient features correspond to three prominent lobes at the apices of the pentagonal rings, along with three weaker lobes at the outer benzenoid rings.\n4\nAlthough 1 is an open-shell molecule, the PIR and NIR exhibit some differences. This is in contrast to other open-shell systems imaged with STM, where similar orbital densities at both bias polarities were observed due to electron tunneling to/from SOMOs.11,45 At the NIR, the lobes on the pentagonal rings of 1 appear rather localized with a weak orbital density at the center of the molecule. In contrast, the lobes at the pentagonal rings appear smeared out at the PIR, with significant orbital density at the molecular center. This difference may be rationalized by considering the DFT energy spectrum of 1 (Fig. 4a), where the frontier orbitals, which should dominate the contrast in STM imaging at the PIR and NIR, correspond to \u03a82\u2191 and \u03a83\u2191 in the occupied regime, and \u03a81\u2193 in the unoccupied regime. In Fig. 4f, we plot the DFT local density of states (LDOS) maps associated with these frontier orbitals, that is, \u01c0\u03a81\u2193\u01c02 and \u01c0\u03a82\u2191\u01c02 + \u01c0\u03a83\u2191\u01c02. For both maps, the predominant features correspond to the three lobes at the pentagonal\nring apices. However, in the occupied regime, a substantial electronic density is additionally present above the central benzenoid ring, which experimentally manifests at the PIR as the smearing out of the three lobes and increased orbital density at the molecular center.\nGiven the open-shell quartet ground state of 1, magnetic excitations, viz. quartet-doublet spin excitations and/or Kondo resonances, are expected to be observed in 1. On both Au(111) and Cu(111), we do not observe any signatures of magnetic excitations likely due to the strong electronic hybridization between 1 and the metal surfaces. Additionally, the high mobility of 1 on 2ML NaCl/Cu(111) precludes the employment of larger tunneling currents that are used to detect inelastic processes such as spin excitations.\nIsolation of reactive intermediate species. Our atomic manipulation-based synthetic route also allowed us to isolate two\n5\nintermediates toward the synthesis of 1. Dissociation of a single hydrogen atom from truxene generates the non-Kekul\u00e9 S = 1/2 fluorenyl radical moiety (2, Fig. 5a, b). Further cleavage of a second hydrogen atom from 2 leads to the generation of the indeno[1,2\u2013a]fluorene moiety (3, Fig. 5c, d). Indeno[1,2\u2013a]fluorene belongs to the general class of compounds known as indenofluorenes (Fig. 5e), which are non-benzenoid PCHs containing a conjugated array of alternating six- and five-membered rings. The presence of 20 \u03c0-electrons in indenofluorenes makes them formally antiaromatic, while presence of quinodimethane moieties in the conjugated framework endows them with potential open-shell character.33 Among the five indenofluorene regioisomers shown in Fig. 5e, solution syntheses of compounds I\u2013IV have been achieved in solution,24,46\u201348 while II\u2013IV have also been synthesized on surfaces.43,49,50 Compound V, whose derivative 3 is achieved in the present work, is predicted to be the indenofluorene regioisomer with the largest open-shell diradical character.33,43,51 The transient isolation of a derivative of V has only once been reported in solution by Dressler et al.,51 who obtained structural proof of the stable dianion of V. Our work reports the direct generation of a derivative of V. In Fig. S4, we provide a detailed STS characterization of 3. Briefly, 3 exhibits a frontier orbital gap of 3.25 eV on 2 ML NaCl/Cu(111), which is 0.10 eV larger than the gap of 3.15 eV for 1, consistent with the increased quantum confinement in 3. While our DFT calculations, in consistence with previous works,51 predict an open-shell triplet ground state of 3 in the gas phase; based on the correspondence between our experimentally measured orbital densities and DFT-LDOS maps of the frontier orbitals of 3, we presently cannot unambiguously assign the electronic ground state of 3 to either open- or closed-shell."

Our STS measurements, in combination with DFT calculations, demon-\nstrate the open-shell ground state of 1. The strong intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange (estimated to be 0.10 eV from DFT calculations) in combination with its three-fold symmetry, renders 1 a promising molecular building block toward fabrication of spin chains and lattices. Such structures, for example, may be fabricated on metal surfaces via installation of labile halogen atoms at the outer benzenoid rings of truxene, which should afford dehalogenative aryl-aryl coupling upon thermal annealing, or alternatively, they may also be fabricated on insulators via STM-based atom manipulation.52 On a general note, our work presents a rare instance of syntheses of high-spin PCHs with non-benzenoid ring topologies."

STM and AFM measurements were performed with a home-built lowtemperature STM/AFM system operating at a temperature of 5 K and base pressure below 1\u00d710-10 mbar. Au(111) and Cu(111) single crystal surfaces were prepared by cycles of sputtering with Ne+ ions and annealing to 770 K. NaCl was evaporated onto Cu(111) surface held between 273\u2013293 K, which leads to the growth of defect-free and predominantly bilayer NaCl(100) islands. Submonolayer coverages of truxene and CO molecules were deposited at a sample temperature of 10 K. STM images were acquired both in constant-current and constant-height modes, while dI/dV spectra were acquired in constant-height mode. Positive and negative values of the tip height offset \u0394z denote tip approach and retraction from the STM setpoint, respectively. Bias voltages are provided with respect to the sample. Unless otherwise noted, all STM and STS measurements were performed with metallic tips. Non-contact AFM measurements were performed with a qPlus sensor53 operated in frequency modulation mode,54 with the oscillation amplitude kept constant at 0.5 \u00c5. All AFM measurements were performed in constant-height mode with CO-functionalized tips.5 STM and AFM images, and STS curves, were post-processed using Gaussian low-pass filters.\nDFT calculations. DFT was employed using the FHI-aims code.55 All molecules were independently investigated in the gas\n6\nphase. The geometries were optimized with the really tight basis defaults. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof56 exchange-correlation functional, along with the van der Waals scheme by Tkatchenko and Scheffler,57 were employed for structural relaxation. The convergence criteria were set to 10-3 eV \u00c5\u20131 for the total forces and 10-5 eV for the total energies."
