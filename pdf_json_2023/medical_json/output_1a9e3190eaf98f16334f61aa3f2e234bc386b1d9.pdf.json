    "abstractText": "The development of novel phosphor materials with excellent performance and modification of their photoluminescence to meet the higher requirements for applications are the essential research subjects for luminescent materials. Multi-site luminescent materials with crystallographic sites for the activator ions that broaden the tunable range of luminescent spectra and even enhance the luminescent performance have attracted significant attention in the pursuit of high-quality luminescence for white light-emitting diodes. Here, we summarize multi-site luminescence characteristics based on the different kinds of host and activator ions, introduce the identifications of multi-site activator ions via optical analysis, provide a structural analysis and theoretical calculation methods, and introduce the regulation strategies and advance applications of multi-site phosphors. The review reveals the relationship between crystal structure and luminescent properties and discusses future opportunities for multi-site phosphors. This will provide guidance for the design and development of luminescent materials or other materials science.",

            "text": "The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura \u201cfor the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources\u201d in 2014. The white LEDs (wLEDs) have been widely used as the fourth generation of green solid-state lighting sources in general lighting, displays and other advanced applications [1,2]. To achieve high-quality white lighting, phosphor-converted wLEDs (pc-wLEDs) with high luminescence efficiency, stable color, spectral design flexibility and low cost have become the mainstream [3,4]. Nowadays, the luminous efficacy of commercial pc-wLEDs has been improved repeatedly. As one of the core luminescent materials of pc-wLEDs, phosphors determine the color quality and application performance of the solid-state lighting devices. An excellent phosphor with strong absorption, large excitation band, tunable emission band, high luminous efficiency, low thermal quenching, high chemical and thermal stability, appropriate particle morphology, etc. is required [5]. Hence, the design and development of high-quality phosphors are an eternal subject in the field of solid-state lighting. To meet higher requirement of pc-wLED applications, more multi-site luminescent materials have been focused on and investigated by increasing numbers of scientists and researchers. Previously, the widely used pc-wLEDs combined with a blue chip and yellow emitting Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ were restricted to low color rendering index (CRI) Ra < 80 for advanced and healthy applications [6]. As such, high-quality full-spectrum wLEDs that simulated the solar spectrum have been proposed, leading to a variety of luminescent\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16062179 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 2 of 29\nmaterials with broadband emission and excellent luminescent properties being developed. Among them, the various multi-site phosphors with blue, cyan, green, yellow, and red emissions exhibit a broadened and flexibly tunable spectrum and have been widely used to obtain excellent CRI. Also, the multi-site phosphors can reduce the variety of luminescent materials, thereby decreasing the re-absorption phenomenon, fabrication complexity and color drift due to different thermal behavior between various phosphors, ensuring that the assembled wLEDs show the desired luminescence performance [7]. Moreover, with the rapid demand of near-infrared (NIR) lighting, the multi-site NIR phosphors with broadband emission have attracted significant attention due to various important applications requiring different wavelength ranges [8]. The Cr3+, Mn2+ and Eu2+ activator ions are introduced into multiple crystallographic sites to construct significant multi-site NIR phosphors for practical applications. No matter what the light color of the phosphors, their emission bands are closely related to the lattice environments, where activator ions dominated, as well as their nearest neighbor sites. The excited electrons of activator ions transit to their ground states and release energy in the form of emission or lattice vibrations [9,10]. As such, the design and regulation of luminescent properties are directly dependent on the effect of lattice vibrations and localized crystallographic structure. According to the urgent requirements for better performance, the band gap engineering and crystal-site/phase engineering strategies are equipped to regulate and modify the multi-site phosphor for the benefit of human life. Over the past few years, lots of investigations based on multi-site luminescence have been reported. However, scarcely any reviews focusing on the subject have been published. Our review will summarize the relevant research concerning the development and modification of multi-site luminescent materials. Based on the different kinds of host and activator ions, the multi-site luminescence characteristics and their relationship between crystal structure and luminescence will be introduced in detail. Identification of the preferential occupation for the activator ions in multi-site phosphors will be evaluated and elucidated in terms of optical analysis, structural analysis and theoretical calculations. The modification of the emission spectrum, enhancement of luminescence performance and advanced applications for multi-site phosphors will be described clearly. These summaries and comments will try to analyze the influence mechanism of multi-site-doping activator ions on the structure and luminescence properties, reveal the relationship between crystal structure and luminescent properties and provide guidance for the design and modification of multi-site phosphors."

            "text": "The classic phosphor system is composed of the host and the activator ions [9]. The host material constructs the bulk of phosphor, that provides proper crystallographic sites for activator ions. The activator ions, which are doped into the host lattice in relatively small amounts, can absorb excitation energy and convert it into the ultraviolet, visible or infrared emission. In general, the host is optically inert, but its local structure affects the electronic structure of the activator ions so that different activators dominated at different crystallographic sites exhibit varying multi-site luminescence. To sufficiently describe the multi-site luminescence of phosphors, the construction of multisites in the host and the luminescent properties of different activator ions have been discussed and are clearly explained in this section."

            "text": "The design of phosphors based on the typical structural model is an effective strategy [11]. To achieve multi-site luminescence, the host of the phosphor should provide various crystallographic sites for activator ions. At present, many kinds of compounds that accommodate various cations with different valence states have been designed and developed for a variety of phosphors with multi-site luminescence, including garnetstructure, apatite-structure, melilite-structure, A3MX5-structure, \u03b2-K2SO4-structure, whit-\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 3 of 29\nlockite (\u03b2-Ca3(PO4)2)-structure phosphors, etc. Among them, garnet-structure phosphors have been widely used in wLEDs due to their excellent structural flexibility, good physical and chemical stability and high luminescent efficiency. The classic Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce3+) phosphor was synthesized over fifty years ago [12]. Garnet-structure compounds have the general formula of A3D2E3O12; their structure model and the [AO8] dodecahedrons, [DO6] octahedrons, and [EO4] tetrahedrons are illustrated in Figure 1a [13]. As with most of garnet phosphors that have been reported, Ce3+ is generally dominated at a single crystallographic site, and even Eu2+ is difficult to introduce into the garnet lattice; this can be attributed to the significant differences in the crystallographic environment among the A, D and E sites and the rare appropriate divalent crystal sites in the garnet lattice. As a result of the research and development of the garnet-structure phosphor, increasing numbers of multi-composition materials are synthesized and studied, as the A, D and E cationic sites can be occupied by various divalent, trivalent or tetravalent ions, including Y3+, La3+, Gd3+, Lu3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, Zr4+, Hf4+, Si4+, Ge4+, etc. The garnet lattice possesses various cationic crystallographic sites with different valence states, which provide significant possibilities to construct numerous multi-site luminescence opportunities.

Although the activator ion is dominated at only one crystal-\nlographic site, two luminescence centers of Ce3+ are observed, peaked at 490 nm (Ce1) and\n530 nm (Ce2), respectively. The Ce1 emission is ascribed to the intrinsic luminescence of\nCe3+ in dodecahedron, while the Ce2 emission that does not depend on doping concentra-\ntion is attributed to the formation of Ce3+ pairs.

The emission spectrum, excited at 370 nm of YMAS:Eu2+, exhibits a broad band that can be divided into two Gaussian bands peaked at 461 nm and 503 nm due to the Eu2+ ions dominated at eight-coordin ted\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 4 of 29\nand six-coordinated crystallographic sites, respectively (as shown in Figure 1c) [15]. The introduction of Mg2+ into the A and D sites of the garnet lattice provides suitable crystallographic multisites for the Eu2+ activator ion, resulting in the sensitive regulation of color point via tuning the doping concentration of Eu2+. Furthermore, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is changed from 80 to 105 nm with the Eu2+ doping level from 0.01 to 0.10 due to the crystal field splitting and nephelauxetic effect. Similarly, the Mn2+ doped YMAS phosphor is synthesized, which exhibits the multiple emissions. As shown in Figure 1d, the Mn2+ ions occupy Mg2+ site of [AO8] dodecahedron to form red emission peaked at 635 nm (Mn1), replace Mg2+ site of [DO6] octahedron to form deep red emission peaked at 735 nm (Mn2) and dominate the Al3+ site of [EO4] tetrahedron to form green emission peaked at 536 nm (Mn3) [14]. The YMAS:Mn2+ phosphor shows broadband emission covering green-red-deep red regions; this is an excellent candidate for full-spectrum plant growth LEDs. Recently, many novel garnet-structure phosphors with multi-site luminescence have been developed via activator ions doping and co-doping strategy. The activator ions include, but are not limited to, Ce3+, Eu2+, Bi3+, Eu3+, Mn2+, Dy3+, etc. [16\u201321] Various luminescence and its modification are achieved due to the multi-site doping, local structure tuning and energy transfer. In addition to yttrium aluminum garnet phosphor, the Si-series and Ge-series garnet phosphors have attracted significant attention as luminescent materials for wLEDs, including Ca3Sc2Si3O12:Ce3+, Mg3Y2Ge3O12:Ce3+, etc. When Ca2+ dominates the A site, Ga3+ dominates the D site and Ge4+ dominates the E site, the Cr3+-doped Ca3Ga2Ge3O12 garnet-structure phosphor with super broadband near-infrared (NIR) emission is obtained (structure model of host and emission spectra are shown in Figure 2a,b [22]).

The Cr1 emission corresponds to the Cr3+ at the Ga3+ site, and the Cr2 and Cr3 emissions are attributed to Cr3+(Ca2+)-Ga3+(Ge4+) associations as defect sites. Similarly, the vibration-coupling structure is observed in the Ca3Sc2Ge3O12:Ce3+ (CSGO:Ce3+) phosphor (structural model and emission spectrum are illustrated in Figure 2c,d [23]). Although the activator ion is dominated at only one crystallographic site, two luminescence centers of Ce3+ are observed, peaked at 490 nm (Ce1) and 530 nm (Ce2), respectively. The Ce1 emission is ascribed to the intrinsic luminescence of Ce3+ in dodecahedron, while the Ce2 emission that does not depend on doping concentration is attributed to the formation of Ce3+ pairs. Energy transfer from Ce1 to Ce2 and good thermal stability are observed for CSGO:Ce3+. Hence, the formation of dissimilar local structure is an effective strategy to construct multi-sites for activator ions in the host lattice. According to this method, a series of garnet-structure phosphors with varying local structure and at least two luminescent centers are designed and synthesized, such as Ce3+-doped Y3MgAlAl2SiO12, CaY2Al4SiO12, etc. [24,25]. The enhancement of emission intensity and thermal stability, as well as the peak shift and a considerable broadening of the emission band, can be achieved.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 5 of 29Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 31\nFigure 2.

This section introduces various multi-site luminescence based on different activator ions, including Eu2+, Ce3+, Cr3+, Eu3+, Mn2+, Mn4+, Bi3+, etc.\n2.2.1. Eu2+\nThe divalent Eu ion is a common activator for rare earth luminescent materials, whose 4f-5d transition is illustrated in Figure 4a. The electrons of Eu2+ in the 4f7 ground state are excited to the 4f65d1 excited state to form the free Eu2+ ion. The centroid shift \u03b5c is related to the cation electronegativity and polarizability of anionic ligands. The crystal field splitting \u03b5cfs is inversely proportional to the distance between the center ion and the ligand. Hence, the excitation and emission of Eu2+ is directly affected by the crystal environment where it dominates [27]. Some Eu2+-doped multi-site phosphors are summarized for the host, multiple crystallographic sites for Eu2+ and its corresponding emission peaks and FWHM, as shown in Table 1.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 7 of 29\nGenerally, Eu2+ prefers to occupy the divalent alkaline earth metal cation sites due to the appropriate valence state and ionic radius. As for the \u03b2-Ca3(PO4)2-structure compounds, when the Y3+-Na+ substitutes the Ca2+-Ca2+, the Eu2+ ions could possibly dominate five kinds of polyhedrons, such as Ca(1)O7, Ca(2)O7, Ca(3)O8, Ca(5)O6 and/or Na(4)O6 [41]. The emission spectrum of the Ca9Na3/2Y1/2(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor exhibits an asymmetric peak that can be divided into three Gaussian fitting bands, as shown in Figure 4b. According to the calculation of 4f-5d transition of each site based on the empirical formula for the emission and absorption energy, the three sub-bands are attributed to Eu2+ ions occupied at the Ca(3) site (peaked at 495 nm), the Ca(1) and (2) sites (peaked at 550 nm) and the Na(4) site (peaked at 600 nm). The Ca(1) and Ca(2) sites have the same valence bond sum and coordination environment, which results in similar centroid shift (\u03b5c) and crystal field splitting (\u03b5cfs) and emission bands for Eu2+ at these two sites; as such, these sites can be considered as the same position. With the introduction of Y3+-Na+ into the lattice, another suitable crystal environment is created for Eu2+-doping, meaning that non-equivalent substitution is feasible for the construction of multi-site luminescence. Activator ions doping into multisites commonly result in a broadband emission due to the recombination of several sub-bands of the multiple luminescence. The Eu2+ typically exhibits broadband emission due to its 4f-5d allowed transition characteristics. Only a few narrow-band Eu2+-activated phosphors have been developed, including \u03b2-sialon:Eu2+. Based on the above opinions, the narrow-band multi-site phosphor seems impossible. However, if Eu2+ has a significantly different occupation preference for different crystallographic sites, and the preferential occupation has high lattice rigidity and symmetry, the multi-site narrow-band Eu2+-activated phosphors can be obtained. For Eu2+-activated Sr5SiO4Cl6, the host provides three kinds of Sr polyhedrons for the activator, and their occupation preference is Sr(3)O8 > Sr(1)O9 > Sr(2)O7 (structural model is illustrated in\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 8 of 29\nFigure 4c [46]). The emission bands are deconvoluted to three sub-bands peaked at 472 nm (Sr1 site), 445 nm (Sr3 site) and 406 nm (Sr1 site), as shown in Figure 4d. The highly symmetric crystal environment of Eu2+ results in an FWHM of 33 nm, color purity above 90%, internal quantum efficiency of 91.4% and an excellent thermal stability.

Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V.\nCo-doping several activator ions in a multi-site host is an effective strategy to construct various luminescent centers and energy transfer, which can realize the enhancement of luminescent performance. Eu2+ and/or Ce3+ are commonly co-doped together or with other activator ions to develop novel optical materials. The La5Si2BO13 lattice with an apatite structure provides two kinds of La sites for the Eu2+ and Ce3+ activator ions, as illustrated in Figure 5c [48]. Under the excitation of 345 nm, the emission spectrum of La5Si2BO13:Ce3+, Eu2+ phosphor exhibits a bimodal asymmetric band that can be deconvoluted into six Gaussian fitted peaks, as shown Figure 5d. The A, B, C and D sub-bands correspond to the transitions of Ce3+ (5d\u21922F7/2, 2F5/2) dominated at different two La crystallographic sites, as the E and F sub-bands belong to the emissions of Eu2+ at the La1 and La2 sites, respectively. The energy transfer from Ce3+ to Eu2+ is observed in the co-doped phosphor. The Ce3+ and Eu2+ ions show diverse responses with temperature change, making the La5Si2BO13:Ce3+,\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 10 of 29\nEu2+ phosphor a potential candidate for optical thermometry. The relevant application of multi-site luminescence in relation to temperature or even pressure sensing will be introduced in next section. In addition, some other co-doped multi-site luminescent materials have been designed and reported that are not described further. These materials have co-doped activator ions that include, but not limited to, Ce3+, Eu2+, Tb3+, Mn4+, Eu3+, Sm3+, Bi3+, etc. [54\u201358].\n2.2.3. Cr3+\nNowadays, NIR light sources have been attracted significant attention in applications ranging from security monitoring, food testing, biological recognition, vivo imaging, light touch switches, smoke alarms and others [59]. NIR phosphor-converted LEDs have been widely adopted due to their broadband spectra, better wavelength-tunable performance and low cost. Consequently, the design and development of high-quality NIR phosphors has become an essential research subject. Because of the suitable transition characteristics of Cr3+, a variety of Cr3+-doped phosphors have been studied and used to produce NIR light over the past few years; these include Gd3Sc1.5Al0.5Ga3O12:Cr3+ [60], Na3ScF6:Cr3+ [61] and ScBO3:Cr3+ [62], among others. However, their PL wavelength needs to be longer, and their FWHM needs to be wider, in order to be more suitable for the various applications mentioned above. Therefore, constructing multi-site luminescence and energy transfer are the effective strategies for enhancing the luminescence properties of Cr3+-activated phosphors for NIR light. The gallate La3Ga5GeO14 (LGGO), with multiple cationic crystallographic sites, is an appropriate host for Cr3+-doped luminescent materials; it has been widely studied over the years. Figure 6a shows the structural model of LGGO host; it includes three different Ga sites with different coordination numbers and the crystal environment of La and Ge [63]. Considering the differences of valance states and ionic radii between Cr3+ and La3+/Ga3+/Ge4+, the activator ions are prone to substitute Ga3+ ions. The preferential occupation of Cr3+ is identified based on the EPR measurement, Rietveld refinements of XRD and First-principles DFT calculations. The results show that the activator ions prefer to dominate at the Ga1 and Ga3 sites. The identification methods of multisites of the activator ions will be described in detail in Section 3. The multi-site luminescence for LGGO:Cr3+ phosphor is traced; it shows a super broadband NIR emission peaked at 980 nm with a large FWHM of 330 nm, as shown in Figure 6b. To optimize the application performance, the energy transfer is constructed via Pr3+-Cr3+ co-doping, as the Pr3+ acts as a sensitizer, so that the luminescence intensity of co-doped sample is improved 3 times. The internal quantum yield of the Cr3+-activated sample is 7.7%, and that of the co-doped sample is 38.5%. La3Ga5GeO14:Pr3+, Cr3+ exhibits significant potential as a broadband NIR phosphor for application in food testing. Recently, many Cr3+-activated phosphors with ultra-broadband emission resulting from multi-site luminescence have been developed. The Cr3+ can be dominated at five different kinds of crystallographic sites of Mg7Ga2GeO12, as illustrated in Figure 6c [64]. The emission spectrum of Cr3+-doped Mg7Ga2GeO12 can be deconvoluted into four individual Gaussian bands peaked at 700 nm (CrI), 723 nm (CrII), 778 nm (CrIII) and 867 nm (CrIV), which are attributed to the activator dominated at [Ga1/Mg1], [Ga3/Mg3, Ga4/Mg4], [Ga2/Mg2] and [Ga5/Ge1] sites, respectively. Furthermore, the concentration quenching of different emissions shows different speeds (CrI > CrII > CrIII > CrIV) which also causes energy transfer. Based on the above, the FWHM of Mg7Ga2GeO12:Cr3+ phosphor can be broadened from 101 to 226 nm by changing the Cr3+ doping concentration. Similarly, some Cr3+-doped multi-site NIR phosphors are summarized and shown in Table 3.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 11 of 29\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 31 ions will be described in detail in Section 3.

Eu3+\nDue to its f-f forbidden transition characteristics, the Eu3+ emission exhibits a series of sharp emission bands whose peaks barely shift with changes in the local surrounding. However, the multi-site regulation of Eu3+ can achieve the modification of color coordinates, luminescence efficiency and thermal stability. For instance, the SrLu2O4 (SLO) compound with an orthorhombic structure provides two inequivalent crystallographic sites of Lu3+ that can be dominated by Eu3+ activator ions, forming the two types of (Lu1/Eu1)O6 and (Lu2/Eu2)O6 octahedrons [76]. The SLO:9%Eu3+ phosphor shows red emission with five primary sharp peaks at 581, 593, 611, 653 and 708 nm, corresponding to the 5D0\u21927FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions, respectively. When the Eu3+ doping concentration increases, the luminescent performance is integrally enhanced due to the preferential occupation and energy transfer between the Eu3+ ions at multisites in the lattice. As the Eu3+ doping concentration is 9%, the phosphor shows the maximum emission intensity, the closest color coordinates with the standard red light as (0.646, 0.354) and excellent thermal stability as the emission intensity at 423 K remains 89% of that measured at room temperature. Various crystallographic sites for Eu3+ provide suitable modification and optimization of the multisite luminescence to realize high-quality applications of the novel phosphors [77,78]. Furthermore, Eu is a lanthanide element with two different valence states, that exhibits various types of emission in the luminescent materials. The valence-state transfer between divalent and trivalent Eu ions in a single-phase multi-site phosphor is a promising strategy to obtain warm white light. The luminescence can be modified via the structural evolution of the multi-site compounds. Figure 7a illustrates the structure model of Sr2LiSiO4F with two kinds of Sr sites [79]. Due to the substitution of the Sr2+-Al3+ pair by the Li+-Si4+ pair, the local structure of Sr sites where activator ions are doped is changed, as shown in Figure 7b. This results in the compression of Eu2+-occupation and the stabilization of Eu3+occupation at the Sr sites, especially in the reducing atmosphere. As for the luminescence performance shown in Figure 7c, the Sr2LiSiO4F:Eu phosphor exhibits broadband green emission due to the characteristic transition of Eu2+. After the cation-pair substitution, the Sr1.95+xLi1-xSi1-xAlxO4F:0.05Eu (x = 0.05) phosphor shows not only broadband green emission that is similar to the x = 0 sample, but also a series of sharp-line emissions due to the characteristic transition of Eu3+.

The decay curve of the sample is better fitted with the triple-exponential model, that shows three crystallographic sites of Eu, as shown in Figure 10c. To further investigate the activator occupation, the timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum is measured. It shows a slower decay in the lower-energy region than in the higher-energy region. The PL spectra at different temperature and transient fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify the multiple luminescence centers [37]. The fitted lifetime monitored at different wavelengths obtained by the decay curve measurements can represent the preferential occupation of the activator ions among the several luminescence centers.

Figure 12a depicts the formation energies (\u2206Ef) for Eu2+-substitution at the Ca sites for various structural models [95]. The calculations show that Eu ions prefer to occupy the Ca4 site, followed by the Ca3 and the Ca1/Ca2 sites in turn; however, they do not prefer to occupy the Ca5 site in the Ca3(PO4)2 lattice. Corresponding to the calculated energy levels of Eu2+ shown in Figure 12b, the luminescence of Ca3(PO4)2:Eu2+ can be deconstructed as the 418 nm emission due to Eu2+ at the Ca4 site. The broadband emission peaked at 630 nm attributed to Eu2+ at the Ca1-Ca3 site, and the shorter and longer-wavelength components are caused by Eu2+ at the Ca3 and the Ca1/Ca2 sites, respectively. The occurrence probability (Pj) can be evaluated to quantify the relative preference of the\nactivator ions doping, which can be measured by the formula Pj = 1ztot \u2126iexp ( \u2212 EikT ) [34]. In the formula, ztot represents the partition function, \u2126i represents the multiplicity, k is the Boltzmann constant, Ei represents the relative total energy of the unit cell and T is the synthesis temperature.

As for the luminescence behavior of Eu3+, the total relative integrated intensity (I = \u2211J=0\u22126 7FJ ) is proportional to the total radiative transition rate for 5D0-7FJ transition. The relevant computational formulas are complex, and are not expressed one by one.

This has been the cla sic method for the modification of luminescence perfor a ce. As for the multi-site luminescent materia s, cation substitution results in more varied changes and can even induce the a tivator io s to occupy some seemingly impo sibl crystallographic ites. Fo instance, the Ca9La(PO4)7 la tice poss sses three different Ca sit and one La site (Ca1, Ca2, Ca3 a d , respectively [89]). Because of the similar lattice nvironment and valence state, the Eu2+ activator ions prefer to dominate the three Ca sites to show multi-site luminescence as an asymmetrical broadband emission, shown in Figure 13c. Based on the calculations of the radius percentage difference, the results prove that the Ca2+ can be successfully introduced into the only La3+ site in the lattice. The Ca2+-cation-substitution leads to the Eu2+ activator ions being doped at the La3+ site; this exhibits significant changes to the shapes of the emission band, as illustrated\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 21 of 29\nin Figure 13d. Similarly, other divalent alkaline earth metal ions are introduced into the lattice to replace the lanthanide; these create potential crystallographic sites for the Eu2+ activator ions and achieve effective spectral regulation in the multi-site phosphors. Moreover, an anion substitution strategy can also affect the local structure of the multisites for the activator ions. The Li4SrCa(SiO4)2 lattice provides one kind of Ca site and one kind of Sr site; these can be dominated by the Eu2+ activator ions, as shown in Figure 14e [98]. A multi-site luminescence with the combination of a blue emission and an orange emission is observed. With the substitution of N3\u2212 for O2\u2212, the Eu-O polyhedron is distorted and the preferential occupation of Eu2+ is changed. The result is that the blue emission gradually decreases as the orange emission gradually enhances, as shown in Figure 14f. Hence, the multi-site regulation strategy can modify the emission spectrum to achieve various luminescent performances."

It is determined by the structure rigidity, band gap, crystal defects and other local structures of the luminescent materials [101]. The evolution of multi-site structure can achieve the enhancement of thermal stability. As shown in Figure 3d, an appropriate Sr-substitution into the Ba9Lu2Si6O24:Eu2+ lattice can improve the thermal stability because the Eu2+ ions prefer to dominate the Ba2 site with higher rigidity, gradually increasing the Sr-substituted concentration from 0 to 0.3 [26]. However, as the Sr-substituted concentration increases further, the Eu2+ ions are induced to partially occupy the Ba3 site with lower rigidity, which results in lower thermal stability. As for the multi-site phosphors, different crystallographic sites for the activator ions exhibit different local structure characteristics, meaning the regulation of local structure affects thermal performance. As for Eu2+-activated Ba2Ln(BO3)2Cl, their emission spectra are centered at 526, 548 and 511 nm, as shown in Figure 14c, with the FWHM of 97, 108 and 91 nm for the Ln = Y, Gd and Lu, respectively [99]. Their broadband emissions are attributed to the multisites for the activator ions, as with the Ba1 and Ba2 sites, as illustrated in Figure 14d. As for the Ln = Gd and Lu samples, the emission intensity decreases gradually as the temperature increases. However, the Ln = Y sample exhibits an abnormal thermal phenomenon; the emission intensity increases and then declines slightly when temperature is more than 200 \u25e6C, as shown in Figure 14e. The special thermal phenomenon is attributed to the different luminescence efficiency of the multi-site emission centers, which is further proved by the theoretical calculation of the activation energy of thermal quenching. Furthermore, constructing energy transfer is an effective way to enhance the multi-site luminescence performance. As shown in Figure 14f, the emission intensity of Tb3+ in Ba1.2Ca0.8SiO4 can be improved by 30 times due to the co-doping of Ce3+ and Tb3+ [100]. The multi-site luminescence of Ce3+ in the lattice induces the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+, which significantly enhances the luminescence performance of the co-doped phosphors."

            "text": "Besides high-quality lighting for wLEDs, multi-site luminescence has also been applied in non-contact optical thermometric technology for temperature measurements in thermally harsh, corrosive or intracellular environments [102]. Initially, the temperature sensing property is revealed by the double emission intensity ratio between the thermally coupled energy levels (TCELs) of lanthanide ions, such as Er3+, Ho3+, Tm3+, Sm3+, Yb3+, Dy3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, etc. [36]. However, the difference of their TCELs is too narrow to obtain high sensitivity and strong recognition ability. To further improve the optical thermometric property, the multisite luminescence of Eu2+, Ce3+, Cr3+, Mn2+ or other kinds of activators that are susceptible to the external crystal field gradually attracted more attention [48,82]. Hence, many relevant studies concerning the application of multi-site phosphors for optical thermometric properties, that have been mentioned many times before, have been reported recently. According to the requirements of the non-contact optical thermometric technology, multi-site luminescence should be characterized by fast response, high precision and high spatial-temporal resolution [102,103]. Based on the temperature measurement related to the fluorescence intensity ratios (FIR), temperature-dependent absolute sensitivity (Sa) and relative sensitivity (Sr) can represent the optical thermometric property of the phosphors [35,98]. The measurement methods and calculation formula will not be repeated here, as they can easily be found in several papers [104]. The temperature-dependent sensitivity can exhibit the applicable temperature range and potential. For example, Ca9NaZn(PO4)7 is an multi-site structure for luminescence (crystal structure model is shown in Figure 15a) that provides a variety of possibilities for the activator ions, including three types of Ca sites (Ca1, Ca2 and Ca3), an Na site, etc. [105]. As shown in Figure 15b, the Eu2+-doped Ca9NaZn(PO4)7 phosphor exhibits an asymmetric broad emission band with peaks at around 415, 490 and 570 nm due to the 5d-4f transition of Eu2+ at Ca3, Ca1/Ca2 and Na sites, respectively. The Mg2+-substitution in the Ca9NaZn(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor adjusts the emission from yellow to warm white via an increased red-emitting component; this\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 23 of 29\nachieves good optical properties for wLEDs. The three sub-emissions of the multi-site luminescence shows different temperature-dependent performance, as shown in Figure 15c. As the temperature increases, the emission intensity of Eu2+ in Na site decreases significantly, and the Eu2+ at Ca3 site changes slightly. This might be attributed to the local crystal structure of each crystallographic site. According to the FIR calculation, the maximum Sa is 0.0228 K\u22121 at 498 K and the maximum Sr is 0.81 K\u22121 at 398 K (as shown in Figure 15d). This confirms the promising application of the Ca9NaZn(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor for optical thermometry. Interestingly, the Ca9NaZn(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor is sensitive not only temperature, but also pressure, as shown in Figure 15e,f. With an increase of pressure from 0.65 to 6.12 GPa, the FWHM of emission bands for Eu2+ in Ca1/Ca2 sites are enlarged gradually. With an increase of pressure from 6.12 to 16.48 GPa, the emission bands and their intensities for Eu2+ in three luminescence centers are regulated significantly. In addition, the peaks shift from 410 to 423 nm, 502 to 552 nm and 580 to 627 nm for Eu2+\nin the Ca3, Ca1/Ca2 and Na sites, respectively. The reduced symmetry, an increase in generated defects and increased phonon energy caused by pressure increasing lead to the broadening of FWHMs, as the larger nephelauxetic effect and stronger crystal field splitting due to structural shrinkage by pressure increase results in the red-shift of emission peaks. The Ca9NaZn(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor shows a better pressure sensitivity (5.21 nm/GPa) and exhibits very close CIE chromaticity parameters under the same pressure during the compression and decompression processes. This demonstrates its potential application for optical pressure sensors.Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 of 31\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 24 of 29"

            "text": "Our review describes the construction, identification and regulation of the multisite luminescence based on research and investigations conducted over the past 20 years. First, several types of host materials with various crystallographic sites for activator ions to construct multi-site phosphor are introduced in detail, and multi-site luminescence characteristics of different activator ions are summarized, including Eu2+, Ce3+, Cr3+, Eu3+, Mn2+, Mn4+, Bi3+, etc. Second, identification of the preferential occupation for the activator ions is difficult but essential to reveal the structural characteristics and modify the optical performance for the multi-site phosphors. Using optical analysis, structural analysis and theoretical calculations, several measurements and methods are evaluated and elucidated to clarify the multi-site luminescence. Third, based on the clear understanding of the structure and optical properties, the regulation strategies of multi-site luminescence and their representative work are introduced and discussed in terms of modification of emission spectrum, enhancement of luminescence performance, applications on advanced fields, etc. According to the review of various experimental, theoretical and applied results, we conclude that there are still several important and necessary challenges for multi-site luminescence that must be investigated and developed in future, including but not limited to the following:\n(1) Design of a novel multi-site phosphor with excellent luminescent performance is still an ongoing mission. Achieving delicate control of emission color during the design process is essential for the material science. Recently, several approaches have been carried out to discover new materials based on known or unknown crystal structures that can be used to find multi-site hosts, such as solid-state combinatorial chemistry, single crystal growth, single-particle-diagnosis, etc. Furthermore, materials genome engineering and big data computing can be introduced to design a novel multi-site phosphor. Based on a high-quality material database and using scientific and accurate criteria, high throughput screening and experimental verification can effectively achieve the development of new luminescent materials. In the above approach, the mineral structure model, phase diagram, thermodynamics, energy band theory and other basic theories can guide the screening and optimization of new materials. (2) Optimization of luminescence properties of multi-site phosphors is still an important challenge. An excellent phosphor material should have strong absorption, strong emission, high luminous efficiency, high stability, etc. Generally, delicate compositional tailoring is a valid strategy to modify the surrounding crystal environment of activator ions to enhance luminescence performance, such as cation substitution, anion substitution, solid solution substitution, constructing energy transfer, etc. However, the origin of multi-site luminescence is complicated; as such, accurate directional regulation is difficult. The first principles calculation equipped with high-throughput computation and machine learning will be helpful to effectively analyze the relationship of structure and properties, which could be a promising strategy for optimization of multi-site luminescent materials. (3) Achieving wider and deeper advanced applications of multi-site phosphors is an eternal goal. Multi-site luminescent materials have been used in high-quality fullspectrum lighting due to their broad and tunable emission. Many multi-site NIR phosphors have been developed for use in security monitoring, food composition analysis, bio-sensing, etc. Recently, the applications in non-contact temperature testing have attracted significant attention and have been summarized specifically. The emission intensity and material stability of these applied phosphors must be improved further. Multi-site phosphors with better performance will obtain wider and deeper advanced applications, and could be customized according to the specific multi-site luminescence characteristics.\nWith the higher requirements of applications, the study and research of multi-site luminescence will never stop. We hope our review will provide some inspiration for the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2179 25 of 29\ndesign and modification of the multi-site phosphors, even in the wider field of luminescent materials or other materials science.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014original draft, J.T.; investigation, J.T. and J.X.; writing\u2013review & editing, J.T.; J.X. and W.Z.; funding acquisition, W.Z. and J.T.
