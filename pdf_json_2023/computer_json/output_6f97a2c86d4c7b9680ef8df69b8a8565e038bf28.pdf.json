    "abstractText": "Energy theft is a significant problem that needs to be addressed for effective energy management in smart cities. Smart meters are highly utilized in smart cities that help in monitoring the energy utilization level and provide information to the users. However, it is not able to detect energy theft or over-usage. Therefore, we have proposed a multi-objective diagnosing structure named an Energy Theft Prevention System (ETPS) to detect energy theft. The proposed system utilizes a combination of machine learning techniques Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (DDRCNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The statistical validation has been performed using the simple moving average (SMA) method. The results obtained from the simulation have been compared with the existing technique in terms of delivery ratio, throughput, delay, overhead, energy conversation, and network lifetime. The result shows that the proposed system is more effective than existing systems.",

            "text": "The concept of a smart city refers to an urban environment that has been augmented with advanced technologies, enabling it to gather and analyze data for the purpose of improving the quality of life for its residents. The concept of a smart city encompasses various domains, including citizens, mobility, healthcare, technology, government, energy, and infrastructure, as seen in Fig.\u00a0 1\u00a0 [1]. Modern technology incorporates\u00a0 the Internet of Things (IoT) based smart peripherals, which help to provide a sophisticated lifestyle. Especially, smart technologies are highly utilized in cities where smart meters are utilized rather than utilizing convolutional meters. In smart cities, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) based technologies are enabled for effective information exchange by smart meters with IoT devices, which can be adapted to various locations based\u00a0 on requirements [2, 3]. Due to its complex nature, endusers\u00a0may face difficulties in utilizing its full benefits. It is challenging to collect massive data, and the speed is possibly less [4, 5]. On the other hand, a smart city enables various functionalities to its infrastructure by adopting an effective communication medium, forecasting devices, and making changes in system design and its architecture [6]. *Correspondence: Monir Abdullah makaid@tu.edu.ye 1 College of Computing and Information Technology, University of Bisha, 67714 Bisha, Saudi Arabia 2 College of Computing and Information Sciences, University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Ibri, Sultanate of Oman 3 College of Computer Science & IT, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia 4 College of Applied Computer Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 5 Computer Science and Information Systems, Thamar University, Dhamar, Yemen\nThe advanced technologies provide few applications such as reliability of energy consumption, control, and monitoring [7]. This paper implements a Demand Side Management System (DSMS) for effective management and controls the level of energy saving and power consumption in smart cities. The objective of energy saving has broadened research to improve DSMS techniques such as static cost management, load transfer, economic forecasting, and the size of the system. These achievements have been enhanced to utilize statistical modeling and machine learning [8].\nIn the energy efficiency industry, they include algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Simple Moving Average (SMA), Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DDRCNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In energy theft detection, the dataset can be undefended. Theft of energy is becoming an increasingly pressing problem in various countries worldwide. Even so, few energy theft prevention methods have been developed to resist this problem. Zhou Y.et al. proposed a dynamic algorithm to improve the performance analysis for optimal energy theft detection. This system provides the assignment of a Feeder Remote Terminal Unit (FRTU), resulting in extra customer costs. Liu Y. and Hu S. planned a detective method with an average detection precision of 92.55%. This proposed detection method combines the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with Bollinger Bands-Based\nDetection. In the home atmosphere, the above conditions are not affecting the home appliances.\nInitially, household consumption data has been constant for 24-hour energy consumption [9, 10]. Energy consumption per hour is not zero. The following condition of the Bollinger Band method is that the rejection can only be reported within a constant range of power consumption. However, when the power consumption range becomes more due to deviation, the Bollinger Band system cannot be utilized. The article suggests a new awareness of an ETPS for a smart city. This theft energy detective process is reliable and more efficient than the earlier methods. Due to the discreet data collection method [11], we implement an energy monitoring system that can save energy. The data collection process contains energy consumption from actual time-series data in an uncontrolled home environment [12\u201316]. In this work, we provide information about the problems of existing technologies in smart cities. We present problems and research gaps as below:\n\u2022 Data management is becoming a highly difficult task in the smart environment due to the\u00a0 tremendous development of massive data. One of the considerable issues in the smart environment is energy theft; it should be focused on reducing by implementing a security system. \u2022 Lacking better optimization in the presence of constraints\n\u2022 In the existing technology, the optimization technique utilized for analyzing the presence of constraints is not effective; therefore, there is a need for implementing better optimization. \u2022 The performance of the existing technology is not providing better results. So, the need for enhancing performance and efficiency is highly demanded.\nThe contributions of this work are as follows:\n\u2022 To propose a mechanism to detect the energy theft in the smart cities. \u2022 To propose a machine learning algorithm to make the decision faster and more accurate. \u2022 To analyze the network parameters and their effect on energy theft.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: \"Background of study\" section presents a literature review of energy theft and prevention. \"Materials and methods\" section presents the proposed methodology for the Energy Theft Prevention System. \"Results and discussion\"\u00a0section presents the simulation and result analysis. Finally, \"Conclusion\" section presents the conclusion and future work."

[17] recommended the following plan: a science research cycle to create and assess a displaying system that intends to examine the utilization of Internet Control Message Protocol\u00a0 (ICMP) information to perceive collaboration and conditions in shrewd city areas. This article gives a short portrayal of the plan and use of the system and clarifies the plan information picked up during the preparation. Neural organization and affectability investigation can be utilized as an apparatus to characterize these objectives. To test the practicality of this idea, two models of coordinated wrongdoing on board in shrewd urban communities were created and assessed. The examination results demonstrated that the model models were compelling in foreseeing wrongdoing, showing an adequate relationship between the wrongdoing factors and the boundaries utilized in this investigation to affirm the utilization of altered KPI Smart Cities. for wrongdoing location. This article, accordingly, analyzes the utilization of the proposed displaying structure on the degree of momentary administration.\nRidhima Rani et\u00a0al. [18] have proposed that this study provides an overview of the literature on the role of the Internet of Things and cloud ecosystems in smart cities, as well as evaluation parameters and future research guidelines in smart cities. The whole conversations and discussions between experts and architects on topics\nrelated to smart cities and advances on the Internet of Things must be constantly revived to ensure clear action plans. The remaining problems and the directions of their research are described. Most of these surveys overlook real-time systems in smart cities. This control method encourages the study of a large number of references in the future to deal with critical applications in time and in real-time.\nMengmeng Wang et\u00a0al. [19] have proposed an investigation that has ventured out this heading by investigating the all-inclusive advancement cycles of savvy urban communities to accomplish this assessed execution and productivity of 32 shrewd urban areas in China somewhere in the range of 2012 and 2017. Those urban areas are partitioned into four classes as indicated by normal execution and proficiency. The cycle of changes in the savvy urban communities was planned somewhere in the range of 2012 and 2017, at that point, additionally, three essential patterns of execution and proficiency were distinguished. The last status coming to the 32 urban areas was anticipated by the three patterns. To all the more adequately executed brilliant city activities, two transformative courses for shrewd urban areas are proposed.

This work is developed related to the Internet of Things (IoT) based advanced technique for monitoring the resource utilization and energy consumption with the utilization of advanced metering technology [14, 15]. In the smart city, energy management is considered as a significant task for preventing the energy loss from unauthorized utilization [11, 16].\nProposed system for\u00a0energy theft prevention In smart cities, the Demand Side Management System (DSMS) is utilized for gathering demand-based information to determine the optimal energy consumption, such as unloading program during peak hours, after that to allow the use of electricity markets. In specific, with this technology, the user can be enabled to monitor the smart appliance on mobile devices. Moreover, there is a need to improve the data collection mechanism of a smart city by considering the cost-effective and energyefficient technology by analyzing the history of user\u2019s early activities by consumption patterns. However, the energy theft is serious, and it causes the reason for the failure of various countries [7]. Therefore, it is becoming a big issue, and massive research are being held for reducing its impact on smart cities [12]. Thus, the reason for the development of smart meter, it provides a digital report about energy losses in a particular area [8]. Methods of energy theft include hacking smart city devices and plugging other households directly into the power grid. Other techniques that include are mechanisms, manipulating data through cloud storage, and tampering with the smart meter\u2019s software. Accordingly, attackers can diminish their power utilization by controlling different families through hacking and altering to create power use, since the complete bill of all customers in the network stays unaltered. An illustration of energy robbery conditions appears in Fig.\u00a02 which has energy data as input and alerts/advisory and actions as output. The proposed has deployed machine learning algorithm such as GWO, DRCNN, LSTM and GRU to predict the power consumptions.\nIn this particular area, the energy theft can be occurred due to the person utilizing the connection of one user with their knowledge; the intruders steal the connection of a user and utilize it for their own usage. This causes the reason for the high energy consumption rate for a victimized user; therefore, they need the smart and effective system to prevent energy theft with the utilization of smart prediction devices to reduce the electricity bill. The ultimate purpose of proposing the ETPS is to provide a warning about energy theft to the consumers by\nalerting them at the right time. This technology is based on gathering by utilizing monitoring and analyzing the data for detecting energy theft by continuous monitoring. In our proposed technology, we incorporated three levels of process where initially data gathering process, prediction model, and decision making model. The proposed work is based on multi-objective prediction framework where we utilized machine learning technique to provide better prediction. The techniques utilized in this work are Grey Wolf Optimization, DRCNN, LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit. With the utilization of these techniques, the abnormality in the energy consumption range can be predicted and compare the reading with actual data. Then, the ETPS plays the role for decisionmaking with the utilization of a statistical model (Simple Moving Average) SMA to separate the anonymous activities from the initial stage. Finally, the ETPS is a historybased decision-making model. The remaining stages can be filtered through the subsequent section and whether choose energy burglary happened. In the wake of taking an official conclusion, the entire cycle will be rehashed with the following approaching information. ETPS is best actualized with an autonomous equipment framework straightforwardly at the keen meters, this is because any impedance for energy robbery, paying little need to alter equipment or control of information, can be recognized. It is more exactly contrasted with simply observing the information from the cloud or administrator\u2019s data set, the same number of different components may influence the examination."

Due to their widespread ability to solve complex problems, many GWOs have been designed to optimize the outcome for different types of problems. The Recurrent Conventional Neural Network (DRCNN) DRCNN is one of the models in artificial neural network. The data sequences, namely, images, numeric data, and time series text patterns are examined by the usage of artificial neural network. This powerful artificial neural network organization is utilized in enterprises, for example, sensors, stock trades, and government offices. The complete (extended) DRCNN network, this network can be completely sequenced in another network organization. The three digital values are placed in series, the neural network system is formed in three layers, and it is released to the network system which maintains each layer to combine all digital numbers.\nThe mathematical representation of an DRCNN happens as given below:\nWhere,pt is related to the current memory in the step time t and it is denoted by the predicted output.st is the Hidden state that employed in network memory; then it analyses and gives the information for any critical situation arrives in the preceding step over time and it is the most important in DRCNN.

However, if the difference is large, DRCNN will not do able to combine the data together to start the learning process. To address long-term dependence problems, a particular variety of DRCNN estimated long-term memory networks (LSTMs) was formed.

In the proposed system we are dependent on the structed and formatted data coming from smart cities, however, this is not always possible. The proposed system can work with guided data only, which is a limitation. In future work, we plan to improve the performance analysis and data format independent of the proposed system to get better results.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions Mohammad Tabrez Quasim, Khair ul Nisa, Mohammad Zunnun Khan and Mohammad Shahid Husain data curation, and methodology, Shadab Alam, Mohammed Shuaib, Mohammad Meraj and Monir Abdullah software and writing.
