    "abstractText": "The NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer provide a framework on which to base decisions regarding theworkupof patients with prostate cancer, risk stratification and management of localized disease, posttreatment monitoring, and treatment of recurrence and advanced disease. The Guidelines sections included in this article focus on the management of metastatic castration-sensitive disease, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with treatment intensification is strongly recommended for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. For patients with nonmetastatic CRPC, ADT is continued with or without the addition of certain secondary hormone therapies depending on prostate-specific antigen doubling time. In the mCRPC setting, ADT is continued with the sequential addition of certain secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel emphasizes a shared decisionmaking approach in all disease settings based on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, the presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and potential side effects.

            "text": "An estimated 288,300 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2023, accounting for 29% of new cancer cases in men.1 It is the most common cancer in men in the United States, who currently have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer.1 The incidence of prostate cancer declined by approximately 40% from 2007 to 2014, but since that time has increased at a rate of 3% annually. This increase is driven by a rise in the diagnosis of regional and metastatic disease, which may be a result of declining rates of prostate specific antigen PSA testing that followed the 2012 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations against it.2\u201310\nResearchers further estimate that prostate cancer will account for 11% of male cancer deaths in the United States in 2023, with an estimated 34,700 deaths.1 The ageadjusted death rate from prostate cancer declined by 52% from 1993 to 2017, but the death rate has become more stable in recent years, with a 0.6% annual decrease from 2013 through 2020.1 For all stages combined, the 5-year relative survival rate for prostate cancer is 97%.1 The comparatively low death rate suggests that increased public awareness with earlier detection and treatment has affected mortality from this prevalent cancer, but death rate is also complicated by screening-related lead-time bias\nand detection of indolent cancers. Maintenance of this low death rate is threatened by the rising prostate cancer incidence and diagnosis of advanced disease.\nUnfortunately, large inequities exist in incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer across racial and ethnic groups. The incidence rate in Black individuals is 70% higher than in white individuals, and the mortality rate in this population is 2- to 4-times higher than all other racial and ethnic groups.1 In addition, the mortality rate for American Indian/Alaska Native populations is higher than for white individuals.\nThe USPSTF released updated recommendations in 2018 that include individualized, informed decisionmaking regarding prostate cancer screening in men aged 55 to 69 years.11 These updated recommendations may allow for a more balanced approach to prostate cancer early detection, and evidence suggests that prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing rates increased after the USPSTF\u2019s draft statement was released in 2017.12 Better use of PSA for early detection of potentially fatal prostate cancer coupled with the use of imaging and biomarkers to improve the specificity of screening should decrease the risk of overdetection (see the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at NCCN.org). This reduced overdetection along with the use of active surveillance in appropriate patients should reduce overtreatment\n1068 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023\nand preserve the relatively low rates of prostate cancer mortality."

            "text": "Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer In February 2018, the FDA approved abiraterone in combination with prednisone for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. This approval was based on 2 randomized phase III clinical trials of abiraterone and low-dose prednisone plus ADT in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer or high-risk or node-positive disease (STAMPEDE and LATITUDE) that demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) over ADT alone.13\nIn LATITUDE, 1,199 patients with high-risk, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer were randomized to abiraterone with prednisone 5 mg once daily or matching placebos. High-risk disease was defined as at least 2 of the following: Gleason score 8\u201310,$3 bone metastases, and visceral metastases.13 Efficacy was demonstrated at the first interim analysis, and the trial was unblinded. The primary endpoint of OS was met and favored abiraterone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51\u20130.76; P,.0001). Estimated 3-year OS rates improved from 49% to 66% at 30 months follow-up. Secondary endpoints were improved and included delayed castration-resistant radiographic progression (from median 14.8\u201333.2 months), PSA progression (7.4\u201333.2 months), time to pain progression, and initiation of chemotherapy.\nJNCCN.org | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023 1069\nAfter the first interim analysis, 72 patients crossed over from placebo to abiraterone. Final OS analysis of LATITUDE after a median follow-up of 51.8 months showedmedian OS was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group (53.3 vs 36.5 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56\u20130.78; P,.0001).14\nAdverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were generally mild in nature and largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie, hypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot flushes), and liver toxicity.13 Cardiac events, such as atrial fibrillation, were rare but slightly increased with abiraterone. The overall discontinuation rate due to side effects was 12%. Patient-reported outcomes were improved with the addition of abiraterone, with improvements in pain intensity progression, fatigue, functional decline, prostate cancer-related symptoms, and overall health-related quality of life (QOL).15 A limitation of this trial is that only 27% of placebo-treated patients received abiraterone or enzalutamide at progression, and only 52% of these patients received any life-prolonging therapy.13\nThe second randomized trial (STAMPEDE) of 1,917 patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer showed similar OS benefits.16 However, unlike LATITUDE, STAMPEDE eligibility permitted patients with high-risk N0,M0 disease (2 of 3 high-risk factors: stage T3/4, PSA\n.40, or Gleason score 8\u201310; n5509), or N1,M0 disease (pelvic nodal metastases; n5369) in addition to patients with M1 disease, who made up the majority of patients (n5941). Most patients were newly diagnosed, and a minority had recurrent, high-risk, or metastatic disease after local therapy (n598). Thus, STAMPEDEwas a heterogeneous mix of patients with high-risk, nonmetastatic, node-positive, or M1 disease. In patients with M1 disease, treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone was continued until progression. In patients with N1 or M0 disease, 2 years of abiraterone plus prednisolone was used if curative-intent EBRT was used. OS was improved in the overall population (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.5\u20130.76; P,.0001) and in the M1 and N1 subsets, without any heterogeneity of treatment effect by metastatic status. The survival benefit of abiraterone was larger in patients,70 years of age than those$70 years (HR, 0.94 vs HR, 0.51). Patients $70 years also experienced increased toxicities, which suggests heterogeneity in clinical benefits by age and comorbidity. The secondary endpoint of failure-free survival, which included PSA recurrence, was improved overall (HR, 0.29; P,.0001) and in all subgroups regardless of M1 (HR, 0.31), N1 (HR, 0.29), or M0 (HR, 0.21) status. No heterogeneity for failure-free survival was observed based on subgroups or by age. In this trial, subsequent life-prolonging therapy was received by\n1070 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023\n58% of those in the control group, which included 22% who received abiraterone and 26% who received enzalutamide. Thus, these data reflect a survival advantage of initial abiraterone in newly diagnosed patients compared with deferring therapy to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) setting.\nAdverse events in STAMPEDE were similar to those reported in LATITUDE, but were increased in patients $70 years, with higher incidences of grade 3\u20135 adverse events with abiraterone (47% vs 33%) and 9 versus 3 treatment-related deaths. Severe hypertension or cardiac disorders were noted in 10% of patients and grade 3\u20135 liver toxicity in 7%, which illustrates the need for blood pressure and renal and hepatic function monitoring.\nTaken together, these data led the NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel to recommend abiraterone with 5 mg once daily prednisone as a treatment option with ADT for patients with newly diagnosed, M1, castration-sensitive prostate cancer (category 1). Alternatively, the fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used (category 2B; see \u201cAbiraterone Acetate inM1CRPC,\u201d page 1076).\nAbiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered after a low-fat breakfast as an alternative to the dose of 1,000 mg/day after an overnight fast (see \u201cAbiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC,\u201d page 1076).17 The cost savings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence."

The primary endpoint of OS was met at the first interim analysis with median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52\u20130.86; P5.002). Enzalutamide also improved secondary endpoints, such as PFS using PSA levels and clinical PFS. An additional analysis was triggered at 470 deaths.22 After a median follow-up of 68 months, the 5-yearOS ratewas again lower in thefirst-generationantiandrogen group than in the enzalutamide group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.84; P,.0001).

Adverse events associated with enzalutamide in these trials included fatigue, seizures, andhypertension.21,23\nEnzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-sensitive prostate cancer.

            "text": "Most advanced disease eventually stops responding to traditional ADT and is categorized as castration-resistant (also known as castration-recurrent). CRPC is prostate cancer that progresses clinically, radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum testosterone (,50 ng/dL).32 Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC during primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a castrate level of testosterone (,50 ng/dL; ,1.7 nmol/L). Imaging tests may be indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases. Factors affecting the frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health, PSA velocity, and Gleason grade.\nFor patients who develop CRPC, ADT with an LHRH agonist or antagonist should be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone (,50 ng/dL).\nPatients with CRPC and no signs of distant metastasis on conventional imaging studies (M0) can consider monitoring with continued ADT if PSA doubling time (PSADT) is greater than 10 months (preferred), because these patients will have a relatively indolent disease history.33 Secondary hormone therapy with continued ADT is an option mainly for patients with shorter PSADT (#10 months) as described subsequently.\nFor patients who develop mCRPC, metastatic lesion biopsy is recommended, as is microsatellite instability\n(MSI)/mismatch repair (MMR) testing, if not previously performed. If MSI-high (MSI-H) or deficient MMR (dMMR) is found, referral to genetic counseling should be made to assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome. These patients should also have germline and tumor testing to check for mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM , PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, CDK12) if not done previously.34 This information may be used for genetic counseling, early use of platinum chemotherapy, or understanding eligibility for biomarkerdirected treatments or clinical trials. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) testing should also be considered for patients with mCRPC to inform possible use of pembrolizumab in later lines of therapy (see \u201cPembrolizumab,\u201d page 1084).\nADT is continued in patients with mCRPC while additional therapies, including secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies, are sequentially applied, as discussed in the subsequent sections; all patients should receive best supportive care. The panel defined treatment options for patients with mCRPC based on previous exposure to docetaxel and to a novel hormone therapy. Novel hormone therapies include abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide. Abiraterone given as part of neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant ADT with EBRT is not consideredprior novel hormonal therapy.\nJNCCN.org | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023 1075\nThe decision to initiate therapy in the CRPC setting after disease progression on one or more treatments should be based on the available high-level evidence of safety, efficacy, and tolerability of these agents and the application of this evidence to an individual patient. Prior exposures to therapeutic agents should be considered. Data to inform the optimal sequence for delivery of these agents in patients with mCRPC is limited (see \u201cSequencing of Therapy inCRPC,\u201d page 1091). Choice of therapy is based largely on clinical considerations, which include patient preferences, prior treatment, presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, andpotential side effects.\nNCCN recommends that patients being treated for CRPC be closely monitored with radiologic imaging (ie, CT, bone imaging), PSA tests, and clinical exams for evidence of progression. Therapy should be continued until clinical progression or intolerability, with consideration of the fact that even in cases inwhich PSA remains undetectable, bone imaging may reveal progression.35,36 The sequential use of these agents is reasonable in apatientwho remains a candidate for further systemic therapy. Clinical trial and best supportive care are additional options."

In the final analysis, median survival was 15.8 versus 11.2 months in the abiraterone and placebo arm, respectively (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.86; P,.0001).40 Time to radiographic progression, PSA decline, and pain palliation alsowere improved by abiraterone.40,41\nFDA approval in the pre-docetaxel setting occurred in December 2012 and was based on the randomized\n1076 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023\nphase III COU-AA-302 trial of abiraterone and prednisone (n5546) versus prednisone alone (n5542) in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, mCRPC.42 Most participants in this trial were not taking narcotics for cancer pain and none had visceral metastatic disease or prior ketoconazole exposure. The coprimary endpoint of radiographic PFS was improved by treatment from 8.3 to 16.5 months (HR, 0.53; P,.001). OS was improved at final analysis with a median follow-up of 49.2 months (34.7 vs 30.3 months; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70\u20130.93; P5.003).43 Key secondary endpoints of time to symptomatic deterioration, time to chemotherapy initiation, time to pain progression, and PSA PFS improved significantly with abiraterone treatment; PSA declines (62% vs 24% with .50% decline) and radiographic responses (36% vs 16% RECIST responses) weremore common.\nThemost common adverse reactions with abiraterone/ prednisone (.5%) were fatigue (39%); back or joint discomfort (28%\u201332%); peripheral edema (28%); diarrhea, nausea, or constipation (22%); hypokalemia (17%); hypophosphatemia (24%); atrial fibrillation (4%); muscle discomfort (14%); hot flushes (22%); urinary tract infection; cough; hypertension (22%, severe hypertension in 4%); urinary frequency and nocturia; dyspepsia; or upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse drug reactions that resulted in drug discontinuation were\nincreased aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase (11%\u201312%), or cardiac disorders (19%, serious in 6%).\nIn May 2018, the FDA approved a novel, fine-particle formulation of abiraterone, in combination with methylprednisolone, for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. In studies of healthy males, this formulation at 500 mg was shown to be bioequivalent to 1,000 mg of the originator formulation.44,45 In a phase II therapeutic equivalence study, 53 patients with mCRPC who were not treated previously with abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, or chemotherapy (docetaxel for mCRPC completed $1 year before enrollment was allowed) were randomized to 500mg daily of the new, fine-particle formulation plus 4mgmethylprednisolone orally twice daily or to 1,000mg of the originator formulation daily plus 5 mg prednisone orally twice daily.46 Bioequivalence of these doses was confirmed based on serum testosterone levels, PSA response, and abiraterone pharmacokinetics. The rates of total and grade 3/4 adverse events were similar between the arms, withmusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders occurring more frequently in the originator-treated patients (37.9% vs 12.5%). The panel believes that the fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the original formulation of abiraterone in the treatment of patients with mCRPC (category 2A).\nJNCCN.org | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023 1077\nBased on the studies described here, abiraterone is a category 1, preferred option for mCRPC without prior novel hormone therapy. For patients with mCRPC and prior novel hormone therapy, abiraterone is included in the \u201cother recommended regimens\u201d category. The fineparticle formulation of abiraterone is included under \u201cother recommended options\u201d in all mCRPC settings.\nAbiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid (either oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily or oral methylprednisolone 4 mg twice daily, depending on which formulation is given) to abrogate signs of mineralocorticoid excess that can result from treatment. These signs include hypertension, hypokalemia, and peripheral edema. Thus, monitoring of liver function, potassium and phosphate levels, and blood pressure readings on a monthly basis is warranted during abiraterone therapy. Symptom-directed assessment for cardiac disease also is warranted, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.\nA randomized phase II noninferiority study of 75 patients with M1 CRPC compared 1,000 mg/day abiraterone after an overnight fast with 250 mg/day after a low-fat breakfast.17 The primary endpoint was log change in PSA, with secondary endpoints of PSA response ($50%) and PFS. The primary endpoint favored the low-dose arm (log change in PSA, 21.59 vs 21.19), as did the PSA response rate (58% vs 50%), with an\nequal PFS of 9 months in both arms. Noninferiority of the low dose was established according to the predefined criteria. Therefore, abiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day administered following a low-fat breakfast, as an alternative to the dose of 1,000 mg/day after an overnight fast in patients who will not take or cannot afford the standard dose. The cost savings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence. Food impacts absorption unpredictably; side effects should be monitored, and standard dosing (1,000 mg on empty stomach) used if excess toxicity is observed on modified dosing (250 mg with food)."

Median survival was improved with enzalutamide from 13.6 to 18.4 months (HR, 0.63; P,.001). Survival was improved in all subgroups analyzed. Secondary endpoints also were improved significantly, which included the proportion of patients with .50% PSA decline (54% vs 2%), radiographic response (29% vs 4%), radiographic PFS (8.3 vs 2.9 months), and time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) (16.7 vs 13.3 months).

The incidence of cardiac disorders did not differ between the arms. Enzalutamide is dosed at 160 mg daily. Patients in the AFFIRM study were maintained on LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy and could receive bone supportive care medications. The seizure risk in the enzalutamide FDA label was 0.9% versus 0.6% in the manuscript.49,51\nAnother phase III trial studied enzalutamide in the prechemotherapy setting. The PREVAIL study randomly assigned 1,717 patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve metastatic prostate cancer to daily enzalutamide or placebo.52,53 The study was stopped early due to benefits shown in the treatment arm. Compared with the placebo group, the enzalutamide group showed improved median PFS (20.0 vs 5.4 months) and median OS (35.3 vs 31.3 months). Improvements in all secondary endpoints were also observed (eg, the time until chemotherapy initiation or first SRE).\nTwo randomized clinical trials have reported that enzalutamide may be superior to bicalutamide for cancer control in mCRPC. The TERRAIN study randomized 375 patients with treatment-na\u00efve, mCRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50mg/day bicalutamide in a 1:1manner.54 The enzalutamide group had significantly better PFS (defined as PSA progression, soft tissue progression, or development of additional bony metastases) compared\nJNCCN.org | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023 1079\nwith the bicalutamide group (median time to progression, 15.7 vs 5.8 months; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34\u20130.57).\nThe STRIVE trial randomized 396 patients with M0 or M1 treatment-na\u00efve CRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50mg/daybicalutamide in a 1:1manner.55 Theprimary endpoint in this study was PFS, defined as either PSA progression, radiographic progression of disease, or death from any cause. Enzalutamide reduced the risk of progressionordeath by 76% compared with bicalutamide (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18\u20130.32). These studies demonstrated that enzalutamide extended PFS better than bicalutamide in patients choosing an antiandrogen for secondary hormonal therapy treatment of CRPC. Bicalutamide can still be considered in some patients, given the different side-effect profiles of the agents and the increased cost of enzalutamide.\nThus, enzalutamide represents a category 1, preferred treatment option for patients without prior novel hormone therapy in the mCRPC setting. For patients with mCRPC and prior novel hormone therapy, enzalutamide is included in the \u201cother recommended regimens\u201d groupof options.\nThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III PROSPER trial assessed the use of enzalutamide in 1,401 patients with nonmetastatic CRPC.56 Patients with PSADT #10 months were stratified according to PSADT (,6 months vs $6 months) and use of bone-sparing agents and randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/d)\nplus ADT or placebo plus ADT. Enzalutamide improved the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival over placebo (36.6 vs 14.7 months; HR for metastasis or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24\u20130.35; P,.0001).

The Panel awaits more data on this approach.\nChemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and Targeted Therapy for mCRPC Research has expanded the therapeutic options for patients with mCRPC. In addition to the hormonal and radiopharmaceutical therapies described in other sections, options include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy. As noted previously, selection of therapy depends on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, the presence or absence of symptoms, the location of metastases, the presence of certain biomarkers, and consideration of potential side effects."

This survival benefit was maintained at extended follow-up.70 The SWOG 9916 study also showed improved survival with docetaxel when combined with estramustine compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone.68\nDocetaxel is FDA-approved for mCRPC. The standard regimen is every 3 weeks. An alternative to every3-week docetaxel is a biweekly regimen of 50 mg/m2. This regimen is based on a large randomized phase II trial of 346 patients with mCRPC randomized to either every-2-week docetaxel or every-3-week docetaxel, each with maintenance of ADT and prednisone.71 Patients treated with the every-2-week regimen survived an average of 19.5 months compared with 17.0 months with the\nevery-3-week regimen (P5.015). Time-to-progression and PSA decline rate favored every-2-week therapy. Tolerability was improved with every-2-week docetaxel; the febrile neutropenia rate was 4% versus 14%, and other toxicities and overall QOL were similar.\nTreatment with 8 or more cycles of docetaxel may be associated with better OS than fewer cycles in the mCRPC setting, but prospective trials are necessary to test 6 versus 10 cycles of docetaxel in themetastatic castration-sensitive and CRPC settings.72 Retrospective analysis from the GETUG-AFU 15 trial suggests that docetaxel only benefits some patients with CRPC who received docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting.73\nThus, docetaxel is a category 1 preferred option for treatment of docetaxel-na\u00efve mCRPC. The panel believes that docetaxel can be given as a rechallenge after progression on a novel hormone in the mCRPC setting if given in the castration-sensitive setting.\nThe NCCN panel agreed that docetaxel rechallenge may be useful in some patients (category 2A instead of category 1 in this setting), especially in those who have not shown definitive evidence of progression on prior docetaxel therapy. Docetaxel rechallenge can be considered in patients who received docetaxel with ADT in the metastatic castration-sensitive setting."

An international randomized phase III trial (TROPIC) randomized 755 patients with progressive mCRPC to receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2, each with daily prednisone.74 A 2.4-month improvement in OS was demonstrated with cabazitaxel compared with mitoxantrone (HR, 0.72; P,.0001). The improvement in survival was balanced against a higher toxic death rate with cabazitaxel (4.9% vs 1.9%), which was due, in large part, to differences in rates of sepsis and renal failure. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 7.5% of cabazitaxel-treated patients versus 1.3% of mitoxantrone-treated patients. The incidences of severe diarrhea (6%), fatigue (5%), nausea/vomiting (2%), anemia (11%), and thrombocytopenia (4%) also were higher in cabazitaxel-treated patients, which indicated the need for vigilance and treatment or prophylaxis in this setting to prevent febrile neutropenia. The survival benefit was sustained at an updated analysis with a median follow-up of 25.5 months.75 Furthermore, results of a posthoc analysis of this trial suggested that the occurrence of grade $3 neutropenia after cabazitaxel treatment was associated with improvements in both PFS and OS.76\nThe multicenter CARD study was a randomized, open-label clinical trial that compared cabazitaxel with\n1082 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 10 | October 2023\neither abiraterone or enzalutamide in 255 patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel and either abiraterone or enzalutamide.77 Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with concurrent steroid improved the primary endpoint of radiographic PFS (8.0 vs 3.7 months; HR, 0.54; P,.0001) and reduced the risk of death (13.6 vs 11.0 months; HR, 0.64; P5.008) compared with abiraterone or enzalutamide in these patients. Cabazitaxel was also associated with an increased rate of pain response and delayed time to pain progression and SREs.78\nThe phase III open-label, multinational, noninferiority PROSELICA study compared 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel with 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel in 1,200 patients with mCRPC who experienced progression on docetaxel.79 The lower dose was found to be noninferior to the higher dose for median OS (13.4 months [95% CI, 12.19\u201314.88] vs 14.5 months [95% CI, 13.47\u201315.28]), and grade 3\u20134 adverse events were decreased (39.7% vs 54.5%). In particular, grade $3 neutropenia rates were 41.8% and 73.3% for the lower and higher dose groups, respectively.\nResults from the phase III FIRSTANA study suggested that cabazitaxel has clinical activity in patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve mCRPC.80 Median OS, the primary endpoint, was similar between 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel, 25mg/m2 cabazitaxel, and 75mg/m2 docetaxel (24.5months, 25.2 months, and 24.3 months, respectively). Cabazitaxel was associated with lower rates of peripheral sensory neuropathy than docetaxel, particularly at 20 mg/m2 (12% vs 25%). However, the panel does not currently recommend cabazitaxel in docetaxel-na\u00efve patients.\nBased on these data, cabazitaxel is included in these NCCN Guidelines as a preferred option after progression occurs on docetaxel in patients with mCRPC (category 1 after progression on docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy). Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, with or without growth factor support, is the recommended dose for fit patients. Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 may be considered for healthy patients who wish to be more aggressive.\nCabazitaxel should be given with concurrent steroids (daily prednisone or dexamethasone on the day of chemotherapy). Physicians should follow current guidelines for prophylactic white blood cell growth factor use, particularly in this heavily pretreated, high-risk population. In addition, supportive care should include antiemetics (prophylactic antihistamines, H2 antagonists, and corticosteroids prophylaxis) and symptom-directed antidiarrheal agents. Cabazitaxel was tested in patients with hepatic dysfunction in a small, phase I, dose-escalation study.81 Cabazitaxel was tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, cabazitaxel should not be used in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction. Cabazitaxel should be stopped upon clinical disease progression or intolerance."

The pivotal study was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (D9902B).83 Five hundred twelve patients with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic mCRPC were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel-T or placebo. Of patients, 18.2% had received prior chemotherapy, which included docetaxel; eligibility requirements included no chemotherapy for 3 months and no steroids for 1 month prior to enrollment. Median survival in the vaccine arm was 25.8 months compared with 21.7 months in the control arm. In a subset analysis, both those who did and those who did not receive prior chemotherapy benefited from sipuleucel-T treatment. Sipuleucel-T treatment resulted in a 22% reduction in mortality risk (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61\u20130.98; P5.03).

Benefit of sipuleucel-T has not been reported in patients with visceral metastases and is not recommended if visceral metastases are present. Sipuleucel-T is also not recommended for patients with small cell/neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The panel prefers that sipuleucel-T be used as a therapy for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with mCRPC, so that disease burden is lower and immune function is potentially more intact. However, it is also an option for patients with mCRPC who have had prior treatment with docetaxel or a novel hormone therapy, but not for patients who have already received both. Patients should have good performance level (ECOG 0-1), estimated life expectancy .6 months, and no liver metastases. Clinicians and patients should be aware that the usual markers of benefit (decline in PSA and improvement in bone or CT scans) are not seen. Therefore, benefit to the individual patient cannot be ascertained using currently available testing.\nTreatment after sipuleucel-T treatment should proceed as clinically indicated, particularly if symptoms develop."

This approval was based on the treatment of 149 patients across 5 clinical studies involving MSI-H or dMMR colorectal (n590) or noncolorectal (n559) cancer for an objective response rate of 40% (59/149).51 All patients received 1 or more prior regimen. Among the noncolorectal cohorts, 2 patients had mCRPC: one experienced a partial objective response, and the other experienced stable disease for more than 9 months.\nOutcomes of additional patients with mCRPC treated with pembrolizumab have been reported.85\u201390 In an early study, 10 patients with CRPC and nonvisceral metastases (bone 5 7; lymph nodes 5 2; bone and liver 5 1) who had disease progression on enzalutamide were treated with pembrolizumab and enzalutamide.85 Some of the patients also had experienced disease progression on additional therapies (docetaxel for castration-sensitive disease, abiraterone, and/or sipuleucel-T). Three of the 10 patients showed a near complete PSA response. Two of these 3 patients had radiographically measurable\ndisease and experienced a partial radiographic response (including a response in liver metastases). Of the remaining patients, 3 showed stable disease, and 4 showed no evidence of clinical benefit. Genetic analysis of biopsy tissue revealed that one patient whose disease showed PSA response had an MSI-H tumor, whereas the other patient with responsive disease and two with nonresponsive disease did not. The nonrandomized phase Ib KEYNOTE-028 trial included 23 patients with advanced, progressive prostate cancer, of whom 74% had received 2 or more previous therapies for metastatic disease.87 The objective response rate by investigator review was 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0%\u201338.8%), with 4 confirmed partial responses. Eight patients (34.8%) had stable disease. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 61% of patients after a median follow-up of 7.9months; 17% of the cohort experienced grade 3\u20134 events (ie, grade 4 lipase increase, grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, grade 3 asthenia, grade 3 fatigue).\nKEYNOTE-199 was a multicohort, open-label phase II study in 258 patients with mCRPC and prior treatment with docetaxel and at least one novel hormonal therapy that assessed pembrolizumab in patients regardless of MSI status.91 Cohorts 1 and 2 included patients with PD-L1\u2013positive (n5133) and PD-L1\u2013negative (n566) prostate cancer, respectively. Cohort 3 included those with bone-predominant disease with positive or negative PD-L1 expression (n559). The primary endpoint of overall response rate was 5% (95% CI, 2%\u201311%) in cohort 1 and 3% (95% CI, ,1%\u201311%) in cohort 2. Responses were durable (range, 1.9 \u2013$21.8 months).\nThe most common adverse events from pembrolizumab are fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, nausea, rash, fever, cough, dyspnea, and musculoskeletal pain. Pembrolizumab also may be associated with immune-mediated side effects, which include colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, pneumonitis, or nephritis.\nBased on the available data, the panel supports the use of pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-H or dMMR mCRPC whose disease has progressed through docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy. The prevalence of MMR deficiency in metastatic CPRC is estimated at 2%\u20135%,86,92 and testing for MSI-H or dMMR can be performed using DNA testing or immunohistochemistry. If tumor MSI-H or dMMR is identified, the panel recommends referral to genetic counseling for consideration of germline testing for Lynch syndrome.\nIn June 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval for pembrolizumab\u2019s use in patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB-high (TMB-H) ($10 mutations/megabase [mut/Mb]) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

The safety profile of the olaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected based on the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common adverse events being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.\nOS data from PROpel were presented at the 2023 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.122 A trend toward an OS benefit with the abiraterone/olaparib combination was seen in the ITT population and in the HRRm, non-HRRm, BRCA mutation, and non-BRCA mutation subgroups. However, crossover was not allowed, so patients with HRRm in the control arm were unable to receive olaparib, likely contributing to the inferior survival in the control group.\nIn May 2023, the FDA approved the combination of olaparib with abiraterone for the treatment of adult patients with BRCA mutation mCRPC. Based on the results of PROpel, olaparib/abiraterone is included in NCCN Guidelines as an option in first line mCRPC for patients with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy or docetaxel (category 1) and for those who received prior docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting (category 2A)."

However, hematologic adverse events were of higher grades and occurred more frequently than would be expected with talazoparib alone. Overall, the combination had significant toxicity, with dose interruption due to adverse events in 75% of participants in the talazoparib group compared with 23% in the placebo group. Dose reductions due to adverse events occurred in 56% and 7% of the talazoparib and placebo groups, respectively.\nBased on these results, the FDA approved talazoparib plus enzalutamide for HRRm mCRPC in June 2023.

This first-inclass radiopharmaceutical was approved for treatment of mCRPC in patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. Approval was based on clinical data from a multicenter, phase III, randomized trial (ALSYMPCA) that included 921 patients with symptomatic CRPC, two or more bone metastases, and no known visceral disease.128 Fifty-seven percent of the patients received prior docetaxel, and all patients received best supportive care. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 6-monthly radium-223 intravenous injections or placebo. Compared with placebo, radium-223 significantly improved OS (median, 14.9 vs 11.3 months; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.058\u20130.83; P,.001) and prolonged time to first SRE (median, 15.6 vs 9.8 months). Preplanned subset analyses showed that the survival benefit of radium-223 was maintained regardless of prior docetaxel use.129 ITT analyses from ALSYMPCA showed that radium223 alsomay reduce the risk of symptomatic SREs.130 Grade 3\u20134 hematologic toxicity was low (3% neutropenia, 6% thrombocytopenia, and 13% anemia), likely due to the short range of radioactivity.128 Fecal elimination of the agent led to generally mild nonhematologic side effects, which included nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Radium223 was associated with improved or slower decline of QOL in ALSYMPCA.131\nThe multicenter, international, double-blind, placebocontrolled, phase III ERA 223 trial randomized patients with bone-metastatic chemotherapy-na\u00efve CRPC to abiraterone with or without radium-223.132 The patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The primary endpoint of symptomatic SKE-free survival in the ITT population was not met. In fact, the addition of radium-223 to abiraterone was associated with an increased frequency of bone fractures compared with placebo. The PEACE III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02194842) is also comparing radium-223 in combination with a secondary hormonal therapy to secondary hormone therapy alone in patients with mildly symptomatic mCRPC. In this trial, the use of bone protecting agents (denosumab or zoledronic acid) was made mandatory following results from ERA 223. The cumulative incidence of fractures at 1.5 years in\npatients who received a bone-protecting agentwas 2.8% in participants receiving radium-223 plus enzalutamide and 3. 9% in those receiving enzalutamide alone.133 In the absence of bone agents, these numbers were 45.9% and 22.3%, respectively. This result suggests that radium-223 combined with a secondary hormone therapy may be safe if preventive administrationof aboneagent is used. Thepanel awaits further efficacy data before recommending radium-223 in combinationwith a secondary hormonal therapy.\nRadium-223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases without visceral metastases. Hematologic evaluation should be performed according to the FDA label before treatment initiation and before each subsequent dose.51 Radium-223 given in combination with chemotherapy (such as docetaxel) outside of a clinical trial has the potential for additive myelosuppression.51 It is not recommended for use in combination with docetaxel or any other systemic therapy except ADT. It should not be used in patients with visceral metastases.

An update at 24 months also revealed an increase in the median time to first SRE (488 vs 321 days; P5.01).140 No significant differences were found in OS. Other bisphosphonates have not been shown to be effective for prevention of diseaserelated skeletal complications. Earlier use of zoledronic acid in patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases is not associated with lower risk for SREs, and in general should not be used for SRE prevention until the development of mCRPC.141\nThe randomized TRAPEZE trial used a 23 2 factorial design to compare clinical PFS (pain progression, SREs, or death) as the primary outcome in 757 patients with bone mCRPC treated with docetaxel alone or with zoledronic acid, 89Sr, or both.142 The bone-directed therapies had no statistically significant effect on the primary outcome or on OS in unadjusted analysis. However, adjusted analysis revealed a small effect for 89Sr on clinical PFS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73\u20130.99; P5 0.03). For secondary outcomes, zoledronic acid improved the SRE-free interval (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65\u20130.95; P 5 0.01) and decreased the total SREs (424 vs 605) compared with docetaxel alone.\nDenosumab was compared with zoledronic acid in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with CRPC.143 The absolute incidence of SREs was similar in the 2 groups; however, the median time to first SRE was delayed by 3.6 months by denosumab compared with zoledronic acid (20.7 vs 17.1months; P5.0002 for noninferiority, P5.008 for superiority). The rates of important SREs with denosumab were similar to zoledronic acid and included spinal cord compression (3% vs 4%), need for radiation (19% vs 21%), and pathologic fracture (14% vs 15%).\nTreatment-related toxicities reported for zoledronic acid and denosumab were similar and included hypocalcemia (more common with denosumab 13% vs 6%), arthralgias, and osteonecrosis of the jaw (1%\u20132% incidence). Most, but not all, patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw have preexisting dental problems.144\nTherefore, denosumab every 4 weeks (category 1, preferred) or zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended for patients with CRPC and bone metastases to prevent or delay disease-associated SREs. SREs include pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, operation, or EBRT to bone. The optimal duration of zoledronic acid\nor denosumab in patients with CRPC and bone metastases remains unclear. Amulti-institutional, open-label, randomized trial in 1,822 patients with bone-metastatic prostate cancer, breast cancer, or multiple myeloma found that zoledronic acid every 12 weeks was noninferior to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks.145 In the every-12-weeks and every-4weeks arms, 28.6% and 29.5% of patients experienced at least 1 SRE within 2 years of randomization, respectively.\nOral hygiene, baseline dental evaluation for high-risk individuals, and avoidance of invasive dental surgery during therapy are recommended to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.146 If invasive dental surgery is necessary, therapy should be deferred until the dentist confirms that the patient has healed completely from the dental procedure. Supplemental calcium and vitamin D are recommended to prevent hypocalcemia in patients receiving either denosumab or zoledronic acid.\nMonitoring of creatinine clearance is required to guide dosing of zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid should be dose reduced in patients with impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance 30\u201360 mL/min) and held for creatinine clearance,30mL/min. Denosumabmay be administered to patients with impaired renal function or even patients on hemodialysis; however, the risk for severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia is greater, and the dose, schedule, and safety of denosumab have not yet been defined. A single study of 55 patients with creatinine clearance ,30 mL/min or on hemodialysis evaluated the use of 60 mg dose denosumab.51 Hypocalcemia should be corrected before starting denosumab, and serum calcium monitoring is required for denosumab and recommended for zoledronic acid, with repletion as needed.\nRadium-223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases without visceral metastases. The use of palliative, systemic radiation with either 89Sr or 153Sm with or without focal EBRT remains an option, though they are seldom used these days with other available options (see \u201cRadium-223\u201d, page 1089). EBRT alone is also an option.\nClinical research on the prevention or delay of disease spread to bone continues. A phase III randomized trial of 1,432 patients with nonmetastatic CRPC at high risk of bone involvement showed that denosumab delayed bone metastasis by 4 months compared with placebo.147 OS was not improved, and the FDA did not approve denosumab for the prevention of bone metastases."

Although the optimal sequence of therapies remains undefined, some data are emerging that can help with treatment selection in some cases.\nAfter abiraterone or enzalutamide, data suggest that giving the alternate novel hormone therapy may not be the optimal strategy considering the availability of other treatment options, including chemotherapy. The CARD trial, for instance, showed that treatment with cabazitaxel significantly improved clinical outcomes over enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients with mCRPC who had been previously treated with docetaxel and the alternate hormonal therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide).77 Furthermore, data suggest cross-resistance between abiraterone and enzalutamide.148\u2013151 Results of a randomized, open-label, phase II, crossover trial suggest that the sequence of abiraterone followed by enzalutamide is more efficacious than the reverse.152\nSome data inform the sequencing of therapies in patients with actionable biomarkers. The multicenter, unblinded, randomized phase II TheraP trial compared PSA response after Lu-177-PSMA-617 vs cabazitaxel in 200 patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC who previously received docetaxel.153 Prior androgen receptor-directed therapy was permitted. Among the ITT population, the PSA response rate was 66% in the Lu-177-PSMA-617 arm compared with 37% in the cabazitaxel arm (difference, 29%; 95% CI, 16-42; P,.0001).

Furthermore, grade 3\u20134 adverse events were less frequent in the Lu-177-PSMA617 arm than in the cabazitaxel arm (33% vs 53%). Results\nfrom the phase III PSMAfore trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04689828), which may inform the choice between Lu-177-PSMA-617 and switching to a different androgen receptor-directed therapy in docetaxel-na\u00efve patients, are awaited. Data for patients with HRRm mCRPC are more limited, but comparative effectiveness research suggests that olaparib may result in superior radiographic PFS than cabazitaxel in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and prior treatment with docetaxel.154\nNo chemotherapy regimen has demonstrated improved survival or QOL after cabazitaxel or cabazitaxel/ carboplatin, although several systemic agents other than mitoxantrone have shown palliative and radiographic response benefits in clinical trials (ie, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vinorelbine, carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin, gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, paclitaxel/ carboplatin155\u2013164). No survival benefit for these combination regimens over sequential single-agent regimens has been demonstrated, and toxicity is higher. Treatment with these regimens could be considered after an informed discussion between the physician and an individual patient about treatment goals and risks/side effects and alternatives, which must include best supportive care. Prednisone or dexamethasone at low doses may provide palliative benefits in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.165 Participation in a clinical trial is encouraged."
