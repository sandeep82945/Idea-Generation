    "abstractText": "We study a three-layer data market comprising users (data owners), platforms, and a data buyer. Each user benefits from platform services in exchange for data, incurring privacy loss when their data, albeit noisily, is shared with the buyer. The user chooses platforms to share data with, while platforms decide on data noise levels and pricing before selling to the buyer. The buyer selects platforms to purchase data from. We model these interactions via a multistage game, focusing on the subgame Nash equilibrium. We find that when the buyer places a high value on user data (and platforms can command high prices), all platforms offer services to the user who joins and shares data with every platform. Conversely, when the buyer\u2019s valuation of user data is low, only large platforms with low service costs can afford to serve users. In this scenario, users exclusively join and share data with these low-cost platforms. Interestingly, increased competition benefits the buyer, not the user: as the number of platforms increases, the user utility does not necessarily improve while the buyer utility improves. However, increasing the competition improves the overall utilitarian welfare. Building on our analysis, we then study regulations to improve the user utility. We discover that banning data sharing maximizes user utility only when all platforms are low-cost. In mixed markets of highand low-cost platforms, users prefer a minimum noise mandate over a sharing ban. Imposing this mandate on high-cost platforms and banning data sharing for low-cost ones further enhances user utility.",

            "text": "In the digital era, online platforms have become integral to our daily lives, offering a plethora of services that range from social networking to personalized shopping experiences. While these platforms provide convenience and connectivity, they also engage in extensive data collection practices. Users\u2019 interactions with these platforms generate vast amounts of data, encompassing personal preferences, behaviors, and other sensitive information. This data, a valuable commodity, is often shared with third-party buyers.\n*University of California, Berkeley \u2020Fuqua School of Business, Duke University \u2021Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.\nar X\niv :2\n40 2.\n09 69\n7v 2\n[ ec\non .T\nH ]\n2 0\nFe b\n20 24\nWith the advent of new functionalities by information technology companies such as Apple or Google that reduce or eliminate tracking via third-party cookies, there has been an increased reliance on first-party data, which is information gathered by a company from its own user base. For example, as elaborated in Cross [2023b], major retailers such as BestBuy and Walmart capitalize on this data through loyalty programs, customer purchase records, and subscriptions. They do this by selling the data to advertisers who aim to place targeted ads on the retailers\u2019 websites or across various online platforms. In a similar vein, Cross [2023a] notes that Mastercard, a leading payment technology firm, trades cardholder transaction information via third-party online data marketplaces and its internal \u201cData and Services\u201d division. This practice grants numerous entities access to extensive consumer data and insights. For instance, their Intelligent Targeting service allows businesses to leverage \u201cMastercard 360\u25e6 data insights\u201d to create and execute advertising campaigns that specifically target potential \u201chigh-value\u201d customers.\nIn this complex digital ecosystem, users face the dilemma of benefiting from the services provided by these platforms while potentially compromising their privacy. Platforms, on the other hand, must balance the profitability derived from data sharing with the need to maintain user trust and satisfaction. This interplay between users\u2019 privacy concerns and the economic incentives of platforms raises important questions about the sustainability of current data market practices. Notable regulatory actions have been taken to improve user experiences. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have been introduced to protect user privacy and to limit the amount of data shared with the platforms. Although, at first sight, this helps users, there have been several studies pointing to its detrimental impact both on platforms and users. This is because these regulations have led to a more concentrated market structure by limiting competition in data markets. This results from the regulation\u2019s restrictions on data sharing, which may slow down data-based innovations and services. For instance, studies have shown that GDPR has led to a significant reduction in the number of available apps in the market, with new app entries falling by half following the regulation\u2019s implementation (Janssen et al. [2022]). This decline in market entries indicates a potential loss of innovation as new and smaller players find it increasingly difficult to compete under these regulations. This effect is particularly detrimental to small companies that rely on these data synergies for innovation and market growth (see also Gal and Aviv [2020]).\nIn this paper, we aim to understand the user and platform strategies that arise when considering the collection and usage of user data. We also explore regulatory frameworks that could be implemented to enhance user utility while maintaining the benefits provided by online platforms."

            "heading": "1.1 Our model and main results",
            "text": "We adopt an analytical-modeling-based approach and develop a framework to examine the choices of both users and platforms, taking into account users\u2019 privacy concerns. We also explore regulations and policies that could alleviate these concerns. In our model, multiple platforms interact with a user who owns data and seeks the services of these platforms, as well as with a third-party\nbuyer interested in purchasing the user\u2019s data from the platforms. Throughout our study, we consider MasterCard as an example of such a platform. The user represents an individual in a specific population segment with particular preferences, and the buyer is conceptualized as a third-party advertiser aiming to understand and leverage these user preferences for its own benefit.\nThe utility of each platform is determined by three factors: the gains obtained from using user data to provide services, potential payments received from buyers purchasing this data, and the costs incurred in providing services to the user. Let us highlight the cost of services, as it plays an important role in our analysis. It is particularly important to distinguish between high-cost and low-cost platforms. The low-cost platforms are those that do not necessarily need to sell data to stay in the market, as their gains from the service already cover their costs of operation. In our leading examples, low-cost platforms are exemplified by payment-technology companies or big retailers, where either their operational costs per user are low, or their main source of revenue is not derived from selling data. Conversely, for high-cost platforms, the gains from service provision are not enough to offset their operational costs. Hence, they require a minimum level of data selling to be incentivized to enter the market (i.e., to provide services to the user). Examples of these platforms typically include smaller firms or companies that heavily rely on data collection for advertising to ensure their continued operation.\nWe model the interaction between the players as a multi-stage game in which, in the first stage, the platforms decide whether they want to provide services to the user and the privacy level they want to deliver to the data buyer (so that the user is incentivized to share). We model the privacy level that the platform provides as a noise level added to the user data. Adding a suitable level of noise is common practice in, for example, the analysis of census data Abowd [2018] and is theoretically justified in the literature on differential privacy Dwork et al. [2014].\nIn the second stage of the game, the user decides which platform to join. The user\u2019s utility is the service quality of the platform, proportional to the amount of user information revealed to the platform minus the user\u2019s privacy loss. The privacy loss refers to the amount of information all platforms reveal to the data buyer. In the third and fourth stages, the platforms determine the price to charge the data buyer, and the buyer decides from which platforms to purchase. The data buyer\u2019s utility is the user\u2019s leaked information from all platforms minus the payments made to acquire this information. Again, the data buyer can be viewed as a third-party advertiser in our example mentioned above who pays the platforms to obtain user data. They then use this data for potential gain, with their gain being proportional to the accuracy of the user data obtained.\nEquilibrium characterization and insights: We adopt the subgame Nash equilibrium as our equilibrium concept and use backward induction to characterize it. Finding the equilibrium of this game is complex mainly because the platforms\u2019 choice of noise level not only directly impacts the user\u2019s utility but also changes the data buyer\u2019s decision, which indirectly impacts the user\u2019s utility. Also, the competition among platforms further complicates the dynamic of the game. For instance, a platform may still be incentivized to sell data at a noise level higher than needed for\nthe user to be willing to share their data. At first glance, this may seem unreasonable as it reduces the quality of the data that they can sell, and hence, the data buyer would pay less for it. However, increasing the privacy could persuade the user to forgo other platforms that offer less stringent privacy guarantees and only use this platform\u2019s service. As a result, this can give a monopoly to the platform in terms of access to the user\u2019s data, and hence, the data buyer would end up paying more to them.\nWe start our analysis of equilibrium by focusing on the case of two platforms. This setting allows us to infer insights about equilibrium properties that are applicable to more general cases. Here, we identify up to three primary regimes, depending on the data buyer\u2019s valuation of user data acquisition, denoted by \u03b2 in our model. When \u03b2 falls below a certain threshold, neither of the two platforms enters the market due to insufficient payment to cover service costs. This regime ceases to exist when at least one platform is low-cost, meaning it can cover service costs solely through service provision without needing to sell data. Conversely, when \u03b2 is sufficiently high, both platforms will participate in the market. Interestingly, in this case, and when the user is privacy-conscious and requires a minimum non-zero level of noise for data sharing, the user utility is equal to zero at equilibrium. However, as the data buyer compensates each platform at the marginal value of the data, their utility remains positive. Finally, there exists an intermediate regime of \u03b2, where only the lower-cost platform engages in the market. Here, both the user and the data buyer utilities are zero at equilibrium, indicating that having both platforms in the market to compete benefits the data buyers but not the user.\nWe demonstrate that these findings extend to the general scenario with K > 2 platforms. Specifically, we establish that when \u03b2 exceeds a certain threshold, signifying the data buyer\u2019s willingness to pay more for the user data, all platforms will enter the market and provides services to the user. Conversely, when \u03b2 is below this threshold, only low-cost platforms will participate, while high-cost ones will abstain. Although competition does not favor the user, it results in positive utility for the data buyer. Moreover, the overall utilitarian welfare increases proportionally with the number of participating platforms.\nRegulation and policy design: Building on our equilibrium characterization, we then study regulations that aim to improve user utility. Here, our analysis provides three main insights. Firstly, we consider a ban on platforms sharing user data with the data buyers. This regulation only maximizes the user utility if all the platforms are low-cost. Specifically, under this regulation, users obtain the best of both worlds: all platforms (that have a low cost for providing services) enter the market, and the user benefits from the services of all of them while incurring zero privacy loss. This observation suggests that if we only had large firms whose costs of providing service per user are small, then the draconian regulation that involves banning data sharing would have been optimal. However, this is no longer the case if the market includes both high and low-cost platforms.\nIn this case, our second insight reveals that imposing a uniform minimum privacy mandate\nimproves user utility, particularly when the value of the user data to the data buyer is significant enough for platforms to charge a high price for it. This means that all platforms need to perturb the user data by adding to it a noise with a high enough noise level. Here, our analysis identifies specific conditions where GDPR-type policies, which limit user data usage, can benefit users. Finally, our third insight suggests that, despite potential implementation challenges, a non-uniform minimum privacy mandate \u2014 banning data sharing for low-cost platforms while imposing a minimum privacy standard for high-cost platforms \u2014 further enhances user utility. This regulation entails prohibiting large, low-cost platforms from sharing user data, while permitting smaller, high-cost platforms to do so, albeit in a limited manner through privacy mechanisms. This approach aligns with our earlier discussion that GDPR-type regulations disproportionately harm small businesses. Therefore, a non-uniform regulation favoring small businesses is preferred not only by these businesses but also by the users."

            "heading": "1.2 Related literature",
            "text": "Our paper broadly relates to the emerging literature on data markets and online platform behavior. Earlier works on this topic include Acquisti et al. [2016], Posner and Weyl [2018], Ali et al. [2019], Jones and Tonetti [2020], and Dosis and Sand-Zantman [2022] which study the consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information about individuals. Additionally, Acemoglu et al. [2022], Bergemann et al. [2020], Ichihashi [2020b], and Fainmesser et al. [2022] study the privacy consequences of data externality (whereby a user\u2019s data reveals information about others). Acemoglu et al. [2023a] study user-optimal privacy-preserving mechanisms that platforms can adopt to balance privacy and learning and Acemoglu et al. [2023b] develop an experimentation game to study the implications of the platform\u2019s information advantage in product offering. Finally, Ichihashi [2021] studies data intermediaries, and Ichihashi [2020a] studies consumer privacy choices while online platforms adjust their privacy guarantees dynamically to incentivize more data sharing from consumers.\nMore closely related to ours are papers that study data sharing among users, platforms, and third-party data buyers and, in particular, the impacts of banning such data sharing. In this regard, Bimpikis et al. [2021] and Argenziano and Bonatti [2023] develop a two-round model of the interaction between a user and two competing platforms that can collect data on user preferences (and potentially use it for price discrimination). Bimpikis et al. [2021] show that banning data sharing can hurt the user when the platforms offer complementary products, and Argenziano and Bonatti [2023] show that banning data sharing can hurt the user if the benefits of knowing user preferences by the seller and personalized services are limited. The above papers consider the interactions between a user and a platform that itself uses the user data for price discrimination and, therefore, can potentially hurt the user. In contrast, we study a different problem that relates to how platforms sell user data to other third-party data buyers. Therefore, in addition to the differences in modeling choices and analysis, we depart from the above papers by considering a three-layer data market that includes the interaction between the platforms and the data buyer\nand focusing on deriving insights on effective regulations. Also related to our work is Ravichandran and Korula [2019] who empirically study the effect of the data-sharing ban on platforms\u2019 revenues and Madsen and Vellodi [2023] who study the effects of a complete ban on innovation (we refer to Pino [2022] for a comprehensive survey on the microeconomics of data). We depart from these papers by focusing on the impact of regulations (and in particular data-sharing ban) on user\u2019s utility. Our paper also relates to the literature that studies various forms of monetizing user data by platforms, such as selling cookies Bergemann and Bonatti [2015], efficient pricing for large data sets Abolhassani et al. [2017], dynamic sales Immorlica et al. [2021], Drakopoulos and Makhdoumi [2023], monetization while ensuring the data is replicable Falconer et al. [2023], and the design and price of information where a data buyer faces a decision problem under uncertainty and can augment their initial private information with supplemental data from a data seller Bergemann et al. [2018].\nFinally, our paper relates to the growing literature on data acquisition and the design of mechanisms for incentivizing data sharing, including Ghosh and Roth [2011], Ligett and Roth [2012], Nissim et al. [2014], Cummings et al. [2015], Chen et al. [2018], Chen and Zheng [2019], Fallah et al. [2023], Cummings et al. [2023], Fallah et al. [2022], and Karimireddy et al. [2022]. We depart from this line of work as we consider a three-layer market where the privacy cost occurs due to selling data to a third-party buyer.\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe our model and the interactions among the platforms, the data buyer, and the user. We also present some properties of the revealed information measure in our setting such as its monotonicity and submodularity. In Section 3, we introduce our equilibrium concept and provide preliminary characterizations of it. In Section 4, we focus on a setting with two platforms and provide a full characterization of the equilibrium. The focus on two platforms allows us to describe some of the nuances of the interactions in our model. In Section 5, we establish that our main characterizations continue to hold in the general setting with any number of platforms. We also provide several insights and comparative statics, leading to our discussion of the regulations in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes while the appendix contains all the omitted proofs from the text."

            "text": "We consider K \u2208 N platforms that are interacting with a user and a data buyer. The user benefits from using the services of these platforms. In return, the platforms acquire data about the user\u2019s preferences and behavior. The platforms may subsequently sell this data to a third party, such as an advertiser, which we refer to as a data buyer (or, interchangeably, a buyer). The data buyer is interested in learning about the user\u2019s preferences, which can adversely impact the user\u2019s utility. This negative impact can be because of price discrimination, unfairly targeted advertising, manipulation, or intrinsic privacy losses. In the example of MasterCard described in the introduction, MasterCard is one of the platforms, and the data buyer is any other firm that purchases user data\nfrom MasterCard. Formally, we represent the user\u2019s data by \u03b8 \u2208 Rd, which follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and identity variance, that is, \u03b8 \u223c N (0, Id). This vector \u03b8 can be interpreted as the user\u2019s feature vector. Each platform i \u2208 [K] \u225c {1, . . . ,K} offers a service whose quality depends on how accurately the platform can learn the match between the user\u2019s feature vector and the platform\u2019s characteristics, i.e.,\nx\u22a4i \u03b8.\nHere, xi \u2208 Rd is a known unit-norm vector symbolizing the characteristic vector of platform i. The user decides whether to share their data with each of the K platforms in exchange for their service. We let ai \u2208 {0, 1} denote whether the user has shared data with platform i and a \u2208 {0, 1}K denote the user strategy profile. Specifically, if the user opts to share their data with platform i, meaning ai = 1, then platform i receives a signal\nsi := x \u22a4 i \u03b8 +N (0, 1).\nThe introduced noise ensures a degree of privacy concerning the user\u2019s data.1\nThe data buyer aims to estimate a linear function of the user\u2019s data, y\u22a4\u03b8. Here, y \u2208 Rd with \u2225y\u2225 = 1 denotes the data buyer\u2019s known characteristic vector. If platform i possesses the user\u2019s data (i.e., ai = 1), they present the data buyer with an option to acquire a noisy version of their data at a price pi. Therefore, the data buyer strategy profile is b \u2208 {0, 1}K , with bi = 1 denoting their acceptance of the platform i\u2019s offer. The data buyer then receives a signal\ns\u0303i := si +N (0, \u03c32i )\nfor the price pi, where \u03c32i represents the variance of the noise that platform i adds to the data they share with the data buyer.\nLastly, each platform i \u2208 [K] decides on the noise level to add to the user data before offering it to the data buyer, denoted by \u03c3i \u2208 R+. We find it more convenient to work with the standard deviation of the noise \u03c3i and assume, without loss of generality, it is positive rather than the variance \u03c32i . Each platform also decides whether to enter the market and provide services to the user, denoted by ei \u2208 {0, 1}. Therefore, the platforms\u2019 strategy profile is (\u03c3, e) \u2208 RK+ \u00d7 {0, 1}K .\nWe set s\u0303i = NA when the data buyer does not obtain any information from platform i. This can occur either because the user has not shared their data with platform i or because the data buyer declines the offer from platform i or the platform has not provided the service to the user. In this case, pi is irrelevant, and we set it to zero.\nThroughout the paper, we make the following assumption:\n1We set the noise variance to one to simplify the results. However, the analysis remains valid for any (potentially heterogeneous) level of noise.\nAssumption 1. Let\n\u03b3i = x T i y for all i \u2208 [K]\ndenote the correlation between the user i\u2019s data and the data buyer. Then, we assume\n(xi \u2212 \u03b3iy)T (xj \u2212 \u03b3jy) = 0 for all i \u0338= j \u2208 [K].\nNote that under this assumption, the data offered by different platforms are viewed as substitutes for each other from the data buyer\u2019s perspective. However, if this assumption does not hold, a complementary effect could also be observed. To illustrate this, suppose we have K = 2 platforms where x1 is orthogonal to y, i.e., \u03b31 = 0, and also x2 = \u03b32y + (1\u2212 \u03b32)x1. In this scenario, the data from platform 1 alone has no value to the data buyer, as x\u22a41 \u03b8 provides no information about \u03b8\u22a4y. However, if the data buyer decides to purchase data from the second platform, then the data from the first platform could also become valuable. To understand why, observe that the data from the second platform is a convex combination of two components: x\u22a41 \u03b8 and y\n\u22a4\u03b8. Therefore, if the data buyer acquires the data from the second platform, learning x\u22a41 \u03b8 could assist in better distinguishing these two components. In other words, the data from the first platform is valuable only if accompanied by the data from the second platform. This scenario exemplifies the complementary effect we described earlier. Assumption 1 excludes this possibility, allowing us to primarily focus on the substitution effect. This assumption also implies that the correlation among data for different platforms is given by\nE[xixj ] = \u03b3i\u03b3j ."

            "heading": "2.1 Utility functions",
            "text": "To define the utility functions, we need to first quantify how much information is revealed by observing the signals. We do so by using the following definition, which captures the reduction in uncertainty following the observation of a set of signals.\nDefinition 1 (Revealed information). Consider a random variable Z drawn from the distribution \u03c0(.). Let \u03c0S(.) represent the posterior distribution of Z upon observing a set of signals S. The revealed information about Z by observing S is quantified as the reduction in the mean-squared error of Z, i.e.,\nI(Z | S) = E [ (Z \u2212 EZ\u223c\u03c0 [Z])2 ] \u2212 E [ (Z \u2212 EZ\u223c\u03c0S [Z]) 2 ] ,\nwhere the outer expectations are over the randomness in Z and the signals.\nMeasuring the revealed information, or information gain, through the variance of the posterior distribution has been used widely in economics, statistics, and learning theory (see, for example, Breiman et al. [1984], Bergemann et al. [2020], and Acemoglu et al. [2022]).\nGiven this definition, the user\u2019s utility function is given by\nUuser(\u03c3, e,a,p, b) := K\u2211 i=1 aieiIi \u2212 \u03b1 I(\u03c3, e,a, b), (1)\nwhere the term\nIi \u225c I(x\u22a4i \u03b8 | si)\nis the user\u2019s revealed information to platform i if the user shares her information (i.e., when ai = 1) and the platform is offering service to the user (i.e., when ei = 1). The term\nI(\u03c3, e,a, b) \u225c I(y\u22a4\u03b8 | s\u0303),\nis the user\u2019s revealed information to the data buyer. Here, s\u0303 denotes the vector (s\u0303i)Ki=1, which is the revealed information to the data buyer. Notice that the user\u2019s utility does not directly depend on p, but we retain this notation to highlight that through the data buyer\u2019s decision, the revealed information depends on p. Also, notice that in finding the revealed information to the data buyer, all that matters is the set {\u03c3i : s.t. ai = bi = ei = 1}. Therefore, we also find it convenient to define\nI(\u03c3S) for \u03c3S = (\u03c3i : i \u2208 S) for any S \u2286 [K], (2)\nwhere we may drop the subindex S whenever the indices of the elements of \u03c3 are clear from the context.\nThe first term in (1) captures the user\u2019s gain from the service offered by each platform. Notice that this term is present if the platform has entered the market (i.e., ei = 1) and if the user shares with the platform (i.e., ai = 1). The second term represents the user\u2019s privacy loss from the sharing of their data with the data buyer. Additionally, \u03b1 indicates the user\u2019s relative importance on these two opposing terms.\nFor each i \u2208 [K], platform i\u2019s utility is given by\nUi(\u03c3, e,a,p, b) := aiIi + bipi \u2212 ci ei = 10 ei = 0. (3) When the platform has not entered the market (i.e., ei = 0), the platform\u2019s utility is zero. When the platform has entered the market (i.e., ei = 1), the second term bipi represents the platform\u2019s revenue from selling the user\u2019s data to the data buyer. The first term aiIi, similar to the user\u2019s utility, reflects the quality of service the platform provides (if the user ends up utilizing their service). This term is concluded to capture the fact that a better service by the platform also enhances the platform\u2019s utility. For example, it could increase ad revenue or expand the user base.\nLastly, the cost ci \u2208 R+ reflects the per-user cost incurred by the platform for providing the service. Finally, the data buyer\u2019s utility is given by\nUbuyer(\u03c3, e,a,p, b) := \u03b2 I(\u03c3, e,a, b)\u2212 K\u2211 i=1 bipi, (4)\nwhich is the data buyer\u2019s gain from learning the user\u2019s information minus the amount they pay to all the platforms to purchase their data. Here, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] is some constant that captures the importance of the revealed information compared to the payments in the data buyer\u2019s utility.\nWe refer to the above game among the platforms, user, and buyer of data as a three-layer data market with parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, c,\u03b3). Here is the timing of the game (see Figure 1):\n1. In the first stage, all platforms simultaneously choose (\u03c3, e) \u2208 RK+ \u00d7 {0, 1}K that specifies their noise levels and whether they want to enter the market to provide services to the user.\n2. In the second stage, the user chooses a \u2208 {0, 1}K that specifies which platforms to join and share data with.\n3. In the third stage, the platforms simultaneously choose p \u2208 RK that determines their offered prices.\n4. In the fourth stage, the data buyer chooses b \u2208 {0, 1}K that determines whether they accept or decline each offer made by the platforms."

            "heading": "2.2 Revealed Information Properties",
            "text": "Before analyzing this game, we provide some properties of our notion of revealed information. In stating the properties, we recall that the leaked information to the data buyer depends on e, a, and b through the set of platforms that share user data with the data buyer and the noise level of each of them. Therefore, we make use of the shorthand notation for the leaked information given in (2). In what follows, we also consider the lattice (L,\u2264), where\nL := {\u2113 | \u2113 \u2208 {0, 1}K} and \u2113 \u2264 \u2113\u2032 if \u2113i \u2264 \u2113\u2032i for all i \u2208 [K]. (5)\nThe revealed information admits the following closed-form expression.\nLemma 1. For any i \u2208 [K], we have Ii = 1/2. Moreover, for any \u03c3 and S \u2286 [K] we have\nI(\u03c3S) = mTM\u22121m,\nwhere mi = \u03b3i, [M ]ii = 2 + \u03c32i , and [M ]ij = \u03b3i\u03b3j for all i, j \u2208 S such that i \u0338= j.\nLemma 1 follows by using the properties of multivariate normal distribution. We should highlight that for simplicity, we assumed that the user adds the same noise level to their data before sharing it with any platform, which results in Ii for all I \u2208 [K] being equal. Our analysis continues to hold for any heterogeneous level of noise.\nImportantly, Lemma 1 enables us to obtain some structural properties of the revealed information, as we now demonstrate.\nLemma 2 (monotonicity). The revealed information is increasing in the set of platforms that share the user data with the data buyer and is decreasing in \u03c3, i.e., for any \u03c3 and S \u2286 [K], I(\u03c3S) is increasing in S and decreasing in \u03c3.\nLemma 2 simply states that more data sharing with the data buyer increases its revealed information. Moreover, data with a lower noise level increases the revealed information to the data buyer.\nLemma 3 (submodularity in actions). For a given vector of noise levels \u03c3, the revealed information is submodular in the set of platforms that share the user data with the data buyer, i.e., for any \u03c3, S \u2286 T \u2286 [K], and i \u0338\u2208 T , we have\nI((\u03c3i,\u03c3S))\u2212 I(\u03c3S) \u2265 I((\u03c3i,\u03c3T ))\u2212 I(\u03c3T ).\nLemma 3 states the intuitively appealing result that as more data is shared with the data buyer, the marginal increase in the revealed information from one more unit of shared data becomes smaller.\nLemma 4 (submodularity in noise variance). For any \u03c3, S \u2286 [K], i \u0338\u2208 S, and j \u2208 S\nI((\u03c3i,\u03c3S))\u2212 I(\u03c3S)\nis decreasing in \u03c3i and increasing in \u03c3j .\nLemma 4 states the data of platform i reveals a relatively higher amount of information for smaller \u03c3i values and for larger \u03c3j values. To understand the former, let us compare the case of \u03c3i \u2248 0 and \u03c3i \u2192 \u221e. When \u03c3i \u2248 0, the data of platform i reveals a lot, which helps the data buyer learn much better. However, when \u03c3i \u2192 \u221e, the data of platform i does not contain any information, and therefore, the relative gain in the revealed information is \u2248 0. To understand the\nformer, let us again compare the case of \u03c3j \u2248 0 and \u03c3j \u2192 \u221e. When \u03c3j \u2248 0, the data of platform j reveals a lot; therefore, the marginal increase in the revealed information of platform i is small. However, when \u03c3j \u2192 \u221e, the data of platform j does not contain any information, and therefore, the relative increase in the revealed information from platform i\u2019s data is much larger."

We next formally define and characterize the subgame perfect equilibrium in our setting, starting from the last stage.\nBuyer equilibrium: For a given (\u03c3, e,a,p), a data buyer profile bE is an equilibrium if it achieves the data buyer\u2019s highest utility, i.e.,\nbE \u2208 argmax b\u2208{0,1}K Ubuyer(\u03c3, e,a,p, b).\nGiven that there is a finite set of 2n possibilities, one of them achieves the maximum data buyer\u2019s utility, and therefore, an equilibrium buyer profile strategy always exists. We let BE(\u03c3, e,a,p) be the set of such buyer equilibria.\nPrice equilibrium: For a given (\u03c3, e,a), a pricing strategy by the platforms pE is an equilibrium if no platform has a profitable deviation (taking the data buyer\u2019s updated decision into account):\nUi(\u03c3, e,a,pE, bE) \u2265 Ui(\u03c3, e,a, (pi,pE\u2212i), b) for all i \u2208 [K], bE \u2208 BE(\u03c3, e,a,pE), pi, b \u2208 BE(\u03c3, e,a, (pi,pE\u2212i)).\nBefore proceeding with the rest of the game, we establish that the data buyer and price equilibria admit a simple characterization, stated next.\nProposition 1. For a given (\u03c3, e,a), there exists a unique price equilibrium given by\np\u2217i = \u03b2 (I(\u03c3, e,a,1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e,a, (bi = 0,1\u2212i))) for all i \u2208 [K]\nand the corresponding unique buyer equilibrium is bi = 1 for all i \u2208 [K], where 1\u2212i is the vector of all ones for all j \u2208 [K] \\ {i}.\nThe proof of Proposition 1, given in the appendix, directly follows from the submodularity of the revealed information established in Lemma 3 for the following reason. Consider platform i \u2208 [K] and suppose the contrary that in equilibrium, the buyer is not purchasing from it. This platform has a profitable deviation by lowering its price so that the data buyer finds it optimal to purchase from it. Also, notice that the submodularity of the revealed information implies that if one more platform\u2019s data is shared with the data buyer, the marginal increase in the revealed\ninformation decreases. Therefore, if the data buyer was purchasing from another platform j \u0338= i, they still find it optimal to purchase from that platform.\nProposition 1 characterizes the equilibrium of the third and fourth stages of the game. Therefore, it remains to characterize the user sharing profile and the platform\u2019s noise level and entry decisions in equilibrium, taking into account the equilibrium of the subsequent stages that we have already identified.\nUser equilibrium: For a given (\u03c3, e), a user sharing profile aE is an equilibrium if it achieves the user\u2019s highest utility, i.e.,\naE \u2208 argmax a\u2208{0,1}K Uuser(\u03c3, e,a,p\u2217,1).\nAgain, given that there are 2n possibilities, one of them achieves the maximum user\u2019s utility, and therefore, an equilibrium sharing profile strategy always exists. We let AE(\u03c3, e) be the set of such user equilibria. This set has the following important lattice structure that we use in the rest of the analysis.\nLemma 5. For a given (\u03c3, e), the set of user equilibria AE(\u03c3, e) is a sublattice of the lattice (L,\u2264) (defined in (5)). Therefore, it has a maximum and a minimum.\nFor a platform strategy profile (\u03c3, e), we select the platforms\u2019 Pareto-optimal one if there are multiple user equilibria. Using Lemma 5, such a user equilibrium exists and is the one that shares with the highest number of platforms.2\nPlatform equilibrium: A noise level and entry strategy (\u03c3E, eE) is an equilibrium if no platform has a profitable deviation, i.e.,\nUi(\u03c3E, eE,aE,p\u2217,1) \u2265 Ui((\u03c3i,\u03c3E\u2212i), (ei, eE\u2212i),a,p\u2217,1)\nfor all i \u2208 [K],aE \u2208 AE(\u03c3E, eE),a \u2208 AE((\u03c3i,\u03c3E\u2212i), (ei, eE\u2212i)). We refer to a platform\u2019s noise level and entry decision as the platform\u2019s decision and to the corresponding equilibrium as the platforms\u2019 equilibrium. The following characterizes the set of possible platforms\u2019 equilibria.\nProposition 2. For any platforms\u2019 equilibrium strategy (\u03c3, e), we must have\nAE(\u03c3, e) = {(ai = 1 : for all i s.t. ei = 1))},\nthat is, the user must find it optimal to share with all platforms that have entered the market.\n2We can view this as Stackelberg Nash equilibrium in which because the platforms move first, we break the ties in their favor. Similar concepts have appeared in the literature with different terms, such as sender-preferred equilibrium in Bayesian persuasion [Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011].\nThis proposition follows by noting that a platform that has entered the market can always increase its noise level so that the user finds it optimal to share with the platform.\nMotivated by Proposition 2 and Lemma 5, we conclude that for any set of platforms that have entered the market (captured by e \u2208 {0, 1}K), the set of possible noise levels in equilibrium is \u03a31,e, where we have\n\u03a3a,e := {(\u03c3i : i s.t. ei = 1) : a is the highest element of AE(\u03c3, e)} for all a \u2208 {0, 1}K . (6)\nWe are interested in characterizing \u03a31,e for any e and finding the equilibrium that belongs to one of these sets for an equilibrium choice of e.\nThroughout the paper, we focus on the case in which the user asks for some level of privacy in order to share their data. This means that if the noise levels are all zero, then the user does not share with the platforms. More formally, we make the following assumption:\nAssumption 2. The weight of privacy on the user utility, i.e., \u03b1, is large enough such that, for any e \u2208 {0, 1}K , the point (\u03c3i = 0 : i s.t. ei = 1) belongs to the set \u03a30,e.\nWe will further clarify this assumption\u2019s role in the next section."

            "text": "We begin our analysis by considering a setting with K = 2 platforms. We then show that the main insights from this analysis extend to the general setting with K > 2 platforms.\nDepending on which platforms enter the market, we have four cases:\nCase 1 where both platforms enter the market: In this case, the user\u2019s utility if they share their data with both platforms is given by3\nUuser(\u03c31, \u03c32) := 1\u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c31, \u03c32), (7)\nand the user\u2019s utility if they share their data with platform i \u2208 {1, 2} only is equal to\nUuser(\u03c3i) := 1\n2 \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3i). (8)\nRecall the definition of \u03a3a,e with e = (1, 1) in (6). To simplify the notation, we drop the e and use \u03a3\u0303a. In particular,\n\u03a3\u0303(1,1) := {(\u03c31, \u03c32) : Uuser(\u03c31, \u03c32) = max (Uuser(\u03c31, \u03c32),Uuser(\u03c31),Uuser(\u03c32), 0)}.\n3With a slight abuse of notation, we drop the other dependencies of the user utility here.\nSimilarly, \u03a3\u0303(1,0) and \u03a3\u0303(0,1) denote the cases where Uuser(\u03c31) and Uuser(\u03c32), respectively, have the highest value. Finally,\n\u03a3\u0303(0,0) := {(\u03c31, \u03c32) : 0 = max (Uuser(\u03c31, \u03c32),Uuser(\u03c31),Uuser(\u03c32), 0)}.\nNotice that we operate under Assumption 2, which implies that \u03a3\u0303(0,0) is non-empty. In particular, for K = 2, this assumption translates to\n\u03b1 > 4\u2212 \u03b321\u03b322 2 ( \u03b321 + \u03b3 2 2 \u2212 \u03b321\u03b322 ) . (9) Figure 2a depicts the sets \u03a3\u0303(1,1), \u03a3\u0303(0,1), \u03a3\u0303(1,0), and \u03a3\u0303(0,0) as a function of the noise variance that the two platforms add to the data, i.e., (\u03c321, \u03c3 2 2), for parameters \u03b31 = 0.8 and \u03b32 = 0.7.\nUsing Proposition 2, the noise level equilibrium is in the set \u03a3\u0303(1,1). In fact, we argue that it must belong to \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0) because, otherwise, one of the platforms can increase its utility by decreasing its noise level such that the user still shares with it.\nNow, for any (\u03c31, \u03c32) \u2208 \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0), the only possible deviation for platform 1 is to increase \u03c31 to \u03c3\u03031 to move to the point (\u03c3\u03031, \u03c32) which resides in \u03a3\u0303(1,0), exactly next to the boundary with \u03a3\u0303(1,1) (see Figure 2a). At first glance, it might look like this can never be a deviation because it reduces the revealed information to the buyer. However, notice that, by this action, platform 1 pushes platform 2 out of the market because (\u03c3\u03031, \u03c32) is in the yellow region \u03a3\u0303(1,0) in which the user does not share their data with the second platform. Therefore, it is possible that the first\nplatform\u2019s payment increases, as they are now the only platform with access to the data. Note that this is the only deviation that we need to consider. Because if it ends up not being a deviation, it would imply that a further increase of \u03c31 into the yellow region is also not profitable. Also, it is evident that increasing \u03c31 but staying in the \u03a3\u0303(1,1) region or decreasing it and going into the \u03a3\u0303(0,0) region in which the user shares no data are not profitable deviations. Considering these deviations results in the following.\nLemma 6. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Assuming both platforms have entered the market, there exists an equilibrium noise level (\u03c31, \u03c32) \u2208 \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0) if and only if \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 \u2248 1.884. In particular, for \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304, (\u03c31, \u03c32) is an equilibrium where\n2 + \u03c321 \u03b321 = 2 + \u03c322 \u03b322 = 2\u03b1\u2212 1. (10)\nLemma 6 is under the assumption that both platforms enter the market. The final point to check is whether any platform has an incentive to enter the market.\nProposition 3. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Also, recall \u03b1\u0304 \u2248 1.88 from Lemma 6. If an equilibrium exists in which both platforms enter the market, then\n\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 and \u03b2 \u2265 2\u03b1 (max{c1, c2} \u2212 1\n2 ). (11)\nConversely, for any \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 and any \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0304(\u03b1) such an equilibrium in which both platforms enter the market exists, where\n\u03b2\u0304(\u03b1) \u225c (2 + 1\n\u03b1\u2212 1 ) \u03b1 (max{c1, c2} \u2212\n1 2 ). (12)\nBoth parts of the result provide a lower bound on \u03b2, with the difference that the first part establishes a necessary condition for an equilibrium to exist, while the second part presents a sufficient condition. Note that the ratio between these two lower bounds converges to one as \u03b1 grows. However, we next highlight a subtle difference between the two results. Note that, for any value \u03be greater than 2 (max c1, c2 \u2212 12), we can choose sufficiently large \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that an equilibrium exists for these parameters and the ratio of \u03b2 over \u03b1 is less than or equal to \u03be. In other words, we have\ninf\n{ \u03b2\n\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b1, \u03b2 s.t. an equilibrium exists} = 2(max{c1, c2} \u2212 1 2 ) .\nThis, in fact, is a direct consequence of the second part of Proposition 3 along with the fact that \u03b2\u0304 converges to 2 (max{c1, c2} \u2212 12) as \u03b1 grows.\nHowever, the infimum mentioned above does not imply that any \u03b1 and \u03b2 satisfying the condition (11) will necessarily result in an equilibrium. In fact, as our proof establishes, to have an\nequilibrium for \u03b1 = \u03b1\u0304, we must have \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0304(\u03b1\u0304). In other words, we have\nsup \u03b1\u2265\u03b1\u0304 inf\n{ \u03b2\n\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b2 s.t. an equilibrium exists with the given \u03b1} = \u03b2\u0304(\u03b1\u0304). Cases 2 and 3 where only one platform enters the market: Suppose only platform 1 enters the market at some equilibrium. In this case, the first platform wants to choose the noise level \u03c31 as small as possible but also large enough so that user shares their data. Therefore, the platform chooses \u03c31 at the value that makes the user indifferent between sharing and not sharing (recall that we assumed the user breaks the ties in favor of the platforms), i.e.,\nUuser(\u03c31) = 1\n2 \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c31) = 0, (13)\nwhich implies \u03c321 = 2\u03b1\u03b3 2 1 \u2212 2. Notice that this is equivalent to the \u03c31 corresponding to points B and X in Figure 2b. Now, for this noise level to be an equilibrium, we need to verify two potential deviations: (i) platform one has no incentive to abstain from participating, i.e., their utility should be nonnegative, and (ii) the second platform has no profitable deviation by entering the market. Using (13), the first condition simply implies\n1 2 \u2212 c1 + \u03b2 1 2\u03b1 \u2265 0. (14)\nFor the second deviation check, we argue that it suffices to ensure the second platform\u2019s utility at point B in Figure 2b is nonnegative.\nLet us denote the noise levels corresponding to point B as (\u03c3B1 , \u03c3 B 2 ). To understand why we only need to check the point B, consider that, given platform one\u2019s chosen noise level (equal to \u03c3B1 ), if the second platform enters the market and selects a certain noise variance, it will result in a point on the line BX . The smallest noise level for the second platform that motivates the user to share their data with them (and thus has the potential to be profitable) is \u03c3B2 . One might argue that the second platform could opt for a very large noise level so that the vector of noise levels falls into the green region \u03a3\u0303(0,1), implying that only the second platform receives the data. However, this is not feasible, as the line BX stays within the blue region \u03a3\u0303(1,1) for any value of \u03c32 (and in fact, it becomes tangent to the border of \u03a3\u0303(0,1) and \u03a3\u0303(1,1) as \u03c32 approaches infinity). To confirm this, we need to demonstrate that\nUuser(\u03c3B1 , \u03c32) = 1\u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3B1 , \u03c32) \u2265 1\n2 \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c32) = Uuser(\u03c32),\nholds for any \u03c32. This is indeed the case, given that due to the submodularity of the revealed information, I(\u03c3B1 , \u03c32)\u2212I(\u03c32) decreases with increasing \u03c32 and equals I(\u03c3B1 ) = 12\u03b1 when \u03c32 = \u221e.\nNow, checking the second platform\u2019s utility at point B along with (14) yields the following result.\nProposition 4. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. For any i \u2208 {1, 2}, there exists an equilibrium in which only platform i enters the market if and only if ci \u2264 c\u2212i and\n\u03b2 \u2208 [ 2\u03b1(ci \u2212 1\n2 ), 2\u03b1(c\u2212i \u2212\n1 2 )\n] .\nCase 4 where no platform enters the market: Finally, we ask whether there is an equilibrium in which no platform enters the market. In such a scenario, we need to ensure no platform has a profitable deviation by entering the market and choosing some noise level. For instance, if platform 1 wants to deviate, the smallest noise level that they would choose would be \u03c3B1 as it makes the user indifferent between sharing and not sharing their data with them. In this case, the platform\u2019s utility, as derived in (14), is given by\n1 2 \u2212 c1 + \u03b2 1 \u03b1 ,\nwhich is nonpositive when \u03b2 \u2264 2\u03b1(c1 \u2212 12). Making the same argument for the second platform\u2019s deviation, we obtain the following result.\nProposition 5. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. There exists an equilibrium in which neither of the platforms enters the market if and only if\n\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03b1 ( min{c1, c2} \u2212 1\n2\n) ."

            "text": "We conclude this section by highlighting a few implications and insights of our results for the case K = 2, which, as we will see, also extend to the general case. Note that the term \u03b2 determines the value the buyer places on the user\u2019s data. The higher \u03b2 is, the more money the platform can earn by selling the user\u2019s data.\nOur results indicate that there are, at most, three main regimes for \u03b2, and the market equilibrium depending on the interval \u03b2 falls into. First, as established in Proposition 5, when \u03b2 is small, the platform\u2019s monetary gain from selling data is limited, so platforms may decide not to provide any service as they cannot fully compensate for their service costs. This regime would not exist if at least one of the platforms operates at a low cost, meaning its gain from the user\u2019s data already compensates for the cost of service (this corresponds to the case ci \u2264 1/2 for some i).\nOn the other hand, as shown in Proposition 3, when \u03b2 is large enough and platforms can charge a high price for the user\u2019s data, both platforms would enter the market. Finally, there is an intermediary regime for \u03b2 where only the platform with the lower cost enters the market, and the platform with a higher service cost opts out.\nInterestingly, the user\u2019s utility in all these cases would be equal to zero. However, the buyer\u2019s utility could be positive when both platforms enter the market. As we establish next, these obser-\nvations continue to hold in the general case with K > 2 platforms."

            "text": "This section shows how our equilibrium characterization extends to a general setting with any K > 2 number of platforms. In what follows, we make use of the following definition.\nDefinition 2 (High- and low-cost platforms). We say a platform i \u2208 [K] is of high cost if ci > 12 and is of low cost if ci < 12 .\nThe comparison of the cost to 1/2 in the above definition comes from the fact that the leaked information to any platform is Ii = 1/2 and therefore, high-cost platforms enter the market only if the payment they receive from the buyer is large enough. Conversely, low-cost platforms enter the market irrespective of the payment they receive from the buyer. We can view low-cost platforms as large platforms with small operation costs that do not need extra payments from the data buyer to enter the market and provide services. High-cost platforms, however, are small platforms with large operation costs that do need extra payments from the buyer to be able to provide service.\nTheorem 1. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. There exists \u03b1\u0304, \u03b2\u0304, and \u03b2 such that for \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304, we have the following:\n\u2022 If \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0304, an equilibrium of the game exists. Moreover, in any equilibrium, all platforms enter the market, the user utility is zero, and the buyer purchases the data of all platforms and has a strictly positive utility.\n\u2022 If \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2, an equilibirum of the game exists. Moreover, in any equilibrium, only low-cost platforms enter the market, the user utility is zero, and the buyer purchases the data of low-cost platforms and has a strictly positive utility only if there is more than one low-cost platform.\nLet us explain the qualifiers of Theorem 1 and then explain its intuition. First, notice that similar to the setting with K = 2 platforms, for small enough \u03b1 and also for intermediary values of \u03b2, a pure-strategy equilibrium may not exist. Therefore, we focus on large enough \u03b1 and also avoid intermediary values of \u03b2. In the proof of Theorem 1, we have provided explicit expressions for \u03b1\u0304, \u03b2\u0304, and \u03b2.\nTo gain the intuition of the first part of Theorem 1, notice that for large enough \u03b2 the data buyer gains a lot when the user\u2019s data is revealed to them and therefore is willing to pay a high price for the user data. This, in turn, means that even high-cost platforms find it optimal to enter the market. As established in Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, in equilibrium, the user shares with all platforms, and the data buyer purchases from all platforms. To see that the user utility becomes zero in equilibrium, suppose the contrary, that the user utility is strictly positive. This means that the equilibrium noise level strategy is in the interior of the set \u03a31,1. Given that noise level strategy is in the interior of \u03a31,1, there exists i \u2208 [K] such that by decreasing its noise level, we remain\nin the set \u03a31,1 (i.e., the user still finds it optimal to share with all platforms), but this deviation increases the payment and therefore the utility of platform i. Also, Lemma 3 guarantees that the user still finds it optimal to share with all platforms.\nTo gain the intuition of the second part of Theorem 1, notice that for small enough \u03b2, the data buyer\u2019s gain when the user\u2019s data is revealed to them is small and therefore, the buyer is willing to pay only a low price for the user data. This means that high-cost platforms will never find it optimal to enter the market. Nonetheless, the low-cost platforms always enter the market. The fact that the user shares with all the low-cost platforms (that have entered), the buyer purchases from them, and the user utility becomes zero in equilibrium follows from a similar argument to the one discussed above.\nTheorem 1 leads to the following insights.\nCompetition among platforms helps the buyer and not the user: Let us first characterize the equilibrium when we have only one platform.\nProposition 6. Suppose Assumption 1 holds. When K = 1, we have the following:\n\u2022 Suppose \u03b1 \u2264 1/\u03b321 . If c1 \u2264 1/2 + \u03b2\u03b321/2 (which holds whenever c1 \u2264 1/2), then in equilibrium, the platform enters the market and chooses \u03c31 = 0, the user shares with the platform, and the buyer purchases the data. In this case, the user utility is (1\u2212 \u03b1\u03b321)/2, and the buyer utility is zero. Otherwise, if c1 > 1/2 + \u03b2\u03b321/2, then the platform does not enter the market, and all utilities are zero.\n\u2022 Suppose \u03b1 > 1/\u03b321 . If c1 \u2264 1/2 + \u03b2/2\u03b1, then in equilibrium, the platform enters the market and chooses \u03c31 = \u221a 2(\u03b1\u03b321 \u2212 1), the user shares with the platform and the buyer purchases the data. In\nthis case, both the user utility and the buyer utility are zero. Otherwise, if c1 > 1/2+\u03b2/2\u03b1, then the platform does not enter the market, and all utilities are zero.\nWe are interested in the second regime where \u03b1 is large enough so that the user is not incentivized to share with the platform, irrespective of the noise level choice of the platform. In this case, as established in Proposition 6, both the user and the data buyer utilities are zero. Now, let us compare this setting to a setting with K \u2265 2 platforms that are competing to obtain the user\u2019s data and sell it to the data buyer, established in Theorem 1. Interestingly, we observe that competition does not help the user (as the user obtains zero utility for any K). However, increasing the number of platforms from K = 1 to K \u2265 2 improves the data buyer\u2019s utility. To gain the intuition for this observation, notice that the user\u2019s utility will always be zero because otherwise, the platforms can always decrease their noise levels by a small margin so that the user still shares and increases their payments. Now, why does the competition help the data buyer? This is because of the data externality among the platforms\u2019 data about the user, similar to that of Acemoglu et al. [2022] and Bergemann et al. [2020]. In particular, the data of a platform (because of the submodularity of the revealed information, proved in Lemma 3) decreases the marginal value of another platform\u2019s data, and therefore, the platforms end up competing with each other, and sell their data at lower marginal prices.\nMore platforms imply higher utilitarian welfare: Let us first find the overall utilitarian welfare in equilibrium, where utilitarian welfare is defined as the sum of the utilities of the platforms, the user, and the data buyer.\nCorollary 1. Consider \u03b1\u0304, \u03b2\u0304, and \u03b2 established in Theorem 1. For \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304, we have the following:\n\u2022 If \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0304, the utilitarian welfare in equilibrium becomes\nK\n( 1\n2 +\n\u03b2\n2\u03b1\n) \u2212 K\u2211 i=1 ci.\n\u2022 If \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2, the utilitarian welfare in equilibrium becomes\n(number of low-cost platforms) ( 1\n2 +\n\u03b2\n2\u03b1\n) \u2212 \u2211 i\u2208[K] : ci< 12 ci.\nNotably, Corollary 1 shows that, within the ranges of each case, the overall utilitarian welfare is increasing in \u03b2 and decreasing in \u03b1. This is because the payments always cancel each other out, and as \u03b2 increases, the data buyer\u2019s gain becomes larger, and as \u03b1 increases, the user\u2019s loss becomes larger. Moreover, in the first case, the utilitarian welfare is increasing in the number of platforms, and in the second case, it is increasing in the number of low-cost platforms."

            "heading": "6 Regulations",
            "text": "In this section, we consider regulations of the three-layer data market to improve the user utility. As we have established in Theorem 1, the user utility in equilibrium is zero. We now explore whether we can improve the user utility by imposing a regulation. As discussed in the introduction, one possible regulation is to impose a limit on the amount of information each platform can leak about the user to the data buyer. This means imposing a lower bound on the noise level. Let us formally define this regulation.\nDefinition 3 (Minimum privacy mandate). A minimum privacy mandate, represented by \u03c3\u0304 = (\u03c3\u03041, . . . , \u03c3\u0304K), is a regulation that mandates that each platform i \u2208 [K] must choose a noise level above \u03c3\u0304i \u2208 R+. A special case of this regulation is uniform minimum privacy mandate is such that \u03c3\u0304i = \u03c3\u0304 for all i \u2208 [K]. Another special case of this regulation is to ban the platforms from sharing with the buyer, i.e., \u03c3\u0304i = \u221e for all i \u2208 [K].\nUniform minimum privacy mandate versus ban: One may conjecture that banning the platforms from sharing their data with the buyer is user-optimal in the class of all uniform minimum privacy mandate regulations because it reduces the privacy loss of the user to zero. We next prove that this is not necessarily true. The main intuition is that if we ban data sharing, then only lowcost platforms enter the market. This, in turn, implies that the user does not obtain the gain from\nthe services provided by the high-cost platforms, and this loss in the service gain can dominate the gain in privacy loss. We next formalize this intuition.\nProposition 7. Consider \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 for \u03b1\u0304 established in Theorem 1. We have:\n\u2022 If all platforms are low-cost, then irrespective of the minimum privacy mandate, all platforms enter the market in equilibrium. In this case, banning data sharing achieves a higher user utility than any (uniform or non-uniform) minimum privacy mandate.\n\u2022 Otherwise, if there is at least one high-cost platform, then there exists \u03b2\u0303, \u03b2, and \u03c3\u0304 such that\n\u2013 If \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0303, then under uniform minimum privacy mandate \u03c3\u0304 all platforms enter the market, and the user utility is higher than banning data sharing.\n\u2013 If \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2, then irrespective of the minimum privacy mandate, only low-cost platforms enter the market. In this case, banning data sharing achieves a higher user utility than any uniform minimum privacy mandate.\nThe first part is rather straightforward: if all platforms are low-cost, then they all enter the market and provide services to the user. Banning data sharing is user-optimal because it decreases the privacy loss of the user to zero while the user obtains the service gains from all platforms. The second part is more nuanced: here, if \u03b2 is large enough, then all platforms enter the market. Now, there are two opposing forces in place. If we ban data sharing, only low-cost platforms enter the market, and user utility then comprises only the service gained from low-cost platforms, while the privacy loss becomes zero. Therefore, banning data sharing decreases the service gains but also decreases the privacy losses. If we do not ban data sharing, the user utility comprises the service gains from all platforms and the privacy loss incurred by the data sharing of all platforms with the buyer. Therefore, not banning data sharing increases the service gains but also increases the privacy losses. For a large enough minimum uniform privacy mandate, and when there is at least one high-cost platform, the service gains of the user utility dominate the privacy loss, and therefore, not banning data sharing becomes the user-optimal regulation. Finally, to understand the last part, we observe that for small enough \u03b2, only low-cost platforms enter the market, and therefore, the situation is effectively the same as the first part of Proposition 7. Notice that the assumption of large enough \u03b1 and large/small enough \u03b2 is adopted for the same reason as that of Theorem 1 so that an equilibrium exists.\nNon-uniform versus uniform minimum privacy mandate: As noted above, when all platforms are low-cost or when \u03b2 is small enough so that high-cost platforms do not enter the market, then banning data sharing is optimal in the class of all (uniform or non-uniform) minimum privacy mandates. However, corresponding to the second part of Proposition 7, the user prefers a minimum privacy mandate to banning data sharing when there is at least one high-cost platform, and \u03b2 is large enough. This is because if we ban data sharing, the high-cost platforms do not enter, while with the \u201cright\u201d choice of uniform minimum privacy mandate, they enter the market. In\nthis case, the user benefits from the services, while the privacy loss that they incur is small. However, with a uniform minimum privacy mandate, the low-cost platforms (that enter the market regardless of the minimum privacy mandate in place) also bring about privacy loss to the user. Therefore, a natural idea is to have a non-uniform minimum privacy mandate to help the user further. We next formalize this idea.\nProposition 8. Suppose there is at least one high-cost platform and consider \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 for \u03b1\u0304 established in Theorem 1. There exists \u03b2\u0302 and \u03c3\u0304 such that for \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0302 banning the low-cost platforms from data sharing and imposing minimum privacy mandate equal to \u03c3\u0304 for all high-cost platforms generates a higher user utility than any non-uniform minimum privacy mandate.\nWith the non-uniform minimum privacy mandate described above, the user obtains the service gain of the low-cost platforms and incurs zero privacy loss from them. Moreover, for large enough \u03b2, the high-cost platforms all enter the market. Therefore, the user gains from the highcost platforms\u2019 services, and when \u03c3\u0304 is large enough, it incurs a small privacy loss. Notice that, as established in Proposition 7, with the optimal uniform minimum privacy mandate, both the low-cost and high-cost platforms enter the market. We prove that if we impose the same minimum privacy mandate but only for high-cost platforms and ban the low-cost platforms, the user obtains the same service gain from all platforms but incurs a smaller privacy loss. Moreover, all platforms still find it optimal to enter the market.\nProposition 7 and Proposition 8 establish that banning the data market is not necessarily useroptimal, especially when we have high-cost platforms (i.e., smaller platforms whose cost of providing the service is high). Moreover, a uniform minimum privacy mandate improves the user utility because it also incentivizes the high-cost platforms to enter the market to provide service to the user. Finally, a non-uniform minimum privacy mandate that bans the low-cost (i.e., large) platforms from data sharing and imposes a minimum privacy mandate on high-cost (i.e., small) platforms further improves the user utility. This is because this regulation not only incentivizes the high-cost platforms to enter the market to provide service to the user but also zeros out the privacy loss of the low-cost platforms."

            "text": "In this paper, we study the intricate interplay between user privacy concerns and the dual incentives of online platforms: to safeguard user privacy and to monetize user data through sales to third-party buyers. To this end, we have constructed a multi-stage game model that captures the interactions between users, platforms, and data buyers. Our model delineates various scenarios where the interplay of platform service costs, the valuation of data, and privacy concerns dictate equilibrium outcomes. Additionally, we examine potential regulations designed to bolster user privacy and enhance market outcomes for users.\nThere are several exciting avenues for future research. In our framework, we have modeled a user as a representative of a market segment. Extending our analysis to a setting with multiple het-\nerogeneous users is very interesting. This is because data externalities among different users may cause indirect information disclosure, which in turn could alter both user strategies and potential regulations aimed at enhancing user experience. Similarly, our focus has been on a representative data buyer who aims to acquire user data and learn their preferences. Extending our findings beyond this is very valuable. This is because user data is inherently multi-dimensional and can be aggregated from diverse sources, potentially modifying user strategies and calling for tailored regulations. Lastly, we have investigated regulations that restrict the transfer of user data to buyers. The challenge of developing alternative regulatory frameworks that address the intricacies of the data market\u2014frameworks that are both adaptable and resilient enough to keep pace with swift technological advancements\u2014remains an open and important area for exploration."

(18)\nThe following lemma establishes the necessary and sufficient condition for (17) and (18) to hold for some (\u03c31, \u03c32) \u2208 \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0).\nNotice that if we move up on the boundary \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0), \u03c32 and \u03c3\u03031 both would increase, and hence, I(\u03c32) and I(\u03c3\u03031) both would decrease. Therefore, if (17) holds for some (\u03c31, \u03c32) \u2208 \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0), then it would hold for any upper point on the boundary. Similarly, if (18) holds for some (\u03c31, \u03c32) \u2208 \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0), then it would hold for any lower point on the boundary. Hence, if a point satisfies both conditions, then for any other point on the boundary \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0), at least one of the conditions would hold.\nNext, we show that, for the point given by (10), both conditions hold if \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 and neither hold if \u03b1 < \u03b1\u0304. Given our discussion above, this would show that for \u03b1 < \u03b1\u0304, there is no point for which both conditions hold and hence the proof would be complete.\nNow, let us first see why the point given by (10) is actually on the boundary \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0).\nConsider point X in Figure 3. For this point, we have\n\u03b321 2 + \u03c321 = \u03b322 2 + \u03c322 = 1 2\u03b1 .\nHence, the line 2 + \u03c321 \u03b321 = 2 + \u03c322 \u03b322\n(19)\npasses through point X , and therefore, it intersects with the boundary \u03a3\u0303(1,1) \u2229 \u03a3\u0303(0,0). Let us call this intersection A (see Figure 3) and denote it by (\u03c3A1 , \u03c3 A 2 ). Using (16) along with the fact that A is on the line (19), we can derive that\n2 + (\u03c3A1 ) 2\n\u03b321 =\n2 + (\u03c3A2 ) 2\n\u03b322 = 2\u03b1\u2212 1. (20)\nNow, let us consider the deviation to (\u03c3\u03031, \u03c3A2 ) which is on the boundary of \u03a3\u0303(1,1) and \u03a3\u0303(1,0), i.e.,\n1\u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u03031, \u03c3A2 ) = 1\n2 \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u03031). (21)\nLet\n\u03b7 = \u03b321\n2 + \u03c3\u03031 2 . (22)\nPlugging (20) and (22) into (21) and simplifying the equation yields\n\u03b7 \u2208 { 1\u2212 1\n4\u03b1 \u2212\n\u221a 16\u03b12 \u2212 16\u03b1+ 1\n4\u03b1 , 1\u2212 1 4\u03b1 +\n\u221a 16\u03b12 \u2212 16\u03b1+ 1\n4\u03b1\n} . (23)\nNext we argue that we should pick the smaller (first) solution. Notice that since \u03c3\u03031 \u2265 \u03c3A1 , we have \u03b7 = I(\u03c3\u03031) \u2264 I(\u03c3A1 ) = 1/(2\u03b1\u2212 1). In addition, Assumption 2, or equivalently (9), implies \u03b1 \u2265 3/2. In this regime, we have 1\u2212 14\u03b1 > 1 2\u03b1\u22121 . Thus, we should pick the smaller solution above.\nNow, we check the condition (17). Notice that we need to find \u03b1 such that\n\u03b7 + 1 2\u03b1\u2212 1 \u2264 1 \u03b1 . (24)\nWe can verify that the right-hand side minus the left-hand side is equal to zero at \u03b1\u0304 \u2248 1.88 and positive afterward. Notice that \u03b7 and therefore the condition (24) is symmetric with respect to both platforms, and consequently, considering the other deviation to (\u03c3A1 , \u03c3\u03032) leads to the exact same condition on \u03b1. This completes the proof of our claim that either both conditions hold if \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u0304 and neither hold if \u03b1 < \u03b1\u0304. \u25a0"

For any e, the noise level equilibrium strategy, if it exists, belongs to the boundary of the set \u03a31,e.\nProof of Lemma 7: Using Proposition 2, we know that the equilibrium noise variance belongs to \u03a31,e. We next argue that it cannot belong to the interior of \u03a31,e. To see this, suppose the contrary\nthat \u03c3 \u2208 int(\u03a31, e) is an equilibrium. There exists i \u2208 [K] such that by locally decreasing \u03c3i, we remain in the set \u03a31,e. We claim that platform i has an incentive to decrease its noise variance. First, note that by decreasing its noise variance, we remain in the set \u03a31,e and that the user still finds it optimal to share with platform i. However, the payment she receives from the buyer, which is given by\n\u03b2 (I(\u03c3, e,a,1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e,a, (bi = 0,1\u2212i)))\nincreases because of Lemma 4. \u25a0\nLemma 8. For any e, the noise level equilibrium strategy, if it exists, belongs to \u03a31,e \u2229 \u03a30,e.\nProof of Lemma 8: Using Lemma 7, we know that the equilibrium noise level, if it exists, belongs to the boundary of \u03a31,e and \u03a3a,e for some a \u2208 {0, 1}K \\ {1}. We argue that it cannot belong to \u03a31,e \u2229\u03a3a,e when a \u0338= 0. Suppose the contrary that \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a31,e \u2229\u03a3a,e is an equilibrium where ai = 1 and also aj = 0. We claim that platform i has an incentive to decrease its noise level. In particular, we argue that by decreasing its noise level, we go to int(\u03a31,e) and that platform i\u2019s utility increases. Notice that it suffices to show that by decreasing \u03c3i, we remain in the set \u03a31,e. This is because by invoking Lemma 4, the payment of platform i increases, and the users keep sharing with platform i. For \u03c3, the indifference condition for the user implies\u2211\ni: ei=1\naiIi \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3, e,a,1) = \u2211\ni: ei=1\nIi \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3, e,1,1)\nwhich can be written as \u2211 i: ei=1,ai=0 Ii = \u03b1 (I(\u03c3, e,1,1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e,a,1)) .\nNow if ai = 1, then by decreasing \u03c3i, the left-hand side does not change, and the right-hand decreases (from Lemma 4). Therefore, by decreasing \u03c3i, we remain in the set \u03a31,e. \u25a0\nFor a given e with ei = 1, platform i finds it optimal to enter the market if\n1 2 \u2212 ci + \u03b2 (I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 1,a\u2212i),1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 0,a\u2212i),1)) \u2265 0.\nTherefore, by letting\n\u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0304 := sup i\u2208[K],(ei=1,e\u2212i),\u03c3\u2208\u03a31,e\u2229\u03a30,e ci \u2212 12 I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 1,a\u2212i),1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 0,a\u2212i),1) ,\nall platforms enter the market. We next argue that this term is finite. Note that, for any given value of e\u2212i, the fact that \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a31,e \u2229 \u03a30,e implies that the term I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 1,a\u2212i),1) in the denominator is equal to\n|{i : ei = 1}| 2\u03b1 .\nAs a result, we can rewrite \u03b2\u0304 as\n\u03b2\u0304 = max i\u2208[K],(ei=1,e\u2212i) ci \u2212 1/2 |{i : ei = 1}|/(2\u03b1)\u2212 sup\u03c3\u2208\u03a31,e\u2229\u03a30,e I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 0,a\u2212i),1) .\nNotice that, for any given \u03b2\u2212i, the denominator is positive because the amount of leaked information strictly decreases when one less user shares information. Finally, \u03b2\u0304 is finite becasue the outer maximum is taken over finitely many elements.\nSimilarly, for a given e with ei = 1, when ci > 1/2 platform i finds it optimal to not enter the market if\n1 2 \u2212 ci + \u03b2 (I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 1,a\u2212i),1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 0,a\u2212i),1)) \u2264 0.\nTherefore, by letting\n\u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2 := inf i\u2208[K],ci> 12 ,(ei=1,e\u2212i),\u03c3\u2208\u03a31,e ci \u2212 12 I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 1,a\u2212i),1)\u2212 I(\u03c3, e, (ai = 0,a\u2212i),1) ,\nall platforms enter the market. We next prove that assuming a set of platforms that have entered the market, for large enough \u03b1, there exists an equilibrium. Without loss of generality, let us assume all platforms have entered the market. \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a31,1 \u2229 \u03a30,1 is an equilibrium noise level if no platform has a deviation. Let us consider platform 1. For this platform, the possible deviations are to \u03a31,1 \u2229\u03a3a,1 where a1 = 0 and a\u22121 can be any vector in {0, 1}K\u22121.

The leaked information about \u03b8 when the data of all platforms is shared with the buyer becomes\nKt\n1 + (K \u2212 1)t .\n\u2022 Suppose \u03b3i 2+\u03c32i = t for all i \u2208 [K] \\ {1} and \u03b31 2+\u03c321 = t\u2032.

This completes the proof of the first part. The second part follows from a similar argument. \u25a0\nLet us consider the deviation of platform 1 so that the corresponding user equilibrium is (a1 = 1,a\u2212i) with a\u2212i having i \u2212 1 ones and K \u2212 i zeros. Notice that if such deviation is not possible by increasing \u03c31, then this is not a profitable deviation for platform 1, and we now verify that even if such deviation is possible, it is not profitable for platform 1. Given that \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a31,1 \u2229 \u03a30,1, we have that the user is indifferent between sharing with all platforms and sharing with none of them. Therefore, we have\nK\u2211 i=1 Ii \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3K) = 0\nwhich gives us\nI(\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3K) = K\n2\u03b1 .\nUsing Lemma 9, the above equality gives us\nt = 1\n1 + 2\u03b1\u2212K .\nGiven the above deviation to (\u03c3\u03031, . . . , \u03c3K), the user indifference condition gives us\nK\n2 \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u03031, . . . , \u03c3K) =\ni 2 \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u03031, . . . , \u03c3i).\nSubstituting the closed-form expressions of Lemma 9 in the above equality gives us\nt\u2032 = 2\u2212 4\u03b1+K \u2212 i\u2212\n\u221a 16\u03b12 + (K \u2212 i)2 \u2212 8\u03b1K\n2 + 4\u03b1\u2212 2K ,\nwhere t\u2032 = \u03b3 2 1\n2+\u03c3\u030321 .\nNow, for this deviation to be not profitable, we must have\nI(\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3K)\u2212 I(\u03c32, . . . , \u03c3K) \u2265 I(\u03c3\u03031, . . . , \u03c3i)\u2212 I(\u03c32, . . . , \u03c3i).\nAgain, using the closed-form expressions of Lemma 9 and writing t\u2032 and t in terms of \u03b1, the above inequality becomes equivalent to\n\u22121 + 1\u2212K 2\u03b1\u2212 1 + i\u2212 1 2\u03b1\u2212 1 + i\u2212K + K 2\u03b1 + 2K \u2212 4\u03b1 K \u2212 i+ \u221a 16\u03b12 + (K \u2212 i)2 \u2212 8\u03b1K \u2265 0,\nwhich we prove next.

Notice that if we ban data sharing, then the user shares with all platforms (because there is no privacy loss), and its utility becomes\nK\u2211 i=1 Ii = K 2 .\nClearly, there is no uniform minimum privacy mandate that can make the user better off because banning data sharing maximizes the user gain from services and minimizes the privacy loss.\nNow, let us prove the second part of this proposition. By banning data sharing, only low-cost platforms enter the market, and the user shares data with all of them and obtains the following utility:\n1 2 ( number of low-cost platforms).\nNow consider a uniform minimum privacy mandate \u03c3\u0304 such that\n1 2 K \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many\n) > 1\n2 ( number of low-cost platforms).\nFor any \u03b1, as \u03c3\u0304 increases, the leaked information goes to zero, and therefore, so long as there exists at least one high-cost platform, a \u03c3\u0304 for which the above inequality holds exist. We next argue that all platforms enter the market for large enough \u03b2. To see this, we need to have\nIi \u2212 ci + \u03b2 ( I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many )\u2212 I( \u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 K\u22121 many\n) ) \u2265 0\nfor all i \u2208 [K]. Therefore, by letting \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2\u0303 where\n\u03b2\u0303 = max { \u03b2\u0304,\nci \u2212 12 I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many )\u2212 I( \u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 K\u22121 many )\n}\nand \u03b2\u0304 is specified in Theorem 1 all platforms enter the market. \u25a0"

Now suppose \u03c3\u0304 is the optimal uniform minimum privacy mandate so that all platforms enter the market, the user utility is\n1 2 K \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many\n),\nand that the utility of platform i is\nIi \u2212 ci + \u03b2 ( I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many )\u2212 I( \u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 K\u22121 many\n) ) \u2265 0.\nConsider a regulation that bans data sharing for low-cost platforms and uses the same minimum privacy mandate for high-value platforms. We first prove that all platforms still enter the market. First, notice that the low-cost platforms enter the market as they obtain a positive utility. Letting h be the number of high-cost platforms, the utility of a high-cost platform i becomes\nIi \u2212 ci + \u03b2 ( I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nh many )\u2212 I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 h\u22121 many\n) ) \u2265 Ii \u2212 ci + \u03b2 ( I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many )\u2212 I( \u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 K\u22121 many\n) ) \u2265 0,\nwhere the first inequality follows from the submodularity of the leaked information in actions, established in Lemma 3. The utility of the user also increases because we have\n1 2 K \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nh many\n) \u2265 1 2 K \u2212 \u03b1I(\u03c3\u0304, . . . , \u03c3\u0304\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK many\n),\nwhere the inequality follows from the monotonicity of the leaked information, established in Lemma 2. \u25a0"
