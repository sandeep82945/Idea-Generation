The cracking process heats hydrocarbons like ethane and naphtha in the presence of steam at temperatures between 700 and 900\u00b0C to convert the alkanes into alkenes and hydrogen.1 Coke, a solid carbonaceous by-product, is also formed during the production cycle and occasionally need to be removed from the reactor by combustion processes known as decoking. The repeated cycling between alkene production and decoking results in many changes to the reactor coil metallurgy, which are typically a high Cr-Ni HP type (Nb-Cr20-Ni30-Si) alloy. The alkene production cycle adds carbon to the bulk steel, causing precipitation of metal-carbides that can cause voiding in the steel due to the volumetric expansion of the carbide phases versus the bulk austenitic steel phase.2 To minimize carburization of the steel and to slow coke production, protective oxides are formed on the surface of the coil during the decoking cycles. The decoking cycle oxidizes the surface but occasionally causes delamination of the protective oxide coatings from the bulk alloy, which results in depletion of Cr from the coil and acceleration of carburization and coking. The main surface oxides formed are chromia (Cr2O3), Cr-Mn spinel (MnCr2O4), and silica (SiO2), with other minor oxides depending on the exact metallurgy used in the coil construction. It has been observed in previous reports that accidental addition of alkali metals (Na or K) to the production cycle feed results in shorter production cycle run lengths due to excessive amounts of coke production in the reactor coils.3-5 However, the exact mechanism for the poisoning of the reactor surface is not well understood. Devakotaii, et al. hypothesized that the alkali metals promote the formation of chromate and chromite species that melt at low temperatures and expose the underlying Fe-Ni alloy which catalyzes coke formation. If this mechanism was correct, then the poor run lengths would be temporary until enough Cr was able to diffuse to the surface to recover the chromia scale. In reality, exposure to alkalis results in permanent loss of run lengths and necessitates replacement of the affected steels. To further the understanding of the poisoning mechanisms, microscopic investigations of coil poisoning were conducted. Normal sample preparation techniques for microscopy are challenging due to the high abundance of Na and K in the environment.Metallographic polishingmay introduce alkalis from thewater used for the polishingmedia and rinses. Tominimize sample contamination, the authors have used standard FIB lift-out techniques to extract cross-sections of suspected poisoned furnace coils and have performed correlative imaging with both SEM-EDS for high spatial resolution phase mapping and TOF-SIMS for its high sensitivity to alkali metals. It was observed that the poisoned coils tend to have excess amounts of alkali metals in the silica phases near the surface, and with higher concentrations near phase boundaries near chromia and spinel grains (Figure 1). While the near surface alkali concentrations cannot be ruled out from sample handling, the Na and K in the interior of the coil is due to alkali introduction at high temperatures. The effect of alkali concentrations in the silica and chromia phases at high temperature is so far unknown.\nFig. 1.
