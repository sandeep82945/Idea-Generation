 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the relationship between religiosity and contraceptive use in a more religiously diverse sample. Since the current study population was mostly non-religious, studying populations with greater religiosity could provide more insight into the impact of religion on contraceptive use. 

2. Investigate the specific religious beliefs or doctrines that influence contraceptive use, rather than just religiosity in general. Different religions or denominations may have varying stances on contraception that shape people's behaviors. 

3. Explore the role of peer effects and social norms related to religion and contraception among college students. Students' contraceptive choices may be influenced by the attitudes and behaviors of their religious peer groups.

4. Conduct qualitative research to understand the reasoning behind delayed contraceptive use among religious individuals. Interviews or focus groups could provide more context on how religious beliefs impact views on sexuality and contraception.

5. Examine the relationship between religiosity, contraceptive use, and pregnancy/STD rates longitudinally. Tracking behaviors and outcomes over time could reveal longer-term impacts of religion on sexual health.
