 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Extend the method to work for multicomponent signals. The current method is limited to constant-amplitude, monocomponent sources. Modifying the theory and computation to handle more complex signal types would expand the applicability of the method.

2. Investigate the use of time delay embeddings to generate additional independent observations when m < n. The paper suggests using TDEs to create more "virtual sensors" but does not explore this in depth. Further research could determine optimal TDE parameters and quantify performance gains. 

3. Develop techniques to reconstruct the original source signals. The paper hints that a pseudoinverse of the mixing matrix may allow signal separation. This could lead to source reconstruction methods beyond just counting the number of sources.

4. Evaluate performance on real-world data sets and compare to existing statistical methods. While initial results seem promising, more rigorous testing on radar, sonar, or communication data would better validate the technique's capabilities. 

5. Explore modifications and alternatives to the persistent homology computation. The PH algorithm contains several tunable parameters that may be optimized. Other TDA tools could also be investigated as potential replacements.
