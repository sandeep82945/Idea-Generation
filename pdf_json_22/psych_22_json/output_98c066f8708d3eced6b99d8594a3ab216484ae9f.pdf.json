    "abstractText": "Background: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been increasing for the past two decades. Parents with autism have been known to be at risk of psychological distress and maladaptation, but many parents were able to overcome this adversity and lead to a good quality of life. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted among 21 parents of children with ASD. Interviews were transcribed and evaluated using thematic analysis. Results: The analysis discovered three main themes: acceptance and positive outlook, reaching for helping hands, and understanding autism and finding its solutions. Conclusions: Although the findings cannot be generalised to other populations with ASD, this study provides a detailed perspective on their unique coping strategies. Insights gained from this study could help health care providers, authorities, and communities to address a specific need and able to advocate relevant support measures to assist them.",

            "text": "The Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a combination of qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction, communication, repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped patterns of behavior [1]. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2013 grouped Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a single umbrella category, replacing the four different subtypes in DSM-IV-TR, which includes the autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder\u2014not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) [2]. ASD is a range of spectrum from mild to severely debilitating neurodevelopment disorder that typically presents before the age of 3 [1]. In Malaysia, it is estimated that there are approximately 12,800 cases of autism, and 1 out of 600 children in Malaysia are affected by ASD [3]. The prevalence of ASD has been increasing significantly over the past 20 years, which may be a consequence of a change in diagnostic criteria, policy, and practice changes, and increased awareness of the disorder [4]. Many studies have reported that parents who have children with ASD are at risk of psychological stress, anxiety, depression, and poor health compared to having children with other disabilities [5\u20137]. Parenting outcomes were influenced by ASD severity, behavioural problems related to ASD, communication skills, adaptation skills, and system support such as access to child services [8,9]. The families may experience financial strains, time pressures, marital conflict, social isolation, increased care time, reduced parental selfefficacy, inadequate support services, ongoing child advocacy, and uncertainty about the child\u2019s future as stressors increase [10,11]. Good family wellbeing creates a bi-directional effect; the positive cycle can reduce the child\u2019s problematic behaviour and increase positive response to the therapeutic invention. Conversely, impaired family functioning may result in adverse child outcomes [11,12].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2458. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042458 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nPrevious research exploring the experiences of families of children with disabilities living in rural areas is insufficient [13]. Parents in these areas have different cultural beliefs that have influenced their understanding of ASD as well as their decision-making [14] and accounted for inadequate knowledge and higher level of stigma among parents and in society [15]. The lack of ASD-related facilities in rural and suburban areas could lead to delayed assessment, diagnosis, and therapy to the children. However, recent research has shown that, although some families are at risk of having multiple challenges, many families respond positively and adapt to this stress [2,9,16]. There are four common categories of coping strategies used by parents of children with ASD: (1) active-avoidance (e.g., substance use, self-indulgence, and emotion sensation); (2) focused issues (e.g., planning, problem-solving, and seeking appropriate social support); (3) positive coping (e.g., use of humour, positive reframing, and acceptance); and (4) religious/denial (e.g., using religion or spirituality, pretending the problem does not exist) [17]. Many previous studies have shown that over time the family responses may vary from maladjustment to healthy adaptation or vice versa over time as a result of changes in types of stressors or challenges [8,18]. Resultantly, current literature has moved away from the single cause and effect relationship between parental stress and pathology and has highlighted families\u2019 successful adaptation and normality. Therefore, the Resilience Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation was used as a theoretical framework for investigating the coping mechanisms of parents with children having ASD in Northeast Malaysia [19]. The resilience model is a strength-based model that has evolved from the theory of family stress. The focus of the resilience model is on family resilience or their ability to maintain a healthy balance despite adversity. The model has been used in many families\u2019 stress, strengths, and outcomes studies of changes in family life, such as gains and losses, strains and transitions, and acute and chronic illnesses. The model helps to explain one\u2019s ability to recover or adjust or even triumph over life-related stressors and changes [20]. The Resilience Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation refers to conceptualized family resilience as two distinct but related processes or phases. The first process, adjustment, involves the influence of protective factors that facilitate the parent\u2019s ability and efforts to maintain functioning and perform developmental tasks in the context of risk factors. The second process, adaptation, involves the influence of the recovery factors in promoting the ability of the parent to rebound and adapt in situations of family crisis. The resilience model focuses on two levels of interaction: (a) individual family systems: This is how the family deals internally with problems or difficulties between its members. (b) Family-to-community: ways in which the family externally handles difficulties or problems through interactions between the family and the community [21]. This study\u2019s research question was how the parents cope with the challenges in nurturing a child with ASD. The parents\u2019 experiences on challenges of having children with ASD have been published in another paper [22]. This study aimed to explore the coping strategies of parents of children with ASD in Northeast Malaysia through the Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation Resilience Model. A greater understanding of the identified crisis and coping strategies will facilitate health care professionals and institutional agencies to provide better care and support for the maintenance of parental resilience [23]."

Therefore, phenomenology is employed to understand and describe a specific phenomenon in-depth and to reach the essence of the participants\u2019 experience of the phenomenon [24]. Parents who were primary caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD and were able to converse in the local language were included in the study.

When they agreed to participate, their contact number was obtained so that they could be contacted by phone by the first author. Those who confirmed their participation were scheduled for an appointment according to their preferences. From February 2019 to July 2019, 23 in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted.

The interviews were held in the Malay dialect and recorded using two digital voice recorders. The interviews were conducted in convenient locations, mostly at the hospital consultation room during the child\u2019s follow-up or therapy sessions. The interviews lasted between 1 and 2 h. The participants were informed that their participation was entirely voluntary, and they were free to withdraw if they felt uncomfortable during the interview. The participants were asked to complete the sociodemographic details (Table 1) prior to the interview. The interview began with open-ended questions and then followed by questions on parents\u2019 coping experiences based on the semi structured interview guide (Table 2). Subsequently, the conversation evolved according to the parents\u2019 answers to the initial questions. At the end of the interview, the participants were asked to spend 30 min writing an essay on their challenges and how to cope with these challenges. This complementary approach was used to increase the reliability of interview data and to acquire valuable yet relevant insights into the experience of parents who may be missed during the interview. For each interview, field notes were written based on our interpretation, knowledge, and interaction with the participants during the interview sessions. This note helped us better understand the phenomenon. Interviews were transcribed verbatim by either the first author or the hired transcriber. We conducted the pilot study, supervised by one of the authors that expert in qualitative study (RDM) to ensure the suitability and comprehensibility of the semi-structured interview guide and to provide the same set of important questions with a detailed account of the parents\u2019 experience. We included data from two of the pilot interviews in the analysis because of the rich data obtained. We invited these parents to join the formal study and subjected them to a second interview and an additional procedure after a week to ensure in-depth discussion and documentation of their account from their life experience.\nWhat helps you cope with the challenges or difficulties as a parent?\nAdjustment:\n\u2022 How do these issues help you in coping with your child with ASD? \u2022 What are the things you need to assist you as a parent?

First, the three researchers (W.N., L.H.Y. and M.M.Z.) critically re-read the first five transcripts to familiarize themselves with parents\u2019 comprehensive meaning and perspectives. The first author then created a preliminary list of nodes in the NVivo\u00ae, and we coded the transcripts. We initially analysed all transcripts individually before considering the identified themes together as a whole to form an overall group analysis and organized them into interconnected hierarchies (that is, themes, subthemes, and categories). Then we set a meeting (W.N., L.H.Y., M.M.Z. and R.D.M.) to agree on the codes. This triangulation process helped to reduce inter-rater difference and came out with the appropriate codes that could be used throughout the data analysis process continued by W.N. To increase trustworthiness and check for coding accuracy, the research supervisors (L.H.Y. and M.M.Z.) reviewed the preliminary units of the code of meaning for all interview transcripts. They compared data analysis and themes against a consistency check, resolving any differences through discussion. Additionally, RDM, an expert qualitative researcher, after first reviewing the coding units for five transcripts and the themes/subjects for the overall sample, provided general comments and suggestions. After completing the data analysis, we once again made a meeting to reach a consensus within the research team, agreeing on the final codes and the themes, subthemes, and categories. We emailed all the transcripts and final emergent themes back to all parents for validation and confirmation within 2 weeks. None of them disagreed with these reports."

The parents\u2019 mean age was 38 years (range = 29\u201354 years) with 8 fathers and 15 mothers that participated in this study. One mother had 5-year-old twins with ASD while another mother, all three of her children had ASD. The age of the children ranged from 2 to 14 years. The demographics of the parents are presented in Table 1.

            "text": "Acceptance of a child\u2019s condition becomes an essential part of the life of parents whose children have ASD. Parents\u2019 acceptance has an impact not only on their perception and well-being but also on their child. Therefore, acceptance was one of the most crucial elements of parent coping strategies observed in this study. Most parents feel that the key to well-being is to accept their children\u2019s condition first, and the rest will follow. Acceptance also helps parents cope with their caregiving tasks. Sixteen parents reported feeling anxious and sad about their children\u2019s future upon learning about their ASD diagnosis. However, their visit to the psychiatric clinic made them realize that there were other less-fortunate people. As a result, they adjusted their thoughts and beliefs about their children\u2019s condition and future. In addition, they became more positive and optimistic about adapting to a new life. P13 shared a turning point on her child\u2019s condition.\n\u201cOf course, I was sad, but when I went to the hospital for my son\u2019s therapy, I saw that other children were in a much worse condition like had to be wheelchair bounded. I thought I would have to be thankful because my son is physically healthy.\u201d\nHaving a strong faith in God or religion helps family accept and overcome any ASDrelated adversities. It gives meaning to their sacrifices. The parents explained how having and bringing up children with ASD strengthened their spiritual faith, which made them strong to overcome all the challenges they faced. Even though some parents initially felt sad about this fate, they later realized that God had given them a child with ASD not\nbecause of fate or past sins or misdeeds but because they had been specially chosen by God to take care of and raise such a special child. P19, father of two kids, told us, \u201cWe have always been grateful to have him. We have been very positive about this. Allah has chosen us to take care of this special child. We\u2019re the one chosen.\u201d The parents also believed that their child with ASD was a gift from God, a source of good fortune for their families, and a key to heaven. It was a gift from God that needed to be patiently cherished. \u201cEveryone\u2019s goal is heaven. My son will definitely enter heaven. My hope is that he will bring me and the whole family to heaven as well.\u201d (P9, businessman) Families become resilient when they accept the condition and actively pursue solutions to their problems, look positively beyond the challenges they are facing, and focus on making the best of the options available to them. There was no time to despair and be in grief for a long time.\n\u201cWe must be grateful. If we continue to grieve, the problem will never end. Over time, we will overcome this, we will accept his condition.\u201d (P14, gym trainer)\n\u201cDo not be ashamed of having an autistic child. We have got to accept them for who they are. We have got to treat them. Just spend more time with them. If we do not treat them, who else will?\u201d (P3, online seller)\nOnce the parents are able to accept their children\u2019s condition, the others will follow. Their acceptance and positivity will make others, particularly the partners/spouses, other children, extended family members, and society, understand and accept this condition.\n\u201cWhen we have accepted our son\u2019s condition, we are more open to telling others about our son\u2019s condition, some people will understand and start offering support. Well, it works for me.\u201d (P17, research assistant)\nThrough acceptance, parents found a positive attitude in their lives, leading to both mental and life adaptation. Most of the parents (90%) made changes in terms of their priorities, particularly in family planning, job criteria, and daily schedules. P8 commented:\n\u201cI purposely requested to be a counselor instead of a special officer for my daughter\u2019s sake . . . No matter how busy I am, I\u2019m going to make sure I\u2019m coming for her therapy.\u201d\nParents had also adapted to their daily routines. They knew that their lives could no longer be spontaneous; they had to properly plan their lives and focus on the needs of their children with ASD. Maintaining family routines was crucial to preserve family cohesion and create a predictable environment for children with ASD struggling with the changes and the new situations. Half of the parents described continuous anticipation of the worst outcome and were always prepared to deal with it. The parents always planned their activities to deal with unforeseen behaviours. P20 said: \u201cI know that he will throw a tantrum when he is hungry. So, I always bring food supply when we\u2019re on vacation\u201d."

All parents identified social, emotional, government, and network support systems as the most critical support for addressing these challenges. The parents reported that family is their main pillar of strength to help them overcome the difficulties in their lives when raising a child with ASD. Family togetherness in dealing with caregiving routines helps relieve stress among parents. P14 shared:\n\u201cWhen my eldest son, daughter, and my husband are around, we\u2019re going to do everything together, bathe him, feed him, wash him when he\u2019s pooping.\u201d\nSome of the parents had a very supportive and understanding partner/spouse to help them overcome this hardship. Five parents shared their experience of being comforted by their partners whenever they lost motivation to take care of their children. P11 always\nexpressed her stressful emotion to her husband. Similarly, P17 said: \u201cWhen I was studying, my husband helped me a lot to take care of our son.\u201d Their partners/spouses had helped them take a brief \u201cme time\u201d and take a break from the responsibility of caring for their child with ASD. Of the 21 parents, four believed that a short break from the routine caring for children with ASD would maintain their well-being and help them cope better. One of the parents said,\n\u201cDuring school holidays, when my husband is around, he\u2019s going to take care of our son so I can go somewhere for a short vacation.\u201d (P10, housewife)\nOthers received support from extended family members, such as parents, siblings, employers, and even the local community. The supports they received were shared responsibility for caring, financial and emotional support, and ensuring the physical safety of the child with ASD.\n\u201cI did not make much money. Luckily, my father is helping me with milk, diapers, and clothes for my daughter. Sometimes when I cannot pick her up because of work, he is going to help me pick her up in the kindergarten.\u201d (P2, driver)\n\u201cMy boss trusts me to arrange my own schedule without compromising my job. It makes it easier for me to come for the follow-up of my daughter.\u201d (P8, counselor)\nThe parents also appreciated the social support they received from close friends, technologically advanced social networks, and parents\u2019 support community. It is a platform for acquiring relevant information on autism and the provision of emotional support and care advice, which are essential for their coping strategies.\n\u201cI always participate in the programs related to autism such as \u2018Cakna Autism Kelantan\u2019. We always make family gatherings. It\u2019s a way for us to ventilate our emotions, share opinions, and get advice.\u201d (P9, businessman)\nThe parents received assistance from the government through a \u2018person with different ability\u2019 \u201corang kelainan upaya (OKU)\u201d card. The \u2018OKU\u2019 card gives children with ASD many benefits, such as accessibility to special education/schools, lower hospital fees, parking lots, and many more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good in terms of facilities. The government has given him access to a lot of facilities through this \u2018OKU\u2019 card. The \u2018OKU\u2019 card benefits him, which is why they apply for it.\u201d (P20, physiotherapist)"

The parents\u2019 goal in these actions was to improve the children\u2019s capabilities and potential and prepare them for the future. Many parents (76%) began to educate themselves and the family about autism and its treatment. The parents reported making various attempts to gain resourceful information from close families working in the medical field, other parents, teachers, and healthcare providers. Subsequently, the parents shared their earnest attempt to understand this condition through in-depth searching on the Internet, Facebook, and books. It is a strategy that has convenient purposes but might also lessen the parents\u2019 feeling of powerlessness.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about autism before. Zero! After my son had autism, I did an in-depth reading on the Internet. I just know about autism and finally understand it. Now, I am more open minded to this.\u201d (P21, housewife)\nParents had tried their best and consistently followed all the intervention programs planned by the healthcare professional in hospitals and private therapeutic services, with the hope of a bright future for their children and a strong desire for their independence. All parents indicated that there had been an improvement in their children\u2019s abilities over time. P1 had excitedly quoted:\n\u201cI am always looking forward to his therapy. A lot of new things and tips I have learned from doctors and therapists about my son\u2019s therapy, which I can perform at home. I have seen a lot of improvement in him. He had poor eye contact before, but now he can focus. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d (P1, housewife)\nSome of the parents lowered their expectations on their children\u2019s capabilities. The parents also learned to appreciate their children\u2019s little achievement. They found that this coping strategy could ameliorate the effects of autism on them and help uphold their sense of hope.\n\u201cAlthough I spend a lot of money on private therapy, I am satisfied because he showed a lot of positive changes. Even though he is just able to hold the pencil right, it is a significant improvement for me.\u201d (P17, research assistant)\nFinally, the parents\u2019 cultural belief influences how parents cope with and handle this disorder. Aside from complying with professional therapies and advice, some parents (33 percent) tried using alternative methods, such as seeing traditional healers and Islamic Complementary Medicine (e.g, Darul Syifa), to optimally help their children. Parents made efforts to ensure that the child is \u201chealed\u201d or reduced in the severity of the condition.\n\u201cI met an ustaz (Islamic Healer).

            "text": "This study explored the experience of coping in the process of achieving resilience among parents of children with ASD in Northeast Malaysia. The analysis of the parent\u2019s interviews in this study revealed dynamic mechanisms for becoming resilient in the Malay context. The three themes identified were acceptance and positive outlook, reaching for helping hands, and understanding autism and finding its solutions. In this study, the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation was used as a theoretical framework to describe how the parents developed protective coping mechanisms to help them build and maintain resilience. Despite the many challenges in raising children with ASD, families survive through a variety of coping strategies. Over time, the parents realized and learned that their perception of their children\u2019s condition would have an impact on the outcome or consequences. In this study, we found that most parents were grateful and positively appreciative of this condition from being a crisis or stressor to a challenge and began to accept their children\u2019s condition [1]. Therefore, parents changed their life priorities and adjusted their routines and life plans to best suit their children\u2019s condition. They were empowered to be more vigilant in raising their children. It is an essential initial step toward adapting to the challenges of caring for children with ASD. As a result, the findings of our study are similar to a lot of research on coping strategies among parents who have children with ASD [2\u20135]. Social support appears to be a coping strategy that alleviates the stress felt by parents and improves their well-being and positive attitude toward their children with ASD [6,7]. This study demonstrated that a supportive environment and a high level of family cohesion can help parents manage their children with ASD. In this study, the parents reported that the family members had a high level of patience and were determined to work together to take good care of the child with ASD. The parents also reported how communication within the family improved since they had this special child. They have always felt a sense of relief, knowing that they can rely on their spouse when things become hard. The parents were able to ventilate their stress to their spouse and take a short time away from the child with ASD. Shared responsibilities contributed to better adaptation in these families [8,9]. Family cohesion also extended beyond the nuclear to the extended family. The parents and every member of the family were able to make a meaningful contribution to the life changes accompanying the child\u2019s upbringing, which, in turn, has increased resilience and improved adaptation.\nAside from family support, this study demonstrated that social support has also been provided by local communities, autism societies, and government. The parents were surrounded by a neighborhood that was very supportive, understanding, and helpful in ensuring the child\u2019s physical safety. Even though some who lack awareness of ASD may have shown unpleasant reactions, the local communities accepted them without any judgment. It gave them a sense of security and helped them build resilience. Similarly, the support received from the autism communities, either the parents\u2019 groups or the social network, significantly helped these parents manage these children with ASD. It helped them gain knowledge about autism and obtain advice to improve self-efficacy, enabling them to feel a high level of confidence and less stress in parenting children with ASD [10,11]. Ilias and Liaw [5] reported disparities in the quality and accessibility of resources provided by the government. However, the parents in this study still received support from the government in terms of OKU card. The OKU card provides benefits to children with ASD in so many ways and guarantees their future. This study supports the findings by Ilias and Cornish [12], indicating that society and government support also plays a crucial role in building resilience. Previous research has explained how spiritual and religious beliefs have influenced parents\u2019 understanding and response to their children with ASD [2,9,16]. Religious beliefs have helped them make positive interpretations of having a child with ASD and given them support and encouragement during their difficult times. In the same way, this study demonstrated that having strong faith in God changed their belief and perception of this condition [4]. Strong faith encourages them to accept the child\u2019s condition and to always be patient and tolerant at any time [17]. They treasure this child as a precious gift from God. They believed that they were the chosen one who had the opportunity for a better afterlife [18]. By putting all hopes in the hands of God, they felt closer to God and at ease, and they found resilience in their lives. Parents found that gaining knowledge about autism is a fundamental aspect that would help them cope with this hardship [19]. Having a child with ASD encouraged parents to find out as much as possible about all the aspects of this condition, the treatments, and the services available to ensure that the child receives the most appropriate care. By seeking information and training, parents became acquainted with their child\u2019s disorder and treatment [1]. They acquired knowledge from a variety of resources, including close families and friends; professional staff such as doctors, therapists, and teachers; and the Internet [20]. The Internet is an authoritative source of information for parents. They found that the information they had acquired from the lived experience of other ASD parents on Facebook had guided them in dealing with their children with ASD in their daily lives [8]. Similarly, the knowledge and advice obtained from professional staff, in particular, about the methods of behavioural modification, can help parents cope with ASD in their children [11]. In this study, the parents adapted problem-oriented strategies for coping with their children\u2019s condition [21]. Over time, the parents began to fully understand the extent of their child\u2019s disability and limitations. They articulated their efforts to arrange professional and non-professional treatments (e.g., traditional healers and complementary medicine) for their child and to develop strategies for their functional abilities [11,16,20]. The parents\u2019 objective in these activities was to optimize the children\u2019s capabilities and potential of their children as well as to prepare them for the future. The parents were committed to all therapy sessions to make the child better. They realized that having high expectations and wanting the child to be completely normal are unrealistic and have increased their stress levels. Therefore, parents have learned that having realistic goals and lowering their expectations will help them accept the child\u2019s condition and achieve increased sensitivity, increased confidence and assertiveness, greater opportunities to learn, and a feeling of strength in the face of adversity. Parents have learned to appreciate and cherish little improvement in their children. In addition, they found that their lives could be happier and more meaningful by doing so. The health care professionals could use these study findings to create a module,\ncourse, pamphlet, or therapy session for parents on coping strategies in handling children with ASD. For example, to conduct a therapy session for parents on adapting their children that are newly diagnosed with ASD by accepting and having a positive outlook. Health care professionals could also organize a course for parents on how and when to search for help from various sources and support groups and to create a module or pamphlet on parents\u2019 education to understand more on autism and find its solution. The findings of this study are limited by the number of participants representing each ethnic group, which was inadequate and lacked involvement from fathers. However, it displayed the true ethnic proportions in this area, where 98% are Malays, and most of the main carers for children were their mothers. Another area that should have been emphasized is the socioeconomic background of the carers, which could be an important factor in their coping mechanism to having children with autism. Another limitation is that the structured interview guide might influence the direction of the responses and overlooked any negative coping mechanisms from the parents. We recommend including other ethnic groups and fathers as well as to have a wider structured interview guide to gain better understanding of the adaptation process of autism on the families."
