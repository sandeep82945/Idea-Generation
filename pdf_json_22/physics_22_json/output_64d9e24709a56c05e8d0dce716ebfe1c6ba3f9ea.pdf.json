    "abstractText": "The scattering picture of electron transport in mesoscopic conductors shows that fluctuations of the current reveal additional information on the scattering mechanism not available through the conductance alone. The electronic fluctuations are coupled to the electromagnetic field and a junction at finite bias or temperature will emit radiation. The nonsymmetrized current-current correlators characterize the emission and absorption spectrum. Recent interest is focused on the socalled delta-T noise, which is the nonequilibrium noise caused by a temperature difference between the terminals. Here, we generalize the notion of delta-T noise to the nonsymmetrized currentcurrent correlator at finite frequencies. We investigate the spectral density for energy-independent scattering and for a resonant level as an example of energy-dependent scattering. We find that a temperature difference \u2206T leads to a partial reduction of the noise for certain frequency ranges. This is a consequence of temperature broadening in combination with a frequency shift of the involved Fermi distributions. In the case of energy-independent scattering, the lowest order is a quadratic \u221d (\u2206T ) correction of the thermallike noise spectrum. For the resonance, an additional contribution to the delta-T noise spectrum arises that is \u221d \u2206T to the lowest order.",

Belzig1\n1Fachbereich Physik, Universita\u0308t Konstanz, D-78457 Konstanz, Germany (Dated: April 14, 2023)\nThe scattering picture of electron transport in mesoscopic conductors shows that fluctuations of the current reveal additional information on the scattering mechanism not available through the conductance alone. The electronic fluctuations are coupled to the electromagnetic field and a junction at finite bias or temperature will emit radiation. The nonsymmetrized current-current correlators characterize the emission and absorption spectrum. Recent interest is focused on the socalled delta-T noise, which is the nonequilibrium noise caused by a temperature difference between the terminals. Here, we generalize the notion of delta-T noise to the nonsymmetrized currentcurrent correlator at finite frequencies. We investigate the spectral density for energy-independent scattering and for a resonant level as an example of energy-dependent scattering. We find that a temperature difference \u2206T leads to a partial reduction of the noise for certain frequency ranges. This is a consequence of temperature broadening in combination with a frequency shift of the involved Fermi distributions. In the case of energy-independent scattering, the lowest order is a quadratic \u221d (\u2206T )2 correction of the thermallike noise spectrum. For the resonance, an additional contribution to the delta-T noise spectrum arises that is \u221d \u2206T to the lowest order.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe electron transport in mesoscopic conductors is investigated using the statistics of the electron current, where the first moment corresponds to the average current and the second moment to the noise [1\u20133]. Unavoidable sources of noise are thermal noise at a finite temperature - the so-called Nyquist-Johnson noise [4, 5] and nonequilibrium shot noise [6]. The former is caused by thermal fluctuations in the occupation number and the latter by the stochastic partitioning of charge carriers. The noise at a tunnel junction can be used for primary thermometry [7].\nAt finite frequencies, the noise involves current operators taken at different times. In general, these operators do not commute, so the symmetrized correlator is studied as an observable [1, 8]. A detector that distinguishes between the transfer of an energy quanta ~\u03c9 from or to the conductor can access the nonsymmetrized correlator [8, 9]. Indeed, when the fluctuations interact with an electromagnetic field, the energy transfer rate is connected to the nonsymmetrized noise spectrum. Negative frequencies account for the radiated power when one photon is generated in the radiation field and, vice versa, positive frequencies for the absorbed power when one photon is annihilated. In a thermally occupied radiation field, the measured noise power spectrum is a sum of the nonsymmetrized noise spectra at negative and positive frequencies. The prefactors are determined by the Bose-Einstein distribution and, consequently, by the temperature of the electromagnetic field [8, 9].\nShaping a possible ac-excitation can strongly influence the noise properties [10] and can be interpreted as electron-hole pair excitation on the Fermi sea [11]. A noise reduction due to driving was experimentally\nobserved [12, 13] and measurements at finite frequency reveal a squeezed nonequilibrium state [14].\nA fundamental nonequilibrium noise due to a temperature difference \u2206T was recently demonstrated by Lumbroso and coworkers [15\u201317] in atomic and molecular junctions. This noise, dubbed delta-T noise, is related to the voltage-driven shot noise and inherits the properties of partition noise [18]. Using the scattering approach, they obtain an approximation of the noise, which is then decomposed into a thermal and a delta-T component. The thermal component corresponds to thermal noise at the average temperature, and the lowest order delta-T component is similar to the quantum shot noise except for different numerical prefactor and scales with (\u2206T )2 instead of the voltage squared. Another study [17] measured and calculated the noise of a voltage-and temperature-biased metallic tunnel junction. This setup operates at a very low temperature and is not restricted to small relative temperature differences. At the limit, when one terminal is at zero temperature and no voltage is applied, the noise has the form of thermal noise with an additional factor 2 ln 2 [18].\nIn a quantum Hall bar furnished with a quantum point contact, the delta-T noise can serve as an instrument to discriminate between electron and quasiparticle tunneling [19, 20]. Tunneling of chiral fractional quantum Hall edge states exhibits a negative delta-T noise, in contrast to a positive contribution in the noninteracting case. A sign inversion, from negative back to positive, may also be forced by changing the transmission of the quantum point contact or applying a voltage. The negative signal is attributed to the scaling dimension of the leading charge tunneling operator [21, 22]. Their results suggest that the negative sign is a property due to many-body interactions. In comparison, a quantum dot in the SU(2) Kondo region has no negative delta-T ar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n04 98\n4v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n1 2\nA pr\n2 02\n3\n2 1\n2\nbarrier\nTh\nTc\n0.0\n0.5 hot emitter\n0.0\n0.2\n+\n\u2212\n\u2206T -noise\n0 5\n~\u03c9/[kB(Th + Tc)]\n0.0\n0.2 cold emitter\n+\n+\nFIG. 1. The mesoscopic conductor consists of a hot reservoir with a temperature Th and a cold reservoir with a temperature Tc, separated by a potential barrier. In the hot reservoir, more electrons are excited at higher energies, as illustrated by electrons farther away from the surface. The current-current correlator depends on the scattering amplitudes (simplified depicted by the arrows) of electrons (depicted by circles with a minus sign) and holes (depicted by circles with a plus sign) as well as the probability distribution of the terminal from which they originated. Current-current fluctuations are related to the energy transfer rate between the mesoscopic conductor and an electromagnetic field, i.e. to the emission and absorption spectrum. The energy difference ~\u03c9 between the electron and the hole corresponds to the energy of the annihilated or excited photon. We separate the spectrum into an equilibrium part (thermallike), a superposition of a hot and cold emitter, and a nonequilibrium part, given by a deltaT noise spectrum. The delta-T noise spectrum is negative at some frequencies, thus diminishing the thermallike noise spectrum. In the shown case, energy-independent scattering is assumed.\nnoise [23], thus the effect does not occur in this case despite the presence of strong correlations. Further, delta-T noise was employed to study experimentally the heat transport of edge modes [24].\nAn investigation of the relative sizes shows that delta-T noise never exceeds the thermallike noise under the zero-average current condition [25]. In [25] they studied a resonant level as an example for energy-dependent scattering. In the limit of a small resonance width, the size of delta-T noise approaches the thermallike noise. Furthermore, they investigated noise of heat transport, which is not subject to a limit like charge noise. More recently, bounds on the spin and heat current noise were investigated [26].\nIn this work, we address the nonsymmetrized finitefrequency noise spectrum of a temperature-biased mesoscopic conductor. We are interested in separating\nthe light emission and absorption into a thermallike and delta-T spectrum. Figure 1 gives an illustrative summary of the considered system and our findings in the case of energy-independent scattering. The mesoscopic conductor is described within the scattering approach, where one terminal assumes a hot temperature and the other a cold temperature. We define the thermallike noise spectrum as the average of the thermal noise spectra at the hot and the cold temperature. Consequently, the delta-T noise spectrum is defined similar to the excess noise spectrum [1, 27, 28]. Two distinct contributions to the delta-T noise are obtained, S\u2206T1 (\u03c9) comes from the correlations of occupied and free electronic states with different Fermi statistics, and S\u2206T2 (\u03c9) from occupied and free states with the same statistics but associated with a different rate per recombination event than assumed in the thermallike noise. If the scattering is energy independent or the same from both sides, the latter contribution vanishes. Our main result is that the delta-T noise spectrum can get negative at some frequencies, reducing the thermallike noise spectrum. Below, we investigate the spectra for energy-independent scattering and a single resonant level model. In the resonant case S\u2206T1 (\u03c9) has a suppressed negative part for the chosen parameters and additionally shows a contribution S\u2206T2 (\u03c9).\nThe work is structured as follows. In the second section II, we introduce the scattering approach and summarize the connection to light emission and absorption. Afterwards, we define the thermallike noise spectrum and discuss the delta-T noise spectrum for general scattering matrices. As an application, we consider energy-independent scattering in section III and then a resonant level in section IV. Our results are recapped in section V."

By averaging over the quantum statistical ensemble, the av-\nerage current \u3008I\u0302\u03b1(t)\u3009 is obtained. A positive sign means that the current leaves the reservoir, and vice versa, a negative sign means that it enters. Current fluctuations are characterized by the auto- and cross-correlations of the current operator. We are interested in the nonsymmetrized correlator\nS\u03b1\u03b2(t, t \u2032) = \u3008\u2206I\u0302\u03b1(t)\u2206I\u0302\u03b2(t\u2032)\u3009 ,\u2206I\u0302\u03b1(t) = I\u0302\u03b1(t)\u2212 \u3008I\u0302\u03b1(t)\u3009.\n(2) In the absence of a time-dependent external field, the correlations depend only on the time difference t \u2212 t\u2032.

In general, s\u2020(E)s(E\u2032) 6= 1 for E 6= E\u2032 and thus the noise spectrum can be complex.\nWe focus on the total current I\u0302(t) = [I\u03021(t)\u2212 I\u03022(t)]/2 and investigate the total noise spectrum for this symmetric choice of the currents [32\u201334]\nS(\u03c9) :=2 \u222b dtei\u03c9t\u3008\u2206I\u0302(t)\u2206I\u0302(0)\u3009\n= \u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2\u2208{1,2}\n\u222b dE \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9)f\u03b1(E)f h \u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9), (4)\nwith\n\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9) = e2\n4\u03c0~ Tr\n( A\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9)A \u2020 \u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9) ) (5)\nand the matrices\nA11 =s \u2020 21(E + ~\u03c9)s21(E) + 1\u2212 s\u202011(E + ~\u03c9)s11(E) A22 =s \u2020 12(E + ~\u03c9)s12(E) + 1\u2212 s\u202022(E + ~\u03c9)s22(E) A12 =s \u2020 21(E)s22(E + ~\u03c9)\u2212 s\u202011(E)s12(E + ~\u03c9) A21 =s \u2020 22(E)s21(E + ~\u03c9)\u2212 s\u202012(E)s11(E + ~\u03c9). (6)\nFurther on, the term total noise spectral density is abbreviated as noise spectrum. The form Eq. (4) directly implies that the noise spectrum is positive, since for a complex matrix A, the matrix A\u2020A has only positive eigenvalues and thus a positive trace Tr ( A\u2020A ) \u2265 0. With the same argument and the monotonic decrease of the Fermi functions, the inequality\nS(\u03c9) \u2265 S(\u2212\u03c9) for \u03c9 \u2265 0 (7)\nfollows. This result holds irrespective of the applied voltage or temperature difference. In the next paragraph, we introduce the connection to light emission and absorption, where the inequality has an illustrative interpretation.\n4 The mesoscopic conductor can act as an antenna, where the current fluctuations couple to an electromagnetic field [8, 9, 35]. We assume a linear coupling between\nthe total current operator I\u0302(t) and the electromagnetic vector potential operator. Fermi\u2019s golden rule gives the transition rates for absorption and emission of a photon and thus the rate at which energy is transferred [36]. To establish a connection, we consider the rewritten noise spectrum\nS(\u03c9) = 2\u03c0 \u2211 i,f pi| \u3008i|\u2206I\u0302(0) |f\u3009 |2\u03b4(Ei \u2212 Ef + ~\u03c9), (8)\nwhere pi is the statistical weight along with Ei the energy of the initial state |i\u3009, and Ef the energy of the state |f\u3009. The energy transfer rate when emitting one photon from the conductor is proportional to the noise spectrum for \u03c9 < 0 and vice versa, when absorbing one photon to the noise spectrum for \u03c9 > 0. Therefore, the noise spectrum at negative frequencies is referred to as the emission spectrum and that of positive frequencies as the absorption spectrum. Utilizing \u2206I\u0302(0) instead\nof I\u0302(0) in expression (8) differs by a DC component, which contributes nothing to the energy transfer. The inequality (7) now states that the energy transfer rate at which the conductor absorbs from the electromagnetic field is always greater than or equal to the rate at which it transfers energy to the field.\nWe follow the interpretation in [37]. The physical processes involve electrons with energy E and holes with energy E + ~\u03c9 which are scattered in the mesoscopic conductor and afterwards recombine to emit or absorb energy ~\u03c9. When electrons come from terminal \u03b1 and holes from terminal \u03b2, then they contribute \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9)f\u03b1(E)f h \u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9) to the differential energy transfer rate\ndS(E,\u03c9) = \u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2\u2208{1,2} \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9)f\u03b1(E)f\nh \u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9)dE.\n(9)\nOn average, there are f\u03b1(E) electrons and f h \u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9) holes participating in f\u03b1(E)f h \u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9) recombination events. This is evident by rewriting f\u03b1(E)f h \u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9) = \u3008n\u0302e\u03b1(E)n\u0302h\u03b2(E + ~\u03c9)\u3009 as the expectation value of the electron number operator n\u0302e\u03b1(E) and the hole number operator n\u0302h\u03b2(E). The functions \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 correspond to the rates per recombination event. They depend solely on the scattering amplitudes of the electrons and holes traversing the conductor.\nB. Definition of the delta-T noise spectrum\nIn the tradition of analyzing noise, two distinct contributions of different origins were identified [1, 4\u20136].\nOne is the equilibrium noise (Nyquist-Johnson noise) at thermal equilibrium, attributed to the thermal agitation of the charge carriers, and the other is the nonequilibrium partition noise (shot noise), which arises because an incident charge carrier beam is stochastically divided. Hence, it is a consequence of charge quantization. In the next paragraph, we are concerned with the question how can the noise spectrum be partitioned into an equilibrium (thermallike) and a nonequilibrium (delta-T ) component in the presence of a temperature difference.\nIn the case of zero frequency and an energy-independent scattering matrix, the thermallike noise is given by\nSth(\u03c9 = 0) = Sth = 2GkBTh + 2GkBTc, (10)\nwith G = G0 \u2211 nDn the conductance, the conductance quantum G0 = 2e 2/h, and Dn the transmission probability of the n-th eigenchannel [1]. Half of the thermallike noise consists of the Nyquist-Johnson noise at the hot temperature and half at the cold temperature. We interpret that as the thermal agitation of two isolated equilibrium systems and understand the thermallike noise as the average Sth = (STh + STc)/2 of them, with ST\u03b1 the noise at zero frequency and equal temperature T\u03b1 in both reservoirs. Following this interpretation, the thermallike noise for finite frequencies is defined as\nSth(\u03c9) := STh(\u03c9) + STc(\u03c9)\n2 , (11)\nwhere ST\u03b1(\u03c9) is the noise spectrum at equal reservoir temperature T\u03b1. From the standpoint of light emission, the thermallike spectrum manifests as the superposition of independent hot and cold emitters. In [23] an equivalent definition is used to account for the thermallike part in a system with interacting electrons. After some calculation and using the unitary property of the scattering matrix, the thermallike noise can be written as\nSth(\u03c9) = \u222b dE \u03b3th(E,\u03c9) \u2211 \u03b1\u2208{1,2} f\u03b1(E)f h \u03b1(E + ~\u03c9) 2 ,\n(12)\nwith\n\u03b3th(E,\u03c9) =\u03b311(E,\u03c9) + \u03b312(E,\u03c9) + \u03b321(E,\u03c9) + \u03b322(E,\u03c9)\n= e2\n4\u03c0~ Tr\n[ |s11(E)\u2212 s11(E + ~\u03c9)|2\n+ |s22(E)\u2212 s22(E + ~\u03c9)|2 + |s12(E) + s12(E + ~\u03c9)|2\n+ |s21(E) + s21(E + ~\u03c9)|2 ] , (13)\nwhere |a|2 = a\u2020a is implied in the multi-channel case. At zero frequency, the expression coincides with the ther-\n5 mallike noise defined in [25] and reduces to\nSth = 2e2\n\u03c0~ \u222b dE \u2211 n Dn(E) \u2211 \u03b1=1,2 f\u03b1(E)f h \u03b1(E), (14)\nwith Dn(E) the energy-dependent transmission probability.\nEquipped with the definition of the thermallike noise, the nonequilibrium contribution is identified as the excess noise spectrum S\u2206T (\u03c9) := S(\u03c9) \u2212 Sth(\u03c9). This nonequilibrium noise spectrum is referred to as delta-T noise spectrum. We interpret the delta-T noise spectrum by using the picture of recombining electrons and holes. Electrons are denoted as hot or cold if they are distributed according to the Fermi function f1 = \u3008n\u0302e1\u3009 with temperature Th or according to the Fermi function f2 = \u3008n\u0302e2\u3009 with temperature Tc, respectively. This designation also applies to holes. The same rates \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 are present in the entire noise spectrum (4) and the thermallike spectrum (12). The difference manifests itself in the number of recombination events. For example, the actual noise spectrum includes the contribution \u03b312\u3008n\u0302e1n\u0302h2 \u3009, where hot electrons recombine with cold holes. The corresponding term \u03b312\u3008(n\u0302e1n\u0302h1 + n\u0302e2n\u0302h2 )/2\u3009 in the thermallike noise spectrum involves only recombination events of hot electrons with hot holes and cold electrons with cold holes. This is accounted for by a factor \u03b312\u3008(n\u0302e1(n\u0302h2 \u2212 n\u0302h1 ) + (n\u0302e1 \u2212 n\u0302e2)n\u0302h2 )/2\u3009 in the delta-T noise spectrum, which depends on the excess amount of cold and hot holes \u3008n\u0302h2 \u2212 n\u0302h1 \u3009 and the excess number of hot and cold electrons \u3008n\u0302e1 \u2212 n\u0302e2\u3009. Another example is the noise contribution \u03b311\u3008n\u0302e1n\u0302h1 \u3009, which has the counterpart \u03b311\u3008(n\u0302e1n\u0302h1 + n\u0302e2n\u0302h2 )/2\u3009 in the thermallike noise spectrum. The delta-T contribution assumes the form \u03b311\u3008(n\u0302e1n\u0302h1\u2212 n\u0302e2n\u0302h2 )/2\u3009 and depends on the difference between hot and cold recombination events.\nWe distinguish between these two cases and split the delta-T noise spectrum into\nS\u2206T (\u03c9) :=S\u2206T1 (\u03c9) + S \u2206T 2 (\u03c9)\n= \u222b dE \u2211 \u03b16=\u03b2\u2208{1,2} \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9)F\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9)\n+ \u222b dE (\u03b311(E,\u03c9)\u2212 \u03b322(E,\u03c9))F (E,\u03c9)\n(15)\nwith functions\n\u2206f\u03b1\u03b2(E) =f\u03b1(E)\u2212 f\u03b2(E)\nF\u03b1\u03b2(E,\u03c9) = f\u03b1(E)\u2206f\u03b1\u03b2(E + ~\u03c9) + \u2206f\u03b1\u03b2(E)fh\u03b2 (E + ~\u03c9)\n2\nF (E,\u03c9) = f1(E)f\nh 1 (E + ~\u03c9)\u2212 f2(E)fh2 (E + ~\u03c9)\n2 .\n(16)\nThe unitary property of the scattering matrix guarantees the symmetry TrA12A \u2020 12 = TrA21A \u2020 21. Moreover, F12(E,\u03c9) + F21(E,\u03c9) reduces to \u2206f12(E)\u2206f12(E + ~\u03c9) and the first contribution is given by\nS\u2206T1 (\u03c9) = \u222b dE \u03b312(E,\u03c9)\u2206f12(E)\u2206f12(E + ~\u03c9). (17)\nThis contribution stems from recombinations of electrons and holes with different temperatures, e.g., hot electrons with cold holes. It depends only on the excess number of electrons \u3008n\u0302e1 \u2212 n\u0302e2\u3009 and holes \u3008n\u0302h2 \u2212 n\u0302h1 \u3009. In the lowest order, the difference \u2206f12(E) is linear in \u2206T and therefore the whole term is quadratic. The thermallike noise spectrum (12) includes recombination events of hot electrons with hot holes with a rate \u03b322. In contrast to the spectrum (4), where this rate is associated with cold electrons recombining with cold holes. A similar situation arises for the rate \u03b311, where the thermallike spectrum contains cold recombination events and the actual spectrum contains hot recombination events. These cases are covered by the second contribution S\u2206T2 (\u03c9). This contribution does not depend on the difference between the Fermi functions but rather on the difference between the number of hot and cold recombination events \u3008n\u0302e1n\u0302h1 \u2212 n\u0302e2n\u0302h2 \u3009. An expansion in \u2206T results in a linear dependence at the lowest order. For the part that depends on the scattering matrix, we find\nTr [ A11A \u2020 11 \u2212A22A\u202022 ] =2 Re Tr [ s22(E)s \u2020 22(E + ~\u03c9)\n+ s21(E)s \u2020 21(E + ~\u03c9) \u2212 s11(E)s\u202011(E + ~\u03c9)\n\u2212 s12(E)s\u202012(E + ~\u03c9) ] , (18)\nwith Re denoting the real part. At zero frequency, this expression disappears because of the unitary property of the scattering matrix. The entire spectrum S\u2206T2 (\u03c9) vanishes in two ways: first, when the scattering properties from both sides are indistinguishable, i.e., s11(E) = s22(E), s12(E) = s21(E), or second, the reservoirs assume the same temperature. At zero frequency, the delta-T noise decreases to\nS\u2206T = 2e2\n\u03c0~ \u222b dE \u2211 n Dn(E)[1\u2212Dn(E)][\u2206f12(E)]2\n(19) and matches with the definition given in [25]."

From the well-\n6 known equilibrium spectrum [1, 8], we obtain\nSth(\u03c9) = G~\u03c9 [ 2 + coth ( ~\u03c9\n2kBTh\n) + coth ( ~\u03c9\n2kBTc\n)] .\n(20) The thermal spectra STh(\u03c9), STc(\u03c9) are not additive, i.e., STh(\u03c9) + STc(\u03c9) cannot be written as a thermal noise spectrum with adjusted temperature. A consequence of this is that at a fixed average temperature T\u0303 = (Th + Tc)/2, the thermallike spectrum still changes for different temperature differences \u2206T = Th \u2212 Tc. Nevertheless, for convenience, the average temperature and the temperature difference are used hereafter.\nThe difference between the absorption and emission spectrum obeys Sth(\u03c9) \u2212 Sth(\u2212\u03c9) = 4G~\u03c9, \u03c9 > 0. It is sufficient to investigate the emission spectrum since emission and absorption differ only by the zero-point fluctuations. Figure 2(a) depicts the thermallike spectrum for various \u2206T . The curves vary continuously from \u2206T = 0 to the maximum \u2206T = 2T\u0303 , where the curve for \u2206T = 0 sets a lower bound and for \u2206T = 2T\u0303 an upper bound.\nThe examination of the delta-T noise spectrum reveals that S\u2206T2 (\u03c9) vanishes for energy-independent scattering, and the delta-T component reduces considerably to\nS\u2206T (\u03c9) = 2GF \u222b dE\u2206f12(E)\u2206f12(E + ~\u03c9), (21)\nwhere F = \u2211 nDn(1\u2212Dn)/ \u2211 nDn represents the Fano factor. The Fano factor indicates for the property of a partition noise and is a shared property with the shot noise at zero frequency [1]. If the barrier is completely transparent or reflective, Dn = 1 or Dn = 0, \u2200n , then the Fano factor vanishes and so does the delta-T noise spectrum, although a temperature difference might be present. The system consists then of isolated hot and cold electron transport, each in thermal equilibrium, which is why we call the term thermallike. At the maximal temperature difference \u2206T = 2T\u0303 , it is given as\nS2T\u0303 (\u03c9)\nGF =8kBT\u0303 ln\n[ 2 cosh ( ~\u03c9\n4kBT\u0303 )] \u2212 |~\u03c9| \u2212 ~\u03c9 coth ( ~\u03c9\n4kBT\u0303\n) . (22)\nIn the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0, we get back the factor 2 ln 2 as in [17]. The delta-T emission and absorption spectrum for different \u2206T is shown in Fig. 2(b). The delta-T noise spectrum starts at a maximum, then decreases and intersects the \u03c9-axis at a certain point. After that, the course reaches a minimum and converges back to zero. Above a certain point, the delta-T noise spectrum is negative and decreases the thermallike noise.

The thermallike spectrum depends on the temperature difference \u2206T and all curves lie between the extreme points \u2206T = 0 and \u2206T = 2T\u0303 in the grey area. The delta-T noise changes its sign from positive to negative at a certain frequency (compare to Fig. 3), which depends on the temperature difference. The curves are not enveloped by the extreme points. The overall noise Sth + S\u2206T \u2265 0 does not change its sign.\nfractional quantum Hall bar [19]. The decrease in fluctuations is there attributed to interactions and related to the tunneling of quasiparticles. In our case, interactions are not considered by the model. The combination of temperature broadening of the Fermi function and the frequency shift between distributions of the occupied and free states plays the crucial role here. A comparison between the cold and hot distribution shows (see for an example Fig. 3(b)), that the hot reservoir has fewer occupied states for E < 0, more for E > 0 and coincides for E = 0. This leads to a negative sign of f1(E)\u2212f2(E) for E < 0 and a positive sign for E > 0.

The thermallike spectrum was identified as the average thermal noise spectrum (STh(\u03c9) + STc(\u03c9))/2 and, consequently, the delta-T noise spectrum as the excess spectrum. We further decomposed the delta-T noise spectrum into two contributions, one depending on the frequency-shifted differences of Fermi functions and the other on the difference of the combined Fermi functions. In the case of energy-independent scattering, only the first contribution survived, and the spectrum was proportional to the Fano factor. We have discovered a partially negative delta-T noise spectrum that is positive at low frequencies and becomes negative above a certain frequency. A similar behavior, but with a suppressed negative part, was obtained for a resonant level with the selected parameters. In addition, the second component occurred for an asymmetric resonance."
