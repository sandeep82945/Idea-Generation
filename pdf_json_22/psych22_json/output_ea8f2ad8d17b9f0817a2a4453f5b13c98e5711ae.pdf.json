While previous research has suggested associations between sleep and positive mental health, few studies have been conducted in Canadian children.\nMethods: This study used data from the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth. Parents of children aged 5 to 11 years (N\u00a0=\u00a016\u00a0170) reported on their children\u2019s sleep habits and mental health. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate means and percentages for sleep and mental health indicators. Logistic regression was used to compare mental health outcomes by meeting sleep duration recommendations (9\u201311 hours of sleep vs. <\u00a09 or >\u00a011 hours of sleep), sleep quality (difficulties getting to sleep) and having enforced rules for bedtime.\nResults: Overall, 86.2% of children aged 5 to 11 years met sleep duration recommendations (9\u201311 hours of sleep), 90.0% had high sleep quality and 83.1% had enforced rules for bedtime. While 83.0% of children had high general mental health, mental health diagnoses were reported for 9.5% of children, and 15.8% of children required or received mental health care. High sleep quality was consistently associated with better mental health, enforced rules for bedtime were associated with some negative mental health outcomes and meeting sleep duration recommendations tended not to be associated with mental health outcomes.\nConclusion: Sleep quality was strongly associated with mental health among children in this study. Future research should explore longitudinal associations between sleep and mental health in Canadian children.\nKeywords: sleep, sleeplessness, mental health, anxiety, depression, child functioning, Canadian children"

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for sleep, including sleeping an uninterrupted 9 to 11 hours per night for children aged 5 to 13 years, with consistent bed- and wakeup times.2 Based on data from 2014\u20132015,\n467 Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada Research, Policy and PracticeVol 42, No 11/12, November/December 2022\nreduced cognitive development.7-12 Enforcement of proper sleep hygiene in the form of consistent bedtime routines is associated with longer sleep duration and better sleep quality.13\nMental health difficulties are also a concern among children, with first onset of lifetime mental disorders typically occurring in childhood or adolescence.14 One study found that 20% of Ontario children have parent- or teacher-reported symptoms of mental disorder.15 An emerging body of evidence demonstrates associations between insufficient sleep duration, poor sleep quality and negative mental health outcomes (i.e. mental disorders and psychosocial difficulties) across childhood. Longitudinal studies have found that children with disturbed sleep have increased odds of depression compared to those without disturbed sleep.16 Shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality during childhood have been associated with greater internalizing symptoms (i.e. anxiety and depression) and inattention and/or hyperactivity both cross-sectionally17,18 and into adulthood.19 The associations between a child\u2019s sleep and mental health may be bidirectional, with some evidence of negative mental health outcomes predicting poor sleep.20-22 Overall, sleep can have substantial implications for children\u2019s short- and long-term mental health and development.\nThe absence of mental disorders does not imply complete mental health.23,24 Complete mental health comprises both the absence of mental disorders and the presence of well-being or positive mental health.23 Well-being is modifiable, even in the presence of mental disorders.24,25 Several studies have examined associations between children\u2019s sleep and positive mental health outcomes.26-28 Both longer sleep duration and fewer sleep disturbances have been cross-sectionally associated with higher psychosocial well-being in children.26 While meeting sleep duration recommendations has not been associated with fewer psychosocial difficulties in Canadian children, in Canadian youth, meeting sleep duration recommendations has been associated with higher life satisfaction, fewer emotional problems, higher self-rated mental health and higher prosocial behaviour.27\nTo our knowledge, no studies to date have examined associations between other\nsleep indicators (e.g. sleep quality and sleep hygiene) and positive or negative mental health in Canadian children. This research is needed to provide a more nuanced view of how sleep and children\u2019s mental health are intertwined, and to inform the development of targeted strategies for improving sleep and mental health outcomes in Canadian children.\nThe aim of this study is to examine the associations between three sleep indicators (meeting sleep duration recommendations, sleep quality and rules around bedtime) and indices of positive and negative mental health in a sample of Canadian children aged 5 to 11 years. This study also provides pre COVID-19 pandemic estimates on various sleep and mental health indicators among a sample of Canadian children."

It covered a sample of children and youth aged 1 to 17 years living in every province and territory in Canada, but excluded those living on First Nations reserves and other Indigenous settlements, those living in foster homes and the institutionalized population. The sampling frame comprised beneficiaries of the Canada child benefit, which covers 98% of the Canadian population aged 1 to 17 years in all provinces and 96% in all territories. Data collection occurred between February and August 2019. Data for children aged 1 to 11 years were collected by electronic questionnaires or telephone interviews, with the \u201cperson-most-knowledgeable\u201d as the respondent. The personmost-knowledgeable was most often a parent of the child (98%).\nThis study focussed on children aged 5 to 11 years. Although nighttime sleep data were also collected for children aged 3 to 4 years, they were excluded from analyses because of high variability in responses (large coefficients of variation) and small sample sizes for this age range. Additionally, the Canadian sleep recommendations for this age range include naps, which were not assessed in the 2019 CHSCY.29\nThe overall response rate for children aged 5 to 11 years in the 2019 CHSCY was 57.8%. Statistics Canada generated sampling weights for each respondent based on the probability of selection, including an adjustment factor to attempt to account for nonresponse. Further details on the calculation of sampling weights are provided elsewhere.30 There were 20 113 respondents on behalf of children aged 5 to 11 years; 16 170 (80.4%) respondents had complete sociodemographic and sleep data, and were included in this study. Approval for the conduct of CHSCY was obtained from Health Canada\u2019s Research Ethics Board, and informed consent and assent were obtained from all participants."

Sensitivity analyses were conducted comparing mental health outcomes between children who were above sleep duration recommendations with those who met recommendations, and children who were below sleep duration recommendations with those who met recommendations. Separate logistic regression analyses were also conducted using sleep quality and rules around bedtime as predictor variables.\nBoth unadjusted analyses and analyses with adjustment for potential confounders (age of child [in years], sex of child, household income quintile, racialized group status, immigrant status and selfreported mental health of the personmost-knowledgeable) were conducted.

Mood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnoses were reported for 9.5% of children, with attention disorders being most common (7.6%) followed by anxiety (3.2%) and mood disorders (0.6%), and 15.8% of children required or received mental health care in the past 12 months. High general mental health was more common\nin females (85.3%) than males (80.8%). Psychosocial difficulties, mood/anxiety/ attention disorder diagnoses, and requiring or receiving mental health care in the past year were more common in males than females. The sex difference for mood/anxiety/attention disorders was largely driven by a relatively high proportion of males having been diagnosed with attention disorders (10.8% vs. 4.2% for females).\nAssociations between mental health outcomes and meeting, exceeding or being below sleep duration recommendations are presented as odds ratios in Table 2. Children who met recommendations were less likely to have difficulty concentrating, accepting change and controlling behaviour, but not after covariates were controlled for. Meeting sleep duration recommendations was not associated with any other mental health outcomes overall. However, females who met recommendations were more likely to have high general mental health than females who did not meet recommendations, and males who met recommendations were less likely to have difficulty concentrating than males who did not meet recommendations in adjusted analyses (although interaction terms between sex and meeting sleep duration recommendations were not statistically significant for these outcomes). There were no other associations when stratified by sex. In sensitivity analyses, not getting enough sleep tended to be more highly associated with poorer mental health than getting too much sleep.\nAssociations between mental health outcomes and sleep quality are presented in Table 3. Children with high sleep quality were more likely to have high general mental health, low anxiousness and low sadness, and less likely to have psychosocial difficulties, to have a mood/anxiety/ attention disorder diagnosis and to have required or received mental health care in the past year both overall (unadjusted and adjusted for covariates) and when stratified by sex.\nAssociations between mental health outcomes and enforced rules around bedtime are presented in Table 4. Children with enforced rules around bedtime were more likely to have a mood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnosis, require or receive mental health care, have high anxiousness,\nand have difficulty accepting changes in routine and controlling their behaviour both overall (unadjusted and adjusted for covariates) and when stratified by sex. Having enforced rules around bedtime was associated with difficulty making friends overall, but not when stratified by sex. Having enforced rules around bedtime was not associated with general mental health, sadness, or difficulty concentrating overall or when stratified by sex.\nWhen certain mental health outcomes (low anxiousness, low sadness, and psychosocial difficulties) were defined using the Washington Group/UNICEF Module on Child Functioning classification, associations with sleep quality were in the same direction but of a larger magnitude than the primary results (data not shown due to high sampling variability). Associations with meeting sleep duration recommendations and enforced rules around bedtime were similar to the primary results."

Overall, high sleep quality was consistently associated with better mental health, enforcement of bedtime rules was associated with some negative mental health outcomes, and meeting sleep duration recommendations tended to not be associated with mental health outcomes. Although males generally had lower mental health than females, sex tended to not moderate the association between sleep and mental health in this study (except for high sleep quality\u2019s negative association with some psychosocial difficulties and mood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnoses being stronger for males than females).\nThe Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth: An Integration of Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour, and Sleep recommend that children aged 5 to 13 years obtain 9 to 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night for optimal health benefits, with consistent bed and wake times.2 Most previous studies, but not all, have found associations between longer sleep duration and better emotional regulation (e.g. less stress and anxiety, and fewer depressive symptoms) in children.1 Meeting sleep duration recommendations was associated with higher life satisfaction,\n472Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada Research, Policy and Practice Vol 42, No 11/12, November/December 2022\nUnivariate models Adjusted models Sex comparison (significance\nlevel)a\nBoth sexes (N\u00a0=\u00a016\u00a0170) Both sexes (N\u00a0=\u00a016\u00a0170) Females (N\u00a0=\u00a07831) Males (N\u00a0=\u00a08339)\nOR 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper OR 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper OR 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper\nOR 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper\nMental health diagnoses and care\nMood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnosis\n0.64 0.47 0.86 0.97 0.71 1.32 1.03 0.55 1.91 0.93 0.66 1.32\nRequired/received mental health care in the past 12 months\n0.88 0.71 1.08 1.10 0.88 1.37 1.18 0.83 1.69 1.04 0.77 1.39\nBeing below vs. meeting sleep duration recommendations\nOverall mental health\nHigh general mental health (excellent or very good mental health) 0.44 0.33 0.58 0.63 0.45 0.90 0.39 0.23 0.65 0.95 0.58 1.56 **\nLow anxiousness (seems very anxious, nervous or worried less than weekly) 0.72 0.53 0.97 0.86 0.62 1.19 0.69 0.43 1.11 1.04 0.68 1.58\nLow sadness (seems very sad or depressed less than weekly) 0.67 0.44 1.02 0.82 0.53 1.23 0.66 0.39 1.11 0.99 0.49 2.01\nPsychosocial difficulties\nAt least some difficulty concentrating\n1.58 1.05 2.36 1.40 0.93 2.10 1.26 0.62 2.56 1.49 0.90 2.46\nAt least some difficulty accepting changes in routine 1.38 1.06 1.80 1.36 1.04 1.78 1.15 0.76 1.75 1.55 1.09 2.20\nAt least some difficulty controlling behaviour\n1.40 1.07 1.83 1.40 1.06 1.86 1.45 0.92 2.28 1.37 0.95 1.96\nAt least some difficulty making friends\n1.47 1.11 1.96 1.21 0.90 1.62 1.30 0.84 2.00 1.14 0.76 1.72\nMental health diagnoses and care\nMood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnosis\n2.43 1.74 3.41 1.58 1.13 2.21 1.57 0.89 2.77 1.58 1.02 2.43\nRequired/received mental health care in the past 12 months\n1.67 1.22 2.27 1.22 0.88 1.68 1.18 0.68 2.05 1.24 0.82 1.89\nAbbreviations: CHSCY, Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.\nNotes: Adjusted models for both sexes, females and males included age of child in years, racialized group status, immigrant status, household income quintile and person-most-knowledgeable self-rated mental health as covariates.

However, sensitivity analyses showed some associations between not getting enough sleep and poorer mental health. Mental health difficulties tend to manifest and be diagnosed later in childhood,15 and more Canadian children meet sleep duration recommendations than youth.27 Therefore, associations with sleep duration recommendations may be less apparent in the 5 to 11 years age group. Consistent with prior research,9,21,26 high sleep quality was associated with better mental health. Associations were strongest for mood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnosis and requiring/receiving mental health care. These were indicative of more severe mental health difficulties, while general mental health, anxiousness and sadness, and psychosocial difficulties grouped those with both severe and less\n473 Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada Research, Policy and PracticeVol 42, No 11/12, November/December 2022\nsevere difficulties. When psychosocial difficulties were defined using the Washington Group/UNICEF Module classification (i.e. focussing on severe difficulties), associations were of similar magnitude as those for mood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnosis and requiring/receiving mental health care. Notably, associations between sleep quality and outcomes grouping severe and less severe difficulties were still of large magnitude.\nResearch suggests that associations between sleep quality and children\u2019s positive and negative mental health outcomes may be bidirectional.20,21 Longitudinal studies, as opposed to cross-sectional studies, are needed to ascertain directionality. A systematic review found that most longitudinal studies supported a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and anxiety and depression, sleep quality and depression/anxiety and sleep quality and mental health status.46 However, studies looking specifically at children identified unidirectional relationships between sleep problems and depression/anxiety.46 The directionality between sleep quality and mental health may also depend on the mental health outcome being measured. Studies have found bidirectional relationships between childhood sleep problems and externalizing difficulties21 as well as behavioural difficulties.47 Although more longitudinal research is needed, current evidence suggests that both mental and sleep health promotion are important for optimal health and well-being. Sleep hygiene was assessed in this study by the enforcement of rules around bedtime. Consistent bedtimes are a commonly recommended practice to promote longer and better quality sleep in children.13,33 Having enforced rules for bedtime has been associated with longer sleep duration and higher sleep quality in American children,33 and with meeting sleep recommendations on weekdays in a study of 1622 Ontario parents and their children.34 Inconsistent sleep and wake times have been associated with emotional difficulties in Australian children.48 Inconsistent sleep times were also associated with\n474Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada Research, Policy and Practice Vol 42, No 11/12, November/December 2022\nbehavioural difficulties among children in the UK, and improvements in sleep time consistency were associated with behavioural improvements.49 While the promotion of consistent sleep could have mental health benefits, we found that having enforced rules around bedtime was associated with high anxiety, difficulty accepting changes in routine and controlling behaviour, mood/anxiety/attention disorder diagnosis, and requiring/receiving mental health care.\nThe manner in which rules for bedtime are enforced may inform their associations with negative mental health outcomes. For example, harsh parenting (e.g. enforcing rules through raising one\u2019s voice/scolding/yelling) and highly\ncontrolling parenting have been linked to negative mental health outcomes in children and adolescents, particularly among males.50-52 Meanwhile, authoritative parenting (enforcement of rules combined with parental warmth) has been linked to less negative outcomes.52 These associations may be bidirectional, as there is evidence that parents of children who are known to have mental health difficulties are more likely to enforce rules harshly relative to those without difficulties.51-53 Further research is needed in this area to best guide sleep hygiene recommendations."

            "text": "A major strength of the current study is the use of a survey that collected data on\nnumerous sleep and mental health indicators among children aged 5 to 11 years living in every province and territory in Canada. These estimates can be used as a baseline to compare sleep and mental health outcomes before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this study was also the first to assess the association between multiple sleep indicators (meeting sleep duration recommendations, sleep quality and enforced rules around bedtime) and mental health in this population. Multiple covariates were controlled for, including the personmost-knowledgeable\u2019s self-reported mental health.\nHowever, the cross-sectional study design prevents inferences on causality and the\n475 Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada Research, Policy and PracticeVol 42, No 11/12, November/December 2022\ndirectionality between sleep and mental health. The observed associations are likely a combination of the effects of sleep on mental health and mental health on sleep, as well as residual confounding of other factors related to both sleep and mental health (e.g. by physical activity, family structure, stress, trauma). Furthermore, sleep and mental health measures were reported by the person-mostknowledgeable, and may be prone to social desirability and recall biases as well as measurement error.54 While self-reported and parent-reported measures of child mental health are positively associated, the correlation is not perfect55 and initial analyses of the 2019 CHSCY suggest that discrepancies between youth and personmost-knowledgeable perceptions of youth general mental health are not uncommon.56 The assessment of mental health may be affected by sociodemographic characteristics that we did not account for (e.g. education).\nSleep quality can be assessed in multiple ways, including difficulties falling or staying asleep, sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to time in bed), time taken to fall asleep and the number and length of awakenings overnight.6 This study was only able to assess difficulties falling asleep, as reported by the person-mostknowledgeable. Similarly, sleep hygiene encompasses a variety of practices that promote sleep, including consistent bedtimes, daytime exercise and limiting screen time.57 This study only assessed the enforcement of rules around bedtime, which were associated with some negative mental health outcomes. Ascertaining the manner in which rules are enforced (e.g. harshly or warmly) may provide more context to the observed associations. Assessing additional sleep quality measures and sleep hygiene practices in future studies would better inform the relationship between sleep and mental health.\nDespite the large sample size, there were few children who were diagnosed with a mood, anxiety or attention disorder, and few children who required or received services from a psychologist, counsellor or psychiatrist, or for mental health issues or difficulty focussing or controlling behaviour. Diagnosed mood disorder in particular had a low prevalence of 0.6%. Therefore, these variables were grouped together and results should not be interpreted as being applicable to a specific mental health disorder or service.\nAssessing these variables individually could provide more information about associations between sleep and specific mental health disorders and services.\nFurthermore, a large majority of children met sleep duration recommendations and had high sleep quality and enforced rules around bedtime, high mental health and low psychosocial difficulties. Oversampling children with mental health difficulties in subsequent surveys and studying longitudinal associations between childhood sleep and mental health at later ages (e.g. adolescence) may provide more insight into the relationship between sleep and mental health.\nFinally, the majority of mental health outcomes we examined were negative outcomes. Future research should target additional positive mental health outcomes (e.g. life satisfaction).25"

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "In this sample of Canadian children aged 5 to 11 years, high sleep quality was strongly and consistently associated with better mental health outcomes. In contrast, the enforcement of bedtime rules was modestly associated with some negative mental health outcomes, and meeting sleep duration recommendations tended not to be associated with the examined mental health outcomes. These findings suggest that poor sleep quality may be associated with severe and less severe mental health difficulties during childhood. Given their potentially bidirectional relationship, as documented in other literature, this highlights the importance of promoting both good sleep health and mental health in children. Future research should explore longitudinal associations between sleep and mental health in this population."
