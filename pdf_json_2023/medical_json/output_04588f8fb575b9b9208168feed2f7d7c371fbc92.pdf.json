The current conventional anti-inflammatory drugs have many undesirable health effects and are in need of newer drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous methanol crude extract of Premna schimperi leaves. Methods: Premna schimperi leaf was extracted with 80% methanol and concentrated; the concentrated extract was used to evaluate the acute toxicity and anti-inflammatory effects. For the acute toxicity study, a single dose of Premna schimperi extract at a dose of 2000 mg/kg was administered and observed for 14 days. Acute, sub-acute, and chronic anti-inflammatory models were employed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the extract compared to the standard drug. Data were analyzed with SPSS V. 27, and the significance was established with a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Tukey\u2019s test. Results: Acute oral toxicity testing at a dose of 2000 mg/kg did not show any sign of toxicity. According to the phytochemical study, the plants contained flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins, cardiac glycosides, steroids, phenolics, and anthraquinones. The extract doses of 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg of extracts effectively (p<0.001) reduced paw edema in the acute and sub-acute models of inflammation. When compared to the negative control group, all tested doses in the chronic model significantly (p<0.05) decreased the production of exudates and the amount of granuloma tissue. Conclusion: Premna schimperi displayed significant anti-inflammatory activity. The tested doses inhibit the formation of edema, granulomas, and exudates.

They are considered the major clinical, social, and economic problems in most communities around the world.3\nMore than half of all deaths are now thought to be caused by chronic inflammatory disorders, which are now regarded as the leading cause of death worldwide.4\nAround the world, NSAID prescriptions for various inflammatory diseases total up to 100 million per year. Today\u2019s NSAIDs and corticosteroids have side effects that limit their therapeutic use, including gastro esophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, osteoporosis, iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and cardiovascular adverse effects.5,6\nJournal of Experimental Pharmacology 2023:15 437\u2013447 437 \u00a9 2023 Arega et al.

Increased NSAID doses, especially ibuprofen, diclofenac, and piroxicam, increase the risk of bleeding. Along with the gastroduodenal mucosal injury, NSAIDs have the potential to harm the distal portions of the small and large intestines. Additionally, NSAID medications may raise the chance of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage and perforation.7,8 Despite the availability of adequate medications, inflammation and pain continues to be one of the most difficult and devastating health problems, impacting 80% of the adult population worldwide.3\nVarious plants are traditionally used in Ethiopia to cure conditions that involve pain, such as headaches, stomachaches, inflammation, and wounds.9,10 One plant from the genus Premna that has been utilized for a variety of therapeutic purposes in Ethiopia is Premna schimperi. Studies on its leaf extracts\u2019 anti-leishmanial, anti-plasmodial, and antimicrobial properties have been conducted.11,12 In folkloric medicines, it has been used to treat inflammatory issues, but to date, no further research has been recorded to validate this folkloric usage against inflammation, and no scientific investigations have been done to support this traditional claim for treatment of different inflammatory disorder.13\u201316 The current study aims to evaluate Premna schimperi leaf crude 80% methanol extract\u2019s anti-inflammatory activity."

G-power analysis was used to determine the sample size (n = 6).\nCollection and Approval of Plant Materials Premna schimperi Engl (Lamiaceae) leaves were collected in January 2023 from Yabelo Woreda in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. Mr Melaku Wondafrash (Botanist) authenticated the plant material at Addis Ababa University\u2019s College of Natural Sciences and Addis Ababa National Herbarium with voucher number MA-001.\nPreparation of Crude Extracts The plant\u2019s crude extract was extracted using an 80% methanol solvent (1:5 w/v) by macerating it at room temperature for 72 hours while occasionally shaking it to ensure that all of the soluble material had dissolved. The mixture was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The process described above was used to extract the marc twice more consecutively, for a total of nine days.17,18\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JEP.S432615 DovePress Journal of Experimental Pharmacology 2023:15 438\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nAfter thorough filtration, the methanol solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 40\u00b0C under decreased pressure to produce an 80% methanol extract. After evaporation, the raw extract was dried in a 40\u00b0C oven. Until they were needed, the dried extract products were stored in tight containers in a deep freezer.18\nStudy Animals A total of 110 Wistar albino rats weighing 200\u2013300 g and 8\u201312 weeks old of either sex were used during the experiment.19,20 The animals were raised and supplied by the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. Rats were housed in plastic cages. Rodent pellets made up the rats\u2019 diet, and they had unrestricted access to water. 22 \u00b1 2\u00b0C temperature and 50\u201360% relative humidity were maintained. There were 12 hours of artificial light and 12 hours of complete darkness. The OECD\u2019s 2008 and Arrive recommendations were followed when handling and caring for the animals. The week before the trial, the animals were acclimated.21,22\nExperimental Units Rats were randomly divided into five groups of six rats, consisting of three test groups, one positive control group, and one negative control group, which were drawn from the sample size determined using G-power analysis.\nGrouping and Dosing of Animals Five groups of six rats each were allocated at random from the total number of rats. The fifth group of randomly chosen rats serves as the negative control and is given Tween 80 (10 mL/kg). The first, second, and third groups received 200mg/ kg, 400mg/kg, and 800mg/kg of 80% methanol crude extracts, respectively. The fourth group received indomethacin 10mg/kg as the positive control group. All of the therapies were administered orally by oral gavage. The animal was given thiopental sodium (25mg/kg) to alleviate its pain. Rats were sacrificed via cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment.12,23\nAcute Oral Toxicity Test Based on the limit test requirements of OECD/OCDE Guideline 425, an acute oral toxicity test was conducted.21 Prior to giving a dose of the extract containing 2000 mg/kg to single, nulliparous, and non-gestational female rats, they were fasted for four hours. Following the administration of the extracts, food was limited for an additional 4 hours. Following that, the rat was kept under close observation for the next 24 hours, with a particular focus on the first four hours, for a total of 14 days. Before giving the extract in a single dose of 2000mg/kg to the remaining four female rats, they were starved for four hours. They underwent the same inspection as the previous rats. The following 14 days were spent observing the rats for any signs of toxicity. Changes in somatomotor activity, behavioral patterns, and the respiratory, circulatory, autonomic, and central nervous systems were among the factors that were observed.21\nCarrageenan-Induced Paw Edema The reduction of carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema served as the foundation for measuring the anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. Before being employed in the tests, rats were fasted for 12 hours while having unlimited access to water. Five groups of both sexes of rats, each with six rats, were employed in this experiment. The right hind paw was painted with ink at the level of the lateral malleolus. To ensure it could always be immersed to the same depth in the measuring chamber of the plethysmometer.23\nThe extracts were administered to each study group one hour before formalin injection on the 1st and 3rd days and administered for 7 consecutive days once daily. Carrageenan in 0.1 mL of 1% sodium chloride solution was injected into the right hind paw\u2019s plantar side. The paw volume was measured using a plethysmometer at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours after inducing inflammation by carrageenan, and the basal volume was taken before inducing inflammation. A different dose of the extract and tween 80, as well as Indomethacin 10mg/kg, were administered 1 hour prior to the injection of carrageenan.23\nJournal of Experimental Pharmacology 2023:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/JEP.S432615 DovePress\n439\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nThe percentage inhibition of inflammation was calculated as follows:\n\u25cf Vt and Vc are the mean edema volumes in the treated and control groups, respectively.\nFormalin-Induced Paw Edema With freshly prepared 0.1 mL of 2% v/v formalin in distilled water, hind paw edema was induced. With the exception of the dosing, basal paw volume measurement, and therapy, these are similar to carrageenan-induced rats\u2019 paw edema. Formalin was injected into the right hind paw of overnight fasted rats by sub-plantar injection on the first and third days of observation.3 The extract, the reference medication, and the vehicle were each given according to their groupings one hour prior to the measurement of paw edema for seven consecutive days.3,23\nOn the first, third, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh days of therapy, the paw volume was measured. Daily measurements of the rat paw volume were taken using a plethysmometer after one hour of drug administration; however, on day one, the measurement was conducted three hours after formalin injection.23,24\n\u25cf The percent inhibition was calculated as: % of edema inhibition \u00bc 1 VtCc \ufffd \ufffd\n\ufffd100 \u25cf Vt and Vc are the mean edema volumes in the treated and control groups, respectively.\nCotton Pellet-Induced Granuloma Method The cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats was evaluated as specified by Afsar et al and Belay and Makonnen. The rats were given free access to water but fasted for the previous night prior to receiving the vehicles, medicines, and test substances. The rats were put into five groups of six animals each at random. Animals in group IV receive 10mg/kg of indomethacin, whereas those in group V receive Tween 80. Groups I, II, and III received doses of 80% methanol crude extract of 400mg/kg, 800mg/kg, and 200mg/kg, respectively.23,25\nThe rats were given thiopental sodium (25mg/kg, i.p.) 20 minutes after administering the standard drug, the vehicle, and the extracts. A subcutaneous tunnel was then created aseptically in each rat\u2019s previously shaved groin using a surgical blade and blunted forceps. The subcutaneous tunnel was subsequently implanted bilaterally with two sterilized cotton pellets weighing 10 mg each, and the tunnel was closed with non-absorbable silk rounded bodes (0/4 rounded, 1/2 Circle).23\nA standard drug, a vehicle, and the 80% methanol crude extract were given for seven days. On the eighth day, the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the cotton pellets were carefully taken out and thoroughly cleaned of extraneous tissues. In order to attain a constant dry weight, the pellets were dried in an incubator for 24 hours at 60\u00b0C before being weighed again.23,25,26\nTo determine the weight of the wet exudate, the constant dry weight of the pellet was subtracted from the immediate wet weight of the pellet. Granuloma tissue formation was measured by subtracting the weight of a cotton pellet (10 mg) from the constant dry weight of the pellet.23 According to Afsar et al, Belay, and Makonnen, the percentage inhibitions of exudate and granuloma tissue formation were calculated.23,25\nPreliminary Phytochemical Screening The phytochemical screening revealed that the 80% methanol crude extract included a variety of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, phenols, cardiac glycosides, tannins, alkaloids, and anthraquinones.23,27,28\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JEP.S432615 DovePress Journal of Experimental Pharmacology 2023:15 440\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nStatistical Analysis Data was entered and analyzed with the IBM statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). The data were tabulated and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard errors of the mean (SEM) (n = 6). The statistical analysis was carried out using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey post-hoc test. The result was considered significant when p <0.05.29"

As a result, the oral LD50 exceeds 2 g/kg. The experimental rat\u2019s physical and behavioral evaluations revealed no apparent acute poisoning symptoms, such as loss of appetite, tremors, hair erection, salivation, or diarrhea.\nPhytochemical Screening The preliminary phytochemical screening showed that different secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, phenolics, cardiac glycosides, tannins, alkaloids, and anthraquinones were available in the 80% methanol crude extract.\nAnti-Inflammatory Activity on Carrageenan-Induced Paw Edema The 80% methanol crude extracts significantly (p< 0.05) reduced paw edema at all tested doses, beginning with the first hour of edema measurements, in contrast to the negative controls. When evaluated by linear regression, it was discovered that the effect at the fifth hour increased in a dose-dependent way (R2 = 0.955). At the fifth hour after edema induction, the dose of 800mg/kg extract significantly differed from the dose of 400mg/kg (p <0.05), but it did not differ significantly from the doses of 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg at the first and second hours of edema measurement (Table 1 and Figure 1).\nAnti-Inflammatory Activity on Formalin-Induced Paw Edema In comparison to the negative control group, all tested extract doses significantly inhibited paw edema, commencing on day 1 of treatment (p <0.001) and continuing through day 7 (p <0.001). The anti-inflammatory effect on the sixth day of treatment grew in a dose-dependent way, according to linear regression analysis (R2 = 0.949). 800 mg/kg of 80% methanol crude extracts and 10 mg/kg of indomethacin effectively (p <0.001) decreased paw edema from day 1 to day 7 of therapy when compared to the negative control group (Table 2 and Figure 2).\nNotes: The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n=6) and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test; ACompared to Tw80; Bcompared to Indo10; CCompared to PS200; DCompared to PS400; Ecompared to PS800; aP<0.05, bP<0.01, cP<0.001.

            "text": "Premna schimperi leaves have long been used in Ethiopia as an anti-inflammatory drug.14\u201316 In experimental models of inflammation, there is no proof of this plant\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties. The current study looked at the antiinflammatory properties of Premna Schimperi leaf extract in order to support its traditional claims. Rats were given 80% methanol crude extracts at doses of 2000mg/kg. Following the 2008 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, no signs of acute toxicity were observed in the rats. An injection of carrageenan causes localized inflammation that develops in two stages: the first stage, which begins 0 to 2.5 hours after the injection and is characterized by a high expression of histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin, and the second phase, which begins at a later time.20 The second phase, which starts 2.5 to 5 hours after the injection of carrageenan, is brought on by the overproduction of COX-2 and its pro-inflammatory PGs products as well as the invasion of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutrophils).30\nIn line with the studies mentioned, the second phase of carrageenan-induced paw edema, which is primarily dictated by COX2 and its pro-inflammatory PGs, is inhibited to a greater extent by the 80% methanol crude extracts of this plant.23,31,32\nThe extract\u2019s inhibitory effect on mediators like histamine and serotonin may account for the anti-inflammatory effects of the extracts shown within the first two hours of inflammation caused by carrageenan. After the third hour of inflammation induction, the paw edema significantly decreased, suggesting that the extracts may have an effect on the cyclooxygenase enzyme and its pro-inflammatory mediators (PGs). The largest anti-inflammatory impact was observed on the fifth hour relative to their respective inhibitory values in the first phase (0\u20132.5 hours), and all tested extract doses significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed edema on all measurement hours of the inflammation.\nInjection of formalin causes biphasic localized pain and inflammation in the hind paw of rats. Pain is assumed to start during the initial neurogenic phase (0\u20135 minutes) by the direct chemical stimulation of nociceptors, and substance-P and bradykinin are proposed as its mediators.33 Histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin, and bradykinin appear to be the main mediators of the second phase (15 minutes after induction), which is an inflammatory phase that can be reduced by anti-\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JEP.S432615 DovePress Journal of Experimental Pharmacology 2023:15 442\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nTable 2 Anti-Inflammatory Activity of 80% Methanol Crude Extracts of Premna Schimperi on Formalin-Induced Rat Paw Edema\nGroups Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7\nM \u00b1 SEM %A M \u00b1 SEM %A M \u00b1 SEM %A M \u00b1 SEM %A M \u00b1 SEM %A M \u00b1 SEM %A M \u00b1 SEM %A\nTw80 1.73\u00b10.06 \u2013 2.03\u00b10.04 \u2013 2.07\u00b10.04 \u2013 2.17\u00b10.05 \u2013 2.2\u00b10.04 \u2013 2.15\u00b10.02 \u2013 1.76\u00b10.02 \u2013 Indo10 1.21\u00b10.03AcCcDc 29.90 1.26\u00b10.05AcCbDb 37.78 1.16\u00b10.03AcCcDbEa 43.96 1.31\u00b10.03AcCcDc 39.63 1.28\u00b10.03AcCcDcEa 41.82 1.17\u00b10.08AcCbDa 45.58 1.11\u00b10.03AcCaDb 36.93 PS200 1.44\u00b10.04Ac 16.50 1.54\u00b10.04Ab 23.95 1.54\u00b10.04 25.60 1.54\u00b10.03Ab 29.03 1.51\u00b10.04Aa 31.36 1.41\u00b10.02Ac 34.42 1.21\u00b10.04Ab 31.25 PS400 1.4\u00b10.02AcCb 16.52 1.45\u00b10.08AcCa 28.39 1.45\u00b10.02AcBb 29.85 1.5\u00b10.02AcCc 30.87 1.47\u00b10.02AcCa 33.09 1.36\u00b10.02AcCa 36.74 1.17\u00b10.02Ac 33.52 PS800 1.27\u00b10.04AcCbDa 26.38 1.35\u00b10.01AcCb 33.58 1.25\u00b10.01AcCaDa 39.86 1.4\u00b10.01AcCa 35.48 1.38\u00b10.09AbCbDa 37.27 1.24\u00b10.0AcCbDb 42.19 1.08\u00b10.09AcCbDaBa 38.92\nNotes: The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n=6) and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test; ACompared to Tw80; BCompared to Indo10; CCompared to PS200; DCompared to PS400; ECompared to PS800; aP<0.05, bP<0.01, cP<0.001.

The most conspicuous activity in this inflammatory response is leukocyte migration into the inflamed area, which starts late in this period (2.5\u20136 hours).34\nIn comparison to the negative control group, the 80% methanol crude extracts at dosages of 200, 400, and 800mg/kg showed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) suppression of paw edema from day 1 to day 7 of therapy, as shown in Table 2. Both 10mg/kg of indomethacin and 800mg/kg of 80% methanol crude extracts had comparable antiinflammatory effects. This may be caused by specific changes in the inflammatory response, which may have antiarthritic effects on par with those of the commonly used medication indomethacin.\nThis work used this model to further validate the anti-inflammatory effects of 80% methanol crude extracts on proliferative and transudative aspects of chronic inflammation.23,35,36 According to these findings, every dose examined in the cotton pellet-generated granuloma model showed a statistically significant (p< 0.001) decrease of both inflammatory exudates and granuloma formation when compared to the negative control groups.\nSecondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids possess anti-inflammatory activities due to their ability to reduce COX expression and PGE2 generation. Those metabolites limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1, Interleukin-6, and Tumor necrosis factor), as well as intracellular adhesion molecule and\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JEP.S432615 DovePress Journal of Experimental Pharmacology 2023:15 444\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nvascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression.37\u201339 According to this study, Premna schimperi\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties may be indicated by the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in its 80% methanol crude extracts.\nMethanol, which can extract a variety of polar and non-polar phytochemical components from medicinal plants, was specially chosen for this study\u2019s extraction solvent because of its wide polarity range and ability to provide high extraction yields.40\u201342 It is also thought that methanol can successfully permeate cell membranes, allowing for the extraction of significant amounts of endocellular components. Additionally, due to its relative safety, methanol is frequently employed in the herbal medicine industry to make crude extracts of phytochemicals for therapeutic purposes.19,43\nIn addition to the current study, more investigation on the anti-inflammatory properties of Premna schimperi is required, including the identification and purification of the active ingredients responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect, clarification of the mechanism of action of the active ingredients, identification of inflammatory biomarkers through histopathological analysis, and assessment of the plant\u2019s long-term safety profile. To offer a comprehensive profile of the substance that was screened from this plant for medicinal use, more pharmacological and toxicological research should be conducted."

The extracts decrease the development of granulomas caused by cotton pellets and paw edema brought on by formalin. The claimed anti-inflammatory activity may have been aided by the presence of different secondary metabolites. Therefore, it is suggested that the active ingredient in Premna schimperi be extracted for more study."
