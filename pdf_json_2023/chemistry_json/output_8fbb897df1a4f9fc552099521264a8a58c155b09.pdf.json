    "abstractText": "An organoboron small-molecular acceptor (OSMA) MB\u2190N containing a boron\u2013nitrogen coordination bond (B\u2190N) exhibits good light absorption in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, based on MB\u2190N, OSMA MB-N, with the incorporation of a boron\u2013nitrogen covalent bond (B-N), was designed. We have systematically investigated the charge-transport properties and interfacial chargetransfer characteristics of MB-N, along with MB\u2190N, using the density functional theory (DFT) and the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Theoretical calculations show that MB-N can simultaneously boost the open-circuit voltage (from 0.78 V to 0.85 V) and the short-circuit current due to its high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the reduced energy gap. Moreover, its large dipole shortens stacking and greatly enhances electron mobility by up to 5.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121. Notably, the excellent interfacial properties of PTB7-Th/MB-N, owing to more charge transfer states generated through the direct excitation process and the intermolecular electric field mechanism, are expected to improve OSCs performance. Together with the excellent properties of MB-N, we demonstrate a new OSMA and develop a new organoboron building block with B-N units. The computations also shed light on the structure\u2013property relationships and provide in-depth theoretical guidance for the application of organoboron photovoltaic materials.",

Over the past few years, the emerging strategy of the incorporation of boron-nitrogen (BN) units into organic structures has been widely applied in optoelectronic devices, attracting great attention due to their interesting electronic and optical properties [4,5]. In 2011, Nakamura et al. synthesized a series of BN-fused polycyclic aromatic compounds with high mobility, especially 4b-aza-12b-boradibenzo[g,p]chrysene, which predicted that BN-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons were potential candidates for organic electronic materials [6]. In 2013, Pei and Wang et al. reported two novel tetrathienonaphthalene derivatives incorporating a BN unit, namely BN-TTN-C3 and BN-TTN-C6, signifying that a boron nitride fused ring had been applied to organic electronic devices for the first time [7]. Later, they developed and studied many BN-embedded compounds with excellent properties which could be applied to organic semiconductor materials in the field of electronics [7\u20139]. In 2015, Liu et al. reported the first BN-based acceptor applied in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) through replacement of a C-C bond by a boron\u2013nitrogen\nMolecules 2023, 28, 811. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28020811 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 811 2 of 15\ncoordination bond (B\u2190N) [10], which sparked great research interest in the chemistry of organoboron acceptors. In 2022, Liu et al. reported an organoboron compound (SBN-1) based on N-B\u2190N units with a balanced resonance hybrid of boron\u2013nitrogen covalent bond (B-N) and B\u2190N, which can be used as an effective building block to construct small band gap conjugated polymers for OSCs [11]. Organoboron provides a new idea to design optoelectronic materials [12\u201322]. However, the development of n-type organoboron small-molecular acceptors (OSMAs) with advantages of facile synthesis, synthetic versatility, and simplified purification lags far behind that of their polymer counterparts [23,24]. Therefore, it is necessary to further increase the research on OSMAs. The BN unit is one of effective building structures for the construction of OSMAs, which contain two kinds of chemical bonds between B and N, a boron\u2013nitrogen coordination bond, B\u2190N, and a boron\u2013nitrogen covalent bond, B-N. The former has been widely applied to construct non-fullerene acceptors and has achieved great success. The typical representative form is M-BNBP4P-1, which exhibits superior sunlight harvesting capability because of its unique wide absorption spectrum, with two strong bands in the long-wavelength region (771 nm) and the short-wavelength region (502 nm) [25,26]. Besides, Piers et al. devoted their efforts to synthesizing a series of novel cores with BN units for use in optoelectronic devices [27,28]. Nevertheless, the latter is rarely used in OSCs. Recently, Duan et al. developed a novel OSMA called BNTT2F, which was the first reported B-N covalent bond-based electron acceptor for OSCs, achieving the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) among OSMAs [29]. At this stage, there are not many computational studies regarding OSMAs at the atomistic level, especially concerning their homojunction interfacial charge-transport characteristics and heterojunction interfacial charge-transfer properties [25]. Inspired by the remarkable characteristics of M-BNBP4P-1 (called MB\u2190N in this work) and the fact that the core of the acceptor could effectively regulate its performance, we introduced the B-N bonds into the core group to design a B-N-containing OSMA MB-N and studied whether the derivative containing B-N bond would prove to be an excellent OSMA. The structures of B\u2190N-based OSMA MB\u2190N, the B-N-containing compound (MB-N), and their carbon-counterpart (MC-N) are shown in Figure 1; density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were used to systematically investigate their electronic, optical, and interfacial properties, particularly their charge-transport properties and charge-transfer characteristics. Our results show that the B-N-embedded compound MB-N is regarded as an excellent OSMA, which is expected to improve open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF) originated from the upshifted frontier molecular orbitals, as well as to exhibit superior charge-transport properties with enhanced electron mobility up to 5.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, outstanding optical absorption, and sterling interfacial chargetransfer characteristics.

As shown in Figure 2a, MB\u2190N and MB-N possess relatively higher-lying HOMO levels than that of MC-N, indicating less energy loss (Eloss) in the boron-containing acceptors. Moreover, the empty 2p orbital of the boron atom adopts sp2 hybridization in the tri-coordination B-N compounds and sp3 hybridization in the tetra-coordination B\u2190N molecules [15,33]. Therefore, the p-\u03c0* conjugation with the \u03c0 system of MB-N due to the empty 2p orbital of the boron atom upshifts the LUMO energy level (\u22123.85 eV) in comparison with MB\u2190N (\u22123.92 eV) and then increases \u2206EDA [33\u201335], which equates to a higher VOC in OSCs devices. According to the formula evaluated, VOC (eVOC = \u2206EDA\u2212Eloss) and the experiment value of MB\u2190N (0.78 V), the Eloss is estimated as 0.52 eV. Therefore, MB-N yields a high VOC of 0.85 V, which is enhanced by about 9% compared to the reference acceptor. The energy gap is related to the planarity of the geometry, and organoboron compounds shows a smaller dihedral angle off the plane. In comparison with MC-N, the energy gaps of organoboron compounds greatly decrease because of the substantially upshifted HOMOs; thus, improved absorptions are expected [36]. In terms of MB-N, on one hand, its relatively high-lying LUMO levels can result in high VOC due to increased \u2206EDA; on the other hand, high JSC may be realized because of the reduced energy gaps with upshifted HOMOs compared to those of MC-N [37]. The orbital delocalization index (ODI) can quantitatively investigate the degree of orbital delocalization. The smaller the value, the higher the degree of orbit delocalization. As displayed in Figure 2b, the ODI values of the LUMOs are smaller than those of the HOMOs, indicating that the studied molecules have good electron transport properties.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 15"

As displayed in Figure 2b, the ODI values of the LUMOs are smaller than those of the HOMOs, indicating that the studied molecules have good electron transport properties.\nMolecular orbital correlation (MOC) analysis has been proven to be an effective method for analyzing the contribution of each molecular orbital fragment to the entire molecular orbital and further exploring the intramolecular orbital interactions [38\u201340]. To study the influence of different forms of boron and nitrogen substitution on the distribution\nMolecules 2023, 28, 811 4 of 15\nand energy of frontier molecular orbitals, we carried out MOC analysis on these molecules. The studied molecules can be divided into central cores and electron-withdrawing units on both sides. The results (Figure 2c) show that the contributions of the LUMO of the studied molecules are mainly from the electron-withdrawing groups, and the contributions of the HOMO are mainly from the central cores, which explains why the LUMO energy levels of these molecules show little change, but the HOMO exhibits a large shift. Compared with MC-N, the introduction of B atoms into the system increases the contribution of the HOMO of the central cores to the whole molecular HOMO, and slightly reduces the contribution of the LUMO of the electron-withdrawing group to the overall LUMO. As an important photovoltaic parameter, the absorbance of materials in OSCs equals the power input, which significantly determines the performance of OSCs [41]. Thus the optical characteristics of molecules are widely impacted [42,43]. As depicted in Figure 2d, the maximum absorption wavelengths of MB\u2190N, MB-N, and MC-N are calculated as 696 nm, 654 nm, and 527 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra of the organoboron acceptors MB\u2190N and MB-N are red-shifted relative to that of their carbon-counterpart as a result of the reduced energy gaps mentioned previously. MC-N exhibits the strongest absorption at 527 nm, which loses the energy of the long-wavelength region, thus hindering the increase in JSC. MB\u2190N presents two peaks in the UV-Vis region, which is consistent with previously reported experimental results [25]. Similar to MB\u2190N, there are two unique peaks from 400 nm to 800 nm in MB-N. Different from MB\u2190N, MB-N exhibits stronger absorption at the long wavelength of about 650 nm, while the strongest peak of MB\u2190N is located at 450 nm. In terms of absorption spectra, MB\u2190N and MB-N are expected to be excellent acceptors because they meet the absorption demands of long wavelengths [44,45]. Particularly, MB-N not only exhibits a wide absorption range covering the entire visible region and extending to the nearinfrared region with two unique absorption peaks in the visible region, but also presents relatively high absorption intensity, which is expected to improve JSC [46]."

            "text": "Electron mobility (\u00b5e) is the most important property for acceptors in OSCs, which reflects the electron transport behavior [47\u201349]. In this work, the semi-classical Marcus electron-transfer theory, combined with the Einstein relation (Table S1), was employed to assess \u00b5e based on the crystal structures predicted by the polymorph module in Materials Studio [50]. According to the Marcus theory, the one factor affecting the rate is reorganization energy (\u03bb): a large \u03bb value will lead to a decrease in mobility, subsequently, to poor electron transport [51,52]. As summarized in Figure 3a, introductions of the boron atoms increase \u03bb values (0.16 eV for MB\u2190N and 0.26 eV for MB-N). The larger \u03bb values in organoboron compounds compared with those in MC-N (0.13 eV) indicate larger energy barriers during the electron transfer process [53]. We have to admit that the introductions of boron atoms are disadvantageous in terms of \u03bb. The other factor is the electron transfer integral v (see Table S1), which reflects the electronic coupling between two neighboring molecules and depends on the relative orientations of adjacent molecules. As shown in Figure 3d, the MC-N molecular stacking includes face-to-face hopping pathways with long distances and edge-to-edge hopping pathways, resulting in relatively small v values. Meanwhile, all hopping pathways in MB\u2190N are face-to-edge stacking, but with a small dipole of 0.61 Debye, giving rise to moderate v values. The large dipole of the B-N unit is expected to shorten the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and construct good molecular packing for the transport charge [54\u201356]. Owing to the large dipole of 3.51 Debye in MB-N due to B-N substitution, the stacking exhibits a compact face-to-face \u03c0-stacking pattern, leading to large v values and thus, excellent charge transporting properties. As described in the Einstein formula, the maximum electron transfer integral (vmax) plays an important role in \u00b5e, which is attributed to its large weight in the investigated pathways. It can be seen from Figure 3b that vmax values of molecules MB\u2190N and MB-N are one order of magnitude larger than those of MC-N, with a vmax of 3.68 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV. MB-N has the largest vmax of 5.36 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV, which is about four times that of MB\u2190N (1.23 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV, Figure 3a). Interestingly, despite\nMolecules 2023, 28, 811 5 of 15\na larger \u03bb, MB-N possesses as high as \u00b5e of 5.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 (Figure 3c), which is one order of magnitude larger than that of MC-N (1.03 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121), as a result of its excellent vmax. In addition, MB\u2190N delivers a large \u00b5e of 2.43 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, also thanks to its large vmax. In conclusion, although the large \u03bb values of MB\u2190N and MB-N are disadvantageous factors, the significant enhancements of vmax values help to achieve high \u00b5e values, especially for B-N-containing MB-N with the largest \u00b5e, which are conducive to charge transport and thus, are expected to improve the JSC and FF parameters of the devices. The results show that \u00b5e of organoboron compounds are mainly determined by the vmax in this work. Although the active layer is amorphous, the small range of the ordered domains of the non-fullerene acceptor is the key to the charge transport characteristics [57]. Here, the information and calculation results are of significance and of reference value.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15\ntransport charge [54-56].

In addition, MB\u2190N delivers a large \u03bce of 2.43 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, also thanks to its large vmax.

            "text": "In OSCs, the excitons photogenerated within the donor or acceptor components dissociate at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces, which significantly control the photocurrent and thus affect the PCE of the devices [58\u201361]. To gain a deeper insight into the interfacial optical properties of the organoboron acceptors, the interfaces between the donor PTB7-Th and the investigated organoboron molecules, namely PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N and PTB7-Th/MB-N, were constructed, and the excited-state properties of the D/A interfaces were assessed. These excited states can be divided into three classes, namely, charge-transfer (CT) state, local-excitation (LE) state, and hybrid charge-transfer (HCT) state. Among these, the CT state between the donor and the acceptor at the D/A interface is a paramount intermediate state to realize charge separation [58,62,63], which is characterized by the fact that the two singly occupied molecular orbitals separately locate on the donor and the acceptor. There are generally three mechanisms agreed upon by scientists to form the CT state, namely, the direct excitation mechanism, the intermolecular electric field (IEF) mechanism, and the hot exciton (HE) mechanism [62,64,65]. The LE state refers to an electron excitation localized on the donor or the acceptor, with high transition probability, but which is difficult to separate. The HCT state is another important state which possesses a high exciton utilization, resulting from the CT state, and a large oscillator strength, originating from\nMolecules 2023, 28, 811 6 of 15\nthe LE component; it effectively becomes the CT state in the subsequent process, but only given the relevant mechanisms. Given that the lower excited states are essential in photo-physical and photochemical processes [66], Figure 4 provides the crucial parameters for the three lowest excited states (S1\u2013S3), including the transition density matrix (TDM), the charge difference density (CDD) map, the net transferred charges (\u2206q), D index, and the oscillator strength (f ), which are widely used to evaluate the features of excited states. Among these, the TDM and CDD maps are usually used to visually study the spatial span and primary sites of electron transitions. A large TDM value in the off-diagonal term denotes that a strong electron-hole coherence presents between the donor and the acceptor, which corresponds to the CT state, while a large value in the diagonal region indicates a strong charge coherence within the donor or acceptor, which represents the LE component. Parameter \u2206q can quantitatively express electrons transferring from the donor to the acceptor [67]. The degree of charge separation can be represented by the D index, which is defined as the distance from the hole centroid to the electron centroid [68]. Parameter f indicates the transition probability; an excited state with a high f value means strong absorption. The direct excitation process is a paramount mechanism to generate a CT state, that is, charge carriers of D/A interface are directly excited into the CT state manifolds upon illumination [66]. According to Figure 4a, the TDM of the first excited state (S1) shows that the photoexcitation of PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N is mainly distributed on the off-diagonal part. In addition, as shown in the CDD map (Figure 4b), the electron distributes on the MB\u2190N, and the hole distributes on the PTB7-Th; therefore, the S1 of PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N is the CT1 state. However, the S1 of PTB7-Th/MB-N is regarded as the HCT1 state, since the photoexcitation of interface PTB7-Th/MB-N distributes not only in the off-diagonal region, but also in the diagonal part. It can be proven by the CDD map, in which the hole only locates in PTB7-Th, and the electron and hole locate in MB-N. Note that, in the studied distributions of the second excited state (S2), two interfaces are reserved to their S1 states, according to the TDM and CDD maps; thus, the S2 states are HCT1 in the PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N interface and CT1 in the PTB7-Th/MB-N interface. PTB7Th/MB\u2190N and PTB7-Th/MB-N exhibit similar transition characteristics in the third excited states (S3), and S3 are CT2 states in both of the two interfaces. For CT1 and CT2, the \u2206q of PTB7-Th/MB-N are larger than those of PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N. MB-N transfers more charge to PTB7-Th compared to MB\u2190N, reflecting stronger charge-separation ability. The calculated D indexes (Figure 4c) follow the order of PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N (2.37 \u00c5) < PTB7-Th/MB-N (3.14 \u00c5) for the CT1 states and PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N (2.58 \u00c5) < PTB7-Th/MB-N (2.81 \u00c5) for the CT2 states. The larger \u2206q and D index of PTB7-Th/MB-N lead to stronger CT characteristics, which are favorable to the charge separation. In the case of HCT1, PTB7-Th/MB-N has the strongest light-harvesting ability, with an f of 1.17, which is about 1.5 times larger than that of PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N. Our results show that the organoboron MB-N has excellent charge-transfer characteristics of direct excitation into the CT state manifold. In addition to the interfacial direct excitation mechanism discussed above, the intermolecular electric field (IEF) mechanism is one of the main ways, which separate exciton by producing more CT states [62,69,70]. Two key factors determine the realization of the IEF mechanism, namely energy difference and molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) [71]. The low energy state, with a small energy difference, can generate the CT state through the IEF mechanism driven by the difference in molecular ESP between the donor and the acceptor [72]. The energy difference and average ESP values of these molecules were calculated and summarized in Figure 5. The smaller energy difference of 0.05 eV between the HCT and CT state in PTB7-Th/MB-N can be easier to overcome in comparison with PTB7-Th/MB\u2190N, thus promoting interfacial exciton dissociation. In addition, compared to the value of 3.08 kcal/mol in MB\u2190N, the average ESP values of MB-N are enhanced to 3.28 kcal/mol.

It is well known that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) eigen-\nvalues are relatively sensitiv to the fraction of the artree\u2013Fock exchange in the exchange-\ncorrelation functional; seven functionals (MPWLYP1M, TPSSH, B3PW91, MPW1B95, PBE38,\nand M06-2X) with a broad range of Hartree\u2013Fock exchange ratios (from 5% to 54%) were used to calc late the HOMO of MB\u2190N to obtain more accurate HOMO eigenvalues (Figure S1). Note that the computed HOMO energy l vel using th B3PW91 functional (\u22125.31 eV) as in v ry good agre ment with th experimental value (\u22125.34 eV) [25]; thus,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 811 8 of 15\nfunctional B3PW91 was chosen to calculate HOMOs in this work. Considering that the virtual orbitals are generally more difficult to describe theoretically than the occupied orbitals, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) eigenvalues were obtained by adding the corrected HOMO energies to the TD-DFT HOMO-LUMO gap (E1), namely ELUMO = EHOMO + E1 [78]. The molecular packings of the acceptors were obtained from the crystal structure prediction at the DREIDING force field [79], which was considered to be a more appropriate force field for molecular crystal prediction [80]. Crystal structure predictions of the studied molecules were performed by using the polymorph predictor module in Materials Studio [50]. Electrostatic potential charges of all atoms were obtained by the DMol3 module, and the crystal structure prediction was then carried out by employing the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) [81] exchange-correlation energy functional. Finally, we sorted the obtained crystal structures in terms of their total energies and selected crystal structures with the lowest energies for further DFT calculations regarding their electron mobilities. The M06-2X functional is a high nonlocality functional with a double amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), which provides a good description of the non-covalent interaction [82,83]. Thus, the M06-2X functional was employed to calculate the transfer integrals of all hopping pathways based on the direct coupling approach. To obtain a reliable method, the maximum absorption wavelength of MB\u2190N was calculated by functionals B3LYP, PBE33, PBE38, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and wB97XD (Figure S2). The maximum absorption wavelength (696 nm) obtained by PBE38 is in good agreement with the experimental result of 698 nm [25]. Therefore, the excited-state properties of the investigated compounds were characterized at the TD-PBE38/6-31G (d, p) level. The empirical D3 dispersion corrections were included using the Becke\u2212Johnson damping potential in DFT and TD-DFT calculations [84,85]. The polarizable continuum model was employed in the single molecules to consider the solvation effect in chlorobenzene [86]. The above calculations were performed with the Gaussian 16 code [87]. The large overlap between the donor and the acceptor enhances the interface interactions, thus reducing the overall energy [88]. Therefore, the donor PTB7-Th was stacked face-to-face, stacking MB\u2190N and MB-N, respectively, at a distance of 3.5 \u00c5 to form the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces, which has been proven to obtain essential results [62,89,90]. Then, these D/A interfaces containing a donor/acceptor pair were simulated by molecular dynamics (Figure S3). The equilibrated simulation time was set to 10 ns, with an integration time of 1 fs, using a universal force field [91], which is suitable for organic molecules [92]. The NVE ensemble was performed at 298K using the Forcite module of the Materials Studio software [50]. After reaching equilibrium, the D/A interfacial configuration containing a donor/acceptor pair remained relatively stable, and the lowest energy configurations obtained by equilibrated dynamic simulations were fully optimized at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G (d, p) level with the Gaussian 16 code. Given the slight effect of side chains on the electronic properties, the long alky chains were substituted by the methyl groups in the subsequent computations in order to balance the time and accuracy. The analysis of optical properties was performed using the Multiwfn software [93]."

In comparison with the carbon-counterpart MC-N, the introduction of boron strongly lowers the optical gaps and concurrently, dramatically enhances electron mobility due to the unique characteristics originating from the presence of a vacant p orbital on the B atom. The results show that boron atoms are necessary, and that the MB-N containing a boron\u2013nitrogen covalent bond outperforms the MB\u2190N comprising the boron\u2013nitrogen coordination bond due to increased VOC (enhanced by about 9% compared to the MB\u2190N) as the result of its high-lying LUMO, and its enhanced JSC and FF because of excellent absorption and significantly increased electron mobility of up to 5.91\u00d710\u22123 cm2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121.
