1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the phytochemicals in Myrtus communis L. (MC) to identify the functional groups or structural features responsible for their anti-ChE activity.** This could be done by synthesizing and testing a series of analogs of the most active phytochemicals, and then analyzing the data to identify the key structural features that contribute to their activity.


2. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the most promising phytochemicals from MC in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).** This could be done by administering the phytochemicals to animals with AD-like symptoms and then assessing their effects on cognitive function, neuropathology, and other relevant endpoints.


3. **Investigate the potential synergistic effects of combining different phytochemicals from MC or other plants with known anti-ChE activity.** This could be done by testing different combinations of phytochemicals in vitro and in vivo to see if they have a greater effect than the individual compounds alone.


4. **Explore the use of nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of phytochemicals from MC to the brain.** This could be done by encapsulating the phytochemicals in nanoparticles or other delivery systems that can cross the blood-brain barrier and target the brain more effectively.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of phytochemicals from MC in humans with AD.** This would be the ultimate goal of the research, and would involve recruiting human participants with AD and administering them the phytochemicals to see if they improve cognitive function or other symptoms of the disease.
