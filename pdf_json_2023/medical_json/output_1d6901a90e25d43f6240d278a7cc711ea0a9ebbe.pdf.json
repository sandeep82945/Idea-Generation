    "abstractText": "Reactive sulfane sulfur (RSS), including persulfide, polysulfide, and elemental sulfur (S8), has important physiological functions, such as resisting antibiotics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli and regulating secondary metabolites production in Streptomyces spp. However, at excessive levels it is toxic. Streptomyces cells may use known enzymes to remove extra sulfane sulfur, and an unknown regulator is involved in the regulation of these enzymes. AdpA is a multi-functional transcriptional regulator universally present in Streptomyces spp. Herein, we report that AdpA was essential for Streptomyces coelicolor survival when facing external RSS stress. AdpA deletion also resulted in intracellular RSS accumulation. Thioredoxins and thioredoxin reductases were responsible for anti-RSS stress via reducing RSS to gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S). AdpA directly activated the expression of these enzymes at the presence of excess RSS. Since AdpA and thioredoxin systems are widely present in Streptomyces, this finding unveiled a new mechanism of anti-RSS stress by",

            "text": "The physiological functions of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) have been studied for about two decades and was initiated by the discovery of endogenously generated H2S in mammalian tissue [1]. Currently, the conception that H2S is the third \u201cgasotransmitter\u201d has been widely accepted because it is involved in numerous physiology and biological processes [2\u20136]. H2S acts as a signaling molecule mainly via two mechanisms. One involves the interaction and modification of the cysteine residues (persulfidation) of some target hemoproteins or proteins by H2S [7,8]. Concerning the other mechanism, numerous studies indicate that the direct effector is zero-valent sulfur (S0), the oxidation product of H2S. Inside cells, S0 exists in many forms, including persulfide (HSSH and RSSH) and polysulfide (HSnH and RSnH, n > 2) [9\u201311], which are collectively named as reactive sulfane sulfur (RSS). The endogenously produced RSS has many beneficial functions, such as quenching the strong destructive effect of hydroxyl radical on lipid peroxidation [12,13], contributing to the de novo biosynthesis of cysteine [14], and antagonizing electrophilic stress caused by heavy metal ions [15,16], but it has harmful effects at high intracellular concentrations. The octasulfur (S8) has been used as a common bactericide and fungicide for many years [17,18]. A recent study indicated that S8 depletes glutathione (GSH) and causes disulfide stress in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [19]. Consequently, cells need to maintain intracellular RSS homeostasis. Persulfide dioxygenase (PDO) plays an important role to remove excess RSS in most microorganisms [20,21]. It oxidizes RSS to sulfite (SO32\u2212) using oxygen (O2) as a co-substrate. It is unclear whether there is other mechanism(s) involved in antagonizing RSS stress. Streptomyces spp. are filamentous Gram-positive bacteria colonizing a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic niches [22\u201325]. AdpA is a transcriptional regulator that is universally\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 312. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12020312 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 312 2 of 12\npresent in Streptomyces spp. [26\u201328]. It is a key regulator of both secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation [29\u201332]. We previously demonstrated that AdpA senses intracellular RSS via the persulfidation of its Cys residues and affects actinorhodin production and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces coelicolor [33]. Herein, we report that AdpA was indispensable for maintaining intracellular RSS homeostasis. It activated expression of thioredoxins, thereby reducing excess RSS to H2S that may evaporate into the gas phase or be consumed by other microorganisms living in the same habitat. This finding expands the function spectrum of the versatile regulator AdpA."

            "text": "Living organisms are always exposed to different environmental stresses and have developed specialized strategy to cope with them. Several transcription factors dealing with RSS stress have been identified. They sense intra- and extracellular RSS and maintain the intracellular RSS homeostasis. For instance, CstR negatively regulates the transcription\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 312 8 of 12\nof H2S oxidation genes in Staphylococcus aureus [48]. SqrR is responsible for the regulation of 45% sulfide-responsive genes in Rhodobacter capsulatus [49]. FisR transcriptionally activates the expression of H2S oxidation genes in Cupriavidus pinatubonensis [50] and Acinetobacter baumannii [51]. In addition to these RSS specific sensors, a few global or multifunctional regulators also have RSS sensing functions, such as MgrA in Staphylococcus aureus [52], MexR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [53], OxyR in Escherichia coli [54], and AdpA in S. coelicolor [33]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RSS can release the self-inhibition of AdpA expression via modifying its Cys62 residue, thereby affecting secondary metabolites production and morphological differentiation [33]. In this study, we demonstrated that AdpA is also responsible for maintaining intracellular RSS homeostasis. Deleting adpA makes S. coelicolor more sensitive to exogenous RSS stresses, suggesting that AdpA can activate expression of trx genes, whose products (thioredoxins) can reduce RSS to H2S, which evaporates into the gas phaseto relieve the RSS stress (Figure 7). AdpA is global transcriptional regulator widely present in Streptomyces spp. AdpA binds to more than hundreds of operator regions, and these sequences are less conserved. The crystal structure of the AdpA-DBD-DNA complex and mutation analysis of AdpA-DBD revealed its unique DNA recognition mode, with only two arginine residues directly recognizing the conserved site, explaining its strict recognition of G and C at position 2 and 4, respectively, as well as its tolerance recognition to other positions in the consensus sequence [55]. Although AdpA has been reported to regulate many important physiological processes [56\u201359], this study is the first report of its role in the maintenance of intracellular RSS homeostasis. Our finding revealed a new role that AdpA may commonly play in Streptomyces spp. Antioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13\nFigure 7. The proposed model of AdpA regulates the removal of excess intracellular RSS via thioredoxin systems in Streptomyces coelicolor.\nWe previously demonstrated that the H2O2-response regulator OxyR senses intracellular RSS and activates the expression of catalase (KatG), glutaredoxin A (GrxA), and thioredoxin C (TrxC) in E. coli. These enzymes remove excess RSS via either oxidation or reduction [54]. AdpA also senses RSS and activates thioredoxins expression. These studies suggest that thioredoxins, conserved in many bacteria, constitute a general mechanism used by bacteria to maintain intracellular RSS homeostasis. However, it is noteworthy that during the late period of cultivation, the intracellular RSS content of \u0394adpA sharply decreased (Figure 2). This phenomenon suggests that AdpA might not be the only regulator controlling thioredoxins expression or that the removel of RSS is due to other factors other than thioredoxins. Further studies are thus required to elucidate the cause of this abrupt decrease of the RSS content in the \u0394adpA mutant. Notably, actinorhodin (ACT) is highly correlated with oxidative response. ACT is a pH-responsive benzoisochromanequinone produced by a type II polyketide synthasebased pathway. Its quinone groups participate in the redox-cycling reactions. The reduced form may react with oxygen to produce superoxide anions, which in turn generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) [60]. This may be one of the reasons why ACT has bactericidal properties. The oxidized ACT can act as an oxidative biocatalyst to react with L-ascorbic acid and L-cysteine to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [61]. This observation is consistent with the view that ACT as a redox antibiotic to perform its sterilizing function. ACT biosynthesis can be triggered by common oxidative stress such as nitric oxide (NO), RSS, and ROS has been recently reported [35,62\u201365]. These results suggest that ACT is both an oxidant and an antioxidant. ACT can be used as an endogenous signaling molecule to induce the expression of the redox-sensitive regulator SoxR and its regulon in S. coelicolor [66,67]. SoxR directly regulates the thioredoxins to promote resistance of thioloxidative stress in Streptomyces avermitilis [68]. We speculate that SoxR is not the only regulatory factor involved in antioxidant defense and ACT biosynthesis. In this study, AdpA not only directly regulates antibiotic production, but also regulates the oxidative stress resistance of thioredoxins. Deletion of adpA resulted in low expression of thioredoxins and accumulation of oxidant RSS, and AdpA is essential for the production of antioxidant ACT, aggravating the stress sensitivity of the cells. It was further confirmed that antibiotic\nFigure 7.

            "text": "Sulfane\u2013sulfur compounds containing active sulfur atoms with a valence state of 0 or \u22121 are common components of cells. Sulfane sulfur is the inducer of numerous regulatory factors and participates in many physiological functions and metabolic pathways. Given the oxidizing and reducing properties of sulfane sulfur, it can be both oxidant and antioxidant. A high concentration of sulfane sulfur causes oxidative stress response and damages cells. Organisms develop different strategies to remove excess RSS in cells and maintain redox balance, but more studies are required to comprehensively understand the mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that the global regulator AdpA was critical for eliminating excessive RSS in S. coelicolor. The sensitivity of adpA deletion mutant to sulfur stress was significantly increased and the endogenous RSS accumulated in the mutant. Streptomyces has multiple pathways and enzymes to protect itself from oxidative stress, of which the thioredoxin systems are commonly involved. Overexpression of these thioredoxin systems resulted in more H2S release in S. coelicolor. The results showed that thioredoxin systems affected sulfur metabolism and reduced intracellular RSS. In addition, AdpA significantly activated the expression of thioredoxins and thioredoxin reductases to deal with sulfur stress. Overall, we found that AdpA has the regulatory function to promote sulfane sulfur reduction and maintain redox balance. This discovery further expands the pathway of antioxidant regulation in Streptomyces.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox12020312/s1, Table S1.
