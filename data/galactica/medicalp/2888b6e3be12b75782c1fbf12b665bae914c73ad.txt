conclusions Eight prokaryotically expressed recombinant proteins (rBsTPX, rBsGST, rBsFABP, rBsTLP, rBsHP2, rBsHP1, rBsGAL, and rBsUP) were used to immunize mice (50 μg/mouse) twice, which were then challenged with B. schroederi eggs. The results showed that the worm reduction rates induced by rBsHP2, rBsGAL, and rBsUP were 71.5%, 74.7%, and 76.5%, respectively. Moreover, the numbers and severity of liver and lung surface lesions were significantly decreased. The reduction of parasites and changes in liver and lung tissue lesions are related to a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response, as manifested by high levels of specific IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a and marked upregulation of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-5. The recombinant proteins rBsHP2, rBsGAL, and rBsUP might be potential candidate vaccines against B. schroederi infection.
