    "abstractText": "Objectives: The aim of this national population\u2010based, retrospective database study is to compare the comorbidity profiles of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and general population controls matched for age, gender, and region and assess the risk of depression or anxiety when controlled for age, gender and adjusted for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Methods: Claims data of 1051 patients diagnosed with SLE (full population between January 01, 2011, and Decem\u2010 ber 31, 2014) from the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund have been analyzed against matched controls (1:5 ratio) with a follow\u2010up of 30 months. The first record of SLE diagnosis was considered the diagnosis date. The odds ratio (OR) and 99.9% confidence interval (CI) of having depression or anxiety among patients with SLE vs. controls have been assessed using logistic regression models. Results: SLE patients report more comorbidities than the matched general population both in pre\u2010 and post\u2010index periods (mean CCI 1.79 vs. 1.15 and 2.78 vs. 1.22 [both p<0.001], respectively). Both SLE patients and controls diag\u2010 nosed with depression or anxiety had significantly higher CCI than those without comorbid depression or anxiety (p<0.001). However, SLE patients had a twofold higher risk of depression or anxiety than matched controls when controlled for age, gender, and adjusted for CCI. Conclusion: Our analysis indicates the enormity of comorbidity burden in SLE, especially that of anxiety and depres\u2010 sion. The size and complexity of the comorbidity burden emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and interven\u2010 tion with comprehensive modalities incorporating attention to comorbidities in SLE patients.",

The first record of SLE diagnosis was considered the diagnosis date. The odds ratio (OR) and 99.9% confidence interval (CI) of having depression or anxiety among patients with SLE vs. controls have been assessed using logistic regression models.\nResults: SLE patients report more comorbidities than the matched general population both in pre\u2011 and post\u2011index periods (mean CCI 1.79 vs. 1.15 and 2.78 vs. 1.22 [both p<0.001], respectively). Both SLE patients and controls diag\u2011 nosed with depression or anxiety had significantly higher CCI than those without comorbid depression or anxiety (p<0.001). However, SLE patients had a twofold higher risk of depression or anxiety than matched controls when controlled for age, gender, and adjusted for CCI.\nConclusion: Our analysis indicates the enormity of comorbidity burden in SLE, especially that of anxiety and depres\u2011 sion. The size and complexity of the comorbidity burden emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and interven\u2011 tion with comprehensive modalities incorporating attention to comorbidities in SLE patients.\nKeywords: Systemic lupus erythematosus, Hungary, comorbidities, Depression, Anxiety\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease associated with multiple clinical complications and comorbidities, which may lead to significant organ damage resulting in increased disease burden and mortality [1\u20133]. Both multi-organ involvement and treatment for SLE may lead to a higher risk of comorbidities [4]. The prevalence of SLE in Europe has been estimated to be 25\u201391 per 100,000 [5] while recent evidence reported the prevalence of SLE in Hungary to be 70.5 per 100,000 [1].\nThe European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommends prompt evaluation if comorbidities are suspected in a patient with SLE [6]. Commonly observed comorbidities in patients with SLE include cardiovascular diseases, infections, psychosis, depression, chronic pulmonary diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, neoplasms, and renal diseases [7\u20139]. Moreover, the incident risk of these comorbidities is greater in patients with SLE compared with the general population as reported by two population-based studies [7, 9].\nSLE along with any presenting comorbidities may lead to pain [10], increased work disability [11] as well as increased financial strain [12] resulting in a lower socioeconomic status. Moreover, the latter has also been associated with increased SLE severity and poor outcomes [13, 14], resulting in a vicious cycle. It is well documented that the aforementioned factors are associated with anxiety and depression in patients with SLE [10, 15]; additionally, anxiety and depression themselves might be neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE [16]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with SLE to be 35.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29.9\u201340.3%) and 25.8% (95% CI 19.2\u201332.9%) [17]. In addition, depression and anxiety are more common in patients with SLE compared to the general population [18].\nComorbid depression and anxiety are associated with low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and greater work disability and economic burden in patients with SLE [19\u201321]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the risk of these comorbidities in SLE to optimally manage the disease. However, there is limited evidence on the complex comorbidity profile of SLE. Hence, this current full populational, nationwide, retrospective study aims to compare the comorbidity profile of adult patients with SLE and controls matched for age, gender, and region and to assess if the risk of having depression and anxiety is\ndifferent when adjusted for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) in addition to controlling for age and gender."

Patients were followed up for at least 2 years after the index period (Fig.\u00a01B). A cohort of reference individuals from the same database without any diagnosis of SLE (control group) was created matching on age, gender, and geographical region in a 1:5 ratio. The members of this control population had their index periods defined to be exactly the same as the index period of that SLE patient to whom they were matched. Comorbidities in the prior and post periods are in relation to this derived index period for controls.\nBased on the average amount of prednisone-equivalent steroid dose prescribed in the 6-month index period, patients were classified into four categories (0 mg/day, \u22647.5 mg/day, \u226420 mg/day, and >20 mg/day)."

Specifically, a patient was identified as having depression in the pre- or postindex period if they had any of the F31*, F32*, or F33* ICD-10 codes reported in such a way in the pre- or postindex period respectively. In case of anxiety, the ICD-10 code F41* was used. Comorbidities are presented only if there were 10 or more patients for the protection of individual patient data. The age-adjusted CCI was calculated based on the presence of comorbidities, for each comorbidity in scope, the patients had a score ranging between 1 and 6 and these scores were added together. Additional scores were obtained based on age. Supplementary Table\nS3 contains the comorbidities and the associated scores for the calculation of CCI [23].\nThe primary objective is to describe the complex comorbidity profile among patients with SLE and compare them with the matched general population, and the secondary objective is to estimate the role of SLE on the risk of having depression and anxiety."

As we aimed for a family-wise error rate of 5%, the comparison-wise alpha was chosen to be 0.1% based on the Bonferroni correction. In the Adjusted Analysis, we applied the above model only for depression and anxiety, with the logistic regression model adjusted for the\nCCI as well as age and gender. Pre-index CCI is used in the adjustment, to enable the assessment of a cause-andeffect-type relationship. In administrative healthcare data the missing data cannot be discovered, if a diagnosis or intervention is not recorded then imputation is not possible. Therefore, missing data handling was not performed. We performed all the statistical tests using R software (R: A language and environment for statistical computing.

In addition to existing population-based studies assessing the comorbidities associated with SLE burden [24\u201333], this is the first nationwide full-populational database study in Europe with 1:5 randomly matched controls from the general population that focuses on comorbidities in SLE, especially depression and anxiety.\nThe prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety in patients with SLE in the administrative claims data analyzed in our study was 9.9% and 12.7%, respectively, which is lower than the self-reported or healthcare professional-reported prevalence found by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (depression - 35.0% [95% CI 29.9\u201340.3%]) and anxiety - 25.8% [95% CI 19.2\u201332.9%]) [17].

This comorbidity profile is comparable with published European data. A recent Finnish study analyzed data of patients with SLE and matched controls from 2000 to 2015 and reported comorbid cardiovascular diseases (33%), malignancies (27%), and neurological diseases (10%) present at diagnosis to be the leading\nFig. 4 Odds ratio of presenting depression/anxiety within 2 years post\u2011index\u2014SLE patients vs. matched population.

Matching is based on age, gender, and region. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus\ncauses of death [35]. A full population study in Crete also reported a high prevalence of comorbid thyroid disease (45.6%), mental disorders (42.1%), dyslipidemia (33.3%), and hypertension (24.6%) [34].\nIn our study, patients with SLE receiving a high steroid dose (>20 mg/day) had a greater risk of having anemia or renal disease compared with matched controls. It can mean that the severity of the disease was greater in these patients resulting in higher steroid use and therefore worse renal disease and anemia, but also that steroids may have been used to treat these. We found no difference in the risk of any of the other comorbidities among patients with different steroid doses. Although other studies have examined comorbidities as a function of steroid dose [36\u201339], the observed comorbidity profiles were not the same either due to assessment of specific comorbidities [36\u201338] or varying study population [39].\nComorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases [40], depression, and anxiety [19, 41], in patients with SLE, significantly impair HRQoL. The latter two are also involved with body image and fatigue severity, which further affect HRQoL [20]. Moreover, depression and anxiety can indicate increased inflammatory activity, associated with SLE flares [42, 43]. In our study, patients with SLE had a twofold higher chance of presenting the depression, anxiety, or both compared with matched controls in both the Base Case Analysis and the Adjusted Analysis, thus highlighting the burden of SLE. Inadequate control at an early stage may lead to further deterioration in physical, mental, and social functioning in these patients. Hence, optimization of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to alleviate depression or anxiety-related symptoms could positively impact HRQoL [41].\nInfections and cardiovascular diseases are reported to be the leading causes of death in SLE [44\u201346]. In the current study too, the presence of serious infections was sixfold greater in patients with SLE compared with matched controls after the diagnosis date. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that infections have a large effect in accelerated mortality in patients with SLE [1]. As skin-, urinary-, and lower respiratory tract-related infections are known to be common in patients with SLE [47, 48], early identification and adequate treatment of infectionrelated symptoms appear to be essential for reducing mortality in patients with SLE.\nIn line with recent European guidelines [49, 50] that recommend the use of biologics in the second or subsequent line for SLE treatment, majority of the patients in our study were on corticosteroids, with only 5.8% on biologics. However, treatment pattern analysis was hampered due to a lack of reliable information on use of medications during hospitalization in the claims dataset. Although we used a conservative approach to\nestimate the diagnosis date (e.g., two newly recorded SLE ICD codes + flare indicated by immediate treatment), we observed that 58% of the patients received some form of SLE relevant treatment via pharmacy prescriptions before the date of SLE diagnosis appeared in the dataset, indicating that a not differentiated autoimmune disease state may often precede the diagnosis.\nThe main advantage of this study is the full population analysis which enables obtaining deep insights into the burden of SLE. Limited evidence exists on the complete comorbidity profile in patients with SLE with an emphasis on depression and anxiety. This study bridges the knowledge gap by analyzing patients and matched controls in a 1:5 ratio to obtain insights.\nThere are some limitations of this study. The data were collected for health insurance reimbursement claims purposes and not for research. Data on the therapy used during hospitalization of patients with SLE (i.e., treatment with cyclophosphamide, other immunosuppressive therapies, or use of glucocorticoids) are unavailable. Hence, we cannot accurately determine the exact disease activity and severity and treatment patterns. No data was available on clinical details such as disease phenotype, disease severity, or patient-reported outcomes either. All comorbidities were identified through claims data; however, misdiagnosis might be possible. Some diagnoses may be present on prescriptions to enable the prescription of certain medications. This is especially true for depression and anxiety. Due to data handling regulations, we could not report patient-level data or aggregate data obtained from less than 10 patients (including patient numbers). This study utilizes claims data from Hungary, and findings may not be generalizable to other populations. When analyzing the effect of steroid dose on comorbidities, the amount of steroid prescribed may be influenced by comorbidities which were present pre-index which can cause confounding. this was not adjusted for in the analysis. Adjusting for the total CCI score in the final set of analyses may mask the influence of specific comorbidities.\nWe observed that most comorbidities have a higher risk of being present in patients with SLE than in matched controls. The greatest risk increase was observed in renal disease, anemia, and osteoporosis. We also observed that depression and anxiety have a higher risk of being present in patients with SLE after controlling for the presence of other comorbidities, suggesting that depression and anxiety, at least partly, are not caused by the higher comorbid nature of SLE patients. Overall, the enormity of comorbidities specifically depression and anxiety emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and intervention incorporating attention to comorbidities in SLE patients.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13075\u2011 022\u2011 02799\u20116.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Supplementary Table\u00a0S1: Treatments for systemic lupus erythematosus.
