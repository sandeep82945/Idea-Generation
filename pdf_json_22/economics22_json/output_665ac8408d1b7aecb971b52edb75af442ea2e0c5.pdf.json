INTRODUCTION\nA stroke is a cerebral vascular event that results in chronic dysfunction and mortality, which causes a heavy burden on the individual, family, and wider society. Understanding the functional impairments and mortality in the aftermath of stroke is, thus, pressing in providing better prevention and intervention and developing a better health care system for patients with stroke.\nDue to the long-lasting impacts of stroke on emotion and cognition, one\u2019s long-term health may be impacted, causing deterioration in their ADLs. Researchers have concluded that impaired cognition and sustained depression after the stroke had a lingering effect on ADLs at 15 months post stroke (Pohjasvaara et al., 2002). Moreover, the research found that the coexistence of stroke and depression increases the chance of mortality compared to those with each condition independently (Ellis et al., 2010), which in turn corroborates the impairment to longterm health caused by cognitive and emotional variations following stroke. A study in 2006 examined how predictor variables of cognitive impairment such as demographic data and lesion characteristics correlate with the stroke-specific life quality of patients using multiple logistic and linear regression (Nys et al., 2006). At the end of the study, patients with different baseline\ncognitive disorders showed different levels of reduction in Quality of Life (QOL) after 6 months. Considering cognitive disorders in executive functioning, visual perception/construction, visual memory, and unilateral (visual) neglect; the strongest impact on the patient\u2019s health post-stroke is an impairment in visual perception/construction. Similarly, the QOL of stroke survivors with pathological depression is lower than that of those with marginal or no depression. Univariate analysis of stroke survivors at 4 years was performed to evaluate the impact of different variables including hospital anxiety depression scale classifications (anxiety and depression) and cognitive deficits on the health-related quality of life of patients after stroke (Haacke et al., 2006). Despite these studies showing a negative association between both depression and cognitive impairments with health-related quality of patients with post-stroke, few of them examined cognition and emotion as predictors when controlling other confounding variables.\nMotor skill indicators (e.g., gross motor skills and largemuscle index) are also included in the model since they are testified to be important indices of one\u2019s post-stroke health (Mercier et al., 2001). Past research has shown that lesion in the parietal lobe is the primary mechanism for motor disorders among patients with stroke (Jaywant et al., 2020). Motor deficits due to stroke can have severe impacts on one\u2019s daily activities by generating functional disabilities and affecting rehabilitation potential. Hence, the inclusion of motor skills indicators can further improve the ability of the model in predicting a patient\u2019s post-stroke ADL.\nBesides patients\u2019 health and/or cognitive status, there were also studies showing existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in stroke incidence in the U.S., which also contributes to disparities in stroke mortality (Howard et al., 2011; Pinto et al., 2017). For instance, African American women had significantly higher mortality rates from stroke than White women despite advances in treatment and the management of risk factors (Kuhajda et al., 2006). A study in England also confirmed the strong impacts of socioeconomic disparities in the incidence of hospitalization for first-ever stroke and post-stroke survival. By including the demographic and socioeconomic variables in the analysis, the current study would be able to identify the extent to which different sub-populations are influenced by stroke differently in terms of long-term health.\nStroke research has highlighted treatment targets in rehabilitation (Cramer et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2017; Eng et al., 2019). However, few studies have examined multiple domains to elucidate contributors to better ADLs and greater life expectancy post-stroke. Furthermore, variables in these studies were almost exclusively limited to factors measured after the onset of the illness. Even when pre- and post-stroke factors were analyzed (Kang, 2021), the variables included were almost exclusively limited to factors in one or two specific domains.\nTo fill this critical gap, this study used pre- and post-factors across multiple domains to predict functional impairments and mortality.\nThis study employed a large data set that used a longitudinal design to carry out a series of analyses to determine: 1) the relative significance of variables before and after the report of stroke from demographics, cognitive and emotional health, motor skills, and\nsocioeconomic characteristics in influencing a patient\u2019s activity of daily living; 2) statistical significance of variables in predicting post-stroke mortality."

Multiple domains of variables were included: demographics, cognitive and emotional health, socioeconomic characteristics, and health indices.\nTo elucidate how pre- and post-stroke factors were related to long-term health and mortality, the researcher used a baseline floating approach, first identifying the time point (wave) when participants experienced their first stroke and then extracting variables of interest before (T0) and immediately after the onset of stroke (T1), 2 years after stroke (T2), 4 years following the stroke (T3). This approach reorganized the data into an analyzable format for the current investigation. The researcher also selected the year when the stroke occurred as a potential variant given that healthcare resources had changed dramatically over the years. Due to our interest in cognition and depression before, during, and after stroke, four waves of data for each eligible participant were included: before the report of stroke (i.e., pre-stroke), when the participant reported stroke (i.e., stroke), and following the participant\u2019s report of stroke (i.e., 2 and 4 years post-stroke). Participants who experienced a stroke in the first three waves (1992\u20131996) were excluded since cognition data in these waves were either different or lacked mental status measurement.\nThe final sample resembled the US population with 78.69% White or Caucasian, 18.27% Black or African American, and 2.90% other races.

These variables are important predictors of post stroke health as both the prevalence rate and impacts of stroke after-care are disproportionate across different demographic groups.\nVariables such as gender, race, heart problems, lung problems, high blood pressure, psychiatric problems, gross motor skills, mobility, and diabetes were dummy coded for two reasons: 1) To enable easier interpretation; 2) To enable incorporation into\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 915653\nbinary models. For race, there were three categories, White, Black, and Others. Given that few belonged to others and it is unclear what the category\u2019s composition is, we dummy coded the variables such that White is 0 and Black and others are 1. Similarly, the gender variable (GENDER) is recoded such that 1 is male and 0 is female. For medical conditions, they originally include multiple conditions. For instance, heart\nproblem (HEART) was initially included in the following way: no heart problem as 1, heart attack as 2, coronary heart disease\nas 3, angina as 4, congestive heart failure as 5, and heart valve complications as 6. No diagnosed health problem was coded as 0 and health problem diagnosed as 1 in present study as only the presence of these conditions could impact ADL and\nmortality. Lung problem (LUNG), high blood pressure (HIBP), and psychiatric problem (PSYCH) are recoded in the same pattern. The wealth of each participant is indicated by the variable ATOTN (total non-housing assets), which reflects assets other than real estate\u2014the financial ability of each patient\u2014 following stroke. Cognition was evaluated in the form of a total cognition score that adds the total recall and mental status\nindices together. These indices are obtained through the tests on immediate and delayed word recall (DLRC), the serial 7s test (SER7), backward counting from 20, object naming, and vocabulary (VOCAB) (the University of Michigan and National Institute of Aging, 2020). DLRC is a count of the number of words from the 10 or 20 words immediate recall list that were recalled correctly after a delay of about 5 min spent answering other survey questions. The Serial 7s test asks the individual to subtract 7 from the prior number, beginning with 100 for five trials. Correct subtractions are measured, and the valid scores are 0\u20135. Depression was measured by the 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale. The index includes six \u201cnegative\u201d indicators (depression, everything is an effort, sleep is restless, felt alone, felt sad, and could not get going) and two \u201cpositive\u201d indicators (felt happy and enjoyed life). Finally, the variable \u201cactivities of daily\nliving\u201d were selected to elucidate a multi-aspect understanding of the cognition performance of patients with stroke, as physical disability can exemplify a form of cognitive impairment. We also imputed a binary variable to reflect the patient\u2019s mortality at each wave (i.e., 0 means dead and 1 means alive) based on the interview date and death date."

A baseline floating approach was employed to examine cognition and depression in the context of stroke. Descriptive data analysis was performed to understand whether stroke impacts the development of depression and cognition. Multiple regression is then utilized by finding the optimal parameters for the predictions to fit a Gaussian curve. This regression analysis determines to what extent demographics, post-stroke depression, cognitive impairment, socioeconomics, and functional impairment predict the long-term health (indicated by ADLs) among patients with stroke. The model was estimated using the following formula:\nYi = \u03b20 + \u03b21X1i + \u03b22X2i + ...+ \u03b2kXki + \u03b5i | (1)\nYi is the dependent variable, which is the patients\u2019 ADLs in this context. All the selected variables are then arranged from X1i to Xki. To better represent the depression data, we used the statistical modeling program Mplus to classify the depression trajectories of all individual patients into meaningful subgroups, which were later included as independent variables in the models. Specifically, we constructed a multiple regression model to investigate the relationship between the patients\u2019 ADL and indicators of their emotional cognitive (e.g., depression trajectories, cognition score), socioeconomic, and functional status.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 915653\nLater, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)\u2014a type of supervised machine learning approach\u2014 was used to select the most robust predictors for mortality (T3_DefAlive). The goal of LASSO regression is to obtain the subset of predictors that maximizes prediction accuracy for an outcome variable. LASSO achieves this by shrinking the coefficients of non-important predictors to zero. Given the relatively large number of predictors and relatively small sample size, traditional multiple regression analyses are underpowered to detect all effects and subject to multicollinearity and overfitting issues. LASSO, on the contrary, applies a penalization parameter that reduces regression coefficients of less important predictors to zero. This not only addresses the issues of multicollinearity and model overfitting but also improves the interpretability of the resulting statistical model (Tibshirani, 1996; McNeish, 2015). To select lambda\u2014the optimal shrinkage parameter\u2014for the LASSO model and obtain mean cross-validation estimates of model performance, 10-fold cross-validation (90% data set for training and 10% set for validation) with three repetitions was conducted when building the model using the caret package in R (Kuhn, 2021), following the recommendation of Kuhn and Johnson (2013). The model uses the following penalty to ridge regression:\nSSEl1 =\nn\u2211\ni=1\n(yi \u2212 y\u0302i) 2 + \u03bb\nP\u2211\nj=1\n| \u03b2i | (2)\nGiven that splitting the data set into a single training and test set makes it difficult to accurately characterize uncertainty in prediction, especially when the sample size is small, this study used repeated 10-fold cross-validation to provide more reasonable estimates of how accurate the resultant model would be in using the same variables to predict long-term health of patients with stroke in unseen future data sets. Using the VarImp() function of the caret package, variable importance was estimated and visualized by reordering the predictor coefficients that are not shrunken to zero on a scale from 0 to 100 with the predictor of the greatest magnitude scoring 100."

            "text": "The selected sample included a total of 2,342 participants. Our data included evaluations of T0, T1, T2, and T3. Across the 4 assessments, 751 were deceased within 4 years post-stroke.\nBefore any regression analysis, a correlation test was performed on all variables that would be included in future models to check for multicollinearity. From the correlation plot (Figure 2), it can be observed that although some pre-stroke variables are correlated with their post-stroke counterparts, most variables of different categories are not strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, future models would not encounter strong multicollinearity.\nThe multiple regression model in the study used demographics, pre- and post-stroke emotion, cognition, socioeconomics, and health condition indicators as independent variables to predict the dependent variable each patient\u2019s ADLs\n4 years post-stroke. The summarized results shed light on the relative importance of each variable in predicting ADLs 4 years following the stroke (T3ADLA). The patients\u2019 activities of daily living right after stroke (T1ADLA) have the highest statistical significance (P < 0.001) and a positive association with the patient\u2019s ADLs 4 years post-stroke, meaning that higher difficulty in daily activities right after stroke onset correlates with higher difficulty in daily activities 4 years after stroke. Conversely, the pre-stroke ADLs of the patient (T0ADLA) are insignificant in predicting post-stroke ADLs at all (P = 0.46). Apart from T1ADLA, variables like gender, LGMUSA, MOBILA, and heart problems also have strong statistical (P < 0.01) significance in predicting ADLs 4 years following a stroke. Besides, the gender variable positively predicts the ADLs, which indicates that male patients tend to have larger difficulty in daily activities 4 years after stroke. Moreover, LGMUSA and MOBILA also have strong statistical significance and a positive correlation with ADLs. The heart problem variable (HEART) shares a negative correlation with the ADLs, indicating that patients with more heart issues tend to have less difficulty in daily activities 4 years after stroke. Finally, the total non-housing assets of a patient (T0ATOTN) is a marginally significant (P < 0.1) variable that has a negative correlation with the DV. In other words, the more the patient\u2019s initial asset, the less difficulty in daily activities four years after the onset of stroke.\nThe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to analyze the predictors for patients\u2019 mortality. LASSO penalizes less important predictors by shrinking their coefficients to 0, and can thus better address issues of multicollinearity and overfitting. Three LASSO models are specified: Model A only includes pre-stroke variables, Model B only includes post-stroke variables, and Model C includes both. The study also obtained the cross-validation estimates of model performance. The LASSO model that includes both pre- (T0) and post-stroke (T1) variables has a fair performance (0.73 < AUC < 0.78, mean AUC = 0.75) in predicting the likelihood of the patients\u2019 mortality. The performance of the model that only includes post-stroke variables is less accurate, which has a mean AUC of (0.68 < AUC < 0.72, mean AUC = 0.70) in predicting mortality. The model that only includes pre-stroke variables also has a similar mean AUC: 0.69 < AUC < 0.72, mean AUC = 0.70). Models with only pre- and post-stroke predictors exhibited comparable performance, though they were less accurate in classification than the model with both pre- and post-stroke factors. Therefore, subsequent analyses were only performed for the model with the highest accuracy. Based on the LASSO models, the study examined the relative importance of all variables included and plotted the top 20 most influential predictors of mortality (Figure 3).\nAccording to the plot, post-stroke BMI has the most important (100%) impact on mortality. Other health-related variables like post-stroke mobility (62%) and pre-stroke large muscle index (45%) are also relatively important predictors.

Collectively, these risk factors accounted for 88.1% of the PAR for all strokes. On our list, T0HIBP (corresponds to hypertension, first above) is not significant to ADLs. The reason could be that blood pressure is effectively controlled after a stroke. Smoking is not on our list, perhaps for the same reason. BMI (waist-to-hip ratio, the third above) is the most significant factor influencing ADLs because ADLs worsen BMI and then restrain ADLs.\nPatients\u2019 ADLs right after a stroke have the highest statistical significance in predicting their ADLs 4 years following a stroke.

This discrepancy in predictability demonstrates how stroke may alter one\u2019s ADLs from its original trajectory, making pre-stroke ADLs information less predictive. In addition, the majority of statistically significant predictors for ADL are physical health indices. Baseline LGMUSA measures the strength of large muscles before the stroke, which strongly correlates with one\u2019s physical health. Its statistical significance in turn highlights the positive influence of a high prestroke muscle strength on ADL in the aftermath of a stroke. Similarly, a patient\u2019s mobility immediately after stroke onset also positively correlates with their long-term ADLs. Hence, an improvement in one\u2019s post-stroke mobility holds the potential to improve their ADL. Surprisingly, the presence of pre-stroke heart problems is associated with better post-stroke ADLs. This may be attributed to the possibility that patients who originally have heart problems may already have experience in cardiac rehabilitation, which reduces their difficulties in adapting to post-stroke daily living (Ellis et al., 2010). Finally, patients\u2019 pre-stroke total non-housing assets are a marginally significant socioeconomic factor for better ADLs. In other words, patients with higher socioeconomic status before stroke are likely to perform activities of daily living better 4 years following a stroke. Based on the LASSO model constructed in this research, the classification of post-stroke mortality vs. survival using pre- and post-stroke demographic, socioeconomic, cognition, emotion, and physical health indicators was fairly accurate. Although the LASSO model includes 37 variables, its AUC value is less than 0.75. This shows that the relationship between mortality and pre- and post-stroke variables included in the study is unlikely to be linear. Additionally, the AUC of the model that includes both pre- and post-stroke variables (0.73) is not significantly higher than that of models with only post-stroke variables (0.70). Hence, we can infer that pre-stroke variables are important but are unable to significantly improve the performance of the LASSOmodel. The variables\u2019 importance plot\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 915653\n(based on the LASSO regression) shows the relative importance of different factors in predicting one\u2019s post-stroke mortality. These results suggest that physical health indicators such as BMI, MOBILA, and LGMUSA have the strongest impact on one\u2019s mortality. Cognition variables including mental status summary score and pre- and post-stroke delayed word recall are also significant predictors of a patient\u2019s mortality. Finally, post-stroke mortality more likely happens to men and older adults, which demonstrates the importance of demographics in influencing mortality."

            "text": "Although the study is overall successful in demonstrating the relative importance of multi-domain pre- and post-stroke variables in predicting functional abilities and mortality among a large sample of patients with stroke, there are also several limitations: 1) Using the prediction of patients\u2019 ADLs for 4 years after stroke as the criteria for the importance of preand post-stroke variables presents bias as only survivors can be investigated. Nevertheless, this limitation is already partially addressed in the study as both ADLs and mortality are employed as indicators of long-term health. Hence, the effect of pre- and post-stroke variables on stroke patients who did not survive is also identified. 2) The relatively low AUC values of our LASSO models may result from other likely important variables that cannot be investigated given the nature of this pre-collected, open-access data set; 3) As a large-scale longitudinal study assessing multi-domain factors of a large sample, the measures included in this study are limited. For instance, the only emotion indicator included in the data set is depression. Without emotion-related measures such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress, the regression analysis performed is unlikely to reflect the full picture of whether and how emotion predicts long-term health; Future directions can be suggested based on the current limitations:\n1) To further improve the accuracy of the models in informing the prognosis of stroke, deep learning can be applied to summarize more patterns of the variables. Subsequently, the models will not just be limited to linear regression, and the variables will not necessarily need to be dichotomized. 2) Future studies examining other potential neurocognitive predictors such as anxiety may provide additional information to findings from the current investigation and shed light on long term risk and resilience among patients with stroke. 3) To identify more individual differences of patients with stroke that could lead to different health consequences, future datasets that include both quantitative and qualitative data may improve existing rehabilitative treatment to improve post stroke prognosis."

            "text": "The study examined the relative significance of pre- and post-stroke demographic, socioeconomic, cognition, emotion, and physical health indicators as predictors of functional impairments and mortality among a large sample of patients\nwith stroke. We arrived at the conclusion that: 1) activities of daily living, mobility just after stroke, heart problem, large muscle index before the stroke, and gender are the significant variables influencing a patient\u2019s activities of daily living. 2) BMI, AGE, mobility just after stroke, BMI mobility, and large muscle index before stroke are the most important factors in predicting post-stroke mortality.\nThe results of the study are insightful in showing that:\n1) Given the important roles BMI, mobility (MOBILA), and large muscle index (LGMUSA) play in long-term ADLs and mortality, it is highly desirable for patients with stroke to incorporate diet, exercise, and behavioral rehabilitation to improve their movement skills in order to maintain long-term functional capacity and reduce the likelihood of mortality. 2) Given the importance of pre-stroke delayed memory and mobility in predicting mortality, monitoring and improving memory and movement skills among the geriatric population have the potential to reduce one\u2019s likelihood of poor functional outcomes after a stroke occurs. 3) Due to the importance of post-stroke delayed memory and mental status in reducing the likelihood of mortality, cognitive remediation should also be implemented in improving one\u2019s post-stroke health; 4) The positive correlation between the socioeconomic status and the patients\u2019 ADLs raises the issue of extra caring and financial support required for patients with stroke in lowerSES families.\nAUTHOR\u2019S NOTE\nThe code used to perform the analysis can be found online at https://github.com/4818002/Longitudinal_Stroke_Analysis.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
