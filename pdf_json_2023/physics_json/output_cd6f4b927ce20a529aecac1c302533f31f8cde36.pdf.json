    "abstractText": "To enhance the leaching of chalcopyrite concentrates, this study evaluated a new process for extracting copper using iodized solutions and sulfuric acid diluted in seawater without pressure or high temperatures. The work involved a leaching test carried out under various conditions by varying the concentrations of chloride ions, H2SO4, and an evenly distributed oxygen supply in an aeration system. It was demonstrated that Cl\u2212 ion addition could promote the chalcopyrite-leaching process. The leaching efficiency of copper reached 70% after 96 h. However, a chloride ion dosage excess can have the opposite effect on extraction, reducing copper recovery. XRD and SEM-EDS results showed that cuprous chloride (CuCl) was formed at high dosages (>0.5 M); meanwhile, at a lower dosage, elemental sulfur (S) was formed in the presence of sulfuric acid solution and seawater medium. In contrast, in an aerated system, surface roughness markedly increased due to continuous oxidation on the surface of the ore. This change in morphology and the high value of the redox potential, given by the aerated system and the acidic environment, allowed copper recovery of up to 70% after 96 h. The results showed that an aerated system is the most effective factor in chalcopyrite concentrate leaching.",

            "text": "Chalcopyrite mineral (CuFeS2) is one of the most significant sulfides, and approximately 70% of the world\u2019s copper resources are hosted in this mineral [1]. Furthermore, around 80% of the known copper occurs in copper porphyry deposits and sediments [2], commonly processed with smelting operations of copper concentrates [3]. The extractive metallurgy of chalcopyrite predominantly relies on a conventional pathway encompassing comminution and flotation, smelting, and electro-refining, accounting for approximately 85% of copper production in Chile [4]. The hydrometallurgical extraction of copper from this chalcopyrite mineral is considered to be a more environmentally friendly operation compared with the use of pyrometallurgical extraction, especially for copper sulfide minerals of low grades [5]. However, processing via the hydrometallurgical route is limited, both in oxidative and reductive processes, due to characteristics such as the refractory nature of the mineral during leaching [6] and its main limitation related to mineral passivation caused by the formation of elemental sulfur, polysulfide species, hydroxy sulfate species of iron, or a combination of these [7\u201310]. Various hydrometallurgical processes of the primary copper mineral have been carried out to reduce leaching times and increase its dissolution rate. Currently, the hydrometallurgical leaching process of chalcopyrite can be divided into three categories: oxidative leaching, coordination leaching, and bioleaching. For some of the main parameters studied\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5940. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16175940 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5940 2 of 18\nin this regard, researchers have conducted tests with the addition of different concentrations of chloride to leaching systems and even by using direct seawater, desalinated water, or hypersaline water [11\u201323]. Additionally, the effect of oxygen addition to the system has been studied as a parameter to break the passivation layer and reduce the leaching times of the mineral [24\u201327]."

            "text": "The development of chloride-mediated coordination leaching, although pioneered decades ago, has gained greater relevance in recent times due to its attractive features and its capacity to treat copper concentrates in a less environmentally detrimental manner. Some of the main advantages offered by the use of chloride ions in leaching systems are (i) higher leaching kinetics under atmospheric conditions; (ii) catalytic effect of chloride ions due to the formation of metal complexes; (iii) high solubility of copper and iron in chloride solutions depending on pH [15,28]; and (iv) the fact that pH is maintained at a desired value for a longer time. In addition to the above, the effects of chloride ions on the mineral surface not only result in higher copper extraction rates but also increase the porosity on the mineral surface, reducing the tendency for chalcopyrite passivation [16,18,29,30]. The increased porosity generated by chloride solutions reduces the diffusion barrier between the sulfur formed on the mineral surface and the leaching agents. Lu, Jeffrey [16] demonstrated this in chalcopyrite concentrates, where leaching heaps with chloride solutions formed a porous crystalline sulfur layer, unlike heaps without chloride solutions, where an amorphous or cryptocrystalline sulfur layer is formed. This crystalline and porous layer allows for better access of oxidants to the mineral surface. The presence of chlorides in a sulfuric acid medium, in addition to providing improved kinetics and oxidation of sulfur to its elemental form, tends to form complex chlorocopper species (known as chloro-complexes) that modify the redox potentials, allowing for lower oxidation potentials required for chalcopyrite leaching (540 mV) compared with the typically required potential of over 750 mV in a sulfate medium [13]. The formation of chloro-complexes, which positively affects the leaching chemistry, exhibits higher anodic activity and induces changes in surface morphology [18]. The ability of chloride ions to form complexes is crucial. Berger and Winand [31] have proposed the following classification of the strength of Cl\u2212 receptors: AgCl > CuCl > PbCl2 > ZnCl2 > CuCl2 > FeCl3 > FeCl2 > NiCl2 > HCl, NaCl, KCl (Cl\u2212 donors). While cuprous chloride (CuCl) is sparingly soluble in water, its solubility increases in the presence of chlorides [32]. In contrast, as the chloride concentration increases, the solubility of Cu2+ decreases [33]. Table 1 displays the thermodynamic values of complex formation when cuprous and cupric ions are present in the solution (Reactions (1)\u2013(7)) [34\u201337].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5940 3 of 18\nAccording to the generation of cupric chloro-complexes from the previous table, only CuCl+ and CuCl3\u2212 are thermodynamically feasible and could dissolve chalcopyrite, as indicated by Reactions (9) and (10).\nCuFeS2 + 3Cu2+ + 4Cl\u2212 \u2192 4CuCl + Fe2+ + 2S \u2206G \u25e6 25 \u25e6C = \u221251.20kJ (8)\nCuFeS2 + 3CuCl\u22123 \u2192 4CuCl + Fe 2+ + 5Cl\u2212 + 2S \u2206G \u25e6 25 \u25e6C = \u221291.94kJ (9)\nCuFeS2 + 3CuCl+ + Cl\u2212 \u2192 4CuCl + Fe2+ + 2S \u2206G \u25e6 25 \u25e6C = \u221244.61kJ (10)\nAccording to this thermodynamic analysis, it is likely that precipitated CuCl is formed as a product of the reactions. Furthermore, the formed CuCl, in the presence of oxygen and an acidic medium, dissolves according to reaction (11), generating the leaching reagent CuCl+. This reaction has a value of \u2206G\u25e6 = \u2212267.86 kJ.\n4CuCl + 4H+ + O2 \u2192 4CuCl+ + 2H2O \u2206G \u25e6 25 \u25e6C = \u2212267.86kJ (11)"

            "text": "However, corrosion under moderate chloride conditions has been one of the disadvantages of its use in this type of coordination leaching, which is why the oxidative leaching of minerals using air or oxygen is currently a widely utilized technique in the extractive industry for extracting valuable metals. Oxygen plays an essential role in this process as it aids in dissolving metals in the leaching solution. Nevertheless, under normal pressure conditions, the oxygen present in the atmosphere does not possess the necessary potential to enable the leaching of copper present in chalcopyrite. Therefore, it is necessary to use other oxidizing agents to achieve the appropriate redox potential for the leaching process. In the case of chalcopyrite mineral, the presence of oxygen significantly enhances the copper dissolution rate by regenerating ferric ions (Fe3+) [38,39]. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of chloride concentrations and an aerated system on copper recovery involving the addition of potassium iodide (KI) as an oxidizing agent in an acidic medium with seawater. The use of this type of iodide salt dissolves sulfide minerals due to the high proton activity generated by the mixture of acid and oxygen. In addition, the chloride ions provided by seawater aid in the kinetics of mineral leaching. Additionally, this study aims to further investigate the characterization and morphological changes that occur due to the addition of these variables in the leaching of copper concentrates, allowing the surface of chalcopyrite mineral to be attacked, resulting in the creation of cracks or a porous surface that enables the leaching solution to penetrate and exchange ions."

Each reactor was loaded with 1 L of leaching solution (sulfuric acid, seawater, iodide potassium, and sodium chloride) and was sealed with film to avoid evaporation. Once the solution reached the desired temperature, 50 g of solid sample was added to the reactor. Before the leaching tests, the concentrate sample was washed with distilled water and acetone (C3H6O) with the purpose to remove any remaining flotation reagents used in the process of concentration. The pulp was stirred to obtain a homogenous mix using a propeller at a rotation speed of 450 rpm. A 10 mL aliquot of solution was taken periodically during the test for copper analysis using the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy method (AAS). Redox potential (ORP) and pH were measured throughout the test with a portable Hanna meter model HI991003 (HANNA, Woonsocket, RI, USA). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The solid residues were carefully filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 60 \u25e6C to constant weight. Samples for mineralogical characterization and particle-size determination were taken. To study the effect of chloride ions on chalcopyrite leaching, the following was performed: In addition to the conditions mentioned above, the leaching experiments were conducted for a leaching time of 96 h. The leaching solution used was direct seawater with an approximate chloride concentration of 20 g/L. Additional amounts of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 g/L were added to seawater to obtain final concentrations of 25, 30, 45, 70, and 120 g/L, respectively. In the case of an aerated system, the airflow was obtained using a pump that supplied an airflow of 3 L/min. Before meeting the solution, the air was dispersed into small bubbles, typically > 1 mm, using an air diffuser with a height of 15 cm to maximize contact with the solution.

In contrast, systems with acid molarity of 0.1 M maintain pH values between 0.8 and 1.4. In the system with acid molarity of 0.1 M and seawater, as the leaching time progresses, subtle increases are observed, indicating that the acid is consumed during the process. The pH values with seawater and 0.1 M acid show a slight increase over time due to the reactions involving the present chloride (Cl\u2212). This allows the acid to be consumed, while chlorine is oxidized and released as gaseous Cl2.\n3.2. Influence of Chloride Concentration (Cl\u2212) without Oxidant To assess the extent to which chloride ions enhance the leaching of concentrates, the sample was initially leached without the addition of an oxidant.

The extraction results obtained using only freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) (without chloride addition) are also included. According to the results, an increase in chloride concentration leads to an increase in copper dissolution from the concentrates, with an optimal value being observed at 45 g/L Cl\u2212 (which corresponds to the 20 g/L Cl\u2212 from seawater and an additional 25 g/L Cl\u2212).

Figure 7 shows the results of the extraction curves obtained with the addition of chloride.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 20\nAccording to the graph, generally, a higher chloride concentration allows for greater copper extraction because in saline and alkaline environments, chalcopyrite and bornite are more susceptible to oxidation, which is consistent with the literature [15,43]. However, this increase is observed only up to chloride doses below 70 g/L. According to Figure 7, the presence of free chloride in the initial leaching medium, considering the use of seawater, increases copper extraction, with copper extraction of 57.0% being achieved with the addition of 45 g of chloride ions, and 43.7% extraction, when no additional chloride is used in the leaching system. This improvement in leaching is attributed to the increased presence of chloride ions, which facilitate the breakdown of the chalcopyrite sulfide matrix [44]. Furthermore, the use of only freshwater without any presence of chloride ions allows for copper extraction of only 39.5%, which is mainly attributed to the oxidative strength of the acid and iodide present. Thus, in the absence of chloride ions, the dissolution of chalcopyrite is lower. Figure 8 illustrates the final copper extraction at 96 h of leaching with different total concentrations of chloride ions in the solution. It can be observed that an increase in the chloride ion concentration leads to an improvement in extraction. However, this increase has a limit (between 45 and 70 g/L chloride ions), beyond which the extraction dramatically decreases. This decrease in the percentage of copper extraction with an increase in chloride addition has been reported by Lu, Jeffrey [16], Ruiz, Montes [45], who established that chloride concentrations higher than 0.5 M do not influence the leaching of chalcopyrite. Furthermore, Palmer, Nebo [46] indicated that the leaching rate increases with concentration if the addition of sodium chloride is low but becomes independent of concentration for values higher than one molar.

That is due to the interaction of oxygen with the solution and mineral, which enhances the leaching kinetics. In this case, the leaching of chalcopyrite can proceed in two steps. In the first or initial stage (reaction (13)), the principal chemical reaction is mineral oxidation via the oxygen reduction reaction. With the progression of leaching, the soluble concentrations of Cu and Fe increase due to their extraction and are released into the solution. The ferrous species (Fe2+) formed via reaction (13) can be oxidized by oxygen to generate ferric species (Fe3+) (reaction (14)), which can further oxidize the mineral (reaction (15)). As ferric species are now involved in the leaching of chalcopyrite, copper extraction increases in the final stage [48]. However, it is widely recognized that slow leaching kinetics can be encountered in this final stage, as many studies have shown that the rate-limiting step for copper extraction is the transport process through the formed sulfur layer [29,41,49].\nCuFeS2 + O2 + 4H+ \u2192 2Cu2+ + Fe2+ + 2S\u25e6 + 2H2O (13)\n4Fe2+ + O2 + 4H+ \u2192 4Fe3+ + 2H2O (14)\nCuFeS2 + 4Fe3+ \u2192 Cu2+ + 5Fe2+ + 2S\u25e6 (15)\nFigure 14 depicts the reaction mechanism between chalcopyrite mineral and oxygen in an acidic environment.

Similarly, at\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5940 14 of 18\npoint 2, the ferrous ion (Fe2+) is oxidized to a ferric ion (Fe3+), acting as an additional oxidant in the system. This oxidation process facilitates the release of the copper ion into the solution, while oxygen (O2) is reduced to a superoxide ion (O2\u2212). Simultaneously, the sulfide ion reacts with oxygen, resulting in the production of sulfur, which precipitates onto the mineral\u2019s surface. Under conditions of high oxidation (with a substantial oxygen supply), the reaction between elemental sulfur and oxygen generates sulfuric acid [50]. The formation of sulfates from sulfuric acid arises from a series of reactions. Following the generation of elemental sulfur on the surface of chalcopyrite mineral and facilitated by the presence of dissolved oxygen in the solution, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is obtained with the reaction of sulfur with oxygen.

In the first or initial stage (reaction 13), the principal chemical reaction is mineral oxidation via the oxygen reduction reaction. With the progression of leaching, the soluble concentrations of Cu and Fe increase due to their extraction and are released into the solution. The ferrous species (Fe2+) formed via reaction 13 can be oxidized by oxygen to generate ferric species (Fe3+) (reaction 14), which can further oxidize the mineral (reaction 15). As ferric species are now involved in the leaching of chalcopyrite, copper extraction increases in the final stage [48]. However, it is widely recognized that slow leaching kinetics can be encountered in this final stage, as many studies have shown that the rate-limiting step for copper extraction is the transport process through the formed sulfur layer [29,41,49].

At point 1, the Cu+ ion, released into the solution by the oxidant, undergoes oxidation to Cu2+ by losing an electron to the oxygen present. Similarly, at point 2, the ferrous ion (Fe2+) is oxidized to a f rric ion (Fe3+), acting as an additional oxidant in the system. This oxidation process facilitates the rele s of the copper ion int th solution, while oxygen (O2) is reduced to a superoxide ion (O2\u2212). Simultaneously, the sulfide ion reacts with oxygen, resulting in the production of sulfur, which precipitates onto the mineral\u2019s surface.

Conditions: 100 ppm of KI, 45 \u25e6C, 50 g of sample with 1000 mL of seawater solution, stirring rate of 450 rpm.\nTherefore, according to the above, the presence of oxygen during chalcopyrite leaching allows for the regeneration of active oxidants. According to the results of the redox potential for both experiments, it remains at values close to 600 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) for both systems. The potential of the system with 0.5 M sulfuric acid shows a slightly higher value than the system with 0.1 M sulfuric acid, which is due to the higher acidity creating a more aggressive environment for chalcopyrite mineral. Similarly, oxygen allows for favorable copper extraction, but its excessive use from the bottom of the reactor and a particle size below 200 mesh cause sulfides (including chalcopyrite) to adhere to the bubble due to the hydrophobic nature of the mineral and its ambient oxidation [51]. The hydrophobicity of sulfides has been attributed to oxidation reactions on the particle surface, which result in higher exposure of sulfur from Cu-S and Fe-S bonds. This sulfur is highly hydrophobic, and even the release of copper and iron ions contributes to the hydrophobicity necessary for adherence to bubbles. The pH values obtained from both systems (with air and without air) showed that in the case of induced aeration with a concentration of 0.1 M acid, the pH steadily increased, reaching a value close to 1.7 after 96 h. On the other hand, with a concentration of 0.5 M acid, the pH remained constant and close to zero throughout the test. The systems without induced air showed similar pH behavior with both acid concentrations. Based on the results shown, it can be observed that air is a much more influential factor than sulfuric acid in copper extraction [40].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5940 15 of 18"

            "text": "To assess the surface characteristics of the leached mineral, an SEM analysis was performed on the tailings with the use of air and 0.5 M H2SO4. The objective was to observe any potential alterations in the morphology or texture of the concentrate grains. The findings of this analysis are overall depicted in Figure 15. Initially, Figure 15a presents an image of the tailings at a magnification of 300\u00d7, offering an perspective. Notably, the particles exhibit sponge-like precipitates on their surfaces. Figure 15b,c provide a more detailed examination of the chalcopyrite grain morphology and their response to the introduction of air. Based on the XRD analysis presented in Figure 15d, it can be observed that the layer formed on the chalcopyrite particles is composed of elemental sulfur. No other mineral phases were detected in the analysis. Since there were no significant oxidative conditions present to generate SO42\u2212, the addition of air to the solution resulted in the formation of a crystalline sulfur layer. This aligns with the mechanism proposed by Mojtahedi, Rasouli [48], which is consistent with the results proposed in the present study. Therefore, in an aerated system with oxygen, reactions (13) and (15) were the oxidation reactions for the initial and subsequent stages of chalcopyrite mineral, consistently with previous studies [29,52,53].

However, it is concluded that concentrations greater than 45 g/L chloride are not necessary to achieve this effect. \u2022 A chloride ion concentration of 45 g/L in the leaching solution allows for an improved leaching rate of chalcopyrite concentrates in the presence of potassium iodide, resulting in a maximum copper recovery of 57%. \u2022 According to SEM-EDS and XRD analyses, the presence of a high chloride dosage resulted in significant precipitation of the CuCl compound on chalcopyrite grains, along with a lesser amount of elemental sulfur and moderate porosity. This is because the chloride ion, at high doses, is freely available in solution and reacts with Cu2+ ions. Additionally, with the addition of 25 g/L chloride, no CuCl compound was detected, and only a few precipitates of elemental sulfur were detected. \u2022 Treating chalcopyrite ore with the addition of air as an additional oxidant achieves high copper extraction of approximately 70% in a shorter leaching time. According to surface analyses using SEM, the presence of air in the interstices of the grains contributes to the formation of sponge-like elemental sulfur on the surface, creating high porosity, which facilitates ion exchange within the solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.I.C. and M.E.T.; methodology, C.I.C.; software, C.I.C.; formal analysis, C.I.C. and M.E.T.; investigation, C.I.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.I.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.I.C. and M.E.T.
