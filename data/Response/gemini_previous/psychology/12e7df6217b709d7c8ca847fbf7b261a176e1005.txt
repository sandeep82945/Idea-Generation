1. **Investigate the effect of different anions on the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs.** The current study only looked at the effect of the cation on CO2 absorption. Future research could investigate how different anions, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, affect the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs. This information could be used to design APILs with even higher CO2 absorption capacities.


2. **Study the recyclability of APILs over multiple cycles.** The current study only looked at the recyclability of APILs over a single cycle. Future research could investigate how the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs changes over multiple cycles. This information is important for understanding the long-term viability of APILs for CO2 capture applications.


3. **Explore the use of APILs for CO2 capture from flue gas.** The current study only looked at the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs in pure CO2. Future research could investigate the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs in flue gas, which is a more realistic scenario for CO2 capture applications. This information would help to determine the feasibility of using APILs for CO2 capture from power plants and other industrial sources.


4. **Develop new methods for the synthesis of APILs.** The current methods for the synthesis of APILs are often time-consuming and expensive. Future research could focus on developing new methods for the synthesis of APILs that are more efficient and cost-effective. This would make APILs more accessible for a wider range of applications.


5. **Investigate the use of APILs for other gas separation applications.** The current study only looked at the use of APILs for CO2 capture. Future research could investigate the use of APILs for other gas separation applications, such as the separation of hydrogen from natural gas or the separation of oxygen from air. This information could lead to the development of new technologies for the production of clean fuels and other valuable chemicals.
