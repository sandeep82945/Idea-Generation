    "abstractText": "A one-dimensional photonic crystal with an additional TiO2 layer, supporting Bloch surface waves (BSW), was used for enhanced signal sensitivity for the detection of protein interaction. To compare the optical response of BSW and photonic crystals (PC), bovine serum albumin and specific antibodies against bovine serum were used as a model system. The results obtained show the enhanced sensitivity of pand s-BSW components for the 1D PC sample with an additional TiO2 layer. Furthermore, a higher sensitivity was obtained for the BSW component of p-polarization in the PC sample with an additional TiO2 layer, where the sensitivity of the ellipsometric parameter \u03a8 was five times higher and that of the \u2206 parameter was eight times higher than those of the PC sample. The capabilities of BSW excitations are discussed from the sensitivity point of view and from the design of advanced biosensing.",

            "text": "Metal oxides are widely used in various sensor applications [1\u20135] due to their optical transparency and tolerance to mechanical stress. Optical and electrical properties of such materials can be altered by modifying their structure, size and composition [6,7]. Metal oxides are suitable and widely applied dielectric materials for the production of various porous nanostructures [8\u201310] and photonic crystals (PC), due to the possibility of fabricating periodic nanostructures with high and low refractive index values [11\u201314]. Moreover, such periodic dielectric materials on a wavelengths scale comparable with period can generate Bragg reflections for incident photons and also can be used for the excitation of Bloch surface waves (BSW). The BSWs are a type of surface electromagnetic waves (SEW) generated at the interface between periodic dielectric multilayered structure and surrounding media [15] in which the electric field decays exponentially at the PC/ambient interface. Compared to the widely used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) generated on thin metal films, which has a narrow range of noble metals to choose from, the BSW excitation can be tuned in a wide spectral range by changing the materials and thickness of the bilayers in the 1D PC [16,17]. In recent studies, Lereu [18], Sinibaldi [16] and Balevicius [19] reported that BSW excitation has a higher sensitivity to amplitude changes than SPR. Similar to SPR, BSWs have been used for various nanophotonic applications [20\u201322]; however, such electromagnetic surface waves distinguished different properties from the surface plasmon polaritons. The propagation losses of BSWs are lower than those of SPPs due to purely dielectric materials, leading to higher quality factors of such surface resonances.\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 584. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12080584 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 584 2 of 10\nBSW excitation can be generated in both p- and s-polarizations, which allows the monitoring of both polarization states as the traditional SPR can only be generated in p-polarization [10]. To generate the BSW, a total internal reflection (TIR) geometry has to be used, as the dispersion of BSW lies below the light line in vacuum; thus, in order to generate BSW, the PC is attached to the prism base. The BSW can only be excited in the PC photonic band gap at a specific range of angles of incidence (AOI) due to the matching of the BSW in-plane wave vector. Additionally, the utilization of TIR prevents light travelling directly through liquids, which would otherwise reduce the signal intensity [23]. For a detailed analysis of BSW polarization states, the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) method in total internal reflection configuration (TIRE) can be applied [24]. SE allows us to measure not only the light polarization of p- and s-amplitude changes (\u03a8), but also the phase difference (\u2206), increasing the sensitivity of the TIRE method [25] compared to SPR reflection intensity measurements. The SE method also allows us to perform real-time measurements, enabling the measurement of the interaction between biomolecules [26\u201328]. BSWs have been investigated as a potential application for optical biosensing [17,29]. Due to the low extinction coefficient in dielectrics, the electromagnetic field does not quench in dielectrics, compared to metals, and thus, BSWs produce narrower resonance than SPR [16,18,19]. Moreover, dielectrics are biocompatible with biomolecules, making BSWs an attractive tool for optical biosensor application [30]. The aim of this research was to compare the optical response and sensitivity properties of two 1D photonic crystals with and without an additional TiO2 layer. Employing the TIRE method, the total internal reflection conditions provide the possibility of generating Bloch surface waves at the interface of the 1D PC and the ambient environment. Dispersion relations in liquid ambient were compared for both p- and s-polarizations in order to evaluate the sensitivity of different structures supporting BSW. Protein immobilization was performed to compare these BSW-based samples for possible applications in biosensing."

For the removal of the impurity layer, the ion source was used for the pre-sputtering of the target before deposition [31].

The sensitivity of both the PC and PC/TiO2 samples was evaluated based on the change in the ellipsometric parameters \u03a8 and \u0394 at 70\u00b0 AOI (Figures 3 and 4) divided by the spectral shift (\u03b4\u03a8/\u03b4\u03bb and \u03b4\u0394/\u03b4\u03bb). The resolution of the ellipsometer was equal to 1.5 nm; thus, narrow BSW excitations can have distorted spectra.

However, a much larger enhancement can be seen for the p-polarization component, as the \u03a8 parameter showed five times higher sensitivity in the PC/TiO2 sample than PC and eight times higher sensitivity for the \u0394 parameter. Meanwhile, for the s-polarization, the \u0394 sensitivity parameter for the PC sample was three times higher than PC/TiO2. This can be explained by the higher quality factor (Q-factor), which showed higher quality of BSW resonance for longer wavelengths compared with p-polarized BSW excitation. These results show an increased sensitivity of p-polarization BSW excitation in a sample with an additional TiO2 layer on top of PC. The additional TiO2 layer reduces the losses especially for the p-polarization component, as a result reducing the width of the resonance and increasing the sensitivity of the p-BSW because the p-component lies in the plane of incidence, and thus it interacts more with the structure of the additional TiO2 layer compared to the s-polarization component, which is reflected from the first interface.\nThe change in ellipsometric parameter \u03b4\u03a8 after BSA/anti-BSA complex formation obtained for p-polarization on PC/TiO2 was 8\u25e6 (Figure 4A). The \u03b4\u2206 for the same p-polarization was 74.7\u25e6 (Figure 4B). The shift in spectrum was \u03b4\u03bbp-BSW = 0.8 nm after BSA/anti-BSA complex formation. The change in parameter \u03a8 after BSA/anti-BSA complex formation (Figure 4C) for the s-polarization component was \u03b4\u03a8s-BSW = 3.9\u25e6. The \u03b4\u2206 for the s-polarization component of BSW (Figure 4D) was \u03b4\u2206s-BSW = 19.1\u25e6 after BSA/anti-BSA complex formation and the shift in spectra was 0.6 nm. The sensitivity of both the PC and PC/TiO2 samples was evaluated based on the change in the ellipsometric parameters \u03a8 and \u2206 at 70\u25e6 AOI (Figures 3 and 4) divided by the spectral shift (\u03b4\u03a8/\u03b4\u03bb and \u03b4\u2206/\u03b4\u03bb). The resolution of the ellipsometer was equal to 1.5 nm; thus, narrow BSW excitations can have distorted spectra. For this reason, the central wavelengths of the BSW excitations are presented as dotted lines (black for PBS, red for BSA and blue for anti-BSA) in Figures 3 and 4. The values of sensitivity parameters for both the p- and s-polarization components of the BSW excitation were evaluated after BSA immobilization and are presented in Table 1. When comparing the sensitivities of the PC and PC/TiO2 samples for pand s-polarizations, it can be seen that the additional TiO2 layer enhances the sensitivity of p- and s-polarization in the PC/TiO2 sample. However, a much larger enhancement can be seen for the p-polarization component, as the \u03a8 parameter showed five times higher sensitivity in the PC/TiO2 sample than PC and eight times higher sensitivity for the \u2206 parameter. Meanwhile, for the s-polarization, the \u2206 sensitivity parameter for the PC sam-\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 584 7 of 10\nple was three times higher than PC/TiO2. This can be explained by the higher quality factor (Q-factor), which showed higher quality of BSW resonance for longer wavelengths compared with p-polarized BSW excitation. These results show an increased sensitivity of p-polarization BSW excitation in a sample with an additional TiO2 layer on top of PC. The additional TiO2 layer reduces the losses especially for the p-polarization component, as a result reducing the width of the resonance and increasing the sensitivity of the p-BSW because the p-component lies in the plane of incidence, and thus it interacts more with the structure of the additional TiO2 layer compared to the s-polarization component, which is reflected from the first interface.\nThis is also confirmed by the estimation of the Q-factor, which is calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) divided by the central frequency of the resonance. The FWHM was equal to 4.3 nm and 3.6 nm for p-BSW in PC and PC/TiO2 samples, respectively, and 3.9 nm and 3.6 nm for s-BSW in PC and PC/TiO2 samples, respectively. The quality factor was equal to (Qp-BSW)PC = 92.4, (Qp-BSW)PC/TiO2 = 118.5, (Qs-BSW)PC = 155.4, (Qs-BSW)PC/TiO2 = 173.5. It can be seen that the Q-factor is higher for the sample with additional TiO2. Using the TIRE method, it is possible to obtain the biomolecules\u2019 interaction kinetics for both p- and s-polarizations in real time; such kinetics for covalent BSA immobilization and the BSA/anti-BSA complex are presented in Figure 5. As can be seen from Figure 5A, the \u03b4\u2206 vs. time for covalent BSA immobilization and the formation of the BSA/antiBSA complex as higher than when using the PC sample. The resonant wavelength for BSW on PC using p-polarized light was 395.7 nm, and on PC/TiO2 it was 429.2 nm. These wavelengths were chosen for monitoring of the covalent BSA immobilization and BSA/antiBSA complex formation. The \u03b4\u2206 for the p-polarization component of BSW excitation after covalent BSA immobilization on PC was 26.48\u25e6, and on the PC/TiO2 sample it was 71.5\u25e6. After BSA/anti-BSA complex formation, the \u03b4\u2206 was 13.34\u25e6 and 19.77\u25e6 on PC and PC/TiO2 samples, respectively. Figure 5B shows \u03b4\u2206 vs. time for covalent BSA immobilization and the formation of the BSA/anti-BSA complex on PC and PC/TiO2 for the BSW spolarization component. As was previously explained, the PC/TiO2 sample\u2019s sensitivity for the monitoring of BSA covalent immobilization is greater than that of the PC sample. The \u03b4\u2206 after BSA covalent immobilization was 15.88\u25e6 for PC and 20.76\u25e6 for PC/TiO2. After the BSA/anti-BSA complex formation on PC, \u03b4\u2206 was 7.24\u25e6, and on PC/TiO2 it was 11.87\u25e6, respectively.\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 584 8 of 10 Biosensors 2022, 12, 584 8 of 10"
