To illustrate the capability of the model we calculate the energies of the attached electron for the family of carbon cluster anions consisting of two-, three(equilateral triangle) and four (tetrahedron) carbon atoms equidistant from each other as well as for a C3 molecule having a chain structure. The considered approach can be easily extended to carbon clusters containing an arbitrary number of atoms arranged in an arbitrary confi guration.

Solutions to quantum mechanical problems of this type are extremely diffi cult. Reliable results of ab initio calculations are only available for clusters with relatively small numbers of constituents. For example, the structure and energy calculations of carbon cluster anions CN are reported for only up to N = 18 in [1,2]. There exists, however, such a fi eld, for which the problem of electron motion has a simple analytical solution. This is the fi eld formed by zero-range potentials. Within the approach described in [3,4], the molecular constituents are replaced by a set of N zero-range potential wells located at the positions Rj (j =1, 2, 3...N) of the nuclei. The goal of the present communication is a demonstration that the model of zero-range potentials [3,4] can be successfully employed for the description of attached electrons in atomic and molecular anions, for example, negatively charged carbon clusters with an arbitrary number of constituents arranged in an arbitrary confi guration. We briefl y outline the model in the next paragraph. The wave function of the electron ) (r \uf079 in a multicenter fi eld, being a solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation everywhere in space except the points Rj and decreasing at r \u2192 \u221e, is a superposition of the wave functions of single carbon atoms ( ) , , 1 r j N e c j j j r j j \uf06b \uf079 \uf02d \uf03d \uf03d \uf02d \uf0e5 \uf03d r r r R (1) Where \uf06b is the magnitude of the wave vector of the cluster.
