 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct research to develop and evaluate culturally adapted shared decision making interventions for use in Indigenous healthcare settings. This would build on findings that place impacts opportunities for shared decision making.

2. Examine the characteristics and competencies of healthcare providers that facilitate effective shared decision making with Indigenous patients. This would address the gap identified in reporting on provider characteristics.  

3. Investigate how community engagement and partnership models can be integrated into shared decision making interventions and care processes. This would build on the finding that community is an important partner.

4. Develop and test approaches to build trust and relationships between Indigenous patients/communities and healthcare providers as part of shared decision making interventions. This would address the theme of trust-building.

5. Conduct implementation research on how to effectively scale-up and spread shared decision making interventions that have been co-developed with Indigenous communities across healthcare systems. This would build on the examples of high quality Indigenous-oriented research.
