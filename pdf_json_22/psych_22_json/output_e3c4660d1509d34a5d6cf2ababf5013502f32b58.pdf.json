Deficits and delays in gestural communication are among the early deficits of ASD and also a major social modality in early caregiver-toddler interaction. Caregiver gestures have an important role in the cognitive and social development of children with ASD. Thus, it is urgent to further explore the role of caregiver gestures in early caregiver-toddler interaction. In this cross-sectional study, we observed the caregivers\u2019 gestures and responses of toddlers aged between 18 and 24 months during play (ASD = 44, TD = 29) and dining activities (ASD = 34, TD = 27). By observing the di erent frequencies and patterns of gestures by the caregiver-child interaction and the di erent proportions of children\u2019s responses to the caregiver\u2019s gestures, we found that, compared to caregivers of typically developing toddlers, caregivers of toddlers with ASD had fewer synchronized gestures and more unsynchronized gestures in the play activity and more supplementary gestures in dining activity. Toddlers with ASD produced more social responses to caregivers\u2019 synchronized gestures, whereas the use of synchronized gestures by the caregivers in caregiver-toddler interaction had a positive influence on social responses to toddlers with ASD. The findings suggest that e ective use of gestures by caregivers during caregiver-toddler activities can improve children\u2019s social responses.\nKEYWORDS\nautism spectrum disorder, caregiver-toddler interaction, caregiver\u2019s gesture, social response, synchronization\nIntroduction\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by social communication deficits and repetitive and restricted behaviors and is induced by the complex interaction between neural susceptibility and behavior (1). An toddlers\u2019 behavior is significantly influenced by the social environment, and because the primary early social environment predominantly comprises caregiver-toddler interaction (CTI),\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nCTI may have a significant effect on the onset and development of this disorder (2). In particular, caregiver gestures are an important social modality in CTI and have a positive influence on attracting toddlers\u2019 social attention and learning from social experiences, whereas toddlers\u2019 social responses influence caregiver gestures to produce adaptive changes, thus influencing CTI in both directions (3). Therefore, an in-depth exploration of the role of caregiver gestures in early childhood social experience may potentially contribute to the early guidance of ASD caregiver-toddler interventions.\nGestures are a stable source of visual information in social communication and provide a positive aid to the development of language comprehension, problem-solving, and subsequent learning skills in socially competent speakers or listeners (4). Different from young adults, gestures can serve as alternative channels of expression to compensate for the limitations of toddlers\u2019 language and reflect developmental changes in toddlers\u2019 cognitive processes. The gesture input toddlers receive from their caregivers has a ripple effect on their language and social development (3, 5). The use and effects of gestures by caregivers on toddlers with ASD have partially been reported in the past. Caregivers of toddlers with ASD use gestures with similar frequency as caregivers of typically developing (TD) toddlers (6, 7), and some studies have reported that caregivers of toddlers with ASD produce more gestures than caregivers of TD toddlers (3). Additionally, the types of gestures and their combinations with speech have been partially reported. During play activities, the frequency of gesture types (deictic, conventional, and representational gestures) and gesture-speech combinations were similar between caregivers of toddlers with ASD and TD (8, 9). Some studies have reported that mothers of toddlers at heightened risk for ASD use more directive gestures and fewer requesting gestures (10). Studies have also explored the effects of caregivers\u2019 gestures on toddlers with ASD language and social skills, including facilitation and prediction of language comprehension and expression (11\u201313), increasing toddlers\u2019 compliance and sharing during play (10).\nIn summary, the existing literature included investigations of the number of caregiver gestures and contribution of caregiver gestures to children\u2019s language development, but few studies have reported the effects of caregiver gestures on children\u2019s social responses and social participation in CTI. Further, previous studies have mainly reported on the characteristics and effects of mothers\u2019 gestures during play activities, but information on caregivers\u2019 gestures during different early family activities is lacking. As for TD children, parental behaviors can promote the development of children with ASD (14). Responsive parenting that follows the child\u2019s guidance and focus of attention predicts language and social gains in children with and without developmental risk (15). Additionally, responsive parenting styles predict the total time of child-initiated joint engagement, and children\u2019s social behaviors are associated with child-initiated engagement (16). Early\nquantity, diversity, and grammatical informativeness of verb input in follow-in utterances (i.e., utterances that map onto child attentional leads) are significantly associated with later child expressive verb vocabulary (17). Toddlers and toddlers diagnosed with ASD later often display hyporeactivity to sensory stimuli, which has also been associated with lower child communication abilities, but increased caregiver verbal responsiveness may attenuate this negative effect (18). In the context of spatial activities (puzzle play), caregivers use spatial language and gestures to improve their child\u2019s spatial skills, whereas parental spatial talk is related to the child\u2019s later spatial skills (19).\nPrevious studies on CTI have reported the effects of caregivers\u2019 behaviors on developmental abilities and disorder symptoms in children with ASD, whereas fewer articles have reported on the responses of children with ASD to their caregivers\u2019 behaviors during CTI. Choi et al. investigated gestures that caregivers used with 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old infants at high or low risk for ASD and reported that caregivers of three groups gestured in similar frequencies and proportions (8). However, there is a lack of specific analyses of toddlers\u2019 differential reciprocal social responses to caregivers\u2019 behaviors.\nSeveral studies have reported the positive effects of increased synchronization (responsiveness to the toddlers\u2019 interest and behavior) of CTI on children\u2019s social interaction. Caregivers of toddlers with ASD whose behaviors were more responsive to the toddler\u2019s ongoing interests and activities during early play interaction would accordingly result in toddlers who developed better joint attention and language (20, 21). At-risk toddlers with higher binary synchrony and toddler reactivity at 12 months achieved significantly higher receptive and expressive language (EL) scores at 36 months (22). The importance of interpersonal synchronization in ASD is supported by studies of motor, physiological, and neural synchrony. For example, reduced levels of repetitive behavior were previously reported in children who demonstrated increased hand motor coherence in hand clapping competitions with the experimenter (23). Additionally, reduced electrical skin, heart rate, and neural synchronizations were reported in binary interaction between ASD and caregivers (24, 25). However, there is a lack of studies on specific synchronous behaviors of caregivers, including synchronous non-verbal and verbal ones.\nIn summary, this study observed CTI in terms of caregiver gestures and children\u2019s specific responses to caregiver gestures. The following hypotheses were proposed in this study: 1. The frequency and use patterns of different gestures by caregiver of ASD differ, and synchronized gesture use by caregiver of ASD may be less; 2. toddlers with ASD may respond differently to caregiver gestures in different activities, and the use of different gesture types by caregivers during play or dining activities may cause toddlers to have different social responses; 3. The use of gestures in caregiver-toddler interaction by caregivers will influence toddlers to produce different social responses.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nWe observed two major caregiver-toddler activities in early childhood, including play activities and daily routines. Further, co-parenting is becoming a common phenomenon in China, and most toddlers and toddlers are raised by at least two caregivers (26). Based on the social context of early childhood in China, and in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the interaction between caregivers and young children, we compared the use of caregiver gestures and toddlers\u2019 responses\nto gestures between the TD and ASD groups by examining dyadic play and dining activities between 18- and 24-monthold toddlers and their two caregivers. Our study questions were as follows:\na. Do different types of gestures produce atypical usage\npatterns among caregivers of children with ASD in different caregiver-toddler activities, including different\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\ntypes of social functions, types of speech combination, and synchronized and unsynchronized gestures? b. Do atypical response patterns of children with ASD\nto caregiver gestures in different caregiver-toddler activities exist? c. Does a correlation between children with ASD\u2019s social\nresponse to caregiver gestures and caregiver gestures in dyadic interaction exist?"

A group of chronological age-matched TD children was recruited. The exclusion criteria included the following: serious neurological or physical conditions and diagnosis of Rett syndrome, cerebral palsy, or other congenital disorders. In addition, because toddlers are often shared by two caregivers, to achieve a complete picture of the toddler\u2019s early CTI, each child was required to have two caregivers, residing with the child continuously since birth. Since some of the enrolled families did not complete all the videos, we report information only for the families who completed the play and dining videos separately. Demographic information for the TD and ASD groups is provided in Table 1."

All activities were recorded on video for 7min. The first phase during the first min of the play/dining activities, known as the adaptation phase, allowed the toddlers to adapt to their surrounding environment, the caregiver\u2019s placement of them, and adjustment of shooting equipment time. No coding assessment was performed in this phase. Play activities were conducted in a 3 \u00d7 2 m2 carpeted game room. The room contained a set of toys, including a car, music box, pop-up toy, set of boxes, eight textured blocks, eight building blocks, and eight plastic snowflakes. At the start of each session, we instructed caregivers to select any three toys and then engage in a typical \u201cat-home\u201d play session.

The video-taker was instructed to capture the following: (a) the faces of the toddler and caregiver, (b) the hands of the toddler and caregiver, and (c) the toys/utensils used. Background noises (e.g., television, open window) were avoided as much as possible (Figure 1). Play activities were recorded by the researcher and dining activities were recorded by family members who were familiar with the children.\nPlay and dining activities were selected because of the following reasons: (1) the increasing number of interventions emphasizing the importance of natural situations (29, 30) and early dyadic social activities for toddlers mainly include games and daily routines, of which dining is one of the important and indispensable routines; (2) the two activities cover different patterns of CTI during this period (including differences in behavior and sensory stimulus input patterns on both sides of the interaction and dining activities) based on toddlers\u2019 physiological protection mechanisms and requirements for nutritional intake, involve fewer objects, and are usually caregiver-led, whereas play activities include\nmore child behavior patterns and sensory information input from different objects and are usually not caregiverled; and (3) consider achieving more specific guidance on caregiver gestures in the clinic, structured dining activities may be more helpful in guiding the use of gestures by the caregivers."

There were significant group differences in proportion of no-responses and gesture-related responses, indicating that toddlers with ASD had a significantly greater proportion of no-responses (play activity: t = 4.502, Bonferroni, p < 0.005, df = 71; dining activity: Z = \u22123.277, Bonferroni, p < 0.005, df = 59) and lower gesturerelated responses to caregiver gestures compared to TD toddlers (play activity: t =\u22126.122, Bonferroni, p< 0.005, df= 71; dining activity: t = \u22124.033, Bonferroni, p < 0.005, df = 59) (Figure 3). However, there were no significant differences in the proportion of non-gesture-related responses (play activity: Z =\u22121.809, p= 0.071, df = 71; dining activity: Z = \u22121.341, p = 0.180, df = 59) between the two groups. This suggests that toddlers in the ASD group were less responsive to caregiver gestures compared to TD toddlers when they were engaged in CTI.\nWe next examined whether the proportion of each gesturerelated response type (GAD, GGs, GL, GAs, GIs) differed between the two groups. Results indicated a significant difference in the proportion of GAD, GL, GA, and GI responses across the two groups, indicating that toddlers with ASD displayed significantly more GAD (Z=\u22123.861, Bonferroni, p < 0.005, df = 71) and fewer GL (Z = \u22122.982, p = 0.003, df = 71), GAs (Z = \u22123.079, p = 0.002, df = 71), and GIs (Z = \u22123.083, p = 0.002, df= 71) compared to TD toddlers during play activity. However, during dining activity, the ASD group produced significantly fewer GAs compared to the TD group (Z=\u22123.594, Bonferroni, p < 0.005, df = 59). This suggests that toddlers with ASD respond differently to caregiver gestures in different activities. Further, toddlers with ASDmainly showed attentional disengaging and gesture responses to caregiver gestures, whereas TD toddlers showed more language, action, and integrative responses than toddlers with ASD.\nRespose proportion to di erent frequencies of gesture use in activities\nThe above results suggested that toddlers with ASD may respond differently to synchronized and unsynchronized gestures from caregivers during play activities, and that TD toddlers may respond differently to supplementary gestures during dining activities.

Groupings were made according to the frequency of the two\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 09 frontiersin.org\ncaregivers\u2019 gestures used to explore the differences in toddlers\u2019 social responses to caregiver gestures during two activities in both the ASD and TD groups. Based on the 50th percentile of use of gestures by the two caregivers, two caregivers and toddler in the same activity into group I (nsynchronized = 43, nunsynchronized = 39, nsupplementary = 25) and group II (nsynchronized = 45, nunsynchronized = 49, nsupplementary = 43). Toddlers with ASD produced a significantly greater proportion of GGs (Z = \u22122.879, p = 0.004, df = 86), GAs (Z = \u22122.856, p = 0.004, df = 86), and GIs (Z = \u22123.947, Bonferroni, p < 0.005, df = 86) in synchronized gestures group I than those in group II during play activity, whereas the unsynchronized gestures in group I had significantly more NGGs (Z=\u22123.634, p< 0.005, df = 86) and NGAs (Z=\u22122.869, p= 0.004, df= 86) than group II. In dining activities, TD toddlers in supplementary gesture group I had significantly more GIs (Z = \u22122.973, p = 0.003, df = 66) than group II (Figure 4).\nOverall, caregivers of toddlers with ASD who used synchronized gestures during play activities produced more gesture-related responses (GGs, GAs, GIs) and increased non-gesture-related responses (NGGs, NGAs) with unsynchronized gestures. In addition, caregivers of TD toddlers produced more GIs using supplementary gestures during dining activities.\nCorrelation between toddler response and caregiver gesture\nWe combined the differences in caregiver gestures and toddler responses to caregiver gestures between the two groups. To examine the relationship between caregiver gestures and toddler responses during CTI, synchronized and asynchronized gestures of the caregivers during play activities were entered into a series of three regression models predicting toddlers\u2019 social responses in CTI. The caregivers\u2019 synchronized gestures were entered into a series of three regression models predicting toddler\u2019s no-response in play activities. Model 1 included demographic information parameters (toddler\u2019s age, sex). Model 2 included toddler parameters (non-verbal score, verbal score, and ADOS CSS). The final model 3 included caregiver synchronized gestures. Compared to models 1 and 2, model 3 (the addition of caregiver synchronized gestures: \u03b2 = \u22120.708, t = \u22122.505, p = 0.015, df = 1) accounted for a significantly greater portion of toddlers\u2019 no-response variance (R2 change = 0.034, F change = 6.277, p = 0.015, df = 71, Figure 5). Similar to no-response, model 3 applied to the GA and GI responses in play activities did not reveal significance with synchronized gestures (p> 0.015). The results of the regressions indicated that caregiver synchronized gestures predicted no-response of ASD during play activity."

            "text": "We examined the characteristics of caregiver gestures and toddlers\u2019 responses to caregiver gestures in early family environments and the relationship between caregiver gestures and toddlers\u2019 social responses. Our results indicate that caregivers of toddlers with ASD used different types of gestures in different activities, whereas children with ASD had different types of responses to caregivers in both activities. In addition, caregivers used synchronized gestures during play and supplementary gestures during dining, which increased the gesture-related responses exhibited by toddlers with ASD. Finally, for ASD CTI, synchronized gestures by the playful caregiver effectively predicted toddlers\u2019 social responses. We discuss possible explanations for the pattern of caregiver gesture use as a key behavior in early CTI.\nFirst, we observed that the overall frequency of gesture use was similar between the two groups, consistent with previous studies that reported ASD and TD caregivers use a similar number of gestures (11, 39). We also observed that caregivers of toddlers with ASD used fewer synchronized gestures and more unsynchronized gestures during play activities and more supplementary gestures during dining activities. This extends previous evidence on caregiver gesture types into a new domain, as previous reports on caregiver gestures were recorded only in play settings and mostly involved gesture patterns (7, 8). In this study, multi-scenario and different gesture type reports were relevant. We observed that the use of unsynchronized gestures by caregivers of toddlers with ASD in games was mostly used to instruct toddlers to pay attention to and recognize novel items. Relatively consistent with this result is a study on parenting instructional styles, which reported that in situations where toddlers have fewer functional games and behaviors, caregivers of toddlers with ASD dominate more interaction and do not make the dyad more mutual (40, 41). Therefore, the use of unsynchronized gestures in caregivers of toddlers with ASDmay not be beneficial.\nSupplementary gestures during dining are mostly used to further add clarification to toddlers\u2019 concerns and are a more complex pattern of gesture-speech combinations than reinforcing and disambiguating gestures. Most studies report no group differences in the number of gesture-verbal combinations provided to toddlers by their caregivers during play activities (7, 13). In contrast, this study\u2019s reporting of supplementary gestures in everyday situations (dining activities) may reveal caregivers\u2019 verbal fine-tuning, according to their toddlers\u2019 communicative needs in different situations. The present findings revealed group differences in caregiver gestures across contexts that may reflect the specific effects of caregiver gestures on early CTI.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org\nSecond, in gesture-related responses, ASD is associated with more attentional disengaging and less language, actions, and integrative responses, reflecting a marked lag in the development of social skills for this age group (28, 42). Although different from previous assessments of children\u2019s competence development, observations of children\u2019s responses to caregiver gestures may serve as a way to gain initial insight into the early social skill levels of children with ASD.\nThird, although the poor response to gestures by toddlers with ASD is associated with a lack of interest in social stimuli (43, 44), our study provides evidence for the possibility of increasing social responses in ASD through effective use of caregiver gestures. In the context of low CTI response in the early stages of ASD (41, 45), we observed that the use of synchronized gestures by the caregiver increased gesturerelated responses in toddlers with ASD, whereas unsynchronized gestures increased gesture-unrelated responses, suggesting that using synchronized gestures may be a key behavior in promoting toddlers\u2019 engagement in CTI. We also observed that caregivers of toddlers with ASD use synchronized gestures mostly to indicate and demonstrate to toddlers how to manipulate objects during play and to respond to toddlers\u2019 needs in a timely manner. This suggests that carefully following toddlers\u2019 interests during CTI and responding to their communication behaviors in a timely manner are effective ways to provide synchronized gestures to toddlers with ASD. Evidence related to this result included a report on synchronous behaviors of parenting to promote joint attention and engagement in ASD that indicated that parental responses to toddlers\u2019 attention and activities during play was positive for toddler initiations with caregiver and for caregiver-toddler shared attention (21, 46). Therefore, the study of synchronized gestures provides specific ways for caregivers to increase synchronous behavior in children.\nFinally, by examining basic toddler information developmental and symptom levels, we observed that synchronized caregiver gestures were associated with no response in interaction with ASD, suggesting that more synchronized gestures by the caregiver may be associated with reduced non-responsiveness from children.\nAlthough previous studies have addressed the effects of synchronous caregiver behavior on children\u2019s developmental abilities and disorder symptoms (25, 47), our study provides further preliminary scientific evidence for the use and positive effects of caregiver synchronized gestures in natural family settings."

Also, although there were no significant differences between the two groups of children\u2019s non-verbal abilities in this study, 18\u201324 months of age is an important stage in children\u2019s ability development, and the impact of changes in the developmental characteristics of children\u2019s abilities, both verbal and non-verbal (gestures), on caregiver-toddlers interaction and children\u2019s social behavior during this stage was not considered in this study. Further, due to sample size limitations and the language ability differences among the two groups, the current study cannot exclude that children\u2019s social responses in CTI are a manifestation of early competence developmental limitations. Thus, the effect of caregiver gestures on children\u2019s social responses in early childhood needs to be further illustrated by a prospective cohort design. Finally, the current results are aimed at CTI with young children and cannot be extended to older children and other contexts."

Coaching caregivers on how to use gestures more effectively can promote joint participation in CTI for children with ASD. Thus, the relationship between caregiver gestures and children\u2019s responses in early CTI warrants further studies, as it may be a moderator of children\u2019s social development and intervention effects."
