    "abstractText": "Observing processes of nanoscale materials of low atomic number is possible using liquid phase electron microscopy (LP-EM). However, the achievable spatial resolution (d) is limited by radiation damage. Here, we examine a strategy for optimizing LP-EM experiments based on an analytical model and experimental measurements, and develop a method for quantifying image quality at ultra low electron dose De using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). As experimental test case we study the formation of a colloidal binary system containing 30 nm diameter SiO2 nanoparticles (SiONPs), and 100 nm diameter polystyrene microspheres (PMs). We show that annular dark field (DF) STEM is preferred over bright field (BF) STEM for practical reasons. Precise knowledge of the material\u2019s density is crucial for the calculations in order to match experimental data. To calculate the detectability of nano-objects in an image, the Rose criterion for single pixels is expanded to a model of the signal to noise ratio obtained for multiple pixels spanning the image of an object. Using optimized settings, it is possible to visualize the radiation-sensitive, hierarchical low-Z binary structures, and identify both components.",

However, the achievable spatial resolution (d) is limited by radiation damage. Here, we examine a strategy for optimizing LP-EM experiments based on an analytical model and experimental measurements, and develop a method for quantifying image quality at ultra low electron dose De using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). As experimental test case we study the formation of a colloidal binary system containing 30 nm diameter SiO2 nanoparticles (SiONPs), and 100 nm diameter polystyrene microspheres (PMs). We show that annular dark field (DF) STEM is preferred over bright field (BF) STEM for practical reasons. Precise knowledge of the material\u2019s density is crucial for the calculations in order to match experimental data. To calculate the detectability of nano-objects in an image, the Rose criterion for single pixels is expanded to a model of the signal to noise ratio obtained for multiple pixels spanning the image of an object. Using optimized settings, it is possible to visualize the radiation-sensitive, hierarchical low-Z binary structures, and identify both components."

            "text": "LP-EM [1\u20133] is capable of studying dynamic processes involving nano-scale objects such as nanoparticles (NPs) in a liquid layer of up to a few micrometers thickness. Since the first reported experiments [4], a common observation is that the Brownian-type motion of NPs blurs their appearance in LP-EM images [5] and sometimes causes them to move exceptionally slowly in a net direction [6]. Provided that contrast is sufficient, it is possible to analyze the dynamics of NPs with LP-EM to gain an insight into the forces affecting their behavior in a liquid environment [7\u20139]. NPs consisting of high atomic number materials such as Au, Pt, and Ti provide good contrast and have been used for LP-EM imaging with high resolution both in lateral and temporal terms [10\u201312]. For studies of soft matter containing low atomic number (Z) materials, the capabilities of dynamical LP-EM are limited due to contrast and radiation damage issues; this limits the spatial and temporal resolution when imaging, for example, colloidal suspensions [12\u201316]. Many examples exist of damage induced by the electron beam [17] as well as fading contrast of organic specimens [18]. In addition, artifacts have been reported to occur, such as metallic deposition [19] in\nthe liquid cell, and the formation of globular, dendritic, and other types of structures in the solution due to the reduction of metallic ions [20]. Beam-induced formation of gas bubbles [21] may result in drastic changes in intensity and morphology due to the change in the sample thickness [22] and capillary forces, respectively. A typical observation is that the extent of beam-induced damage scales with the electron fluence (De), often termed as cumulative electron dose or just electron dose. It is defined as the number of electrons interacting with the observed section of the sample during an experiment. De affects both the quality of data and the structure of the observed object and is the key parameters for setting a balance for image contrast and electron beam damage when designing an experiment. Finally, the motion of nano-objects during exposure results in motion blur and can affect both the intensity and morphology observed in the final image. Therefore, the beam sensitivity of the sample components needs to be assessed in terms of structural damage, and motion blur.\nHere, we examine a strategy for optimizing and measuring the performance of LP-EM in studying dynamic processes involving low-Z soft matter. As a case example, we visualize the structure and formation of colloidal binary particles [23] relevant for self-assembled hierarchical\n* Corresponding author at: INM- Leibniz Institute for New Materials, Saarbr\u00fccken 66123, Germany.

The model system studied consists of positively charged, amino-functionalized, 30 nm-diameter, amorphous SiONPs, and negatively charged, 100 nm-diameter PMs. In buffers of low pH, they have been shown to organize into hierarchical binary structures where the SiONPs formed a shell around the PM [23].\nBoth polystyrene and SiO2 are known to be rapidly affected by radiation damage [26,27] and it is necessary to define an acceptable De for the specific experimental conditions used in this work. To assess the acceptable De for imaging binary structures, the beam sensitivity of both components (SiONP and PM) will be determined by imaging the structure under increasing De, and then whole assemblies will be imaged under conditions compatible with both components\nTo minimize beam damage, the electron microscopy settings for image acquisition need to be optimized to maximize the amount of information per electron [28]. Theoretical calculations based on an analytical model of the resolution in LP-EM using STEM detection [29] are applied to examine what the optimal experimental parameters are for the aforementioned low-Z colloidal assemblies. Relevant experimental parameters studied are De, t of the liquid, detector opening angle (\u03b2), and blurring caused by the movement of the particles during the image acquisition. We also investigate the reliability of the theoretical predictions of image quality by testing the sensitivity of the calculations to changes in key experimental parameters including the material\u2019s density (\u03c1), and comparing calculated values with experimental data for practical imaging conditions. To quantitatively determine image quality in the noisy electron microscopic data, a method for image analysis was developed measuring visibility and experimental resolution of the NPs.\nFinally, we test the possibility to directly visualize the hierarchical colloidal assemblies in dynamic conditions before radiation damage takes place."

The total solid content of the suspension was reported by manufacturer to be 10%, containing 0.1% sodium azide functioning as a preservative and surfactant. Before use, the PM solution was diluted to a volume ratio of 1:100 with PBS buffer of pH 2 and shaken.\nAs outlined by Yokoi et al., silica NPs were synthesized by dissolving 0.01 g of L-Lysine (Fluka, Germany) in 100 mL of distilled water and stirred with a speed of 270 rounds per minute (RPM) under reflux at 60\u25e6C [30]. To start the reaction, 6 mL of Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) (VWR, US) was added and the mixture was left to react for 24 h at 60\u25e6C. Assuming all the TEOS reacted, the final concentration yield was 16.1 g l\u2212 1 for silica NPs. Averaging the diameters of 10 characterized SiONPs yielded 24 \u00b1 3 nm, as measured manually from an image acquired after immobilizing the NPs on a SiNx-membrane after which a STEM image was acquired at a nominal magnification of 400,000 \u00d7 .\nThe surface of silica NPs was amino-functionalized based on a protocol described elsewhere [31]. Functionalization was accomplished with a 1:100 weight ratio of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) to the original amount of silica precursor (TEOS) used in the synthesis. The APTES was diluted to 4% (V/V) with tetrahydrofuran (THF), after which the desired amount was pipetted into a stirring sample of silica dispersion, which continued for 30 min. The SiONP suspension was diluted to a 1:5 volume ratio with PBS pH 2 and shaken before use.\nThe \u03b6-potential of 1:5 diluted SiONP was determined at pH values of 2, 7, and 12 and fixed ionic strength of 0.064 M. The measurement was taken with Malvern Zetasizer instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd, UK), and three measurements were conducted on each sample. Average measured \u03b6-potential values were 13 mV, -21 mV, and -38 mV for pH 2, 7, and 12, respectively.\nTo prepare pre-assembled binary structures ex-situ in bulk solution, 0.16 mL of SiONP suspension and 0.02 mL PM suspension (diluted 1:5 with HPLC-grade water) were added into 0.4 mL of 0.1 M KCL-HCL buffer of pH 1.6. The buffer was prepared by mixing 50 mL of 0.1 M KCl and 13 mL of 0.1 M HCL, resulting in a final pH of 1.6."

[29]. Mathematical equation-solving software (MATLAB, MathWorks, USA) see SI, Section 2.1 for the Matlab code) was used to calculate the numerical value of d, as has been done earlier for carbon and gold [29]. In short, the scattering properties of the sample components were obtained by calculating their average electron scattering cross section \u03c3(\u03b8) and the mean-free path length (l) for 200 keV electron energy (E). Physical parameters and microscopic parameters required for this calculation are reported in Matlab code section \u201cSample parameters\u201d (SI, Section 2.1). The inelastic scattering component was included in the calculation of \u03c3(\u03b8) so that:\n\u03c3(\u03b8) = \u03c3el(\u03b8) + \u03c3in(\u03b8), (1)\nwhere \u03c3el(\u03b8) and \u03c3in(\u03b8) are the elastic and inelastic scattering crosssections, respectively. In the case where only elastic scattering from the specimen was considered, the \u03c3in(\u03b8) was set equal to zero.\nTo calculate the effective size of the electron probe that contained 50% of the incident electrons, first the diffraction-limited diameter of the electron probe (d50) was calculated. The convergence semi-angle for the electron beam (\u03b1p) was adjusted along with the detector\u2019s opening semi-angle (\u03b2). For DF-STEM, \u03b1p = 8 mrad if \u03b2 > 8 mrad, and \u03b1p = \u03b2/2 when \u03b2 \u2264 8 mrad. For BF-STEM, \u03b1p = 8 mrad when \u03b2 < 8 mrad and \u03b1p = \u03b2 when \u03b2 \u2264 8 mrad. Secondly, the probe broadening (dblur) due to the scattering in the sample was obtained. Finally, to obtain the signal-tonoise limited resolution (dSNR) for BF- and DF-STEM, the number of electrons hitting the detector at different sample locations was calculated.\nFor example, in the case of BF-STEM, the number of transmitted electrons at a position of water (Mbkg), and a nano-object (Msignal) was calculated using Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively.\nMbkg = N0 e \u2212 tlH2O \u2212 2 tSiN lSiN (2)\nMsignal = N0e d\u2212 t lH2O \u2212 2 tSiN lSiN \u2212 dl0 , (3)\nwhere lH2O, lSiN, and lo are the mean-free path lengths for water, SiNxmembrane, and the nano-object, respectively. No is the number of incident electrons and d is the effective diameter of the spherical nanoobject. The SNR at the location of the nano-object is obtained by:\nSNR = Msignal \u2212 Mbkg\n\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 Mbkg\n\u221a > 3 (4)\nP.

(2)\u2013(5) were solved numerically for dSNR by using the vpasolve function in MATLAB. For polystyrene, the numerically solved value of dsnr was found to be negative for \u03b2 \u2a86 10 mrad. For these values, | dsnr | was plotted instead. We suspected that the negative value was due to the inversion of the contrast between the nano-object and the liquid background. This was confirmed for DF-STEM by separately calculating the Msignal and Mbkg and using the numerically solved value of dSNR as the diameter of the polystyrene nano-object. The result indicates that indeed the ratio Msignal /Mbkg became < 1 at \u03b2 = 11 mrad and therefore explains why the numerical solution of dSNR is negative for values \u03b2 \u2a86 10 mrad.\nFinally, to obtain value for d, resolution-limiting terms were summed in quadrature [32]:\nd = \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\n(2d50)2 + d2SNR + d 2 blur\n\u221a\n(6)"

After blotting the vacuum side of the microchip, a small droplet of water resided on the area where the drop of PM had resided, and the liquid cell was assembled and sealed immediately to prevent the PMs from drying. To experimentally test LP-EM of PM, a sample was prepared to contain PM immobilized on the top SiN window of the liquid cell, such as to achieve the highest possible d in STEM mode.\nFor the PM sample, the presence of the nanoparticles was verified from a STEM overview image (data not shown). The thickness of the non-filled liquid cell was then measured using EELS. A line scan was acquired of a length of 8.1 \u00b5m from the edge of the window in a region with water and single PM particles. The measured t/lin did not increase towards the center of the window as is typically the case for a completely filled liquid cell [34]. The average t/lin amounted to 1.21 +/- 0.02 for 79 data points, corresponding to t = 83 \u00b1 3 nm accounting for two SiN windows (Eq. (8)). It is likely that the liquid cell was only partly filled or affected by the Laplace pressure resisting the outward bulging of the membranes due to the residual water film at the hydrophilic SiN window [35]. A series of 50 DF-STEM images at De = 0.46 \u00b1 0.05 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 per image (resulting in a total of De = 23 \u00b1 2 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2) allowed us to determine the radiation limit in De for a very thin liquid layer.\nTo examine the acceptable De for LP-EM of PM in thicker liquids, we connected the liquid cell to a liquid flow via a syringe pump and inject PBS of pH 2 into the area of the SiN window. This was done at a different sample position than for Fig. 3a. The average t across the field of view was measured with EELS as t/lin = 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 for 36 data points which is equivalent to 0.63 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m of water, somewhat thicker than at the edge due to window bulging. A stack of 27 images was acquired at De = 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2, with De at the very limit of detection, so that the cumulative De amounted to 51 \u00b1 5 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2.\nWe also tested if the PM structure changes when the cell was filled with an ambient atmosphere by studying an air-dried PM sample in a sealed liquid cell. The air-dried sample showed a thin water layer of t = 8 \u00b1 1 nm as concluded from EELS (t/\u03bb = 0.78 \u00b1 0.1). For this scenario, a sequence of 80 images acquired at an unexposed region results in a total De = 37.1 \u00b1 0.4 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 when using l = 3.3 nm and \u03c4 = 1 \u00b5s.

            "text": "For LP-EM of samples sensitive to radiation damage, it is crucial to optimize the experimental parameters for an optimal balance between d as low as possible, De below the limit of radiation damage, and t sufficiently large to enclose the sample and allow liquid flow. To aid optimization, we use analytical equations [29] to evaluate the influence of the above parameters for liquid-phase STEM of NPs of amorphous silicon dioxide and polystyrene. It is assumed that the NPs are immobilized on the upper liquid enclosing window with respect to a downward electron beam, and that the NPs are imaged in focus. Fig. 1a and b show d for polystyrene in BF- and DF-STEM, respectively.\nBF imaging is advantageous at low De while BF and DF perform approximately the same way at the tested values of De. In both cases, the curve of d shows two minima, which is due to the inversion of contrast when decreasing \u03b2. Fig. 1c and d show the results for silica. Here, BF- and DF-STEM perform almost the same at their respective optimal \u03b2, and contrast reversal is not observed.\nFor polystyrene the best theoretical resolution is obtained with DFSTEM and for silica with BF-STEM. From a practical point of view, however, the differences between results obtained with DF and BF are small for optimal \u03b2. For example, when comparing attainable resolution between DF and BF for t = 300 nm and De = 10 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2, the differences in d are 0.7% and 11% for polystyrene and silica, respectively.\nHowever, for \u03b2 above its optimal value, DF-STEM is less sensitive to variation of \u03b2 (Fig. 1b and d) than BF-STEM, and thus DF-STEM is less sensitive to the exact setting of \u03b2 (Fig. 1a and c). Therefore, experimentally DF-STEM is preferred here over BF-STEM. For De = 10 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2, it can be expected that the used NPs are visible in the images, i.e. the respective values of d for PM and SiONP are each a factor of two better than needed to detect the NPs used in the experiment, which have diameters of 109 and 24 nm, respectively.\nThe difference in the performance of DF-STEM and BF-STEM arises from the fact that in DF-STEM, the total number of electrons landing on the detector is greater which, according to Poisson statistics, leads to higher standard deviation (nominator in Eq. (5)) and thus lower SNR and worse achievable resolution.\nThe above calculations depend on the exact knowledge of several experimental parameters. However, there is always a certain degree of uncertainty related to the experimental parameters leading to different values of d. To double-check the validity of the calculations regarding the experiment, d is evaluated in relation to those experimental parameters that exhibit the largest degree of uncertainty. The first source of uncertainty in the calculated d originates from the accuracy of 10% in determining De. But this inaccuracy is negligible compared to two other factors (Fig. 2). Due to the bulging of the liquid-enclosing windows and measurement inaccuracy, t may be known in an experiment with an accuracy of a factor of two only. Yet, for our experimental setting of t = 300 nm, t only exerts a moderate effect on d when an optimal \u03b2 is used. Note that while an effective reduction of t would be achieved by using graphene sheets instead of silicon nitride windows to enclose the liquid [38,39], the gain would not be large for this range of t and d. Finally, we evaluate the uncertainty related to the density of the amorphous silica (\u03c1SiO2) [40]. Here, the value of \u03c1SiO2 = 1640 kg/m3 is used, which was obtained using analytical centrifugation of another silica NP batch synthesized with the same parameters [40]. However, depending on the synthesis method, size, and degree of crystallinity, \u03c1SiO2 is in the range of 1370\u20132650 kg/m3, and this uncertainty in \u03c1SiO2 in turn has a major influence on De (Fig. 1a), much more so than varying t and De. In the worst-case scenario, the calculated d is off by 50% but this is still sufficient to optimize the experiment. For example, the trend as a function of \u03b2 is present regardless a shift in \u03c1SiO2.\nP. Kunnas et al.\nUltramicroscopy 240 (2022) 113596"

In particular, PM is expected to be sensitive to electron beam irradiation and we set out to study the effect of the electron beam on the appearance of the PM\nmonolayer during the acquisition of a low dose image series in varying liquid thicknesses at t = 0.008, 0.084, and 0.65 \u00b5m. Fig. 3a. offers a qualitative observation of the beam-induced damage where PM monolayer was pre-irradiated with De of 41.8 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 at t = 84 nm. The electron beam resulted in the removal of PMs in the pre-irradiated area as shown in the lower part of the panel a. In addition, At the edge of the irradiated area, smaller and fainter visible PM indicates partial removal of the NP\nP. Kunnas et al.\nUltramicroscopy 240 (2022) 113596\nstructure. The latter observation shows that PM does not disappear as a whole but disintegrates while still attached to the liquid-solid interface, i.e. degradation of the material occurs.\nBecause structural degradation of PM would affect any measurement, it is important to determine the relationship between De and the size of the PM. This is achieved by analyzing both the image series in a thin liquid and the one in a thicker liquid (Fig. 3a and b). The PM diameter is measured in the individual images obtained for the thin liquid cell (Fig. 4a) from the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of a line over the NP location. The diameters of the NPs are automatically measured in a procedure involving detection, segmentation, and measuring projected areas (SI, Section 3.1). For the data in thicker liquid, this is impossible due to the low inherent contrast of PM, resulting in noisy data. Hence, the size distribution obtained from several PMs is evaluated as a function of De in order to increase the accuracy of the analysis. Secondly, the SNR of the data is improved by computing running averages of five consecutive frames in an image stack, resulting in an effective De of 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 per frame. This averaging procedure results in a reasonable trade-off between SNR and the number of remaining data points. These data are filtered using a bandpass filter. As shown in Fig. 3c, the bandpass filtering improves the visibility of the PMs\u0301 outline. Finally, the nanoparticles are automatically detected and segmented (Fig. 3d).\nIn Fig. 3e, the determined size distribution of PMs in liquid of t = 0.63 \u00b5m is plotted for different values of De. It can be seen that the average diameter of the particles decreases, indicating structural degradation due to electron irradiation. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the datasets of De = 9.3 \u00b1 1 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 and De = 27.9 \u00b1 3 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 indeed reveals a statistically significant change in the analyzed population of 160 PMs. No significant change is observed between De = 9.3 \u00b1 1 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 and De = 18.6 \u00b1 2 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2. This result indicates that significantly detectable electron beam damage takes place above the critical threshold of De = 18.6 \u00b1 2 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2.\nThe result of this air versus liquid comparison is shown in Fig. 3f, where the measured average PM diameter under three different experimental conditions is plotted as a function of De. Structural degradation of PMs is faster in liquid than in the air atmosphere. Moreover, the degradation is more rapid in t = 0.083 \u00b5m than in t = 0.63 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m. The information provided in Fig. 3f can be used to estimate the degradation-induced change in the diameter of the PM for a given dose history and experimental setting. For example, in the case of t = 0.63 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m, De = 37.2 \u00b1 4 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 leads to a 10% reduction of the average diameter of the PM compared to the first image."

Fig. 4d shows a sample containing an immobilized monolayer of SiONP on the upper window. A total of ten STEM images are acquired using De = 4.6 \u00b1 0.5 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 per image. The first image of the series is shown in Fig. 4c, revealing individual SiONPs. Due to the continuous operation of the scanning unit, the total irradiation of the sample is higher than 23 \u00b1 2 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 as only every second frame is recorded in continuous acquisition mode. Based on the elapsed time between the captured frames (10.48 s) and the set flyback time (10 ms), the total De experienced by the sample is calculated to be a factor of two higher. Images are manually aligned and averaged cumulatively to obtain an image stack in which each consecutive frame is acquired with a higher De. During image acquisition, no movement or changes in the intensity are observed.\nP. Kunnas et al.\nUltramicroscopy 240 (2022) 113596\nA common way to analyze image quality is by measuring the SNR. de Jonge et al. used a method based on a line scan to assess the signal intensity at a nanoparticle compared to the background intensity and noise level [41]. Fig. 4b and e show line scans over a selected PM and SiONP, respectively, from which the FWHM can be measured as well as the SNR. However, this method has a disadvantage because the SNR obtained in this way depends on the pixel size and exact location of the line scan. Moreover, the low SNR leads to inaccuracy in the measurement of the FWHM. We describe a new approach based on probing the signal at the nanoparticle as well as the background independent of pixel size.\nThe key question here is how the SNR can be used to quantitatively determine the visibility of a multi-pixel object in order to evaluate the experimental resolution independent of the pixel size used. Images are two-dimensional (2D) arrays of pixels, where each pixel represents the strength of the signal on a lateral scale. It is useful to distinguish between the case of a single-pixel object and a multiple-pixel object, also termed lesion [42]. For a single-pixel object, the signal SO is surrounded by a noisy background of mean intensity of SB. The SNR is given by:\nSNRO = SO \u2212 SB\n\u03c3B , (9)\nwith \u03c3B the standard deviation of the background signal. The average SNR of a pixel in a lesion consisting of n pixels is:\nSNRL = SL \u2212 SB \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \u03c32L + \u03c32B \u221a (10)\nIn the case of a background level comparable to the signal level, which is typically the case in LP-EM, it can be assumed that \u03c3L = \u03c3B, so that:\nSNRL = SL \u2212 SB \u03c3B \u0305\u0305\u0305 2 \u221a (11)\nIn order to measure SL directly from the image data, we define circular regions of interest (ROI) with a diameter equal to the FWHM determined above (Fig. 4a and d). SB, and \u03c3B are measured from areas where no particles are present and that represent approximately the same t as where the SL is measured (Fig. 4a and d).\nThe Rose criterion [43] states that for a single pixel object to be visible from the background, its minimum SNR should be 3\u20135. For a lesion to be visible, the average SNRL can be smaller; this is because the statistical chance to observe a number of adjacent pixels with a slightly different signal than the background makes the lesion observable, even though for an single-pixel object the same SNR would be insufficient to recognize it. So, we define an effective SNR that expresses the visibility of a multi-pixel object:\nSNR\u2217L = SL \u2212 SB \u03c3B \u0305\u0305\u0305 2 \u221a (12)\nTo derive the relation between SNR\u2217L and SNRL, a binning operation is used to transform the multi-pixel object into a single-pixel object as described in the following. During the operation, SL and SB stay constant, but \u03c3B decreases as we average over n pixels. This becomes clear from looking at the variance, which is the square of the standard deviation:\nVar(SB) = \u03c32B (13)\nDuring the binning operation, the mean-variance of SB becomes:\nVar(SB)mean = Var ( 1 n \u2211n\ni=1 SB,i\n)\n(14)\nP. Kunnas et al.\nUltramicroscopy 240 (2022) 113596\nIf it is assumed that each SB,i is a truly random variable (random noise) such that the covariance of any two pixels is zero, and the variance between each pixel is equal (Bienayme\u0301-formula), the following holds: \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\nVar (SB)mean = \u0305\u0305\u0305 1 n \u221a Var(SB)\n\u221a\n, (15)\nwhich yields:\n\u03c3B = 1\u0305 \u0305\u0305 n \u221a \u03c3B (16)\nSubstitution into Eq. (12) yields:\nSNR\u2217L = SL \u2212 SB \u03c3B \u0305\u0305\u0305 2 \u221a \u0305\u0305\u0305 n \u221a = SNRL \u0305\u0305\u0305 n \u221a (17)\nIn terms of visibility of a single object according to the Rose criterion:\nSNR\u2217L \u2265 3 (18)\nWe analyze the experimental data using this new method to determine SNR*L. The data of the first frame was corrupted and therefore excluded from calculations. In the case of PMs, the area of the signal is specified by placing 60 nm-diameter, spherical ROIs in the middle of PMs that reside 2.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5m from the edge of the window, where t = 0.63 \u00b5m. This measurement is repeated for 14 PMs. To measure the local\nintensity and standard deviation of the background for each PM, we also place 14, 60 nm-diameter ROIs just outside of the particles and calculate the corresponding SNR for each PM. This allows us to determine the average SNR for N = 14 particles for the entire image series as a function of De was obtained (Fig. 4c). The experimental result can be used for comparison with other experiments using different microscope settings since the SNR is independent of pixel size (and magnification). Fig. 4c also includes the numerically calculated SNR (Eq. (4)) for comparison. As can be seen, the negative contrast is correctly predicted by the analytical model.\nTo measure the average SNR of SiONPs, 24 particles are selected at a distance of 0.95 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5m from the edge of the window, which corresponds to a t of 0.35 \u00b5m. For the analysis of the SNR, we define spherical ROIs with a 15 nm diameter centered on each selected particle (Fig. 4d). To measure the average intensity of the standard deviation of the background signal, an 880 \u00d7 90 nm2 rectangular ROI is created with an area of 0.079 \u00b5m2. The average SNR value for SiONPs in 350 nm of liquid is calculated according to Eq. (9). Fig. 4f shows the obtained experimental SNR versus De and the comparison with the calculated values.\nFinally, to estimate the minimum De required to successfully distinguish a PM or SiONP in these experimental conditions, the value of SNRL* was calculated using Eq. (17) and setting N = 316 (PMs) or N = 21 (SiONPs) corresponding to the number of analyzed pixels within the 60 nm and 15 nm ROIs, respectively. These values are indicated by the right y-axes in Fig. 4c and f. For PM, approximately 2.5 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 is required to distinguish a single particle, while for SiONP, a dose of 5 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 is\nP. Kunnas et al.\nUltramicroscopy 240 (2022) 113596\nneeded. Here, excellent agreement between experiment and theory is obtained as is shown in Fig. 4c and f. This approach can thus be used to predict LP-EM image quality for low-Z materials at low De, as needed to optimize experimental parameters."

            "text": "With optimized experimental settings, we set out to resolve the structural detail of self-organized binary structures in STEM mode. These structures are synthesized by mixing PMs and SiONPs before measurements. A typical overview image of the sample is shown in Fig. 5a, where structures of varying contrast are visible. Lower-contrast structures often disappear from the field of view upon prolonged electron beam irradiation; some of these structures are highlighted in Fig. 5a. The dynamics of one such structure is captured by recording a sequence of 32 frames with De = 0.46 \u00b1 0.05 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 per frame and a frame rate of 1.66 frames per second. This recording results in a video where binary particles initially rotate and then suddenly disappear from the field of view, leaving behind a few SiONPs attached to the liquidsolid interface. The behavior of these binary structures in the liquid is shown in Fig. 5b, where three STEM frames from the video are shown at time points 1.2, 18, and 36 s. High-contrast structures typically remain stationary upon electron beam irradiation. After the LP-EM experiment, the cell is opened, and both windows are inspected using SEM. On the\nbottom window, particles are found on both sides, indicating that the bright structures in Fig. 5a are dried deposits of binary suspension leaking to this side of the window during loading.\nFinally, in Fig. 5c, eight first frames of the video are manually aligned and averaged, resulting in De of 4 \u00b1 0.4 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2. The image reveals the raspberry-type structure, while some of the binary particles are slightly blurred because of their movement. Based on the analysis of three videos taken at different locations of the same sample, we found that on average 50% of the binary particles (N=50) have detached from the SiNmembrane at De=10 \u00b1 5 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2. These results highlight that it is feasible to observe a dynamic process occurring in this soft-matter structure below the threshold De for radiation damage while the motion of nanoobjects might become the resolution-limiting factor."

            "text": "Since LP-EM experiments are notoriously difficult to conduct and time-consuming, it is beneficial to limit the number of experiments by first analyzing relevant parameters in silico. The spatial resolution can be improved for fixed De by optimizing \u03b2 to obtain the maximum possible contrast. Optimization of \u03b2 is of particular importance for BF detection in STEM, while it is sufficient for DF-STEM to set \u03b2 above a certain minimum value due to the flat shape of the dmin vs \u03b2 curve. As the resolution is critically sensitive to the density of the nano-object, precise\nP. Kunnas et al.\nUltramicroscopy 240 (2022) 113596\ncalculations require its value to be determined within a small error margin, which is not always possible in practice. This issue needs to be considered when comparing experimental data with calculated values. For correct estimates of the material\u2019s properties, we find an excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental SNR.\nWhen radiation-sensitive low-Z material is studied in liquid, the resolution is SNR-limited, implying that the distinguishability of a nanoobject is a stochastic matter. It is not always clear how to optimize the microscope settings for maximum SNR at the lowest possible De, since SNR depends on s, which means that SNR varies with microscope magnification. For the study of spherical nano-objects, we, therefore, propose to determine SNRL by measuring the average SNR in a lesion consisting of n pixels (Eq. (10)). What is compared is a lesion over the object of interest and a lesion of the same size over the background. The starting point is the minimum magnification for detection at dmin = 2s. In case the objects show SNRL > 3, a smaller s can be applied in STEM image acquisition to resolve finer details of the objects. Here, it should be mentioned that the calculated resolution applies only to SiONPs residing in a single layer. In the case of more complex structures, the effective resolution may change at locations with overlapping particles in the image projection.\nIdeally, an acceptable electron dose or fluence should be determined for each component of the sample in liquid. In practice, this can be difficult, as structural changes may occur at multiple length scales [18]; perhaps not all are accessible by the microscopic system used. The structure of SiONP was found to stay intact for the tested De < 25 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2, consistent with earlier reports of particle elongation at cumulative De = 103\u2013104 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2 [27]. We did not address potential damage to the functionalization at the SiONP\u2019s surface [44], which could affect assembly properties.\nWhen PMs were imaged in a vacuum, no structural changes were observed. However, the projected diameter of PMs shrank when irradiated in a liquid cell containing ambient air or aqueous solution. A statistically significant reduction of the diameter of PM was observed at a cumulative De above De = 18.6 \u00b1 2 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2, which is somewhat below of damage threshold reported by others [26]. It should be noted that our method of defining the acceptable De is a method for observing the result of electron beam damage at the scale of the nanoobject but it does not directly probe the damage at the atomic scale. In addition, the sensitivity of the method depends on the detection efficiency, whereby more sensitive detection than what is used here, would possibly reveal small changes in the diameter of the PM not visible in our experiment. Other methods known in literature for assessing the limit of radiation involve, for example, measuring changes in the chemical composition of the object [45], and observation of fragmentation of a polymer [46]. To qualitatively explain the observed structural degradation of the PMs, we hypothesize a combination of direct and indirect damage where the electron beam disrupts the PM\u2019s polymer backbone, and creates free radicals in the surroundings that damage the structure from the outside [45], which leads to depolymerization and subsequent structural degradation of the PMs. Another possibility for the observed degradation is that the oxidized PM structure becomes hydrophilic and swells as water enters the structure [46]. Increasing water content and formation of gel-like substance could result in a diminishing contrast of PMs, which in turn, could be interpreted as degradation.\nThe hierarchical structure of binary particles was directly visualized using a STEM low-dose imaging protocol that allowed setting a balance between sufficient SNR and temporal resolution in the post-processing step of the data while staying within the electron beam damage limit. When irradiated with the STEM probe, the binary structures detached from the windows surface at De > 20 e\u2212 \u00c5\u2212 2. No degradation was observed within this range of De, and the limiting factor for resolving the hierarchical binary structure was motion blur. This movement could be due to secondary electrons charging the SiNx-membrane [47]. Another possibility is that the pH and ionic strength [48] change due to the\nradiolysis products that are formed in the irradiated liquid volume. The increased ionic strength may lead to the screening of electrostatic charges [44] that promote the attachment of particles on the window surface in the first place. Also, beam-induced changes in the pH could change the interaction potential between the siloxane-terminated SiNx-surface [49] and amino-terminated SiONPs.\nFinally, it is important to consider what complementary information LP-EM provides compared to dry-state and cryo-EM. When imaging the binary core-shell structure in a dry state, we commonly observe that many of the structures have collapsed, likely due to the capillary effect that disrupts the shell during the drying process [50]. In a recent cryo-EM study [51], the binary structure was imaged as embedded in vitreous ice, and it was possible to obtain a 3D-reconstruction of the SiONP distribution in the shell surrounding the PM core. Our LP-EM study shows that the shell retains its shape during sample preparation, but resolving the location of each individual SiONP is impossible due to the movement of the particles. It thus seems that the sample preparation in LP-EM is also able to preserve the binary structure intact so that the hierarchical binary structure could be observed. However, the image quality in sample thicknesses optimized for dynamic studies is inferior when compared with results from cryo-EM, where the sample is thinner, windows are absent, and higher electron doses can be used resulting in detection with higher resolution [29].\nFor maximal electron efficiency, it might be therefore beneficial to enable phase-contrast imaging by switching to TEM-mode and minimizing the liquid thickness to a level where phase-contrast effects become prominent [52]. For best observations, the PMs would need to be fixed to the SiN surface thus enhancing the observation of SiONP dynamics. Their mobility could be potentially tuned by unspecific [15] or specific [53] modification of the SiN surface. Earlier, it has been shown that the TEM illumination mode can be better for keeping particles adhered to the membrane [52]. Faster imaging and computation will also help observe motion [12]. Electron damage can possibly be mitigated in this type of experiment by using chemical additives [54], and using graphene to materials in the construction of the liquid cell [55]."

            "text": "We show how a combination of theoretical calculations and experiments can be used to examine which parameters have the most influence and need optimization to achieve optimal resolution in LP-EM studies of beam-sensitive and low-contrast nano-objects. In addition to experimental parameters t, De, and \u03b2, information about the exact density of the nano-object is crucial. For the experimental setup considered, DFSTEM is preferred over BF-STEM because it has similar performance and its image resolution is less sensitive to the detector opening angle settings. In addition, DF-STEM allows the identification of the different components of the sample via negative contrast on PMs. The theory of noise-limited resolution is based on the SNR of a single-pixel level at the center of a nano-object via the Rose criterion. In acquired data, however, nano-objects typically occupy several pixels. To precisely calculate the detectability of such nano-objects, we introduced SNR*L, which is proportional to the square root of the number of pixels involved. Electron beam illumination of the sample may result in physical and chemical changes to the sample, and it is, therefore, crucial to understand what impact the delivered De will have on the acquired data. A method was introduced that relies on a statistical analysis of morphological changes in the image data, and a maximal De was determined below which radiation damage was tolerable. It was thus possible to visualize beamsensitive, hierarchical low-Z binary structures consisting of SiONPs and PMs, and recognize both components. The optimization method introduced here may also find application in LP-EM studies of other radiation-sensitive and low-Z materials.\nP.
