 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a quantitative study to measure the impact of cash transfers on TB treatment outcomes like adherence, treatment success, and catastrophic costs. This could help quantify the benefits of cash transfers.

2. Test different conditionality models for cash transfers to find the optimal balance between effectiveness and burden on the health system. For example, compare unconditional cash transfers to conditional cash transfers with less frequent monitoring. 

3. Evaluate the integration of other social protection mechanisms like microcredit or long-term sick leave into the cash transfer program. This could identify complementary interventions to make the support more comprehensive.

4. Assess healthcare provider perspectives on integrating social work and psychosocial support services into TB care. This could inform efforts to implement "cash plus care" models. 

5. Conduct implementation research on scaling up social protection programs like PASTB across Vietnam. This could identify facilitators and barriers to expanding coverage nationwide.
