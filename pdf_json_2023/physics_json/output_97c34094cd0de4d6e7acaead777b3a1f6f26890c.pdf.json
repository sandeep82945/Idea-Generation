    "abstractText": "The adsorption mechanisms for model hydrocarbons, 4-nitrophenol (PNP), and naphthalene were studied in a coagulation-based process using a ferric sulfate\u2013lime softening system. Kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption parameters for this system were obtained under variable ionic strength and temperature. An in situ method was used to investigate kinetic adsorption profiles for PNP and naphthalene, where a pseudo-first order kinetic model adequately described the process. Thermodynamic parameters for the coagulation of PNP and naphthalene reveal an endothermic and spontaneous process. River water was compared against lab water samples at optimized conditions, where the results reveal that ions in the river water decrease the removal efficiency (RE; %) for PNP (RE = 28 to 20.3%) and naphthalene (RE = 89.0 to 80.2%). An aluminum sulfate (alum) coagulant was compared against the ferric system. The removal of PNP with alum decreased from RE = 20.5% in lab water and to RE = 16.8% in river water. Naphthalene removal decreased from RE = 89.0% with ferric sulfate to RE = 83.2% with alum in lab water and from RE = 80.2% for the ferric system to RE = 75.1% for alum in river water. Optical microscopy and dynamic light scattering of isolated flocs corroborated the role of ions in river water, according to variable RE and floc size distribution.",

            "text": "Many chemical process industries produce large volumes of oily wastewater that causes serious environmental problems when wastewater is not adequately treated [1]. In addition, oil spillage recurrently occurs during oil extraction, transportation, and storage processes, which leads to unintended soil and water contamination [2]. Hazardous chemicals are released from oil spills such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known to have harmful effects on ecosystems and human health [3]. Among the PAHs, naphthalene is relatively hydrophobic with relatively high melting/boiling points, electrochemical stability, and the propensity to reside in water, and in soils for long periods [4]. Among the various substituted arenes, p-nitrophenol (PNP) is regarded as a priority pollutant in industrial and agricultural wastewaters with high chemical stability, low water solubility, and high toxicity [5]. Methods such as filtration, adsorption, and coagulation are relevant for the treatment of effluent, apart from other water treatment methods [6]. Many researchers have reported the effectiveness of coagulation for the treatment of effluent with high levels of colloidal particles, organic matter, and suspended solids [7]. Coagulation is a suitable removal process for colloidal particles (negatively charged) that undergo neutralization by introduction of counter ions (positively charged) in the form of coagulants, which result in particle aggregation [8]. Chemical coagulants such as aluminum sulfate (alum), poly-aluminum chloride (PAC), alum potash, ferric sulfate or ferric chloride, among other coagulants, have been employed [9]. Four mechanisms\nMaterials 2023, 16, 655. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16020655 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 655 2 of 14\nthat are either adsorption or non-adsorption processes may serve to drive coagulation [10]. Among them, inter-particle bridging and charge neutralization are the most significant factors that favour adsorption, while double layer compression and sweep flocculation are the non-adsorption factors [11]. In conventional industrial water treatment at the municipal level, lime-softening is a traditional and low-cost method used to reduce the hardness of water [12]. Lime addition to hard water (i.e., lime-softening) serves to increase the pH of water. In turn, bicarbonates transform into carbonates, where Ca2+ and Mg2+ are eliminated from water in the form of CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 species, where such water softening is conceived for reducing the levels of calcium and magnesium ions [13]. Coagulation along with lime-softening has been proven to be an effective combination during water treatment processes for the removal of colloidal particles [14]. To reduce environmental damage to a minimum when accidental oil spills occur in aquatic environments, a scenario-specific response strategy was developed in a previous study [15]. Herein, the main aim of this work was to study the adsorption properties (kinetic and thermodynamic) of PNP and naphthalene that employs a ferric sulfate\u2013lime softening system via a chemical coagulation process. The comparison of different coagulant systems, ferric vs. aluminum sulfate, and source water samples (laboratory vs. saline river water) was also studied for the removal of model contaminants (PNP and naphthalene). Finally, microscopy images and floc size were used to gain insight on the differences between the use of ferric sulfate over aluminum sulfate, and the effect of surface water on the properties of the flocs."

The effect of using river water with alum as the coagulant results in decreased removal of PNP from 20.5 to 16.8%, as compared with lab water. The size of flocs with alum as the coagulant are small when compared with flocs obtained using ferric sulfate. When naphthalene in a lab water sample undergoes coagulation with ferric sulfate, higher removal efficiency can be achieved (89.0%). This removal decreased to 80.2% when river water was used, assuming the effect of competition relates mainly to the presence of greater ionic strength of the media. Based on an analysis of river water, the amount of dissolved solids is estimated at 250 mg/L. By comparison, the total organic carbon (TOC) was 4.9 mg/L, which indicates that the major fraction of the dissolved solids is inorganic (\u224898%), in agreement with the role of prominent ionic strength effects in river water versus lab water. The use of alum as the coagulant for naphthalene removal has a lower RE (83.2%) when compared with ferric sulfate (89.0%). The same effect was observed when river water was used, as evidenced by decreasing naphthalene removal from 83.2 to 75.1%.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 655 9 of 14\n3.4. Floc Characterization 3.4.1.

Hydrated iron salts can form different chemical species. The dark regions can be aggregates of ferric or calcium species due to their dominant contributions as cations, and their complexes with inorganic anions, which appeared as dark yellow under the microscope. The optical microscopy images were used to mainly identify differences in floc size and density to correlate with the kinetics of the coagulation process. In general, there appears to be a correlation between the floc density and the ionic strength upon comparison of ferric flocs in lab versus river water for PNP (cf. Figure 6a,b) and naphthalene (cf. Figure 7a,b). This trend is in accordance with the role of charge neutralization effects and the greater floc density observed for river water samples. This trend concurs with the greater ionic strength of river water and the reduced kinetic barrier for floc formation for either model pollutant (PNP or naphthalene).\nMaterials 2023, 16, 655 11 of 14\n3.4.2. Flocs Size\nThe results obtained related particle size (nm) and polydispersity index (PDI) in aqueous media are presented in Table 5. The PDI is a parameter used to describe the size particle range of flocs. The measured values could be any denomination between 0 and 1, where lower values indicate more homogenous dispersions than higher values. Usually, values < 0.5 are considered acceptable concerning the homogeneity of the prepared dispersions [30]. PNP flocs with lab water showed values for PDI higher than 0.5 (ferric sulfate PDI = 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 and aluminum PDI = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1). These flocs are considered as non-homogeneous dispersions. PNP flocs formed with river water present for PDI values of 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 for ferric and aluminum sulfate. These results showed that size of the flocs are more homogeneous when river versus lab water was used. This trend was attributed to the presence of greater ion levels (ca. 250 mg/L) in river water (cf. Table S1, Supplementary Material). The trends for lab and river water corroborate the images for the floc results presented above (cf. Section 3.4.1).\nIn lab water, the naphthalene flocs size presents a PDI = 1.0 for the system with ferric sulfate, but a lower value (PDI = 0.6) when alum was the coagulant. Even when both PDI values are above 0.5, naphthalene flocs formed with alum are apparently more homogenous than using ferric sulfate as the coagulant. When river water is used for naphthalene removal, the ferric sulfate PDI value is the same as that for lab water. Naphthalene uptake is lower for river water (RE% = 80.2) than lab water (RE% = 89.0) with ferric sulfate as coagulant. Based on these results, we can assume that the difference in the homogeneity of the flocs homogeneity strongly relates to the role of surface charge on the flocs and the ionic strength of the media. For the case of PNP (cf. Figure 6a,b), the ferric-based flocs in lab water tend to be more heterogeneous with lower density than those in river water. Similar trends are noted for naphthalene (cf. Figure 7a,b). Observed differences between alum and the hydrolysis products of ferric sulfate are anticipated for the adsorption mechanism of naphthalene due to the strong interactions between ferric species and carbonates. PDI differences for the alum systems concur with a naphthalene adsorption mechanism and effect of greater ion levels present in river water [31]. The greater density and homogeneity of the flocs formed in river can be related to the greater ionic strength of this media over lab water and the reduced nucleation barrier of flocs formed at higher ionic strength."

            "text": "Coagulation of two types of model hydrocarbon oil-based compounds were studied as representative pollutants: p-nitrophenol (PNP) and naphthalene. Herein, an optimized ferric sulfate\u2013lime softening coagulant system was adapted from previous work to characterize the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the coagulation-based removal process. The kinetic results were obtained using an in situ (one-pot) method, which showed that the PFO model provided a better fit over the PSO kinetic model for the two model pollutants. Kinetic removal (RE; %) profiles at different temperatures (5, 15, and 22 \u25e6C) were used to\nMaterials 2023, 16, 655 12 of 14\nevaluate PNP and naphthalene. Upon decreasing the temperature from 22 to 5 \u25e6C, the adsorption capacity decreased from 8 to 4 mg g\u22121 for PNP, whereas temperature had a negligible effect on the naphthalene adsorption profile. Additionally, the coagulation process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature, based on the thermodynamic parameters. The prevalence of physical adsorption was verified by the enthalpy of the process: \u2206H\u25e6 = 32.7 kJ mol\u22121 for PNP and \u2206H\u25e6 = 10.8 kJ mol\u22121 for naphthalene. Aluminum sulfate was used as a reference coagulant to compare against the ferric sulfate system, for both river water and lab water samples, respectively. The removal efficiency (RE) of PNP with ferric sulfate system is lower for river water (RE = 20.3%) versus lab water (RE = 28.0%). By comparison, parallel trends are noted for alum, with the removal for PNP (RE = 16.8%) in river water versus PNP (RE = 20.5%) in lab water. Naphthalene coagulation follows parallel trends as noted for PNP, where the removal is generally higher overall, as follows: naphthalene with ferric sulfate as coagulant yields RE (80.2%) for river water versus lab water (RE = 89.0%). For the case of alum as the coagulant, the removal decreases from 83.2% (lab water) to 75.1% (river water). The floc images by optical microscopy and particle size analysis for PNP- and naphthalene-containing flocs show a corresponding trend related to the concentration of ions in the river water samples. The presence of greater ion concentration negatively affects the RE (%) for both ferric and aluminum systems, along with the floc size distribution, according to ionic strength effects in river water samples.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma16020655/s1.
