    "abstractText": "We introduce a technique for identifying the most salient participants in a discussion. Our method, MavenRank is based on lexical centrality: a random walk is performed on a graph in which each node is a participant in the discussion and an edge links two participants who use similar rhetoric. As a test, we used MavenRank to identify the most influential members of the US Senate using data from the US Congressional Record and used committee ranking to evaluate the output. Our results show that MavenRank scores are largely driven by committee status in most topics, but can capture speaker centrality in topics where speeches are used to indicate ideological position instead of influence legislation.",

            "text": "In a conversation or debate between a group of people, we can think of two remarks as interacting if they are both comments on the same topic. For example, if one speaker says \u201ctaxes should be lowered to help business,\u201d while another argues \u201ctaxes should be raised to support our schools,\u201d the speeches are interacting with each other by describing the same issue. In a debate with many people arguing about many different things, we could imagine a large network of speeches interacting with each other in the same way. If we associate each speech in the network with its speaker, we can try to identify the most important people in the debate based on how central their speeches are in the network.\nTo describe this type of centrality, we borrow a term from The Tipping Point (Gladwell, 2002), in which Gladwell describes a certain type of personality in a social network called a maven. A maven is a trusted expert in a specific field who influences other people by passing information and advice. In this paper, our goal is to identify authoritative speakers who control the spread of ideas within a topic. To do this, we introduce MavenRank, which measures the centrality of speeches as nodes in the type of network described in the previous paragraph.\nSignificant research has been done in the area of identifying central nodes in a network. Various methods exist for measuring centrality, including degree centrality, closeness, betweenness (Freeman, 1977; Newman, 2003), and eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality in particular has been successfully applied to many different types of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al., 2004). The authors of (Lin and Kan, 2007) extended these methods to include timestamped graphs where nodes are added over time and applied it to multidocument summarization. In (Tong and Faloutsos, 2006), the authors use random walks on a graph as a method for finding a subgraph that best connects some or all of a set of query nodes. In our paper, we introduce a new application of eigenvector centrality for identifying the central speakers in the type of debate or conversation network described above. Our method is based on the one described in (Erkan\n658\nand Radev, 2004) and (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), but modified to rank speakers instead of documents or sentences.\nIn our paper, we apply our method to analyze the US Congressional Record, which is a verbatim transcript of speeches given in the United States House of Representatives and Senate. The Record is a dense corpus of speeches made by a large number of people over a long period of time. Using the transcripts of political speeches adds an extra layer of meaning onto the measure of speaker centrality. The centrality of speakers in Congress can be thought of as a measure of relative importance or influence in the US legislative process. We can also use speaker centrality to analyze committee membership: are the central speakers on a given issue ranking members of a related committee? Is there a type of importance captured through speaker centrality that isn\u2019t obvious in the natural committee rankings?\nThere has been growing interest in using techniques from natural language processing in the area of political science. In (Porter et al., 2005) the authors performed a network analysis of members and committees of the US House of Representatives. They found connections between certain committees and political positions that suggest that committee membership is not determined at random. In (Thomas et al., 2006), the authors use the transcripts of debates from the US Congress to automatically classify speeches as supporting or opposing a given topic by taking advantage of the voting records of the speakers. In (Wang et al., 2005), the authors use a generative model to simultaneously discover groups of voters and topics using the voting records and the text from bills of the US Senate and the United Nations. The authors of (Quinn et al., 2006) introduce a multinomial mixture model to perform unsupervised clustering of Congressional speech documents into topically related categories. We rely on the output of this model to cluster the speeches from the Record in order to compare speaker rankings within a topic to related committees.\nWe take advantage of the natural measures of prestige in Senate committees and use them as a standard for comparison with MavenRank. Our hypothesis is that MavenRank centrality will capture the importance of speakers based on the natural\ncommittee rankings and seniority. We can test this claim by clustering speeches into topics and then mapping the topics to related committees. If the hypothesis is correct, then the speaker centrality should be correlated with the natural committee rankings.\nThere have been other attempts to link floor participation with topics in political science. In (Hall, 1996), the author found that serving on a committee can positively predict participation in Congress, but that seniority was not a good predictor. His measure only looked at six bills in three committees, so his method is by far not as comprehensive as the one that we present here. Our approach with MavenRank differs from previous work by providing a large scale analysis of speaker centrality and bringing natural language processing techniques to the realm of political science."

The Congressional Record is a verbatim transcript of the speeches made in the US House of Representatives and Senate beginning with the 101st Congress in 1998 and includes tens of thousands of speeches per year. In our experiments we focused on the records from the 105th and 106th Senates. The basic unit of the US Congressional Speech corpus is a record, which corresponds to a single subsection of the print version of the Congressional Record and may contain zero or more speakers. Each paragraph of text within a record is tagged as either speech or non-speech and each paragraph of speech text is tagged with the unique id of the speaker. Figure 1 shows an example record file for the sixth record on July 14th, 1997 in the 105th Senate.\nIn our experiments we use a smaller unit of analysis called a speech document by taking all of the text of a speaker within a single record. The capitalization and punctuation is then removed from the text as in (Monroe et al., 2006) and then the\n1http://thomas.loc.gov\ntext stemmed using Porter\u2019s Snowball II stemmer2. Figure 1 shows an example speech document for speaker 15703 (Herb Kohl of Wisconsin) that has been generated from the record in Figure 1.\nIn addition to speech documents, we also use speaker documents. A speaker document is the concatenation of all of a speaker\u2019s speech documents within a single session and topic (so a single speaker may have multiple speaker documents across topics). For example within the 105th Senate in topic 1 (\u201cJudicial Nominations\u201d), Senator Kohl has four speech documents, so the speaker document attributed to him within this session and topic would be the text of these four documents treated as a single unit. The order of the concatenation does not matter since we will look at it as a vector of weighted term frequencies (see Section 3.2)."

In their paper, they use a model where the probabilities of a document belonging to a certain topic varies smoothly over time and the words within a given document have exactly the same probability of being drawn from a particular topic. These two properties make the model different than standard mixture models (McLachlan and Peel, 2000) and the latent Dirichlet allocation model of (Blei et al., 2003). The model of (Quinn et al., 2006) is most closely related to the model of (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), who present a generalization of the model used by (Quinn et al., 2006). Table 1 lists the 42 topics and their related committees.\nThe output from the topic model is a D \u00d7 42 matrix Z where D is the number of speech documents and the element zdk represents the probability of the dth speech document being generated by topic k. We clustered the speech documents by assigning a speech document d to the kth cluster where\nk = arg max j zdj .\nIf the maximum value is not unique, we arbitrarily assign d to the lowest numbered cluster where zdj is\n2http://snowball.tartarus.org/ algorithms/english/stemmer.html\na maximum. A typical topic cluster contains several hundred speech documents, while some of the larger topic clusters contain several thousand."

Because we are matching short topic names to the complex descriptions given by Rule XXV, the topic-committee map is not one to one or even particularly well defined: some topics are mapped to multiple committees, some topics are not mapped to any committees, and two different topics may be mapped to the same committee. This is not a major problem because even if a one to one map between topics and committees existed, speakers from outside a topic\u2019s related committee are free to participate in the topic simply by giving a speech. Therefore there is no way to rank all speakers in a topic using committee information. To test our hypotheses, we focused our attention on topics that have at least one related committee. In Section 4.3 we describe how the MavenRank scores\n3http://rules.senate.gov/senaterules/ rule25.php\nof speakers who are not members of related committees were taken into account when we measured the rank correlations."

            "text": "MavenRank is a graph-based method for finding speaker centrality. It is similar to the methods in (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005), which can be used for ranking sentences in extractive summaries and documents in an information retrieval system. Given a collection of speeches s1, . . . , sN and a measure of lexical similarity between pairs sim(si, sj) \u2265 0, a similarity graph can be constructed. The nodes of the graph represent the speeches and a weighted similarity edge is placed between pairs that exceed a similarity threshold smin. MavenRank is based on the premise that important speakers will have central speeches in the graph, and that central speeches should be similar to other central speeches. A recursive explanation of this concept is that the score of a speech should be proportional to the scores of its similar neighbors.\nGiven a speech s in the graph, we can express the recursive definition of its score p(s) as\np(s) = \u2211\nt\u2208adj[s]\np(t) wdeg(t)\n(1)\nwhere adj[s] is the set of all speeches adjacent to s and wdeg(t) = \u2211 u\u2208adj[t] sim(t, u), the weighted degree of t. Equation (1) captures the idea that the MavenRank score of a speech is distributed to its neighbors. We can rewrite this using matrix notation as\np = pB (2)\nwhere p = (p(s1), p(s2), . . . , p(sN )) and the matrix B is the row normalized similarity matrix of the graph\nB(i, j) = S(i, j)\u2211 k S(i, k)\n(3)\nwhere S(i, j) = sim(si, sj). Equation (2) shows that the vector of MavenRank scores p is the left eigenvector of B with eigenvalue 1.\nWe can prove that the eigenvector p exists by using a techinque from (Page et al., 1999). We can treat the matrix B as a Markov chain describing the transition probabilities of a random walk on the speech similarity graph. The vector p then represents the stationary distribution of the random walk. It is possible that some parts of the graph are disconnected or that the walk gets trapped in a component. These problems are solved by reserving a small escape probability at each node that represents a chance of jumping to any node in the graph, making the Markov chain irreducible and aperiodic, which guarantees the existence of the eigenvector. Assuming a uniform escape probability for each node on the graph, we can rewrite Equation (2) as\np = p[dU + (1\u2212 d)B] (4)\nwhere U is a square matrix with U(i, j) = 1/N for all i and j, N is the number of nodes, and d is the escape probability chosen in the interval [0.1, 0.2] (Brin and Page, 1998). Equation (4) is known as PageRank (Page et al., 1999) and is used for determining prestige on the web in the Google search engine."

            "text": "In our experiments, we used tf-idf cosine similarity to measure lexical similarity between speech documents. We represent each speech document as a vector of term frequencies (or tf), which are weighted according to the relative importance of the given term in the cluster. The terms are weighted by their inverse document frequency or idf. The idf of a term w is given by (Sparck-Jones, 1972)\nidf(w) = log ( N\nnw\n) (5)\nwhere N is the number of documents in the corpus and nw is the number of documents in the corpus containing the term w. It follows that very common words like \u201cof\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d have a very low idf, while the idf values of rare words are higher. In our experiments, we calculated the idf values for each topic using all speech documents across sessions within the\ngiven topic. We calculated topic-specific idf values because some words may be relatively unimportant in one topic, but important in another. For example, in topic 22 (\u201cAbortion\u201d), the idf of the term \u201cabort\u201d is near 0.20, while in topic 38 (\u201cTaxes\u201d), its idf is near 7.18.\nThe tf-idf cosine similarity measure tf-idf-cosine(u, v) is defined as\nP w\u2208u,v tfu(w) tfv(w) idf(w) 2\n\u221aP w\u2208u(tfu(w) idf(w))2 \u221aP w\u2208v(tfv(w) idf(w))2 , (6)\nwhich is the cosine of the angle between the tf-idf vectors.\nThere are other alternatives to tf-idf cosine similarity. Some other possible similarity measures are document edit distance, the language models from (Kurland and Lee, 2005), or generation probabilities from (Erkan, 2006). For simplicity, we only used tf-idf similarities in our experiments, but any of these measures could be used in this case."

            "text": "Table 2 summarizes the results. \u201cMaven\u201d status on most topics does appear to be driven by committee status, as expected. There are particularly strong effects of seniority and rank in topics tied to the Judiciary, Foreign Relations, and Armed Services committees, as well as legislation-rich areas of domestic policy. Perhaps of greater interest are the topics that do not have committee effects. These are of three distinct types. The first are highly politicized topics for which speeches are intended not to influence\nlegislation as much as indicate an ideological or partisan position, so the mavens are not on particular committees (abortion, children, seniors, the economy). The second are \u201cdistributive politics\u201d topics where many Senators speak to defend state or regional interests, so debate is broadly distributed and there are no clear mavens (agriculture, military base closures, public lands). Third are topics where there are not enough speeches for clear results, because most debate occurred after 1999-2000 (post-9/11 intelligence reform, McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform).\nAlternative models, using measures of centrality based on the centroid were also examined. Distance to centroid provides broadly similar results as MavenRank, with several marginal significance results reversed in each direction. Cosine similarity with centroid, on the other hand, appears to have no relationship with committee structure.\nFigure 2 shows the MavenRank percentiles (using the speech document network) for Senators Rick Santorum, Barbara Boxer, and Edward Kennedy across a few topics in the 106th Senate. These sample scores conform to the expected rankings for these speakers. In this session, Santorum was the\nsponsor of a bill to ban partial birth abortions and was a spokesman for Social Security reform, which support his high ranking in abortion and workers/retirement. Boxer acted as the lead opposition to Santorum\u2019s abortion bill and is known for her support of child abuse laws. Kennedy was ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee and the Judiciary committee (which was involved with the abortion bill)."

To test our method for finding central speakers, we analyzed the Congressional\nRecord by creating a map from the clusters of speeches to Senate committees and comparing the natural ranking committee members to the output of MavenRank. We found evidence of a possible relationship between the lexical centrality and committee rank of a speaker by ranking the speeches using MavenRank and computing the rank correlation with the natural ordering of speakers. Some specific committees disagreed with our hypothesis that MavenRank and committee position are correlated, which we propose is because of the non-legislative aspects of those specific committees. The results of our experiment suggest that MavenRank can indeed be used to find central speakers in a corpus of speeches.\nWe are currently working on applying our methods to the US House of Representatives and other records of parliamentary speech from the United Kingdom and Australia. We have also developed a dynamic version of MavenRank that takes time into account when finding lexical centrality and plan on using it with the various parliamentary records. We are interested in dynamic MavenRank to go further with the idea of tracking how ideas get propagated through a network of debates, including congressional records, blogs, and newsgroups."
