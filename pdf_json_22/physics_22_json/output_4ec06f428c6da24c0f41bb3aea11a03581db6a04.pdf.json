This event was first classified as a normal binary-lens single-source (2L1S) event, but a careful 2L1S modelling showed that it needs an additional lens or source to fit the observed data. It is found that the 3L1S model provides the best fit, but the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model is only disfa v oured by \u03c72 18. All of the feasible models include a planet with planet-to-host mass-ratios 10 \u22123 q 10 \u22122 . A Bayesian analysis based on a Galactic model indicates that the planet is super-Jovian, and the projected host-planet separation is about 3 au. Specifically, for the best-fitting 3L1S model, the two stars have masses of M 1 = 0 . 57 + 0 . 43 \u22120 . 32 M , and M 2 = 0 . 18 + 0 . 15 \u22120 . 10 M with projected separation of 1 . 3 + 0 . 5 \u22120 . 5 au, and the planetary mass is M 3 = 2 . 2 + 1 . 8 \u22121 . 3 M Jupiter . For the 2L2S model, the masses of the host star and the planet are 0 . 55 + 0 . 44 \u22120 . 31 M and 4 . 6 + 3 . 7 \u22122 . 6 M Jupiter , respectiv ely. By inv estigating the properties of all known microlensing planets in binary systems, we find that all planets in binary systems published by the KMTNet surv e y are located inside the resonant caustics range with q 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , indicating the incompleteness of the KMTNet sample for planets in binary systems. Thus, planets in binary systems cannot be included in the current study of the KMTNet mass-ratio function, and a systematic search for planetary anomalies in KMTNet microlensing light curves of binary systems is needed.",

As the planet-in-binary sample size rows, studies on comparing the characteristics of planets in binary ystems with planets around single stars have been done (e.g. Roell t al. 2012 ). Using publicly av ailable K epler data, Armstrong et al. 2014 ) found that the occurrence rate of circumbinary planets may e consistent with or higher than that of planets orbiting a single star. esides, with Keck II high resolution imaging for 382 Kepler Objects f Interest, Kraus et al. ( 2016 ) found that the planet occurrence ate in close binaries (with projected separation 50 au) is about hree times lower than in wide binaries or single stars. These results ndicate that the binarity may have a limited effect on the formation f circumbinary planets and circumstellar planets with very wide inary separations ( 100 au). Ho we ver, for circumstellar planets 2 n much closer binaries (with separation \u223c20 au), the situation is ifferent such that the planet formation efficiency would be strongly f fected (lo wered) by the presence of the companion star (Thebault & aghighipour 2015 ). Within the framework of gravitational collapse or core accretion, ome theoretical works indicate that a close companion would inhibit lanet formation. For example, by e v aporating volatile materials due o internal thermal energy generation in the disc (Nelson 2000 ), r by increasing the eccentricity of the gas disc and the relative elocity between dust and gas, thus reducing the coagulation and he average mass of the particles (Zsom, S \u0301andor & Dullemond 011 ). The disco v ery of planets in close binaries implies that planet ormation is a robust process, and it has triggered a great interest in esting and developing planet formation theories in such dynamically ctive environments (Jang-Condell 2015 ). The apsidal alignment of protoplanetary disc with the binary orbit has been found to be one f the critical conditions for planetesimal gro wth, which allo ws the mergence of a dynamically quiet location in the disc (Silsbee & afikov 2021 ). Theories on planet formation in binary systems are under rapid evelopment. To obtain a more complete picture of how planets form n binary systems, a larger sample would be beneficial. Ho we ver, urrently, there are some observational biases. F or e xample, most ircumbinary planets detected by Kepler are located near the stability imit, i.e. they would be dynamically unstable if they were in a slightly loser orbit (Holman & Wiegert 1999 ; Ballantyne et al. 2021 ). This s thought to be caused by selection effects, i.e. the transit and radial elocity methods require longer time coverage to detect longer period lanets. The gravitational microlensing technique (Mao & Paczynski 1991 ;\nould & Loeb 1992 ) is complementary to other exoplanet detection ethods due to its unique sensitivity for planets in binary systems e.g. Luhn, Penny & Gaudi 2016 ). With the microlensing method, the lanet signal is detectable either through its influence on the central austic formed by the stellar binary, or through the planetary caustic ormed by the planet. The time-scale of a typical microlensing event\nhttps://e xoplanetarchiv e.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html F or e xample, \u03b3 Cephei A (Hatzes et al. 2003 ; Neuh \u0308auser et al. 2007 ), HD 1004 A (Zucker et al. 2004 ), and HD 41004 A (Correia et al. 2008 ; Chauvin t al. 2011 ).\n4\nd u 2 m s 5\nowards the Galactic bulge is about one month. Unlike the transit and adial velocity methods, the microlensing method does not require ears of observations due to the long orbital period of the planet or he companion. For example, Bennett et al. ( 2016 ) reported the first ase of microlensing circumbinary planet. In this case, the projected eparation between the planet and the centre of mass is \u223c40 times arger than the separation between the two stars, well beyond the tability limit. This detection indicates that circumbinary planets with table orbits may be quite common. Ho we ver to date, only seven nambiguous planets in binary systems have been disco v ered by icrolensing. Here we restrict the stellar binary mass-ratio, q 2 > 0.1. hese events include OGLE-2006-BLG-284 (Bennett et al. 2020 ), GLE-2007-BLG-349 (Bennett et al. 2016 ), OGLE-2008-BLG-092 Poleski et al. 2014 ), OGLE-2013-BLG-0341 (Gould et al. 2014 ), GLE-2016-BLG-0613 (Han et al. 2017 ), 3 OGLE-2018-BLG-1700 Han et al. 2020 ), and KMT-2019-BLG-1715 (Han et al. 2021a ). 4\nThere are two main challenges in detecting planets in binary ystems via the microlensing method. First, the perturbations on microlensing light curve from the stellar binary are often much tronger than those from a planetary companion, for which one first eeds careful binary-lens single-source (2L1S) modelling to isolate he signal from the stellar binary and then search for the planetary ignals. Ho we v er, in man y cases, modellers would lose interest in he light curves with obvious stellar-binary features. Second, the riple-lens single-source (3L1S) modelling is computationally much\nore e xpensiv e than the 2L1S modelling due to a higher-dimensional arameter space and more complex image and caustics topology. There have been several approaches to calculate 3L1S light curves. revious analyses of 3L1S events (e.g. the first microlensing twolanet event OGLE-2006-BLG-109, Gaudi et al. 2008 ; Bennett et al. 010 ) are mainly based on the inverse ray-shooting method (Kayser, efsdal & Stabell 1986 ; Schneider & Weiss 1987 ), including the mage centred ray-shooting method (Bennett & Rhie 1996 ) and the map-making\u2019 method (Dong et al. 2006 , 2009b ). In addition, Meiavilla et al. ( 2006 ), Mediavilla et al. ( 2011 ) proposed an approach ased on inverse polygon mapping. In the low-magnification regime, ne can use the hexadecapole approximation (Gould 2008 ; Pejcha & e yro vsk \u0301y 2009 ). Recently, K uang et al. ( 2021 ) implemented a eneral contour integration method (Gould & Gaucherel 1997 ; ominik 1998b ) for 3L1S and made this microlensing 3L1S code ublicly available. 5\nIn this paper, we present the first application of the code to a real L1S event, OGLE-2019-BLG-1470, for which the lens system is omposed of a super-Jovian planet and a low-mass stellar binary. he anomaly of this event was found by the Korea Microlensing elescope Network (KMTNet, Kim et al. 2016 ) AnomalyFinder Zang et al. 2021 ) applied to its 2019 subprime-field sample (cadence < 2 hr \u22121 ), and careful 2L1S modelling conducted by H. Wang uggested that it needs an additional lens or source to fit the light urve.\nThe paper is structured as follows. We first introduce the observaions and data reduction for this event in Section 2 . We then present\nMNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nWe count those events with clear interpretations without other competing egenerate models.

F or both urv e ys, images were mainly taken in the I -band with occasional bservations in the V -band for the source colour measurements. We ummarize the data sets used in this work in Table 1 . The data used in the light-curve analysis were reduced using ustom implementations of the difference image analysis technique Tomaney & Crotts 1996 ; Alard & Lupton 1998 ; Bramich 2008 ): ozniak ( 2000 ) for the OGLE data and PYSIS (Albrow et al. 2009 ) for he KMTNet data. For the KMTC data, we conduct PYDIA photometry Albrow 2017 ) to measure the source colour. The I -band magnitude f the data has been calibrated to the standard I -band magnitude using he OGLE-II star catalogue (Udalski et al. 2002 ). Due to systematics, he photometric error bars of data estimated by photometry pipelines re often underestimated. We thus follow the method proposed by ee et al.

The ight curve exhibits three anomalous peaks relative to an otherwise ormal point-source point-lens (PSPL, Paczy \u0301nski 1986 ) light curve t HJD \u2032 = HJD \u2212 2450000 \u223c 8746.0, 8753.4, and 8756.6, marked s t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 , respectively. The first anomaly is a smooth bump, hich may be due to a cusp approach. The second and third anomalies ogether likely form a \u2018U shape\u2019, respectively corresponding to the ntrance and exit of a caustic-crossing feature. Such a light curve is enerally produced by a 2L1S event (e.g. Koshimoto et al. 2017 ), so e begin the light-curve analysis by the 2L1S modelling.\n.1 2L1S analysis\nstatic 2L1S light curv e requires sev en parameters ( t 0 , u 0 , t E , s , q , \u03b1, ) to calculate the 2L1S magnification. \u2018Static\u2019 means that we do not onsider high-order effects such as the microlens parallax effect and he orbital motion of the lens or the source. The first three parameters f the 2L1S static model are the PSPL parameters. Of these, t 0 is the ime of closest approach of the source to the lens centre of mass and 0 is the closest distance of the source to the lens centre of mass in nits of the angular Einstein radius ( \u03b8E ). The third parameter t E is\nTable 2. 2L1S lensing parameters.\nParameter Static High-order u 0 > 0 u 0 < 0 Best fit MCMC Best fit MCMC Best fit MCMC \u03c72 / dof 1265.25/1124 1181.49/1120 1181.27/1120\nt 0 (HJD \u2032 ) 8750.870 8750 . 955 + 0 . 176 \u22120 . 172 8750.307 8750 . 265 + 0 . 200 \u22120 . 214 8750.141 8750 . 228 + 0 . 191 \u22120 . 224 u 0 0.229 0 . 227 + 0 . 008 \u22120 . 009 0.219 0 . 228 + 0 . 013 \u22120 . 015 \u22120.228 \u22120 . 229 + 0 . 015 \u22120 . 015 t E (days) 40.575 40 . 907 + 1 . 268 \u22121 . 106 39.576 39 . 715 + 3 . 377 \u22121 . 736 38.478 39 . 861 + 5 . 993 \u22121 . 895 s 1.154 1 . 152 + 0 . 006 \u22120 . 006 1.171 1 . 162 + 0 . 010 \u22120 . 011 1.167 1 . 161 + 0 . 010 \u22120 . 012 q (10 \u22123 ) 4.456 4 . 476 + 0 . 392 \u22120 . 366 5.803 4 . 927 + 0 . 991 \u22121 . 168 5.062 4 . 691 + 1 . 061 \u22121 . 599 \u03b1 (rad) 5.099 5 . 093 + 0 . 016 \u22120 . 017 5.206 5 . 173 + 0 . 034 \u22120 . 045 1.101 1 . 115 + 0 . 065 \u22120 . 038 \u03c1(10 \u22123 ) 7.56 < 9 . 01 (3 \u03c3 ) 2 8.731 7 . 948 + 1 . 101 \u22121 . 222 8.271 7 . 655 + 1 . 106 \u22121 . 299 \u03c0E, N \u2013 \u2013 \u22122.233 \u22122 . 004 + 2 . 306 \u22120 . 706 2.190 1 . 841 + 0 . 821 \u22123 . 198 \u03c0E, E \u2013 \u2013 \u22120.716 \u22120 . 769 + 0 . 161 \u22120 . 183 \u22120.857 \u22120 . 862 + 0 . 144 \u22120 . 173 d s /d t (yr \u22121 ) \u2013 \u2013 \u22121.233 \u22120 . 489 + 0 . 788 \u22120 . 697 \u22120.697 \u22120 . 354 + 0 . 865 \u22120 . 782 d \u03b1/d t (yr \u22121 ) \u2013 \u2013 \u22122.692 \u22120 . 996 + 2 . 488 \u22121 . 728 \u22120.137 1 . 048 + 1 . 650 \u22122 . 656 f S , OGLE 1 0.194 0 . 192 + 0 . 009 \u22120 . 009 0.184 0 . 192 + 0 . 012 \u22120 . 015 0.192 0 . 192 + 0 . 013 \u22120 . 013 f B, OGLE 0.252 0 . 254 + 0 . 009 \u22120 . 009 0.267 0 . 259 + 0 . 015 \u22120 . 012 0.259 0 . 258 + 0 . 014 \u22120 . 013 Notes. 1 The flux is on an 18th magnitude scale, e.g. I S = 18 \u2212 2.5 log ( f S ).

The three additional parameters ( s , q , \u03b1) define the inary ( M 1 and M 2 ) geometry: s is the binary separation in units f \u03b8E , q is the binary mass ratio, and \u03b1 is the angle between the ource trajectory and the binary-lens axis. The last parameter, \u03c1, epresents the angular source radius normalized by \u03b8E , and it is eeded to describe finite-source effects (Gould 1994 ; Nemiroff & ickramasinghe 1994 ; W itt & Mao 1994 ) in caustic-crossing and/or usp-approach features. Besides, for each data set i , we introduce wo linear parameters ( f S, i , f B, i ) to represent the source flux and any lended flux. We use the advanced contour integration code (Bozza 010 ; Bozza et al. 2018 ) VBBinaryLensing 6 to calculate the L1S magnification at any time t . The static 2L1S modelling includes two steps. First, we conduct grid search in the parameter space (log s , log q , \u03b1, \u03c1) to find the ocal minima, which consists of 41 values of log s equally spaced etween \u22121.0 and 1.0, 61 values of log q equally spaced between 6.0 and 0.0, 20 values equally spaced between 0 \u25e6 \u2264 \u03b1 < 360 \u25e6,\nnd five values of log \u03c1 equally spaced between \u22123.5 and \u22121.5. or each grid point, we explore the parameter space of ( t 0 , u 0 , t E ) ith the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method by using the mcee ensemble sampler (F oreman-Macke y et al. 2013 ). We choose he sample with the minimum \u03c72 in the MCMC chain, and further efine it with the Nelder\u2013Mead simplex algorithm 7 (Nelder & Mead 965 ; Gao & Han 2012 ). The \u03c72 impro v ement with the Nelder\u2013Mead lgorithm relative to the best-fit sample in the MCMC chain is 1, nd all the best-fitting parameters are inside the 1 \u03c3 credible levels.\nht tp://www.fisica.unisa.it /GravitationAstr ophysics/VBBinar yLensing.htm Throughout the paper, this is done every time we run an MCMC sampling.\n\u03c0\nT e\necond, for the local minima identified by the grid search, we refine he solution by allowing all seven parameters to vary. We show the arameters and error bars of the best-fitting model in Table 2 . Note hat, as recommended by Hogg & F oreman-Macke y ( 2018 ), we use he median of the MCMC chain as the measurement value, and the 6 per cent, 84 per cent quantiles as the lower and upper 1 \u03c3 error ars. The best-fitting static 2L1S model and its residuals from the bserved data are shown in Fig. 2 . This model predicts a magnificaion higher than the observed data during 8720 < HJD \u2032 < 8734 and 747 < HJD \u2032 < 8752 while during 8763 < HJD \u2032 < 8772, the model agnification is not high enough to explain the data. In addition to est the distribution of normalized residuals against a standard normal istribution (with mean 0 and standard deviation 1), Fig. 3 shows the uantile\u2013Quantile (Q\u2013Q) plot (Wilk & Gnanadesikan 1968 ) genrated with the normalized residuals during 8720 < HJD \u2032 < 8780. he upper left-hand panel shows the Q\u2013Q plot of the static 2L1S odel. The quantiles calculated with normalized residuals of this odel obviously deviate from the standard normal distribution at oth the low and high ends. We also conduct a two-sample Anderson\u2013 arling test (Scholz & Stephens 1987 ) with the normalized residuals gainst the standard normal distribution. The null hypothesis that the esiduals follow the standard normal distribution can be rejected t the 0.5 per cent significance level. We label the value of the nderson\u2013Darling test statistic in Fig. 3 , and show the critical values or different significance levels in the caption. We are thus driven to nvestigate whether the residuals can be fitted by high-order effects.\nThe first high-order effect is the microlensing parallax effect Gould 2000 ), which is due to the orbital acceleration of Earth observer). We parametrize the effect by two parameters, \u03c0E, N and\nE, E , the north and east components of the microlensing parallax ector \u03c0E in equatorial coordinates,\nE \u2261 \u03c0rel \u03b8E \u03bcrel \u03bcrel . (3)\nhe second effect is the lens orbital motion (Dominik 1998a ; Batista t al. 2011 ; Skowron et al. 2011 ), which is described by two\nMNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nM\nNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nFigure 3. The Quantile\u2013Quantile plots and the Anderson\u2013Darling test results for different models. The sample quantiles are calculated with the normalized residuals during 8720 < HJD \u2032 < 8780 (263 data points in total). The theoretical quantiles are calculated for a standard normal distribution. The red lines show the equality lines. The labelled red value at each panel shows the value of the normalized two-sample Anderson-Darling test statistic. The first sample contains 263 normalized residuals, while the second sample contains 10 7 random values drawn from the standard normal distribution. The critical values for significance levels (25 per cent, 10 per cent, 5 per cent, 2.5 per cent, 1 per cent, 0.5 per cent, 0.1 per cent) are (0.325, 1.226, 1.961, 2.718, 3.752, 4.592, 6.546), respectiv ely. F or the \u20182L1S Static\u2019 model, the Anderson\u2013 Darling test statistic 4.775 is larger than the critical value for 0.5 per cent (4.592), but smaller than the critical value for 0.1 per cent (6.546). So the null hypothesis that the normalized residuals of the \u20182L1S Static\u2019 model follow the standard normal distribution can be rejected at the 0.5 per cent significance lev el. F or the 2L2S and 3L1S models, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. We used the Python packages statsmodels (Seabold & Perktold 2010 ) and scipy (Virtanen et al. 2020 ).\np a m t k\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\nw m e \u2018\ns o a b \u2018 s 8\nt b b e r t o 1 l G l f f (\n3\nR p m s \u03c8 a q M c w c 2 i t a a t t m\n3\nF c g 2 t fi r m g t o i a e e A t\np D a 3\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/1704/6671550 by U niversity of W arw ick user on 17 O ctober 2022\narameters, d s/ d t and d \u03b1/ d t , the rates of instantaneous changes t t 0 of the binary separation and orientation. We find that the orbital otion effect is poorly constrained and thus restrict the MCMC trials o \u03b2 < 1.0, where \u03b2 is the absolute value of the ratio of transverse inetic to potential energy (An et al. 2002 ; Dong et al. 2009a ), \u2261 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223KE \u22a5 PE \u22a5 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u03baM yr 2 8 \u03c02 \u03c0E \u03b8E \u03b3 2 ( s \u03c0E + \u03c0S /\u03b8E )3 ; \u2261 ( d s/ d t s , d \u03b1 d t ) , (4)\nhere we adopt \u03c0S = 0.13 mas for parallax of the source based on the ean distance to red giant stars in the direction of this event (Nataf\nt al. 2013 ). We also consider the u 0 > 0 and u 0 < 0 solutions to the ecliptic de generac y\u2019 (Jiang et al. 2004 ; Poinde xter et al. 2005 ).\nThe parameters from the MCMC and the best-fitting model are hown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 , respectively. We find that the inclusion f high-order effects impro v es the fit by \u03c72 80. However, there re still unexplained features in this model. For example, the smooth ump in the observed data peaks at around HJD \u2032 = 8746, while both 2L1S Static\u2019 and \u20182L1S High-order\u2019 models peak at HJD \u2032 \u223c 8750, o they predict a higher magnification than what is observed during 747 < HJD \u2032 < 8752. The upper right-hand panel of Fig. 3 shows\nhe Q\u2013Q plot of this model, in which the sample quantiles agree etter with the theoretical quantiles than the static 2L1S model, ut still deviate from the standard normal distribution at the low nd. From the Anderson\u2013Darling test, the null hypothesis that the esiduals follow the standard normal distribution can be rejected at he 5 per cent significance lev el. Moreo v er, according to the analysis f Section 4 , the \u03b8E and \u03c0E values of this model indicate a M L 5 M J , \u03bcrel \u223c 0 . 8 mas yr \u22121 lens system in the Galactic disc. The low ens-source relative proper motion is of fairly low probability in the alactic dynamical model (see fig. 2 of Zhu et al. 2017 ), and the very ow-mass lens would be rare in the context of standard stellar mass unctions (e.g. Kroupa 2001 ). Hence, we consider models involving our objects, i.e. 3L1S (Section 3.2 ) and binary-lens binary-source 2L2S) (Section 3.3 ).\n.2 3L1S analysis\nelative to the 2L1S model, the 3L1S model has three additional arameters ( s 3 , q 3 , \u03c8) to describe the third body M 3 (the smallest ass in our convention). Here s 3 and q 3 respectively represent the eparation in units of \u03b8E and mass ratio between M 1 and M 3 , and denotes the orientation angle of M 3 measured from the M 1 - M 2 xis as seen from M 1 . To a v oid confusion, from now on we use s 2 , 2 to represent the separation and mass ratio of M 2 to M 1 , i.e. q 2 = 2 / M 1 . Due to the high-dimensional parameter space, it would be omputationally e xpensiv e to conduct a grid search to explore the hole parameter space. Fortunately, the anomalies in the present ase can be approximately described by the superposition of two L1S perturbations (Bozza 1999 ; Han et al. 2001 ; Han 2005 ). That s, the smooth bump at t 1 and the caustic-crossing feature between 2 and t 3 can each be fitted by separate 2L1S models. Under this pproximation, we conduct 2L1S modelling for two data subsets. In ddition, we also tried other combinations of ( t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) and found that he resulting 3L1S models are disfa v oured by \u03c72 80 relative to he combination adopted here. For completeness, we describe those\nodels in Section 3.2.2 .\n.2.1 A bump versus a pair of caustic crossings\nor the first data subset, we exclude the data around the causticrossing feature, i.e. 8752 < HJD \u2032 < 8762. We conduct a 2L1S rid search and then refine the solutions by the MCMC with all L1S parameters free. We restrict the blended flux f B, OGLE > \u22120.2 o exclude solutions with severe negative blended flux. We find ve solutions and designate them as \u2018Binary A\u2019 to \u2018Binary E\u2019, espectively. Their parameters are presented in Table 3 , and their odel light curves are shown in Fig. 4 . Based on the caustic eometries and source trajectories shown in Fig. 5 , we find that he solutions \u2018Binary A\u2019 to \u2018Binary D\u2019 can be regarded as two pairs f solutions with s 2 > 1 and s 2 < 1. For the solution \u2018Binary E\u2019, ts source trajectory is almost parallel to the binary axis, and such geometry has been disco v ered in sev eral previous cases (e.g. Han t al. 2017 ; Zhang et al. 2020 ).

Their caustic structure and magnification maps together ith the source trajectories are shown in Fig. 6 . The model light\nNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nurve of the best-fit 3L1S solution (\u20183L1S A\u2019) is shown in Fig. 2 . he combination of the solution \u2018Binary E\u2019 and the planetary model annot produce a 3L1S model that explains all the anomalies, and he resulting model from the MCMC is one of the 3L1S solutions rom another combination of ( t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ). We thus exclude this 3L1S olution which corresponds to \u2018Binary E\u2019.\nWe note that some of the reported 3L1S model parameters and ncertainties (Table 4 ) may be different from the 2L1S models Table 3 ) they are built upon. For example, the values of u 0 are ifferent for \u2018Binary D\u2019 in Table 3 and \u20183L1S D\u2019 in Table 4 . This s because by adding a planetary mass into the binary models, arameters like t E , u 0 are better constrained by the caustic crossing eature in the light curve caused by the planet mass. Other parameters ould also be constrained better since parameters are correlated. ctually, after obtaining the 2L1S models for each data subset, one ould further do a joint fit before 3L1S modelling. Because for each air of \u2018Binary\u2019 and \u2018Planetary\u2019 models, they should have at least the ame t E and \u03c1.\nWe find that the inclusion of high-order effects impro v e the fit by \u03c72 3 and the 1 \u03c3 uncertainty of parallax is \u03c3 ( \u03c0E, ) 0.2 and ( \u03c0E, \u22a5 ) 1.0, where \u03c0E, and \u03c0E, \u22a5 are the component of \u03c0E that is arallel and perpendicular with the direction of Earth\u2019s acceleration. n addition, the other 3L1S parameters are consistent with those of he static 3L1S models at 1 \u03c3 . Such a weak constraint on \u03c0E has ittle effect ( < 5 per cent ) on the physical parameters derived from he Bayesian analysis in Section 4.2 . Hence, we adopt the static 3L1S\nodels as the final results.\n.2.2 Other combinations of features\nurrently, the solutions of most known 3L1S events were found by he superposition of two 2L1S perturbations. The strategy of finding L1S models from combinations of 2L1S models is mainly arrived t by inspecting the features of the observed light curve. If the data o v erage of each anomaly is good and thus the shape of each anomaly s clear, then the combinations are relativ ely straightforward. F or xample, the two planetary signals of the 3L1S event OGLE-2012LG-0026 (Han et al. 2013 ) clearly consist of a bump and a dip, so nly one combination of light curve features is feasible. Ho we ver, in he present case, the co v erage at the caustic crossings of the \u2018U shape\u2019 nomaly ( t 2 and t 3 ) is sparse, so it raises the question of whether or ot other combinations of ( t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) can yield a reasonable 3L1S olution.\nTable 4. 3L1S lensing parameters together with \u03b8\u2217 and \u03b8E .\nParameter A ( s 2 < 1) B ( s 2 > 1) C ( s 2 < 1) D ( s 2 > 1) Best fit MCMC Best fit MCMC Best fit MCMC Best fit MCMC \u03c72 / dof 1121.45/1121 1124.81/1121 1126.78/1121 1126.26/1121\nt 0 (HJD \u2032 ) 8751.021 8751 . 032 + 0 . 190 \u22120 . 173 8741.156 8739 . 940 + 1 . 680 \u22122 . 020 8753.446 8753 . 262 + 0 . 212 \u22120 . 195 8718.708 8716 . 294 + 4 . 161 \u22123 . 698 u 0 0.187 0 . 192 + 0 . 018 \u22120 . 011 \u22120.049 \u22120 . 068 + 0 . 032 \u22120 . 036 0.295 0 . 285 + 0 . 016 \u22120 . 018 0.936 0 . 962 + 0 . 053 \u22120 . 051 t E (days) 42.595 41 . 725 + 1 . 827 \u22123 . 111 45.378 46 . 890 + 2 . 544 \u22122 . 113 36.243 36 . 302 + 1 . 340 \u22120 . 880 55.622 56 . 037 + 2 . 599 \u22121 . 990 s 2 0.439 0 . 446 + 0 . 021 \u22120 . 017 2.749 2 . 786 + 0 . 085 \u22120 . 083 0.457 0 . 451 + 0 . 012 \u22120 . 013 2.700 2 . 768 + 0 . 094 \u22120 . 078 q 2 0.359 0 . 322 + 0 . 088 \u22120 . 073 0.173 0 . 180 + 0 . 023 \u22120 . 020 0.975 1 . 019 + 0 . 185 \u22120 . 200 0.695 0 . 708 + 0 . 061 \u22120 . 065 \u03b1 (rad) 3.900 3 . 890 + 0 . 029 \u22120 . 026 3.913 3 . 888 + 0 . 045 \u22120 . 037 2.416 2 . 424 + 0 . 021 \u22120 . 062 2.234 2 . 238 + 0 . 042 \u22120 . 036 s 3 1.108 1 . 112 + 0 . 017 \u22120 . 011 1.059 1 . 053 + 0 . 009 \u22120 . 010 1.019 1 . 011 + 0 . 016 \u22120 . 020 0.870 0 . 867 + 0 . 014 \u22120 . 014 q 3 (10 \u22123 ) 3.472 3 . 878 + 1 . 132 \u22120 . 545 4.953 5 . 149 + 0 . 604 \u22120 . 501 8.643 9 . 359 + 1 . 676 \u22121 . 400 4.275 3 . 996 + 0 . 391 \u22120 . 421 \u03c8 (rad) 4.993 4 . 998 + 0 . 034 \u22120 . 032 5.184 5 . 153 + 0 . 057 \u22120 . 050 4.093 4 . 087 + 0 . 033 \u22120 . 087 3.615 3 . 609 + 0 . 054 \u22120 . 055 \u03c1(10 \u22122 ) 0.121 < 1 . 148 (3 \u03c3 ) 0.885 < 1 . 138 (3 \u03c3 ) 0.928 < 1 . 321 (3 \u03c3 ) 0.572 < 0 . 955 (3 \u03c3 ) f S, OGLE 0.158 0 . 163 + 0 . 021 \u22120 . 010 0.181 0 . 171 + 0 . 018 \u22120 . 018 0.247 0 . 242 + 0 . 012 \u22120 . 015 0.194 0 . 193 + 0 . 015 \u22120 . 019 f B, OGLE 0.290 0 . 285 + 0 . 010 \u22120 . 021 0.267 0 . 278 + 0 . 018 \u22120 . 018 0.201 0 . 207 + 0 . 015 \u22120 . 012 0.253 0 . 254 + 0 . 019 \u22120 . 016 \u03b8\u2217 ( \u00b5as) 0.62 0 . 63 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 06 0.66 0 . 64 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 08 0.78 0 . 77 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 08 0.69 0 . 69 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 09 \u03b8E (mas) 0.51 > 0 . 055 (3 \u03c3 ) 0.075 > 0 . 056 (3 \u03c3 ) 0.084 > 0 . 058 (3 \u03c3 ) 0.12 > 0 . 072 (3 \u03c3 )\nFigure 6.

We exclude data around t 3 , i.e. 754 . 5 < HJD \u2032 < 8757 . 5. Ho we ver, we cannot find any 2L1S model hat can explain the remaining data. Thus, this approach is infeasible.\nAlthough our attempts abo v e did not yield a new competitive L1S solution and the anomalies at t 2 and t 3 together indeed form a U shape\u2019, one may need to be cautious about the strategies of 2L1S ombinations with numerous 3L1S events detected by the ongoing MTNet surv e y and the Nanc y Grace Roman Space Telescope Spergel et al. 2015 ; Penny et al. 2019 ) in the future. We note that in finding 3L1S solutions, we tried only the supposiion method and have not conducted a thorough grid search o v er the L1S parameter space. We believe there is little chance for this event o have other 3L1S solutions. We have already tested all combinations f anomaly features in the abo v e sections and conducted thorough rid searches for both the binary and planetary 2L1S models that\nNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nan produce the anomaly features in the observed light curve. In this vent, the planet ( M 3 ) with mass-ratio q 3 \u223c 10 \u22123 has little effect on he caustic of the binary ( M 1 and M 2 ). So the binary-superposition\nethod would be valid for this event.\n.3 2L2S analysis\nhere have been several events with plausible 3L1S planetary olutions that pro v ed to be 2L2S ev ents (e.g. Jung et al. 2017 ) or av e competitiv e 2L2S solutions (e.g. Suzuki et al. 2018 ).

To include the econd source, we require four additional parameters, ( t 0, 2 , u 0, 2 , \u03c12 , ratio, I ) (Hwang et al. 2013 ). t 0, 2 is the time at which the second ource is closest to the centre of mass of the lens, u 0, 2 is the lensource separation at that time, \u03c12 is the normalized radius of the econd source, and f ratio, I is the source flux ratio in the I -band. e use the best-fitting parameters of the static 2L1S model as he initial parameters of ( t 0, 1 , u 0, 1 , t E , s , q , \u03b1, \u03c11 ), and use the CMC method to generate samples from the posterior distribution, nd search for the best-fitting 2L2S model with the Nelder\u2013Mead lgorithm.\nTable 6 lists the parameters of the 2L2S model, Fig. 2 shows ts model curve and its residuals. It is found that the 2L2S model rovides a better fit than the 2L1S model by \u03c72 = 126. The oodness of fit impro v ed because the second source is relatively delayed\u2019 compared with the first source. Fig. 9 shows the trajectories f the two sources. At time t 1 , the first source is nearly at its closest pproach to the primary lens, thus would cause a strong bump, as is he case in the static 2L1S model. In the mean time, the second source s located at the low magnification region between two spikes, which auses the total magnification at time t 1 to be lower and impro v es he goodness of fit. The 2L2S model has a \u03c72 18 compared o the 3L1S model, the \u03c72 is mainly accumulated at time around he caustic crossing region. See Fig. 10 for the cumulative \u03c72\nFigure 10.

However, we annot firmly resolve the degeneracy between this model and the L1S models with the current data.

We list \u03b8\u2217 of each 3L1S solutions n Table 4 . .2 Bayesian analysis he Galactic model used for the Bayesian analysis has three parts: he mass function of the lens, the stellar number density profile and he dynamical distributions. For the lens mass function, we apply he initial mass function (IMF) of Kroupa ( 2001 ) and add a 1.3M nd 1.1M upper-end truncation for the disc and the bulge lenses, espectively Zhu et al. ( 2017 ). For the stellar number density, we hoose the models used by Yang et al. ( 2021 ). For the disc velocity istribution, we use the \u2018Model C\u2019 of Yang et al. ( 2021 ), which is ynamically self-consistent with the density profile. For the bulge ynamical distributions, we adopt the model used by Zhu et al. 2017 ) and assume that the bulge stars have a zero mean velocity and 20 km s \u22121 velocity dispersion along each direction. We create a sample of 10 8 simulated events drawn from the alactic model. For each simulated event, i , whose parameters onsist of \u03b8E, i , \u03bcrel, i , and t E, i , we weight it by\nGal ,i = \u03b8E ,i \u00d7 \u03bcrel ,i \u00d7 L ( t E ,i ) L ( \u03b8E ,i ) . (8) here L ( t E ,i ) is the probability of t E, i given the error distributions f t E derived from the MCMC chain, and L ( \u03b8E ,i ) is the probability f \u03b8E, i . To derive the probability distribution of \u03b8E , we first draw he probability distribution of \u03c1 by the lower envelope of \u03c72 versus\ndiagram from MCMC. See fig. 6 of Jung et al. ( 2020 ) for an xample. Then, we create a sample of 10 6 simulated \u03b8E using the \u03c1 istribution and the \u03b8\u2217 distribution from the CMD analysis, which ields the probability distribution of \u03b8E . Here, we only consider the rimary lens alone, so t E, i and \u03b8E, i are a factor of \u221a 1 + q 2 + q 3 maller than the values defined for the triple system. In Table 7 , we summarize the posterior distributions (the median, 6 per cent, and 84 per cent quantiles) of the physical lens parameters, ncluding the masses of the three lens components, ( M 1 , M 2 , M 3 ),\nNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nhe projected separation of M 2 and M 3 to the position of M 1 , ( r \u22a5 , 2 nd r \u22a5 , 3 ), the distance to the lens system, D L , and the lens-source elative proper motion, \u03bcrel . We find that the four solutions all consist f a super-Jovian planet in a binary system, but the interpretations f their planetary orbits are different. The ratios of the projected emimajor axes in all four cases are very close to or exceed the onditions for stability (Holman & Wiegert 1999 ). Of course, the rojected semimajor axes are only the minimum separations between he primary and its companions. The stellar companion can lie ubstantially inside the planet orbit (P-type orbit), or outside of the lanet orbit (S-type orbit). As with many Kepler planets orbiting inaries (the first w as Do yle et al. 2011 , see Martin & F abryck y 021 for a complete list), detectability considerations create a bias oward planets near (in the case of Kepler) or appearing to be near in the case of microlensing) the stability limits (Madsen & Zhu 019 ). Thus, the most likely interpretation for the solutions \u20183L1S \u2019 and \u20183L1S C\u2019, the planet likely orbits the barycentre of a close tellar binary, i.e. a P-type orbit and a circumbinary planet. For the olutions \u20183L1S B\u2019 and \u20183L1S D\u2019, the planet probably orbits the more assive companion of the stellar binary, i.e. a S-type orbit. Ho we ver, e cannot rule out configurations for any of the four solutions in hich the relative locations of the companions are reversed with espect to the primary.\nDI SCUSSI ON\nhe light curve of the microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-1470 hows three distinct features. The first is a smooth bump generated y cusp approach, the other two features originate from a resonant austic crossing. Our analysis indicates that this event could be xplained either by a 3L1S model or by a slightly worse 2L2S odel. The 2L2S model is disfa v oured by \u03c72 18 relative to he best-fitting 3L1S model, its cumulative \u03c72 relative to the besttting 3L1S model rises mainly during the caustic crossing region. o we ver, we cannot firmly rule out the 2L2S model with statistical ests. These degenerate models would be resolved if there were highadence observations o v er the peak region.\nIn this event, the planet manifests itself by generating a resonant austic which allows forming a detectable anomaly feature when the ource passes through the caustic. This is similar to events OGLE016-BLG-0613 (Han et al. 2017 ) and OGLE-2018-BLG-1700 (Han t al. 2020 ). Planets are still detectable even with small planetary austics. Actually, this includes a substantial fraction of microlensing lanets in binary systems, such as in events OGLE-2006-BLG-284 Bennett et al. 2020 ), OGLE-2008-BLG-092 (Poleski et al. 2014 ), GLE-2013-BLG-0341 (Gould et al. 2014 ), and KMT-2019-BLG715 (Han et al. 2021a ). It seems that the second case (planetary austics) happens more frequently. Ho we ver, it is not clear whether\nFigure 12. (log s , log q ) diagram for microlensing planetary events adapted from fig. 11 of Yee et al. ( 2021 ). The black points represent planets around a single star. Magenta and red colours, respectively represent planets in binary systems detected during 2006\u20132015 and since 2016. The asterisk is the planet found in this paper, and we adopt the parameters of the best-fit 3L1S solution (\u20183L1S A\u2019). Solutions are considered to be \u2018unique\u2019 (filled points), if there are no competing solutions within \u03c72 < 10. Otherwise, they are shown by pairs of open circles linked by a line segment. 10 planets are excluded because their q differs by more than a factor of two. The two green solid lines represent the boundaries between resonant and non-resonant caustics using equation (59) of Dominik ( 1999 ), and the two green dashed lines depict the boundaries for \u2018near-resonant\u2019 caustics proposed by Yee et al.

The 3L1S model of OGLE-2019-BLG-0304 includes a planet with planet-to-host mass ratio q = 1.82 \u00b1 0.26 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The planet also generates a resonant caustic. 9 This planet was also included as one of the six planets used to statistically investigate the frequency of solar-like systems and of ice and gas giants (Gould et al. 2010 ). The authors have realized that the OGLE-2007-BLG349 system contains a third body, but difficult to fully characterize at that time.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/1704/6671550 by U niversity of W arw ick user on 17 O ctober 2022\nhis is due to the sample size being small or due to other reasons. On he one hand, the parameter space for generating planetary caustics is arger than that for generating resonant caustics. On the other hand, he sensitivity to planet is higher when there is a resonant caustic. he relative fraction will of course depend on the intrinsic properties f planets in binary systems in the Galaxy. From the theoretical side, t is worth studying the detection probabilities of planets in different onfigurations of binary systems.\nIncluding the candidate lens system, OGLE-2019-BLG470LABc, reported in this paper, eight microlensing planets in inary systems have been detected. In Fig. 12 , we plot them together ith other published microlensing planets in the log q versus log s lane. We separate the eight planets in binary systems into two roups. The magenta points represent the planets detected before 016, while the red ones are the planets found since 2016. We nd that the disco v ery rate of planets in binary systems has at least oubled since 2016. This is mainly due to the regular operation of MTNet since 2016 because KMTNet played a major role in all four isco v eries since 2016. Ho we ver, the two groups exhibit different properties in two spects: planet-to-host mass ratios and the types of caustic. For the our planets detected before 2016, all of them are located outside the ear-resonant range (Yee et al. 2021 ) with planet-to-host mass ratios og q < \u22122.8. As illustrated by Zang et al. ( 2021 ), wide-area highadence surv e ys are sensitiv e to planets outside the near-resonant ange, which is consistent with the detection channels for the four lanets in binary systems detected before 2016. Three of them were etected by a pure-surv e y mode by OGLE and the Microlensing\nbservations in Astrophysics (MOA, Sumi et al. 2016 ) experiments, nd OGLE-2007-BLG-349LABc was found by a combination of urv e y and follow-up. Because KMTNet is more powerful than the revious surv e ys, it is e xpected that KMTNet is sensitive to planets ut of the near-resonant range for all mass-ratio regions. Ho we ver, he four planets 8 since 2016 were all detected by a resonant-caustic hannel with planet-to-host mass ratios q 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .\nThis contradiction is similar to the \u2018missing planetary caustics\u2019 roblem advocated by Zang et al. ( 2021 ), but it is more severe onsidering the lack of low mass-ratio (log q < \u22123) planets. The our detections before 2016 suggest that low-mass-ratio planets in inary systems are not rare, and the \u223c20 low-mass-ratio planets in ingle systems detected by KMTNet have demonstrated its sensitivity o them. Therefore, the problem is likely due to the way we search or planetary signals in binary systems. Indeed, this is pro v en to be he case for planets orbiting a single star: the advent of systematic MTNet planetary anomaly searches has started to yield more lanets with planetary caustic crossings (Zang et al. 2021 , 2022 ; ould et al. 2022 ; Hwang et al. 2022 ; Wang et al. 2022 ). These ystematic anomaly searches not only increase the total number f known microlensing planets, but also provide complete and omogeneous statistical planetary samples for the studying of, e.g. he planet-to-host mass ratio function.\nPreviously, the largest such sample was obtained from the widerea, high-cadence Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics II MOA-II) surv e y from 2007 to 2012 (Suzuki et al. 2016 ). The authors ound 23 planets out of 1474 microlensing events with a broken ower law for the planet-to-host mass ratio function. Combining lanets from two previous studies (Gould et al. 2010 ; Cassan et al. 012 ), they built a sample of 30 planets and found that the power aw breaks at mass ratio q br \u2261 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , i.e. cold Neptunes are ikely the most common type of planets beyond the snow line (for ate dwarfs). Furthermore, a statistical work based on long period 2 yr) transiting planet candidates from the prime Kepler mission ound a compatible result that the long-period Neptune-sized planets re at least as common as the Jupiter-sized ones (for FGK dwarfs, awahara & Masuda 2019 ). The authors pointed out that it is ssential to quantify the completeness of smaller planets to facilitate ore detailed comparisons. We note that there are two microlensing events of planet in binary ystem during 2007-2012. The first is OGLE-2007-BLG-349 (MOA007-BLG-379, Bennett et al. 2016 ), which contains a planet with ass ratio q 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . This planet was included as one of the 23 lanets in the statistical study of Suzuki et al. ( 2016 ). 9 The second vent, OGLE-2008-BLG-092 (Poleski et al. 2014 ), is not a MOA vent. The fraction of planets in binary systems appears to be low 1/23) in the sample of Suzuki et al. ( 2016 ).\nHo we ver, as more planets in binary systems are disco v ered, one ay need to be cautious about whether these planets can be included n such statistical studies. For the KMTNet data, the AnomalyFinder lgorithm is efficient in unco v ering the buried planetary signals (Zang t al. 2021 ), including signals from low-mass ratio ( q 10 \u22124 ) planets\nMNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nM\n( b a s b i K a c o H m o m O t W\nA\nW i W o t S o b o a a S s t a r t A u t\nD\nT t\nR\nA A A\nA A A A\nA B B B B B\nB B B B B\nB C C\nC C C\nD D D D D D D D\nD D F\nG G G G G G G G G G H H H H H H H H\nH H H H J J J J J\nK K K K K K K\nK K L L\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/1704/6671550 by U niversity of W arw ick user on 17 O ctober 2022\nHwang et al. 2022 ). But the AnomalyFinder algorithm has not een applied to KMTNet binary events to find potential planetary nomalies. The lack of planetary caustics in the current KMTNet ample of planets in binary systems indicates that this sample may e incomplete. Thus, these planets (in binaries) cannot be included n the current study of KMTNet mass-ratio function. Systematic MTNet planetary anomaly searches for planets in binary systems re therefore needed. With the successful implementation of the urrent KMTNet AnomalyFinder algorithm, one may naturally think f applying this algorithm to the residuals of 2L1S light curves. o we ver, this approach requires a significant effort on careful 2L1S odelling (about 200 events per year) with the inclusion of highrder effects (parallax and orbital motion of the stellar binary) in any cases, as well as substantial additional work for data reductions. n the other hand, the reward is also rich because it will give, for he first time, the statistics of microlensing planets in binary systems. e plan to pursue this in the future.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee Daniel Bramich for a critical report that mpro v ed the paper significantly.

Previous studies showed that the agnification of a triple-lens system which contains two planets an be calculated as the summation of the magnifications from two inary-lens systems (binary superposition). This is valid for high agnification cases (Rattenbury et al. 2002 ; Ryu, Chang & Park 011 ) as well as for both planetary caustics (Han et al. 2001 ) and entral caustics (Han 2005 ).\nFor the case of a planet in a binary-star system, the superposition f magnifications is no longer valid. In Han et al. ( 2001 ), they found hat if the heavier companion mass ratios 0.05, the magnification eviation from the binary superposition becomes considerable. An ntuitiv e e xplanation is that the caustics produced by the planet will e easily affected by the binary-star system. Instead of seeking for alid superposition for magnification calculations, we expect that in ome cases, topologically the o v erall caustic structure corresponding o the planet remains the same after we add the planet component to binary-star model. In this case, the binary superposition is \u2018valid\u2019 n the sense that the caustic structure required to produce all anomaly eatures in the light curve still exist. The resulting triple-lens model an be taken as an initial approximation for more accurate modelling.\nNow we investigate how to combine two binary-lens models to orm an initial triple-lens model. Specifically, we focus on combining binary-star model and a planetary model. Readers who are not nterested in the technical details can directly go to appendix A3 hich gives a short recipe for the procedures. We denote the parameters of the binary-star model and the lanetary model as ( t 0, B , u 0, B , t E, B , \u03c1B , s B , q B , \u03b1B ) and ( t 0, c , u 0, c , t E, c , c , s c , q c , \u03b1c ), respectively. 10 The goal is to obtain the parameters ( t 0 , 0 , t E , \u03c1, s 2 , q 2 , s 3 , q 3 , \u03b1, \u03c8) of the triple-lens system. For parameters ther than ( s 3 , q 3 , \u03c8), we use the same values as the binary-star ystem:\nt 0 , u 0 , t E , \u03c1, s 2 , q 2 , \u03b1) = ( t 0 , B , u 0 , B , t E , B , \u03c1B , s B , q B , \u03b1B ) , (A1) ince the extra planet would not change these parameters signifiantly. We derive the remaining parameters, i.e. ( s 3 , q 3 , \u03c8) from the wo binary-lens models.\nWe designate the masses of the three lens objects as M 1 , M 2 , and M 3 with M 1 > M 2 > M 3 and 3 i= 1 M i = 1). We use the same coordinate ystem as in Kuang et al. ( 2021 ). M 1 and M 2 are located along the orizontal axis, and their centre of mass is the origin. Specifically, heir masses and positions ( x i , y i ) are:\n1 = 1 / (1 + q 2 + q 3 ) , M 2 = q 2 M 1 , M 3 = q 3 M 1 , x 1 = \u2212q 2 s 2 / (1 + q 2 ) , y 1 = 0 , x 2 = s 2 / (1 + q 2 ) , y 2 = 0 , x 3 = x 1 + s 3 cos \u03c8, y 3 = y 1 + s 3 sin \u03c8.

In the upper left-hand panel, we show the first binary-lens model M 1 \u2013M 2 with parameters ( s B , q B , \u03b1B ) = (0.439, 0.359, 223 \u25e6), produces a diamond-shaped caustic (in blue) near the origin. The lower left-hand panel shows the second binary-lens model with parameters ( s c , q c , \u03b1c ) = (1.108, 3.472 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 293 \u25e6), which produces a resonant caustic (in green). The right-hand panel shows the resulting triple-lens model constructed by combining the two binary-lens models in the left-hand panel. The red curve shows the caustics of the triple-lens model. The blue curve is the same caustic as in the upper left-hand panel, the green curve is plotted by rotating by an angle so that it lies on the line (dashed magenta) connecting M 3 and the origin. The black dots are the lenses. The black solid lines with arrows show the source trajectories.\nw\nA\nF a\nq\nF s h I b r c f\nl l c h\nm t T o\ns A j\nw a M s\ni t e\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/1704/6671550 by U niversity of W arw ick user on 17 O ctober 2022 We show two example cases, corresponding to close ( s B < 1) and ide ( s B > 1) binary-star system, respectively. 1 Close binary-star system ( s B < 1) or the first case, ( s c , q c ) of the planetary lens system can be taken s ( s 3 , q 3 ), and \u03c8 calculated by subtracting \u03b1c from \u03b1B ,\ns 3 = s c , 3 = q c , \u03c8 = \u03b1B \u2212 \u03b1c . (A3) ig. A1 shows the related geometries. The upper left-hand panel hows the caustics (in blue) of the binary-star model. The lower leftand panel shows the caustics (in green) of the planetary model. n the right-hand panel, the red curve is the caustics produced y the resulting triple-lens model. The o v erall caustic structure emain the same as the two individual binary-lens models. So, the ombined triple-lens model can be taken as an initial model for urther optimising.\nWe note that the caustic corresponding to M 3 is not along the ine connecting M 3 and M 1 (the orange dashed line), but close to a ine (the magenta dashed line) connecting M 3 and the origin, i.e. the entre of mass of M 1 \u2013M 2 . So, one can regard M 1 \u2013M 2 as a whole and as a net effect on M 3 . In this case, the position and planet-to-host\nNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nass ratio of the planet, parametrized with ( s c , q c , \u03c8) are relative to he \u2018ef fecti ve\u2019 mass of M 1 \u2013M 2 , instead of being relative only to M 1 . he extreme case is that s B \u2192 0, i.e. M 1 and M 2 are merged into one bject. The ef fecti ve lensing position of a component in the binary lens ystem is shifted toward its companion (Di Stefano & Mao 1996 ; n & Han 2002 ). A lens component i will shift toward its companion\nby an amount (Chung et al. 2005 ):\nx L,i\u2192 j M j /M i ( s + s \u22121 ) / ( \u03b8E , i /\u03b8E ) \u03b8E , i \u03b8E , (A4)\nhere M i , M j are the masses of the individual lens components, \u03b8E, i nd \u03b8E are the Einstein ring radius corresponding to M i and M i + j , respectively. In our case, the effective lensing position of M 1 will hift toward M 2 by an amount of\nx 1 \u2192 2 q B ( s B + s \u22121 B )(1 + q B ) \u2248 s B q B 1 + q B , (A5)\n.e. for the case of s B < 1, the ef fecti ve lensing position of M 1 is close o the centre of mass of M 1 and M 2 . If we regard M 1 and M 2 are f fecti vely located at the origin with a mass M 1 + M 2 , then we have\nFigure A2. The same as Fig. A1 . The binary-star M 1 \u2013M 2 are in wide orbit that ( s B , q B , \u03b1B ) = (2.700, 0.695, 128 \u25e6). The planetary lens system in the bottom left-hand panel is the same as in Fig. A1 . The green curve in the right-hand panel is plotted by rotating an angle and then shifting leftwards so that it lies in the line connecting M 3 and the geometric centre (calculate numerically, x \u2248 \u22120.955) of the diamond-shaped caustic near M 1 .\nt\nM\nw m\nq\np a S\nA\nF H s + i M\nu\nq\nI a t M t c p o o a e\nF t\nx\nw g\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/1704/6671550 by U niversity of W arw ick user on 17 O ctober 2022 he following relations, 2 /M 1 = q B , M 3 / ( M 1 + M 2 ) = q c , 3 i= 1 M i = 1 , \u03c8 0 = \u03b1B \u2212 \u03b1c , x 3 = s c cos \u03c8 0 , y 3 = s c sin \u03c8 0 , (A6) here \u03c8 0 \u2261 \u2220 M 2 OM 3 , O is the origin. We can derive ( s 3 , q 3 , \u03c8) to atch our coordinate definition as 3 = q c (1 + q B ) , s 3 = \u221a ( x 3 \u2212 x 1 ) 2 + ( y 3 \u2212 y 1 ) 2 , \u03c8 = arctan (( y 3 \u2212 y 1 ) / ( x 3 \u2212 x 1 )) . (A7) Equations ( A3 ) and ( A7 ) are two different ways of adding a\nlanetary mass component into an existing binary-star model. For close binary system, the resulting caustics have similar structure. o both equations are valid for obtaining an initial triple-lens model.\n2 Wide binary-star system ( s B > 1)\nor the second case, q c of the planetary model can be taken as q 3 . o we ver, we cannot simply take s c as s 3 . This is because M 2 has maller effect on M 3 when s B > 1. The extreme case is that s B \u2192 \u221e . In the planetary 2L1S model, the total mass \u223cM 1 + M 3 , while n the resultant 3L1S model, the total mass equals to M 1 + M 2 + 3 , they correspond to different \u03b8E \u2019s. So considering s c and s 3 are in\nnits of different \u03b8E \u2019s, we have\ns 3 = s c \u221a\n(1 + q c ) / (1 + q c + q B ) , 3 = q c , \u03c8 = \u03b1B \u2212 \u03b1c . (A8) n this way we can retain the caustic structure produced by the planet, s shown in Fig. A2 . Similar to the previous case in appendix A1 , he caustic corresponding to M 3 is also not along the line connecting 3 and M 1 (the orange dashed line). Instead, the caustic lies close to he line (the magenta dashed line) connecting M 3 and the geometric entre of the diamond-shaped caustic (the one close to M 1 ). The osition of this geometric centre (the mean values of the coordinates f all points at that caustic) is calculated numerically after we btained the caustic shown in the upper left-hand panel. We can lso estimate the ef fecti ve lensing position of M 1 in this case, as in quation ( A5 ),\nx 1 \u2192 2 q B ( s B + s \u22121 B )(1 + q B ) \u2248 q B s B (1 + q B ) . (A9)\nor the e xample case shown in Fig. A2 , ( s B , q B ) = (2.700, 0.695), he ef fecti ve lensing position of M 1 is:\n1 + x 1 \u2192 2 = \u2212 q B s B 1 + q B +\nq B\ns B (1 + q B ) \u2248 \u22120 . 955 , (A10)\nhich is exactly equal to the position of the numerically calculated eometric centre of the diamond-shaped caustic near M 1 .\nMNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nM\np\nT F r fi ( a l t\nA\nI c p w a\n(\nO \u03c1 q\nt l c m f (\n(iv) Finally, in both example cases, the planet has little effect on the caustics produced by the binary star. On the other hand, the caustics produced by the planet can be easily affected by the binarystar system. After obtaining the rough parameters for a triple model and before further optimisation, one may need to manually fine-tune the triple-lens parameters (mainly on s 3 , q 3 , \u03c8) to adjust the caustics to the desired position.\n1 Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China 2 Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China 3 Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, Daejon 34055, Republic of Korea 4 University of Science and Technology, 217 Gajeong-ro Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea 5 Astronomical Observatory, University of Warsaw, Al.

Besides, in triple-lens system, the location nd mass of the third lens ( M 3 ) need to be taken into account. We eave the determination of the ef fecti ve lensing position and mass of he M 1 \u2013M 2 binary system, as seen from M 3 , as a future work.\n3 Recipe\nn Appendixes A1 \u2013A2 , we give detailed justifications for how to ombine two 2L1S models. Here we give a short recipe of the rocedures to obtain an initial triple-lens model applicable to the case here a light curve shows distinct anomalies from a binary system nd a planetary system as in this event, OGLE-2019-BLG-1470.\n(i) Excluding part of the data points in corresponding anomaly planetary or binary) regions. Obtaining two different data subsets.\n(ii) Modelling with 2L1S model for these two data subsets. btaining two sets of 2L1S model parameters, i.e. ( t 0, B , u 0, B , t E, B , B , s B , q B , \u03b1B ) for the binary-star system and ( t 0, c , u 0, c , t E, c , \u03c1c , s c , c , \u03b1c ) for the planetary system. (iii) Combining these two sets of 2L1S model parameters to form\nhe initial parameters ( t 0 , u 0 , t E , \u03c1, s 2 , q 2 , s 3 , q 3 , \u03b1, \u03c8) of the tripleens model which will retain the required caustic structure. For the ase of close binary ( s B < 1), the parameters of the initial triple-lens odel can be obtained from equations ( A2 ) and ( A3 ) (or A7 ). While or the case of wide binary ( s B > 1), one can use equations ( A2 ) and A8 ).\nNRAS 516, 1704\u20131720 (2022)\nThis paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nby U niversity of W arw ick user on 17 O ctober 2022"
