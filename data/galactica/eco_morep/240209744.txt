We propose a new framework for assessing Granger causality in quantiles in unstable environments, for a fixed quantile or over a continuum of quantile levels. Our proposed test statistics are consistent against fixed alternatives, they have nontrivial power against local alternatives, and they are pivotal in certain important special cases. In addition, we show the validity of a bootstrap procedure when asymptotic distributions depend on nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test statistics have correct empirical size and high power, even in absence of structural breaks. Finally, two empirical applications in energy economics and macroeconomics highlight the applicability of our method as the new tests provide stronger evidence of Granger causality. 1 conclusion We have proposed new tests for Granger causality that are robust against structural breaks and compete very well against existing tests.
