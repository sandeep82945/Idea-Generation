    "abstractText": "Automaticity is still ill-understood, and its relation to habit formation and skill acquisition is highly debated. Recently, the principle of caching has been advanced as a potentially promising avenue for studying automaticity. It is roughly understood as a means of storing direct input-output associations in a manner that supports instant lookup. We raise various concerns that should be addressed before the theoretical progress afforded by this principle can be evaluated. Is caching merely a metaphor for computer caching or is it a computational model that can be used to derive testable predictions? How do the short-term and long-term effects of automaticity relate to the distinction between working memory and long-term memory? Does caching apply to stimulus-response associations \u2013 as already suggested by Logan\u2019s instance theory \u2013 or to algorithms, too? How much practice is required for caching and how does caching depend on the task\u2019s type? What is the relation between control processes and caching as these pertain to the possible suppression of automatic processes? Dealing with these questions will arguably also advance our understanding of automaticity.",

In philosophy of mind and action, it has been examined as part of\nstudying the interrelation among habit, skill, and knowledge (e.g., Christensen et\u00a0al., 2016; Fridland, 2017; Pacherie & Mylopoulos, 2020; Stanley & Krakauer, 2013). The received view now seems to be that even in automatic processes there is still room for cognitive control. The controlled feature of skilled action is that which accounts for the nuanced ways in which a skilled agent can alter, adjust, and guide one\u2019s performance (e.g., Fridland, 2014; Shepherd, 2021). Task switching itself, however, does not seem amenable to automatization. In cognitive psychology, the focus has been directed at identifying the features that define processes as automatic (Bargh, 1994; Frensch, 1998; Moors, 2016; Moors & De Houwer, 2006; Rawson, 2010; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977; Tzelgov, 1997), such as running without conscious monitoring, or unintentional triggering by stimulus onset. Nevertheless, there is still no consensus on what the precise markers of automaticity are, and whether there even exists a minimal set of such markers.\nIn neuroscience of motor control, \u201cautomaticity\u201d and \u201chabitual responses\u201d are often taken to be synonyms, thereby making the definitional problem even worse. Studies in humans and rodents have suggested that behavior can at times be goaldirected \u2013 i.e., planned, and purposeful, and at times habitual \u2013 i.e., inflexible and unintentionally evoked by stimuli (Gillan et\u00a0al., 2015; Robbins & Costa, 2017). The fact that habitual actions are characterized by automatic markers has led to an\n* Nir Fresco nfresco@bgu.ac.il\nJoseph Tzelgov tzelgov@bgu.ac.il\nLior Shmuelof shmuelof@bgu.ac.il\n1 Departments of\u00a0Cognitive and\u00a0Brain Sciences and\u00a0Philosophy, Epistemology & Cognition Lab, Ben-Gurion University of\u00a0the\u00a0Negev, P.O.B. 653, 8410501\u00a0Beer-Sheva, Israel\n2 Departments of\u00a0Cognitive and\u00a0Brain Sciences and\u00a0Psychology, Ben-Gurion University of\u00a0the\u00a0Negev, P.O.B. 653, 8410501\u00a0Beer-Sheva, Israel\n3 Department of\u00a0Cognitive and\u00a0Brain Sciences, Brain and\u00a0Action Lab, Adi-Negev BGU Translational Neurorehabilitation Lab, Zlotowski Center for\u00a0Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion University of\u00a0the\u00a0Negev, P.O.B. 653, 8410501\u00a0Be\u2019er\u00a0Sheva, Israel\n1 3\nindistinguishable usage of these two concepts in motor control studies. And while skills are sometimes composed of so-called habitual responses, skill has deliberative goal-directed components, too. Thus, the conceptualization and operationalization of automaticity is required to link theories of habit formation and skill acquisition with the available data.\nThe primary aim of our article is to scrutinize a recent proposal to explain automaticity by appealing to the concept of \u201ccaching\u201d (e.g., Cushman & Morris, 2015; Haith & Krakauer, 2018; Huberdeau et\u00a0al., 2019; McDougle & Taylor, 2019), which has been adopted from computer engineering. Given the now widespread acceptance of multiple memory systems, it seems unwitting to study automaticity without attending to the qualitative differences between the ways that various memory systems guide initial learning. However, despite there being many distinct routes to automaticity, there might still be a single common representation for automatic behaviors (Ashby & Crossley, 2012). Thus, the explanatory appeal to cache memory \u2013 as a means of storing direct input-output associations that are subsequently amenable to instant lookup \u2013 may be seen as a promising avenue for research on automaticity.\nNevertheless, we argue below that it is unclear what caching is precisely, and what this concept purports to explain with respect to automaticity. How is the principle of caching different from Logan\u2019s instance theory (1988), according to which automaticity is a transition from a multistep memory retrieval (or an algorithmic process) to a single-step memory retrieval? Are the classes of \u201ccached\u201d and \u201cautomatic\u201d processes equivalent or is the former just a subclass of the latter? (In other words, in which contexts does caching kick in?) Is caching part of working memory (WM) or part of long-term memory (LTM)? What is the gating process for stimulus-response (SR) associations that undergo caching and those that do not? (i.e., which stimuli are encoded as such that should trigger specific responses and which ones are ignored as irrelevant to the task at hand?) Does the caching mechanism apply to SR associations only or to algorithmic processes, too? We articulate and elaborate on these questions, using philosophical arguments and empirical evidence from cognitive psychology and motor control studies.\nThe article is sevenfold. The next section (What is cache memory? Is it merely a metaphor?) is devoted to explaining what computer caching is and why cognitive caching does not resemble the former. The third section (Short-term versus long-term views of caching) examines how the distinction between short-term and long-term caching fares with respect to WM and LTM, respectively. In the fourth section (Caching only stimulus-response associations?) we ask whether cognitive caching is limited to SR associations only. We claim that since some automatic processes, arguably, cannot be fully explained merely by storing and retrieving SR associations, if cognitive caching applies only to SR\nassociations, then it cannot explain automaticity in general. In the fifth section (Short-term versus long-term effects of automaticity) we ask whether caching applies to the shortterm or long-term effects of automaticity. In the sixth section (Control and suppression of automatic processes), we ask about the relation between cognitive caching and control. While some cached processes may be suppressed, many acquired automatic processes are amenable to control though they cannot be easily suppressed.\nWhat is\u00a0cache memory? Is it merely a\u00a0metaphor?\nThe role of caching in automaticity has been proposed very recently, but it is not novel. Logan famously proposed that single-step memory retrieval is likely the only low-level process that can explain automaticity (1988). Thus, in his view, \u201c[t]o assess the automaticity of performance, one must determine whether it relies on direct memory retrieval\u201d (Moors & De Houwer, 2006, 300). Interestingly, Haith and Krakauer claim that the concept of \u201ccaching is stronger than merely a process of retrieving earlier computations\u201d and that it should \u201cbe understood as a means of storing direct associations between inputs and outputs in a way that is amenable to instant lookup\u201d (Haith & Krakauer, 2018, 197). They even describe \u201c[c]ached computation as a theory of automatic action selection\u201d (ibid, italics added). Nevertheless, as should become clear below, the technical details underlying this proposed principle are critical for evaluating the possible theoretical progress in understanding automaticity on this basis.\nThe analogy of cognitive caching to computer caching (i.e., \u201cprocessor cache memory\u201d) is unsurprising given the computational efficiency gained by using the latter method. Haith and Krakauer suggest that different aspects of automaticity can be understood as the caching of SR associations, but possibly even of more hierarchical processes that include intermediate computational steps (Haith & Krakauer, 2018). Action selection is computationally expensive, since the agent has to weigh up the relative costs and benefits of each one of countless possible actions. And repeating the same computation to obtain the same outcome every time is wastefully time-consuming.\nComputational efficiency can be gained by simply caching the action that the agent selected last time a choice was made in response to the same trigger. Huberdeau et\u00a0al. (2019, 1050) similarly argue that the caching of SR associations, which link target locations to appropriate motor output, may facilitate the transition from deliberate to automatic action selection, thereby accounting for how practice alters the way in which agents adapt to frequently experienced perturbations. Cushman and Morris (2015) have likewise claimed\n1 3\nthat model-free reinforcement learning assigns values to candidate actions based on their context-dependent reward history, thereby resulting in \u201ccached policies.\u201d \u201c[H]abitual goal selection affords computational savings by caching a model-free value representation of goal pursuit\u201d (Cushman & Morris, 2015, 13820). McDougle and Taylor also suggest that the caching of SR associations in WM enables a cognitive response to be deployed quickly and without deliberation (McDougle & Taylor, 2019).\nThe analogy to computer caching is supposedly straightforward: the term \u201ccaching\u201d is applied whenever buffering is utilized to reuse commonly recurring items and speed up the computation. Yet, how seriously should this analogy be taken? This question is pressing, if cognitive caching is intended not only as a useful metaphor but as providing a mechanistic or computational framework that supports the diagnosis of automaticity and enables the derivation of empirical predictions. Let us now briefly consider, then, what computer cache memory is as a basis for assessing the ways in which cognitive and computer caching resemble. There are undoubtedly many features of computer caching that we do, and should, not expect in cognitive caching, since the brain architecture is not a von Neumann machine. However, we should ask, for example, how cache memory differs from WM.\nCache memory in modern, electronic computers is a fast type of memory that is designed to increase the speed of CPU operations. Data that have been most frequently used by the CPU are stored within its cache. Cached data can be retrieved extremely fast, as caching eliminates the data transfer step that is required, for example, when the CPU accesses the computer\u2019s main memory \u2013 RAM (short for Random Access Memory). While the computer is running, the RAM holds the essential parts of the operating system as well as the running program and much of its data.1 Both RAM and cache memory are volatile: the data stored in these memory banks are lost when the computer is shut down or restarted. Importantly, cache memory is faster than RAM, due to it being situated as close as technically possible to the CPU \u2013 with many modern processors integrating some amount of cache memory onto the same silicon chip. Nevertheless, computer technology constraints lead to cache memory being exponentially smaller in size than RAM (for more on computer caching see, e.g., Patterson & Hennessy (2018, Chapter\u00a05)).\nIn what sense may cognitive caching resemble computer caching despite the obvious differences? Computer caching relies on the idea of being in close proximity to the CPU\nto try and find the required data in the higher levels of the memory hierarchy. It is based on the idea of prediction (i.e., guessing what a future memory reference might be and requesting that address from the memory subsystem), with estimates of successful cache prediction in modern computers being typically above 95% (Patterson & Hennessy, 2018, 378). Computer architecture has built-in mechanisms for retrieving the required data from the lower levels of the memory hierarchy (i.e., RAM) when prediction fails.\nWe should not expect, of course, that present computer technology be a strict model for cognitive caching. There are different cache optimization techniques that are based on the CPU\u2019s cache architectures, but the specific architectural details are less important. Computer caching is based on some fundamental principles that make it computationally efficient. For example, every datum in cache memory should, in principle, be just as fast to retrieve as any other in that memory. And, once the cache memory is full and new data need to be fetched by the CPU, then old, less frequently used cached data are erased. That is because the size of cache memory is inherently limited in a direct proportion to the CPU\u2019s size. Once the cache memory is too big, parts of it will no longer be close enough to the CPU to make data retrieval sufficiently fast. Where does this analogy break down, and cognitive caching should be understood merely metaphorically?\nLet us, first, consider the close proximity principle in computer caching. Haith and Krakauer (2018) do not suggest, for example, that cognitive cache memory is neuronally implemented in any close functional or structural proximity to the primary motor cortex or in some specific brain region that makes a frequently used motor strategy quicker to deploy. (Of course, more abstract processes, such as reasoning skills \u2013 once automated \u2013 will not require close proximity to frontal cortex areas.) Such close proximity would supposedly result in more efficient neural connectivity \u2013 and, thus, faster communication \u2013 as compared with other forms of memory activation prior to the automatization of a cognitive task culminating in a specific motor action.\nMcDougle and Taylor, on the other hand, hypothesize that discrete SR caching \u2013 \u201cbeing a form of capacity-limited item-based working memory\u201d \u2013 may rely on processing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (McDougle & Taylor, 2019). They suggest that this hypothesis can be tested in future brain studies. But, in their view, cognitive cache memory is a part of WM (more on that in the sections Short-term versus long-term views of caching and Short-term versus long-term effects of automaticity below), whereas computer cache memory is a separate, more efficient form of memory compared with RAM.\nUndoubtedly, this aspect of the caching metaphor may only be directly addressed through neurophysiology and computational modelling. One such neuroscientific model 1 The computer\u2019s hard drive is considered long-term storage: stored data are not lost even if the computer is turned off, unplugged, or loses its power supply.\n1 3\nis offered by Li and van Rossum (2020). They argue that the brain saves energy by temporarily caching memories in synapses through processes that do not require any synthesis of proteins. Of course, memory consolidation in LTM requires large amounts of energy due to protein synthesis. Thus, their model proposes that the brain utilizes short-term mechanisms (e.g., early-LTP/LTD) \u2013 that decay with time and do not require protein synthesis \u2013 for storing memory traces that are not ultimately consolidated (e.g., early-LTP/ LTD that are not transformed into late-LTP/LTD). This kind of storage is termed synaptic caching. Therefore, Li and van Rossum\u2019s model of synaptic caching is very different from computer caching. For, on their model, cache memory and persistent memory coexist in the very same neural circuits, rather than in dedicated brain regions or networks \u2013 as predicted based on the computer analogy. We return to other neurocomputational models of memory below.\nWe, next, consider the size and persistence constraints of cognitive cache memory. As noted above, computer cache memory is very small in size in direct proportion to the size of the CPU, and thus has a very limited capacity (i.e., as compared with RAM). Whether this kind of memory is short-lived (e.g., McDougle & Taylor, 2019; Meiran et\u00a0al., 2017) or long-lived (Haith & Krakauer, 2018; Huberdeau et\u00a0al., 2019) affects its possible capacity. McDougle and Taylor claim that \u201c[response caching] manifests as a lookup table of S-R (stimulus-response) relationships, consistent with capacity-limited working memory\u201d (McDougle & Taylor, 2019, 7). Thus, they hypothesize that when the number of task-relevant stimuli is relatively small, a caching strategy can be, and is indeed primarily, employed, whereas in circumstances with many simultaneous stimuli an algorithmic strategy is employed instead.2 Although Meiran et\u00a0al. (2017) do not invoke the notion of \u201ccaching,\u201d they argue that recently instructed tasks can be quickly automatized without having been practiced beforehand (we elaborate on their paradigm in the section Short-term versus long-term effects of automaticity). Novel instructional information is translated, on their hypothesis, into SR associations (where the response is an action concept) that are plausibly stored in procedural WM (Meiran & Pereg, 2017).\nRelatedly, while a short-term view of cognitive caching resonates, to some extent, with the persistence of computer caching, the long-term view does not. This is because computer cache memory is a volatile type of memory: its persistence is as short-lived as it gets. Whether or not WM and short-term memory are indeed genuinely distinct neural structures or merely different semantic definitions used in\nvarious research programs, LTM is not likewise susceptible to temporal decay and chunk capacity constraints (Cowan, 2008). It is the capacity constraint (i.e., how many items short-term storage may hold) that seems more relevant when comparing computer cache memory and WM. This is because the limited space of cache memory makes this type of memory very costly in a similar manner to WM storage, which is essential for attention-related central executive processes.3 The temporal decay of short-term storage does not straightforwardly apply to computer cache memory. Items are not kept in cache as a function of time, but rather as a function of how frequently they are accessed. If the number of items stored in cache memory is smaller than the cache capacity limit, they could remain cached \u2013 so long as the computer is not restarted \u2013 until they are replaced by other items. WM, by contrast, is constrained by both temporal decay and chunk capacity (unless one considers long-term WM \u2013 \u00e0 la Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995).4\nThe upshot of this short analysis is that even when ignoring the obvious architectural differences between cognitive and computer caching, there is presently little reason to regard \u201ccaching\u201d as anything more than a metaphor in explaining automaticity. Yet even if the former and the latter are incompatible for the reasons specified above, we ask how the concept of cognitive caching as it is invoked in recent work, primarily in neuroscience of motor control, may contribute to our understanding of and to deriving new predictions about automaticity. Without specifying either the neural or computational architecture of cognitive caching, it is harder to see how this principle can be used to derive refutable predictions.\nHaving discussed the limitations of the analogy to computer caching, we briefly discuss next the distinction between short-term and long-term caching as they pertain to WM and LTM, respectively. This distinction provides an opportunity to develop and test empirical hypotheses about the potential caching mechanisms invoked in the automatization of behavioral responses.\n2 The reaction time results of McDougle and Taylor\u2019s visuomotor rotation experiments seem to support this hypothesis (McDougle & Taylor, 2019).\n3 It is still debated, though, whether WM consists of a fixed number of discrete slots or is better conceived as a single shared resource that may be flexibly allocated between multiple information items (Hazy et\u00a0al., 2021). The latter view is less compatible with computer cache memory. 4 Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) described a form of memory that supports the retrieval of relevant information that allows a subject to switch attention away from a given activity and then return to it afterwards. Such long-term WM supposedly has neither a capacity nor a time limit (Cowan, 2017).\n1 3\nShort\u2011term versus\u00a0long\u2011term views of\u00a0caching\nHow do short-term caching (hereafter, ST-caching) and long-term caching (LT-caching) fare with respect to WM and LTM, respectively? (Hereafter, \u201ccaching\u201d simpliciter refers to cognitive caching.) Consider, first, a simple anecdotal example of a cognitive process undergoing automatization. When one is asked to multiply 17 by 39, one can use the elementary school algorithm to get the answer of 663. Once accomplished, if asked again a few seconds or minutes later, one is likely to remember the answer \u2013 by retrieving it from WM \u2013 without recomputing it. The answer is likely to be forgotten, however, over much longer periods \u2013 hours or days later \u2013 unless there is a consistent need to retrieve or recompute it.5 This general picture seems to be consistent with the ST-caching view (in a similar manner to short-lived storage of newly instructed tasks in the NEXT paradigm; see the Short-term versus long-term effects of automaticity), but not with the LT-caching view. Why? The latter seems to capture our ability to quickly remember the outcome of 7 times 9, for example \u2013 just like Logan\u2019s instance theory that appeals to LTM \u2013 due to the forced repetition in elementary school. But do ST-caching and LT-caching, in general, run parallel to WM and LTM?\nStudies in neurophysiology and neurocomputational models posit that WM relies on an active maintenance of elevated firing rates in specific subpopulations of neurons (Durstewitz et\u00a0al., 2000) with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) traditionally assumed to maintain representations of taskrelevant stimuli in WM (O\u2019Reilly et\u00a0al., 1999).6 Two of the essential information-processing principles underlying WM, according to many neurocomputational models, are (a) active maintenance that is both dynamic and robust so as to selectively maintain, flexibly update, and protect information from interference, and (b) the rapid and ongoing ability of maintained information to influence subsequent processing\nor action selection (ibid). One posited mechanism for the active maintenance of elevated firing rates is strong recurrent excitatory connections in subpopulations of neurons that collectively encode the same pattern and are wired together reciprocally (Hazy et\u00a0al., 2021). An alternative mechanism is a circulating activity in feedforward-connected subgroups of neurons with no direct feedback links between successive groups (Durstewitz et\u00a0al., 2000). These two WM informationprocessing principles are compatible with the ST-caching view, and incompatible with the LT-caching view.\nComputational models of and neurophysiological evidence concerning LTM, on the other hand, point at different mechanisms of information storage altogether (Dash et\u00a0al., 2004; Dudai et\u00a0al., 2015; Nader & Einarsson, 2010). First, memory traces are stored by structural modifications of synaptic connections \u2013 through synaptic consolidation mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Memory traces undergoing synaptic consolidation may be short-term and labile or long-term and stable. The short-term trace may decay, develop into a long-term form, or the short- and long-term forms may develop in parallel. They may last for more than 24 hours (Dudai, 2004). Second, newly formed patterns of neural activity are carriers of memory traces \u2013 through the system\u2019s consolidation, which supports a shift of declarative memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex (Squire & Alvarez, 1995). System consolidation is very likely triggered by recurrent activation of the hippocampal trace in either implicit processing or explicit recall. The burden of retention is shifted to the neocortex, which can ultimately maintain the specific internal representation independently and actualize it in retrieval (Dudai, 2004). Unfortunately, the question of whether nondeclarative memories, which are prominent in motor skill learning, undergo system consolidation is not yet settled (Dudai, 2004; 62; Dudai et\u00a0al., 2015; Wilhelm et\u00a0al., 2008).\nThe distinction between the ST-caching and LT-caching views entails two possible claims about the caching mechanism. The first one is that our cognitive architecture includes ST-caching and LT-caching as two separate mechanisms. Consistent with the neural and computational distinctions between WM and LTM, we suggest that ST-caching and LT-caching should be treated as two different entities even if neither resembles computer caching.7 However, as we argue below, based on their fundamental differences, it is far from being clear that these two entities (or processes) may be both legitimately classified as caching and still explain automaticity.\n5 If the multiplication result of 663 is somehow remembered over a period of several days \u2013 without the need to recompute it \u2013 and it is not consolidated in LTM, then further memory research is called for attending to the qualitative differences between the ways that different memory systems \u2013 beyond the traditional WM and LTM \u2013 are implicated in automatization. 6 More recent studies have called into question the PFC as being the site of WM\u00a0storage (D\u2019Esposito & Postle, 2015; Lara & Wallis, 2015). It has been reported, for example, that lesions of PFC do not always impair WM storage, but do impair the ability to switch attentional control based on changing task demands. Thus, the role of the PFC in WM might be any of the control processes (e.g., flexible control and attentional selection) that are also implicated in performing WM tasks. Therefore, before investigating whether the PFC might be somehow involved in ST-caching, further research is needed to ascertain its role in WM storage of information.\n7 Li and Van Rossum\u2019s model of synaptic caching coheres with the idea of synaptic consolidation (e.g., through short-lived LTP/LTD) \u2013 distributing learning over transient and persistent synaptic changes, but certainly not with system consolidation.\n1 3\nAn alternative claim is that cache is a separate entity that holds information from either WM or LTM. This claim may gain some support from an alternative model of WM according to which the short-term retention of information can also be supported by the temporary reactivation of LTM representations. In other words, items in the WM may be either newly encountered ones (e.g., novel stimuli) or those in an activated portion of LTM, which now gets the focus of attention (D\u2019Esposito & Postle, 2015). (With this concept of WM, cognitive caching loses its purported similarity to computer caching, since there is no longer any capacity limit per se on the number of stored items in WM.) While\u00a0caching thus conceived may support faster response repetition, it cannot straightforwardly explain the fast reaction times for WM and LTM associations, since it introduces additional steps of encoding and retrieving information from cache memory.\nThe tension between these two competing claims about caching affords a potentially fruitful avenue for future research on the role of caching mechanism(s) in our cognitive architecture and its (or their) contribution to automaticity in skill acquisition and habit formation."

            "heading": "Caching only\u00a0stimulus\u2011response associations?",
            "text": "Having discussed the tension between ST-caching and LTcaching, we now turn to question the very nature of the cached items. Do recent experimental results that appeal to caching shed any new light on the nature of automatic processing with respect to what is being cached? Some authors, who have discussed caching in the context of automaticity, seem to have limited their analysis to SR associations (e.g., Huberdeau et\u00a0al., 2019; McDougle & Taylor, 2019); but this is problematic. This is because many complex automatic processes \u2013 which are demonstrated in everyday tasks, such as driving a car or playing the piano, or in experimental tasks, such as Stroop effects or Stroop-like effects (e.g., Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 1996, 2000) \u2013 may not be limited to SR associations. Notably, Haith and Krakauer (2018) claim that in simple SR scenarios, such as pressing the brake pedal (response) upon observing the red traffic light (stimulus), only one computation is available to be LT-cached: the red-light-press-brakepedal association. However, they seem to suggest that LTcaching is not limited only to SR associations.\nWhy is that? Haith and Krakauer argue that in complex scenarios, such as driving, action selection typically involves distinct computations that may be LT-cached. First, behavioral goals should be determined (computationally) on the basis of observed stimuli (e.g., when the traffic light turns yellow a driver has to decide whether to stop or proceed). Second, matching actions to accomplish the chosen goals\nshould be (computationally) selected (e.g., press the brake pedal or press it and shift to a lower gear). Supposedly \u201c[e] ither of these computations could be cached, giving rise to a variety of ways that behavior might be generated\u201d (Haith & Krakauer, 2018, 199). Haith and Krakauer even add that \u201ca cached movement policy [i.e., a mental algorithm] can be considered a form of procedural knowledge\u201d (ibid,\u00a0198, italics added). The direct implication is that mental algorithms (or control policies), and not just SR associations, can be LT-cached (Krakauer, 2019, 825).\nNevertheless, they do not specify how mental algorithms should be understood and relatedly how they may be LTcached. This is a curious oversight, because they characterize caching as a means of storing direct inputs and outputs associations \u201cin a way that is amenable to instant lookup\u201d (Haith & Krakauer, 2018, 197). Some simple algorithms in computer science may be conceptualized as a sequence of steps, and analogously some mental algorithms may be viewed as complicated forms of SR associations. However, an algorithm in general is an intricate compound control structure and its nature extends beyond being just a sequence of steps (Gurevich, 2012; Hill, 2016). In everyday scenarios, few mental algorithms are simply a rolling cascade of SR associations that can be instantly retrieved from LTM as a one-size-fits-all recipe. And experimentally, Haith and Krakauer seem to focus only on the LT-caching of SR associations, even if their results are not explicitly described using this terminology (e.g., Hardwick et\u00a0al., 2019; Huberdeau et\u00a0al., 2019).8\nThe debate about whether automaticity is limited to a single-step memory retrieval (e.g., Logan, 1988; Logan & Etherton, 1994) or is applicable to algorithmic processing (e.g., Kramer et\u00a0al., 1990; Palmeri, 1999; Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 1996) is not new. According to Logan\u2019s instance theory, we first solve a task by using a strategy, rule, or algorithm. Every time we perform a specific task T, an instance of that action leaves a trace in LTM. As instances accumulate in memory, whenever T has to be performed again, a race begins between the execution of the base algorithm and the existing instances. The \u201cwinner\u201d is responsible for the performance of T. The increased speed of performing T is not attributed to a more efficient execution of the base algorithm. Rather, according to this theory, as more specific instances are stored in memory, their retrieval supposedly becomes faster. The more instances there are, the less time it takes, on average, for a single instance to win the race: all it takes is a single instance to be activated in LTM. Instance theory also invites the question of whether only SR associations\n8 An interesting case in point, by Yang et\u00a0 al. (2020), is discussed below in more detail.\n1 3\nare automatized, since each instance is essentially an inputoutput association.\nAlthough\u00a0a single-step retrieval from LTM suffices for classifying a process as automatic, some have argued that it is not necessary for automaticity (Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 2000). In cognitive psychology, the Stroop effect and Stroop-like effects are considered a hallmark of autonomous9 automatic processing (Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 1997; but, for a critique, see Besner et\u00a0al., 1997). The Stroop-effect reflects the difference in reaction time between an incongruent condition (a color word, such as \u201cRED\u201d printed in a mismatched color, such as blue) and a congruent condition (e.g., \u201cBLUE\u201d printed in blue) where subjects are asked to report the color in which a word is printed, and\u00a0to ignore\u00a0the word itself. Using the Stroop (and Stroop-like) effect, Tzelgov et\u00a0al. (1996) (and likewise Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 2000) argued that automatic processing cannot be explained exclusively by single-step memory retrieval, by showing that it is not confined to familiar stimuli (from the training stage) that can be retrieved from LTM. Why is that?\nTzelgov et\u00a0al.\u2019s results suggest that subjects accessed the meanings of previously unseen words via an algorithmic route \u2013 by applying a grapheme-to-phoneme process. Bilingual Hebrew-English speakers were presented with Hebrew color names written in English in colored font, for example, the sequence of letters \u201cKAHOL,\u201d which is the Hebrew word for \u201cblue.\u201d They were asked to report the font\u2019s color. Congruent stimuli (e.g., \u201cKAHOL\u201d written in blue) required less time to respond to than incongruent stimuli (e.g., \u201cADOM\u201d \u2013 the Hebrew word for \u201cred\u201d \u2013written in blue). From these findings Tzelgov et\u00a0al. inferred that an algorithmic process is implicated in the task performance. Participants were, arguably, not previously exposed to words like \u201cADOM\u201d or \u201cKAHOL,\u201d and, thus, these words cannot be prior instances in LTM. Being Hebrew speakers, they first parsed the words phonetically (though this was not part of the task requirement), and then associated the words with their semantic meanings. While the semantic representations of colors may be instances in LTM, the phonetic parsing in adults is likely an algorithmic process. In the absence of a better competing explanation of these findings, the reported effect in both conditions supports the idea of automatized algorithmic processing.\nSimilarly, Tzelgov et\u00a0al. (2000) used a Stroop-like phenomenon in the domain of numerical ordering to show that automaticity may reflect algorithmic processing. It is hard to argue that an arbitrary pair of digits \u2013 used for a physical magnitude comparison \u2013 has not been seen before, and, hence, cannot be retrieved from LTM (Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 2000).\nTo overcome this challenge, participants were trained to refer to meaningless symbols (Gibson figures, in this case) as representing physical magnitudes, and were asked to decide on each trial which one of the two stimuli has a larger magnitude. During the training phase, only adjacent stimuli were presented. Participants were subsequently asked \u2013 during the test phase \u2013 to compare the stimuli according to their physical size on pairs of symbols that did not appear together during training. On congruent trials, the symbol associated with a bigger number appeared in a larger font, whereas on incongruent trials the symbol associated with a bigger number appeared in a smaller font. The results indicated an interference between the learned numerical associations and the physical size of the stimuli, thereby also suggesting an acquisition of algorithmic-like automatic processing.\nDoes the concept of \u201ccaching\u201d contribute to our understanding of how algorithmic processes, and not just SR associations, may be automated? If, indeed, as suggested above, there are reasons to hypothesize that automaticity is not confined to single-step retrieval of SR associations, then a satisfactory account of automaticity must also cater for the automatization of algorithmic processes. \u201cCaching,\u201d however, does not seem to offer any theoretical insight on this hypothesis. The mere stipulation that algorithmic processes can be cached (e.g., Haith & Krakauer, 2018) is unhelpful without specifying a plausible mechanism or computational principles for caching algorithms. According to some algorithm-based accounts of automaticity (e.g., Anderson, 1992; Carlson & Lundy, 1992), automatization leads to the reduction of procedural steps to a single one, the strengthening of some steps, and their faster, less error-prone execution (Moors & De Houwer, 2006, 319). Of course, this last criticism depends on our aforementioned claim that a mental algorithm is not exhausted by being\u00a0a sequence of SR associations.\nWhat does it even mean to cache a mental algorithm, such as mental rotation, or the rules of deductive inference? Are individual steps of the algorithm stored and retrieved more efficiently? ST-caching does not seem to be a promising candidate, due to the long-term effects of training. Or is it the execution of the algorithm that becomes more efficient? Neural coding in the relevant activated brain regions may simply become more efficient. \u201cFor example, only a fraction of the initial pool of neurons may be required to realize the same representational fidelity\u201d (Economides et\u00a0al., 2015, 8). Or does the brain switch to using more efficient neural components while the algorithm itself does not change? \u201cTraining has previously been shown to cause \u201coffloading\u201d in tasks requiring executive resources, including an implementational shift from prefrontal to parietal and striatal regions\u201d (ibid). Or is the \u201cslow\u201d algorithm replaced with a \u201cfaster\u201d one, in which key decision junctures are populated with context-optimal values, for example? Or, perhaps, resilience to load emerges, if auxiliary processes 9 The Stroop effect is deemed autonomous, since reading the word is not part of the task requirement.\n1 3\n(other than the processes responsible for performing the task itself) become more efficient (Economides et\u00a0al., 2015, 9). The theoretical framework of caching should address at least some of these questions to account for the automaticity of algorithmic processes.\nMcDougle and Taylor, for one, suggest that when SR associations are ST-cached (model-free) rewarded responses are simply reinforced, whereas (model-based) algorithmic processes rely on explicit models of transition probabilities between sensory states and corresponding responses (2019). They claim, however, that even if a complex algorithm, such as mental rotation, is automatized, it is hard to tell whether the algorithm itself is still executed, or rather that the underlying responses (that were previously computed by the algorithm) have been cached, thereby bypassing the need to execute the algorithm again. We note that if the underlying responses are cached (rather than the algorithm itself), then the more possible responses there are to cache, the greater the constraint on memory becomes.\nA recent study by Yang et\u00a0al. (2020) may provide a possible starting point for testing the automatization of algorithmic processes in motor control research, though it is does not deal with automaticity. Yang et\u00a0al. ask how people learn to build a new continuous feedback control policy (as a type of mental algorithm) from scratch (i.e., de novo learning). To that aim, they have examined whether people could learn to achieve continuous control over a cursor under either a 90\u00b0 visuomotor rotation or mirror-reversed visual feedback. Yang et\u00a0al. report that participants tracked the target continuously, rather than with intermittent catch-up movements, and even exhibited strong aftereffects once the perturbation was removed. These findings seem to support the hypothesis that participants constructed a novel, continuous feedback control policy.\nNevertheless, Yang et\u00a0al. deny the idea that ST-caching of SR associations can be the underlying mechanism of the learned control policy (as a mental algorithm). \u201c[T]he number of associations that can be stored in this way appears to be limited to just 2-7 [\u2026], raising doubts as to whether such a mechanism could support a continuous feedback controller\u201d (Yang et\u00a0al., 2020). That is, contrary to the view that a mental algorithm is a complicated sequence of SR associations, the continuous control policy cannot be stored as a giant lookup table of discrete steps that can control the complex dynamics of reaching and grabbing a moving target. Still, they conjecture \u2013 without an argument \u2013 that learning such control policies \u201cis initially solved explicitly before becoming cached or automatized into a more procedural form\u201d (ibid). That is, some algorithmic processes can supposedly be LT-cached, though we are not told how such caching might be accomplished.\nThe upshot of this section is threefold. First, the idea that SR associations may become automatic is not new. Logan\u2019s\ninstance theory already provides a model for the automatization of SR associations via single-step retrievals from LTM. It remains unclear whether Haith and Krakauer consider Logan\u2019s memory-retrieval model a possible mechanism of their caching principle. Second, specific research on the automatization of algorithmic processes is wanting. Studies of Stroop-like effects may be one fruitful avenue for understanding this important aspect of automaticity. In motor control research, most studies have targeted motor learning by testing discrete, point-to-point movements. However, such motor learning is, at least prima facie, also amenable to explanation via the caching of discrete SR associations. Experimental paradigms that require subjects to use a continuous feedback control policy may provide another fruitful avenue for understanding the automatization of algorithmic processes. Third, for \u201ccaching\u201d to be a useful theoretical construct for explaining the automatization of both SR associations and algorithmic processes, operational definitions of these types of caching are needed as well as a model (just like Logan\u2019s instance theory) on the basis of which new predictions can be derived.\nShort\u2011term versus\u00a0long\u2011term effects of\u00a0automaticity\nIf, indeed, \u201cthe principle of caching [\u2026] provides a potentially unifying and appealingly parsimonious theory of practice and automaticity\u201d (Haith & Krakauer, 2018, 197), then it should account not only for the long-term but also the short-term effects of automaticity. Recent works, including Haith and Krakauer (2018), Hardwick et\u00a0al. (2019), and Huberdeau et\u00a0al. (2019), seem to suggest that caching is associated with long-term effects of automaticity. The consolidation of memory traces of SR associations (or control policies) in LTM is, therefore, supposedly a prerequisite for the corresponding responses becoming automatic. However, according to other studies, responses may be automatized following a very short practice (e.g., McDougle & Taylor, 2019) or even without any practice (e.g., Meiran et\u00a0al., 2017; Meiran & Pereg, 2017). If some automatic phenomena have short-term effects, then the principle of caching should explain such phenomena, too.\nAlthough Haith and Krakauer (2018) do not explicitly assert that caching is LTM-based, this assertion is easy deducible from their appeal to Logan\u2019s instance theory. To reprise, on Logan\u2019s theory (1988), automatic action is based on a direct-access, single-step retrieval of the strongest associated LTM instance. And as noted above, Haith and Krakauer\u2019s proposed principle of caching may entail more than just a process of retrieving earlier computations (from LTM, by implication). \u201c[T]he primary function of practice therefore might be to gather sufficient experience to establish\n1 3\nthis pre-computed cache\u201c (Haith & Krakauer, 2018, 197). This practice is not the kind associated with short-term effects of automaticity.\nHuberdeau et\u00a0al. (2019) argue that it is extended practice \u2013 associated with long-term effects of automaticity \u2013 that promotes caching. They measured the relative contributions of implicit recalibration and deliberate compensation to \u201csavings\u201d10 across 2 days of practice adapting to a \u00b1 30\u00b0 visuomotor rotation. While the rate of implicit recalibration did not seem to improve, and even decreased, with extensive practice of adapting to the perturbation, participants became able to compensate more completely \u2013 when exposed to the same perturbation \u2013 even under constrained preparation time. On Huberdeau et\u00a0al.\u2019s view, these results support the idea that through practice people transition from a computationally expensive process to a cached process. Importantly, however, they measured such savings after a 24-hour period, which means that any change in performance has likely been consolidated and is considered to be associated with LTM. \u201c[I]ncluding an overnight break increased the chances that a potential qualitative change in memory representation would occur and be detectable\u201d (Huberdeau et\u00a0al., 2019, 1051).\nIn a similar vein, Hardwick et\u00a0al. (2019) argue that practice influences automatic behavior. Increased practice is reported to reduce the latency at which automatic responses are prepared, and in turn to increase the likelihood of their expression in short latencies, even in conditions where the associations were switched and the learned responses were no longer correct. These automatic responses were reported to be replaced by goal-directed responses at longer latency. In this study, too, practice was very long: participants trained on a visuomotor association task \u2013 mapping specific stimuli shown on screen with corresponding keyboard buttons \u2013 for 4 days. Their median reaction times, reaction time variability, and error rates all improved with practice. Such automatic responses were shown to be expressed only after a long practice (participants\u2019 behavior was contrasted using a 4-day practice condition and a minimal practice condition). It seems, then, that here, too, caching depends on long-term practice.\nOther studies focusing on the short-term effects of automaticity, however, cast doubt on the possible claim that caching occurs only following consolidation into LTM (i.e., LT-caching). For one thing, NEXT-based, and similar, studies have shown that newly instructed tasks can become automatic without having been practiced before (Meiran et\u00a0al., 2017). The NEXT paradigm involves simple, newly instructed task rules (in each experimental mini block), thereby producing many first encounters with SR\ninstructions. Instructions are given less than 10 seconds before the NEXT effect is measured, thereby indicating that the retrieval of SR associations requires neither practice nor consolidation.\nThe NEXT paradigm, which consists of three phases, involves runs that begin with SR instructions (e.g., \u2018X\u2019 = right, \u2018Y\u2019 = left) applied in a two-trial task, which appears at the end of the run. In the instruction phase, new instructions are introduced (roughly: \u201cpress one of two response keys to advance between screens, which display one of two instructed stimuli\u201d; stimuli are presented in distinct colors). In the interference phase, participants perform a fixed task \u2013 different from the newly instructed one \u2013 that involves the same stimuli and responses. Compatible steps are the correct responses in the interference task that are the same as those learned in the instruction phase. Correct responses in the interference task that contrast with those learned in the instruction phase are considered incompatible steps. In the execution (diagnostic) phase, participants need to perform, for the first time, the newly instructed task (from the instruction phase).\nWhat is the import for present purposes? First, the instructions had not been practiced before (e.g., an arbitrary picture of a spade cueing a right/left hand response). Second, the task cue (e.g., the spade picture) retrieves the associated task instruction (e.g., the right/left instruction), though the cue\u2019s identity is irrelevant in the NEXT tasks. Whilst no classification is needed in this paradigm, the reaction times of compatible SR associations are reportedly shorter than incompatible ones. The performance difference between compatible and incompatible steps provides a measure of an unintentional activation of the newly learned instructions. It \u201cshows that seeing the stimulus leads to reflexive, unintentional retrieval of the response that has been linked to it in the instructions\u201d (Meiran & Pereg, 2017, 38).\nEven more telling in this context is a recent study by McDougle and Taylor focusing on the short-term effects of automaticity. They have hypothesized that a limited number of SR associations is cached in WM, whereas feedback control policies (e.g., a mental rotation algorithm) are not (McDougle & Taylor, 2019). Participants attempted to land a rotated visual cursor on a target while performing a standard visuomotor rotation task. They were exposed to either two or 12 possible target locations. In the first condition, one of two targets, disjoined by 180\u00b0, was pseudorandomly presented at each trial. In the second condition, target locations were pseudorandomly presented at one of 12 possible locations. Consistent with capacity-limited WM, their results support the hypothesis that when a small number of learning targets are processed participants primarily use a discrete caching strategy to correct for the perturbation (McDougle & Taylor, 2019). On the other hand, when many learning targets are processed participants use a parametric mental rotation 10 \u201cSavings\u201d here refers to adaptation to the perturbation occurring more rapidly.\n1 3\ncontrol policy to account for the perturbation. Not only do they describe short-term effects of automaticity, but they argue that it is this kind of automaticity that is likely underpinned by caching mechanisms.\nIt is perhaps possible to claim that caching is a mediating process between learning and memory processes that gives rise to the automatization of some operations. The plausibility of this claim, however, depends on how ST-caching and LT-caching are treated (as discussed in Section\u00a03). Short-term effects of automaticity seem to undermine its plausibility. If the underlying automatization processes are short-lived (cf., short-span NEXT tasks, and visuomotor rotation task applied to a limited set of target locations) and responses do not have any opportunity to consolidate into LTM, then this kind of automaticity cannot be based on consolidation, thereby making LT-caching ill-suited for such cases of automaticity. Besides, such a claim leaves shortterm effects of automaticity unexplained and it is unclear why ST-caching of some item would increase the probability of its consolidation to LT-caching. In McDougle and Taylor\u2019s experiments, caching is described as the process that underlies capacity-limited item-based automatic strategies (e.g., adapting to sensory feedback relative to a very limited number possible movements). While the maintenance of acquired one-to-one SR associations in WM is possible, as a lookup table, no consolidation is involved.\nSuppose, nevertheless, that a possible rejoinder to this objection is that caching is offered as a parsimonious theory pertaining to long-term effects of automaticity, and that shortterm effects of automaticity \u2013 as described by McDougle and Taylor (2019) and Meiran et\u00a0al. (2017) \u2013 in fact instantiate a different phenomenon. Even if that were so, another question would arise: what is the gating process for responses that do undergo caching and those that do not? That is, which SR-associations (or control policies, for that matter) are consolidated and cached, and which are not cached? There is no doubt, of course, that some kind of consolidation must be involved in long-term effects of automaticity, since it is by definition a process through which unstable short-term memory representations are transformed into stable representations in LTM. But while consolidation may certainly be a necessary condition for such automaticity, it cannot be sufficient.\nTo see this, just consider any memorized event that has been consolidated, but does not qualify as an automatic process per se. As a colloquial example, consider an individual who repeatedly attempts to recall which other people attended a particular event that he attended (e.g., a particular lecture or some social gathering). That person arguably retrieves specific details about that particular event (based on a recall from episodic memory). Another example of motor skills is handwriting. This skill is an outcome of extended practice and gradual improvement, and is immune\nto interference. Neither example should be taken as an instance of an automated process, even though consolidation has arguably taken place following practice.\nIn sum, for the principle of caching to qualify as a basis of a parsimonious theory of practice and automaticity, all learned automatic processes should be accounted for. Is caching simply meant to reflect any behavioral signature that is expressed at low reaction times \u2013 as Haith and Krakauer (2018), for example, seem to suggest? Or does it reflect something deeper as the route (i.e., the underlying computational or neural mechanism) at which the behavioral signature is expressed at low reaction times \u2013 as McDougle and Taylor (2019), for example, seem to suggest? It seems that caching as it is envisaged by Haith and Krakauer (2018), Hardwick et\u00a0al. (2019), and Huberdeau et\u00a0al. (2019) only applies to long-term effects of automaticity, thereby leaving an explanatory gap concerning short-term effects of automaticity. Moreover, even when only the former is concerned, it remains unclear what the precise relation is between caching and consolidation, despite the latter possibly being a necessary condition for the former."

            "text": "In this penultimate\u00a0 section, we ask what the relation is between caching and control. In everyday situations, when automatic responses do not fit the circumstances, their execution may supposedly be halted. In lab-based tasks, such as SR-association- and Stroop-based tasks, which are used to study automaticity, there is hardly ever direct evidence for automatic responses. Rather, an increase in the subjects\u2019 reaction time is observed and explained as an outcome of the suppression of an underlying automatic process that does not fit the task\u2019s demands. In Stroop tasks, for example, a longer reaction time is reported in incongruent trials (i.e., when subjects have to declare the font\u2019s color when the word presented refers to another color). Importantly, they do not even articulate the word (irrespective of the font\u2019s color) that they supposedly read automatically. A similar approach, in which automatic processing is inferred through an increase in reaction times, is seen in stimulus\u2013stimulus compatibility tasks (e.g., the Eriksen flanker task) and SR compatibility tasks (e.g., the Simon task) where subjects have to execute an action according to a condition that is incongruent with the automatic response.\nA different approach for testing automaticity measures the probability of executing an automatic response in incongruent conditions, therefore measuring uncontrolled automatic responses. The stop-signal paradigm is one example of lab-based tasks that is\u00a0based on this approach. In Logan and Cowan\u2019s study (1984), for example, subjects were given\n1 3\na primary task to perform and, occasionally, a stop signal \u2013 informing them to not respond on that occasion \u2013 was presented, and the probability of executing the automatic response (the primary task) was reported. Another example of this approach is the timed response paradigm. Hardwick et\u00a0al.\u2019s study (2019) demonstrates a time-consuming inhibition process of automatic responses, such that when subjects are forced to respond at short reaction times, the probability of initiating a context-incongruent automatic response \u2013 as compared to longer reaction times or context-congruent responses \u2013 is increased. These findings point to an extensive involvement of deliberative and time-consuming inhibition processes in suppressing automatic responses. They indicate that automaticity is not assigned to the entire process from stimulus perception to response, but rather to specific memory retrieval processes that occur after the perception of a stimulus and before the initiation of the response. Deliberative control may, thus, interrupt the execution of an automatic response.\nDeliberative control may also modulate the expression of an automatic response. Consider the Stroop paradigm again. When subjects are exposed to either increased probability of incongruent trials or the mere expectation of increased probability of incongruent trials, their Stroop effect is decreased (MacLeod, 1991). Such findings suggest that the retrieval of the meaning of the color from the lexicon in Stroop experiments is controllable, and challenges the idea that the entire stimulus (e.g., word)-response coupling is automatic. The deliberative reduction in the Stroop effect may not be attributed to the automatic lexical component, but rather to a post-lexical inhibition of the automatic response, which is activated in the incongruent conditions (Tzelgov et\u00a0al., 1992). Assuming that automatic reading is not affected by participating in a Stroop experiment, the modulation of the Stroop effect suggests that the effect is partially controlled (Levin & Tzelgov, 2014). A recent study that tested the impact of increasing the proportion of neutral trials on the size of semantic Stroop effect has similarly concluded that semantic retrieval can be controlled by endogenous (voluntary/intentional) attention (Kinoshita et\u00a0al., 2018) (but see Augustinova & Ferrand, 2014, for an opposing view). There are, therefore, some reasons to believe that the expression of an automatic response may be modulated in some conditions.\nThese results may also indicate a possible explanation for the existence of automatic responses in timed response conditions, but not in self-paced reaction time conditions. In short reaction times, the inhibition of the automatic responses is not activated, and, hence, the automatic responses are executed. In self-paced reaction time conditions, on the other hand, there is an opportunity to suppress the activated automatic responses. The brief upshot, thus far, is that automatic responses may be controlled in\ntwo different ways: their execution can be halted, and their expression can be modulated.\nHow may an appeal to caching processes explain these two plausible control aspects of automatic responses? The analogy to computer caching indeed suggests that cache memory can be exploited for a fast retrieval of a single, frequently used SR association. However, Haith and Krakauer propose \u201ccaching\u201d to also describe a flexible automatization of multiple SR associations (2018). In driving, for example, they suggest that the association between a red light and pressing the brakes could be divided into two components that can be cached separately or together: the red-light stimulus and stopping the car, or stopping the car and pressing the brakes. The examples discussed above suggest that only motor plan retrieval is automatic, whereas the initiation of the automatic response is controlled. These suggest, therefore, that Haith and Krakauer\u2019s cache-based description of automaticity is inaccurate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical examples of SR associations that are completely automatized and yet cannot be stopped. Multiple steps of retrievals and responses are, so we claim, not fully automatized, and this claim reaffirms the importance of clarifying the explanatory value of \u201ccaching.\u201d\nThe question concerning the controllability of automatic processes goes well beyond the specific scope of caching and invites a further conceptual distinction. Typical multistep behaviors, which are considered to be automatic, such as shifting gear in driving or making coffee, can run without conscious monitoring (Tzelgov, 1997), but, importantly, can be interrupted, halted, or modulated. Nevertheless, some retrieval processes, such as retrieving the semantic meaning of a written word, or the motor plan for a learned SR association, cannot be controlled despite running without conscious monitoring.\nWe submit \u2013 as a possibly fruitful direction for future research \u2013 to distinguish between two levels of automaticity. All (learned) behaviors that can run without conscious monitoring (Tzelgov, 1997) may be classified at a lower level of automaticity. Above that level, we may distinguish between automatic behaviors that are controllable (e.g., habits) and those that are not (cf. Pacherie & Mylopoulos, 2020). On this tentative proposal, increased reaction times in incongruent conditions as in Stroop or making automatic mistakes in a timed response paradigm are indicative of an automatic retrieval. On the other hand, making your morning coffee or shifting to a lower gear before heading downhill are habits: we can decide at the last moment to add milk to our coffee or simply push the brake pedal. Stopping the process of retrieving the meaning of the word inscribed on the coffee jar is a different matter.\nIt may be objected that reflexes, too, may be described as running without conscious monitoring, thereby undermining our tentative two-level proposal. A complete response\n1 3\nexceeds the scope of this article. There has been a long philosophical discussion on the assimilation of habits to reflexes since at least the 1950s (e.g., Ryle, 1949), with the main reason for that being the lack of any preceding deliberation, choice, or effort in the activation of reflexes (Pollard, 2006). More recently, however, philosophers have argued that habits are not single-track dispositions as bare reflexes, because the former \u201ccan be flexible and adaptive as well as idiosyncratic\u201d (Sutton et\u00a0al., 2011, 81). Krakauer, on the other hand, argues that both reflexes and habits \u201care automatic responses that can be constructed through initial cognitive scaffolding and practice. [\u2026 They both] retain evidence of a past intelligence that is \u2018baked into them\u2019\u201d (Krakauer, 2019, 825). Although long-latency stretch reflexes can be modulated (e.g., by spatial target position) (Pruszynski & Scott, 2012), the suppression of a response is not the same as flexibly changing it once triggered. Further conceptual analysis of the relation between habit and reflex is undoubtedly required. Our present suggestion is simply confined to learned automatic processes \u2013 as in Logan (1992)."

            "text": "Despite decades of research on automaticity, we still lack sufficient knowledge of the nature of the processes that are automatized (SR associations versus algorithmic), what leads to automaticity (e.g., is consolidation necessary?), and how automaticity should be defined. We have evaluated above the contribution of a recently introduced concept \u2013 \u201ccaching\u201d \u2013 to our understanding of automaticity. We have argued that although intriguing predictions can be raised based on the analogy between cognitive and computer caching, such predictions are not articulated and agreed upon, and seem to fall short of significantly expanding our knowledge about automaticity.\nNevertheless, the appeal to \u201ccaching\u201d may afford potentially fruitful avenues for future research on memory and automaticity. We may advance our understanding of automaticity if we come up with operational definitions of the possibly various forms of caching, such as the caching of (a) simple SR associations, (b) the computation of (i.e., algorithm for) the behavioral goals, which are determined by the given stimuli, and (c) the computation of actions, which are needed to achieve the given behavioral goals. Neural measures can also be developed to address some of the predictions that arise based on the analogy between computer and cognitive caching. Furthermore, competing hypotheses about the caching mechanisms in memory and their role in automaticity can be tested: is caching a single, shared resource in all (learned) automatic behaviors? Or do different caching mechanisms support short-term and long-term effects of automaticity?\nAcknowledgements We thank Guy Avraham for his helpful comments on an earlier version of this article as well as Nachshon Meiran for a useful discussion.
