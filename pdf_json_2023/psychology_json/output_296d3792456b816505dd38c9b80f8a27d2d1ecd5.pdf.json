    "abstractText": "Tetrodotoxin (TTX) could result in serious diseases due to its extremely high neurotoxicity. Thus, it is of great importance tomeasure TTX for food safety. In this study, an anti-TTXmonoclonal antibody with good specificity and high affinity was used to develop the immunochromatographic test strips (ICTS). Gold nanoflower (AuNF) with multiple branches and latex microsphere (LM) with large particle size as signal reporters were employed for improving the sensitivity of test strips. Both AuNF and LM probes are stable, and the developed ICTS were specific to TTX, demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other marine toxins. The linear range of AuNFand LM-based strips for TTX was 9.49\u2013330.98 ng/mL and 5.40\u2013443.19 ng/ mL, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of AuNFand LM-based strips was determined to be 9.49 ng/mL and 5.40 ng/mL, respectively. In summary, the developed ICTS based on AuNF and LM signal probes displayed enhancement of sensitivity and provided rapid and specific detection of TTX.",

Thus, it is of great importance tomeasure TTX for food safety. In this study, an anti-TTXmonoclonal antibody with good specificity and high affinity was used to develop the immunochromatographic test strips (ICTS). Gold nanoflower (AuNF) with multiple branches and latex microsphere (LM) with large particle size as signal reporters were employed for improving the sensitivity of test strips. Both AuNF and LM probes are stable, and the developed ICTS were specific to TTX, demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other marine toxins. The linear range of AuNF- and LM-based strips for TTX was 9.49\u2013330.98 ng/mL and 5.40\u2013443.19 ng/ mL, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of AuNF- and LM-based strips was determined to be 9.49 ng/mL and 5.40 ng/mL, respectively. In summary, the developed ICTS based on AuNF and LM signal probes displayed enhancement of sensitivity and provided rapid and specific detection of TTX.\nKEYWORDS\ntetrodotoxin, monoclonal antibody, immunochromatography strip, detection, latex microsphere, gold nanoflower\n1 Introduction\nTetrodotoxin (TTX) derived from pufferfish is considered a non-protein marine toxin (Mebs et al., 1995). TTX causes paralysis by selectively coupling to voltage-gated sodium ion channels which interfere with nerve transmission (Bane et al., 2014). As a highly toxic neurotoxin, it causes serious diseases such as headache, muscle weakness, numbness in the mouth and vomiting, and even fatal respiratory or heart failure (Denac et al., 2000; Noguchi and Ebesu et al., 2001; Hwang and Noguchi et al., 2007). Previous studies have revealed that only 0.5\u20133 mg of TTX can lead to death in adults, and the LD50 of mice injected intraperitoneally is 80 \u03bcg/kg (Chain et al., 2017). Accidental consumption of pufferfish causes many cases of poisoning every year (Shkembi et al., 2021). In 2008, a total of 141 patients were hospitalized, with a mortality rate of up to 12% in Bangladesh (Islam et al., 2011). Hence, it is urgent to develop specific, sensitive, and fast assays for TTX detection."

However, these experimental methods either require expensive equipment or highly trained personnel and significant laboratory infrastructure. The Lateral flow immunochromatography strip (LFICS), a popular and promising point-of-care testing (POCT) strategy with the outstanding features of low cost, high sensitivity, simplicity, speediness, and high specificity, has been used for the rapid determination of residues and contaminants in foods and environments (Liang et al., 2022). However, traditional competitive LFICS usually uses gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as signal reporters to detect small molecules (Ling et al., 2020). The sensitivity of AuNPs is relatively low due to their insufficient brightness and small particle size (Shen et al., 2017). Recently, researchers have been working on building different enhanced signal reporters to increase the sensitivity of LFICS and the precision of medical treatments (Loynachan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021a; Li et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023). For example, WS2, MoS2, gold nanoflower (AuNF), and latex microsphere (LM) have already been used, and these materials have the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratio and easy preparation (Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). WS2 and MoS2 are often used in conjunction with fluorescence reporters, while AuNF and LM can be used as reporters themselves (Yang et al., 2015; Zuo et al., 2016). In addition, it has been shown that the colloidal and optical properties are very important to the sensitivity of the test strip (Ji et al., 2015). AuNF with the advantages of colloid stability and high optical extinction was introduced to increase the sensitivity of test strips (Petrakova et al., 2019). Moreover, AuNF with a larger specific surface area could improve the immobilization yield of antibodies. Previous findings showed that the sensitivity of LFICS based on AuNF for the testing of lead (Pb) ions was improved (Jia et al., 2022). Ji et al. reported that AuNF with advanced optical and colloidal properties exhibited more sensitivity by 10 times than AuNP for AFB1 detection. Latex microsphere with the advantages of good optical brightness and stability has gained great attention. As a sensitive label, LMs were applied in many areas. For example, a fluorescent retrograde tracer prepared by labeling LMs with rhodamine was used in the peripheral nervous system (Colin et al., 1989). An immunoassay strip using LMs as an enhanced signal reporter was sensitive (LOD = 25 ng/mL), reliable, and rapid for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing (Shen et al., 2017). Xu et al. and Ling et al. used LM- and AuNP-based strips to detect cadmium ions, respectively, showing that the sensitivity of the LM-based strip is approximately seven times that of the AuNP-based strip (Ling et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021).\nIn this study, we prepared flower-like gold nanoflower and latex microsphere probes to label monoclonal antibodies for developing immunochromatographic test strips for on-site and rapid TTX detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop the LM-based strips with LM as enhanced signal reporters for the detection of TTX in food."

            "text": "Traditional immunochromatographic test strips were often developed based on AuNP which was used as labeling material. Although, AuNP was easy to be synthesized and commonly used, the insufficient brightness of AuNP leads to low sensitivity of the test strips (Omidfar et al., 2013). For the purpose of improving the sensitivity of immunochromatographic test strips, multibranched gold nanoflower (AuNF) exhibiting high brightness was prepared in the study. The schematic diagram of the preparation of AuNF and AuNF probes is shown in Figure 1A. AuNF was synthesized using AuNP as gold seeds (Zhang et al., 2019), and then anti-TTX mAb were labeled with the prepared AuNF to form AuNF probes. As shown in Figure 1B, nanoparticles with flower-like structures and multi-branches spreading out from a solid core were clearly observed. The size of AuNFs was determined to be approximately (60 \u00b1 5) nm by counting the average diameter of 100 AuNFs. The features of the AuNF in TEM images were semblable to those described in a previous publication (Ji et al., 2015), meaning that AuNF with good quality was already prepared. Then, the preparation of the AuNF probe was\nFIGURE 2 Representation of the AuNF-based strip (n = 3). (A) Schematic diagram of the developed AuNF-based strip.

It has been reported that the amount of anti-TTX mAb and pH of AuNF solution can affect AuNF probe synthesis (Wang et al., 2018). The optimum ratio of AuNF solution to anti-TTX mAb was determined to be 100: 1, and the optimum pH was adjusted using 2 \u03bcL of 0.1 M K2CO3 (Supplementary Figures S1A, B). The optimal concentrations of goat anti-mouse IgG and TTXOVA were 0.67 mg/mL and 328 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Supplementary Figures S2A, B). The optimal amount of AuNF probes was 4 \u03bcL (Supplementary Figure S2C). The maximum absorption peaks of AuNF and AuNF probes were observed at 610 nm and 620 nm, respectively (Figure 1C), indicating some shift between AuNF probes and AuNF. Moreover, dynamic light scattering (DLS) results also showed that there are some differences between the diameter of AuNF and that after the anti-TTX mAb labeling (Supplementary Figure S3A). All these results showed that AuNF and AuNF probes were successfully prepared and could be used for further study.\nFIGURE 3 Synthesis and characterization of LM. (A) Synthesis process of LM probes.

            "text": "The obtained AuNF probes were sprayed into the probe pads, and an AuNF-based strip was developed (Figure 2A). A process competition was conducted on AuNF-based strips. If samples contain TTX antigen, AuNF probes could first react with TTX, so there is no AuNF probe captured by coating antigen TTX-OVA immobilized on the NC membrane. Thus, only the C line displayed blue color. When there is no or little TTX contained in the samples, AuNF probes labeled with anti-TTX mAb could be specifically captured by TTX-OVA complete antigen, so both T and C lines showed blue color. To appraise the specificity of the AuNF-based strip test, other marine toxins (\u03bc-CTX KIIIA, \u03b1B-VxXXIVA-CTX, APETx_2, BDS-I, SN311, and OA) were used in the experiment. An immunochromato-reader was used to read the absorbance of the T and C lines. As interpreted in Figure 2B, the developed AuNF-based test strip was used to detect TTX, and the result indicated no blue color on the T line when TTX was added to the sample pad. By decreasing the concentration of TTX, the blue color of the T line in Figures 2C, D gets darker and darker. According to Figure 2E, the concentration of TTX was linearly related in the range of 9.49\u2013330.98 ng/mL and the LOD was confirmed to be 9.49 ng/ mL. The calibration equation was Y = 0.5186X + 1.40677 (R2 = 0.99514), where X represents the logarithm of the TTX concentration. The accuracy of the AuNF-based strip is shown in Supplementary Table S1. The recovery range rates of inter- and intra-assays were 91.96%\u2013101.21% and 88.85%\u2013102.88%, and the average recovery rate was 97.76% and 97.09%, respectively. The average coefficient of variation (CV) of inter- and intra-assays was less than 10%. It was reported that the LOD of the immunoassay method based on gold nanoparticles for TTX-spiked samples was measured to be 40 ng/mL and 10 \u03bcg/kg (Zhou et al., 2010; Li et al., 2020). Compared to the test strip using conventional AuNPs as signal reporters, the multi-branched AuNF of size (60 \u00b1 5) nm could\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org06\nbe used in LFICS, combining quantum dot nanobeads and AuNFs to significantly enhance the sensitivity of the test strip with a LOD of 0.2 ng/mL. However, the testing results could not be observed with the naked eye(Shen et al., 2017). The aforementioned results proved that the immunochromatographic test strip developed based on AuNF has the merits of high sensitivity and is easy to be observed with naked eyes."

            "text": "LM not only has a large specific surface but also provides abundant carboxyl groups to bind with anti-TTX mAb (Li et al., 2021b), so LM was used as a sensitive label to conjugate with antiTTX mAb for the development of an LM-based strip in this study. The schematic diagram of the preparation of LM and the LM probe is shown in Figure 3A. Red LM was carboxyl modified by EDC, and the activated LM was labeled with anti-TTX mAb. As shown in Figure 3B, the TEM images clearly showed round and uniform LMs. The size distribution of LMs was determined to be approximately (200 \u00b1 5) nm. In addition, DLS results also showed that there are some differences between the diameter of LM and that after the anti-TTX mAb labeling (Supplementary Figure\nS3B). For the best performance of the LM probe, some factors, including the color of the latex microspheres, optimal pH values, and the amount of EDC and anti-TTX mAb, were optimized. The suitable color of latex microspheres for the TTX antibody is red (Supplementary Figure S4A). The optimal pH values for MES activation buffer and Gly buffer were 6 and 6.5, respectively (Supplementary Figures S4B, C). The quantities of EDC and antiTTX mAb were optimized to be 1.5 mg and 10 \u03bcL, respectively (Supplementary Figures S4D, E). The concentrations of goat antimouse IgG (0.5 mg/mL) and TTX-OVA (32.80 \u03bcg/mL) (Supplementary Figures S5A, B), together with the amount of LM probes (4 \u03bcL), were also optimized (Supplementary Figure S5C)."

With increasing TTX concentrations, the red color shown in Figure 4B becomes lighter and lighter according to the LM-based strip test. As illustrated in Figures 4C, D, the calibration equation was Y = 0.41798X + 1.20622 (R2 = 0.99809) with a linear range of 5.40\u2013443.19 ng/mL and LOD of 5.40 ng/mL. The precision of the LM-based strip is illustrated in Supplementary Table S2. The recovery rates of inter- and intra-assays were in the range of 95%\u2013105.09% and 83.74%\u2013 107.90%, and the average recovery rate was 99.48% and 96.08%, respectively. The average CV of inter- and intra-assays was less than 10%. Compared to the sensitivity (LOD = 9.49 ng/mL or 9 \u03bcg/kg) of AuNF-based strips developed previously, LM as a signal reporter showed more sensitivity (LOD = 5.40 ng/mL or 5 \u03bcg/kg). The possible reason for the higher sensitivity of LMbased strips may be due to the larger size of LMs of (200 \u00b1 5) nm than that of AuNF of (60 \u00b1 5) nm. In addition, the LOD of both AuNF- and LM-based strips were lower than the maximum permissible limit for TTX (2.2 mg/kg) set by Japan and TTX (44 \u03bcg/kg) set by the Netherlands (Lago et al., 2015; Kosker et al., 2018). Our results indicated that the developed LM-based strip test with the advantages of high specificity, low detection limit (lower than the national standards of Japan and the Netherlands), wide detection range (5.40\u2013443.19 ng/mL), and rapid detection (10 min) could meet the detection requirements of tetrodotoxin."

The T line becomes lighter and lighter as the spiked TTX concentration increases (Figures 6A, B), indicating that the AuNF/LM-based strips have good reliability and practicability for TTX detection. Moreover, the reliability of the established methods was further confirmed by commercially available ELISA kit, and the TTX detection results of the actual samples and the matrix spiked with TTX (Supplementary Table S3) indicated that the results of AuNF/ LM-based strip methods were in agreement with those of the ELISA assay."
