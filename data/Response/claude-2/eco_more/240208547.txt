 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Study the convergence properties of fictitious play in other fair division settings beyond cake cutting, such as allocating indivisible goods or bads. Does it still converge to equitable outcomes? How does the rate of convergence compare?

2. Extend the analysis to settings with more than 2 players engaged in repeated fair division. Does an analogue of the exploitation phenomenon still hold? Can equitable outcomes be enforced? 

3. Consider repeated cake cutting settings where the cake is not identical each round, but drawn from some distribution. How does this impact the strategies and guarantees?

4. Explore whether the results hold for other learning dynamics beyond fictitious play, such as regret matching or exponential weights.

5. Run experiments to complement the theoretical analysis. Implement the strategies computationally and evaluate their empirical performance on simulated instances or with human subjects.
