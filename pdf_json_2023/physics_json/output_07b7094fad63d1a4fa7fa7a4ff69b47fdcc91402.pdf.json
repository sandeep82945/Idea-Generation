    "abstractText": "Large quantities of solutions containing oxalic acid and nitric acid are produced from nuclear fuel reprocessing, but oxalic acid must be removed before nitric acid and plutonium ions can be recovered in these solutions. The degradation of oxalic acid with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst in nitric acid solutions has the characteristics of a fast and stable reaction, recyclable catalyst, and no introduction of impurity ions into the system. This method is one of the preferred alternatives to the currently used reaction of KMnO4 with oxalic acid but lacks theoretical support. Therefore, this study attempts to clarify the reaction mechanism of the method. First, there was no induction period for this catalytic reaction, and no evidence was found that the nitrous acid produced in the solution could have an effect on oxalic acid degradation. Furthermore, oxidation intermediates (structures of Pt\u2013O) were formed through this reaction between NO3 \u2212 adsorbed on the active sites and Pt on the catalyst surface, but H greatly promoted the reaction. Additionally, oxalic acid degradation through the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction occurred between oxalic acid molecules (HOOC\u2013COOH) and Pt\u2013O, with $OOC\u2013COOH, which is easily self-decomposable especially in acidic solution, generated simultaneously, and finally CO2 was produced.",

            "text": "In nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, oxalic acid is commonly used as a precipitant or complexing agent to separate actinide ions from other elements through the formation of undissolved actinide oxalic acids in aqueous solution.1\u20137 For example, plutonium is recycled through plutonium oxalic acid precipitation from solution during a uranium\u2013plutonium co-decontamination separation process that dates back to the 1940s.3 However, aer the precipitation step, small amounts of plutonium oxalic acid solids remain in the radioactive ltrate, and small amounts of plutonium must be extracted from the ltrate. Untreated ltrates containing an excessive addition of oxalic acid are not favorable for purication and recovery of trace amounts of plutonium. Therefore, oxalic acid must be removed from ltrates as much as possible to reach the limiting oxalic acid concentration (10\u22124 to 10\u22125 M).6,7 At present, this method for oxalic acid in ltrates oxidized by KMnO4 is normally used in nuclear fuel reprocessing plants.

Therefore, alternative methods to replace this method are needed.\nVarious methods of oxalic acid destruction, such as the addition of oxidizing agents,10,11 electrolytic oxidation12,13 and using a catalyst in nitrate solution,6\u20138,14\u201320 have been developed to replace the method for oxalic acid oxidized by KMnO4. H2O2 is the most popular reagent for the addition of oxidizing agents in this approach and has the advantage of not importing additional impurity ions into the reaction system, but its drawback is that oxalic acid degradation to limiting oxalic acid concentration is excessively prolonged due to the low reaction rate. Also, in the electrolysis process, the required equipment is complex and can lead to precipitation of metal ions during lengthy operation times. Oxalic acid degradation using catalysts in nitric acid solutions is a research hotspot, and depends on catalysts being soluble in water, and these are classied into heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. In homogeneous catalysis, metal ions, such as vanadium ions14 and manganese ions,6\u20138 are used as catalysts or combined with ozone and ultraviolet irradiation, with manganese ions being the most mature and widely studied.\nOxalic acid degradation in nitric acid solution using manganese(II) as a catalyst is straightforward, but this method has an induction period and still requires the import of trace amounts of manganese salts in each treatment. In addition, oxalic acid degradation to limiting oxalic acid concentration by this method is lengthy, and the prolonged reaction process at elevated temperatures causes severe erosion damage to the alloy reactor.

The oxalic acid degradation proceeds in nitric acid, using supported platinum as a catalyst, similar to that of formic acid. Therefore, in order to obtain the reaction process of oxalic acid degradation with Pt/ SiO2 as a catalyst in nitric acid solution, the effect of the nitrous acid concentration on oxalic acid degradation should rst be claried. A series of experiments in different acid media were thus designed.\nFig. 1 and 2 show the change in concentration of oxalic acid and nitrous acid in solution over time during oxalic acid degradation using Pt/SO2 as a catalyst with the successive addition of NaNO3/NaNO2 solution into sulfuric acid solution. A decrease in oxalic acid concentration with the addition of NaNO2/NaNO3 solution was evident compared to the control group, and the decrease in oxalic acid concentration with the addition of NaNO2 solution was consistently smaller than that of NaNO3 in Fig. 1. The nitrous acid concentration with the addition of NaNO2 solution was much greater than that of NaNO3 and approached saturation at 4 min, while the nitrous acid concentration with the addition of NaNO3 solution reached saturation at 10 min. The higher nitrous acid concentration did not accelerate oxalic acid degradation in this group with the addition of NaNO2 compared to NaNO3 during the period 4\u2013 10 min, indicating that oxalic acid degradation was barely affected by the nitrous acid concentration.\nIt is important to note in Fig. 1 that the decrease in oxalic acid concentration with the addition of NaNO2 solution was\n22760 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22758\u201322768\nconsistently smaller than that of NaNO3. In addition, the concentrations c(H+) and c(NO3\n\u2212) with the addition of NaNO2 solution were always lower than that of NaNO3, resulting from the H+ consumed by NO2\n\u2212 and some NO2 gas escaping from solution at the same time, as shown in Fig. 1 (2HNO2 / NO + NO2, NO2 + HNO2/HNO3 + NO). This result suggests NO3 \u2212/H+ has a positive contribution to oxalic acid degradation to some extent.\nFig. 3 and 4 show the change in oxalic acid concentration and nitrous acid concentration in solution over time during oxalic acid degradation with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst in the nitrous acid range in the concentration range from 1 M to 5 M.

However, during the rst t min of oxalic acid degradation in Fig. 4, the nitrous acid concentration at different nitric acid concentrations changed continuously. The saturation value of nitrous acid concentration in Fig. 4 decreased with the nitric acid concentration. These results show the low correlation between the nitrous acid concentration and oxalic acid degradation.\nTogether, strong evidence proving that nitrous acid was the primary oxidizing substance involved in oxalic acid degradation was not found from Fig. 1\u20134. Indeed, the results in Fig. 1\u20134 indicate that the nitrous acid in solution had almost no effect on oxalic acid degradation compared to NO3\n\u2212 and H+, which could more reasonably be explained by the fact that nitrous acid is considered to be a by-product of the catalytic reactions in this study."

Fig. 7 shows k0 in solution with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst in the nitric acid concentration range from 1\u20138 M, showing the clear relationship between c0(HNO3) and k0, which directly indicated that nitric acid was involved in the catalytic reactions. The goodness of t of ln[k0] and ln[c0(HNO3)] was 0.9951 based on the calculation of the experimental data in the nitric acid range 1\u20135 M, and the reaction order for the nitric acid concentration in the catalytic reactions was 0.2047.\nHowever, the nitric acid range from 5 M to 8 M did not show a clear relationship between c0(HNO3) and k0, and the degradation rate of oxalic acid decreased rapidly with increasing the nitric acid concentration, tending to reach a steady value. This may be due, on the one hand, to the fact that the diffusion of oxalic acid to the catalysts is more and more signicantly hindered by the solute as the reaction progresses, which increases with the concentration of nitric acid in the solution, leading to a decrease in the rate of catalytic reactions. On the other hand, the rate of HNO3 molecular oxidation of oxalic acid is signicantly accelerated with the increase of nitric acid in the solution. This somewhat slows down the impact of the decrease in the rate of oxalic acid degradation caused by the decrease in the rate of catalytic reactions with increasing the nitric acid concentration.\n3.2.4 Effect of the reaction temperature on k0. Fig. 8 shows k0 in solution with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst in the temperature range 30\u2013100 \u00b0C.

The activation energy of the catalytic reactions was thus small, indicating that the catalytic reactions can easily occur.\nThe value of ln(k0) at 30 \u00b0C deviated from the tted curve, probably due to the low temperature of the reaction system, which did not provide sufficient activation energy for the catalytic reactions. The value of ln(k0) at 100 \u00b0C also deviated\n22762 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22758\u201322768\nfrom the tting curve. This may be due to the fact at 100 \u00b0C the rate at which the reactants diffuse from the solution to the catalyst surface was lower than the rate of reaction between the reactants and active sites or active species. This indicates that the degradation of oxalic acid occurs at or near the catalyst surface.\nFurther, some evidence for the involvement of NO3 \u2212/H+ in the catalytic reactions could be found in Fig. 1 and 7. As a result, the effects of NO3\n\u2212 and H+ on oxalic acid degradation were investigated separately and are described in the next section."

This may be because the NO3\n\u2212 in the solution barely diffuses on the catalyst surface, resulting from the fact that each NO3\n\u2212 is rmly bound by hydrogen bonding in a cage made of water molecules and that the amount of NO3\n\u2212 is well below the amount of water molecules.24,25 In the c(NaNO3) range 1\u20132 M, oxalic acid degradation increased with the increasing c(NaNO3), resulting from the fact that the amount of NO3\n\u2212 that can diffuse out to the catalyst surface unbound by water molecules rapidly increases with increasing c(NaNO3). In the c(NaNO3) range 2\u20135 M, the amount of adsorbed sites on the catalyst surface was much\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nsmaller than the nearby NO3 \u2212, resulting in a substantial buffer against oxalic acid degradation compared to the c(NaNO3) range 1\u20132 M. Moreover, the fact that H+ obviously promotes oxalic acid degradation could be found by comparing the k0 of each sodium nitrate solution experiment with the corresponding nitric acid solution. From the above discussion, we conclude the following hypothesis:\nNO3 \u2212 is readily adsorbed on the catalyst surface and the probability of direct NO3 \u2212 activation by Pt is relatively low, but H+ has an effective boost effect on the NO3 \u2212 activation reaction.\n3.3.2 H+ effect on k0. The effect of H + on k0 is discussed based on 2 M c(NO3 \u2212) separately in the c(H+) range 2\u20134 M (Fig. 10) and in the c(H+) range 0.001\u20132 M (Fig. 11). Fig. 10 shows k0 in solution with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst based on 2 M nitric acid solution with varying concentrations of H2SO4/NaNO3 added to adjust c(H +)/c(NO3 \u2212). In the c(H2SO4) range 0\u20131 M, the oxalic acid degradation effectively increased with c(H+), suggesting that an appropriate amount of H+ promotes catalytic reactions to occur. This result agrees with the hypothesis. In the c(H2SO4) range 1\u20132 M, the oxalic acid degradation slowly decreased with c(H+), suggesting that excess H+ promotes catalytic reactions to occur. The negative effect of excess H+ may result from excess SO4 2\u2212/HSO4 \u2212 in the solution competing with the reactant for sites on the catalyst surface,26,27 and by increasing c(H2SO4), the promoting effect of H + hardly increased substantially. In the c(NaNO3) range 0\u20132 M, oxalic acid degradation decreased with increasing c(NO3 \u2212). This result indicates that excess NO3 \u2212 makes a clearly negative contribution to the catalytic reactions, while the same result was obtained by an alternative experiment with potassium nitrate used in order to exclude Na+ interference. The effect of excess NO3\n\u2212 on oxalic acid degradation was similar to that of excess sulfuric acid, but the reduction in oxalic acid degradation due to excess NO3 \u2212 exceeded the effect of excess sulfuric acid at the\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22758\u201322768 | 22763\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This phenomenon may be due to the fact that HSO4 \u2212 can be given H+ to activate NO3 \u2212 adsorbed on the active sites during the diffusion\u2013collision process between HSO4 \u2212 and the catalytic surface, but NO3 \u2212 cannot.\nFig. 11 shows k0 in solution with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst based on 2 M nitric acid solution with varying concentrations of sodium hydroxide added to adjust c(H+). In the log(H+) range\u22127 to\u22123, oxalic acid was a little degraded, as observed based on the absence of gas from the reaction solution, indicating that the catalytic reactions did not occur in this log(H+) range. There was a clear linear relationship between k0 and log(H\n+) in the log(H+) range \u22123 to \u22121, and the pattern of k0 and log(H+) in the range from \u22121 to 0.3013 was similar to a partial parabola. Clearly, the patterns of k0 and log(H\n+) were different in the log(H+) range \u22123 to \u22121 and \u22121 to 0.3013, suggesting that oxalic acid degradation in these two components was affected by different factors. The pattern of k0 in the log(H\n+) range \u22123 to \u22121 was attributed to the promotion of H+ to the NO3\n\u2212 activation reaction, and that in the range \u22121 to 0.3013 was attributed to another reaction rather than the NO3\n\u2212 activation reaction. Furthermore, the patterns of k0 and log(H\n+) were similar with the concentration of oxalic acid molecules and log(H+) in the range from \u22121 to 0.3013, and the ionization degree of the oxalic acid carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) was controlled by the c(H+) in solution. This result reveals that the \u2013 COOH of oxalic acid molecules were correlated with oxalic acid degradation, and that the ionized oxalic acid was hardly degraded in the catalytic reactions.\nIn general, there are two ways in which organic acids are degraded via the destruction of the \u2013COOH in catalytic reactions. The rst is that the Pt\u2013H structure arises from the reaction between the carboxyl group and the nano-platinum, and the electron of the activated H atoms are transferred to oxidation intermediates via the potential difference at the catalyst surface, with H+ produced simultaneously.28\u201330 The second is that the oxidation intermediates are reduced by the H atoms of the carboxyl group via the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.30\u201332 However, for both pathways, the oxidation intermediates must be present on the catalyst surface, and the nanoplatinum of the active ingredient of the catalyst readily oxidizes to the Pt\u2013O structure.33\u201337\n3.4 Pt\u2013O produced from the reaction between NO3 \u2212 and nano-platinum\nThis section briey described how the Pt\u2013O structure was found as the oxidation intermediates from the NO3\n\u2212 activation reaction, which supports and enriches the hypothesis from the plots in Fig. 12\u201314.\nIn the Raman and XPS experiments, the selected catalyst grains were evenly divided into two parts. One part was immersed in pure water, and the other in a solution of 5M nitric acid for 2 h, washed three times in pure water, and nally dried in a nitrogenous atmosphere for 24 h, and separately ground to a powder for oxygen-free preservation.\nThe Raman spectra for the catalyst treated with 5 M nitric acid showed a different absorption peak at 805 nm compared to the control sample in Fig. 12, and the 805 nm peak was\n22764 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22758\u201322768\nattributed to the structure of Pt\u2013O,38,39 which revealed that the oxidation intermediates were Pt\u2013O derived from the reaction between NO3\n\u2212 and the nano-platinum. The Pt 4f XPS spectrum obtained from the catalyst treated with 5 M nitric acid is shown in Fig. 13. The spectrum exhibited a dominant doublet at the binding energy (BE) of 74.9 eV corresponding to Pt(IV), a doublet at 72.4 corresponding to Pt(II), and a doublet at 71.2 corresponding to Pt0.40 The concentration ratios of Pt0/Pt(II)/Pt(IV) were 0.89 : 0.064 : 0.046 for the catalyst treated with pure water, and 0.1 : 0.702 : 0.198 for the catalyst\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It was found that most of the Pt0 on the surface of the catalyst was oxidized in the form of Pt(II)/Pt(IV) through treatment with 5 M nitric acid, and the Pt(II) and Pt(IV) on the catalyst surface were commonly PtO and PtO2.40,41 These results revealed the production of Pt\u2013O from the reaction between NO3\n\u2212 and the nano-platinum.

Prior to EPR detection, two single pretreated Pt/SiO2 samples were placed in aqueous and methanol solutions, respectively, before DMPO was added to the solution for the trapping reaction.\nThe DMPO\u2013OH and DMPOX signals were obtained in the aqueous solution condition in Fig. 14a. These results suggest that some oxidation intermediates were present on the surface of the catalyst pretreated with nitric acid, and that the structure of Pt\u2013O was most plausible as the oxidation intermediates, considering that no trace of peroxide radicals or other reactive species were found at the same time. DMPOX generally is derived from the oxidation of DMPO\u2013OH adducts in aqueous solution,42,43 but unexpectedly a DMPOX signal was evident in the presence of sufficient DMPO relative to the oxidation intermediates, and only the DMPOX signal was obtained in the methanol solution condition shown in Fig. 14b. This result suggests that the source of the DMPOX signal was not only that produced from the oxidation of DMPO\u2013OH, but also from reactions between DMPO and the oxidation intermediates. Therefore, the formation processes of DMPOX could be determined and are shown in Fig. 15a and b, and the DMPO\u2013OH adducts in Fig. 15c."

The oxidation intermediates that can be produced by the reaction between nitrous acid and nano-platinum are still uncertain, but nitrous acid did not affect the experimental results in this work. The specic process of Pt\u2013O formation from the reaction between NO3\n\u2212 and the nano-platinum requires further investigation. No evident self-decomposition of oxalic acid adsorbed on a catalyst was found. Catalytic reactions should be considered to have no induction period, and if an induction period exists, its duration should not exceed the mixing time of the reagent. The feasibility of applying this method to industrial production needs to be investigated. In industrial production, it is necessary to take into account that certain substances poison the catalyst, and that this substance is continuously produced from the irradiated decomposition of an extractive agent containing phosphorus in solution.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
