    "abstractText": "The present paper investigates the use of the magnetic hysteresis loop technique to nondestructively evaluate microstructural degradation in heat-resistant martensitic (HRM) steels. The degradation impairs the safe operation of thermal power plants and it is thus essential to periodically assess it using nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. In this contribution, HRM steels are thermally aged up to 16,000 h at 675 \u25e6C to simulate the microstructural degradation, then the changes in the magnetic coercivity, hardness, and microstructure are systematically characterized and the relations between them are determined. Both coercivity and hardness decrease with thermal aging duration, which can be interpreted in terms of the microstructure parameters\u2019 evolution based on the pinning of crystal defects on domain walls and dislocations. Coercivity and hardness share the same softening trend with aging time, and good linear relations between coercivity, hardness, and microstructure parameters are found. These results provide a key to understanding the magnetic parameter evolution in HRM steels and suggest the possibility of using magnetic technologies for the NDE of microstructure degradation in thermal power plants.",

            "text": "Heat-resistant martensitic (HRM) steels are widely employed in thermal and nuclear power plants, owing to their good creep and oxidation resistance, together with excellent thermal properties and low cost as compared to bainitic steels and austenitic steels [1\u20136]. The microstructural degradation of HRM steels during operation at elevated temperatures impairs the performance of these steels in thermal and nuclear power plants. This degradation arises from microstructure changes, including the coarsening of precipitates, recovery of dislocations, and recrystallization of martensitic laths [7\u201310]. Pipeline segments located at bending elbows, the heat-affected zones of welding joints, and excessively higher-temperature locations are prone to premature failure due to rapid microstructural degradation [11\u201313], which is a key issue concerning the safe operation of power plants. As a consequence, it is essential to periodically assess the microstructural degradation condition of HRM steels using nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. Currently, the microstructural degradation state is directly investigated using surface metallographic replication or inferred from surface hardness; however, these techniques cannot shed light on the interior of steels. Conventional ultrasonic techniques based on backscatter or velocity are only applicable at the last stage, prior to failure. Thus, alternative NDE techniques capable of revealing the microstructural degradation condition of the interior of HRM steels during their whole service life are desired. Specifically, magnetic hysteresis loop (HL) technology attracts great attention because magnetic properties are sensitive to the evolutions of crystal defects, such as dislocations, precipitates, and boundaries [14\u201317], and is thus a promising means for detecting microstructural changes in HRM\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4865. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15144865 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4865 2 of 11\nsteels. Moreover, magnetic techniques are able to investigate the microstructure beneath the surface, which can be easily achieved by tuning the frequency of the excitation current. The changing trend of magnetic coercivity in served, aged, or crept HRM steels has been investigated in previous reports. For instance, Liu et al. [18], Karimian et al. [19], and Wilson et al. [20] investigated the changing trend of magnetic parameters in P9 steel after approximately 11 years\u2019 service at 520 \u25e6C and found that the coercivity had decreased. Ryu et al. [21] found that the coercivity of 12Cr-W steels monotonously decreased with thermal aging time at 700 \u25e6C, and Bong et al. [22] reported the same tendency in 9Cr-1Mo steels aged at 690 \u25e6C. As for the creep test, the coercivity of 11Cr-3.45W steels crept at 700 \u25e6C and 60 MPa decreased with duration [23], while that of P91 steels crept at 500 \u25e6C and 290 MPa increased with duration [24]. Although these reports demonstrate the potential of using the magnetic technique for the nondestructive evaluation of HRM steels, the quantitative dependance of magnetic parameters on crystal defects still remains unclear, which is the fundamental of NDE of HRM steels and needs to be determined. In this study, the relationships between coercivity, hardness, and crystal defects are explored. The microstructure parameters, including the spacing of precipitates, dislocation density, and martensitic lath width of the thermally aged P91 steel at different aging durations, are determined based on systematic microscopic analysis. The magnetic and mechanical properties are acquired via HL and hardness measurements, respectively, and their behaviors are interpreted based on the hindrance of crystal defects to the movement of domain walls (DWs) and dislocations. The corresponding relationships between magnetic properties, mechanical properties, and crystal defects are thus investigated based on these analyses."

            "text": "The steels investigated in the present study were removed from the commercial P91 pipe (outer diameter: 508 mm; thickness: 62 mm; normalizing temperature: 1047\u20131067 \u25e6C; tempering temperature: 760\u2013773 \u25e6C). The chemical composition of the investigated steel is shown in Table 1. To simulate the microstructure degradation of P91 steel during service, accelerated aging at a higher temperature (675 \u25e6C) than the service temperature (about 593 \u25e6C) was performed by isothermally holding the steels for different durations (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and 16,000 h). The Larson\u2013Miller method can be used to connect the aging time to the service condition. By using the Larson\u2013Miller (LM) relationship, (lgt1 + C)T1 = (lgt2 + C)T2, where t is time in hours, T is temperature in K, and C is LM constant, (9.7 for P91 steel [5]), the accelerated aging duration of 16,000 h at 675 \u25e6C matches about 40 years\u2019 service at 593 \u25e6C, which is the average lifetime of power plants. The size of the aged steels was about 80 mm \u00d7 62 mm \u00d7 20 mm, and the specimens used for magnetic, mechanical, and microstructural evaluation were cut out from these aged steels. Though these steels were aged at 675 \u25e6C in air for a long duration, the influence of oxidation could be avoided by cutting the specimens far away (more than 3 mm) from the oxidation surface.\nThe effects of the evolution of microstructure on the aspects of precipitation size and spacing, dislocation density, and martensitic lath width for the thermally aged P91 steels at varying durations were systematically observed using electron microscopy. The size and spacing of precipitates were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The spacing of precipitates was calculated using s = (A/N)0.5, where s is the spacing of precipitates, A is the area of the field of SEM view, and N is the number of precipitates in\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4865 3 of 11\nthis field. At least 250 precipitates located at 10 different fields of view were employed to calculate the average size and spacing of precipitates. The lath width of martensite and the recovery of dislocations were determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The lath width is defined as the length of the minor axis of the martensitic lath. At least 10 different locations with an area of 70 \u00b5m2 each were chosen to evaluate the lath width of martensite. The specimens used for TEM observation were prepared through a twin jet electro-polisher (Struers TenuPol-5) in a solution of 5% perchloric acid and 95% ethanol (Vol. %) at \u221225 \u00b0C. The dislocation density was calculated based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Williamson\u2013Hall method [25]. The XRD measurement was carried out using Co K\u03b1 radiation (~1.788 \u00c5) under a voltage of 30 kV. The precipitations were separated out from the matrix by electrolyzing, and the obtained powder was then analyzed using XRD and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) to reveal the crystal structure, weight percentage, and composition of the precipitations. The Vickers hardness was determined from an electro-polished specimen with a size of 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 5 mm, under a load of 5 kg, with at least ten measurements. Magnetic HLs were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Specimens with a length of 6 mm, width of 4 mm, and thickness of 0.6 mm were cut out by electrical discharge machining, ground, and further electro-polished to a thickness of 0.2 mm for VSM measurements. The maximum applied magnetic field was 10,000 Oe (796,000 Am\u22121), with a fine step size of 1 Oe in the regime of \u221250 and +50 Oe to acquire a more accurate coercivity."

This reason for this tendency lies in the fact that dislocations within a lath can either annihilate with each other or move and be absorbed into lath boundaries [26], and a larger number density of dislocations and smaller lath width will greatly accelerate the annihilation owing to the stored strain energy.\nThe measured martensitic lath width and calculated spacing of M23C6 precipitates in"

M23C6 precipitates along the PAGBs and SGBs in the as-received steels (Figure 3) could pin the boundaries and drag them from movement, therefore preventing the coarsening of the lath structure. Although the volume fraction remained almost the same during the thermal aging process [30,31], these M23C6 precipitates still underwent Ostwald ripening, i.e., big precipitates grew larger at the expense of dissolving small precipitates, resulting in a decrease in the number density and an increase in precipitate spacing. These changes reduce the pinning effect of M23C6 and thus lead to the coarsening of the lath width, resulting in a linear relationship between the lath width and the precipitation spacing (Figure 6).\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12\nnd drag them from movement, th r fore pr vent ng the arseni g of the lath structure.

The crucial point is to determine the leading factor at different aging stages. The stress field of dislocations can retard the movement of DWs and increase their coercivity. It is reported that coercivity changes linearly with the square root of dislocation density [32,33]. Unlike dislocations, nonmagnetic precipitates can pin the DWs because they can reduce the DW energy when they are embedded in the DWs. Therefore, an increase in precipitation spacing leads to a smaller coercivity. Coercivity is found to show a linear relation with Nd2 in Fe-Cu alloys due to the presence of Cu-rich precipitates [14,34], where N is the number density and d is the diameter of precipitates. Because the spacing of precipitates is in proportion to Nd2, coercivity will also show a linear relation with the spacing of precipitates. For the martensitic lath boundaries, the misorientation angle is very small (several degrees) [29,35], so it may not exert a great influence on coercivity because it is easy for the DWs to overcome the small exchange energy and anisotropy energy barrier across the lath boundary. The dependence of coercivity on the square root of dislocation density of the aged steels prior to 500 h is depicted in Figure 7a; interestingly, a nearly linear relationship can be observed. Similarly, a perfect linear relation was also found among the measured coercivity and spacing of M23C6 precipitates of the present P91 steels with aging durations larger than 500 h (Figure 7b). Therefore, it can be inferred from the changing tendency of coercivity, dislocations, and precipitates that the sharp reduction in coercivity at the early aging stage before 500 h mainly stems from the fast recovery of dislocations. Sternberk et. al. [33] also found that in short-time-tempered low alloy Cr-Mo steels the decisive factors which control the coercive force are the dislocations rather than the precipitates. The dislocation density for the late aging stage beyond 500 h remained nearly constant at low values (Figure 5), while the spacing of precipitates increased from 0.7 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm (Figure 3); consequently, the precipitates are believed to play an important role in controlling the coercivity at the late aging stage.
