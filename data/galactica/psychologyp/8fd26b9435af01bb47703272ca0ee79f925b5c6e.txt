The binding of calcium and magnesium ions to proteins is crucial for regulating heart contraction. However, other divalent cations, including xenobiotics, can accumulate in the myocardium and enter cardiomyocytes, where they can bind to proteins. In this article, we summarized the impact of these cations on myosin ATPase activity and EF-hand proteins, with special attention given to toxic cations. Optimal binding to EF-hand proteins occurs at an ionic radius close to that of Mg2+ and Ca2+. In skeletal Troponin C, Cd2+, Sr2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and trivalent lanthanides can substitute for Ca2+. As myosin ATPase is not a specific MgATPase, Ca2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Sr2+ could support myosin ATPase activity. On the other hand, Zn2+ and Cu2 significantly inhibit ATPase activity. The affinity to various divalent cations depends on certain proteins or their isoforms and can alter with amino acid substitution and post-translational modification. Cardiac EF-hand proteins and the myosin ATP-binding pocket are potential molecular targets for toxic cations, which could significantly alter the mechanical characteristics of the heart muscle at the molecular level. 1. conclusions Heart contraction is a highly coordinated process that involves the interplay of multiple molecules, including calcium- and magnesium-binding protein structures. Essential and xenobiotic divalent cations can accumulate in the myocardium, enter cardiac cells, and possibly bind to proteins, altering their functions. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10579 13 of 20
The EF-hand family proteins have binding sites optimized for highly charged cations that have effective ionic radii close to that of Mg2+ and Ca2+. However, only a few members of the EF-hand family viz. calmodulin, α-parvalbumin, skeletal troponin C, and smooth muscle RLC were investigated concerning their ability to bind various divalent cations. Calmodulin alters its conformation when at binding sites where Ca2+ has been substituted by bi- or trivalent cations with similar ionic radii viz. Cd2+, Sr2+, Pb2+, Cr2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Tb3+, Sm3+, and La+. Data on the affinity of Al3+ and Hg2+ to calmodulin are contradictory. Cd2+, Sr2+, Pb2+, Cr2+ stimulate the calmodulin activity to varying degrees. Zn2+, Al3+, and Hg2+ do not affect calmodulin activity at concentrations up to 1 mM. Na+, Mg2+, Ba2+, and Ni2+ had no distinct effect on calmodulin. α-parvalbumin, which is a canonical calcium-binding protein, was shown to bind Sr2+. In skeletal Troponin C, Cd2+, Sr2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and trivalent lanthanides such as La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, and Dy3+ can substitute for Ca2+. Smooth muscle RLC was shown to significantly alter affinity to divalent cations, i.e., Ca2+ and Mg2+, after amino acid substitutions. Thus, various cations, including essential Zn2+, Cu2+, etc., and toxic Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, may compete with Ca2+ for the calcium-binding sites of EF-hand proteins, altering their functions. Therefore, it is necessary to study whether cardiac troponin C and atrial and ventricular myosin regulatory light chains could be potential targets for these cations. As myosin ATPase is not specific, many cations, including Ca2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Sr2+, and Co2+, could support its ATPase activity. At the same time, some other cations such as Zn2+ and Cu2 significantly inhibit ATPase activity. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to fully understand the possibility of cations binding by a myosin ATP-binding pocket. It is important to consider the possibility that ATPase activity may be influenced not only by cation interactions with the myosin ATP-binding pocket but also by metal binding to the RLC. The main question is whether cations could influence myosin and troponin kinetics in real conditions. In healthy muscles, contraction occurs regardless of the small amount of e.g., CaATP that is always present in the muscle. However, in certain disturbances of cation homeostasis, concentration of physiologically relevant divalent ions can be increased, significantly affecting the kinetics of the interaction between myosin and actomyosin. For instance, Ca2+ can be increased and CaATPase activity may contribute to observed muscle rigidity and enhanced muscle thermogenesis as in malignant hyperthermia, or Cu2+ can significantly increase in Wilson disease [168], with uninvestigated possible effects. The potential effect apparently depends on the ionic radius and charge of the specific cation, its concentration in the cell, and the specific isoform of protein. In addition, the affinity of EF-hand-like Ca2+ binding sites or other targets for divalent ions may be significantly altered by amino acid substitutions or post-translational modification. We hope that our review will help to provide direction for further investigations.
