1. Investigate the prevalence of aberrant vertebral artery origin in different populations and ethnic groups.


2. Study the clinical implications of aberrant vertebral artery origin, including the risk of cerebrovascular events, such as stroke and transient ischemic attacks.


3. Explore the relationship between aberrant vertebral artery origin and other vascular anomalies, such as aortic arch variations and coronary artery disease.


4. Investigate the genetic basis of aberrant vertebral artery origin and identify the genes responsible for this variation.


5. Develop imaging techniques to accurately diagnose aberrant vertebral artery origin and assess its clinical significance.
