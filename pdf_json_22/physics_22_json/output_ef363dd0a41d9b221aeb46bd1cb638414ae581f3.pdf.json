It is found that, even in the Ising case, the three-spin subsystems have the long-range MQCs and the tripartite quantum correlations beyond the nearest-neighbor three spins can detect the quantum phase transition and obey the finite-size scaling around the critical point. Furthermore, in the XY model, we show that the two selected MQCs can indicate exactly the factorization point of the ground state for the anisotropic model in the thermodynamic and finite-size cases. Moreover, the spatial distribution of MQC based on entanglement negativity can attain to a much larger range by tuning the anisotropic parameter, and the newly defined MQC based on entanglement of formation can detect the bound entanglement in the three-spin subsystems when the entanglement negativity loses its efficacy.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Mn, 03.65.Ud, 05.30.Rt, 05.70.Jk\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum correlation [1\u20134] is a kind of important physical resources and plays the crucial role in the tasks of quantum in-\nformation processing, such as quantum secure communication and quantum computation. At the same time, quantum corre-\nlations also provide the effective tools for characterizing the properties of quantum many-body systems in the condensed\nmatter physics [5\u201314]. For example, Osterloh et al connected the critical phenomena [15] with quantum entanglement for\na class of magnetic systems [5], and showed that the nonanalyticity of energy can be manifested by the two-qubit con-\ncurrence [16] in the nearest and the next-nearest spins at the critical point. In the last two decades, bipartite quantum cor-\nrelations have been widely studied in quantum many-body systems, which helped develop the precise language for understanding quantum phase transition (QPT) in the interacting\nspin models.\nMultipartite quantum correlation (MQC) can reveal more\nricher properties in the ground state of many-body systems (see a review paper [17] and references therein). In particular,\nit was shown that the MQC can exist and indicate the QPT even when the bipartite quantum correlations disappear [18\u2013\n22]. Most of the existing studies are based on the MQC such as global entanglement [23], geometric entanglement [24],\nresidual entanglements [25\u201329], global quantum discord [30], multipartite nonlocality [31, 32] and so on, where complete\ninformation about the ground state is needed to calculate the correlation functions in the interacting multipartite spin sys-\ntems (for exemptions, see [33\u201345]). The MQCs have achieved\n\u2217Electronic address: renjun@hebtu.edu.cn \u2020Electronic address: zwang@hku.hk \u2021Electronic address: ykbai@semi.ac.cn\ngreat success in analyzing the QPTs for many-body systems,\nbut the measurement of complete information on ground state is very difficult in general. Therefore, it is desirable to study\nthe MQC in the reduced subsystems of the ground state, where on the one hand less information about the overall ground state\nis required and on the other hand more properties in the manybody system can be obtained in comparison to the two-site correlations. In this way, the main obstacle comes from the\nfact that the theory of MQC for multipartite mixed states is still not fully developed.\nBased on the biseparable criterion I2 [46], Giampaolo and Hiesmayr analyzed the relation between genuine tripartite entanglement and the QPT in the XY model where the reduced state of three adjacent spins is considered [47]. Similarly, uti-\nlizing genuine multipartite concurrence [48\u201350], the QPT and finite-size effects in the cluster-Ising model were studied via\nthe reduced state of three central spins which has the specific X-form [51]. According to genuine multipartite negativity [52], Hofmann et al showed the existence of short-range multipartite entanglements in the reduced states of the XY model and investigated the scaling property of tripartite entanglement in three nearest neighbor spins close to the QPT [53]. However, knowledge about the MQC beyond the next-nearest\ncase is still lacking, although the long-range multipartite entanglement close to the critical point in the XXZ model was detected with the help of entanglement witness [54]. Moreover, it is still an open problem that whether or not the MQC\nbeyond the adjacent three spins can detect the QPT and obey the finite-size scaling. In addition, a good candidate for the\nlong-range MQCs should be effectively controlled and able to capture the interesting properties of many-body systems,\nfor example, the factorization property of ground state in the anisotropicXY model [55\u201359].\nIn this paper, we focus on the spatial distribution of MQCs in three-spin reduced states of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XY chain, and study the properties of criticality and factor-\n2 ization in the multipartite systems via the tripartite quantum correlations. The four intoduced MQC measures are based on\nentanglement negativity [60] and the entanglement of formation [61], which are computable and have the larger spatial\ndistributions beyond next-nearest-neighbor three spins. It is found that the tripartite quantum correlations in reduced sub-\nsystems can detect the ordered-nonordered transition of Ising model and obey the finite-size scaling even beyond the near-\nest neighbor cases. Furthermore, we show that the two selected MQCs can indicate exactly the factorization point of the anisotropic XY chain in both the thermodynamic limit and the finite size case. In particular, it is revealed that the spa-\ntial distribution of MQC can be effectively modulated by the anisotropic parameter of the model, and the long-range bound\nentanglement [62, 63] can be discriminated via our newly defined MQC based on entanglement of formation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the anisotropic XY model and the four utilized MQCs. Next, the spatial distribution of MQCs and their critical behaviors in the Ising case are studied in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, the MQC mod-\nulation, the factorization property, and bound entanglement in the XY chain are investigated. Finally, some discussions and a brief summary of main results are given in Sec. V."

The parameter \u03b3 ranging from 0 to 1 represents the anisotropic property of the system, and the chain is referred to as the Ising model for \u03b3 = 1 and isotropic XY model for \u03b3 = 0. In the thermodynamic limit (L \u2192 \u221e), the ground state of the many-body systems undergoes a quantum phase transition at the critical point \u03bbc = 1. At the phase transition, the correlation length diverges as \u03be \u223c 1/|\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc| [58, 59], but it was pointed out that the two-spin entanglement\nlength is short-ranged [5]. In this work, we will focus on the spatial distribution of MQCs and the related critical phenom-\nena in the spin model.\nThe XY chain is one of the few models for which the ground state and its reduced states can be solved analytically\nwith an arbitrary chain length. Here, we consider 3-qubit reduced density matrix \u03c1ijk of the ground state, in which the subscripts denote the ith, jth and kth sites in the spin chain respectively. Due to the translation invariance property of the\nsystem, the reduced state can be rewritten as \u03c1i\u2212\u03b1,i,i+\u03b2 and the spin arrangement index m = (\u03b1, \u03b2) uniquely determine the form of the reduced density matrix no matter what the value of the index i is chosen to be. Moreover, according to the mirror symmetry, the indices (\u03b1, \u03b2) and (\u03b2, \u03b1) lead to the same form of the tripartite reduced states. Using the method\nintroduced in Ref. [56], the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) can be exactly diagonalized and the 3-qubit reduced state of the ground state |\u03c8\u3009 is expressed as [63]\n\u03c1ijk(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u03c1i\u2212\u03b1,i,i+\u03b2\n= 1\n8\n\u2211\np,q,s\n\u3008\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2 , (2)\nwhere each of the summations p, q, s runs over {x, y, z, 0}, and the expectations of Pauli operators act on the ground state |\u03c8\u3009 of the whole chain. A brief review of the diagonalization process and the detailed expressions for the three-qubit reduced state in the finite and infinite chains are presented in\nAppendix A."

Therefore, via the bipartite entanglement negativity, we can define a measure for tripartite quan-\ntum correlation\nN3(\u03c1ijk) = [N(\u03c1i|jk) \u00b7N(\u03c1j|ik) \u00b7N(\u03c1k|ij)]1/3, (3)\nwhere \u03c1ijk is a tripartite mixed state, and the bipartite negativities characterize the quantum correlations in different bipartite partitions. According to the definition, we have the MQC N3(\u03c1ijk) being zero when the tripartite mixed state is biseparable in any partition. It is noted that a similar measure\nfor multipartite pure state was utilized to characterize genuine tripartite entanglement [38, 66].\nEntanglement monogamy is one of the most important properties in many-body systems [1]. Coffman, Kundu, and\nWootters proved the first quantitative relation for the squared concurrence in three-qubit systems and showed that the residual entanglement is a genuine tripartite entanglement measure\n[25]. Ou and Fan further proved that entanglement negativity is monogamous in N -qubit pure states [27], and the case N2A|BC \u2265 N2AB + N2AC in high-dimensional tripartite systems was also verified numerically [38, 67, 68]. Moreover,\nit has been shown that, utilizing the residual entanglement of squared negativity in mixed states of many-body systems, one\n3 can detect the MQC and distinguish between the frustrated and nonfrustrated regimes in spin chains [69\u201371]. Based on\nthe monogamy of negativity, a genuine tripartite quantum correlation in a three-qubit mixed state \u03c1ijk can be defined as\nT3(\u03c1ijk) = max {( T i3 + T j 3 + T k 3 ) /3, 0 } , (4)\nwhere T i3 = N 2(\u03c1i|jk) \u2212 N2(\u03c1ij) \u2212 N2(\u03c1ik) is the residual entanglement corresponding to the central qubit i and the meanings for T j3 and T k 3 are similar. The nonzero T3 characterizes the tripartite quantum correlation which cannot be\nrestored in two-qubit subsystems."

            "text": "The entanglement of formation is a well-defined bipartite\nentanglement measure, which has the operational meaning in quantum state preparation and data storage [61]. It was proved\nthat the squared entanglement of formation is monogamous in multiqubit systems, and its residual entanglements can charac-\nterize genuine multipartite entanglement [28, 72, 73]. In particular, for a three-qubit mixed state \u03c1ijk , the residual entanglement can indicate genuine tripartite quantum correlation, which can be expressed as [28]\n\u03c4 iSEF(\u03c1ijk) = E 2 f (\u03c1i|jk)\u2212 E2f (\u03c1ij)\u2212 E2f (\u03c1ik), (5)\nwhere \u03c4 iSEF(\u03c1ijk) is the tripartite quantum correlation corresponding to the central qubit i, and Ef (\u03c1ir) is the bipartite entanglement between the qubit i and the subsystem r with r \u2208 {j, k, jk}. The entanglement of formation between qubit i and qubit pair jk is defined as Ef (\u03c1i|jk) = min \u2211\ns psEf (|\u03c8s\u3009i|jk) in which Ef (|\u03c8s\u3009i|jk) = S(\u03c1si ) = \u2212Tr\u03c1si log2\u03c1si is the von Neumann entropy and the minimum runs over all the pure state decompositions \u03c1ijk = \u2211\ns ps|\u03c8sijk\u3009\u3008\u03c8sijk| [61]. An analytical formula for two qubit entanglement of formation was given by Wootters [16] Ef (\u03c1ij) = h[(1 + (1 \u2212 C2ij)1/2)/2], in which h(x) = \u2212xlog2x \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)log2(1 \u2212 x) is the binary entropy and Cij = max[0, \u221a \u03bb1 \u2212 \u221a \u03bb2 \u2212 \u221a \u03bb3 \u2212 \u221a \u03bb4] is the concurrence with \u03bbi being the decreasing eigenvalues of matrix \u03c1ij(\u03c3y\u2297\u03c3y)\u03c1\u2217ij(\u03c3y\u2297\u03c3y). The \u03c4 iSEF(\u03c1ijk) is an effective MQC indicator which can characterize genuine tripartite quantum\ncorrelation dynamics in multipartite cavity-reservoir systems [28], and the cases for MQCs \u03c4 jSEF(\u03c1ijk) and \u03c4 k SEF(\u03c1ijk) are similar. However, although the residual entanglement of formation has strong detection ability for the MQC, its computa-\ntion for a generic mixed state is very difficult except for some specific mixed states such as rank-2 mixed states. Therefore,\nthe computable upper and lower bounds for the MQC based on the residual entanglement of formation are desirable.\nNext, we first introduce a computable upper bound for the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4 iSEF(\u03c1ijk) in a generic threequbit mixed state. Recently, Wang and Wilde determined the PPT (positive partial transposition) exact entanglement cost [74] of an arbitrary bipartite mixed state via the \u03ba entanglement [75]. For any three-qubit mixed state \u03c1ijk , the bipartite\nPPT exact entanglement cost between qubit i and qubit pair jk can be written as [75]\nEPPT(\u03c1i|jk) = E\u03ba(\u03c1i|jk)\n= log2 inf Si|jk\u22650\n{Tr[Si|jk] : \u2212STii|jk \u2264 \u03c1 Ti i|jk \u2264 S Ti i|jk}, (6)\nwhere the \u03ba entanglement E\u03ba can be computed by means of a semidefinite program (SDP) [76, 77]. Furthermore, for the bipartite entanglement cost, we have the relation\nEPPT(\u03c1i|jk) \u2265 LN(\u03c1i|jk) \u2265 E\u03b1(\u03c1i|jk) \u2265 Ef (\u03c1i|jk), (7)\nwhere the first inequality is due to the logarithmic negativity\n[64] is the lower bound of the PPT entanglement cost [74, 78], the second inequality comes from the relation between logarithmic negativity and Re\u0301nyi-\u03b1 entropy entanglement for the case 1/2 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 [79, 80], and in the last inequality we use the monotonic property of E\u03b1 along with the parameter \u03b1 and the entanglement degenerating to the Ef when \u03b1 tends to 1. According to the established relation in Eq. (7), we obtain that the PPT exact entanglement cost is the upper bound\nfor the entanglement of formation. Therefore, combining Eq. (5) and Eq. (7), we can define a computable upper bound of genuine tripartite quantum correlation\n\u03c4UBSEF(\u03c1ijk) = ( \u03c4 i(UB) SEF + \u03c4 j(UB) SEF + \u03c4 k(UB) SEF ) /3, (8)\nwhere \u03c4 i(UB) SEF = E 2 PPT(\u03c1i|jk) \u2212 E2f (\u03c1ij) \u2212 E2f (\u03c1ik) and the meanings of \u03c4 j(UB) SEF and \u03c4 k(UB) SEF with different central qubits are similar.\nOn the other hand, about the lower bound of genuine tripartite quantum correlation, the key step is the characterization\non the lower bound of bipartite entanglement of formation in a three-qubit mixed state. Chen et al proved an analytical lower\nbound for the entanglement of formation in arbitrary bipartite mixed state [81], and, for a three-qubit state \u03c1ijk , the formula can be expressed as\nELBf (\u03c1i|jk) =\n{\n0, \u039b = 1, H2[(1 + \u221a \u0393)/2], \u039b \u2208 [1, 2], (9)\nwhere \u039b = max(||\u03c1Tiijk ||1, ||R(\u03c1ijk)||1) is the maximum of trace norms between partial transposition matrix and realignment matrix, and H2(\u00b7) is the binary entropy function with \u0393 = 1 \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 1)2. With the help of the lower bound of entanglement of formation, we can obtain an effective and com-\nputable lower bound of genuine tripartite quantum correlation\n\u03c4LBSEF(\u03c1ijk) = max {( \u03c4 i(LB) SEF + \u03c4 j(LB) SEF + \u03c4 k(LB) SEF ) /3, 0 } ,\n(10)\nwhere \u03c4 i(LB) SEF = [E LB f (\u03c1i|jk)] 2\u2212E2f (\u03c1ij)\u2212E2f (\u03c1ik) characterizes the MQC corresponding to central qubit i, and tripartite quantum correlations \u03c4 j(LB) SEF and \u03c4 k(LB) SEF with different central qubits have the similar meanings.\n4"

            "heading": "III. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MQCS AND QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITION IN THE ISING CHAIN",
            "text": "We first analyze the spatial distribution of MQCs in the spin-1/2 chain as shown in Eq. (1) and consider the case of \u03b3 = 1, which corresponds to the transverse field Ising model. According to the expression of \u03c1ijk in Eq. (2), we know that an arbitrary three-spin reduced state of the ground state can be labeled by the index m = (\u03b1, \u03b2) which represents the spatial arrangement of the three spins. It was pointed out in the XY model at the thermodynamic limit (L \u2192 \u221e) that the three-spin entanglements, characterized by permutation operators, multipartite concurrence and genuine negativity, can attain to the spatial distributions m = (1, 1) and m = (2, 1) [47, 51, 53]. In regard to the four tripartite quantum correla-\ntions introduced in Sec. II, it is desirable to investigate that whether the spatial distributions of the MQCs have the longer\nranges.\nWe first calculate the reduced state \u03c1ijk of the ground state for the Ising model with the limit L \u2192 \u221e, and then evaluate the four kinds of tripartite quantum correlationsN3(\u03c1ijk), T3(\u03c1ijk), \u03c4 UB SEF(\u03c1ijk), and \u03c4 LB SEF(\u03c1ijk), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, we plot the four MQCs of three spins with the spatial distributions m = (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1) and (3, 2). In Figs. 1(a)-1(c), the tripartite quantum correlation N3(\u03c1ijk)\nSEF versus\nthe chain length. (e) The universality of the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF and the homogeneous function for different chain sizes.\n(the red-solid line) has the maximal values, but the MQC\nvanishes away when the distribution of three spins goes beyond m = (2, 2). For the distributions m = (3, 1) and m = (3, 2) in Figs. 1(d) and 1(e), the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF(\u03c1ijk) (the blue-solid line) is maximal. Moreover, in all the distributions, the MQCs T3(\u03c1ijk) (the black-solid line) and \u03c4LBSEF(\u03c1ijk) (the green-solid line) are nonzero but have the smaller values. In Fig. 1(f), we plot the maximums of the four MQCs in different spatial distributions where the tripartite quantum correlation N3 has the maximal value but the smallest correlation length, and all the MQCs disappear at the spatial distribution m = (3, 3) in this Ising system. It is clear that the spatial distributions of these MQCs have the larger correlation length than those of tripartite quantum entanglement [47, 51, 53] not exceeding m = (2, 1).\nNext, based on the computable tripartite quantum correlations, we analyze the critical phenomenon and finite-size ef-\nfects in the Ising system. In Fig. 2, we characterize these properties by the correlation \u03c4UBSEF(\u03c1ijk) in three adjacent spins with the spatial distribution m = (1, 1). The change of tripartite quantum correlation along with the parameter \u03bb is plotted for different chain lengths as shown in Fig. 2(a), where the curve for the short chain length L = 11 (the black-solid line) has a little deviation from the case L \u2192 \u221e (the purplesolid line). It is well known that the XY spin model given in Eq. (1) will undergo a quantum phase transition at the critical point \u03bbc = 1, and the previous study showed that the nearestneighbor three-spin entanglement based on genuine multipartite negativity can indicate this transition and the related\n5 finite-size effects [53]. In Fig.2 (b), the first-order derivative \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB SEF(\u03c1ijk) with different chain lengths is plotted, which indicates the QPT and diverges at the critical point \u03bbc = 1 for the thermodynamic case L \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, as shown in the figure, there is also distinct minimum of \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(L) SEF for finite system size L at the pseudo-critical point \u03bbm(L), which approaches the critical point like \u03bbm(L) \u2212 \u03bbc \u223c \u2212L\u22121.38. At the thermodynamic limit, the derivative \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(\u221e) SEF around the critical point can be written as a function of (\u03bb\u2212\u03bbc), and after fitting the expected behavior to our data we can obtain\n\u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(\u221e) SEF = 0.2819 ln |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc|+ 0.3906, (11)\nwhich is depicted in Fig. 2(c). For sufficiently large L, we also have a finite-size scaling relation\n\u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(L) SEF [\u03bbm(L)] = \u22120.2819 lnL+ 0.2720, (12)\nas shown in Fig. 2(d). Furthermore, we check the universality of the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF by plotting the finite-size scaling. In the critical regime, we take a proper scaling [82] and analyze the distance of the minimum of \u03c4UBSEF from the pseudo-critical point \u03bbm(L). A general relation can be obtained\n\u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB SEF \u2212 \u2202\u03bb\u03c4UBSEF|\u03bb=\u03bbm = R\u03c4UB\nSEF\n[L(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbm)], (13)\nwhere R\u03c4UB SEF (\u00b7) is a homogeneous function for the MQC. As shown in Fig. 2(e), we plot the homogeneous curve via the data of chain lengths including L = 41, 201, 401 and 2701. In addition, we also performed the same analysis on the correlation \u03c4UBSEF(\u03c1ijk) with the spatial distributions m = (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), and observe the similar qualitative results in the Ising system. In Appendix B, the fitted relations for the case m = (3, 1) are given. The tripartite quantum correlation N3(\u03c1ijk) has the relatively larger values than those of the other MQCs even beyond the nearest-neighbor case as show in Fig. 1(f). Here,\nwe further analyze the properties of the Ising spin chain by utilizing the correlation N3(\u03c1ijk) with the spatial distribution m = (2, 1). In Fig. 3(a), the correlation N3(\u03c1ijk) versus the parameter \u03bb is plotted in which the cases of short chains have a few deviation from that of the thermodynamic limitL\u2192 \u221e. In Fig. 3(b), the derivative \u2202\u03bbN (\u221e) 3 can indicate the QPT at the point \u03bbc = 1, and the one for finite sizes \u2202\u03bbN (L) 3 has the minimum at the pseudo-critical point \u03bbm(L). Similarly, after fitting the data, we can obtain the relations about the derivative \u2202\u03bbN (\u221e) 3 close to \u03bbc and finite-size scaling of \u2202\u03bbN (L) 3\n\u2202\u03bbN (\u221e) 3 = 0.1961 ln |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc|+ 0.3042, (14) \u2202\u03bbN (L) 3 [\u03bbm(L)] = \u22120.1961 lnL+ 0.2198, (15)\nwhere \u03bbm(L) \u2212 \u03bbc \u223c L\u22121.89 and the two equations are plotted in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), respectively. In the quantum critical regime, the scaling behavior can be represented by \u2202\u03bbN3 \u2212 \u2202\u03bbN3|\u03bb=\u03bbm = RN3 [L(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbm)], for which the homogeneous function is plotted in Fig. 3(e) via the data of spin\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The critical phenomenon and finite-size scaling properties characterized by the tripartite quantum correlation N3(\u03c1ijk) with the spatial distribution m = (2, 1), including (a) the MQC with different chain lengths, (b) the derivative \u2202\u03bbN3 versus the parameter \u03bb, (c) the fitting relation between \u2202\u03bbN (\u221e)\n3 and the pa-\nrameter \u03bb close to the critical point, (d) the finite-size logarithmical scaling of \u2202\u03bbN (L) 3 , and (e) the homogeneous function for different chain lengths.\nchain lengths L = 41, 201, 401 and 2701. About the correlation N3 with the distributions m = (1, 1) and m = (2, 2), we can obtain the similar qualitative results in the Ising model. Moreover, the tripartite correlations T3(\u03c1ijk) and \u03c4 (LB) SEF (\u03c1ijk) can also characterize the critical phenomenon and finite-size scaling properties, and the details for their behaviors with the spatial distribution m = (1, 1) are presented in Appendix B.\nIn this section, we have studied the spatial distribution of\nthe four kinds of MQCs and their critical behaviors in the Ising system. In comparison with the previous study of tri-\npartite quantum entanglement, the distribution of the MQCs can be extended to the longer rangem = (3, 2). Furthermore, the four utilized tripartite quantum correlations, even beyond the adjacent three-spin case, can effectively characterize the\ncritical phenomenon and finite-size scaling in the Ising system. In next section, we will further analyze the properties of the MQCs in the anisotropicXY model."

            "heading": "IV. THE MODULATION OF MQC DISTRIBUTION AND THE FACTORIZATION PROPERTY IN THE XY CHAIN",
            "text": "We now turn to study the MQCs in the XY model, for which the Hamiltonian as shown in Eq. (1) with the parameter \u03b3 6= 1 being the the anisotropic parameter. Factorization is one of the most important properties in the anisotropicXY model, which can be described as that the quantum correlation properties of the spin system undergo a sudden change in\nthe ordered phase and the ground state in the thermodynamic limit turns into a fully factorized state at the factorization point\n6\n[83\u201385]\n\u03bbf = 1 \u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 . (16)\nIn the last section, we have found that all the four kinds of tripartite quantum correlationsN3, \u03c4 UB SEF, T3, and \u03c4 LB SEF can capture the properties of the QPT. But a desirable MQC measure should be able to capture more properties of the many-body systems, such as the factorization property in the XY model. For the XY model with the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 = 0.2 in the thermodynamic limit, we plot the four kinds of MQCs in the three-spin reduced state \u03c1ijk of the ground state as shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), where the spatial distribution of the spins are chosen to be m = (1, 1) and m = (2, 1), respectively. In Fig. 4(a), we find that the correlations N3 (the red-solid line) and \u03c4UBSEF (the blue-solid line) can capture the sudden change of the factorization and pinpoint correctly the factorization point \u03bbf = 1/ \u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 \u2243 1.0206, but the correlations T3 (the black-solid line) and \u03c4 LB SEF (the green-solid line) cannot indicate the sudden change property of the ground state. In Fig. 4(b), the identification abilities for N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF with the distribution m = (2, 1) are similar, but the other two MQCs still do not possess this property. Moreover, af-\nter comparing the evolutions of tripartite quantum correlations N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF with those of the Ising cases shown in Fig. 2(a)\nand Fig. 3(a), we find that the correlation evolutions in the XY model is quite different. Besides the factorization property, the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 = 0.2 increasesN3 and \u03c4 UB SEF obviously in the ordered phase (\u03bb > 1) which means that the parameter \u03b3 can modulate effectively the MQCs.\nIn the Ising system studied in the last section, the maxi-\nmum of spatial distribution for the four kinds of MQCs is m = (3, 2), and the correlation N3 disappears even beyond m = (2, 2) as shown in Fig. 1(f). Next, for the XY system, it is natural to investigate the modulation effect of the parameter \u03b3 on the spatial distribution of the tripartite quantum correlations N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF. We plot the correlation N3 versus the parameter \u03bb with the spatial distributions m = (3, 3), m = (4, 4) in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(d) respectively, and the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 is chosen to be 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. It can be found that the tripartite quantum correlation N3 is nonzero for most values of \u03b3 in comparison with the zero N3 for the Ising case \u03b3 = 1, which illustrates that the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 can modulate the MQC to a longer range of spatial distribution. Moreover, compared the N3 in Fig. 4(a)-(d), we find that the MQC in the ordered phase (\u03bb > 1) is sensitive to the spatial distribution and decreases along with the increasing of m = (\u03b1, \u03b2), but the N3 in the nonordered phase (\u03bb < 1) is robust to the spatial distribution for a properly chosen value of \u03b3 = 0.2 (see the purple-solid lines in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(d)). We further plot the \u03c4UBSEF versus the parameter \u03bb for the spatial distributions m = (3, 3),\n7 m = (4, 4) in Fig. 4(e) and Fig. 4(f), which also illustrate that the anisotropic parameter (\u03b3 = 0.2) can effectively modulate the range of the MQC distribution.\nIn order to elaborate on the modulation of spatial distribu-\ntion of quantum correlations, we further analyze the correlation N3(\u03b1, \u03b2) of reduced state \u03c1ijk in the nonordered and ordered phases, and compare the distribution of N3(\u03b1, \u03b2) with that of concurrence C(\u03b1) in two-qubit state \u03c1ij with \u03b1 being the distance between spins i and j. In Fig. 5, we plot the spatial distributions of maxima of N3 and C along with the distance parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the two phases. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the maxima of N3(\u03b1, \u03b2) versus the distribution indexes (\u03b1, \u03b2) in the nonordered phase (\u03bb < 1) is plotted, where the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 is chosen to be 1.0, 0.6, and 0.2 in the three panels respectively. For the case of \u03b3 = 1, the maximal distribution of N3 is m = (2, 2) which coincides with the result for the Ising case given in Fig. 1(f). It should be noted that all the distributions are symmetric under swapping \u03b1 and \u03b2 since the quantum state \u03c1ijk(\u03b1, \u03b2) has the property. Along with the decreasing of the parameter \u03b3, we find that the maximal distribution can attain to the longer ranges, where the N3 in the second panel (\u03b3 = 0.6) reaches to the distribution m = (3, 3) and the situation for \u03b3 = 0.2 attains to m = (7, 7) and (8, 2) (we multiply the N3 by a factor 2 so as to show the trend of change more clearly in the third panel). In Fig. 5(b), we plot the distribution of maxima of concurrence Cmax(\u03b1) along with the distance parameter \u03b1 in the nonordered phase. For the Ising case (\u03b3 = 1), the nonzero concurrence attains to the distribution Cmax(2), and beyond the distance \u03b1 = 2 the two-spin correlation disappears. Along with the decreasing of the parameter \u03b3, the spatial distribution of Cmax can reach to a longer range as shown in the second and the third panels, but the longest range \u03b1 = 6 for \u03b3 = 0.2 is still less than any one of the distance labels (\u03b1, \u03b2) for the nonzeroN3(7, 7) with \u03b3 = 0.2, which means that the tripartite quantum correlation has the longer distribution range than that of two-qubit quantum correlation. In Figs. 5(c) and 5(d), we plot the distributions of N3 and Cmax in the ordered phase (\u03bb > 1), where the parameter \u03b3 still can effectively modulate the distribution ranges of the two kinds of quantum correlations (we multiply the N3 by a factor 1.5 in the second panel of Fig. 5(c)). Moreover, in the ordered phase, the maxima of N3(\u03b1, \u03b2) are always greater than those of Cmax(\u03b1) when the \u03b1 is chosen to be the same value, for example, N3(12, 1) \u223c 10\u22123 but Cmax(12) \u223c 10\u22125 as shown in the third panels of Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). In addition, after comparing the distributions quantum correlations (N3 andCmax) in the two phases with \u03b3 6= 1, we find that the spatial distributions in the ordered phase have\nthe longer ranges than those in the nonordered case.\nOur previous studies on the MQC distributions in the XY model have been made in the case of thermodynamic limit. It is natural to ask whether or not the corresponding properties\nstill hold for the case of finite chain length.

(a) Left panel: N3 versus the parameter \u03bb for \u03b3 = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 with the spatial distribution m = (1, 1); Right panel: the comparison of the sudden change positions of N3 (for \u03b3 = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9) and the analytical result \u03bbf = 1/ \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b32 (the black-dotted line) with the distributions m = (1, 1), (2, 1) and (2, 2). (b) The similar plots for the correlation \u03c4UBSEF with the left panel being the correlation evolution along with \u03bb and the right panel being the coincident transition positions with the analytical results.\nwhere \u03c1 (L) ijk is the reduced state for the finite chain length L, and \u03c1 (\u221e) ijk is the one for L\u2192 \u221e. In Appendix C, we calculate the fidelities of the reduced states with L = 21 for the spatial distributions m = (1, 1), (3, 3), (6, 3) and (6, 6) respectively, where the fidelities are larger than 0.99 for most regions. Similar calculations are made for other distributions, and we can obtain the same qualitative results. The very high fidelities\nimply that the distribution properties obtained in the case of thermodynamic limit can still hold for the case of finite chain length (L \u2265 21). The details for the analysis are presented in the Appendix.\nFactorization is an important property of the XY model, and we have shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) that the tripartite quantum correlations N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF are superior to the other two MQCs (T3 and \u03c4 LB SEF) because they can capture this interesting property. Here, we further analyze the factorization property in a more generic situation. For the case of three adjacent spins m = (1, 1) at the thermodynamic limit, the correlation N3 versus the parameter \u03bb is plotted for different values of \u03b3 in the left panel of Fig. 6(a), where the sudden change of the ground state can be indicated clearly by the zero N3. In order to check the accuracy of the identification, we further plot these positions (the red stars for m = (1, 1)) of sudden change and compare them with the analytical result \u03bbf = 1/ \u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 (the black-dotted line) in the right panel of this figure, which illustrates the nice identification on the factorization property. We also plot the sudden change positions for the spatial distributions m = (2, 1) (the green triangles) and m = (2, 2) (the blue circles) in this panel, which still\n8\nexhibit a good coincidence. Similarly, the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF(1, 1) versus the parameter \u03bb is plotted in the left panel of Fig. 6(b), which can indicate the sudden changes of the ground state for different values of \u03b3 too. Similarly, the accuracy of the identification on the factorization is illustrated by the right panel and the transition positions of \u03c4UBSEF for the distributions m = (1, 1), (2, 1) and (2, 2) are coincided with the analytical results.\nIt was pointed out that the position of the factorization point\n\u03bbf = 1/ \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b32 is independent of the chain length in the XY model [87], although the ground state at this point in the finite chain case may not be fully separable. At the factor-\nization point with finite chain length, the ground state of the XY system has a two-fold degeneracy, and the two eigenstates with even and odd parities can be written as [47, 83]\n|\u03a6even\u3009 = (|\u03c6+\u3009+ |\u03c6\u2212\u3009)/N+, |\u03a6odd\u3009 = (|\u03c6+\u3009 \u2212 |\u03c6\u2212\u3009)/N\u2212,\n(18)\nwhere N\u00b1 = \u221a 2(1\u00b1 cosL\u03b8i) are the normalization coefficients and the two factorized components in each eigenstate have the form |\u03c6\u00b1\u3009 = \u2297Li=1exp( i2\u03b8\u00b1\u03c3 y i )|0\u3009 with \u03b8\u00b1 = \u00b1arccos( \u221a\n(1\u2212 \u03b3)(1 + \u03b3)). Because the two factorized states |\u03c6+\u3009 and |\u03c6\u2212\u3009 are nonorthogonal except for \u03b3 = 1, the even and odd ground states given in Eq. (18) are not or-\nthogonal in general, which results in the ground state with \u03b3 6= 1 being entangled at the factorization point. In Ref. [47], the authors studied the tripartite entanglement property at the factorization point in the case of finite chain length and\nfound that the tripartite entanglement in the adjacent three spins obeys the finite-size scaling. In Fig. 7, we further in-\nvestigate this factorization property of the tripartite quantum correlations N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF, which are plotted as the logarith-\nmic functions of the chain length L for the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 (the solid lines with different colors in each panel) with the spatial distributions m = (1, 1) and m = (2, 1) and compared with the behaviors of the corresponding concurrence C1(\u03b3) for the nearest neighbor two spins (the dotted lines with different colors in very panel). As\nshown in Fig. 7(a), we find the tripartite quantum correlation N3 is nonzero at the factorization points and decreases exponentially with the increasing of chain length L, which obeys the similar finite-size scaling to that of the concurrence C1 (the solid and dotted lines with the same color having the same value of \u03b3). Moreover, N3 is always greater than C1 for the given values of L and \u03b3, and the value of N3 decreases along with the increasing of \u03b3 (for example, N3(\u03b3 = 0.2) \u223c 10\u22122 but N3(\u03b3 = 0.6) \u223c 10\u22126 when L = 21). The similar property for N3 with the spatial distribution m = (2, 1) is illustrated by Fig. 7(b), where we find the spatial distribution of three spins has little influence on the factorization property in comparison with the adjacent case m = (1, 1) in Fig. 7(a). In Figs. 7(c) and 7(d), we further plot the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF with the distributions m = (1, 1) and m = (2, 1) in a similar way, where we find that the \u03c4UBSEF still obeys the finite-size scaling and the spin distributions have\nlittle influence on the scalings but their decreasing exponents are different from that of two-qubit C1(or N3). For the given values of L and \u03b3, \u03c4UBSEF is always less thanN3, and the different scaling exponents may come from the different measure methods for tripartite quantum correlation: N3 quantifies the MQC by the way that the system is correlated in any bipartite partition, but \u03c4UBSEF quantifies the MQC by the way that the correlation is multipartite which cannot be restored in any\ntwo-spin subsystems. It is noted that our analysis does not include the cases of \u03b3 = 0 or \u03b3 = 1 since the reduced states \u03c1ijk for the two cases are fully separable and then have zero tripartite quantum correlations [47, 56].\nAt the end of this section, we further analyze the difference between the two kinds of tripartite quantum correlations N3 and \u03c4UBSEF in the XY model. For the given spatial distribution m = (\u03b1, \u03b2) and the values of parameters \u03bb and \u03b3, the maximum ofN3 is greater than that of \u03c4 UB SEF, which can be observed by the corresponding values in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6. In addition, for the case of finite chain length with the same parameters in Fig. 7, the correlation N3 at the factorization point still has the larger value in comparison with that of \u03c4UBSEF. The larger value of N3 makes its spatial distribution be well modulated via the parameter \u03b3 as shown in Fig. 5. However, the detection ability of \u03c4UBSEF for tripartite quantum correlation may be superior to that of N3. In Ref. [63], the authors studied the bound entanglement [88, 89] (the entangled state but with the positive partial transposition) of three spins in the XY model at the thermodynamic limit, since the bound entangled state is a kind of useful physical resource for quantum secure communication [90]. They found that, for the spatial distribution m = (4, 4) with the parameter \u03b3 = 0.5, there is the bound entanglement in the reduced three-spin state \u03c1i|jk under the partition i|jk when the parameter\u03bb is chosen in certain ranges. In Fig. 8, we plot the bipartite entanglement negativityN(\u03c1i|jk) and tripartite quantum correlations N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF as the func-\n9\ntions of the parameter \u03bb for the given distribution and value of \u03b3. We find that, when the parameter 0.959 < \u03bb < 1.074, both the bipartite negativity (the black-dotted line) and the tripartite quantum correlation N3 (the red-solid line) are zero as shown in the figure, but the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF (the blue-solid lines) has the nonzero value which indicates the existence of bound entanglement. According to the definition of N3 in Eq. (3), this tripartite quantum correlation cannot identify the bound entanglement due to its construction coming from the product of bipartite negativities. Moreover,\nin the inset of Fig. 8, we further highlight the bound entanglement indicated by nonzero \u03c4UBSEF in the parameter region \u03bb \u2208 (1.205, 1.226)."

            "text": "Based on multipartite correlation postulates and entanglement monogamy [27, 28, 65], the four utilized tripartite quantum correlations N3, T3, \u03c4 UB SEF and \u03c4 LB SEF we introduced in Sec. II are computable for an arbitrary three-qubit mixed\nstate, which can be served as the basic tools for characterizing the properties of quantum many-body systems. In comparison with the tripartite quantum entanglement I2 [47] and genuine multipartite negativity [53], the tripartite quantum cor-\nrelations have much larger spatial distributions, which makes our defined MQCs are more suitable to distinguish the quantum properties in the XY system especially when the tripartite quantum entanglements and two-site concurrence are un-\ndetectable. In experiments, the observations on the distribution property of tripartite quantum correlations and the quan-\ntum critical phenomenon are possible in many-body systems. On the one hand, the observers only need process the data of\nseveral particles rather than complete information about the ground state; on the other hand, the experimental preparation\nabout the quantum many-body system for dozens of qubits has been realized in superconducting platforms [91\u201393].\nHofmann et al studied the four-partite entanglement in the XY chain by using the genuine multipartite negativity, and found that the entanglement disappears when the distance between any two spins in the four-qubit subsystems is larger than 2 [53]. Moreover, by means of the four-concurrence [94], Osterloh et al analyzed the four-particle entanglement in theXY chain, where the entanglement changes to zero when any two pairs of spins are next-nearest neighbor [95]. It is meaningful\nto further investigate whether the four-partite quantum correlations have the larger spatial distributions. Based on the\nmonogamy property of squared concurrence [26], a multipartite quantum correlation measure is presented in four-qubit\nsystems [96], which can characterize the multipartite entanglement in cluster-class states [97]. Particularly, the MQCs\nutilized in this paper can be easily extended to the four-qubit case and are computable for an arbitrary four-qubit mixed state. Besides the XY model studied in this work, it is worthwhile to investigate the MQC modulation and critical property\nin other kinds of many-body systems such as Heisenberg spin chains with the alternating-field or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction [98, 99], multipartite quantum systems with topo-\nlogical quantum phases [100], multi-spin systems with longrange interactions [101\u2013103], and so on.\nIn conclusion, we have studied the MQC properties and critical phenomena in a one-dimensional spin-1/2XY model, where the four tripartite quantum correlations we introduced\nare computable and can characterize effectively the MQC in the three-spin reduced state of the ground state. In the Ising case with \u03b3 = 1, the spatial distribution of MQCs attains to the rangem = (3, 2), which is larger than the maximal distribution of tripartite quantum entanglementm = (2, 1). All the correlations N3, T3, \u03c4 UB SEF and \u03c4 LB SEF can be used to detect the quantum phase transition and obey the finite-size scaling, even beyond the situation of nearest-neighbor three spins. Furthermore, we have shown that the two selected MQCs N3 and \u03c4UBSEF can capture exactly the sudden change behavior of the factorization property in the XY system for both the thermodynamic and finite-size cases. In particular, it is revealed that the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 can modulate effectively the spatial distribution of N3 to a much longer range, which is very useful for the information propagation in multipartite systems. The similar modulation property still holds for the finite chain length according to the super high fidelity between the three-\nspin reduced states in the finite and infinite chains. In addition, the correlation \u03c4UBSEF has more strong detection ability and can distinguish the bound entanglement in the XY system when the tripartite quantum correlationN3 loses its efficacy."

            "text": "In Sec. IIA, we introduced the Hamiltonian of the XY model and gave the expression of three-qubit reduced density matrix \u03c1ijk of the ground state. Utilizing the translation invariance of the system, the reduced state of three spins with the spatial distribution m = (\u03b1, \u03b2) can be written as [63]\n\u03c1i\u2212\u03b1,i,i+\u03b2 = 1\n8\n\u2211\np,q,s\n\u3008\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2 , (A1)\nwhere the label i is an arbitrary spin position in theXY chain, and the operators in the expectation value \u3008\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 acts on the ground state with the summation indexes p, q, s run over the set {x, y, z, 0}. According to this expression, the three-spin reduced density matrix can be obtained by calculating a set of correlations \u3008\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009. Combining the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, one can get some zero corre-\nlations, which results in half of the matrix elements of the three-qubit state being zero [63]. After some derivations, we\ncan obtain the reduced state in the computational basis\n\u03c1i\u2212\u03b1,i,i+\u03b2 =\n1\n8\n\n          a11 0 0 a14 0 a16 a17 0 0 a22 a23 0 a25 0 0 a28 0 a32 a33 0 a35 0 0 a38 a41 0 0 a44 0 a46 a47 0 0 a52 a53 0 a55 0 0 a58 a61 0 0 a64 0 a66 a67 0 a71 0 0 a74 0 a76 a77 0 0 a82 a83 0 a85 0 0 a88\n\n          . (A2)\nThe concrete form of the three-spin reduced density matrix will be available if we can calculate all the 32 nonzero matrix elements, which is closely interrelated with the set of correlation functions {\u3008\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009}. Using the method given in Refs. [56, 57, 59], these three-spin correlations can be fur-\nther decomposed into a series of determinants with elements only being two-spin correlation functions. The aim of this\nAppendix is to give a brief description for the derivation and provide the detailed information needed to compute the three-\nspin reduced state in Eq. (A2).\nHere, we first give a brief review on the derivation of\ncharacterizing three-spin correlation by the two-spin ones [56, 57, 59]. After Jordan-Wigner transformation, the Pauli\noperators in the Hamiltonian shown in Eq. (1) of the main text can be mapped into spinless fermion operators c\u2020j and cj , and we have the following relations\n\u03c3xl = Al\nl\u22121 \u220f\ni=1\nAiBi,\n\u03c3yl = \u2212iBl l\u22121 \u220f\ni=1\nAiBi,\n\u03c3zl = \u2212AlBl,\n(A3)\nwhere the symbols denote Al = cl + c \u2020 l and Bl = c \u2020 l \u2212 cl with the index l being the position of spin. By using the Wick theorem, the three-site correlations can be decomposed into a series of products of three kinds of correlation functions \u3008AlBk\u3009|\u03c8\u3009, \u3008AlAk\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 and \u3008BlBk\u3009|\u03c8\u3009. After the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, we can obtain [56]\n\u3008AlAk\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 = \u03b4lk \u3008BlBk\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 = \u2212\u03b4lk \u3008AlBk\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 = Gr,\n(A4)\nwhere \u03b4lk is the delta function, and Gr is a newly defined function with the subscript r = k\u2212 l according to the property of translation symmetry. In the case of the thermodynamic\nlimit, the new function has the form\nGr = 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\nd\u03c6[cos(\u03c6r)(1 + \u03bb cos\u03c6)\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03bb sin\u03c6 sin(\u03c6r)] 1 \u039b\u03c6 ,\n(A5)\nwhere the parameters are \u039b\u03c6 = \u221a\n\u03b12 + \u03b22, \u03b1 = (\u03bb cos\u03c6+1), \u03b2 = \u03bb\u03b3 sin\u03c6, respectively. In the case of finite chain with the length L, we have\nGr = 1\nL\n\u2211\nq\n1\n\u039bq [cos(\u03c6qr)(1 + \u03bb cos\u03c6q)\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03bb sin\u03c6q sin(\u03c6qr)], (A6)\nwhere the parameter can be written as \u039bq = \u221a \u03b12q + \u03b2 2 q , \u03b1q =\n(\u03bb cos\u03c6q+1), \u03b2q = \u03bb\u03b3 sin\u03c6q , and \u03c6q = 2\u03c0q/L, respectively. Therefore, the nonzero matrix elements in Eq. (A2) can be\ncalculated by the above method.\nAs an example, we give the detailed calculation procedure for the first matrix element a11. According to the expression in Eq. (A1), the element a11 in Eq. (A2) can be written as the sum of certain nonzero correlation functions\na11 = \u3008III\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 + \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1II\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 + \u3008I\u03c3zi I\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 +\u3008II\u03c3zi+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 + \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3zi I\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 + \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1I\u03c3zi+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 +\u3008I\u03c3zi \u03c3zi+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009 + \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3zi \u03c3zi+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009, (A7)\nwhere the labels i, \u03b1, \u03b2 in the subscript represent the spatial distribution of three spins, and I is the identity operator of single qubit system. For convenience, we further simplify the expression of Eq. (A7) by using some abbreviations for the\nsingle-, two- and three-spin correlations, for instance,\nZ\u2212\u03b1 = \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1II\u3009|\u03c8\u3009, Z\u2212\u03b1Z\u03b2 = \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1I\u03c3zi+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009, Z\u2212\u03b1Z0Z\u03b2 = \u3008\u03c3zi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3zi \u03c3zi+\u03b2\u3009|\u03c8\u3009,\n(A8)\nwhere the subscripts \u2212\u03b1, 0, and \u03b2 in the abbreviation means the relative distance to the spin i, and the letter Z means the correlation is related to the Pauli operator of z direction. In Eq. (A7), it is clear that the element a11 does not contains any\n11\ncorrelation function related to Pauli operators \u03c3x or \u03c3y . The reason is that both \u03c3x and \u03c3y are the anti-diagonal matrices, thus all the first elements of the three-spin correlation operator {\u03c3pi\u2212\u03b1\u03c3 q i \u03c3 s i+\u03b2} are zero when it contains \u03c3x or \u03c3y . According to the above method via Jordan-Wigner transformation and Wick theorem, we can calculate the matrix element a11, and, after some derivation, we have\na11 =1\u2212 3G0 + 3G20 \u2212G\u03b1G\u2212\u03b1 \u2212G\u03b1+\u03b2G\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 \u2212G\u03b2G\u2212\u03b2 + Z\u2212\u03b1Z0Z\u03b2 ,\n(A9)\nwhere the Gr is the two-site correlation defined in Eq. (A4) with the subscript being the relative distance (for the case of infinite chain length, we use the expression in Eq. (A5), and\nwe use the formula in Eq. (A6) when the chain has a finite chain length), and the three-spin correlation function can be\ndecomposed into the determinant of a set of two-site correlations\nZ\u2212\u03b1Z0Z\u03b2 = \u2212\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 G0 G\u03b1 G\u03b1+\u03b2 G\u2212\u03b1 G0 G\u03b2 G\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 G\u2212\u03b2 G0 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 .

            "text": "In Sec. III, utilizing the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4UBSEF with the spatial distributionm = (1, 1), we analyzed the critical phenomenon and finite-size effects in the Ising model. The MQC with the distributions m = (2, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 1) can also be served as a good indicator to detect the QPT and characterize the finite-size effects. After some derivation, we can obtain the similar qualitative results and plots like Fig. 2 in the main text. Here, for the distribution m = (3, 1), we give the fitted relations for \u03c4 UB(\u221e) SEF and \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(L) SEF , which can be expressed as\n\u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(\u221e) SEF = 0.0989 ln |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc|+ 0.1240, (B1) \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB(L) SEF [\u03bbm(L)] = \u22120.0989 lnL+ 0.0814, (B2)\nwhere the position of the minimum of \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 UB SEF scales as \u03bbm(L)\u2212 \u03bbc \u223c L\u22121.20. The tripartite quantum correlationT3, we introduced in Sec. II of the main text, is also an effective indicator to characterize the critical phenomenon and finite-size effects in the spin\nmodel as shown in Fig. 9 where the spatial distribution of the MQC is chosen to be m = (1, 1). In Fig. 9(a), the three-spin correlation T3(\u03c1ijk) as a function of \u03bb is plotted with different chain lengths, and Fig. 9(b) shows the first-order derivative \u2202\u03bbT3(\u03c1ijk) versus the parameter \u03bb. Similar to the situation of N3 and \u03c4 UB SEF shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of main text, we find that the curves for short chain lengths have a little deviation from the infinite chain case, and the \u2202\u03bbT3(\u03c1ijk) diverges\nSEF and\nthe parameter \u03bb close to the critical point, (d) the finite-size logarithmical scaling of \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 LB(L) SEF , and (e) the homogeneous function for different chain lengths.\nfor infinite chain and have distinct minima for the finite chain lengths. Moreover, for the cases of infinite and finite chain length, the fitted functions of T3(\u03c1ijk) have the forms\n\u2202\u03bbT (\u221e) 3 = 0.0776 ln |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc|+ 0.1304, (B3) \u2202\u03bbT (L) 3 [\u03bbm(L)] = \u22120.0776 lnL+ 0.0968, (B4)\nwhere \u03bbm(L) \u2212 \u03bbc \u223c \u2212L\u22121.28 and the two fitted results are plotted in Fig. 9(c) and Fig. 9(d), respectively. Additionally,\nwe can also give a general relation to exhibit the behavior of the tripartite quantum correlation T3 in the quantum critical regime for finite system size,\n\u2202\u03bbT3 \u2212 \u2202\u03bbT3|\u03bb=\u03bbm = QT3 [L(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbm)], (B5)\nwhere QT3 is a homogeneous function and plotted in Fig. 9(e) in which we utilize the data for chain sizes L = 41, 201, 401 and 2701, respectively.\nThe tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4LBSEF with the distribution m = (1, 1) has the similar behaviors as shown in Fig. 10 and can characterize the critical phenomenon and finitesize effects. We plot the correlation versus the parameter \u03bb with different chain length L in Fig. 10(a), and the derivation \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 LB SEF can indicate the QPT as shown in Fig. 10(b). Similarly, \u03c4 LB(\u221e) SEF and \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 LB(L) SEF can be fitted with the relations\n\u2202\u03bb\u03c4 LB(\u221e) SEF = 0.0461 ln |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbc|+ 0.0685, (B6) \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 LB(L) SEF [\u03bbm(L)] = \u22120.0461 lnL+ 0.0481, (B7)\nwhich are plotted in Fig. 10(c) and (d). For the finite chain length, the minimum of \u2202\u03bb\u03c4 LB SEF scales as \u03bbm(L) \u2212 \u03bbc \u223c\n13\nL\u22121.32. Furthermore, the behavior of the tripartite quantum correlation \u03c4LBSEF in the quantum critical regime for finite system size can be exhibited by a homogeneous function as\nshown in Fig. 10(e), where we utilize the data for chain sizes\nL = 41, 201, 401 and 2701, respectively."

            "heading": "Appendix C: The fidelity of the three-spin reduced states between the finite and infinite XY chains",
            "text": "In this Appendix, we will give the detail information of the\ncalculated fidelities for the three-qubit reduced state between the finite chain length L = 21 and infinite one with the spatial distributions of three spins beingm = (1, 1), (3, 3), (6, 3) and (6, 6), respectively. According to the formula in Eq. (17) of the main text, we can calculate the fidelities with different\ndistribution, which are plotted as the functions of parameters \u03bb and \u03b3 in Fig. 11. As shown in the figure, it is obvious that the fidelities for most regions of \u03bb and \u03b3 are larger than 0.99, regardless of the spatial arrangement of three spins (we also\ncalculated the fidelities for other spatial distributions and obtain the similar results). That is to say, the difference between\nthe three-qubit reduced density matrices in the finite and infinite chain cases is very small. The quite high fidelities imply that the distribution properties of N3 obtained in the thermodynamic limit (L \u2192 \u221e) still hold in the case of finite chain length. In particular, the anisotropic parameter \u03b3 can modulate effectively the spatial distribution of N3 to a longer range as shown in Fig. 5 of main text.\n[1] R. Horodecki, P. Horodecki, M.
