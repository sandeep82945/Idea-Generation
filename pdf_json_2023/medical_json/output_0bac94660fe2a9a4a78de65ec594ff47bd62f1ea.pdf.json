See DOI:\n05\nand greater diffusion rates, microwaves can minimise processing temperature while creating small particle size, controllable morphology, purity, and homogeneous microstructure.12,13\nThus, microwave-assisted synthesis is one of the prospective tools to ameliorate the quality of life in the eld of nanoscience and technology, resulting in a substantial advancement in the large-scale synthesis of numerous functional metal oxide nanomaterials with novel structures and properties.14,15 Also, because microwave radiation is so important and involved in making metal oxide nanomaterials, it can be used to make doped semiconductor nanomaterials that are active in visible light.\nTiO2 is one of the best semiconductors due to its chemical and biological inertness, high performance under UV light irradiation and long-term photostability.16 Based on the above the application of microwaves has advanced as a simple, quick, and mild synthetic route for creating a wide range of nanomaterials with precise control over their morphology and size3 merits of TiO2, Ding et al. produced TiO2 nanocrystals having anatase phase with identical shape and size.17 Cui et al. created TiO2 nanotubes using a hydrothermal process assisted by microwaves.18 Simonsen et al. used the microwave-assisted sol\u2013 gel technique to make TiO2 lms, which they then used to study\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, TiO2's high photogenerated charge carrier recombination rate and large band gap (3.2 eV) limit it from being employed as a visible-light photocatalyst.20 To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and improve TiO2's quantum efficiency in the visible range, the electron\u2013hole (e\u2212/h+) recombination and band gap must be lowered by doping TiO2 with non-metal or metal ions. To ameliorate the drawbacks of TiO2, researchers reported the synthesis of metal doped and non-metal doped TiO2 with the assistance of microwave radiation.\nIn the framework of the present study, microwave assisted sol gel technique was used to fabricate zirconium-doped TiO2. As zirconium is biologically inert, nontoxic and possesses the same valence shell state, valence shell structure and comparable ionic radii as titanium (Zr-0.72 \u00c5, Ti-0.68 \u00c5), which can facilitate the substitutional doping of Ti4+ with Zr4+, which results in reducing the band gap and high efficiency in the segregation of photogenerated charge carriers.21,22 Their porosity results in a enhanced absorption, high surface area, and rapid transfer of contaminants.23 Numerous reports describe the fabrication of Zr-doped TiO2 with enhanced photocatalytic activity by using high calcination temperatures.24,25 Therefore, it is necessary to design a method for generating nanoparticles at low temperatures. For the Zr-doped TiO2 synthesis, we opted a microwave-irradiation method, which has various advantages over traditional heating, such as high thermal homogeneity, quick and selective heating, which will assist in lowering calcination temperatures.26 Various methodologies are employed to characterise the synthesised catalysts.\nThe degradation of BBR dye was used to evaluate the photocatalytic efficacy of the synthesised nanocatalysts. BBR dye is a negative dye that is persistent in the environment and causes carcinogenicity. It is primarily employed in the leather and textile industries as a colouring agent.26,27 The ecosystem is in grave danger as a result of the discharge of these dyes as washouts into the aquatic environment."

Sol\u2013gel synthesis was employed in the rst step to synthesize Zr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with varying dopant weight percentages (ZT1 (0.00882 g), ZT2 (0.01765 g), ZT3 (0.02646 g), ZT4 (0.0353 g) and ZT5 (0.0441 g)). In rst beaker, ethanol (40 mL) was mixed with n-butyl ortho titanate (20 mL) and stirred for 10 minutes (Solution I). The mixture was then acidied with nitric acid (3.2 mL) by stirring continuously. Later in second beaker, Solution II was prepared by taking the necessary amount of zirconium, 40 mL of ethanol, and H2O (7.2 mL) are taken and stirred for 30 minutes. Then, to the Solution I, Solution II is added gently while stirring rapidly. Aer repeating the procedure, the mixture is stirred continuously for an additional two hours until the formation of clear sol. The resultant sol is le in the dark for 48 hours at ambient temperature to form a gel. Aer drying the gel in an oven at 80 \u00b0C, the catalyst was ground with a pestle and mortar and calcined for ve hours at 450 \u00b0C in a muffle furnace. The catalyst was calcinated and crushed into a powder form. The photocatalysts were identied with the designations ZT1, ZT2, ZT3, ZT4, and ZT5.\n2.2.2 Step 2: synthesis using sol\u2013gel technique assisted by microwaves. Based on the analytical results of UV-vis DRS, XRD, and the photocatalytic ability of the catalysts, ZT4 was determined to be the best catalyst due to its reduced band gap, low crystallite size, and superior photocatalytic capability. Therefore, ZT4 was selected, and the same technique was followed until formation of sol, aer which the mixture was divided into ve equal portions. Then the sol has to set for 48 hours at room temperature in the dark to form gel. Each sample is then microwave-irradiated at varying wattages (180 W, 360 W, 540 W, 720W, 900W). Themicrowave power levels and irradiation time were represented in Table 1. Here the role of microwave irradiation is employed not only for drying, but it also reduces reaction time and has various other benets such as less nucleation, which leads to smaller particle size, high reproducibility, and uniform morphology. The prepared catalysts were ground and calcined in muffle furnace at 350 \u00b0C for ve hours, and then ground again. The labels for the prepared samples were ZT4M1, ZT4M2, ZT4M3, ZT4M4, and ZT4M5. The same procedure was employed to develop undoped (UTO) TiO2. The names allocated to the catalysts were reported in Table 2."

Among all, ZT4 had the best efficiency of any doped sample due to the greatest reduction in bandgap, which enables higher quanta absorption per particle in visible light radiation, hence enhancing photocatalytic activity.\nIn addition to light absorption, the effectiveness of the catalyst is dependent on the surface area of the particle, which facilitates dye adsorption on the catalyst's surface.

            "text": "In this study, the synthesis of Zr-doped TiO2 using the microwave assisted sol gel technique is thoroughly described. The complete strategic method was devised to evaluate thoroughly the BBR dye degradation capability of as-produced Zr-doped TiO2 driven by visible light. ZT4M4 was found to be the most efficient of the as-synthesized catalysts, which can be attributed to its rough spherical morphology and lattice planes that coincide with the XRD, conrming the pure anatase form of the catalyst. ZT4M4 demonstrated the best performance in terms of reduced crystallite size (4.7 nm), band gap (2.66 eV), and surface area (119 m2 g\u22121). The TEM clearly displays the comparable particle size distribution of ZT4M4 without any agglomeration. The photodegradability of BBR dye, which reached 99% aer 50 min of exposure to visible light, demonstrates the characterization results. The scavenger test demonstrates the presence\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nPaper RSC Advances\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
