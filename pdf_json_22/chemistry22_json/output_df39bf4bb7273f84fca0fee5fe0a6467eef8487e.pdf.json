Phys. 153, 034701 (2020)], we successfully calculated the solid\u2013liquid (SL) and solid\u2013vapor (SV) interfacial tensions of a simple Lennard-Jones fluid around solid cylinders with nanometer-scale diameters from single equilibrium molecular dynamics systems in which a solid cylinder was vertically immersed into a liquid pool. The SL and SV interfacial tensions \u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 and \u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0 relative to that for bare solid surface \u03b3S0, respectively, were obtained by simple force balance relations on fluid-containing control volumes set around the bottom and top ends of the solid cylinder, which are subject to the fluid stress and the force from the solid. The theoretical contact angle calculated by Young\u2019s equation using these interfacial tensions agreed well with the apparent contact angle estimated by the analytical solution to fit the meniscus shape, showing that Young\u2019s equation holds even for the menisci around solids with nanoscale curvature. We have also found that the curvature effect on the contact angle was surprisingly small while it was indeed large on the local forces exerted on the solid cylinder near the contact line. In addition, the present results showed that the curvature dependence of the SL and SV interfacial free energies, which are the interfacial tensions, is different from that of the corresponding interfacial potential energies. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nAs we see cap-shaped liquid droplets on solid surfaces almost everyday, wetting behavior is one of the most common physical phenomena in human life and is also a research target in various scientific and engineering fields.1\u20135 By defining the interfacial tensions and the contact angle \u03b8, wetting is usually described by Young\u2019s equation6\n\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3SV + \u03b3LV cos\u03b8 = 0, (1)\nwhere \u03b3SL, \u03b3SV, and \u03b3LV are solid\u2013liquid (SL), solid\u2013vapor (SV), and liquid\u2013vapor (LV) interfacial tensions, respectively. Young\u2019s original idea of Eq. (1) in 1805 was the wall-tangential force balance of interfacial tensions exerted on the contact line (CL)\u2014before the establishment of thermodynamics;7 however, now, it is often explained from a thermodynamic point of view rather than from the\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 054701 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0079816 156, 054701-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nmechanical balance.1 Practically, the contact angle is used as a common measure of wettability. Various models have been proposed to capture the details of the CL, such as including the precursor film1,8 or the microscopic contact angle9 or considering the effects of line tension due to the contact-line curvature in Eq. (1).10,11 However, it is difficult to experimentally validate these models mainly because measuring the interfacial tensions \u03b3SL and \u03b3SV, which include the solid surface, is also difficult.12,13\nWetting plays a key role in the nanoscale and from a microscopic theoretical point of view, Kirkwood and Buff14 were the first to put forward the framework of surface tension based on the statistical mechanics. Recent development of molecular simulation methods including molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) advanced the microscopic understanding of the interfaces, and the calculation of the surface tension based on Bakker\u2019s equation,2,3,15\nwhich describes the relation between the stress integral through the liquid\u2013vapor or liquid\u2013gas interface and the surface tension, is used as a standard approach.16 In addition, MD or MC studies about microscopic wetting have been conducted, ranging from simply evaluating the apparent contact angle, e.g., from the average droplet shape, to quantitatively extract the SL and SV interfacial tensions through a mechanical manner and/or a thermodynamic manner.17\u201349 For the mechanical approach, called the mechanical route, Bakker\u2019s equation was extended to describe the connection between the stress integral through the SL or SV interface and the corresponding interfacial tension (see Appendix A).23\u201329,49 On the other hand, for the latter approach, called the thermodynamic route, the SL and SV interfacial tensions were interpreted as the interfacial free energy per interfacial area. For instance, by the thermodynamic integration (TI) method, the SL interfacial energy was evaluated as the free energy difference from a reference system in which the SL interface was substituted by bare solid and liquid surfaces quasi-statically under constant number of particles N, temperature T, and pressure p (NpT-ensemble) or volume V (NVT-ensemble) condition.27\u201336 These studies indicated that the apparent contact angle of the meniscus or droplet obtained in the simulations agreed well with the one predicted by Young\u2019s equation (1) in case the solid surfaces are flat and smooth so that the CL pinning may not be induced in a fully relaxed equilibrium state.28 On the other hand, the force exerted from the solid on the fluid should be included in Young\u2019s equation in case the contact line is pinned due to a chemical inhomogeneity of the solid.29\nConsidering the potential applications of nano-wetting, e.g., a flow in a confined space such as a nanofoam50 or a carbon nanotube (CNT),51 the solid surfaces can have a nanoscale radius of curvature, and the interfacial tensions should depend on the curvature. Regarding the water wetting on carbon nanotubes as a solid with a nanoscale curvature, unique wetting behavior52 and a strong diameter dependence of the capillary force were experimentally reported.53 For the liquid\u2013vapor interface, Tolman54 first formulated the size effect of droplet surface tension with a lengthscale called the \u201cTolman length,\u201d55\u201357 and MD or MC simulations have been carried out as well.38,58\u201362 Indeed, the LV interfacial tension can be extracted using a strict definition of the interface position, e.g., based on the force and momentum balances58 and the difference between the pressures inside and outside the droplet based on the Young\u2013Laplace equation. On the other hand, the calculation of\nthe SL and SV interfacial tension on a curved solid surface is not trivial.60,63 For instance, via thermodynamic routes, if we suppose calculation systems for the TI to calculate the SL interfacial tension on a cylindrical solid surface with a nanoscale radius, then, the three interface areas, i.e., the radii of the target solid\u2013fluid (SF) , the reference bare solid, and bare liquid interfaces, should be all different, and this difference would become critical for the evaluation of the desired interfacial tension when the cylinder radius is comparable to the radius differences. Another possibility is via mechanical routes, and it is technically possible to calculate the stress distribution in the cylindrical or spherical coordinates, although the calculation cost significantly increases to obtain the distribution, and indeed, precise calculation in these coordinate systems is not implemented into the MD packages such as LAMMPS64 or GROMACS,65 and the implementation into in-house codes is also rather complicated.58,66\nGoing back to the relation between the SL or SV interfacial tension and the fluid stress in the interface via the mechanical routes, what we need is not the stress distribution but the stress integral. Considering this feature, in our previous study,26 we provided a theoretical framework to extract the SL and SV interfacial tensions from a single MD simulation by using the local forces and the local interaction potential exerted on a quasitwo-dimensional (2D) flat and smooth solid plate immersed into a liquid pool of a simple liquid, called the Wilhelmy plate, and verified through the comparison between the MD results and the interfacial works of adhesion obtained by the TI. This modified Wilhelmy method is advantageous because it does not require computationally demanding calculations such as the local stress distributions and the thermodynamic integration, which needs averaging at each discrete states along the integration path.\nIn this study, we extracted the SL and SV interfacial tensions of a simple Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid around solid cylinders with nanometer-scale radii by applying the modified Wilhelmy equations derived in our previous study26 to investigate the curvature effect67 on the SL and SV interfacial tensions. From the results, we also examined whether Young\u2019s equation holds even for menisci around solids with nanoscale curvature. Finally, we discuss the difference in the curvature dependence between the SL and SV interfacial tensions (free energy) and the SL and SV interaction potential energies (part of the internal energy)."

This LJ interaction was truncated at a cutoff distance of rc = 3.5\u03c3, where quadratic functions were added so that the potential and interaction force smoothly became zero at rc. The constant values cLJ2 and cLJ0 were given in our previous study.\n25 Hereafter, fluid and solid particles are expressed by \u201cf\u201d and \u201cs,\u201d respectively, and corresponding combinations are denoted by subscripts. Most of the simulation parameters are the same as in our previous study, and the values are summarized in Table I with the non-dimensional units normalized by the corresponding standard values based on \u03f5ff, \u03c3ff, and mf.\nThree solid cylinders in contact with the fluid were prepared by using the geometrical configuration of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with their chiral indices of (20,0), (40,0), and (80,0), where the solid particles were fixed on the coordinate with the positions of the hexagonal periodic structure with an inter-particle distance rss of 0.141 nm, i.e., the immobile solid particles formed a hollow single-layered solid surface. Note that the present homogeneous solid surface is considered to be smooth with rss much smaller than \u03c3ff and \u03c3sf, and the CL is quickly relaxed without hysteresis effects on this surface, i.e., pinning is not induced on this surface. The corresponding radii Rs of the cylinder are 0.777, 1.55, and 3.11 nm, respectively. The central axis of the cylinders is set on the z axis, i.e., the zigzag edge of the honeycomb structure was set parallel to the xy-plane. The top and bottom parts of the cylinders are covered by locating additional solid particles as the lid to prevent fluid particles from entering into the cylinder. Note that the structure of these lids does not have direct effect on the simulation results as indicated in our previous study.26\nThe solid\u2013fluid interaction, which expresses the SL or SV interaction, was also modeled by the LJ potential in Eq. (2), where the length parameter \u03c3sf was determined by the Lorentz mixing rule, whereas the energy parameter \u03f5sf was varied in a parametric manner by multiplying a SF interaction coefficient \u03b7 to the base value\nTABLE I.

(3)\nWettability was expressed by this parameter \u03b7, i.e., the contact angle of a hemi-cylindrically shaped equilibrium droplet on a homogeneous flat solid surface and \u03b7 had a one-to-one correspondence,25,28,29 and we set the parameter \u03b7 between 0.03 and 0.15 so that the corresponding cosine of the contact angle cos \u03b8 is from \u22120.9 to 0.9. The definition of the contact angle is shown later in Sec. III. Note that since the solid\u2013solid inter-particle distance rss was relatively small compared to the LJ length parameters \u03c3ff and \u03c3fs, the surface is considered to be very smooth, and the wall-tangential force acting from the solid on the fluid, which induces pinning of the CL, is negligible within the framework such that the stress is defined only by the fluid\u2013fluid interaction and fluid motion, and solid force is dealt with as the external force.28,29,68 Note that this condition can be violated for wetting on a soft solid.45\nWe set a horizontal potential wall on the bottom (floor) of the calculation cell fixed at z = zflr about 5.3 nm below the bottom of the solid plate, which interacted only with the fluid particles with a onedimensional potential field \u03a61Dflr as the function of the distance from the wall given by\n\u03a61Dflr (z\u2032i) = 4\u03c0\u03c1n\u03f5flrsf \u03c32sf \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 1 5 (\u03c3sf z\u2032i ) 10 \u2212 1 2 (\u03c3sf z\u2032i ) 4\n+ cflr2 ( z\u2032i zflrc )\n2\n+ cflr1 ( z\u2032i zflrc ) + cflr0 \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , (4)\nz\u2032i \u2261 zi \u2212 zflr, (5)\nwhere zi is the z-position of the fluid particle i and \u03f5flrsf is set at 0.09\u03f50sf. This potential wall equivalently expressed a mean potential field formed by a single layer of solid particles with a constant area number density \u03c1n. Similar to Eq. (2), this potential field in Eq. (4) was at a distance of zflrc = 3.5\u03c3sf, and a quadratic function was added for a smooth truncation at zflrc . As shown in Fig. 1, fluid particles were rather strongly adsorbed onto this plane because this roughly corresponded to a completely wetting solid wall. With this setup, the liquid pool was stably maintained even in case the liquid pressure is low with a highly wettable solid cylinder or a plate, and a sufficient liquid bulk region was kept between this wall and the bottom of the cylinder or the plate. Furthermore, we set another horizontal potential wall on the top (ceiling) of the calculation cell fixed at z = zceil about 4.7 nm above the top of the cylinder or the plate exerting a repulsive potential field \u03a61Dceil on the fluid particles expressed by\n\u03a61Dceil(z\u2032\u2032i ) = 4\u03c0\u03c1n\u03f5ceilsf \u03c32sf \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 1 5 (\u03c3sf z\u2032\u2032i ) 10 + cceil2 ( z\u2032\u2032i zceilc ) 2\n+ cceil1 ( z\u2032\u2032i\nzceilc ) + cceil0 \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , (6)\nz\u2032\u2032i \u2261 zceil \u2212 zi, (7)\nJ.

In addition to these bottom and top potential walls, we also set\nanother cylindrical side potential wall with its axis on the z axis and with a radius Rsid, which exerts a one-dimensional potential field on the fluid particles\u03a61Dsid(r xy i ) as the function of the horizontal distance from the wall given by\n\u03a61Dsid(rxyi ) = 4\u03c0\u03c1n\u03f5 sid sf \u03c3 2 sf \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 1 5 ( \u03c3sf rxyi ) 10 \u2212 1 2 ( \u03c3sf rxyi ) 4\n+ cflr2 ( rxyi rsidc ) 2 + cflr1 ( rxyi rsidc ) + csid0 \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , (8)\nrxyi \u2261 Rsid \u2212 \u221a x2i + y2i , (9)\nwhere rxyi is the lateral distance of the fluid particle i from the side potential wall. Note that this side wall was adopted to achieve a\nquasi-axisymmetric 2D-meniscus instead of applying the periodic boundary condition in the horizontal x- and y-directions as in our previous study with a solid plate. The parameter \u03f5sidsf was set at 0.0975\u03f50sf so that the resulting contact angle at the side wall may be roughly 90\u25cb. The radius Rsid was chosen so that a sufficiently large LV interface could be kept, excluding the adsorption layers on the solid cylinder and on the side wall. With this condition, we assumed that the LV interfacial tension \u03b3LV was constant there, and we evaluated the apparent contact angle from the differential equation for the shape of an axisymmetric meniscus there as described below with Fig. 2.\nThe system was kept at a constant temperature T of 90 K, which is above the triple point temperature,69 by applying velocity rescaling to the fluid particles within 0.8 nm from the floor potential wall only for the velocity components in the x- and y-directions. This thermostat region was sufficiently away from the bottom of the solid cylinder/plate, and no direct thermostating was applied to the region near the solid so that this thermostat had no effects on the present results.\nJ.

We verified that the temperature was constant in the whole system after the equilibration run described in the following. The velocity Verlet method was used for the integration of the Newtonian equation of motion with a time increment of 5 fs for all systems.\nWe obtained the physical properties of each equilibrium system with various cylinder radii Rs and \u03b7 values as the time average of 20 ns, which followed an equilibration run of more than 10 ns."

            "text": "Similar to our previous study,26 we obtained the distribution of force acting from the fluid on the solid particles by dividing the solid region into equal-sized bins in the z-direction, where a bin height of \u03b4z = 0.2115 nm was used, considering the periodicity of the CNT structure. The average force density d\u03bez/dz was defined by the time-averaged total downward (in \u2212z-direction) force from the fluid on the solid particles in each bin divided by the solid bin area 2\u03c0Rs\u03b4z. Except at the top and bottom of the cylinder or the plate, d\u03bez/dz expresses the downward force per surface area. The average SF potential energy per area usf was also calculated, which was obtained by substituting the downward force by the SF potential energy.\nA half side snapshot and the distribution of time-averaged fluid density \u03c1 around the solid cylinder are shown for the system with SF\ninteraction parameter \u03b7 = 0.15 in Fig. 2. The time-averaged distributions of the downward force exerted on the solid cylinder d\u03bez/dz and the SF potential energy usf are also shown in the right panel. We briefly summarize two essential features in the following, which are qualitatively the same as in our previous study.26 (1) Multi-layered adsorption layers were formed around the solid cylinder and the bottom and side potential walls, and liquid bulk with a homogeneous density is observed away from the cylinder, potential walls, and the LV interface. (2) The total downward force as the integral of d\u03bez/dz can be clearly separated into three local parts, i.e., \u03betopz around the top, \u03beclz around the contact line, and \u03bebotz around the bottom. As indicated in Fig. 2(c), \u03betopz and \u03beclz are positive, i.e., downward forces were exerted, and \u03bebotz is negative, i.e., an upward force was exerted. As in our previous study, the distributions of d\u03bez/dz and usf around the top and bottom had less physical meaning because the top and bottom solid lids in the bin were included, and these parts for usf are not shown in the figure. However, the local integral of d\u03bez/dz had the physical information about the force around the top and bottom parts. Note that \u03bez has the dimension of force per length, which is the same as the surface tension.\nAs exemplified in the density distribution in Fig. 2(b), we evaluated the contact angles for the plate and cylinder systems with different SF interaction parameters to examine the curvature effects. For the plate system, we followed the same procedure used to determine the apparent contact angle as our previous study:26 the LV interface was defined as the least-squares fitting circle on the density contour of \u03c1 = 400 kg/m3 at the LV interface at height z(x) excluding the region in the adsorption layers near the solid.25,26,28,29 For the cylinder systems, the contact angles were evaluated using the analytical formula of the macroscopic meniscus shape. For an axisymmetric equilibrium meniscus around a z-centered cylinder with neglecting gravity, it follows for the meniscus height z(r) given as a unique function of the radial position r \u2261 \u221a x2 + y2 that\n1 r d dr [r sin \u03c8(r)] = p blk V \u2212 pblkL \u03b3LV , tan \u03c8(r) = dz(r) dr , (10)\nwhere \u03c8(r) denotes the angle from the r-direction. We evaluated the three constant values in this differential equation (10) from MD simulations: \u03b3LV was obtained from a MD system with planer LV interfaces by a standard mechanical process,27 whereas pblkV and p blk L were evaluated as the force per area on the top and bottom potential walls of the present cylinder system, respectively, both excluding the region near the side wall. Thus, by fitting the density contour of \u03c1 = 400 kg/m3 at the LV interface excluding the region in the adsorption layers formed near the solid surface and also excluding that near the side potential wall, a numerical solution of the 2ndorder ordinary differential equation (10) can be obtained for each system with different cylinder radii Rs and SF interaction parameters \u03b7. As shown by the dotted black line in Fig. 2, the meniscus shape is well reproduced in this system.

Analogously, the top face is at the height z = zSL sufficiently away from both the bottom of the cylinder and the contact line. On the other hand, the concave faces are set at the SL boundary with its inner side face at r = rSF.\nThe density distributions around the solid cylinder with the smallest radius Rs = 0.777 nm and the plate and the relation between the SF interaction coefficient \u03b7 and cosine of the contact angle cos \u03b8app are shown in Fig. 3. For the latter, we displayed the error bars and guide lines only for the plate and for the cylinder systems with Rs = 0.777 nm for better visualization: the error bars for the systems with other radii were comparable to those for Rs = 0.777 nm. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the apparent meniscus shapes of the cylinder and plate are different, indicating that different force balances should be adopted to properly evaluate the contact angle from the meniscus shape. With the increase of \u03b7, the solid became more wettable, i.e., cos \u03b8app increased, and the cylinder with the smallest radius Rs = 0.777 nm was less wettable, i.e., had smaller cos \u03b8app than the plate for all \u03b7 values tested. However; we should stress that the radius dependence of the contact angle shown in Fig. 3(b) was unexpectedly small even with the smallest cylinder with its radius Rs that is comparable to \u03c3ff or \u03c3sf. We discuss the reason in the following with the comparison between the apparent contact angle \u03b8app and the contact angle predicted by Young\u2019s equation (1) using the interfacial tensions obtained by the local forces."

            "text": "We further investigate the curvature dependence of wetting behavior with the calculations of \u03beclz and the interfacial tensions. We start from the extraction of the upward force Fbotz exerted from the solid on the liquid in the red control volume (CV) around the bottom illustrated in the top-left panel of Fig. 4. Note that we evaluate the upward force Fz on the corresponding liquid from the solid as\nfollows: the positive direction for Fz is +z-direction and is opposite to that for \u03bez (force per length) in the \u2212z-direction on the corresponding solid from the liquid. The top face of the CV at z = zSL is sufficiently away from both the bottom of the solid and the contact line, where the liquid density \u03c1 near the solid is constant in the z-direction, satisfying\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202z = 0 for (r \u2212 Rs)2 + (z \u2212 zSL)2 \u2264 (rsfc )2 (11)\nwith rsfc the cutoff distance for SF interaction. The force of present interest Fbotz comes from the neighboring solid within the cutoff range, i.e., from the red-dotted and black-dotted solid parts as indicated by the blue arrows (top-left panel). On the other hand, with the condition in Eq. (11), the sum of the upward forces on the liquid parts in the red-solid and black-solid lines from the red-dotted solid part (bottom-left panel) is 2\u03c0Rs\u03bebotz , which is the reaction force on the solid around the bottom indicated in Fig. 2. From the comparison of the arrows regarding the two, Fbotz is obtained by adding the missing force and subtracting the unnecessary force as in the bottom panel as\nFbotz = 2\u03c0Rs\u03bebotz + Fdiag(SL)z \u2212 (\u2212Fdiag(SL)z )\n= 2\u03c0Rs\u03bebotz + 2Fdiag(SL)z , (12)\nwhere the two \u201cdiagonal\u201d forces denoted by Fdiag(SL)z and \u2212Fdiag(SL)z have an opposite sign with the same absolute value due to the symmetry under the condition in Eq. (11).\nThe value of unknown Fdiag(SL)z now must be determined. Although this Fdiag(SL)z can be obtained directly by MD simulations based on the definition, in the special case where the solid is so smooth compared to the lengthscale of SF inter-particle interaction that the density can be considered a constant independent of the position as the present solid with the graphene geometry, Fdiag(SL)z can be analytically expressed by\nJ.

Schematic of the extraction of the z-direction force from the solid on the fluid in the red control volume around the bottom, considering the force distribution in Fig. 2.\nFdiag(SL)z = \u2212\u03c0RsuSL. (13)\nThe detailed derivation is described in Appendix B. Similarly, the diagonal force Fdiag(SV)z on the vapor below a plane z = zSV from the solid above the plane can also be analytically formulated by\nFdiag(SV)z = \u2212\u03c0RsuSV. (14)\nBy considering a force balance similar to that illustrated in Fig. 4 and by also assuming that the solid is smooth and the fluid particles are not pinned around the contact line, the downward force on the solid \u03beclz per length is analytically given by (see Appendix C for details)\n\u03beclz = \u2212uSL + uSV = (\u2212uSL) \u2212 (\u2212uSV), (15)\nwhere the final equality shows that \u03beclz is the difference in the magnitude between the two interfacial potential energy densities, considering that uSL and uSV are both negative as exemplified in Fig. 2.\nFigure 5 shows the dependence of SL and SV potential energy densities \u2212uSL and \u2212uSV on the SF interaction parameter \u03b7 for solid plate and solid cylinders with different radii Rs and the comparison between the downward force \u03beclz on the solid around the CL and the difference of potential energy density \u2212uSL + uSV. As easily expected, \u2212uSL and \u2212uSV increased with the increase of \u03b7 as shown in the left panel; however, \u2212uSL and \u2212uSV showed opposite dependence on Rs: \u2212uSL was larger for the smaller cylinder radius Rs whereas \u2212uSV was smaller. We will discuss this interesting difference later. In the right panel of Fig. 5, a very good agreement between \u03beclz and \u2212uSL + uSV is observed for the whole range of \u03b7 with different radii Rs. This indicates that the force from the solid on the liquid in the CV around the bottom shown as a red concave in Fig. 4 can be properly evaluated by Eq. (13) because the present system with solid particles located at the position of graphene was supposed to be sufficiently smooth to meet the condition assumed in the analytical derivation in Appendixes B and C. In addition, due to the opposite radius dependence of \u2212uSL and \u2212uSV shown in the left panel, the difference of \u03beclz for the smallest radius and that for the plate was as large as about 10 \u00d7 10\u22123 N/m,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 054701 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0079816 156, 054701-7\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n25 January 2024 21:38:40\nwhich is comparable to \u03b3LV. In addition, \u03be cl z was much larger than the difference of \u2212(\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0) and \u2212(\u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0) shown later. We now examine the relative SL interfacial tension by using the total static force balance including the force Fbotz on the red-solid CV in Fig. 4,\n2\u03c0\u222b rCV\nrSF dr \u03c4zz(r, zSL)r + \u03c0r2CVpblkL + Fbotz = 0, (16)\nwhere the first and second terms of the LHS are the fluid stress integral on the top face and pressure from the bottom, respectively. Note that the side boundary is set at the bulk satisfying \u03c4rz = 0 and also that the fluid stress is zero on the faces around the concave under the present stress definition.3,26,28,68 The first term of the LHS is related to the relative SL interfacial tension \u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 with extended Bakker\u2019s equation applied for a cylindrical SL interface by (see Appendix A)\n\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 = 1\nrSF [\u222b\nrCV\nrSF dr \u03c4zz(r, zSL)r + (r2CV \u2212 r2SF)pblkL 2 ]. (17)\nThus, from Eqs. (12), (16), and (17), \u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 results in\n\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 = \u2212 Rs rSF \u03bebotz \u2212 rSF 2 pblkL \u2212 Fdiag(SL)z \u03c0rSF , (18)\nwhere the pressure pblkL was measured in MD systems as the normal force per area exerted on the bottom potential wall for r \u2264 rCV because this external force balances the constant bulk wall-normal pressure.28 Under the condition that Eq. (13) holds for Fdiag(SL)z as in the present systems, Eq. (12) is further rewritten by\nFbotz = 2\u03c0Rs(\u03bebotz \u2212 uSL), (19)\nand Eq. (18) writes\n\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 = \u2212 Rs rSF \u03bebotz \u2212 rSF 2 pblkL + Rs rSF uSL. (20)\nSimilarly, the relative solid\u2013vapor interfacial tension \u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0 writes\n\u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0 = Rs rSF \u03betopz \u2212 rSF 2 pblkV + Rs rSF uSV. (21)\nNote that Eqs. (20) and (21) are equivalent to the derivation for the quasi-2D Wilhelmy plate26 except the point that the radii of the solid surface area Rs and solid\u2013fluid interface area rSF are different for the present Wilhelmy-cylinders. In addition, note that the meniscus shape including the contact angle does not explicitly appear in Eqs. (20) and (21).\nFigure 6 shows the relative SL and SV interfacial tensions calculated by Eqs. (20) and (21) for different solid radii Rs with various wettability parameters \u03b7. For a direct comparison between the two interfacial tensions, the values \u2212(\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0) + \u03b3LV and \u2212(\u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0) are shown with the left vertical axis, which correspond to the works of adhesion\nWSL \u2261 \u2212(\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0) + \u03b3LV (22) and\nWSV \u2261 \u2212(\u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0), (23)\nFIG. 6.

For a flat interface, they are defined as the minimum works needed to strip the liquid and vapor off the flat solid surface, respectively, under the constant temperature and pressure condition.28,36 Note that both works of adhesion WSL and WSV are positive, and we will discuss about them later from a viewpoint of the free energy as well as the curvature effects. With the decrease in the radius Rs, both \u2212(\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0) and \u2212(\u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0) became smaller, and the dependence was more remarkable for the larger \u03b7 value. For the smallest cylinder with Rs = 0.777 nm, \u2212(\u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0) was about 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 N/m smaller than that of the flat plate. However, \u2212(\u03b3SV \u2212 \u03b3S0)was also reduced with the decrease of Rs, and this resulted in the rather small dependence of the contact angle on the radius shown in Fig. 3."

This is because for the fluid particles adsorbed onto the solid, the mean potential field formed by the solid particles has a shallower well on a solid with a smaller radius than on a flat surface, and the fluid particles can easily be desorbed.\nDifferent from the average SL interaction potential \u2212uSL, the relative interfacial tension is considered the interfacial free energy per area, i.e., \u03b3SL \u2212 \u03b3S0 is related to the SL work of adhesion WSL in Eq.

The theoretical contact angle calculated by Young\u2019s equation using these interfacial tensions agreed well with the apparent contact angle estimated by the analytical solution to fit the meniscus shape, showing that Young\u2019s equation holds even for menisci around solids with nanoscale curvature if the interfacial tensions are properly evaluated. It was also shown that the curvature dependence of the SL and SV interfacial tensions as the free energy\nwas different from that of the corresponding interaction potential energies as a part of the internal energy, which explains the weak curvature dependence of the contact angle in the present results.\nThe accurate calculation of the interfacial tensions on curved surfaces could explain the unique wetting behavior of water on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), e.g., the temperature dependence of the SV interface structure52 and the diameter dependence of the capillary force53 outside the CNTs as well as the phase change of water in the CNTs70 indicated in experiments. In addition, it should enable the exploration of the Tolman equation for the solid-related interfaces. Related to this, an interesting future target is the interfacial tensions inside the curved interface from a mechanical route, which should enable the analysis of nano-confinement effects or nanoscale capillaries as well, e.g., in carbon nanotubes."

The mean number density per volume \u03c1fV(rf) (= \u03c1/mf) of the fluid is given as a function of the radial position rf of the fluid, whereas a constant mean number density per area \u03c1sA of the solid at r = Rs is used considering the present system with a solid cylinder of zero-thickness without volume; however, the following derivation can easily be extended for a system with a solid with a volume and density per volume in the range r \u2264 Rs.\nWe start from the potential energy on a solid particle at position (Rs, \u03d1s, zs) due to a fluid particle at (rf, \u03d1f, zf), both in the cylindrical r\u03d1z-coordinate, given by Eq. (2). Assuming that the fluid particles are homogeneously distributed in the azimuth direction \u03d1 with a number density \u03c1fV(rf, zf) per volume, the mean potential field from an infinitesimal fluid volume segment of dzf \u00d7 2\u03c0rfdrf on a solid particle is defined by using \u03c1fV(zf, rf) and the mean local potential \u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) as \u03c1fV(zf, xf)dzfdrf \u22c5 \u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f), where \u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) is given by\n\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) \u2261 \u222b 2\u03c0\n0 \u03a6LJ(rsf)rfd\u03d1f, (B1)\nwhere we define\nrsf = \u221a (rf cos \u03d1f \u2212 Rs cos \u03d1s)2 + (rf sin \u03d1f \u2212 Rs sin \u03d1s)2 + z\u20322f ,\n(B2) and\nz\u2032f \u2261 zf \u2212 zs \u2261 \u2212z\u2032s , r\u2032f \u2261 rf \u2212 Rs. (B3)\nThen, the local force in the z-direction f sz(z\u2032f, r\u2032f)dzfdrfdzs exerted on the solid cylinder in [zs, zs + dzs] with an area number density of the solid particles \u03c1sA(zs) from the present fluid volume segment is given by\nf sz(zs, zf, rf)dzfdrfdzs = \u2212\u03c1fV(zf, rf) \u2202\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f)\n\u2202zs \u00d7 dzfdrf \u22c5 2\u03c0Rs\u03c1sA(zs)dzs, (B4)\nwhere\nf sz(zs, zf, rf) = \u22122\u03c0Rs\u03c1sA(zs)\u03c1fV(zf, rf) \u2202\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f)\n\u2202zs (B5)\ndenotes the axial force density on the solid given as a function of zs, zf, and rf.\nSince \u03a6LJ(rsf) is truncated at the cutoff distance rc in the present case,\nJ.

This cutoff is not critical as long as \u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) quickly vanishes with the increase of r, but we continue the derivation including the cutoff for simplicity. With the definition of rSF as the limit that the fluid could reach, it follows that\n\u03c1fV = 0 for rf < rSF. (B7)\nIn addition, considering that \u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) is an even function with respect to z\u2032f, i.e.,\n\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) = \u03d5(\u2212z\u2032f, r\u2032f), (B8)\nit follows for the mean local potential \u03d5 that\n\u2202\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f) \u2202zs = \u2212\u2202\u03d5(\u2212z \u2032 f, r \u2032 f) \u2202zs (B9)\nand \u2202\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f)\n\u2202zs = \u2212\u2202\u03d5(z \u2032 f, r \u2032 f) \u2202zf , (B10)\nwhere Eq. (B3) is applied for the latter. This corresponds to the action\u2013reaction relation between solid and fluid particles under a\nsimple two-body interaction, i.e.,\nf fz(zs, zf, rf) = \u2212 f sz(zs, zf, rf)\n= \u22122\u03c0Rs\u03c1sA(zs)\u03c1fV(zf, rf) \u2202\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f)\n\u2202zf (B11)\nholds for the tangential force density on the fluid f fz .\nBased on these properties, we now derive the analytical expression of the force exerted on the solid above a z-normal plane z = zSL from the liquid below that plane, i.e., the force of interest Fdiag(SL)z given by\nFdiag(SL)z = \u222b rc\n0 dr\u2032f\u222b\n0\n\u2212zc(r\u2032 f) dz\u2032f\u222b\nzc(r\u2032 f)\n\u2212z\u2032 f dz\u2032s f f z\n= \u2212\u222b rc\n0 dr\u2032f[\u222b\n0\n\u2212zc(r\u2032 f) dz\u2032f(\u222b\nzc(r\u2032 f)\n\u2212z\u2032 f dz\u2032s f s z)], (B12)\nwhere the double integral in the square brackets corresponds to the\ntop-left region in Fig. 11.

With an additional assumption of\n\u03c1sA = const., (B15)\nthe second term of the right-hand side becomes zero, and it follows\n\u222b 0\n\u2212zc dz\u2032f(\u222b\nzc\n\u2212z\u2032 f dz\u2032s f s z) = 2\u03c0Rs\u03c1sA\u222b\n0\n\u2212zc dz\u2032f\u03c1 f(SL) V (r \u2032 f)\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f)\n= \u03c0Rs\u03c1sA\u222b zc\n\u2212zc dz\u2032f\u03c1 f(SL) V (r \u2032 f)\u03d5(z\u2032f, r\u2032f), (B16)\nconsidering that \u03d5 is an even function with respect to z\u2032f for the second equality.
