However, these light DM particles can be boosted to very high energies via collisions with energetic cosmic ray electrons. This allows dark matter particles to induce detectable recoil in the target of direct detection experiments. We derive constraints on a scattering cross section of DM and an electron, using XENONnT and Super-Kamiokande data. Vector and scalar mediators are considered in the heavy and light regimes. We discuss the importance of including energy-dependent cross sections (due to the specific Lorentz structure of the vertex) in our analysis and show that the bounds can be significantly different than the results obtained assuming a constant energy-independent cross section, often assumed in the literature for simplicity. Our bounds are also compared with other astrophysical and cosmological constraints.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.015010\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the strongest indicators of physics beyond the Standard Model is dark matter (DM). Its existence can be inferred from diverse observations like galaxy rotation curves, cosmic microwave background radiation, and gravitational lensing [1\u20133]. Expectedly, massive experimental and observational efforts have been undertaken to understand its composition and interactions. Moreover, details of structure formation constrain the type of DM and we know that it is only cold dark matter (CDM) that fits all the evidence. However, these observations remain mute about the exact composition of DM and the interactions it has with itself and Standard Model (SM) particles besides gravitation. Experiments aimed at investigating the particle nature of DM are divided into two categories\u2014indirect detection and direct detection (DD) experiments. Indirect detection experiments [4] focus on the study of signatures of the creation or annihilation of DM. Annihilation or decay of\nDM might produce excess photons in a certain mass window over the SM background, from which the mass of the DM can be inferred. The obvious challenge in this methodology is the very low signal production, which can be difficult to distinguish over the SM background, not to mention the difficulty in modeling the SM photon background in the first place. The basic idea of DD experiments is that DM particles impinge on a detector and transfer a part of their kinetic energy to the target. The rate of such scattering events in a certain recoil energy bin yields DM interaction cross section bounds. Despite intense efforts on DD experiments all around the globe, the search for DM has been fruitless. Some experiments have seen tantalizing hints [5,6], but nothing definitive has come of those [7]. The average velocity of DM particles in the solar neighborhood is v=c \u223c 10\u22123, which limits the energy to be deposited in a detector. Therefore, scattering in the direct detection is assumed to be nonrelativistic. With detectors like XENON1T that have a minimum electronic recoil energy threshold of \u223cO\u00f01 keV\u00de, the smallest accessible DMmass (m\u03c7) ism\u03c7 \u223cO\u00f01 MeV\u00de. For Super-Kamiokande (Super-K), which has a minimum recoil energy threshold of \u223cO\u00f01 MeV\u00de, the smallest accessible DM mass is \u223cO\u00f01 GeV\u00de.1 These detectors cannot access lighter DM particles in this scenario. *debjyoti.bardhan@acads.iiserpune.ac.in \u2020supritha.bhowmick@students.iiserpune.ac.in \u2021diptimoy.ghosh@iiserpune.ac.in \u00a7atanu@cnu.ac.kr\u2225dsachdeva@lpthe.jussieu.fr\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In this study we focus on boosting of DM particles by CR electrons only; for boosting of DM by CR nucleons and neutrinos, refer to [11,13,23\u201326]. Since boosted particles can carry large amounts of kinetic energy, even very light DM particles can deposit a recoil energy ER > Ec in a detector, where Ec is the lower detector threshold. Thus, direct detection detectors as well as neutrino experiments can become sensitive to very low mass DM. However, the sensitivity at lower DM masses is achieved at larger cross sections because the upscattered subcomponent flux is substantially lower than the Galactic DM population. Note that cosmic ray electrons (CREs) are one of the sources of boosting DM particles, among others such as blazars [27,28], helium nuclei [11], diffuse supernova neutrino background [18\u201322], and non-Galactic contributions to DM flux [29]. In most of the existing literature, DM interaction cross sections have largely been taken to be independent of the DM energy. This is a good approximation when (i) the DM is nonrelativistic, and (ii) the DM mediator is heavy. These assumptions will not hold when (i) DM becomes relativistic upon getting upscattered by energetic particles, and (ii) the mediator is light. The DM boost phenomena introduces nontrivial energy dependences for both heavy and light dark mediators.2 The exact energy dependence is operator dependent. The importance of energy-dependent scattering has been recently highlighted in a few works [15,24,30\u201332], where it was found that the resulting\nlimits are orders of magnitude different than those derived under the assumption of a constant cross section. In this paper we consider the direct detection of DM particles, boosted by CREs via recoil of electrons in detectors in specific models of fermionic DM interactions. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss how to obtain the DM flux and the event rate from an upscattered DM. Specifically, we show the effects of energy dependence of the cross section on the flux, as induced by the Lorentz structure of the operator, and compare it to the boosted constant cross section case. In Sec. III, we consider specific operators. Explicit connections of these operators to well-motivated models of DM are also drawn. Section IV provides the results in the cross section mass plane from Super-K and XENONnT, along with a discussion on cosmological constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) as well as collider constraints. We summarize and conclude in Sec. V."

Note that Emin\u03c7 \u00bc Tmin\u03c7 \u00fem\u03c7 . Also note that this convolution need not be done for Super-K. The effect of the energy dependence on DM flux can be understood from Fig. 1. The minimum energy the DM particles must possess in order to impart a detectable recoil to the target electrons sets the lower limit (Tmin\u03c7 ) of the relevant DM energy range. Very high DM energies (T\u03c7 > 103 MeV) are not relevant, since the differential flux (d\u03a6\u03c7=dT\u03c7) falls off at high DM energies. For heavy mediators (vector and scalar), the boost is more effective in increasing the flux at high DM energies when energy dependence of the cross section is taken care of. This is applicable for all DM masses, hence it is expected that including energy dependence for heavy mediators will improve the bounds as compared to the constant cross section scenario. For light mediators (vector and scalar), the energy-dependent boost is less effective than the constant cross section scenario for higher DM masses. This allows us to predict that the light mediator bounds will be stronger than the energy-independent bounds for lighter DM, but the same will become weaker for heavier DM. Also, since in the T\u03c7 regime relevant to us the vector mediator boosted DM flux is greater than the scalar case, we can expect exclusion bounds to be stronger for the former. Finally, since the flux falls for heavier DM, we expect exclusion bounds to be stronger for lighter DM. We find, in Sec. IV, that the exclusion bounds we obtain follow these trends."

The exclusion region is obtained using the following definitions for \u03c72:\n\u03c72 \u00bc X i \u00f0Oi \u2212 Ei\u00de2 \u00f0\u03c3i\u00de2data ; \u00f026\u00de\n\u0394\u03c72 \u00bc \u03c72\u00f0BDM\u00fe B0\u00de \u2212 \u03c72\u00f0B0 only\u00de; \u00f027\u00de\nwhere Oi are the observed number of events, Ei are the expected number of events, and \u00f0\u03c3i\u00dedata is uncertainty in the measured data, for the ith recoil energy bin. For the \u00f0BDM\u00fe B0\u00de case, to calculate the Ei values, we sum the BDM signal and the background B0 for each energy bin. Clearly, if the BDM contribution explains experimental data, \u0394\u03c72 must be less than 0 corresponding with a better fit.\nThe XENON1T Collaboration had reported a 3.5\u03c3 excess of events in the electron recoil range of 1 < ER < 7 keV [6]. However, a recent dataset from the XENONnT experiment [7], aimed at verifying the aforementioned excess, shows that no such excess exists. We use the data from this experiment for our analysis. To derive the exclusion limit with the 95% confidence, we demand \u0394\u03c72 > 40.1 that corresponds to 27 d.o.f. For Super-K, we use the SK-I data, which was taken for total 1497 days of live time [56]. The detector originally looked for the diffuse supernovae background events via inverse beta decay \u03bde \u00fe p \u2192 n\u00fe e\u00fe. In the present work, we assume that the observed events are consistent with the background and hence the signal due to DM should be consistent with the data within the uncertainty. Since an estimate of the background is not found in the literature for SK-I data, we take \u03c72\u00f0B0 only\u00dejSK \u00bc 0. The excluded region satisfies \u0394\u03c72 > 26.3, which corresponds to 95% exclusion limit for 16 d.o.f. Both Super-K and XENONnT experiments are located deep underground to reduce background, but this also attenuates the DM flux entering the detector. The attenuation of DM particles happens mainly due to the interaction with electrons in Earth\u2019s surface, significantly altering the DM flux reaching the detector. While a detailed study of the effects of attenuation on boosted DM is beyond the scope of this paper, we have determined the attenuation bound considering a DM particle with T\u03c7 \u00bc 1 GeV. This attenuation bound corresponds to the cross section for which the DM particle (with T\u03c7 \u00bc 1 GeV) can impart the threshold recoil energy in the detector. For this, we solve the following equation to calculate the energy Tr lost by the dark matter\ndT\u03c7 dx \u00bc \u2212 X T nT Z Tmaxr 0 d\u03c3 dTr TrdTr \u00f028\u00de\nand estimate \u03c3e\u03c7 so that kinetic energy of the DM particle at depth z, denoted by Tz\u03c7, is the detector threshold Eth, for an initial kinetic energy T\u03c7;in \u00bc 1 GeV. The area bounded by the attenuation bound and the exclusion bound is ruled out by our analysis. Also note that ionization effects could dominate above T\u03c7 \u00bc 1 GeV. Moreover, light DM particles (m\u03c7 < me) may backscatter into the atmosphere. In this work, though, we limit ourselves to elastic scattering, leaving a more elaborate treatment for future work. Note that the attenuation limits exist only for the heavy mediators. There is no attenuation bound shown for the light mediator scenario with elastic scatterings and the attenuation bound shown for heavy mediator may also vary once the effects mentioned above are taken into account. The exclusion bounds arising from XENONnT and Super-K data are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 in the heavy and light mediator regime for scalar and vector operators.\n015010-5\nWe find that Super-K sets the stronger bound for heavy scalar and vector mediators. For light mediators, it is XENONnT that sets the stronger bound, even though Super-K has a greater live time and a larger effective target density \u2135. Fermionic DM lighter than O\u00f0100 eV\u00de is highly constrained by the Tremaine-Gunn bound [57\u201360].4 We find that, for the light mediator case, the energy-dependent\ncross section bounds are stronger than the constant cross section bounds for keV-scale DM and weaker for heavier DM. For the heavy mediator case, the energy-dependent bound is stronger than the constant cross section case and competitive for heavier DM. This is, as previously discussed in Sec. II, a consequence of BDM flux behavior, shown in Fig. 1. Of course, the exact value of DM mass at which energy-independent cross section bounds take over as m\u03c7 is increased cannot be predicted by the flux plots alone, since there is T\u03c7 dependence in differential cross\n4For a possible way to evade this bound, see Ref. [61].\n015010-6\nsection relevant at the detector end as well. As discussed in Sec. II, the vector mediator case yields slightly stronger bounds than the scalar mediator case. We also plot the DM attenuation bound for XENONnT and Super-K for the heavy mediator scenario. Similar results have been obtained for vector mediator in Ref. [30], but it should be noted that the dataset used in Ref. [30] is based on XENON100 and XENON1T\u2019s S2-only analysis [68,69], while we use the data based on XENONnT\u2019s S1-S2 analysis; thus the exclusion bounds we provide are slightly different from those obtained in Ref. [30]. Our bounds for boosted DM can also be compared to bounds obtained for nonrelativistic DM using novel materials with extremely low recoil trigger. A prototype device that can measure single photons made using superconducting nanowires is described in Refs. [70,71]. The best bounds obtained from the device are also shown. The bounds they obtained are competitive with our bounds for DM masses m\u03c7 \u2273O\u00f01 MeV\u00de. At the moment, our bounds are much stronger for lower masses, but proposed devices with materials like NbN and Al might give better exclusions in the near future. We have included constraints arising from astrophysical sources like red giant (RG) stars, horizontal branch (HB) stars and white dwarfs (WD) [66] for light mediators. For light scalar mediators, stellar cooling bounds are so severe that they rule out the whole region constrained in this work. In case of a vector mediator, bounds are mild for ultralight mediators due to in-medium effects [72,73]. Bounds from solar reflection of DM [30,45] are important in the heavy mediator case. The cosmological constraints from BBN rule out thermal DM of m\u03c7 \u2272 10 MeV stringently [73,74]. Similarly, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations constrain DM annihilating to an e\u2212e\u00fe pair severely [75]. However, BBN bounds are relaxed in models where DM couples to both neutrinos and electrons [76]. Also, if there is an elaborate dark sector associated in these models so that DM mostly annihilate to other dark sector particles, BBN and CMB constraints can be relaxed even further [77]. For the heavy mediator case, some of the proposed or approved future experimental facilities and detection strategies, discussed in Ref. [78], have great potential to explore the parameter space probed by XENONnT and Super-K shown in Figs. 2 and 3."

            "heading": "V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK",
            "text": "Dark matter poses a unique challenge in physics at the moment. On one hand, a lot of cosmological evidence points to its existence, but, on the other hand, its particle nature is completely unknown. Detection of DM has primarily relied on large terrestrial experiments with a lot of targets for a DM particle from the Milky Way Galactic halo to impinge on. These direct detection experiments can then measure the recoil of the target and thus\nmeasure both the kinetic energy and mass of the DM particle. The challenge to this strategy comes from the fact that DM in our Galactic halo is nonrelativistic, with v \u2248 10\u22123c. With detector recoil triggers being \u223cO\u00f0keV\u00de or larger, the mass of the DM that can be detected is \u223cO\u00f0MeV\u00de. In order to detect low mass DM particles, we can take any of the following measures. The obvious one is to lower the detector recoil trigger. This involves finding new detector materials and building new detectors. A lot of work has been undertaken on this front, notably the use of superconducting nanowires to build a device with the threshold energy of \u223cO\u00f0eV\u00de [70,71]. We, however, focus on a strategy that allows us to use existing detector data to put exclusion limits on low mass DM, viz. by boosting DM particles in the Galactic halo using cosmic ray electrons to relativistic speeds, so that even very low mass DM particles can trigger the detector. In this paper, we considered the effect of such a boost as well as the effect of the Lorentz structure of the couplings, which have been missing in most of the literature until now. DM particles can interact with SM electrons via a \u201cdark\u201d mediator, which is charged under both the DM gauge group and the SM electroweak gauge group. We considered mediators of two kinds\u2014vector and scalar. For each of the cases, we explored the effect when the mediator is very heavy or when the mediator is very light, using data from XENONnT and Super-K. Boosts due to cosmic ray electrons drastically change the DM flux as seen on Earth. The effect though is quite different for different DM masses, as well as for different mediator masses. For light mediators, the boosted flux is suppressed below the constant cross section flux for relatively heavier DM masses, while it is raised above that level for light DM masses. This is very different for heavy mediators, for which the DM flux is augmented above the constant cross section case for all masses. This behavior is largely independent of the nature of the mediator, though there are some numerical differences in the scalar and vector cases. This behavior, in turn, leads us to expect that the energy dependence of the cross section can provide stronger bounds for lighter DM in the light mediator case, while providing stronger bounds for a large range of DM masses in the heavy mediator case. Our analysis meets this expectation. The two experiments whose dataset we use differ in two fundamental aspects. While Super-K has a much larger number of target electrons (as can be seen by the different values of \u2135 used in our analysis), XENONnT has a much smaller trigger energy. The live time for the dataset from Super-K is also longer than for the dataset from XENONnT. We find that, for the light mediator case, XENONnT gives stronger bounds on both the cross section and the electron-mediator couplings compared to Super-K, while for the heavy mediator case, the reverse is true.\n015010-7\nThe exclusion bounds on the cross section obtained from our analysis, for the light mediator case, is competitive with that obtained by the authors of Refs. [70,71] using their prototype superconducting nanowire single photon detector to detect nonrelativistic DM particles for masses above \u223c1 MeV. Our bounds extend much further in the lower mass regions, however, and are also stronger in the heavy mediator case. Of course, the projected limits using novel materials like NbN and Al are much stronger than their current observed limits or ours. In the analysis presented here, we tried to calculate the effect of both boosts for DM particles and the Lorentz structure of the operators involved. We find that both effects modify the bounds from the existing constant cross section case. We also perform a preliminary investigation of the attenuation of DM particles. A more rigorous analysis is in progress and will be presented in a future work."
