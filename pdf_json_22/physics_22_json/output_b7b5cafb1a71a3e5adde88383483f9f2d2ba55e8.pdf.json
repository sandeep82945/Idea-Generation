Teaching scouts the Engineering Merit Badge with an optics and photonics emphasis can expose many scouts to a potential optics/photonics career. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s) 1. Merit Badges 1.1. Merit Badges give scouts the opportunity to learn about sports, crafts, science, trades, business, and future careers. Each merit badge has a merit badge pamphlet (I prefer book) that describes the information the scout needs to know, the requirements the scout must complete to earn the badge, and additional resources. The Star Scout rank requires 6 merit badges, the Life Scout rank requires 5 additional merit badges, and the Eagle Scout rank requires 10 additional merit badges (for a total of 21 merit badges). Of the 21 merit badges, 13 merit badges must be chosen from the \u201cEagle required\u201d list (such as First Aid), but scouts have over 100 other merit badges to choose from to earn the remaining badges. The Engineering merit badge is one such optional, and very popular, merit badge. In 2020, 7,800 scouts earned the Engineering merit badge. 1.2. Engineering Merit Badge Book The Engineering merit badge book, currently 96 pages, has nine sections: \u201cIntroduction\u201d, \u201cWhat Does an Engineer Do?\u201d, \u201cThe Different Fields of Engineering\u201d, \u201cHow Does an Engineer Solve Problems\u201d, \u201cBasic Engineering Concepts\u201d, \u201cLet\u2019s Do Engineering\u201d, \u201cEngineering as a Career\u201d, \u201cThe Professional Engineer\u201d, and \u201cEngineering Resources\u201d. The book contains many engaging pictures, diagrams, charts, tables, and sidebars. An engineering school could consider providing all new students with this book, or write a similar book customized to their specific engineering discipline(s). 1.3. Engineering Merit Badge Book \u201cThe Different Fields of Engineering\u201d Section In the \u201cDifferent Fields of Engineering\u201d section, the merit badge book describes \u201cThe First Engineering Specialties\u201d, which includes a description of Civil Engineering, Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The section also describes \u201cToday\u2019s Many Fields of Engineering\u201d, which includes a description of Aerospace Engineering, Agricultural Engineering, Architectural Engineering, Bioengineering, Ceramic Engineering, Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Marine or Naval Engineering, Materials Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, Software Engineering, and Systems Engineering. But not Optical Engineering or Photonics Engineering. Although Optical Engineering and Photonics Engineering are not specifically mentioned in the book, a merit badge counselor could introduce the scout(s) to the science, technology, and job opportunities of those branches of engineering. 1.4. Engineering Merit Badge Requirement Three The Engineering merit badge has nine requirements. While discussing the merit badge requirements with the scout(s), a merit badge counselor could include a discussion of optics and photonics, such as requirement three: \u201cExplain the work of six types of engineers. Pick two of the six and explain how their work is related.\u201d The merit badge counselor could also include a discussion of the many other branches of engineering necessary for a commercially successful optic or photonic product that is reliable, repeatable, accurate, cost-effective, userfriendly, etc. Sixteenth Conference on Education and Training in Optics and Photonics: ETOP 2021, edited by A. Danner, A. Poulin-Girard, N.

Engineering Merit Badge Requirement Four Another Engineering merit badge requirement to consider is number four: \u201cVisit with an engineer (who may be your counselor or parent) and do the following: (a) Discuss the work this engineer does and the tools the engineer uses; (b) Discuss with the engineer a current project and the engineer\u2019s particular role in it; (c) Find out how the engineer\u2019s work is done and how results are achieved; (d) Ask to see the reports that the engineer writes concerning the project; and (e) Discuss with your counselor what you learned about engineering from this visit.\u201d The engineer the scouts visits (in person or possibly virtually) could be an Optical or Photonics engineer. 1.6. Engineering Merit Badge Requirement Nine The Engineering merit badge requirement number nine is career-related: \u201cFind out about three career opportunities in engineering. Pick one and research the education, training, and experience required for this profession. Discuss this with your counselor, and explain why this profession might interest you.\u201d This could be an opportunity to introduce the scout(s) to a career in optics and photonics, and especially how engineers interact with optics technicians. 1.7. Engineering Merit Badge Counselor Those interested in teaching scouts the Engineering merit badge are encouraged to contact their local scout office. As of this writing, to qualify as a merit badge counselor, you must: (1) Be at least 18 years old and of good character; (2) Be registered with the Boy Scouts of America (position code 42); (3) Complete Youth Protection Training; (4) Be recognized as having the skills and education in the merit badge subjects covered and hold any required qualifications and training as outlined in the Guide to Safe Scouting or the Guide to Advancement \u2013 or use others so qualified; and (5) Be able to work with scout-age youth. If you are unsure how to be a merit badge counselor, what\u2019s involved, etc., ask your local scout Council if there are scout merit badge training opportunities. One can be a merit badge counselor for a single scout troop, a District, or all scouts. I recommend starting small, but starting. 1.8. Future Optics/Photonics Merit Badge The author predicts an Optics/Photonics merit badge will be established; however, teaching the Engineering merit badge with an optics and photonics emphasis is a terrific (and possible necessary) intermediate step.
