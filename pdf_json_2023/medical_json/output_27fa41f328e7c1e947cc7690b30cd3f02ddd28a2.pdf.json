Front. Robot. AI 6:46. doi: 10.3389/frobt.2019.00046\nIn the published article, there was an error in section 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2 The Suspension System, paragraph two, regarding a term in Eq.\u00a02 that was used to describe the simplified suspension system, as represented in Figure\u00a06. This term was erroneously added to the equation because of an oversight, and in any case, it has not been used to elaborate the experimental data.\nThe paragraph previously stated: \u201cBy considering a simplified suspension system as showed in Figure\u00a06 where the presence of the sprung mass is neglected and the shock absorber has a spring constant of k = 37.27\u00a0N/mm, the linkage has mass M1 = 0.9\u00a0kg and length L = 0.1\u00a0m, the idle wheel has a radius of r = 0.04\u00a0m, mass m = 0.5\u00a0kg and stiffness kp, it is possible to write the equations to describe the subsystem behavior:\nI\u0398\u2033 = \u22121 2 gcos\u03b8 (M1L+mg (L+ r)) \u2212 kL20cos\u03b8sin\u03b8 (1)\nI = M1 3 L2 + m 2 r2 +mL2 (2)\nWhere I is the inertia expression for the assembly composed by the suspension linkage and the idle wheel, \u03b8 is the angle related to the angular displacement of the linkage, \u03b8\u0308 its second derivative, and O is the pivot point for the rotational motion of the linkage. By considering the small oscillations, it is possible to rewrite the expression in (Eq.\u00a01) as:\nI\u03b8\u0308 = \u2212gL( M1 2 +m)\u2212 k(L0 cos\u03b1) 2\u03b8\u2212 L2kp\u03b8 (3)\nfn = 1 2\u03c0 \u221a\n6(k(L0 cos\u03b1) 2 + kpL2) 2M1L2 + 3mr2 + 6mL2 (4)\nFrontiers in Robotics and AI 01 frontiersin.org\nGalati and Reina 10.3389/frobt.2023.1204228\nThe last equation in (4) is used to express the natural frequency associated with the suspension system.\u201d\nThe corrected paragraph appears as follows: \u201cBy considering a simplified suspension system as shown in Figure\u00a06, where the presence of the sprung mass is neglected and the shock absorber has a spring constant of k = 37.27\u00a0N/mm, the linkage has mass M1 = 0.9\u00a0kg and length L = 0.1\u00a0m, and the idle wheel has a radius of r = 0.04\u00a0m, mass m = 0.5\u00a0kg, and stiffness kp, it is possible to write the equations to describe the subsystem behavior:\nI\u03b8\u0308 = \u2212gLcos\u03b8( M1 2 +m)\u2212 k(L0 cos\u03b1) 2 sin \u03b8\u2212 L2kp sin\u03b8, (1)\nI = M1 3 L2 +mL2, (2)\nwhere I is the inertia expression for the assembly composed by the suspension linkage and the idle wheel, \u03b8 is the angle related to the angular displacement of the linkage, \u03b8\u0308 is its second derivative, and O is the pivot point for the rotational motion of the linkage.
