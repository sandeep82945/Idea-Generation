    "abstractText": "The superconducting parameters are the key for building or identifying the theory responsible for the mechanism of superconductivity. Such parameters for fulleride superconductors have not been well established despite the tremendous efforts over the past 30 years. Here we provide a full set of parameters through a systematic study on a well-characterized K3C60 sample. The obtained high upper critical field of 33.0\u00b10.5 T from the direct electrical transport measurements together with the relatively high critical temperature and large critical current density classifies K3C60 as a promising three-dimensional superconducting magnet material with the advantage of the rich carbon abundance on the Earth. This high upper critical field along with the large reduced superconducting energy gap and strong phonon self-energy effect supports the strong electron-phonon coupling interactions in this superconductor. The evaluation of all self-consistently obtained parameters suggests the unconventional nature of the superconductivity for K3C60 with the joint contributions from the strong electron-phonon coupling and electron correlations. These results and findings are important not only for fundamentally understanding the superconductivity in fullerides but also for future superconducting magnet developments and applications.",

Such parameters for fulleride superconductors have not been well established despite the tremendous efforts over the past 30 years. Here we provide a full set of parameters through a systematic study on a well-characterized K3C60 sample. The obtained high upper critical field of 33.0\u00b10.5 T from the direct electrical transport measurements together with the relatively high critical temperature and large critical current density classifies K3C60 as a promising three-dimensional superconducting magnet material with the advantage of the rich carbon abundance on the Earth. This high upper critical field along with the large reduced superconducting energy gap and strong phonon self-energy effect supports the strong electron-phonon coupling interactions in this superconductor. The evaluation of all self-consistently obtained parameters suggests the unconventional nature of the superconductivity for K3C60 with the joint contributions from the strong electron-phonon coupling and electron correlations. These results and findings are important not only for fundamentally understanding the superconductivity in fullerides but also for future superconducting magnet developments and applications.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of superconductivity in alkali fullerides with the critical temperature Tc going from 18-19 K for K3C60 [1] through 28-29 K for Rb3C60 [2] to 38-40 K for Cs3C60 [3\u20135] is an important event in modern science after the birth of the new form of carbon called \u2018buckminsterfullerene\u2019 or in short fullerene [6]. Apparently, these three-dimensional molecular solids are different in structure from the early discovered high-Tc cuprates and recently discovered twisted graphene [7]. They in reality share the similar superconducting phase diagram emerging from neighbouring Mott insulating state [4, 5, 7]. This similarity fuels the hope to solve the long-standing puzzle of the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates once knowing the key factors that govern superconductivity in fullerides due to the relatively easy realization of superconductivity with high Tc in fullerides compared to the need of precise tuning in graphene, another purely C-based superconductor.\nThe crucial examination of the theory highly depends on the superconducting parameters. Take the first fullerene superconductor K3C60 as an example, the large differences of these parameters from the experiments make the comparisons with the theory difficult [8, 9]. Conducting electrical transport measurements to realize the zero resistance state, known as one of the two essential features of a superconductor, has long been a challenge in the characterization of its superconductivity. Therefore, the characterization of fullerene superconductors has mainly been performed based on magnetization measurements [1, 10\u201312] due to the challenges in handling\n\u2217Electronic address: xjchen2@gmail.com\nthe air-sensitive samples [13, 14]. Among the several electrical transport studies on K3C60 [15\u201317], magnetic characterizations were absent. In fact, the first experimental evidence for supporting superconductivity in K3C60 from the zero-resistance state and Meissner effect was obtained from different samples [1]. The airtight devices were developed to measure the resistivity for films [1, 17\u201319] and single crystals [20, 21] with the observed zero-resistance state in the superconducting state. Meanwhile, some residual resistances often appeared at low temperatures in the electrical transport measurements on single crystals [15, 22, 23], probably due to the limited crystallinity in films [1, 17, 18] or uncontrolled alkali distribution in single crystals [15, 22, 23]. Alternatively, the resistivity was inferred from some contactless methods [16, 24]. However, these techniques brought about large residual surface resistance [16]. In view of these facts, the electrical transport measurements are still challenging in the characterization of superconducting fullerides. The zeroresistance state and Meissner effect on the same sample have only been realized recently for K- and Rb-doped C60 through the improvements of the sample quality and measurement techniques [25, 26].\nIt has been generally accepted that the resistivity measurement at required high magnetic field and low temperature is a reliable method for accurately determining the critical magnetic field which is fundamentally important due to its close relation to the coherent length and the Cooper pairing strength [28]. At the moment, the upper critical field Hc2(0) values of K3C60 were obtained either through the low-magnetic-field measurements of the magnetization [10, 29] and resistivity [17, 23, 30] or the high-magnetic-field non-contact measurements based on the ac magnetization [31\u201333] and radiofrequency technique [34, 35].

The quality, structure, and phase of the sample were examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering measurements. The XRD profile can be well indexed by the Fm3m space group [Fig. 1(a)], indicating that the synthesized K-doped C60 sample is a single-phase compound with the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure [Fig. 1(b)]. The obtained lattice parameter a is 14.22\u00b10.01 A\u030a, in good agreement with those reported previously [11, 14].\nFigure 1(c) shows Raman spectra of the pristine and\nK-doped C60 collected at room temperature. All the Raman-active modes for C60, including two Ag modes (at 497 and 1469 cm\u22121) and eight Hg modes: 272, 432, 710, 772, 1100, 1248, 1422, and 1574 cm\u22121, are observed in the pristine C60, agreeing well with the literature [36]. The two low-frequency Hg modes and two Ag modes have strong intensities in K-doped C60. The vibrations of these four modes [37] are shown schematically in Fig. 1(d). A recognized approach to determine the doping level of KxC60 is the line-shift of the pinch mode Ag(2). The observed 17 cm\u22121 redshift of this mode yields the doping concentration of about 3 estimated by the empirical relation of 6 cm\u22121 per elementary charge [38]. Therefore, the synthesized sample is homogeneous and has the chemical formula of K3C60 with the fcc structure.\nB. Superconductivity of K3C60\nThe superconductivity of the synthesized K3C60 was identified by the existence of both the Meissner effect and zero resistance state. Figure 2 shows the results from the dc and ac susceptibility (\u03c7) and resistivity measurements. The dc susceptibility directly demonstrates the Meissner effect of the sample, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) \u03c7 curves exhibit a clear drop below 18.5 K, which is defined as Tc. The shielding fraction (SF) of 80% at 2 K is estimated from the ZFC \u03c7 curve. This diamagnetic effect is also\n3 observed through the real part (\u03c7\u2032ac) of the ac susceptibility [Fig. 2(b)], similar to the ZFC \u03c7 curve from the dc measurement. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the resistivity drops rapidly below 18.7 K and quickly reaches the absolute zero value. The zero-resistivity transition of the sample is also indirectly reflected by the imaginary part (\u03c7\u2032\u2032ac) of the ac susceptibility. To response the vortex current signal, \u03c7\u2032\u2032ac can only be induced when the resistivity drops sharply because of the relatively large resistivity in the normal state and the flux exclusion in the complete Meissner state [39]. The peak shape of \u03c7\u2032\u2032ac in Fig. 2(d) is the manifestation of the sharp drop in resistivity. As learned from the literature for the representative magnetization [1, 10\u201313, 32, 33] and nearly all electrical transport [1, 15, 17, 18, 20\u201323, 40, 41] measurements, the evidence for the zero-resistance state and the Meissner effect taken on the same K3C60 sample is quite rare. The present study together with our recent efforts [25\u2013 27] provides solid experimental evidence for supporting superconductivity in synthesized fullerides based on its two essential characters."

The resistivity behaviours at low temperatures and pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T are given in Fig. 3(b). The determination of Hc2 at a given temperature is illustrated in the inset of this figure. The Hc2(T ) data obtained from the high- and low-magnetic fields can be well described by the Werthamer-HelfandHohenberg theory [42]. Note that the experimentally observed Hc2\u2019s at low temperatures are significantly larger than the orbital limit field Horbc2 (0) of 22 T estimated from the Hc2(T ) slope in the low-field regime (H \u22641 T) by using Horbc2 (0)=0.69\u00d7Tc\u00d7|dHc2/dT |T=Tc , suggesting the strong coupling effect. The experimentally obtained Hc2(0) of 33.0\u00b10.5 T basically agrees with most of the high-field experimental results for this material [31, 32, 34, 35].\nThe reliability of the obtained Hc2(0) value is guaranteed by the direct electrical transport measurements at enough high magnetic fields and at low temperatures. As a key indicator in the applications of superconducting materials, the Hc2(0) of K3C60 is little bit higher than that of Nb3Sn with lower Tc of 18 K [43], a typical three-dimensional superconductor well known as superconducting magnets. Interestingly, our Hc2(0) value for K3C60 at ambient pressure is even comparable to those of fcc CeH10 with much higher Tc=115 K at pressure of 95 GPa [44] and ThH9 with Tc=151 K at 170 GPa [45]. However, the need of high pressures to access the superconducting state in these superhydrides limits their technological applications. The larger Hc2(0) for K3C60\nwith the higher Tc compared to those in Nb3Sn offers the attractive opportunities for the technological applications due to the rich carbon abundance on the Earth as well as the low cost. Therefore, the present experimental finding opens a window for future developments and designs of the three-dimensional superconducting magnets based on this material."

The Hc1 is determined by the magneticfield dependence of the dc magnetization M(H) at various temperatures below Tc [Fig. 3(c)]. Within this method, the magnetic field that initially deviates from the linear M(H) behaviour is defined as Hc1(T ) for a given temperature, as illustrated in the upper right of Fig. 3(d). The Hc1(T ) values at different temperatures plotted in Fig. 3(d) are used to determine Hc1(0) of 6.9\u00b10.1 mT through the empirical relation [28] Hc1(T )/Hc1(0) = 1\u2212 (T/Tc)2. With these critical fields, \u03bbL and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length (\u03beGL) can be determined by using the equations: Hc2(0) = \u03a60/2\u03c0\u03be 2 GL and Hc1(0) = (\u03a60/4\u03c0\u03bb 2 L) ln(\u03bbL/\u03beGL) with the flux quantum \u03a60 = 2.0678 \u00d7 10\u221215 Wb.

            "text": "The superconducting energy gap (\u2206) of K3C60 is determined based on the Raman spectroscopy measurements. Figure 4(a) shows the representative Raman spectra in the low-frequency region at a wide temperature range from 5.7 to 100 K. In Fig. 4(b), the Raman spectra at low temperatures below Tc were normalized by dividing the spectrum measured at temperature of 20 K. One can see clearly a linear decrease in the scattering intensity below 60 cm\u22121 (as marked by arrows) when the temperature cools down to 1/2 Tc. This feature becomes\n5\nmore obvious at lower temperatures. Such a linear decrease in the intensity of the electronic scattering can be attributed to the renormalization of the density of state due to the superconducting transition [59]. The 2\u2206 value can be taken from the position where the frequency starts to deviate the linear behaviour. The reduced energy gap 2\u2206/kBTc of 4.7\u00b10.3 is thus obtained with kB being the Boltzmann constant. This value is higher than 3.53 predicted within the BCS framework. The high 2\u2206/kBTc and large Hc2(0) together indicate the strong coupling of the interactions in this superconductor. Similar conclusions have also been drawn from other techniques including point-contact tunneling spectroscopy [60, 61] and nuclear magnetic resonance [62]. Some other studies based on the optical reflectivity [24, 63], nuclear magnetic resonance [50, 62], and photoemission [41] support weak electron-phonon coupling within the conventional BCS framework.\nFor type-II spin-singlet superconductors, the orbital and Pauli paramagnetic effects are two distinct ways for pair-breaking with increasing external magnetic field. Using 2\u2206/kBTc=4.7\u00b10.3, the Pauli-limiting field HP=45.4\u00b12.2 T is then determined accurately from HP = \u2206/( \u221a 2\u00b5B) [64] with \u00b5B being the Bohr magneton. The obtained orbital component of the upper critical field Horbc2 of 22 T is much smaller than HP , yielding the Maki\nparameter [65] \u03b3 = \u221a\n2Horbc2 /HP \u223c 0.7. Since \u03b3 reflects the strength of the paramagnetic effect, this indicates that the orbital effect dominates the Hc2 behaviour for this superconductor.\nIn addition, the electron-phonon contribution to the\nsuperconductivity can be evaluated from the observations of the Raman spectra at temperatures below Tc. The low-frequency Hg(1) intramolecular vibrational mode is chosen as an example to monitor the superconductivityinduced changes. The systematic change of this mode can be seen from Fig. 4(a). The temperature dependence of the frequency (\u03c9), linewidth (\u0393), and electronphonon coupling parameter \u0393/\u03c92 of this Hg(1) mode is shown in Figs. 4(c)-4(e), from top to bottom, respectively. When entering the superconducting state (the green shaded zone), the Hg(1) mode exhibits the downshift (softening) in \u03c9, the increase (widening) in \u0393, and the enhancement of \u0393/\u03c92. These behaviours are due to the superconductivity-induced phonon self-energy effect. The early proposal [66] regarding the phonon evolution with temperature when this material enters the superconducting state with high-resolution from an inelastic scattering technique is finally realized here. The absence of phonon mode near 40 cm\u22121 in the Raman spectra at temperatures below Tc indicates that it is probably an acoustic branch and thus inactive to Raman scattering but visible in the neutron measurements [66]. These results provide the strong support for the important contribution of the electron-phonon coupling to the superconductivity in K3C60. The observed self-energy effect together with the large 2\u2206/kBTc obtained from the same Raman spectra reveals the strong electron-phonon coupling in K3C60, which needs to be included in dealing with the phonon effects [67\u201373]."

As can be seen, RH changes sign at the temperature range of 220-250 K. The change of the carrier character further indicates that the synthesized sample is in a half-filled state with both electron and hole conduction [17, 74]. Similar sign change has also been observed in K3C60 thin films [17] but was absent in the study for K- and Rb-doped C60 single crystals [75]. Interestingly, around the temperature for the sign change, the orientational ordering transition has been reported for C60 [76] and K3C60 [25, 77]. The Hall effect clearly captures the effect of the orientational ordering on the electronic structure. Most importantly, the obtained evolution of nH with temperature close to Tc not only gives the accurate carrier concentration for K3C60 to superconduct but also determines the electronic feature at low temperatures rather than the hole character at room temperature, though the two carrier behaviour was noticed in the band structure calculations [74] and the electron doping is generally believed."

Our Hc1(0) value locates in the middle of this range.

Meanwhile, the strong coupling effect is supported by the large 2\u2206/kBTc values from 4.3 to 6 based on the scanning tunneling microscopy [60, 61] and nuclear magnetic resonance [62] measurements. The obtained value of 4.7\u00b10.3 for K3C60 from the present work is in the middle range of these studies, which supports the strong coupling effect.\nHaving the knowledge of \u03beGL based on the well determined Hc2(0) as well as \u2206, one can derive the average Fermi velocity vF of (5.6\u00b10.4)\u00d7104 m/s by using the formula vF = \u03c0\u2206\u03beGL/~, in good agreement with the measurements and calculations [46, 74].

However, the existing isotope exponent \u03b1 deviates the predicted value of 0.5 from the BCS theory and can be divided two groups depending on the 13C enrichment, one [79] with \u03b1<0.5 and the other [80\u201382] with \u03b1>1.0. The former suggests the strong coupling effect, consistent with our Raman data, and the latter favors the electron correlations [83, 84]. Therefore, the isotope effect suggests that the superconducting pairing in K3C60 originates from either the strong electron-phonon interaction or the electronic correlations. However, it is hard to pin down the exact mechanism due to the scatter of the data.\nNow that a full set of parameters for K3C60 (Table I) has been obtained from the same sample at all the necessary measurement conditions and techniques, they should provide the reliable constraints on the examination of the existing theories and the future theory development for the mechanism of superconductivity.

These self-consistently obtained parameters along with Tc at least can be used to see how far away or close the studied K3C60 locates to the well known superconductors.\n7 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 4 1 0 5 1 0 - 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 T B G K 3 C 6 0 B i 2 2 2 3 Y B C O L S C O B K B O Z n A l S n N bV 3 S i N b S e 2B E D T U 6 F e U P d 2 A l 1 3 T = T B E C T = T F U R u 2 S i 2 4 H e T M T S F U B e 1 3 T c (K)\nT F ( K )\nU P t 3\nFIG. 7: Relationship between the critical temperature Tc and the Fermi temperature TF of representative superconductors. The data derived from the current measurements for K3C60 (open square) are compared with those of various superconductors taken from the previous works [7, 86]. Bi2223, YBCO, LSCO, and BKBO represent Bi2Sr2(Ca,Pb)2Cu3O10+\u03b4, YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4, La2\u2212xSrxCuO4, and Ba1\u2212xKxBiO3, respectively. TMTSF and BEDT are two organic charge-transfer salts. TBG denotes twisted bilayer graphene. The broken line denotes the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature TBEC for an ideal three-dimensional boson gas.\nA recognized measure for judging the nature of correlated superconductors is through the change trend for Tc and TF . All the reported correlated superconductors discovered so far including cuprates, heavy fermion systems, organic materials [85, 86], and even twisted graphene [7] follow a linear relationship between Tc and TF . The common characters for these superconductors are the existence of some competing order(s) and the strong electron correlation effect. Thus, the electron correlations are believed to be the major player for superconductivity in these systems. When adding the obtained Tc and TF values for K3C60 in the map (Fig. 7), we find that this superconductor nicely follows the same linear trend as the other correlated superconductors but being very close to Ba1\u2212xKxBiO3. The trend itself classifies K3C60 as an unconventional correlated superconductor. The neighbourhood for Ba1\u2212xKxBiO3 and K3C60 implies that their superconductivity may be governed by the similar factors. For Ba1\u2212xKxBiO3, till recently it was found [87] that the electron correlations enhance the electron-phonon coupling and they together contribute to the high Tc in this system. It is reasonable to believe both the electron correlations and electron-phonon coupling jointly account for superconductivity in K3C60. This idea finds the support from the theoretical calculations on alkali-doped fullerides mainly focusing on Cs3C60 [72],\nwhere the electron-phonon coupling was found to enhance the electron correlations and they together gave the correct Tc evolution trend with the unit cell volume, though the calculated Tc is generally lower about 10 K than the experimental value. Since the strong coupling effect in K3C60 has been firmly established from high Tc, high Hc2(0), large 2\u2206/kBTc, and the Raman data, the Tc and TF relation derived from other parameters further suggests unconventional correlated superconductivity and the joint contributions from the electron-phonon coupling and electron correlations [8, 9]. Recalling the unconventional isotope effect, the nice collaboration between the strong electron-phonon coupling and electron correlations is thus suggested to be responsible for the observed unconventional superconductivity in K3C60, both in a favorable way. This should be the base and constraints on the examinations of the existing theories and the future theory development for the mechanism of superconductivity for fullerides."

            "text": "Sample synthesis. High-quality K-doped C60 sample was synthesized by using a modified version of a solution-phase reaction process detailed previously [12, 25, 26]. High-purity potassium (99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) and fullerene powder (99.9%, Acros Organics) were mixed with the nominal mole ratio of 3:1 (K:C60). The mixtures, together with certain dose of ultra-dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent, were loaded into a 15 ml borosilicate vial. The glass vial was then treated in an ultrasonic device at around 50 \u25e6C for 5- 10 minutes to accelerate the dissolution of alkali metals and the reaction between potassium and C60 molecules. The colour of the solution turned reddish-brown after the ultrasound process. It should be noted that the temperature of the reaction can not exceed 63 \u25e6C, which is the melting point of potassium, otherwise potassium would melt into small spheres that are difficult to react, thus breaking the desired stoichiometric ratio for superconducting phase. After that, the solution was oscillated in a vortex mixer (Vortex 3000, Wiggens) with 200 r/min for 10 hours to ensure the complete reaction and the homogeneity of sample. Upon filtering, we obtained a black preliminary product. All the above preparation steps were carried out in an argon-filled glovebox with both O2 and H2O levels less than 0.1 ppm. The as-prepared K3C60 was then put into quartz tubes and sealed under vacuum about 1\u00d710\u22124 Pa. The fragile K3C60 sample was obtained after annealing at 250 \u25e6C for 20 hours. Characterization of crystal structure. The crystal structure was determined based on the X-ray diffraction spectrometer (Panalytical Emperean) by using Cu K\u03b1 radiation with wavelength of 1.5406 A\u030a. The polyimide film was used to cover the sample to avoid the oxidation of K3C60. The background signals of the film were carefully subtracted in the subsequent analysis. The space\n8 group and lattice parameters were determined by using Jana 2020 program [88] based on the Le Bail method [89] to fit the diffraction patterns. Raman spectroscopy measurements. The Raman specta were collected in an in-house system with Charge Coupled Device and Spectrometer from Princeton Instruments. The laser with the wavelength of 488 nm and power less than 2 mW was used in the measurements. Pristine and doped C60 were sealed in capillary tubes when collecting the Raman spectra at room temperature [Fig. 1(c)]. For cryogenic Raman spectroscopy experiment, the doped sample was loaded into a sealed cooper holder with an optical quartz window. The sample was then put on the holder equipped with a heater in a cryogenic vacuum chamber to obtain the temperaturedependent Raman spectra (Fig. 4). Magnetization measurements. The magnetization measurements were carried out by using a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS3, Quantum Design). The sample was placed into a nonmagnetic capsule and sealed by GE Varnish to protect K3C60 from air. The dc magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) curves were collected with the ZFC and FC runs at the field of 10 Oe at temperature ranging from 1.8 to 100 K. In the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, the used probe harmonic magnetic field and frequency are 5 Oe and 234 Hz, respectively. The M(H) plots at various fixed temperatures were collected by two steps. Firstly, the stepsize was set to 5 Oe in stable mode from 0 to 400 Oe. Secondly, the H swept from +7 T to -7 T, and then went back to get the complete hysteresis loop. Pauli (spin) susceptibility \u03c7spin. The measured magnetic susceptibility \u03c7meas is determined by the sum of the paramagnetic (\u03c7P ) and diamagnetic (\u03c7D) components. The \u03c7D component includes the core and/or conduction electron (Landau) contributions, where the former can be estimated based on the published Pascal constants, and the latter usually takes 1/3 for the paramagnetic term. The value of \u03c7D for K3C60 can be calculated by \u03c7D(K3C60)=60\u03c7D(C atom)+3\u03c7D(K atom)+\u03c7Landua(conduction electron), in which \u03c7D(C atom)=-6.0\u00d710\u22126 emu/mol and \u03c7D(K atom)=-18.5\u00d710\u22126 emu/mol. We thus obtain \u03c7D=-(5.0\u00b10.3)\u00d710\u22124 emu/mol. By using \u03c7meas=(2.5\u00b10.3)\u00d710\u22124 emu/mol at 20 K (Fig. 6), we have the total bulk paramagnetic susceptibility \u03c7P=(7.5\u00b10.6)\u00d710\u22124 emu/mol, which can be taken as the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility \u03c7spin. Resistivity and Hall effect measurements. Due to the high sensitivity of the sample to air, a nonmagnetic Ni-Cr-Al alloy cell equipped with four air-tight copper leads was developed to measure the electrical and Hall resistivities when keeping good contact between sample and four electrodes and avoiding oxidation. The resistivity and Hall coefficient were determined in terms of the van der Pauw method [90]. The sample thickness for the electrical transport measurements is 0.2 mm. The low-field resistivity and Hall effect measurements were performed on Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design, PPMS). The resistivities at paulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T with the help of a typical four-contact method were measured at the National High Magnetic Field Center, Wuhan, China."
