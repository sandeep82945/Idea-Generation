    "abstractText": "This study aims to investigate the catalytic co-pyrolysis of beech wood with polystyrene as a synergic and catalytic effect on liquid oil production. For this purpose, a tubular semi-continuous reactor under an inert nitrogen atmosphere was used. Several zeolite catalysts were modified via incipient wetness impregnation using iron and/or nickel. The liquid oil recovered was analyzed using GC-MS for the identification of the liquid products, and GC-FID was used for their quantification. The effects of catalyst type, beechwood-to-polystyrene ratio, and operating temperature were investigated. The results showed that the Fe/Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst had the best deoxygenation capability. The derived oil was mainly constituted of aromatics of about 92 wt.% for the 1:1 mixture of beechwood and polystyrene, with a remarkably high heating value of around 39 MJ/kg compared to 18 MJ/kg for beechwood-based bio-oil. The liquid oil experienced a great reduction in oxygen content of about 92% for the polystyrene\u2013beechwood 50-50 mixture in comparison to beechwood alone. The catalytic and synergetic effects were more realized for high beechwood percentages as a 75-25 beechwood\u2013 polystyrene mix. Regarding the temperature variation between 450 and 600 \u25e6C, the catalyst seemed to deactivate faster at higher temperatures, thus constituting a quality reduction in the pyrolytic oil in high-temperature ranges.",

            "text": "Fuels based on fossil fuels have been the main energy source over the last century, especially in the transportation sector. As the petroleum reserves are running dry, and due to severe environmental issues, a new source of fuel should be considered. The development of green renewable fuel is essential to relieve the pressure of burning fossil fuels and to reach the grand goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 [1,2]. Bio-oils from the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass have received growing attention as a fuel substitute [3\u20136]. Unfortunately, this type of bio-oil cannot be a direct fuel substitute due to its high acidity and oxygen content of around 43 wt.% [7]. The elevated oxygen content reduces the heating value, in addition to its corrosiveness and instability [8]. Several approaches have been considered to improve the quality of bio-oil, such as catalytic deoxygenation [9,10], hydrodeoxygenation [11,12], and esterification [10]. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignocellulosic biomass involves the passing of pyrolysis vapor through the pores of the catalyst structure, converting a fraction of the vapor into desirable aromatics and olefins [11,12]. This method has been conducted extensively by researchers since it reduces the oxygen content without any use of hydrogen, and it can\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155758 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 2 of 21\nbe applied in the same reactor [13\u201316]. Nevertheless, this hydrogen deficiency limits the extent of deoxygenation reactions [17]. Catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass can also produce bio-oils of about 5 to 10 wt.% hydrocarbonaceous compounds, but the oxygen content is still high [11,18,19]. The hydrogen deficiency of most biomass can be compensated by co-feeding processes with a hydrogen-rich source such as plastic materials [17,20]. It has been shown that cofeeding biomass with synthetic polymers in catalytic pyrolysis could positively influence the performance of pyrolysis and the quality of products formed [21\u201324]. This addition could mimic hydrodeoxygenation by supplying the needed hydrogen at atmospheric pressure with minor modifications and an attractive performance/cost ratio. Furthermore, this method could consume plastics and limit their disposal, especially those as challenging to recycle as polystyrene [25]. For instance, polystyrene can be converted to styrene via pyrolysis with very high yields (>60 wt.%) [26,27]. Several researchers supported the performance of zeolites, especially ZSM-5 in deoxygenation potential and aromatic selectivity due to its acidity and pore dimension [17,21,22]. It has been proven that modifying zeolite with metal impregnation has many advantages [28\u201330]. W. Yao et al. [31] investigated the catalytic co-pyrolysis of pine wood with low-density polyethylene in a semi-continuous pyroprobe. The catalyst was mixed with the feed with a catalyst-to-feed ratio of 15 at 550 \u25e6C. In this study, the authors used a ZSM-5 catalyst modified with a mixture of nickel (Ni) and phosphorus (P) 3%/2% P/Ni-ZSM-5 and with phosphorous alone 2% P-ZSM-5. The results showed an increase in olefins and aromatics from 43 wt.% for conventional ZSM-5 to about 53\u201354 wt.% for P- and P/NiZSM-5. The word aromatics in this domain usually stands for only hydrocarbon aromatic compounds in this paper, excluding phenols and other oxygenated aromatic compounds. Lin et al. [32] utilized a similar modification of ZSM-5. The study investigated the performance of P-ZSM5 through the catalytic co-pyrolysis of poplar wood and high-density polyethylene in a quartz pyroprobe, with P-loadings varying from 0 to 10 wt.%. The effect of several parameters was studied as heating rates, temperature, residence time, and catalyst-to-feedstock ratio. It was found that the parent ZSM-5 favored aromatic production, whereas the modified P-ZSM-5 favored the formation of light aliphatic hydrocarbons. Another approach was carried out by J. Li et al. [33], where the catalytic co-pyrolysis of pine wood and low-density polyethylene using a gallium-modified zeolite in a semi-continuous microreactor at 550 \u25e6C was studied. The results showed an increase in monoaromatics of 5% in the case of Ga-ZSM-5 compared to the parent ZSM-5 by about 5 wt.%. Previous studies discussed the effect of the modification of zeolites on the catalytic copyrolysis of biomass and polyolefins in particular [31\u201333]. However, the CFP of polystyrene was not extensively studied under metal-modified zeolites. Several researchers investigated the latter only over H-ZSM5, which recorded a further improvement in the quality of the bio-oil towards valuable aromatic products [34\u201336]. To propose a new catalyst modification in catalytic co-pyrolysis, this study used both iron and nickel incorporated with H-ZSM-5. Iron-based zeolites prove to be active in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. It has been stated that 1.4 wt.% Fe produced the largest decrease in oxygen content, from lignocellulosic to about 14 wt.% [37]. Furthermore, nickel-incorporated ZSM-5 was considered in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass to increase the aromatic yield while increasing the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst [38]. The combination between Ni and the acids sites provides a reactive environment for improving aromatic formation [39]. This study aims to present a detailed analysis of the catalytic co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) and beechwood BW (Fagus sylvatica) as lignocellulosic forestry residue, under iron- and nickel-modified zeolites (Fe/NiZSM-5). Indeed, the pyrolysis of PS yields high-value oil, but the aim is to improve the oil obtained from lignocellulose biomass via catalyst co-pyrolysis. BW is used since it is, by far, the most used hardwood in Europe [40], hence producing a lot of beech sawdust. For that, BW must be included in any attempt to study the potential of bio-oil as an alternative fuel. The influence of different parameters, such as metal loading of the catalyst, biomass/plastic ratio, and pyrolysis temperature, on the quality and quantity of co-pyrolysis oil was\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 3 of 21\ninvestigated. At first, each feedstock (BW and PS) was used independently and as a mixture to produce a database reference of pyrolytic oils under the several synthesized catalysts. The best catalyst was chosen; then, other parameters, such as temperature and biomass-to-plastics ratio, were investigated to improve the best pyrolytic oils."

The elevated surface area of all catalysts could have a good impact on the performance of the catalyst. In most cases, the higher the surface area, the better the activity. It has been shown that after impregnation, the surface area would be reduced [31]. It was not the case in this study due to the low metal loading, thus keeping the surface activity of the zeolites high. This observation was in accordance with the work of Li et al. [41], where no significant change in BET surface area was observed for an Fe/ZSM-5 content of around 3 wt.%. N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of the used catalysts are illustrated in Figure 1. The adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms observed for the catalysts exhibited a hysteresis loop corresponding to a type IV isotherm [42]. However, the isotherms showed a broad loop at p/p0 = 0.5\u20131.0, which can indicate the co-existence of both micropores and mesopores. This hypothesis is further verified considering Figure 2a, which describes the distribution of the cumulative pore volume relative to pore size. All catalysts showed similar behavior, so only the Fe/Ni-ZSM-5 figure is illustrated. There was no variation in the specific pore volume of the modified ZSM-5 relative to the parent after impregnation. The pore volume was approximately 0.23 m2/g. This could suggest that Fe and Ni were deposited mainly on the edges and external surface area of ZSM-5 [43]. The derivative of the pore volume relative to pore width was further investigated in Figure 2b. The curve showed two maximums referring to around 2 nm and 6 nm, further verifying the previous deduction of both micro- and mesopores of the prepared ZSM-5.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 4 of 21Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 23\nFigure 2.

IR peaks at wavelengths of 1445 cm\u22121, 1590 cm\u22121, and 1620 cm\u22121 are attributed to pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, along with a weak Lewis acid site at 1577 cm\u22121, which is usually present for zeolites [45,46]. The Lewis acid sites usually come from the extra-framework of Al and O atoms [45,47]. On the other hand, Bronsted acid sites originate from the hydroxyl groups, linking Al and Si atoms, and they are identified by the IR wavebands of 1530 cm\u22121 and 1645 cm\u22121. Most of the latter wavelengths were recorded for the used zeolites with an additional peak of 1490 cm\u22121, which was ascribed to physisorbed pyridine, which can be promoted by both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites [45,47]. The intensity of the peaks formed was reduced due to the increase in temperature to 400 \u00b0C, yet pyridine was not completely removed. This behavior confirms the high strength of pyridine adsorption on the acid sites of the catalyst and highlights incomplete desorption [48].\nFigure 3.

            "text": "First, the GC-MS analysis of various pyrolytic oils was carried out to identify the present compounds in each pyrolytic oil obtained at 500 \u25e6C. The analysis was conducted for BW and PS alone and as a mixture without and with every synthesized catalyst. For instance, around 120 and 100 compounds were identified for PS and BW, respectively. The compounds identified for PS with and without a catalyst were similar, and all the compounds were aromatic hydrocarbons. However, for BW, the majority of the compounds were oxygenated compounds, yet after catalysis, new aromatic hydrocarbons were further identified as benzene, toluene, xylene, styrene, and indene. The identified compounds were grouped into the most relevant organic families divided between oxygenated and hydrocarbon compounds to better visualize further analysis [27,49]. The oxygen content is calculated from the percentage of oxygen atoms in each oxygenated molecule. This method is detailed in a previous work [49]. The families and major products for calibration are illustrated in Table 2. A list of the major compounds is present in Table S1.\n* GC-FID retention time.\nBeechwood pyrolysis produces an oil rich in acids, ketones, and carbohydrates (levoglucosan). The distribution can be observed. Carboxylic acids constituted around 35 wt.%, followed by carbohydrates and ketones with respective concentrations of 17 wt.% and 15 wt.%. It was considered that BW was chemically composed of 42 wt.% cellulose, 37 wt.% hemicelluloses, and 19 wt.% lignin [50]. This would explain the domination of carbohydrates and acids on the liquid bio-oil since they are the dominant species in the independent pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, whereas phenols and guaiacols are derived from lignin [51]. As can be seen, BW pyrolysis has no hydrocarbon aromatic production, thus leaving the oil with high oxygen content and low LHV of around 41 wt.% and 18 MJ/kg, respectively, as shown in Table 3. Table 3 shows the variation in the properties of the bio-oil after catalysis. In contrast to BW pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis showed the formation of aromatic compounds. The total aromatics were around 7 wt.% for the catalytic pyrolysis under the parent ZSM-5. This production of aromatics mainly came at the expense of levoglucosan (derived from cellulose) without any major variation in the other compounds. This can be explained by the transformation of the latter compound into aromatic compounds via catalytic decarbonylation, decarboxylation, dehydration, oligomerization, and isomerization on the surface of the catalysts, as explained in Figure 5 [14]. On the other hand, phenolic compounds and guaiacols seemed to increase after catalysis. The reason for that lies in the aromatic selectivity and pore structure of ZSM-5. Phenols and guaiacols have a similar structure to monoaromatic compounds, so an increase in those compounds can be due to the transformation of aldehydes, ketones, carbohydrates, and furans into oxygenated aromatics in the pores of the catalyst without the deoxygenation step. The LHV and oxygen content varied slightly to be around 20 MJ/kg and 36 wt.%, respectively. This\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 8 of 21\nvariation can be due to catalytic oxygen elimination mainly into CO and CO2, represented\nby an increase in gas yield that is mainly CO, CH4, and CO2.\nTable 3.

This variation can be due to catalytic oxygen elimination mainly into CO and CO2, represented by an increase in gas yield that is mainly CO, CH4, and CO2. The effect of the different metal loadings on the performance of catalytic pyrolysis of BW was investigated, and the results are shown in Table 3. The parent ZSM-5 showed the best selectivity towards aromatics and PAH compared to other modifications. This suggests that the modification by metals on the original zeolite inhibits aromatic formation [37], yet the inhibition is minimal due to low metal loading.

For this reason, this type of oil could be used as a possible substitute for petroleum fuel due to its high heating value and low oxygen and acids content. However, several parameters should be investigated before recommending the oil for automotive fuels (gasoline and diesel), such as octane and cetane number, viscosity, density, distillation profile, etc. [56]. These parameters could not be calculated in this study since a solvent was used to collect the oil; the derived oil should be pure to be able to calculate the latter properties.

Referring to Table 5, the percentage increase in LHV from BW virgin bio-oil attained its maximum for the catalytic pyrolysis with Fe/Ni-ZSM-5 for the 50-50 mix. The latter increase was about 111%, accompanied by deoxygenation of around 92%.\nFigure 10. The evolution of LHV (MJ/kg) and O% (wt.%) in BW-PS (Fe/Ni-ZSM-5) liquid oil as per BW content at 500 \u00b0C.\nThe derived liquid oils were then compared to conventional petroleum fuels to study the possible end-use of each product. The most promising liquid fuel was from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of two different feedstock proportions, 50-50 and 75-50. The first showed a further decrease in oxygen content, making the oil more suitable to be used as automotive fuel. However, due to the high concentrations of aromatics, the oil cannot be used as diesel oil so it should be fractionated to match the gasoline carbon range; then, it could be used with some minor modifications [57].

The oxygen content is higher compared to that of the 50-50 mix; still, it could be used in furnaces for burning or to be blended with gasoline with adequate proportions. Ultimately, a temperature analysis was carried out to specify the optimum operating temperature. The main composition and properties of the 50-50 catalytic co-pyrolysis oil relative to temperature are summarized in Table 6. Regarding the product yield, the liquid and char yield decreased as per temperature, accompanied by an increase in the gaseous yield. This behavior is typical for cracking reactions. Nevertheless, coking on the catalyst surface increased with temperature, and the oxygen content also increased, especially from temperatures of 550 \u25e6C and above. This suggests that the catalyst deactivated and lost its deoxygenation potential at higher temperatures (\u2265550 \u25e6C). This behavior could be attributed to the catalyst\u2019s performance. The catalyst was calcined at a temperature of 550 \u25e6C; therefore, it is expected to have a decrease in performance at higher temperatures. The same behavior was reported by Zhang et al. [17] for the co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and polyethylene. They reported lower catalytic performance when co-pyrolysis was conducted at a temperature of 650 \u25e6C, above the calcination temperature of 600 \u25e6C. Ultimately, the optimum operating temperature for the catalytic co-pyrolysis would be 500 \u25e6C, where the liquid oil had the best quality, and the liquid yield was relatively high.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 14 of 21"

Pyrolysis Experimental Setup\nThe pyrolysis reactions were performed in a semi-continuous tubular reactor with a quartz tube (\u03c6 = 50 mm, L = 1050 mm) inserted horizontally (Figure 12) (Pyrolysis zone). The catalyst was placed downstream in the narrower part of the reactor. The catalyst bed was 1 cm in length and 2.5 cm in diameter, weighing around 3.7 g (5 cm3 volume catalysis\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 16 of 21\nzone). Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of about 400 mL/min. To insert the samples, a stainless-steel sample carrier \u201cspoon\u201d was placed and pushed at the inlet of the reactor, while the other side was connected to a flask and a condenser for liquid collection at a condensation temperature of around 5 \u25e6C. The non-condensable gases were also collected using a Tedlar gas bag. At first, the catalyst and BW were dried in an oven at 105 \u25e6C for 2 h to eliminate excessive moisture. Then, a typical 3 g sample of plastic and/or biomass was loaded into the sample carrier (1.2:1 catalyst-to-feed ratio). After the required temperature was attained, the sample carrier was pushed inside the heating zone to achieve isothermal conditions. Liquid oil was recovered from the condenser and the flask using acetone as solvent. The total mass balance was not achieved since there was some accumulation of bio-oil inside a part of the experimental set-up for catalytic co-pyrolysis, and it was, therefore, very difficult to fully collect the liquid products. The gas yield was measured using GC-FID/TCD, char was weighed, and coke was calculated by the difference in catalyst mass. However, because of the difficulty in determining the amount of oil accurately, its yield was considered as (100%\u2014all other yields). For a typical trial, the experiment was repeated 3 times with a maximum error not exceeding 1%, both for temperature and experimental results. All the experimental conditions utilizing a catalyst were also carried out without a catalyst for comparison purposes. Ultimately, one catalyst (Fe/Ni-ZSM-5) was chosen to carry out feedstock ratio and temperature analysis. This catalyst was chosen since it gave the best results during catalytic co-pyrolysis.

Several standard solutions of the reference compounds of different concentrations were prepared and dissolved in acetone. Four-point calibration curves (with R2 > 0.99) were established for these pure compounds. For each chemical group, calibration data of the reference compound were used to derive the concentration of all compounds inside the same family by computing the relative response factor between each compound and the reference compound in the same family. This method takes into consideration the structural and molecular differences between compounds to derive a difference in the response factor. The effective carbon number method (ECN) was used to correct the relative response factor [58].\n2.4.4.

The oven temperature program was set in a range of 100\u2013180 \u25e6C. The FID detects hydrocarbons, whereas the TCD for allowed measuring H2 and N2. The methanizer was used to convert CO and CO2 to methane for detection.\n2.4.5. Lower Heating Value (LHV) and Synergism between Biomass and Plastic\nDulong equation [59] was used to calculate the LHV and HHV of each pyrolytic oil:\nHHVfuel = 33.80 xC + 144.20 xH \u2212 18.03 xO (MJ/kg) (1)\nLHVfuel = HHVfuel \u2212 21.96 xH (MJ/kg) (2)\nxC, xH, and xO are the respective weight percentage of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5758 18 of 21\nThe synergetic effect was investigated to better understand the interactions between biomass and plastic with and without catalysts. Equation (3) was used to calculate the theoretical properties and concentration (xtheo) based on the weighted average sum of each feedstock and their corresponding liquid or gas yield. The equation was developed further to compute the expected masses.\nxtheo = mtheo mtotal = xpypwp + xbybwb ypwp + ybwp (3)\nwhere mtheo is the theoretical mass produced and mtotal is the total theoretical mass of the liquid oil. xp and xb are the desired product mass percentage, yp and yb are the pyrolytic liquid or gas yield, and wp and wb are the weight percentage of the biomass and plastic in the biomass\u2013plastic mix, respectively. The significance of this equation is that we could compare the values directly to the experimental value. If xexp > xtheo, the synergy is positive for that product, xexp < xtheo negative synergies, and, finally, xexp \u2248 xtheo no synergy."

After deeper analysis, the derived oil mainly constituted about 92 wt.% of aromatics for the 1:1 mixture of beechwood and polystyrene with a high heating value of around 39 MJ/kg compared to 18 MJ/kg for beechwood bio-oil. The liquid oil experienced a great reduction in the oxygen content from 41 wt.% (beechwood) to just 3 wt.% for the polystyrene\u2013beechwood 50-50 mixture, which is a great reduction of about 92%. The catalytic and synergetic effects were more effective with high biomass proportions. This could increase the utilization of a renewable and reliable carbon-neutral energy source in an economically feasible process. The derived oil could be used as alternative gasoline after further testing or it could be blended with gasoline due to its high aromaticity and low oxygen content. In the end, using these wastes to produce valuable energetic oil is one step forward in the long journey towards ensuring energy security away from petroleum sources, in addition to the major contribution to waste management and landfill reduction.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28155758/s1, Table S1: List of the major products present in BW-PS catalytic pyrolytic oil.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.J., L.A., A.E.S., R.E.H. and B.T.; methodology, Y.J., G.C.A.R.; validation, G.C.A.R., L.A., A.E.S., R.E.H. and B.T.; formal analysis, Y.J.; investigation, Y.J. and G.C.A.R.; resources, L.A. and B.T.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.J.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.A., A.E.S., R.E.H. and B.T.; visualization, Y.J., G.C.A.R., L.A., A.E.S., R.E.H. and B.T.; supervision, L.A., A.E.S., R.E.H. and B.T.; project administration, B.T.; funding acquisition, L.A. and B.T.
