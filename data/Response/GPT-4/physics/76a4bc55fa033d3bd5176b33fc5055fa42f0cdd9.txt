Development of Non-destructive Extraction Methods for IBPs: Focused research on creating novel, non-destructive extraction techniques to efficiently release IBPs from plant matrices without compromising their structural integrity or antioxidant capacities. This could involve exploring innovative physical methods like pulsed electric fields or ultrasound-assisted extraction that can enhance the yield of IBPs while preserving their bioactivity.

Investigating the Role of Gut Microbiota in the Metabolism of IBPs: Given the significant role of gut microbiota in fermenting and transforming IBPs into bioactive metabolites, research could delve into identifying specific strains of bacteria that are most efficient at this process. Understanding this interaction could lead to probiotic formulations designed to enhance the bioavailability and health benefits of IBPs consumed through diet.

IBPs as Natural Preservatives in Food Industry: Exploring the potential application of IBPs as natural antioxidants and preservatives in the food industry. This could involve assessing the efficacy of IBPs in prolonging shelf life, maintaining nutritional quality, and preventing oxidation in various food products compared to synthetic preservatives.

IBPs in Chronic Disease Management: Conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of IBPs in managing and preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This research would help in understanding the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of IBPs in human health.

Engineering Crops with Enhanced IBPs Content: Utilizing genetic engineering and plant breeding techniques to develop crop varieties with higher levels of IBPs in edible parts. Research could focus on understanding the biosynthetic pathways of IBPs in plants and manipulating these pathways to enhance the accumulation of these compounds, leading to more nutritious and health-promoting food crops.
