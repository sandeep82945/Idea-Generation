    "abstractText": "Robot path planning is an important component of ensuring the robots complete work tasks effectively. Nowadays, most maps used for robot path planning obtain relevant coordinate information through sensor measurement, establish a map model based on coordinate information, and then carry out path planning for the robot, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, a method of robot path planning based on ant colony algorithms after the standardized design of non-standard map grids such as photos was studied. This method combines the robot grid map modeling with image processing, bringing in calibration objects. By converting non-standard actual environment maps into standard grid maps, this method was made suitable for robot motion path planning on non-standard maps of different types and sizes. After obtaining the planned path and pose, the robot motion path planning map under the non-standard map was obtained by combining the planned path and pose with the non-standard real environment map. The experimental results showed that this method has a high adaptability to robot non-standard map motion planning, can realize robot path planning under non-standard real environment maps, and can make the obtained robot motion path display more intuitive and convenient.",

            "text": "With the development of the times, robots have become indispensable assistants in various industries, among which mobile robots are more widely used due to their unique structure. At bus stops, they can replace humans in automatic response. In warehouses, they can replace humans for material handling. On the battlefield, they can even replace humans in charge, assault, etc. [1\u20134]. The unique functions of robots make them increasingly at the forefront of technological development and an indispensable tool for humanity. The determination of the robot\u2019s movement path is a crucial step in completing work tasks. The planning of robot movement path mainly refers to the route that the robot needs to pass through during the process of reaching another position from one location. This route not only ensures that the robot can reach the endpoint from the starting point but also ensures that the robot can avoid obstacles and dangerous objects on the path. With the development of technology, the intelligence level of robot movement path planning has increasingly become a focus of research for researchers. How robots can quickly and intelligently determine their movement paths can greatly optimize the autonomy and speed of mobile robot navigation. Therefore, the study of robot path planning method is of great significance [5]. In order to determine the robot\u2019s motion path, it is first necessary to obtain the robot\u2019s motion environment information, which is the robot\u2019s motion environment map. Currently, robot mobile maps mainly include Occupancy Grid Map, Octo Map, and Point cloud Map. Due to the discreteness of data in computer, we need to perform a discreteness design on\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177502 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 2 of 25\nthe x and y axes. In this way, we can obtain a large number of grids through discretization design on the x and y axes. Each grid can be represented by 0 or 1. This can generate a structured Occupancy Grid Map. Occupancy Grid Maps are typically generated through laser measurement of relevant data. It has a simple structure and is easy to implement various intelligent path planning algorithms for robots [6,7]. In addition, we can continuously split the 3D grid map into smaller cubes, label obstacles, and hazards. This forms an Octo map. An Octo map is a tree with eight subordinate nodes. It is often used for the expression of three-dimensional data [8,9]. We can divide the cube into eight small cubes and continue dividing the cubes containing obstacles or hazards until the requirements are met. When all the subordinate nodes of a node are occupied or idle or unknown, we can remove it and all its subordinate nodes. In addition, there is also a point cloud map that uses LiDAR to obtain the threedimensional coordinates of different points and generate maps based on laser reflection intensity. It is precisely with the existence of these maps that the path planning for robots becomes possible. After the robot\u2019s movement map is generated, various algorithms are also used to determine the robot\u2019s movement path and pose. In 1956, Edsger Wybe Dijkstra proposed the Dijkstra algorithm. This algorithm centers around the initial point and gradually expands outward until the goal is achieved. The A* algorithm appeared in 1968 and optimized the Dijkstra algorithm through heuristic functions to find the optimal path faster [10]. In 1985, Khatib proposed an artificial potential field method, which assumes that obstacles have a repulsive force on the robot and the target object has gravitational force on the robot. The repulsive force and gravitational force are combined to form the motion path of the robot [11,12]. The random road map (PRM) algorithm is an algorithm that converts the continuous space state to the discrete space state and then uses search algorithms such as A* to find the path [13,14]. The rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm detects the collision of the acquisition points to avoid spatial modeling [15\u201317]. It effectively solves path planning problems in high-dimensional spaces and complex constraints. In addition, there is the genetic algorithm (GA) proposed by John Holland, which simulates the search for optimal solutions in natural evolutionary processes [18,19]. It is a computational model based on natural selection and genetics [20,21]. By combining various path planning algorithms with environmental maps, we can achieve path planning for mobile robots. Since ant colony algorithms have highly efficient searchability [22\u201327], it has also become a commonly used path planning method. This paper proposed a method to transform the non-standard real environment map into the standard robot mobile environment map-occupancy grid map, and to then use ant colony optimization algorithms to realize the robot moving path, position, and pose planning. In this paper, a new method of ant colony algorithm planning robot motion path using a real environment map was proposed. This method processes non-standard real environment maps and converts them into standard occupancy grid maps. Through ant colony algorithms, the planning path and pose of the robot are given. Then, the robot\u2019s planned path and pose are combined with the original non-standard map and generate a mobile path planning map for the robot in a non standard environment. The planning results of the virtual environment and the results of the real experimental environment have once again verified the application potential of this method. The second part of the article discusses the origin of the research and introduces the practical research issues and related preparations. Part three introduces the overall solution approach, explains the method of converting detailed non-standard maps into standard maps, and the path planning was implemented in steps. The fourth part validated the method of path planning for robots under non-standard maps in real environments through experiments and conducted comparative analysis. The fifth part summarizes the article [28].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 3 of 25"

            "text": "The planning of robot motion trajectory needs to be based on a map. Robot motion maps are mostly based on sensors such as infrared to explore surrounding objects, collect relevant information, and create maps based on the collected information, as shown in Table 1 [11\u201337]. The robot avoids different obstacles based on the formed map and gradually approaches the target through the planned motion path and pose requirements. However, information collection requires a lot of time, and the data processing and map generation after collection also require a lot of time. If the environmental information that needs to be collected is relatively complex, the time for establishing this map is quite long. Efficiently generating robot motion environment maps has become an urgent problem to be solved [38,39].\nThe development of artificial intelligence has made rapid progress. If we can obtain a real environment map by taking photos, process the real environment map, transform non-standard environment maps into robot path planning maps suitable for robot path planning, and then carry out path planning and pose planning for robots, this can greatly improve the efficiency of robot path planning. Grid maps are commonly used nowadays, and if non-standard maps can be converted into more common grid maps, subsequent processing will be more convenient. The purpose of this article is to process the nonstandard real environment map to form a standard grid map, and then realize the robot\u2019s motion path and pose planning through ant colony algorithms.\n2.2. Processing of Non-Standard Maps 2.2.1. Image Processing\nThe image-processing technology is relatively mature. It can be used for disease prediction [40], crop recognition [41], and industrial defective product selection [42]. We can use image-processing technology to segment and crop non-standard maps in real environments, locate, detect, and frame obstacles in the images, and identify obstacles. Subsequently, a new image is generated using the previously obtained image parameters, which is the standard robot motion path planning map that needs to be obtained. Because the image itself expresses the relative relationships between objects in the environment, using non-standard maps for image processing to obtain standard grid maps is more accurate and convenient.\n2.2.2. Obtaining Maps Adapted to Algorithms\nThe grid method is a commonly used map modeling method in robot path planning, which is simple and convenient to use. This article obtains relevant modeling parameters through non-standard real environment maps and uses the grid method to establish a map of the mobile robot\u2019s mobile environment. In the map, 0 represents the area of the free area, and 1 represents the area of obstacles or dangerous objects in the map. The grid with a 0 value is represented in white, while the grid with a 1 value is represented in black (see Figure 1). This is similar to the principle of image binarization in image processing, but due\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 4 of 25\nto the fact that image processing is mostly based on pixels and the data are huge, we need to perform secondary processing after image processing. Alternatively, the non-standard map itself can be processed to obtain a standard map suitable for robot path planning.\nSensors\u00a02023,\u00a023,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 28\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nmap\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mobile\u00a0robot\u2019s\u00a0mobile\u00a0environment.\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0map,\u00a00\u00a0represents\u00a0the\u00a0area\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 free\u00a0area,\u00a0and\u00a01\u00a0represents\u00a0the\u00a0area\u00a0of\u00a0obstacles\u00a0or\u00a0dangerous\u00a0objects\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0map.\u00a0The\u00a0grid\u00a0 with\u00a0a\u00a00\u00a0value\u00a0is\u00a0represented\u00a0in\u00a0white,\u00a0while\u00a0the\u00a0grid\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a01\u00a0value\u00a0is\u00a0represented\u00a0in\u00a0black\u00a0 (see\u00a0Figure\u00a01).\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0similar\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0principle\u00a0of\u00a0image\u00a0binarization\u00a0in\u00a0image\u00a0processing,\u00a0 but\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0fact\u00a0that\u00a0image\u00a0processing\u00a0is\u00a0mostly\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0pixels\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0data\u00a0are\u00a0huge,\u00a0 we\u00a0need\u00a0to\u00a0perform\u00a0secondary\u00a0processing\u00a0after\u00a0image\u00a0processing.\u00a0Alternatively,\u00a0the\u00a0nonstandard\u00a0map\u00a0 itself\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0processed\u00a0 to\u00a0obtain\u00a0a\u00a0standard\u00a0map\u00a0suitable\u00a0 for\u00a0robot\u00a0path\u00a0 planning.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Common\u00a0ant\u00a0colony\u00a0algorithm\u00a0grid\u00a0map.\u00a0\n2.2.3.\u00a0Method\u00a0of\u00a0Image\u00a0Processing\u00a0 After\u00a0the\u00a0image\u00a0is\u00a0read,\u00a0the\u00a0image\u00a0is\u00a0transformed\u00a0into\u00a0an\u00a0array\u00a0I.\u00a0If\u00a0the\u00a0image\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0real\u00a0 color\u00a0array,\u00a0the\u00a0array\u00a0I\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0array\u00a0of\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0n\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.\u00a0Because\u00a0the\u00a0grid\u00a0graph\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0two-dimensional\u00a0 array\u00a0of\u00a0small\u00a0squares,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0necessary\u00a0to\u00a0convert\u00a0the\u00a0image\u00a0into\u00a0a\u00a0two-dimensional\u00a0array.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0necessary\u00a0to\u00a0perform\u00a0binary\u00a0processing\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0image.\u00a0We\u00a0can\u00a0convert\u00a0the\u00a0 true\u00a0color\u00a0image\u00a0into\u00a0a\u00a0grayscale\u00a0image,\u00a0and\u00a0convert\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0n\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0arrays\u00a0to\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0n\u00a0arrays.\u00a0In\u00a0 this\u00a0way,\u00a0the\u00a0non-standard\u00a0map\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0transformed\u00a0 into\u00a0a\u00a0standard\u00a0grid\u00a0map\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0 implement\u00a0ant\u00a0colony\u00a0algorithms.\u00a0The\u00a0binarized\u00a0image\u00a0also\u00a0needs\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0subjected\u00a0to\u00a0obstacle\u00a0recognition,\u00a0positioning,\u00a0and\u00a0subsequent\u00a0data\u00a0processing,\u00a0as\u00a0detailed\u00a0in\u00a0Section\u00a03.\u00a0\n2.3.\u00a0Introduction\u00a0to\u00a0Ant\u00a0Algorithm\u00a0 2.3.1.\u00a0Basic\u00a0Principles\u00a0\nAmong\u00a0intelligent\u00a0algorithms,\u00a0the\u00a0ant\u00a0colony\u00a0algorithm\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0common\u00a0algorithm.\u00a0This\u00a0 method\u00a0mainly\u00a0uses\u00a0the\u00a0method\u00a0that\u00a0each\u00a0ant\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0ant\u00a0colony\u00a0selects\u00a0the\u00a0moving\u00a0route\u00a0 under\u00a0the\u00a0guidance\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0pheromone\u00a0to\u00a0calculate.\u00a0Because\u00a0the\u00a0accumulation\u00a0degree\u00a0of\u00a0pheromone\u00a0released\u00a0by\u00a0ants\u00a0 is\u00a0different\u00a0on\u00a0different\u00a0routes,\u00a0ants\u00a0will\u00a0choose\u00a0the\u00a0route\u00a0with\u00a0 more\u00a0pheromone\u00a0accumulation\u00a0when\u00a0moving.\u00a0We\u00a0can\u00a0assume\u00a0a\u00a0directed\u00a0graph\u00a0G(N,\u00a0A)\u00a0 with\u00a0N\u00a0locations,\u00a0where\u00a0N\u00a0=\u00a0{1,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a04...,\u00a0n\u22121,\u00a0n},\u00a0A\u00a0=\u00a0{(i,\u00a0j)|i,\u00a0j\u00a0\u2208\u00a0N}.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0scheduled\u00a0path\u00a0planning\u00a0task\u00a0is\u00a0represented\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0objective\u00a0function:\u00a0\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc59 , ,\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 and\u00a0\ud835\udf14\u00a0 =\u00a0(i1,\u00a0i2,\u00a0i3,\u00a0i4\u2d48\u00a0in-1,\u00a0in).\u00a0\n\ud835\udc59 \u00a0 is\u00a0the\u00a0distance\u00a0between\u00a0two\u00a0points,\u00a0\n2.2.3. Method of Image Processing\nAfter the image is read, the image is transformed into an array I. If the image is a real color array, the array I is an array of m\u00d7 \u00d7 3. Because the g id grap is a two-dimensional ar ay of small squares, it is necessary to convert image into a two-dimensional array. Therefore, it is necessary to pe form binary processing on the image. We can convert the true color image into a grayscale image, and co vert m \u00d7 n \u00d7 3 arrays to m \u00d7 n arrays. In this way, the non-standard map can be transformed into a standard g id map that can implement t colony algorithms. The binarized image also nee s to be subjected to obstacle recognition, positioning, and subsequent data processing, as detailed in Section 3.\n2.3. Introduction to Ant Algorithm 2.3.1. Basic Principles\nAmong intelligent algorithms, the ant colony algorithm is a common algorithm. This method mainly uses the method that each ant in the ant colony selects the moving route under the guidance of a pheromone to calculate. Because the accumulation degree of pheromone released by ants is different on different routes, ants will choose the route with more pheromone accumulation when moving. We can assume a directed graph G(N, A) with N locations, where N = {1, 2, 3, 4. . ., n \u2212 1, n}, A = {(i, j)|i, j \u2208 N}.\nThe scheduled path planning task is represented by the objective function:\nmin f (\u03c9) = \u2211ni=1 li\u22121,i, (1)\nand \u03c9 = (i1, i2, i3, i4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 in\u22121, in). lij is the distance between two points,\nlij = \u221a( xi \u2212 xj )2 + ( yi \u2212 yj )2, (i, j \u2208 N) (2) When ants move from one position to the next, they can choose the next position based\non the probability of reaching the next position.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 5 of 25\nThis probability needs to be calculated using the following equation:\nPkij(t) = [\u03c4\n(t) ij ] \u03b1 \u00d7 [\u03b7(t)ij ] \u03b2\n\u2211 k \u2208 allowed k[\u03c4 (t) ij ] \u03b1 \u00d7 [\u03b7(t)ij ]\n\u03b2 , (3)\nAmong them, k \u2208 allowed k; i, j is the starting point and target point of the ants,\n\u03b7ij = 1 lij , (4)\n\u03b7ij is visibility, which is the reciprocal of the distance between i and j; \u03c4 (t) ij is the\npheromone strength from i to j at time t; allowed k is a collection of locations that have not been visited yet; \u03b1, \u03b2 are two constants. They are the weighted values of pheromone and visibility. In the process of ant colony algorithms, the pheromone in the algorithm is constantly updated.\n\u03c4 (t) ij = (1\u2212 \u03c1)\u03c4ij + \u2211 m k=14\u03c4 k ij, (5)\nIn the above formula, m is the number of ants in the ant colony. 4\u03c4kij is the Pheromone left by the k-th ant when passing on the path from i to j.\n4\u03c4kij = (Ck) \u22121, (6)\nAmong them, i, j are the points on the path passed by the ant. Ck is the total length of the path obtained by the k-th ant walking along the entire path. In this way, the ant completes the path once, iterates the operation once, and implements the algorithm through continuous iteration [43].\n2.3.2. Implementation\nUsually, after generating a standard grid map, we can set the starting point and the target point to be reached in the planned path according to the requirements and set the basic parameters of the algorithm. The ant colony algorithm is used to search the path. The ant updates the pheromone on the path according to the algorithm after reaching the destination, outputs information, and saves the path information.\n2.3.3. Post-Processing\nAfter the robot path planning is realized according to ant colony algorithms, it is also necessary to obtain the position and pose information of the robot movement according to the path information. After obtaining the path and pose information, it is necessary to combine the path and pose information with the non-standard real environment map to complete path planning and pose planning under non-standard maps. The entire process is a unified one. In this way, combined with image processing, ant colony algorithm, and pose planning algorithm, it is very convenient to realize robot path planning under non-standard maps [2,44,45].\n2.3.4. Related Work\nThere are many methods for robot path planning now. Jinghua Wang et al. combined Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm and used a fuzzy logic system to consider the environmental conditions of path planning to study the path planning of mobile robots in complex two-dimensional terrain [46]. Oscar Loyola, John Kern, and Claudio Urrea proposed to generate the robot\u2019s path by adding a boredom element without a reward [47]. Yigao Ning et al. proposed to add a safe distance to the existing repulsive potential energy field, and an obstacle avoidance controller was designed based on IAPF to study vehicle path planning under a multi-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 6 of 25\nobstacle environment [48]. Novak Zagradjanin et al. proposed a cloud-based autonomous multi-robot system to perform highly repetitive tasks. The study further improved path planning in complex and crowded environments [49]. W Wei et al. studied the longdistance autonomous path planning of intelligent vehicles by using the Dijkstra algorithm and studied the autonomous obstacle avoidance of intelligent vehicles by using the artificial potential field method combined with the direction sensor and infrared sensor [50]. Hao Ge, Xin Li, Leiyan Yu et al. also studied the path planning method through different methods [51\u201355]. These methods implement and optimize the path planning from different aspects, but the establishment of the environment map is based on free modeling, and the path planning is not implemented in the real environment. Haichuan Zhang et al. proposed a search path design algorithm to improve the efficiency of maritime search and rescue. Based on the basic ant colony algorithm, they designed the search and rescue path of the ship at sea [56]. In this study, the designed maritime search and rescue path was finally represented on the navigation map. However, this study was still based on the existing parameters for modeling and generating maps for path planning and was not carried out in the real environment map. It can be seen that the research of planning path algorithms on real environment maps is blank. However, applying the planning path algorithm to the real environment map can not only greatly improve the intelligence and practicability of the algorithm, but also greatly reduce the control difficulty of robots and vehicles. At present, car automatic driving is generally based on the combination of satellite navigation and sensors, if the path can be automatically planned under the real environment map, it will greatly improve the intelligence of automatic driving [57]. The path planning method under the real environment non-standard map of this article will be introduced in detail below. This article first created a non-standard simulation map of mobile robot motion and used the non-standard simulation map to provide an overall introduction to the method proposed in the article. We also conducted experiments using the path planning method proposed in this article by displaying non-standard maps of the environment. The proposed method was experimentally validated. The path planning method for mobile robots under non-standard maps proposed in the article mainly included three steps. Step 1: Process non-standard real environment maps to form a standard grid map for robot motion path planning;\nStep 2: Plan the robot\u2019s motion planning path according to the grid map; Step 3: Integrate the path and pose planned by the grid map with non-standard real\nenvironment maps. Create a robot motion path and pose planning map under non-standard real environment maps."

            "text": "Performing ACO on a real environment map required first normalizing the nonstandard real environment map to generate a standard 2D grid map. Then, a 2D grid map and ant colony algorithm were used to plan the path from the initial location to the target location. At the same time, there were some obstacles in the non-standard map, and the planned path should not collide with these obstacles. We read non-standard real environment maps using Matlab software. To standardize map processing, first, we selected the specified box selection area in the non-standard map, and we cut non-standard maps to obtain standard areas for establishing standard maps. Then, we performed binary processing on the cropped generated area. After the binarization of non-standard maps, obstacle recognition was performed on the map. In order to clearly reflect the actual dimensions on the map, there must be a scale calibration object inside the non-standard map. The dimensions of other objects and the planned path parameters should be referenced by the calibration object. This lay a good foundation for generating maps in non-standard environments that can reflect the real environment. Because the data after obstacle recognition were extracted by MATLAB, the binarized map was then subjected to two-dimensional grid processing. In order to facilitate the reading\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 7 of 25\nof positions on the map, it was necessary to encode the grid after grid processing. This made it very convenient to know the positions of various points on the map. After grid processing, non-standard maps were converted into standard two-dimensional grid maps. Next, path planning was carried out through the ant colony algorithm. After obtaining the planned path, we can proceed with pose planning based on the path parameters. After obtaining the path and pose, we read the non-standard map. Due to the use of size calibration objects in the early stage, the obtained path parameters and pose parameters can be converted into real environmental parameters. Based on these parameters, we can display the planned path and pose in the non-standard map, so as to obtain the planned path and pose of the non-standard map.

From the figure, it can be seen that each obstacle on the map had different sizes and irregular shapes. The circle in the upper right corner of Figure 3a represents the designated calibration object, and we assumed its diameter to be L. The size of other objects was based on it as a reference. In order to streamline, generalize, and standardize the entire process, we box-selected the non-standard map in Figure 3a with a size of a \u00d7 a. Then, we obtained Figure 3b. After box selection, we cropped it to obtain Figure 3c. Next, we binarized Figure 3c to obtain Figure 3d,e, which are two different forms of image binarization. In order to facilitate subsequent processing and facilitate the identification of obstacles and calibration objects, we selected Figure 3d for subsequent processing."

After the box selection, we not only obtained information about the obstacles but also obtained the size L1 of the calibration object in the figure. Though the size of the entire map was a \u00d7 a, because the actual diameter of the calibration object was L, the actual size reflected in the entire diagram should be (a \u00d7 L/L1) \u00d7 (a \u00d7 L/L1). From the figure, it can be seen that the boundary between the identified obstacle and the calibration object in the upper right corner was clearly visible.

            "text": "Because the virtual map path in Figure 7 was obtained from the original non-standard map, the obtained planning path and pose can be regressed to the original non-standard map. According to the data in Figures 7 and 9, the path and position of ant optimization algorithms in the non-standard map can be obtained by displaying them in the original non-standard map. The thick blue line in Figure 10 is the robot motion path planned by the ant colony optimization algorithms. From the initial position to the target position, the robot\u2019s motion path was very clear. Each solid circle in Figure 11 represents the position of the robot at each step on the map, while the straight lines in the circle indicate its upcoming posture. Compared with traditional standard maps, this non-standard map that combines real environments was simpler and clearer for robot motion path planning and pose planning. From the process of robot motion path planning under the above virtual non-standard map, it can be seen that, theoretically, we can obtain the robot\u2019s planned path and pose by converting the non-standard real environment map into a standard grid map. Then, by returning the planned path and pose to a non-standard map, the robot\u2019s motion path planning route and pose in the real environment map can be obtained. Next, we needed to analyze and study the entire path planning process through real non-standard environmental maps.

At the same time, after 100 iterations, it can be seen from Figure 18 that the path planned by ant colony algorithms was generally regional optimization, and the final selected path was 274.233 mm. It should be noted that the path length here was obtained by converting it through a scale. The above results prove that the role of ant colony algorithm in path planning is very obvious.

On the one hand, in order to improve the effect of path planning of ant colony algorithm on actual environment map, we conducted a comparison of six sets of experiments with different iterations, as shown in Figure 21. According to Figure 21, the path length and processing time changes of Figure 22 can be obtained. It can be seen from the figure that under the path planning of the existing ant colony algorithm in a real environment, when the number of iterations was 50 and 800, the moving path displacement was the minimum value of 169.3 mm, and the movement path displacement changed little between 50 and 800 times. However, the processing time of the algorithm increased significantly, and the operation time of 800 times was 13.98 times that of 50 times. Obviously, when other existing parameters remained unchanged, setting the iteration number 50 times can not only improve the operation efficiency but also obtain better-planned paths and poses. This also laid a good foundation for us to conduct other related experiments in the later stage. When the number of iterations was 50 times, the path planning diagram in the real environment was as shown in Figure 23.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 20 of 25Sensors\u00a02023,\u00a023,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 23\u00a0 of\u00a0 28\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure\u00a021.\u00a0Convergence\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0iterations\u00a0under\u00a0non-standard\u00a0maps\u00a0of\u00a0real\u00a0environment.\u00a0\n(a)\u00a05\u00a0iterations.\u00a0(b)\u00a050\u00a0iterations.\u00a0(c)\u00a0100\u00a0iterations.\u00a0(d)\u00a0200\u00a0iterations.\u00a0(e)\u00a0400\u00a0iterations;\u00a0(f)\u00a0800\u00a0itera-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 21 of 25\nSensors\u00a02023,\u00a023,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 24\u00a0 of\u00a0 28\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAccording\u00a0to\u00a0Figure\u00a021,\u00a0the\u00a0path\u00a0length\u00a0and\u00a0processing\u00a0time\u00a0changes\u00a0of\u00a0Figure\u00a022\u00a0can\u00a0 be\u00a0obtained.\u00a0It\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0figure\u00a0that\u00a0under\u00a0the\u00a0path\u00a0planning\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0existing\u00a0ant\u00a0 colony\u00a0algorithm\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0real\u00a0environment,\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0iterations\u00a0was\u00a050\u00a0and\u00a0800,\u00a0 the\u00a0moving\u00a0path\u00a0displacement\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0minimum\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0169.3\u00a0mm,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0movement\u00a0 path\u00a0displacement\u00a0changed\u00a0little\u00a0between\u00a050\u00a0and\u00a0800\u00a0times.\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0processing\u00a0time\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0algorithm\u00a0 increased\u00a0significantly,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0operation\u00a0 time\u00a0of\u00a0800\u00a0 times\u00a0was\u00a013.98\u00a0 times\u00a0that\u00a0of\u00a050\u00a0times.\u00a0Obviously,\u00a0when\u00a0other\u00a0existing\u00a0parameters\u00a0remained\u00a0unchanged,\u00a0 setting\u00a0the\u00a0iteration\u00a0number\u00a050\u00a0times\u00a0can\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0improve\u00a0the\u00a0operation\u00a0efficiency\u00a0but\u00a0 also\u00a0obtain\u00a0better-planned\u00a0paths\u00a0and\u00a0poses.\u00a0This\u00a0also\u00a0 laid\u00a0a\u00a0good\u00a0 foundation\u00a0 for\u00a0us\u00a0 to\u00a0 conduct\u00a0other\u00a0related\u00a0experiments\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0later\u00a0stage.\u00a0When\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0iterations\u00a0was\u00a0 50\u00a0times,\u00a0the\u00a0path\u00a0planning\u00a0diagram\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0real\u00a0environment\u00a0was\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a023.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a022.\u00a0The\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0processing\u00a0time\u00a0and\u00a0path\u00a0length.\u00a0\nSensors\u00a02023,\u00a023,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 24\u00a0 of\u00a0 28\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAccording\u00a0to\u00a0Figure\u00a021,\u00a0the\u00a0path\u00a0length\u00a0and\u00a0processing\u00a0time\u00a0changes\u00a0of\u00a0Figure\u00a022\u00a0can\u00a0 be\u00a0obtained.\u00a0It\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0figure\u00a0that\u00a0under\u00a0the\u00a0path\u00a0planning\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0existing\u00a0ant\u00a0 colony\u00a0algorithm\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0real\u00a0environment,\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0iterations\u00a0was\u00a050\u00a0and\u00a0800,\u00a0 the\u00a0moving\u00a0path\u00a0displacement\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0minimum\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0169.3\u00a0mm,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0movement\u00a0 path\u00a0displacement\u00a0changed\u00a0little\u00a0between\u00a050\u00a0and\u00a0800\u00a0times.\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0processing\u00a0time\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0algorithm\u00a0 increased\u00a0significantly,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0operation\u00a0 time\u00a0of\u00a0800\u00a0 times\u00a0was\u00a013.98\u00a0 times\u00a0that\u00a0of\u00a050\u00a0times.\u00a0Obviously,\u00a0when\u00a0other\u00a0existing\u00a0parameters\u00a0remained\u00a0unchanged,\u00a0 setting\u00a0the\u00a0iteration\u00a0number\u00a050\u00a0times\u00a0can\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0improve\u00a0the\u00a0operation\u00a0efficiency\u00a0but\u00a0 also\u00a0obtain\u00a0better-planned\u00a0paths\u00a0and\u00a0poses.\u00a0This\u00a0also\u00a0 laid\u00a0a\u00a0good\u00a0 foundation\u00a0 for\u00a0us\u00a0 to\u00a0 conduct\u00a0other\u00a0related\u00a0experiments\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0later\u00a0stage.\u00a0When\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0iterations\u00a0was\u00a0 50\u00a0times,\u00a0the\u00a0path\u00a0planning\u00a0diagram\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0real\u00a0environment\u00a0was\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a023.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a022.\u00a0The\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0processing\u00a0time\u00a0and\u00a0path\u00a0length.\u00a0"

            "text": "With the development of technology, robots have become a common intelligent humanassistance tool. Because path planning is the core technology in robot motion control, its importance is obvious. In response to the problem that the maps used for robot path planning are often obtained through sensor measurement, which is time-consuming and laborious. This article studied the method of using of non-standard real environment map to plan the path. By placing calibration objects in the map, the generated non-standard planned paths can reflect the real environment, greatly improving the practicality of the path planning algorithm. In this paper, ant colony algorithms was used for path planning of non-standard map in a real environment, which greatly improved the intellige ce of path planning algorithm. The experimental results of p th planning based on ant colony algorithms for non-standard maps in virtu l and real environme ts show that the method can realize path planni g n pose planning of mobile robots in no - tandard environments. Because th time of sensor measurement to obtai map was saved, the robot path pl ning was more efficient. Since the real environment map was used, the generated mobile robot path and pose were more intuitive. The research results of this article had great reference significance for improving the intelligence level of robot path planning methods in the later stage.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7502 23 of 25\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.L.; Data curation, F.L.; Formal analysis, F.L. and Y.-C.K.; Investigation, F.L.; Methodology, F.L.; Resources, F.L.; Software, F.L.; Supervision, B.X.; Validation, F.L.; Visualization, B.X.; Writing\u2014original draft, F.L. and Y.-C.K.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing, F.L.
