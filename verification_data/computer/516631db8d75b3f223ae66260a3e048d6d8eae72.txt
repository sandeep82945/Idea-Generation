"In this paper, we propose a parameter efficient fine-tuning method called LACoS-BLOOM for extracting multilingual text embeddings from a Large Language Model (LLM). We use 8-bit quantization to reduce the model footprint. We then improve the performance of LLM finetuning using LoRA, and further enhance semantic similarity using a Siamese network with MNR. Our solution can train 7.1 billion BLOOM end-to-end on a single GPU. On STS tasks, our method significantly outperforms the baseline as well as zero-shot LLM BLOOM. Our solution is able to scale up the LLM to 7.1 billion model."
