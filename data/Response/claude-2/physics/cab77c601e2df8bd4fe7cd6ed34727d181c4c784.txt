 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings in this paper:

1. Further optimize the A. neopropionicum - C. kluyveri co-culture to increase OCCA production rates and yields. Strategies could include adjusting pH, increasing ethanol loading rates, in-line product extraction, biomass retention, etc. 

2. Apply genome-scale metabolic modeling to the co-culture to predict optimal conditions and guide strain engineering for improved performance. The recently published GEM for A. neopropionicum could be coupled with existing models of C. kluyveri.

3. Integrate the co-culture with syngas fermentation and evaluate performance on real syngas fermentation effluent. Assess the robustness and adaptability of the co-culture in this application.

4. Explore the mechanism of excessive ethanol oxidation by C. kluyveri during odd-chain elongation. Determine if it is a strategy to deal with propionyl-CoA toxicity and acetyl-CoA limitation. 

5. Engineer C. kluyveri to increase flux through the reverse Î²-oxidation pathway, limit excessive ethanol oxidation, and improve tolerance to propionate/propionyl-CoA. This could boost OCCA yields and rates in the co-culture system.
