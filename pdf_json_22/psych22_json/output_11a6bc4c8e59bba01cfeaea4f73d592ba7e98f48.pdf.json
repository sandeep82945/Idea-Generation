    "abstractText": "In this chapter, a second-order adaptive network model is introduced for a number of phenomena that occur in the context of PTSD. First of all the model covers simulation of the formation of a mental model of a traumatic course of events and its emotional responses that make replay of flashback movies happen. Secondly, it addresses learning processes of how a stimulus can become a trigger to activate this acquired mental model. Furthermore, the influence of therapy on the ability of an individual to learn to control the emotional responses to the traumatic mental model was modeled. Finally, a form of second-order adaptation was covered to unblock and activate this learning ability.",

            "text": "A Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is usually developed after experiencing an event (often consisting of a sequence of steps) that triggers strong negative emotions like fear; e.g., (Duvarci and Pare 2014; Parsons and Ressler 2013). One of the symptoms is a recurring re-experiencing of the event sequence that led to the trauma and that are played again and again in the mind as a kind of flashback movie and thereby trigger the strong negative emotions again. The occurrence of such flashbacks can be described as a mental model that was learned during the traumatic event sequence and that is replayed by internal (mental) simulation.\nIn the literature such as (Admon et al. 2013; Akiki et al. 2017; Holmes et al. 2018; Zandvakili et al. 2020) strong evidence can be found for relations to amygdala,\nL. van Ments (B) AutoLeadStar, Jerusalem, Israel e-mail: laila@autoleadstar.com\nJ.

One of the reported issues here is a reduction of the connections to regions of the prefrontal cortex, whichmakes it difficult to apply emotion regulation. The role of the amygdala in activating fear and of the relation between amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex areas in suppressing fear was found to be crucial; e.g., (Admon et al. 2013; Panksepp and Biven 2012). If the emotion regulation strategy based on suppression is strengthened, this leads to a decrease in physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions; e.g., (Fitzgerald et al. 2018; Ochsner and Gross 2014; Webb et al. 2012).\nMultiple forms of adaptivity play a crucial role in both the development of PTSD and therapies to recover from it. During the development, an important role is played by the learning of a form of mental model of the event sequence leading to the trauma. This is a form of observational learning; e.g., (Benbassat 2014; Van Gog et al. 2009). It is this learnt mental model that is the basis of the flashback symptoms. Moreover, during development also learning takes place to connect different stimuli (by themselves irrelevant but just co-occurring with the traumatic events) to the traumatic stimuli which makes them triggers for the flashbacks; this is a form of sensory preconditioning; e.g., (Brogden 1947; Hall 1996). To recover from PTSD, another form of learning is required: learning to strengthen the connections to the relevant prefrontal cortex areas to improve emotion regulation; e.g., (Ochsner and Gross 2014; Webb et al. 2012). However, this learning capability is impaired by the stress itself, which prevents the learning from taking place in a natural manner. This effect is called metaplasticity; e.g., (Garcia 2002). Metaplasticity (Abraham and Bear 1996) is a form of second-order adaptation, as it exerts a form of control over adaptation. In contrast, the other forms of adaptation mentioned above are called first-order adaptation.\nThe focus in the current chapter is to introduce a computational network model addressing all these forms of adaptivity pointed out above. This leads to a secondorder adaptive networkmodel in which during development of PTSD amental model for the flashbacks is learnt and also an association of a trigger to the traumatic events (both first-order adaptation). As an additional effect of the development phase, a negative effect of metaplasticity occurs that impairs the plasticity of the emotion regulation (second-order adaptation). For recovery, a therapy is applied to resolve the impairment of the plasticity of the emotion regulation which is a positive effect of metaplasticity (second-order adaptation). After this, the learning to strengthen the emotion regulation takes place which then leads to recovery (first-order adaptation).\nIn Sect. 5.2 some background knowledge is discussed for the different types of adaptation. Section 5.3 introduces the second-order adaptive network model to address these forms of adaptation. In Sect. 5.4 some example simulations for this network model are discussed. Finally, Sect. 5.5 is a discussion."

An example of the latter type is intrinsic excitability adaptation, which will not be used here.

It can be explained by:\n\u2018When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite B and repeatedly or persistently (5.1)\ntakes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one\nor both cells such that A\u2019s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.\u2019\n(Hebb 1949), p. 62\nThis is sometimes simplified (neglecting the phrase \u2018one of the cells firing B\u2019) to:\n\u2018What fires together, wires together\u2019 (Keysers and Gazzola 2014; Shatz 1992) (5.2)\nThis first-order adaptation principle will be used to model adaptation for the following.\n\u2022 Development of the trauma: \u2013 Learning of a connection of a trigger stimulus to the traumatic event sequence\nbased on sensory preconditioning (Brogden 1947; Hall 1996). \u2013 Learning the connections in the mental model of the traumatic event sequence\nbased onobservational learning, also using sensory preconditioning (Benbassat 2014; Van Gog et al. 2009).\n\u2022 Recovery from the trauma: \u2013 Strengthening emotion regulation for recovery by learning the connections to\nthe prefrontal cortex areas (Ochsner and Gross 2014; Webb et al. 2012)."

Many mental and physical disorders are stress-related, and are hard to overcome\ndue to poor or even blocked plasticity that comes with the stress. Garcia (2002) describes the negative role of stress-related metaplasticity for this, which often leans to a situation that a patient is locked in his or her disorder by that negative pattern. However, he also shows that by some form of therapy this negative cycle might be broken:\n\u2018At the cellular level, evidence has emerged indicating neuronal atrophy and cell loss in response to stress and in depression. At the molecular level, it has been suggested that these cellular deficiencies, mostly detected in the hippocampus, result from a decrease in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with elevation of glucocorticoids.\u2019 (Garcia 2002), p. 629\n\u2018\u2026modifications in the threshold for synaptic plasticity that enhances cognitive function is referred here to as \u2018positive\u2019 metaplasticity. In contrast, changes in the threshold for synaptic plasticity that yield impairment of cognitive functions, for example (..) in response to stress (..), is referred to as \u2018negative\u2019 metaplasticity.\u2019 (Garcia 2002), pp. 630\u2013631\n\u2018In summary, depressive-like behavior in animals and human depression are associated with high plasma levels of glucocorticoids that produce \u2018negative\u2019 metaplasticity in limbic structures (\u2026). This stress-related metaplasticity impairs performance on certain hippocampal-dependent tasks. Antidepressant treatments act by increasing expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. This antidepressant effect can trigger, in turn, the suppression of stress-related metaplasticity in hippocampal-hypothalamic pathways thus restoring physiological levels of glucocorticoids.\u2019 (Garcia 2002), p. 634\nThis second-order adaptation principle will be used to model adaptation for the following.\n\u2022 Development of the trauma: \u2013 Reducing the adaptation speed for the learning of the emotion regulation\nconnections to the prefrontal cortex areas due to the high stress levels (Garcia 2002)\n\u2022 Recovery from the trauma: \u2013 Increasing the adaptation speed for the learning of the emotion regulation\nconnections to the prefrontal cortex areas due to a therapy that (temporarily) reduces the stress levels (Garcia 2002)\nIn Sect. 5.3 it will be discussed how these have been modeled by using a so-called self-modeling network model."

In the model in this way the learning of several connections in the base level takes place through Hebbian learning. These learning connections are represented by the dynamics of theW-states in the bluemiddle plane. This first-order self-model enables adaptation of the connections of the mental model in the base level."

            "text": "Because the learning itself is adaptive as well, another level is added on top of the first-order self-model level: the second-order self-model level. This level allows to control the learning speed of the statesWX.Y for the learning connections by adding state HWX.Y here representing the speed factor of WX.Y .\nSee for the connectivity of the network model Fig. 5.1; Table 5.1 shows the states and brief explanations of them. Within the network model, the first-order adaptation\nbased on the Hebbian learning principle has been modeled by using a connectivity self-model (in the blue plane) based on self-model statesWX,Y representing connection weights \u03c9X,Y . These self-model states need incoming and outgoing connections to let them function within the network. To incorporate the \u2018firing together\u2019 part of (2) from Sect. 5.2, for the self-model\u2019s connectivity, incoming connections from X and Y to WX,Y are used; see Fig. 5.1 (upward arrows in blue). These upward connections have weight 1. Also a connection from WX,Y to itself with weight 1 is used to model persistence of the learnt effect; in pictures they are usually left out. In addition, an outgoing connection from WX,Y to state Y is used to indicate where this self-model state WX,Y has its effect; again see Fig. 5.1 (pink downward arrow). The downward connection indicates that the value of WX,Y is actually used for the connection weight of the connection fromX to Y. For the aggregation characteristics of the first-order self-model, the Hebbian learning rule is defined by the combination function hebb\u03bc(V 1, V 2, W ) for self-model state WX,Y from Table 5.4.\nThe sensing of an example of a traumatic event te in the form of a sequence of steps is modeled by the sensor states sste1, sste2, sste3. For example, te1 (or traumatic event phase 1), is a potentially dangerous situation for a child you observe, te2 is an action from your side with the intention to save the child from that situation and te3 is an unfortunate failure of your action such that the child actually gets hurt. During this traumatic course of affairs, sensory representations srste1, srste2, srste3 are activated for these phases te1, te2 and te3, and by sensory preconditioning the connections between these sensory representations are learned. By this observational learning process, the mental model of the traumatic event is formed and represented by base states srste1, srste2, srste3 and their connections (see the small pink parallelogram within the base plane in Fig. 5.1) with first-order self-model states Wsrste1,srste2 andWsrste2,srste3 . Similarly, the connection between the sensory representations of the trigger tr and the traumatic event sequence is learnt based on sensory preconditioning, represented byWsrstr,srste1 . These newly formed connections activate thementalmodel as a form of internal mental simulation, every time the trigger is sensed. For the traumatized person this shows as an internal flashback movie of the traumatic sequence. In turn, this flashback movie activates the related negative emotions experienced at the original traumatic event.\nIn contrast to what was believed earlier, such learnt connections usually do not showany formof natural extinction; e.g., (Levin andNielsen 2007), p. 507.Therefore, to make their effect more bearable, the only option is to suppress the emotional consequences related to the trauma by activating the emotion regulation control state csb. However, due to the high negative emotion levels the learning process for the activation of csb is impaired: learning speeds HWpsb ,csb and HWfsb ,csb are very low. Therefore, without any additional help the situation will stay as it is. But, following (Garcia 2002) the therapy th is able to temporarily reduce the level of negative emotions, so thatHWpsb ,csb andHWfsb ,csb get higher values. Due to this, learning of the connections to the control state takes place: Wpsb,csb and Wfsb,csb get higher values."

See an abstracted overview of all types of states and connections used in the model in Tables 5.2 and 5.3.\nThe model with connectivity shown in Fig. 5.1 was then specified by tables in role matrix format: Connectivity characteristics (1), aggregation characteristics (2) and timing characteristics (3); see Sect. 5.6. Four different combination functions from the library are used that each serve a different purpose; see Table 5.4.\nThe advanced logistic sum combination function combines influences of multiple states by adding them but makes sure they stay between 0 and 1, with parameters steepness \u03c3 and threshold \u03c4. The Hebbian learning combination function is used for learning of a connection weight. The stepmod function allows for an activation of states with a predefined length and frequency (here, that is used for the recurring trigger state). The steponce function allows for the activation of stateswith predefined length and start time (here, that is used for the therapy and trauma states)."

Running the software loops over a chosen time period (in this case a time interval from 0 to 1400 with step size t = 0.5) and provides as output a simulation graph for the model. In Fig. 5.2 the development of PTSD is shown based on traumatic event phases te1 to te3 in time period from 100 to 200 without applying therapy. The trigger also occurs from 100 to 200 and after that regularly recurs from 300 to 400, from 500 to 600, et cetera. In Fig. 5.3 the same is shown but this time therapy is taking place from time 400 to time 800 where the therapy leads to recovery. In both Figs. 5.2 and 5.3 in the time period from 100 to 200 the traumatic event sequence te1 to te3 in the world are sensed (via sensor states sste1, sste2, sste3) of which internal representations srste1, srste2, srste3 are made. Due to sensory preconditioning (first-order adaptation based on Hebbian learning), the connections between them are developed (thus forming a mental model of the traumatic event sequence) and also a connection from the\ntrigger representation srstr to srste1. Moreover, they trigger the negative emotional response preparation psb and feeling state fsb, and these in turn reduce the adaptation speed (represented by the H-states) of the learning of the connections to the control state csb (second-order adaptation for metaplasticity). Therefore, no strengthening of the emotion regulation takes place, what would be needed to get rid of the negative feelings. Every time period that the trigger recurs, due to the connection from srstr to srste1 and the connections between srste1, srste2, srste3, the flasback movie is replayed (as a form of internal simulation of themental model) and because of that the negative emotion and feeling are activated to high values again.\nIn Fig. 5.3 it is shown how the therapy temporarily (from time 400 to 800) reduces the negative emotion and feeling due to which the adaptation speeds (represented by the H-states) for the connections to control state csb increase again (second-order adaptation for metaplasticity) and therefore the learning of these connections to csb takes place. This finally results in much lower activations of the emotion and feeling states due to the strengthened emotion regulation."

Furthermore, the influence of therapy on the ability of an individual to control the emotional response to the trauma mental model was explored. Most of the material was adopted from (Van Ments and Treur 2021). The computational model was developed following the approach described in (Treur 2020b), using the following steps:\n\u2022 A conceptual causal network model was designed based on literature on patients with PTSD and existing theories and models about PTSD and emotion regulation \u2022 The conceptual causal network model was translated into role matrices format \u2022 The role matrices were used in the dedicated software environment to obtain\nsimulations; this software environment is available at https://www.researchgate. net/project/Network-Oriented-Modeling-Software.\nDifferent simulation experiments were done, for individuals developing a trigger response, individuals not developing a trigger response, and individuals receiving therapy.\nOther work addressing computational modelling for trauma development and recovery can be found in (Formolo et al. 2017; Naze and Treur 2011; Naze and Treur 2012). However, none of these previous works allowed for the adaptation of the learnt connections of the mental model and therapy. In addition, in (Naze\nand Treur 2011,2012) it is assumed that already built-in upward connections for the emotion regulation exist and are static, while in the model presented here an important part of the development of a trauma is the learning for the mental model of the traumatic course of affairs. In another comparison, (Formolo et al. 2017) addresses social support instead of the type of therapy suggested by Garcia (2002) and used in the current chapter. Moreover, the underlying second-order adaptation process as explained extensively by (Garcia 2002) is fully addressed here while it is ignored in (Formolo et al. 2017; Naze and Treur 2011; Naze and Treur 2012). Finally, in the current chapter the source of the trauma can be a process taking place over a longer time period with a successive course of events over time, and modeled in the form of an internal mental model that can be replayed as a flashback movie, while in (Formolo et al. 2017; Naze and Treur 2011; Naze and Treur 2012) only one traumatic state at one time point is assumed where a flashback is only one static image, which is not quite realistic.\nThe second-order adaptive model described in this chapter can be used as a basis for development of integrated computing applications to support PTSD therapy or to develop virtual characters illustrating the processes involved in patients with PTSD. In such contexts, also possibilities may be exploited for further validation of the model."

Each role matrix has 3 color blocks that match the colors in the graphical representation used earlier: pink for the base level, blue for the first-order self-model states and purple for the second-order self-model states.\nConnectivity characteristics role matrices.\nThe first role matrixmb (see Fig. 5.4, left hand side) represents the base connections between all the states, as presented in the graphical representation in Fig. 5.1. For example, row 6 with state srste1 (also indicated by X6) has two incoming connection: one from sste1 and one from srstr. Role matrix mcw (see Fig. 5.4, right hand side) shows the weights \u03c9 of the connections presented in role matrix mb. There is a difference in nonadaptive (green) and adaptive connections (peach-red). For example, again row 6 with state srste1 with two incoming connections: one non adaptive from sste1 with connection weight 1 and one adaptive connection from srstr, presented by state X20, i.e. Wsrstr,srste1 (a first-order self-model state).\nAggregation characteristics role matrices.\nIn order to transform the presented graphical model with states and connections into a numerical model each state needs a combination function cY (..) to aggregate the impacts of other states on state Y. Role matrix mcfw (see Fig. 5.5) specifies which combination function is used for each state. For example, state sste1 uses the steponce function, so this is indicated with a combination function weight \u03b3 of 1 in the fourth column.\nRole matrix mcfp (see Fig. 5.6) defines the exact parameters used for each state and function. The parameters used depend on the combination function.\nTiming characteristics role matrix and initial values.\nThe speed factors \u03b7Y are specified in role matrix ms; see Fig. 5.7. Concerning the initial values, the simulated scenario starts with most state values 0. The learning states have initial value >0, chosen at 0.1."
