    "abstractText": "Probiotic bacteria have many protective effects against inflammatory disorders, though the mechanisms underlying their actions are poorly understood. The Lab4b consortium of probiotics contains four strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that are reflective of the gut of newborn babies and infants. The effect of Lab4b on atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disorder of the vasculature, has not yet been determined and was investigated on key processes associated with this disease in human monocytes/macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. The Lab4b conditioned medium (CM) attenuated chemokine-driven monocytic migration, monocyte/macrophage proliferation, uptake of modified LDL and macropinocytosis in macrophages together with the proliferation and platelet-derived growth factor-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. The Lab4b CM also induced phagocytosis in macrophages and cholesterol efflux from macrophage-derived foam cells. The effect of Lab4b CM on macrophage foam cell formation was associated with a decrease in the expression of several key genes implicated in the uptake of modified LDL and induced expression of those involved in cholesterol efflux. These studies reveal, for the first time, several anti-atherogenic actions of Lab4b and strongly implicate further studies in mouse models of the disease in vivo and in",

            "text": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease associated with the build-up of lipids and cellular debris in the walls of arteries, and the underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and peripheral vascular disease [1\u20133]. Current therapies against atherosclerosis are associated with considerable residual risk for the disease together with various adverse side effects in some individuals [2\u20134]. In addition, many promising leads from drug discovery and other screening programs have failed because of side effects and off-target actions [2\u20134]. Nutraceuticals, such as probiotic bacteria, have an excellent safety profile and offer substantial promise in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and as adds-on with current pharmaceutical drugs, such as statins [1,3,4]. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying the protective actions of nutraceuticals are poorly understood and further studies are required, as they can form the foundations for clinical trials. In relation to probiotic bacteria, our previous study showed that Lab4P [Lab4 consortium of probiotics composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL21 (NCIMB 30156) and CUL60 (NCIMB 30157), Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) combined with Lactobacillus plantarum CUL66], reduced atherosclerosis-associated risk factors, such as plasma total cholesterol levels and diet-induced weight gain, in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) [5]. More recently, we\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3639. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24043639 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3639 2 of 13\nhave shown that Lab4P causes plaque stabilisation and attenuates atherosclerosis development and plaque inflammation in LDL receptor-deficient mice fed a HFD [6]. In addition, the use of conditioned medium (CM) from these probiotic bacteria demonstrated beneficial regulation of several atherosclerosis-associated processes in vitro, such as inhibition of chemokine-driven monocytic migration, proliferation of monocytes and macrophages, foam cell formation and associated changes in the expression of key genes, and proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) together with stimulation of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells [6]. The Lab4b consortium of probiotics contains four strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria [Lactobacillus salivarius CUL61 (NCIMB 30211), Lactobacillus paracasei CUL08 (NCIMB 30154), Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153), and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172)] and has been specifically designed to reflect the gut of newborn babies and infants [7,8]. CM from these probiotic bacteria have previously been shown to exert neuroprotective activities in vitro [9]. The effects of Lab4b CM on atherosclerosis have not been determined. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the actions of Lab4b CM on monocytes/macrophages and VSMC, two key cell types implicated in atherosclerosis [1], in vitro, together with the underlying molecular mechanisms. Lab4b CM exerted several anti-atherogenic activities, including attenuation of chemokine-driven monocytic migration, macrophage foam cell formation, monocyte/macrophage proliferation, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated migration of VSMC."

Primary cultures of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were used as a model for the effects of Lab4b CM on this cell type in relation to atherosclerosis [6,11]. The highest concentration of Lab4b CM used in our studies was 1.5 \u00b5g/mL; therefore, the effect of this concentration on cell viability was determined. No detrimental reduction in cell viability by Lab4b CM was seen in THP-1 macrophages, HMDM, and HASMC (Figure S1)."

In contrast to these actions, Lab4b CM significantly induced phagocytosis in THP-1 macrophages (p = 0.004; Figure 3D) and cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 3E). Scavenger receptor CD36 plays a key role in the receptor-mediated uptake of modified LDL, and Lab4b CM significantly decreased its expression in both THP-1 macrophages (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4A) and HMDM (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4B). Lab4b CM also significantly decreased the expression of two other key genes implicated in the uptake of modified LDL in THP-1 macrophages: SRA (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4C) and LPL (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4D). The effect of Lab4b CM on five key genes implicated in cholesterol efflux [ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)A1, ABCG1, liver-X-receptor (LXR)-\u03b1, LXR-\u03b2, and ApoE] were also determined in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Compared to the vehicle control, Lab4b CM significantly induced the expression of ABCA1 (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4E), ABCG1 (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4F), LXR-\u03b1 (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4G), and LXR-\u03b2 (p \u2264 0.001; Figure 4H) without affecting that of ApoE (Figure 4I).\nFigure 2.

            "text": "The benefits of probiotics have been proposed for many pathologies, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease, stroke) and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Azheimer\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson\u2019s disease) [14\u201317]. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying such beneficial actions remain poorly understood and there is also a need for large clinical trials. The Lab4b consortium of probiotics has been specifically designed to reflect the gut of new-born babies and infants [7,8]. A previous randomised control trial showed that Lab4b prevented atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and, hence, reduced the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood [8]. In addition, Lab4b CM had neuroprotective effects in vitro [9]. The effects of Lab4 CM on key atherosclerosis-associated processes are not known and were investigated here on macrophages and VSMC, two key cell types implicated in the disease. Lab4b had many beneficial effects, including attenuation of chemokine-driven monocytic migration; macropinocytosis; oxLDL uptake; and proliferation of monocytes, macrophages, and VSMC together with PDGF-induced migration of VSMC. Lab4b CM also induced phagocytosis and cholesterol efflux from foam cells. In addition, Lab4b CM decreased the expression of key genes involved in the uptake of modified LDL and induced those implicated in the efflux of cholesterol from foam cells, thereby providing potential mechanisms for the anti-foam cell actions. Our previous studies in relation to probiotics and atherosclerosis were focussed on Lab4P consortium that reduced plaque burden and content of lipids and macrophages, indicative of reduced inflammation, and increased the levels of plaque-stabilising smooth muscle cells in vivo [6]. In vitro studies used CM from Lab4 [Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL21 (NCIMB 30156) and CUL60 (NCIMB 30157), Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172] or CUL66 (Lactobacillus plantarum CUL66) [6]. The effects of Lab4b CM seen here were similar to those of Lab4 except that Lab4b, but not Lab4, attenuated the expression of the LPL gene (Figure 4D). However, more differences were seen with CUL66. Thus, in contrast to Lab4b CM and Lab4 CM, CUL66 CM had no effect on the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and LXR-\u03b1, and attenuated the expression of LXR-\u03b2 and ApoE [6]. In addition, CUL66 CM had no effect on PDGF-induced migration of smooth muscle cells [6]. These findings suggest potential strain-specific differences, and future studies should seek to delineate the effects of each bacterial species present in Lab4b or Lab4 on atherosclerosis in vitro and in vivo. Not all effects of Lab4b CM were anti-atherogenic, as it increased the TBHP-induced ROS production (Figure 2) that could potentially increase oxidation of LDL. However, the role of ROS in atherosclerosis is complex and controversial, especially as many therapeutic approaches using antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, in atherosclerosis have failed [1]. Focus has therefore shifted to modulators of oxidative stress, such as mitochondrial ROS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, or major ROS-producing enzymes, such as NADPH oxidases [18,19]. Future studies should therefore investigate the effect of Lab4b on these modulators together with oxidation of LDL in vitro and in vivo. The effect of probiotics on macrophage phagocytic activity has been investigated but the majority of these have not been in the context of atherosclerosis [20]. For example, increased phagocytosis was seen with a probiotic Lactobacillus strain and a novel strain of Bacteroides fragilis [21,22]. In the context of atherosclerosis, increased phagocytosis has been\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3639 9 of 13\nassociated with decreased oxLDL uptake and reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice [23]. Although phagocytic activity of macrophages is essential for the removal of apoptotic cells and debris from the plaques, it could potentially exert proatherogenic properties via phagocytosis of erythrocytes and platelets [24]. The significance of increased phagocytosis by Lab4b CM on foam cell formation and atherosclerosis therefore needs to be determined. The impact of Lab4b CM on cell proliferation is of importance in the context of atherogenesis. Whilst macrophage proliferation is generally considered to be more important in advanced lesion development, monocytes play an essential role, particularly in early stages of the disease [25,26]. Studies have shown an association between decreased proliferation of macrophages and suppression of atherosclerosis and accelerated atherosclerosis development with increased proliferation of monocytes and macrophages in mouse model systems [25\u201327]. Our findings correlate well with a previous study that investigated the effects of specific probiotic strains on proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, showing a significant reduction in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to the anti-proliferative agent dexamethasone [28]. In the case of VSMC, whilst normal controlled proliferation can be beneficial, dysregulated proliferation contributes to plaque formation [29]. Our results therefore suggest that Lab4b CM has the potential to exert beneficial actions on dysregulated VSMC proliferation during atherosclerosis. Lab4b CM also attenuated invasion of HASMC in vitro (Figure 6). Previous studies have shown that PDGF-BB and PDGF receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) are expressed in VSMC within atherosclerotic plaques, and their inhibition reduces their migration and proliferation and, subsequently, atherosclerotic lesion size [30\u201332]. For example, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib blocks the activity of the PDGF receptors, and diabetic ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with imatinib had reduced plaque areas that correlated with both reduced expression of PDGF-BB and phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2 [30,33]. It is possible that Lab4b CM inhibits pathological PDGF-induced invasion of VSMC via attenuation of PDGF receptor expression and/or activity, which therefore needs to be investigated. Lab4b CM showed key anti-foam cell action by attenuating the uptake of lipoproteins and stimulating the efflux of cholesterol from foam cells (Figure 3). Analysis of gene expression revealed potential mechanisms of action. Thus, Lab4b CM attenuated the expression of two key scavenger receptors, SRA and CD36 (Figure 4), which have been shown to promote atherosclerosis in vitro and in vivo [34]. In addition, Lab4b CM, but not Lab4 CM or CUL66 CM [6], attenuated the expression of the LPL gene (Figure 4). LPL can associate with lipoproteins and increase the efficiency of their uptake by macrophages [35,36]. In addition, LPL also increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 together with monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and the proliferation of VSMC [36], all pro-atherogenic events. The Lab4b CM-mediated induction of cholesterol efflux was associated with increased expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXR-\u03b1, and LXR-\u03b2 (Figure 4), suggesting increased cholesterol efflux, in part, via LXR and ABC transporter pathways [37]. LXR-\u03b1-mediated ABCA1/ABCG1-dependent macrophage cholesterol efflux has been associated with decreased lesion area and plaque lipid accumulation in mouse model systems [37,38]. In addition, it has been shown that the LXR activator TO901317 increased ABCA1/ABCG1 expression both in vitro and in vivo, thereby reducing foam cell formation in macrophages in vitro and atherosclerotic lesion area in vivo [37]. The role of ABCA1 in macrophage cholesterol efflux following LXR activation is well-established but the involvement of ABCG1 remains unclear [39]. It should be noted that changes in only mRNA expression were determined, as our previous studies have shown strong correlation between mRNA and protein expression of these genes [10,11]. However, future studies should also investigate changes in protein expression."
