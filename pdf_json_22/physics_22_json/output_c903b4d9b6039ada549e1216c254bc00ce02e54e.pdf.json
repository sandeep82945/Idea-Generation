    "abstractText": "Here we present an analysis of the evolution of Majorana corner modes realizing in a higherorder topological superconductor (HOTSC) on a square lattice under the influence of local Coulomb repulsion. The HOTSC spectral properties were considered in two regimes: when the intensities of many-body interactions are either weak or strong. The weak regime was studied using the mean-field approximation with self-consistent solutions carried out both in the uniform case and taking into account of the boundary of the finite square-shaped system. It is shown that in the uniform case the topologically nontrivial phase on the phase diagram is widened by the Coulomb repulsion. The boundary effect, resulting in an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the correlators, leads to the appearance of the crossover from the symmetric spin-independent solution to the spindependent one characterized by a spontaneously broken symmetry. In the former the corner states have energies that are determined by the overlap of the excitation wave functions localized at the different corners. In the latter the corner excitation energy is defined by the Coulomb repulsion intensity with a quadratic law. The crossover is a finite size effect, i.e. the larger the system the lesser the critical value of the Coulomb repulsion. In the strong repulsion regime we derive the effective HOTSC Hamiltonian in the atomic representation and found a rich variety of interactions induced by virtual processes between the lower and upper Hubbard subbands. It is shown that Majorana corner modes still can be realized in the limit of the infinite repulsion. Although the boundaries of the topologically nontrivial phase are strongly renormalized by Hubbard corrections.",

Zlotnikov\u00a7\nKirensky Institute of Physics, Federal Research Center KSC SB RAS, 660036 Krasnoyarsk, Russia\n(Dated: December 7, 2022)\nHere we present an analysis of the evolution of Majorana corner modes realizing in a higherorder topological superconductor (HOTSC) on a square lattice under the influence of local Coulomb repulsion. The HOTSC spectral properties were considered in two regimes: when the intensities of many-body interactions are either weak or strong. The weak regime was studied using the mean-field approximation with self-consistent solutions carried out both in the uniform case and taking into account of the boundary of the finite square-shaped system. It is shown that in the uniform case the topologically nontrivial phase on the phase diagram is widened by the Coulomb repulsion. The boundary effect, resulting in an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the correlators, leads to the appearance of the crossover from the symmetric spin-independent solution to the spindependent one characterized by a spontaneously broken symmetry. In the former the corner states have energies that are determined by the overlap of the excitation wave functions localized at the different corners. In the latter the corner excitation energy is defined by the Coulomb repulsion intensity with a quadratic law. The crossover is a finite size effect, i.e. the larger the system the lesser the critical value of the Coulomb repulsion. In the strong repulsion regime we derive the effective HOTSC Hamiltonian in the atomic representation and found a rich variety of interactions induced by virtual processes between the lower and upper Hubbard subbands. It is shown that Majorana corner modes still can be realized in the limit of the infinite repulsion. Although the boundaries of the topologically nontrivial phase are strongly renormalized by Hubbard corrections.\nPACS number(s): 71.10.Pm, 74.78.Na, 74.45.+c,\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe development of the concept of topologically nontrivial systems has led in recent years to an active study of high-order topological insulators and superconductors (HOTSCs) [1\u20133]. The spectrum of their both bulk and edge states has a gap. In turn, topologically protected gapless excitations arise, being localized at the boundaries of higher orders, i.e. at corners (corners and hinges) in 2D (3D) systems [4]. It is important to note that in case of 2D HOTSCs such states are Majorana corner modes (MCMs) which possess zero energy and obey nonAbelian exchange statistics [5, 6]. Taking into account ongoing attempts to utilize Majorana modes for the realization of quantum computations, their \u201dcorner species\u201d have a natural advantage over the Majoranas emerging in 1D systems [7\u20139]. The latter require a purely 1D system, while the finite width of the wire leads to the appearance of a gapless band of edge excitations. In this case, the zero-energy Majoranas, still detached from bulk states by a gap, are no longer separated from other edge excitations. In addition, as the 1D system is widened, the character of the excitations changes from purely Majorana to chiral [10, 11] with a change in the ratio between the length and width of the system. Moreover, the braiding procedure (the spatial\n\u2217 asv86@iph.krasn.ru \u2020 fad@iph.krasn.ru \u2021 mshustin@yandex.ru \u00a7 zlotn@iph.krasn.ru\nexchange of the Majorana modes resulting in the phase shift of the ground state wave function) can only be carried out in 2D system [12], so one need to construct 2D devices from 1D topological superconductors [13\u201315] to achieve this goal.\nThe predicted MCMs solve these problems. First, their energy lies in the gap of the spectrum of both bulk and edge excitations. Secondly, their localization strictly in the corners of the system prevents their Majorana character from changing regardless of the size ratio of the system. Additional interest in HOTSCs is caused by the possibility to move the corner excitations by varying the parameters of the system. In particular, in a number of works a magnetic field is used to create HOTSC [16\u201319]. It plays the role of a perturbation destroying the symmetry that underlies the first-order topological system. In some cases, the MCM position can be controlled using the direction of this magnetic field [20, 21]. A model including triangular HOTSC segments has also recently been proposed demonstrating the possibility of braiding using only electric fields [22]. Thus, the MCMs in 2D systems seem to be good candidates for braiding, which is one of the key requirements for creating a topological qubit. Another possible practical application of such systems that deserves attention is conventional nanoscale devices with controlled transport characteristics.\nDespite the active study of HOTSCs, there are still many unresolved issues. First, the influence of Coulomb correlations on the conditions of the topological phase transition and MCMs properties remains poorly understood. There are works in which superconducting pairing, which generates the corner states, is calculated self-\n2 consistently, taking into account the Coulomb interaction in the system [23\u201325]. However, many of the previously proposed models imply the introduction of superconducting pairing due to the proximity effect. The question of how the obtained results would change if there are Coulomb correlations in the system itself is not fully resolved yet. At the same time, it is known that taking the local repulsion into account can significantly affect the properties of conventional topological superconductors [26\u201329]. In the case of higher-order topological insulators, the many-body interactions can lead both to the appearance of new topological classes [30, 31] and, conversely, to the destruction of topological states in 3D systems [32]. Secondly, while higher-order 2D topological phases have already been experimentally demonstrated in photonic, acoustic and topoelectric systems [33\u201336], their solid-state counterparts have not been realized yet. Moreover, bismuth is the only material confirmed to provide the higher-order topology [37, 38], although some uncertainty still remains [39]. Other HOTI and HOTSC candidates are transition-metal dichalcogenides [40\u201342] and rocksalt IV\u2013VI semiconductors XY (X = Ge, Sn, Pb and Y = S, Se, Te) [43, 44], but their higher-order topology has not been confirmed experimentally yet. Remarkably, it has been already found out that spectral and transport properties of some of these 2D topological insulators can significantly depend on electron-electron interactions [45\u201347]. Thus, the problem of the local Coulomb (Hubbard-type) repulsion in 2D solid-state HOTSC is of fundamental nature and its solution will make it possible to better estimate the prospects for the experimental detection of the MCMs. The present article is devoted to the study of the Hubbard interaction problem in a typical HOTSC model. We analyze both limits of weak and strong repulsion. Based on this, the rest of article is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe a HOTSC Hamiltonian. The effect of weak intraorbital Coulomb repulsion on the MCMs is discussed in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we analyze an effective Hamiltonian of strongly-correlated HOTSC and its topological features. We conclude in Sec. V with a summary. In Appendix A the conditions of the HOTSC phase realization are obtained employing an effective mass criterion. We discuss the derivation of an effective Hamiltonian in the regime of the strong finite Hubbard interaction in Appendix B. Appendix C deals with a Green functions approach in the U \u2192 \u221e limit."

            "text": "One of the criteria used to describe the higher-order topological phase transition is a so-called change of effective mass sign. It\u2019s known that the MCMs arise if two initially gapless topological states propagating along the adjacent edges acquire an effective mass of the opposite sign due to an interaction that breaks one of the symme-\ntries responsible for the first-order nontrivial topology. In this situation the corner can be treated as a domain wall or, in other words, as a topological defect. Below we describe one of the popular 2D models possessing this feature and used to study physics of the MCMs on a square lattice. In order to obtain the gap in the edge spectrum induced by some interaction it is necessary to initially prepare two subsystems with inverted bands. One of the proper candidates is a bipartite square lattice with an interorbital Rashba spin-orbit coupling where an extended s(d)-wave intraorbital pairing plays a role of the interaction [48].

The intraorbital nearest-neighbor tx,y as well as next-nearestneighbor t1 hopping parameters are of opposite signs for different orbitals leading to the inverted bands. The parameter \u03b1 defines an intensity of the interorbital Rashba spin-orbit coupling; efm is a unit vector pointing along the direction of electron motion from the mth to fth site. The parameters \u22060,x,y are intensities of the intraorbital on-site and intersite singlet pairing that results in overall s\u00b1-wave superconductivity in the case \u2206x = \u2206y or s + dx2\u2212y2-wave superconductivity in the case of \u2206x = \u2212\u2206y.

In this situation the correlators included in (4) supposed to be independent of the site number and the impact of the boundary on them is neglected. The correlators are calculated self-consistently under the periodic boundary conditions.\nThe numerical investigation shows that the influence of the intraorbital Coulomb interaction in such a case reduces to corrections of the on-site energies and corresponding singlet superconducting coupling. The former implies the modification of \u2206\u03b5 \u2192 \u2206\u0303\u03b5 parameter and the shift of both bands, which do not affect the topological properties of the system. The second correction is a well known suppression of the on-site superconducting coupling \u22060 \u2192 \u2206\u03030. Thus the topological properties of the system remain qualitatively the same up to the modification of \u2206\u03b5 and \u22060 parameters. Quantitatively, the change of \u2206\u03b5 is small and its effect on the topological phase diagram is insignificant compared with the \u22060 correction. As the on-site singlet coupling suppresses the higher-order topological phase (see [48] for qualitative explanation and Appendix A for mathematical details), its reduction with the U increase stabilizes the nontrivial phase and widens the corresponding region on the topological diagram (Fig. 1).\n4"

            "text": "Now we proceed with the case of square-shaped HOTSC with open boundary conditions. In such situation the correlators (5) become dependent on the site index leading to the inability of topological phase analysis. Meanwhile, the properties of the corner excitations still can be investigated. We carried out series of self-consistent calculations for different parameters of the model. The typical dependence of the first excitation energy on the intensity of the intraorbital Hubbard repulsion, \u03b51 (U), for different sizes of the system is plotted in Figure 2. The numerical calculations revealed the presence of crossover between two qualitatively different cases. For U < Uc the corner excitations remain almost unperturbed by the Coulomb repulsion with their energies being determined by the overlapping of excitations in different corners of the finite-size system. For U > Uc the energies depend quadratically on U . Note that there is still a considerable gap in the spectrum of the open system between the corner states (En=1\u22124) and the rest of the excitations even at U = tx/2 (see the inset of Fig. 2a).\nTo understand the qualitative difference between the solutions before and after the crossover, it is necessary to analyze the correlators (5). Since time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the bare HamiltonianH0 the self-consisted calculation at U 6= 0 does not generate the nonzero normal spin-flip averages, \u3008c+f\u03b7\u03c3cf\u03b7\u03c3\u0304\u3009 = 0. Then, the blockdiagonal structure of the system Bogolyubov-de-Gennes\nHamiltonian in the basis [ cfA\u03c3, cfB\u03c3\u0304, c + fA\u03c3\u0304, c + fB\u03c3 ] remains. Taking it into account, it is convenient to consider\nthe corresponding sums of the on-site concentration averages, \u3008nfA\u03c3\u3009+\u3008nfB\u03c3\u0304\u3009, as they describe possible spatial fluctuations relative to the quarter filling, which are induced by the Hubbard repulsion. The dependencies \u3008nfA\u03c3\u3009+ \u3008nfB\u03c3\u0304\u3009 at U < Uc are displayed in Figs. 3a and 3b. One can note that in both halfspaces C4 symmetry persists. Additionally, the separate distributions \u3008nfA\u03c3\u3009 and \u3008nfB\u03c3\u0304\u3009 as well as the anomalous correlators possess just slight quantitative changes in comparison with the U = 0 case. Thus, the effect of the Coulomb interaction is negligible in the case of U < Uc. On the contrary, it follows from Figs. 3c,d that at U > Uc the C4 symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. Along with that the occupation of the sites becomes unequal for the different spin projections. The plots emphasize the essential role of the corners in this effect. It can be concluded with good accuracy that the average concentration deviates from unity only at these sites. Because of the Coulomb repulsion, the two distributions, \u3008nfA\u2191\u3009 + \u3008nfB\u2193\u3009 and \u3008nfA\u2193\u3009 + \u3008nfB\u2191\u3009, are the mirror images of each other. Interestingly, the anomalous correlators acquire an imaginary component which makes the main contribution again in the corners. The crossover appears due to the competition between the Coulomb repulsion contribution to the ground-state energy and the contribution due to the overlapping of the excitations localized in the different corners. Thus, the Uc value is dependent on the system size (for N = 20 the curve break in Fig. 2 emerges already at Uc \u2248 0.04) and becomes zero at the N \u2192 \u221e limit. The obtained results were proved by means of the ground-state energy analysis,\nEgr = \u2212 \u2211\nf\u03b7n\u03c3\n|vf\u03b7n\u03c3|2\u03b5n \u2212 (6)\n\u2212 U \u2211\nf\u03b7\u03c3\n[ \u3008nf\u03b7\u2191\u3009\u3008nf\u03b7\u2193\u3009+ |\u3008c+f\u03b7\u2191c+f\u03b7\u2193\u3009|2 ] .\nIt was done for the fully-symmetric case, when the normal correlators are spin-independent and coincide in all corners, and for a set of the spin-asymmetric realizations. The last includes the situations when the same-spin normal correlators are equal in the two opposite corners of the square diagonal, in the two corners on the same square side, in the three and four corners. The minimum energy corresponds to the fully-symmetric solution for U < Uc and the C2-symmetric case with the same correlators in the opposite corners of the square diagonal for U > Uc."

            "text": "Having discussed the limit of the weak Coulomb interaction, let us consider the properties of corner modes in\n5\nthe strong correlation regime. In this case, the HartreeFock approximation (4) becomes invalid and it is necessary to use the methods of the theory of strongly correlated systems. First of all, we note that strong electron correlations induce effective interactions in low-energy Hamiltonian. Recently the effective interactions have been studied in interacting topological insulators [49] and first-order topological superconductors [50]. To analyze the structure of effective interactions of the system (1), it is convenient to use the method of unitary transformations in many-body Hilbert space [51] together with the atomic representation [52, 53]. This approach is described in Appendix B. Since the natural language of the atomic representation is based on the use of Hubbard operators, Xpqf\u03b7, we introduce two-component field operators, Hubbard spinors, built on such operators,\n\u03a8f\u03b7 = ( X0\u2191f\u03b7 X0\u2193f\u03b7 ) = P ( cf\u03b7\u2191 cf\u03b7\u2193 ) P \u2212 P ( nf\u03b7\u2193 nf\u03b7\u2191 ) P, (7)\nwhere the Hubbard operators, Xpqf\u03b7, and the projection operator, P , are defined in (B2). We will associate the operators X0\u03c3f\u03b7 constituting these spinors with so-called Hubbard fermions. It can be seen from Eq. (7) that in\nactual Hilbert space the Hubbard fermions are a superposition of the ordinary fermions, cf\u03b7\u03c3, and charge population operators nf\u03b7\u03c3\u0304. As a result, the commutation relations for the Hubbard fermions differ from the ones for the ordinary fermions, which is the reason for the appearance of the kinematic interaction [54, 55]. Another consequence of unusual operator algebra is the emergence of effective charge and magnetic interactions for itinerant electrons. So, using the Eq.(B10) it can be checked that\n\u03a8+f\u03b7 \u03a8f\u03bd = \u03b4\u03b7\u03bd nf\u03b7 , \u03a8 + f\u03b7 ~\u03c4 \u03a8f\u03bd = 2\u03b4\u03b7\u03bd ~Sf\u03b7. (8)\nwhere ~\u03c4 is a vector consisting of the Pauli matrices acting in the spin space of the Hubbard fermions, nf\u03b7 and ~Sf\u03b7 are the charge and spin operators defined at the site f and orbital \u03b7, respectively. In terms of the spinors (7), the low-energy Hamiltonian obtained in the second-order perturbation theory (with 1/U as an expansion parameter) can be represented in the form (9). If f 6= g 6= l the terms in lines 3-8 of (9) correspond to three-center interactions. Their physical meaning consists in the hopping and anomalous pairing of Hubbard fermions at the fth and gth sites with a contact interaction at the lth site. In the lines 3, 4, and 5 of (9) such interactions have the Coulomb, Heisenberg,\n6 and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya character, respectively. These couplings possess an amplitude \u223c 1/U and can be realized both between the same orbitals (which is denoted by a factor \u03b4\u03b7\u03bd) and between different orbitals (see a factor \u03b4\u03b7\u0304\u03bd). In the line 6 of (9) the three-center interaction has an order \u223c \u03b12/U and is related to the anisotropic hopping of Hubbard fermions. Similarly, the effective interactions with magnitudes \u223c \u03b1\u22061 /U , written in the lines 7-8, describe the anisotropic interaction of Cooper pairs of the Hubbard fermions with the spin moments of the electrons at the site l. The anisotropy is due to the chirality of the spin-orbit interaction in Eq.

(9)\nIt is important to note, that if f = g the three-center terms reduce to the two-center charge and spin interactions between the electrons, according to Eq. (8). So, the two-center summands in the third line of Eq.(9) describe the intersite Coulomb repulsion \u223c nf\u03b7ng\u03bd of the electrons inside the same orbitals which is formed by the competition of attractive and repulsive interactions with amplitudes \u223c t2/U and \u223c \u22062/U , respectively. Similarly, the symmetric Heisenberg interaction \u223c ~Sf\u03b7 \u00b7 ~Sg\u03bd is realized inside the orbitals and has an antiferromagnetic character with an amplitude \u223c t2/U . Note that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms \u223c ~Sf\u03b7 \u00d7 ~Sg\u03bd as well as the anisotropic two-center interactions do not appear, since the spin-orbit interaction acts only between the different orbitals in the original model (1). The discussed interactions can lead to the implementation of charge and spin\norderings, which, in turn, should be taken into account when calculating the matrix elements of the three-center interactions. Thus, the Hubbard fermions move in the charge and magnetic background. The two-center terms given in the second curly brackets of Eq.(9) describe the hopping, spin-orbit interaction and anomalous pairings between the nearest neighbors in the ensemble of the Hubbard fermions. It can be seen that the interorbital spin-orbit interaction induces a pwave superconducting pairing between the neighboring orbitals, similar to what occurs in Majorana nanowires. The results presented show that the search for the Majorana corner modes in the regime of strong but finite U requires to study of spectral properties of the system taking into account the magnetic ordering, intersite repulsion, p-wave anomalous pairing, anisotropic hoppings as well as the three-center and kinematic interactions. Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work. Meanwhile, it is clear that in the limit U \u2192 \u221e one can consider only the influence of the kinematic interaction on the MCM implementation conditions."

As before t\u00b1x = \u2212t\u00b1y = t, \u03b1\u03c3,\u00b1x = \u2213\u03b1\u03c3, \u03b1\u03c3,\u00b1y = \u00b1i\u03b1. Obviously, in the U \u2192 \u221e limit the on-site singlet pairing is fully suppressed by the local Coulomb repulsion. Therefore, the parameter \u22060 does not appear in the Hamiltonian (10) and the topological phase transition to the trivial phase shown in Fig. 1 becomes inaccessible. Using the formalism of the Zubarev\u2019s Green functions (see Appendix C ) the topological phase diagram is considered in the limit of U \u2192 \u221e within the Hubbard-I approximation. Firstly, we are focused on the boundaries of nodal phases (N phases) in which the gapless excitations exist in the bulk spectrum due to the s\u00b1 symmetry of the superconducting pairings. To find the N phases the periodic boundary conditions have to be applied with\nthe uniform correlators determining Hubbard renormalizations.\nIn general, the gapless excitations appear when the Fermi contour intersects the nodal lines of the superconducting order parameter. Since the on-site superconducting pairings are suppressed in the limit of U \u2192 \u221e, the nodal lines are determined by simple relations: kcy = \u00b1(\u03c0\u2212 |kcx|). Therefore, to describe the nodal phases we found the conditions when the zeros on the nodal lines in the bulk energy spectrum of topological insulator (TI) appear.\nThe bottom of the first TI band \u03b51k and the top of the second TI band \u03b52k (see Appendix C) are realized at the nodal points kcx = 0, kcy = \u00b1\u03c0. Then, the condition\n\u00b5L1 = \u2212\u2206\u03b5\u2212 4tHB (11)\nis the lower boundary of the nodal phase corresponding to the filling of \u03b51k (the N1 phase), while\n\u00b5U2 = \u2206\u03b5+ 4tHA (12)\nis the upper boundary of the nodal phase corresponding to the filling of \u03b52k (the N2 phase). Here H\u03b7 = 1 \u2212 n\u03b7/2 is the Hubbard renormalization, n\u03b7 = \u2211 \u03c3 \u2329 X\u03c3\u03c3f\u03b7 \u232a is the average electron concentration at the \u03b7th orbital (it does not depend on the site index since the periodic boundary conditions are considered), \u03b7 = A,B. The concentrations of the Hubbard fermions with the different spins are equal. We note that in the limit of U \u2192 \u221e the electron concentration on each orbital can not exceed 1.\nThe upper boundary of the N1 phase and the lower boundary of the N2 phase are described by the expres-\nsions\n\u00b5U1,L2 = \u2212 t2\u2206\u03b5\n( H2A \u2212H2B )\n2 [ t2 (HA +HB) 2 /2\u2212HAHB\u03b12 ] \u00b1\n\u2213 { 8H2AH 2 B\u03b1\n2(2t2 \u2212 \u03b12)\u2212HAHB\u2206\u03b52\u03b12 t2 (HA +HB) 2 /2\u2212HAHB\u03b12\n+ HAHB (HA \u2212HB)2 \u2206\u03b52\u03b12t2\n2 [ t2 (HA +HB) 2 /2\u2212HAHB\u03b12 ]\n   1/2 ,(13)\nwhen the Fermi contour intersects the points on the nodal lines determined by\ncos(kcx) = \u2212 t [\u00b5 (HA \u2212HB) + \u2206\u03b5 (HA +HB)]\n4HAHB (2t2 \u2212 \u03b12) > \u22121,\nkcy = \u00b1(\u03c0 \u2212 |kcx|). (14) When cos(kcx) < \u22121 upon changing the parameters, the\nupper boundary of the N1 phase corresponding to the top of \u03b51k and the lower boundary of the N2 phase corresponding to the bottom of \u03b52k are implemented at the points kcx = \u00b1\u03c0, kcy = 0. Then, the conditions for the chemical potential read\n\u00b5U1 = \u2206\u03b5\u2212 4tHA, (15) \u00b5L2 = \u2212\u2206\u03b5+ 4tHB. (16)\nIn the obtained expressions (11 \u2212 16) for the boundaries of the nodal phases the average electron concentrations n\u03b7 included in the renormalization parameters H\u03b7 must be calculated self-consistently. The self-consistent equations and expressions for the bulk energy spectrum of HOTSC are provided in Appendix C. Note that the boundaries of the N phases in U = 0 case can be found from these expressions neglecting the Hubbard renormalizations, HA = HB = 1. In Figures 4a and 4b we present the topological phase diagrams in the variables \u2206\u03b5 and electron concentration ne = nA + nB for the limit of U \u2192 \u221e and for the U = 0 case, respectively. The parameters t = 1, \u03b1 = 3/4, \u22061 = 0.5, t1 = 0 are used. For clarity, we put \u22060 = 0 in the U = 0 case. The red solid lines are determined by Eqs. (11) and (12) for the N1 and N2 nodal phases, respectively. The blue lines are determined by Eqs. (13) and (15-16) depending on the parameter range. The dots on these lines denote when cos(kcx) = \u22121 in (14) and the equations for the phase boundaries are changed from (13) to (15-16) with the increase of \u2206\u03b5. The notations for the different phases on the topological phase diagrams are the same as in Ref. [48]. As mentioned above, inside the N1 and N2 phases the bulk energy spectrum is gapless in the presence of the superconducting pairings and there are not edge or corner\nstates. The phases with the gapped bulk energy spectrum are 0 and 1 phases distinguished by topology. The topologically protected edge and corners states are absent in the topologically trivial 0 phase. The Majorana corner modes are formed in the topologically nontrivial 1 phase. In this phase the edge excitation spectra along (10) or (01) edges are gapped excepting the parameters shown by the dotted lines. As it was shown in Ref. [48] for U = 0 and \u22060 = 0 the topological phase transition does not occur at this line. In the U \u2192 \u221e limit we have the same result, since the on-site pairings are destroyed by the Coulomb interaction.\nTo compare the limits of U \u2192 \u221e and U = 0 in Fig. 4b the half of the topological phase diagram at U = 0 is shown. The whole phase diagram is determined on the range ne = [0 \u2212 4] and it is symmetric relative to ne = 2. It is seen from Fig. 4 that all phases preserve in the U \u2192 \u221e limit within the Hubbard-I approximation. At the same time, the phases are shifted to the lower concentrations and are compressed due to the Hubbard renormalizations. In Sections III B and III C the doping level near the half-filling ne = 2 at U = 0 is considered. It is seen in Fig. 4a that this region becomes topologically trivial if U \u2192 \u221e. To check the topologically nontrivial 1 phase the excitation spectrum \u03b5j of the 2D lattice with open boundary conditions and the MCMs spatial distribution are calculated using the Green functions. The difference of the Hubbard renormalization factors at the different lattice sites is neglected and the bulk uniform values for them are used. The MCM formation deeply inside the 1 phase is displayed in Fig. 5. The lattice contains N = 50 sites along the x and y directions. In Fig. 6a the dependencies of the lowest excitation energies \u03b5j on the chemical\n9 potential at \u2206\u03b5 = 1 in the 1 phase are presented. The chemical potential runs from the left boundary of the 1 phase to the right boundary. The other parameters remain the same. Since the scales of the energies \u03b51,2 and \u03b53 are different, we employ the different y-axes for them (the left y-axis is for \u03b51,2, the right y-axis is for \u03b53). For the chemical potentials denoted by the vertical dotted lines the edge excitation spectrum is gapless. It is seen that two zero excitation energies \u03b51,2 corresponding to the MCM formation are realized in a wide range of the chemical potential excepting the regions near the vertical dotted lines. In Fig. 6b the results for U = 0 are shown. Comparing the dependencies of \u03b53 in both cases, we conclude that the energy gap between the MCMs and higher states is slightly decreased in the U \u2192 \u221e regime."

            "text": "The effect of the on-site Coulomb interaction on the HOTSC was investigated on the example of the topological insulator with enhanced s(d)-wave superconducting coupling in two regimes: weak and strong Coulomb repulsion. Using the mean-field approximation in the weak regime it was shown that the on-site intraorbital Coulomb interaction manifests itself only in modification of the on-site energy shift and suppression of the on-site singlet superconducting coupling. In the uniform case it leads to the widening of the higher-order topological phase. When the self-consistent solution takes into account the boundary of the finite size system the conventional topological analysis becomes invalid since, in this case, the correlators are site-dependent leading to the inhomogeneous picture. Meanwhile the corner excitations survive in this case. The crossover between two different situations was found. If the amplitude of the Coulomb repulsion is less than the critical value, the corner excitation energies are determined by the hybridization effects due to the finite size of the system. The electron densities for different spin projections are equal and C4-symmetric in this case. If the Coulomb repulsion is stronger then the critical value, the spontaneous symmetry breaking emerges in the system and the corner excitation energy depends quadratically on U . The electron densities for different spin projections are C2 symmetric with the difference taking place in the corners of the system. This crossover is a finite-size effect appearing at the lesser U for the larger system size N . The effective interactions in the strongly correlated HOTSC are derived in the framework of the second-order operator-form perturbation theory. The appearance of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange interactions, anisotropic interactions, as well as triplet pairings are demonstrated. It is shown that the topologically nontrivial phase in the vicinity of on-site electron concentration ne = 2 (half-filling case at U = 0) becomes trivial one in the strongly correlated regime. On the other hand,\nin this regime the lower Hubbard subbands for both orbitals behave qualitatively similar to the initial bands without the Coulomb interaction. Therefore, the topological phase can be realized even at U \u2192 \u221e. At the same time, the topological region on the phase diagram in variables electron concentration \u2014 orbital splitting, as well as the energy gap for the corner states are reduced due to the Hubbard renormalizations."

            "text": "To analyze the conditions of the HOTI/HOTSC phase realization it is useful to employ an effective mass criterion. It can be introduced if the system possesses topological edge states, which are gapped under the influence of some perturbations [2, 16, 18, 21, 22, 48, 56\u201358]. In such case the HOTSC phase appears when the effective Dirac mass of the edge excitations is of a different sign for two adjacent edges. To use the effective mass sign criterion in our case one needs to find the edge eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (1) in the absence of the superconducting coupling with one open boundary. Let us consider the boundary along the x direction. The edge-state wave function in such case can be written in the form\n\u03a8ep\u03c3 = 1\u221a 2N\n[ 1\n\u2212i \u00b7 sign(\u03b1tp)\n] \u00b7 (xn1 \u2212 xn2 ) , (A1)\nx1,2 = \u2212 \u03bep \u00b1\n\u221a \u03be2p \u2212 4(t2p \u2212 \u03b12)\n2 sign(tp)(|tp|+ |\u03b1|) ,\n\u03bep = \u2206\u03b5+ 2tx cos p, tp = ty + 2t1 cos p, N = \u221e\u2211\nn=1\n|xn1 \u2212 xn2 |2 ,\nwith edge band energy spectrum\n\u03b5p = 2|\u03b1| sign(tp) \u00b7 \u03c3 sin p. (A2) Here the basis [cpA\u03c3, cpB\u03c3]\nT is used, p = kx is quasimomentum along the boundary, an index n numerates the sites in y direction. The values x1,2 can be both real or complex (in the last case x2 = x \u2217 1), along with |x1,2| < 1 corresponding to the solution, which descends along y direction inside the system.\nThe hole-like counterpart of (A1) in the [c\u2020pA\u03c3, c \u2020 pB\u03c3] T\nbasis has the form\n\u03a8hp\u03c3 = 1\u221a 2N\n[ 1\ni \u00b7 sign(\u03b1tp)\n] \u00b7 (xn1 \u2212 xn2 ) , (A3)\n\u03b5p = \u2212 sign(\u03b1tp) \u00b7 \u03c3\u03b1p.\n10\nReferring to (A1),(A3) as electron and hole wavefunctions and projecting the whole Hamiltonian (1) on these lowest-energy solutions, one will obtain the next form\nHpr = [ \u03b5p \u2212 \u00b5 V \u2217p Vp \u2212\u03b5p + \u00b5 ] , (A4)\nVp = \u03c3  \u2206p \u2212 2\u2206y \u03bep sign(tp)\n2 \u221a t2p \u2212 \u03b12\n  ,\n\u2206p = \u22060 + 2\u2206x cos p.\nThe excitation spectrum of Hamiltonian (A4) is Diraclike,\n\u03b5 = \u221a (\u03b5p \u2212 \u00b5)2 + |Vp|2, (A5)\naround the Dirac point defined by equation\nsign(tp) sin p = \u00b5/2\u03b1, (A6)\nand Vp playing a role of the effective Dirac mass. The wave functions of the edge states on the y boundary with p = \u2212ky has form\n\u03a8ep\u03c3 = 1\u221a 2N\n[ 1\n\u03c3 sign(\u03b1tp)\n] \u00b7 (xn1 \u2212 xn2 ) , (A7)\n\u03a8hp\u03c3 = 1\u221a 2N\n[ 1\n\u2212\u03c3 sign(\u03b1tp)\n] \u00b7 (xn1 \u2212 xn2 ) ,\nwith all other expressions including Vp to be the same up to the x \u2194 y exchange. The HOTSC phase appears in the case of Vp having different signs for x and y boundaries at the corresponding Dirac points. Supposing the system with hopping amplitudes and intersite superconducting coupling to differ only in signs tx = \u03baty, \u2206x = \u03c7\u2206y (\u03ba, \u03c7 = \u00b11) one will easily find the requirement \u03ba\u03c7 = \u22121 for the HOTSC phase, which coincides with the conclusions made in [48] (tx = \u2212ty for the extended s-wave superconducting coupling and dx2\u2212y2 - wave for tx = ty). In the case of \u2206\u03b5 < |tx,y|, |tx,y| = 2|t1| (the situation considered in [48]), the HOTSC phase is defined by the condition\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u22060 2\u22061 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223  1 + 1\u221a (1 + | cos p|)2 \u2212 ( \u03b1 tx )2   \u00b7 | cos p| (A8)\n+ \u2206\u03b5 \u00b7 sign(txty)\n2|tx| \u221a (1 + | cos p|)2 \u2212 ( \u03b1 tx )2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , | cos p| = \u221a 1\u2212 ( \u00b5 2\u03b1 )2 .\nThe obtained expression can describe HOTSC phase only in the case of |\u00b5| < 2\u03b1 as it is based on the perturbed edge states conception and, consequently, the chemical potential should be inside the edge states band (A2)."

As a basis in the Hilbert space of the operator H it is convenient to choose many-body eigenstates |m \u3009 of the Hamiltonian H0: H0|m \u3009 = Em|m \u3009. An important assumption for the development of the perturbation theory is the existence of a large energy gap in the spectrum of the eigenvalues Em. If we consider the system in the regime of the strong electron correlations,\nU \u226b tfg, \u2206fg, \u03b1, the energy gap occurs due to the presence of the strong Hubbard repulsion. Then, the subspace of the states, M, with the eigenvalues below the gap (so-called \u201dlowenergy\u201d sector) include the ones without the doubly occupied orbitals at each site, i.e.\nM = {|m \u3009 : \u2200f, \u03b7 nf\u03b7|m \u3009 6= 2 |m \u3009}; nf\u03b7 = nf\u03b7\u2191+nf\u03b7\u2193. The \u201dhigh-energy\u201d sector L is formed by states |l\u3009 for which at least one orbital have two electrons. Using the many-body states |m\u3009 we can define a projection operator P onto the low-energy sector M as:\nP = \u220f\nf\n\u2211\n\u03b7=A,B\n( X00f\u03b7 +X \u2191\u2191 f\u03b7 +X \u2193\u2193 f\u03b7 ) , (B2)\nwith Xpqf\u03b7 = |f \u03b7 p\u3009\u3008f \u03b7 q| being the Hubbard operators describing transitions from the many-body state |f \u03b7 p\u3009 to the state |f \u03b7 q\u3009 at the site f and orbital \u03b7 = A,B, with quantum numbers p and q, respectively. In our case the basis of states at the site f and orbital \u03b7 includes |f \u03b7 0\u3009, |f \u03b7 \u03c3\u3009 and |f \u03b7 2\u3009 corresponding to the states without electrons, with one electron that has the spin \u03c3 and with two electrons, respectively. The electron annihilation operator at the site f and orbital \u03b7 with spin projection \u03c3 can be expressed in terms of the Hubbard operators:\ncf\u03b7\u03c3 = X 0\u03c3 f\u03b7 + \u03c3X \u03c3\u03042 f\u03b7 . (B3)\n11\nThe projection operator (B2) allows to divide the interactions into two parts: V = V\u0304 + V\u0304, where V\u0304 = (1\u2212 P )V P + P V (1\u2212 P ), (B4)\nis non-diagonal, since it does mix the sectors M and L. To derive the desired effective Hamiltonian of the strongly correlated HOTSC model, one can consider the following unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian H :\nH \u2192 H\u0303 = e\u2212S H eS = H+[H,S ]+1 2\n[ [H, S ], S ] +. . .\n(B5)\nIt is assumed that the operator S in the formula (B5) is non-diagonal and has the first order of smallness. Next, it is necessary to substitute the expression (B1) into the series (B5) and retain only those terms whose order of smallness is not higher than two. In the obtained expression for H\u0303 we want to get rid of the non-diagonal terms by imposing the following condition on the operators S:\nV\u0304 + [H0 , S ] = 0. (B6) As a result, only the diagonal terms remain in the Hamiltonian H\u0303 up to the second order. Projecting out the high-energy processes in the last, we are left with operators acting exclusively within the low-energy sector M and, thus, forming the required effective Hamiltonian,\nHeff = P H P + 1 2 P [ V\u0304 , S ] P + h.c. (B7)\nIt is easily to verify that S can be represented in the operator form\nS = \u2212 (H0 \u2212KH0K)\u22121 (1 \u2212 P )V P \u2212 h.c., (B8) where K is the Hermitian conjugation operator. Then, substituting the expression (B8) into the formula (B7), we obtain the final expression for the effective Hamiltonian acting in the low-energy subspace M:\nHeff = P HP\u2212 1\n2\n( P V\u0304 (H0 \u2212KH0K)\u22121 V\u0304 P + h.c. )\n(B9)\nIn order to find the explicit microscopic expression for Heff it is convenient to perform calculations representing V\u0304 in terms of Hubbard operators,\nV\u0304 = \u2211\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\u03b7 fg( tfg\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\u03b7\u03c3X \u03c30 f\u03b7X \u03c3\u03042 g\u03b7 + i\u03b1 (~\u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u00d7 ~efg)\u03c3\u2032X\u03c30f\u03b7X \u03c3\u0304 \u2032 2 g\u03b7\u0304 +\n+ \u2206fg 2\n\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ( X2\u03c3f\u03b7X \u03c30 g\u03b7 \u2212X\u03c30f\u03b7X2\u03c3g\u03b7 + \u03c3X2\u03c3f\u03b7X2\u03c3\u0304g\u03b7 ) + h.c. ) +\n+\u22060 \u2211\nf\u03b7\n( X02f\u03b7 +X 20 f\u03b7 ) ,\nand taking into account the relations [53]\nXpqf\u03b7X rs f\u03bd = \u03b4\u03b7\u03bdX pr f\u03b7,\nX\u03c3\u03c3f\u03b7 = nf\u03b7 + 2\u03c3 S z f\u03b7 , X \u03c3\u03c3\u0304 f\u03b7 = 2 ( Sxf\u03b7 + i\u03c3 S y f\u03b7 ) .
