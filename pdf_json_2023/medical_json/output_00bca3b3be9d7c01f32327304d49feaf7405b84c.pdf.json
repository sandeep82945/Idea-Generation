Ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors may inhibit bile acid absorption in the distal ileum and increase bile acid levels in the colon, potentially decreasing serum and hepatic bile acids. This study investigated the impact of these factors on tumors.\nMethods C57BL/6J mice received a one-time intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg of diethylnitrosamine. They were fed a choline-de cient high-fat diet for 20 weeks starting from 8 weeks of age, with or without elobixibat (EA Pharma, Tokyo, Japan).\nResults Both groups showed liver fat accumulation and brosis, with no signi cant differences between the two groups. However, mice treated with elobixibat showed fewer liver tumors. The total serum bile acid levels, including free-/tauro-/gly- conjugated bile acids and tauro-\u03b1/\u03b2-muricholic acids in the liver, were noticeably reduced with elobixibat. The proportion of gram-positive bacteria in feces was signi cantly lower in the group treated with elobixibat (5.4%) than in the group without elobixibat (33.7%).\nConclusion Elobixibat suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting bile acid reabsorption and decreasing total bile acid and primary bile acid levels in the serum and liver. Additionally, the presence of bile acids in the colon may have led to a signi cant reduction in the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, potentially resulting in decreased secondary bile acid synthesis.\nIntroduction Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its associated liver cancer are increasing worldwide and are pressing issues that must be addressed. Recent research has revealed that the cause of NASH and its resulting tumors is a multifactorial condition in uenced by aberrant lipid metabolism, gut microbiome, bile acids, and oxidative stress.\nBile acids play a role in developing metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [1]. Primary bile acids are synthesized in the liver and secreted into the duodenum, where they are metabolized into secondary bile acids through gut microbiome metabolism,\nPage 4/22\nincluding conjugation and dehydroxylation. In the terminal ileum, 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed into the liver through the portal vein via the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) [2]. This process is known as enterohepatic circulation. Previous studies have reported that mice fed a high-fat diet showed signi cantly increased levels of secondary bile acid [3]. High levels of bile acids have been reported to contribute to liver tumors [4].\nBile acids also affect the gut microbiome. Historically, bile acid salts have been used to regulate the growth of gram-positive bacteria by adjusting their concentration. The connection between bile acid concentration and the microbiome is recognized as having a crucial role in the gut-liver axis [5]. This could affect conditions such as NASH and liver tumors [6]. Several studies have reported decreased tumor incidence in NASH tumor models by reducing gram-positive bacteria through vancomycin treatment.\nIn 2018, elobixibat (A3309), a selective inhibitor of the IBAT, was approved for treating functional chronic constipation. Elobixibat reduces bile acid reabsorption from the terminal ileum, resulting in increased bile acid excretion in stool and higher bile acid concentration in the colon, which enhances the secretion of water and electrolytes into the colon, improves intestinal motility, and eases colonic transit [7].\nThe choline-de cient high-fat (CDHF) diet + diethylnitrosamine (DEN) carcinogenesis model was used to evaluate the impact of elobixibat on serum bile acids, liver tumors, and the microbiome [8]. This study analyzed the effects of elobixibat administration on these factors.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals and study design Three-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups (Fig.\u00a01a): (1) CDHF diet + DEN (control group) and (2) CDHF diet + DEN + elobixibat (elobixibat group). The mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg DEN. They were then given a standard diet until they reached 8 weeks old. For the next 20 weeks, mice in the control group were fed a CDHF diet (60 kcal% fat, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), while mice in the elobixibat group were fed a CDHF diet mixed with elobixibat (EA Pharma., Tokyo, Japan). The animals were housed in a controlled environment (temperature 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, humidity 50 \u00b1 10%, 12-h light/dark cycle) at the animal facility with unlimited access to food and water. The Animal Care and Research and Development Committees of the Division of Experimental Animals at Nagoya University approved all experiments.\nDose setting for elobixibat Elobixibat was calculated to be 0.27 mg/kg/day. This study used a mean body weight of 23 g per animal based on previously published data. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of human IBAT is 0.53 nmol/L, and that of mouse IBAT is 0.13 nmol/L. Therefore, the inhibitory activity is four times higher in mice than in humans. The concentration of elobixibat in mice at 70% effective dose is 2.7 mg/kg, and at\nPage 5/22\n50% effective dose is 0.27(70%\u00d7[0.023/60])0.33=2.23 mg/kg, which would be 110 mg/day for a 50 kg human, 11 times the amount normally used. We, therefore, set our effective capacity at 50%: 0.27(50%)\u00d7 [0.023/60])0.33 0.223 mg/kg. A CDHF + elobixibat diet containing 3 mg of elobixibat per kg of CDHF diet was created and used based on the mean expected body weight and expected food intake. Laboratory and staining methods The details of the experimental method were given in a previous report [9]. Blood was obtained from the heart at the time of sacri ce after 12 h of fasting, and blood chemistry analysis was performed using SRL (Tokyo, Japan). Total bile acids were measured by Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The liver was divided into subsamples for pathological analysis and mRNA puri cation. The remaining samples were sliced (3 \u00b5m thick) from para n blocks and evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Sirius red staining. The number of tumors on the liver surface was counted. Two or more hepatologists grossly diagnosed the tumor.\nImmunohistochemistry for Ki67 was performed using an automatic Ventana Discovery ULTRA Stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). The primary antibody (Rb Ki67/NB600-1252 antibody, Novus Biologicals, Abingdon, UK) was prediluted (1:100) and applied. The slides were incubated for 32 min at 37\u2103. The slides were developed for 16 min with OmniMap anti-Rb HRP (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and were detected using ChromoMap DAB (Ventana). The slides were counterstained with Ventana Hematoxylin II reagent for 4 min to visualize the nuclei. It was followed by a bluing reagent for 4 min, dehydrated, and mounted as in routine processing.\nTotal RNA was puri ed from liver tumor tissues using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA by reverse transcription using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) with synthetic oligonucleotide primer pairs. The primer list is shown below. Relative mRNA expression was assessed by SYBR Green real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the MX3005P sequence detection system (Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Target mRNA levels were standardized against the corresponding expression levels of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), a housekeeping gene. The primer was: p21 (Cdkn1a): 5' CAACCCATCTGCATCCGTTTCACC, 5' GAGTGGGGACCATTCCTGTCTTCA, \u03b1-SMA 5' GCTGTTTTCCCATCCATCGT 5' GTTGGTGATGATGCCCTGTT, TGF-\u03b2 5' CCACCTGCAAGACCATCGAC 5' CTGGCGAGCCTTAGTTTGGAC. Analysis of fecal microbiome For microbiome analysis, DNA isolated from fecal samples was ampli ed using universal primers targeting the V3\u20134 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA. The PCR products were pooled to construct a sequencing library, sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer to generate pair-end reads using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 with 2 \u00d7 300 reads and 600 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\nThe raw paired-end reads from Miseq were analyzed using the QIIME2 (version 2019.11 https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.11/) pipeline [10]. DADA2 was used to assess the quality of the reads,\nPage 6/22\nwhich included ltering, trimming, denoising, dereplicating, merging the forward and reverse strands, and removing chimeras [11]. Taxonomy was assigned to the 16S rRNA data using SILVA [12] (Version 132). Analysis of bile acid in serum and liver tissue Bile acids in the serum and liver were analyzed per the method described by Asano et al. [13]. Speci cally, 530 \u00b5L of methanol (MeOH)/acetonitrile (ACN) (1:1, v/v) and 10 \u00b5L of internal standard (IS) solution (CAd4, CDCA-d4, DCA-d4, and UDCA-d4 solutions, 0.05 mg/mL each) were added to 60 \u00b5L of serum sample. After the mixed solution was vortexed, it was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min, and 500 \u00b5L supernatant was evaporated using a centrifugal concentrator at room temperature. The residue was reconstituted in 50 \u00b5L of 10% MeOH and ltered through a 0.22 mm lter. For liver samples, approximately 20 mg of the liver sample was homogenized in a ve-fold volume of the MeOH/ACN (1:1, v/v) mixture solution with respect to the liver weight. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min. After 10 \u00b5L of the IS mixture solution (250 ng/mL each) was added to 50 \u00b5L of the supernatant, the sample was evaporated using a centrifugal concentrator at room temperature. The residue was reconstituted in 50 \u00b5L of 10% MeOH and ltered through a 0.22 \u00b5m lter.\nInstrumental analysis of bile acids was performed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS-8060, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with the LC/MS/MS method package for bile acids (Ver.2, Shimadzu Co.). Statistical analysis Continuous variables were expressed as medians (interquartile range) and analyzed using the Mann\u2013 Whitney U-test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. Statistical signi cance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GRAPH PAD Software Inc, California, USA).\nMicrobiome comparisons, a heat map, and diversity were visualized and statistically analyzed using the online microbiome data analysis platform (Microbiome Analyst [14]: https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst). Its settings were as follows: low-count lter (minimum count: 0, percentage to remove: 0%) and data rarefying (data rarefying: Rarefy to the minimum library size). Alpha diversity was calculated with the Shannon index using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. Beta diversity was estimated using the unweighted UniFranc distance and visualized using the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) method. The signi cance of the PCoA plot was analyzed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), which uses distance metrics by the Bray-Curtis index to con rm the strength and statistical signi cance of the sample groupings. Differential taxonomy between the two groups was compared using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe [15]: http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/ ) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score > 2 and Pvalue < 0.05.\nResults\nPage 7/22\nElobixibat did not cause any difference in body weight, serum lipid concentrations, and fatty and brosis areas.\nNo signi cant differences existed in body weight, food intake, serum lipid levels, or alanine transaminase (ALT) between the elobixibat and control groups ( Table\u00a01). However, the elobixibat group had higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholinesterase (ChE) levels than the control group. Both groups showed increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT levels due to in ammation, as revealed by histological examination of in ammatory cell in ltration. The two groups had no difference in the extent of fatty and brotic areas (Figs.\u00a01b and 1c). The levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) were also not signi cantly different between the two groups (Fig.\u00a01d). These results suggest that elobixibat does not signi cantly reduce body weight or improve fatty liver or brosis.\nPage 8/22\nElobixibat reduced the number and size of tumors.\nThe number of liver surface tumors was signi cantly lower in the elobixibat group, with a median (IQR) of 7.5 (2\u201314) compared to 18.5 (9\u201325) in the control group (p = 0.013) (Fig.\u00a01e). The number of tumors larger than 2 mm was also signi cantly lower in the elobixibat group, with a median of 4.5 (1\u20136) compared to 0.5 (0\u20132) in the control group (p = 0.015). Tumor cells were easily recognizable as highdensity masses in HE staining, some containing a fatty component. Random sampling revealed that the tumor area had many Ki67-positive hepatocytes (supplement Fig.\u00a01). The expression of p21 in the liver tissue was signi cantly higher in the elobixibat group than in the control group (Fig.\u00a01d).\nAbout 94.6% of the fecal microbiomes in the elobixibat group were Gram-negative bacteria.\nPage 9/22\nAlpha diversity is shown in Fig.\u00a02a. The samples from the pre-elobixibat group were taken at 8 weeks of age from mice fed a normal diet before elobixibat administration. Alpha diversity was lower in the CDHF diet + DEN group than in the pre-elobixibat group and even lower in the elobixibat group. The PCoA plot (Fig.\u00a02b) also clearly showed the differences in microbiome compositions, with the pre-elobixibat and elobixibat groups being signi cantly different despite being obtained from the same mouse. The proportions at the phylum level are shown in Fig.\u00a02c; Bacteroidota was 52.1%, Firmicutes was 41.1%, and Proteobacteria was 2.78% in the pre-elobixibat group. These bacteria have been reported to be dominant in many previous reports and are considered to have a typical distribution. In contrast, in the CDHF diet + DEN control group, Firmicutes accounted for 32.9% and Bacteroidota 44.3%, lower than those in the preelobixibat group. The relative abundances of Verrucomicrobiota, Desulfobacterota, and Proteobacteria were higher in the elobixibat group than in all other groups, with Bacteroidota at 56.4%. The total relative abundance of Actinobacteria (0.081%), Firmicutes (5.32%), and Patescibacteria (0%), which are grampositive bacteria, was 5.4% in the elobixibat group, signi cantly lower than that in the pre-elobixibat group (41.7%)and the control group (33.7%).\nThe proportions of genus-level bacteria are shown in Fig.\u00a02d. In the Control group, there were Bacteroides (22.0%), Akkermansia (11.5%), and Alloprevotella (11.4%). In contrast, the elobixibat group was dominated by gram-negative bacteria, with Bacteroides (27.2%), Akkermansia (22.1%), and Alloprevotella (8.8%) being the three most abundant bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were present in low percentages: Lactobacillus (Firmicutes): 1.04%, Faecalibaculum: 0.5%, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group: 0.4%, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1: 0.3%. The heat map in Supplementary Fig.\u00a02 demonstrates the clear differences in microbiome distribution among the three groups.\nComparison of microbiome between the two groups and pre/post changes in the elobixibat group Figure 3 shows the bacteria with signi cantly different relative abundances between the two groups. Figure\u00a03a compares the CDHF diet + DEN and CDHF diet + DEN + elobixibat groups using different mice of the same age and diet. Elobixibat signi cantly reduced the number of gram-positive bacteria from the Firmicutes, Deferribacterota, and Actinobacteria phyla and increased the number of Proteobacteria compared to the control group. Similar changes were observed before and after elobixibat treatment (Fig.\u00a03b), using the same mice, but with one group being 8 weeks old and receiving a normal diet (Pre elobixibat) and the other group being 28 weeks old and receiving CDHF diet + elobixibat (Post elobixibat). These results indicate that the elobixibat-induced changes in the microbiome do not revert to the condition before CDHF diet + elobixibat administration but rather result in an even lower proportion of gram-positive bacteria than before CDHF diet + elobixibat administration. A detailed list of the bacteria with changed relative abundances is provided in Supplemental Table\u00a01, which also highlights the increased relative abundance of Bi dobacterium and Clostridium bile salt hydrolase-rich bacteria in the elobixibat group compared to the control group.\nPage 10/22\nThe levels of certain primary and secondary bile acids were reduced in both liver tissue and serum in the elobixibat group.\nOut of 39 targeted bile acids, 25 were detected. The primary bile acids, including cholic acid (CA), glycocholic acid (GCA), and taurocholic acid (TCA), in the serum were signi cantly reduced in the elobixibat group (Fig.\u00a04a). In rodents, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is metabolized to alpha-muricholic acid (\u03b1-MCA) and beta-muricholic acid (\u03b2-MCA). Therefore, the mice\u2019s speci c bile acids characteristic is MCAs and not CCDCA. Bile acids related to MCA, including tauro-\u03b1-MCA (T\u03b1MCA), \u03b2-MCA, and tauro-\u03b2muricholic acid (T\u03b2MCA), were also signi cantly decreased in the elobixibat group. All types of primary bile acids were increased in the elobixibat group. Secondary bile acids, including 3-keto-cholic acid (3- ketoCA), 7-keto-deoxycholic acid (7-ketoDCA), ursocholic acid (UCA), and norcholic acid (NorCA), were signi cantly lower in the elobixibat group. At the same time, DHCA was signi cantly higher, and deoxycholic acid (DCA) was not signi cantly different between the two groups (Fig.\u00a04b).\nDiscussion Recently, it has been reported that bile acids, the microbiome, and lipid metabolism are associated with NASH and tumorigenesis. This study is the rst to show that elobixibat reduces tumor incidence without any brotic and lipid changes. It is because it lowers serum bile acids and primary bile acids in the liver by inhibiting bile acid absorption in the terminal ileum. The study also found that bile acids in the colon signi cantly reduced the percentage of gram-positive bacteria. It is speculated that the decrease in Clostridium clusters, primarily gram-positive bacteria, is related to the 7\u03b1-dehydroxylation reaction carried out by enteric bacteria during the production of secondary bile acids, leading to lower serum bile acid levels, which indicates that bile acids are directly related to liver tumors and that elobixibat does not worsen liver brosis.\nElobixibat is an inhibitor of the IBAT, primarily located in the terminal ileum, and reabsorbs approximately 95% of secondary bile acids into the portal vein. Graffner et al. [16] reported that A4250, another IBAT inhibitor, decreased plasma levels of total bile acids in phase 1 clinical trials compared to controls. Similarly, elobixibat suppresses reabsorption, which may reduce primary bile acids in the liver. In animal studies, Yamauchi et al. [8] found that administration of elobixibat signi cantly reduced liver brosis and in ammation in a methionine- and choline-de cient diet mouse model, a NASH model. They also noted that total serum bile acid was increased, but administration of elobixibat decreased total serum bile acid to the same level as in mice on a standard diet. Our study also found a marked decrease in serum bile acid levels, but there was no change in brosis or lipidosis in response to choline de ciency alone. Because the CDHF diet has a higher fat component than methionine- and choline-de cient diets, it is possible that the difference was not signi cant.\nYoshimoto et al. [3] reported that high levels of bile acids are associated with increased liver tumors. They also found that an increase in DCA, a type of secondary bile acid, is involved in carcinogenesis when a high-fat diet increases. Ma et al. [4] showed a relationship between serum bile acids and liver tumors,\nPage 11/22\nindependent of fatty liver and brosis. While antibiotics have been used to alter the microbiome, elobixibat may be a new approach to alter the bile acid/microbiome connection.\nStudies have shown that bile acids can affect tumor immunity and promote liver cancer. For example, MA C et al. [4] reported that intestinal bacteria use bile acids as messengers to regulate antitumor immunity against primary and metastatic liver tumors by regulating hepatic NKT cell accumulation. Sun et al. [17] showed that bile acids can promote liver cancer via increased in ammatory signaling, such as regulating NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. Our study observed a decrease in the primary bile acid, cholic acid, which may have inhibited tumorigenesis. Although increased secondary bile acids have been reported in liver tumors and serum, we found little change in secondary bile acids in the liver tissue. Some minor changes were observed, including a reduction in NorCA, which has been linked to tumorigenesis by negatively regulating FXR [18]. We believe that the reduction of primary bile acids was an important factor in the reduction of tumor incidence in liver tissue with respect to bile acids.\nMoreover, large amounts of bile acids inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria, and the shift from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria in the colon must have occurred. Multiple types of bacteria synthesize secondary bile acids. It is believed that primary and some secondary bile acids must have decreased in the intestine, where bacteria rich in bile salt hydrolase, such as Clostridium spp., were reduced. In T5KO mice, vancomycin treatment resulted in a lower level of Gram-positive Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, belonging to the phylum Firmicutes; Bi dobacteria of the phylum Actinobacteria; and Clostridium cluster XXII, which produces secondary bile acids [19]. Selective depletion of intestinal bacterial communities, such as Clostridium cluster XIVa, which produces secondary bile acids, was observed. The absence of hepatocarcinogenesis in vancomycin-treated mice strongly correlated with a signi cant decrease in circulating secondary bile acids [18]. In other words, we reported that the reduction in bacteria related to bile acid synthesis led to the inhibition of carcinogenesis. In our study, gram-positive bacteria may have been signi cantly depleted, leading to a similar pathogenesis.\nThe microbiome contains pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharides in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria [20], which can enter the portal vein and cause in ammation and brosis via activation of astrocytes in the liver increasing the risk of carcinogenesis. However, nextgeneration sequencing only shows the relative abundance of bacterial ora and not the absolute abundance. It was not possible to measure this in our study. However, it is possible that the relative number of gram-negative bacteria was lower than the overall bacterial abundance due to the selective reduction of gram-positive bacteria.\nThis study had some limitations. First, it only used one model, a high-fat diet causing increased bile acids; further examination using various models is necessary. Second, the relative abundance of the microbiome was measured, but it is important to compare the actual number of gram-positive bacteria to determine if there was an increase. Finally, further molecular biological studies are required to understand the relationships between brosis, in ammation, and fat.\nPage 12/22\nElobixibat reduced the levels of bile acids in both the serum and liver by inhibiting bile acid absorption in the terminal ileum. This change may lead to the inhibition of tumor development. Gram-positive bacteria play a signi cant role in synthesizing of secondary bile acids but are inhibited by bile acids. This study showed that elobixibat effectively suppressed the incidence of tumors and the presence of gram-positive bacteria in stool samples (Fig.\u00a05).\nDeclarations Funding\nThis work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (Grant number 21K15970 for KY) and Grant-in-Aid for Scienti c Research(C) (Grant number 20K08382 for TH) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).\nCompeting interests\nThe authors have no relevant nancial or non- nancial interest to disclose.\u00a0\nAuthor contributions\nAuthor contributions: Yoshiaki Sugiyama, Kenta Yamamoto, and Takashi Honda conceived the project and designed the experiments.
