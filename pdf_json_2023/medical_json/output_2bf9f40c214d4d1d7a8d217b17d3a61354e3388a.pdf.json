    "abstractText": "Background The main objective of this study was to describe the relationship between working conditions, sleep and psycho\u2010affective variables and medical errors. Methods This was an observational, analytical and cross\u2010sectional study in which 661 medical residents answered questionnaires about working conditions, sleep and psycho\u2010affective variables. Actigraphic sleep parameters and peripheral temperature circadian rhythm were measured in a subgroup of 38 subjects. Bivariate and multivariate predictors of medical errors were assessed. Results Medical residents reported working 66.2 \u00b1 21.9 weekly hours. The longest continuous shift was of 28.4 \u00b1 10.9 h. They reported sleeping 6.1 \u00b1 1.6 h per day, with a sleep debt of 94 \u00b1 129 min in workdays. A high percentage of them reported symptoms related to psycho\u2010affective disorders. The longest continuous shift duration (OR = 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00\u20131.05], p = 0.01), working more than six monthly on\u2010call shifts (OR = 1.87 [95% CI, 1.16\u20133.02], p = 0.01) and sleeping less than six hours per working day (OR = 1.66 [95% CI, 1.10\u20132.51], p = 0.02) were independently associated with self\u2010reported medical errors. The report of medical errors was associated with an increase in the per\u2010 centage of diurnal sleep (2.2% [95% CI, 0.1\u20134.3] vs 14.5% [95% CI, 5.9\u201323.0]; p = 0.01) in the actigraphic recording. Conclusions Medical residents have a high working hour load that affect their sleep opportunities, circadian rhythms and psycho\u2010affective health, which are also related to the report of medical errors. These results highlight the impor\u2010 tance of implementing multidimensional strategies to improve medical trainees\u2019 sleep and wellbeing, increasing in turn their own and patients\u2019 safety.",

Actigraphic sleep parameters and peripheral temperature circadian rhythm were measured in a subgroup of 38 subjects. Bivariate and multivariate predictors of medical errors were assessed.\nResults Medical residents reported working 66.2 \u00b1 21.9 weekly hours. The longest continuous shift was of 28.4 \u00b1 10.9 h. They reported sleeping 6.1 \u00b1 1.6 h per day, with a sleep debt of 94 \u00b1 129 min in workdays. A high percentage of them reported symptoms related to psycho\u2011affective disorders. The longest continuous shift duration (OR = 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00\u20131.05], p = 0.01), working more than six monthly on\u2011call shifts (OR = 1.87 [95% CI, 1.16\u20133.02], p = 0.01) and sleeping less than six hours per working day (OR = 1.66 [95% CI, 1.10\u20132.51], p = 0.02) were independently associated with self\u2011reported medical errors. The report of medical errors was associated with an increase in the per\u2011 centage of diurnal sleep (2.2% [95% CI, 0.1\u20134.3] vs 14.5% [95% CI, 5.9\u201323.0]; p = 0.01) in the actigraphic recording.\nConclusions Medical residents have a high working hour load that affect their sleep opportunities, circadian rhythms and psycho\u2011affective health, which are also related to the report of medical errors. These results highlight the impor\u2011 tance of implementing multidimensional strategies to improve medical trainees\u2019 sleep and wellbeing, increasing in turn their own and patients\u2019 safety.\nKeywords Sleep, Circadian rhythms, Resident physicians, Medical errors, Fatigue, Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE)\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

            "text": "Modern society is subjected to different demands, like extended working hours and shift work, which can interfere with the homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep with negative consequences in health and wellbeing [1]. In the long term, sleep deprivation and circadian disruption can cause serious health disorders, such as obesity [2], cancer [3] or cardiovascular diseases [4]. In the short term, one of the main consequences is fatigue, which, in this context, is defined as the state of sleepiness resulting from factors as time of the day, duration of wakefulness and quantity and quality of prior sleep [5]. Fatigue can significantly reduce performance, productivity, attention, vigilance, communication and manual skills and interfere with the ability to make decisions and to do complex planning; which in turn increase error rates, as well as the number of adverse incidents, accidents and injuries [6].\nMedical residents are particularly affected because, along with the extended working hours and nocturnal work, they have an intense academic load, which includes training courses, research activities, and must devote time to study and get training in medical procedures. In turn, this contributes to increased stress levels, irregular sleep and circadian disruption [7, 8]. In fact, many studies have shown that, in resident physicians, sleep disorders are related with adverse outcomes, such as fatigue, motor vehicle crashes, percutaneous injuries and attentional failures [8\u201311].\nOver the last decades, several countries have limited the in hospital hours for resident physicians in order to improve their health, increase their safety and decrease medical errors and adverse incidents [12\u201314]. However, there are still many controversies around this issue [15]. In some studies, medical errors were found to be related to extended shifts [16\u201318], while in others, the elimination of such extended shifts did not change or worsen its occurrence [19, 20]. It can be suggested that this contradiction arises because reducing medical errors is influenced not only by the length of the shift, but also by other factors such as the work schedule, supervision, and the number of patients seen per hour. These additional variables must also be considered. Therefore, when implementing duty hour restrictions, it is necessary to focus on many variables at the same time. A recent systematic review demonstrated that focusing on duty hours alone did not result in improvements in patients care or residents well-being and may have a negative effect on resident\u2019s education [20]. This reflects the importance of studying the optimal combination of individual- and organizational-focused interventions.\nFurthermore, these interventions must be tailored for different contexts, so it is necessary to carry out studies\nthat encompass different realities. Regulations may vary locally, and in practice residents may work continuously for more than 30\u00a0h with only brief moments to rest or nap [21, 22]. Although there are some studies that explore Argentine resident physicians\u2019 working hours [23, 24], little is known about their sleep\u2013wake cycle and its impact on medical errors.\nThus, the first objective of this study was to describe working conditions, sleep and psycho-affective variables in a sample of Argentine medical residents. Furthermore, we used Multiple Imputation by Chain Equations (MICE) to analyze predictors of medical errors among residents, in order to address the problem of missing data and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to medical errors in this population. In addition, we also studied a subgroup of residents to objectively assess their sleep\u2013wake cycle and their temperature circadian rhythm. By doing so, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety in medical residency programs."

Invitations were extended to all clinical and surgical residents from 19 Argentine hospitals (11 from the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires; one from Derqui, Buenos Aires Province; and seven from Paran\u00e1, Entre R\u00edos Province). Hospitals were selected based on a non-random convenience sampling approach. Response rate was estimated at 40%. In Argentina, medical residency programs mainly last four years and we included participants from all levels of training. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 1, the study was conducted in an initial sample of 661 subjects. The participants who completed the medical error subsection were divided into two groups based on their medical error reporting: the non- medical error group (n = 201) and the medical error group (n = 235). A subset of 62 participants accepted the invitation to take part in the objective study. This modest participation rate can be understood in light of the same work overload factors examined in the current study. Out of these, only 38 participants completely responded the questionnaire. Among them, 19 individuals had successfully completed at least six full days of actigraphy along with accurate sleep log entries (non-medical error group, n = 9; medical error group, n = 10), while 25 participants maintained at least three consecutive days of temperature recording (non-medical error group, n = 11; medical error group, n = 14)."

            "text": "Subjective variables were studied using different questionnaires that the participant completed alone. We used an adapted version of a survey designed by Jagsi et\u00a0 al. [25], translated to Spanish and tested for its comprehension. This questionnaire included clinical and demographic data. Overweight was defined as BMI \u2265 25, and obesity as BMI \u2265 30.\nIn the questionnaire, there was a section dedicated to adverse events, where the residents were asked to answer how many medical errors they had made in the last week. A medical error was explicitly defined in the questionnaire as any action or omission made by the medical resident that would be judged as incorrect by qualified professionals, and that could or could not cause complications, lesions or harm to the patient. The group that did not complete this subsection was excluded from the medical error analysis (Fig.\u00a0 1). Differences between the group included and the group excluded in this analysis are shown in Supplementary Table\u00a01.\nThe questionnaire also asked about some variables of their sleep\u2013wake cycle. They were queried about the duration of their longest sleep period, the frequency and duration of their naps, and their perceived sleep requirement, both on workdays and on days off. The main sleep episodes were considered as anchor sleep and naps were considered as non-anchor sleep. Total sleep was the result from the sum of anchor and non-anchor sleep. Sleep debt was calculated as the difference between desired sleep and total sleep. We also calculated sleep debt between free and working days as the difference between total sleep on free days and total sleep on workdays. Sleep deprivation was defined as sleeping less than six hours per day.\nAnother section of the questionnaire pertained to working characteristics. In this section, participants were queried about the following aspects over the past four weeks: frequency of on-call shifts, the average duration of on-call shifts, the average number of hours of sleep during on-call shifts, and the number of days they experienced significant tiredness. Additionally, they were asked to provide information on the following parameters of the previous week: average number of patients attended daily, total on-duty hours, maximum uninterruptedly hours at work, minimum hours outside work between two consecutive workdays, total hours of sleep at work, total hours of sleep outside work, total hours devoted to minor procedures, total hours dedicated to major procedures, and total hours engaged in direct patient care.\nA Spanish validation of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to study sleep quality. A score between 6 and 7 requires medical attention, a score between 8 and 14 requires medical attention and treatment, and a score higher than 15 is associated with serious sleep problems [26]. The Spanish validated version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was used to measure daytime somnolence. An ESS score between 11 and 14 indicates mild daytime sleepiness, a score between 15 and 17 indicates moderate daytime sleepiness while a score higher than 18 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness symptoms [27]. Psycho-affective variables were studied using Spanish validations of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Copyright \u00a91981, 2016 by Christina Maslach & Susan E. Jackson. All rights reserved in all media. Published by Mind Garden, Inc., www. mindg arden. com). The BAI is a screening measure of frequency and intensity of anxiety symptoms, that contains 21 items on a 4-point Likert scale, with 0 representing \u2019not at all\u2019 and 3 being \u2019severely\u2019. Scores of 0\u20137 are considered \u201cminimal anxiety\u201d; 8\u201315 are \u201cmild anxiety\u201d; 16\u201325 are \u201cmoderate anxiety\u201d; and 26\u201363 are \u201csevere anxiety\u201d [28]. The BDI-short form is a scale\nused to study depression symptoms. It is a 13-item selfreport questionnaire with a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). The inventory classifies symptom severity in four categories: none or minimal (0\u20134 pts), mild (5\u20137 pts), moderate (8\u201315 pts) or severe (more than 16 pts) depression [29]. Burnout is known as the response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job. MBI is used to assess burnout in 3 dimensions: Maslach Emotional Exhaustion score (MEE), Maslach Depersonalization score (MDP) and Maslach Personal Accomplishment score (MPA). Based on normative data, MEE \u2265 27, MDP \u2265 10 and MPA \u2264 33 are considered high scores [30]."

Participants were asked to wear the devices in the nondominant wrist and to complete sleep logs during seven days. Sleep logs allowed to determine the sleeping location (home or hospital) and helped to visually identify \u201cin bed\u201d episodes in actigraphic recordings. The original sample was reduced to 19 individuals (Fig.\u00a0 1) who were the ones that correctly completed the sleep log, had an actigraphic recording at least during six complete days and completed the medical error subsection of the questionnaire. Actigraphy data was analyzed using Action W 2.7 software (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY). Reported sleep duration was standardized to a seven-day period by dividing sleep duration values by the total recording time and multiplying these results by seven. Periods of sleep starting between 8AM and 7PM and ending before 9PM were considered as diurnal sleep. As an indicator of sleep misalignment, we reported the \u201cComposite Phase Deviation\u201d index. For each day, it is calculated as the square root of the sum of two squared values: the distance of midsleep on a given day to an individual reference (we used the acrophase of the circadian temperature rhythm), and the distance of midsleep on the given day to the previous day [31]. Sleep bouts shorter than 3\u00a0h were excluded from this analysis. If a sleep bout was shorter than 3\u00a0h, it was included as main sleep if it was the only one within 24\u00a0h or if it had similar sleep onsets (night shift) or offsets (morning shift) as the previous sleep bout in a block of consecutive shift. When more than one bout appeared within eight hours, mid-sleep was calculated as an average between the sleep onset of the first one and the sleep offset of the last one."

Differences between groups of numerical variables were assessed using a t-test for independent samples or a chi-square test in the case of categorical variables (Fisher test if expected frequencies were < 5). Bivariated correlations were analyzed with a Pearson correlation test.\nA multivariate analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of medical errors in the whole sample. Missing values (< 4% with a random pattern) were imputed using Multivariate Imputation via Chained Equations (MICE) package in R software. MICE is a general approach for imputing multivariate data, which replaces missing values with plausible values drawn from a distribution specifically modeled for each missing entry. The function generates an m number of imputed datasets (m = 5 in this study) which differ in the imputed values. The magnitude of these differences reflect the uncertainty in the imputed values [32]. Then, a binary logistic regression was conducted using the data of all the imputed datasets. We conducted different models including age, year of residence program, number of patients per day, specialty, total weekly hours on duty, longest continuous shift, monthly on-call shifts, anchor sleep, non-anchor sleep, sleep debt and sleep debt between free and working days, as independent predictors, and we chose the model that best adjusted to the data. Goodness of fit was assessed using the pooled C-statistic (area under the ROC curve), and the pooled Nagelkerke\u2019s R2 score.\nVariables derived from actigraphic analysis are shown as mean with 95% CI.

Studies from other countries have found similar workloads in resident physicians [8, 13, 17]. In the last years, some countries established a restriction in resident physicians\u2019 workload. In the United States maximum weekly working time was limited to 80\u00a0hs and duty period length must not exceed 24\u00a0 hs for second-year residents [33]. In New Zealand, they are restricted to work not more than 72\u00a0hs per week and not more than 16\u00a0 hs per day [34], while in Europe\nthe average weekly working time must not exceed 48\u00a0hs with a daily hour rest period of 11 consecutive hours [35, 36]. According to the national normative in Argentina, resident physicians must work up to nine hours per day from Monday to Friday and perform a maximum of eight monthly on-call shifts of up to twelve hours, with a minimum rest of six hours after these extended shifts [37]. Therefore, regarding Argentina, our study shows that the local regulations are often not enforced. Nowadays, these regulations are being discussed, as some authors argue that work hour limitations can negatively affect resident\u2019s education, the acquisition of professional skills, experience in the operating theater, and productivity [20, 36]. However, long working hours are associated with burnout, mental health, and deteriorated wellbeing and safety among resident physicians [7\u201311, 38]. In addition, many studies have shown that the reduction in working hours not only improves residents\u2019 quality of life but also their quality of attention and performance [16, 39].\nIn our study, participants reported an anchor sleep of 6.1\u00a0hs in a typical working day, which is almost one hour less than the recommended sleep duration for a young adult [40], with 25% of the trainees sleeping less than six hours. The sleep duration observed in the objective study was quite longer (about 30\u00a0 min more than in the subjective study), but still below the recommended seven hours of sleep per night. Studies from other countries have found similar results [21, 41]. It has been shown that chronic sleep restriction of six hours per night or less generates a deficit on cognitive performance equivalent to up to two nights of total sleep deprivation, generating a neurobiological \u201ccost\u201d that accumulates over time and that can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions, supporting the idea that humans cannot adapt to chronic sleep restriction [42]. During on-call nights, residents reported sleeping an average of three hours. This result is also similar to the one previously reported [21]. This amount of sleep is much less than the one required to perform adequately, especially considering that sleep in hospital is of lower quality than at home [43]. During extended shifts, interruptions of sleep not only reduce the overall amount of sleep, but also can lead to \u201csleep inertia\u201d which can impair performance and has been shown to be more pronounced in sleep-deprived people [44]. It is possible that residents compensate this sleep loss with diurnal naps during the day after an extended shift. In our study, considering naps, sleep debt is practically reduced to zero, but we must consider that only 25% of the participants usually take naps. Basner and colleagues observed that sleep loss during the on-call night was partially recovered by interns through naps on the first post-call day. However, to fully recover sleep loss, they should have obtained more than four hours of sleep\nduring the on-call night [21]. Something similar may be happening to the residents in our study, which could explain the increased percentage of participants who take naps during their free days.\nThe bivariate correlation analyses done in our study show that both the number of monthly on-call shifts and the length of the longest continuous shift negatively correlated with the amount of obtained sleep and positively correlated with sleep deprivation on workdays. So, as other studies have shown [21], extended overnight shifts increase the likelihood of chronic sleep deprivation in resident physicians. We can hypothesize that educational sleep hygiene programs are needed to increase awareness in this population. However, some studies have shown that these type of programs have no benefit on resident\u2019s sleep [45, 46], possibly because medical residents are aware about the importance of sleeping and avoiding fatigue, but they do not have the necessary resting opportunities.\nIn this study, a high percentage of residents reported symptoms related to anxiety (47%), and depression (47%), along with burnout (57% emotional exhaustion, 49% depersonalization and 35% low personal accomplishment). Moreover, these variables positively correlated with workload. Several other studies showed that total hours of work are associated with burnout and wellness [47\u2013 49]. However, other characteristics of the medical profession, such as sleep deprivation, must be considered. In our study, we have shown that anchor sleep, diurnal sleep and sleep debt correlated with symptoms of anxiety, depression and Maslach scales scores. This adds to the evidence of studies reporting that sleep hours are negatively correlated with increased levels of stress [50]."

            "text": "We found that total hours on duty, the length of the longest continuous shift and the number of on-call shifts were associated with reported medical errors. It is known that fatigue affects resident physicians cognitive performance and coordination, among other variables [50, 51]. A previous study done in Argentina has shown that orthopedic residents\u2019 attention levels are affected after an extended shift of 24\u00a0h [23]. Our results show that sleep habits, such as the typical anchor sleep, total sleep and sleep debt in workdays, the sleep debt between work and free days, and the auto perceived quality of sleep and diurnal somnolence are also related to reported medical errors, as well as diurnal sleep objectively assessed. Some studies have shown that sleep deprivation after an extended shift adversely affects surgical residents\u2019 performance on a simulator trial [52, 53] while others showed no significant effects [54]. Other groups have also found that\nextended-duration work shifts, high hourly load and night work were associated not only with an increased risk of medical errors, adverse events, and attentional failures, but also with personal injuries, accidents, and conflicts with other staff members [8, 10, 16, 55].\nAs previously mentioned, sleep deprivation and long working hours can also affect psycho-affective variables [56, 57]. In this study, we observed that anxiety, depression, and depersonalization scores were related to reported medical errors. These results are in line with those of previous studies that have found a relationship between burnout and residents\u2019 self-reported errors [58].\nThe decline in shift worker\u2019s performance is attributed to the misalignment caused by working and sleeping at the wrong circadian phase [59]. This discrepancy between the social and biological clocks is known as social jet lag [60]. Although the composite phase deviation index used in this study was not associated with medical errors, we observed a link between higher percentages of diurnal sleep and lower levels of nocturnal sleep and medical errors. Even though actigraphic data has an important dispersion, results from the objective study are consistent with those derived from the subjective study. Moreover, these findings align with the documented effects of extended shifts on both sleep and performance, as indicated in previous studies [52, 53, 55]. Indeed, the values of the composite phase deviation index found in this study are close to those reported in a study in long-haul bus drivers, who are subjected to high fatigue risk work schedules [61]. In turn, circadian disruption can worsen residents\u2019 physical and mental health, wellbeing and performance [59, 62].\nIn the multivariate analysis reported in this study, we observed that the longest continuous shift, working more than six monthly on-call shifts and sleeping less than six hours per day were predictors of self-reported medical errors. It seems obvious that those who work more hours have a lower sleep opportunity. In line with this, there are other publications that show that sleep hours are negatively correlated with significant medical errors, and working in an impaired condition [50]. McCormick and colleagues found that residents\u2019 fatigue levels increase the risk of medical errors by 22% [41]. Interestingly, Van Dongen et\u00a0 al. also have shown that neurobehavioral deficits were primarily caused by excessive wakefulness beyond a maximum period both across days of chronic sleep restriction and across days of total sleep deprivation [42]. Excessive wakefulness is a result of extended shifts and on-call nights, and, of course, it can be considered the main cause for sleep deprivation. Indeed, we could argue that in this population more attention must be paid to working hours policies than to sleep hygiene programs. In fact, a study\nfound that the implementation of an sleep hygiene program had no significant effect on sleep deprivation in medical residents [45].\nFinally, some\u00a0 limitations of this study must be considered. First, residents who reported higher values of working hours and burnout indexes may be more prone to show the impact of fatigue in their performance, determining recall bias. This may be associated with additional selection bias, since the residents who answered the medical error subsection showed higher reported values of extended working hours, exhaustion, and depersonalization. Second, even if the number of selected hospitals was high, the utilization of a nonrandom convenience approach introduces a potential limitation by compromising the results\u2019 generalizability to the entire country. Third, the findings from the objective study would have been more representative and conclusive if it had been done with a higher number of participants. Unfortunately, the compliance of medical residents to wear the actigraphs and temperature sensors during a 7-day period, and to\u00a0 fully complete the sleep log and questionnaire, was poor. Only 19 out of 38 recordings were valuable for actigraphic analysis, and 25 out of\u00a0 38 for temperature rhythm analysis.\nIn addition to these limitations, this study also boasts several strengths. Firstly, a limited number of studies have undertaken the analysis of the relationship between sleep and medical errors by employing an approach that combines a multivariate analysis of subjective data with measures of objective parameters. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, no studies in this area conducted a multivariate analysis using MICE to handle missing data, a relatively novel tool with increasing use in epidemiological research [32, 63]. Finally, as previously mentioned, while the objective study\u2019s sample size may be less than optimal, the subjective study encompasses a substantial number of participants, affording us to derive several conclusions.\nSome recommendations warrant consideration for future research. Firstly, there is a need to develop new tools, while also validating existing tests, such as reaction time tasks or neuropsychological evaluations, for the detection of fatigue and performance impairment in healthcare settings. Additionally, a notable gap exists in the literature concerning research on the integration of strategic napping within hospital environments. Lastly, is essential to conduct research on the effects of implementing a Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) that considers multiple strategies to prevent and detect fatigue and burn out. Studies should encompass an evaluation of outcomes related to sleep patterns, fatigue levels, performance, and overall wellbeing of medical residents."

            "text": "Our study has shown that high workload, which can disrupt sleep patterns, is closely related to medical errors. Additionally, we have highlighted the importance of taking into account burn out and psycho-affective variables. These results highlight the importance of implementing appropriate shift-work scheduling strategies, identifying effective tools to monitor sleep and fatigue, and developing interventions to ameliorate the impact of circadian shift work disorders in medical residents\u2019 health. As it was shown in other studies, different interventions, such as melatonin intake, strategic napping, and biomathemathical modeling of fatigue [64\u201366], could prevent sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment in resident physicians. However, an implementation alone is not sufficient to prevent and control fatigue.\nStrategies should consider different variables concurrently. A potential approach could be the implementation of a FRMS for healthcare personnel, consisting of defensive layers aimed at preventing fatigue-related errors and incidents. These layers include the development of work schedules based on biomathematical fatigue modelling, the assessment of sleep duration, and the evaluation of signs of fatigue, especially during the vulnerable nighttime hours [67]. Additionally, the integration of planned naps in comfortable environments, and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, would contribute to the mitigation of fatigue and the enhancement of residents\u2019 well-being. Finally, an increase in the number of medical residency positions to promote a more balanced distribution of workload among residents should complement this approach.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12889\u2011 023\u2011 17130\u20114.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Supplementary Figure\u00a01.
