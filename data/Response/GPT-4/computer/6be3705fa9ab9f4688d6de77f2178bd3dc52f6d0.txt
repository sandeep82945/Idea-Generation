Extension to Other Crops and Mycotoxins: Exploring the applicability of the HSI-CNN framework for detecting other mycotoxins beyond deoxynivalenol (DON), such as aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, in a broader range of crops like wheat, corn, and peanuts. This research could help in developing comprehensive tools for mycotoxin detection across the agricultural sector.

Integration with Robotic Systems for Automated Field Surveillance: Developing integrated systems combining HSI and CNN models with drones or robotic platforms for real-time field surveillance and mycotoxin detection. This approach could revolutionize how farmers and agronomists monitor crop health and mycotoxin risks, enabling proactive management practices.

Improvement of Deep Learning Models: Investigating advanced deep learning techniques, such as transfer learning, ensemble models, and attention mechanisms, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of HSI data analysis for mycotoxin detection. This could include exploring different architectures or hybrid models that combine the strengths of various machine learning approaches.

Non-invasive Detection Techniques for Processed Foods: Expanding the research to include the detection of DON and other mycotoxins in processed food products using HSI and CNNs. This would involve adapting the models to handle the complexities introduced by processing, such as changes in texture, color, and composition, which could affect the spectral signatures of mycotoxins.

Real-time Inline Monitoring Systems for Grain Processing Industries: Developing and implementing real-time, inline monitoring systems based on the optimized HSI-CNN framework for use in grain processing facilities. Such systems could continuously monitor the DON levels in grains during processing, ensuring product safety and regulatory compliance while minimizing the need for batch testing and reducing waste.
