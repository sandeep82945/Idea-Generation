    "abstractText": "Even though existence of non-convergent evolution of the states of populations in ecological and evolutionary contexts is an undeniable fact, insightful game-theoretic interpretations of such outcomes are scarce in the literature of evolutionary game theory. As a proof-of-concept, we tap into the information-theoretic concept of relative entropy in order to construct a game-theoretic interpretation for periodic orbits in a wide class of deterministic discrete-time evolutionary game dynamics, primarily investigating the two-player two-strategy case. Effectively, we present a consistent generalization of the evolutionarily stable strategy\u2014the cornerstone of the evolutionary game theory\u2014and aptly term the generalized concept: information stable orbit. The information stable orbit captures the essence of the evolutionarily stable strategy in that it compares the total payoff obtained against an evolving mutant with the total payoff that the mutant gets while playing against itself. Furthermore, we discuss the connection of the information stable orbit with the dynamical stability of the corresponding periodic orbit.",

As a proof-of-concept, we tap into the information-theoretic concept of relative entropy in order to construct a game-theoretic interpretation for periodic orbits in a wide class of deterministic discrete-time evolutionary game dynamics, primarily investigating the two-player two-strategy case. Effectively, we present a consistent generalization of the evolutionarily stable strategy\u2014the cornerstone of the evolutionary game theory\u2014and aptly term the generalized concept: information stable orbit. The information stable orbit captures the essence of the evolutionarily stable strategy in that it compares the total payoff obtained against an evolving mutant with the total payoff that the mutant gets while playing against itself. Furthermore, we discuss the connection of the information stable orbit with the dynamical stability of the corresponding periodic orbit.\nKeywords: Evolutionary games, evolutionarily stable strategy, replicator map, escort-incentive dynamics, periodic orbits, relative entropy.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMany ecological systems are known to exhibit cyclic evolution of the abundance of the constituent species\u2014 well-studied examples include the snowshoe-hare\u2013lynx system [1], wolf-moose system [2] and lemming populations [3]. The simplest explanation for such a cyclic behaviour is mostly attributed to predation, which may be modelled by the corresponding Lotka\u2013Volterra equation [4]. Since the Lotka\u2013Volterra equation is mathematically mappable [5] onto the replicator equation [6, 7]\u2014a paradigmatic evolutionary dynamic in the theory of evolutionary games [8]\u2014the relevance of oscillatory dynamics in evolutionary game theory is worth pondering.\nOne of the central ideas in evolutionary game theory is that of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) [9], which happens to be Nash equilibrium [10, 11] as well. Through the folk theorem (and other similar theorems) [12] of evolutionary game theory, the convergent outcomes\u2014 represented by a fixed point in phase space\u2014of the replicator dynamics can be interpreted as Nash equilibrium and ESS whenever achievable. These game-theoretic interpretations of the fixed points can be further supplemented with interesting information-theoretic connection: A fixed point that is an ESS is locally asymptotically stable and an appropriately constructed Kullback\u2013 Leibler (KL) divergence (also called relative entropy) [13] is a Lyapunov function [14] for the fixed point, i.e., the nonnegative function decreases with the passage of\n\u2217 sayakb@iitk.ac.in \u2020 vdubey@iitk.ac.in \u2021 a.mukhopadhyay@bham.ac.uk \u00a7 sagarc@iitk.ac.in\ntime [15] until the dynamics converges onto the fixed point eventually.\nNevertheless, there is a dearth of literature about the game-theoretic and the information-theoretic interpretations for non-convergent oscillatory outcomes. In this paper, we contribute to this area. For pragmatic reasons, it is rather convenient to work with discrete-time replicator equation (replicator map) as even with a population with two strategies (phenotypes), one can witness cyclic behaviour [16, 17]. In fact, using the replicator map, it was shown earlier [18] that a game-theoretic interpretation of periodic orbits is possible\u2014an extension of ESS, called heterogeneity stable orbit (HSO), was proposed. However, unlike the ESS, the concept of the HSO does not consider fitness as the quantity to be optimized during natural selection; rather it concerns itself with the optimization of a weighted fitness\u2014the weight being heterogeneity. The heterogeneity is the probability that two arbitrarily chosen members of the population belong to two different phenotypes. Although a justification for the HSO could be found in its connection with the stable periodic orbits just as ESS is connected with stable fixed points, going beyond the well-accepted notion of fitness to a weighted fitness appears unconventional. Moreover, it is not clear if HSO conforms with the principle of decreasing relative entropy [13].\nA natural question emerges at this point: Using the notion of decreasing relative entropy during the evolution of the system, does there exist a natural extension of ESS for the case of periodic orbits such that fitness (sans any weight) is the object of optimization? We answer this question affirmatively in this paper by the introduction of the extension of ESS termed appropriately as Information Stable Orbit (ISO). We also find an encouraging connection of this game-theoretic concept\u2014obtained\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n00 52\n0v 3\n[ nl\nin .A\nO ]\n2 0\nM ay\n2 02\n3\n2 though information-theoretic ideas\u2014with the dynamical system theoretic concept of stability of periodic orbits.

            "text": "As noted in the introduction, the central result of this work is a generalization of the game-theoretic notion of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS)\u2014traditionally only defined for fixed points\u2014to periodic outcomes in discretetime evolutionary dynamics. To do this, we revisit the relative entropy minimization principle for evolutionary dynamics [15, 23, 24]. As per this principle, if an evolving population state is close to an equilibrium point, the relative entropy (quantified using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, defined in Eq. (1)) monotonically decreases. This heuristic principle may be considered as an application of Kullback\u2019s general proposal of the principle of minimum discrimination information\u2014which has been used successfully in various contexts [25\u201327]\u2014to evolutionary systems. In fact, this may be interpreted quite physically: Darwinian evolution ensures that the amount of biological information produced during evolution, as compared to the equilibrium state, is optimized [24].\nIn Sec. II, we explicitly demonstrate how minimization of the KL-divergence yields the well-known gametheoretic stability criteria (such as ESS) for fixed points in evolutionary dynamics. While such results have been explored recently for continuous-time dynamics, we extend this to discrete-time dynamics. In addition to the paradigmatic replicator map (see Eq. (2)), we also discuss two generalized classes of evolutionary dynamics as well\u2014the incentive and escort-incentive dynamics. The incentive dynamic (Eq. (3)) accommodates for various updation protocols of incentive in evolutionary games, while the escort-incentive dynamic (Eq. (8)) additionally generalizes the averaging procedure in the incentive map.\nOur main results are in Sec. III, where we extend this program for periodic orbits in discrete-time evolutionary dynamics. A previous (purely game-theoretic) endeavour [18] to construct a generalization of ESS for periodic orbits in such dynamics was the Heterogeneity Stable Orbit (HSO) (see Eq. (13)), which was also accompanied by a generalization of the Nash equilibrium, known as the Heterogeneity Orbit (HO) (Eq. (11)). From a game-theoretic perspective, the hope was straightforward: Just as an ESS state yields the maximum payoff against an arbitrary state in its neighbourhood as compared to the state playing against itself, a generalization\nof ESS for periodic orbits\u2014which would be a sequence of states\u2014would achieve this in a periodically averaged sense. In other words, we intuit that the periodic orbit would yield the maximum total payoff when played against a sequence of evolving states as opposed to the evolving states playing against themselves. The HSO condition achieves this in a little weak fashion because it involves a weighted payoff, where the weight measures the heterogeneity in the evolving population state. Quite elegantly, our information-theoretic technique, adopted in this paper, achieves our intuition exactly: We do not require a weighted payoff and simply compare the sum of payoffs over a period; thus, generalizing the notion of ESS for periodic orbits in the discrete-time evolutionary dynamics. We dub this generalization the Information Stable Orbit (ISO) and formulate it for the replicator map (Eq. (14)), the incentive map (Eq. (17)) and the escort-incentive map (Eq.(18)).\nFinally, before we conclude the work in Section IV, we analytically indicate how an ISO may correspond to dynamically stable periodic orbit (in Sec. III C) and verify the analysis for various evolutionary dynamics numerically (in Sec. III D). Having presented the brief outline of the body of this paper, we now discuss the technical details in the body of this paper without further ado.\nII. INTERPRETING FIXED POINTS\nWith a view to keeping the presentation of the main ideas of the paper succinct, we confine ourselves to the simplest yet conceptually non-trivial set-up of two-person two-strategy games. Specifically, we consider an infinite unstructured population of two types whose frequencies change over time under some replication-selection rule. Between the individuals (or the players, in gametheoretic terminology), the interactions are assumed random and of two-player kind. The frequencies of the i-th type is denoted by xi and thus, x = (x1, x2) = (x1, 1\u2212 x1) = (x, 1\u2212x), in different equivalent notations, is the frequency (or state) vector of the population. Thus, throughout the paper, the states are restricted to the unit interval, i.e., 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, as discussed briefly in subsection below. Many kinds of dynamics for the evolution of the frequencies are studied in the literature.\nFirst, let us recall the paradigmatic continuous-time replicator dynamic [6, 7] in the light of informationtheoretic ideas. Of particular use, is the relative entropy or the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence given by\nDKL(p||q) := \u2211 y p(y) ln[p(y)/q(y)] (1)\nwhere y belongs to the support of the probability distributions p and q. The KL-divergence helps to measure the distance between two probability distributions and herein, we use it as a measure of the distance of an evolving population state from a fixed (equilibrium) population state. Note that the states can be interpreted as dis-\n3 tributions, even though the dynamics is not stochastic. If\nthe fixed population state is chosen as the ESS state, the aforementioned KL-divergence decreases with time [15]. Given that the KL-divergence fits the criteria for being a valid Lyapunov function, one may also interpret this as a statement for dynamical stability. There exists, however, an important nuance to this fact: While the local asymptotic stability and evolutionary stability of a fixed point state are synonymous only for two-strategy games, for games with higher number of strategies, ESS implies local asymptotic stability of the corresponding fixed point but the converse is not necessarily true [6].\nA. Incentive Dynamics\nIn this paper, we are motivated to carry out our investigations with discrete-time dynamics because they are a convenient test-bed for investigating non-convergent outcomes like periodic orbits and chaos. In particular, the following is a version of the discrete-time replicator dynamic [16\u201318, 22, 28\u201333], henceforth referred to as the replicator map, that exhibits periodic orbits and chaos even in the simple two-strategy case:\n\u2206x (k) i = x (k) i [ fi(x (k))\u2212 \u2329 f(x(k)) \u232a] . (2)\nHere \u2206x (k) i := x (k+1) i \u2212 x (k) i represents the difference between consecutive population states and f is the fitness function for the types, with the average population fit-\nness being given by \u2329 f(x(k)) \u232a := \u2211 j x (k) j fj(x\n(k)). The superscript denotes the time step. We also note that as per our notation, f(x) denotes a vector with components fi(x). For this discrete map, it can be shown that a locally asymptotically stable fixed point implies ESS for two-strategy games [17, 34], without its converse being necessarily true. To ensure the solutions of the above discrete replicator map (and all such subsequently introduced maps) are physical (i.e., 0 \u2264 x(k)i \u2264 1 for all i and k), we must restrict the parameter space of the map (here, captured by the function f ; for details, see Eq. (23)) to the strict physical region, as defined in Ref. [17, 35].\nThe replicator map in Eq. (2) phenomenologically models the replication-selection dynamics in line with the Darwinian tenet of natural selection. We know [17] that its fixed points correspond to the Nash equilibria [36] and the evolutionarily stable strategies or states [37] are associated with the folk theorems of the evolutionary game theory [38], just as in the continuous-time case. However, we remark that this form of the replicator equation should not necessarily be seen just as an Euler discretization of the continuous-time equation: It has its own existence unrelated to its counterpart continuous equation. One can motivate this replicator map from viability selection rules [31]. Also, this replicator equation appears to model intergenerational cultural transmission [30, 32],\nboundedly rational players, imitational behaviour in bimatrix cyclic games [29], and reinforcement learning [28]. Thus, it has applicability even beyond usual evolutionary contexts in the biological systems.\nIn fact, a unification of quite a few evolutionary dynamics is mathematically possible through the incentive dynamic [19, 20, 39\u201343] whose discrete-time representation is given by\n\u2206x (k) i = x (k) i (\u03b4\u03d5) (k) i \u2261 \u03d5i(x (k))\u2212 x(k)i \u2211 j \u03d5j(x (k)), (3)\nwhere \u03d5(x(k)) is the incentive vector. The notation (\u03b4\u03d5) (k) i has been introduced for future convenience. The incentive dynamic arises by generalizing the notion of incentive for the players of a game, accounting for different updating procedures utilized by the players. Choice of different incentive functions, \u03d5, correspond to different dynamics (such as replicator, projection [44], logit [21], and best response [45, 46]) as exhibited in Table I. A state of the population is an incentive stable state (ISS) [20], x\u0302, if for any x in the local deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302, we have \u2211\ni\nx\u0302i \u03d5i(x) xi > \u2211 i \u03d5i(x). (4)\nISS reduces to ESS for the replicator equation, given explicitly by x\u0302 \u00b7 f(x) > x \u00b7 f(x).\nFor the two-strategy incentive map\u2014as a generalization of the corresponding result of replicator map [17]\u2014 one can quite readily show using linear stability analysis that a locally asymptotically stable fixed point obeys the ISS condition. Moreover, it is an easy exercise to show that just like for the replicator dynamic, the ISS for the continuous incentive dynamic implies that the time derivative of the KL-divergence, DKL(x\u0302||x), is negative. In what follows, we observe that negative discrete-time derivative of the KL-divergence, defined as\n\u2206DKL(x\u0302||x(k)) := DKL(x\u0302||x(k+1))\u2212DKL(x\u0302||x(k)) (5)\nimplies the ISS state. The discrete-time derivative measures the change in relative entropy between an evolving\n4 state and an equilibrium (fixed) state. Notice,\n\u2206DKL(x\u0302||x(k)) = \u2212 2\u2211 i=1 x\u0302i ln ( x (k+1) i /x (k) i ) (6a)\n= \u2212 2\u2211 i x\u0302i ln [ 1 + (\u03b4\u03d5) (k) i ] (6b)\n\u2265 \u2212 ln [ 1 +\n2\u2211 i x\u0302i(\u03b4\u03d5) (k) i\n] . (6c)\nThe last inequality is obtained using Jensen\u2019s inequality [13, 47] for convex functions. Now, for decreasing KL-divergence, we should have \u2206DKL(x\u0302||x(k)) < 0, or, \u2211 i x\u0302i(\u03b4\u03d5) (k) i > 0. This implies, \u2211 i \u03d5i(x\n(k)) \u2212\u2211 i x\u0302i ( \u03d5i(x (k))/x (k) i ) < 0 for all x(k) in the deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302, which is the ISS condition. Note that if one could interpret the KL-divergence as the discrete-time Lyapunov function [48, 49] for this dynamic, this result shows that the stable fixed point implies ISS for two-strategy games, which is in line with the result known using linear stability analysis. Furthermore, an extension to higher (n > 2) strategy games is immediate: the superscripts in the summations can be replaced by n in Eq. (6).\nFor the results on information-theoretic interpretations of stability conditions in evolutionary dynamics in the subsequent parts of the paper, we will follow a line of reasoning similar to Eq. (6), with the details of the mathematical steps relegated to the Appendices."

            "text": "There is yet another way the replicator dynamic can be generalized. Specifically, consider the discrete qdeformed replicator dynamic [50] given by\n\u2206x (k) i = (x (k) i ) q(fi(x (k))\u2212 \u3008f(x(k))\u3009q) (7)\nwhere q is a positive real number and \u3008f(x(k))\u3009q :=\u2211 j(x (k) j ) qfj(x (k))/ \u2211 j(x (k) j )\nq is the q-generalized mean. Clearly, setting q \u2192 1 reduces this dynamic to the standard replicator dynamic. Eq. (7) is, in turn, a special case of a larger set of dynamics given by the following discrete-time escort-incentive dynamic [20]:\n\u2206x (k) i = \u03d5i(x (k))\u2212 \u03c3\u0303i(x(k)) \u2211 j \u03d5j(x (k)), (8)\nwhere the escort distribution vector, \u03c3\u0303(x(k)) = (\u03c3\u03031(x (k)), \u03c3\u03032(x (k))) is defined as ( \u22112 i=1 \u03c3(xi))\n\u22121 (\u03c3(x1), \u03c3(x2)). Nondecreasing and strictly positive on (0, 1), the escort function, \u03c3 (appropriately normalized), maps a discrete probability distribution into itself. In our context, the escort distributions, which are often relevant in nonextensive\nstatistical systems [51], help further generalize the notion of mean\u2014used, e.g., in defining mean fitness of a population. Different choices for different escort and incentive functions correspond to different dynamics, such as replicator, q-deformed replicator, projection, and exponential escort (see Table II). It is interesting to note that this generalization of the replicator dynamic is actually motivated through the information-theoretic framework [20]. In fact, Eq. (3) is a special case of Eq. (8) (when \u03c3i(x) = xi).\nIt is natural that the concepts of ESS and ISS can be further extended for the escort-incentive dynamics: A state of the population is an escort incentive stable state (EISS) [20], x\u0302, if for any x in the local deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302, we have\u2211\ni\nx\u0302i \u03d5i(x) \u03c3i(x) > \u2211 i xi \u03d5i(x) \u03c3i(x) . (9)\nAgain, for the two-strategy escort-incentive map, using linear stability analysis, it is an easy exercise to show\u2014as a generalization of the corresponding result of replicator map [17]\u2014that a locally asymptotically stable fixed point of the two-strategy escort-incentive map is an EISS.\nIt stands proven in the literature [50] that the escort divergence is the Lyapunov function for the continuous escort-replicator equation (which is an alternate escort distribution motivated evolutionary dynamic). We recall that the escort divergence, D\u03c3(x||x\u2032)\u2014 a generalization of the KL-divergence\u2014is given by D\u03c3(x||x\u2032) := \u2211 i \u222b xi x\u2032i\n(log\u03c3(v)\u2212 log\u03c3(x\u2032i)) dv, where log\u03c3(x) := \u222b x 1 \u03c3(u) \u22121 du is called the escort logarithm. Motivated by this result, it is natural to check what negative discrete-time derivative of the escort divergence, defined as \u2206D\u03c3(x\u0302||x(k)) := D\u03c3(x\u0302||x(k+1))\u2212D\u03c3(x\u0302||x(k)), implies and how it is connected with a fixed point, x\u0302, that is an EISS. Here, demanding \u2206D\u03c3(x\u0302||x(k)) < 0 implies\u2211\ni\nx\u0302i \u03d5i(x) \u03c3i(x) > \u2211 i xi \u03d5i(x) \u03c3i(x) \u2212 C\u03c3(x\u0302, k) (10)\nwhere C\u03c3(x\u0302, k) is a non-negative correction term (specific to two types) that arises because of the choice of bounds of the integrals. The details of this computation and the explicit form of C\u03c3(x\u0302, k) are provided in Appendix A. Since the correction term is non-negative, the obtained\n5 condition is automatically satisfied by the EISS condition in Eq. (9).\nIn summary, we have understood how the decrease in an information-theoretic divergence, namely, the escort divergence (of which KL-divergence is a special case) corresponds to the fixed points that are ESS, ISS, and EISS of a wide class of discrete-time evolutionary dynamics.\nIII. INTERPRETING PERIODIC ORBITS\nNon-convergent outcomes, like periodic orbits, are quite common in evolutionary dynamics. In the discretetime dynamics discussed in the preceding section, such outcomes [16\u201318, 52] are possible even with only twostrategy games, thus rendering the investigations about them analytically tractable. If we represent a finite sequence of m states representing iterates of a map by {x(k)}k=mk=1 (where k denotes the time step), then a periodic orbit of orbit m (i.e., an m-period orbit) can be denoted by an infinite sequence {x(k)}k\u22651 such that x(k) = x(k+m), for any k \u2265 1, where m is the least (also known as prime) period of the orbit. Since a periodic orbit only has m distinct states, it may be compactly denoted by a finite sequence given by {x(k)}k=mk=1 \u2014 a time-ordered collection of m-period points. Now we intend to show that the information-theoretic concept of KL-divergence (or more generally the escort divergence) presents a unique viewpoint that helps to construct a game-theoretic interpretation for the non-convergent dynamical equilibrium, specifically periodic orbit.\nIt is imperative to bring to the readers\u2019 attention that an exercise of imparting game-theoretic meaning to the periodic orbits was performed in Ref. [18]. We first critically revisit that work and scrutinize the concepts related to the periodic orbits within the game-theoretic framework. We confine ourselves only to the standard replicator map in this discussion."

            "text": "Two definitions were introduced [18] as extensions of Nash equilibrium and evolutionarily stable strategy, namely, heterogeneity orbit (HO) and heterogeneity stable orbit (HSO). We formally define them below.\nDefinition 1a (HO for replicator map). A sequence of m distinct states {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 is an HO of order m if for all states x\u0302(j) (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) of this sequence,\nm\u2211 k=1 Hx\u0302(k) [ x\u0302(j) \u00b7 f(x\u0302(k)) ] = m\u2211 k=1 Hx\u0302(k) [ x \u00b7 f(x\u0302(k)) ] . (11)\nHere, heterogeneity factor, Hx \u2261 2x(1\u2212 x), is the probability that two arbitrarily chosen members of the population belong to two different types. The condition of\nHO is equivalent to the condition of periodicity given by\nk+m\u22121\u2211 j=k x\u0302(j)(1\u2212 x\u0302(j)) [ f1(x\u0302 (j))\u2212 f2(x\u0302(j)) ] = 0, (12)\nwhere x\u0302(k) (1 \u2264 k \u2264 m), is any one of the m states of an m-periodic orbit. For m = 1, it reduces to the condition of the Nash equilibrium\u2014x\u0302 \u00b7 f(x\u0302) = x \u00b7 f(x\u0302) for any x in the interior of the simplex.\nDefinition 1b (HSO for replicator map). An HSO of order m is a sequence of m distinct states, {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 such that m\u2211 k=1 Hx(k) [ x\u0302(1) \u00b7f(x(k)) ] > m\u2211 k=1 Hx(k) [ x(1) \u00b7f(x(k)) ] , (13)\nfor any sequence of states {x(k)}k=mk=1 of the map starting in some infinitesimal deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302(1). The HSO reduces to ESS for m = 1 and extends the concept of ESS to periodic orbits.\nUsing linear stability, one can show that all locally asymptotically stable periodic orbits obey the HSO criterion, although the converse is not necessarily true [18]. Moreover, HSO implies HO, just as ESS implies Nash equilibrium. To truly interpret the condition gametheoretically, however, a connection to underlying strategy space is necessary; and in this context, it can be shown that just as the ESS condition is associated with the idea of strong stability [5], HSO may also be associated with the extension of strong stability for periodic orbits [18].\nTwo criticisms of the definition of the HSO are in order. First, the introduction of the heterogeneity factor is somewhat ad hoc. Second, a close inspection reveals that the HSO condition is a bit odd in the following sense: The total payoff on the right hand side of Eq. (13) is not the sum of the evolving mutant state playing with itself, but instead is the sum of payoffs of the mutant playing against a temporally fixed mutant state chosen [note the fixed (1) superscript on the right hand side of Eq. (13)]. In this paper, we circumvent the aforementioned two drawbacks by introducing a new generalization of the ESS.\nB. Information Stable Orbit\nLet us generalize the concept of ESS to define information stable orbit (ISO) as follows:\nDefinition 2a (ISO for replicator map). A sequence of m distinct states, {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 , is ISO of order m of the replicator map if\nm\u2211 k=1 x\u0302(1) \u00b7 f(x(k)) > m\u2211 k=1 x(k) \u00b7 f(x(k)), (14)\nfor any sequence of m states, {x(k)}k=mk=1 , of the map starting in some infinitesimal deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302(1).\n6 The definition of the ISO of order m qualifies any given finite sequence of m states of a map, {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 , by comparing it\u2014using Eq. (14)\u2014with a finite sequence of m mutant states, {x(k)}k=mk=1 , also governed by the map. In doing so, only the first element of the given sequence, x\u0302(1), is explicitly used in the inequality, with the implicit knowledge that the remaining elements of this sequence are specified by the map exactly. The sequence for mutant states starts from the deleted neighbourhood of the first element of the ISO, and the remaining elements of this sequence are also determined exactly by the map. This formulation of a stability criterion for periodic orbits is inspired by the previously defined HSO [18].\nNote that explicitly, Eq. (14) is blind to the notion of a periodic orbit. Thus, in order to qualify a periodic orbit by ISO, we must ensure that each of the m sequences of length m starting from each of the m distinct states of an m-periodic orbit should obey the ISO condition. Here, all the m sequences {x\u0302(j)}j=k+m\u22121j=k equivalently denote the same m-periodic orbit and corresponding nearby sequences {x(j)}j=k+m\u22121j=k start in the infinitesimal deleted neighbourbood of x\u0302(k). Hence, we can recast the ISO condition (Eq. (14)) for periodic orbits as\nk+m\u22121\u2211 j=k x\u0302(k) \u00b7 f(x(j)) > k+m\u22121\u2211 j=k x(j) \u00b7 f(x(j)), (15)\nfor allm states x\u0302(k) of the sequence {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 . Note that the ISO reduces to the ESS for m = 1, which is consistent with the fact that a fixed point can be understood as a 1-period orbit.\nSince any state of an m-period orbit of a nonlinear map is a fixed point of the m-th iterate of the map, it is very natural to ask if the condition of decrease in the KLdivergence leads to an extension of ESS, either HSO or ISO; after all, we have seen earlier that \u2206DKL(x\u0302||x(k)) < 0 leads to ESS [see Eqs. (6)a\u2013c]. To this end, we introduce the notation,\n\u2206mDKL(x\u0302 (k)||x(k)) \u2261 DKL(x\u0302(k)||x(k+m))\u2212DKL(x\u0302(k)||x(k)) (16) which measures the change in the KL-divergence over m time steps. Thus, it is a measure of the total change in the relative entropy over a time period of a periodic orbit of the replicator map. Using Jensen\u2019s inequalities as used in the fixed-point computation (see Eq. (6)), we find that demanding \u2206mDKL(x\u0302\n(k)||x(k)) < 0 implies the ISO condition as given in Eq. (15) and not the condition of HSO. The details of this proof are provided in Appendix B.\nThus, this information-theoretic fact justifies the aptness of the name ISO. One should observe the unidirectionality in the arguments presented in Appendix B. In particular, just as there exist some unstable fixed points that are ESS in the discrete replicator map, we may also find some unstable periodic orbits that obey the ISO condition. This unidirectionality is also true for the HSO condition and appears to be an artefact of the temporal discretization.\nAs can be guessed, the generalization of the ISO for the incentive dynamics is straightforward:\nDefinition 2b (ISO for incentive map). A sequence of m distinct states, {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 , is ISO of order m of the incentive map if\nm\u2211 k=1 \u2211 i x\u0302 (1) i \u03d5i(x (k)) x (k) i > m\u2211 k=1 \u2211 i \u03d5i(x (k)) (17)\nfor any sequence of states, {x(k)}k=mk=1 , of the map starting in some infinitesimal deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302(1).\nWe observe that this condition reduces to ISO on setting \u03d5(x) = xf(x) as expected for the replicator map. Also, m = 1 reproduces the ISS condition (Eq. (4)) as required. We remark that for the condition in Eq. (17) to hold for periodic orbits, we can recast it into a more general form similar to Eq. (15). Then, just like for the ISO of the replicator map, here one can show that the decreasing KL-divergence constructed using a periodic orbit and its neighbouring orbit implies the ISO criterion for incentive map\u2014to prove so, all one has to do is to replace \u03b4xf by more general \u03b4\u03d5 in the proof in Appendix B.\nAs in the discussion for fixed points, we now generalize ISO for the escort-incentive dynamic.\nDefinition 2c (ISO for escort-incentive map). A sequence of m distinct states, {x\u0302(k)}k=mk=1 , is ISO of order m of the escort-incentive map if\nm\u2211 k=1 \u2211 i x\u0302 (1) i \u03d5i(x (k)) \u03c3i(x(k)) > m\u2211 k=1 \u2211 i x (k) i \u03d5i(x (k)) \u03c3i(x(k)) (18)\nfor any sequence of states, {x(k)}k=mk=1 , of the map starting in some infinitesimal deleted neighbourhood of x\u0302(1).\nThe condition in Eq. (18) can also be recast to a form like in Eq. (15) for periodic orbits. Here, in the context of the information-theoretic interpretation of this condition that is an m-periodic orbit, the appropriate information-theoretic concept is the escort divergence. Hence, we introduce the notation, \u2206mD\u03c3(x\u0302\n(k)||x(k)) := D\u03c3(x\u0302\n(k)||x(k+m)) \u2212 D\u03c3(x\u0302(k)||x(k)) which measures the change in the escort divergence over m time steps. We find that demanding \u2206mD\u03c3(x\u0302\n(k)||x(k)) < 0, implies k+m\u22121\u2211 j=k \u2211 i x\u0302 (k) i \u03d5i(x (j)) \u03c3i(x(j)) > k+m\u22121\u2211 j=k \u2211 i x (j) i \u03d5i(x (j) \u03c3i(x(j))\n\u2212 k+m\u22121\u2211 j=k C\u03c3(x\u0302 (k), j). (19)\nwhere C\u03c3(x\u0302 (k), j) is the non-negative correction term introduced in Eq. (10), which arose due to the choice of bounds in the computation. The derivation of this result is given in Appendix C. We observe that if a periodic orbit satisfies the definition of ISO for escort-incentive map (Eq. (18)), then it automatically satisfies the immediately preceding inequality (19). Hence, the relation of the ISO for escort-incentive map, that is a periodic orbit, with decreasing escort divergence is transparent.\n7"

            "text": "In subsection III B, we have motivated the ISO condition from information-theoretic grounds. We now illustrate the central idea of the paper through a proposition that brings together the three perspectives\u2014informationtheoretic, game-theoretic, and dynamic\u2014whose interconnection is what this paper is all about.\nFor simplicity, we consider the replicator map. As described in subsection III A, we note that a locally asymptotically stable periodic orbit of (two-player twostrategy) replicator map is an HSO [18]. Does such a fact exist between periodic orbit and ISO as well? We find that the answer is affirmative (although, the mathematical proof is elusive for periodic orbit of general period). We provide the following result for a two-period orbit:\nProposition 1. A locally asymptotically stable 2-period orbit of a replicator map for two-player two-strategy game is an ISO.\nProof. Since we know that a locally asymptotically stable 2-periodic orbit must be HSO [18], we rewrite the HSO condition (Eq. (13)) as follows 2\u2211 j=1 [ x\u0302(1) \u00b7 f(x(j))\u2212 x(j) \u00b7 f(x(j)) ] >[\nHx(2) Hx(1)\n( (x(1) \u2212 x\u0302(1)) \u00b7 f(x(2)) ) \u2212 (x(2) \u2212 x\u0302(1)) \u00b7 f(x(2)) ] .\n(20)\nThis way of writing makes the terms, required to define the ISO condition, appear conveniently together on the left hand side; hence, to show that the ISO condition holds, one has to simply show that the right hand side is nonnegative. Now, the right hand side may be recast as[ f1(x (2))\u2212f2(x(2)) ][( x\u0302(1) \u2212 x(2) ) \u2212Hx(2) Hx(1) ( x\u0302(1) \u2212 x(1)\n)] =2(Hx(2)) \u22121\u2206x(2) [( x\u0302(1) \u2212 x(2) ) \u2212Hx(2) Hx(1) ( x\u0302(1) \u2212 x(1) )] ,\n(21)\nwhere \u2206x(2) := x(3) \u2212 x(2) (as in the notation introduced in Eq. (2)). We are free to choose small enough neighbourhood of x\u0302(1) so that x(1) is close enough such that the term containing x\u0302(1) \u2212 x(1) on the right-hand side of Eq. (21) can be made arbitrarily small (note that its prefactor composed of heterogeneity factors is finite). Furthermore, for stable periodic orbits and the aforementioned small neighbourhood, \u2206x(2) and x\u0302(1) \u2212 x(2) are of same sign. In conclusion, the right-hand side of Eq. (20) is a positive quantity for some small neighbourhood of x\u0302(1). Therefore, the right-hand side of Eq. (20) is greater than zero, and the aforementioned proposition stands proven.\nThus, Proposition 1 illustrates a connection between the dynamical stability of periodic outcomes and the ISO\nequilibrium. We conjecture that such results may also be derived for higher period orbits although it appears to be mathematically more involved and require the specific properties of the dynamic in question.\nTo appreciate the game-theoretic point-of-view, we observe how the game-theoretic idea of stability in terms of comparison between payoffs seamlessly translates to the stability criterion for periodic orbits as well. There is no explicit need for a heterogeneity-weighted payoff as considered in a prior work [18]. The periodicity condition in Eq. (12) can be treated as the extension of Nash equilibrium for periodic orbits. ISO serves as the extension of ESS. An ESS state is a state such that its payoff, when played against any other state in its neighbourhood, is greater than the payoff gained when the other state plays with itself. Analogously, for the ISO, we see that the relevant quantity for comparison is the sum of payoffs for a particular state x\u0302 of the m-period orbit. Here we must look at a sequence of m states starting from the neighbourhood of the state x\u0302 and compare the sum of the payoffs\u2014as gained by the state x\u0302 while in play with each of the states in the sequence\u2014with the sum of the payoff that the states in the sequence gain while playing against themselves. In other words, we may say that the m-period orbit is evolutionarily stable when a state in the orbit outperforms an evolving mutant state as compared to when the mutant state keeps playing with itself.\nFinally, we remark that the definitions of ISO (Definition 2a-c) are constructed from a game-theoretic perspective, without invoking any notion of (periodic) dynamics. Thus, although our entire analysis pertains to two-player two-strategy games, these definitions also hold for twoplayer n-strategy games (with n > 2)."

            "text": "Our results in this paper lie in the exciting overlapping area of evolutionary game theory, dynamical systems theory, and information theory. Specifically, we have shown that an extension of the idea of ESS is possible for periodic orbits in a large class of discrete-time evolutionary dynamics. We have termed the extended concept as ISO (and its generalizations) because it can be motivated through the information-theoretic idea of decreasing KL-divergence\u2014a rather general principle that extends the idea of entropy maximization [13] in natural world. Thus, the concept of the ISO\u2014in line with similar recent developments [15, 53, 54]\u2014highlights the tightly knit connections between the fields of evolutionary dynamics and information theory. These connections between evolutionary game dynamics and information theory is a promising avenue of research, and we suspect that a lot of information-theoretic concepts (such as Re\u0301nyi entropy, Fisher information, and information geometry) may be transported to this context to improve\n9\nour understanding of evolutionary systems. In particular, the possibility of an information-metric under which the discrete-time replicator map is a gradient-like system is worth pondering, and it could lead to tighter conditions of the stability for periodic orbits in game-theoretic terms.\nFrom the game-theoretic view point, the ISO is a more satisfying extension of the ESS as compared to HSO [18] because it does not require the use of the ad hoc heterogeneity factor in its definition. Furthermore, recall that ESS condition is tied to the concept of strong stability [5] and it is not surprising that HSO is connected to the concept of the strongly stable strategy set (SSSS) [18]\u2014the extension of strong stability for periodic orbits. This is an important qualification, for the strong stability provides perhaps the \u2018best validation for the concept of evolutionary stability\u2019 [5]. Since locally asymptotically stable 2-period orbit\u2014being HSO\u2014is ISO, when the orbit is SSSS, it is ISO as well.\nBefore we end, we would like to delve into some related subtlety that deserves thorough future investigation. We wonder how the unstable periodic orbits connect with the ISO. We know that some unstable orbits are HSO and some are not [18]. Although we are presently unable to\nprovide any rigorous proof but we conjecture that a similar scenario is true for the case of ISO: A trivial example is that of the replicator map for two-player two-strategy stag-hunt game where there is an unstable interior fixed point (1-period orbit) that is not an ESS (or ISO of order 1) [17] (cf. Appendix D).\nSince the replicator dynamic in a structured population remains same as the one for the unstructured population\u2014only the payoff matrix gets modified [55, 56] to include the effects of the structure\u2014our conclusions should carry over to structured infinite populations. To end with an optimistic note, we envisage useful extensions of the concepts developed in this paper for asymmetric games and extensive games, as well as for games in the finite populations. However, for finite populations [57], the notions of mixed ESS and existence of periodic orbits have to be defined before an information-theoretic perspective may be constructed. Probably, the idea of ISO can be useful for the continuous-time evolutionary dynamics as well through the construction of Poincare\u0301 maps\u2014an avenue worth pursuing in future."

            "text": "Here we demonstrate a curious result for the analytically tractable case of 2-period orbits in the replicator map. In particular, we prove the following.\nProposition 2. A two-period orbit of the replicator map for two-player two-strategy game is an ISO.\nProof. Consider a periodic orbit {x\u0302(1), x\u0302(2)} and note that, by definition, \u2206x\u0302(1)\u2206x\u0302(2) < 0. If we consider the two points of the periodic orbit to be well-separated and a state x(1) in the infinitesimal small neighbourhood of x\u0302(1), then we expect \u2206x(1)\u2206x(2) < 0\u2014even if the periodic orbit is unstable, as long as x(2) (the state to which x(1) is mapped) is in small neighbourhood of x\u0302(2), far away from x(1). We should always be able to write\n\u2206x(1)\u2206x(2) + 2\u2211 j=1 ( Hx(2) Hx(j) ) \u2206x(j) ( x(1) \u2212 x\u0302(1) ) < 0 (D1)\nbecause the second term in the left hand side can be made infinitesimally small by taking x(1) \u2192 x\u0302(1) as the\nheterogeneity factor is a positive quantity. Rewriting this equation, we arrive at\n2\u2211 j=1 (Hx(j)) \u22121 \u2206x(j)(x(j) \u2212 x\u0302(1)) < 0, (D2)\nwhich may be further rewritten using the replicator map to yield\n2\u2211 j=1 (x(j) \u2212 x\u0302(1)) [ f1(x (j))\u2212 f2(x(j)) ] < 0. (D3)\nThis equation is equivalent to the ISO condition for 2- period orbits.\nThus, it appears that a 2-period orbit is ISO irrespective of its stability property (and hence Proposition 1 naturally follows from Proposition 2). However, the fraction of mutants required to invade ISO has to be comparatively larger for the case of stable 2-period orbits. It must be kept in mind that the analytically tractable case of the 2-period orbits of the replicator map appears to be very special in this respect: It remains to be proven that how much of this discussion goes over to the higher period orbits in arbitrary escort-incentive dynamics.\n[1] N.
