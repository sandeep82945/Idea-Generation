    "abstractText": "Changeability analysis methods primarily assist with formulating a response to uncertain and new requirements from various system stakeholders and include asset management issues such as modelling lifecycle path dependency. Epoch-era networks proved to be an effective tool for managing the evolving requirements of a capability system, ensuring sustained value through life. Over the life of a system, stakeholders are faced with countless options to change their capability systems to sustain value, which is path dependent and can greatly impact the scope of decisions available later in life. This paper introduces and demonstrates the application of a revised epochera network approach to explore many potential lifecycle paths, along with utility vs. expense strategies, demonstrated through an example of a military frigate subject to evolving requirements. Results indicated the future limitations to sustaining value if the largest and most capable technology upgrades are selected too early in life. The two best lifecycle paths from different strategies were compared to understand the utility/expense trade-offs for the most optimal frigate upgrade trajectory.",

            "text": "Changeability is a characteristic of complex engineered systems for meeting the demands from evolving requirements [1,2]. Changeability seeks to ensure systems sustain their value by meeting new requirements within the desired cost. Changeability is a concept closely related to resilience which is the ability of systems to bounce back in the presence of disruptions. However, changeability, more accurately, is regarded as one of the contributing factors to the system resilience [3]. Systems with long service lives are likely to encounter changes from evolving technologies, fluctuating markets, new threats, varying needs, and shrinking budgets [1]. The value sustainment in the face of such changes can be seen as future-proofing [2,4]. The only certainty of these future requirements is their uncertainty. In a military context, for example, the future requirements change when strategic and tactical operational scenarios become updated based on geological force field topological evolution. Changeability concepts provide a risk mitigation strategy for appropriately managing such uncertainties through the life of a system [5]. Changeability concepts are enabled in systems via change mechanisms [6]. Change mechanisms such as modularity, interoperability, reconfigurability, and margins allow the physical change in a system to take effect [1]. For clarity, margins are design overspecifications concerning the minimum required requirements. Figure 1 shows the relationship between various changeability elements. To achieve changeability in systems, designers must consider factors such as modularization, flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. The design must be modular, allowing for components to be added or removed as needed, and must be flexible enough to accommodate new requirements. Additionally, the system should be scalable, able to adapt to changes in the size or complexity of the problem being addressed, and maintainable, allowing for easy updates and repairs. Modularity and flexibility are closely related\nSystems 2023, 11, 183. https://doi.org/10.3390/systems11040183 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/systems\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 2 of 24\nfactors that contribute to the changeability of a system.

An epoch is a time period bounding a singular set of contexts and stakeholder preferences [7]. Likewise, an era is the stringing together of epochs to form a representative system lifecycle identified by a significant change of context [7]. Several hindrances may be observed when applying EEA for lifecycle path analysis of already in-service systems. These hindrances relate to the significance of system path dependence, essential to lifecycle path analysis. Indeed, the concept of path dependence has been briefly introduced in seminal work of Ross [7]. However, there is still a gap in applying such a concept to in-service systems, a goal that this paper aims to achieve. To our best knowledge, no paper has addressed the issue of applying changeability analysis to existi g systems which can be challenging due to several reasons:\n(1) Existing systems may not have been designed with changeability in mind. When a system is designed and implemented, the design choices made at that time can limit the ability of the system to change or evolve over time. These limitations may not\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 3 of 24\nbecome apparent until the system needs to be modified, and the cost of making these modifications can be high.\n(2) Existing systems may not have been well-documented, making it difficult to understand how the system works or how changes might impact the system. This lack of documentation can make it challenging to identify areas of the system that are most in need of change or to understand how changes might impact other parts of the system. (3) Another factor that can make it difficult to apply changeability analysis to existing systems is the lack of a clear understanding of the system\u2019s requirements or the environment in which it operates. If the system\u2019s requirements or operating environment have changed since the system was designed, the original design may no longer be appropriate, and changes may be required to ensure that the system continues to meet its intended goals. (4) The cost of making changes to an existing system can be high, both in terms of time and resources. This cost can make it difficult to justify making changes to the system, particularly if the benefits of those changes are not clear.\nThese factors overall render the system sensitive to the path or order of implementing system changes. Path dependence is critical to the appropriate analysis of certain in-service systems, such as warships. Path dependence can be studied at tactical or strategic levels. At the tactical level, optimum mission planning is essential for minimizing the cost and maximising the utility [10]. At the strategic level, warships experience a change to their physical characteristics once modified. For example, the addition of a new weapons system increases the ship\u2019s mass, which in turn, affects the overall ship\u2019s performance. Hence, the system baseline characteristics change through time in an ordered manner, and therefore its performance against evolving requirements is path-dependent. To suitably perform lifecycle path analysis on in-service systems, all conceivable lifecycles must be analysed to better inform stakeholders. Epoch-era networks can assist stakeholders in appropriately managing and planning the lifecycle path of an in-service warship once acquired. Guided by short- or long-term design strategies, such as maximising system utility, stakeholders can identify optimal lifecycle paths that respond effectively to evolving technological and operational requirements. In this manner, epoch-era networks can provide evidence-based advice for warship upgrades, redesign, or new operational requirements that can be feasibly met by the warship\u2019s margins, ensuring current and future sustained value. This paper proposes and demonstrates a network-driven approach to capture system path dependence with the application of EEA to perform lifecycle path analysis on an in-service warship. In linking a series of upgrade paths progressing sequentially through epochs, a lifecycle path can be developed. A representation of all potential lifecycle paths for a single warship form what is referred to herein as an epoch-era network. System dependency is explicitly accounted for within epoch-era networks since the end of one upgrade path from an epoch forms the new baseline design from which the next upgrade path follows in the subsequent epoch. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a background literature review on system changeability within the context of various engineering industries; Section 3 details the revised method for application with in-service systems and introduces the epoch-era network; Section 4 is a demonstration case study followed by results and discussion about various implementable strategies in Section 5; the paper concludes in Section 6."

            "text": "Asset Management (AM) includes activities to support effective decision-making that optimises the service delivery potential of an asset whilst minimizing risks and costs throughout their service lives [11]. Frolov [11] states that historically these activities focus on decisions related to system maintainability, reliability, and availability. Extending this notion, El-Akruti [12] recommends that AM should be applied more holistically encompassing all lifecycle activities. These activities should include those that support system\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 4 of 24\nimprovements or upgrades to maintain or improve service delivery or performance [13]. Such outcomes are like those achieved by performing changeability analysis on in-service systems. However, the AM literature is not rich with activities comparable to changeability analysis that can help ensure the sustained value of an asset through life. In this sense, the proposed outcomes of changeability analysis in this paper complement holistic AM activities. Implementing changeability into system architectures was a concept originally idealized by Fricke et al. [14] to efficiently manage changes in needs and requirements over the lifespan of a system. Such changes typically result from dynamic marketplaces, technology evolution, and varying environments [5,15]. In response to such changes, changeability may be defined as the ability of a system to alter its state to meet new requirements and/or expectations [2]. Through altering states, the system may change form, function, or operation. Change is a necessary response enabling the system to sustain value, as opposed to becoming obsolescent [1,16]. Changeability is achieved according to a semantic set of system characteristics and \u201c-ilities\u201d commonly including, but not limited to flexibility, adaptability, robustness, scalability, modifiability, margins, interoperability, reconfigurability, and modularity [1,16]. Literature regarding this semantic set has largely emerged as an ambiguous discourse for a common definition and application of each -ility, and their relationships to each other [17]. Aiming to remove these ambiguities, Ross and Rhodes [9] introduced the change agent-effect-mechanism framework providing a suitable foundation for appropriately defining and applying changeability and its many interrelated concepts. In this framework, flexibility and adaptability are distinguished by either an external or internal agent, respectively, regarding their location to the system boundary, initiating the change in the system [6]. For example, [18] related the flexibility of a fleet of aircraft to their reliability and availability. Instigating a change affects the design parameters comprising a system in some quantifiable way. [6] further categorize these effects as either robust, scalable, or modifiable resulting in a system where the design parameters: remain constant, are individually increased, or are added to/subtracted from the set, respectively, in response to meeting new requirements. Of more importance to the application of changeability are the change mechanisms that physically enable the change effects to be realized. Dwyer [1] identifies a common set of change mechanisms of relevance to engineered systems including margins, interoperability, reconfigurability, and modularity; further details on each of these change mechanisms can be found in [19\u201322], respectively (see Figure 1). Each mechanism facilitates a distinctive set of path enablers (change paths) comprising associated conditions, resources, and constraints available to the system [9]. For example, if the margin is the mechanism, then a weight margin is the path enabler. Additionally, specific low-level transition rules may be defined for each path enabler. A transition rule for a weight margin path enabler may be fuel storage weight growth. Transition rules affect and therefore provide a direct mapping to design parameters [6]. In this manner, the impact of transition rules on the system architecture, and therefore its performance, can be determined."

            "text": "Changeability analysis methods have evolved alongside the increasing need to model uncertainties associated with requirements creep and operational scenario changes affecting the value of complex engineered systems over their service lives. A widely adopted method for commercial applications is Real Options Analysis (ROA). ROA is commonly used to financially value the inclusion of incorporating changeability into the design of engineered systems [23\u201325]. Nonetheless, ROA oversimplifies the problem of changeability analysis, inheriting many assumptions from its roots in financial theory, reducing its applicability to the physical systems [26]. Change Propagation Analysis (CPA) has also emerged as an adequate option for identifying high-value change mechanisms [19,27]. However, CPA is\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 5 of 24\nlimited to investigating a small number of change events and is unable to suitably perform lifecycle path analysis. A promising and recently well-adopted method is the Responsive Systems Comparison (RSC) method proposed by [28]. The RSC method combines Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE) and EEA, into a step-by-step approach. MATE is a conceptual design method combining multi-attribute utility theory and Tradespace exploration to aid in the evaluation of many system designs based on performance (utility) and cost attributes [29]. EEA provides a temporal extension to the traditionally static context and preference-orientated MATE method [30]. This is achieved by capturing a snapshot of context and preference-derived design requirements in a single epoch (epoch variables), and sequencing epochs together (forming a system era) to produce a time-orientated framework whereby methods such as MATE can be operationalized throughout [9]. The first iteration of the RSC method contains a set of seven processes designed to guide the analyst through various insights regarding changeability and sustained value; they are [28]: (1) context definition\u2014identify the problem/needs statement and important contextual factors; (2) design formulation\u2014elicit the stakeholder needs statement (attributes) and formulate system concepts (design variables); (3) epoch characterization\u2014parameterize key contextual and perceptual uncertainties to produce epoch variables; (4) design Tradespace evaluation\u2014develop knowledge via modelling and simulation of how design variables map to system concepts and attributes producing value in response to the context and perceptions of an epoch; (5) multi epoch analyses\u2014the performance of many system concepts is evaluated across many contexts and preferences; (6) era construction\u2014system eras are constructed from the sequencing of static epochs to evaluate concepts in dynamic contexts and preferences; (7) lifecycle path analysis\u2014strategies for ensuring systems can maintain value over lifecycles (eras) are produced. Schaffner, et al. [31] extended the RCS method, analysing system concepts in single epochs, single-eras, and multi-eras more explicitly and comprehensively. While [32] develops these processes into new steps, they may also be recognized as sub-steps as part of wider scoped epoch-analysis and era-analysis steps. Furthermore, [32] omits lifecycle path analysis, integrating this process into multi-era analysis, and reducing its effectiveness as a standalone process for identifying the optimal path a system shall follow in response to uncertain lifecycle demands. The Filtered Outdegree (FOD) method in various forms which treat the traditional Tradespace as a network has been used effectively to complement the RSC method [33,34]. The Tradespace network comprises nodes and arcs representing system concepts and transition paths, respectively. A path allows a concept to change from one state to another via a transition rule. Applying cost/resource thresholds to arcs, the outdegree of a node (the number of feasible paths it can take) can be filtered. The Tradespace network concept is a critical enabler in effectively performing lifecycle path analysis. The method provides a means for explicitly modelling system path dependence by linking all possible system end states through many potential lifecycles, thus facilitating the development of an epochera network."

            "heading": "2.2. Applying Changeability Analysis Methods to In-Service Systems",
            "text": "Applications for changeability analysis of engineered systems are often biased toward the design and development of new systems. Ross and Hastings [35] applied the FOD method to the design of a satellite, weapons system, and an on-orbit observatory. Refs. [33,34] utilized EEA and a modified FOD measure to support the design of a highly changeable satellite radar system. Fitzgerald et al. [26,36] employed EEA and a set of Pareto-based metrics to select a single or set of space-tug designs that can maintain a high value. Refs. [37,38] applied the FOD concept and EEA, respectively, to explore the benefits of various path enablers in improving the changeability of a commercial ship for increased value. To the best of our knowledge, EEA was never conducted for an existing system,\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 6 of 24\nwhich is a novel contribution of this paper. In this paper, the characteristics below are considered in a changeability analysis framework:\n1. System path dependence: akin to the butterfly effect, the lifecycle path of an existing system is dependent on the system\u2019s response to evolving requirements through time; had one system design decision been made differently, the system\u2019s performance for its remaining service life may be drastically altered. Hence, it is critical to understand the consequences of all perceivable decisions. Since many decisions are available to stakeholders in response to a new set of requirements, decision-makers can only be sure of the best decision if all possible design alternatives and consequent lifecycle paths are understood. Applying this understanding, decisions that increase value in the short-term (e.g., major technology upgrade) though inhibit further increases in value in the long-term (e.g., consume all margins preventing future upgrades) can be avoided, allowing all decisions to be optimised for lifecycle value. However, the current state of the EEA (Ross & Rhodes, 2008) does not allow for a full enumeration of path-dependent system lifecycles. This work pays particular attention to path dependency, as an addition to the EEA framework. 2. Issue of short-term underperforming designs: the generation of all possible lifecycle paths, dependent upon a proposed sequence of context and perception-driven requirements, yields many possible system end states. A subset of these system end states may underperform against a subset of contexts and preferences. In the traditional application of EEA, a strategy or goal is applied to each epoch individually [9]. The best performing system end state(s) for that strategy is (are) selected, initializing the creation of a new epoch to analyse the selected system state(s). In this manner, underperforming system end states are not analysed further, and stakeholders fail to gain knowledge of their subsequent performance in later epochs. It is possible that underperforming design options in the short-term evolve to become the bestperforming designs in the long term. While [7,9] acknowledge this concept as an important consideration for the current state of EEA, the concept can only be suitably achieved through a full enumeration of path-dependent system lifecycles. 3. Changing the change variables: The fundamental principle of changeability analysis implies that complex engineered systems need to change over time as a strategic response to maintain value. Such systems, however, change by adding/upgrading subsystems, which may be regarded as complex systems in their own right. For example, [32] and [35] applied changeability analysis to the conceptual design of a warship and missile system, respectively; albeit, the missile subsystem commonly evolves over the life of a warship. Factoring the rate at which subsystems change, i.e., their performance and physical specifications, is an important consideration to more accurately predict the impact of changes on a system. Accordingly, factoring subsystem changes compounds the importance of path dependence since the design parameters used for subsystem upgrades can become time-dependent. Combining system path dependence and the principles of change to both systems and subsystems in a single analysis can help rectify the hindrances of current changeability analysis methods. However, we emphasize that this work is not intended to consider all types of uncertainty. The only type of uncertainty of interest to this research is tactical uncertainty in operational scenarios of a system.\nThe next section proposes a revision of the RSC method with the aim of improving the overall applicability for supporting through-life changes to the asset and improving value sustainment. Historically, evaluations tend to only occur during the initial design phase, but assets such as warships often undergo smaller incremental changes without going through a complete EEA and Tradespace analysis. As there is also a strong likelihood that initial assumptions/variables have become clearer, better known, and less ambiguous (due to the passage of time), it is proposed that the revised RSC method would provide better up-to-date results throughout the lifespan of the asset, and potentially better prepare the warship for future epochs-related requirements.\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 7 of 24"

Resource available to each stakeholder are identified forming resource thresholds for which the feasibility of system configurations (new system end states) is assessed. Existing systems, t various degrees, have already been subject to the design formulation process of step 2.2. As such, their attributes, utility, and expense functions have previously been established. Therefore, the design definition process of step 2.1 involves\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 8 of 24\nidentifying the presence of any new performance attributes concerning stakeholders in response to the existing system changing states. Importantly, this process requires the identification of path enablers and transition rules present in the existing system. New attributes should capture the system\u2019s ability to meet original expectations. Revised utility functions are defined for these attributes depicting stakeholder preferences. Similarly, expense functions are defined from stakeholder resources, including those required to execute identified transition rules. Next, system configuration concepts are proposed enabling the identification of Design Variables (DVs) and subsequent ranges for each variable. The impact of system path dependence is defined in this step. Stakeholders must identify the path-dependent DVs throughout changing epochs. For example, an obvious pathdependent DV is system mass. To better understand this, stakeholders should consider this question: does the value of a DV depend upon the state of the system at the culmination of prior contexts and needs? If so, this affects how Epoch Variables (EVs) are mapped to DVs in the following steps. Utilizing the contextual uncertainties and value propositions captured from step 1, specific future contexts that will affect the value of the system are developed in step 3. EVs are parameterized from high-level context-specific scenarios and associated preferences. EVs are typically decomposed by a high-level uncertainty category, a lower-level variable identifier, enumerated range/levels, and units. If an EV is subject to change as time progresses, the rate at which the EV changes can be factored into EV ranges/levels. This can be achieved using a growth factor altering the EV level within an epoch concerning the progression of epochs and their duration. If system path dependence must be modelled, the EVs that affect path-dependent DVs must be identified. For example, an EV for upgrading subsystem hardware will affect the system\u2019s mass (the DV). These EVs and DVs will be modelled uniquely in the following step."

For existing systems, resultant utility and expense functions can then be used to generate a utility vs. expense Tradespace comprising unique system configurations. The basic process of generating each Tradespace for an existing system is illustrated in Figure 3, which utilizes two models, respectively, for utility and expense.

The most important challenges in applying this method to any system as demonstrated here for the case of frigates are as follows:\n(1) Acquiring information about system parameters (that are usually well documented for defence systems and not so well for other systems) is a challenge; (2) Assessment of cost of changes might not be knowable a priori in the case of some systems. This is because changes are not planned in advance for some existing systems, so the cost issue becomes a major challenge;\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 11 of 24\n(3) Assessing the value of changes relative to future requirements is also a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the value evaluations for three neatly defined requirements that are gearing the vessel for anti-air and anti-submarine operations. However, these requirements might not be as clear for other systems and might be accompanied by ambiguities which make the changes in value estimation challenging.\nFor this case study, the revised RSC method from Figure 2 is applied to an existing generic frigate. Warship upgrade planning is one of the costliest activities carried out by the defence. To this end, any cost savings that may also increase the utility of the warships is of huge interest both to the defence and the public. In this case study, we demonstrate exactly how this value optimisation and/or cost saving might be carried out during the planned upgrades of warships. The original baseline characteristics of the frigate are detailed in Table 1. For step 1, the frigate is subject to changing technological and operational requirements over an indicative 21-year service life. In this generic example, the frigate will be subjected to upgrades approximately every 7 years, which might be due to a change in operations, or a new operating environment. In this example, three epochs are considered: the first epoch between year 1 and year 7, the second epoch from year 7 to year 14, and the third epoch from year 14 to 21. Respectively, there are three planned technology gearing and upgrades the first of which takes place at year zero or before start of operation. Changes in operations and new operating environments are mandatory, while stakeholders have the option to install any combination of available technologies as part of an upgrade. Epoch-era networks are applied to determine the best set of lifecycle paths, or technology upgrade trajectories, for the frigate through the exploration of various utility/expense strategies and resource thresholds."

The frigate relies on margins as the key change mechanism comprising a set of path enablers accommodating changes to the system\u2019s physical characteristics including mass, space, power, cooling, and data. Margins are excess or reserve capacities in design parameters that provide a buffer for absorbing change. Margins herein are either presented as the available value remaining or the limit of the design parameter until no further changes can be absorbed. For this case study, mass- and space-related margin enablers were employed. From the space margin path enabler, two transition rules were defined: (1) area margin\u2014the available deck area for upgrading and adding new technology; (2) volume margin\u2014the available compartment volume for upgrading and adding new technology. The availability of space margins for the frigate was defined in Table 2. From the mass margin path enabler, two transition rules were defined: (1) system mass margin\u2014the maximum overall system mass allowable regarding strength limitations; (2) Vertical Centre of Gravity (VCG) margin\u2014the maximum height of the frigate\u2019s centre of gravity allowable regarding stability limitations. The upper limits to mass margins were defined in Table 2.

Furthermore, this negation might render some paths incomprehensible. Here, we forego the assumption that such conflict between attributes exists. Moving on, four utility attributes were defined: one about the frigate\u2019s capability as a result of installed technology, and three about the frigate\u2019s performance in an environment. The combination of technologies installed on the frigate, and their individual performance, provide the frigate with a weapons and sensor suite suitable to meet respective warfare capabilities. The more technologies installed and upgraded over all epochs, represented by a scale from 0 (none) to 1 (all possible), the better the technological capability of the frigate. A Sea Keeping (SK) utility is based on the frigate\u2019s motion response in a certain sea state at\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 13 of 24\ncruising speed. A multi-criteria SK operability was used to determine the SK performance. A resistance utility was based on the frigate\u2019s combined (calm water + added resistance in waves) resistance in a certain sea state at the cruising speed for head seas. A stability utility was based on the distance between the frigate\u2019s VCG and Metacentric Height (GM); the greater the GM, the more stable the ship in general. The GM is affected by shifting VCGs and mass. Four expense attributes each relating to the consumption and remaining availability of margin-based transition rules were defined. A greater expense is attributed to greater consumption of margins since it is undesirable for stakeholders to consume more than the availability and limits of the margins. A 100% margin consumption would require a costly change to increase margins or add new change mechanisms. Weightings for the multi-attribute utility and expense measures are detailed in Table 3. A suite of physics-based ship performance models was used to simulate the frigates\u2019 attributes based on a set of DVs [42]. Table 4 lists the design variables used to synthesise new system configurations that can achieve the defined utility attributes. The path-dependent DVs were identified and are notated by (a) in Table 4. Mass and VCG are both path-dependent variables that vary according to the number and locations of various installed technologies. All technologies are path-dependent because once installed, they become permanent and exhibit a level of performance respective to the time they were installed. Each technology was either already installed on the frigate and was therefore subject to upgrades or needs to be installed."

Since no constraints were applied\nin Figure 9a, every possible upgrade option for the frigate was available to the stakehold-\ners.\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 18 of 24\nFigure 9a shows only the optimal lifecycle paths. In this Figure, the thickness of the line represents edge weights and the most optimal path to achieving the chosen lifecycle strategy. All lifecycle paths in Figure 9a are in lieu of the stakeholder\u2019s constraints for utility and expense attributes. Additionally, the numbering of the nodes follows the convention described at the start of Section 5. As expected, without consideration for expense attributes, the biggest upgrade configurations in general were selected in each epoch. Furthermore, Figure 9a suggests that the selection of bigger upgrades in earlier epochs contributes greatly to increased overall utility. This is evident since only C7 was selected in epoch 1. In epoch 2, C27, C29, and C30 containing four technology upgrade options and C31 (the maximum upgrade option) containing all five options (refer to Figure 6) were selected. Finally, a larger range of upgrades were available in epoch 3. This trend is logical because paths from Figure 9a represent ship upgrade trajectories that have the most frequently upgraded and therefore most capable technologies. However, this increase in capability must come at a cost. The difference in the overall mass of the ship due to different technology upgrade trajectories results in the best lifecycle path, C0.7.31.7 from Figure 9a, being 36 tons heavier than the worst lifecycle path, C0.7.31.4. Increased mass typically negatively affects performance and consumes margins. Since no constraints were applied in Figure 9a, every possible upgrade option for the frigate was available to the stakeholders. In terms of the epoch-era network, this meant that for every configuration (node) in one epoch, all possible configurations (nodes) in the next epoch were available. The possibility to reach new nodes from a source node is referred to as an outdegree, as described before. Applying thresholds to the utility or expense attributes associated with each new node allows the filtered outdegree concept to be implemented with epoch-era networks. This allows stakeholders to tailor strategies to ensure performance or margin constraints are not being violated. Applying an upper threshold to the maximum height of the frigate\u2019s vertical centre of gravity (VCG) from Figure 9a, a typical physical limitation for ships, a significantly different set of best lifecycle paths occurs. In Figure 9b where the VCG filter is applied, only one lifecycle path from Figure 9a remains below the physical limitation for the frigates\u2019 maximum VCG. Interestingly, C4 was selected in epoch 1 and was not identified as a Pareto optimal solution in Figure 7. This shows that the application of the epoch-era network allows the identification of a larger set of potential optimal design decisions against changing stakeholder preferences, or imposed constraints. Results from Figure 10a demonstrate the long-term impacts of choosing the best set of design decisions against a static view of the requirements and preferences when physical constraints are applied. From Figure 10a, the maximum configuration option that can be feasibly selected in epoch 3 to maximise utility over the entire lifecycle was C3. Hence, the most capable ASuW upgrade option for stakeholders was restricted to only upgrading one technology item. Compared to being able to upgrade all the frigate\u2019s radar, automatic weapons system, and harpoon missile capability for the best possible ASuW capability, a strategy to maximise utility across all epochs significantly limits the frigate ASuW capability in epoch 3. Instead, the strategy can be tailored to emphasize certain attributes in a particular epoch. Figure 10a shows the resultant lifecycle paths if stakeholders were to modify the proposed strategy of maximising overall utility and try to especially maximise the frigate\u2019s ASuW capability in epoch 3. To maximise the utility in the final epoch given the VCG constraint, Figure 10a indicates that it was more beneficial to consider smaller technology upgrades in epoch 2. This is evident by comparing epoch 2 configurations between Figure 9a,b, where there is no option to upgrade the VLS and Seasparrow missiles (a major upgrade) in Figure 9b. This shows that certain upgrades have a far greater impact on certain constraints. However, if stakeholders decide the VLS and Seasparrow missiles must be upgraded in epoch 2, options exist to adjust constraints and enable the upgrade. For example, stakeholders could consider modifying the capacity of existing change mechanisms; adding new change mechanisms or easing constraints is explored next.\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 19 of 24\nSystems 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 24\nexample, stakeholders could consider modifying the capacity of existing change mecha-\nnisms; adding new change mechanisms or easing constraints is explored next.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 10.

Compared to the maximising overall utility strategy from Figure 9a with the same VCG constraint, several observations can be made about the associated expenses for the selected best configuration paths from Figure 12a. Interestingly, the biggest upgrade option from epoch 1 (C7) is presented as the most efficient.

The difference between MAE for either lifecycle path is larger than the difference for MAU, suggesting a proportionally higher price is paid for utility increases. The reason for this can be understood by investigating the individual expense and utility attributes. There was a significantly higher VCG expense associated with C0.7.31.3 compared to C0.7.15.3, and this larger expense was maintained from epoch 2 to 3 even though both experienced the same final ASuW epoch 3 upgrades (C3). Therefore, these results indicate that the main driver for increased expenses is due to VCG margin expenses. Hence, stakeholders should prioritize design activities to improve VCG margins as a preference to increase the ship\u2019s level of changeability.

This paper has demonstrated how the application of the revised responsive systems comparison method and epoch-era networks can inform stakeholders of the long-term cost-benefit consequences resulting from current and future design decisions for a proposed frigate.

Future proposed work includes analysis of multiple system eras and epoch-era networks for either a single existing warship or multiple warships. Such applications can better inform stakeholders of the best lifecycle path given a broader scope of future requirements and allow direct comparison of several warships with the highest degree of changeability. There are some limitations associated with this work including difficulty in constructing cost models and value models. Cost models are complex and can show over-sensitivity and chaotic properties. The Australian Navy puts a heavy emphasis on these cost models to manage the risks associated with sustaining its systems and capabilities including warships. There is difficulty in constructing value models, particularly in the face of new events that change the value model. Value models are often incorrect due to oversimplification and lack of understanding of the actual parameters affecting mission success in various scenarios. Added to this complexity is the more recent emphasis on interoperability between various capability types including unmanned systems of various types. The value models that are currently used in defence relate and correspond to conventional warfare. With the introduction of autonomous warfighting with swarming capabilities, the value of conventional capabilities is seriously being questioned. Additionally, the inclusion of all upgrades including maintenance parameters might be totally prohibitive leading to\nSystems 2023, 11, 183 22 of 24\nTradespaces that are too large to be useful. This is because Pareto optimality is meaningless in spaces characterised by too many parameters. Furthermore, the methodology is highly dependent on the operational scenarios; any event that might affect such scenarios can prohibit the changeability path to be sub-optimal or even way off the optimal path. In this sense uncertainty in future events could be a serious hurdle in operationalising an optimal changeability path. The incorporation of robust decision-making methodologies might prove useful in rectifying this issue. Robust decisions are sub-optimal by nature but correspond nicely to a wider range of likely operational scenarios. Lastly, the effect of the initial design on the meaningful application of this methodology needs to be considered. In-built flexibility and adaptability in the initial design of the warship enable meaningful incorporation of techniques such as that discussed in this paper. An adaptable design not only has enough margins for upgrades, but it also reduces the cost of upgrades, for example, by incorporating modular design concepts. The latter is the subject of ongoing research in several institutions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.D. and M.E.; methodology, D.D. and M.E.; software, D.D.; validation, D.D. and M.E.; formal analysis, D.D.; investigation, D.D. and M.E.; resources, D.D. and M.E.; data curation, D.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.E.; visualization, D.D.; supervision, M.E.
