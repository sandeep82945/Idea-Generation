    "abstractText": "A biological method was successfully applied to synthesize spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) while using the extract of lavender (Ex-L) (lat. Lavandula angustifolia) as the reducing and stabilizing agent. The produced nanoparticles were spherical with an average size of 20 nm. The AgNPs\u2019 synthesis rate confirmed the extract\u2019s excellent ability to reduce silver nanoparticles from the AgNO3 solution. The presence of good stabilizing agents was confirmed by the excellent stability of the extract. Nanoparticles\u2019 shapes and sizes did not change. UV-Vis absorption spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the silver nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles were incorporated into the PVA polymer matrix by the \u201cex situ\u201d method. The polymer matrix composite with AgNPs was prepared in two ways: as a composite film and nanofibers (nonwoven textile). The anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs and the ability of AgNPs to transfer toxic properties into the polymer matrix were proved.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology is one of the most exciting and fast-moving areas at present in science and research. Naturally occurring nanostructures are present around us in nature, in plants, and also in animals. Thanks to this, scientists can now produce nanoparticles by many methods. The nanoparticles can be synthesized in two main ways: \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d and \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d [1]. Thanks to these methods, we can obtain nanomaterials with the required shapes, sizes, and special properties. In the \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d method, various procedures such as milling, etching, or sputtering are used; in the \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d method, reducing agents, stabilizing agents, and solvents are used for the synthesis of nanoparticles [2]. The \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d methods also include chemical reduction and the so-called green synthesis methods (biological methods). Often, the chemical synthesis technique results in the adsorption of some harmful compounds on the surface of the nanoparticle, which might have a detrimental effect on medical applications [3]. Thanks to their ecological advantages, the biosynthesis of nanoparticles has recently come to the forefront [4]. Metal nanoparticles can be easily, ecologically, and cost-effectively created using extracts from plants, fungi, microorganisms, yeast, algae, etc. Green methods are more popular mainly because of the absence of toxic solvents that are difficult to degrade. Therefore, green synthesis appears to be a good alternative to conventional methods of AgNP synthesis, which are widely used in various industries, such as medicine, biology, electrical technology, and others. The significance of nanoparticles is that they have different properties compared with the bulk material of the same class. A nanoparticle is a particle that ranges between 1 and\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1238. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15051238 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1238 2 of 11\n100 nanometers (1\u2013100 nm) [5]. For the properties and use of nanoparticles, their size and shape are decisive. The worldwide alarming multi-resistance to antibiotics creates the need for effective strategies to fight against bacteria. AgNPs represent a new approach to fighting and eliminating microorganisms. AgNPs have antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-angiogenic, and anti-cancer activities. Currently, much of the research synthesizes AgNPs by various methods and tests their anti-biofilm activity on various gram+ and gram- bacteria, various viruses and fungi, and others [6]. They also have excellent optical, physical, chemical, and electrical properties [7]. There are many ways to prepare nanoparticles using green synthesis techniques. For example, Kumar et al. described a biosynthesis using lavender leaf extract utilizing 4-nitrophenol and H2O2 and NaBH4 in addition to AgNO3 [8]. Hasanin et al. also successfully prepared silver nanoparticles using an extract from the overground parts of Lavandula coronopifolia and AgNO3 precursor [9,10]. The main goal of incorporating nanoparticles into the polymer matrix is to expand the area of possible applications of colloidal AgNPs and to develop a nanocomposite with better properties that depend on the properties of the filler (NPs). A polymer nanocomposite (PNC) is a complex of the matrix and the filler. PNCs represent a new class of materials with wide applications [11,12]. Polymers such as nylon, polyurethane (PU), polybenzimidazole (PBI), polycarbonate (PC), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly lactic acid (PLA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly-methacrylate (PMMA), polyethylene oxide (PEG), polyaniline (PANI), polystyrene (PS), collagen, chitosan, chitin, cellulose, etc., can be used as matrixes [13]. There are many methods for the production of nanocomposites; the basic methods are \u201cin situ\u201d and \u201cex situ\u201d. The difference between the \u201cin situ\u201d and \u201cex situ\u201d methods is the method of adding the secondary phase. With the \u201cin situ\u201d method, nanoparticles are formed directly in the matrix during the production of the composite. With the \u201cex situ\u201d method, the secondary phase is prefabricated separately and then added to the polymer matrix. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the \u201cex situ\u201d method is due to the fact that we know the size and shape of the added nanoparticles in advance. Methods such as dip-coating, spin-coating, casting, or electrospinning enable easy preparation of the final product of nanocomposites (thin layers, nanofibers, etc.) [13]. The electrospinning process is one of the most cost-effective and efficient techniques for the production of micro- and nano-diameter fibers [14,15]. Silver nanoparticles opened a new era of material in the nanoscale. The application of nanoparticles is very wide thanks to their small size and large surface. They are characterized by unique properties such as physical, chemical, optical, catalytic, electrical, thermal, high electrical conductivity properties, and many others. Due to their special properties, they are used for several applications, including antibacterial agents, in industrial, household, medical, and consumer products, and as coatings for medical devices, optical sensors, and cosmetics [7]. They are also used in the pharmaceutical industry, the food industry, diagnostics, orthopedics, and drug delivery. Recently, AgNPs have been widely used in many textiles, offices, wound bandages, and biomedical devices. They can replace the antibiotics that are used in the treatment of artificial implants and that cause a dependence in their users. Silver was used in the past, e.g., for food conservation and wound healing. Silver nanoparticles not only have the same properties as bulk silver they can also be designed to be selective against bacteria and pathogens and friendly to skin cells [6]. The aim of this work was to prepare a polymer nanocomposite doped with AgNPs. Conventional methods of producing nanomaterials use expensive chemical and physical processes that utilize materials with potential risks, such as toxicity, cytotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Nanoparticles were fabricated by green synthesis, which is ecological, inexpensive, time-saving, and effective. Silver is known for its excellent antibacterial\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1238 3 of 11\nproperties, and the goal was to transfer these properties to a non-toxic PVA matrix. We assumed that the incorporation of silver nanoparticles into the PVA matrix would change the properties of the polymer. This should increase the application possibilities of PVA."

Comparison of the IR spectra of dried lavender leaf extract and AgNPs colloid prepared by the dry lavender leaf extract.\nThe absorption band at 1560 cm\u22121 observed in the extract and AgNPs colloid sample may be due to amide I and amide II formed through carbonyl and -N-H stretch vibrations in the amide linkages of proteins, respectively. The 1420 cm\u22121 band corresponds to the CO-H group. Absorption bands around 1263 cm\u22121 and 1052 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the CO valence vibrations of the ester groups [24,25] or to the C-N valence vibrations of the amine groups, respectively.

Ahmed et al., in their work, described that the presence of long-chain hydrocarbons and polar ester linkage supports better stabilization [27]. The lower bands at 586 and 530 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the alkyl halides such as C-Cl stretching found in anthocyanin flavonoids [23], which are present in the leaf extract as well as in the AgNP colloid. Lavender also contains gallic acid (phenolic flavonoids). As can be seen from the FTIR analysis, the leaf extract has a very complex composition; therefore, it is difficult to determine which components are responsible for the reduction of Ag+ ions to silver nanoparticles and which for the stabilization. Based on the other authors\u2019 results and our observations, free groups present in proteins and flavonoids found in leaf extracts are responsible for the reduction of Ag+ ions.

The presence of AgNPs in the solution was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. UV-Vis analysis is a simple, reliable method to prove the presence of nanoparticles in solutions. Based on the shape and location of the SPR band, the size, size distribution, and shape of the nanoparticles can be approximately determined. A colloidal solution of spherical silver nanoparticles is typical of the maximum surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band in the wavelength interval of 350\u2013450 nm [8,28]. Solutions that do not contain nanoparticles (input solutions and control solutions) do not show any peaks; the SPR curves of such solutions are reported by other authors in their papers [29,30]. After synthesizing spherical nanoparticles, they observed the formation of peaks at ~450 nm.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1238 6 of 11\nThe strong, slim peak of the SPR band with an absorption maximum (ABSmax) at a wavelength of 424 nm was measured. Based on this, it is possible to assume the formation of spherical silver nanoparticles. The same conclusion from the SPR band for silver nanoparticles prepared by green synthesis was reported by Kumar et al. [31]. An important property of nanoparticle colloids is their stability, which depends on several factors, such as the presence of stabilizing substances in the extracts and storage conditions. To evaluate the long-term stability, the prepared AgNP colloid solution was divided into two flasks where one of them was stored in the refrigerator (L-Cold) and the second at room temperature (L-RT). Figure 3a,b show the SPR bands of both L-Cold and L-RT colloids measured on the 1st; 7th; 14th; and 21st day. Figure 3a shows the SPR bands of the colloidal solution L-Cold. Based on the shape and position of SPR bands which are slim, symmetrical, and stable, it can be concluded that the nanoparticles were in a narrow size interval distribution and stable during the whole experiment.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 11\nThe presence of AgNPs in the solution was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. UV-Vis analysis is a simple, reliable method to prove the presence of nanoparticles in solutions. Based on the shape and location of the SPR band, the size, size distribution, and shape of the nanoparticles can be approximately determined. A colloidal solution of spherical silver nanoparticles is typical of the maximum surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band in the wavelength interval of 350\u2013450 nm [8,28]. Solutions that do not contain nanoparticles (input solutions and control solutions) do not show any peaks; the SPR curves of such solutions are reported by other authors in their papers [29,30]. After synthesizing spherical nanoparticles, they observed the formation of peaks at ~450 nm. The strong, sli t e SPR band with an absorption maximum (ABSmax) at a wavelength of 424 nm was measur d. Based on this, it is possible t assume the formation of spherical ilv n noparticles. The same conclusion from the SPR band for silver nanoparticles prepared by gre n synth sis was r ported by Kumar et al. [31].

UV-Vis spectrum of AgNPs prepared using Ex-L stored in the cold (a) and stored at room temperature (b).\nFigure 3b shows a comparison of colloidal solutions stored at room temperature. It is well known that silver nanoparticles are sensitive to light. It is clear that the solution of silver nanoparticles stored at RT was not stable. A decrease in ABSmax was observed over time, indicating degradation by dissolution or agglomeration of the nanoparticles. At the end of the experiment, sediment was also observed at the bottom of the flask; therefore, the agglomeration of nanoparticles can be assumed. It is clear that storage conditions significantly affect the stability of AgNP colloids. Cold storage provides better stability. Based on the stability results, cold-stored nanoparticles were used for further experiments."

In our c se, 75% of nanop rticles had a diameter of up to 20 nm, and th maximum measured diameter was 50 nm. Ac ordi g to the sults, where th inhibi on zone of 9.3 mm was measured, the presence of 75% of small nanoparticles e sures very good anti-biofilm activity (Figure 7a).\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1238 9 of 11\nOn the other side, the extract was not toxic at all; we suggested that the lavender does not contain toxic compounds, Figure 7b. Pei Lin et al. found the same results as us. They tested the antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles and the lavender extract showed no inhibition zone [36]. The fibers also showed a significant inhibition zone, Figure 7c. The thin film showed only a weak inhibition zone, Figure 7d. The reason for better antibiofilm activity, in the case of fibers, is the fact that nanoparticles in the fibers were placed both inside the fibers and on the surface. In the case of thin film, the nanoparticles were surrounded by a PVA matrix, preventing their direct contact with the algae cells."

            "text": "The aim of the work was to prepare silver nanoparticles by a green method and incorporate them into the polymer matrix. We proved that the extract prepared from lavender leaves is able to synthesize AgNPs. Of the prepared nanoparticles, 75% reached up to an average size of 20 nm. It is obvious from the results that the nanoparticles were stable for up to 21 days, constituting long-term stability. Prepared AgNPs were successfully incorporated into the polymer matrix by an ex situ method. A PVA-AgNP composite was used for nanofiber and thin-layer production. After the incorporation of AgNPs into a non-toxic matrix, the anti-biofilm activity (on algae Ch. kessleri) was proved. The inhibition zones were 9.3 mm for the AgNP colloidal solution, 8.9 mm for the fibers, and 5.4 mm for the thin film. It is obvious that silver nanoparticles prepared using lavender leaf extract in the form of a colloidal solution show high anti-biofilm activity. The colloidal solution prepared this way has a wide range of uses. The produced nanofibers and thin layers doped with AgNPs can be widely used in several industries. Such composites protect against microorganisms in aqueous and humid environments, such as boats, food, fashion, and in the medical industry.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.M. and O.V.; methodology, L.M., O.V., E.M., M.V. and S.D.; validation, L.M. and O.V.; formal analysis, L.M., O.V., E.M., M.V. and S.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.M. and O.V.; visualization, O.V.
