            "text": "Theoretical and observational studies indicate that galaxies host at their centre a massive black hole (MBH) that has grown its mass predominantly through gas accretion (see e.g. Kormendy & Richstone 1995). A generic accretion flow may be broadly classified as quasi-spherical or axisymmetric, and what mainly determines the deviation from spherical symmetry is the angular momentum of the flow itself. A perfect spherical flow is evidently only possible when the angular momentum is exactly zero. Spherical models are a useful starting point for a more advanced modelling, and thus gas accretion toward a central MBH in galaxies is often modelled with the classical Bondi (1952) solution. For example, in semi-analytical models and cosmological simulations of the co-evolution of galaxies and their central MBHs, the mass supply to the accretion discs is linked to the temperature and density of their environment by making use of the Bondi accretion rate (see e.g. Fabian & Rees 1995; Volonteri & Rees 2005; Booth & Schaye 2009; Wyithe & Loeb 2012; Curtis & S\u0133acki 2015; Inayoshi, Haiman & Ostriker 2016). In fact, in most cases, the resolution of simulations cannot describe in detail the whole complexity of accretion, and so Bondi accretion does represent an important approximation to more realistic treatments (see e.g. Ciotti & Ostriker 2012; Barai et al. 2012; Ram\u00edrez-Velasquez et al. 2018; Gan et al. 2019 and references therein). Recently, Bondi accretion\nhas been generalised to include the effects on the flow of the gravitational field of the host galaxy and of electron scattering, at the same time preserving the (relative) mathematical tractability of the problem. Such a generalised Bondi problem has been applied to elliptical galaxies by Korol et al. (2016, hereafter KCP16), who discussed the case of a Hernquist (1990) galaxy model, for generic values of the polytropic index. Restricting to isothermal accretion, also taking into account the effects of radiation pressure due to electron scattering, Ciotti & Pellegrini (2017, hereafter CP17) showed that the whole accretion solution can be found analytically for the Jaffe (1983) and Hernquist galaxy models with a central MBH; quite remarkably, not only can the critical accretion parameter be explicitly obtained, but it is also possible to write the radial profile of the Mach number via the Lambert-Euler\ud835\udc4a- function (see e.g. Corless et al. 1996). Then, Ciotti & Pellegrini (2018, hereafter CP18) further extended the isothermal accretion solution to the case of Jaffe\u2019s two-component (stars plus dark matter) galaxy models (Ciotti & Ziaee Lorzad 2018, hereafter CZ18). In these \u2018JJ\u2019 models, a Jaffe stellar profile is embedded in a DM halo such that the total density distribution is also a Jaffe profile, and all the relevant dynamical properties can be written with analytical expressions. CP18 derived all accretion properties analytically, linking them to the dynamical and structural properties of the host galaxies. These previous results are summarised in Table 1.\nIn this paper we extend the study of CP18 to a different family of\n\u00a9 0000 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n05 05\n0v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n9 M\nar 2\ntwo-component galaxy models with a central MBH, in the general case of a polytropic gas. In this family (J3 models; Ciotti, Mancino & Pellegrini 2019, hereafter CMP19) the stellar density follows a Jaffe profile, while the total follows a \ud835\udc5f\u22123 law at large radii; thus the DM halo (resulting from the difference between the total and the stellar distributions) can reproduce the Navarro-Frenk-White profile (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997, hereafter NFW) at all radii. As we are concerned with polytropic accretion, we also clarify some thermodynamical aspect of the problem, not always stressed. In fact, it is obvious that for a polytropic index \ud835\udefe \u2260 \ud835\udefead (the adiabatic index of the gas, with \ud835\udefead = C \ud835\udc5d/C\ud835\udc49 ) the flow is not adiabatic, and heat exchanges with the environment are unavoidable. We investigate in detail this point, obtaining the expression of the radial profile of the heat exchange (i.e. radiative losses) of the fluid elements as they move towards the galaxy centre. Qualitatively, an implicit cooling/heating function is contained in the polytropic accretion when \ud835\udefe \u2260 \ud835\udefead.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we recall the main properties of the polytropic Bondi solution, and in Section 3 we list the main properties of the J3 models. In Section 4, we set up and discuss the polytropic Bondi problem in J3 galaxy models, while in Section 5, we investigate some important thermodynamical properties of accretion. The main results are finally summarised in Section 6, while some technical detail is given in the Appendix."

The radiation feedback, in the optically thin regime, can be implemented as a reduction of the gravitational force of the MBH by the factor\n\u03c7 \u2261 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc3fEdd , \ud835\udc3fEdd = 4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc40BH\ud835\udc5ap \ud835\udf0eT , (15)\nwhere \ud835\udc3f is the accretion luminosity, \ud835\udc3fEdd is Eddington\u2019s luminosity, \ud835\udc50 is the speed of light in vacuum, and \ud835\udf0eT = 6.65 \u00d7 10\u221225 cm2 is the Thomson cross section. The (relative) gravitational potential of the galaxy, in general, can be written as\n\u03a8g = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc40g \ud835\udc5fg \ud835\udf13\n( \ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc5fg\n) , (16)\nwhere \ud835\udc5fg is a characteristic scale length of the galaxy density distribution (stars plus dark matter), \ud835\udf13 is the dimensionless galaxy potential, and finally \ud835\udc40g is the total mass of the galaxy. For galaxies of infinite total mass, as the J3 models, \ud835\udc40g = Rg\ud835\udc40\u2217 is a mass scale (see equations (20) and (22)). By introducing the two parameters\nR \u2261 \ud835\udc40g \ud835\udc40BH , \ud835\udf09 \u2261 \ud835\udc5fg \ud835\udc5fB , (17)\nwhere \ud835\udc5fB is again defined as in equation (4), the total relative potential becomes\n\u03a8T = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc40BH \ud835\udc5fB [ \u03c7 \ud835\udc65 + R \ud835\udf09 \ud835\udf13 ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf09 )] . (18)\nOf course, when R \u2192 0 (or \ud835\udf09 \u2192 \u221e), the galaxy contribution to the total potential vanishes3, and the problem reduces to classical case. In the limit of \ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc3fEdd (i.e. \u03c7 = 0), the radiation pressure cancels the gravitational field of the MBH, then the problem describes accretion in the potential of the galaxy only, in absence of electron scattering and an MBH; when \ud835\udc3f = 0 (i.e. \u03c7 = 1), the radiation pressure has no effect on the accretion flow.

Of course,\u03a8g affects the values of \ud835\udc65min, \ud835\udc53min, and of the critical \u03bb (which now we call \u03bbt). Two considerations are in order here. Firstly, \u03a8g can produce more than one minimum for the function \ud835\udc53 (see the case of Hernquist galaxies in CP17); in this circumstance, the general considerations after equations (8) and (12) force to conclude that \u03bbt is determined by the absolute minimum of \ud835\udc53 . Secondly, for a generic galaxy model one cannot expect to be able to determine analytically the value of \ud835\udc65min; quite surprisingly, in a few cases it has been shown that this is possible (see CP18 and references therein). In the following we add another analytical case to this list."

Fractions of DM with values for the minimum halo case in agreement with those required by the dynamical modelling of earlytype galaxies (see e.g. Cappellari et al. 2015) can be easily obtained. These fractions are unsurprisingly sligthly larger than those obtained in the case of JJ models for the same values of \ud835\udf09g (see dashed lines in Fig. 1, left panel).\nNotice that by construction, \ud835\udf0cDM \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22123 at large radii, while, as in JJ models, at small radii \ud835\udf0cDM \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22122 (i.e. the DM and stellar densities are locally proportional), with the exception of the minimum halo models, in which \ud835\udf0cDM \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22121. We now compare the DM profile of J3 models with the untruncated NFW profile (Navarro et al. 1997), that in our notation can be written as\n\ud835\udf0cNFW (\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udf0cnRNFW \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc50)\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udf09NFW + \ud835\udc60)2 , \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc50) \u2261 ln (1 + \ud835\udc50) \u2212 \ud835\udc50 1 + \ud835\udc50 , (27)\nwhere \ud835\udf09NFW \u2261 \ud835\udc5fNFW/\ud835\udc5f\u2217 is the NFW scale length in units of \ud835\udc5f\u2217 and,\nfor a chosen reference radius \ud835\udc5ft, we define RNFW \u2261 \ud835\udc40NFW (\ud835\udc5ft)/\ud835\udc40\u2217 and \ud835\udc50 \u2261 \ud835\udc5ft/\ud835\udc5fNFW. The densities \ud835\udf0cDM and \ud835\udf0cNFW can be made asymptotically identical both at small and large radii by fixing RNFW = \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc50) \ud835\udf09g , \ud835\udf09NFW = \ud835\udf09g\u221a\ufe01\n2\ud835\udf09g \u2212 1 . (28)\nHence, once a specific minimum halo galaxy model is considered, equations (27) and (28) allow to determine the NFW profile that best reproduces the DM halo density profile. Cosmological simulations suggest for galaxies \ud835\udc50 ' 10 (see e.g. Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin 2017), and RNFW ' a few tens. Moreover, the value of \ud835\udf09g cannot be too large, otherwise the DM fraction inside \ud835\udc45e would exceed the values derived from observations (see e.g. Napolitano et al. 2010; see also Fig. 1 in CMP19). For these reasons we conclude that the NFW shape and the cosmological expectations are reproduced if we consider minimum halo models with \ud835\udf09g ' 10 \u00f7 20. In the following, we choose as \u2018reference model\u2019 a minimum halo model with Rg = \ud835\udf09g = 13, \ud835\udc50 = 10, RNFW ' 20, and \ud835\udc5fNFW = 2.6 \ud835\udc5f\u2217."

For example, at fixed \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd, and \ud835\udefe, one has 3\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefe < \ud835\udc5fB \ud835\udc5f\u2217 \u2264 18\ud835\udf07 (\ud835\udf0b2\u2212 6)\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefe . (43)\nIn Fig. 2 (top left) we show the trend of \ud835\udc5fB/\ud835\udc5f\u2217 as a function of \ud835\udf09g in the minimum halo case (\ud835\udefc = 1) with \ud835\udefd = 1 and \ud835\udf07 = 0.002, for three values of \ud835\udefe; in general, \ud835\udc5fB is of the order of a few \u00d7 10\u22123 \ud835\udc5f\u2217. Note that, for fixed \ud835\udf09g, the isothermal profile (black line) is above that in the corresponding adiabatic case (red line); in general, for fixed \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd and \ud835\udf09g, \ud835\udc5fB/\ud835\udc5f\u2217 always lies between the isothermal and the monoatomic adiabatic case, as shown by equation (43). Finally, by combining equations (17) and (42),\n\ud835\udf09 \u2261 \ud835\udc5fg \ud835\udc5fB = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefe\ud835\udf09gFg (\ud835\udf09g) 3\ud835\udf07 = R\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefeFg (\ud835\udf09g) 3 , (44)\nand so R and \ud835\udf09 increase with \ud835\udf09g. Curiously, from the general definitions in equation (17), and making use of equation (34),\nR \ud835\udf09 = 2\ud835\udf0e2pg (0) \ud835\udc502\u221e , (45)\nwhich links directly the parameters of Bondi accretion to the observable \ud835\udf0epg (0) = \ud835\udf0eg (0).\nFor observational purposes, it is also useful to express the position of \ud835\udc5fB in terms of the radius \ud835\udc45inf as given in equation (36); since the parameter \ud835\udefc = Rg/Rm cancels out, we have\n\ud835\udc5fB \ud835\udc45inf = 9\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf16 (2 + \ud835\udf16) 4\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefeFg (\ud835\udf09g) , (46)\nindependently of the minimum halo assumption. In Fig. 2 (bottom\nleft panel) we show the trend of \ud835\udc5fB/\ud835\udc45inf when \ud835\udf16 = 0.5 and \ud835\udefd = 1, for the same three values of \ud835\udefe as in the upper left panel: \ud835\udc5fB \u2248 a few times \ud835\udc45inf .\nNow we move the discussion to the sonic radius \ud835\udc5fmin, one of the most important properties of the accretion solution. The effects of the galaxy do indeed manifest themselves in the position of \ud835\udc5fmin. When measured in terms of the scale length \ud835\udc5f\u2217, it can be written, by making use of equation (42), as \ud835\udc5fmin \ud835\udc5f\u2217 = \ud835\udc65min (\u03c7,R, \ud835\udf09) \ud835\udc5fB \ud835\udc5f\u2217 , (47)\nwhere \ud835\udc65min \u2261 \ud835\udc5fmin/\ud835\udc5fB gives the (absolute) minimum of \ud835\udc53 . Finally, we must recast the galaxy potential in equation (30) by using the normalization scales in equation (18): as \ud835\udc60/\ud835\udf09g = \ud835\udc65/\ud835\udf09, it is immediate that in our problem\n\ud835\udf13\n( \ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udf09\n) = ln ( 1 + \ud835\udf09\n\ud835\udc65 ) + \ud835\udf09 \ud835\udc65 ln ( 1 + \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf09 ) .

Therefore, J3 galaxies belong to the family of models for which a fully analytical discussion of the isothermal Bondi accretion problem is possible (see Table 1). In particular, from CP17 and CP18, the critical accretion\n4 The \ud835\udc4a function is not new in the study of isothermal flows.

Summarising,\ud835\udc4a\u22121 describes supersonic accretion, while \ud835\udc4a0 subsonic accretion5. Although equation (51) provides an explicit expression ofM, it can be useful to have its asymptotic trend at small and large distances from the centre; from equation (A2) and\n5 As \ud835\udc65 decreases from \u221e to \ud835\udc65min, the argument of \ud835\udc4a0 decreases from 0 to \u22121/e (points \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 in Fig. A1, left panel), and M2 increases from 0 to 1. As \ud835\udc65 further decreases from \ud835\udc65min to 0, the argument of \ud835\udc4a\u22121 increases again from \u22121/e to 0 (points \ud835\udc35 and \ud835\udc36), and M2 increases from 1 to \u221e. The other critical solution, with M2 increasing for increasing \ud835\udc65, is obtained by switching the functions \ud835\udc4a0 and \ud835\udc4a\u22121 in equation (51).\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nthe expansion of \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65), one has\nM2 \u223c  2\u03c7 \ud835\udc65 + 2(2\ud835\udf09 \u2212R) \ud835\udf09 ln \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65min , \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0 , \u03bb2t \ud835\udc65 \u22122(2+R\ud835\udc65 ) , \ud835\udc65 \u2192 \u221e.\n(52)\nOf course, the same result can be established also by asympotic expansion of equation (12).

As already found for JJ models in the isothermal case, also for J3 models the case \u03c7 = 0 (from equation (18) corresponding to a galaxy without a central MBH) reveals some interesting properties of the gas flow, also relevant for the understanding of the more natural situation \u03c7 > 0. In fact, near the centre \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) \u223c (2 \u2212R/\ud835\udf09) ln \ud835\udc65, and a solution is possible only for R \u2265 2\ud835\udf09, with \ud835\udc65min given by equation (50). When R < 2\ud835\udf09, \ud835\udc53min = \u2212\u221e (reached at the origin), and therefore no accretion is possible since \u03bbt would be zero. In the special case \u03c7 = 0 and R = 2\ud835\udf09, \ud835\udc53min is again reached at the origin, but \ud835\udc53 now converges to \ud835\udc53min = 2(1+ ln \ud835\udf09), with \u03bbt = \ud835\udf092e3/2. Given the similarity of JJ and J3 models near the centre, the fact that both models share the same properties at small radii is not surprising6. Equation (52) can still be used with \u03c7 = 0 for R > 2\ud835\udf09, while for R = 2\ud835\udf09, from equations (51) and (A2) it can be shown that M2 = 1 +O(\ud835\udc65).\nWe now show how the condition R \u2265 2\ud835\udf09 when \u03c7 = 0, in order to have accretion, imposes an upper limit on \ud835\udc47\u221e. In fact, from equation (44), with \ud835\udefe = 1, the identity R/(2\ud835\udf09) = 3/(2\ud835\udefdFg) produces a condition for \ud835\udefd:\n\ud835\udefd \u2264 3 2Fg (\ud835\udf09g) \u2261 \ud835\udefdc , (53)\nwhere the critical parameter \ud835\udefdc depends only on \ud835\udf09g. It follows that\n6 For a further discussion of the effect of the central density slope on the existence of isothermal accretion solutions with \u03c7 = 0, see CP17 and CP18.\nin absence of a central MBH, isothermal accretion in J3 galaxies is possible only for\n\ud835\udc47\u221e \u2264 \ud835\udefdc\ud835\udc47V , i.e., \ud835\udf0epg (0) = \ud835\udf0eg (0) \u2265 \ud835\udc50\u221e , (54)\nwhere the last inequality derives from equation (45). For reference, in Fig. 4 (right panel) we show \ud835\udefdc as a function of \ud835\udf09g, for both JJ and J3 models; it is easy to prove that 3/2 < \ud835\udefdc \u2264 9/(\ud835\udf0b2\u2212 6) ' 2.33.\nAs anticipated, the limitation R \u2265 2\ud835\udf09 when \u03c7 = 0 is also relevant for the understanding of the flow behaviour when \u03c7 > 0. In fact, it is possible to show that, by defining \ud835\udf0f \u2261 \ud835\udefd/\ud835\udefdc = 2\ud835\udf09/R, for R \u2192 \u221e and fixed7 \ud835\udf0f, we have\n\ud835\udc65min \u223c  \u2212 \ud835\udf0f +\ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\u2212\ud835\udf0fe \u2212\ud835\udf0f ) 2 R , \ud835\udf0f < 1,\u221a\ufe02 \u03c7R 2 , \ud835\udf0f = 1, \u03c7\ud835\udf0f 2 (\ud835\udf0f \u2212 1) , \ud835\udf0f > 1.\n(55)\nThe trend of \ud835\udc65min as a function of \ud835\udefd is shown by the black solid line in Fig. 2 (top right panel), for a minimum halo model with \ud835\udf09g = 13 and \ud835\udf07 = 0.002. For example, equation (55) allows to explain the drop at increasing \ud835\udefd when \ud835\udf0f switches from being less than unity to being larger than unity, with \ud835\udc65min ' \u03c7/2 independently of \ud835\udf0f; the black square point at \ud835\udc5fmin ' 57.34 \ud835\udc5fB correspond to \ud835\udefd = \ud835\udefdc ' 1.65, well approximated by the value 57.01 \ud835\udc5fB obtained with the previous equation. Equation (55) allows us to find the behaviour of \u03bbt for large values of R (at fixed \ud835\udefd). For example, in the peculiar case \ud835\udefd = \ud835\udefdc (i.e. \ud835\udf0f = 1), an asymptotic analysis shows that \u03bbt \u223c e3/2R2/4; for simplicity, we do not report the expression of \u03bbt for \ud835\udefd \u2260 \ud835\udefdc, which can, however, be easily calculated. As shown in Fig. 3 (left panel), the\n7 As for JJ models (CP18, equation (48)), from equation (50) it follows that the limit for R \u2192 \u221e is not uniform in \ud835\udf0f.\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\npresence of the galaxy makes \u03bbt several orders of magnitude larger than without it.\nA summary of the results can be seen by inspection of Fig. 5 (top panels), where we show the radial profile of the Mach number for three different values of the temperature parameter (\ud835\udefd = 1, 2, 3). Solid lines show the two critical solutions, one in which the gas flow begins supersonic and approaches the centre with zero velocity, and the other in which M continuously increases towards the centre. The dotted lines show two illustrative subcritical solutions with \u03bb = 0.8 \u03bbt. It is apparent that \ud835\udc5fmin decreases very rapidly with increasing temperature at the transition from \ud835\udefd = 1 to \ud835\udefd = 2: \ud835\udc5fmin ' 19.89 \ud835\udc5f\u2217, 0.0093 \ud835\udc5f\u2217, and 0.0024 \ud835\udc5f\u2217, for \ud835\udefd = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\nFinally, once the Mach number profile is known, the gas density profile is obtained from the first equation of the system (6) with \ud835\udefe = 1, i.e.,\n?\u0303?(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udf0c\u221e = \u03bb \ud835\udc652M(\ud835\udc65) . (56)\nAlong the critical solution, by virtue of equation (52) it follows that ?\u0303? \u223c \u03bbt\ud835\udc65\u22123/2/ \u221a\ufe01 2\u03c7 at the centre when \u03c7 > 0, while ?\u0303? \u223c \ud835\udc65R/\ud835\udc65 at large radii. Fig. 6 (top panel) shows the radial trend of ?\u0303? for the critical accretion solution in our reference model, with \u03bbt ' 2.14\u00d7 108. The bottom panel shows the gas velocity profile and, for comparision, the isotropic velocity dispersion \ud835\udf0er. Notice that near the centre, \ud835\udf0eBH \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22121/2 and \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc50\u221eM \u221d \ud835\udc5f\u22121/2 (provided that \u03c7 > 0), so that their ratio is constant; it can be easily shown that \ud835\udc63/\ud835\udf0eBH \u223c 6\u03c7. The value of \ud835\udf0eBH near the centre (i.e. of \ud835\udf0er if a central MBH is present), is then a proxy for the isothermal gas inflow velocity.\n4.2 The 1 < \ud835\udf38 < 5/3 case\nWhen 1 < \ud835\udefe < 5/3, from the expression for \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) we have that in one case the determination of \ud835\udc65min and \ud835\udc53min is trivial, i.e. for \ud835\udf09 \u2192 \u221e (or R \u2192 0): in this situation the galaxy contribution vanishes, and the\nposition of the only minimum of \ud835\udc53 reduces to \ud835\udc65min = \u03c7 (5 \u2212 3\ud835\udefe)/4. Therefore, following KCP16, the behaviour of the associated \u03bbt could be found just by carrying out a perturbative analysis (see KCP16, Appendix A); however, since in our models R falls in the range 103 \u00f7 104, we shall not further discuss this limit case. In general, the problem of the determination of \ud835\udc65min (and so of \u03bbt) cannot be solved analytically, as apparent by combining equations (19) and (48), and setting \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 /\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 0; a numerical investigation is then needed. As in the case of isothermal flows, we begin by considering 0 < \u03c7 \u2264 1. Of course, as \ud835\udc53 is strictly positive, continuous, and divergent to infinity for \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0 and \ud835\udc65 \u2192 \u221e, the existence of at least a minimum is guaranteed. A detailed numerical exploration shows that, in analogy with the isothermal case in Hernquist galaxies (CP17), it is possible to have more than one critical point for \ud835\udc53 as a function of \ud835\udefd an \ud835\udefe. In particular, there can be a single minimum for \ud835\udc53 , or two minima and one maximum. We found that for \ud835\udf09g = 13 and \ud835\udefd \u2248 1 \u00f7 2, only one minimum is present for \ud835\udefe . 1.01 and \ud835\udefe & 1.1; instead, for 1.01 . \ud835\udefe . 1.1, three critical points and two minima are present. When \ud835\udefd is small (i.e.\ud835\udc47\u221e is low), the absolute minimum of \ud835\udc53 is reached at the outer critical point; as \ud835\udefd increases, the value of \ud835\udc53 at the inner critical point decreases, and the flow is finally characterised by two sonic points. Increasing further \ud835\udc47\u221e, the inner critical point becomes the new sonic point, with a jump to a smaller value. Fig. 2 (top right panel) shows the position of \ud835\udc65min as a function of \ud835\udefd for different values of \ud835\udefe, and confirms these trends of \ud835\udc65min with \ud835\udc47\u221e and \ud835\udefe. Notice how the location of \ud835\udc65min (shown in the bottom panel) now decreases with an extremely slow decline for \ud835\udefe > 1. According with equation (47), this means that, for polytropic indeces sufficiently greater than 1, the ratio \ud835\udc5fB/\ud835\udc5f\u2217 decreases faster than what \ud835\udc65min increases.\nIn the case \u03c7 = 0 the sonic point is reached at the origin. Indeed, \ud835\udc53 tends to zero when \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0, and runs to infinity for \ud835\udc65 \u2192 \u221e, and so \ud835\udc65min \u2192 0 for every choice of the model parameters. Therefore, from equation (11) one has \u03bbt \u2192 0, concluding the discussion of the problem in absence of the central MBH since no accretion can take place.\nHaving determined the position \ud835\udc65min, we can compute numerically the corresponding value of \u03bbt, given in the polytropic case by equation (11) with \ud835\udc53min = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65min) obtained from equation (19). In Fig. 3 (right panel) the critical accretion parameter is shown as a function of \ud835\udf09g, for a reference model with \ud835\udefe = 4/3 and different values of \ud835\udefd. We note that, at variance with the isothermal case (left panel), \u03bbt is roughly constant for fixed \ud835\udefd independently of the extension of the DM halo, while, at fixed \ud835\udf09g, it increases for decreasing \ud835\udc47\u221e. Having also determined \u03bbt, we finally solve numerically equation (8), obtaining the Mach profile M(\ud835\udc65). In Fig. 5 (middle panels) we show M(\ud835\udc65) for three different values of the temperature parameter (\ud835\udefd = 1, 2, 3). The logarithmic scale allows to appreciate how, according to Fig. 2, \ud835\udc65min suddenly falls down to values under unity as \ud835\udefe increases with respect to the isothermal case. As an illustrative example, we show the case \ud835\udefe = 4/3. Although the trend is not very strong, the location of the sonic point, at variance with the \ud835\udefe = 1 case, moves away from the centre as the temperature increases: \ud835\udc5fmin ' 0.025 \ud835\udc5fB, 0.046 \ud835\udc5fB, and 0.062 \ud835\udc5fB, for \ud835\udefd = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For comparison, in the top axis we give the distance from the origin in units of \ud835\udc5f\u2217, from which it can be seen that, in accordance with Fig. 2 (bottom panel), \ud835\udc5fmin now tends to increase slightly, while still of the order of 10\u22124 \ud835\udc5f\u2217.\nOnce the radial profile of the Mach number is known, both the gas density and temperature profiles can be obtained from the following relations:\n?\u0303? = \ud835\udc47 1 \ud835\udefe\u22121 =\n( \u03bb\n\ud835\udc652M\n) 2 \ud835\udefe+1\n, (57)\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nwith\ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc47/\ud835\udc47\u221e. Fig. 6 shows the trends of \ud835\udf0c (top panel) and\ud835\udc47 (middle panel), as a function of \ud835\udc5f/\ud835\udc5f\u2217, for the critical accretion solution in our usual reference model. The parameter \ud835\udefd is fixed to unity, and the curves refer to different polytropic indeces.\nFor what concerns the Mach profile for the critical accretion solution, an asymptotic analysis of equation (8) shows that, at the leading order\nM \u223c  \u03bb \u2212 \ud835\udefe\u221212 t (2\u03c7) \ud835\udefe+1 4 \ud835\udc65\u2212 5\u22123\ud835\udefe 4 , \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0 , \u03bbt \ud835\udc65 \u22122 , \ud835\udc65 \u2192 \u221e.\n(58)\nNotice that all the information about the specific galaxy model in the two regions is contained in the parameter \u03bbt. Equation (58) allows us to find the asymptotic behaviour at small and large radii of the most important quantities concerning the Bondi accretion. Close to the centre, for example, ?\u0303? \u223c \u03bbt\ud835\udc65\u22123/2/ \u221a\ufe01 2\u03c7 (as for the isothermal case), independently on the value of \ud835\udefe, and so for the gas velocity \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc50sM one finds\n\ud835\udc632 (\ud835\udc5f) \u223c \u03a8n2\u03c7\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc60 \u223c 6\u03c7\ud835\udf0e2BH (\ud835\udc5f) . (59)\nTherefore, the central value of \ud835\udf0eBH is a proxy for the gas inflow velocity also in the range 1 < \ud835\udefe < 5/3. Fig. 6 (bottom panel) shows the radial trend of \ud835\udc63 for for different values of \ud835\udefe: notice how, moving away from the centre, it decreases progressively faster for \ud835\udefe > 1 (see the green dashed line, corresponding to \ud835\udefe = 1.1), while deviating significantly from the isotropic stellar velocity dispersion profile.\nWe conclude by noting that the inclusion of the effects of the gravitational field of an host galaxy allows to estimate the total mass profile, \ud835\udc40T (\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc40BH +\ud835\udc40g (\ud835\udc5f), under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (see e.g. Ciotti & Pellegrini 2004; Pellegrini & Ciotti 2006). First of all, we note that the estimated mass reads\n\ud835\udc40est (\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc40T (\ud835\udc5f) + \ud835\udc5f2 2\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc632 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , (60)\nwhence it is clear that the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium always leads to underestimate \ud835\udc40T in the accretion studies, where the velocity increases in magnitude towards the centre. Simple algebra shows that the expression of \ud835\udc40est is given by\n\ud835\udc40est (\ud835\udc5f) = \u2212 \ud835\udc5f2\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc5f) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f = \u2212\ud835\udc40BH\n\ud835\udc652\n?\u0303? 2\u2212\ud835\udefe \ud835\udc51?\u0303? \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 , (61)\nand, near the MBH (i.e. for \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0), where ?\u0303? \u223c \u03bbt\ud835\udc65\u22123/2/ \u221a\ufe01 2\u03c7 ,\n\ud835\udc40est (\ud835\udc5f) \ud835\udc40BH \u223c 3 2 ( \u03bbt\u221a\ufe01 2\u03c7 )\ud835\udefe\u22121 \ud835\udc65 5\u22123\ud835\udefe 2 ; (62)\nnotice that in the isothermal limit case one has \ud835\udc40est (\ud835\udc5f) \u221d \ud835\udc5f.\n4.3 The \ud835\udf38 = 5/3 case\nThe monoatomic case (\ud835\udefe = 5/3) presents some special behaviour deserving a short description. By considering equation (19) with \ud835\udefe = 5/3, it follows that \ud835\udc53 is monotonically increasing and the only minimum is reached at the centre (KCP17); moreover, for galaxy models with \ud835\udc5f\u03a8g (\ud835\udc5f) \u2192 0 when \ud835\udc5f \u2192 0 (as for J3 models), one finds \ud835\udc53min = \u03c7, whence \u03bbt = \u03c72/4. Therefore, \u03c7 > 0 in order to have accretion.\nWhen \u03bb = \u03c72/4, the Bondi problem (8) reduces to the fourth degree equation\nM2 \u2212 4 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) \u03c7 \u221a M + 3 = 0 , (63)\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nprovided that the condition on the central potential mentioned above is satisfied; note that the dependence on the specific galaxy model is contained only in the function \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65). In the bottom panels of Fig. 5 we show the radial profile of the Mach number. In this situation, \ud835\udc65min = 0, and so the accretion solutions (blue lines) are subsonic everywhere.\nThe asymptotic bahaviour of M(\ud835\udc65) for the critical accretion solution when \ud835\udc65 \u2192 \u221e is obtaned from equation (58) just by fixing \u03bbt = \u03c72/4. When \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0, instead, the \ud835\udefe = 5/3 case does not coincide with the limit of equation (58) for \ud835\udefe \u2192 5/3: in fact, now M \u2192 1 instead of infinity, and its asymptotic trend reads\nM(\ud835\udc65) \u223c 1 \u2212 \u221a\ufe04 \u2212 8R\ud835\udc65 ln \ud835\udc65\n3\ud835\udf09\u03c7 , \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0; (64)\nof course, the same situation at small radii occurs in the case of any other quantity deriving from Mach\u2019s profile: for example,\n\ud835\udc632 (\ud835\udc5f) \u223c \u03a8n\u03c7\ud835\udf07 2\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc40est (\ud835\udc5f) \u223c 3\u03c7 4 \ud835\udc40BH . (65)\nNotice that \ud835\udc63 decreases by a factor of 2 with respect to the 1 \u2264 \ud835\udefe < 5/3 case, and \ud835\udc40est differs from what would be obtained setting \ud835\udefe = 5/3 and \u03bbt = \u03c72/4 in equation (62)."

            "text": "In this Section we employ the obtained polytropic solutions to elucidate some important thermodynamical aspects of the Bondi accretion, not always sufficiently stressed in the literature. In fact, it is not uncommon to consider Bondi accretion as an \u2018adiabatic\u2019 problem, where no radiative losses or other forms of heat transfer take place: after all, no heating or cooling functions seem to be specified at the outset of the problem. Obviously, this is not true, being the Bondi solution a purely hydrodynamical flow where all the thermodynamics of heat exchange is implicitly described by the polytropic index \ud835\udefe. Therefore, for given \ud835\udefe (and in absence of shock waves), one can follow the entropy evolution of each fluid element along the radial streamline, and determine the reversible heat exchanges. Let us consider polytropic Bondi accretion with8 \ud835\udefe \u2260 \ud835\udefead. From the expression of the entropy per unit mass S for a perfect gas (e.g. Chandrasekhar 1939; Zel\u2019dovich & Raizer 1966), and assuming as reference value for S its value at infinity, we can write the change of entropy of an element of the accreting flow along its radial streamline, during a polytropic transformation, as\n\ud835\udc37S \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = C\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udefe \u2212 \ud835\udefead) \ud835\udc37 ln ?\u0303? \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 , \u0394S \u2261 S \u2212 S\u221e , (66)\nwhere \ud835\udc37/\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf15/\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc97 \u00b7\u2207 is the material derivative. Of course, for \ud835\udefe = \ud835\udefead no change of entropy occurs along regular solutions, being the process isentropic; instead, for \ud835\udefe \u2260 \ud835\udefead, once the solution of the Bondi problem is known, equation (66) allows to compute the entropy change of a fluid element. From the second law of thermodynamics, the rate of heat per unit mass exchanged by the fluid element can be written as \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc37S \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 . (67)\n8 Notice that not necessarily \ud835\udefe < \ud835\udefead; for example, one could study a \ud835\udefe = 5/3 accretion in a biatomic gas with \ud835\udefead = 7/5.\nTherefore, from equation (66), it follows that, for \ud835\udefe \u2260 \ud835\udefead, a fluid element necessarily exchanges heat with the ambient; this fact can be restated in terms of the specific heat as\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = C \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = C\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udefe \u2212 \ud835\udefead \ud835\udefe \u2212 1 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 , (68)\nwhere C is the constant specific heat for polytropic trasformations (see e.g. Chandrasekhar 1939). A third (equivalent) expression for the heat exchange can be finally obtained from the first law of thermodynamics, i.e.,\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udf0c2 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 , (69)\nwhere \ud835\udc52 is the internal energy per unit mass, and, apart from an additive constant, \u210e = \ud835\udc52 + \ud835\udc5d/\ud835\udf0c = C\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 is the enthalpy per unit mass. In the stationary case, from equations (67), (68) and (69), one has\nQ \ud835\udf0c \u2261 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61 =  C\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udefe \u2212 \ud835\udefead) \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc97 \u00b7 \u2207\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf0c , C\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udefe \u2212 \ud835\udefead \ud835\udefe \u2212 1 \ud835\udc97 \u00b7 \u2207\ud835\udc47 , \ud835\udc97 \u00b7 \u2207 ( \ud835\udc632 2 + \u210e \u2212\u03a8T ) ,\n(70)\nwhere Q is the rate of heat exchange per unit volume, \ud835\udc97 = \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc5f , \u2207 = \ud835\udc86\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc51/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f, and the last expression can be easily proved (e.g. Ciotti 2021, Chapter 10). Summarising, a fluid element undergoing a generic polytropic transformation loses energy as it moves inward and heats when 1 < \ud835\udefe < \ud835\udefead, while for \ud835\udefe > \ud835\udefead it experiences a temperature decrease. In the polytropic Bondi accretion both cases are possible, except for a monoatomic gas, when accretion is possible only for \ud835\udefe \u2264 \ud835\udefead = 5/3 (see Section 2). We can now use each expression in equation (70) to compute the rate of heat exchange just by substituting in them the solution of the Bondi problem. Defining Qn = \ud835\udc503\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u221e/\ud835\udc5fB, the first two expression in (70), and the third one, become respectively\nQ = Qn\u03bbt \ud835\udc652 \u00d7  \ud835\udefead \u2212 \ud835\udefe \ud835\udefe (\ud835\udefead \u2212 1) ?\u0303? \ud835\udefe\u22122 \ud835\udc51?\u0303? \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 , \u2212 \ud835\udc51E \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 ,\n(71)\nwhere, up to an additive constant, E \u2261 [ M2\n2 + \ud835\udefead \ud835\udefe(\ud835\udefead \u2212 1)\n] ?\u0303? \ud835\udefe\u22121 \u2212 [ \u03c7 \ud835\udc65 + R \ud835\udf09 \ud835\udf13 ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf09 )] . (72)\nThe situation is illustrated in Fig. 7: the left panel refers to the isothermal case and three values of \ud835\udefd; the right panel shows the case of a monoatomic gas (i.e. \ud835\udefead = 5/3), for a fixed \ud835\udefd and different values of \ud835\udefe < \ud835\udefead. The plotted quantity is \u2212 4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f2Q(\ud835\udc5f), i.e. the rate of heat per unit lenght exchanged by the infalling gas element. In practice, by integrating the curves between two radii \ud835\udc5f1 and \ud835\udc5f2, one obtain the heat per unit time exchanged with the ambient by the spherical shell of thickness | \ud835\udc5f2 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f1 |. For comparison, the dashed lines correspond to the same case, i.e. isothermal accretion with \ud835\udc47\u221e = \ud835\udc47V. Notice how in general the profile is almost a power law over a very large radial range, and how the heat exchange decreases for increasing \ud835\udc47\u221e and for \ud835\udefe approaching \ud835\udefead.\nAn important region for observational and theoretical works is the galactic centre. The general asymptotic trend of Q, for \ud835\udc65 \u2192 0 and\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\n\u03c7 > 0, reads\nQ Qn \u223c  3\u03bb\ud835\udefet (2\u03c7) \u2212 \ud835\udefe\u221212 (\ud835\udefe \u2212 \ud835\udefead) 2\ud835\udefe (\ud835\udefead \u2212 1) \ud835\udc65\u2212 3(\ud835\udefe+1) 2 \u223c 3\u03c7 (\ud835\udefe \u2212 \ud835\udefead) \u03bbt\ud835\udefe (\ud835\udefead \u2212 1) ?\u0303? 2\ud835\udc47, 3\u03c73 (5 \u2212 3\ud835\udefead) 80 (\ud835\udefead \u2212 1) \ud835\udc65\u2212 4 \u223c 3 (5 \u2212 3\ud835\udefead) 5\u03c7 (\ud835\udefead \u2212 1) ?\u0303? 2\ud835\udc47,\n(73) where in the first expression, 1 \u2264 \ud835\udefe < 5/3 and ?\u0303? \u223c \u03bbt\ud835\udc65\u22123/2/ \u221a\ufe01\n2\u03c7, and in the second, \ud835\udefe = 5/3 and ?\u0303? \u223c (\u03c7/2)3/2\ud835\udc65\u22123/2. In practice, close to the centre, Q is a pure power law of logarithmic slope decreasing from \u2212 3 to \u2212 4 for \ud835\udefe increasing from 1 to 5/3. It follows that the volume integrated heat exchanges are always dominated by the innermost region.\nWe conclude by noticing the interesting fact that the heat per unit mass exchanged by a fluid element as it moves from \u221e down to the radius \ud835\udc5f , admits a very simple physical interpretation; in fact, by integrating the last expression of equation (70) along the streamline, one obtains for this exchange the remarkable result that\n\u0394\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc632\n2 + \u0394\u210e \u2212\u03a8T , \u0394\u210e \u2261 \u210e(\ud835\udc5f) \u2212 \u210e(\u221e) ; (74)\nthe total heat exchanged by a unit mass of fluid (moving from \u221e to \ud835\udc5f) can then be interpreted as the change of the Bernoulli \u2018constant\u2019 when the enthalpy change in equation (75) is evaluated along the polytropic solution. There is an interesting alternative way to obtain the result above. In fact, from the first law of thermodynamics, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc51\u210e\u2212\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5d/\ud835\udf0c, thus in our problem we also have \u02c6 \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5d\u221e \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udf0c = \u0394\u210e \u2212 \u0394\ud835\udc5e = ( 1 \u2212 C C\ud835\udc5d ) \u0394\u210e. (75)\nThis shows that the integral at the left hand side, which appears in Bondi accretion through equation (3), equals \u0394\u210e only for \ud835\udefe = \ud835\udefead,\nwhile, in general, it is just proportional to \u0394\u210e. Equation (74) can also be obtained by inserting equation (75) in equation (3), and considering the total potential (galaxy plus MBH)."

            "text": "A recent paper (CP18) generalised the Bondi accretion theory to include the effects of the gravitational field of the galaxy hosting a central MBH, and of electron scattering, finding the analytical isothermal accretion solution for Jaffe\u2019s two-component JJ galaxy models (CZ18). The JJ models are interesting because almost all their relevant dynamical properties can be expressed in relatively simple analytical form, while reproducing the main structural properties of real ellipticals. However, their DM haloes cannot reproduce the expected \ud835\udc5f\u22123 profile at large radii, characteristic of the NFW profile; as Bondi accretion solution is determined by the gas properties at \u2018infinity\u2019, it is important to understand the effect of a more realistic DM potential at large radii. Moreover, in CP18 only isothermal solution were studied. Later, CMP19 presented two-component J3 galaxy models, similar to the JJ ones but with the additional property that the DM halo can reproduce the NFW profile at all radii. J3 models then represent an improvement over JJ ones, while retaining the same analytical simplicity, and so avoiding the need for numerical investigations to study their dynamical properties. In this paper we take advantage of J3 models to study again the generalised Bondi problem, further extending the investigation to the general case of a polytropic gas, and elucidating some important thermodynamical properties of accretion. The parameters describing the solution are linked to the galaxy structure by imposing that the gas temperature at infinity (\ud835\udc47\u221e) is proportional to the virial temperature of the stellar component (\ud835\udc47V) through a dimensionless parameter (\ud835\udefd) that can be arbitrarily fixed. The main results can be summarised as follows.\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\n(i) The isothermal case can be solved in a fully analytical way. In particular, there is only one sonic point for any choice of the galaxy structural parameters and of the value of \ud835\udc47\u221e. It is found however that \ud835\udc5fmin, the position of the sonic radius, is strongly dependent on \ud835\udc47\u221e, with values of the order of, or larger than, the galaxy effective radius (\ud835\udc45e) for temperatures of the order of \ud835\udc47V, and with a sudden decrease down to \u2248 10\u22122 \ud835\udc45e, or even lower, at increasing \ud835\udc47\u221e (say & 1.5\ud835\udc47V). In absence of a central MBH (or \u03c7 = 0, i.e. when the gravitational attraction of the central MBH is perfectly balanced by the radiation pressure), accretion is possible provided that \ud835\udc50\u221e \u2264 \ud835\udf0epg (0), i.e. when \ud835\udc47\u221e is lower than a critical value, with \ud835\udf0epg (0) the central projected stellar velocity dispersion.\n(ii) When 1 < \ud835\udefe < 5/3, the Bondi accretion problem does not allow for an analytical solution. A numerical exploration shows that \ud835\udc5fmin suddenly drops to values . \ud835\udc5f\u2217 as \ud835\udefe increases at fixed \ud835\udc47\u221e. Moreover, depending on the specific values of R, \ud835\udf09, and \ud835\udefe, the accretion flow can have one or three critical points, and in very special circumstances two sonic points. For a given \ud835\udefe, quite independently of the extension of the DM halo, the accretion parameter \u03bbt is roughly constant at fixed \ud835\udefd, with values several order of magnitudes lower than the isothermal case. In absence of a central MBH, no accretion can take place.\n(iii) In the monoatomic adiabatic case (\ud835\udefe = 5/3) the Mach number profile can be obtained for a generic galaxy model by solving a fourth degree algebraic equation. However, the solution is quite impractical, and a numerical evaluation is preferred. As already shown in KCP16, in this case \u03bbt = \u03c72/4, so that, again, the absence of the central MBH makes accretion impossible.\n(iv) We consider in detail the thermodynamical properties of Bondi accretion when the polytropic index \ud835\udefe differs from the adiabatic index \ud835\udefead. Under this circumstance, the entropy of fluid elements changes along their pathlines, and it is possible to compute the associated heat exchanges (Q). We provide the mathematical expressions to compute Q as a function of radius, once the Bondi problem is solved, and in particular its asymptotic behaviour near the MBH.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nNo datasets were generated or analysed in support of this research."

The asymptotic expansion of\ud835\udc4a0 reads\n\ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc67) =  \ud835\udc67 +O(\ud835\udc672) , \ud835\udc67 \u2192 0 , ln \ud835\udc67 +O(ln ln \ud835\udc67) , \ud835\udc67 \u2192 \u221e, (A2)\n(see e.g. de Bru\u0133n 1981), while for \ud835\udc67 \u2192 0 it can be shown that \ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\ud835\udc67) \u223c ln (\u2212 \ud835\udc67). Moreover, it can be proved that \ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc67 , \ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) \u2265 \ud835\udc67 , for \ud835\udc67 \u2264 \u22121, \ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) \u2264 \ud835\udc67 , \ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc67 , for \ud835\udc67 \u2265 \u22121. (A3)\nTherefore, \ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) \u2264 \ud835\udc67, and \ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) \u2265 \ud835\udc67 for all values of \ud835\udc67. Finally, we recall the monotonicity properties\ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc671) \u2265 \ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc672) and \ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\ud835\udc671) \u2264 \ud835\udc4a\u22121 (\ud835\udc672) for \ud835\udc671 \u2265 \ud835\udc672. For a general discussion of the properties of W, see e.g. Corless et al. (1996).\nIn physics the\ud835\udc4a- function has been used to solve problems ranging from Quantum Mechanics (see e.g. Valluri et al. 2009; Wang & Moniz 2019) to General Relativity (see e.g. Mez\u0151 & Keady 2016; see also Barry et al. 2000 for a summary of recent applications),\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n1-0.5 0 0.5 1.5\nA\nB\nC\nW (z )\nz\nW0\nW\u22121\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n-3 -2 -1 0\nW0 W0\nW\u22121 W\u22121W (z\nez )\nz\nFigure A1.

Right: the two real branches of the function \ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc67e\ud835\udc67 ) .\nincluding Stellar Dynamics (CZ18). Indeed, several trascendental equations accuring in applications can be solved in terms of \ud835\udc4a ; for example, it is a simple exercise to prove that, for \ud835\udc4b > 0, the equation\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4f + \ud835\udc50 ln \ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udc4c , (A4)\nwhere \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50, and \ud835\udc4c are quantities independent of \ud835\udc4b , has the general solution\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4f = \ud835\udc50\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4a\n( \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc50 e \ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc4c\n) . (A5)\nIn particular, the solution of equation (49) can be obtained for\n\ud835\udc4b = 1 + \ud835\udc65min \ud835\udf09 , \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc4f = 1, \ud835\udc50 = \u2212 R 2\ud835\udf09 , \ud835\udc4c = 1 + \u03c7 2\ud835\udf09 , (A6)\nas\n1 + \ud835\udc65min \ud835\udf09 = \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4a ( 1 \ud835\udc50 e \ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc50 ) . (A7)\nWe note that the equations (50) and (A7) represent the only solution for \ud835\udc65min in the isothermal accretion for generic values of the model parameters. This can be proved as follows. The first condition for the general validity of (A7) is that the argument of \ud835\udc4a must be \u2264 0. In fact, \ud835\udc50 \u2264 0 and \ud835\udc65min \u2265 0, so that the right hand side of (A7) must be \u2265 0, i.e. necessarily \ud835\udc4a \u2264 0; from Fig. A1 (left panel) this forces the argument to be \u2264 0. This first condition is always true for our models. The second condition, again from the left panel of Fig. A1, is that the argument must be \u2265 \u22121/e for all possible choices of the model parameters. This inequality is easily verified by showing, with a standard minimisation of a function of two variables, that the minimum of the argument over the region \ud835\udc4c \u2265 1 and \ud835\udc50 \u2264 0 is indeed not smaller than \u22121/e. Finally, we show that only the \ud835\udc4a\u22121 function appears in the solution for \ud835\udc65min. This conclusion derives from the physical request that \ud835\udc65min \u2265 0, i.e. that the right hand side of equation (A7) is \u2265 1. Let \ud835\udc67 = 1/\ud835\udc50. From the monotonicity properties of \ud835\udc4a\u22121 and \ud835\udc4a0 mentioned after equation (A3), as \ud835\udc4c \u2265 1 we have \ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc67 \u2265 \ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67 , and so equation (A3) yields \ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc67 ) \u2265 \ud835\udc4a0 (\ud835\udc67 e\ud835\udc67) \u2265 \ud835\udc67, i.e. \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4a0 (e\ud835\udc4c /\ud835\udc50/\ud835\udc50) \u2264 1, being \ud835\udc67 \u2264 0. An identical argument shows instead that \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4a\u22121 (e\ud835\udc4c /\ud835\udc50/\ud835\udc50) \u2265 1, as required.\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)"
