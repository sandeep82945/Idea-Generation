Regardless of which metrics are referenced, leadership was being poorly and inconsistently developed and was not delivering on its promises of a better future. There are many root causes, historical and current, which have contributed to the shortfall. The main goal of the paper is to understand and adjust to a new, emergent \u2018normal\u2019. We addressed a set of compelling questions that had been asked, answered based on dialogue and sharing experience within the co-authors\u2019 team, and revisited regularly: What assumptions must be challenged? What matters more/most? What should be the priorities and why? Where do purpose and values fit and inform goals and a path forward? How should leadership shape culture to enable strategy execution? There are three distinct perspectives taking into account the professional profiles of the co-authors. Our team is an international, interdisciplinary one, including two executives from the United States of America & Canada, two PhD candidates, and their supervisor from Romania. The paper reflects our cooperation based on dialogue among experts belonging to different disciplines (business and academic) who contributed according to their expertise (coaching, innovation leadership, cultural & creative economy). Diversity adds value to our paper in terms of opportunities to exchange best practices and expertise, but it also increases complexity. From a methodological perspective our paper is based on investigating global surveys and research conducted over the last decades, and on sharing experience of best practices examples.\n\u00d4\u00b7\u00ac\u00bb\u00ae\u00bf\u00ac\u00ab\u00ae\u00bb \u00ae\u00bb\u00aa\u00b7\u00bb\u00a9\nAdult development and an environmental mismatch As the situation continues to accelerate, the key question is how to improve the leadership development process and what leadership approaches can make a difference. Our \u201cinner game\u201d \u2013 our thoughts, beliefs, assumptions, mindsets, and narratives \u2013 shapes the behaviors of our \u201couter game\u201d. It shapes our emotional states, actions, and the results we produce. When we shift our deep habits of mind, we also change the results we can attain (Gallwey, 2000; Dunham, 2009). Translating our purpose into a vision of our desired future is the hallmark of our effective leadership (Cashman, 1998). Built on the adult development work of Robert Kegan (1998; Kegan and Lahey, 2009), our progression into adulthood is understood as vertical development and stage development. At each stage, we are cognitively and emotionally dealing with certain perspectives and understandings. The majority of leaders, more than 70% of the sample of more than a half million subjects, had an average Leadership Effectiveness Score at the 40th percentile effective in their leadership practices (Anderson and Adams, 2016). Their complexity of mind was a mismatch to effectively cope with the complexity of context. From a developmental perspective, they were operating with a fear-based response and reactive tendencies that were overused. Their Leadership Quotient (LQ, calculated as effective leadership divided by ineffective leadership), is 0.67. A smaller percentage of leaders in the sample, about 20%, were at the 65th percentile with their leadership practices, suggesting a strong competitive advantage (Anderson and Adams, 2016). Their mindset better matched the complexity of their environmental context. It can be understood as purpose-driven, allowing for the expression of their creative competencies. Their LQ is 1.9. An even smaller percentage, about 5% of the leaders, were highly effective, scoring at the 90th percentile with their leadership practices (Anderson and Adams, 2016).\n\u00dc\u00d1\u00d7\u00e6 \u00ef\u00f0\u00f2\u00ee\u00ec\u00e9\u00e8\u00f1\u00b0\u00b7\u00bd\u00be\u00bb\u00f3\u00ee\u00f0\u00ee\u00ee\u00f3\u00f0\u00f0\u00e9\u00ee\u00f4 \u00b0\u00b0\u00f2 \u00e9\u00e9\u00ee\u00f3\u00e9\u00e8\u00ec\u00f4 \u00d7\u00cd\u00cd\u00d2 \u00ee\u00eb\u00eb\u00e8\u00f3\u00e7\u00ea\u00eb\u00ee \u00a4\nPICBE |\n774\nThis mindset is characterized by regularly transforming themselves and making it possible to transform systems as well. The visionary leader serves the entire system, supporting all its interdependencies and taking care of a higher purpose. Their LQ is 9.0. As authors stated \u201cthe performance of an organization depends highly on the level of consciousness of its leadership\u201d (Anderson and Adams, 2016, p. 55). What leadership is about? \u2013 its promises and fulfillment One can ask, \u2018What is leadership about? What ends does it serve?\u2019 According to Anderson and Adams (2016, p. 4-8), there are four promises of leadership: (a) Set the right direction and create meaningful work; (b) Engage all stakeholders and hold them accountable; (c) Ensure that processes and systems facilitate focus and execution; and (d) Lead effectively. Develop and maintain trustworthy relationships (psychological safety) to achieve and sustain desired results. There is also a future-oriented promise: Scale organizational capacity and capability to create outcomes that matter most \u2013 a desired, optimal and viable future for all stakeholders. With these promises and the aspiration of their fulfillment, organizations declare the circumstances that will enable their success and sustainability. It then remains to create and maintain the conditions for this to occur. What organizations typically do to support leadership development? Organizations have several tools and methods to support the development of leaders, whether focused at the top or distributed broadly throughout. It starts at the beginning of the staffing process, with screening and hiring with leadership in mind, then with job and work analysis (Rosse and Levin, 1997). Once hired, oriented and on boarded, organizations must take steps to develop their people\u2019s abilities to lead, individually and collectively (Tobin, 2010). In the recent DDI study (DDI, 2021), during the COVID-19 pandemic with its uncertainty, leaders want two things: more time to learn and greater external validation that their learning is addressing the right things. Impacts of environmental factors on leadership development An effect of COVID-19 is the impact on people\u2019s health and well-being. According to the most recent DDI Global Leadership Forecast (DDI, 2021), compared to 6% of other leaders, 26% of leaders experiencing burnout plan to leave their job within a year. 24% of other leaders expect to leave their job to advance versus 44% of leaders experiencing burnout. Even high-potential leaders feel the burn: 86% are at risk of burnout. Alain Dehaze, CEO of Adecco, notes that workers wanting a purpose-driven life, the increase of remote work, and greater concern for employee well-being have driven organizations to approach talent acquisition differently and reconsider personnel policies (Naravanan, 2022). Effects of leadership development efforts CEOs have long been concerned with the capability of their leadership. Their challenges are well-founded (DDI, 2021). Developing the next generation of leaders concerns 55% of the leaders; attracting and retaining top talent concerns 52% of them. Evidence has already been cited recognizing the importance of collaboration in the way work gets done. Teamwork and leading teams well will become even more relevant, whether the teams are intact or ad hoc, and certainly when the teamwork is cross-functional, such as on senior leadership teams and special projects (Edmondson, 2012). In addition, as the incidence of mergers and cross-sector partnerships increases, the need for effective teaming becomes crucial to business success (Edmondson and Harvey, 2017). Leading those teams well takes enhanced skills and mature temperaments. With COVID-19 and its work location displacements, managers must now develop new capabilities to engage and manage remote and hybrid teamwork. Yet, only one in five managers rated themselves as effective at leading virtual teams (DDI, 2021). Edmondson (2019) found that the psychological safety managers could create with their people was an essential component to spur learning and avoid preventable failures.\n\u00dc\u00d1\u00d7\u00e6 \u00ef\u00f0\u00f2\u00ee\u00ec\u00e9\u00e8\u00f1\u00b0\u00b7\u00bd\u00be\u00bb\u00f3\u00ee\u00f0\u00ee\u00ee\u00f3\u00f0\u00f0\u00e9\u00ee\u00f4 \u00b0\u00b0\u00f2 \u00e9\u00e9\u00ee\u00f3\u00e9\u00e8\u00ec\u00f4 \u00d7\u00cd\u00cd\u00d2 \u00ee\u00eb\u00eb\u00e8\u00f3\u00e7\u00ea\u00eb\u00ee \u00a4\nPICBE |\n775\nThe other aspect was how well the managers could set context (purpose, high standards, meaningfulness of the work, tools, information, processes, and structures) to be successful. The behaviors managers take to foster psychological safety (Edmondson, 2012) can enable groups moving through the successive development stages of inclusion, learning, contribution, and challenge (Clark, 2020). Refined approaches for developing leaders The DDI (2021) study looked closely at what seemed to differentially contribute to leadership quality. The study identified the skills leaders need most urgently now for continued development: coaching and developing others, building partnerships, delegation, and empathy. The most urgent needs in the next three years are: building talent, managing change, digital acumen, strategic thinking, and influencing. In practice, only 28% of leaders are being developed in any of these critical leadership skills. There are other contributing factors that refine our understanding of effective leadership development. They include a humancentric approach to leadership (Boston Consulting Group, 2021; Cohen and Roeske-Zummer, 2021; Cuddy et al., 2013; Institute of Coaching, 2021) and enabling vertical development (Anderson and Adams, 2016). These can be enabling attitudes and behaviors that support psychological safety (Edmondson, 2019). As noted by the Institute of Coaching (2021, p. 10) leaders are recognizing they need to expand their roles beyond the one of striving for organizational results to engage deeply with the individual and collective experiences of employees. The future of leadership is then a combination of compassion, human-centered leadership with agile, adaptive, and generative leadership of systems. Developing leaders to the next stage of their development is a journey, not an event. It moves leaders towards a more compassionate, appreciative, and human-centric approach. A more effective leadership culture is positively correlated with a more successful organization. Though the traditional approach to leadership development has been through formal programs, research suggests that taking a 70-20- 10 approach to the developmental contributions (mentioned above) works even more effectively (CCL, 2020, Rabin, 2014). Coaching skills, whether provided through internal or external sources, have proven to be effective by themselves and as force multipliers (Peterson, 2010; Phillips et al., 2012; Schlosser et al., 2006), and are part of the developmental mix (DDI, 2021; Rabin, 2014). Applications of a blended, human-centric approach to leadership This paper shares and discusses two examples of best practices. The first is a project recently completed by Alberta Health Services (AHS) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is a blended (mixed intervention) solution to enhance system-wide data access through newly designed platforms (collaboration sites) and innovation leadership. The second best practices example builds on the cross-cultural research recently reported by the Boston Consulting Group (2021). The Romanian team identified how a human\u2013oriented approach can be applied to their business environment.\n\u00d3\u00bb\u00ac\u00b8\u00b1\u00bc\u00b1\u00b4\u00b1\u00b9\u00a7 The main methodologies applied include: literature review; a case study with best practices (Alberta Health Services (AHS)); a comparative analysis of different countries\u2019 approaches to best practices (Boston Consulting Group); qualitative research; statistical data analysis; and synthesis. This research is qualitative oriented research that uses secondary data collected, relevant studies and case studies. Our focus on qualitative research took into account the structure of the team that includes two executives with international well recognized leadership expertise.\n\u00dc\u00d1\u00d7\u00e6 \u00ef\u00f0\u00f2\u00ee\u00ec\u00e9\u00e8\u00f1\u00b0\u00b7\u00bd\u00be\u00bb\u00f3\u00ee\u00f0\u00ee\u00ee\u00f3\u00f0\u00f0\u00e9\u00ee\u00f4 \u00b0\u00b0\u00f2 \u00e9\u00e9\u00ee\u00f3\u00e9\u00e8\u00ec\u00f4 \u00d7\u00cd\u00cd\u00d2 \u00ee\u00eb\u00eb\u00e8\u00f3\u00e7\u00ea\u00eb\u00ee \u00a4\nPICBE |\n776\nDuring three months of constructive dialogue based on weekly Zoom meetings and Internet communication we designed a profile of the human-centered leadership as a possible solution to be applied in Romania during times of crises and post-crisis.\n\u00ce\u00bb\u00ab\u00b4\u00ac Against the backdrop of the literature review on leadership, this section will discuss three sources of results that can extend our understanding of leadership, human-centered leadership, and its role in decision making for resource allocations, including investing in leadership development. The first is a case study presented by the second author about Alberta Health Services in Canada. It describes the systemic and systematic approach taken to develop innovation leadership and provide an accompanying toolkit, while transforming systems. The second is a comparative study conducted by Boston Consulting Group across four countries. It looked at best practices that would foster more effective leadership, a human-centered set of practices. The third is a recent research study of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic well-being of Romania. Specific issues concerning leadership issues are included in the Conclusions section. \u00dd\u00bf\u00bb \u00ac\u00ab\u00bc\u00a7\u00f2 Alberta Health Services\u00f4 \u00dd\u00bf\u00b2\u00bf\u00bc\u00bf According to Gartner, by 2023, more than 33% of large organizations will have analysts practicing decision intelligence, including decision modeling (Groombridge and Karamouzis, 2021). Organizations face complex business scenarios and uncertainty on how to proceed to minimize risk. The faster and easier they can make informed decisions, the better. Decision intelligence (DI) becomes a practical discipline. It supports and optimizes the decision processes at strategic, tactical, and operational levels. At Alberta Health Services (AHS), enabling contextual decision making is critical since AHS is the first and largest province-wide, fully integrated health system in Canada (Alberta Health Services, 2022). Data Driven Decision making (DDD) is connected to the high levels of complements (particularly ITC, high skilled workers), and awareness (Brynjolfsson and McElheran, 2016). Leaders need to: (a) place themselves in organizational context and select frameworks, strategies, and tools to shape people\u2019 skills and abilities to enable strategy execution; (b) transform, adapt, and build new transformation and innovation leadership capabilities in a VUCA (\u00caolatile, \u00cbncertain, \u00ddomplex, and \u00dfmbiguous) environment. To build a toolset for leaders, can be represented by a Leadership Knowledge Tree (Figure 1). It allows the integration of tools, methods and frameworks to guide leaders through their journey within a dynamic learning model.\n\u00da\u00b7\u00b9\u00ab\u00ae\u00bb \u00ef\u00f2 \u00d4\u00bb\u00bf\u00bc\u00bb\u00ae\u00b8\u00b7\u00b0 \u00d5\u00b2\u00b1\u00a9\u00b4\u00bb\u00bc\u00b9\u00bb \u00cc\u00ae\u00bb\u00bb \u0160 \u00bf \u00bd\u00b1\u00b4\u00b4\u00bb\u00bd\u00ac\u00b7\u00b1\u00b2 \u00b1\u00ba \u00ba\u00ae\u00bf\u00b3\u00bb\u00a9\u00b1\u00ae\u00b5\u00f4 \u00ac\u00b1\u00b1\u00b4\u00f4 \u00bd\u00b1\u00b2\u00bd\u00bb\u00b0\u00ac Source: Alberta Health Services (2022).\n\u00dc\u00d1\u00d7\u00e6 \u00ef\u00f0\u00f2\u00ee\u00ec\u00e9\u00e8\u00f1\u00b0\u00b7\u00bd\u00be\u00bb\u00f3\u00ee\u00f0\u00ee\u00ee\u00f3\u00f0\u00f0\u00e9\u00ee\u00f4 \u00b0\u00b0\u00f2 \u00e9\u00e9\u00ee\u00f3\u00e9\u00e8\u00ec\u00f4 \u00d7\u00cd\u00cd\u00d2 \u00ee\u00eb\u00eb\u00e8\u00f3\u00e7\u00ea\u00eb\u00ee \u00a4\nPICBE |\n777\nIn the context of digital transformation, one of the challenges for AHS is to develop leaders able to transform systems, to adopt and adapt the existing AHS technologies & platforms. Develop leaders able to transform systems. Leaders must be able to lead effectively (engage employees, set successful projects, provide scope, processes) and scale team/organization capacity and capability to create the desired outcomes. \\ Adopt and adapt the existing AHS technologies and platforms must respond to foundational business needs (collaboration, engagement, project management, reporting) and specific business needs (strategic dashboards, simulators, education, orientation modules). The purpose is to embed decision intelligence in day-to-day processes and improve efficiency/effectiveness and staff engagement/satisfaction. The Solution From a leader\u2019s development perspective\u00f4 in healthcare, the development of the leadership capabilities follows the LEADS (Lead Self, Engage Others, Achieve Results, Develop Coalitions, System Transformation) model in a caring environment framework. LEADS represents an innovative and integrated investment in the future of health leadership in Canada. \u201cIt provides a comprehensive approach to leadership development for the Canadian health sector, including leadership within the whole-system, within the health organizations, and within individual leaders'' (Alberta Health Services, 2022). All the LEADS framework capabilities are equally important in building the current and future leaders in healthcare. Depending on the context of the role that one has within the organization, additional leadership capabilities need to be built. When the leader role is manifested for the purpose of Innovation, these relate to Transformational and Innovation leadership. Transformational leadership (TL) inspires innovation. It encourages employees to scan the trends, focus on the impact their work can bring to the organization, and function as a single entity with a common goal in mind \u2013 innovate to achieve service excellence. TL is considered one of the most dominant leadership styles facilitating innovation capabilities (Le and Lei, 2019; Islam et al., 2018). TL has greater influence on organizational innovation capability while knowledge sharing activities has greater influence on individual innovation capabilities (Lathong et al., 2021). Innovation leadership (IL) reflects the ability to inspire productive action in yourself and others during times of creation, invention, uncertainty, ambiguity, and risk. It is a necessary competency for organizations that develop innovation (Cone, 2019). Mastering IL starts within the person, being aware of how they show up and what their intentions are. It is about being (a participant and observer of the innovation work), doing (navigating through VUCA, experimenting, learning) and fueling (creating a safe environment and thought diversity) innovation leadership. From a technology perspective, Collaborative Sites (CS) - SharePoint, Tableau, and other applications \u2013 were developed to respond to the foundational business needs. Leaders created environment project teams to experiment with Proof-of-Concept iterations and promote thought diversity. Implementation of CS in business was designed, based on the maturity from a digital competencies perspective and current working approaches. From a staff perspective, a new role, Business Steward (BS) was developed to lead the digital transformation in business. BS became the change management ambassadors and the liaison with the technology team. The project team was cross-functional and structured in an agile way. Leaders are looking to create an environment for staff to build new digital competencies (netiquette, digital content & learning, collaboration & engagement, and DI).

COVID-19 generated complex, and dynamic challenges, \"humanity\" and \"collaboration\" being essential to face them. The European Investment Bank (EIB) conducted a survey that illustrated the impact for European Union countries (European Investment Bank, 2022). COVID's impact on investment was significant. 38% of firms revised their investment plans. COVID-19 generated an increase in the use of digital technologies (53% implementing ITC). Digitalization is expected to amplify in the long-term (as 49% of firms indicated). The main long-term obstacles are uncertainty about the future (80%) and availability of qualified staff (73%). Due to COVID most Romanian firms decreased innovation activities. 25% developed and introduced new services, products, processes as part of their innovative programs. 28% of firms experienced an increase in their debt. 65% of the firms received financial support. 47% of firms report a decrease of their sales, compared to 2020. Figure 8 illustrates how the firms responded to the crisis. In Romania, six out of ten firms (61%) took actions to respond to COVID19, in line with the EU (57%). Their most important actions are: digital investments (45%), new product development (29%) and shortening supply chain (20%). Large firms (67%) took more short-term actions in response to COVID-19 than SMEs (54%).\n\u00ea\u00ec\u00fb \u00ea\u00ea\u00fb \u00ea\u00e9\u00fb \u00ea\u00f0\u00fb\n\u00ea\u00eb\u00fb\n\u00eb\u00f0\u00fb\n\u00ea\u00f0\u00fb\n\u00e9\u00f0\u00fb\n\u00dc\u00d1\u00d7\u00e6 \u00ef\u00f0\u00f2\u00ee\u00ec\u00e9\u00e8\u00f1\u00b0\u00b7\u00bd\u00be\u00bb\u00f3\u00ee\u00f0\u00ee\u00ee\u00f3\u00f0\u00f0\u00e9\u00ee\u00f4 \u00b0\u00b0\u00f2 \u00e9\u00e9\u00ee\u00f3\u00e9\u00e8\u00ec\u00f4 \u00d7\u00cd\u00cd\u00d2 \u00ee\u00eb\u00eb\u00e8\u00f3\u00e7\u00ea\u00eb\u00ee \u00a4\nPICBE |\n781\n\u00da\u00b7\u00b9\u00ab\u00ae\u00bb \u00e8\u00f2 \u00cd\u00b8\u00b1\u00ae\u00ac\u00f3\u00ac\u00bb\u00ae\u00b3 \u00bf\u00bd\u00ac\u00b7\u00b1\u00b2 \u00bf \u00bf \u00ae\u00bb\u00ab\u00b4\u00ac \u00b1\u00ba \u00dd\u00b1\u00aa\u00b7\u00bc\u00f3\u00ef\u00e7 Source: European Investment Bank (2022), adapted by authors.\nIn Romania main investment priorities are: expansion of production capacity (35%), replacement of existing buildings and equipment (27%), development of products (27%), and services (25%).

This directly affects the role of human resources/talent management (HR/TM). Leadership development based on fresh thinking is leading to new perspectives and emergent practices. Leadership is being thought of as a values-driven set of practices to be broadly distributed. Collective leadership, within a leadership team and across management functions, should be developed and maintained. Doing so will bring and keep competitive advantage. There is no one recipe for the selection of the \u201cright attributes\u201d of transformational leadership, innovation leadership, or any other leadership practices. We are now challenged by a broader, human-oriented approach. Developing a coaching approach to engaging one\u2019s people is likely to produce satisfying and productive interactions. Coaching itself is a catalyst to accelerate learning and innovation, improve performance, and enhance fulfillment. Meaningful, friendly relationships at work provide a second critical element; peers, even more than managers, are the linchpin of this piece of the puzzle. Leaders will have a key role in encouraging and creating situations where connections can be made and developed. The programmatic piece will rest with HR/TM. They will be in the best position to include aspects of change management, innovation, knowledge management, and adult development to increase the effectiveness of their efforts. The purview of how they play may shift to assessing leaders for their strengths and weaknesses; offering a core leadership program for all leaders; supporting managers to elevate their \u201csoft\u201d and analytic skill sets and engage with human-centric practices. By connecting emergent leadership practices to related values, beliefs, mindsets, and practices for the organization\u2019s culture (by providing ways to measure progress and results) will enable continuous improvement and learning edges for innovation. As for the social, practice and policy implications, the paper highlighted that there will be challenges at every step of the way: from fixed to growth mindsets; from reactive tendencies growing into creative and innovative competencies; from mechanistic organizational models to those of complex, adaptive systems where employees are valued (as valuable individuals and teams). COVID crisis challenged leaders to face complex situations (from a psychological, physiological, social and economic perspective). We included a case study from the Canadian health system (AHS) as an example of best practice illustrating that human-centered leaders are able to identify quick, effective, efficient, innovative and useful solutions. The most important limit of this study concerns its interdisciplinary approach. This limit had been transformed as an opportunity to learn by sharing experiences and knowledge originating from different perspectives (coaching, innovative leadership and economics). As concerning further research this paper demonstrates there are numerous opportunities for international collaboration and research on topics of mutual interest and broad benefits. We hope these might foster and accelerate implementation of a human-centered vision of business in Romania.\n\u00df\u00bd\u00b5\u00b2\u00b1\u00a9\u00b4\u00bb\u00bc\u00b9\u00b3\u00bb\u00b2\u00ac Special acknowledgement for the AHS Innovation and Business Intelligence team being creative in how they managed to navigate complex situations and quickly adapt to achieve desired results.
