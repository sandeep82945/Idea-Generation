    "abstractText": "The pandemic on SARS-CoV-2 infection has adversely impacted mankind all over the globe and more importantly, amidst individuals having Type-2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) as well as among those who produce SARS-CoV-2 intricacies. Humoral and T cell-mediated immunity are adaptive immunity has a pivotal role to play in removing pathogens, comprising SARS-CoV-2. The infected cells are being eliminated by the primarily cytotoxic CD8+ T cells as well as certain antibodies in opposition to SARSCoV-2 among humoral immunological responses possess the capacity for neutralizing this virus or by eliminating the infected cells with the support of cytotoxic in order to manage the progression of the disease. This cross-sectional study was carried out between January 2022 to December 2022. The serum samples were used to analyze SARS-CoV-2 total Ab among individuals having and not having T2DM and several metabolic risk factors like hypertension using WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab ELISA Kit. There were 354 individuals, of which 141 (39.8%) had T2DM and 213 (60.2%) were nondiabetic patients. T2DM showed reduced antibody levels (average 5 AU/ml) than those without diabetes (average 12 AU/ ml). SARS-CoV2 total antibody levels are considerably lower in hypertension patients (8 AU/ml) over those who are normotensive (14 AU/ml). The present study implies that the continuous monitoring of the total antibody profile of SARS-CoV-2 that may be a practical strategy to help individuals with T2DM and hypertension to determine their need of precautionary doses for sustaining SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by producing immunity for protection against infections.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates as 6.6 million populations have been deceased due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has affected 651 million people globally as of December 23, 2022.1 The pandemic on SARSCoV-2 infection has adversely impacted mankind all over the globe up to a remarkable level, more importantly, amidst individuals having Type-2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) as well as among those who have additional causative factors in order to produce SARS-CoV-2 intricacies.2 Case fatality rates might surge 10% as a result of prior medical complications including cardiovascular disease, T2DM, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension. Also, the development of metabolic inflammation, a condition of chronic, low-grade inflammation, and compromised innate/adaptive immunity may enhance the vulnerability of T2DM patients to the increasing difficulties of SARS-CoV-2 infections.3,4 To a strong sense of urgency, SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations have been created at a tremendous rate., BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer\u2013BioNTech vaccine) which is the first mRNA vaccine, was authorized in the United Kingdom by the European Medicine Agency on November 02, 2020. Two vaccines in India include ChAdOx1-nCOV (CovishieldTM) and BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) have received approval under the Emergency Use Authorization, which began on January 16, 2021. ChAdOx1-nCOV is developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca using a vaccine that is recombinant replicationdeficient chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored which codes spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 from human embryonic kidney 293 cells that are genetically engineered.5,6,7 BBV152 is a whole virion vaccine that is inactivated by \u00df-propiolactone and has an adjuvant made of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and Toll-like receptor 7/8. It was created cooperatively by Bharat Biotech through the Indian Council of Medical Research, Hyderabad. Particularly, immunological alterations among humans are caused as a result of acquired infections or humoral responses to vaccination.8 As a result of long-lived memory B cell generation, antibody-secreting cells (ASC) are also efficient in boosting recall responses when exposed to the same antigens again. Memory B cells take the lead in recall response for producing new antibodies for starting the reaction of the germinal center in manufacturing antibodies or production of newer ASC once the failure in the production of immunity occurred because of circulating antibodies.9 Experts suggest that immunological memories (antibodies and memory B cells) last around 6 months. Therefore, following the exposure of antigen, the chronic inflammation caused by obesity may reduce the activation of macrophages, production of innate cytokine, and decrease pro-inflammatory mechanisms. These modified, obesogenic conditions might slightly elucidate the existence of vaccine escape mechanisms and antiviral resistance in people with T2DM and/or obesity.10 Likewise, Obesity impairs the responses of B and T cell, particularly among persons with type 2 diabetes who are obese. Immune response dysregulation is also a further consequence of the adverse hormonal environment.11,12 Generally, due to the increased production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines/ chemokines including TNF- a, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-18, IL-12, RANTES, IL-6, MCP-1, and obese T2DM patients frequently have impaired innate/ adaptive immunity. In fact, all of these bioactive inflammatory proteins have been linked to a higher risk of having SARS-CoV-2 problems.13,14 Therefore, in the present study, responses of humoral immunity were compared among individuals having and not having T2DM and several metabolic risk factors like hypertension and obesity. Also, in this article, we provide data demonstrating levels of SARS-COV-2-specific antibodies among communities having increased incidence of T2DM."

            "text": "This recent work was done for estimating the SARS-CoV-2- total antibodies among 354 adults with both diabetic and non-diabetics, following two doses of BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) and ChAdOx1nCOV (CovishieldTM). Of which 141 (39.8%) had T2DM and 213 (60.2%) were nondiabetic patients. Out of these 354 people, 95 (26.1%) had hypertension and 259 (73.1%) had normotension as same results were determined in the research work conducted by Hamad Ali et al which shows that 26.3% were found to have hypertension and 73.7% had normotensive.15 Then, it is analyzed in relation to diabetes status, gender, BMI, time after the second dosage, and hypertension. Regarding age, gender, and BMI there were no appreciable differences in the overall SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in our research population as they were also associated with the study findings of Pellini R et al shows no significance regarding age, gender and BMI.16 The present study involves substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2- total antibodies levels among T2DM population that are comprehensible because several defects of the immune system like neutrophil function, and macrophage/ monocyte impairment, dysfunction of the complement system, defects in antigen presentation, as well as the decreased proliferation of lymphocyte were known to be induced by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.17 Our findings indicate that high levels of SARS-CoV-2- total antibodies are almost\nFigure. Clinical Characteristics of diabetic and non-diabetic participants\nwww.microbiologyjournal.org400Journal of Pure and Applied Microbiology\nnine times more than the seropositivity threshold (9.5 AU/ml,), were recorded following vaccination as same as Klinger J et al., which showed nearly 8 times of the threshold raise.18 Robust levels of SARS-CoV-2- total antibodies in the present cohort study after BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) and ChAdOx1-nCOV (CovishieldTM) in two doses show that all people have effective processing and presentation of antigens, suggested like different BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) and ChAdOx1-nCOV (CovishieldTM) vaccination studies in diverse cohorts.15,16 Inhibition of the ACE2 receptor interaction and the spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be strongly positively correlated with viral neutralization experiments.19,20 Additionally, we looked at whether having type 2 diabetes affected the effectiveness of the humoral immune response to the BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) and ChAdOx1-nCOV (CovishieldTM) vaccination.21 To that purpose, the information demonstrating elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2total antibodies among T2DM cohort is reliable and the study showing that diabetic patients\u2019 humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 were equivalent to those of non-diabetic patients in terms of antibody titers. However, these reports were in accordance with the results derived the study conducted by Ali H et al., Chen Y et al. and Alagheband Bahrami, A et al.22,23 The levels of SARS-CoV2 total antibody is significantly reduced in patients with hypertension (average 8 AU/ml) than in those without hypertension (average 14 AU/ml). However, these outcomes coordinated with a study report which is conducted by Pellini R et al. shows an average between 6-10 AU/ml.16 In a study conducted by Hamad Ali et al., it was reported that there is equal potency beyond >60 age showed reduced vaccination efficiency among persons with chronic comorbidities, including T2DM, although the T2DM population\u2019s humoral immunity and our findings were concomitant with the present study results as they have demonstrated decreased efficacy towards vaccination.15 There is emerging evidence that individuals with T2DM may have insufficient immune responses to humoral immunity against infection, placing them at a high risk of contracting the illness again.24 It should be noted that due to their increased risk of infection and inadequate prognostic techniques, patients having type-2 diabetes might need vaccinations first.25 According to research on antibody titers conducted 7 days following the vaccination second dose, humoral immunity significantly influences gender, age but not hypertension.26,27 Study results based on the discrepancies between BBV-152 (CovaxinTM) and ChAdOx1-nCOV (CovishieldTM) report the influence of hypertension, gender, age, BMI, diabetic status and its comorbidities on immune responses may be related to variations in cohorts, after the second dosage.28,29"

Nevertheless, compared to non-diabetics, T2DM sample possessed substantially reduced antibody titers; however, antibody titers do not significantly affect age, hypertension, gender and BMI. It is significant to note that continuous monitoring of the total antibody profile of SARS-CoV-2 may be a practical strategy to help individuals with T2DM determine their unique needs for precautionary doses for the maintenance of immune responses among SARSCoV-2 vaccines."
