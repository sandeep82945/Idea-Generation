    "abstractText": "We study a Jarzysnki type equality for work in systems that are monitored using non-projective unsharp measurements. The information acquired by the observer from the outcome f of an energy measurement, and the subsequent conditioned normalized state \u03c1\u0302(t, f) evolved up to a final time t are used to define work, as the difference between the final expectation value of the energy and the result f of the measurement. The Jarzynski equality obtained depends on the coherences that the state develops during the process, the characteristics of the meter used to measure the energy and the noise it induces into the system. We analyze those contributions in some detail to unveil their role. We show that in very particular cases, but not in general, the effect of such noise gives a factor multiplying the result that would be obtained if projective measurements were used instead of non-projective ones. The unsharp character of the measurements used to monitor the energy of the system, which defines the resolution of the meter, leads to different scenarios of interest. In particular, if the distance between neighboring elements in the energy spectrum is much larger than the resolution of the meter, then a similar result to the projective measurement case is obtained, up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the meter. A more subtle situation arises in the opposite case in which measurements may be non-informative, i.e. they may not contribute to update the information about the system. In this case a correction to the relation obtained in the non-overlapping case appears. We analyze the conditions in which such a correction becomes negligible. We also study the coherences, in terms of the relative entropy of coherence developed by the evolved post-measurement state. We illustrate the results by analyzing a two-level system monitored by a simple meter.",

The information acquired by the observer from the outcome f of an energy measurement, and the subsequent conditioned normalized state \u03c1\u0302(t, f) evolved up to a final time t are used to define work, as the difference between the final expectation value of the energy and the result f of the measurement. The Jarzynski equality obtained depends on the coherences that the state develops during the process, the characteristics of the meter used to measure the energy and the noise it induces into the system. We analyze those contributions in some detail to unveil their role. We show that in very particular cases, but not in general, the effect of such noise gives a factor multiplying the result that would be obtained if projective measurements were used instead of non-projective ones. The unsharp character of the measurements used to monitor the energy of the system, which defines the resolution of the meter, leads to different scenarios of interest. In particular, if the distance between neighboring elements in the energy spectrum is much larger than the resolution of the meter, then a similar result to the projective measurement case is obtained, up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the meter. A more subtle situation arises in the opposite case in which measurements may be non-informative, i.e. they may not contribute to update the information about the system. In this case a correction to the relation obtained in the non-overlapping case appears. We analyze the conditions in which such a correction becomes negligible. We also study the coherences, in terms of the relative entropy of coherence developed by the evolved post-measurement state. We illustrate the results by analyzing a two-level system monitored by a simple meter.\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Yz, 03.67.Ta, 03.75.Gg"

            "text": "Fluctuation Theorems have been one of the most relevant results of statistical physics in recent decades. The pioneering work of Evans, Morris and Searles [1, 2], Gallavotti, Cohen [3, 4], Jarzynski [5, 6], and Crooks [7] has been followed by a series of significant results that have highlighted their conceptual depth, as well as its relevance and applicability in many different fields [8\u201312]. In particular, work fluctuations are one of the issues that have attracted more attention. The most widely used approach to study work fluctuations considers a two-point measurement scheme, in which work is defined as the difference between the outcomes of two projective energy measurements [13]. Specifically, given an initial state, a first projective energy measurement is made, afterwards the system evolves unitarily under the dynamics dictated by a time dependent Hamiltonian. Then, at a given final time, a second projective energy measurement is performed. Work is defined as the difference between the energies obtained in the two measurements. Although this scheme has been widely explored and has been very fruitful, there are still important open issues that need to be addressed.\nAfter the first energy measurement, the system is projected onto an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian. The unitary evolution that follows generally develop coherences in the eigenbasis of the final Hamiltonian. Such coherences disappear once the second energy measurement is performed. In this sense the two-point measurement scheme does not include some important quantum features.\nIt has been shown two physically necessary properties of quantum work, namely, respecting the classical limit and obeying the first law of thermodynamics, cannot be simultaneously measured. Considering these results, schemes have been proposed to estimate fluctuating work using global measurements in which the backaction of the measurement can be reduced, and thus approximately describe coherent transformations [14].\nAnother aspect concerns the nature of the measurements performed. In general, if the energy measurement is made using a meter that has a finite resolution, the result obtained may not correspond to any of the eigenenergies of the measured Hamiltonian [15]. Even so, the measurements may be sufficiently informative to conclude that the\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n13 22\n5v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 6\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 post-measurement state will be a given eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. In general, the meter will induce some noise into the system, and therefore work fluctuations will be affected [16, 17]. Once the first measurement has been made, knowledge of the conditioned post-measurement state, as well as the unitary operator that dictates the subsequent time evolution provide sufficient information to obtain the expected value of the energy at the final time. In the case of projective measurements, the difference between such energy value and the result obtained in the first measurement has been used as a definition for work in [18\u201321]. Remarkably, this definition for work makes possible to derive a modified Jarzynski quantum equality that evidences the role played by the projective measurements and their cost [18]. Notice that the possibility of obtaining work fluctuations from a single measurement was already pointed out in [22] and for open quantum systems and end-point measurement scheme has been proposed [23]. Also, several measurement protocols have been proposed to obtain the probality distribution of work done on a quantum system using an ancilla or quantum detector. The key point in these schemes is the system-detector interaction considered to couple the system energy operator with an observable of the detector. Then, the information about work statistics is encoded in the quantum state of the detector [24]. More recently it has been shown that the quantum Jarynski equality arises as a particular case of a general quantum fluctuation theorem for the entropy production of an open quantum system coupled to multiple environments, not necessarily at equilibrium [25].\nIn the limit of non-precise measurements, it is interesting to study how non-projective measurements affect work fluctuations and unveil the role of coherences. Also, the effect of the meter used to measure the energy, the relevance of the initial state, and its average energy in the quantum Jarzynski relation that would emerge, could be analyzed.\nIn this work, we begin by briefly introducing the two energy measurement approach mostly used in quantum mechanical analysis of work. In particular, we show the Jarsynski equality that arises when all energy measurements are projective. We then focus on a more general setting in which the meter that monitors the system performs unsharp measurements in which the outcomes are not reproducible. We show how these non-projective measurements can be described. Within this approach, we consider a definition of work based on a single non-projective energy measurement performed at a given time and the subsequent unitary evolution of the post-measurement state. We obtain the generalized Jarsynski equality that arises in this case, and which makes explicit the role of the measuring apparatus and coherences in work fluctuations. We perform a detailed analysis of the different effects that contribute to such equality. Specifically, we study the coherences, the noise induced by measurement and the information acquired by the observer from measurement outcomes. To illustrate the analysis we consider a two-level system monitored by a simple meter that performs unsharp measurements, characterized by a given conditional probability of outcomes. We study the different scenarios that arise depending on the measurement conditions, defined by the energy resolution of the meter in comparison to the energy spectrum of the system."

            "text": "The definition of work has been widely discussed in quantum mechanical analysis of work fluctuations [11, 26] as it is known that no hermitian operator can be assigned to work [27]. The most widely used approach is based on two energy measurements, the first one at the beginning of the process and the second one at the end. Work is defined as the difference of the two energy outcomes [13, 28]. There are also some proposals based on a single measure of energy, whereby work can be obtained from a single final generalized energy measurement [22]. We now briefly introduce the two-point protocol to fix the notation.\nWe consider a system described by a time dependent Hamiltonian H\u0302(\u03bb(t)) := H\u0302(t), where \u03bb(t) defines the protocol corresponding to an external driving. We assume that at initial time t = t0 the system is in thermal equilibrium with a thermal bath at T temperature. Thus, it is in a Gibbs state given by \u03c1\u0302th(t0) = Z(t0)\u22121 exp (\u2212\u03b2H\u0302(t0)), with \u03b2 = (kBT )\n\u22121 and Z(t0) = Tr exp (\u2212\u03b2H\u0302(t0)), where the trace is over the Hilbert space of the system. In the so called forward protocol, at time t = t+0 it is performed a projective measurement of the energy of the\nsystem, given by H\u0302(t0) = \u2211 \u00b5 \u00b5|\u00b5\u3009\u3008\u00b5| \u2261 \u2211 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u03a0\u0302\u00b5. If the result of the measurement is \u00b5, the post-measurement state becomes\n\u03c1\u0302(t+0 , \u00b5) = P \u22121 \u00b5 \u03a0\u0302\u00b5\u03c1\u0302th(0)\u03a0\u0302\u00b5, (1)\nwith P\u00b5 = Tr \u03a0\u0302\u00b5\u03c1\u0302th(0) the probability of finding the energy \u00b5 as a result of the measurement. After this first energy measurement, the system evolves up to time t = t1 according to the unitary evolution operator U\u0302(t1, t0), which is a solution of the Schro\u0308dinger equation\ni~\u2202tU\u0302(t1, t0) = H\u0302(t)U\u0302(t1, t0), (2)\n3 with the initial condition U\u0302(t0, t0) = 1\u0302. Then, the conditional state of the system at time t = t1 is given by\n\u03c1\u0302(t1, \u00b5) = U\u0302(t1, t0)\u03c1\u0302(t + 0 , \u00b5)U\u0302 \u2020(t1, t0). (3)\nAt time t = t1 it is performed a second projective measurement of the energy H\u0302(t1) = \u2211 \u03bd \u03bd|\u03bd\u3009\u3008\u03bd|, leading to the outcome \u03bd. Given the energy values obtained in the two projective measurements, one can compose the variable W = \u03bd \u2212 \u00b5. Due to the intrinsic randomness of the measurement process and the fact that the initial state is mixed, W is a random variable. We denote PF (W ) its corresponding probability distribution.\nWe now consider a second setting, the so called backward protocol, in which at initial time t = t1 the system has the Hamiltonian H\u0302(t1) and it is prepared in a thermal state \u03c1\u0302th(t1) = Z(t1)\u22121 exp (\u2212\u03b2H\u0302(t1)). At this time value a first projective measurement of energy leads to the outcome \u03bd\u2032. Then the system evolves in such a way that after a time interval t1\u2212 t0 the Hamiltonian becomes H\u0302(t0), and a second energy measurement gives the result \u00b5\u2032. The state of the system after this second measurement can be expressed as\n\u03c1\u0302\u2032(t0) = P \u22121(\u00b5\u2032, \u03bd\u2032)\u03a0\u0302\u00b5\u2032U\u0302(t0, t1)\u03a0\u0302\u03bd\u2032 \u03c1\u0302th(t1)\u03a0\u0302\u03bd\u2032U\u0302 \u2020(t0, t1)\u03a0\u0302\u00b5\u2032 , (4)\nwith P (\u00b5\u2032, \u03bd\u2032) the joint probability distribution of the outcomes \u00b5\u2032 and \u03bd\u2032. As in the forward protocol, the variable W \u2032 = \u00b5\u2032 \u2212 \u03bd\u2032 is a random variable with probability distribution PB(W \u2032).\nThe Fluctuation Theorem elucidates a subtle symmetry between the forward and backward probability distributions, PF and PB , namely [7]\nPF (W ) = e \u2212\u03b2(F (t1)\u2212F (t0)\u2212W )PB(\u2212W ) = e\u2212\u03b2(\u2206F\u2212W )PB(\u2212W ) , (5)\nwhere F = \u2212kBT lnZ is the Helmholtz free energy. From such relation it follows the Jarzynski equality [5, 6, 9]\u2329 e\u03b2(\u2206F\u2212W ) \u232a = 1 . (6)\nIn the above discussion, all energy measurements were projective so the state of the system just after each measurement was an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, according to the projection postulate, if two consecutive measurements were made, the resulting outcome energies would be the same. In this sense, measurements are reproducible. One may consider a more general setting in which the meter that monitors the system does not perform projective measurements but unsharp ones in which the outcomes are not reproducible, in the sense that two consecutive measurements will give different results [29].\nA way to describe non-precise measurements is to consider the conditional probability G(f |a) of certain outcome record f if the system is in an eigenstate compatible with the eigenvalue a [15, 30]. In general, such conditional probability is a function centered around a and presents some width \u03c3 that it is interpreted as the measurement error. Notably, there is a fluctuation theorem for those situations [16] that incorporates the details of the measurement through the Fourier transform of the conditional probability G(f |0). In this context, Fluctuation Theorems for thermodynamics observables and dynamics described by complete positive trace preserving maps have been reported [31].\nIn both the projective and non-projective measurement schemes, the work W done on the system is defined as the difference of the outcomes of two energy measurements."

            "text": "Recently, definitions of work based on a single generalized energy measurement performed at an specific time value, and the subsequent unitary evolution of the post-measurement state have been proposed [22]. Such definitions are arguably more consistent from a thermodynamic point of view, especially if the cost of such measurement needs to be taken into account. Remarkably, the introduction of a more consistent definition of work during the measuring process leads to a generalized Jarzynski equality [18], latter extended to open systems in [21]. In this work we consider non-projective measurements, and make explicit the role of the measuring apparatus and coherences in work fluctuations.\nTo start with, we consider that the results of measurements when monitoring a system observable A\u0302 = \u2211 a a|a\u3009\u3008a| can be represented by a continuous real variable f which is located around the spectrum of A\u0302 [15, 30, 32\u201335]. Formally, such a variable can be defined in terms of a set of positive operators\nG\u03021/2(f |A\u0302) \u2261 \u2211 a \u221a G(f |a)|a\u3009\u3008a|, (7)\n4 where the functions G(f |a) are assumed to be real and non-negative in the variable f . We further assume that G(f |a) = G(f \u2212 a). If a measurement of A\u0302 on the state \u03c1\u0302(t) leads to the result f , the post-measurement state becomes\n\u03c1\u0302(t+, f) = P (f)\u22121G\u03021/2(f |A\u0302) \u03c1\u0302(t) G\u0302\u20201/2(f |A\u0302) , (8)\nwhere\nP (f) = Tr G\u03021/2(f |A\u0302) \u03c1\u0302(t) G\u0302\u20201/2(f |A\u0302) \u2261 Tr G\u0302(f |A)\u03c1\u0302(t) (9)\nis the probability density function of obtaining the outcome f . In this sense, we consider unsharp measurements of the observable A\u0302. The operators G\u03021/2(f |A\u0302) satisfy \u222b dfG\u0302\u20201/2(f |A\u0302)G\u03021/2(f |A\u0302) = 1\u0302, which ensures that P (f) is normalized to one. We now consider that at a given time t = t0 the system is in a state \u03c1\u0302(t0). At such time value it is performed an energy measurement which leads to the outcome f0. Then, our state of knowledge of the system changes abruptly and the post-measurement state \u03c1\u0302(t+0 , f0) becomes the normalized conditioned state given by Eq. (8). After this energy measurement, the system undergoes a unitary evolution up to time t = t1, dictated by the evolution operator U\u0302(t1, t + 0 ) corresponding to the Hamiltonian H\u0302(t). The final state of the system can be expressed as\n\u03c1\u0302(t1, f0) = U\u0302(t1, t + 0 )\u03c1\u0302(t + 0 , f0)U\u0302 \u2020(t1, t + 0 ). (10)\nThe outcome f0 and the post-measurement conditioned state \u03c1\u0302(t1, f0) provide enough information to define work as the difference between the expectation value of energy at time t = t1 and the measurement outcome f0 [36]. Thus, the amount of work associated with the unitary evolution from t+0 to t1 under the action of the external driving is defined as\nW (t1, t + 0 , f0) = Tr H\u0302(t1)\u03c1\u0302(t1, f0)\u2212 f0.

            "heading": "Coherences",
            "text": "Coherence is one of the key elements of quantum physics and many of the most fundamental quantum phenomena [38]. It is known that coherences play a role in measurement processes, considered as a change of information between two different basis [39]. Moreover, coherences are involved in the production of entropy in open quantum systems under non-equilibrium conditions as nicely discussed in [40].\nSince the initial state of the system commutes with the initial Hamiltonian, the state immediately following an energy measurement will be diagonal in the eigenbasis of H\u0302(t0). However, during the subsequent unitary evolution leading to state \u03c1\u0302(t1, f), coherences will develop in the eigenbasis of the final Hamiltonian H\u0302(t1). As we will show below, these coherences play a role in the Jarzynski relation (16).\nGiven a Hamiltonian H\u0302(t) = \u2211 \u00b5 |\u00b5(t)\u3009\u00b5(t)\u3008\u00b5(t)|, a dephasing operator relative to the basis {|\u00b5(t)\u3009} and acting on\na state \u03c1\u0302 can be defined as\n\u2206H\u0302(t)\u03c1\u0302 := \u03c1\u0302D = \u2211 \u00b5 |\u00b5(t)\u3009\u3008\u00b5(t)|\u03c1\u0302|\u00b5(t)\u3009\u3008\u00b5(t)|. (17)\nThe action of this operator is to produce a state in the eigenbasis of H(t) and erase all its non-diagonal elements. As a measure of quantum coherence we use the relative entropy of coherence CH(t)(\u03c1\u0302) referred to H\u0302(t) [38, 41], and given by\nCH(t)(\u03c1\u0302) = S(\u03c1\u0302D)\u2212 S(\u03c1\u0302). (18)\nIn general coherence is a basis dependent concept. Here we select the basis that diagonalize the Hamiltonian at the given time and its associated thermal state. In a more extended setting, the role played by coherences in nonequilibrium entropy production has been analyzed in detail in [40].\nIt can be seen that the quantum relative entropy S(\u03c1\u0302(t, f)||\u03c1\u0302th(t)) can be decomposed into two contributions, one due to coherences and another associated with the populations. This last contribution measures the observer\u2019s ability to realize that after many measurements the populations of the final state are given by the state \u03c1\u0302D(t, f), and not by the thermal state \u03c1\u0302th(t) [42]. The coherences are measured by the relative entropy of coherence CH(t)(\u03c1\u0302), whereas the contribution due to the populations is expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence [37]\nDKL(\u03c1\u0302D(t, f)||\u03c1\u0302th(t)) := DKL({p\u00b5}||{q\u00b5}) = \u2211 \u00b5 p\u00b5 ln p\u00b5 q\u00b5 , (19)\nwith p\u00b5 = \u3008\u00b5(t)|\u03c1\u0302D(t, f)|\u00b5(t)\u3009 and q\u00b5 = \u3008\u00b5(t)|\u03c1\u0302th(t)|\u00b5(t)\u3009 the probability distributions associated with populations of the states \u03c1\u0302D(t, f) and \u03c1\u0302th(t), respectively. Notice that the states \u03c1\u0302D(t, f) and \u03c1\u0302th(t) are diagonal in the eigenbasis of H\u0302(t) so they refer to populations in such basis.\nThus, the quantum relative entropy can be written as\nS(\u03c1\u0302(t, f)||\u03c1\u0302th(t)) = CH(t)(\u03c1\u0302(t, f)) +DKL(\u03c1\u0302D(t, f)||\u03c1\u0302th(t)) , (20)\nwhich makes explicit the role of coherences in the Jarzynski equality (15). In particular, at the initial time\nS(\u03c1\u0302(t0)||\u03c1\u0302th(t0)) = CH(t0)(\u03c1\u0302(t0)) +DKL(\u03c1\u0302D(t0)||\u03c1\u0302th(t0)) , (21)\nwhich becomes zero in the case of an initial thermal state \u03c1\u0302(t0) = \u03c1\u0302th(t0).\nInformation gained by the observer in a measurement\nThe term corresponding to the difference of von Neumann entropies \u2206S = S(\u03c1\u0302(t, f)) \u2212 S(\u03c1\u0302(t0)) is related to the amount of information involved in the measurement process. We start by considering the average of \u2206S over the probability distribution P (f), such that\nP (f)\u2206S = P (f) lnP (f)\u2212 Tr G\u0302(f |H\u0302(t0))\u03c1\u0302(t0) ln G\u0302(f |H\u0302(t0))\u2212 Tr ( G\u0302(f |H\u0302(t0))\u2212 P (f) ) \u03c1\u0302(t0) ln \u03c1\u0302(t0). (22)\nFor simplicity we have assumed that the initial state commutes with H(t0).\n6 Then, we introduce the Shannon entropy of a distribution g(f) [37]\nHS(g(f)) = \u2212 \u222b df g(f) ln g(f), (23)\nand integrate Eq. (22) over all possible outcomes f . The resulting average entropy increase is given by\n\u3008\u2206S\u3009 = \u2212HS(P (f)) +HS(G(f |0)), (24)\nwith 0 \u2264 \u3008\u2206S\u3009 \u2264 S(\u03c1(t0)). It is natural that the quantity \u3008\u2206S\u3009 is bounded by the entropy of the initial state when the observer collects its measurements. In the case that the post-measurement state is a pure state, such that \u3008\u2206S\u3009 = S(\u03c1(t0)), the observer can infer the initial state from a sufficient large set of measurements. On the other hand, if \u3008\u2206S\u3009 \u2264 S(\u03c1(t0)) the observer may get outcomes that do not add information about the state after the measurement.\nThus, the term \u2206S is related to the difference of two Shannon entropies for the probability distributions P (f) and G(f |0), which suggest its relation to the net amount of information involved in the measuring process. A more detailed analysis, taking into account the accuracy of the meter, can be done to give meaning to Eq. (24) in terms of information [43].\nNotice that this last term is relevant in the case of non-projective measurements, and it contains the fact that some measurements can be more informative that others."

In contrast to the non-overlapping case, the fluctuation relation can now not be expressed as the product of a term corresponding to projective measurements and one term involving the characteristics of the measurement procedure. In this sense, the information concerning the system and the noise induced by measurements appear mixed in the fluctuation relation for the overlapping case.

The state after the unitary evolution up to time t1 takes the form\n\u03c1\u0302(t1, Ii) = U\u0302(t1, t + 0 )\u03c1\u0302(t + 0 , Ii)U\u0302 \u2020(t1, t + 0 ) , (49)\nwith i \u2208 {1, 2, ov}. In this case it follows that\nS(\u03c1\u0302(t1, Iov)||\u03c1\u0302th(t)) = \u2212S(\u03c1(t1, Iov)) + p1Sre(1) + p2Sre(2) . (50)\nTo shorten the expressions we have introduced the following notation, Sre(i) = S(\u03c1\u0302i(t1)||\u03c1\u0302th(t)) and pi = Z\u22121(t0)e\u2212\u03b2\u00b5i(t0), for i \u2208 {1, 2}.\nHere, following the same steps as in the previous section, it can be concluded that\ne\u03be = 2\n\u03b2\u03c3 sinh(\u03b2\u03c3/2) \u2211 i=1,2 e\u2212Sre(i)\n+ 2\n\u03b2\u03c3\n( sinh (\u03b2 (\u00b52(t0)\u2212 \u00b51(t0))\u2212 \u03b2\u03c3/2)\u2212 sinh(\u03b2\u03c3/2) )( p1e \u2212Sre(1) + p2e \u2212Sre(2) \u2212 e\u2212p1Sre(1)\u2212p2Sre(2) ) . (51)\nIn this expression one can identify the contribution due to the non-overlapping case, and the correction that arises due to uninformative measurement records. In contrast to what happens in the non-overlapping case, it is striking that here the effect of the measuring device is not a global factor that multiplies a term that depends only on the system. In this situation, in which the observer is confronted with measurement outcomes that do not contribute to update her/his state of knowledge about the system, Jarzynski\u2019s equality exhibits a mixture of information concerning the system and that corresponding to the measuring apparatus. The last term in Eq (51) contains the fluctuations of the relative entropies in the regions I1 and I2 and is a correction to fluctuation relation (36). Indeed, the functions Sre(i) are constant within the intervals Ii so we can write\np1e \u2212Sre(1) + p2e \u2212Sre(2) \u2212 e\u2212p1Sre(1)\u2212p2Sre(2) := \u2329 e\u2212Sre \u232a \u2212 e\u2212\u3008Sre\u3009. (52)\n11\nIt is worth analyzing the measurement regime, in which \u03c3 |\u00b52(t0) \u2212 \u00b51(t0)|, the expression for e\u03be factorizes in a term that depends only on the meter characteristics and the temperature, and another term that does not contain any information about the meter. In such regime\ne\u03be \u2248 2 \u03b2\u03c3 sinh(\u03b2\u03c3/2) ( \u2211 i=1,2 e\u2212Sre(i) + 2( \u2329 e\u2212Sre \u232a \u2212 e\u2212\u3008Sre\u3009) ) . (53)\nOn the other hand, in the low temperature regime the probabilities p1 \u2248 1 (p2 \u2248 0), then the quantity (52) approaches to zero and expression (47) is recovered.\nThis result is an illustration of Eq.(16) as incorporates the contribution of non-informative measurements to Jarzynski equality derived in [18]."

            "text": "To numerically simulate the measurement process we have considered the characteristic function (43) and the dynamics of a two level system described by the Hamiltonian\nH(t) = ~\u03c9q \u03c3z 2 + ~\u2126R\u03c3y cos (\u03c9qt+ \u03c8) , (54)\nwith \u03c3\u03b1 (\u03b1 = y, z) the Pauli matrices, \u03c9q the resonant frequency, \u03c8 a phase and \u2126R the Rabi frequency associated with the driving. This system has been implemented in a nice experiment [45] to study individual quantum state trajectories and its properties. Specifically, it has been shown that it is possible to study quantum thermodynamic properties for individual quantum trajectories, and that the results obtained from the master equation approach are consistent with the two-projective-measurement scheme.\nIn the numerical simulations we have considered as initial state the one corresponding to the canonical thermal state of the Hamiltonian H(0), and a measurement process with characteristic function (43). Figure 2 shows the agreement between the numerical results and those obtained from the analytical expressions derived in the previous sections. In particular, the transition between the non-overlapping and overlapping cases can be clearly observed. Note that this transition would be smoother if G(f |0) were a smooth function, such as a Gaussian. In Figure 2, the difference between the blue and orange lines evidences the contribution of the region of overlap, given by the second term of equation (51).\nDue to the initial state chosen in the measurement process, the initial relative entropy, the relative entropy of coherence and the Kullback-Leibler divergence are all zero. However, once the measurement occurs and the subsequent time evolution takes place the system will develop coherences due to the external driving, and will reach the final time with non-zero Kullback-Leibler divergence.\nThe relative entropy of coherence is expected to grow as the Rabi frequency increases. However, for large values of \u03b2\u2126R/\u03c9q the coherences decrease until they decay to zero. In this limit the initial and final thermal states, the post-measurement state and the evolution operator all commute and no coherences develop. At the strict limit of no driving, in which \u2126R/\u03c9q \u2192 0, the increment of the entropy equals the von Neumann entropy of the initial state, see Fig. 3. Additionally, the range of \u03c3 values analyzed is such that small values of \u2126R/\u03c9q correspond to the overlapping case. Therefore, the relative entropy is given by (p1Sre(1) + p2Sre(2))/\u03c3. While in the case of large values of \u03b2\u2126R/\u03c9q the mean increment of the relative entropy behaves as \u2206SR \u2248 \u2206DKL \u2248 2\u03b2~\u2126R cos(\u03c9qtf + \u03c8)."

            "text": "In this work we have analyzed the Jarzynski equality based on a protocol of a single energy measurement proposed in [18] for non-projective measurements. In this scheme the coherences developed in the system during the postmeasurement time evolution play an important role. A comparative study of the resolution of the measurement device with respect to the distance between neighboring energy eigenvalues of the system allows different scenarios to be introduced.\nIf the energy resolution of the meter can resolve the individual elements of the energy spectrum, then the resulting Jarzynski equality is that which would be obtained in projective measurements except for a multiplicative factor that depends on the meter. In this case the resulting signal can be convoluted to extract the one corresponding to the Jarzynski equality. On the other hand, if the meter cannot resolve a part of the energy spectrum, then the effect of the measurement is not a factor that multiplies the Jarzynski relation.\n12\nWe have analyzed a simple model of a two-level system in which, although informative measurements appear due to the bad energy resolution of the meter, in the weak measurement limit it is possible to extract a new Jarzynski equality containing an additional term related to the non-projective measurements used.\nWe have also studied the behavior of coherences in a driven two-level system by means of the relative entropy coherence and the relative entropy change during a single measurement protocol. Numerical results show that the coherences grow with the Rabi frequency until they reach a maximum, and then decay to zero as this frequency becomes larger. Also, the change in the relative entropy of the post-measurement state at final time and the reference thermal state increases linearly with the Rabi frequency.\nTo conclude, we have shown that there are realistic systems in which it is possible to observe the corrections to the Jarzynski equality based on a protocol of a single energy measurement."
