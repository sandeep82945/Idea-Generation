Evaluation of Real-world Data to Inform Economic Evaluations: Future research could focus on utilizing real-world data (RWD) to inform economic evaluations of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in colon cancer. This approach could help bridge the gap between clinical trial populations and the broader, more diverse patient populations seen in routine clinical practice. It would allow for a more accurate estimation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of AC strategies, taking into account real-world adherence, dose adjustments, and patient outcomes.

Long-term Outcomes and Toxicity of AC Strategies: Investigating the long-term outcomes and toxicity profiles of different AC strategies, especially focusing on oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity and the impact of reducing chemotherapy duration from 6 to 3 months. This research could provide deeper insights into the quality of life and long-term health utility values associated with AC, contributing to more nuanced economic evaluations.

Comparative Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Biomarker-driven AC Selection: With preliminary evidence suggesting the cost-effectiveness of biomarker-driven approaches for selecting patients for AC in stage II colon cancer, further research could focus on comparing different biomarker strategies. This would involve robust clinical trials and economic evaluations comparing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various genomic or molecular biomarkers in guiding AC treatment decisions.

Impact of Societal Costs on the Cost-effectiveness of AC: Expanding the perspective of economic evaluations to include societal costs more comprehensively, such as patient and caregiver time off work, travel costs, and long-term care needs. This research could uncover the broader economic implications of AC strategies, providing a more holistic view of their value.

Patient-reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Studies Embedded in Clinical Trials: Future trials on AC strategies could systematically include the collection of patient-reported outcomes and quality of life data. This would enable the generation of contemporary health utility values directly from patients undergoing treatment, facilitating more accurate and relevant economic evaluations. Such studies would also allow for the exploration of the impact of AC on patient and caregiver quality of life, potentially identifying areas for supportive care improvements.
