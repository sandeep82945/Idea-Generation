    "abstractText": "This study investigated the relationships among perceived stress, conflict resolution styles, spousal support and marital satisfaction of heterosexual married couples during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) quarantine. This was a descriptive study that employed a correlational survey model. The sample consisted of 511 Turkish married couples recruited using snowball sampling. Data were collected online using a demographic characteristic questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Conflict Resolution Styles Scale, the Spousal Support Scale, and the Marital Life Scale. The mean age of participants was 37.00 (SD = 7.88) years. The mean duration of marriage of participants was 11.15 (SD = 8.97) years. Higher marital satisfaction was associated with lower perceived stress, lower negative conflict resolution style, higher spousal support, and higher positive resolution styles. The Conflict Resolution Styles Scale and Spousal Support Scale scores explained 48.3% of the total variance of the Marital Life Scale, indicating that higher positive conflict resolution styles and higher spousal support were significantly associated with higher marital satisfaction. The COVID-19 quarantine has resulted in changes in marital life and family dynamics. Stress, negative conflict resolution style, and a lack of spousal support during the COVID19 quarantine contribute to marital dissatisfaction.",

            "text": "The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, the capital of Central China\u2019s Hubei province, at the end of 2019 and has taken hold of the entire world since then (Xiang et\u00a0al., 2020). The virus is transmitted between people through the exchange of respiratory droplets when in close contact with each other, causing pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and death, particularly among elderly\npersons with chronic diseases (CDC, 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020). The COVID-19 disease has become a global health problem and has infected millions of people and caused tens of thousands of deaths. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified it as a pandemic (WHO, 2020), and governments of countries worldwide have taken several measures to prevent its spread (ShakespeareFinch et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). Turkey announced its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 11, 2020, and has taken several preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus. Among these measures are school closure, the transition to distance education, flexibility in working hours (public and private), work shifted to the online space and working from home, and lockdowns (institutions and workplaces). In order to prevent contagion, stay-at-home orders were given for people 20\u00a0years old and younger and those over 65\u00a0years, and curfews for all age groups in certain large cities on weekends were also applied (Karata\u015f, 2020).\nThese measures have drastically changed the daily life of people everywhere. People remained in quarantine, either\n* Rabiye Ak\u0131n I\u015f\u0131k akinrabia35@gmail.com\nYunus Kaya yuunus.kaya@gmail.com\n1 Department of\u00a0Obstetrics and\u00a0Gynecelogic Nursing, Faculty of\u00a0Nursing, Hacettepe University, S\u0131hh\u0131ye Camp\u00fcs, Ankara\u00a006100, Turkey\n2 Faculty of\u00a0Health Sciences, Aksaray University, Child Development Department, Aksaray, Turkey\n1 3\nby their personal decisions or due to the decisions of their governments. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people physically, mentally, and socially (Armstrong et\u00a0al., 2020; Shakespeare-Finch et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). The fear of becoming infected, the increase in the number of positive cases and deaths, social isolation, substantial uncertainties regarding the nature of the disease, and the dynamics of the pandemic have caused stress, anxiety, and psychosomatic conditions in people. Further, the increased uncertainty surrounding the virus, rapid course of the disease, and having loved ones infected or killed by the virus have exacerbated already-existing mental problems. Voluntary or mandatory quarantine deprived people of the social support that would have otherwise helped them cope with stress and anxiety, thereby increasing the severity of depression, anxiety, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorders, and other psychosomatic conditions (Liu et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThe fear of becoming infected, mental strains, stress, anxiety, social isolation, changes in activities of daily living, and financial problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have affected domestic and marital life, often leading to family conflicts, domestic violence, and marital dissatisfaction (Gulati & Kelly, 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020). The closure of workplaces, layoffs, and the ongoing stay-at-home orders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have led to numerous difficulties and disruption in the gender-based roles of married couples at home. Over 89% of Turkish citizens report being Muslim and 74% of them are Sunni. In contemporary Turkish society, females are more concerned with domestic responsibilities and taking care of children, while males take on the responsibility of supporting the household financially. The changes in daily life that have arisen due to the pandemic have affected these responsibilities and gender roles. In many cases, this situation has led to an increase in the stress levels of spouses and their expectations of support from one another (Akba\u015f & Dursun, 2020; \u00dcnal & G\u00fclseren, 2020). Spouses meet each other\u2019s physical, mental, and social needs, such as sex, love, respect, value, and support. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress, anxiety, fear, and social isolation, thereby resulting in marital and domestic problems (Gulati & Kelly, 2020; Karata\u015f, 2020). Spouses who were able to cope with the challenges of the pandemic likely built a stronger bond and began trusting each other more (Prime et\u00a0al., 2020). However, those who were unable to cope with the challenges of not only the pandemic but also the challenges associated with a strained marriage (Abbas et\u00a0al., 2019; Soylu & Ka\u011fn\u0131c\u0131, 2015), thereby exacerbating their mental problems and resulting in domestic violence and divorce. Therefore, this study investigated the relationships among perceived stress, conflict resolution styles, spousal support, and marital satisfaction of married couples during the COVID-19 lockdown. The study proposes the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: The mean scores of the Perceived Stress Scale, Conflict Resolution Styles Scale, Spousal Support Scale, and Marital Life Scale vary according to the demographic characteristics of the participants (such as age, sex, education level, income level, etc.). Hypothesis 2: Higher marital satisfaction is correlated with both lower perceived stress and negative conflict resolution styles. Hypothesis 3: Higher marital satisfaction is correlated with both higher positive conflict resolution styles and spousal support. Hypothesis 4: Perceived stress and negative conflict resolution styles negatively predict marital satisfaction. Hypothesis 5: Positive conflict resolution styles and perceived spousal support positively predict marital satisfaction."

Participants living in cities with curfew ordinances had a higher mean MLS score than those who were not (t = -3.54, p < 0.0001). Participants who do not have children had a higher mean MLS score than those who have children (t = -3.37, p = 0.001). Moderate-income participants had a higher mean MLS score than those with low income (F = 3.63, p = 0.02).\nAge, sex, education level, and having children affected participants\u2019 mean CRSS subscale scores in Table\u00a02. Female participants had a higher mean NCRS score than males (t = -3.70, p < 0.0001). Older participants had a higher mean SCRS score than younger participants (F = 6.13, p < 0.0001). Male participants had a higher mean SCRS score than females (t = 4.08, p < 0.0001). Participants with a primary school degree had a higher mean SCRS score than those with a higher degree (F = 5.44, p < 0.0001). Participants with children had a higher mean Retreat Conflict Resolution Style (RCRS) score than those without (t = 2.15, p = 0.03).\nTable\u00a03 presents the mean scale and subscale scores and the correlations between them. MLS was negatively correlated with PSS and NCRS and positively correlated with spousal support (emotional, instrumental, informational, appraisal, and social support) (p < 0.05). MLS was positively correlated with PCRS and SCRS (p < 0.05). PSS was negatively correlated with SSS and positively correlated with NCRS (p < 0.05). SSS was positively correlated with MLS and PCRS and negatively correlated with PSS and NCRS (p < 0.05).\nTable\u00a0 4 presents the correlation between the scale scores and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTa bl\ne 3\nT he\nre la\ntio ns\nhi p\nbe tw\nee n\nsc al\ne an\nd su\nbs ca\nle (n\n= 51\n1)\nM LS\n: M ar\nita l L\nife S\nca le\n; P SS\n: P er\nce iv\ned S\ntre ss\nS ca\nle ; S\nSS : S\npo us\nal S\nup po\nrt Sc\nal e;\nE S:\nE m\not io\nna l S\nup po\nrt; II\nS: In\nstr um\nen ta\nl a nd\nIn fo\nrm at\nio na\nl S up\npo rt;\nA S:\nA pp\nra is\nal S\nup po\nrt; S\nC : S\noc ia l Su pp or t; PC R S: P os iti ve C on fli ct R es ol ut io n St yl e; N C R S: N eg at iv e C on fli ct R es ol ut io n St yl e; S C R S: S ub or di na tio n C on fli ct R es ol ut io n St yl e; R C R S: R et re at C on fli ct R es ol ut io n St yl e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1- M LS r p 2- P SS r p -0 .1 4 0. 00 3- S SS r p 0. 68 0. 00 -0 .2 0 0. 00 4- E S r p 0. 65 0. 00 -0 .1 7 0. 00 0. 96 0. 00 5- II S r p 0. 62 0. 00 -0 .1 9 0. 00 0. 91 0. 00 0. 83 0. 00 6- A S r p 0. 65 0. 00 -0 .1 9 0. 00 0. 94 0. 00 0. 86 0. 00 0. 79 0. 00 7- SS r p 0. 61 0. 00 -0 .2 0 0. 00 0. 90 0. 00 0. 87 0. 00 0. 78 0. 00 0. 85 0. 00 8- PC R S r p 0. 24 0. 00 0. 09 0. 04 0. 21 0. 00 0. 19 0. 00 0. 19 0. 00 0. 20 0. 00 0. 19 0. 00 9- N C R S r p -0 .1 9 0. 00 0. 21 0. 00 -0 .2 2 0. 00 -0 .1 9 0. 00 -0 .2 2 0. 00 -0 .2 4 0. 00 -0 .2 0 0. 00 -0 .1 5 0. 00 10 - S C R S r p 0. 09 0. 02 0. 08 0. 06 -0 .0 3 0. 46 -0 .0 2 0. 59 -0 .0 3 0. 46 0. 01 0. 76 -0 .0 4 0. 31 0. 12 0. 00 -0 .2 0 0. 00 11 - R C R S r p -0 .0 2 0. 63 0. 00 0. 97 -0 .0 7 0. 10 -0 .0 4 0. 28 -0 .0 9 0. 03 -0 .0 5 0. 24 -0 .0 6 0. 11 -0 .0 0 0. 88 -0 .2 3 0. 00 0. 49 0. 00 M \u00b1 S D 33 .1 0 \u00b1 4. 78 40 .5 0 \u00b1 6. 97 67 .3 0 \u00b1 12 .8 0 22 .7 0 \u00b1 4. 50 17 .8 0 \u00b1 3. 32 19 .5 0 \u00b1 4. 14 7. 10 \u00b1 1. 74 27 .0 0 \u00b1 5. 03 17 .3 0 \u00b1 6. 26 22 .9 0 \u00b1 6. 37 23 .8 0 \u00b1 6. 88\n1 3\nParticipants\u2019 anxiety at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was positively correlated with PSS and NCRS and negatively correlated with social support.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that has caused physical, mental, social, behavioral, and economic problems worldwide. People have been suffering not only from\nhealth-related anxiety but also from stress, uncertainty, depression, and social isolation. These adverse effects have resulted in family conflicts and domestic violence on one hand but have also enhanced support and bonding between couples on the other. This study investigated the relationship among perceived stress, conflict resolution styles, spousal support, and marital satisfaction during the COVID-19 quarantine. It was found that the anxiety levels of married participants had increased due to the emotional, mental, social, and economic difficulties they had experienced as a result of the pandemic; this caused problems in their marital life. It was found that with the increased stress levels of spouses, spousal support and marital satisfaction decreased, and that as spousal support increased, marital satisfaction and positive conflict resolution increased. Further, the regression analysis revealed that positive conflict resolution and spousal support have significant associations with marital satisfaction. The most important finding was that the level of emotional support that spouses gave to each other in a situation of increased stress and anxiety had a more predictive effect on marital satisfaction than the other factors that were studied. The results of the study are discussed in line with the literature.\n1 3\nWe believe that the results of this study will help family experts develop and implement strategies to help couples in times of uncertainty and crisis (Stanley & Markman, 2020). For participants in this study, the challenges of the COVID19 quarantine were emotional and mental stress, having to postpone important plans, financial loss or job loss, and marriage and family problems. The participants had anxiety scores above the normal range at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although their scores decreased upon the launch of controlled normalization in June 2020, they were nevertheless higher than the normal range. Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for people worldwide. People have been experiencing significantly higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during this period and also attempting to deal with deteriorating family relationships due to economic problems and employment concerns since the onset of the pandemic (James Riegler et\u00a0al., 2020; Lebow, 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020).\nFurther, demographic characteristics were linked to participants\u2019 PSS, SSS, and MLS scores. Female participants had a higher mean PSS score, probably because they were more responsible for cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children, and ensuring that their education was not interrupted during the COVID-19 quarantine. Participants living in cities with curfew ordinances had a higher mean PSS score because the stay-at-home orders of 48\u201396\u00a0h\ncontributed to more stress. Low-income participants had a higher mean PSS score as they faced financial problems due to layoffs and lockdowns. Altunta\u015f and Tekeci (2020) found that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to more anxiety in males than in females. However, certain studies report the opposite (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020).\nYounger participants had a higher mean SSS score probably because they were newlyweds. Male participants had a higher mean SSS score than females during the COVID-19 lockdown. In Turkish culture, females are typically responsible for household decisions; the added stress of the lockdown may be linked to lower SSS in females, as the lockdown would have complicated daily stress in the home (e.g., through things like having children at home during the day). Further, participants with a bachelor\u2019s degree had a higher mean SSS score, as education makes people more sensitive to gender equality and equal sharing of household tasks. Participants without children had a higher mean SSS score, probably because they were newlyweds and, therefore, more likely to support each other and empathize with each other. High-income participants had a higher mean SSS score, probably due to increased levels of awareness due to higher education. G\u00fcnsel (2013) found that males and those with children had higher SSS scores, but that spousal support scores increased with age.\nTable 5 The effect of scale scores on marital life scales\nR = 0.70 R2 = 0.492 Adjusted.

Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (2013) also reported a negative correlation between the duration of marriage and marital satisfaction, but \u00c7elik (2006) found no relationship between the two. Male participants had a higher mean MLS score, probably because they did not pull their weight in household chores during the COVID-19 lockdown. Further, a positive correlation was found between education level and marital satisfaction (Kaya, 2017) because people with higher education are likely to cope with stress better, thereby resulting in marital satisfaction (\u00c7elik, 2006). Participants living in cities with curfew ordinances had a higher mean MLS score, probably because they were mostly big cities where couples adopted a more egalitarian approach to the division of household tasks. Participants without children had a higher mean MLS score, probably because they devoted their time and energy to their own needs, while those with children had to deal with their children\u2019s needs and problems, making them less satisfied with their marriage. Twenge et\u00a0al. (2003) also reported that couples with children were less satisfied with their marriage than those without children. Moderate-income participants had a higher mean MLS score, probably because they faced fewer financial problems than people with low income.\nFemale participants had a higher mean NCRS score than males. Although we did not measure this, females may have been more likely to to respond to conflicts with verbal and physical aggression during the COVID-19 lockdown (\u00c7akmak Tolan, 2015) because they felt the toll of juggling between work and family responsibilities, This is a conjecture which needs to be investigated further. Older participants had a higher mean SCRS score, probably because they were more likely to acquiesce to their partners' demands, particularly in times of stress, like social isolation. Male participants had a higher mean SCRS score, thereby suggesting that they might have made compromises instead of remaining headstrong in a discussion or an argument during the COVID-19 lockdown. This is merely a conjecture, and it requires additional study, as do many of our suggested conclusions. Participants with a primary school degree had a higher mean SCRS score probably because they turned to social values and traditions to resolve their marital conflicts. Older participants had a higher mean RCRS score, probably because they tended to respect their partners' opinions and make compromises instead of arguing. Participants with children had a higher mean RCRS score, probably because they avoided arguing in front of their children during the COVID-19 lockdown.\nFurther, marital satisfaction was negatively correlated with perceived stress and negative conflict resolution style and positively correlated with spousal support (emotional, instrumental, informational, appraisal, and social support).\nOn the other hand, marital satisfaction was positively correlated with positive and subordination conflict resolution styles. Spousal support was negatively correlated with perceived stress and negative conflict resolution style. Moreover, economic problems, instability, uncertainty, anxiety, fear, and scarce social support during the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted family life (Cluver et\u00a0al., 2020; Usher et\u00a0al., 2020). Pieh et\u00a0al. (2020) also reported a negative correlation between perceived stress and marital satisfaction and spousal support during the COVID-19 lockdown.\nParticipants with higher levels of anxiety at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the last week of lockdown and those with higher levels of anxiety regarding health, in general, had higher PSS scores. In addition, those with higher anxiety levels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and those generally anxious regarding health had higher NCRS scores. Those with higher anxiety levels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had lower SSS \u201csocial support\u201d subscale scores. People had also experienced increased stress levels during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132004 (Chua et\u00a0al., 2004; Lee et\u00a0al., 2007). Shevlin et\u00a0al. (2020) found that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to more stress in married couples with children. The COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions in daily life caused uncertainty, stress, panic, and fear (Karata\u015f, 2020), exacerbated by news reports regarding the pandemic, economic problems (Cluver et\u00a0al., 2020), the fear of becoming infected and losing loved ones, prolonged physical and social isolation (Ahorsu et\u00a0al., 2020; Brooks et\u00a0al., 2020; de Lima et\u00a0al., 2020), and rapid changes in daily life during the lockdowns and quarantine periods (Cluver et\u00a0al., 2020). Those adverse experiences led to a rise in marital conflict, thereby resulting in couples denying each other the support they needed.\nThe multiple regression analysis revealed that marital satisfaction was significantly affected by positive conflict resolution styles and spousal support. In general, research shows a positive correlation between spousal support and marital satisfaction (\u00c7a\u011f & Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, 2013; Kabasakal & Soylu, 2016; Yedirir & Hamata, 2015). A few studies also report that positive conflict resolution styles predict marital satisfaction (\u00c7akmak Tolan, 2015; Erdem \u00d6zkan, 2019)."

Couples have found themselves navigating new problems brought about by the pandemic and the preventive measures taken by countries to curb its spread. Therefore, experts must enable couples\n1 3\nto develop strategies to cope with stressors and resolve conflicts in times of crisis; couples must be encouraged to support each other and build a strong bond. Such strategies will help families and, thus, the entire society overcome such unforeseen crises. It is recommended that future studies be conducted with larger sample and different cultural groups, as well as qualitative and mixed methods research to evaluate the experiences of the spouses more deeply. At the same time, the impact of the pandemic process on spouses should be evaluated by longitudinal studies. Future studies can also add more and new variables."
