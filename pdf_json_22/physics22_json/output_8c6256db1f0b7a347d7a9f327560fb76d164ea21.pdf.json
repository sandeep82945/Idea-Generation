We employ the large ef fecti ve volume of FLARES to produce a sizeable sample of high-redshift galaxies with intrinsic and observed luminosities and half-light radii in a range of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and visual photometric bands.

Studying galaxy sizes helps us to nderstand the interplay between these key astrophysical processes nd galactic structure. By extension, understanding how galaxy sizes volve tells us how these fundamental physical mechanisms, and the nterplay between them, change o v er time. At fixed redshift, the size\u2013luminosity relation can be expressed as power law of the form = R 0 ( L L z= 3 )\u03b2 , (1)\nhere R 0 is a normalization factor, \u03b2 is the slope of the size\u2013 uminosity relation, and L z= 3 is the characteristic ultraviolet (UV) uminosity for z \u223c 3 Lyman-break galaxies (with value L z= 3 = 0 29 . 03 erg s \u22121 Hz \u22121 ), which corresponds to M 1600 = \u221221.0 (Steidel t al. 1999 ). As a function of redshift the size evolution can be xpressed as\n( z) = R 0 ,z= 0 (1 + z) \u2212m , (2)\nE-mail: w.roper@sussex.ac.uk\nH s r\n2022 The Author(s). ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

In addition to its importance to understanding physical rocesses, probes of the size\u2013luminosity relation and its evolution re indispensable to our understanding of surv e y completeness and by xtension the luminosity function (Kawamata et al. 2018 ; Bouwens t al. 2022 ).\nIn observations at low redshifts ( z < 3), galaxies have sizes of the rder 1\u201330 proper kpc (pkpc), with actively star-forming galaxies ypically larger than their quiescent counterparts (Zhang & Yang 019 ; Kawinwanichakij et al. 2021 ). These galaxies exhibit a positive ize\u2013luminosity relation (van der Wel et al. 2014 ; Suess et al. 2019 ; awinwanichakij et al. 2021 ), although van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) find significant number density of compact and massive ( R < 2 pkpc, /M > 10 11 ) galaxies at z = 1.5\u20133, whose number density drops rastically by the current day. The landscape is different at high redshift where we are primarily robing star-forming galaxies. A number of studies using deep ubble Space Telescope ( HST ) fields have measured the sizes of z = \u201312 Lyman-break galaxies (Oesch et al. 2010 ; Grazian et al. 2012 ; osleh et al. 2012 ; Huang et al. 2013 ; Ono et al. 2013 ; Holwerda t al. 2015 , 2020 ; Kawamata et al. 2015 , 2018 ; Shibuya, Ouchi & arikane 2015 ). In contrast to the low-redshift size regime, these tudies found bright star-forming galaxies with compact half-light adii of 0.5\u20131.0 pkpc.\nis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative h permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nM\nl w e\nr\n0\n0\n[\ne e r \u223c m d ( 2 s l\nr i O L m e fi R o b f\nu t t p s i u r u U b s a o p i\n2 w i m r r e\nU a r o o i I t l\nc < s p h ( l t w r s m e\ns J o p ( i g a a s t l\nd u d w W a 0 m\n2 S\nF z d o t t r p a 0 u c b\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nThere is a growing consensus that the high-redshift size\u2013 uminosity relation is positively sloped ( \u03b2 > 0), as it is at low redshift, ith a range of reported slopes and differing reports of \u03b2\u2019s redshift volution.\n(i) Grazian et al. ( 2012 ) find \u03b2 = 0.3\u20130.5 at z \u223c 7. (ii) Huang et al. ( 2013 ) find \u03b2 = [0.22, 0.25] for z = 4 and z = 5, espectively. (iii) Holwerda et al. ( 2015 ) find \u03b2 = 0.24 \u00b1 0.06 at z \u223c 7 and \u03b2 = .12 \u00b1 0.09 at z \u223c 9\u201310. (iv) Shibuya et al. ( 2015 ) find a redshift-independent slope of \u03b2 = .27 \u00b1 0.01 in the range z = 0\u20138. (v) Kawamata et al. ( 2018 ) find steeply sloped relations with \u03b2 = 0.46, 0.46, 0.38, 0.56] at z = [6, 7, 8, 9], respectively. Recent lensing studies agree with the steeper slope of Kawamata t al. ( 2018 ), itself using a sample including lensed sources. Bouwens t al. ( 2022 ) find \u03b2 = 0.40 \u00b1 0.04 for a galaxy sample in the redshift ange z \u223c 6\u20138, while Yang et al. ( 2022 ) find \u03b2 = 0.48 \u00b1 0.08 for z\n6\u20137 and \u03b2 = 0.68 \u00b1 0.14 for z \u223c 8.5 (assuming the Bradac lens odel; Brada \u030cc et al. 2005 ). This steeper slope is driven by compact\nim galaxies that are better sampled in lensing studies. Neufeld et al. 2021 ) also find extremely compact lensed galaxies with R 1/2 < 00 ppc in the Reionization Lensing Cluster Surv e y (RELICS) data et; they identify these galaxies as potential Lyman continuum (LyC) eakers, possibly representing a large contribution to reionization.\nA similar range of results exists within measurements of the edshift dependence of galaxy size at fixed luminosity with slopes n the range 1 < m < 1.5 (Bouwens et al. 2004 ; Oesch et al. 2010 ; no et al. 2013 ; Kawamata et al. 2015 , 2018 ; Shibuya et al. 2015 ; aporte et al. 2016 ). This is consistent with two theoretical scenarios: = 1, the expected scaling for systems of fixed mass (e.g. Bouwens t al. 2004 ), and m = 1.5, the expected evolution for systems with x ed circular v elocity (e.g. Ferguson et al. 2004 ; Hathi, Malhotra & hoads 2008 ). Ho we ver, galaxy sizes are not wholly dependent n these theoretical scalings with significant contributions from aryonic processes such as stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) eedback (Wyithe & Loeb 2011 ).\nSimulations provide detailed information on the properties of the nderlying components that make up galaxies. From this informaion we can probe large samples of galaxies with knowledge of he intrinsic physical processes go v erning their evolution, albeit rocesses that are themselves dictated by subgrid models that are ensitive to their physical model and parameter assumptions. The ntrinsic properties of particles and their spatial distribution can be tilized to measure galaxy properties such as their half-mass/light adii at the mass resolution of the simulation without the associated ncertainties inherent in measurements of this kind in observations. sing this fidelity, the size\u2013mass and size\u2013luminosity relations have een probed by many simulations. Ho we ver, much of this analysis till focuses on comparatively low redshifts. Furlong et al. ( 2017 ) nalysed the EAGLE simulation and found a good agreement with bserved trends using intrinsic particle measurements to find a ositive ( \u03b2 > 0) size\u2013mass relation that flattens at z = 2, and an ncrease in size with decreasing redshift o v er the range z = 0\u20132.\nAt higher redshift ( z = 6), the SIMBA simulations (Dav \u0301e et al. 019 ) find a positive far-UV attenuated size\u2013luminosity relation hile showing the dust attenuated size is significantly larger than the ntrinsic size, with the magnitude of this increase a function of stellar ass (Wu et al. 2020 ). This implies a flatter intrinsic size\u2013luminosity elation at high redshift. This flattened intrinsic size\u2013luminosity elation is particularly evident in the BLUETIDES simulation (Feng t al. 2016 ; Marshall et al. 2022 ), which has been used to probe the\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nV and visual size\u2013luminosity relations with synthetic observations t z \u2265 7. In doing so they find a negative intrinsic size\u2013luminosity elation ( \u03b2 < 0) in the far-UV that flips to positive after the inclusion f dust attenuation ( \u03b2 > 0). They also probe the redshift evolution f size, finding a shallow redshift evolution of m = 0.662 \u00b1 0.008 n agreement with the redshift evolution of Holwerda et al. ( 2015 ). n addition to the higher redshift results derived from BLUETIDES , he ILLUTRIS-TNG simulations have also exhibited a negative size\u2013 uminosity relation at z = 5 (Popping et al. 2022 ).\nThe FIRE-2 simulations (Ma et al. 2018 ) present a sample of ompact galaxies with sizes of 0.05\u20131 pkpc, in the range \u221222 < M UV \u22127 at z = [6, 8, 10]. The sizes in this sample are measured from ynthetic galaxy images of the intrinsic stellar emission using a nonarametric pixel method, which converts the pixel area containing alf the total luminosity to a half-light radius. Unlike Marshall et al. 2022 ) this sample exhibits a size\u2013mass relation and B -band size\u2013 uminosity relation with \u03b2 > 0. The FIRE-2 galaxy sample extends o galaxies f ar f ainter than those present in other simulated samples, hich could explain the differences in size\u2013mass and size\u2013luminosity elations. They also present redshift evolution slopes derived in fixed tellar mass regimes that produce values of 1 < m < 2, encompassing any of the observational measurements but extending to more xtreme values for the brightest and most massive galaxies. Clearly there is much work to be done in understanding galaxy ize at this epoch, especially with the impending first light of the ames Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) and other next\u2013generation bservatories. In this paper, we analyse the large sample of galaxies roduced by the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations FLARES ) simulations (Lo v ell et al. 2021 ; Vijayan et al. 2021 ). FLARES s uniquely placed to complement previous studies of high-redshift alaxy size due to its enormous ef fecti v e volume, co v erage a wide rray of environments during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), nd sufficient mass resolution, producing a large and robust galaxy ample. In previous work, we have shown that FLARES reproduces he distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and UV uminosity up to z = 10.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 , we etail the simulations themselves. In Section 3 , we detail the methods sed to make synthetic photometry and observations. In Section 4 , we etail the galaxy sample and size measurement methods. In Section 5 , e present the results of this analysis of the size\u2013luminosity relation. e present our conclusions in Section 6 . Throughout this work we ssume a Planck Year 1 cosmology ( 0 = 0.307, = 0 . 693, h = .6777; Planck Collaboration I 2014 ) and a Chabrier stellar initial ass function (IMF; Chabrier 2003 ).\nFIRST L I G H T A N D REI ONI SATI ON E P O C H I MULATI ONS ( FLARES )\nLARES is a simulation program targeting the EoR. It consists of 40 oom simulations, targeting regions with a range of overdensities rawn from an enormous (3.2 comoving Gpc \u2013 cGpc) 3 dark matter nly simulation (Barnes et al. 2017a ), which we will refer to as he \u2018parent\u2019. The regions are selected at z = 4.67, which ensures hat e xtreme o v erdensities are only mildly non-linear, and thus the ank ordering of o v erdensities at higher redshifts is approximately reserv ed. Re gions are defined as spheres with radius 14 cMpc h \u22121 , nd their o v erdensities are selected to span a wide range ( \u03b4 = \u22120.479\u2013 .970; see table A1 of Lo v ell et al. 2021 ) in order to sample the most nder- and o v erdense environments at this cosmic time, the latter ontaining a large sample of the most massive galaxies, thought to be iased to such regions (Chiang, Overzier & Gebhardt 2013 ; Lovell,\nT f e\nm T 3 S k 2 H 2 m ( V f b H T a p w c 2\np b ( f t g\n1 a 1 o\nb t f s w\n2\nW t m a 0 t m s b D\nfi l s o i g\np a o t \u2018 q\ng A d a a a w m t\n3\nW F e d b t s i c W d o o\n3\nI r ( W s l b s\n3\nF m b v p a 2 S\n3\nT w\n1 github.com/stephenmwilkins/SynthObs\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nhomas & Wilkins 2018 ). These regions are then resimulated with ull hydrodynamics using the EAGLE model (Crain et al. 2015 ; Schaye t al. 2015 ).\nThe EAGLE project consists of a series of hydrodynamic cosological simulations, with varying resolutions and box sizes. he code is based on a heavily modified version of P-GADGET, a smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code last described in pringel et al. ( 2005b ). The hydrodynamic solv er is collectiv ely nown as ANARCHY (described in Schaller et al. 2015 ; Schaye et al. 015 ), and adopts the pressure\u2013entropy formulation described by opkins ( 2013 ), an artificial viscosity switch (Cullen & Dehnen 010 ), and an artificial conduction switch (e.g. Price 2008 ). The odel includes prescriptions for radiative cooling and photoheating Wiersma, Schaye & Smith 2009a ), star formation (Schaye & Dalla ecchia 2008 ), stellar evolution and mass loss (Wiersma et al. 2009b ), eedback from star formation (Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2012 ), and lack hole growth and AGN feedback (Springel, Di Matteo & ernquist 2005a ; Booth & Schaye 2009 ; Rosas-Gue v ara et al. 2015 ). he z = 0 galaxy mass function, the mass\u2013size relation for discs, nd the gas mass\u2013halo mass relation were used to calibrate the free arameters of the subgrid model. The model is in good agreement ith a number of observables at low redshift not considered in the alibration (e.g. Furlong et al. 2015 ; Lagos et al. 2015 ; Trayford et al. 015 ).\nFLARES uses the AGNdT9 configuration of the model, which roduces similar mass functions to the fiducial reference model, ut better reproduces the hot gas properties of groups and clusters Barnes et al. 2017b ). It uses a higher value for C visc , a parameter or the ef fecti ve viscosity of the subgrid accretion, and a higher gas emperature increase from AGN feedback, T . These modifications ive less frequent, more energetic AGN outbursts. The FLARES simulations have an identical resolution to the 00 cMpc EAGLE reference simulation box, with a dark matter nd an initial gas particle mass of m dm = 9 . 7 \u00d7 10 6 M and m g = . 8 \u00d7 10 6 M , respectively, and has a gravitational softening length f 2 . 66 ckpc at z \u2265 2.8. In order to obtain a representative sample of the Universe, by comining these regions using appropriate weightings corresponding to heir relativ e o v erdensity, we are able to create composite distribution unctions that represent much larger volumes than those explicitly imulated. For a more detailed description of the simulation and eighting method we refer the reader to Lo v ell et al. ( 2021 ).\n.1 Galaxy extraction\ne follow the same structure extraction method as the EAGLE project: his is explained in detail in McAlpine et al. ( 2016 ). In brief, dark atter o v erdensities are identified using a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) pproach (Davis et al. 1985 ) with the usual linking length of = . 2 \u0304x , where x\u0304 is the mean interparticle separation. All other particle ypes are then assigned to the halo containing their nearest dark\natter neighbour. These FoF haloes are then refined to produced elf-bound \u2018subgroups\u2019 (galaxies) containing both dark matter and aryonic particles using the SUBFIND algorithm (Springel et al. 2001 ; olag et al. 2009 ). The SUBFIND method involves finding saddle points in the density eld in a FoF halo to identify self-bound substructures. This can ead to spurious o v ersplitting of e xtremely dense galaxies where addle points are misidentified near density peaks. These objects ften contain mainly a single particle type and have anomalous nte grated properties. Although the y make up < 0 . 1 per cent of all alaxies > 10 8 M at z = 5, we identify and recombine them into their\narent structure in post-processing. To do this we label a \u2018galaxy\u2019 s spurious if it has any zero mass contributions in the stellar, gas, r dark matter components. We remo v e the spurious galaxies from he SUBFIND catalogue and add their particle properties to the parent central\u2019 subhalo, including the reassigned particles in any integrated uantities. In a minority of pathological cases tidal stripping can cause alaxies to exhibit diffuse populations of particles at large radii. lthough identified by SUBFIND as belonging to a galaxy, these istrib utions can ha v e a large effect on inte grated quantities such s the total luminosity and the half-light radius. For this reason we dopt a 30 pkpc aperture in line with all EAGLE and FLARES papers nd calculate all integrated properties using only particles associated ith each subgroup within this aperture. This aperture ensures the ajority of galaxies have mass distributions that are wholly within his aperture and any erroneous distributions at large radii are omitted.\nM O D E L L I N G PHOTOMETRY\ne use the approach presented in Vijayan et al. ( 2021 , (henceforth LARES II ) to produce resolved galaxy images, both including and xcluding the effects of dust. We first produce spectral energy istributions (SEDs) and then apply top-hat rest-frame UV and visual and filters to extract photometry. As in FLARES II we focus on he stellar emission, deferring the treatment of accretion on to the upermassive black holes to a future work. However, as will be shown n the coming sections this simplification does not pose a significant hallenge to the results of this work. This approach broadly follows ilkins et al. ( 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , 2020 ), with modifications to the ust treatment. For a full description of this method and discussion f the free parameters see FLARES II. What follows is a brief summary f the approach to compute galaxy images.\n.1 Spectral energy distribution modelling\nn this work, we use the SYNTHOBS module 1 to produce synthetic est-frame photometry primarily focusing on a top-hat far-UV 1500 \u00c5) filter with a wavelength range of 1300 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1700 \u00c5.\ne do ho we ver calculate results for a range of different filters all hown in the example SED in Fig. 1 . Each component of the stellar uminosity can be included independently enabling the probing of oth the intrinsic luminosity and the effects of dust extinction. In this ection, we briefly detail each component.\n.1.1 Stellar emission\nor the pure stellar emission we start with a simple stellar population odel (SSP) by associating each stellar particle with a stellar SED ased on the particle\u2019s age and metallicity. As with FLARES II we use 2.2.1 of the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis ( BPASS ) stellar opulation synthesis (SPS) models (Stanway & Eldridge 2018 ) and ssume a Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF. As shown in Wilkins et al. ( 2016 , 017 , 2018 ) the resulting luminosities are sensitive to the choice of PS and IMF used in their deri v ation.\n.1.2 Nebular emission\no account for the LyC emission of young stellar populations e associate young stellar particles ( t < 10 Myr, following the\nMNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nM\nFigure 1.

To include he LyC emission for each stellar particle we follow the approach etailed in Wilkins et al. ( 2020 ), in which the pure stellar spectrum s processed with the CLOUDY photoionization code (Ferland et al. 017 ) assuming: (i) the H II region\u2019s metallicity is identical to the stellar particle\u2019s; (ii) dust depletion and relative abundances from Gutkin, Charlot & ruzual ( 2016 ); (iii) a reference ionization parameter (defined at t = 1 Myr and = 0.02) of log 10 ( U S, ref ) = \u22122; (iv) a hydrogen density of log 10 ( n H /cm \u22123 ) = 2.5; (v) CLOUDY \u2019s default Orion-type graphite and silicate grains. .1.3 Dust attenuation o include the effects of dust attenuation from the interstellar medium ISM) we adopt a line-of-sight (LoS) attenuation model. In this odel we treat stellar particles as emitters along an LoS (in this aper, we select the z -axis of the simulation) and account for the ttenuation due to gas particles that intersect this LoS. Using an oS approach means stellar emission undergoes spatially resolved ttenuation rather than the uniform attenuation of a simple screen odel, enabling considerably more robust photometry. To do this we find all gas particle SPH kernels that intersect the tellar particle\u2019s LoS and integrate along it to get the metal column ensity, ( x , y ). We then link this metal column density to the ISM ust optical depth in the V band (550 nm), \u03c4 ISM ( x , y ), with a similar\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\npproach as in Wilkins et al. ( 2017 ). This gives the expression\nISM ,V ( x , y ) = DTM \u03baISM ( x , y ) , (3) here DTM is the galaxy specific dust-to-metal ratio from the fitting unction presented in Vijayan et al. ( 2019 ). This is a function of he mass-weighted stellar age ( t ) and the gas-phase metallicity of a alaxy ( Z ),\nTM = D 0 + ( D 1 \u2212 D 0 ) [ 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03b1Z \u03b2 ( t/\u03c4 ) \u03b3 )] , (4)\nhere D 0 and D 1 represent the initial Type II supernovae (SNe) dust njection and saturation, respectively, and \u03c4 is an estimate of the nitial dust growth time-scale after dust injection from Type II SNe ut prior to the initiation of dust growth on grains. 2 The normalization actor \u03ba ISM w as chosen to match the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity unction (UVLF) from Bouwens et al. ( 2015 ) and acts as a proxy for ust properties such as average grain size, shape, and composition \u03ba ISM = 0.0795). The FLARES simulations do not inherently model ust production and destruction, thus we have to resort to these datariven proxies. In addition to attenuation due to the ISM, young stellar populations t < 10 Myr) are still embedded in their birth clouds and thus need o take into account attenuation due to this cloud. For these young tellar particles we include the additional attenuation expression:\nBC ,V ( x , y ) = \u03baBC ( Z/ 0 . 01) , (5) here Z is the metallicity of the young stellar particle and \u03baBC is nother normalization factor encapsulating the dust properties of the irth cloud, for this we assume a constant value of \u03baBC = 1. For tellar particles older than 10 Myr, \u03c4BC, V ( x , y ) = 0 and there is no ontribution. In Appendix D , we present sizes omitting this birth loud contribution to quantify its effect on galaxy size.\nWe then combine these optical depths in the V band,\n\u03bb = ( \u03c4BC ,V + \u03c4ISM ,V ) ( \u03bb\n550 nm\n)\u22121 , (6)\nielding an expression for the optical depth at other wavelengths hat can be applied to the stellar particle SEDs to account for dust ttenuation.\n.2 Image creation\ne then apply top-hat photometric band filters to the SEDs producing hotometry for each stellar particle. Using this photometry we roduce synthetic observations with a field of view (FoV) of 60\n60 pkpc 2 encompassing the entire 30 pkpc aperture in which a alaxy\u2019s integrated quantities are measured (corresponding to 9.34, 2.20, and 14.13 arcsec at z = 5, 8, and 10, respectively); see ection 2.1 . We adopt a resolution equal to the redshift-dependent oftening length of the simulation ( s = 2.66/(1 + z) pkpc). In ppendix C , we present a comparison of image resolutions. Synthetic images are often created by treating each stellar particle s a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel. The standard deviation of this ernel can either be defined by the softening length ( \u03c3 = s , producing inimal smoothing), the stellar particle\u2019s smoothing length ( \u03c3 = sml , accounting for the local density), or, most often, the proximity o the N th neighbouring stellar particle ( \u03c3 = r N ) (e.g. Torrey et al. 015 ; Ma et al. 2018 ; Marshall et al. 2022 ).

In this method an image ( I ) can herefore be expressed mathematically as i = exp (\n\u2212 ( X \u2212 x i ) 2 + ( Y \u2212 y i ) 2 2 \u03c3 2 i\n) , (7)\n= N \u2211 i= 0 I i L i \u2211 pix I i , (8)\nhere I i is the smoothed image (kernel) produced for the i th stellar article, \u03c3 i is the standard deviation of the i th stellar particle\u2019s kernel, and Y are a grid of pixel positions, x i and y i are the i th stellar article\u2019s x -axis and y -axis positions in the desired projection, L i is he luminosity of the i th particle, and the sum in the denominator is a um o v er all pix els for the i th stellar particle to normalize the kernel.\nHo we ver, this approach not only differs from the SPH treatment of stellar particle but is also extremely computationally e xpensiv e. Uness artificially truncated a Gaussian kernel encompasses the whole mage, leading to insignificant but time-consuming calculations. In act, in SPH simulations a stellar particle is treated as a representation f a fluid with the full extent of the stellar population described by spline kernel with a definitive cut-off where the kernel falls to 0 Borrow et al. 2022 ). Using a spline kernel-based approach is not nly a better representation of the underlying simulation\u2019s treatment f stellar particles but also greatly reduces the size of the computation y limiting the number of pixels computed per stellar particle. For these reasons we implement a method of smoothing employing he SPH kernel used in the simulation to describe a stellar particle\u2019s extent\u2019. In the ANARCHY SPH scheme, used in the EAGLE model Schaye et al. 2015 ), this kernel is the C 2 Wendland kernel (Wendland 995 ; Dehnen & Aly 2012 ). We therefore adopt this kernel in this ork, but note that for other simulations the kernel corresponding to hat particular simulation should be used to maximize the fidelity of his method.\nAs with the Gaussian approach, an image can be described as a um o v er k ernels; unlik e the Gaussian approach ho we ver, the spline ernels are necessarily three-dimensional and need projecting into he x \u2013y plane. To achieve this we calculate the spline kernels on a oxel grid and sum over the z-axis,\n= \u2211 z -axis N \u2211 i= 0 K i \u2211 vox K i L i , (9)\nhere each stellar particle\u2019s kernel ( K i ) is now\ni = 21 2 \u03c0 w i h 3 sml , (10)\nith the kernel w i given by i ( q i = r/h i ) = {\n( 1 \u2212 q i ) 4 ( 1 + 4 q i ) , q i \u2264 1 , 0 , q i > 1 ,\n(11)\nhere r is the distance between the particle and any given voxel ithin the kernel. To compute this kernel efficiently we employ a KD-Tree algorithm,\nuilding a tree based on voxel coordinates. We query the tree for ll non-zero pixels where the distance between the pixel and the tellar particle ( r ) is less than the limits of the smoothing kernel here r < h ), greatly reducing the computation from O ( N N pix ) in he Gaussian case to O ( N N vox( r < h ) ) using the more representative pline approach.\nIn Fig. 2 , we present a grid of randomly selected galaxy images in he far-UV filter along with their stellar mass (derived by summing he underlying particle distribution), luminosities, central surface ensities, and half-light radii measured including the effects of dust.\nt should be noted that throughout this analysis we do not rotate alaxies, instead adopting their existing orientation in the box to mulate the stochastic viewing angles of galaxies in the real Universe. enceforth, all analysis derived from images will use this method f stellar particle smoothing (implemented from Section 4.2.2 nwards), unless explicitly stated otherwise. In Appendix A , we resent comparisons between the Gaussian and spline approach for his simulation.\nG A L A X Y SELECTI ON A N D SIZE EASUREMENT\nn this section, we describe our galaxy sample, and describe the two easurement methods used to derive sizes.\n.1 Extracting the galaxy sample\no ensure all galaxies in the sample have enough particles to be onsidered morphologically resolved, we omit all subgroups with ewer than 100 stellar particles ( N < 100). We apply a 95 per cent ompleteness criterion, dividing the sample of galaxies into those bo v e and below the completeness limits in mass and luminosity. hese completeness limits are given by the mass and luminosity t which the galaxy sample is missing 5 per cent due to galaxies aving N < 100. We adopt 95 per cent complete rather than 00 per cent complete to a v oid the luminosity threshold being defined y anomalously bright galaxies with N < 100. These limits are resented in Table 1 at each redshift for the far-UV band. This ensures e present results moti v ated by a complete galaxy sample. We none he less present the incomplete sample at low opacity in all scatter lots for context. We further distinguish between two morphological populations y applying a threshold derived from the intrinsic size\u2013luminosity elation of S \u2265 10 29 erg s \u22121 Hz \u22121 pkpc \u22122 to their central surface flux ensity (i.e. the surface flux density within the half-light radius). This hreshold splits the sample into a population of centrally compact alaxies and a population of diffuse galaxies; in subsequent plots e will denote the compact population by coloured hexbins and the iffuse population by greyscale hexbins. This division of the galaxy sample is shown in the mass\u2013 uminosity relation in Fig. 3 at z = 5; here we have adopted the reviously described colouring and have used opacity to distinguish he complete and incomplete populations. The dashed lines denote he completeness limits in mass and luminosity. The histograms on he axes show the galaxy distribution along each axis with the full alaxy population in grey and galaxies with N \u2265 100 shown in black.\nAll following plots will follow these plotting conventions, with reyscale colours denoting the diffuse galaxy distribution and oloured hexbins denoting the compact population (as defined by heir central surface density). The he xbins themselv es indicate the eighted number density of galaxies, using the weights derived in o v ell et al. ( 2021 ). All fits are performed on the complete sample. his division of the galaxy sample leads to:\n(i) 50 238 galaxies in the sample with more than 100 stellar articles (25 556, 2863, and 492 at z = 5, 8, and 10, respectively); (ii) 7172 in the compact population with more than 100 stellar articles (2701, 696, and 240 at z = 5, 8, and 10, respectively); (iii) 43 066 in the diffuse population with more than 100 stellar articles (22 855, 2167, and 252 at z = 5, 8, and 10, respectively); (iv) 31 697 galaxies in total abo v e the completeness limit (16 238, 700, and 273 at z = 5, 8, and 10, respectively).\nMNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nM\nFigure 2.

The pixel values of these images are linearly normalized across all panels with their mass, luminosity, central surface density, and half-light radius included in each panel. The galaxies included in this subset were randomly selected from each mass and central surface density bin, even so they display the variety of morphologies already present by z = 5 in FLARES .\n4\nT p 1 2 s t\nc o p 2\nr n B t\n4\nW a i m c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n.2 Size measurement methods\nhere are a myriad of methods used to define the sizes of galaxies resent in the literature including S \u0301ersic profile fitting (S \u0301ersic 1963 , 968 ), curves of growth (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2004 ; Ferguson et al. 004 ; Oesch et al. 2010 ), Petrosian radius (Petrosian 1976 ), and imulation specific methods that use the particle distribution to find he radius enclosing a percentage of the total mass/luminosity.\nEach measurement method introduces its own dependencies and hallenges. In this section, we detail and compare the two methds utilized in this analysis: a particle-based method, and a nonarametric pixel-based method (e.g. Ribeiro et al. 2016 ; Ma et al. 018 ; Marshall et al. 2022 ). We ne glect curv es of growth, Petrosian\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nadius, and S \u0301ersic profiles entirely; at these redshifts the clumpy ature of galaxies, particularly at lower masses (Jiang et al. 2013 ; owler et al. 2017 ), makes these methods unreliable. Throughout his work we use R to refer to the half-light radius (size) of a galaxy.\n.2.1 Particle-based method\ne take the underlying particle distribution within a 30 pkpc aperture nd find the radius of the particle bounding half the total luminosity nside this aperture. We then interpolate around this initial measureent to better sample the radial density profile, mitigating its disretization into individual, comparatively low resolution, particles.\nc c d o n l g\nt a\n4\nI o p r a m w i R r l\ni d\nd T k l\n4\nI g g t s l e a s a\nn r p i T ( l\n5\nH p t s a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nIt should be noted that this measurement method is sensitive to the hosen galactic centre; in this work we use the centre of potential alculated by SUBFIND . Other choices, such as the centroid, can give ifferent results for diffuse and irregular structures since the centre f potential may be located within one of the clumps, which may not ecessarily lie in the centre of the galaxy. This offset centre leads to arger size measurements, as the majority of the stellar material of the alaxy is offset from the centre from which the radius is measured. In all plots including this measurement we take the luminosity o be the sum of each individual particle\u2019s luminosity within the perture, neglecting any smoothing over the SPH kernel. .2.2 Pixel-based method n the non-parametric pixel approach, the pixels of the image are rdered from most luminous to least luminous. We then find the ixel area containing half the total luminosity before converting to a adius assuming a circular area, R = \u221a A/ \u03c0, and then interpolating round this radius as in the particle method. Unlike the particle ethod this method of measurement has a minimum possible size here half the total luminosity falls within a single pixel, resulting n a radius of R min = \u221a A pix / \u03c0 before interpolation between 0 and min . The interpolation here allows for the measurement of half-light adii smaller than a single pixel, ho we ver this does not remo v e the imitation caused by the finite pixel resolution. This method is particularly robust at high redshifts, where the ndependence from a centre definition and non-contiguous size efinition better encapsulate the morphology of clumpy structures. In all plots using this measurement we present the luminosities as etected from the image, i.e. the sum of all pixels within the FoV. his can subtly differ from the particle luminosities where a particle\u2019s ernel extends beyond the bounds of the FoV, spreading the particles ight outside the image in contrast to the particle-based method. .2.3 Comparing particle and pixel methods\nn Fig. 4 , we present a comparison of these methods for the sizes of all alaxies at z = 5 using their intrinsic luminosities. For the compact alaxies (colour) we see a reasonable correspondence between the wo methods with a scatter around the 1:1 relation. Ho we ver, as the ize of a galaxy increases the particle method begins to produce arger sizes than the pixel method due to a combination of centring ffects and luminous structures within the outskirts of galaxies, such s those shown in a number of panels in Fig. 2 . Conversely, for the mallest galaxies, the pixel size is larger than the particle size; this is manifestation of the stellar particle smoothing used in the creation\nFor the diffuse (greyscale) population the scatter is more proounced and extends towards larger particle values across the full ange of sizes. This is because of the aforementioned strength of the ixel method when it comes to clumpy diffuse structures and the ssue of defining a centre for these structures in the particle method. he size floor is also evident in the smallest galaxies in the diffuse and incomplete) sample where a single pixel contains half the total uminosity of the dim galaxy.\nSI ZE\u2013 LUMI NOSI TY R E L AT I O N S\nere we present results for the sizes of galaxies in the EoR.

Fig. 5 shows this relation at z = 5 for the article measurements. This shows two surprising features: two istinct populations, and a clear ne gativ e slope to the intrinsic size\u2013 uminosity relation.\nAlthough the ne gativ e slope of the intrinsic size\u2013luminosity relaion is somewhat counter-intuitive, it has been seen at these redshifts n other recent simulations, particularly in BLUETIDES (Marshall et al. 022 ) with a ne gativ e size\u2013mass relation at z = 7 and ILLUTRIS-TNG Popping et al. 2022 ) with a ne gativ e observ ed-frame 850 \u03bcm size\u2013 ass relation at z = 5. Indeed, there are also hints in observations ith evidence for a constant dependence between galaxy size and ass (Lang et al. 2014 ; Mosleh et al. 2020 ). Here the division in central surface density is particularly evident. n terms of luminosity we have one dim ( L 10 29 erg s \u22121 Hz \u22121 ) and ore diffuse population, and one bright ( L 10 29 erg s \u22121 Hz \u22121 ) and ompact ( R 1/2 1 pkpc) population.\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nAs shown in Furlong et al. ( 2017 ), the EAGLE low-redshift intrinsic ize\u2013mass relation, a good tracer for the intrinsic size\u2013luminosity elation, is positively sloped with a good agreement with observaional results. Below we briefly outline the physical mechanisms n FLARES and the EAGLE model that cause the bimodality and e gativ e intrinsic size\u2013luminosity relation at high redshift, and how he y evolv e leading to the results in the low-redshift regime. We will resent our investigation into the physical mechanisms go v erning the ause and evolution of the two populations in detail in an upcoming aper.\n(i) At z 5, galaxies that reach M /M 10 9 develop extremely ense cores and begin a spike in core star formation at high stellar irth densities. (ii) This begins to seed the gas in the galaxy\u2019s core with metals, ncreasing the ef fecti veness of metal line cooling, inhibiting stellar nd AGN feedback, and further driving star formation.\n(iii) This o v ercooling causes a feedback loop of star formation n the galaxy\u2019s core, allowing the galaxy to become massive and ltracompact during this early epoch. (iv) While this process takes place in the galaxy\u2019s core the galaxy ccretes an extended gas distribution up to 100 times larger than the tellar distribution. Because of the high densities in the core, stellar eedback is unable to mix the core\u2019s metals into this surrounding as distribution. This lack of metals inhibits cooling and leaves the xtended gas distribution unable to efficiently form stars.\n(v) At z 4 the extended gas distribution reaches the density and etallicity necessary for efficient star formation. This is facilitated\nartly by their own collapse and partly due to the growing efficiency f stellar and AGN feedback (Crain et al. 2015 ), mixing metals rom the core into the surroundings. This extended star formation anifests as an increase in intrinsic galaxy size at late times, yielding positively sloped intrinsic size\u2013luminosity relation.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 6 , we present a stack of the central ntrinsic emission of all galaxies at z = 5 in FLARES (irrespective of ompleteness) split into mass bins of log 10 ( M /M ) = [8\u20139, 9\u20139.5,\n9 i a l m t c t t r p o i m l\ns s\nc e t r r t\n5\nW d r s\nFigure 7. A comparison of the mass dependence of intrinsic half-light radii and exponential profile scale length. Similarly to the profiles in Fig. 6 , the exponential profiles are fit to stacked images of the intrinsic emission in mass bins of M = 10 0.4 M and are denoted by blue squares. The intrinsic half-light radii are derived from the distribution in Fig. 5 and denoted by black points. The error bars are derived from the fit and the standard error in each mass bin for the exponential profiles and the half-light radii, respectively.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n.5\u201310, > 10]. This qualitati vely sho ws ho w the negati ve gradient n the size\u2013luminosity relation translates to the compactification of galaxy\u2019s intrinsic emission in relation to a galaxy\u2019s mass. In the ower panel of Fig. 6 , we plot one-dimensional profiles of the stacked ass bin images to explicitly show the compactification. As with he stacked images, the profiles exhibit a narrowing and increasing entral concentration with increasing mass. The o v ercooling be gins o take effect between the leftmost mass bin (10 8 < M /M < 10 9 ) and he next mass bin of 10 9 < M /M < 10 9.5 . At this crosso v er between egimes there is a narrowing of the profile and stronger concentrated eak, which becomes more peaked as the mass increases. The growth f this central peak then drops off in the final mass bin due to an ncreased contribution by the wings of the profile; galaxies in this ass bin exist in the most dense environments and thus include more uminous substructure at large radii. In Fig. 7 , we show the mass dependence of the half-light radii hown in Fig. 5 and exponential fits to profiles derived from intrinsic tacked images, such as those shown in Fig. 6 , split into mass bins of M = 10 0.4 M . Stacking the images mitigates the issue raised by\nlumpy structures at high redshift, as detailed in Section 4.2 , enabling xponential profile fitting. The scale lengths follow the same negative rend as the intrinsic half-light radii with smaller sizes at low masses elative to the half-light radii. The exponential profiles fit the central egions of the stacks well but fail to fit the profile in the wings, hence he smaller scale lengths for the most diffuse galaxies.\n.2 The effects of dust\ne now mo v e on from the intrinsic size\u2013luminosity relation to iscuss the effects of dust on the observed UV size\u2013luminosity elation.

We have confirmed the AGN contribution is heavily attenuated at these wavelengths, in fact only a handful of galaxies in the sample have AGN that are comparable to their host galaxy in the UV luminosity. 4 Those galaxies in the diffuse population that do not follow this trend (i.e. exhibit large increases in size with the inclusion of dust and have compact dust distributions) are galaxies very close to the central surface flux density threshold used to split the populations.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n.2.1 The distribution of dust ust attenuates the intrinsic stellar emission making observations f the pure stellar emission impossible. The affect this obfuscation ill have on the measured size of a galaxy is sensitive to the spatial istribution of dust in a galaxy: a uniform screen would have no iscernible effect on the size, whereas any concentration of dust in particular region will have important consequences for the spatial istribution of observed stellar emission, and therefore perceived ize. We probe the underlying dust distribution in these galaxies by alculating the half-dust radius (i.e. the radius enclosing half the ass in gas-phase dust). To calculate the gas-phase dust mass we se the metallicity of each gas particle and multiply by the galaxy pecific DTM (described in Section 3.1.3 ) to get the dust mass of ach gas particle.\nFig. 8 shows the ratio between attenuated and intrinsic particleased sizes as a function of this half-dust radius at z = 5. Galaxies n the compact population (coloured hexbins) have dust distributions ith R 1/2, dust 1 pkpc and R att / R int 1. This indicates that, in he compact galaxy sample, not only is the distribution of dust ighly concentrated in the core of the galaxy, but also the more\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\noncentrated the dust, the larger the increase in observed size due to he attenuation of the galaxy\u2019s bright core. 3 With the central regions trongly attenuated, the more e xtended re gions are able to contribute ore to the total luminosity of the galaxy, increasing the perceived ize. In the most extreme cases, galaxies can appear \u223c50 times larger hen including dust attenuation. There are hints of this behaviour n observations at high redshift ( z \u223c 7) with Bowler et al. ( 2022 ) emonstrating that between 35 and 75 per cent of a galaxy\u2019s SFR is bscured by dust and is often highly compact, pinpointing the most tar-forming regions in a galaxy.\nThe vast majority of the diffuse galaxy population (greyscale) lso have diffuse dust distributions ( R 1/2, dust > 1 pkpc) and exhibit a ore conserv ati ve increase in size between intrinsic and attenuated ize. Compared to the compact population, the more diffuse dust istributions (and galaxies) have a flatter relation between the ratio f sizes and half-dust radius. Both the smaller increase in size and he flattening of this relation can be explained by a more uniform istribution of dust in these diffuse clumpy structures. 4\nGalaxies that fall below the dashed line, indicating a ratio of 1, epresent a decrease in size with the inclusion of dust effects. These re instances where the dust is more uniformly distributed, and results n greater attenuation of their extremities, driving down the apparent ize.\n.2.2 The observed UV size\u2013luminosity distribution\nhe ne gativ e gradient in the intrinsic size\u2013luminosity relation preented in Fig. 5 is in direct conflict with observational results that ecessarily include the effects of dust attenuation (e.g. Hathi et al. 008 ; Grazian et al. 2011 , 2012 ; Kawamata et al. 2015 , 2018 ; hibuya et al. 2015 ; Calvi et al. 2016 ; Morishita et al. 2018 ; Bridge t al. 2019 ; Bouwens et al. 2022 ; Yang et al. 2022 ). Ho we ver, in ection 5.2.1 , we have shown that the inclusion of dust attenuation an result in large increases in size for the most intrinsically compact alaxies. Ascertaining if this effect is enough to yield sizes in line ith observations is imperative to probe the validity of the ne gativ e ntrinsic size\u2013luminosity relation, and thus the physical models used n FLARES .\nTo compare to the observed results we use the method detailed in ection 3.2 for synthetic image creation and the pixel measurement ethod (Section 4.2.2 ) to produce the observed size\u2013luminosity\nelation and compare to a wide array of observations in integer edshift bins from z = 5 to 9. This observed size\u2013luminosity relation s shown in Fig. 9 .\nEvidently, the concentration of dust in compact cores and increase n size between intrinsic and attenuated sizes, detailed in Secion 5.2.1 , has completely reversed the slope of the size\u2013luminosity elation relative to the intrinsic relation.\nFocusing on the high central surface density distribution (coloured e xbins), be yond the positive relation between size and luminosity, e can already see a power-law relation with minimal scatter.

We can also ee that the FLARES galaxy sample extends to larger sizes and higher uminosities than the observed results, this is because of FLARES \u2019s ocus on rare and extreme environments where the most luminous alaxies reside. There is a fair agreement between the scatter of observational easurements and the FLARES distribution with the exception of alaxies in the Kawamata et al. ( 2018 ) (lensed) sample that have izes smaller than the resolution of FLARES . Particularly evident when omparing the FLARES and observational scatter are the Grazian et al. 2011 ) and Hathi et al. ( 2008 ) (dropout selected) points at z = 7 nd 6, respectively, with similar normalization to the low central urface density galaxies that scatter further from the power-law elation evident in the compact population. This could be tantalizing bserv ational e vidence for the galaxies that populate the diffuse opulation. To quantify the agreement between the observational scatter and he FLARES sample we use CURVE FIT (non-linear least-squares tting), from SCIPY (Virtanen et al. 2020 ), to produce fits of the orm of equation ( 1 ). The results of this fitting are shown in Table 2 .\nFig. 10 shows a comparison of these fits (solid red lines) to fits rom observed samples: Huang et al. ( 2013 ) at z = 5; Holwerda t al. ( 2015 ) at z = 7 and 9; Kawamata et al. ( 2018 ) at z = 6\u20139; ouwens et al. ( 2022 ) at z = 6\u20138; and Yang et al. ( 2022 ) at z = 6\u20137, he latter three of these including lensed sources. We also compare\no two simulations: the MERAXES semi-analytic model (SAM; Liu t al. 2016 ; Marshall et al. 2019 ) at z = 5\u20139; and the BLUETIDES imulation (Marshall et al. 2022 ) at z = 7\u20139. We denote observations y dashed lines and simulations (other than FLARES ) by dotted lines. ach fit is plotted using their published fitting parameters. At z > 7 the FLARES fits exhibit a good agreement in slope with he observational studies including lensed samples. These fits are ignificantly steeper than the observational samples that do not have contribution of lensed galaxies, as demonstrated in Bouwens et al. 2022 ). At z \u2264 7 the FLARES fits begin to flatten relative to the tudies including lensed sources as galaxies in the dim and diffuse ize\u2013luminosity regime become more numerous.\nCompared to BLUETIDES , we find FLARES has a steeper size\u2013 uminosity relation at z = 8\u20139 and a stronger redshift evolution in\nMNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nM\nFigure 10. Fits to the UV size\u2013luminosity relation including the effects of dust measured using the pixel method. To perform the fits we use the entire complete galaxy sample. We include comparisons to observations without lensed galaxies (Huang et al. 2013 ; Holwerda et al. 2015 ), observations including lensed sources (Kawamata et al. 2018 ; Bouwens et al. 2022 ; Yang et al. 2022 ), and simulations (Marshall et al. 2019 , 2022 ).

With respect o MERAXES we find a good agreement in slopes at z < 9 with a onsistently higher normalization at all redshifts. Each work predicts a different normalization of the size\u2013 uminosity relation. This is particularly evident at z < 8 where LARES has consistently higher normalization than all other studies. ne explanation for this difference is the resolution and measurement ethods in each study. The pixel method used in this work is sensitive o the resolution of the image (for which we adopt the softening ength of the simulation), observational studies on the other hand use mages with a higher resolution than the softening length of FLARES nd use an array of measurement techniques that are less sensitive to he pixel resolution. BLUETIDES uses the pixel method but adopts a igher pixel resolution below the softening length of the simulation, nd MERAXES derive their sizes (scale radius of the disc) from the AM galaxy properties. In addition to methodological differences, here is likely a significant contribution to the normalization by the iffuse galaxies, which at fixed luminosity extend to larger sizes in he FLARES sample. The slopes reported in Table 2 for the attenuated size\u2013luminosity elation are in broad agreement with the results of Grazian et al. 2012 ), Huang et al. ( 2013 ), Holwerda et al. ( 2015 ), Shibuya et al. 2015 ), Kawamata et al. ( 2018 ), Bouwens et al. ( 2022 ), and Yang t al. ( 2022 ) in v arious dif ferent redshift regimes. At z > 7 the FLARES esults exhibit the steeper slopes present in Kawamata et al. ( 2018 ), ouwens et al. ( 2022 ), and Yang et al. ( 2022 ) before flattening into loser agreement with Grazian et al. ( 2012 ), Huang et al. ( 2013 ), olwerda et al. ( 2015 ), and Shibuya et al. ( 2015 ) at z \u2264 7. Again, his is due to the aforementioned compact low-luminosity galaxies resent in the lensed samples, which are absent from the other studies, nd the diffuse low-luminosity galaxies in the FLARES sample that ecome more numerous with decreasing redshift. Many of the compact galaxies that strongly affect the slope\nf the size\u2013luminosity relation in lensing studies fall below the esolution limit of FLARES (indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 9 ) and LUETIDES . Higher resolution simulations are necessary to ascertain f these galaxies are present in the simulated sample and produce he same steepening behaviour. All observational samples also lack he most diffuse galaxies in the simulated samples due to their low urface densities. These would act to flatten the size\u2013luminosity elation if present. Future works will aim to address both these issues ith higher resolution simulations and fully synthetic observations ncluding surv e y limits, instrument noise, point spread functions, and\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nbservational methods of structure detection; the former addressing he missing dim and compact galaxies in the simulated sample and he latter addressing the diffuse galaxies that are likely undetected in he observational sample.\n.3 The size\u2013luminosity relation as a function of wavelength\nn Fig. 11 , we present the size\u2013luminosity relation across a range of est-frame filters (shown in Fig. 1 ), and compare to the corresponding ts from Marshall et al. ( 2022 ) at z = [8, 7]. We present the fitting arameters in Appendix B . As the probed wavelength regime reddens, the slope of the size\u2013 uminosity relation decreases, becoming increasingly ne gativ e for he reddest filters. These red filters probe the underlying stellar istribution with the least attenuation. The increasing representation f the underlying intrinsic distribution is clearly shown in the bottom ow of panels as the slope of the ratio between attenuated and intrinsic ize flattens with increasing wavelength. The slope of the size\u2013 uminosity relation for the reddest filters increases with decreasing edshift, implying that the intrinsic stellar population is becoming ore diffuse as galaxies evolve. This variation with wavelength is also predicted by BLUETIDES Marshall et al. 2022 ) at z = [7, 8], although they predict a shallower ize\u2013luminosity relation for the reddest filters relative to those roduced in this work. It is also consistent with observations at ow redshift (e.g. La Barbera et al. 2010 ; Kelvin et al. 2012 ; Vulcani t al. 2014 ; Kennedy et al. 2015 ; Tacchella et al. 2015 ).\nNone the less, these results present a tantalizing prediction that will llow the JWST to ascertain the validity of the ne gativ e intrinsic size\u2013 uminosity relation. The JWST \u2019s reddest broad-band Near-Infrared amera (NIRCam) filter (F444W) will probe as blue as the B band t z = 9 and I band at z = 5 (as shown in Fig. 1 ) allowing for igh-resolution measurements of galaxy sizes in this regime.\n.4 Redshift evolution\nn the literature there has been a wide range of presented methods or measuring the redshift evolution of galaxy sizes, with various pproaches and galaxy sample definitions used for the computation. o produce a comprehensive comparison with FLARES we employ on-linear least-squares fitting (again using SCIPY.CURVE FIT ) to roduce fits to equation ( 2 ) from various sample definitions pulled rom the complete galaxy sample, all weighted with the FLARES\nFigure 11. The upper row of panels shows fits to the size\u2013luminosity relation for all rest-frame bands in Fig. 1 . Solid lines represent the FLARES fits while dashed lines show the BLUETIDES (Marshall et al. 2022 ) fits for the same selection of bands. The lower row of panels shows straight line fits to the ratio between the intrinsic and attenuated sizes for each band. The colour of the line denotes the band, with the bluest bands in blue and reddest bands in red. The colour bar shows the central wavelength of each rest-frame band in microns.\nTable 3. The fitting parameters for equation ( 2 ) in Fig. 12 split into three redshift samples.

The results of this fitting are presented in able 3 . In Fig. 12 , we present these fits for a number of different sample efinitions found in the literature. Fig. 13 shows a comparison of the lope ( m ) from various studies, left to right: FLARES , Marshall et al. 2022 ), Oesch et al. ( 2010 ), Holwerda et al. ( 2015 ), Kawamata et al. 2018 ), and Ono et al. ( 2013 ), with a shaded region representing he range of slopes from Ma et al. ( 2018 ). We present the fitting arameters for these fits in Table 3 . For the low-luminosity sample we see a good agreement in slope\netween FLARES and Oesch et al. ( 2010 ) and Ono et al. ( 2013 ). For the ther FLARES samples we find comparatively high slopes compared o the other works. Ho we ver, these v alues are in agreement with Ma t al. ( 2018 ) who predict values in the range m = 1\u20132 depending on he fixed mass or luminosity regime (shown by the shaded region). All ut the low-luminosity sample\u2019s slopes are larger than the evolution f systems at fixed circular velocity, implying an increasing feedback ontribution to the evolution with decreasing redshift. Conversely, he low-luminosity sample\u2019s evolution is closer to that of a system t fixed mass with the same additional feedback contribution. As eedback becomes more efficient with decreasing redshift the starorming gas will be given more thermal energy and thus change the ynamics of the star-forming gas, increasing the radii at which stars an form and thus the half-light radii.\nLimiting the included redshifts in the FLARES sample cannot only e used to compare to the more limited samples of BLUETIDES , with\no galaxies at z < 7, and observations, where z \u2265 10 galaxies are xceedingly rare, but can also probe the evolution of size during articular epochs. To do this we limited the sample to a high- z ample limited to z \u2265 7 and a low- z sample with z \u2264 10, the results f which are also included in Table 3 . Limiting to z \u2265 7 resulted n a large increase in the slope of the redshift evolution alongside nrealistically high normalizations, predicting z = 0 sizes of the order 300 pkpc for the low-luminosity sample and o v er double the z = 0 ize in the limited and high-luminosity samples in the other redshift elections. Conversely, limiting to z \u2264 10 instead results in fitting esults consistent with those produced by the full redshift range. his casts doubt on the sparse z > 10 measurements in observations ausing the differences in slope between the FLARES measurement nd observational measurements. More interestingly the differences n fits between redshift regimes imply a significantly faster evolution f galaxy size at the earliest times, even for the most dim and diffuse alaxies in the low-luminosity sample. It is clear from Fig. 12 that a iecewise fit produces a considerably better fit to the data than fitting cross the entire redshift range.\nTensions between FLARES and the observations are far less stark han those between FLARES and BLUETIDES samples but are none he less evident for the capped and high-luminosity samples, we do o we ver see a good agreement in the low-luminosity sample. The ensions here could be explained by how sparse observations are at he highest redshifts due to the small area co v ered at the required epth; given that the low-luminosity sample in FLARES is also sparse\nMNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nM\na F t s u i n t v r g\n6\nI i t f p o s i s m\no \u00c5\nFigure 13.

Additional observations from upcoming observatories poplating the highest redshifts will increase the area and depth sampled n at this epoch and could rectify this tension. It should also be oted ho we ver that subgrid models require intensi v e inv estigation at his epoch, with comparison to robust observations to ascertain the alidity of their behaviour. Future work will be able to converge the esults of both simulations and observations to a consistent story of alaxy size evolution. C O N C L U S I O N S\nn this paper, we have presented an analysis of galaxy sizes at z \u2265 5 n the FLARES simulations across a wide array of environments. To do his we produced synthetic galaxy images using photometry in restrame UV and visual bands derived using the LoS attenuation method resented in Vijayan et al. ( 2021 ). We presented an efficient method f image computation by utilizing a KD-Tree of pixel coordinates and moothing stellar particles o v er their SPH kernels. We employed this maging method to produce synthetic galaxy images, from which the ize of galaxies were measured using a non-parametric pixel-based ethod to account for the clumpy nature of galaxies at high redshift. Using these measurements we probed both the intrinsic and bserved size\u2013luminosity relation in the rest-frame far-UV (1500 ), findings are as follows.\nNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\n(i) The intrinsic size\u2013luminosity relation is bimodal, with one ntrinsically compact and bright population and one intrinsically iffuse and dim population. (ii) These two populations result in a ne gativ e slope to the restrame far-UV intrinsic size\u2013luminosity distribution. (iii) Including the effects of dust attenuation results in the pereived size of galaxies to increase, with the most intrinsically ompact galaxies increase in size by as much as 50 times.\n(iv) The increase in size due to dust attenuation inverts the slope f the size\u2013luminosity relation, resulting in a fair agreement between bservations and in this work. However, the FLARES sample lacks ow-luminosity compact galaxies that have been shown to steepen he size\u2013luminosity relation in lensing studies. Conversely, the bservational samples lack the diffuse and dim galaxies that are resent in this work, these act to flatten the size\u2013luminosity relation. he effects of these missing galaxies highlight the need for highesolution simulations in the future and observationally motivated easurement methods. (v) Dust distributions in these compact galaxies are highly conentrated with half-metal radii of < 1 pkpc, heavily attenuating he intrinsically bright cores and increasing the observed half-light adius. This may be observable as strong dust gradients.\nWe performed size measurements for a range of rest-frame UV and isual bands, finding an anticorrelation between the slope of the size\u2013 uminosity relation and wavelength. This anticorrelation becomes eaker with decreasing redshift as the intrinsic stellar distribution\ni J\nU 1 m m a t fi c s o i a t \u2264 l t w f h\nh o J w a o\nl s h a e t s\np m s o b s t p\nA\nW s\nl i l e\nI D b S\ns N\nR s T R s a S n\nD\nT p d c a\nR\nA B\nB B B\nB\nB B\nB\nB\nB B C C C C C\nC C C D D\nD\nD D\nF\nF F F F G G G\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1921/6589413 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nncreases in size. This represents a falsifiable prediction that the WST will be able to probe at high resolution with NIRCam.\nWe then investigated the evolution of size with redshift in the farV, finding slopes for multiple sample definitions in the range m = .21\u20131.87. These values are consistent with theoretical predictions odified by additional contributions to the evolution by feedback echanisms. At low luminosity the evolution is consistent with n evolution at fixed mass ( m = 1) with additional evolution due o feedback, while high-luminosity galaxies are consistent with a xed circular velocity evolution ( m = 1.5), again with an additional ontribution from feedback. With the exception of the low-luminosity ample giving a good agreement, these results are in tension with bserv ations. They do ho we ver broadly agree with the range found n the FIRE-2 simulations. The limited observational galaxy sample t extremely high redshifts could contribute to this tension. Limiting he galaxy sample to both a low (5 \u2264 z \u2264 10) and high (7 \u2264 z\n12) redshift sample yielded little change in the results for the ow-redshift sample but resulted in significantly higher slopes for he high-redshift sample. This implies a non-constant size evolution ith faster evolution in the highest redshift bins. Further observations rom future high-redshifts surv e ys are needed to probe the differences ighlighted here in addition to future simulations adding to the theory. With the launch of the JWST we will soon be able to probe these igh-redshift regimes with far greater fidelity and further strengthen ur understanding of the earliest epochs of galaxy evolution. The WST will allow us to probe higher redshifts at high resolution ith NIRCam. Not only will this further populate galaxy samples t z > 8, it will also increase the completeness of the high-redshift bservational surv e ys at low luminosity. Future work will include the next generation of FLARES simuating a wider range of environments, probing more regions, and imulating a significant volume at high mass resolution. Including igher resolution simulations will enable comparison to the dim nd compact galaxies found in lensing studies, while increasing the f fecti ve volume with more resimulated regions will allow FLARES o reach a volume comparable to the largest upcoming observational urv e ys from Euclid .\nIn addition to the next generation of FLARES , the underlying hysical processes go v erning the size evolution in the subgrid odel will be probed. This will include stellar and AGN feedback, tar formation conditions, and chemical enrichment. The effects f simulation and observational structure detection methods will e investigated to quantify the effect of survey depth and the egmentation of substructures. In particular this will aim to probe he effects of structure detection methods on the diffuse galaxy opulation and the effect this has on the size\u2013luminosity relation.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the EAGLE team for their efforts in developing the EAGLE imulation code.\nWe acknowledge the indispensable contribution from the pubicly available programming language PYTHON (van Rossum 1995 ), ncluding the NUMPY (Harris et al. 2020 ), ASTROPY (Astropy Colaboration et al. 2013 ), MATPLOTLIB (Hunter 2007 ), SCIPY (Virtanen t al. 2020 ), and H5PY (Collette 2013 ) packages.\nThis work used the DiRAC@Durham facility managed by the nstitute for Computational Cosmology on behalf of the STFC iRAC HPC Facility ( www.dirac.ac.uk).

A1 shows a comparison between the Gaussian and spline moothing methods. Qualitatively it can be seen the Gaussian method esults in a smoother light distribution due to the indefinite boundaries f the Gaussian smoothing kernel, this spreads light beyond the e xtent\u2019 giv en by the SPH kernel. The spline method produces a more ranular image with clearer small structures at the outskirts of the oV. The residual image shows that the Gaussian method\u2019s spreading f light leads to differences at large radii where the Gaussian image is righter due to the spreading of light. Ho we ver, this does not mean the aussian image is consistently more luminous at large radii, compact tructures at large radii in the spline image have more concentrated mission causing these regions to outshine the Gaussian image. This ffect is also noticeable in the centre of the image where there is ring of spline dominated pixels due to this concentration of light. hese effects are however minimal with each image differing at most y 0.1 dex. We further show the effects of smoothing method in Fig. A2\nhere we compare the measured sizes of galaxies in each method. n the vast majority of cases the Gaussian smoothing results in larger perceived size due to the increased spread of a sinle stellar particle\u2019s luminosity. The instances where the spline ethod yields larger sizes are dominated by smaller galaxies where he dilution of the Gaussian method causes structures to occupy ore pixels relative to the more concentrated spline method and hus a larger area is used in the pix el-driv en size calculation. It hould be noted here that the spline method produces a better greement with observations with the Gaussian method producing ize\u2013luminosity relations that o v erestimate galaxy sizes relativ e to bservations.\nFigure A1. A comparison of log-scaled stacked images produced using the Gaussian smoothing method (left), spline kernel method (middle), and a residual image showing the difference between the log of the two methods images. The images themselves are stacks in the far-UV of all galaxies in the FLARES sample (irrespective of completeness).\nFigure A2.

In some cases there is minimal difference etween the smoothed and unsmoothed measurements, particularly or compact galaxies where the stellar kernels themselves are very mall resulting in minimal smoothing. In the vast majority of cases he smoothing increases the measured size, with the most diffuse\nncomplete galaxies (transparent distribution) extending to much arger sizes when smoothed.\nPPENDI X B: SI ZE\u2013LUMI NOSI TY R E L AT I O N AV E L E N G T H VA R I AT I O N\nn this appendix, we present the fitting parameters for the wavelength volution of the size\u2013luminosity relation shown in Fig. 11 (Tables 1 and B2 ).\nMNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\nM\nTable B1.

We can see for the largest (most luminous) galaxies the omission f birth cloud attenuation has little effect on the measured size. hese large galaxies have extremely concentrated dust distributions, s shown in Fig. 8 , where the attenuation is dominated by the ISM igure D1. A comparison between observed sizes of galaxies using the ixel method at z = 5 measured from photometry including birth cloud ttenuation ( x -axis) and photometry without the birth cloud contribution ( y - xis). The hexbins show the number density weighted using the FLARES eighting scheme. The dashed line represents a 1:1 relation. In this plot we o not differentiate between the compact and diffuse galaxy populations and nly present the full complete sample. ontribution. For the smaller (less luminous) galaxies we see a larger catter in size with a maximum increase of \u223c0.5 dex. These galaxies ave a more diffuse dust distribution limiting the contribution to ttenuation from the ISM. For galaxies in the diffuse population with oung stellar populations the birth cloud attenuation can represent a onsiderably larger contribution to the o v erall attenuation. We stress hat this comparison is presented to quantify the effect of birth cloud ttenuation in the extreme. The model parameters were derived using ts to observational data and thus provide robust results that give a ood agreement with observational high-redshift studies not used in he fitting of model parameters. his paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 514, 1921\u20131939 (2022)\ner on 18 January 2024"
