The intensity value obtained from the interactions provides information about its magnetic behavior. We observed two types of experimental magnetic behavior, i. e., demagnetized and magnetized. Our approach represents the first experimental way to analyze the magnetic behavior of a nanostructure considering its magnetic dependence, which is very important for applications in sensors, for example.\nKeywords: Energy, experimental, interactions, nanostructures, nanowires\n\u2217Corresponding author: joseholanda.silvajunior@ufrpe.br\nPreprint submitted to ArXiv October 25, 2022\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n12 78\n3v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nMany research groups investigate the magnetic properties of nanometric systems [1-8]. Such interest is due particularly to the magnetic interactions that influence the properties of nanostructures [9-13]. As it is well known, magnetic interactions lead to complex phenomena that are far from well understood [14-16]. One of the methods used to analyze these effects is the magnetization process. Such a process produces the remanent magnetization used as a source of information about the intensity value from the interactions [17-22]. One can manipulate the magnetic interactions using the remanent state by the \u2206m curves. Such \u2206m curves are comparisons between isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM(H)) and direct current demagnetization (DCD(H)) curves [23-28].\nIn this Letter, we present an experimental analysis to determine the intensity value from the magnetic interactions in nanowire arrays electrodeposited on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. We electrodeposited the nanowires of different materials (permalloy, iron, and cobalt) and interpreted the experimental results considering the angular dependence from the interactions. Through our analysis we detected two types of magnetic behavior: demagnetized and magnetized. The demagnetized state refers to the process in which the predominant interactions are demagnetizing (PID). On the other hand, the magnetized state is when the predominant interactions are magnetizing (PIM). This type of analysis is of fundamental importance for applications in devices dependent on magnetic behavior [1, 3, 6].\nIn the Fig. 1 we present an illustration of a hexagonal distribution of\nnanowire arrays electrodeposited in membranes of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), as in Refs. [3], [4] and [5]. We also define in Fig. 1 the \u03b8 and \u03b8H angles, which are the angles that the magnetization and magnetic field respectively make with the axis of the nanowires during the measurements of IRM(H) and DCD(H) curves, which were performed by using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) model EV7 at room temperature. The polycrystalline nanowire (permalloy, iron, or cobalt) arrays were electrodeposited onto AAO membranes. We manufacture some samples, i. e, eletrodeposited membranes with pore di-\nameters of D = 18 nm and a pore center-to-center distance of d = 56 nm, which we call NiFe-A (permalloy), Fe (iron), and Co (cobalt). We manufacture another sample, i. e, a eletrodeposited membrane with a pore diameter of D = 44 nm and a pore center-to-center distance of d = 98 nm, which we call NiFe-B (permalloy). All eletrodeposited nanowires have a length on the order of 1 to 5 \u00b5m.\nIn Figs. 2 (a), (b), (c) and (d) we show the maps of experimental interactions in \u03b8H = 00 \u25e6, where the hatched areas represent the intersection of the curves defined by the equations\nmd2(H) = \u2206mExp + [1\u2212 2mr(H)] (1)\nand\nmd1(H) = 1\u2212 2mr(H). (2)\nHere md2 = DCD(H)2/IRM(HMax), md1 = DCD(H)1/IRM(HMax) and mr = IRM(H)/IRM(HMax) are the direct current demagnetizations (DCD(H)) and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM(H)) curves, all normalized by the maximum value of the isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM(H)) curve for\nthe maximum magnetic field H = HMax. The experimental term \u2206mExp represents the magnetic interactions. In the Fig. 2 (a), we observe only PID interactions, which convey the influence of the amount of electrodeposited magnetic material. On the other hand, in the experimental interaction maps presented in Figs. 2 (b)-(d), we illustrate the evidence of PID and PIM interactions for each material (iron, cobalt, and permalloy). In the Table 1 we present the intensity values found for the PID and PIM interactions using the equations (1)\nand (2) in I = lim||\u03b4||\u21920 \u2211N i=1 |\u2206mExp,i|\u03b4imr(H) [27], where \u2206mExp,i < 0 for PID and \u2206mExp,i > 0 for PIM. The values show the behavior from the magnetic interactions in each sample defining an intrinsic characteristic that can be used to define the behavior of interactions in devices.\nIn the Figs. 2 (d), (e), (f) and (g) we show the behavior of the angular dependence of the experimental interaction maps of the NiFe-B sample for \u03b8H = 00\u25e6, \u03b8H = 30 \u25e6 , 60\u25e6 and 90\u25e6. These maps show the variation in the intensity of the experimental term \u2206mExp. We observe from the experimental interaction\nmaps of the Figs. 2 (d), (e), (f) and (g), that the PID and PIM interactions decrease as the angle \u03b8H increases. Such behavior is a result of the decrease in energy balance during the IRM and DCD measurements.\nThe mean-field approach introduced by Ref. [13] is an estimation of the dipolar energy in real nanowire arrays, which is an aspect important in this type of sample. Even in electrodeposited membranes with equally long nanowires, the dipole field is not uniform along the length of the nanowire. The inhomogeneous dipolar field leads to dipolar interactions between nanowires; the situation is even more complicated here because the length of the nanowire is not uniform. In general, the analysis of the angular dependence of the PID interactions for nanowire arrays needs to consider the energy density of packing of the nanowires in the array [13], which may be written as ENWAPID = \u22123\u03c0PM2sin2(\u03d5PID+\u03b8H), where P = (\u03c0/2 \u221a 3)(D/d)2 is the packing factor of the nanowires in the array, d is the interwire distance and D the diameter of nanowire and \u03d5PID is the PID angle defined by \u03d5PID = \u03b8PID \u2212 \u03b8H . In this way, the angular dependence of intensity value for the PID interactions is described here for nanowire arrays by\nIPID = I NW PID(0)cos(\u03b8H) + I NWA PID (0)sin 2(\u03d5PID + \u03b8H), (3)\nwhere INWPID(0) and I NWA PID (0) refer to the maximum values obtained for the intensities of interactions for the individual nanowires (NW) and the nanowire arrays (NWA) [26]. In the Fig. 3 we present the angular variation of the PID and PIM interactions of the NiFe-B sample obtained through the experimental\ninteraction maps using the same procedure realized to obtain the values in Table 1. We chose to analyze this sample because it has the largest amount of electrodeposited magnetic material. Fitting the data of the Fig. 3 (a) with Equation (3), we found INWPID(0) = 0.42, I NWA PID (0) = 0.35 and \u03d5PID = \u22127\u25e6. The values obtained for the intensities INWPID(0) and I NWA PID (0) are in good agreement with the values of the Table 1 for PID interactions.\nAccording to Fig. 3 (b), the NiFe-B sample exhibits PIM interactions. The PIM interactions are associated with the exchange interaction between grains or nanowires. The exchange energy density can be considered constant in the nanowires and for nanowire arrays can be written as EExc = \u2212Acos(\u03d5PIM+\u03b8H), where A is the exchange constant [3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 25] and \u03d5PIM is the PIM angle defined by \u03d5PIM = \u03b8PIM\u2212\u03b8H . Hence, the angular dependence of intensity value for the PIM interactions is written as [26]:\nIPIM = I NW PIM (0) + I"

Considering the data of the Fig. 3 (b) and its respective fit with Equation (4), we obtained INWPIM (0) = 0.00049, I NWA PIM (0) = 0.00052 and \u03d5PIM = 114 \u25e6. The values obtained for the intensities INWPIM (0) and I NWA PIM (0) are in perfect\nagreement with Table 1 for PIM interactions. The angles \u03d5PID = \u22127\u25e6 and\n\u03d5PIM = 114 \u25e6 reveal the positions of maximum equilibrium of the spins and its liquid magnetic moment associated during the experimental measurements. We observed a \u03d5 = \u22127\u25e6 + 114\u25e6 = 107\u25e6 phase difference between the maximum equilibrium positions of the PID and PIM interactions. The observed phase difference is unequivocal evidence that we can separate magnetic interactions. Furthermore, the results show that magnetic interactions in nanostructures are complex (depending on material, shape, experimental configuration, and excitation parameters), and its analysis is fundamentally necessary for applications. The research supported by the experimental results presented here does not converge to the dependence of any magnetic instabilities in applications.\nNanostructures, such as nanowires, are used in a diversity of applications spreading from nanoscale optoelectronic devices (such as sensors, for example) to high-density data storage media. The remnant state offers a fundamental and natural way of studying magnetic interactions for applications. In summary, the approach we present here incorporates the measurement of magnetic interactions experimentally. Furthermore, it represents a way of analyzing the value of the intensity of interactions considering them as PID and PIM, which is of fundamental importance to describe the behavior of magnetic interactions in devices."
