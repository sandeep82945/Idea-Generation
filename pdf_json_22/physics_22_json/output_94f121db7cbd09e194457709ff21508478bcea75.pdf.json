Its practical application in device independent protocols, such as secure key distribution, randomness certification, etc., demands identification and amplification of such correlations observed in the quantum world. In this Letter we study the prospect of nonlocality distillation, wherein, by applying a natural set of free operations (called wirings) on many copies of weakly nonlocal systems, one aims to generate correlations of higher nonlocal strength. In the simplest Bell scenario, we identify a protocol, namely, logical OR-AND wiring, that can distil nonlocality to significantly high degree starting from arbitrarily weak quantum nonlocal correlations. As it turns out, our protocol has several interesting facets: (i) it demonstrates that set of distillable quantum correlations has non zero measure in the full eight-dimensional correlation space, (ii) it can distil quantum Hardy correlations by preserving its structure, (iii) it shows that (nonlocal) quantum correlations sufficiently close to the local deterministic points can be distilled by a significant amount. Finally, we also demonstrate efficacy of the considered distillation protocol in detecting postquantum correlations.\nIntroduction.\u2013 One of the most celebrated non-classical aspects of quantum mechanics was pioneered by J. S. Bell in the year 1964 [1] (see also [2]). Bell\u2019s theorem mandates departure of quantum theory from the locally causal world view which subsequently has been confirmed in several milestone experiments led by Clauser, Aspect, Zeilinger, and others [3\u2013 12]. Unlike other non-classical features, such as entanglement and coherence, study of nonlocality can be conducted in a device independent setting where only the input-output statistics of the device matters and one does not need to know the inner design or working mechanisms of the device [13]. Along with foundational implications, Bell nonlocality has also been identified as the necessary resource for several important protocols [14\u201325], which, thus, makes the question of refinement or distillation of this resource practically indispensable. Study of nonlocality distillation has two major implications \u2013 (i) practical: where one aims to distil nonlocal correlations observed in the quantum world which can be then applied to make information flow networks efficient and secure, and (ii) foundational: where the goal is to identify post quantum correlations, which, in turn, helps to understand the speciality of quantum theory among other possibilities allowed within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. Interestingly, in Ref.[26], Forster et al. proposed a nonlocality distillation protocol that can extract nonlocality in stronger form starting with many copies of weakly nonlocal systems; this work has inspired a number of subsequent works consisting of interesting results on nonlocality distillation [27\u201341].\nThe research conducted so far on nonlocality distillation is mainly focused on distilling post quantum correlations [27\u2013 32, 34\u201339]. Only a few protocols are known that successfully distil some quantum correlations [26, 39]. The difficulty arises due to the top-down approach considered in earlier works where one starts with some parametric family of generic no-signaling (NS) correlations, and after obtaining a successful distillation protocol the aim is to check\nwhether for some range of the parameter values the considered NS correlations allow quantum realization or not. For the simplest bipartite case, the well known analytical criterion by Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes [42\u201344] and the NavascuesPironio-Acin (NPA) criterion [45], and in general case a hierarchy of semi-definite programming conditions [46] can serve this purpose. Only in some fortunate cases sophisticated choices of the parametric class of NS correlations might lead to a desirable subset of quantum realizable correlations. However, the approach has severe pitfall when more input-output scenarios are considered, as the recent mathematical breakthrough by W. Slofstra and the subsequent results establish that the set of quantum correlations is not topologically closed [47\u201349]. There are only a few results that report distillation of nonlocal correlations within quantum setup [26, 39], albeit the nonlocal strength of the distilled correlation is low. Therefore the aspects of analytical and quantitative study for distillation of quantum nonlocal correlations remain open.\nIn this letter, we propose a generic framework for nonlocality distillation which overcomes limitations of the thus far proposed protocols. In contrast to the previously reported results, we intend to find out efficient distillation protocol(s) for quantum correlations. To this aim we consider the bottomup approach. Instead of generic NS signaling correlations we start with weak nonlocal correlations which is quantum, and then try to obtain a nonlocality distillation protocol. The set of quantum correlations being closed under wirings [40, 41] assures the resulting distilled correlations to be quantum. Interestingly, we identify a simple protocol and come up with a generic approach that successfully distil nonlocality in a large class of weakly nonlocal quantum correlations. Towards this goal, first we consider a variant of nonlocality test proposed by Lucien Hardy [50]. Success probability in Hardy\u2019s test qualifies as a measure of nonlocality for Hardy\u2019s correlations [51]. Given two copies of a quantum Hardy correlation, we show that there exist a simple wiring that can distil Hardy nonloar X iv :2 20 8.\n13 97\n6v 4\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 J\nun 2\n02 3\n2\ncality. We call this wiring logical OR-AND protocol, where OR (\u2228) and AND (\u2227) functions on 2-bits z1, z2 are defined as \u2228(z1, z2) = max{z1, z2} and \u2227(z1, z2) = min{z1, z2}, respectively. The OR-AND protocol allows an immediate ncopy generalization (see Fig.1), which can provide a substantial distillation of Hardy\u2019s success with a sufficiently large copies of initial correlations. Further, we show that the ORAND wiring when applied to a broader class of quantum correlations yields an interesting result: an arbitrarily small violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) [3] inequality can be amplified to a significantly higher degree. Finally, by applying our protocol we demonstrate that nonlocal correlations arbitrarily close to the extreme points of the set of local correlations are always distilled, which, in turn, establishes that set of distillable quantum correlations has nonzero measure in the full eight dimensions of the correlation space. We also study distillation of post quantum correlations, and show that OR-AND protocol becomes efficient there too. In particular, we find correlations whose post-quantum signature is established through OR-AND distillation, while the known information principles, such as nontrivial communication complexity [52] and information causality [53, 54], fail to serve the purpose. In the end, we discuss novelty of the approach followed here in comparison to the existing methods on nonlocality distillation.\nPreliminaries.\u2013 A Bell experiment involves spatially separated parties performing local measurements on the respective parts of a composite system shared among them. The simplest case considers two parties, Alice and Bob, with their respective inputs to the box denoted as x and y, and outputs from the box denoted as a and b, respectively, where x, y, a, b \u2208 {0, 1}; and this is generally called the 2-2-2 Bell scenario. Correlation generated by a box P is the set of joint input-output probabilities, i.e., P \u2261 {p(ab|xy)}. Set of boxes satisfying the no-signaling (NS) condition forms an 8-dimensional polytope NS having 24 vertices [55]: 8 non-local vertices (PopescuRohrlich (PR) boxes [56]) given by P\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3NL \u2261 {p(ab|xy) = 1 2\u03b4(a\u2295b, xy\u2295\u03b1x\u2295\u03b2y\u2295\u03b3)} where \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 {0, 1}, and 16 local deterministic vertices given by P\u03b11\u03b12\u03b21\u03b22L \u2261 {p(ab|xy) = \u03b4(a,\u03b11x\u2295\u03b12) \u03b4(b,\u03b21y\u2295\u03b22)} where \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22 \u2208 {0, 1}. A correlation is termed as local if and only if it allows a decomposition of the form p(ab|xy) = \u2211 p(\u03bb)p(a|x, \u03bb)p(b|y, \u03bb), where \u03bb is some classical variable shared between Alice and Bob following a distribution {p(\u03bb)} [1] (see also [2]). Collection of all local correlations forms a sub polytope L, within NS , with 16 local deterministic boxes as their vertices. Correlations obtained from local quantum measurements performed on some bipartite quantum state are called quantum correlations. Set of all quantum correlations Q forms a convex set (but not a polytope) lying strictly in between local and NS polytope, i.e., L \u228a Q \u228a NS [57]. No signaling correlations that do not belong to the set L are called nonlocal as they do not allow a local-causal description [1]. We consider one of the eight symmetries for the nonlocal correlations witnessed by the Bell CHSH inequality\nB \u2261 \u27e800\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e801\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e810\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e811\u27e9 \u2264 2, (1)\nwhere \u27e8xy\u27e9 := \u2211\na,b(\u22121)a\u2295b p(ab|xy). Then, only one PRbox violates the inequality and there are exactly eight extremal local boxes that saturate the local bound. These nine boxes, which form an eight dimensional simplex [58], are as follows\n{ P110NL } \u21d2B=4,  P0001L1 , P 0100 L2 , P 0111 L3 , P1101L4 , P 1111 L5 , P 1000 L6 ,\nP0010L7 , P 1010 L8 \u21d2B=2. (2) The CHSH value B < 2 for all the remaining extremal nonlocal or local boxes. The choice of this symmetry is due to the simple OR-AND function description of our distillation protocol. One can always apply local reversible relabellings to switch to any of the eight symmetries (then the protocol become suitably relabelled OR-AND ). From here on, we will simply refer to the nine boxes in Eq. (2) by dropping their superscripts.\nWhile violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality is a paradigmatic test for certifying nonlocality of a correlation, Hardy provided a simpler nonlocality argument for the same [50]. He showed that if the following four conditions\npHardy \u2261 p(0, 0|A0, B0) > 0, (3)\n3 p(0, 0|A0, B1) = p(0, 0|A1, B0) = p(1, 1|A1, B1) = 0,\nare satisfied, then the resulting correlation is necessarily nonlocal. The probability pHardy in Eq.(3) quantifies strength of nonlocality of Hardy correlations. While the maximum value of pHardy in no-signaling set is 1/2 (achieved with PR box), its optimal value in quantum mechanics turns out to be (5 \u221a 5 \u2212 11)/2 \u2248 0.09 [59] (see also [60, 61]), and it is achieved on a pure two qubit state with projective measurements. The correlation yielding the maximum Hardy nonlocality in quantum theory reads\nHmaxQ = (5 \u221a 5\u2212 11) PNL\n+ 1\n2 (7\u2212 3\n\u221a 5) 4\u2211 i=1 PLi + ( \u221a 5\u2212 2) PL5 , (4)\nand it has been shown to be an extreme point of the set Q [57]. Distillation of quantum nonlocality.\u2013 In the the following parts of this letter, we first present our results on distillation of quantum nonlocal correlations. For ease of readability, here we present our main results and discuss the important proofs. The detailed analyses of some of the more technical aspects is deferred to the Supplemental. We start by presenting our results on nonlocality distillation of Hardy\u2019s correlations, by applying the OR-AND protocol.\nTheorem 1. The OR-AND wiring preserves the structure of quantum Hardy correlations and can efficiently distil the strength of success probability in Hardy\u2019s test of nonlocality.\nProof. Within the considered CHSH symmetry [i.e., Eq.(2)], any NS correlation can be represented as a convex mixture of the nonlocal vertex along with 8 local vertices. A quantum Hardy correlation demands nonzero weights for exactly 5 different local vertices along with the nonlocal vertex [38]. This, in turn, ensures that the correlation matrix has precisely 3 zero elements corresponding to probabilities taking the value zero in the Hardy\u2019s test. It turns out that, then any quantum Hardy correlation HQ, can be represented as\nHQ=c0PNL+ 5\u2211 i=1 ciPLi ; ci > 0 \u2200 i, and 5\u2211 i=0 ci=1, (5)\nwith success in Hardy\u2019s test pHardy = c0 2 . On applying the ORAND wiring to 2 copies of (parents) HQ one obtains a resulting (child) Hardy correlation H(2)Q with nonlocality strength p(2)\nHardy = ( c02 + c1) 2 \u2212 c21. Similarly, on applying OR-AND protocol to n copies of HQ we obtain a (child) Hardy correlation H(n)Q with nonlocality strength p (n) Hardy = ( c02 + c1) n \u2212 cn1 . The protocol serves the purpose of an effective n copy distillation as long as p(k)\nHardy > p(k\u22121) Hardy , for all k \u2208 {2, 3, ..., n}. For\nexample, let us consider the class of quantum correlations\nH\u0303Q(\u03bb) := \u03bbH max Q + (1\u2212 \u03bb)PL1 , \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1], (6)\nfor which the Hardy success probability pHardy(\u03bb) = \u03bbk1 = \u03bb 2 (5 \u221a 5\u221211). Then, on applying the OR-AND protocol to two\ncopies of (parent) H\u0303Q(\u03bb) yields the child H\u0303 (2) Q (\u03bb) with Hardy success probability p(2) Hardy\n(\u03bb) = [\u03bb(k1 + 2k2) + 2(1\u2212 \u03bb)]\u03bbk1. Then it follows that p(2)\nHardy (\u03bb) > pHardy(\u03bb) for \u03bb \u2208 (0, \u03d5\u22121),\nwhere \u03d5 is the golden ratio, i.e., \u03d5 = 1+ \u221a 5\n2 . On considering a sufficiently large copies (n) of very weakly nonlocal correlations H\u0303Q with pHardy(\u03bb) \u2192 0, we find that the OR-AND wiring results in a Hardy correlation with a considerably large nonlocal strength p(n)\nHardy = 0.041 (see Supplemental).\nIn the Supplemental we further shown that arbitrarily weak quantum Hardy correlation can be distilled up to 0.0433. Since a correlation with Hardy success pHardy yields CHSH value 2+4pHardy [51], in order to measure the efficacy of distillation let us define the Tsirelson gain in percentage as follows,\n\u2206T := 1 2( \u221a 2\u2212 1) (BChild \u2212 BParent)\u00d7 100%. (7)\nManifestly, the gain will be 100% when by wiring a nonlocal correlation with arbitrary small CHSH violation, the distilled correlation achieves Tsirelson\u2019s bound \u2013 the maximum CHSH value in Q [62]. We then obtain that under the ORAND wiring a quantum Hardy correlation can yield Tsirelson gain at-most 20.9%.\nWhile applying multi-copy OR-AND protocol it turns out that the optimal distillation of Hardy\u2019s success is obtained with a threshold number of initial boxes, and the success gets decreased if more number of initial boxes are considered. Our next proposition provides an exact expression for the optimal number of initial Hardy correlation required for maximal distillation.\nProposition 1. A no-signaling Hardy correlation of the form of Eq.(5) yields Hardy success p(n)\nHardy = ( c02 + c1) n \u2212 cn1 , when its n-copy is wired under OR-AND protocol. The optimal value of distilled Hardy success is given by popt\nHardy =\nmax{p(N) Hardy , p(N+1) Hardy }, where\nN := \u230a log ( log c1\nlog c02 + c1\n) / log ( c0 2 + c1\nc1\n)\u230b . (8)\nProof provided in Supplemental. In the next, we rather consider quantum nonlocal correlation, not necessarily in Hardy form, to establish an even higher Tsirelson gain through the OR-AND wiring.\nTheorem 2. Starting with a quantum correlation with arbitrarily small CHSH nonlocality OR-AND wiring can yield Tsirelson gain up to (\u2248) 39.75%.\nProof of Theorem 2 follows similar arguments as of Theorem 1. However, for the sake of completeness detailed proof is provided in supplementary file.\nTheorem 2 has many interesting implications for information processing tasks, wherein higher CHSH violation is desirable for higher performance of the protocols. For instance, the amount of certifiable randomness as obtained\n4 in [17] monotonically scales with the degree of violation of CHSH inequality. On the other hand, the authors in [22] come up with a conflicting interest Bayesian game where the payoff in correlated equilibrium strategy increases linearly with the amount of CHSH violation (see also [23]). More recently, the authors in [24] proposed a communication task where preshared entanglement between sender and receiver is shown to enhance the communication utility of a perfect classical communication channel. As it turns out payoff of this task is also a linear function of the value of CHSH expression [25].\nBy now, an observant reader might have already noticed that the local box PL1 plays crucial role in the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. We will now use this observation to prove a generic result as formalized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. CHSH nonlocality of any no-singling correlation of the form C\u0303(\u03bb) = \u03bbC + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)PL1 , where 0 < \u03bb \u2264 1 and C \u2208 ConvexHull {PNL,PLi | i \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 8}} can be distilled through OR-AND wiring by choosing the values of \u03bb sufficiently small. Furthermore, 2-copy OR-AND distillation is successful for all the C\u0303(\u03bb) correlation boxes whenever \u03bb < 2 3c0; where c0 is the PNL fraction in C.\nProof. Given two correlations \u03c71, \u03c72 \u2208 NS , let W[\u03c71, \u03c72] denotes the resulting correlation obtained under OR-AND wiring, where W[\u03c7, \u03c7] \u2261 \u03c7(2). We, therefore, have\nC\u0303(2)(\u03bb) = \u03bb2C(2) + \u03bb(1\u2212 \u03bb) {W [C, PL1 ] +W [PL1 ,C]} + (1\u2212 \u03bb)2W [PL1 , PL1 ] .\nA straightforward calculation yields, W [C, PL1 ] = C = W [PL1 ,C], that further result in\nC\u0303(2)(\u03bb) = \u03bb2C(2) + 2\u03bb(1\u2212 \u03bb)C + (1\u2212 \u03bb)2PL1 .\nWhile CHSH value of the box PL1 is 2, let the CHSH value of the boxes C and C(2) be denoted as K (> 2) and K(2) respectively. Then, the CHSH value of the correlations C\u0303(\u03bb) and C\u0303(2)(\u03bb) can be expressed as,\nB(\u03bb) = \u03bb K + 2 (1\u2212 \u03bb), B(2)(\u03bb) = \u03bb2 K(2) + 2 \u03bb (1\u2212 \u03bb)K + 2 (1\u2212 \u03bb)2.\nA successful distillation demands B(2)(\u03bb) > B(\u03bb), implying (K \u2212 2) + (K(2) \u2212 2K + 2)\u03bb > 0, which can be guaranteed by choosing the values for \u03bb accordingly. This completes first part of the proof. A bit more calculation yeilds the quantitative bound \u03bb < 23c0, on the radius of the eight dimensional Ball centered at point PL1 assuring 2-copy OR-AND distillation such that any nonlocal no-signaling correlation, be it quantum or post-quantum, choosen from a nonzero-measure sector of the Ball can be distilled (in the full eight dimensions). We provide the detailed calculation in the appended Supplemental Material .\nTheorem 3 has profound topological implication. It establishes that the sets of no-signalling as well as quantum correlations allowing nonlocality distillation have non-zero measure\nin the full eight dimensional correlation space. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the correlation box PL1 appearing in Theorem 3 is not any special local deterministic box: the result holds also for all the remaining 15 local deterministic boxes on suitable relabeling of the OR-AND wiring.\nWhile the studies in nonlocality distillation of quantum correlations are mostly limited to the 2-2-2 Bell scenario, Theorem 3 opens up an avenue to study the same in a general NM-K scenario that involves N spatially separated parties each performing M different measurements with K outcomes. It is not hard to find the extreme local boxes in such a general scenario. Now if for such an extreme box PL we obtain a wiring W such that W[PL,X] = X = W[X, PL] for any N-M-K no-signaling correlation X, then it results in a generalization of Theorem 3 in the N-M-K scenario. This consequently will imply that quantum correlations allowing nonlocality distillation have non-zero measure even in this general scenario.\nDistillation of post-quantum nonlocality.\u2013 We now proceed to show that OR-AND wiring also has an important proviso in ruling out (unphysical) post-quantum correlations. Several techniques are there to establish post-quantumness of a given correlations. For instance, isotropic no-signaling correlations yielding CHSH value more than 4 \u221a 2/3 violate the principle of nontrivial communication complexity [52] (see also [63\u2013 65]), thus demarcating such correlations as unphysical. Furthermore, any NS correlating with CHSH value more than Tsirelson bound violates the principle of information causality [53, 54]. It has also been shown that a correlation might not violate these principles by its own, but after distillation the resulting correlation violates such a principle, which, in turn, establish unphysicality of the original correlation [27] (see also [39]).\nInterestingly, the OR-AND wiring becomes useful to establish post-quantum nature of a correlation. Let us consider the following NS correlation\nHNS = 0.1 PNL + 0.85 PL1\n+ 0.01 (PL2 + PL3 + 2 PL4 + PL5), (9)\nwhich exhibits Hardy\u2019s nonlocality with success probability pHardy = 0.05. However, correlation H (8) NS obtained by distilling 8 copies of HNS has the Hardy success poptHardy = 0.15797, which ensures that the boxes H(8)NS and HNS are post-quantum. As it turns out the correlation HNS neither violates known necessary condition for respecting the principal of nontrivial communication complexity nor for the principle of information causality. However, the considered example violates the macroscopic locality principle [66] (see Supplemental). That being said, we do point out that checking membership to the NPA hierarchy can become computationally expensive, particularly at higher orders of the hierarchy, while the distillation criteria is far more tractable (see Supplemental).\nDiscussion.\u2013 Distillation, the process of extracting a desirable substance in pure form from a source of impure mixture through heating and other means, has an ancient history. Quite\n5 interestingly, during recent past, the idea finds novel applications in quantum information theory, where one aims to obtain fewer number of higher resourceful states starting with larger number of lesser resourceful states under free operations [67]. Some canonical examples are: (i) for our present study, the resource theory of Bell-nonlocal boxes [68, 69], or (ii) the well known protocols for quantum entanglement distillation, where many copies of mixed entangled states are distilled into pure form under local quantum operations and classical communications [70].\nIn this letter, we have established a generic approach for distillation of nonlocal correlations arising in quantum mechanics. This problem is of utmost importance as Bell nonlocal correlations are ubiquitous in device independent protocols \u2013 more the nonlocality more the utility. Interestingly, we come up with an elegant protocol, the OR-AND wiring, that distils nonlocality in quantum correlations with high efficiency. In the simplest bipartite scenario, in stark distinction with the results reported prior to our work [26\u201341], our protocol establishes that, within the set of full eight dimensional correlation space, the distillable quantum as well as nosignaling nonlocal correlations form subsets of non-zero measures; i.e., sector of open balls of a specified radius centered at local deterministic correlations. Moreover, by considering correlations arbitrarily close to local deterministic points, applying our protocol, with optimal number of copies, one can distill nonlocality by a significant amount both for the quantum as well as post-quantum non-signaling correlations. As for future, it would be interesting to explore the full potential of our generic framework proposed here in distilling quantum nonlocal correlations. In particular, obtaining some bound on the relative volume of the quantum correlations in the correlation space that can be distilled under OR-AND wiring would be interesting. Furthermore a generalization of this protocol for higher input-output as well as in multiparty scenario might be of great use.\nWe gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions and feedback from Guruprasad Kar, Giorgos Eftaxias, Roger Colbeck, Kieran Flatt and Joonwoo Bae at different stages of this work.

Consider the Bell-CHSH inequality defined in the main text of the paper, i.e.,\nB \u2261 \u27e800\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e801\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e810\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e811\u27e9 \u2264 2.

These boxes are given by,\nPNL \u2261 P110NL =  1 2 0 0 1 2 0 12 1 2 0\n0 12 1 2 0 0 12 1 2 0  ; PL1 \u2261 P0001L1 =  0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0  ; PL2 \u2261 P0100L2 =  0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0  ;\nPL3 \u2261 P0111L3 =  0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0  ; PL4 \u2261 P1101L4 =  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0  ; PL5 \u2261 P1111L5 =  0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0  ;\nPL6 \u2261 P1000L6 =  1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0  ; PL7 \u2261 P0010L7 =  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0  ; PL8 \u2261 P1010L8 =  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1  . In Theorem 1 we have showed that OR-AND protocol preserves the quantum Hardy structure and moreover it can distil non-local strength of Hardy correlations. Here, we analyse this theorem in detail.\nFirst we explicitly show that Hardy structure is preserved by the OR-AND wiring. For this, consider the quantum Hardy correlation\nHQ = c0PNL+ 5\u2211 i=1 ciPLi ; ci > 0 \u2200 i, and 5\u2211 i=0 ci = 1. (12)\nWith little algebra, it can be shown that OR-AND wiring applied to two copies of HQ results in a correlation\nH (2) Q =2 ((c0 2 + c1 )2 \u2212 c21 ) PNL + c 2 1PL1 + ( c0 ( 1\u2212 c0 2 ) + 2c2 ( 1\u2212 c2 2 ) \u2212 c0 (c1 + c2) ) PL2\n+ c3 (2\u2212 c0 \u2212 c3 \u2212 2c2) PL3 + c4 (c0 + 2c1 + c4) PL4 + c5 (c0 + 2c1 + 2c4 + c5) PL5 . (13)\nEq.(13) is clearly in the form Eq.(12) (i.e., both are convex mixture of same set of one nonlocal and five local boxes), and therefore the correlation resulting from wiring is a Hardy non-local correlation, establishing that OR-AND protocol preserves Hardy\n8 structure of quantum Hardy correlations. It is also clear from the expression that 2-copy OR-AND wiring distils nonlocality whenever c02 + 2c1 > 1.\nNow, let us turn to the distillability of quantum Hardy correlations under multi copy OR-AND wiring. In general, here we consider a two parameter family of quantum Hardy correlations which also includes the maximum quantum Hardy correlation used in Theorem 1. The family of such correlations is as follows,\nH (r,s) Q \u2261 xy/ab 00 01 10 11  00 (1\u2212r)r(1\u2212s)s1\u2212rs (1\u2212r)2s 1\u2212rs (1\u2212 r)(1\u2212 s) r 01 0 (1\u2212 r)s 1\u2212s1\u2212rs (1\u2212r)rs2 1\u2212rs 10 0 s (1\u2212r)(1\u2212s)1\u2212rs r(1\u2212s)2 1\u2212rs\n11 r(1\u2212s)s1\u2212rs (1\u2212r)s 1\u2212rs 1\u2212 s 0\n(14)\nwhere, r, s \u2208 [0, 1]. The measurements performed by Alice and Bob are given by\nAlice\u2019s measurements : {x0 \u2261 {|0\u27e9 \u27e80| , |1\u27e9 \u27e81|}, x1 \u2261 {|u0\u27e9 \u27e8u0| , |u1\u27e9 \u27e8u1|}} , (15a) Bob\u2019s measurements : {y0 = {|0\u27e9 \u27e80| , |1\u27e9 \u27e81|}, y1 = {|v0\u27e9 \u27e8v0| , |v1\u27e9 \u27e8v1|}} , (15b)\nwhere, the first term in the brackets corresponds to the outcome 0 and second term the outcome 1, and\n|u0\u27e9 := C\u03b1|0\u27e9+ e\u03b9\u03d5S\u03b1|1\u27e9, |u1\u27e9 := \u2212S\u03b1|0\u27e9+ e\u03b9\u03d5C\u03b1|1\u27e9, (16) |v0\u27e9 := C\u03b2 |0\u27e9+ e\u03b9\u03beS\u03b2 |1\u27e9, |v1\u27e9 := \u2212S\u03b2 |0\u27e9+ e\u03b9\u03beC\u03b2 |1\u27e9, (17)\nwith Cz := cos(z/2), Sz := sin(z/2) and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] & \u03d5, \u03be \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0).\nThe two-qubit state on which the measurements are performed, yielding the correlation (14), is given by\n|\u03c8\u27e9 Hardy\n:= |u0v0\u27e9+W\u03b1 |u1v0\u27e9+W\u03b2 |u0v1\u27e9\u221a\n1 +W2\u03b1 +W 2 \u03b2\n; Wz := cot(z/2) (18)\nwhere r := 1 \u2212 S2\u03b1S2\u03b2 and s := r\u22121C2\u03b1 [61]. It can be verified that maximal Hardy non-locality is achieved when r = s = 1 2 (\u221a 5\u2212 1 ) , resulting in Eq.(3) of the main text. Correlation H(r,s)Q can be distilled using OR-AND protocol if and only if\nr2(s+ s2)\u2212 r(s2 + 2s) + (2s\u2212 1) > 0. (19)\nFurthermore, it turns out that the region of distillability remains the same for the n-copy wiring. One can take a step further, and quantify the distillability of these correlations under the n-copy OR-AND protocol using distillation gap, defined as \u2206hsucc := p(N\nopt) Hardy \u2212 pHardy , where N opt is the optimal number of copies obtained from Proposition 1. The resulting variation of distillation gap with r and s is shown in Fig.2. The colored region in the density plot satisfies Eq.(19) and the distillation gap of a point is mapped by the color as indicated by the colorbar. The white point in the graph denotes the optimal distillation of approximately 0.0101896, obtained when 4 copies of the quantum correlation H(r,s)Q identified by r \u2248 0.1241 and s \u2248 0.8896 is used.\nInterestingly, as shown in the main text, much higher distillation gap can be obtained when one considers convex mixtures of the correlations given in Eq.(14) and PL1 . More strikingly, high amount of nonlocality can be distilled from mixtures with vanishingly small contribution from quantum Hardy correlations. For example, consider the correlation from Eq.(5) of the main text given by,\nH\u0303Q(\u03bb) := \u03bbH max Q + (1\u2212 \u03bb)P [1] L , \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1].\nThe Hardy success of this correlation is pHardy(\u03bb) = \u03bbk1 = \u03bb 2 (5\n\u221a 5 \u2212 11). Now, after using the n-copy OR-AND protocol, the\nresulting Hardy success is given by\np(n) Hardy (\u03bb) = (c0/2 + c1) n \u2212 cn1 =\n((\u221a 5\u2212 3 ) \u03bb+ 1 )n \u2212\n(\u221a 5\n2\n(\u221a 5\u2212 3 ) \u03bb+ 1 )n .\nNow, assuming very small \u03bb and Taylor expanding around \u03bb = 0, it turns out that the leading order term in the expression for optimal number of copies (see Proposition 1) is of the order \u03bb\u22121. Hence, for very small values of \u03bb, we can ignore the floor function arising in Nopt. Thus, we have the following for p(N\nopt) Hardy in the small \u03bb limit,\np(N opt)\nHardy (\u03bb) = 4(2+\n\u221a 5) 5(\u2212 5 2\u2212\n\u221a 5) (\u221a 5\u2212 2 ) \u2212 4(1+ \u221a 5) 5(\u22122\u2212 \u221a 5) (\u221a 5\u2212 3 ) log ( 5\n4\n) \u03bb+O ( \u03bb2 )\n\u2248 0.0410237 + 0.0165601\u03bb+O ( \u03bb2 )\n(20)\nEq.(20) tells that even as \u03bb approaches 0, corresponding to vanishingly small initial non-locality, the optimal use of the n-copy OR-AND can distil a high nonlocality of approximately 0.0410237. In fact, this increases linearly with \u03bb.\nIn the above, we have considered the mixture of optimal quantum Hardy correlation HmaxQ with PL1 . We can consider the same scenario for arbitrary H(r,s)Q . Then again, in the small \u03bb limit, one can follow similar steps to arrive at the following expression for the optimal Hardy success in the limit of vanishing \u03bb,\nlim \u03bb\u21920\np(N opt)\nHardy (r, s, \u03bb) =\n(1\u2212 r)r(1\u2212 s)s (\n1\u2212s+(1\u2212r)rs 1\u2212s+(1\u2212r)rs2 )(1\u2212 1(1\u2212r)rs\u2212 11\u2212s ) 1\u2212 s+ (1\u2212 r)rs . (21)\nA density plot of Eq.(21) is shown in Fig.3, where the distilled Hardy success of the point (r, s) is indicated by the color of the point. Moreover, one can find the optimal value of Eq.(21) to be approximately 0.0433049, attained when r = 12 and s = 2 3 .\n10\nThis is interesting, since it means that the mixture of a weakly non-local Hardy correlation with local noise can distil more nonlocality than a mixture with the optimal quantum nonlocal Hardy correlation and the same local noise. This again reveals the nontrivial structure of nonlocality distillation. Finally, note that despite the ability of the OR-AND protocol to distill high Hardy success from a mixture of H(r,s)Q and PL1 , one can numerically verify that the distilled success of this mixture is never greater than the distilled success of H(r,s)Q itself.\nAPPENDIX B: PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\nProof. Condition for n copy distillation demands that at least two copy distillation must be successful, i.e., n \u2265 2. This imposes the condition c1 > 12 \u2212 c0 2 (along with other conditions c0 \u2265 0, c1 \u2265 0, and c0 + c1 \u2264 1 on the coefficients c0 and c1 of\nthe respective boxes PNL and PL1 ). Let us consider a continues and smooth function f(x) = ( c0 2 + c1 )x \u2212 (c1)x obtained by substituting the number of copies n with a continuous variable x \u2208 [1,\u221e) in the expression for Hardy\u2019s success probability pn\nHardy = ( c02 + c1) n \u2212 cn1 . The derivative df(x) dx takes the value zero at exactly one point given by\nx\u2217 = log\n( log c1\nlog c02 + c1\n) / log ( c0 2 + c1\nc1\n) . (22)\nThen, one can conclude that the critical point x\u2217 is the point of global maxima of f(x) because due to at least two copy distillation condition f(x) must be an increasing function in the beginning, then it achieves the global maxima at x\u2217 and starts decreasing when x > x\u2217. Let us define N = \u230ax\u2217\u230b, then since f(x\u2217) \u2265 f(x) for all x \u2208 [1,\u221e) it easily follows that the optimal value of distilled Hardy success is given by popt\nHardy = max{p(N) Hardy , p(N+1) Hardy }. The optimal number of copies of initial boxes yielding\nmaximum distillation of Hardy success, i.e., Nopt is either N or N + 1; the one which gives maximum Hardy success. This completes the proof.\nAPPENDIX C: PROOF AND ANALYSIS OF THEOREM 2\nProof. Consider a one parameter family of quantum correlations given by\nB\u0303Q(\u03bb) := \u03bbB max Q + (1\u2212 \u03bb)PL1 , \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1], where, (23)\nBmaxQ := ( \u221a 2\u2212 1)PNL + 1\n4\n( 1\u2212 1\u221a\n2 ) 8\u2211 i=1 PLi .\nNote that the correlation BmaxQ saturates the Tsirelson\u2019s bound in Q. Manifestly, B\u0303Q(\u03bb) yields CHSH value B(\u03bb) = 2+(2 \u221a 2\u2212 2)\u03bb. After 2-copy OR-AND wiring the resulting correlation B\u0303(2)Q (\u03bb) attains CHSH value B(2)(\u03bb) = 2+2(2 \u221a 2\u22122)\u03bb+(11/4\u2212 3 \u221a 2)\u03bb2. Distillation is successful whenever \u03bb < 8167 (13 \u2212 \u221a 2) \u2248 0.555. While appropriate choice of \u03bb yields maximal Tsirelson gain (\u2248) 13.9% with 2-copy distillation of the correlation B\u0303Q(\u03bb), multi-copy OR-AND wirings can yield a maximal gain (\u2248) 39.75% and is obtained via distillation of parent correlation with arbitrary small value of \u03bb (see Supplemental).\nIn the proof to Theorem 2, we have showed that a mixture containing PL1 and arbitrarily small amount of B max Q can be distilled using the OR-AND protocol. Now, we numerically show that by using the optimal number of copies, we can distill to a high CHSH value of 2.32.\nFor this, first note that, given an arbitrary correlation P \u2261 {p(ab|xy)} the resulting correlation after n-copy OR-AND protocol is given by,\np(n)(00|xy) = (p(00|xy) + p(01|xy))n \u2212 p(01|xy)n, (24a) p(n)(01|xy) = p(01|xy)n, (24b) p(n)(11|xy) = (p(11|xy) + p(01|xy))n \u2212 p(01|xy)n, (24c) p(n)(10|xy) = 1\u2212 p(n)(00|xy)\u2212 p(n)(01|xy)\u2212 p(n)(11|xy). (24d)\nEq.(24) can be easily verified using mathematical induction starting from the 2-copy OR-AND protocol. Using Eq.(24), we arrive at the following expression for the distlled CHSH value (Bn(\u03bb)) of the correlation B\u0303Q(\u03bb) using the n-copy OR-AND\n11\nprotocol:\nB(n)(\u03bb) = 2\u2212 8 ( 1\u2212 \u03bb\n2\n)n + 12 ( 1\u2212 1\n8\n( 6\u2212 \u221a 2 ) \u03bb )n \u2212 4 ( 1\u2212 1\n8\n( 6 + \u221a 2 ) \u03bb )n . (25)\nEq.(25) can now be used to estimate the maximum CHSH value that can be distilled in the \u03bb \u2192 0 limit. However, this scenario is more difficult compared to Appendix:A since we do not have an analytical expression for the optimal number of copies for maximal distillation of the CHSH value.\nLet us start by considering a small value of \u03bb = 10\u22127 and studying the variation of the distilled CHSH value with the number of copies (see Fig.4). As seen from Fig.4, the distilled value for \u03bb = 10\u22127 initially increases with the number of copies, reaches a maximum of 2.32928 for 1.04739 \u00d7 107 copies and then decays to the classical value of 2. Note that the CHSH value drops below 2 before eventually saturating at 2. Moreover, Fig.4 shows that peak value does not change significantly as \u03bb is reduced to \u03bb = 1210 \u22127 or 1510 \u22127 and that overall behaviour is similar upto some re-scaling.\nThis suggests that the optimal number of copies is inversely proportional to \u03bb, in the small \u03bb limit. This motivates an ansatz for the optimal number of copies N opt = \u03b1\u03bb , for \u03b1 unknown. Since the derivative for B (n)(\u03bb) with n vanishes at the optimal number of copies, solving lim\u03bb\u21920 dB(n)(\u03bb)\ndn \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b1 \u03bb = 0 can be used to find \u03b1. This can in turn be done using Taylor expansion,\nyielding the value of \u03b1 = 1.047391. One can further numerically show that this ansatz is robust in the sense that for \u03bb < 10\u22125, dB(n)(\u03bb)\ndn \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b1 \u03bb < 10\u221211. Thus, using this ansatz, we can obtain the following expression for B(N opt)(\u03bb) when \u03bb < 10\u22125:\nB(Nopt)(\u03bb) \u2248 2.32928 + 0.169161\u03bb+O(\u03bb2). (26)\nThis proves the claim that as \u03bb\u2192 0, the AND-OR protocol can distil a large non-locality of approximately 2.32928.\nAPPENDIX D: EXTENDED PROOF OF THEOREM 3\nGiven two correlations \u03c71 \u2261 {p1(ab|xy} and \u03c72 \u2261 {p2(ab|xy} in NS , the resulting correlation obtained through OR-AND wiring is denoted as W[\u03c71, \u03c72] \u2261 {p(ab|xy}. The input-output joint probabilities for the resulting correlation reads as\np(00|xy) = \u2211\nb1\u2227b2=0\np1(0b1|xy)p2(0b2|xy); (27a)\np(01|xy) = p1(01|xy)p2(01|xy); (27b) p(11|xy) = \u2211\na1\u2228a2=1 p1(a11|xy)p2(a21|xy); (27c)\np(10|xy) = 1\u2212 p(00|xy)\u2212 p(01|xy)\u2212 p(11|xy); (27d)\nfor all x, y \u2208 {0, 1}. Now, let us consider two correlation C \u2261 {c(ab|xy)} \u2208 NS and PL1 = {pL1 (ab|xy) = \u03b4a,0 \u03b4b,1}. We denote W[C,PL1 ] \u2261 {pC,L1 (ab|xy)}, then on substituting the probabilities of the local box PL1 , above stated relations for two\n2\n\u221a\n2\u22122 \u00d7 100% \u2248 39.748%\n.\n12\nOR-AND wired boxes reduce to:\np C,L1 (00|xy) = c(00|xy); (28a) pC,L1 (01|xy) = c(01|xy); (28b) p\nC,L1 (10|xy) = c(10|xy); (28c)\np C,L1\n(11|xy) = c(11|xy); (28d)\nfor all x, y \u2208 {0, 1}. Therefore, W[C,PL1 ] = C. Similarly, by substituting the probabilities of the PL1 box it also easily follows that W[PL1 ,C] = C, and W[PL1 ,PL1 ] = PL1 .\nFurther, for obtaining a quantitative bound on the the radius of the eight-dimensional Ball centered at PL1 within which any nonlocal correlation, in a sector of nonzero-measure, allows 2-copy OR-AND distillation, we write the correlation C in terms of the coefficients of the PR-box and eight local boxes, then\nC = c0PNL + 8\u2211 i=1 ciPLi . (29)\nNow on calculating, the respective Bell-CHSH values K and K(2) of respective correlations C and C(2) we find that\nK = 2(1 + c0), (30) K(2) = 2 + c20 + 4c0(c1 + 2c4) + 8c4(c1 + c2 + c3 + c5 + c6 \u2212 1) + 8c24 \u2212 8c5c7. (31)\nIn the above we have used the normalization condition \u22118\ni=0 ci = 1 to eliminate the coefficient c8. Then the condition for two copy distillation can be written as follows:\n(K \u2212 2) + (K(2) \u2212 2K + 2) \u03bb > 0 =\u21d2 2 c0 + { c20 + 4c0(c1 + 2c4 \u2212 1) + 8 ( c4(c1 + c2 + c3 + c5 + c6 \u2212 1) + c24 \u2212 c5c7 )} \u03bb > 0\n\u2261 2 c0 + f(c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7) \u03bb > 0. (32)\nSince 2c0 + min{f(c0, c1, ..., c7)} > 0 =\u21d2 2c0 + f(c0, c1, ..., c7) > 0, two copy distillation is possible if 2c0 + min{f(c0, c1, ..., c7)} > 0. Further, min{f(c0, c1, ..., c7)} = \u22123 and it is achieved at c0 = 1 and c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = c5 = c6 = c7 = 0. Therefore, we obtain that for any NS correlation C\u0303(\u03bb), two copy distillation is successful if\n2c0 \u2212 3\u03bb > 0 \u21d2 \u03bb < 2\n3 c0. (33)\nThus we also have an analytical expression for the radius of the Ball centered at PL1 such that any nonlocal no-signaling correlation C\u0303(\u03bb), be it quantum or post-quantum, chosen from a nonzero-measure sector of the Ball can be distilled (in full eight dimensions).\nAPPENDIX E: POST-QUANTUM CERTIFICATION THROUGH OR-AND DISTILLATION\nIn the main manuscript we have already discussed that the correlation HNS given by,\nHNS = 0.1 PNL + 0.85 PL1 + 0.01 PL2 + 0.01 PL3 + 0.02 PL4 + 0.01 PL5 , (34)\n= xy/ab 00 01 10 11 \n00 0.05 0.85 0.01 0.09 01 0 0.90 0.08 0.02 10 0 0.93 0.06 0.01 11 0.01 0.92 0.07 0\n(35)\nis post quantum. While its Hardy success is 0.05, after OR-AND distillation the Hardy success gets increased. The optimal distillation is achieved for 8-copy parent correlation and the resulting child correlation reads as\nH (8) NS = 0.31594PNL + 0.27249 PL1 + 0.23246 PL2 + 0.04999 PL3 + 0.08275 PL4 + 0.0436 PL5 , (36)\n13\n= xy/ab 00 01 10 11 \n00 0.157977 0.272491 0.232454 0.337078 01 0 0.430467 0.486781 0.0827517 10 0 0.559582 0.390431 0.0499871 11 0.0463629 0.513219 0.440418 0\n(37)\nChild correlation H(8)NS having the Hardy success 0.157977, which is greater that optimal quantum bound (5 \u221a 5\u2212 11)/2 \u2248 0.09, this fact then establishes the post-quantum nature of the parent correlation HNS . Importantly, several other known post-quantum tests fail to detect post-quantumness of the correlation HNS . For instance,\ncorrelations having CHSH value more than 4 \u221a\n2/3 \u2248 3.26599 violate nontrivial communication complexity [52]. However, for the correlations HNS and H (8) NS the CHSH values turns out to be 2.2 and 2.63088, respectively, which are strictly less than the aforesaid threshold value 3.26599. The authors in [53] have obtained a sufficient criterion for violation of the information causality principle. For the CHSH symmetry considered in this work, the condition reads as\nI := E21 + E22 > 1, where Ei := 2Pi \u2212 1, with (38)\nP1 := 1\n2 [p(a\u2295 b = 0|00) + p(a\u2295 b = 1|10)], P2 :=\n1 2 [p(a\u2295 b = 1|01) + p(a\u2295 b = 1|11)]. (39)\nFor the correlations HNS and H (8) NS the values that I attain are respectively 0.9578 and 0.9565. Therefore information causality remains silent about the post-quantum nature of these boxes. However, it may be noted that correlation given in Eq.(34) falls outside the first level of the NPA-hierarchy [46]. This easily proves the post-quantumness of the correlation under consideration, and moreover, implies that the correlation violates the principle of macroscopic locality [66].\nThat being said, we do point out that checking membership to the different levels of NPA hierarchy can become computationally expensive, particularly at higher levels of the hierarchy, while the distillation criteria can be far more computationally tractable. For instance, let us consider the correlation:\nH\u2032NS = xy/ab 00 01 10 11 \n00 0.0773 0.0256 0.5599 0.3372 01 0 0.1029 0.7804 0.1167 10 0 0.3374 0.6372 0.0254 11 0.1178 0.2196 0.6626 0 . (40)\nOne may easily verify that correlation given in Eq.(40) is post-quantum by observing that after 2-copy distillation using ORAND protocol, the Hardy success goes up to 0.0925 (a value beyond the maximum possible success probaility in quantum mechanics). On the other hand, for the considered correlation, tests like known necessary conditions for violating non-trivial computational complexity and information causality principle fails to detect its post-quantumness. However, unlike the first example, on considering NPA criteria, a membership test into the second tier of the NPA hierarchy is required to establish the post-quantumness of this correlation. Along similar lines, one may imagine post-quantum correlations like Eq.(40) that lies at further deeper levels of the NPA-hierarchy, while its post-quantumness may be conveniently detected via efficient nonlocality distillation protocols."
