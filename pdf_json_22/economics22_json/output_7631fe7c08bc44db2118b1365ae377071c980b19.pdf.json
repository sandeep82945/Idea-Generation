Patients and Methods: The data envelopment method and Gini coefficient method were used to analyze the efficiency and regional fairness of fiscal medical and health expenditure results by using the relevant provincial and municipal data of China from 2007 to 2019. Results: 1.Overall, from 2007 to 2019, the total expenditure continued to increase, the expenditure efficiency increased first and then decreased, and the expenditure fairness continued to improve. 2. From the perspective of subregions, there are apparent differences between regions in terms of total expenditure, expenditure efficiency, and expenditure fairness, showing a better situation in the central, western, northeast and a lower situation in the east. Conclusion: The overall level of fiscal medical and health expenditure in China shows an upward trend, but there is still much room for improvement. At the same time, there are pronounced regional differences, and the problems of efficiency and fairness coexist among regions. Therefore, in the future, we should increase medical and health investment and enhance the government\u2019s close attention; Improve the expenditure performance appraisal system; Formulate policies according to local conditions and avoid \u201cone size fits all.\u201d.",

In particular, the fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee set shared prosperity as one of the long-term goals of national economic and social development by 2035. It equalized access to essential public services as an important part of achieving shared prosperity. Improving the level of medical and health services is a manifestation of the concept of putting the people first in governance and a necessary part of achieving shared prosperity. In China, state finance mainly supports and guarantees medical and health services. The level of government fiscal expenditure directly determines the level of medical and health services. Therefore, improving the level of medical and health services must increase the level of government expenditure in the medical and health benefits field. In addition, in October 2020, the CPC Central Committee\u2019s Proposal on the formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-term Goals of 2035 proposed establishing a stable public health investment mechanism. To develop a common public health investment mechanism, we need to have a reasonable understanding of the current situation and existing problems of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure. In particular, downward pressure on the world economy has been increasing and the growth rate of fiscal revenue of different countries has been declining with the outbreak of COVID-19. At the same time, to recover economic growth, the government will have to increase fiscal\nRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 1727\u20131740 1727 \u00a9 2022 Wang and Wang.

Therefore, in the context of slowing government revenue and increasing expenditure pressure, the government must use fiscal medical and health funds efficiently. To efficiently use fiscal medical and health funds, we need to correctly understand and analyze the current situation and problems of fiscal medical and health expenditure in China. We focus our research on China\u2019s provincial governments on estimating this problem since China has adopted a governance model of political centralization and economic decentralization. China\u2019s regional governments have assumed the function of providing public services directly to the people. Therefore, this study analyzes Chinese provincial governments\u2019 fiscal health expenditure data from 2007 to 2019 to provide policy suggestions for the government to formulate relevant policies. The difference between this paper and previous studies is that this paper studies the overall fiscal health expenditure in China rather than some parts of China. For example, Li Wang empirically analyzed the performance difference of public health expenditure in the context of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordination. It proposed that Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei should balance regional development, control the growth of the medical expenditure scale, and unify medical and health policies.1 Zhongming Liu studied the fiscal guarantee system and mechanism for equalizing essential public health services in Zhejiang Province and suggested improving the equalization level of important public health services in Zhejiang Province.2 The scope of this paper is the national level of China. In addition, the time of existing research data is short, the research conclusions are inconsistent, and the efficiency and fairness of fiscal medical and health expenditure results are not comprehensively analyzed. As in the medical and health care expenditure efficiency, Chunfang Li\u2019s data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is applied to evaluate the efficiency of the towns and townships, pointing out that the lower the overall efficiency of cities and townships.3 Zhongfang Zhang thinks local government fiscal health expenditure efficiency exists significant regional differences.4 Jingming Wei data based on the hospital, 11 counties of Zhejiang province medical were to evaluate the efficiency of the body; It is suggesting that to optimize the allocation of health resources, strengthen the infrastructure of primary medical institutions and improve the management level of county-level hospitals.5 Haixiang Xiao proposed that the reform and improvement of the fiscal decentralization system is a critical way to improve the efficiency of government fiscal medical and health expenditure.6 In terms of healthcare spending fairness, Zhong Wei thinks that China\u2019s public health investment lack right and suggested that under the condition of invariable in the public health budget, take measures to guide medical subsidies to rural areas.7 By analyzing the progress and fairness of implementing national basic public health service projects, Wang Fang suggested that we pay attention to project cost calculation, reasonably determine service projects, and innovate grass-roots public health service models.8 Jinping Pei pointed out that the regional differences in fiscal medical and health expenditure in China are prominent, and the regional differences in the eastern region are more pronounced than those in the central and western regions.9 Liankui Wen analyzed the period from 2003 to 2013 due to the implementation of the equalization policy of public health services and believed that the overall fairness of the inter-provincial government fiscal medical and health expenditures increased.10 Therefore, based on the above research, this paper analyzes from the perspectives of total expenditure and expenditure management. This article uses China\u2019s 2007\u20132019 provincial and municipal data to conduct research and analysis at the national level. This paper uses the data envelopment method and the Gini coefficient method to analyze the efficiency and regional fairness of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure results and puts forward relevant policy suggestions. Furthermore, this paper also provides experience and references for relevant academic research in other developing countries in the future.\nThe main innovations of this paper are as follows: 1. This paper makes a comprehensive analysis of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure. Compared with the existing literature, the conclusion is more accurate and complete, filling the gap in the current related research fields. 2. This paper constructs the expenditure efficiency index system according to the Chinese government revenue and expenditure classification. At the same time, this paper uses the relevant data of 30 provinces in China from 2007 to 2019 to evaluate the efficiency level of China\u2019s overall fiscal health expenditure results from the perspective of regional differences. Compared with the existing literature, the research data of this paper is new, the research time is long, and the research content and angle are more in line with China\u2019s reality. 3. This paper analyzes the regional fairness of fiscal medical and health expenditure results by using the manually collected data of fiscal medical and health expenditure of 286 prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2019. Compared with the existing literature, the research data in this paper are more accurate and unique, the research time is long, and the\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S377378 DovePress Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 1728\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nresearch content and angle are more in line with the actual situation in China. 4. This paper\u2019s research results will help to understand the current situation of China\u2019s fiscal health expenditure results and provide experience for other developing countries. The follow-up arrangement of this paper is as follows: In the background analysis part, this part evaluates China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019 from the perspective of total expenditure to draw the direction of further research on the evaluation of expenditure efficiency and the regional fairness of expenditure results. Research methods mainly explain the methods used in this study. In the part of research results, according to the existing research methods, this paper makes a detailed analysis of the efficiency level and regional fairness of China\u2019s fiscal health expenditure results. Discussion and policy recommendations, which put forward corresponding policy recommendations based on the above research conclusions."

            "text": "National Situation First, We can analyze the importance of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019 according to Table 1. China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenses accounted for less than 7% in terms of fiscal revenue and fiscal expenditure and less than 3% in economic aggregate. Because China\u2019s provincial governments still focus on economic development and do not pay enough attention to medical and health services. In addition, from the perspective of the proportion of fiscal medical and health expenditure in people\u2019s livelihood fiscal expenditure, China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure accounts for less than 1/3 of the people\u2019s livelihood fiscal expenditure, which is far lower than the expenditure on education and social security. At the same time, the US government spends 42% on health in the same three areas. It also verifies the previous explanation, indicating that the current Chinese government\u2019s emphasis on medical and health care is relatively insufficient.\nSecondly, we can analyze the growth trend of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019 according to Table 1. The overall proportion of total fiscal revenue and total fiscal expenditure of fiscal health expenditure from 2007 to 2019 shows an increasing trend year by year. It shows that the government has made some efforts to improve medical services. However, the overall economy and the proportion of people\u2019s livelihood fiscal\nNotes: This section uses data from 2007\u20132019 because of data availability and comparability. In 2007, the Chinese government reformed the caliber of fiscal expenditures. Before 2007, the Chinese government did not list fiscal medical and health expenditures separately but only arranged for science, education, culture, and health services. After the 2007 reform of fiscal expenditure caliber, the Chinese government officially listed fiscal medical and health expenditure separately. The data is as of 2019 because China\u2019s official statistical yearbook is only updated to 2020, and the 2020 statistical yearbook reflected the relevant situation in 2019.All the data in the above table comes from the 2008\u20132020 China Fiscal Yearbook and China Statistical Yearbook. According to relevant academic research, fiscal expenditure on people\u2019s livelihood mainly refers to fiscal expenditure on education, medical treatment, and social security.\nRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S377378 DovePress 1729\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nexpenditure have demonstrated the possibility of decline since 2017 because the global economic situation is still not optimistic in 2016. The GDP growth rate of China\u2019s major trading partners, such as the United States and Europe, has slowed to 1.6%. Affected by this, China is under increasing pressure on economic growth and people\u2019s employment. To promote economic growth and stabilize people\u2019s work, the relative importance of the government in the medical and health sector has shown a downward trend.\nRegional Conditions Proportion of Total Fiscal Revenue/Expenditure and GDP As shown in Tables 2\u20134, first, whether in the Eastern region, the Central region, the Western region, or the Northeast region, the overall trend is on the rise, but the overall proportion is not high. This situation is also because the current government is mainly concerned with economic development, and the emphasis on medical and health care needs to be improved. Secondly, the Central and Western regions are higher than the National average, and the Eastern and Northeast regions are lower than the national average. Because the eastern and northeastern areas have a good industrial base and system, they are more responsible for economic development in the national financial system. When faced with the pressure of an economic downturn, local governments in the region do their best to boost the economy, resulting in a relatively lower emphasis on medical and health services than in the Central and Western areas.\nProportion of Fiscal Expenditure for People\u2019s Livelihood As shown in Table 5, first, whether in the eastern region, the central region, the western region, or the northeastern region, the relative importance of the overall government needs to be improved, consistent with the general situation in the previous article. Secondly, since 2015, the proportion of the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions has shrunk, and the absolute value of the reduction in the eastern, central, and western areas is relatively high. It is mainly affected by two factors: the regional industrial structure.11 The industrial structure of the Northeast region is primarily based on heavy industry and agriculture, and its population and employment problems are relatively stable The industries in the eastern, central, and western regions are mainly service and manufacturing, which are greatly affected by the economic situation. Under the dual pressure of economic development and population employment, the relative importance of the governments of the eastern, central, and western regions to medical and health services has declined more significantly. The second is the aging of the regional population.12 The population aging problem in Northeast China is serious, and the proportion of\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S377378 DovePress Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 1730\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\npeople over 65 years old in Northeast China is 16.39% of the total population. This status quo makes the fiscal medical and health expenditure in the region rigid, so compared with the eastern, central, and western areas, the decline in the northeast region is more diminutive.\nBased on the above analysis, we can find regional differences in the Chinese government\u2019s medical and health expenditure. Therefore, in the subsequent analysis of the efficiency of expenditure results and the regional fairness of expenditure results, this paper analyzes from the perspective of regional differences."

            "text": "Efficiency Evaluation Method of Fiscal Medical and Health Expenditure Results At present, the academic circles mainly use two methods to evaluate efficiency: Data Envelopment Analysis13\u201323 and stochastic frontier analysis.24,25 Data envelopment analysis is the most widely used and applicable nonparametric test method. Compared with the stochastic frontier method, it does not need to set the function form or distribution hypothesis, so it can effectively reduce the model error. At the same time, data envelopment analysis can better analyze the efficiency of high-yield situations.24,25 In basic public services, data envelopment analysis has more advantages. Therefore, this paper uses the DEA model for evaluation.\nModel Setting DEA mainly includes two modes: CCR and BCC. CCR is an efficiency measurement method proposed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes26 under the assumption of constant return to scale. BCC is an efficiency evaluation method offered by Banker, Charnes, and Cooper27 under the premise of variable return to scale. Considering the scale effect of essential public service expenditure, we select the second one for analysis. The specific settings are as follows:\nAccording to the variable return to scale theory, we assume that there are H decision-making units (dumj; j \u00bc 1; 2; 3; \ufffd \ufffd \ufffdH), and each dum contains M inputs X and N outputs Y.

As a standard statistical analysis method, it can be used in the research of income distribution and is widely used in many social fields such as property, population, crime, race, education, medical treatment, and so on.32\u201335 Therefore, this paper uses the Gini coefficient to evaluate the fiscal medical and health expenditure results fairness.\nModel Setting This paper adopts the calculation formula of Gini coefficient of unequal grouping:36\nGk \u00bc 2\u2211N 1i\u00bc1 Wi\u00f01 Vi\u00de 1\u00fe\u2211 N i\u00bc1WiYi\nWhere, Gkrepresents Gini coefficient, K=Medical represents medical and health care respectively, N represents the number of prefecture level cities in each province, W is the proportion of the population of each prefecture level city in the total population of the province,Yi is the proportion of the fiscal medical and health care expenditure of each prefecture level city in the total fiscal medical and health care expenditure of the province, and Viis the cumulative count from i=1 to i.\nData Description The fiscal medical and health expenditure data in this paper are from the statistical yearbooks of local cities, provincial fiscal yearbooks (except Ningxia fiscal Yearbook), China Urban Statistical Yearbook, and the CEIC database. At the same time, limited by the availability of data, this paper can only use the relevant data of 286 prefecture-level cities in 25 provinces in China from 2007 to 2019. Finally, this paper can only measure the Gini coefficient values of 25 provinces except for Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Xizang, Qinghai, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan from 2007 to 2019."

            "text": "Analysis on the Result Efficiency of Fiscal Medical and Health Expenditure First of all, according to Table 7, we can get the relative size of the efficiency value of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019. The average efficiency of our country\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019 is 0.784, which shows that most provinces in China are relatively effective (Table 7). The average value in the eastern region is 0.746, which is lower than the National average (Table 7). The central area was 0.826, higher than the national average (Table 7). The western region was 0.768, slightly lower than the national average (Table 7). The northeast region was 0.884, higher than the national average (Table 7). The above results indicate that the current expenditure efficiency of provinces in China\u2019s eastern and western regions is poor. Cause the fact that there are more provinces with lower spending efficiency in the eastern and western regions (Table 8). The areas with low expenditure efficiency in the eastern region are mainly economically developed. It may be because the current fiscal medical and health expenditure is invested primarily in the wage expenditure of health technicians. Thus, the region\u2019s investment in essential public health facilities is relatively neglected. The areas with low expenditure efficiency in the western region\nTable 6 Input-Output Index System of Fiscal Medical and Health Expenditure\nInput Index Output Indicators Data Sources\nFiscal medical and health expenditure (10,000 yuan)\nNumber of medical and\nhealth\ninstitutions\nIncluding: number of hospitals, grass-roots medical and health institutions, professional public health institutions and other\nmedical and health institution\nChina Health Statistics Yearbook, China fiscal Yearbook and EPS\ndata platform\nNumber of\nhealth personnel\nThese include: health technicians, rural doctors and health workers, other technicians, managers and skilled workers\nNumber of beds in medical\ninstitutions\nIncluding: hospital beds, beds in primary medical and health institutions, beds in professional public health institutions and\nbeds in other medical and health institutions\nRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S377378 DovePress 1733\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nare mainly economically underdeveloped, possibly due to the inefficient use of local funds. As the economy of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Qinghai is relatively backward, there are many ethnic minorities in the region. The management concept is also relatively backward, so it is difficult for the local government to achieve adequate supervision of funds, leading to low utilization of local funds.\nSecondly, We can see the trend of the efficiency level of fiscal medical and health expenditure results from Figure 1. It showed a fluctuating upward trend from 2007 to 2014 (Figure 1). The whole country rose from 0.771 to 0.835, the eastern region from 0.683 to 0.791, the central region from 0.828 to 0.860, the western region from 0.793 to 0.829, and the northeast region from 0.870 to 0.955. Since the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China explicitly proposed strengthening medical and health services, local governments have significantly improved their expenditure efficiency. Especially with the proposal of the new medical reform policy in 2009, the expenditure efficiency of local governments has increased dramatically. It shows a downward trend from 2014 to 2019 (Figure 1). The whole country dropped from 0.835 to 0.732, the eastern region from 0.791 to 0.692, the central region from 0.860 to 0.779, the western region from 0.829 to 0.689, and the northeast region from 0.955 to 0.928. As the state relaxed the restrictions on private capital entering the medical and health field in 2013, public medical institutions decreased, and private institutions increased significantly. However, the overall fiscal resource allocation capacity has been reduced due to the lagging service capacity construction and low-scale efficiency of private medical institutions.\nAnalysis on the Results of Regional Fairness of Fiscal Medical and Health Expenditure First of all, according to Table 9, we can get the relative size of the regional fairness of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019. The average fairness of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure from 2007 to 2019 is 0.122 (Table 9), indicating that the overall fairness of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure results is good. By region, the average value of the Eastern region is 0.164, lower than the national average (Table 9). The central area is 0.097, higher than the national average (Table 9). The western region is 0.117, lower than the national average (Table 9). Northeast China is 0.092, lower than the national average (Table 9). The reasons for the common fairness of the results of fiscal medical and health expenditure in the eastern region are as follows: because the overall economic development in the eastern region is good, there is no central policy support. However, within the eastern area, there are significant differences in the level of economic development among provinces and prefecture-level cities, which leads to the poor regional fairness of the overall fiscal medical and health expenditure in the eastern region.

It shows that the gap between China\u2019s per capita fiscal medical and health expenditure is gradually narrowing. Especially after the decision of the CPC Central Committee on several significant issues of building a socialist harmonious society in 2006. They proposed to form progressively an essential public service system benefiting the whole people; therefore, the fairness of China\u2019s fiscal medical and health expenditure has been significantly improved.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S377378 DovePress Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 1736\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

            "text": "Before we start the discussion, we should make some explanations. Our assessment results are limited to the efficiency level of government input and output and the regional fairness of the information and do not involve social benefits and other issues. Based on this premise, we assume that we will discuss and analyze further. First, China\u2019s total fiscal expenditure on medical and health care is still insufficient, with significant room for improvement. Especially in the context of the increasing aging of the population, constantly improving the total level of medical and health expenditure is an inevitable measure to meet the growing needs of the people. Second, the government does not pay enough attention to medical and health care, which needs further strengthening. Especially under the long-term impact of COVID-19 in the future, the government should continue to pay more attention to the medical and health care field. Third, the overall efficiency of expenditure results is low, with significant differences among regions. The expenditure efficiency of the eastern region is lower than that of the central, western, and northeast regions. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies. The specific reasons are as follows: due to the western development, the rise of the central region, and the implementation of the Northeast Revitalization Strategy, the health resources, and management of the central, western, and northeast regions have been improved, which is higher than the expenditure efficiency of the eastern region. At the same time, due to the developed economy, the eastern region attracts more foreign populations, which leads to the crowding of medical resources. Finally, it leads to a decline in expenditure efficiency. Fourth, expenditure efficiency showed an upward trend from 2007 to 2014 and a downward trend from 2014 to 2019. This phenomenon may be because the state relaxed the restrictions on private capital entering the medical and health field in 2013. However, due to the imperfect system and supporting policies, public hospitals decreased significantly, and private hospitals increased significantly. At the same time, due to the problems of lagging service and low-scale efficiency of private hospitals, the overall resource allocation ability decreased. Fifth, the overall fairness of expenditure results is good and shows a downward trend, but it is the same as expenditure efficiency in terms of regional differences. The fairness of expenditure in the eastern region is lower than that in the\nRisk Management and Healthcare Policy 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S377378 DovePress 1737\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ncentral, western, and northeast regions. Because of the western development, the central area\u2019s rise, and the implementation of the Northeast Revitalization Strategy have improved and balanced the finance of the central, western, and northeast regions, which is higher than the expenditure fairness of the eastern region. As the eastern region is relatively developed, there is no central policy support. However, the economic development level of each area in the eastern region is not the same, so the fiscal resources of each local government are not consistent, and the internal gap is large, so the expenditure fairness of the eastern region is low. Based on the above, this paper puts forward the following policy suggestions:\nIncrease Medical and Health Investment and Enhance the Relative Attention of the Government Although the economic pressure caused by COVID-19 is relatively severe, the government should realize that continuously focusing on attention and increasing the investment in medical and health care can alleviate the impact of COVID-19. Therefore, we can improve people\u2019s confidence fundamentally, enhance the economy\u2019s reasonable expectations, and finally achieve economic recovery. Changing the government\u2019s expenditure structure and increasing the government\u2019s investment and relative attention can effectively reduce the negative social impact caused by the epidemic, alleviate people\u2019s anxiety, and enhance people\u2019s trust in the government. In addition, the government should play a fundraising role. The government should promote the cooperation between the government and social capital through flexible use of \u201cPPP\u201d, medical bonds, preferential policies, interest subsidies, and other means. The government promotes the continuous development of the medical and health field by driving more social funds into the medical and health field to satisfy the growing medical and health needs of the people.\nImprove the Expenditure Performance Appraisal System The feedback mechanism of performance appraisal is not perfect, and performance results do not play a substantial role in allocating government funds. Therefore, firstly, the government should strengthen the construction of the performance appraisal system and improve the operability of performance appraisal. Secondly, the government should improve the accountability mechanism and incorporate performance appraisal results into cadre appraisal. Thirdly, the government should consummate the social think tank system and strengthen the supervision of third-party forces. Fourthly, the government should improve the performance appraisal information management system. By supporting the real-time performance results and feedback, the performance fund can be timely and accurate supervision and management.\nRegional Issues Cannot Be Cut Across the Board According to this study, we can find that there are significant differences between regions in China. Therefore, when formulating relevant policies, each area should study the corresponding countermeasures according to its conditions and conditions. Based on the analysis of the self situation, learn from the excellent experience at home and abroad, improve the problems existing in expenditure efficiency and expenditure fairness, realize regional coordinated development, and improve China\u2019s medical and health service level."
