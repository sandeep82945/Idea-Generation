    "abstractText": "Purpose The study compared the efficacy of commencing supervised exercise in men with prostate cancer before and after prostatectomy on objective and patient-reported outcomes, hospital length of stay, and urinary incontinence. Methods Forty-one men were randomised to a 6-week prehabilitation or rehabilitation exercise programme. Prehabilitation involved resistance and aerobic exercise thrice weekly pre-surgery, while rehabilitation comprised the same commencing 6-weeks post-surgery. Assessments included strength, function (chair rise, stair climb, 400-m, 6-m usual, fast, and backwards walk), body composition, fatigue and quality of life, undertaken at pre-surgery, early post-surgery and late post-surgery phase, with urinary incontinence (24-h pad test) assessed at 2, 6, and 12-weeks post-surgery. Intention-to-treat and sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Results Of thirty-eight men (48\u201373 years), 29 completed all assessments with most undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (92.1%). In the pre-surgery phase, prehabilitation improved muscle strength (leg press: 17.2 kg; chest press: 2.9 kg; p \u2264 0.001), 400-m, chair rise, 6-m fast and backward walk tests (p \u2264 0.001\u20130.028). Strength and function declines in the early post-surgery phase were maintained late post-surgery. Rehabilitation showed declines of these outcomes after surgery with improvement late post-surgery (leg press: 14.6 kg, p < 0.001; chest press: 6.8 kg, p < 0.001; 400-m walk: -12.0 s, p = 0.005), resulting in no difference between groups at 12 weeks. There were no significant differences between groups for patient-reported outcomes, hospital length of stay or urinary incontinence. Conclusion Pre-surgical exercise enhanced strength and function, protecting against post-surgery declines. Although exercise post-surgery is beneficial for recouping strength and function, where possible men undergoing prostatectomy are encouraged to exercise pre-surgery.

            "text": "Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in men in Western countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Australia (AIHW 2022; Siegel et\u00a0al. 2022). Prostatectomy, the main treatment for localised disease, results in various adverse effects such as incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and reduced physical function which impacts quality of life (QoL) (Gacci et\u00a0al. 2009, 2023). Exercise can improve physical function, QoL and alleviate adverse effects such as fatigue as a result of prostatectomy (Singh et\u00a0al. 2017b; Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2018), androgen deprivation therapy (Galv\u00e3o et\u00a0al. 2010) and radiation therapy (Schumacher et\u00a0al. 2021). However, the timing of exercise intervention is still a matter of debate in the setting of prostatectomy. Researchers have examined the effect of specific interventions before or following surgery in prostate cancer patients (Singh et\u00a0al. 2017b; Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2018; Blackwell et\u00a0al. 2020; Baumann et\u00a0al. 2022), with only two randomised controlled trials (Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2018; Blackwell et\u00a0al. 2020) of structured exercise before prostatectomy. In these studies, home-based exercise (Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2018) and supervised high-intensity interval training (Blackwell et\u00a0al. 2020) were feasible and led to improvements in physical function, psychological distress, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood pressure, without any exercise-related adverse effects. In contrast, rehabilitation programmes following prostatectomy primarily focus on physiotherapy-led interventions particularly pelvic floor muscle training, although the efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training remains inconsistent (Baumann et\u00a0al. 2022). Additionally, this intervention does not target the expected declines in body composition, physical capacity and QoL following surgery (Strassels et\u00a0al. 2004).\nAlthough we (Singh et\u00a0al. 2017b) and others (Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2018; Blackwell et\u00a0al. 2020) have demonstrated the potential of prehabilitative exercise in men with prostate cancer, it remains unclear whether commencing exercise before surgery, when patients are generally in better physical condition, would be superior to postoperative rehabilitation in terms of objective and patient-reported outcomes, hospital length of stay (LOS) and urinary incontinence. It may well be that initiating exercise before prostatectomy may mitigate surgery-related declines in physical function and QoL, considering that patients generally have better physical condition compared to the early postoperative period, as observed in a study conducted in patients with colorectal cancer (Gillis et\u00a0al. 2014). As a result, we extend our previous work by asking, is it more efficacious to exercise the patient before surgery rather than rehabilitating the patient after prostatectomy?"

Inclusion criteria included: histologically documented localised prostate cancer; minimum 7\u00a0weeks between baseline assessment and surgery for assessments and 6-weeks of exercise; and no acute illness, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological disorder that would prevent patients from exercising as determined by their physician. Of these 46 patients, one was excluded due to bone metastasis diagnosis, two declined participation citing work/travel difficulties and two others were uninterested, resulting in 41 eligible patients. All patients obtained medical clearance and completed a health history questionnaire. Following randomisation (Prehabilitation, n = 20; Rehabilitation, n = 21), three prehabilitation participants withdrew before baseline assessments due to surgery date change (n = 2) and treatment change to radiation (n = 1), resulting in a study cohort of 38 patients. The study was approved by the Edith\u00a0Cowan\u00a0University Human Research Ethics Committee and the South Metropolitan Health Service, and all participants provided written informed consent."

Patients were randomly assigned using a computer random assignment programme to either group stratified for physical activity level (i.e., cut-off value of 150\u00a0min/week). Allocation was concealed using sealed opaque envelopes. Following familiarisation and baseline assessment, prehabilitation comprised combined resistance and aerobic exercise for 6\u00a0weeks pre-surgery with no formal intervention post-surgery, whilst rehabilitation exercise commenced 6\u00a0weeks post-surgery. All patients were instructed to rest and not exercise for at least 6\u00a0weeks after surgery to allow for recovery. Measurements were undertaken at baseline, pre-surgery, 6 and 12\u00a0weeks post-surgery. Quality of life and fatigue were additionally assessed at 2\u00a0weeks post-surgery, while urinary incontinence was assessed at 2, 6, and 12\u00a0weeks post-surgery. In this report, the time between baseline to pre-surgery is defined as the pre-surgery phase, the period from discharge to 6\u00a0weeks post-surgery as the early post-surgery phase, and between 6 and 12\u00a0weeks post-surgery as the late post-surgery phase (Figure S1).\n1 3"

Physical function was assessed using a battery of tests that included the repeated chair rise, stair climb, 400-m walk, and usual, fast and backward 6-m walk (Galv\u00e3o et\u00a0al. 2006). All tests were performed in triplicate except the 400-m walk which was performed once. Whole-body lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM), trunk fat mass, and body fat percentage were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic Discovery, Waltham, MA, USA). Quality of life was assessed using the global health domain, while fatigue was assessed using the fatigue subscale from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) (Aaronson et\u00a0al. 1993). Urinary incontinence was measured using the 24-h pad test calculated using the weight of urine loss (used\u2014pre-weighed) at all time points post-surgery, and hospital LOS was assessed from medical records."

(Faul et\u00a0al. 2009). To account for an attrition rate of up to 30%, the goal was to recruit 21 patients per group.\nData were analysed using IBM SPSS version 27 (SPSS Inc., IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Normality of the\ndistribution for outcome measures was evaluated using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Differences in baseline characteristics between groups were assessed using independent t-tests or the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, as appropriate, for continuous data and chi-square for categorical data. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, with sensitivity analyses undertaken to ensure data robustness using complete cases approach (Thabane et\u00a0al. 2013). Generalised estimating equations (GEE) were used to compare groups over time for the primary and secondary outcomes with follow-up tests undertaken if there was a significant group x time interaction or time effect. Results are presented as the mean and standard error (SE), median and interquartile range (IQR), and mean difference and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

Most patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (92.1%).\nThree patients in prehabilitation and six from rehabilitation withdrew following baseline measurements preferring not to be in the rehabilitation group (n = 5), opting for radiation treatment (n = 1), diagnosis of brain cancer (n = 1), running injury not related to the exercise programme (n = 1), and medical complications after surgery (n = 1) (Fig.\u00a01). Patients in prehabilitation attended 73.7% of scheduled exercise sessions while those in rehabilitation attended 93.7% of scheduled sessions. The prehabilitation group's lower attendance was attributed to patients attending medical appointments in relation to surgery. There were no exercise-related adverse events."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In this study, we compared prehabilitation and rehabilitation supervised exercise in the setting of prostatectomy. There were three main findings. First, 6\u00a0weeks of supervised exercise before prostatectomy enhanced muscle strength, physical function at pre-surgery and at 6\u00a0weeks post-surgery despite reductions in lean mass so that even though these patients were in the postsurgical recovery period, their physical performance was comparable to or better than prior\nto surgery when compared to rehabilitation. In addition, improvements in strength and function were accompanied by reduced fatigue prior to surgery. Second, for those initiating exercise post-surgery, supervised exercise helped recoup losses and enhance muscle strength and physical function. Third, both groups experienced comparable resolution in urinary incontinence with similar hospital LOS.\nWe demonstrated that commencing exercise 6\u00a0weeks before surgery substantially improved muscle strength and physical function, which may act to buffer the effects of surgery. As a result of the patient\u2019s improved reserve capacity, declines that do occur in strength and function do not typically result in the patient falling below their pre-exercise levels. In addition, we observed a reduction in fatigue levels in those who exercised before surgery. These findings support previous research in the prehabilitation setting (Singh et\u00a0al. 2017b; Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2018; Blackwell et\u00a0al. 2020) and highlight the importance of implementing exercise therapy early after a prostate cancer diagnosis to minimise musculoskeletal effects from prostatectomy (Strassels et\u00a0al. 2004). Exercising at an early stage before surgery provides an opportune time to intervene and takes advantage of surgical wait times when patients are in a better condition to exercise compared to the early post-operative period (Santa Mina et\u00a0al. 2015).\nThe rehabilitation programme also showed important benefits for patients who are unable to engage in exercise before surgery due to numerous medical appointments and commitments or the short time between diagnosis and prostatectomy (e.g., the urgency of the prostate cancer condition and surgeon availability). Exercise that commenced after this initial period, with rehabilitative intent, is also beneficial to recoup losses and enhance muscle strength and physical function while maintaining or improving QoL. These findings are clinically important as increasing physical reserve\n1 3\ncapacity is associated with reduced risk of postoperative complications and all-cause mortality in cancer patients (Ezzatvar et\u00a0al. 2021).\nAlthough improvements in both muscle strength and physical function resulted from the training program in both groups, there was an absence of improvement in whole body LM. Consequently, improvements in strength and function are likely attributable to neural adaptations to exercise (Carli and Zavorsky 2005). From pre-surgery to 6\u00a0weeks post-surgery, the decrease in whole-body LM for both groups could be attributed to bed rest, physical inactivity and possibly dietary changes (Dirks et\u00a0al. 2016), although these were not tracked in our study. Despite having a structured and supervised exercise program, a 6-week program may be insufficient to induce substantial increases in lean mass and reductions in fat mass (Singh et\u00a0al. 2017b). Nevertheless, a combined resistance and aerobic exercise programme is still a positive step towards incorporating non-surgical and non-pharmaceutical therapies within a patient treatment plan to improve long-term health outcomes and prevent adverse effects (Bodai et\u00a0al. 2018). A comprehensive prehabilitative approach, including nutrition and psychological support interventions (Molenaar et\u00a0al. 2019), should be considered to prevent chronic inflammation (Pedersen and Febbraio 2012), reduce cardiovascular disease risk (Chen et\u00a0al. 2019), and alleviate cancer-related fatigue (Newton et\u00a0al. 2018) throughout the prostate cancer care continuum. In our study, pre-surgery exercise was associated with a reduction in fatigue of 6.5 points, meeting the MID reported for the EORTC QLQC30 (Nordin et\u00a0al. 2016). This result is clinically important as it provides guidelines for pre-surgical exercise prescriptions to ameliorate cancer-related fatigue. As expected, fatigue increased in the immediate post-surgical period in both groups but gradually resolved towards baseline levels at 6- and 12-weeks post-surgery. Commencing exercise early and maintaining exercise for extended periods, even after prostatectomy, may be crucial to preserve or enhance body composition (Lopez et\u00a0al. 2022) and improve fatigue.\nThe evidence regarding prehabilitative exercise for reducing post-operative urinary incontinence is conflicting in patients with prostate cancer (Xiangyun et\u00a0al. 2022). In a meta-analysis that included 14 studies, the researchers concluded that preoperative pelvic floor muscle training did not significantly reduce urinary incontinence rate at 1, 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months after surgery (Xiangyun et\u00a0al. 2022). Additionally, evidence was inconclusive for studies undertaken in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (Xiangyun et\u00a0al. 2022), which was the predominant surgical technique in our study. Indeed, our findings are that prehabilitative exercise, including resistance, aerobic and trunk-specific exercises, did not effectively reduce post-surgery urinary incontinence. This may be explained by the quality, effectiveness, and less invasive\napproach of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, including less blood loss and pain, and faster recovery. Moreover, this surgical approach is already associated with shorter hospital stays, which may explain the lack of difference between groups on hospital LOS after prostatectomy.\nThe strengths of this study include a comprehensive clinic-based exercise programme with supervision, a high attendance rate, a battery of physical function and muscle strength assessments, and use of DXA for body composition. Nevertheless, there are limitations worthy of comment. Most participants underwent a less invasive surgical technique, which may have limited our ability to observe the effects of exercise on urinary incontinence and hospital LOS. Additionally, the study participants may not represent all prostate cancer patients undergoing surgery, as they agreed to participate in an exercise intervention during a challenging period. Lastly, the study did not have a long-term followup to assess the persistence of exercise over time, such as 6\u00a0months or longer. Nevertheless, we found that a relatively brief programme of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise undertaken either before or after prostatectomy can be safely undertaken and results in improvements in muscle strength and physical function. The time period between diagnosis and surgery, despite being a relatively short time frame, provides a window of opportunity to introduce targeted exercise programmes.\nIn conclusion, exercise before prostatectomy enhances muscle strength and physical function, and reduces fatigue in patients with prostate cancer. If exercise before surgery is not possible, starting supervised exercise after prostatectomy may recoup losses and enhance muscle strength, physical function and potentially body composition while maintaining QoL. It may well be that exercising both before and after surgery may provide the most significant physical enhancement. Clinicians should encourage patients to engage in exercise either before or as soon as possible after the acute post-operative phase to assist with their recovery.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00432- 023- 05409-3.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge all the participants who despite their difficult schedules provided the time to participate and contribute to this study.
