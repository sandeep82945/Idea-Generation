    "abstractText": "UltraLight Dark Matter (ULDM) is an axion-like dark matter candidate with an extremely small particle mass. ULDM halos consist of a spherically symmetric solitonic core and an NFW-like skirt. We simulate halo creation via soliton mergers and use these results to explore the core-halo mass relation. We calculate the eigenstates of the merged halos and use these to isolate the solitonic core and calculate its relative contribution to the halo mass. We compare this approach to using a fitting function to isolate the core and find a difference in masses up to 8.2%. We analyze three families of simulations\u2014equal-mass mergers, unequal mass mergers, and halos with a two-step merger history. Setting the halo mass to the initial mass in the simulation does not yield a consistent core-halo relationship. Excluding material \u201cejected\u201d by the collision yields a core-halo relationship with a slope of 1/3 for simultaneous mergers and roughly 0.4 for two-step mergers. Our findings suggest there is no universal core-halo mass relationship for ULDM and shed light on the differing results for the core-halo relationship previously reported in the literature.",

ULDM halos consist of a spherically symmetric solitonic core and an NFW-like skirt. We simulate halo creation via soliton mergers and use these results to explore the core-halo mass relation. We calculate the eigenstates of the merged halos and use these to isolate the solitonic core and calculate its relative contribution to the halo mass. We compare this approach to using a fitting function to isolate the core and find a difference in masses up to 8.2%. We analyze three families of simulations\u2014equal-mass mergers, unequal mass mergers, and halos with a two-step merger history. Setting the halo mass to the initial mass in the simulation does not yield a consistent core-halo relationship. Excluding material \u201cejected\u201d by the collision yields a core-halo relationship with a slope of 1/3 for simultaneous mergers and roughly 0.4 for two-step mergers. Our findings suggest there is no universal core-halo mass relationship for ULDM and shed light on the differing results for the core-halo relationship previously reported in the literature.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe development of accessible and accurate cosmological simulations has revolutionized the way we visualize the imprint of dark matter on observational data [1]. While simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) can accurately reproduce large-scale cosmological structures a number of apparent discrepancies arise on kiloparsec (kpc) scales [2]. One such small-scale discrepancy and the motivation for this work, the core-cusp problem, arises from differences between computationally predicted dark matter density profiles and profiles deduced from rotation curves of dwarf galaxies [3\u20135]. CDM-only simulations predict a \u201ccuspy\u201d internal profile [6] while observations tend to favour a flatter central core [7, 8]. Additional small-scale problems include observations of fewer satellite dwarf galaxies than simulations suggest (the missing satellites problem) [9, 10], an overabundance of isolated dwarfs [11], and CDM predictions of massive subhalos which are too dense not to host more bright satellites than are observed (the too big to fail problem) [12].\nThe core-cusp problem is ameliorated but not necessarily solved when baryons are added to CDM simulations [13\u201315]. Consequently, it is possible that part of this tension is due to nontrivial properties of the dark matter itself. One such example is UltraLight Dark Matter1 (ULDM), an axion-like particle with a mass of order 10\u221222 eV. The corresponding de Broglie wavelength for the ULDM particle is on kiloparsec scales, so wavelike\n\u2217 lzagorac@pitp.ca \u2020 eken000@aucklanduni.ac.nz \u2021 nikhil.padmanabhan@yale.edu \u00a7 r.easther@auckland.ac.nz 1 This model is also known as fuzzy dark matter, scalar-field dark\nmatter, \u03a8 dark matter, or BECDM. See Ref. [16] for a recent review of nomenclature subtleties.\neffects can be manifest at sub-galactic scales. In particular, quantum pressure prevents the formation of a cuspy central halo, instead supporting a Bose-Einstein condensate core with a solitonic density profile [17]. Simulations demonstrate that the outer regions of ULDM halos resemble the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile of CDM [6], such that above kiloparsec scales the two models are mutually consistent [18, 19]. A general review of ULDM physics can be found in Ref. [20], while more recent reviews of theoretical frameworks and observational signatures can be found in Refs. [16, 21].\nDubbed the core-halo relation, the ratio of the mass of the core to the overall halo is key to many observational tests of ULDM. It is expected to depend on the mass of the constituent particle and the halo mass and, despite a number of analyses, disagreement persists over the specific scaling [22\u201327]. We seek to reconcile these disparate results and add a more quantitative perspective by decomposing our ULDM halos into eigenstates, via the formalism we developed in Ref. [28].\nOur halos are formed through collisions of ULDM solitons; we arrange the solitons in symmetric initial configurations and use the pseudo-spectral code, chplUltra [29], to follow their evolution. These idealized scenarios highlight the dependence of the core-halo relationship on merger history, which will be key to mapping it to realistic astrophysical settings with hierarchical structure formation [30\u201332]. We find that the apparent corehalo relationship can be impacted by numerical boundary conditions and the details of parameter definitions. Consequently, we can contextualize many of the results seen in previous work and we see that the eigenvalue decomposition reduces scatter in the fits relative to profilematching techniques. The overall outcome of our work suggests that we cannot find a universal core-halo relationship that is fully independent of the process by which the halo is assembled.

            "text": "In the non-relativistic regime, ULDM can be described by a macroscopic wavefunction evolving under the influence of its own self-gravity. The dynamics are then governed by the Schro\u0308dinger-Poisson system of equations:\ni~ \u2202\u03c8 \u2202t = \u2212 ~ 2 2m \u22072\u03c8 +ma\u03a6\u03c8 (1)\n\u22072\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Gm|\u03c8|2, (2)\nwhere \u03c8 is the wavefunction of the dark matter, \u03a6 is the gravitational potential, and m is the mass of the constituent particle. As the ULDM field configuration is described by a single wavefunction \u03c8, the dark matter density traces the quantum mechanical probability distribution and is defined as \u03c1 = m|\u03c8|2. The ground state of the Schro\u0308dinger-Poisson system is called a soliton.\nSeveral methods of constructing generic ULDM halos can be found in the literature: collisions of multiple solitons [23\u201325, 33, 34] spherical or elliptical collapse [35], and cosmological simulations utilizing a Schro\u0308dingerPoisson solver [22, 36, 37]. A fourth method [38, 39] uses the Widrow-Kaiser function [40] to build up a halo out of eigenmodes.\nWe can define three pertinent initial energies in the system: the classical kinetic energy K, the quantum energy Q, and the gravitational potential energy V . The three components are defined as follows [20, 25]:\nK = 1\n2\n\u222b dr \u03c1 v2 (3)\nQ = 1\n2\n\u222b dr| \u2207\u221a\u03c1|2 (4)\nV = 1\n2\n\u222b dr \u03c1\u03a6 (5)\nWe create halos by coliding solitons.2 If the solitons are initially non-overlapping, the kinetic term reduces to\n2 Such a halo is somewhat \u201csynthetic\u201d, insofar as it is not produced through spherical collapse of overdensities in a cosmological code.\nthe familiar K = \u03a3 12Miv 2 i , where Mi and vi are the mass and velocity of the ith soliton, respectively. The quantum energy Q corresponds to the quantum pressure term which stabilizes each soliton in the absence of an internal velocity dispersion. Finally, the gravitational potential energy V includes both self-gravitation and inter-soliton gravitational interactions, but is dominated by the former.3 Changing the distance between solitons thus only negligibly impacts the potential energy while changing their mass has a larger impact. For this reason, we only vary the initial masses and number of colliding solitons rather than their relative distances. Furthermore, we always start the solitons at rest. This is because we are only interested in gravitationally bound mergers where a final halo is formed, in which case adding initial velocities is physically equivalent to initializing the solitons farther away at some earlier time.\nULDM haloes consist of a solitonic core and an NFW skirt. The radial density of such a halo can be parametrized as\n\u03c1(r) = { \u03c1sol(r), 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r\u03b1 \u03c1NFW(r), r\u03b1 \u2264 r \u2264 rvir\n(6)\nwhere r\u03b1 is the transition radius between the soliton and the skirt. The exact value of the transition radius varies in previous work (see e.g. [22, 27, 39]), but is usually taken to be a few times the full width half maximum of the core, and our analysis does not depend on it at any point. The virial radius of the NFW skirt is rvir. Note that, while a pure soliton is an eigenstate of the Schro\u0308dinger-Poisson system, a composite ULDM halo is not.\nIn order to effectively track the evolution of the solitonic core in a halo, we first calculate the eigenstates of the Schro\u0308dinger-Poisson system. We begin by verifying that the potential \u03a6 of the halo is approximately constant in time after the merger completes. This suggests the following approximation for the Schro\u0308dinger equation:\n\u2212i \u2202 \u2202t \u03c8 =\n[ \u22121\n2 \u22072 + \u3008\u03a6\u3009\n] \u03c8 (7)\nwhere \u3008\u03a6\u3009 is a time-averaged potential and we have set ma = ~ = G = c = 1 for simplicity. This approximation allows us to solve for the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the system for a given \u3008\u03a6\u3009; our choices for the time-averaged potentials are discussed below. For a detailed discussion of the construction of the eigenstates, see Refs. [28, 43].\n3 We do not consider non-gravitational self-interactions, though such models exist. For more on these, see e.g. Refs. [41, 42].\n3"

[22] first suggested a relation of the form Mc \u221d (|E|/M)1/2, where the authors arrived at the \u03b1 = 1/2 result by analyzing their simulations. Their argument for the relation was as follows: the system specific energy |E|/M represents the velocity dispersion of the halo \u03c3h, and the core mass Mc is inversely proportional to the core\u2019s size, rc. We can then relate these two quantities via the uncertainty principle, rc \u03c3h \u223c 1. Finally, we can\ndivide both sides by the halo mass M to arrive at a unitless version of the relationship, which subsequent papers continued using.\nWhile Ref. [44] was later able to reproduce \u03b1 = 1/2 using an effective thermodynamic model, the exact scaling has been the topic of much debate. Ref. [18] found 1/6 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1/4 for equal-mass soliton binary mergers and \u03b1 = 1/2 for unequal-mass soliton binary mergers. Ref. [25] found \u03b1 = 1/3 in mergers of many solitons of different masses and initial conditions. Using a slightly different approach, Ref. [24] considered ULDM halos with stochastic merger trees, and found that the core-halo mass relation depends only on the mass loss fraction of cores during binary mergers, \u03b2, such that \u03b1 = 2\u03b2 \u2212 1. Their data from cosmological simulations were fit well by \u03b2 = 0.7, leading to an exponent of \u03b1 = 0.4.\nRefs. [34] and [36] show the results of tests using halos formed through spherical collapse in cosmological simulations; both results were consistent with \u03b1 = 1/3 rather than the original relation found in Ref. [22]. This (mis)match is somewhat curious given that Ref. [22]\n4 also performed cosmological simulations with expanding backgrounds, while Refs. [18] and [25] used idealized soliton mergers to construct halos.\nRef. [39] use a wave superposition method to artificially construct ULDM halos with a variety of density profiles. The authors then verify the dynamical stability of these halos through numerical evolution of the SP system. They are therefore able to self-consistently construct halos with different relative core sizes, further suggesting that results from simulations are not required for halo stability; rather, the cores\u2019 sizes can depend on merger history, feedback processes, etc.\nRef. [27] discuss the range of results (including soliton mergers and cosmological simulations) and suggest that tidal stripping (both \u201creal\u201d from halo interactions in the cosmological simulations and \u201cartificial\u201d from choices of boundary conditions in the idealized case) contribute to the scatter in core-halo mass relations. Meanwhile, a more recent paper used approximate analytical expressions for Schro\u0308dinger-Poisson eigenstates to show that scatter in the concentration-mass relation contributes significantly to scatter in the core-halo mass relation, particularly for ULDM halos with mass M > 109 M [45].\nFinally, Ref. [46] recently found that the ULDM halo profile is a better fit to Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database than alternate models. However, the authors were unable to find a single value of particle mass that was a good fit for all the galaxies given the universal core-halo relation from Ref. [47]. In the case that dark matter is indeed ultralight, this result would be an argument against the existence of a universal core-halo relationship.\nIn this work we will primarily compare our results with references considering the same formation mechanism. Furthermore, we will consider halos of mass Mh . 109 M for our choice of units (presented in the following subsection), where Refs. [27, 45] found less scatter. In the following Sections, we will explore how the corehalo mass relation depends on merger history, as well as its sensitivity to numerical boundary conditions and show that some of these apparent discrepancies can be explained and resolved."

            "text": "For our final class of merger scenarios, we relax our assumption of equal progenitor masses. We do this in two batches: first, we systematically investigate the effects of changing the mass ratio \u00b5 \u2261 M1/M2 in binary soliton mergers, where M1 > M2. Ref. [18] found that for \u00b5 \u223c 2.5 the less massive soliton is completely disrupted and forms a diffuse halo around the more massive progenitor, which constitutes the \u201ccore\u201d of the resulting system. We therefore restrict ourselves to scenarios with 1 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 2.5. However, we note that the total preservation of the more massive soliton as the core along with the disruption of the less massive and thus puffier soliton does provide a mechanism for supporting a variety of relative core-halo sizes in ULDM. Specifically, we consider binary mergers with mass ratios \u00b5 \u2208 {1.05, 1.10, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50}, with the mass of the lighter soliton being M = 40, M = 50, or M = 60 in code units. These initial conditions are sketched in the third panel of Fig. 1\nFinally, we re-simulate each of the simultaneous mergers of odd numbers of solitons but add a central soliton with \u00b5 = 1.5 times the mass of each of the other solitons, as illustrated in the last panel of Fig. 1. In this way, we fix the mass ratio but vary the number of solitons colliding. This provides more range in \u039e, which is sensitive to the number of initial solitons but insensitive to changes in total mass.\nB. Relative Core Mass Mc/Mh\nIn all of our runs the solitons start at rest, and have merged to form a halo with a core and an NFW-like skirt halfway through the simulation or earlier. We isolate the contribution of the ground state to the halo wavefunction by performing an inner product of our \u03c8-grid and the wavefunction of the ground state soliton orthonormal \u03c60:\nc0 = \u222b d3r \u03c8(r)\u03c6\u22170(r) . (12)\nWorking with the normalized wavefunction, the relative mass of the solitonic core to the halo is |c0|2 = Mc/Mh.\nIn order to define the soliton eigenstate \u03c60 in each case, we calculate the time and spherically-averaged density\nprofile \u3008\u03c1\u3009 over 0.2 code units of time.6 Then, we solve for the potential \u3008\u03a6\u3009 corresponding to this profile using the Poisson equation (Eq. 2), and use that the resulting potential to calculate the eigenstates of the system. We examine the ground state qualitatively to verify that it matches the shape of the core of the halo after quasistable behavior in c0 is reached: the equivalent to a soliton of appropriate mass.\nIn each case, the formation of the solitonic core is clearly seen in the sudden increase in the amplitude of |c0|2; we illustrate this effect in our simultaneous mergers data set in Fig. 3. After the merger, the contribution of the ground state core oscillates around an approximately constant value. Mergers with a lower mass ratio take significantly longer to \u201crelax\u201d to an approximately constant core-size after the initial merger. We start averaging only after this quasi-static phase is reached for each individual run.\nTherefore, we define the relative mass of the core, Mc/Mh, as the average of |c0|2 over \u2206t = 0.2 after the core starts exhibiting quasi-static behavior. We have varied both the time interval over which we average and when we begin averaging; neither impacts our results significantly. This insensitivity is important for two reasons:\n1. it allays any worry that our halos have not had sufficient time to relax; and\n2. we do not need to determine exactly when the quasi-static behavior in |c0|2 begins.\nThough not shown here, the sequential and unequal mass data sets show similar behavior. Isolating the core using the eigenstates of the system is a new approach. In previous works, the mass of the core was determined by fitting the center of the halo to a density profile. In Ref. [18], the profiles are fit using the soliton profile approximation:\n\u03c1sol(r) ' \u03c10 [ 1 + 0.091 \u00b7 (r/rc)2 ]\u22128 (13)\nwhere \u03c10 is the central density and rc is the FWHM of the soliton. We perform the same analysis on our data using averaged halo density profiles \u3008\u03c1\u3009 over the same intervals (\u2206t = 0.2) as with our eigenstate analysis. We begin by setting \u03c10 = \u3008\u03c1\u3009(r = 0) in the analytical profile. Next, we compute rc using the following relationship [23]\n\u03c10 ' 3.1\u00d7 1015 (\n2.5\u00d7 10\u221222eV ma\n)2( kpc\nrc\n)4 M\nMpc3 (14)\nand assuming ma = 10 \u221222 eV.\nOnce we have arrived at a soliton density profile through fitting, we calculate its mass by integrating that\n6 The halos we create should be spherically symmetric, and so a spherically-averaged density profile \u3008\u03c1\u3009 is an accurate representation of the halos.\nprofile to the edge of the box. Hence, the core mass that we obtain through this procedure represents the integrated mass of the ground state contribution over the entire halo. This approach differs from previous work wherein the soliton mass is integrated only out to a predetermined cutoff, r\u03b1 (in accordance with the halo profile of Eq. 6), as suggested in e.g. Ref. [22]. Typically r\u03b1 is a few times rc, though the exact value is hard to determine precisely due to the dynamical nature of soliton cores in simulations, including the \u201cbreathing\u201d mode and random walk [43, 50]. We argue that such an approach introduces ambiguity since the choice of r\u03b1 is somewhat arbitrary and computation of the core mass involves integration over higher modes in the central halo, thereby picking up non-solitonic contributions. Our eigenstate decomposition method avoids both of these issues.7"

However, in the course of our soliton mergers much of the halo\u2019s mass becomes unbound and ultimately removed by the absorbing boundary conditions of our box.\n7 Because of the steep decrease in the soliton profile outside rc, our results change imperceptibly if we do impose a cutoff, further validating our approach. 8 We work in G = m = ~ = 1 units, and so have dropped that factor from Eq. 8.\nThough the mass/energy loss decreases significantly after the merger, a small but constant mass \u201cleak\u201d remains, meaning that the final value of \u039e is dependent on how long we choose to run our simulation. Furthermore, the rate of this mass loss increases with rising soliton number N , meaning that the slope of the core-halo mass relation Mc/Mh \u221d \u039e\u03b1 can be impacted by our choice of \u039e.\nWith this in mind, we choose to explore two selfconsistent definitions: \u039ei and \u3008\u039e\u3009. While the final value of \u039e in any run with a sponge is directly dependant on the simulation\u2019s run time, the initial value\n\u039ei \u2261 |Ei| M3i\n(15)\nis always robustly defined, and is equivalent to choosing to run the same simulation without a numerical sponge. The drawback of this definition is that it measures the mass and energy of the initial set of solitons arranged in the box, rather than the final halo, and so includes the contribution of mass that is no longer bound to the halo. In order to measure the latter, we use the averaged \u3008\u03c1\u3009 to define\n\u3008\u039e\u3009 = |\u3008K\u3009+ \u3008Q\u3009+ \u3008V \u3009| \u3008M\u30093 . (16)\nThe quantum energy \u3008Q\u3009 and potential energy \u3008V \u3009 can be directly calculated from \u3008\u03c1\u3009 using Eqs. 4 and 5. The halo mass \u3008M\u3009 is defined as \u3008M\u3009 = \u222b 4\u03c0\u3008\u03c1 \u3009r2dr.9 The\n9 Since we run idealized simulations with a non-expanding back-\n7 kinetic energy is more complex, as it requires knowledge of \u03c8 rather than \u03c1 to calculate velocities. We calculate the spherically-averaged cumulative kinetic energy out to the maximal radial distance r = L/2 and then average it over the same time period as that used to fix \u3008\u03c1\u3009. Given that kinetic energy is subdominant to both the quantum and potential terms, our results are insensitive to these specific choices. As with relative core mass in the previous subsection, each run is averaged over \u2206t = 0.2 starting when the core reaches a quasi-static state after halo-formation. In the case where we use initial quantities, we consider Mc/Mi \u221d \u039e\u03b1i and in the averaged case we consider Mc/\u3008M\u3009 \u221d \u3008\u039e\u3009\u03b1. In both cases we do not define the halo mass in terms of a virial radius, but integrate over the whole box (or, in the case of \u3008M\u3009, over the largest sphere inscribed in our box)."

The 1/3 result matches the analysis of Ref.

They worked with \u039ei and we reproduce their results despite our differing numerical setup and definition of \u039e, suggesting that merger history plays a stronger role in the final core-halo relationship than the exact definition of \u039e. We thus also recover the argument of Ref. [27], where the authors suggest that a diversity of core-halo mass relations can partially be attributed to \u201cartificial\u201d stripping due to boundary condition choices. However, we are able to somewhat blunt this effect by using the definition \u3008\u039e\u3009.\nWe attribute this to the robustness of the \u3008\u039e\u3009 defini-\ntion, stemming directly from the definition of \u3008\u03c1\u3009. By employing a spherically- and time-averaged definition of our halo profile after the core has reached the steady state, we construct a definition of halo mass and energy that varies less with time. Additionally, by using \u3008\u039e\u3009 we average over spurious contributions to the edge of the halo arising from the numerical boundary. Finally, this definition is the more useful one when considering real cosmological halos, as we will not have access to information on the initial masses and energies of individual halos. However, it\u2019s worth noting that using instantaneous values for astrophysical halos would introduce scatter into the observed core-halo relationship (as in Ref. [26]) when compared the simulated one using averaged quantities; nevertheless, we expect the main result to stay the same.\nFinally, we compare our two definitions of \u039e directly in Fig. 8. We note that while the relationship between \u039ei and \u3008\u039e\u3009 is approximately the same for our simultaneous and different mass data sets, the sequential data once again have a distinct slope. This provides further evidence to our conclusion that we cannot expect a single power law in \u039e to describe populations of halos with different merger histories."

Previous work (starting with Refs. [22, 47]) has established the core-halo relation as a function of Mc/Mh. This is usually taken to be a power law Mc/Mh \u221d \u039e\u03b1, where \u039e \u2261 |E|/M3 and values of \u03b1 ranging from 1/6 to 1/2 have been suggested in the literature. Here, we explore both \u039ei, calculated with respect to the initial mass Mi and energy Ei in the box, and \u3008\u039e\u3009, calculated from the spherically- and time-averaged halo density profile \u3008\u03c1\u3009.\nWe compared fits to an analytic core+NFW profile and the eigenstate approach, and fitting slightly overestimates the slope of the core-halo relationship for both definitions of \u039e relative to the eigenvalue method, such that \u03b1fit > \u03b1eig. The core masses differ up to 8.2%, with fitted cores being more massive than their eigenstate-derived counterparts. These discrepancies are relatively small and may follow from fitting to the density of the halo rather than its wavefunction: the former is the square of the latter, \u03c1 = |\u03c8|2, so the density may include crossterms which are not present when dealing with the wavefunction directly. In any case, the similarity between the two methods suggests that the scatter in the core-halo mass relation is due to processes affecting the halo skirt rather than the core.\nWe simulated soliton collisions in three regimes:\n1. simultaneous mergers\u2014where N solitons of identical masses merge collide at the center of our box;\n2. sequential mergers\u2014where two groups of N samemass solitons merge at the same time, after which the two merger products collide at the center of the box, forming the final halo; and\n3. unequal mass mergers\u2014mergers of two solitons with a mass ratio, \u00b5 = M1/M2, or merging oddN with the central soliton having a mass 1.5 times larger than the others.\nWorking with \u039ei, we do not find a single scaling behavior between the three data sets, and even within individual data sets there is substantial scatter. The slopes range from \u03b1 \u2248 1/5 to \u03b1 \u2248 1/3. The latter is consistent with the findings of Ref. [18] who simulated binary mergers of solitonic cores in the presence of a sponge at\nthe numerical boundary (as we do) and used the \u039ei definition. For \u3008\u039e\u3009, the overall best fit is \u03b1 \u2248 1/3, though the sequential mergers are better fit with \u03b1 \u2248 0.4 and display more scatter. The 1/3 slope matches the results of Refs. [25, 34], while the 0.4 slope matches those of Ref. [24].\nThe scatter and different slope in the sequential data suggest that merger history plays a non-negligible part in determining the relative mass of halo cores, possibly introducing a non-trivial redshift dependence (e.g. as in Ref. [45]). Furthermore, the simulations here are idealised scenarios and astrophysical environments will be more complex. In particular, cosmological data gives us instantaneous snapshots of galaxies rather than timeaveraged quantities, which will introduce additional scatter to any observationally motivated core-halo relationship [26]. Thus, our analysis does not support the existence of a single and universal core-halo mass relation for ULDM halos. Moreover, the inclusion of more complicated physics in halos such as mass accretion, dynamical heating from granules, or tidal interactions with subhalos, may further impact the core-halo relationship.\nFinally, the underlying dynamics of ULDM\u2014selfgravitating quantum matter that undergoes gravitational collapse\u2014may be replicated in the post-inflationary universe [52\u201356] and in hypothetical axion miniclusters [57, 58]. Soliton-like structures can form in both these phases and could play a role in a long post-inflationary matter-dominated phase, and these will like obey a similar core-halo relationship to ULDM. Consequently, the analysis here can shed light on these scenarios, which are governed by a common dynamical system, despite their very different physical basis."
