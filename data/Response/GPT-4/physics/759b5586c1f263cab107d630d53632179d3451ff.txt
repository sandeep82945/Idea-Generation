Development and Optimization of EO-Based Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Systems for DMD: Research could focus on creating and optimizing lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles that are specifically designed to deliver essential oils (EOs) and their active compounds directly to muscle tissues affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). This approach aims to increase the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of EOs, while minimizing potential side effects.

Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Click Chemistry in Synthesizing EO Conjugates: Investigate the use of click chemistry for synthesizing new EO conjugates that have enhanced solubility, stability, and targeted delivery capabilities. This research could lead to the development of EO-based treatments with improved safety profiles and effectiveness in managing DMD symptoms and associated mental health issues.

Combining EO Therapy with Gene Editing Techniques for DMD: Explore the synergistic effects of EO therapy combined with advanced gene editing techniques (such as CRISPR-Cas9) to correct the dystrophin gene mutation in DMD. This research could provide insights into how natural and technological therapies can be integrated to offer a more comprehensive treatment approach for genetic disorders.

Investigating the Role of EO in Muscle Regeneration and Anti-Inflammatory Pathways: Conduct in-depth studies on the molecular mechanisms by which EOs influence muscle regeneration and inflammation in the context of DMD. This could include examining the effects of specific EO compounds on muscle stem cells, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress pathways.

Clinical Trials Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of EO-Based Therapies in DMD Patients: Initiate rigorous clinical trials to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance of EO-based therapies in individuals with DMD. These trials should compare EO treatments to standard care options, evaluate quality of life outcomes, and monitor for any potential side effects associated with EO use.
