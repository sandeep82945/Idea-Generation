Croen\nDivision of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA, United States\nObjective: This study evaluated whether COVID-19 pandemic-related health, healthcare and economic factors during pregnancy are associated with prenatal depression and anxiety.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 6,628 pregnant members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who responded to a survey between 22 June and 30 September 2020. The survey included questions about depression (Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) symptoms and COVID-19related health and healthcare (e.g., had COVID-19) and economic (e.g., food insecurity) factors.\nResults: Over one third of individuals reported depression (25% mild, 8% moderate, 3% severe) or anxiety (22% mild, 8% moderate, 5% severe) symptoms. In multivariable analyses, COVID-19 during pregnancy, employment with greater risk of COVID-19, distress over changes in prenatal care, job loss, changes in childcare and food insecurity were associated with greater odds of prenatal depression or anxiety.\nConclusion: Findings suggest the COVID-19 pandemic may have severe mental health repercussions for pregnant individuals. Support services for pregnant individuals experiencing these COVID-19-related factors and monitoring of those who had moderate/severe prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic is warranted.\nKeywords: perinatal, mental health, psychological distress, mood disorder, pregnancy\nINTRODUCTION\nThe coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had a tremendous impact worldwide. At the time of publication of this paper, there have been >76 million confirmed cases and nearly 900,000 deaths in the US alone (1). While these data demonstrate the enormous impact on morbidity and mortality directly related to infection, the pandemic has triggered social, behavioral and economic changes that may also have psychological effects. Since the pandemic has started, an increasing amount of research has documented the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on depression and anxiety (2\u20134).\nEdited by: Franco Mascayano,\nColumbia University, United States\nReviewed by: Jose Moya,\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Chile\nJennifer Morales-Cruz, Ponce Health Sciences University,\nPuerto Rico\n*Correspondence: Lyndsay A.

Pregnancy is an extremely vulnerable period given the increased susceptibility to adverse health effects for both the mother and offspring. Pregnant individuals have experienced distinct concerns and challenges during the pandemic. Concerns about fewer prenatal visits, cancellation of labor and delivery classes, virtual visits, and the possibility of heightened risks of adverse pregnancy and child outcomes associated with COVID-19 (5) may lead to increases in psychological distress for pregnant individuals. In addition, a household member with COVID-19 and employment that may increase the risk of exposure to infection may have a similar impact on prenatal psychological distress. The stay-at-home orders and shelter-in-place advisories implemented to control and reduce the spread of the virus (6) not only resulted in physical and social isolation from family and friends but also led to business closures and the highest US unemployment rate recorded (7). Loss of employment by a pregnant woman or her partner when the need for economic security is great may have a significant impact on her mental health (8). It may also lead to other stressors such as food insecurity (9) that may increase psychological distress (9). The closure of schools and day cares left families who did not lose their jobs struggling to find childcare and often facing dramatic increases in childcare costs. These COVID-19-related health, healthcare and economic factors are all likely to compound psychological distress specifically depression and anxiety in pregnant individuals.\nDepression and anxiety during pregnancy can have significant negative consequences for both the parent and baby (10\u201316). Thus, there is a need to understand the most salient COVID-19related factors contributing to prenatal depression and anxiety to prevent the emergence of severe mental illness and identify areas for targeted interventions and treatments. This study evaluates associations between COVID-19-related health, healthcare changes and economic factors with anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnant individuals seeking prenatal care in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated healthcare delivery system."

All 15 regional service centers (with 48 associated office facilities) have Obstetrics and Gynecology and Behavioral Medicine/Psychiatry Departments. KPNC members include individuals covered by employer-sponsored insurance plans, the insurance exchange and Medicaid. Coverage is provided for approximately 30% of the northern California population. KPNC members are socio-demographically similar to the population living in the geographic area (17). KPNC maintains comprehensive electronic health records (EHR).\nBeginning on June 22, 2020 pregnant KPNC members were invited to participate in a KPNC COVID-19 Pregnancy Study\n(18). The survey collected information on depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as COVID-19-related health, healthcare and economic factors. Pregnant individuals 18 years of age or older and English-speaking were identified from the EHR and recruited via email. At the initial survey launch, all eligible individuals were contacted via email and invited to complete a brief, web-based survey. Every 2 weeks thereafter, all newly eligible individuals were emailed a study invitation. Individuals who did not respond to the initial email invitation received email reminders 7 and 14 days after the initial emails were sent. Participants who started but did not complete the survey received two email reminders, at 7 and 14 days after starting the survey. While study recruitment is ongoing, this study reports on data collected from 6,628 individuals who were at any stage of pregnancy between 1 January 2020 through 30 September 2020.\nThe Institutional Review Board of KPNC approved all study procedures and individuals indicated informed consent by completing the survey after reviewing the consent information in the recruitment email (protocol number 1600113-11)."

Weights ranged from 1.74 to 40.24 in individuals who completed the survey. For the 14 individuals with weights greater than 20, weights were truncated at 20.\nWeighted percentages were calculated for all categorical measures overall and by depression and anxiety severity status. For individuals with missing data for the exposure or covariates we used multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) (25) with 100 imputations to impute missing values. After imputation, weighted multinomial logistic regression models (using the glogit option in the SAS logistic PROC) were run for each imputed dataset excluding participants with missing outcomes values for the respective models (n = 36 for prenatal depression and n = 44 for prenatal anxiety). Results were combined using Rubin\u2019s rules (26). Crude point and interval estimates of odds ratios of depression (severe, moderate, mild vs. none) and anxiety (severe, moderate, mild vs. none) associated with each COVID-19-related factor were conducted. Adjusted models included all covariates (maternal age, parity, insurance status, history of a depression or anxiety disorder, race/ethnicity, and trimester at survey completion) and COVID-19-related factors. Analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute INC, Cary NC)."

            "text": "This cross-sectional study examined the associations of several COVID-19 pandemic-related health, healthcare and economic factors with depression and anxiety symptoms in pregnant individuals during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and height of stay-at-home orders. More severe symptoms of prenatal depression and/or anxiety were associated with self-report of COVID-19, employment increasing the risk of COVID-19, distress over changes in prenatal care, job loss, childcare challenges, and food insecurity. This study evaluated a larger number of COVID19-related factors than previously assessed. In addition, previous research has not assessed the impact of COVID-19-related factors on prenatal depression and anxiety symptom severity, which is important for identifying those at greatest risk.\nElucidating risk factors for adverse mental health during pregnancy is of extreme significance as prenatal depression and anxiety can have detrimental impacts on the health of both mother and child. For example, individuals with prenatal depression and anxiety are at increased risk for unhealth maternal behaviors (e.g., diminished self-care, substance use) (10, 13\u201316, 27\u201329), preterm birth, low, birthweight, small-for-gestational age (SGA) neonates (10, 14, 29), and emotional and behavioral problems in the offspring (27, 28). Heightened prenatal\ndepression and anxiety symptoms also increase the risk of postpartum depression (30, 31). Maternal self-harm and suicide is the leading cause of deaths in postpartum individuals (13, 16). Identifying factors that increase the risk of prenatal depression and anxiety may help develop targeted interventions to improve the health of pregnant individuals and their children."

            "text": "Our finding of the associations of self-reported COVID-19 and employment in a job with high-risk of COVID-19 exposure with prenatal depression and anxiety severity is consistent with other reports in pregnant individuals (32) and other populations (33, 34). In general, people with high-risk employment report more fatigue, health worries and fear (35). These findings support consideration of high-risk employment as a risk factor for mental health disorders in pregnancy, for use in depression/ anxiety screening strategies.\nWe documented escalating severity of depression and anxiety symptoms associated with distress over COVID-19-related changes in prenatal care. These findings are similar to other studies documenting COVID-19-related changes in prenatal care and greater psychological distress (33, 36\u201338). The COVID-19 pandemic forced rapid implementation of hybrid models of care that were developing prior to the pandemic. Provider and healthcare system recognition of the psychological distress associated with changes to prenatal care should consider this when evaluating which care-delivery modifications to implement as standard prenatal care post pandemic or in future public health emergencies."

            "text": "Previous research on the association of job loss or loss of source of income due to COVID-19 with prenatal depression and anxiety has reported mixed results (32, 33, 36, 38, 39). Our study suggested a relationship between participant\u2019s job loss and depression, but not anxiety, while partner\u2019s job loss was not related to psychological distress. However, food insecurity was strongly associated with prenatal depression and anxiety. This relationship between food insecurity and prenatal depression has been previously documented in research conducted prior to the pandemic (40, 41), yet the magnitude reported in our study (over 5-fold odds of severe depression associated with food insecurity) exceeds pre-COVID-19 findings (4-fold odds) (40). To our knowledge this is the first time that food insecurity has been studied in relation to prenatal anxiety. The strong relationship between food insecurity and psychological distress has important implications for clinical guidelines and health policy related to pregnancy in general, not just limited to times of public health emergencies. Addressing food insecurity may have a significant impact on the mental health of pregnant individuals, in addition to nutritional health. Given that not all food insecure individuals are eligible for government assistance, research into the effectiveness of non-governmental forms of food assistance, such as food banks and nutritional educational programs, is\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers May 2022 | Volume 67 | Article 16044337\nneeded. Healthcare systems can also help by screening pregnant individuals for food insecurity and directing individuals to available resources.\nChanges in childcare was also significantly related to increased odds of depression and anxiety. Other studies of pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic have documented similar findings (32, 38) highlighting the importance of public policy providing monetary support and childcare options especially during times of crises."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "The low survey response rate raises concerns about nonresponse bias. However, our analyses were weighted to account for these differences. It is possible individuals with higher psychological distress were less likely to participate in the study and may explain why the prevalence of depression and anxiety was lower in our sample than has been reported in some, but not all (4), samples of pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found that individuals who completed the survey were slightly more likely to have a history of depression or anxiety than individuals who did not complete the survey. Additionally, the cross-sectional study design limits our ability to establish causation. However, the likelihood of reverse causation is diminished by two points. It is unlikely that depression and anxiety led to any of the COVID19-related factors with the exception of losing a job. Additionally, the mental health screeners asked about symptoms in the past 2 weeks while the time frame for the COVID-19-related factors reflected anytime since the start of the pandemic. Further, the depression and anxiety outcomes are based on symptoms in the past 2 weeks. If the COVID-19 related exposures illicit acute symptoms and the exposures occurred earlier in pregnancy, our findings may be an underestimate of the true association. Although this study sample represents a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse population representative of Northern California, generalizability to other populations may be limited."

            "text": "This study contributes to the growing body of research documenting the adverse impact of public health emergencies experienced during pregnancy on maternal mental health (42\u201345). Findings from this study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have severe mental health repercussions for pregnant individuals, an extremely vulnerable population. Several COVID-19-related health,\nhealthcare and economic factors were found to adversely impact the mental health of pregnant individuals. These findings provide valuable information for the rapid development of policy, clinical and healthcare system interventions to promote the mental health of pregnant individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and to effectively prepare for future pandemics. These study findings may also have broad policy and clinical implications outside of the US. The known short- and longterm consequences associated with prenatal psychological distress highlight the need for support services for pregnant individuals experiencing these COVID-19 related stressors. Healthcare systems should consider screening for identified stressors associated with poor mental health when conducting depression and anxiety screening and provide the appropriate interventions. Counseling services, social support and stressreduction interventions to promote maternal mental health should be implemented. Additionally, continued postpartum monitoring of individuals who had high prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and their children and appropriate interventions are important for decreasing the risk of the known adverse maternal and child outcomes associated with poor prenatal mental health."
