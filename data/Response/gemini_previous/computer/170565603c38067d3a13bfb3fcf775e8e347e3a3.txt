1. **Investigate the use of sUAS for HTPP in fruit and vegetable crops.** Most sUAS-based HTPP studies have focused on row or grain crops. There is a need for more research on the application of sUAS for HTPP in fruit and vegetable crops, which have unique growing conditions and production cycles.


2. **Develop fully automated pipelines for sUAS-based crop imagery.** The complexity of sUAS-based data processing and analysis may limit its use among researchers. There is a need for studies with a focus on the development of fully automated pipelines of sUAS-based crop imagery to enhance the impacts and applications of sUAS technology for phenotyping, crop monitoring, and improving crop management practices.


3. **Explore the potential effects of carotenoids on stress resilience and crop protection using sUAS-based imagery.** Previous sUAS-based phenotyping studies have primarily focused on chlorophyll content. There is a need for studies that address the potential effects of carotenoids on stress resilience and crop protection using sUAS-based imagery. Carotenoids play a significant role in plant photosynthetic processes, stress signals, and adaptation, as well as for crop defense mechanisms.


4. **Investigate the use of multiple sensor fusion for sUAS-based HTPP.** Sensor fusion can improve the accuracy of sUAS phenotyping. There is a need for studies that explore the use of multiple sensor fusion for sUAS-based HTPP. This could involve combining data from different types of sensors, such as RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR, to improve the accuracy of trait estimation.


5. **Develop low-cost and high-performance sensors for sUAS-based HTPP.** The cost of imaging sensors is a major limitation for sUAS-based HTPP. There is a need for studies that focus on the development of low-cost and high-performance sensors for sUAS-based HTPP. This could involve the development of new sensor technologies or the adaptation of existing sensor technologies for use on sUAS platforms.
