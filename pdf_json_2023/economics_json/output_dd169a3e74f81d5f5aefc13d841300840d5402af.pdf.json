The virtual world has become so expansive that it now operates in nearly perfect parallel to the real world, with a specialized website or app available to accomplish any physical-world task imaginable. Looking to round out your summer wardrobe or track down the latest smart watch? Head to the local shopping mall. Or to Amazon.com\u2014either will work. Need to buy or sell secondhand kids\u2019 clothes? Try the local flea market, or eBay, or, if you are feeling fancy, Poshmark. The internet is now so diversely populated that we scarcely notice and hardly care whether the entities with which we interact operate in the physical or virtual world.\nBut the question has dramatic consequences for the entities themselves. Even when they engage in exactly the same conduct, online and offline entities are subject to completely different legal regimes. Unlike their physical-world counterparts, online entities are\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nimmune from many types of state and federal lawsuits\u2014specifically, those that relate to content created by third parties\u2014under Section 2301 of the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d) of 1996.2 As a result, online entities have been able to operate unlawful businesses\u2014 facilitation of prostitution and unlawful gun sales to name just two\u2014 free from the threat of civil liability that they would face in the physical world.3 And even those online entities with more salutary business models enjoy a competitive advantage over their physical-world counterparts. Immunity from lawsuits means lower litigation costs and fewer judgments and damage awards for plaintiffs.\nWhy bar behavior in the physical world only to allow that same behavior in the virtual world, where it may be even easier to accomplish? The question sounds simple enough. It is one of law\u2019s central tenets, after all, that like cases be treated alike. Even so, few topics rouse such passion or touch so many ongoing debates as the question of internet immunity. Every day brings fresh controversy, call for change, or proposed legislation.

REV. 203, 203 (2018) (suggesting that online immunity doctrine be updated to consider manner in which online entities elicit and use their users\u2019 data).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nThe reason that internet immunity reform rouses such passion is because the stakes are so very high. Since its enactment more than two decades ago, Section 230 has been a resounding success. Its broad protections against lawsuits related to third-party content shield online entities from an economically crippling duty to review the nearly inconceivable volume of data that flows through their systems.10 Without such protection, online platforms might be compelled to censor user speech or disallow online posting altogether to avoid the risk of liability. Section 230\u2019s protections have been crucial to decades of free speech advances built on inexpensive and free flowing internet publishing technologies.11\nDespite its nearly sacred status in the tech industry, however, Section 230 started off humbly,12 and suffers from a humble problem: The Congress of 1996 did not foresee the internet of 2020, and the statute is now outdated. Section 230 assumes a publication-industrylike model of the internet\u2014it encourages censorship and speaks in terms of \u201cpublisher[s] or speaker[s]\u201d and \u201ccontent provider[s]\u201d13\u2014and is well suited to govern the internet\u2019s information repositories and communications channels.14 Online actors in this publication-centric internet model can be handily divided into three camps: content authors,15 computer services16 that provide access to content, and the internet users who consume the content.17 With the virtual world so neatly divisible, potential wrongdoers are easy to identify. Any wrongdoing can be attributed to its active participants\u2014the internet content creators who author content\u2014not the passive computer services and\n10 See infra note 91 and accompanying text. R 11 See infra notes 92\u201394 and accompanying text. R 12 Section 230 was enacted as part of the much more comprehensive CDA and received\nlittle fanfare. Few media outlets included any discussion of Section 230 in their coverage of the CDA. See JEFF KOSSEFF, THE TWENTY-SIX WORDS THAT CREATED THE INTERNET 66\u201368 (2019).\n13 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c). 14 See infra Section I.C.3. 15 Content authors or \u201cinformation content providers\u201d are defined by Section 230 as \u201cany person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(f)(3).\n16 Section 230 defines an \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d as \u201cany information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions.\u201d Id. \u00a7 230(f)(2). The archetypical computer services at the time of Section 230\u2019s enactment were the internet service providers Prodigy, CompuServe, and, later, America Online. See KOSSEFF, supra note 12, at 36. R\n17 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c)(1).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\ntheir users who merely provide access to and view that content. With Section 230, Congress federalized the principle by adopting a bright line rule that none but an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d can be held liable for internet content.18\nBut publication is not the internet\u2019s exclusive function, and that is even more the case now than it was in 1996. Section 230 now presides over a much different internet than the one it was designed to govern. The internet of today is much more diverse, specialized, and interactive. Of course, it continues to include many online platforms that transmit and host third-party content, but it also supports the delivery of innumerable real-world goods and services that would have been unimaginable twenty years ago.19 Authoring or failing to moderate content flowing through their services is not the only way that online entities can cause harm.20 Consequently, Section 230\u2019s bright line rule relying on content authorship as the deciding factor for immunity is poorly tailored for the internet that exists today.\nRecognizing the growing problem, legal scholars and lawmakers of both political parties have proposed numerous reforms,21 such as amending Section 230 to withhold immunity if online entities intentionally or knowingly facilitate illegal conduct,22 profit from unlawful content,23 improperly monetize user data,24 or fail to abide by best practices in policing the online behaviors of their users.25 Internet im-\n18 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c); Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997) (\u201cBy its plain language, \u00a7 230 creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service.\u201d).\n19 See infra Section I.C. See generally Edelman & Stemler, supra note 9, at 143\u201351 (dis- R cussing online marketplaces that facilitate a variety of commercial transactions).\n20 See infra Section II.B. 21 For a more detailed discussion of the various reform proposals, see infra Section III.A.1. 22 See U.S. DEP\u2019T OF JUST., SECTION 230\u2014NURTURING INNOVATION OR FOSTERING\nUNACCOUNTABILITY? 14\u201315 (2020), https://www.justice.gov/file/1286331/download [https:// perma.cc/6AU2-SKNN] [hereinafter DOJ Section 230 Recommendations] (recommending a \u201cBad Samaritan\u201d carve out to remove immunity where online entities purposefully solicit third parties to engage in unlawful activities through their platforms); Citron & Wittes, supra note 9, R at 455\u201356 (proposing denial of immunity if an entity fails to take reasonable steps to protect against known illegal activity).\n23 See Agnieszka McPeak, Platform Immunity Redefined, 62 WM. & MARY L.

REV. 401, 419 (2017) (recommending that immunity be contingent on an entity\u2019s reasonable efforts to prevent unlawful uses of its service). Another set of recent proposals would modify Section 230 not because it is out of date, but to\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nmunity reform continues to face significant opposition, however, from the tech industry and from those legal scholars26 who worry that changes to Section 230 could do more harm than good. Changes to the statute could curtail freedom of expression on the internet and spur online platforms to censor user speech by undermining the critical protection Section 230 provides against lawsuits for failing to moderate third-party content.\nTo navigate those competing concerns, this Article proposes a carefully tailored refinement to internet immunity doctrine that would expressly bar any claim that would impose a content-moderation burden on an internet platform but would allow other claims to proceed. Thus, where an alleged harm is preventable by a means other than content moderation\u2014for example, by redesigning an app or website\u2014 a plaintiff could freely seek relief, just as in the physical world. By shifting the internet-immunity inquiry from the publication-focused question of content authorship to the more generally applicable question of content moderation, this approach would arm courts with a more flexible analytical tool and free them from Section 230\u2019s outdated publication-focused model. The approach would empower courts to eliminate the online-versus-offline disparity and treat like conduct alike in both the physical and virtual world\nThis Article approaches the problem in three parts. Part I uses a mass shooting wrongful death case decided by the Wisconsin Supreme Court as a case study to analyze the disparity in the law governing internet versus real-world defendants and to illustrate the harms that can flow from immunizing certain online behavior. Part II examines various contexts in which Section 230 is poorly suited to govern the modern, heterogenous internet. Finally, Part III presents a new frame-\nuse the threat of its removal to pressure entities into action to address concerns about large tech companies\u2019 concentrated power over speech and commerce. See Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act, S. 4534, 116th Cong. \u00a7 2 (2020) (removing liability protection where an online entity moderates third-party content unless it does so with an \u201cobjectively reasonable belief\u201d that the content is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, \u201cpromoting self-harm, promoting terrorism, or unlawful\u201d); Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, S. 1914, 116th Cong.

He fired first at Zina; as she lay on the floor bleeding, Radcliffe began shooting her coworkers.41 After stalking through the salon firing at its employees and customers, Radcliffe returned to his wife to shoot her in the head, killing her.42 Zina\u2019s daughter, Yasmeen, was there to witness the horror.43 Yasmeen survived only because of the bravery of a coworker who positioned herself in front of Yasmeen as Radcliffe took aim, losing her own life in the process.44 All told that day, Radcliffe killed Zina and two other women at the spa, and injured four others before retreating to the second floor and taking his own life.45\nFollowing the tragedy, Yasmeen commenced a lawsuit alleging numerous causes of action against Armslist.com, including negligence, public nuisance, wrongful death, and aiding and abetting tortious con-\nGun Sale to Mass Shooter, WALL ST.

Yet the Wisconsin trial court never considered whether Yasmeen had pleaded any cognizable tort claims. Instead, without written decision, the court granted Armslist.com\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Section 230 of the CDA on the ground that federal law preempts all claims against websites that provide communication tools that have neutral and lawful purposes.47 The fundamental questions the suit raised about Wisconsin tort law were thus deemed moot and never considered.48\nDismissal might have been the right outcome. Armslist.com, like a gun-show organizer, merely facilitates firearms sales between other individuals.

What duties, if any, does an entity that facilitates private gun sales between third parties have to potential victims of the gun buyers that they help to pair with gun sellers? When is an act of gun violence following an illegal sale reasonably foreseeable? If an act is foreseeable, when does the intentionally wrongful conduct of the shooter disrupt the chain of causality?\nIn the physical world, courts considering claims against private gun sale facilitators, such as gun show promoters, employ the traditional tools of tort law. They apply longstanding doctrines passed down and modified through the evolution of the common law to isolate and grapple with the issues that the long history of human wrongdoing tells us are relevant to liability: How much did the gun show promoter know about the illegal sales? Did it do anything to promote them? How foreseeable was the wrongful conduct? And were the gun show organizer\u2019s policies and procedures reasonable under the circumstances?\nFor example, in Pavlides v. Niles Gun Show, Inc.,51 the Court of Appeals of Ohio considered the viability of a negligence claim against the promoter of a gun show from which firearms were stolen and later used to commit a crime.52 In that case, the gun show promoter permitted a group of four teenagers\u2014ages thirteen to seventeen\u2014to enter a gun show unaccompanied by an adult.53 The group proceeded to steal numerous firearms from the third-party vendors at the show, including a .38 caliber handgun.54 One of the teens later explained that the firearms were \u201c\u2018just laying around\u2019 on tables,\u201d that they \u201cjust pick[ed] them up and walk[ed] away with them,\u201d and that \u201cit was easy.\u201d55 Finding ammunition was also easy. The thirteen-year-old purchased matching .38 caliber ammunition from a vendor at the show unaccompanied by an adult and without proof of age.56 The next day, the teens stole a Chevrolet Camaro and took it for a joy ride in the snow, intentionally swerving and sliding the car into trash cans as they went.57 When they were stopped by two officers in a police car, one of the\n51 637 N.E.2d 404 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994). 52 Id. at 406\u201307. 53 Id. 54 Id. 55 Id. at 407 (alterations in original) (quoting Edward A. Tilley III). 56 Id. 57 Id.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nteens pulled out the .38 caliber handgun and shot the first officer in the chest.58 As the second officer turned and ran, the teen shot him in the back of the head.59\nThe facts of the case are tragic. A gang of unsupervised, unruly teens got into trouble, made extraordinarily poor choices, and the situation turned dire. Ordinarily, of course, tort law would not recognize a claim against a gun show promoter based on the later misuse of firearms stolen from its events. The gun show promoter was separated from the later tortious conduct by multiple actors\u2014third-party vendors and teens\u2014and multiple instances of criminal conduct.60 But ordinarily is not always. Sometimes liability is warranted even where intervening third-party conduct contributes to the harm. Discerning the difference requires application in each case of tort law\u2019s nuanced rules governing liability for third-party harms.61\nUltimately, the Pavlides Court determined that the plaintiff police officers pleaded a cognizable claim against the gun show promoter.62 Considering the foreseeability of the teens\u2019 actions and the gun show promoter\u2019s duty to the third-party police officers, the court reasoned that \u201creasonable minds certainly could conclude that unsecured firearms present an attractive if not irresistible lure to children.\u201d63 The court concluded that the police officer shootings were a foreseeable result of both the promoter\u2019s lax admission procedures, which failed to identify the teens as unaccompanied minors, and its failure to require that vendors secure their weapons or refuse sales to minors, especially given the promoter\u2019s knowledge that weapons had been stolen from past shows.64 As for proximate cause, the court reasoned that although proximate cause is ordinarily lacking where unforeseeable criminal acts interrupt the chain of causation,\n58 Id. 59 Id. 60 See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIAB. FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7\u00a7 19, 34 (AM. L. INST. 2010) (explaining that where an intervening third-party act contributes as a factual cause of harm, an actor\u2019s liability is limited to harms foreseeably flowing from her lack of care, but that third-party wrongdoing will sometimes be a foreseeable risk that she must take reasonable care to avoid).\n61 See id. \u00a7 34 cmt. a (describing the \u201cextensive rules\u201d that have historically governed \u201cwhen intervening acts become sufficient to \u2018supersede\u2019 an actor\u2019s earlier tortious conduct\u201d but also noting that tort law\u2019s evolution in recent decades toward liability and damage awards based on comparative fault has reduced the need for proximate and superseding cause rules that bar liability altogether).\n62 See Pavlides, 637 N.E.2d at 409\u201310. 63 Id. at 409. 64 Id.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nunsupervised teens and firearms are a dangerous combination and a jury could find the criminal acts to be a foreseeable result of the promoter\u2019s lack of safeguards.65 Slight factual variations or differences in governing law could easily produce different results.66 The analysis requires fact-specific application of doctrines crafted to address difficult questions of causation, duty, and liability in cases involving multiple causal actors and intervening wrongful conduct.\n2. The Virtual World\nIn the virtual world though, the analysis is completely different. With Section 230 of the CDA, Congress preempted most claims against websites when those claims involve actions by third parties, such as their users.67 Because the modern internet\u2019s major players are now built around user-created data\u2014for example, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat\u2014Section 230 has had vast consequences for legal actions against internet entities. The validity of claims brought against such entities for third-party harms is determined not by the intricate legal doctrines designed for the purpose, but by courts\u2019 attempts to parse a single phrase from Congress: \u201cNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by\u201d someone else.68\nWhen Yasmeen Daniel brought her virtual-world claim against Armslist.com for its role in the shooting death of her mother, the court dismissed the claim under Section 230 on immunity grounds without reaching the cognizability of her claim.69 It did not consider the foreseeability and care related questions that are so crucial to the\n65 See id. at 409\u201310. 66 See, e.g., Bloxham v. Glock Inc., 53 P.3d 196, 198\u2013200 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (applying Arizona\u2019s test for duty to third parties and concluding on similar facts that gun show promoter had no duty to third-party victims regardless of foreseeability); Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 750 N.E.2d 1055, 1060\u201362 (N.Y. 2001) (opinion of Wesley, J.) (concluding handgun manufacturers do not owe victims a duty to exercise care in marketing and distribution); Valentine v. On Target, Inc., 727 A.2d 947, 952 (Md. 1999) (finding gun dealer had no duty to third party victim of gun stolen from dealer\u2019s store where there was no lack of due care storing the weapon, no knowledge of circumstances that would increase the probability of theft, and no special relationship between dealer and victim); Estate of Strever v. Cline, 924 P.2d 666, 674, 668\u201371 (Mont. 1996) (concluding that owner of unlocked pickup truck with pistol and ammunition stored under the seat had a duty to three teenagers who stole the pistol and ammunition\u2014which one of the teens later inadvertently fired, shooting and killing his friend\u2014but the truck owner\u2019s breach of that duty was not a proximate cause of the death).\n67 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c)(2). 68 Id. \u00a7 230(c)(1). 69 See Daniel v. Armslist, LLC, 926 N.W.2d 710, 727 (Wis. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct.\n562 (2019).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nanalysis in the strikingly similar, physical-world Pavlides decision.70 The Armslist court never considered the adequacy of Armslist.com\u2019s precautionary measures at all. Armslist.com would have been entitled to dismissal under Section 230 even if its conduct had exceeded the negligence in Pavlides and rose to the level of the deliberate recklessness of the hypothetical Illegal Gun Sales Warehouse. Rather than questions about knowledge, foreseeability, and fault, the viability of claims in the virtual world often turns on courts\u2019 attempts to parse Section 230 to determine whether a defendant was an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d of the material on its website or whether it was a mere conduit, a \u201ccomputer service\u201d providing access to that information.71\nAs discussed in more detail below,72 this approach is problematic for several reasons. First, Section 230 is undertextured73 in that it is insufficiently precise to address the hard cases. Second, the law was designed for a different purpose; is poorly suited to resolving questions of when to impose liability for third-party harms; and, unlike the common law, has not evolved to keep pace with shifting technologies. Third, even assuming Congress intended to create a separate set of rules to govern internet tort claims for third-party harms, that dichotomous framework does not fit the modern internet. It is increasingly problematic to treat online and offline defendants differently in a world where so much economic and social life now takes place in the virtual sphere."

(3) Information content provider\nThe term \u201cinformation content provider\u201d means any person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service.76\nThe section includes two key provisions. First, Section 230(c)(1) immunizes \u201cinteractive computer service[s]\u201d\u2014websites, apps, internet\n1995) (statement of Sen. J. James Exon) (\u201c[T]he worst, most vile, most perverse pornography is only a few click-click-clicks away from any child on the Internet.\u201d); see also Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 331 (4th Cir. 1997) (\u201cAnother important purpose of \u00a7 230 was to encourage service providers to self-regulate the dissemination of offensive material over their services.\u201d).\n75 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(a)(3) (\u201cThe Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.\u201d); Zeran, 129 F.3d at 330 (\u201cCongress recognized the threat that tort-based lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning Internet medium.\u201d).\n76 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c), (f)(3).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nservice providers, and the like\u2014from any theory of liability that depends upon their being \u201ctreated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by\u201d someone else.77 As a result, the Verizons, Twitters, and Facebooks of the world can provide access to the internet and to the posts of their users without fear, for example, of incurring tort liability when a user\u2019s tweet or post defames a third party. Any defamation claim against Facebook for a user\u2019s post would require \u201ctreat[ing it] as the publisher or speaker\u201d78 of that post and would thus be barred by Section 230.\nSecond, pursuant to Section 230(c)(2), \u201c[n]o provider . . . of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to\u201d objectionable content.79 Congress believed that the prospect of potential tort liability was limiting service providers\u2019 willingness to deploy contentfiltering technologies to help parents limit their children\u2019s access to objectionable material and that this provision would broaden the availability of such technologies.80\nRather than directly regulating entities and requiring them to censor content, Section 230 operates by removing a major disincentive to censorship: the threat of tort liability. In crafting Section 230, Congress had firmly in mind the then-recent decision Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.,81 in which a New York state trial court held an internet service provider liable for defamatory content posted by a third party on one of the service\u2019s message boards.82 Stratton Oakmont had reasoned that because Prodigy took steps to review and screen offensive content, it had taken on the role of a newspaper-like publisher rather than a mere distributor and could therefore be held liable for repeating the defamer\u2019s words.83 That is, because Prodigy screened and \u201crestrict[ed] access to\u201d84 some objectionable content, it was deemed to have ratified85 all content that it did not screen and\n77 Id. \u00a7 230(c). 78 Id. 79 Id. \u00a7 230(c)(2). 80 See id. \u00a7 230(b)(3)\u2013(4); H.R.

With Section 230, Congress emphatically rejected that theory of liability, freeing websites, internet service providers, and others to screen objectionable or simply off-topic, third-party-created content without fear of being held liable as the publisher or speaker87 of whatever content they choose not to censor.88\n2. The Internet-Fueling Liability Shield\nBy almost every account, Section 230 has been an astounding success. The federalization of internet law and elimination of any obligation on online entities to moderate content helped to fuel the internet\u2019s explosive growth from the 1990s through the 2000s. As Jeff Kosseff has observed, \u201c[t]he early Section 230 court opinions could not have come at a better time . . . [a]s the industry was slowly recovering from the dot-com implosion of 2000 and 2001,\u201d and companies were just beginning to develop a new generation of two-way websites centered around user content\u2014sites like YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, and Yelp, that have come to dominate the modern internet.89 Such sites \u201cprovided once-voiceless consumers with a megaphone to warn others against companies\u2019 scams\u201d and \u201crevolutionized how Americans receive information.\u201d90\nSection 230 has supported the internet\u2019s development in three important ways. First, Section 230 shields online entities from an economically crippling duty to moderate the content flowing through their systems. Think of online platforms like Facebook or Twitter, for example. Their users create and upload an almost inconceivable volume of content each day. Requiring such entities to review that con-\ninternet. See Gregory M.

Were online entities at risk of legal liability whenever one of their users posted something unlawful, platforms might decide to block their users from posting even slightly risky material to avoid the cost of moderating content and the risk of legal liability for failing to do so.92 Why risk posting content that could subject the company to liability when the platform, compared to the speaker herself, has no intrinsic interest in publicizing the message? Most likely to engage in widespread censorship would be platforms like Twitter, which transmit so much content that they could not possibly hope to screen it all. But the incentive to censor would press even low-volume sites, like individual blogs, whose operators typically lack the resources of larger entities to respond to problematic material.93 Without Section 230\u2019s protections, the legal risks of hosting user-created content would push entities of all sizes to dramatically alter their current practices. Platforms might require that user\u2019s posts be manually prescreened before becoming visible to the public; they might adopt automated censorship tools calibrated to let through only the most benign speech; or they might decide to eliminate user-created content from their sites altogether by removing comment posting functionality. The result would be the elimination of decades of free speech advances built on inexpensive and free flowing internet publishing technologies.94\n91 See Mark A.

The first courts to assess whether and when online entities should be liable for their content sought guidance from the nearest physical-world analogue\u2014 tort law governing when hard-copy book and newspaper publishers or the bookstores and news vendors distributing their publications should be liable for defamatory content they contain.95\nIn its early days, the internet more closely resembled the traditional publication world, and pre\u2013Section 230 courts quickly adopted publication-world principles. In particular, courts noted that print media distributors generally are not liable for defamatory content within their pages because requiring them to scour the pages of books and newspapers they sell would be an impossible burden.96 Early courts noted the similar deluge of content that passed through internet service providers like CompuServe and America Online and reasoned that they too should ordinarily not be liable for the content they make available because, like a \u201cpublic library, book store, or newsstand,\u201d it would not be feasible for the online entity \u201cto examine every publication . . . for potentially defamatory statements\u201d97 and \u201c[s]uch a rule would be an impermissible burden on the First Amendment.\u201d98 Congress made that principle part of federal law by enacting Section 230. Section 230 fosters free expression on the internet99 by federalizing the principle that online entities, like print distributors,100 should not\nable to get past the old gatekeepers\u2014newspapers, book publishers, retailers, and the like\u201d but that \u201c[n]ow all that is needed is an Internet connection\u201d); see also Eugene Volokh, Cheap Speech and What It Will Do, 104 YALE L.J. 1805, 1806\u201307 (1995) (noting that historically the right to free speech has favored popular or well-funded ideas, but predicting, presciently, that new information technologies would dramatically reduce the costs of distributing speech and create a more diverse and democratic environment).\n95 See KOSSEFF, supra note 12, at 39\u201340.

Section 230\u2019s primary advantages over alternative defenses stem from its simplicity: If an online entity did not author the content at issue, it cannot be liable for any harms flowing from that content.102 The defense provides uniform protection against any cause of action,103 which prevents plaintiffs from circumventing the defense through creative pleading.104 Because the defendant\u2019s scienter is irrelevant and the defense relies on facts often obvious on the face of the complaint (for example, who authored the relevant content), the defendants can often successfully assert the defense early, on the pleadings alone, and thereby avoid discovery and minimize litigation costs.105 And because the defense is grounded in federal, rather than\n101 See Zeran v.

See, e.g., City of Chicago v.

A Tripartite Statute in a Multipartite World\nDespite its continuing importance to the online world, Section 230 now shows its age. The 1996 statute is designed for an internet that functions to distribute third-party content. Like print and broadcast media distributors before them, online entities often serve as access points for vast stores of third-party-created content\u2014so vast that they could never hope to police their content.107 Section 230 adopts tort law\u2019s treatment of mass-media distributors and grants online entities broad federal immunity from claims related to third-party content.108\nTo do so, Section 230 divides the online world into three camps:109\n(1) \u201cinformation content provider[s],\u201d110 analogous to traditional publishers, who create informational content for internet readers; (2) providers of \u201cinteractive computer service[s],\u201d111 such as CompuServe, Prodigy, and, today, Verizon and Comcast, that provide users with the internet access necessary to read that informational content; and (3) users of \u201cinteractive computer service[s],\u201d112 the internet users who purchase internet access from an internet service provider and use that access to consume informational content made by online content creators.113\nIn such a neatly divisible virtual world, potential wrongdoers are easy to categorize. Any wrongdoing must be attributable to its active participants\u2014the internet content creators who author content\u2014not the passive internet service providers and their users who merely pro-\n106 Goldman, supra note 6, at 44.

R 109 Both the congressional findings supporting the enactment of Section 230 and its opera-\ntive provisions adopt a tripartite view of the internet.

R\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nvide access to and view that content. The solution seemed obvious and uncontroversial when Congress set about to undo the New York state trial court\u2019s questionable decision in Stratton Oakmont, which had permitted a claim against an internet service provider for defamatory content posted by a third party.114 Congress immunized the internet\u2019s passive participants from liability with Section 230, by mandating that none but an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d be held accountable for internet content.115\nThe problem is that the internet was never entirely publicationcentric or so neatly divisible. Today, it is even less so than it was in 1996. While Section 230 was being debated in Congress, e-commerce was starting to take root on the internet. Amazon.com sold its first book in July 1995,116 and AuctionWeb, later to become eBay, made its first sale just a few months later, in September 1995.117 These and other online entities quickly began to strain Section 230\u2019s tripartite framework, which is designed for a world comprised of content authors, transmitters, and readers\u2014not for the virtual world of e-commerce and online services.118 Categorizing all internet entities as either content authors, and potentially liable, or as nonauthors, and therefore immune, makes little sense when virtual world wrongdoing often involves no content creation at all. The dissonance between the virtual world and Section 230\u2019s tripartite, publishing-world structure has grown in the decades following the statute\u2019s enactment.119\n114 See Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Servs. Co., No. 031063/94, 1995 WL 323710 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 24, 1995), superseded by statute, Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d) of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, tit. V, 110 Stat. 56, 133\u201343 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230).\n115 Early courts then cemented this division by applying Section 230 broadly to bar all claims other than those against \u201ccontent providers,\u201d even where those claims are only tangentially related to any internet content.

Relatively few entities had websites, and the internet was small enough121 that search engines could still rely on human discovery and classification of pages rather than automated web crawlers.122 Google and even webmail were still years away.123 With many important interactive web development technologies yet to be invented or still in their infancy,124 websites tended to be merely static repositories from which users could retrieve informational content. A bank\u2019s website, for example, might include a page displaying its hours of operation, but it would have included no online banking functionality. Online banking was virtually unheard of, and almost all banking was still conducted at brick-and-mortar locations.125 With so few Americans online and so few options for those who were, the internet was used infrequently and consisted largely of websites targeted toward general audiences and acting as content-communication mecha-\n120 See Farhad Manjoo, Jurassic Web, SLATE (Feb. 24, 2009, 5:33 PM), https://slate.com/ technology/2009/02/the-unrecognizable-internet-of-1996.html [https://perma.cc/M3EC-BLQB].\n121 When Congress took up consideration of the CDA in 1995, the internet contained somewhere between 25,000 and 250,000 websites.

Even those Americans who had internet access spent fewer than thirty minutes per month online.126\nContrast that early static and content-driven internet with the interactive platforms and web services of today. In the decades since 1996, the percentage of Americans with internet access has risen tenfold, to almost ninety percent.127 Internet use worldwide has followed the same trend, to the point where by 2019, almost sixty percent of the world\u2019s 7.7 billion people were connected to the internet.128 As more and more internet users have come online, websites have become increasingly specialized. Meanwhile, advances in interactive web development and backend data storage and processing technologies have enabled a shift from the static information-repository-style websites common in the 1990s to the dynamic and interactive web services that users are familiar with today. Static content and information retrieval remain important,129 but today\u2019s internet is much more than that.\nGo to your bank\u2019s website today and you may still find a page displaying the hours during which you can visit the bank\u2019s physical locations.130 But there is almost never a need to do so because internet users can now conduct their banking transactions online.

This Part analyzes three categories of cases in which Section 230 is a poor fit for the modern internet. That analysis sets the stage to consider, in Part III, how Section 230 should be updated to account for recent technological changes."

In reality, an online entity can engage in a variety of activities for which it could face a multitude of legal claims. Eligibility for immunity is dependent on both the legal theory brought against it and the particular functionality being challenged. For example, although Facebook and eBay operate according to very different business models, both offer sales and messaging functionality, and their eligibility for immunity in a particular case would depend on the functionality being challenged and the theory alleged.

Did Snapchat exercise reasonable care in avoiding foreseeable harm to the plaintiffs,150 and was the product free from manufacturing, design, and labeling defects?151 But because Snapchat operates in the virtual world, Section 230 provides it with heightened protection.152\nIn the virtual world, regardless whether an online entity sells a defective product or exercises reasonable care, it can assert immunity under Section 230 on the ground that it did not author the content at issue. For example, in Lemmon v. Snap, Inc.,153 the plaintiff argued that Snapchat acted negligently by failing to redesign its speed filter despite numerous and widespread reports of motor vehicle accidents caused by teenage drivers using the speed filter while driving at high speeds to show off to their friends.154 Rather than consider Snapchat\u2019s design and level of care, however, the court dismissed the case as barred by Section 230 because Snapchat was not the author of any content.155 Courts have reached the same result in other cases involving alleged design defects in virtual products, reasoning that regardless of any negligence or defects, online entities are immune if they are not authors of the content in question.156\n149 Maynard, 816 S.E.2d at 81; Lemmon, 440 F. Supp. 3d at 1106. 150 See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIAB. FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6, 19 (AM. L. INST. 2005). 151 See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODS.

Cal. 2020). 154 See id. at 1105\u201307. 155 Specifically, the Lemmon court found that the Snapchat speed filter was not content at all, but rather a \u201ccontent-neutral tool.\u201d Id. at 1109\u201311. Therefore, the court reasoned that Snapchat could not be the author of any content and was immune from liability under Section 230(c)(1), which immunizes online entities from claims if they are not an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d of the relevant content.

Liability questions involving third-party actors are notoriously tricky. What these cases show, though, is how poorly suited Section 230 is for analyzing product-liability-type claims involving virtual products. First, content authorship is a poor test for potential culpability in this context. On the publication-centric internet of the past, nonauthors could safely be assumed to be benign content passthroughs; that is not true today.157 That an entity does not author content should not immunize it from claims that its products are negligently designed.\nSecond, Section 230\u2019s poor fit with products liability claims cannot be explained as a necessary sacrifice to further the chief aims of the statute\u2014preventing economically crippling duties to moderate and collateral censorship of user speech.158 In a lawsuit involving an allegedly defective product design, a plaintiff typically alleges not that the defendant should have more thoroughly\u2014and expensively\u2014moderated user-created content, but that it should have incorporated some safety feature into its product.159 Such a claim might threaten to impose extra costs on designers of virtual products, but not the insurmountable content-moderation burden Section 230 was designed to prevent. These ordinary tradeoffs between product safety, design, and development costs could be left to the same state negligence and product liability regimes that govern physical-world products."

But under Section 230\u2019s alternate, virtual-world regime, the case was resolved by a straightforward application of the statute\u2019s text.173 Backpage was immune from civil174 liability because all claims related to the sex trafficker\u2019s escort listings on Backpage involved \u201cinformation provided by [someone else]:\u201d175 \u201cWhatever Backpage\u2019s motivations, those motivations do not alter the fact that the complaint premises liability on the decisions that Backpage is making as a publisher with respect to third-party content.\u201d176 \u201c[S]hield[ing] Backpage from liability here is congruent with the case law elsewhere.\u201d177\nThe law treats online and offline marketplaces differently.

Volitional Wrongs\nA final category of problematic cases is those involving volitional wrongs. Volitional is not meant to imply a specific mental state. Instead, it refers more generally to any conduct that is wrongful because of some knowledge or intent on the part of the defendant beyond that of a passive intermediary. Because Section 230 was designed for a world of passive content intermediaries, it does not consider an online entity\u2019s knowledge or intent.184 Passive intermediaries merely convey the content of others, and holding them responsible for that content could impose a crippling content-moderation burden and spur them to censor user content.185 Thus, under Section 230, if the entity is not an author of content, it is immune from liability for harms that result from that content.186 But online entities often do more than act as passive intermediaries. And because Section 230\u2019s trigger for withholding immunity is content authorship, online entities can be immune under the law despite knowledge of or even intent to cause harms.\nFor example, in Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc.,187 the Ninth Circuit considered a claim brought by a plaintiff whose former boyfriend sought revenge for their breakup by creating fake profiles under her name in which he included her contact information and nude photographs that had been taken without her knowledge.188 Soon after, the plaintiff received a barrage of emails, phone calls, and in-person visits from men she did not know, all with the expectation of sex.189 The plaintiff contacted Yahoo to remove the profiles, and Yahoo directed her to submit an official removal request by mail with a copy of her photo ID.190 After more than a month and sending two more mailings, the profiles remained online, and the plaintiff had received no response.191 Finally, one day before a local news station broadcasted a report regarding the\nmaterial contribution standard \u201cmakes legal challenges to intermediaries\u2019 designs especially difficult to win\u201d).\n184 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c)(1); see also, e.g., Daniel v.

But in this case, Yahoo did more than fail to detect an unlawful third-party post. It expressly acknowledged the unlawful profiles, promised that it would remove them, and then carelessly failed to follow through.195 Given its knowledge, no mass filtering or needle-in-a-haystack search was required. Nonetheless, Section 230 barred the plaintiff\u2019s claim because Yahoo\u2019s actions related to content authored by a third party.196\nIn the physical world, tort law distinguishes between two types of cases. On one hand, bookstores, libraries, and other entities that merely provide access to content authored by others are not ordinarily subject to defamation liability, for \u201cit would be an unreasonable burden to require [such entities] to make the investigation necessary\u201d197 to evaluate all of the content they distribute. On the other hand, however, such entities can be subject to liability if they know or have reason to know that particular content is defamatory.198 By treating these two situations differently, defamation law provides liability protection to entities that need it\u2014those that would otherwise face an unreasonable content moderation burden\u2014while still allowing claims against entities whose specific knowledge removes the burden to moderate content.199\n192 Id. at 1098\u201399. 193 Id. at 1099. 194 Id. 195 See id. 196 Id. at 1102\u201303. 197 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 581 cmt. f (AM.

            "text": "For decades now, Section 230 has been treated as sacred. Industry leaders, joined by prominent legal scholars, have presented a united voice, warning that changes to the statute would undermine the American tech industry and the internet as we know it.205 But as the internet has continued to evolve beyond publication into an ever more complete virtual world, Section 230\u2019s mismatch with the modern internet has become hard to ignore. Indeed, views have shifted to the point where Section 230 now finds itself in the crosshairs of legal scholars and both major political parties. Reform proposals can be grouped into three categories.\n1. Recent Proposals for Reform\nFirst, one group of proposals would remove immunity protection where an entity intentionally facilitates unlawful conduct. Some such proposals focus on stripping immunity from the most egregious offenders: those online entities that intentionally facilitate criminal behavior. For example, a recent Department of Justice review of Section 230 concluded that a \u201cBad Samaritan\u201d carve out206 should be added to the statute to ensure that online entities that purposefully solicit \u201cthird parties to sell illegal drugs to minors, exchange child sexual\n204 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(a)\u2013(b). 205 See, e.g., Elliot Harmon, FOSTA Would Be a Disaster for Online Communities, ELEC.

TECH. L. & POL\u2019Y 123, 126 (2010).\n206 See DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at 14. In recommending a Bad R Samaritan carve out, DOJ referenced Daniel, noting that, in that case, the website that facilitated the sale of a firearm to a prohibited person \u201cwas immune under Section 230, despite allegations that [the] website was intentionally designed with the specific purpose of skirting federal firearm laws.\u201d Id.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nabuse material,\u201d or engage in other unlawful activities through their platforms \u201cdo not benefit from Section 230\u2019s sweeping immunity at the expense of their victims.\u201d207 In a similar vein, Congress specifically targeted intentional unlawful conduct in 2018 when it enacted the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (\u201cFOSTA\u201d)208 in response to the First Circuit\u2019s Backpage.com decision.209 Among other things, FOSTA authorized private actions against websites for facilitating sex trafficking by \u201cpublishing information designed to facilitate sex trafficking\u201d210 and prevented websites from invoking Section 230(c)(1) to escape liability by adding subsection (e)(5), which specifically excludes violators from protection.211\nOther reform proposals also look to an entity\u2019s intentionality, but would exclude from immunity not only those entities that intentionally facilitate unlawful conduct, but also those that intentionally form cooperative\u2014and typically profitable\u2014relationships with third-party wrongdoers.212 For example, in her forthcoming article, Agnieszka McPeak argues that Section 230 should incorporate joint enterprise liability theory to ensure that sharing-economy facilitators like Uber and Amazon cannot avoid liability for harms caused by their businesses by characterizing themselves as mere online intermediaries between customers and freelance workers or third-party sellers.213 Such approaches expand potential liability beyond the most egregious abuses, but still limit the moderation burden they impose on entities by permitting liability only where an entity has a heightened mental\n207 DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at 14; see also Tushnet, supra note 6, R at 1009\u201310 (arguing that Section 230 immunity should include limits on an intermediary\u2019s power to control speech, including where an online intermediary deliberately induces the creation of unlawful content for financial gain); Stacey Dogan, Principled Standards vs. Boundless Discretion: A Tale of Two Approaches to Intermediary Trademark Liability Online, 37 COLUM.

R\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nstate of intentionality, either as to the wrongful conduct itself, or the cooperative relationship out of which it arose.214\nSecond, another set of proposals would deny Section 230 immunity where an online entity has actual knowledge of unlawful content on its platform. Reform proposals of this sort are modeled after the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\u2019s (\u201cDMCA\u201d)215 notice-and-takedown procedure216 and would deny Section 230 immunity to entities that continue to provide access to unlawful content or facilitate unlawful behavior despite actual knowledge of the content or behavior.217 Such a rule would be analogous to the common-law principle, discussed earlier,218 under which bookstores and other media distributors lose immunity from defamation claims if they have actual or constructive knowledge of defamatory content. And, as with physical-world distributors, notice- or knowledge-based limitations on immunity avoid imposing a burden on entities to proactively screen all thirdparty content.\nThird, a final group of proposals would focus on an entity\u2019s platform-policing practices in general, rather than its response to the particular piece of content that precipitated a plaintiff\u2019s alleged harms. Danielle Citron and Benjamin Wittes, for example, have proposed amending Section 230 to require that an entity take \u201creasonable steps to prevent or address unlawful uses of its services\u201d to be eligible for\n214 Cf. DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at 14\u201315 (recommending \u201cBad R Samaritan\u201d carve out that includes a \u201cheightened mens rea, such as \u2018purposefully,\u2019 under which platforms that accidentally or even negligently facilitate unlawful behavior would not lose immunity\u201d so that the carve out would not \u201cimpose a burden on platforms to proactively screen all third-party content\u201d).\n215 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Pub.

Rustad & Thomas H. Koenig, Rebooting Cybertort Law, 80 WASH. L. REV. 335 (2005) (suggesting no immunity where an entity has actual notice of ongoing unlawful activity); Tushnet, supra note 6, at R 1010 (noting immunity could be denied where an entity refuses to remove content if the original speaker has conceded liability); see also DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at R 17\u201318 (proposing carve out from Section 230 immunity where an entity has actual knowledge of criminal material and citing M.A. ex rel.

Mo. 2011), which held Backpage immune under Section 230 despite allegation that entity had actual knowledge of child sex trafficking on its website).\n218 See supra Section I.C.2.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nimmunity.219 Making immunity contingent on entities\u2019 practices as a whole could encourage industry organizations to develop best practices for policing online content and foster a business culture more attuned to the harms caused by the technologies they deploy. Reasonable policing practices could be defined either abstractly, via a reasonableness standard like that proposed by Citron and Wittes, or could be particularized via statutory or regulatory mandate.220 A reasonableness standard would provide courts flexibility to adapt Section 230 for new contexts and different types of entities,221 whereas particularized regulations would provide entities greater certainty ex ante regarding whether their practices would qualify them for immunity.\n2. Reform Risks and Limitations\nAlthough momentum for change is building, legislators have been rightly cautious. Because the statute is so broad, changes could have major effects on the tech industry. Some fear that altering Section 230\u2019s protections might even endanger the United States\u2019 position as a worldwide innovation leader.222 Successfully reforming Section 230 requires navigating at least three potential obstacles: the difficulty of creating a single, unitary framework to govern all internet conduct; the risk of increased uncertainty and compliance costs associated with a more flexible rule; and the risk of increased litigation expenses in the technology industry.\nThe first obstacle is the difficulty of crafting a single rule or set of rules to govern the entire virtual world. On the publication-centric internet of 1996, internet wrongdoers could be identified with a simple\n219 See Citron & Wittes, supra note 25, at 419. R 220 Two Brobdingnagianly titled bills proposed this year would take the particularized regu-\nlatory approach. First, the EARN IT Act of 2020 would amend Section 230 to allow civil suits against companies that recklessly distribute child pornography while simultaneously providing for a set of best practices to be developed by a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention to be established for the purpose. See Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (\u201cEARN IT\u201d) Act of 2020, S. 3398, 116th Cong. (2020). Second, the SHOP SAFE Act of 2020 would introduce a similar best practices safe harbor from liability for trademark infringement. See Stopping Harmful Offers on Platforms by Screening Against Fakes in E-commerce (\u201cSHOP SAFE\u201d) Act of 2020, H.R. 6058, 116th Cong. (2020).\n221 For example, internet service providers and social networks that provide access to millions of user posts per day cannot plausibly respond to all complaints of abuse immediately. But they might be able to deploy algorithms that can automatically detect and remove certain types of unlawful content, such as child pornography or copyright infringing content that has previously been deemed unlawful. See Klonick, supra note 5, at 1635\u201337. The duty of care would vary R by entity type and size and require more of online entities as technology improves.\n222 See Goldman, supra note 6, at 33\u201334; KOSSEFF, supra note 12, at 278\u201380. But see Paul R Ohm, We Couldn\u2019t Kill the Internet if We Tried, 130 HARV. L. REV. F. 79 (2016).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\ntest: Did the entity author content?223 Designing an immunity rule for today\u2019s internet is much more difficult, where it must govern not only traditional content intermediaries but also the full gamut of other human social and economic activity, including digital product manufacturers, online marketplaces, and the harms that come with them. Given the broad range of wrongful conduct on the modern internet, reform proposals tend to focus on a specific category of wrongdoing\u2014 for example, websites that intentionally facilitate criminal activity224\u2014 or rely on reasonableness or multifactor tests that are flexible enough to apply in a variety of contexts.225 Even such targeted and flexible approaches, though, have their limitations. For example, creating a carve out from Section 230 immunity for intentional or knowing wrongdoing would still leave unaddressed Section 230\u2019s special treatment of online entities facing reasonable care or strict liability claims, such as ordinary negligence or products liability. It is difficult for a single rule to reproduce the full range of standards applicable in all areas of the law.\nA second obstacle to reform is closely related to the first. Internet immunity doctrine can be made more flexible by introducing carve outs or by adding a reasonableness or mens rea requirement, but adding that flexibility also introduces greater uncertainty ex ante and increases compliance costs.226 One way to see the problem is as an instance of the familiar question of rules versus standards: Should internet immunity be governed by a highly specific, bright line rule or by a more open-ended standard?227 The choice is subject to the usual tradeoffs. Rules promote uniformity, predictability, and low decision\n223 See supra Sections I.C.3, II.A\u2013.C. 224 See, e.g., DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at 14\u201318 (proposing sev- R\neral specific carve outs from Section 230 immunity to exclude intentional facilitation of criminal wrongdoing; actual knowledge of content that violates federal criminal law or court judgments; and failure to take precautions to prevent terrorism, child sex abuse, or cyberstalking).\n225 See, e.g., Citron & Wittes, supra note 25, at 419 (proposing that Section 230 be amended R to require entities take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent or address unlawful uses of their services); McPeak, supra note 23 (manuscript at 34) (suggesting that courts incorporate tort law\u2019s joint R enterprise theory of vicarious liability to add nuance to the \u201ccurrent binary classification\u201d of entities as either intermediaries or content providers).\n226 Eric Goldman makes this point in a recent essay comparing Section 230 and First Amendment doctrine. See Goldman, supra note 6, at 45\u201346.

In theory, a heightened mental state requirement would relieve entities from any obligation to proactively screen third-party content because they could face liability only for content they intended or of which they were at least aware.231 The reality, however, would be more complicated. First, courts deem corporate defendants to possess \u201cknowledge\u201d of information even if it is buried within their files or email systems and unknown to the entities\u2019 actual decision makers.232 The burden of assessing what they collectively know or intend could lead organizations to adopt more stringent censorship policies to minimize the risk of liability from information technically within their spheres of knowledge. Second, tying liability to knowledge could have undesirable effects on entities\u2019 use of content-flagging mechanisms. Knowledge-based liability might chill user speech by leading platforms to automatically take down, without investigation, any content even reported as objectionable\u2014a problem known as the \u201checkler\u2019s veto.\u201d233\n228 See Kaplow, supra note 227, at 596\u2013620. R 229 See supra Section I.C.2. 230 See Goldman, supra note 6, at 45\u201346 (\u201cSection 230\u2019s agnosticism about defendant scien- R ter is a key element of its success.\u201d). 231 DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at 14.

For example, replacing Section 230\u2019s content-authorship test with a different but similarly bright line rule would limit uncertainty-driven censorship of user speech, as would employing an objective standard of care234 rather than a mental state inquiry. Regardless of the particular approach, however, the key point is that because they can alter existing incentives for entities to police online content, reforms that add flexibility to Section 230\u2019s immunity rule must be carefully designed to ensure they do not undermine the statute\u2019s speech-enhancing objectives.\nFinally, a third obstacle to reform is the effect that changes to internet immunity doctrine could have on litigation expenses in the tech industry. As currently designed, Section 230 provides online entities with both substantive and procedural protections beyond those of physical-world entities.235 Substantively, online entities are protected from any legal obligation to review and moderate third-party con-\ndown, heckling, threatening, or otherwise harassing the speaker); see also Reno v.

However, unlike changes to Section 230\u2019s substance\u2014that is, changes that would require entities to moderate user-created content\u2014measured changes to Section 230\u2019s procedural efficiency would increase costs but not threaten the viability of internet entities\u2019 basic business models.

That includes retailers, product manufacturers, and mass media distributors and publishers, who, like many online entities, transact business with and distribute content to millions of individuals every day. Even if Section 230 were removed altogether, online entities would still have available all the traditional defenses of physical-world entities.

If Section 230 is to be updated, however, changes must be carefully structured to account for the concerns raised in the previous section. Specifically, a revised Section 230 must (1) be flexible enough to govern the wide variety of entities and conduct that now occur in the virtual world; (2) continue to protect online entities against the burden to moderate third-party content, which could lead them to proactively censor their users\u2019 speech to mitigate the risk of legal liability; and (3) be designed with procedural efficiency in mind to limit litigation costs incurred by online entities in asserting the defense.\nTaking these goals as guideposts for reform, this Article proposes that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c)(1) be revised as follows to narrow Section 230 immunity to only those claims that would impose a content-moderation burden on online entities by requiring them to review and moderate third-party created content:\nNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider in any action in which prevention of the alleged harm would require the provider or user of the interactive computer service to review and moderate information provided by another information content provider.\nWith this revision, online entities would continue to enjoy robust immunity against those claims that would undercut freedom of expression by imposing impossible burdens on them to review user content. But by tailoring immunity to only those claims in which it is required to avoid the collateral censorship concern,245 the reform would free\n244 See supra Section I.C.3. 245 Rather than focusing on collateral censorship and the difficulty of moderating content to prevent the alleged harm, some courts consider whether the platform offered \u201cneutral tools\u201d to its users.

Recordings, LLC, 755 F.3d 398, 410\u201311 (6th Cir. 2014) (applying neutral tools test and reasoning that a \u201cmaterial contribution to the alleged illegality of the content does not mean merely taking action that is necessary to the display of allegedly illegal content[,] [but] [r]ather, it means being responsible for what makes the displayed content allegedly unlawful\u201d). When the Ninth Circuit created the neutral tools test in Roommates.com, it may have been reasoning from first principles that entities should not be liable unless they sufficiently \u201ccontribute to [the] alleged illegality,\u201d 521 F.3d 1157, 1169 (9th Cir. 2008), or it may have been borrowing from the \u201cmaterial contribution\u201d and \u201cstaple article of commerce\u201d doctrines, which protect manufacturers of products with substantial noninfringing uses from indirect copyright infringement claims. See 3 MELVILLE B. NIMMER & DAVID NIMMER, NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT \u00a7 12.04 (1991) (discussing limitations on indirect copyright liability). Either way, the reasoning is inappropriate when evaluating an affirmative defense under Section 230. The statute does not bar claims against insufficient contributors, only claims that\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nthe courts to treat online and offline entities equally in other contexts, including some of the cases discussed above involving product liability, online marketplaces, and volitional wrongdoing.246 This approach would also account for many of the risks and limitations that have hindered reform efforts.\n1. Flexibility for a National Problem\nOne significant obstacle to internet immunity reform is the extreme breadth of the modern internet. The virtual world now encompasses nearly every variety of human conduct, making it difficult to develop a single rule to govern it.247 Such a law must handle everything from publication-centric claims like defamation to other tort claims sounding in negligence, fraud, or product liability, and civil claims involving antitrust or criminal statutes. Indeed, to be truly comprehensive, internet immunity doctrine must account for every possible claim in the collective statutory and common law of the federal government and all fifty states.\nGiven the enormity of this task, many reform proposals have focused on narrow carve outs that correct Section 230\u2019s treatment of one category of especially problematic claims, for example, intentional facilitation of criminal wrongdoing.248 Another possibility is to invoke an extremely flexible principle, such as reasonableness, that courts or a regulatory body can update with the times and tailor to suit particular contexts.249 As discussed above, each of these approaches has advantages and limitations.250\nA third possibility is that, given the need for flexibility in this area, control over the question of online intermediary liability should be returned to the state common law system. Common law decision making has the advantage of greater flexibility over statutory law.251 And a common-law system would have the ability to adapt with the internet as it continues to evolve in the coming years. Moreover, as\nwould impose a content-moderation burden on an online entity by treating it as a publisher or speaker. Where those concerns are not implicated, the sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to support a cognizable claim should be assessed under the third-party liability principles of the relevant state or federal law, not Section 230.\n246 See supra Section II.B. 247 See supra Section III.A.2. 248 See, e.g., DOJ Section 230 Recommendations, supra note 22, at 14\u201318. R 249 See, e.g., Citron & Wittes, supra note 25, at 419. R 250 See supra Section III.A. 251 See Linkins v. Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Found., 187 F.2d 357, 360\u201361 (D.C. Cir.\n1950) (\u201c[T]he very term \u2018common law\u2019 means a system of law not formalized by legislative action, not solidified but capable of growth and development at the hands of judges.\u201d).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\ndiscussed earlier252 and detailed by Brent Skorup and Jennifer Huddleston in their recent article,253 the Section 230 regime enacted by Congress and interpreted by the courts is not a dramatic departure from the common-law rules that govern traditional publishers and distributors.254\nThe common law\u2019s organic adaption to the early internet255 and its continuing able governance of the physical world of newspapers, books, pamphlets, radio, and television suggest that, with time, internet media could safely be added to its domain and that, as with those media, the law would gradually come to account for the specific and evolving nuances of internet technology. Indeed, that may be exactly how Congress envisioned the law would unfold when it enacted Section 230.256 Despite the flexibility advantage of a common law system, however, a few factors counsel against such a transition. First, there would be the usual upfront costs of switching to a new regime. Internet entities would need to assess the new law\u2019s impact on their existing and future operations, and courts would be tasked with creating a new body of decisional law. These latter costs would be unusually high, as courts would need to instantly account for current technology despite a decades-long gap in the case law.\nSecond, returning internet immunity law to the state courts would forfeit the benefits of a uniform legal framework to govern an important, interstate issue.257 Even now, of course, jurisdictional splits over the interpretation of Section 230 are possible, but in practice courts\n252 See supra Section I.C.2. 253 Skorup & Huddleston, supra note 96. R 254 See id. at 637\u201346. 255 See KOSSEFF, supra note 12, at 36\u201356 (discussing courts\u2019 capable, pre\u2013Section 230 com- R\nmon-law analysis of online intermediary liability). 256 Section 230 came into being as part of the CDA and was intended primarily\u2014and, arguably, exclusively\u2014to encourage self-censorship through Section 230(c)(2)\u2019s grant of absolute immunity to entities who engaged in good-faith censorship efforts. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(b). If, as some argue was Congress\u2019s intent, Section 230(c)(2) had been interpreted as the only operative portion of Section 230, all instances of non\u2013self-censorship\u2014that is, the majority of the modern internet\u2014would have continued to be governed by print-media common law. See Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, 660 (7th Cir. 2003) (offering in dicta that perhaps Section 230(c)(1) should be read as a definitional clause and only Section 230(c)(2)\u2019s Good Samaritan provision be read to confer immunity); Citron & Wittes, supra note 25, at 403 (interpreting Section 230\u2019s legislative R history to support only Good Samaritan immunity, not broad intermediary immunity).\n257 The question is similar to the ongoing debate regarding whether privacy law should be governed at the state or federal level. California\u2019s adoption of the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1798.100\u2013.199 (West 2020), which applies even to entities outside of California\u2019s borders, has spurred calls for the federal government to enact federal privacy legislation to preempt state law on the subject and create a uniform national standard. See Tony Romm, The Lobbying War Over California\u2019s Landmark Privacy Law, WASH. POST, Feb. 9, 2019, at A15.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nacross the country have converged on most issues, and there are relatively few differences between jurisdictions. Were the question governed by state common law rather than federal statutory law, the economic costs of multijurisdictional compliance would be significant.\nRecognizing this problem, this Article\u2019s approach would leave in place a federal statutory immunity regime to set a baseline immunity defense for online entities against all state or federal claims that implicate content moderation. As they are now, states would be free to provide online entities more protection from claims brought under their laws, but as a preemptive federal defense, Section 230 would continue to provide a baseline level of immunity.\nTo build flexibility into Section 230, while still providing baseline federal protections, the proposed approach avoids relying on particular mental states or categories of wrongs and instead trims the scope of immunity to its bare essentials\u2014claims requiring content moderation and risking collateral censorship. By allowing all other claims to proceed freely, this approach can rely on the existing body of state and federal law to fill in the requisite mental states and elements required for a plaintiff to make out a claim, whether it be negligence, product liability, civil conspiracy, or something else.\n2. Moderation and Collateral Censorship\nThis proposal also avoids interfering with the content-moderation and collateral-censorship protections that Section 230 was designed to create. To capture the most egregious wrongdoing by online entities, such as Backpage\u2019s allegedly intentional facilitation of child sex trafficking, some reform proposals have suggested limiting immunity in cases that involve intentional or knowing wrongdoing.258 Although these proposals might achieve their goal, there is a risk that adding a scienter component to the Section 230 analysis would recreate the collateral censorship concern. Plaintiffs could plead intent or knowledge without factual support, and online entities might preemptively censor user speech or immediately remove all flagged content to avoid that risk.259\nRather than inquire into a defendant\u2019s mental state, however, this proposal would instead tie immunity to an objective rule. Online entities would be immune from any claim that would require them to review and moderate third-party-created content. Far from exacerbating\n258 See supra Section III.A.1. 259 See Goldman, supra note 6, at 38, 45. R\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nthe collateral censorship concern, this proposal would reduce it, by introducing express language into the statute to guard against any judicial interpretation that might read Section 230 to permit a claim predicated260 on a failure to censor third-party speech.\n3. Limiting Litigation Costs\nFinally, this proposal would update Section 230 without dramatically increasing the cost of asserting the defense in litigation. Under the current regime, when a defendant asserts a Section 230 defense, courts are typically able to resolve that defense by pretrial motion where it is clear from the complaint that there is no dispute that the plaintiff\u2019s claim would make an online entity responsible for content authored by a third party.261 Similarly, even where there is some allegation that the defendant was a cocreator of the content at issue, courts are often able to decide Section 230 issues pretrial on a motion for summary judgment following limited discovery.262 Were Section 230 modified to incorporate a mental state analysis or compliance with a specified standard of care, this procedural benefit would be lost.\nTo avoid unnecessarily diminishing Section 230\u2019s procedural benefits, the proposed approach relies on an objective test that will often be resolvable on the pleadings alone or following limited discovery. Just as, under the current rule, it is often clear on the face of a complaint whether the defendant online entity, rather than some third party, authored the content in question, under the proposed rule it\n260 Sometimes multiple approaches will be available to prevent complained of harms, some of which impose a content-moderation burden and others of which do not. In such cases, Section 230 would bar only those theories that would impose a content-moderation burden. For example, were an entity to develop an app to connect medical patients with third-party physicians and host virtual appointments, a patient harmed by errant medical guidance could assert a negligence claim against the entity for failing to verify her physician\u2019s license to practice medicine, but not for failing to review the quality of medical guidance provided. The reasonableness of the entity\u2019s practices regarding validation of participant physicians\u2019 credentials would then be assessed under state tort law.\n261 See, e.g., E. Coast Test Prep, LLC v. Allnurses.com, Inc., 971 F.3d 747, 752 (8th Cir. 2020) (affirming grant of motion for judgment on the pleadings under Section 230 in action brought by test prep company against platform that hosted negative user reviews despite plaintiff\u2019s implausible allegation that the platform had intentionally solicited the negative reviews).\n262 See, e.g., Frontier Van Lines Moving & Storage, Inc. v. Valley Sols., Inc., No. 11CV0526, 2011 WL 2110825, at *5 (W.D. Pa. May 24, 2011) (ordering limited discovery on Section 230 immunity issue \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d); see also Novak v. Overture Servs., Inc., 309 F. Supp. 2d 446, 452 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (explaining that Section 230 immunity is \u201cgenerally addressed as a Rule 12(c) [post-answer motion for judgment on the pleadings] or Rule 56 motion [for summary judgment].\u201d).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nwould often be clear whether preventing the complained of harm would have required the entity to review and moderate content created by another party.\nA leading case brought against the online review aggregator Yelp is a good example. In Kimzey v. Yelp!, Inc.,263 the owner of a locksmith business asserted libel, unfair competition, and RICO264 claims against Yelp based on two negative reviews that were posted about his business on the platform.265 The plaintiff argued that their business had been harmed by the posts and that Yelp was responsible for those harms because it created the star-based rating metric used by its reviewers and caused the statements to appear not only on its own site, but also as part of a promotion on Google\u2019s search engine.266 Because the claim predicated liability on content authored by a third-party, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action under Section 230 for failure to state a cognizable claim.267\nThe result would be the same under the proposed reform. Yelp acts as an aggregator and passthrough for customers to write and post reviews about their experiences with businesses.268 To prevent the harm of which the Kimzey plaintiff complained, Yelp would need to review and determine the truth or falsity of the third-party reviews hosted on its platform. A court could handily resolve such a claim on a motion to dismiss under either standard."

Rather than ask by whom content is authored, a court would ask whether preventing the harms suffered by the plaintiff would have required Snapchat to review and moderate information provided by a third party. In Lemmon, the answer was no. The plaintiff alleged not that Snapchat was negligent in failing to identify and censor damaging communications, but that the speed filter component of its app was defectively designed.273 Applying the suggested reform, a court would deny Section 230 immunity and consider the cognizability of the claim under state negligence or product liability law, just as it would with a physical-world product.\nThe same would be true for many claims against online marketplaces, another context where Section 230 currently creates a disparity between online and offline entities.274 Consider the Backpage.com decision.275 In that case, a group of three underage girls who had been advertised for sale on the Backpage website brought a statutory sextrafficking conspiracy claim276 under the federal TVPRA.277 Even though the plaintiffs alleged that Backpage had designed its website to facilitate and profit from sex trafficking and that it had taken specific, intentional actions to thwart law-enforcement efforts (by removing posts connected with police sting operations and wiping metadata from escort photos), Section 230 immunized Backpage from liability\n270 See supra Section II.A. 271 See Lemmon v.

Backpage.com, LLC, 817 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2016). 276 See Backpage Complaint, supra note 163, at \u00b6\u00b6 108\u201314. R 277 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101\u20137114.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nbecause the sex traffickers, not Backpage, authored the online listings.278\nUnder the proposed reform, however, the plaintiffs would have been free to pursue their claim against Backpage because they alleged that Backpage participated in the sex-trafficking conspiracy not by failing to review and remove offending posts, but by implementing platform features designed to profit from sex trafficking and avoid detection by law enforcement. Applying the suggested reform, a court would have denied Section 230 immunity and proceeded to consider the claim under the TVPRA.\nFinally, it is important to discuss a few key scenarios that would, and should, remain unaffected by the proposed reform. Recall the earlier discussion of cases involving volitional wrongs, where an online entity\u2019s conduct is wrongful because of some knowledge of or even intent to cause harms.279 Because Section 230 looks only to content authorship, an online entity can be immune from liability even in cases of volitional wrongdoing.\nAlthough it may be tempting to withhold immunity in such contexts, doing so could undermine Section 230\u2019s key objectives. Consider the content-flagging mechanisms available on many apps and online platforms, which give users an easy way to notify the online entity of problematic content. Content-flagging mechanisms are a good thing. They make it easier for users to report and easier for entities to find and remove unlawful content. But they do not make it costless. Indeed, online platforms receive so many alerts that reviewing the flagged content itself poses a significant moderation burden, despite the knowledge of the content and its potentially problematic character.280 Knowledge-based liability could lead to collateral censorship, as platforms might take down any content reported as objectionable, without investigation, to avoid the risk of liability or the burden of moderating content.281\nClaims of volitional wrongdoing would be allowed to proceed, however, where they would not require an online entity to review and moderate content. The Barnes case is a good example. In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s former boyfriend created fake online profiles under her\n278 See Backpage.com, 817 F.3d at 16\u201317, 22. 279 See supra Section II.B. 280 See Naughton, supra note 202; see also Goldman, supra note 6, at 38\u201341 (explaining that R\na knowledge-based liability rule is equivalent to a notice-and-takedown rule because the economically rational response to complaints would be to remove the challenged content without investigation).\n281 See Wu, supra note 6, at 295\u201396. R\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792\nname in order to induce strangers to proposition her for sex.282 Under the proposed reform, Yahoo would be immune from claims related to its failure to detect and remove the fake profiles, even once those profiles were flagged. But after Yahoo contacted the plaintiff to tell her it would remove the profiles,283 it could be liable for its continuing failure to do so. Following through on its promise to remove a piece of content would not require additional content moderation.\nThe proposed reform would thus bring the online and offline world into closer, if not complete, alignment. Tailoring internet immunity doctrine narrowly to address its core content moderation and collateral censorship concerns would update Section 230 to account for the internet\u2019s evolution over the last twenty years, while still protecting against the very real concerns that motivated the statute\u2019s enactment.\nCONCLUSION\nCurrent immunity doctrine is based on an outdated, mass-mediainspired understanding of the internet that is ill-suited to govern the diverse collection of entities that populates the online world today. Rather than merely relay information and communications, modern websites allow people to do everything from romantic matchmaking to coordinating transportation networks, booking vacation packages, and selling used kitchen appliances. Section 230\u2019s outdated conception of the internet has created a disparity between the law\u2019s treatment of online versus offline entities and produced calls for reform across the political spectrum. This Article lays the groundwork for Congress and the courts to reform internet immunity doctrine, bring the law\u2019s treatment of the virtual and physical worlds into alignment, and treat like cases alike wherever they occur.\n282 See Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1098\u201399 (9th Cir. 2009). 283 See id.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3733792"
