    "abstractText": "Obesity in children and adolescents has increased globally. Increased body mass index (BMI) during adolescence carries significant long-term adverse health outcomes, including chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Little is known about the metabolic consequences of changes in BMI in adolescents outside of typical clinical parameters. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to assess changing BMI in male adolescents. Untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on urine samples from 360 adolescents using UPLC\u2013QTOF-MS. The study includes a baseline of 235 subjects in a discovery set and 125 subjects in a validation set. Of them, a follow-up of 81 subjects (1 year later) as a replication set was studied. Linear regression analysis models were used to estimate the associations of metabolic features with BMI z-score in the discovery and validation sets, after adjusting for age, race, and total energy intake (kcal) at false-discovery-rate correction (FDR) \u2264 0.1. We identified 221 and 16 significant metabolic features in the discovery and in the validation set, respectively. The metabolites associated with BMI z-score in validation sets are glycylproline, citrulline, 4-vinylsyringol, 3\u2032-sialyllactose, estrone sulfate, carnosine, formiminoglutamic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxyprolyl-asparagine, 2-hexenoylcarnitine, L-glutamine, inosine, N-(2-Hydroxyphenyl) acetamide glucuronide, and galactosylhydroxylysine. Of those 16 features, 9 significant metabolic features were associated with a positive change in BMI in the replication set 1 year later. Histidine and arginine metabolism were the most affected metabolic pathways. Our findings suggest that obesity and its metabolic outcomes in the urine metabolome of children are linked to altered amino acids, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. These identified metabolites may serve as biomarkers and aid in the investigation of obesity\u2019s underlying pathological mechanisms. Whether these features are associated with the development of obesity, or a consequence of changing BMI, requires further study.",

            "text": "More than 379 million children and adolescents worldwide are overweight or obese [1]. In the United States from 2017 to 2020, the prevalence of obesity was 19.7% in the age group of 2\u201319 years and affected about 14.7 million children and adolescents [2]. Up to 80% of obese children become obese adults, indicating that childhood obesity typically extends into adulthood [3]. Obesity is a common, serious, and multifactorial disease associated with genetics [4], environment [5], physiology [6], increased consumption of hypercaloric foods [7], and sedentary lifestyles [8]. Increased body mass index (BMI) and obesity during adolescence carry significant long-term adverse health outcomes, including the development of chronic diseases and mortality, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, insulin resistance diabetes, and cancer [9\u201313]. Therefore, efficient interventions and predictive biomarkers for the development of obesity are needed. As children grow, the assessment of body mass index (BMI) requires adjustment for age and gender [14]. While a study of BMI typically categorizes adolescents as normal, overweight, or obese based on BMI percentile [15,16], a better measure of body mass index is the BMI z-score as a continuous variable because the BMI z-score is age and gender-specific [17]. In this study, we used the BMI z-score to investigate the association between the urinary metabolome and obesity. Untargeted metabolomics profiles low-molecular-weight metabolites (<1500 Da) in biospecimens to elucidate cell physiology and disease mechanisms, and to identify biomarkers of disease risk [18,19]. This approach helps identify the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases, as well as for disease monitoring and risk assessment. In the past, targeted and untargeted metabolomics studies have been used to study the metabolome signature of obesity in response to dietary intake [20], the effects of specific dietary patterns or weight loss [21,22] or gain interventions, and body fat (%) [23]. In our comprehensive literature review, we identified 41 studies on adolescent metabolomics and obesity [10]. Out of the total studies, 33 specifically focused on blood (plasma, serum), 3 studies examined umbilical cord blood, and 1 study used saliva samples, while 6 studies utilized urine samples [10,24\u201329]. Urine contains diverse metabolites reflecting the overall metabolic status of an individual, offering a comprehensive view of obesity-related changes including the excretion of metabolites derived from various biological processes [30]. Unlike plasma and serum, urine is less affected by factors such as diet, medication, or circadian rhythms [31]. Metabolomics studies in adolescent populations are still limited. To gain a deeper understanding of obesity\u2019s development, it is essential to validate previous research and examine metabolic changes in obese children who have not yet manifested disease symptoms. Here, we examined the association of adolescent urinary metabolic signature with BMI z-scores to investigate the mechanisms of progression of childhood obesity at a metabolite level, which may aid in identifying adverse effects of obesity. This is the largest study of untargeted metabolomics in adolescents and is strengthened by longitudinal assessment."

In the resulting mzML files, intensity and m/z values were stored as 32-bit floating points with zlib compression, and the \u201cvendor peak picking\u201d option was selected to convert data to centroid mode. The mzML files were imported into the R statistical computing environment using the R package XCMS [39]. XCMS was used for data processing including retention time alignment, peak detection, peak grouping, and peak filling to obtain a sample-feature matrix. Retention time alignment was performed using the ObiWarp algorithm. Each\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 899 5 of 23\nsample was aligned against the pooled QC sample in both EIC+ and EIC\u2212modes. Peak detection was performed using the CentWave algorithm (parameters: peak width = 2\u201330 s, signal-to-noise ratio = 3, mzdiff = \u22120.005, integration method = 1, prefilter = 3 peaks, 10 intensity). Peak grouping was performed using the peak density method (parameters: minFraction = 0, minSamples = 2, bw = 5, binSize = 0.015). Integration of signal from peaks missing after grouping peaks across samples was performed with the fillChromPeaks function and default parameters (expandMz = 0, expandRt = 0, ppm = 0, fixedMz = 0, fixedRt = 0). The resulting data contained a set of features corresponding to peaks which were found in multiple samples each with an approximate m/z and retention time. The matrix of intensity values by feature and sample was used for further analysis. During the profiling, the analytical robustness of UPLC-QTOF-MS QC samples was repeatedly analyzed. Metabolite features that were missing in more than one pooled QC sample or showing a large coefficient of variation (CV) in the pooled QC samples greater than 30% were discarded as unreliable before conducting the statistical analysis. Intensity values were normalized by the mass spectrometry total usable signal (MSTUS). Briefly, an MSTUS value was calculated by summing the intensity of all features, excluding those features which were either found in less than half of the samples, in the bottom 20th percentile of peak intensities, in more than 80% of samples, or were in the 90th percentile in at least one but less than 10% of samples. Feature intensities for each sample were then multiplied by a scaling factor calculated as the median MSTUS value over the sample MSTUS value. Missing feature intensities after peak filling were then imputed as half of the minimum value by feature [40]."

Measurement data of non-normal distribution are expressed as median (interquartile range). Before statistical analyses, urinary metabolomics peak intensity data were log10-transformed. Preliminarily annotated metabolites present in both cohorts were analyzed. The Partek Genomics suite was used for the principal component analysis [41]. Linear regression analysis models were used to estimate the associations of metabolic features with a BMI z-score in the discovery and validation set, after adjusting for age, race, and total energy intake (kcal). In the present study, smoking status was less than 4.2%, and smoking status and socioeconomic status were initially included in the models but were removed due to the lack of significance of the effect (Supplement Tables S4 and S5). After pooled QC filtering of CV < 30% and performing putative annotation, a total of 1532 metabolite features were obtained in both positive and negative modes. These features were then subjected to linear regression analysis in the discovery set. Subsequently, 221 features that exhibited significant association with BMI Z-score in the discovery set were selected for further investigation of their association with BMI Z-score in the validation set. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using a false discovery rate (FDR) [42] corrected alpha of \u22640.1. Graph Pad Prism version 8.4 was used to produce the volcano plots.

            "text": "The purpose of the study was to identify the metabolomic signature of obesity in adolesc nts. Prior studie in the field of metabolomics have predominantly ocused o characterizing metabolites linked to childhood besity or BMI in contr st to non-obese subjects [27,45\u201348]. Obesity mainly classifies adolescents as normal, ove weight, r o ese based on their BMI percentile [15,16]. As childr n grow up, the measurement f body m ss index (BMI) requir s adjustment for age a d gender [14]. However, the BMI z-score as a continuous variable, which is age and gender-specific in children, is considered a more suitable metric for determining body mass index (BMI) than the conventional BMI measurement and provides a better estimation of an individual\u2019s adiposity status [17]. The present cross-sectional study demonstrated the perturbation of the urinary metabolites associated with BMI z-score in male adolescents and replicated results in the longitudinal analysis for changes in BMI. Additionally, metabolomic signatures were identified with the potential to examine metabolic health in adolescents. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to relate positive change in BMI to the urine metabolome in adolescents. In this study, 1532 putatively annotated features were used to study the association analysis with BMI Z-score in adolescents. Following the adjustment of age, race, and total energy intake, 221 metabolites were identified as exhibiting a robust association with BMI z-score within the discovery set. Out of 221 lists of significant features from the discovery set, 16 metabolites were found to be significantly associated with the BMI z-score in the validation dataset in adolescents. Obesity is a serious and growing health problem that affects people of all ages all over the world, including children. In the past, research on metabolomic biomarkers in obesity has largely focused on targeted metabolomics and a specific group of compounds rather than evaluating a large number of metabolites at the same time [49\u201352]. However, developing evidence indicates that not only absolute metabolite levels of specific compounds are important, but their relationship with other metabolites (profiles)\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 899 16 of 23\nand pathways play an important role in the biology of metabolism [53]. Therefore, it is crucial to simultaneously investigate a larger number of metabolites to arrive at a more accurate etiologic picture. Our findings highlight the presence of changes in the urine metabolome associated with positive changes in BMI in adolescence. We observed that the six urinary metabolites (3\u2032-sialyllactose, formiminoglutamic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, citrulline, inosine) showed a positive association with positive change in BMI and three metabolites (glycylproline, 4-vinylsyringol) showed a negative association with positive change in BMI. Accumulated evidence showed that the perturbated metabolites are amino acids and carbohydrates. In several adolescent studies, the relationship between the metabolome and obesity has been thoroughly described [1,17,21,27]. The present study's finding is consistent with previous findings and most of the metabolites strongly influencing metabolic BMI are documented in the present study. In the study by Cirulli et al. (2019), which included 1969 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort, 49 metabolites showed the strongest associations with BMI out of a total of 650 metabolites, and a majority of the 49 metabolites were identified as significant predictors of BMI. These included glutamate, asparagine, leucine, N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, and kynurenate, among others [17]. Thus, only 7.54% of metabolites were replicated across multiple studies [17], a finding similar to that of the present study, where 7.27% of metabolites were replicated in validation sets. Similarly, Sohn et al. (2022) investigated metabolomic signatures associated with weight control interventions in children with obesity using untargeted metabolomics in plasma samples and observed 12 metabolites were significant at both time points including asparagine, glutamine, O-acetylcarnitine, and most perturbated metabolic pathways was D-glutamine and glutamate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis [1]. The present study results also find D-glutamine and glutamate metabolism (L-Glutamine) and arginine biosynthesis (L-Glutamine) were the most perturbated metabolic pathways. Another study by Cho et al. (2017) included non-obese (n = 91) and obese (n = 93) adolescents from both sexes and also conducted untargeted and targeted urinary metabolomics. Inflammation-related metabolites were identified with strong predictive power to distinguish obese and nonobese groups, and acylcarnitines (hexanoylcarnitine), amino acid (glutamine, asparagine), amines (carnosine), glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids were significantly high in obese adolescents [27]. In our study, we found 2-hexanoylcarnitine, L-glutamine, carnosine, and hydroxyprolyl-asparagine are associated with BMI Z-score. Obesity is associated with increased acylcarnitine levels in blood plasma sample of Hispanic children, e.g., propionyl-, butyryl-, hexanoyl-, stearoyl-, and oleoylcarnitine [46], and in adolescence, e.g., propionyl-, 2-methylbutyryl-, isovaleryl-, and isobutyrylcarnitine [54]. In this study, 2-hexenoylcarnitine was associated with the BMI z-score. Acylcarnitines play an important role in many cellular energy metabolism pathways, e.g., transporting acyl groups (organic acids and fatty acids) from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria for the production of energy [55,56]. Papandreou et al. (2021) reported acylcarnitine metabolites (hexanoylcarnitine, hexadecenoylcarnitine) were associated with body fat% [57], indicating that higher body fat correlates with upregulated beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Acylcarnitines are important biomarkers in metabolic studies such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes [56], kidney cancer [58], and hepatocellular carcinoma [59]. Observed elevated levels of carnitine metabolites in adolescents require particular attention and may be a target for obesity management to prevent the development of disease complications. As previously reported by Brachem et al. (2020), the urinary level of glucuronide of C10H18O2 (12) was positively associated with BMI and body fat in adolescents [23]. In addition, in another study, Tchernof et al. (1997) reported the plasma level of androstane3\u03b1,17\u03b2-Diol glucuronide concentration was significantly higher in overweight men [60]. The liver is the primary site of altered glucuronidation, with the help of the UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme in conjugation with glucuronate, resulting in the removal of toxic substances, drugs, or other xenobiotics [61,62]. Glucuronides in adipose tissue have been shown to demonstrate higher activity in obese individuals [60,63]. In the current study,\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 899 17 of 23\nN-(2-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide glucuronide was found to be positively associated with BMI Z-score and positive change in BMI in adolescents. The current study observation is consistent with previous studies in that the glucouronide product is associated with obesity [64]. The mechanism of glucouronide products and their relationship with obesity is currently unknown. Increased adiposity is also associated with changes in amino acid metabolism [47]. In the etiology of obesity and diabetes mellitus, amino acids (AAs) are emerging as a new class of potent molecules. Amino acids (AA) are the building blocks of proteins and play essential roles in gene expression, cell signaling, inflammatory responses, metabolism, oxidative stress, and detoxification [65]. Yamakado et al. reported that the change in the amino acid profile was closely related to the development of metabolic complications such as insulin resistance, diabetes, and visceral fat accumulation [66]. We observed a negative association of BMI z-score with amino acids and their derivatives such as glycylproline, L-glutamine, hydroxyprolyl-asparagine, and galactosylhydroxylysine. In contrast, formiminoglutamic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, and citrulline were positively associated with BMI Z-score. These findings are consistent with those of previous research, where obesity was associated with higher levels of amino acids such as lysine, tryptophan, cystine, and glutamate, but lower levels of asparagine, glutamine, glycine, and serine in Japanese adults [49]. In comparison to children of normal weight, children with obesity had reported higher serum levels of phenylalanine, proline, histidine, and lysine and lower serum levels of glutamine [67]. Citrulline is associated with the urea cycle. A previous study reported a decrease in citrulline in obese adolescents [27,46,67]. While the present study results are inconsistent, we found citrulline is positively associated with BMI z-score and a positive change in BMI in adolescents. Moreover, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids have previously been proposed as biomarkers of metabolic syndrome [50]. BCAAs promote protein synthesis and turnover, signaling pathways, and metabolism of glucose. Oxidation of BCAAs may increase fatty acid oxidation and play a role in obesity. In the present study, we also observed a significant positive association of 4-hydroxyproline with BMI z-score and a positive change in BMI in a follow-up study in adolescents. Increasing evidence has been reported that 4-hydroxyproline may play a significant role in protecting mammalian cells from oxidative stress and injury [68]. Additionally, 4-hydroxyproline enhances human nutrition and health, including metabolic, immune, and cardiovascular health [69]. 4-hydroxyproline and carnosine from dietary sources are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and aging-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis in children and adults [69]. Our results are consistent with Cho et al. (2017), where carnosine a dipeptide synthesized in the body from \u03b2-alanine and L-histidine was found to decrease in obese adolescents [27]. In the current study, we observed galactosylhydroxylysine was negatively associated with BMI Z-score. A study conducted urine metabolic profiling in normal-weight young men and obese men with hyperlipidemia. It was observed that glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine along with eight other metabolites has a significant impact on the development and manifestation of obesity-related disorders [70]. Glycylproline, a dipeptide composed of glycine and proline, is considered a building block for proteins. Glycine is also required for multiple metabolic pathways. Several studies reported the level of glycine was found to decrease in children with obesity in plasma samples [46,52]. Similarly, Wahl et al. (2012) reported the level of proline decreased in children with obesity [47]. However, Short et al. investigated plasma profiles of amino acid-related metabolites among Indian American adolescents and observed higher levels of proline in obese children as compared to normal-weight children [67]. In the present study, glycine-proline is negatively associated with BMI z-score and a positive change in BMI after a 1-year follow-up. In vitro and in vivo studies reported cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) mediates the homeostasis of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 function and the cGP/IGF-1 ratio, which determines IGF-1 bioactivity. Plasma IGF-1 is predominantly inactive and slightly related to obesity and hypertension in humans [71]. Glycine and proline\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 899 18 of 23\nare non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) that play a crucial role in nutrition serving and are closely related to the development of tumors. Glycine deficiency reduces the synthesis of glutathione (GSH) and enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. A decline in GSH levels and accumulation of ROS promote lipid peroxidation ultimately leads to tumor suppression through ferroptosis-mediated mechanisms [72]. Formiminoglutamic acid is an intermediate metabolite in the degradative conversion of histidine to glutamic acid [73]. Formiminoglutamic acid is not directly related to obesity, but increased levels of urinary formiminoglutamic acid are associated with a deficiency of folic acid and vitamin B12, which may lead to liver disease [74], CVD [75], and heart disease [76]. In this study, formiminoglutamic acid is positively associated with BMI z-score and a positive change in BMI. The pathway analysis report suggests which metabolic pathways might be altered in individuals with different BMI z-scores and positive changes in BMI. The most perturbated metabolic pathway in the current study is arginine biosynthesis. Arginine is synthesized from citrulline and L-glutamine. Recent findings from human and animal-based research suggested that arginine plays a crucial role in modulating the metabolism of energy substrates [77]. Arginine metabolism stimulates the expression of specific genes in adipose tissue, potentially increasing fatty acid and glucose oxidation [78]. Previous investigations have exhibited that the intake of L-arginine can improve endothelial function, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and inflammation, all of which are interconnected with obesity-induced ailments such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [79\u201381]. Our study has some limitations. We evaluated a sample of individuals mainly consisting of only male adolescents with normal/overweight/obesity, which could limit the generalizability of our results to other populations and girls. Additionally, we provide no information about the association of obesity and metabolomic features in adults, when BMI is generally more stable and not impacted by changes in hormones (e.g., growth hormones). Second, in our study, we used BMI z-score as a criterion for obesity, rather than body-fat and waist circumference, which can be a more accurate parameter of adiposity. Third, since metabolites were only measured at a one-time point (baseline) and one-year follow-up with a limited sample size (n = 81), we could not provide any data regarding the stability of the metabolome associated with BMI z-score and positive change in BMI over longer times. Fourth, this study did not positively identify the metabolites and apply a targeted approach so that the putative identifications may not be correct. Fifth, we used random urine samples for metabolomics analysis and variability in the metabolite content may be a limitation. The present study has notable strengths. This current study focuses on adolescent males, capturing what features remain associated with obesity over time. It incorporates both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. Replication was enhanced by using a discovery and validation set, which was then applied to longitudinal analysis. This increases the confidence of true findings. Reasons why the sampling at two time points is not concordant could be due to differences in lifestyle at the different time points, changing metabolomic profiles as the participants age, and/or false negatives in spite of multiple comparison corrections. Another strength is the use of the z-score, which is better reflective of future health status as it accounts for age and gender. Additionally, comprehensive untargeted metabolome profiling was performed on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS metabolomic platforms, which provides maximum coverage as compared to targeted metabolomics and another approach to qualitatively analyze a wide range of metabolites. It also helps in the identification of new metabolites associated with obesity and obesity-related complications."

The current study indicates histidine metabolism as a key mechanism related to obesity.

These metabolites may directly or indirectly contribute to the development of obesity, particularly its effects, which can be studied in more detail in mechanistic studies. Obesity is a multifaceted and complex health concern that arises from a combination of genetic, behavioral, social, and environmental factors. While biological factors certainly play a role in an individual\u2019s susceptibility to obesity, the environment in which we live greatly influences our food choices, physical activity levels, and overall lifestyle. Even though the use of metabolomics in childhood obesity research is still in its early stages, the identified metabolites have provided additional insight into the pathogenesis of some obesity-related diseases. Furthermore, future research should attempt to replicate our findings in a different adolescent population and extend the analysis to a longitudinal design to better understand the possible correlation of body composition with urine metabolome.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo13080899/s1, Figure S1: Principal component analysis (PCA) of 1532 annotated urinary metabolomics data with three groups (Discovery set (n = 235), Validation set (n = 125), and replication set (n = 81); Figure S2A: Principal Components analysis with outliers; Figure S2B: T2 Hotelling for I2 Principal Components; Table S1: Supplement Table S1.
