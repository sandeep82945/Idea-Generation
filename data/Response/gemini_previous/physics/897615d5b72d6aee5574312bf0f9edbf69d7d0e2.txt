1. **Investigate the effects of capsomer charge on the assembly behavior of deformable capsomers.** The paper briefly explores the effects of capsomer surface charge on assembly behavior, but a more detailed study could provide valuable insights into the role of electrostatics in virus assembly. For example, one could investigate how the magnitude and distribution of capsomer charge affect the assembly diagram and the types of assembly products that are formed.


2. **Explore the effects of capsomer deformability on the assembly of viruses with different T numbers.** The paper focuses on the assembly of viruses with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry, but it would be interesting to investigate how capsomer deformability affects the assembly of viruses with other T numbers. For example, one could study the assembly of viruses with T = 3 or T = 4 icosahedral symmetry, or even viruses with more complex structures.


3. **Investigate the effects of capsomer deformability on the assembly of viruses in the presence of a genome.** The paper considers the assembly of empty capsids, but it would be interesting to investigate how capsomer deformability affects the assembly of viruses in the presence of a genome. For example, one could study how the genome affects the assembly diagram and the types of assembly products that are formed.


4. **Develop a coarse-grained model of capsomers that incorporates additional features, such as capsomer charge and genome interactions.** The paper presents a relatively simple coarse-grained model of capsomers, but it would be possible to develop more sophisticated models that incorporate additional features, such as capsomer charge and genome interactions. These more sophisticated models could provide a more accurate description of virus assembly and could be used to investigate a wider range of assembly phenomena.


5. **Use the coarse-grained model of deformable capsomers to design new self-assembling materials.** The paper demonstrates that deformable capsomers can self-assemble into ordered materials with appropriate adjustment of solution conditions. This suggests that deformable capsomers could be used to design new self-assembling materials with tailored properties. For example, one could design capsomers that self-assemble into materials with specific optical, electronic, or mechanical properties.
