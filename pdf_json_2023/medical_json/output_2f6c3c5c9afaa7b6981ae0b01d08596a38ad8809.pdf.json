    "abstractText": "Background Sustainable and effective eHealth requires accessibility for everyone. Little is known about how accessibility of eHealth is perceived among people with various impairments. The aim of this study was to compare use and perceived difficulty in the use of eHealth among people with and without impairment, and how different types of impairment were associated with perceived difficulty in the use of eHealth. Methods This study used data collected in a nationwide survey in Sweden. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants with self-reported impairment, from June to October 2019. In February 2020, the survey was posted to people in the general population who were matched to the participants with impairment by age, gender and county of residence. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse the use of four eHealth services, and perceived difficulty in the use of six eHealth services. Results In total, 1631 participants with, and 1084 participants without impairment responded to the survey. Participants with impairment reported less use and more difficulty in the use of all eHealth services as compared to participants without impairment. When comparing types of impairment, booking healthcare appointments online was least used and most avoided by participants with communication, language and calculation impairments (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) use 0.64, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.49\u20130.83; aOR avoid 1.64, 95%CI 1.19\u20132.27), and intellectual impairments (aOR use 0.28, 95%CI 0.20\u20130.39; aOR avoid 2.88, 95%CI 1.86\u20134.45). The Swedish national web-portal for health information and services, 1177.se, was reported difficult to use the most among participants with communication, language and calculation impairments (aOR 2.24, 95%CI 1.50\u20133.36), deaf-blindness (aOR 11.24, 95%CI 3.49\u201336.23) and hearing impairment (aOR 2.50, 95%CI 1.17\u20135.35). Conclusions The results confirm the existence of an eHealth disability digital divide. People with impairment were not one homogeneous group, but differed in perceived difficulties in regard to eHealth. Based on a purposeful subgrouping of impairments, we showed that people with communication, language and calculation impairments, and intellectual impairments, reported least use and most difficulty in using eHealth. The findings can guide further research in creating eHealth that is accessible for all, including those with the most significant difficulties.",

Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants with self-reported impairment, from June to October 2019. In February 2020, the survey was posted to people in the general population who were matched to the participants with impairment by age, gender and county of residence. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse the use of four eHealth services, and perceived difficulty in the use of six eHealth services.\nResults In total, 1631 participants with, and 1084 participants without impairment responded to the survey. Participants with impairment reported less use and more difficulty in the use of all eHealth services as compared to participants without impairment. When comparing types of impairment, booking healthcare appointments online was least used and most avoided by participants with communication, language and calculation impairments (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) use 0.64, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.49\u20130.83; aOR avoid 1.64, 95%CI 1.19\u20132.27), and intellectual impairments (aOR use 0.28, 95%CI 0.20\u20130.39; aOR avoid 2.88, 95%CI 1.86\u20134.45). The Swedish national web-portal for health information and services, 1177.se, was reported difficult to use the most among participants with communication, language and calculation impairments (aOR 2.24, 95%CI 1.50\u20133.36), deaf-blindness (aOR 11.24, 95%CI 3.49\u201336.23) and hearing impairment (aOR 2.50, 95%CI 1.17\u20135.35).\nConclusions The results confirm the existence of an eHealth disability digital divide. People with impairment were not one homogeneous group, but differed in perceived difficulties in regard to eHealth. Based on a purposeful subgrouping of impairments, we showed that people with communication, language and calculation impairments, and intellectual impairments, reported least use and most difficulty in using eHealth. The findings can guide further research in creating eHealth that is accessible for all, including those with the most significant difficulties.\nKeywords eHealth, Impairment, Accessibility, Digital Inclusion, Universal design\n*Correspondence: Linda Pettersson linda.a.pettersson@regiondalarna.se Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "eHealth services can improve access to healthcare with limited resources [1\u20133]. In line with legislation [4] and human rights principles [5], and to ensure effective use of health services [6], eHealth services should be accessible for all. In the context of eHealth, accessibility refers to the extent to which all users can access and use the digital services to achieve an intended outcome [7]. However, when evaluated, many eHealth services are not accessible for people with impairment [8\u201311]. Barriers in the digital design can pose limitations on participation in eHealth for people with impairment and thereby cause disability [7, 12, 13]. It is known that eHealth users are characterised by being younger, more educated, richer, cohabitant, living in cities, having higher eHealth literacy and fewer chronic diagnoses compared to non-users [14, 15].\nIn Sweden, two national surveys by Statistics Sweden (SCB) and The Swedish Internet Foundation (IIS) continuously monitor internet use [16, 17], and also report data to the Eurostat reports on internet use [18]. However, these surveys have included only a small number of participants with impairment. If mentioned, people with impairments are presented as one homogeneous group, without investigating whether there are differences in internet use between types of impairment.\nIn a previous nationwide survey on internet use among people with impairments [19], we used snowball sampling instead of conventional survey methods, to attain participation from groups of people who had not been represented in the afore mentioned surveys. The results of our survey provided support for the existence of a disability digital divide in Sweden [19]. However, that survey did not explicitly target the use of eHealth services. Recently, it has been suggested that people with different types of impairment have different types and amounts of difficulty using the internet [19, 20]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare use and perceived difficulty in the use of eHealth among people with and without impairment, and how different types of impairment were associated with perceived difficulty in the use of eHealth."

In 2019, the survey was further elaborated upon and questions on eHealth were added. The SMFOI19 survey questionnaire entailed 47 questions on various aspects of internet use as well as background characteristics including one question on type of impairment and diagnoses. The wording of the survey questions and response options were developed in close collaboration with members of the Begripsam group, whom all have lived experience of impairment. Several optional ways to respond to the survey were provided: by online or paper questionnaire, or by telephone or onsite interview. Reading support, interviews in sign language, complementary pictograms and support from a speech therapist was offered on request.\nSnowball sampling was used from June to October 2019 to recruit participants with self-reported impairment to the SMFOI19 survey. Snowball sampling is a suitable sampling method to reach so called \u2018rare populations\u2019, which are hard to reach by conventional methods in population studies [21]. Information about the survey and recruitment of participants was distributed nationwide through social media and networks within disability organisations: home pages, e-mail contact lists, newsletters and by personal communication. The survey information endorsed everyone to share and redistribute the survey.\nThen, in February 2020, the SMFOI19 survey was sent by post to people in the general population that were randomly selected to match the participants with impairment by age, gender and county of residence. Addresses of the matched individuals were provided from the Swedish state personal address register [22]."

The responses to the question on impairments were grouped by three of the authors, based on our competence in medicine, digital accessibility and human computer interaction, as well as empirical research [13] of similar co-morbidity and functioning, to a conceptual model of purposeful subgrouping of impairments. The three authors independently examined the activity limitations and diagnoses represented among the participants and categorised them into groups of impairments. Then, the authors compared the categorisations. There was almost complete interrater agreement. The very few disagreements were discussed until consensus of a final subgrouping of impairments was reached. Multiple responses were allowed in the reporting of impairments and diagnoses.

            "text": "This study showed an eHealth disability digital divide in that participants with impairment reported less use and more difficulty in the use of eHealth compared to participants without impairment. When subgrouping impairments, which to our knowledge has not been previously done in this detailed way, the least use and most difficulty using eHealth were shown among participants with communication, language and calculation impairments, and intellectual impairments.\nIn line with our results, other studies have shown that people with impairment use eHealth services less [11] and report more difficulties [9] than people without impairment. The one study that did not show less use of the internet for health-related activities, did not include people with such impairments, who in the present study\nhad the least use of, and the most difficulty in using eHealth, i.e. communication, language and calculation impairments, and intellectual impairments [26].\nBooking healthcare appointments online and the SSIA website were the most difficult eHealth service in this study. Using these services is complex, as they require digital identification to log in, require understanding of digital functions and features and require considerable executive functions to operate. Twice as many participants with impairment avoided booking healthcare appointments online and reported difficulty in using the SSIA website, as compared to participants without impairment.\nAmong participants with communication, language and calculation impairments, intellectual impairments and all visual impairments (visual impairment, blindness and deaf-blindness), most of the eHealth services were reported as difficult to use: i.e., digital identification, the 1177.se web-portal and booking healthcare appointments online.\nParticipants with impairments relating to communication, language and calculation (Fig.\u00a0 2) were grouped together based on similar co-morbidity and functioning regarding working memory, symbol interpretation and comprehension [27\u201329]. Indeed, the results confirmed that they presented a similar pattern of less use and more difficulties in the use of eHealth. Previous literature has discussed the limitation of eHealth lacking non-verbal communication (such as eye-contact) and communicative emotion (such as vocal intonation) [30], and concerns have been raised about the patient\u2014care provider relationship and therapeutic alliance of sporadic contacts [31], which could plausibly be important among people with communication, language and calculation impairments. Design features to increase their accessibility are standards for understandable texts, text-to-speech technology, audio, speech-to-text technology and the possibility to import numbers from a reliable source rather than to enter them manually [32], as well as visualisations [33] and allowing for longer duration of communication [34].\nThe least use and most frequent difficulties in use of eHealth overall in this study were reported among participants with intellectual impairments. This is consistent with findings in other studies showing that people with intellectual impairments struggle with using the web [35, 36]. Improvements in the digital design that increase accessibility in relation to intellectual impairments are plain language with short sentences, visualisations, clear icons, calm background, audio including narrative information, intuitive navigation and language options [35, 37], whereas disablement by design can be caused by updates requiring new learning [9].\nParticipants with visual impairment reported less use of digital identification and more frequently avoiding booking healthcare appointments online, as compared to all other participants. Previous studies showed that not complying with design guidelines made digital services visually inaccessible, and that accessibility improved after re-design [38, 39]. People with progressive visual impairment can usually appreciate assistive devices such as magnifiers to reinforce sight [40]. Assistive device compatibility could aid their access to eHealth [41], but also technical options for magnifying, such as contrast and brightness [42]. Childhood onset severe visual impairment, on the other hand, makes communicative development rely on senses other than vision. Among participants with blindness, few reported use of digital identification or booking healthcare appointments online. Text-to-speech technology and audio could increase accessibility of eHealth [32, 42]. However, people with blindness often use their own assistive device with e.g. functions for screen reading, since built-in audio functions on webpages may need visual functioning to initiate. Thus, assistive device compatibility, in the 1177. se web-portal and for digital identification, is important. In the present study, participants with deaf-blindness had the most difficulty using digital identification and the 1177.se web-portal, as compared to all other participants. The diagnosis deaf-blindness defines when the level of visual and/or hearing impairment is too severe for one to compensate for the other. When people with deaf-blindness have residual hearing or vision, the same design functions as for other sensory impairments can make eHealth accessible for them. Otherwise, the tactile sense is important for their communication and eHealth use [9, 43].\nIn the present study, the only exception to the disability digital divide was booking healthcare appointments online, which was used by a higher proportion of participants with neurological and musculoskeletal impairments, deafness, and hearing impairment, as compared to participants without impairment. Also, participants with hearing impairment alongside participants without impairment were least likely to avoid booking healthcare appointments online. This finding is reasonable, since the telephone is difficult with hearing impairment and written information or administrative procedures can be a secure option avoiding potential loss of spoken communication [44]. Therefore, eHealth may be an important tool for improved overall healthcare accessibility for people with hearing loss.\nOur results show that people with impairment have more difficulties using eHealth than people without impairment. At the same time, people with impairment are under-represented in eHealth research [45].\nThe results in the present study demonstrated that people with similar functional impairments report similar use of eHealth and difficulties using eHealth. Henni et\u00a0 al. recently reported the same findings in a scoping review, by combining data from multiple studies [9]. Our analyses showed that the overlaps due to participants reporting several impairments did not exceed the predetermined cut-off, and thus people with multi-morbidity could be represented in the results. Hence, the purposeful subgrouping of impairments can be a useful tool to understand who will probably perceive difficulties in the use of eHealth. This can be used to inform designers and policy makers as to who should be involved in the design process of eHealth services. Our subgrouping of impairments shows that it is especially important that people with communication, language and calculation impairments, and intellectual impairments, are involved in the design of eHealth, as they reported the least use and the most difficulties. Evaluations show that many eHealth services do not comply with accessibility standards [8, 10]. Further, there is a critique that accessibility standards are too narrow, lacking cognitive accessibility [9, 34, 35], which was shown to be a prominent aspect for the impairments of the participants who in this study reported the most difficulties in the use of eHealth services. We suggest that including people with these types of impairment in co-design processes when developing eHealth services, would increase the focus on cognitive accessibility and complement existing accessibility standards. The importance of user participation in eHealth development is acknowledged by both research and policy makers, as it can improve accessibility [46\u201349]. Codesign of eHealth by user participation involving people with the most significant difficulties, will thereby produce eHealth services that are usable and accessible to the widest range of people, i.e. universal design [7, 9]. In short, designing for people with the most difficulties will produce eHealth for the whole population. Our subgrouping of impairments can also be used when evaluating effects on eHealth investments. If large proportions of the population avoid eHealth services, the favourable effects of those services will be lower than anticipated [6]. Thus, the use of eHealth among people with impairment is important for accurately measuring the effects of eHealth and for obtaining maximal gain on eHealth investments."

            "text": "It is a major strength of this study that, by use of the snowball sampling method, we managed to achieve substantial participation of people with impairment, i.e. among populations considered hard-to-reach by conventional survey sampling methods [21]. However, the use of snowball sampling mainly through online survey,\nplausibly reached more digitally literate people, which limits the generalisation of the findings to all people with impairment in Sweden. In addition, previous research has shown that self-assessment of digital literacy, might result in underestimation of difficulties [50, 51]. In summary, our results succeeded in measuring the disability digital divide of eHealth, but plausibly underestimated its severity.\nA strength of this study is that we showed differences not only between people with and without impairment, but also differences between subgroups of impairments. We believe it to be a rigorous strategy to survey all significant impairments, if managing methodological challenges in the statistical analysis. Since having multiple impairments was more common than having a single diagnosis, the risk of misclassification bias in selecting a primary impairment would be substantial. Multicollinearity did not exceed the predetermined cut-off, sensitivity analyses did not have significant impact on odds ratios and outcomes were not associated with number of reported impairments. This contributed to a differentiated knowledge of the heterogeneity in use and difficulty in use of eHealth between purposefully grouped impairments. The proposed subgrouping of impairments is a first attempt that will need to be validated in future studies.\nIt is notable that 14% of those in the general population who responded to the survey reported having impairment. This roughly corresponds to estimates of prevalence of impairment in the population [52]. It indicates that how we constructed the question on impairment was successful in attaining appropriate information of impairment in the general population. There are multiple approaches to constructing questions on impairment, which should be guided by the purpose, e.g. in medicine or for legal definitions [13]. We want to stress the importance of asking about impairments in relation to the outcome. Functioning is indeed continuous, not dichotomous, and differs depending on the activity and the context. We asked participants to report impairment that \u2018clearly affect how you live your life\u2019 since eHealth usage requires high level of functioning. We developed the question on impairment in collaboration with people having different types of impairment, which strengthens the validity of the question. Altogether, by this approach we believe we present results that are more credible as compared to other national surveys which have used generic questions, without specifying type of impairment [16, 17]. We suggest that the question used in this study is favourable for reporting impairment and should also be used in other studies of accessibility of eHealth.\nThe body of literature is still scarce on accessibility of eHealth. However, there are more studies on digital\naccessibility in general [11, 19, 35\u201338, 43]. We find it reasonable to discuss our findings in relation to studies of web accessibility and digital technology in general. However, eHealth involves complex services and the interplay with health literacy compels caution in comparability. Further, there might be other factors not investigated in this study that are associated with accessibility of eHealth, for example eHealth literacy [6, 53] and socioeconomic factors [14, 15]. This study was undertaken prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has forced community services online [34] and it is plausible that digital participation has changed in the population, which raises questions on whether the findings are valid in a post-pandemic context. We are currently undertaking a survey to investigate changes in the disability digital divide related to the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "text": "The result confirmed an eHealth disability digital divide in that participants with impairment reported less use and more difficulty in the use of eHealth compared to participants without impairment. It also extended our knowledge that people with impairment are not one homogeneous group, but differ in perceived difficulties in regard to eHealth. Based on a purposeful subgrouping of impairments, we showed that people with communication, language and calculation impairments, and intellectual impairments, reported the least use and most difficulty in using eHealth. The shown diversity in the disability digital divide and the purposeful grouping of impairments can guide researchers and designers in developing eHealth that is accessible for all people, including those with the most difficulties.\nAbbreviations 95%CI 95% Confidence interval aOR Adjusted odds ratio SMFOI19 Swedes with impairment and the Internet 2019 SSIA The Swedish Social Insurance Agency\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12889- 023- 15094-z.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
