    "abstractText": "Quantum metrology aims to use quantum resources to improve the precision of measurement. Because quantum systems with criticality are very sensitive to the variation of order parameters around the quantum phase transition (QPT), quantum criticality has been presented as a novel and efficient resource. Generally, protocols of criticality-based quantum metrology often work without decoherence. In this paper, we address the issue whether the divergent feature of the inverted variance is indeed realizable in the presence of noise when approaching the QPT. Taking the quantum Rabi model (QRM) as an example, we obtain the analytical result for the inverted variance. We show that the inverted variance may be convergent in time due to the noise. When approaching the critical point, the maximum inverted variance demonstrates a power-law increase with the exponent \u22121.2, of which the absolute value is smaller than that for the noise-free case, i.e., 2. We also observe a power-law dependence of the maximum inverted variance on the relaxation rate and the temperature. Since the precision of the metrology is very sensitive to the noise, as a remedy, we propose performing the squeezing operation on the initial state to improve the precision under decoherence. In addition, we also investigate the criticality-based metrology under the influence of the two-photon relaxation. Contrary to the single-photon relaxation, the quantum dynamics of the inverted variance shows a completely-different behavior. It does not oscillate with the same frequency with respect to the re-scaled time for different dimensionless coupling strengths. Strikingly, although the maximum inverted variance still manifests a power-law dependence on the energy gap, the exponent is positive and depends on the dimensionless coupling strength. This observation implies that the criticality may not enhance but weaken the precision in the presence of two-photon relaxation. It can be well described by the non-linearity introduced by the two-photon relaxation.",

Because quantum systems with criticality are very sensitive to the variation of order parameters around the quantum phase transition (QPT), quantum criticality has been presented as a novel and efficient resource. Generally, protocols of criticality-based quantum metrology often work without decoherence. In this paper, we address the issue whether the divergent feature of the inverted variance is indeed realizable in the presence of noise when approaching the QPT. Taking the quantum Rabi model (QRM) as an example, we obtain the analytical result for the inverted variance. We show that the inverted variance may be convergent in time due to the noise. When approaching the critical point, the maximum inverted variance demonstrates a power-law increase with the exponent \u22121.2, of which the absolute value is smaller than that for the noise-free case, i.e., 2. We also observe a power-law dependence of the maximum inverted variance on the relaxation rate and the temperature. Since the precision of the metrology is very sensitive to the noise, as a remedy, we propose performing the squeezing operation on the initial state to improve the precision under decoherence. In addition, we also investigate the criticality-based metrology under the influence of the two-photon relaxation. Contrary to the single-photon relaxation, the quantum dynamics of the inverted variance shows a completely-different behavior. It does not oscillate with the same frequency with respect to the re-scaled time for different dimensionless coupling strengths. Strikingly, although the maximum inverted variance still manifests a power-law dependence on the energy gap, the exponent is positive and depends on the dimensionless coupling strength. This observation implies that the criticality may not enhance but weaken the precision in the presence of two-photon relaxation. It can be well described by the non-linearity introduced by the two-photon relaxation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum criticality has been shown to provide significant advantages for quantum sensing and metrology [1\u2013 10]. In quantum phase transition (QPT), a small variation in the order parameter may cause a huge change in the system\u2019s properties when approaching the quantum critical point [11\u201313]. Thus, quantum criticality can be viewed as a valuable resource to acquire an ultrahighprecision estimation. In the last few years, criticalitybased quantum metrological schemes have gained increasing attention among both theoretical and experimental researchers. Many criticality-based quantum metrology protocols in QPT systems have been proposed, which can be classified into two types [4, 5]. One of them focuses on the critical behaviors of the QPT at equilibrium, and utilizes the ground state of the Hamiltonian near the critical point. Unfortunately, it is very inefficient to prepare the ground-state around the critical point by the state-of-art technology. The other focuses on the dynamical behaviors, which evolve under a Hamiltonian close to the critical point. It is quite similar to the interferometric paradigm in the typical quantum metrology. Previous work [3] has revealed that both two kinds of approaches yield the same scaling for a broad class of quantum many-body systems. Recently, a dynamic framework for criticality-based quantum metrol-\n\u2217 aiqing@bnu.edu.cn\nogy, which preliminarily focuses on the dynamical approach, has been proposed [2, 14, 15]. The fundamental idea as well as the details of experimental implementation using quantum Rabi model (QRM) have been illustrated. The QRM is one of the most fundamental models describing quantum light-matter interactions [16]. There exists a superradiant QPT in the thermodynamic limit of the QRM [17\u201320]. The thermodynamic limit can be achieved when the reduced Rabi frequency approaches infinity in some quantum systems with criticality, such as the Dicke model, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the QRM [5].\nOn the other hand, any quantum system inevitably suffers from the interaction with the surrounding environment and thus forms an open quantum system. It has been known over two decades that the quantum metrology with the maximum-entangled states shows no advantage over the classical counterpart when the decoherence is present [21]. Interestingly, when placed in a non-Markovian environment, the entangled probes indeed manifest their superiority by the quantum Zeno effect [22\u201326], and recently it was experimentally demonstrated by an exact and efficient quantum simulation approach [27\u201332].\nIn this work, inspired by the above discoveries, we analyze the achievable precision in the QRM when considering the thermal relaxation. The upper bound on the achievable precision of the metrology will be dramatically reduced owing to the noise. This result indicates that the dissipation poses severe limitations and thus hinders the metrological advantages in this framework. Furthermore,\n2 we find that the inverted variance may converge in time no matter as a result of the noise. We further explore optimization of initial state and find that the precision can be improved by a squeezing operation on the initial state. On the other hand, recently two-photon relaxation has been experimentally realized [33]. It was theoretically shown that the two-photon relaxation preserves the Z2 symmetry of the QRM. The initial states with even-odd parity manifest qualitatively distinct transient and steady state behaviors, which is present both at ultrastrong and weak couplings [34]. Motivated by these observations, we theoretically investigate the quantum dynamics of the metrology in the presence of two-photon relaxation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we outline some basic concepts in the quantum metrology based on the criticality and introduce the QRM with noise. In Sec. III, we analyze the results by the semiclassical equation of motion and discuss the effects of various physical parameters on the measurement precision. In Sec. IV, we investigate the effects of the two-photon relaxation on the metrology. The main conclusions of this paper are drawn in Sec. V."

It is the most simplified version of the Dicke model [35]. The Hamiltonian of the QRM is\nHRabi = \u03c9a \u2020a+ \u03c90 2 \u03c3z \u2212 \u03bb(a+ a\u2020)\u03c3x, (1)\nwhere \u03c9 is the frequency of the bosonic field, a\u2020 and a are the creation and annihilation operators of the field, \u03c90 is the transition frequency of the two-level atom, \u03c3\u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y, z) are the Pauli operators of the atom, \u03bb is the coupling strength. Let g = 2\u03bb/ \u221a \u03c9\u03c90 be the dimensionless coupling constant. When the ratio of two transition frequencies diverges, i.e., \u03b7 = \u03c90/\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e, the energy gap closes and there exhibits a second-order normal-tosuperradiant QPT at the critical point g = 1 [17]. In the limit of \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, through the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation Unp = exp[g \u221a\n\u03b7\u22121(a+ a\u2020)(\u03c3+ \u2212 \u03c3\u2212)/2] [36], we can obtain an effective low-energy normal-phase Hamiltonian as\nHnp = \u03c9[P 2 + (1\u2212 g2)X2]/2, (2)\nwhere X = (a + a\u2020)/ \u221a 2 and P = i(a\u2020 \u2212 a)/ \u221a 2 are the quadrature operators.

When the noise is absent, i.e., \u03ba = 0, it can be proven that the local maxima of the inverted variance at the evolution time \u03c4 = 2m\u03c0/( \u221a\n\u2206g\u03c9) is equal to\n16g2\u03c92\u2206\u22122g \u03c4 2 \u3008P (0)\u30092 / (\u2206X(0))2 . It scales quadratically with \u03c4 , and shows a divergent feature when approaching the critical point, i.e., Fg(\u03c4) \u221d \u2206\u22123g \u2192 \u221e.\nAt zero temperature, the average photon number n\u0304 equals zero. In this case, we assume the same initial state (|0\u3009+ i|1\u3009) / \u221a 2 as Ref. [4]. Figure 1 shows the inverted variance of the QRM close to the critical point when coupling with a thermal reservoir at zero temperature. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the dynamics of Fg(t) manifest abundant phenomena. At first, the envelope increases along with the increase of the time. Then, after passing the maximum, it decreases and converges due to the noise. It is in sharp contrast to the prediction when the noise is absent. Furthermore, we also investigate the maximum values of Fg(t) for different \u03ba\u2019s in Fig. 1(b). As shown by the numerical fitting, the dependence of the maximum inverted variance Fg(t)|max on \u03ba can be well described by a\u03bab. For different g\u2019s, although a\u2019s are distinct, all b\u2019s are non-exceptionally equal to 2.\nIn Fig. 2(a), we plot the time dependence of Fg(t) near the critical point for different g\u2019s. Notice that the time is rescaled by \u2206g\u03c9/2\u03c0, which is approximately the oscillating frequency of Fg(t) for small \u03ba\u226a \u03c9. Similarly as in Fig. 1(a), we can see that Fg(t) gradually increase from their initial values Fg(0) = 0 to the maximum values. Then, Fg(t) begins to decrease and eventually vanishes in the long-time limit. By theoretically obtaining Fg(t) under different \u03ba\u2019s, we plot the relation of the maximum of Fg(t) with respect to \u2206g in Fig. 2(b). We can see that Fg(t) decays as \u2206g increases for a given \u03ba. It indicates that the noise hinders the metrological advantages in this framework. Again, we numerically fit the maximum of Fg(t) as a function of \u2206g, i.e., a\u2206 b g. Despite of different a\u2019s, all curves consistently decays with a nearlyidentical b \u2243 \u22121.18 > \u22122, which is the noise-free case. This implies that in the noisy QRM, the inverted variance still diverges when approaching the critical point, i.e., \u2206g \u2192 0.

Again, we plot the maximum Fg(t) vs the temperature T in Fig. 3(b). It\u2019s shown that the maximum Fg(t) drops dramatically as T rises.

Hereafter, we will propose some method to relieve this disadvantage.\nAccording to Eq. (7), the measurement accuracy highly depends on the initial state. This observation inspires us to perform a squeezing operation, defined by a squeezing operator S(\u03be) = exp[(\u03be\u2217a2 \u2212 \u03bea\u20202)/2], on the initial bosonic field state, where \u03be is the squeezing parameter. As seen in Fig. 4, the maximum of Fg(t) is significantly increased as \u03be is enlarged. Although this gain can not completely offset the influence of decoherence, it offers an alternative way to improve the precision under decoherence."

The effects of the two-photon relaxation. (a) The inverted variance Fg of the QRM when approaching the critical point, e.g. g = 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, with the noise parameter \u03ba = 0.05\u03c9. It is plotted against the rescaled time \u221a\n1\u2212 g2\u03c9t/\u03c0. (b) The maximum of Fg at different g\u2019s with 100\u03ba/\u03c9 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The dots are obtained from the master equation, while the curves are calculated by the numerical fitting.\n[34]. Inspired by this discovery, we study the quantum metrology in the QRM with two-photon relaxation, which can be described by the effective master equation \u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[Hnp, \u03c1] + \u03b3aD[a2] + \u03b3hD[a\u20202] [34].\nIn Fig. 5(a), we investigate the dynamics of the inverted variance for different g\u2019s under the influence of the two-photon relaxation. In contrast to the case with the single-photon relaxation, the quantum dynamics for different g\u2019s do not oscillate with the same frequency for the rescaled time. In addition, as g increases, the time to achieve the maximum becomes shorter and shorter. Moreover, we plot the maximum inverted variance as a function of \u2206g in Fig. 5(b). Interestingly, the behavior is quite different from that for the single-photon relaxation in Fig. 1(b). The maximum inverted variance increases monotonically as \u2206g is enlarged. We again numerically fit the data with the function axb and thus obtain a = 9.03 \u00d7 103 and b = 0.661 for \u03ba = 0.01\u03c9. As \u03ba increases, both a and b reduce dramatically. In other words, when we strengthen the noise, the inverted variance becomes smaller and shows weaker dependence on \u2206g. This remarkable difference can be well described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian [43, 44], when the relaxation rate is weak. When there is only single-photon relaxation, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is the original Hamiltonian Hnp plus \u2212i(\u03b3aa\u2020a + \u03b3haa\u2020)/2. Although the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, the energy spectrum is still equally-spaced, which is fundamentally required by the criticality-based metrology [2]. However, for the case with two-photon relaxation, the nonHermitian Hamiltonian is the original Hamiltonian Hnp plus \u2212i(\u03b3aa\u20202a2 + \u03b3ha2a\u20202)/2. Due to the non-linearity introduced by the two-photon relaxation, the energy spectrum is not equally-spaced and thus breaks down the underlying physical mechanism of the criticality-based metrology.\n5"

            "text": "We have investigated the impact of decoherence on the criticality-based quantum metrology in the QRM, showing that the achieved precision still diverges when approaching the criticality. In particular, we consider the single-photon relaxation described by the Lindbladform master equation. By the semiclassical equation of motion, we obtain the analytical solution for the precision characterized by the maximum inverted variance. We have shown that the precision is very sensitive to the temperature. As a remedy, we propose to improve\nthe precision by performing the squeezing operation on the initial state. Furthermore, we also investigate the performance of the metrology in the presence of twophoton relaxation. In contrast to the single-photon relaxation, the inverted variance do not oscillate against the rescaled time at the same frequency for different g\u2019s. More strikingly, the maximum inverted variance shows a completely-different tendency when closing to the quantum phase transition.\nThis work is supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 1202017 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 11674033, 11505007, and Beijing Normal University under Grant No. 2022129.\n[1] T.
