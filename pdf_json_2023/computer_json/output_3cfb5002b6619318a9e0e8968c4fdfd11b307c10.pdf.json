    "abstractText": "Objective We propose a deep learning-guided approach to generate voxel-based absorbed dose maps from whole-body CT acquisitions. Methods The voxel-wise dose maps corresponding to each source position/angle were calculated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations considering patientand scanner-specific characteristics (SP_MC). The dose distribution in a uniform cylinder was computed through MC calculations (SP_uniform). The density map and SP_uniform dose maps were fed into a residual deep neural network (DNN) to predict SP_MC through an image regression task. The whole-body dose maps reconstructed by the DNN and MC were compared in the 11 test cases scanned with two tube voltages through transfer learning with/ without tube current modulation (TCM). The voxel-wise and organ-wise dose evaluations, such as mean error (ME, mGy), mean absolute error (MAE, mGy), relative error (RE, %), and relative absolute error (RAE, %), were performed. Results The model performance for the 120 kVp and TCM test set in terms of ME, MAE, RE, and RAE voxel-wise parameters was \u2212 0.0302 \u00b1 0.0244 mGy, 0.0854 \u00b1 0.0279 mGy, \u2212 1.13 \u00b1 1.41%, and 7.17 \u00b1 0.44%, respectively. The organwise errors for 120 kVp and TCM scenario averaged over all segmented organs in terms of ME, MAE, RE, and RAE were \u2212 0.144 \u00b1 0.342 mGy, and 0.23 \u00b1 0.28 mGy, \u2212 1.11 \u00b1 2.90%, 2.34 \u00b1 2.03%, respectively. Conclusion Our proposed deep learning model is able to generate voxel-level dose maps from a whole-body CT scan with reasonable accuracy suitable for organ-level absorbed dose estimation. Clinical relevance statement We proposed a novel method for voxel dose map calculation using deep neural networks. This work is clinically relevant since accurate dose calculation for patients can be carried out within acceptable computational time compared to lengthy Monte Carlo calculations. Key Points \u2022 We proposed a deep neural network approach as an alternative to Monte Carlo dose calculation. \u2022 Our proposed deep learning model is able to generate voxel-level dose maps from a whole-body CT scan with reasonable accuracy, suitable for organ-level dose estimation. \u2022 By generating a dose distribution from a single source position, our model can generate accurate and personalized dose maps for a wide range of acquisition parameters.",

            "text": "The capability of visualizing inside the human body through non-invasive medical imaging examinations is a tremendous opportunity to diagnose various pathologies. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of the prevalent imaging modalities used in the initial clinical diagnosis, follow-up, staging, radiation therapy planning, and in emergency departments to provide valuable information for a wide range of indications [1]. In addition, CT is also commonly attached to nuclear medicine instrumentation, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), for concurrent SPECT/CT [2] or PET/CT [3] imaging on hybrid imaging devices. At the same time, CT, one of the high-dose examinations, is responsible for a significant part of the ionizing radiation exposure of patients [4, 5]. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [6] suggested estimating the radiation dose delivered to patients from medical imaging procedures toward the optimization rule known as ALARA in order to minimize the risks through the appropriate use of ionizing radiation.\nThe recent emphasis on personalized medicine and patient-specific justification/optimization substantiates the critical demand to calculate specific parameters related to radiation risks [7\u201310]. The organ dose is a requirement for patient-specific dose calculation and has a good correlation with radiation risks [9]. On the other hand, it has been shown that the radiation dose delivered to specific organs can reach the deterministic dose levels, especially in serial CT examinations, which is common practice in patient follow-up, e.g., in the recent COVID-19 pandemic [11\u201313].\nThe estimation of organ doses can be performed using multiple methodologies. The most straightforward approach uses conversion factors specific to the scanning protocols. An alternative option is to use dedicated software tools, such as ImpactDose1 and Radimetrics [14]. Both abovementioned software packages proved to have a low correlation with organ doses calculated by more accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulation tools using patient-specific or reference computational models [15, 16], particularly when the\ntube current modulation (TCM) system is activated [17\u201319]. While MC calculations using patient-specific computational models is deemed to be the most accurate approach and is often regarded as the gold standard technique, its downsides, including computational time, high computational burden, and required expertise in computer programming, limit its adoption in clinical setting. Exploiting the parallel computational power of GPUs enabled MC calculations to be faster and more suited for adoption in clinical setting [20, 21]. Yet, the complexity associated with the technique remains a significant hurdle. Deep learning-based algorithms are currently used in various medical imaging applications, including image regression [22], registration [23], segmentation [24], radiation dosimetry calculation [25, 26], and optimization [27, 28]. This study aimed to develop a fully automated method to estimate patient-specific MC-based dose maps associated with whole-body (WB) CT examinations in real time using deep neural network algorithms."

Subsequently, the resulting density maps were resampled to 5\u00a0 mm3 cubic isotropic voxel size. The essential components incorporated into MC simulations, including accurate source model and protocol-related parameters, were adopted from our in-house MC simulation code developed and validated in a previous study [30]. The acquisition parameters, including tube voltage, collimation width, table speed, rotation time, pitch, and tube current modulation, were implemented in this simulation. This simulator is based on the MCNPX general-purpose Monte Carlo radiation transport code (version 2.6) [31].\nThe output of MC simulations is a 3D dose map for a single source position (SP_MC) with limited axial coverage. Monte Carlo simulations were run for multiple discrete source 1 https:// impac tdose. softw are. infor mer. com/.\n1 3\npositions to simulate helical whole-body CT scanning. A random starting location was generated for the source owing to the lack of information about the tube start angle in the DICOM header. Accordingly, a spiral motion of the source position in 2\u00a0mm axial intervals along the Z-axis (craniocaudal axis) was modeled. Finally, considering the longitudinal tube current modulation (extracted from the DICOM header for TCM), simulated dose maps for each source position were multiplied by the corresponding tube current and were superimposed to construct the complete voxel dose distribution."

Then, by keeping all parameters similar, except kVp, MC calculations were\nrepeated with 90 kVp tube voltage for patients in the test group (11 cases) plus 20 cases randomly selected from the train and validation groups to perform the fine-tuning process described later in the text. The cases from the train and validation were used for performing transfer learning and fine-tuning.\nMonte Carlo calculation of\u00a0radiation dose in\u00a0a\u00a0uniform cylinder at\u00a090 and\u00a0120 kVp\nA uniform water-filled cylinder with a 715\u00a0mm diameter located within the CT gantry was simulated, and the dose map for a single source position (zero degrees, located at the anterior point) was calculated for a large number of simulated events (4 \u00d7 1010 particles) tracked by the MC simulator. This dose map, referred to as the single-source\n1 3\nposition uniform map (SP_uniform), was calculated for two tube voltages, namely 90 and 120 kVp for a single source. It should be mentioned that the 90 kVp uniform dose maps were used for testing the network generalizability through fine-tuning.\nGeneration of\u00a0single\u2011source position images and\u00a0corresponding density maps\nThe body contour was automatically segmented on all CT images utilizing analytical image processing methods. All body contour segmentations were reviewed and confirmed visually. The MC output images (SP_MC) having a size of 96 \u00d7 144 \u00d7 17 voxels were saved, and the density map for the same axial coverage range was cropped to the same size. The SP_uniform images were cropped to the same axial coverage body contour and normalized to a conversion factor (CF) calculated by Eq.\u00a0(1) to compensate for the effect of attenuation taking place in the SP_uniform dose calculation on the large cylinder. The SP-uniform dose image calculated for the source at zero-degree position (patients\u2019 anterior in supine position) was rotated to match the desired angle (rotated SP_uniform in Fig.\u00a02 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01).\nwhere e is Euler's number, dSP_MC is the distance from the edge of the body contour to the X-ray tube source in a specific source position. dSP_uniform is the distance from the edge of a large cylinder simulated to the source in a specific\n(1)CF = e(dSP_MC\u2212dSP_uniform).\nposition. Since the cylinder size was larger than the size of our largest patient, the CF was always greater than 1. Figure\u00a02 shows the examples of SP_MC, SP_Uniform, and the corresponding CT slices when the source is in the right lateral position.\nThe two images of SP_uniform and SP_MC were normalized by all voxel intensities by a fixed value. Each source position was saved in a separate image and used for training the neural network."

Figure\u00a01 shows the steps performed in this study and examples of mentioned three images of SP_uniform, SP_MC, and density maps. The SP_unifrom in a unique source position/angle and the density map images were fed as input to the neural network to predict the SP_MC image as the output in the corresponding source position/angle. A deep residual network (ResNet) was trained in Python (TensorFlow) to generate the SP_MC images from the two mentioned inputs. The ResNet is composed of 20 convolutional layers (19 layers with kernel size 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 and the last layer with kernel size 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1) where the image size is kept constant through the different layers (no down or up pooling was applied). Different feature levels, including low, medium, and high, were extracted by using dilation of 0 (first seven layers), 2 (six middle layers), and 4 (six last layers), respectively, in a convolutional kernel. Every two\n1 3\nlayers were connected using a residual connection to avoid gradient vanishing or exploding. The training was continued for 100 epochs using the \u201cAdam\u201d optimizer and L2 loss function. The initial learning rate of 10\u22123 was reduced in a piecewise method every five epochs. The trained network was tested on the external group datasets, and the deep neural network output was named SP_DL.\nGeneralizability evaluation on\u00a090 kVp data (fine\u2011tuning)\nTo test the generalizability of the proposed model for kVps other than 120 kVp, we performed MC simulations to calculate the voxel dose maps by considering the 90 kVp spectrum on the untouched test group (11 cases) and 20 patients selected from the train and validation group. The same preprocessing steps mentioned earlier were followed to derive SP_MC, SP_uniform, and density maps at 90 kVp. According to AAPM report #148 and McCollough et\u00a0al [32] study, we used the same density maps for training the network on 90 kVp images. The model trained on the 120 kVp dataset was stored. This model with the trained weight and biases was used to initialize the new training (fine-tuning) process through transfer learning. The fine-tuning process was continued for 50 epochs with 1e-7 learning rate and the weights and biases were updated according to 90 kVp datasets with SP_unifrom and density maps as input and SP_MC image as output to the model. SP_uniform and density maps were fed to the fine-tuned network on 90 kVp training datasets, and SP_DL images at 90 kVp were generated for the same test group (11 cases). These SP_DL images were compared to SP_MC images at 90 kVp.\nDose map reconstruction from\u00a0single source positions\nThe dose maps from the single source position were corrected by factors related to the tube calibration described in a previous study [30]. The tube current was extracted from the DICOM header. Then, the dose maps corresponding to a single source position/angle were superimposed to reconstruct the whole-body dose maps (WBDM) using both SP_MC and SP_DL dose maps, referred to as WBDM_MC and WBDM_DL, respectively. The final WBDM was a matrix of 96 \u00d7 144 \u00d7 Z voxels, where Z is the image size along the Z-axis, and the voxel value is the absorbed dose in that voxel in units of milli-gray (mGy). We have considered two strategies for WBDM calculation, fixed 100\u00a0mA tube current (FTC) and TCM activated according to the actual tube current recorded from the DICOM images."

            "text": "In this work, we proposed a novel method for dose map calculation using deep neural networks through two input channels. The model estimates the radiation voxel dose map by combining the attenuation and source angle/position information from the SP_uniform image with the attenuation characteristics from the density map image (Figure\u00a02). This model predicts the dose distribution corresponding to a single source position/angle around the patient's body, which can be an excellent option to calculate the absorbed doses with a lower interval in the source position movements, which proved to be more realistic [30]. Other acquisition parameters, such as pitch, scan mode (spiral, sequential), rotation time, and other parameters, such as tube current, could be modeled by providing single-source position dose\n1 3\nmaps. This capability of calculating single source position and angle enables the calculation of whole-body dose maps in more complicated acquisition settings, such as organbased TCM algorithms where the tube current is reduced in anterior arcs. The proposed DNN model generates a single source position/angle from two inputs, namely SP-uniform and density maps. The DNN output (SPDL) is the absorbed dose for a fixed unit of tube current. Then, this SP_DL is multiplied by a value depending on the tube current at this point to model the TCM or FTC scenario. The DNN error is limited to the first step, i.e. the TCM/FTC tube current correction is reproducible and there is no error in this step. This feature makes our model parameter-free and our results\nconfirmed this assertion by showing so close errors for TCM and FTC scenarios. Acquisition parameters may be divided into two subcategories:\ni. Parameters affecting the tube output, such as manufacturer/model parameters (inherent beam filtration, anode material, anode angel, high-frequency characteristics,\u2026), kVp, tube current wither as a fixed value (FTC), modulated according to patient body habitus (TCM), or more recent organ-based TCM.\nii.

If a TCM algorithm is used, the tube current at each point depends on the geometry of the tube source with respect to the patient\u2019s body.\nUsing our proposed methodology, all parameters in the second category can be modeled since they depend on (i) the position, angle, and distance of the source to patient\u2019s body and (ii) patient\u2019s body shape and composition. Our model can extract the related information for model \u201ci\u201d from the SP-uniform image and \u201cii\u201d from the patient density map. Among the above-mentioned parameters, the only parameter which affects the beam energy spectrum (for a single scanner) is tube voltage. We attempted to fine-tune our trained network on 120 kVp using another kVp (90 kVp) to demonstrate that this limitation may be overcome with less effort through transfer learning. In other words, the proposed model is a parameter-free protocol except for the scanner manufacturer/model and kVp, where the same results can be achieved through fine-tuning. It should be emphasized that MC simulations are necessary for fine-tuning (training again) for a new kVp or scanner/model. Conversely, after fine-tuning or when using the model for the same kVp and scanner/model, the inference step does not require MC calculations.\nThe model\u2019s generalizability was examined through transfer learning to a different kVp dataset and fine-tuning the model. The results in terms of organ-wise dose metrics\ndemonstrated the robustness of the developed model. Our model\u2019s performance was similar when considering FTC and TCM techniques in both voxel-wise and organ-wise metrics. MC calculations take between 2 and 3 days for a total body simulation depending on patient\u2019s size. While our proposed methodology can be performed within few minutes taking advantage of fast parallel processing on GPUs, this computation time is acceptable for achieving a dose map comparable with MC calculations in terms of accuracy. Besides, the dose map calculation is feasible for an acquisition performed using dual-source CT scanners or single-source scanners operating in dual-energy mode by considering the source from each kVp (X-ray tube) as a single source position/ angle. However, owing to the different energy ranges and detector technology in new photon-counting CT detectors, additional fine-tuning cases or different strategies for finetuning might be needed. Caution is commended when using fine-tuning strategy in this particular case.\nThe patients included in the training and test datasets covered a wide range of body shapes and BMIs. As shown in Figure\u00a04, the model is robust against patient size and composition changes. Wang et\u00a0al [35] proposed analytic linear Boltzmann modeling of the radiation dose in an anthropometric phantom. They reported errors of less than 3%, but their model was specific for a single phantom and didn't consider variability in the human body. Although performed independently, our study bears some similarities with the study published by Maier et\u00a0al [25]\n1 3\n1 3\nin the sense that we used two channel inputs to our model to predict the voxel dose maps. We used whole-body CT images covering a larger axial field-of-view range from the skull to mid-thigh and trained a single general model for the full coverage. The single general model applicable to all scan protocols is easier to implement. They introduced multiple models by changing the parameters, while the generalizability is more practical in daily clinical routine by accessing single source dose maps. Besides, our proposed methodology is capable of reconstructing the dose maps directly from CT images without additional time-consuming deterministic methods for solving the Boltzmann transport equation.\nTzanis et\u00a0al [26] used DL to generate voxel dose maps calculated by Monte Carlo simulations by converting the image into a long vector and introducing scan parameters, such as tube current and scan mode, as additional columns. They included 343 head and neck scans and reported organ doses delivered to three tissues/organs, including the brain, cranial bones, and eye lens, with average errors less than 6% (range 0\u201319%) in terms of organ RAE. Our proposed model provides more accurate results in terms of organ-wise RAE (average 2.74). Besides, they only used 120 kVp acquisitions and a scan range limited to the head and neck region.\nOrgan masks are a critical requirement for calculating organ doses. We segmented multiple organs to evaluate the performance of our model in organ-level dose calculation. The labor-intensive and time-consuming segmentations are important limitations of using dose maps in radiation risk estimation. Despite the presence of voxels with a higher error than the average in terms of voxel-wise RAE (%), the organ dose errors were negligible, especially for large organs, such as the liver. The slightly higher error in some organ doses and voxels could be attributed to methodological limitations, such as coarse image matrix size (voxel size of 5\u00a0mm), that we adopted to reduce the computational time. The large voxel size can also cause higher errors in voxelwise metrics. The excellent performance achieved by our model in organ-level doses is much better than pre-tabulated software outputs. Moreover, we used only a single scanner to train our DL network using a limited number of patients. Although we proved the validity of the concept of transfer learning for other X-ray spectra with comparable error and robust results on the same scanner, it should be noted that each scanner, even the same model/manufacturer and has a specific output energy spectra that should be considered during fine-tuning. Still, the main bottleneck was the high computational time required to generate the Monte Carlo dose maps as ground truth. In addition, in our method, the radiation dose delivered to organs out of the scan reconstruction axial range is missing."

The whole process, including pre-processing and model inference on a new dataset, can be performed within seconds, which makes personalized dosimetry with an acceptable accuracy a possible option in clinical routine. Conversely, by generating a dose distribution from a single source position, our model can generate accurate and personalized dose maps for a wide range of acquisition parameters.\nSupplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00330- 023- 09839-y.\nFunding Open access funding provided by University of Geneva This study has received funding from the Euratom research and training programme 2019\u20132020 Sinfonia project under grant agreement no. 945196."
