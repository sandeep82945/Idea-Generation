    "abstractText": "Amidst a global pandemic, survival needs become salient and the ability of individuals to regulate feelings and actions might be particularly relevant to protecting themselves from harm. Drawing from Regulatory Focus Theory individuals who are more focused on prevention are also more likely to enact health-protective behaviours, including sexual health behaviours, because they are more aware of threats. Extending this reasoning to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a pre-registered longitudinal study with 174 individuals from 23 countries (Mage = 30.66, SD = 11.81; 77.6% women), to examine the role of regulatory focus in predicting the sexual activity of single individuals. We assessed demographic information, regulatory focus, and personality traits at baseline (T1), perceived threats two weeks later (T2), and sexual activity indicators two weeks later (T3). As hypothesised, results showed that single individuals who reported a greater focus on prevention at the onset of the pandemic perceived more pandemic-related threats and, in turn, reported less frequent sexual activity. These effects were consistent even when controlling for promotion (i.e. pleasure motives), personality, geographic location, local social distancing policies, gender, and sexual orientation. Findings are discussed considering their implications for the sexual functioning and sexual health of single individuals. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 27 September 2021 Accepted 05 July 2022",

Drawing from Regulatory Focus Theory individuals who are more focused on prevention are also more likely to enact health-protective behaviours, including sexual health behaviours, because they are more aware of threats. Extending this reasoning to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a pre-registered longitudinal study with 174 individuals from 23 countries (Mage = 30.66, SD = 11.81; 77.6% women), to examine the role of regulatory focus in predicting the sexual activity of single individuals. We assessed demographic information, regulatory focus, and personality traits at baseline (T1), perceived threats two weeks later (T2), and sexual activity indicators two weeks later (T3). As hypothesised, results showed that single individuals who reported a greater focus on prevention at the onset of the pandemic perceived more pandemic-related threats and, in turn, reported less frequent sexual activity. These effects were consistent even when controlling for promotion (i.e. pleasure motives), personality, geographic location, local social distancing policies, gender, and sexual orientation. Findings are discussed considering their implications for the sexual functioning and sexual health of single individuals.\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 27 September 2021 Accepted 05 July 2022\nKEYWORDS COVID-19; regulatory focus; sexual activity; sexual risk; perceived threat; singles\nSince the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020, governments and local authorities have implemented guidelines for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation aimed at controlling the rapid spread of infections (e.g. Courtemanche et al., 2020). Faced with these disruptions, some people experienced negative reactions (e.g. increased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness; Bu et al., 2020; Robinson et al., 2022) that could have had consequences on their sexual functioning, activity, satisfaction, and desire (for reviews, see, Delcea et al., 2021; Masoudi et al., 2022).\nPast research has already shown that the ability to self-regulate feelings and actions \u2013 that is, to have control over oneself \u2013 predicts health and sexual behaviours (Moilanen, 2015; Vohs & Baumeister, 2011; De Wit et al., 2018). For example, individuals with higher self-regulation were less likely to enact health-threatening behaviours later on, including unprotected sex (Quinn & Fromme, 2010). Regulatory Focus Theory (Higgins, 1998, 2015) proposes that self-regulation operates differently when serving different needs and goals. Individuals more focused on prevention are\nCONTACT David L.

These individuals are more likely to engage in protective behaviours because they are more aware of potential threats and believe they have greater control over their behaviours (Lemari\u00e9 et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2019). In contrast, individuals more focused on promotion are motivated by pleasure, seek to obtain gains even at the cost of negative outcomes, and experience positive affect by the anticipation of such outcomes (Higgins et al., 2001; Idson et al., 2000). These individuals are more likely to make riskier decisions and believe they have control over the outcomes (Guo & Spina, 2015; Langens, 2007).\nIn times of heightened health risk \u2013 much like the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 survival needs (i.e. security and nurturance) can become more salient, and being able to self-regulate behaviours according to security motives may determine health-protective actions. During the lockdown, meeting partners to have sex represented a source of risk that some individuals may have been more (or less) willing to take. For example, some individuals ignored social distancing policies and risked exposure during periods of quarantine to have casual sex (e.g. Ballester-Arnal et al., 2021; Hammoud et al., 2020; Shilo & Mor, 2020). On the other hand, individuals who were single and more focused on prevention (vs. promotion) had weaker intentions to have casual sex (Rodrigues, 2021b), but there is no evidence of whether these intentions translated into actual sexual activity. Hence, we sought to extend past findings and test the role of regulatory focus in predicting the sexual activity of single individuals at the onset of the pandemic. That is, we examined if individuals more focused on prevention (i.e. security motives) perceived more pandemic-related threats two weeks later and in turn enacted less sexual activity the following two weeks."

            "text": "The pandemic had an impact on relationship functioning (Pietromonaco & Overall, 2021). For example, experiencing more pandemic-related stressors (e.g. perceived threat, financial strain, loneliness, and stress) predicted more conflicts and poorer relationship quality later on (Balzarini, Muise, Zoppolat, Di Bartolomeo et al., 2022). The effects of the pandemic on sexual behaviour and sexual desire have been more complex. Even though most individuals experienced decreases in sexual frequency, had sex with fewer partners, and enacted more risky sexual behaviours (e.g. condomless sex), some individuals have also experienced positive outcomes (e.g. Balzarini, Muise, Zoppolat, Gesselman et al., 2022; Dacosta et al., 2021; Hammoud et al., 2020; Lehmiller et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020; Rodrigues, 2021a; Shilo & Mor, 2020; Wignall et al., 2021). We argue that being exposed to external stressors may help explain this overall negative pattern. For example, individuals who experienced more conflicts with their partners during the pandemic also reported less frequent intimate (e.g. hugging, kissing) and sexual behaviours (e.g. oral sex, intercourse; Luetke et al., 2020). Other studies highlighted the importance of knowledge and risk perception to sexual functioning. For example, individuals who were more knowledgeable about COVID-19 (e.g. knew more about the ways of transmission), and those who enacted more protective behaviours (e.g. adhered to social distancing), reported a decrease in intercourse and oral sex frequency with their partners during the pandemic (Hensel et al., 2020). Moreover, individuals who perceived more pandemic-related risks were more likely to report negative changes in their sexual activity (Ko et al., 2020).\nAlthough these studies provide interesting insights into sexual behaviours during the pandemic, it is important to disentangle the sexual behaviours of individuals according to their relationship status. Some studies have done so. For example, Hille et al. (2021) found that single individuals engaged in partnered sexual activities (e.g. oral sex and intercourse) less frequently than individuals in a romantic relationship. Instead, single individuals tended to increase their engagement in solo sexual activities (e.g. masturbatory behaviours), mostly because they wanted to protect themselves and others from contracting or spreading COVID-19, and because there was no partner(s) readily\n220 D. L. RODRIGUES ET AL.\navailable to have sex with. This decrease in partnered sexual activity was particularly evident among individuals who were single and living alone (vs. with a romantic partner; Griffin et al., 2022). Furthermore, recent research has found that single individuals were more likely to have had sex during confinement with someone they already knew and less likely to do so with a new acquaintance (Herbenick et al., 2022). Given that single individuals tended to perceive sexual activity with anyone (and not only with less known casual partners) as a risky sexual practice (Bowling et al., 2021), we argue that risk perception and security enactment might have determined single individuals\u2019 sexual behaviours and risk-taking during the pandemic.\nThe role of regulatory focus in shaping health behaviours\nRegulatory focus can be conceptualised as a trait-like orientation that motivates individuals to pursue goals in different domains but also as a state-like orientation elicited by specific situational stimuli (Higgins, 1998), and the risk-regulating effects of having a prevention focus on health behaviours tend to endure over time. For example, individuals more focused on prevention were more likely to maintain smoking cessation after attending an intervention and reported fewer relapses in smoking behaviour 15 months later (Fuglestad et al., 2013). By being more focused on prevention, individuals take fewer risks with their health and safety (Zou & Scholer, 2016) and are more likely to engage in different health-protective behaviours, such as wearing a helmet (Aryee & Hsiung, 2016), adhering to medical care prescription/advice (Avraham et al., 2016), adhering a vaccine (Leder et al., 2015), engaging in screening(s) for cancer (Ferrer et al., 2017), or using condoms with casual partners (Rodrigues, Lopes et al., 2022; Rodrigues et al., 2020).\nResearch at the onset of the pandemic has already examined the role of regulatory focus in modulating risk perception, health behaviours, and overall functioning. For example, individuals more focused on prevention were also more motivated to retrieve COVID-19 knowledge from more objective sources of information (e.g. official health reports; Rodrigues, 2021b). Being more focused on prevention predicted more negative affective experiences if individuals felt less supported by their close social network (Rodrigues, Zoppolat et al., 2022) but at the same time more risk awareness and more preventive behaviours enactment (e.g. washing hands more frequently; Rodrigues, Lopes, & Balzarini 2022).\nTo the best of our knowledge, studies have yet to examine if and why regulatory focus informed the sexual behaviours of single individuals at the onset of the pandemic. Single individuals are potentially exposed to different infections when they pursue sexual activity and perceived casual sex as a particularly risky practice during the pandemic (Bowling et al., 2021). As such, having a predominant focus on prevention might have negatively impacted their sexual behaviour with casual partners (Rodrigues, 2021b) and this might have occurred due to perceptions of pandemicrelated risks and threats (e.g. Lehmiller et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). Aligned with this reasoning, past research has shown that individuals concerned with external threats (e.g. STI transmission) are likely to inhibit their sexual responses, have lower sexual desire, are less inclined to seek out sexual stimuli, have less positive attitudes towards casual sex, are less prone to sexual risks, and have greater germ aversion (Bancroft et al., 2009; Duncan et al., 2009; Murray et al., 2013; Velten, 2017). A similar effect was observed when a COVID-19 threat was experimentally made more salient to participants (Moran et al., 2021). As motives, attitudes, and actions towards sexual behaviours determine personal health, examining regulatory focus might be crucial to understanding the implications of enacting (or not) sexual behaviours during health-threatening times."

As sexual activity with casual partners presented extra health\nPSYCHOLOGY & SEXUALITY 221\nrisks during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic (Bowling et al., 2021), we expected regulatory focus to determine the sexual activity of single individuals. Specifically, single individuals more focused on prevention (controlling for promotion) at baseline (T1) should engage in intercourse and oral sex less frequently and have sex with fewer partners four weeks later (at T3; Hypothesis 1).\nWe further sought to test whether the perception of pandemic-related threats was one of the mechanisms explaining the impact of regulatory focus on sexual activity. In the face of pandemicrelated stressors, individuals more focused on prevention perceived more risks and were more worried about becoming infected (Rodrigues, Lopes, & Balzarini 2022). As such, individuals more focused on prevention at T1 should perceive more pandemic-related threats two weeks later (T2; Hypothesis 2). As threat perceptions have been associated with risk-taking, sexual functioning, and sexual behaviours (Bancroft et al., 2009; Duncan et al., 2009; Hensel et al., 2020; Ko et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2013; Velten, 2017), we also expected threat perceptions to explain the negative impact of a predominant prevention focus on sexual activity (Hypothesis 3). These hypotheses are depicted in Figure 1 and were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF).\nLastly, we ruled out the potential effects that a priori contextual differences (e.g. local policies and restrictions) and demographic differences (e.g. age, gender) might have had in shaping perceptions and behaviours during the first months of the pandemic."

This project was launched on March 27th, 2020, shortly after the global pandemic was declared (for a detailed description). The survey was originally available in English and then translated to 10 other languages following the typical back-translation procedure (Colina et al., 2017). Prospective participants were recruited through the project\u2019s website (https://loveinthetimeofcovid.me/), social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit), and word of mouth, and had to be 18 years or older to participate. We invited individuals to participate in a global longitudinal study that examined how people connected, related, and coped during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provided a link that redirected individuals to a survey hosted on Qualtrics. Participation was completely voluntary, and no compensation was offered. After providing informed consent, participants proceeded to the baseline assessment (T1). Upon completion, they were asked to provide their email addresses to take part in the follow-up surveys every two weeks throughout the pandemic. This was voluntary and participants were again guaranteed confidentiality and that their responses would be kept anonymous. The complete\n222 D. L. RODRIGUES ET AL.\nstudy\u2019s design, procedures, and materials can be consulted on the project\u2019s OSF page, and were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Georgia (USA) before the project was launched (IRB ID: PROJECT00002117).\nThe current study uses data from the first three time points (T1-T3), measured two weeks apart (covering one month). To be included in analyses, participants had to be single (i.e. not in a committed relationship) throughout the three waves of data collection, with less than 10% missing data on the main measures under examination. The surveys included other measures that were not considered for this study. Also, participants were allowed to skip the questions related to sexual behaviour without compromising their participation. The combination of these criteria yielded 183 single individuals with valid responses in all three waves of data collection. As commonly employed in the literature (e.g. Berinsky et al., 2014; Curran, 2016), we also included four attention check questions. At T1, two items asked participants to select a particular answer choice for that question (e.g. \u2018Please select \u201cAgree a little\u201d. This is not a trick question\u2019.). At T2 and T3, we asked participants \u2018How much attention did you pay to this questionnaire while you were completing it?\u2019. Possible responses were on a 4-point scale (1 = No attention, 2 = Very little attention, 3 = Moderate amount of attention, 4 = Very close attention). Participants who did not correctly answer at least one of these attention checks at T1 (n = 1), and those who indicated they paid very little or no attention to the survey at T2 (n = 5) and T3 (n = 3) were not included in analyses. This resulted in a final sample size of 174 single individuals from 23 countries. Participants had a mean age of 30 years (M = 30.66, SD = 11.81) and were mostly female (77.6%), heterosexual (64.9%), and university graduates (31.5%) (see, Table 1 for details)."

Nevertheless, we proceeded to test indirect effects given that significant total effects are not a necessary condition for mediation (for discussions, see, Hayes, 2009; Rucker et al., 2011; Shrout & Bolger, 2002).\nAs hypothesised in our preregistration, participants more focused on prevention perceived more pandemic-related threats two weeks later, all p \u2264 .0472 (Hypothesis 2), which, in turn, predicted less frequent intercourse, p = .025, and oral sex, p = .029, and a lower number of sex partners, p = .034, in the two weeks that followed (Hypothesis 3).

Using this variable as a covariate in our models did not change the pattern of results (see Supplemental Materials S1 for details).

            "text": "The current study showed that being more focused on prevention at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with more threat perceptions later on, which then were associated with less sexual activity among single individuals. These results could not be accounted for having a predominant focus on promotion (i.e. pleasure motives) or local social distancing policies, and were consistent across gender. The finding that results became weaker after controlling for personality suggests that negative emotionality also played role in the perception of pandemic-related threats, much like having a predominant focus on prevention.\nResearch has shown that the experience of external stressors due to the pandemic has had a negative influence on sexual behaviour (e.g. Cito et al., 2021; Ko et al., 2020; Lehmiller et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020; Wignall et al., 2021) and the pandemic has made access to partnered physical sex more difficult for single individuals (e.g. Hille et al., 2021). Congruently, we found an overall low frequency of sexual activity and a low number of sex partners in our data. However, not all individuals\u2019 sexual activity suffered during the pandemic and our work highlights that regulatory focus played an important role in predicting the frequency of sexual behaviours.\nWe showed, for the first time, that prevention focus indirectly shaped the sexual activity of single individuals, an effect driven, at least in part, by the perceptions of threats caused by the pandemic (Hypotheses 2 and 3). More specifically, individuals concerned about their health and focused on their security reported a heightened perception of pandemic-related threats and then indicated having intercourse and oral sex less frequently (the indirect effect on the number of sex partners was non-significant). Our findings converge with past studies showing that perceived threats to one\u2019s safety foster different health-protective behaviours. For example, studies framed by the InformationMotivation-Behavioural Skills Model (for a review, see, Fisher et al., 2003) show that motivations to avoid risky behaviours (e.g. heightened by the perception of health risks) are associated \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 with health-protective behaviours, such as using medications as prescribed (Bian et al., 2015), intentions and use of PrEP medication (Walsh, 2019), or using condoms (Espada et al., 2016). Similarly, studies framed by the Health Belief Model (for a review, see, Skinner et al., 2015) show that perceived vulnerability to risk and its expected severity are associated \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 with health-protective behaviours, including a lower likelihood of starting to smoke (Song et al., 2009), HPV vaccine uptake (Gerend & Shepherd, 2012), being more assertive with their partners regarding condom use (Wright et al., 2012), and condom use (Reid & Aiken, 2011). Our study suggests that similar mechanisms occurred throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and extends this body of\n226 D. L. RODRIGUES ET AL.\nliterature by highlighting that motivations for security, through perceived threat, can increase general health behaviours enactment (e.g. social distancing; Rodrigues, Lopes, & Balzarini 2022) and decrease the likelihood of engaging in sexual activity.\nNotably, our indirect effects occurred in the absence of a direct effect of prevention focus on sexual behaviour (Hypothesis 1), suggesting that security motives were not directly detrimental to the sexual activity of single individuals. Instead, these motives shaped how single individuals perceived and reacted to the context, and consequently how they approached sex and pursued (or not) sexual activity. As such, threat perceptions seem to have protected individuals against taking health risks at the onset of the pandemic and resulted in worse sexual functioning (Hensel et al., 2020; Ko et al., 2020) and more negative affective experiences (Rodrigues, Zoppolat et al., 2022). In times when physical proximity can be detrimental to one\u2019s own and others\u2019 health, engaging in casual sex may have been perceived by some individuals as a risk not worth taking (e.g. Bowling et al., 2021). For example, individuals are less willing to have casual sex when they perceive themselves to be more susceptible to infectious diseases (Duncan et al., 2009), when the threat of infection is more salient to them (Moran et al., 2021; Murray et al., 2013), and when they are more focused on prevention (Rodrigues et al., 2019). As individuals more focused on prevention feel less safe having sex with casual partners (Rodrigues et al., 2020) and are more attentive to health risks (Rodrigues et al., 2019), they might be less motivated to have sex in general \u2013 and not only during the pandemic \u2013 as a strategy to preserve their health and avoid risky sexual behaviours. Thus, while the sexual life of single individuals seems to have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, regulatory focus may have been functional for safeguarding physical health.\nStrengths, limitations, and future directions\nThis study had several strengths that give us confidence in the results reported here and allowed us to better understand how regulatory focus may have been influencing sexual behaviour during the pandemic. Specifically, our study was pre-registered and had a prospective design spanning one month that allowed us to examine temporal effects predicted a priori. This work extended previous research examining individuals\u2019 reported intentions to engage in sexual activity (e.g. Rodrigues, 2021b) and examined actual behaviours, providing greater insight into sexual activity during the pandemic. Also, this study relied on a sample of participants from around the world, albeit primarily from western countries. Worth noting, our findings were consistent even after controlling for the social distancing policies in effect across different countries and regions. This means that our effects were not driven by greater adherence to local health policies, providing support for the generalisability of our current findings.\nDespite these strengths, some limitations must also be acknowledged. Apart from the typical attrition observed in longitudinal designs, participants in this study were given the option to answer questions about their sexual lives, including their sexual behaviours and sexual health decisions (e.g. condom use). Some of our participants decided to skip these questions, which forced us to test our hypotheses with a smaller sample size than we anticipated in the pre-registration. However, we must also acknowledge that sample size estimations were highly conservative (f2 = .025) and that sensitivity analyses showed that we had enough power to detect small effect sizes in our data. Past research has suggested that women and educated individuals are more likely to participate in sex research (e.g. Fenton et al., 2001; Senn & Desmarais, 2001), which may explain some bias and gender differences in our sample. Moreover, although some researchers have discussed the reliability and validity of singleitem measures (e.g. Bergkvist & Rossiter, 2007; Jovanovi\u0107 & Lazi\u0107, 2020), we assessed our main variables using one or two item measures. All these issues raise questions regarding the representativeness of our sample and the generalisability of our findings that should be addressed in future studies. For example, researchers should seek to replicate our current findings with a larger sample, more extensive and validated measures, and additional sexual health measures to increase power and provide a broader understanding of regulatory focus. We were also unable to determine if individuals more focused on\nPSYCHOLOGY & SEXUALITY 227\nprevention tended to experience declines in sexual activity because of perceiving more threats or simply because they avoided all types of sexual activity, were more restrictive in safety negotiations with their partners (e.g. have sex only after getting tested for COVID-19), or enacted other forms of sex. For example, individuals motivated by security could have chosen to engage in sexual activities that did not require physical contact (e.g. sexting, video sex, online dating). By doing so, individuals could control the risks of infection and safeguard their health, while being able to pursue sexual, social, and affective needs. Likewise, we were unable to distinguish between individuals who were pursuing sex with partners outside their immediate social circle (i.e. strangers or less known partners), those who pursued sex with partners from within this circle (e.g. ex-partners; roommates; friends with benefits), or even if individuals were living with potential partners at some point while describing themselves as single (e.g. Griffin et al., 2022; Herbenick et al., 2022). Future research should seek to examine not only the type of partners and living status but also the diversity in sexual behaviours (Lehmiller et al., 2021), as individuals may have shifted the sexual activity they engaged in or the partners with whom they had sex when considering the health risks associated with in-person activities amidst the pandemic."

Yet, the ability to regulate feelings and actions seems to have been vital for individuals to navigate these troubled times and protect their health. In the current longitudinal study with single individuals, we showed that security motives predicted individuals\u2019 perceptions of pandemic-related threats, resulting in decreased sexual activity. In health-threatening times, stressors negatively impact the way individuals are sexually relating to each other. Whereas some evidence suggests that favouring health security might be key to protecting oneself from harm (e.g. Avraham et al., 2016; Fuglestad et al., 2013; Leder et al., 2015; Rodrigues, Lopes, & Balzarini 2022), our study suggests that it also might come at costs for sexual functioning."
