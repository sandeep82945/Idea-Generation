 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore using CosSIF for similarity calculation in other computer vision tasks like image retrieval, object detection, etc. The algorithm can be adapted to find visually similar images/objects.

2. Investigate the efficacy of FBGT and FAGT on other imbalanced medical imaging datasets like diabetic retinopathy, pneumonia detection, etc. This could further validate the usefulness of the methods.

3. Try combining FBGT and FAGT into a single pipeline to see if it further boosts model performance. The filtered outputs of FBGT can be input to FAGT for additional filtering.

4. Experiment with more advanced GAN architectures like StyleGAN3, CycleGAN, etc. Using newer GANs may further enhance the quality of synthetic images generated.

5. Implement the methods on 3D medical images like CT scans and MRI images which also suffer from class imbalance. This could demonstrate the versatility of the techniques.
