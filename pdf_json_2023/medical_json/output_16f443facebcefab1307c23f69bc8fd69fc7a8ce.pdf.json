The current study aims to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the endometrium on the basis of immune cell infiltration characteristics between RIF patients and healthy controls, as well as to investigate potential prognostic markers in RIF.\nMethods:GSE103465, and GSE111974 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained to screen DEGs between RIF and control groups. Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Protein-protein interactions analysis were performed to investigate potential biological functions and signaling pathways. CIBERSORT was used to describe the level of immune infiltration in RIF, and flow cytometry was used to confirm the top two most abundant immune cells detected.\nResults: 122 downregulated and 66 upregulated DEGs were obtained between RIF and control groups. Six immune-related hub genes were discovered, which were involved in Wnt/-catenin signaling and Notch signaling as a result of our research. The ROC curves revealed that three of the six identified genes (AKT1, PSMB8, and PSMD10) had potential diagnostic values for RIF. Finally, we used cMap analysis to identify potential therapeutic or induced compounds for RIF, among which fulvestrant (estrogen receptor antagonist), bisindolylmaleimide-ix (CDK and PKC inhibitor), and JNK-9L (JNK inhibitor) were thought to influence the pathogenic process of RIF. Furthermore, our findings revealed the level of immune infiltration in RIF by highlighting three signaling pathways (Wnt/-catenin signaling, Notch signaling, and immune response) and three potential diagnostic DEGs (AKT1, PSMB8, and PSMD10).\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nConclusion: Importantly, our findings may contribute to the scientific basis for several potential therapeutic agents to improve endometrial receptivity.\nKEYWORDS\nrecurrent implantation failure, immune infiltration, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, notch signaling, biomarkers, bioinformatics"

            "text": "Although there is no unified definition for recurrent implantation failure (RIF), it is usually referring to women who fail to achieve a clinical pregnancy after the transfer of at least four high-quality embryos in a minimum of three fresh or frozen cycles in a woman under the age of 40 years (1, 2). As multiple failed cycles can often cause frustration and desperation for the struggling couples, the causes for these failures remain unknown. According to a recently published retrospective cohort study, the incidence of RIF was around 5% in women who had an anatomically normal uterus and underwent consecutive single euploid blastocyst transfer (3), among which 50% of affected cases remain unexplained. It is essential and urgent to determine the etiology of idiopathic RIF and propose novel therapeutic approaches for these patients.\nThe success of embryo implantation depends on embryonic and endometrial factors. With the innovative breakthrough in preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), abnormal embryos can be discriminated by screening and selection technologies (4). The interventions targeting endometrium have also been more matured in the past decade. For instance, such developments include optimized IVF protocols to synchronize cooperation between the endometrium and the embryo, antibiotic regimens to revert endometrial dysfunction resulting from chronic endometritis (5), and surgical management to rectify congenital uterine malformation and intrauterine adhesion. Nevertheless , endometrium is a complicated tissue composed of various cell types that are dynamically adapted during the window of implantation (WOI) to support the apposition, attachment and invasion of embryo in a synchronic way. The elements involved in this endometrial transformation may open an avenue to elucidate other potential causes and therapeutic targets of implantation failure.\nIn recent years, increasing accumulated evidence suggests the fundamental role of immunologic factors in embryo implantation. Women with RIF are usually manifested by abnormal immune signaling in the endometrium and peripheral blood, which is particularly characterized by altered Th1/Th2 ratio, and disrupted NK cell and macrophage numbers (6, 7). Additionally, in the endometrium of patients with RIF, the levels of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors such as IL2, IL6, IFNG, IL17A, IL23A, CCR4, CCR5, CXR3, CCL2, TLR4 are aberrant (8). Further studies are still needed to determine whether these are causative of RIF or just a secondary event. Though the contribution of immune factors in endometrium receptivity can be further explored with the application of RNA-sequencing, the sample sizes\n02\nin these studies are usually very small, ranging from 9 to 48 samples (9\u201311), and the immune cell distribution was not analyzed comprehensively. Therefore, it is intriguing to do an in-depth review of the immune network in the endometrium by a systematic analysis of global infiltrating levels of various immune cells and potential immunologic-related markers for the direction of future studies.\nBioinformatics analysis on gene expression microarray has been recommended as a powerful weapon to explore potential biomarkers and signaling pathways in complicated diseases for understanding the pathogenesis and therapeutic development (12). By using microarray data from a publicly accessible database, we further evaluated the differently expressed genes (DEG) in the endometrium of women with RIF and control patients for processing by functional enrichment analysis. To further characterize the features of immune response enriched by aforementioned analysis, we investigated the panorama of immune infiltration by CIBERSORT, and the main findings were preliminarily verified by flow cytometry. With the identification of some immune signaling-related genes, the corresponding ROC curves were plotted for the potential diagnostic values of RIF. Moreover, potential drugs and their potential molecular targets in RIF were identified by cMAP analysis. In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the immune infiltration levels and signaling pathways in women with RIF, and to reveal the potential immune signaling-related biomarkers or therapeutic targets for RIF."

GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were mainly associated with cell cycle, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, NOTCH signaling, immune system regulation, ATP metabolic process, cellular protein catabolic process, lipid biosynthetic process, and thyroid hormone signaling pathway (Figure 3A). While for the GSEA analysis, activation of immune response and positive regulation of leukocyte migration were remarkably increased in patients with RIF, and cilium movement and steroid hormone biosynthesis were suppressed in patients with RIF (Figure 3B). Besides immune system regulation, rose diagram of the validation dataset (GSE183837) showed the genes in the pathways of cell cycle, the Wnt/b-catenin signaling, NOTCH signaling, ATP metabolic process, cellular protein catabolic process, lipid biosynthetic process, and thyroid hormone signaling pathway were significantly downregulated in patients with RIF (Figure 3C).\n3.4 Identification and functional enrichment analysis of hub genes\nTo further evaluate the significance of the genes in the PPI network of DEGs, the top 20 hub genes were obtained from PPI network by using cytoHubba and presented in Figure 4A.

The percentage of each of the 22 types of immune cells in each sample is shown in the bar plot, and it was intuitively illustrated that most of the endometrial immune cells were NK cells, followed by macrophages, accounting for approximately 30% of total cells which is similar to previous studies (25, 26). The boxplot of the infiltration levels of various immune cells was sorted according to their median proportion in the RIF group, suggesting that NK and macrophages were the top two of the most abundant immune cells. The relative proportions of activated NK cells and macrophages were not\nfrontiersin.org\nF rontiers in Immu\nnology frontiersin.org07\nsignificantly different between the two groups, but M0 macrophages were significantly increased in women with RIF (p<0.05) (Figure 5B).

As shown in Figure 5C, we found that the proportion of endometrial immune cells in patients with RIF and Ctrl patients also changed by single-cell RNA sequencing (GSE183837). Since NK cells and macrophages were the top two abundant cells in endometrium during the WOI and their crucial roles in implantation is unneglectable, we further measured the proportions of endometrial NK cells and macrophages of patients with RIF and healthy women by FCM to validate the changes. Our data showed that the proportions of macrophages and NK cells were significantly increased in the endometrium of patients with RIF, and the proportions of CD16+ macrophage and CD16+ NK cells were also elevated (Figures 6A, B), which echoed the results of array in Figure 5 partly. These data implied that RIF was associated with abnormally elevated NK cells and macrophages numbers, as well as increased cytotoxicity."

            "text": "It is a widely-accepted consensus that the process of embryo implantation is analogous to seed germination, in which the quality of the seed (the embryo) and the receptivity of soil (the endometrium) are both indispensable to successful implantation. In order to promote the success for embryo implantation, the endometrium undergoes a series of changes in functioning signaling pathways\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\nand immune cell distribution, subsequently resulting in the maternal immunonutrition and tolerance of the semiallogenic fetus. To comprehend the molecular pathways connected with endometrial receptivity and the foundations of RIF, it is essential to investigate the disruptions in signaling pathways and immune responses in the local endometrium milieu.\nThe exact mechanisms underlying endometrial immunomodulation by which the embryo is shielded from the maternal immune attack remained poorly understood. As one of the predominant leukocytes in the endometrium, the effects of uNK cells on embryo implantation should not be overlooked (27). In the non-pregnant endometrium, uNK cells are mostly quiescent but they are capable to differentiate throughout the menstrual cycle in preparation for pregnancy (28). When embryo implantation is accomplished, uNK cells contribute to placentation by encouraging trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling to ensure\nfrontiersin.org\nsufficient maternal-fetal material exchange (29). Aberrant uNK activity may produce undesirable outcomes during trophoblast invasion, such as vascular remodeling, local ischemia, and oxidative stress, which are detrimental to implantation (30). According to a latest systematic review and meta-analysis (27), the proportion of CD56+ uNK was significantly elevated in patients with RIF when compared with healthy controls. Moreover, most studies found lower expressions of inhibitory receptors and increased expressions of angiogenic factors in uNK cells of women with RIF. These studies may indicate that the assessment of uNK level/activity may be developed as diagnostic tool for RIF. However, a standard reference range would still need to be established prior for use in the clinical setting. In addition to NK cells, macrophages are another significant regulator of the embryo implantation microenvironment. They have been shown to play an important role in implantation, placentation, and embryo development (6). These cells may facilitate trophoblast invasion into spiral arteries, which is related to vascular remodeling at the maternal-fetal interface. Ideal pregnancy outcome calls for appropriate proportion of M1/M2 macrophage ratio as well. However, once distorted, several complications during pregnancy have been shown to occur, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and RIF (31). In line with previous studies, our data\nFrontiers in Immunology 10\nvalidated the higher proportions of uNK cells and macrophages in RIF, notably CD16+ NK cells and CD16+ macrophages, which revealed stronger cytotoxicity to likely result in maternal immune rejection of the fetus. Nevertheless, further experimental research is still warranted for elucidating the underlying pathophysiology of NK cells and macrophages alterations.\nAs depicted above, we emphasized theWnt/b-catenin signaling as a RIF-related signaling pathway by a series of functional enrichment analysis. As shown in previous literature, Wnt/b-catenin signaling acts as a vital part involved in various biological processes ranging from development to early animal evolution and cancer (32). In particular, female reproduction in mammals was shown to be regulated by Wnt4 signaling (33). It has been reported in mice that uterine Wnt/b-catenin signaling is essential for implantation, and the suppression of Wnt4/b-catenin signaling can interferes with the process of embryo implantation (34). On the basis of animal studies, either depletion or overexpression of Wnt/b-catenin in the endometrium would led to implantation failure in mice (35). Meanwhile, Franco et al. demonstrated that the conditional knockout of Wnt4 in the uterus results in infertility and abnormal decidualization in mice (36). Similarly, Zhou et al. discovered during\nfrontiersin.org\ndecidualization that EHD1 inhibited the Wnt4/-catenin pathway in patients with RIF by regulating LRP5/6 protein activity via the endocytic route. As a Wnt4 agonist could restore a defective decidualization process, this suggesting that modulation of the EHD1-Wnt4 pathway may be a viable therapeutic target for enhancing endometrial receptivity in women with RIF (37). While studies in human, clinical research has found that the expression of seven Wnt genes (Wnt 2, 3, 4, 5a, 7a, 7b and 10b) in the endometrium during pregnancy occupied a decisive position in the regulation of survival, proliferation and differentiation in endometrial stromal cell (38).\nAnother highlighted pathway in this current study was the Notch signaling pathway. As an evolutionarily conserved pathway, Notch signaling has been shown to regulate cell proliferation, invasion, differentiation, and apoptosis (39), which contributed significantly in endometrial remodeling. Additionally, during implantation and\nFrontiers in Immunology 11\nplacentation, Notch signaling is part and parcel of maternal-fetal communication (40). As reported in previous literature, aberrant activation of canonical Notch1 signaling in the mouse uterus could decrease the level of progesterone receptor by hypermethylation that can lead to infertility (41). Likewise, hampered Notch signaling in mice is linked to the development of endometriosis which contributes to dysdecidualization through the down-regulation of FOXO1, which might lead to subsequent implantation failure (42). In a recent study involving women with endometrial disorders including RIF, endometriosis, and PCOS, the expression pattern of NOTCH pathway molecules including NOTCH1, 3, JAG1, 2, and survivin in the mid-luteal phase were distinctly expressed in the patient groups compared to controls (43).\nThese two pathways have also been demonstrated to regulate immune cell differentiation and activation in autoimmune diseases and cancers, which are commonly proposed to be a potential\nB\nC D\nA\nFIGURE 7 Expression Levels and Diagnose Significance of Hub Genes.

Whether the downregulation in Wnt/b-catenin signaling and Notch signaling in women with RIF can cause disrupted endometrial immune cell proportions or not, it is still a promising direction to further dissect the underlying mechanisms of RIF. In this regard, Nevertheless, we identified 3 hug genes (AKT1, PSMB8 and PSMD10) that have strong correlation to the two signaling pathways and immune response when discriminating women with RIF from controls. However, the performance of the predictive model was found to be unsatisfactory. This might be due to the likelihood of small sample size. Hence, further studies with a larger sample size are still needed to explore the potential of these hug genes for elucidating their key pathological pathways of RIF for potential clinical applications. In addition to diagnostic values, compounds (fulvestrant, bisindolylmaleimide-ix and JNK-9L) with potential to interfere the pathogenesis of RIF were identified based on the DEGs between women with RIF and controls. However, the exact effects of these compounds on endometrium and embryo implantation were not validated with additional studies. Further investigations on this aspect are still warranted.\nIn summary, our study demonstrated a significant difference in the transcriptional profiles between RIF group and the control group (Figure 9). Based on the 122 downregulated and 66 upregulated DEGs, PPI network and module analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed. Hub genes were further identified by STRING and CytoHubba. Upon our analysis, Wnt/b-catenin\nFIGURE 8 Drug-Target genes Interaction Network Analysis.

With our in-depth analysis, we calculated the immune infiltration level of 22 types of immune cells on validating the increase of NK cells and macrophages in women with RIF. Moreover, the DEGs were assessed to identify potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic compounds for RIF in providing strategies to tackle RIF. However, studies using a larger sample size are still needed to validate the results of the potential genes to potentially be used for diagnosis or prediction of RIF. Another limitation of this study is the lack of functional studies for the potential therapeutic compounds. Nevertheless, our current findings have helped to shed lights for potential directions toward understanding the importance of immunity during RIF.\nFrontiers in Immunology 13"
