Exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from intermediate frequency sources has increased exponentially in recent years. The consequences of this exposure on biological systems are prompting scientists to study the effects on human health. This current study aimed to determine the effects of intermediate frequency (150 kHz) EMR exposure on the vital organs of female Sprague Dawley rats. The EMR group (n = 10 animals) was exposed to a frequency of 150 kHz with an intensity of 65 ± 15 μW/cm2 for two months. The control group (n = 10 animals) was exposed to an intensity of 35 ± 15 nW/cm2. Haematological, histochemical, gross, and histopathological profiles of all major organs of all animals were then performed using standard procedures. All major organs generally showed no significant detectable effects in either the control or EMR groups. However, gross and histopathological examinations revealed the effects of EMR on the liver and lungs, which showed inflammatory changes without significant biochemical/haematological manifestations. In addition, a significant increase in serum sodium level and a decrease in serum urea level were also observed in the EMR group. It can be concluded that the current frequency and duration of exposure trigger the changes in the liver and lungs but are not sufficient to cause clinical and functional manifestations. 1. conclusions This study concluded that two months of whole-body exposure to 150 kHz IF EMR had no adverse effects on the major organs of Sprague Dawley rats, except for the liver and lungs, which showed inflammatory changes without biochemical/haematological manifestations. In addition, an increase in serum sodium levels and a decrease in serum urea levels were noted. Thus, the current frequency and duration of exposure trigger changes in the liver and lungs but are not sufficient to cause clinical and functional manifestations. Biology 2023, 12, 310 13 of 15
