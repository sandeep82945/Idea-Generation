Exploration of Synergistic Effects with Other Antimicrobial Agents: Future studies could focus on exploring the synergistic effects of EOF with other known antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds. This could potentially enhance the efficacy of traditional antibiotics or other natural extracts against drug-resistant microbial strains, providing a broader spectrum of action and reducing the necessary effective doses, thereby minimizing potential side effects.

Development of Pharmaceutical Formulations: Given EOF's promising antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, another research avenue could involve the development of pharmaceutical formulations incorporating EOF. These could range from topical applications for wound healing and skin infections to inhalable forms for respiratory tract infections, considering its efficacy against both bacterial and fungal strains.

Mechanistic Studies on Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Actions: While the paper provides initial insights into EOF's antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, detailed mechanistic studies could further elucidate how EOF interacts with microbial cells and free radicals at the molecular level. Investigating the specific pathways and cellular targets affected by EOF components could reveal new therapeutic targets and enhance our understanding of its pharmacological properties.

Toxicological and Safety Evaluations: Before EOF can be recommended for widespread use, comprehensive toxicological studies are needed to assess its safety profile in both in vitro and in vivo models. Research should include acute, sub-acute, and chronic toxicity evaluations, alongside assessments of any potential cytotoxicity to human cells. Such studies would provide critical data for determining safe dosing regimens and identifying any potential side effects or contraindications.

Clinical Trials for Specific Indications: Building on preclinical studies and mechanistic insights, conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EOF in treating specific infections or conditions associated with oxidative stress would be a crucial step forward. These trials could help in validating the therapeutic potential of EOF, optimizing dosages, and potentially leading to new, natural-based therapeutic options for infectious diseases and antioxidant-related disorders.
