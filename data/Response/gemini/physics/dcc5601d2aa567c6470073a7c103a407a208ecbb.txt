1. **Investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of P. quercetorum extracts in vivo.** The ethyl acetate extract of P. quercetorum was found to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, COX-2 and TNFα, in isolated colon specimens exposed to LPS. This suggests that the extract may have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Future studies could investigate the effects of the extract on inflammation in animal models of colitis or other inflammatory diseases.


2. **Explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of P. quercetorum extracts.** The study found that the ethyl acetate extract of P. quercetorum inhibited the expression of COX-2 and TNFα in isolated colon specimens exposed to LPS. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. Future studies could investigate the signaling pathways involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of the extract.


3. **Evaluate the potential of P. quercetorum extracts for the prevention or treatment of colon cancer.** The ethyl acetate extract of P. quercetorum was found to be cytotoxic to human colon cancer HCT116 cells. This suggests that the extract may have potential for the prevention or treatment of colon cancer. Future studies could investigate the effects of the extract on colon cancer cell growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.


4. **Investigate the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of P. quercetorum extracts.** The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of P. quercetorum extracts have not been well studied. Future studies could investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the extracts in animal models. This information would be important for designing clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the extracts in humans.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of P. quercetorum extracts in humans.** The results of the in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that P. quercetorum extracts may have potential for the prevention or treatment of various diseases. However, clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the extracts in humans. Future studies could conduct clinical trials to investigate the effects of the extracts on inflammation, colon cancer, and other diseases.
