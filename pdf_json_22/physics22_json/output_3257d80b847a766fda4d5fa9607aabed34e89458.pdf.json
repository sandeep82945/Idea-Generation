    "abstractText": "The paper presents a program for simulating electron scattering in layered materials ProxyFn. Calculations show that the absorbed energy density is three-dimensional, while the contribution of the forward-scattered electrons is better described by a power function rather than the commonly used Gaussian. It is shown that for the practical correction of the proximity effect, it is possible, nevertheless, to use the classical two-dimensional proximity function containing three parameters: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7. A method for determining the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7 from three-dimensional calculations based on MC simulation and development consideration is proposed. A good agreement of the obtained parameters and experimental data for various substrates and electron energies is shown. Thus, a method for calculating the parameters of the classical proximity function for arbitrary layered substrates based on the Monte Carlo simulation has been developed.",

            "text": "One of the most common methods for creating micro- and nanostructures in microelectronics is electron-beam lithography (EBL). Although EBL is less productive than photolithography, it turns out to be very convenient to create small structures consisting of elements of very different sizes. This makes it in demand when creating micro- and nano-objects for scientific research. Such structures can be used for studies of superconductivity [1,2], X-ray radiation [3\u20135], electrophysical properties of various materials (for example, graphene [6,7]) and in many other areas of physics. One of the features of EBL is the effect of electrons back-scattered in the substrate on the electronic resist. In this case, they carry out additional exposure of the electron resist on an area usually much larger than the size of the primary electron beam. This effect is commonly called the \u201cproximity effect\u201d [8]. Taking into account the influence and correction of the \u201cproximity effect\u201d on the dose absorbed by the electronic resist allows increasing the accuracy of electron lithography, shortens the time to fabricate structures and increases the yield of a suitable product, since it reduces the sensitivity of lithography to random errors. To correct the influence of the \u201cproximity effect\u201d when calculating the exposure dose, the proximity function (PF) is used, i.e., the distribution of the absorbed energy in the electron resist during electron-beam scattering.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3888. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15113888 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nThe classical PF I (x,y) consists of two Gaussians [8], does not change over the depth of the resist film z, is dimensionless and is normalized to unity [9,10]. It is written in the following form:\nI(x, y, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7) = exp\n( \u2212 ( r\n\u03b1 )2) \u03c0\u03b12(1 + \u03b7) + \u03b7 exp ( \u2212 ( r \u03b2 )2) \u03c0\u03b22(1 + \u03b7)\n(1)\nwhere r2 = x2 + y2, \u03b7 is the ratio of the total energy left by the reflected electrons to the energy of the forward-scattered electrons. The first Gaussian in (1) describes the distribution of the energy left in the resist by the forward-scattered electrons (characterized by parameter \u03b1), and the second one describes the distribution of the energy left in the resist by the back-scattered electrons (characterized by parameter \u03b2) [11,12]. From (1), it follows that for the practical use of PF it is necessary to know the values of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7. The experience of practical correction [10,13,14] and extensive simulations [15\u201317] show that the three parameters found in the experiment are in most cases quite enough to obtain the required lithography accuracy. There is a large number of works devoted to calculations [12,18\u201320] and to experimental measurements of PF [21\u201323]. The MC method [24] has long been used for determining the parameters of different functions describing the proximity effect [12,18\u201320] by fitting the functions to the MC calculated spatial (3D) distribution of absorbed energy. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the absorbed energy density G (r, z) for a PMMA film of thickness H0 = 1um on a silicon substrate, calculated by the Monte Carlo method. It can be seen that G (r, z) varies in the thickness of the resist and is really a 3D function. For fitting the 2D proximity function to 3D data, usually a distribution of absorbed energy at the boundary resist\u2013substrate (i.e., G (r, z = H0)) was used [12,18\u201320]. However, our experience has shown that consideration of the distribution only at the resist\u2013substrate interface or averaging over the resist thickness does not allow one to obtain PF parameters that are in good agreement with the experimental values [21]. A particularly large discrepancy arises in the determination of the \u03b7 parameter. Obviously, the cause is ignoring the process of development. Experimental methods for determining the PF parameters inevitably include development processes in the measurement procedure. When considering experimental methods, we prefer methods using resist development time (\u201cvertical\u201d methods) [21,22], over methods using measurements of the transverse dimensions of test features such as line widths or ring widths (e.g., [23]) (\u201chorizontal\u201d methods).

To start the calculation, it is necessary to know only the starting energy of electrons, film thickness, chemical formulas of materials and their density. For many elements and materials, the chemical composition and density can be selected from the built-in database. To speed up the calculation, a cyli drically symmetric and nonuniform gri ri, zj with center r = 0 on the beam axis is used. The z axis is perpendicular to the layers and directed from the out r boundary of the resi t to the sample. z = 0, r = 0 is the point f entry of elect ons into matter. The p rtition grid is s t automatically.\nThe calculation does not consider the generation, scattering and absorption of secondary electrons, to which the fast electron gives up energy during deceleration. Although it is the secondary electrons with energies up to 50 eV that do all the \u201cwork\u201d of breaking chemical bonds or forming bonds in resist molecules, their track length in materials does not exceed 10 nm [28] and can be taken into account by the convolution of the calculated absorbed energy density with the corresponding Gaussian. The Monte Carlo calculations also do not take into account the charging of dielectric layers, which can significantly change the trajectory of an electron. We believe that this problem can be effectively dealt with in electron lithography (for example, by applying a conductive film to the resist and grounding it, or by using a conductive resist). The PF calculation time for ten thousand trajectories takes several minutes."

Difficulties arise when analyzing the calculation results and fitting the simulation results. After enumerating a large number of options, the following function was chosen to interpolate the density of the distribution of the electron absorbed energy G(x,y,z) in the sections z = const:\nG(x, y, z) = C\u03b4(z)\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y) + Ca(z)( 1 + (\nr \u03b1(z)\n)2)2 \u03c0\u03b12(z) +\nCb(z) exp ( \u2212 ( r \u03b2(z) )2) \u03c0\u03b22(z) (2)\nwhere r is the distance to the beam axis. The first (delta-shaped) element in expression (2) describes the electrons of the primary beam, which have not experienced one scattering on atomic nuclei. The second and third elements in (2) describe (on a qualitative level) singly and multiply scattered electrons, respectively. The coefficient C\u03b4(z) in the first approximation decreases exponentially with the penetration depth z, as\nC\u03b4(z) = exp(\u2212z/L f )\nwhere Lf is the free length. It is inversely proportional to the total cross section of electron scattering in the resist and is equal to several tens of nanometers (about 80 nm for 25 keV electrons in PMMA). In the experiment, it is not easy to separate the first and second elements in expression (2) due to the fact that the initial electron beam is not delta-shaped. Note that the fitting parameters C\u03b4(z), Ca(z), Cb(z), \u03b1(z) and \u03b2(z) depend essentially on the depth z and, in this case, the relation \u03b1(z) << \u03b2(z) is fulfilled. To search for the fitting parameters C\u03b4(z), Ca(z), Cb(z), \u03b1(z) and \u03b2(z), it is convenient to use not the distribution density G(x,y,z) itself, but the integral density of the absorbed energy Gr(r,z) obtained from the expression:\nGr(r, z) = \u222b \u221e\nr 2\u03c0r\u2032dr\u2032G(r\u2032, z) (3)\nNote that the integral density Gr(r,z) can be given a physical meaning. Consider a special structure in the form of an infinite plane with a cut out circle of radius r. It turns out that exposure of such a structure with a single dose leads to the absorbed energy density dE/dz at the center of the circle just equal to Gr(r,z).\nUsing (2)\u2013(3), we obtain for the three-dimensional proximity function:\nGr(r, z) = C\u03b4(z)\u0398(r) + Ca(z) 1 + (\nr \u03b1(z)\n)2 + Cb(z) exp ( \u2212 ( r \u03b2(z) )2) (4)\nhere\n\u0398(\u03c1) = {\n1, \u03c1 = 0 0, \u03c1 > 0\nOn the other hand, the integrated absorbed energy density Ir(x,y) in the case of the classical proximity function (1) will be equal to:\nIr(r, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7) = \u221e\u222b\nr\n2\u03c0r\u2032dr\u2032 I ( r\u2032, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7 ) =\nexp ( \u2212 ( r\n\u03b1\n)2) + \u03b7 exp ( \u2212 (\nr \u03b2 )2) 1 + \u03b7\n(5)\nFigures 1 and 2 show an example of calculating the integrated absorbed energy density Gr(r,z) and its approximation for a 1 \u00b5m thick PMMA e-beam resist film on a 300 \u00b5m thick silicon substrate at an initial electron energy of 25 keV.

Fitting with Three Parameters: Analogue of Experiment An experimental method for determining the classical PF I(x,y,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b7) (1) was proposed in [21]. The idea of the method is to search for such parameters (\u0431, \u0432, \u0437) so that the test structure, consisting of elements of different sizes, after correcting the proximity effect (calculating the corrected dose based on the classical PF I(x,y,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b7)) and exposure the positive resist, will be revealed exactly to the substrate in the center of each element. This experimental method and the measured parameters \u0431, \u0432, \u0437 from [21] have been used for more than 20 years to correct the proximity effect in the NanoMaker software and hardware complex for electron-beam lithography (www.nanomaker.com, accessed on 26 May 2022) with consistently good results. A similar method to search for the parameters of the classical PF I(x,y,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b7) is used in this work. As in the experimental method, the calculation of the exposure dose T(x,y) (electron density per unit area) is based on the classical PF I(x,y,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b7) from expression (1), but the simulation is performed instead of actual exposure and development. The absorbed dose (density of absorbed energy per unit volume) D(x,y,z) in the simulation is calculated based on the three-dimensional PF G(x,y,z) obtained by Monte Carlo from expression (2). For the dimensionless classical PF I(x,y,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b7), the distribution of the absorbed dose D(x,y) is as follows:\n''/)','(),,,','(/),( 00 dydxTyxTyyxxIDyxD \u03b7\u03b2\u03b1\u2212\u2212=  (6) The development of a positive e-beam resist is simulated in the approximation of\nisotropic, local etching [29,30].

The resist film thickness (PMMA) is 1 micron. The substrate is Si (300 \u00b5m). he initial energy of electrons is 25 ke . he n ber of trajectories consi ere is 200,000.\nThus, the depth-dependent three-dimensional PF G(r,z) can, in principle, be used to correct the proximity effect in e-beam lithography. However, a three-dimensional PF has significantly more fitting parameters than a classical PF with only three fitting parameters (\u0431, \u0432, \u0437). This leads to a complication of calculations. On the other hand, as mentioned, the practical use (to correct the \u201cproximity effect\u201d) of the classical PF leads to good results. Therefore, our next purpose is to determine the effective parameters of a two-dimensional PF from the three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation results."

Then, the development rate V can be written as follows:\nV/V0 = (D/D0) \u03b3 (7)\nwhere \u03b3 is the contrast of the resist; and D0, V0 are the technological constants. For a positive e-beam resist, the sensitivity T0 is defined as the exposure dose at which an element with dimensions much larger than \u0432 is revealed in the center exactly to the substrate. A brief description of the approach presented in Appendix A is as follows. The proposed method consists in considering a number of circular elements of different sizes R. Exposing a circle with a uniform exposure dose results in an absorbed dose distribution with a maximum exactly at the center of any circular element at all resist depths z. From isotropic local etching theory [26,30], it follows that the development front reaches the substrate for the first time namely at the center of the round. Development times TR and TiR calculated for two different exposure models (for classical PF (5) and for three-dimensional PF (4)) are dependent on element radius R. Due to the simplicity of the elements, these times can be easily calculated by formulas. Further, such parameters of the classical PF \u0431, \u0432, \u0437 are searched with a special procedure that minimizes the objective function (9) using the ratio of the times TR/TiR. To search for \u0431, \u0432, \u0437, a set of 10 round elements of radius Rn (n = 1, . . . ,10) was used. The Rn value varied from the minimum value \u03b1(z) to the maximum value \u03b2(z), 0 \u2264 z \u2264 H0, where \u03b1(z), \u03b2(z) are the interpolation parameters of the integrated density of the absorbed energy Gr(r,z).\nThe Appendix (A4) shows that the exposure dose ratio\nTR TiR =\n( H0\u222b 0 dz Gr\u03b3(0,z) )1/\u03b3\n(1\u2212 Ir(R, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7)) (\nH0\u222b 0 dz (Gr(0,z)\u2212Gr(R,z))\u03b3\n)1/\u03b3 (8)\ndoes not contain technological parameters D0, V0, t0 and can be calculated relatively easily. The exposure dose ratios (8) were calculated (for the given parameters \u0431, \u0432, \u0437) for the entire set of circles Rn, and the objective function was composed from them.\nS = \u2211 n ( TR,n TiR,n \u2212 1 )2\n(9)\nFurther, the values of the parameters \u03b1s, \u03b2s, \u03b7s were determined by minimizing S(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7).

It seems to us that a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the Monte Carlo calculation (at least for thick resists) has not been performed before. The experimental data were taken from [21]. In the experimental method used in this work, each of the three parameters \u03b1e, \u03b2e, \u03b7e was measured in a separate test. All tests used a PMMA electronic positive resist (chemical formula CH2C(CH3)(COOCH3), density 1190 kg/m3). In calculations based on the Monte Carlo method, all three parameters \u03b1s, \u03b2s, \u03b7s were searched simultaneously. First, the data on the beam size \u0431 will be compared, and then the results of calculating \u0432 and \u0437. The value of \u0431 depends on the energy, thickness and material of the resist and does not depend at all on the type of a substrate. In addition, the experimental value of \u0431e is influenced by the initial beam size \u04310, which is determined by the electron microscope setting (focusing, astigmatism) and beam jitter. In fact, the value of \u0431s obtained by the\nMonte Carlo method should be compared with parameter \u221a\n\u03b12e \u2212 \u03b120.

The power member describing the scattering of primary electrons seemed to be nontrivial and was considered for the first time. A numerical procedure was proposed that takes into account the development of the resist and makes it possible to replace the complex 3D distribution of the absorbed energy with a classical (two-dimensional) proximity function with three parameters \u0431, \u0432, \u0437. The examples of calculating the parameters \u03b1s, \u03b2s, \u03b7s of the proximity function were shown for different energies of electrons and substrates and their comparison with the experimental data \u03b1e, \u03b2e, \u03b7e.

Then for a circle with the radius R:\ntR = (\nD0 T )\u03b3 H\u222b 0 dz (Gr(0, z)\u2212 Gr(R, z))\u03b3V0\n(A3)\nThe \u201cideal\u201d exposure dose TiR can be obtained from expression (A3), at which a circle with the radius R in the center is revealed to the bottom for a given development time t0:\nTiR = D0\n(V0t0) 1 \u03b3  H0\u222b 0 dz (Gr(0, z)\u2212 Gr(R, z))\u03b3  1 \u03b3\nThe sensitivity of the positive resist T0 can also be calculated using this expression at R = \u221e:\nT0 = D0\n(V0t0) 1 \u03b3  H0\u222b 0 dz Gr\u03b3(0, z)  1 \u03b3\nAs a result, the ratio of exposure doses TR/TiR is obtained, which does not contain unknown technological parameters D0, V0 and t0:\nTR TiR =\n( H0\u222b 0 dz Gr\u03b3(0,z) )1/\u03b3\n(1\u2212 Ir(R, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7)) (\nH0\u222b 0 dz (Gr(0,z)\u2212Gr(R,z))\u03b3\n)1/\u03b3 (A4)"
