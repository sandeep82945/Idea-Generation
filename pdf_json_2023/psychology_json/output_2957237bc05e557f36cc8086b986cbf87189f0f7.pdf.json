    "abstractText": "In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) and docking simulations were carried out on the crystal structure of Neisseria Gonorrhoeae RsmE aiming at free energy of binding estimation (\u2206Gbinding) of the methyl transfer substrate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), as well as its homocysteine precursor S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). The mechanistic insight gained was generalized in view of existing homology to two other crystal structures of RsmE from Escherichia coli and Aquifex aeolicus. As a proof of concept, the crystal poses of SAM and SAH were reproduced reflecting a more general pattern of molecular interaction for bacterial RsmEs. Our results suggest that a distinct set of conserved residues on loop segments between \u03b212, \u03b16, and Met169 are interacting with SAM and SAH across these bacterial methyltransferases. Comparing molecular movements over time (MD trajectories) between Neisseria gonorrhoeae RsmE alone or in the presence of SAH revealed a hitherto unknown gatekeeper mechanism by two isoleucine residues, Ile171 and Ile219. The proposed gating allows switching from an open to a closed state, mimicking a double latch lock. Additionally, two key residues, Arg221 and Thr222, were identified to assist the exit mechanism of SAH, which could not be observed in the crystal structures. To the best of our knowledge, this study describes for the first time a general catalytic mechanism of bacterial RsmE on theoretical ground.",

            "text": "Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase E (RsmE) is a methyltransferase (MTase) and was first discovered in Escherichia coli (E. coli) [1]. It transfers methyl groups from methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to uridine U1498 in the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [2]. In contrast to protein coding messenger RNA (mRNA for gene expression), rRNA, along with transfer RNA (tRNA), are noncoding yet mRNA and tRNA are directly participating in protein biosynthesis and rRNA indirectly regulates through methylation. Molecular mechanisms of rRNA methylation are highly conserved and span all kingdoms of life [3]. In bacteria, it plays a major role in the regulation of ribosome activity and the local fine-tuning of rRNA structure, which is of epidemiological importance because it is a mechanism of antibiotic resistance [4] and epigenetic regulation of protein synthesis [5]. Nineteen members of the MTase family are responsible for the catalysis of post-transcriptional modifications of adenine, guanosine and cytosine but only one type (RsmE) modifies uridine in the 16S rRNA and three in the 23S rRNA [6]. At an atomic scale, the methylation target of RsmE in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) constitutes the nitrogen atom at position N3 on uridine U1497 of the 16S rRNA.\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2023, 24, 16722 2 of 24\nMethyl transfer produces m3U1497 as well as S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) as a byproduct. Primary sequence comparison with E. coli demonstrates that its U1497 corresponds to U1498 in E. coli and belongs to the highly conserved A-site, which is significantly important for protein biosynthesis [1], as well as for the interaction with the ribose-phosphate backbone of the codon region [7]. A schematic drawing (Figure 1) shows the relative position in the ribosomal context where RsmE catalyzes the methylation of uridine (U). The physiological role of U1498 and its methylation to m3U1498 were confirmed in experiments of rsme knockout mutants that showed lagged growth rates compared to those of the wild-type strains [1]. Studies in Mycobacterium tuberculosis have shown that the methylation of U1498 has an indirect effect on the binding of aminoglycosides and, hence, it inherently acts as an effective mechanism of drug resistance [8].\nInt.

The physiological role of U1498 and its methylation to m3U1498 were confirmed in experiments of rsme knockout mutants that showed lagged growth rates compared to those of the wild-type strains [1]. Studies in Mycobacterium tuberculosis have shown that the methylation of U1498 has an indirect effect on the binding of aminoglycosides and, hence, it inherently acts as an effective mechanism of drug resistance [8]. In a seminal work, RNA methylation was embedded in a wider biochemical context of posttranslational processing, gene expression and regulatory mechanism thereof in the field of epitranscriptome [9]. Clinical relevance has the uridine methylation in light of the recent developments of mRNA vaccines for humans [10]. Other types of methylation exist, for instance concerning oxygen atoms on nucleotides (nt) in RNA, but they require different mechanisms of action [11].\nFigure 1.

(B) The P44 and P45 contain the A-site where RsmE methylates the uridine\nat position 1498 which is in proximity to other sites that are methylated (enclosed in green boxes) by\nother methyltransferases. RsmE forms a holoenzyme with S-Adenosylmethionine as a cofactor in\norder to transfer a methyl group. The star (red asterisk) depicts the position of uridine methylation (red box) in the ribosome for protein biosynthesis.\nIn a seminal work, RNA methylation was embedded in a wider biochemical context of posttranslational processing, gene expression and regulatory mechanism thereof in the field of epitranscriptome [9]. Clinical relevance has the uridine methylation in light of the recent developments of mRNA vaccines for humans [10]. Other types of methylation exist, for instance concerning oxygen atoms on nucleotides (nt) in RNA, but they require different mechanisms of action [11].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16722 3 of 24\nSequence and structure analyses of published RsmE data indicated that RsmE belongs to the SPOUT (SpoU-TrmD) superfamily, which has been conserved not only in bacteria but also in eukaryotes. SPOUT members\u2014including RsmE\u2014form dimers that are essential for the catalytic activity. They share a characteristic SPOUT domain with highly conserved primary sequences (homology), and shared protein functions based on two common structural features: (i) a SAM-binding fold as a three-layered \u03b1/\u03b2 fold with a central \u03b2sheet of 5\u20136 strands surrounded by \u03b1-helices on each side; as well as (ii) a PUA-like domain in the N-terminal segment [2,12]. In addition to RNA rearrangements including rRNA or tRNA maturation, chain cuts and splicing or chaperone folding, RNA bases alone can be modified. In our context, transmethylation of a nt requires an initial nucleophilic attack to the methyl carbon atom which in turn must be activated by an adjacent positive charge. Here, it is a sulfonium cation (a sulfur atom with a total charge of +1) on SAM. As a methyl group donor, the methyl group attached to its sulfur atom transferred to the attacking nucleophile after its accommodation in the cavity of the active (catalytic) site of the methyl transferase enzyme. Nucleophilic moieties contain electronegative atoms like N, O and S, or negatively charged groups such as carboxylate, phosphate (esters) and enolate anions. Here, the nucleophilic center to be methylated is the nitrogen atom in position 3 of uridine at the nt sequence position 1498 (m3U1498). Of note, compared to our target enzyme for N-methylation, C-methylation requires a totally different mechanism for m3U1498. A deeper understanding of the biochemical steps during the catalytic methylation cycle of RsmE is still lacking. Hence, we propose a computational approach to analyze the exit mechanism of SAH by molecular dynamics simulations [13\u201316]. We carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of N. gonorrhoeae RsmE and, after inspection of two other species, E. coli and Aquifex aeolicus (A. aeolicus), we propose a more general mechanism for bacterial RsmE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD analysis on this matter to date. The outcome suggests, on theoretical grounds, a common bacterial mechanism that includes the following features: (i) a pair of Arg/Gly for the entry of SAM, (ii) a pair of Arg/Thr to stabilize SAM during catalysis by arginines and glutamates, and (iii) a pair of isoleucines for SAH exit."

The T. thermophilus from the PUA-like domain at the N-terminus is likely to be adaptive to the recognition of target RNA structures with higher stability [17]. The C-terminus of bacterial RsmE embraces a Rossmanoid fold with conserved motifs harboring functional residues for (i) SAM binding, (ii) methyltransferase activities, and (iii) a dimerization interface.

Following the fundamental tenet that highly conserved structures reflect similar protein functions over eons of biological evolution, our MD production runs together with our structural superposition of CTD suggesting that all RsmEs effectively do share closely related catalytic mechanisms (Figure 2). The aforementioned Rossmanoid fold in the Cterminus is encountered in a plethora of methyltransferases, as it is considered a remnant of a primogenial ancestor spread across many protein families [19]. The central sevenstranded parallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b26-\u03b212) is sandwiched between two layers of helices on either side \u03b14 and \u03b15 on one side, and \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b16 on the other, and a deep trefoil knot is formed by threading the \u03b211-\u03b24 segment C-terminus (Figures 3 and 4). Comparison between crystal structures and primary sequences of RsmE proteins revealed a higher degree of structural conservation over sequence. E. coli and A. aeolicus RsmE are homologous, with 39.33% and 29.86% identity, respectively, with respect to the N. gonorrhoeae sequence. The structural similarity was evaluated by measuring the root mean square deviation (RMSD), obtaining a score of 1.39 \u00c5 over 868 backbone atoms for E. coli, and 1.37 \u00c5 over 708 backbone atoms for A. aeolicus, compared with a total number of 943 backbone atoms of N. gonorrhoeae crystal structure as reference [20] (Figure 2, see Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials).

The SAM methionine tail can be broken down into three chemical substructures: the carboxyl, amine, and methyl sulfide groups.

Both chemical groups lie at a distance from the methyl group that is exposed to the RNA contact site. Methyl sulfide is positioned next to the H-bond acceptor region, which is highly polar compared to the major hydrophobic character of the binding site.

The observed active conformation of SAM from the RsmE crystal complex was superimposed with the docked conformations of SAM and SAH. SAM of the crystal complex and the final docked solutions (FDS) showed practically the same atom-by-atom contact patterns at the RsmE binding site (Figure 5B). The backbone oxygen atoms of Met169, Gly195, Leu215, Gly216 and Arg218, along with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Gly192, Leu215 and Leu220, form hydrogen-bonds with SAM. Intriguingly, they could be observed only in the MD playback but not in the crystal structure itself. In contrast to the Gly192 interaction, which was observed only in the crystal structure of SAM. For RsmE-like homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it has been reported that the equivalent Arg218 and its neighboring leucine and glycine residues are essential for methylation catalysis. Conserved arginine and hydrophobic amino acids were rearranged to interact with the SAM adenine ring and U1498 of p44 of E. coli [12], suggesting that the structural basis of bacterial RsmE evolved to recognize a specific rRNA sequence. Indeed, RsmE associates with the RNA-binding site in addition to a variety of rRNA sequences that carry the conserved A(N)GGAX motif [5]. At the time of finalizing this study, a crystal structure of PUA-like domain in complex with p44 and SAM/SAH together has been made available (last visit, June 2023). Docked SAH exhibited the same interaction pattern as SAM for its adenine ring with almost the same residues, except for the backbone nitrogen of Gly192. Instead, the carboxyl and amine groups on SAH contacted the side chain nitrogen atoms of Arg111 and the backbone oxygen of Glu194, respectively. This interaction dissimilarity between SAM and SAH side chains is due to the inward displacement of the sulfur atom that allows the methyl group to shift over during the ongoing methyl transfer process, as displayed in Figure 5A. The sulfur atom displacement (or shift) of the three ligands can be fully understood when considering the following facts: two ligands can be lumped together since the sulfide S-atom is methylated, becoming a cation. They are accommodated in the binding cleft in the same way, because the surrounding spatial requirements of the cavity are the same. In stark contrast, the S-unmethylated ligand is smaller and approaches more deeply into the occupation zone at the binding site. Since the sulfur atom sits in the middle of a sidechain on the scaffold, it becomes evident that the binding conformations vary from one to the other group. For better viewing, we extracted the active conformations (Figure 5). Our molecular dynamics simulations reflect this side chain displacement (or shift) at room temperature. The pivotal role of Gly192 in recognizing SAM or SAH is evolutionarily determined. Gly192 belongs to the conserved motif GPEGX, located on the loop between \u03b211 and \u03b15 of N. gonorrhoeae RsmE. Of note, the aforementioned differences in the SAM and SAH interaction patterns do not affect affinity since their binding energies were computed to have similar values."

In each case, they show almost identical positions when compared to the x-ray conformations of SAM and SAH with N. gonorrhoeae: 5VM8 and A. aeolicus: 2EGW, respectively (Figure 6D\u2013F), including those obtained with the RsmE of E. coli, the source of which constitutes an unliganded crystal structure. Prior to docking with RsmE of E. coli, its crystal structure was prepared by geometry relaxation through MD. This way, strain energy lying on the tighter apo-form of the protein structure was released to simulate assumed induced fit processes between ligands and receptors upon binding [23]. Next, the resulting docked poses for SAM as well as SAH were compared to their original crystal structures. For not being back docking results, it could be assumed that poses were not found identical but at least in acceptable keeping with the overall positions. The adenosine rings were found in close proximity to the back docked poses after superposing them. The latter comes as no surprise as the crystal structure ligand conformations highly resemble those of the adenosine and sugar rings (Figure 6G\u2013I). It is not farfetched to conclude that binding SAM or releasing SAH share highly similar mechanisms among bacterial organisms. In particular, the aperture next to the adenine ring stays widely open in N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus compared to E. coli (Figure 6A\u2013C), which exhibited a narrowly closed hole. These observations are consistent with those seen in N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus crystal structures. The final poses of SAH by back docking in addition to its docked crystal pose were found to be very similar to that of SAM in its crystal complex. Precisely, the sulfur atom can be taken as a reference point. It occupies the same spot with a tiny distance variation regarding the atoms of neighboring backbone residues (Figure 6I). Finally, the A. aeolicus RsmE-binding site had more regions with H-bond donor residues among the three species. This high number does not seem to have a major drawback in the conformation that these ligands adopt when superimposed with the N. gonorrhoeae crystal structure (Figure 6). More details concerning docked poses and resulting binding energies and interaction patterns observed by inspecting the crystal structure and molecular docking are documented in Figures S3 and S4 in addition to Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Materials. Across the three RsmE species, a pair of one polar and non-polar residues are either conserved or replaced during evolutionary times by others with equivalent chemical groups. In particular, the following three pairs were found which assist SAM and SAH in entering (entrance) and leaving (exit): (i) Leu215/Arg218 for N. gonorrhoeae, (ii) Leu208/Tyr211 for A. aeolicus and (iii) Leu217/Arg220 for E. coli. In all cases, the polar amino acid comes in close proximity to the amine group of the adenine ring and guides it around a hydrophobic crevice made of leucine side chains. Moreover, Leu220 also plays a fundamental role in the stabilization of the adenine ring in N. gonorrhoeae (Figure 6D\u2013F). The equivalent residues in A. aeolicus (Leu213) and E. coli (Leu222) appear to share the same function. Likewise, the interaction of sugar hydroxyl oxygen (O2\u2019) with Met169 in N. gonorrhoeae is analogous in A. aeolicus with Leu161 and Leu 171 in E. coli. Glu194 and Glu187 from N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus, respectively, may contribute to stabilizing SAH exit by guiding the homocysteine tail (Figure 6G,H)."

Molecular dynamics analysis was carried out with the RsmE monomers of N. gonorrhoeae alone (5VM8m) and in the presence of SAH (5VM8m + SAH). The backbone of 5VM8m and 5VM8m + SAH conventionally remain stable near 2 \u00c5, RSMD5VM8m = 2.73 \u00c5 and RSMD5VM8m+SAH = 2.89 \u00c5, with similar fluctuations over time. This is consistent with other MD studies with methyltransferases in complex with nanaomycin and hydralazine as inhibitors [26,27] and reports of folded RsmE that showed a RMSD of 2.5 \u00c5 (Figure 7A) [28].\nInt.

In agreement with backbone folding, the Rg graphs and mean values indicate that the general form of the RsmE monomer is constant (Figure 7B) [29]. The SAH trajectory within RsmE and the dynamics related to its exit mechanism after RNA methylation are displayed in Figure 8. The distance between the SAH adenine ring and the amine group with Leu215, Arg218 and Leu220 residues remained practically constant at 3 \u00c5 for the entire simulation (Figure 9), maintaining this part of the molecule very close to the crystal pose, further reinforcing the importance of the role of the polar amino acid. The interaction distance with the Met169 residue does not show the same stability as the residues, since it is kept 3 \u00c5 away from one of the hydroxyl groups (O2 ) of the SAH sugar ring (Figure 9A). Nevertheless, the interaction distance between the same hydroxyl group (O2 ) and the Gly192 residue increases as the simulation time progresses, indicating that the sugar ring undergoes a major position change as a function of time compared to the adenine ring.\ni re 7.

The RsmE monomers of N. gonorrhoeae alone and in the presence of SAH were simulated by MD on the center of a dodecahedron box filled with SPCE water for 100 ns (50,000,000 steps, dt = 0.002 ps) under the Verlet scheme and Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat at 300 K in an NPT assembly, applying the most recent release of CHARMM36 all-atom force field with Gromacs 2020.4 [24,25,42\u201350]. Time-step\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16722 19 of 24\natom trajectories and SAH-RsmE interaction distances were analyzed using the VMD package version 1.9.3 [51].

            "text": "Running molecular dynamics or docking programs becomes a daunting task even during routine work with default values of standard settings because the bottleneck has always been the small number of predefined atoms along with their bonds, partial charges and other physicochemical propensities. Straightforward adding new parameters to the built-in biological building blocks\u2014like amino acids for proteins and nucleotides for RNA or DNA\u2014is hampered by the need for calibration and validation within the framework of that force field. Newcomers or inexperienced novices tend to suppress or omit aspects concerning model limitations and the consequences thereof for the study design, fearing their publication could be rejected. This way most valuable information for improving forthcoming program releases or the mere chance for other researchers to overcome the detected downsides will be lost. During our MD study, we used the force field package FF CHARMM36. We report that the methylated sulfur atom\u2014having a total net charge of \"+1\"\u2014is not recognized by the MD tool CGenFF. The flaw is a more general downside of the underlying ChARMM force field in that any ligand with positive net charges (+1, +2, etc.) cannot be treated in a straightforward way due to missing parametrization. Our case fits into this context because ligand SAM has a sulfur atom which is positively charged due to its additional methyl group. To our best knowledge, in none of the standard versions of MD force field packages (CHARMM, GROMOS, NAMD) is there a validated parametrization for a positively charged S atom. As a direct consequence without possibilities for validated parameter input, no SAM topology file can be created. Over time, solutions have been discussed on Web-based fora (forums). So far, no CHARMM36-validated or all-purpose workarounds have been presented to the MD community. Hence, the conundrum of missing parameters still continues. The degree of ionization depends on the surrounding solvent and the electronic influence of the substituents on the solute. In the general case of carboxyl group dissociation into carboxylate anions on the side chains, the influence of the scaffold substituents is greatly reduced if the solvent assists the proton in leaving the carboxyl group. In our case, water constitutes this proton donating and accepting polar solvent. It shows strong ionizing power for the amine and carboxyl group on ligand SAM or SAH. In addition, water does not only ease the dissociation, but also stabilizes both the cationic form of the amine group along with its leaving anionic hydroxyl moiety. In the case of the ligand\u00b4s organic acid group water stabilizes its corresponding anionic form along with its leaving group, a cationic proton (by solvation/hydration). In a lipophilic pocket\u2014which is the case here\u2014it is extremely unlikely to encounter both groups in their dissociated forms (Figure 15). Without ionization, the far more non-polar neutral forms of amine and carboxyl groups on our two ligands will prevail. As an approximation, we ran MD and docking simulations with the neutral form of the methionyl head group. Physicochemical in vitro studies revealed that it is about 1015 times as difficult to dissociate a carboxyl group in a nonpolar organic solvent as in water (Figure 15).\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "The study succeeded in combining docking and molecular dynamics simulations to gain complementary insight into the theoretical mechanism of SAH as a leaving group at the atomic scale. Taken together all findings, the active conformations of SAM and SAH in the crystal structures and molecular docking showed very similar geometries (torsions) in practically the same poses. Comparison revealed conserved interaction patterns for N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus, with little differences from E. coli. Likewise, the binding energies for SAM and SAH in N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus were highly similar, hinting at a general catalytic mechanism for bacteria. In addition to the crystal structures and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16722 21 of 24\ndocking results, molecular dynamics simulations of N. gonorrhoeae helped identify pivotal interacting residues, namely Leu215, Arg218 and Leu220. They sit on the connecting loop segment between \u03b212 and \u03b16, along with Met169. They are either conserved or undergo homologous exchange and specifically orchestrate not only SAM binding but also SAH release upon transmethylation. Homologous residue exchange was based on the identification of equivalent positions in A. aeloicus and E. coli. It is safe to say that they represent a more general molecular mechanism and thereby the conserved enzyme catalytic function. The energy minimization of E. coli RsmE by MD allowed us to obtain poses very similar to those of the crystal structures of the other two species. The binding energies in E. coli were close to those estimated for N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus. However, it was not possible to reproduce the interaction of the hydroxyl O2\u2019 of SAM and SAH with Gly192 and Gly185 in N. gonorrhoeae and A. aeolicus RsmE, respectively. Initial docking results with the crystal structure from E. coli RsmE showed large differences derived from the different shapes and large sizes of the binding sites compared to the others. It was found to be an open or exposed cavity that adjusts to the size of the ligand once it binds. The binding site was found to be in a widely open state. In the presence of SAM, the binding site switches to a narrowly closed state. On the other hand, the MD simulation in the presence of SAH allowed us to distinguish the alternating interaction of the SAH carboxyl group with Arg221 and Thr222, two residues that contribute decisively to ligand release. MD suggests that the weakening of the interaction between the SAH hydroxyl groups and Gly192 is critical for promoting the opening of the gate formed by residues Ile171 and Ile219 in N. gonorrhoeae. Further experimentation with selective mutagenesis will be the key to demonstrating this role. The binding site opens when the distance between the two isoleucine residues is greater than 6 \u00c5. It is expected to be exposed to the neighboring water molecules, which were not investigated as to whether they comply with a structural role or interaction since the RMSD and Rg parameters indicate that the binding site undergoes significant shape variations. However, there is still a lack of information to model a ternary complex between the p44 helix, SAM and RsmE, and to gather a complete catalytic mechanism that may be employed to design a new generation of antibiotics to improve the clinical treatment of a wide spectrum of drug-resistant bacteria.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms242316722/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, J.L.-A.; investigation, J.L.-A. and A.H.-C.; computational analysis and simulations, J.L.-A.; computational analysis and interpretation, T.S.; visualization, J.L.A., T.S. and A.H.-C.; validation, J.L.-A., A.H.-C. and T.S.; conceptualization, A.H.-C.; formal analysis, A.H.-C.; writing\u2014original draft and editing, J.L.-A., A.H.-C. and T.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.H.-C. and T.S.; writing\u2014review draft and editing, T.S.
