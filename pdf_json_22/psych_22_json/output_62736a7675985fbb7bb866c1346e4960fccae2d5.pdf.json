    "abstractText": "Each year in the U.S., tens of thousands of people die from influenza and hundreds of thousands are hospitalized, costing millions of dollars in medical expenses and taking a toll on the mental health of loved ones (CDC, 2020a; Molinari et al., 2007). These numbers are staggering as death and severe illness from influenza are largely preventable through vaccination (WHO, 2020). Despite the availability of annual influenza vaccines in the U.S., adult vaccination coverage rates are relatively low, ranging from 37.1% to 48.4% in the past ten years from 2010 to 2020 (CDC, 2020b). These numbers are well below the target rate of 70%, which is estimated to be necessary to significantly minimize transmission of the virus and reduce the health burden (CDC, 2020b). Increasing influenza vaccine uptake is a necessary goal for social scientists seeking to improve population health. Developing tailored and targeted interventions to improve influenza vaccine uptake requires understanding variability in vaccine hesitancy (i.e., uncertainty or unwillingness to receive a vaccine when it is available; Butler & MacDonald, 2015; MacDonald, 2015). Although some research has identified various psychosocial correlates of influenza vaccine hesitancy (see Schmid et al., 2017; Yeung et al., 2016, for reviews), very little work has examined psychological processes that are proposed to serve an infectious disease avoidance function (e.g., disgust sensitivity, referred to as disgust proneness throughout this paper; Olatunji et al., 2017). Such processes could potentially be leveraged in vaccine hesitancy interventions. The goal of the current research was to examine the extent to which disgust proneness was associated with influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Beyond contextual factors (e.g., access or having a regular healthcare provider; Jasek, 2011; Matsui et al., 2011), Abstract Although various demographic and psychosocial factors have been identified as correlates of influenza vaccine hesitancy, factors that promote infectious disease avoidance, such as disgust proneness, have been rarely examined. In two large national U.S. samples (Ns = 475 and 1007), we investigated whether disgust proneness was associated with retrospective accounts of influenza vaccine uptake, influenza vaccine hesitancy, and eventual influenza vaccine uptake, while accounting for demographics and personality. Across both studies, greater age, higher education, working in healthcare, and greater disgust proneness were significantly related to greater likelihood of previously receiving an influenza vaccine. In Study 2, which was a yearlong longitudinal project, disgust proneness prospectively predicted influenza vaccine hesitancy and eventual vaccine uptake during the 2020\u20132021 influenza season. Findings from this project expand our understanding of individuallevel factors associated with influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake, highlighting a psychological factor to be targeted in vaccine hesitancy interventions.",

Those who are younger (Z\u00fcrcher et\u00a0al., 2019), male (Mamelund & Bergsaker, 2011), single (Li et\u00a0al., 2012), or non-White (Quinn et\u00a0al., 2017), and those who have less education (Blank et\u00a0al., 2009), have lower income (Lucyk et\u00a0al., 2019), or live in socioeconomically deprived areas (Norbury et\u00a0al., 2011; Sammon et\u00a0al., 2012) are more likely to be vaccine hesitant. Greater dislike of needles (Ryan et\u00a0al., 2019), lower perceived moral obligation to receive a vaccine (Lehmann et\u00a0al., 2015), and less agreeable personality (Demir et\u00a0al., 2020) have each been associated with greater influenza vaccine hesitancy. These findings are valuable in identifying populations to be targeted and psychological barriers that may need to be overcome in appeals to reduce vaccine hesitancy. However, it is also important to identify psychological factors that encourage vaccine uptake, which can be utilized to shape possible messaging campaigns and interventions to lower vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccination uptake (Schmid et\u00a0al., 2017).\nAccording to Behavioral Immune System theory (Schaller, 2006), the emotion of disgust is a psychological process proposed to serve an infectious disease avoidance function. The experience of disgust signals a potential pathogen threat and motivates avoidance behavior. Although a universal emotion, individuals vary in their tendency to become disgusted and the intensity with which they feel disgust (i.e., disgust proneness; Haidt et\u00a0al., 1994; Tybur et\u00a0al., 2009). Those higher in disgust proneness are more reactive to potential sources of pathogens and engage in more prophylactic behaviors. For example, greater disgust proneness was associated with greater fears and anxiety about Swine flu (Brand et\u00a0al., 2013; Wheaton et\u00a0al., 2012), as well as anxiety and concerns about COVID-19 (e.g., McKay et\u00a0al., 2020; Shook et\u00a0al., 2020). Those higher in disgust proneness were also more likely to engage in preventive health behaviors (e.g., handwashing, social distancing) during the 2014 Ebola outbreak (Blakey et\u00a0al., 2015) and the COVID19 pandemic (e.g., Cox et\u00a0al., 2020; Shook et\u00a0al., 2020). Theoretically, those higher in disgust proneness should be less vaccine hesitant and more likely to accept vaccines as a means of protecting themselves against infectious diseases. However, this basic proposition has received little empirical attention.\nA recent study found that greater disgust proneness was associated with less COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a large national sample of U.S. adults (Shook et\u00a0al., 2021). Further, a study utilizing a national sample of U.S. adults found that those higher in disgust proneness were more likely to have received an influenza vaccine during the previous influenza season (Luz et\u00a0al., 2019). This retrospective report supports the theoretical proposition that disgust proneness serves a\ndisease avoidance function through vaccine uptake. However, additional research is necessary to replicate this finding, and prospective research is needed to demonstrate that disgust proneness predicts future influenza vaccine uptake.\nThe purpose of the current research was to examine the extent to which disgust proneness was associated with influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Across two studies of national samples of U.S. adults, we sought to replicate the previous finding that disgust proneness was associated with retrospective accounts of influenza vaccine uptake. Additionally, Study 2 utilized a pre-registered, longitudinal design to test whether disgust proneness uniquely predicted influenza vaccine hesitancy and eventual vaccine uptake (see preregistration at https:// osf. io/ 2qz4f). Overall, we expected greater disgust proneness to be associated with a greater likelihood of previously receiving an influenza vaccine, lower influenza vaccine hesitancy, and greater likelihood of influenza vaccine uptake.\nStudy 1\nThe goal of the first study was to replicate the previous finding that disgust proneness was associated with retrospective accounts of influenza vaccine uptake (Luz et\u00a0al., 2019). As demographic and personality factors have been associated with influenza vaccine hesitancy, we controlled for these variables to assess the amount of variance uniquely accounted for by disgust proneness."

            "text": "Disgust proneness was measured using a composite score from three well-validated subscales that assess pathogen disgust proneness. Specifically, the Disgust scale\u2013Revised (DS-R; Olatunji et\u00a0al., 2007) is a 27-item scale. For 14 items, participants indicate how true each statement is about them or how much they agree with each statement on a scale of 1 (Strongly disagree/very untrue about me) to 5 (Strongly agree/very true about me). For 13 items, participants indicate how disgusting they would find a variety of experiences on a scale of 1 (Not disgusting at all) to 5 (Extremely disgusting). The measure has three subscales. The core disgust subscale includes 12 items (e.g., \u201cit bothers me to hear someone clear a throat full of mucous;\u201d \u03b1 = 0.72) and assesses disgust evoked by potential pathogen sources. The animal reminder subscale contains eight items (e.g., \u201cit would bother me to be in a science class, and to see a human hand preserved in a jar;\u201d \u03b1 = 0.77) and assesses disgust evoked by reminders that humans are animals. The contamination disgust subscale contains five items (e.g., \u201cI never let any part of my body touch the toilet seat in public restrooms;\u201d \u03b1 = 0.74) and assesses disgust evoked by potential transmission of pathogens. For the purpose of this study, only the core and contamination disgust proneness subscales were used, as these subscales are directly related to the disease avoidance function of disgust. The animal-reminder subscale does not pertain to disease avoidance concerns (Olatunji et\u00a0al., 2014). Responses were averaged for each subscale, with higher scores indicating higher disgust proneness.\nThe Three Domain Disgust Scale was also used to assess pathogen disgust proneness (TDDS; Tybur et\u00a0al., 2009). The TDDS is a 21-item questionnaire, including subscales measuring pathogen, moral, and sexual disgust proneness. The pathogen subscale directly pertains to disease avoidance and was thus used in this study. The pathogen subscale consists of seven statements (e.g., \u201csitting next to someone who has red sores on their arm\u201d), and participants indicate how\ndisgusting they find each situation on a scale of 0 (Not at all disgusting) to 6 (Extremely disgusting). Responses were averaged, with higher scores indicating higher pathogen disgust proneness (\u03b1 = 0.87).\nThe three measures of disgust proneness were strongly correlated with one another (rs: 0.62 to 0.69, ps < 0.001). As such, and for parsimony, we created a composite disgust proneness variable by standardizing and averaging the three scores (see Terrizzi et\u00a0al., 2012; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al., 2021). The general pattern of results did not differ if the individual disgust proneness scores were used in the analyses (see Supplemental Material)."

Consistent with Behavioral Immune System theory, the results indicated that people who experience greater disgust proneness were more likely to report regularly receiving an annual influenza vaccine compared to those who experience less disgust proneness. These findings provide promising evidence that disgust may play a meaningful role in influenza vaccine uptake. However, there are some limitations to this study. First, participants were recruited through MTurk, and concerns have recently been raised regarding the quality of data collected through MTurk (Chmielewski & Kucker, 2020; Hauser et\u00a0al., 2019). As we did not include data quality checks, the data may contain more noise and the findings may be less reliable. Second, this study was cross-sectional and examined retrospective reports of vaccine uptake. It is unclear if disgust proneness precedes vaccine uptake and establishing this temporal sequence provides a logical next step in understanding the role of disgust in influenza vaccine hesitancy.\nStudy 2\nThe goal of the second study was to replicate results from Study 1 in an independent sample recruited through different means (i.e., not through MTurk) and extend Study 1 findings by testing whether disgust proneness prospectively predicted influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Study 2 utilized data from a year-long longitudinal study, in which participants were surveyed on a weekly to monthly basis from March 2020 to March 2021.

From September 2020 to March 2021, participants reported on a monthly basis whether they had received an influenza vaccine for the current influenza season. We had four preregistered hypotheses (see https:// osf. io/ 2qz4f):\n1. Greater disgust proneness would be associated with greater likelihood of receiving an influenza vaccine in the previous influenza season. 2. Greater disgust proneness would be associated with lower likelihood of influenza vaccine hesitancy. 3. Greater disgust proneness would prospectively predict influenza vaccine uptake, directly or indirectly through lower likelihood of influenza vaccine hesitancy. 4. Greater disgust proneness would prospectively predict receiving an influenza vaccine earlier in the influenza season."

            "text": "The goal of the present research was to determine whether disgust proneness was associated with influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Overall, we found that greater disgust proneness was associated with greater likelihood of previous influenza vaccine uptake (Studies 1 and 2), lower influenza vaccine heistancy (Study 2), and greater likelihood of future influenza vaccine uptake (Study 2). Importantly, we found that disgust proneness prospectively predicted influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake, independent of demographic factors. Our findings are in line with Behavioral Immune System theory and suggest that disgust proneness may play an important role in infectious disease avoidance.\nOur findings add to a very limited body of research examining the link between psychological disease avoidance processes and vaccine hesitancy or uptake. Across both studies, we replicated a previous finding that greater disgust proneness was associated with retrospective accounts of influenza vaccine uptake (Luz et\u00a0al., 2019). We extended this by\ndemonstrating that greater disgust proneness prospectively predicted influenza vaccine hesitancy and future influenza vaccine uptake in a relatively large national sample. This is the first study to the authors\u2019 knowledge to show that disgust proneness precedes influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake. The temporal order and control of demographic factors is crucial in isolating the unique predictive value of disgust proneness and understanding the extent to which disgust proneness contributes to influenza vaccine uptake.\nInterestingly, disgust proneness was associated with future influenza vaccine uptake both directly and indirectly through vaccine hesitancy. That is, greater disgust proneness assessed in May 2020 directly predicted greater likelihood of influenza vaccine uptake during the 2020\u20132021 influenza season. And, greater disgust proneness was prospectively associated with lower influenza vaccine hesitancy, which in turn was prospectively associated with greater likelihood\nSignificant effects are given in bold Gender coded: 0 = male, 1 = female; Race coded: 0 = White, 1 = nonWhite; Health Care Worker coded: 0 = no, 1 = yes\n1 3\nof future influenza vaccine uptake. Thus, disgust proneness may shape vaccine hesitancy, which influences behavior, and disgust proneness may also influence health decisions in the moment. Current feelings of disgust or perceived disease threat may motivate more immediate behavior to mitigate infectious disease concerns. Additionally, the potential link between disgust proneness and vaccine hesitancy or vaccine uptake may be useful in developing interventions to encourage vaccine uptake. The emotion of disgust, a key component of disgust proneness, is universal and malleable (Batres & Perrett, 2020; Curtis et\u00a0al., 2011). Thus, if disgust proneness predicts vaccine hesitancy and uptake, this may suggest a potential intervention target to decrease hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake.\nWe did not find evidence to suggest that disgust proneness significantly predicts when an individual will receive an influenza vaccine among those who received the vaccine. Potentially, disgust proneness may not influence timing of vaccine uptake. External factors, such as access and schedule, may have a large effect on when someone receives a vaccine. It is possible that opportunities to receive the influenza vaccine were more limited during the data collection period due to COVID-19 restrictions and fear. Specifically, COVID19 infection rates peaked in the United States between September 2020 and March 2021 (CDC, 2021a), which was accompanied by an increased disease related threat, as well as an overburdening of the US healthcare system. These factors may have influenced when some people were able to receive their influenza vaccine or when they felt comfortable getting their shots. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected participants\u2019 general perception and acceptance of influenza vaccines (Mercadante & Law, 2021). Also, due to the high amount of social distancing during this period, influenza infection rates were substantially lower than previous years (CDC, 2021b), which may have affected timing of shots.\nAcross both studies, we also replicated previous findings linking different demographic factors to influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake (see Schmid et\u00a0al., 2017; Yeung et\u00a0al., 2016, for reviews). Specifically, older age was associated with greater likelihood of previously receiving an influenza vaccine, lower influenza vaccine hesitancy, and greater likelihood of future influenza vaccine uptake. Older age was also associated with receiving an influenza vaccine earlier in the influenza season. These findings are not necessarily surprising given the greater risk of severe illness or death from influenza for older adults (CDC, 2021c). Individuals with higher education or income were more likely to report previously receiving an influenza vaccine, and those with higher income were less likely to be influenza vaccine hesitant. Those with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to have access to and utilize healthcare services, which may explain these results. Together, our data highlight the need\nto tailor influenza vaccine hesitancy messaging and interventions to target younger adults, those with less education, and those with lower income.\nFindings should be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. Although the longitudinal study design allowed us to test whether disgust proneness preceded influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake, the study is still correlational and causal inferences cannot be made. Experimental methods are needed to demonstrate causality. The national sample used in this study was primarily White, so future research is needed to more closely examine correlates of influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake in more racially and ethnically diverse populations. Like many longitudinal studies, some participants from Study 2 discontinued their participation over time. Although best practices in missing data estimation were used, as data were not missing completely at random, it is possible that results from Study 2 were affected by attrition bias. Further, our outcome variables were measured with single-item, self-report questions. Although these items demonstrate face validity, future research should capture vaccine hesitancy and uptake with a wider-range of potential measures. Finally, Study 2 data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infectious disease threat may have been more salient, which may have affected influenza vaccine hesitancy and uptake. Indeed, the proportion of our sample who reported receiving an influenza vaccine was higher than national averages in the past decade. Thus, these findings need to be replicated during non-pandemic times.\nIncreasing influenza vaccine uptake is a pressing public health priority. Results from this research suggest that disgust proneness may be an important and robust predictor of vaccine uptake. These findings provide promising evidence that disgust proneness and other psychosocial disease avoidance mechanisms may be leveraged in vaccine hesitancy interventions. Future research is needed to continue to examine the efficacy and feasibility of increasing disgust proneness as a means of reducing influenza vaccine hesitancy and promoting influenza vaccine uptake.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions Conceptualization: NJS; Methodology: NJS; Data Collection: NJS, EMF; Formal analysis: NJS, BO, HNF; Writing\u2014original draft: NJS, BS, BO, HNF; Writing\u2014review and editing: NJS, BS, BO, HNF; Funding acquisition: NJS; Project administration: NJS.\nFunding This work was supported by a RAPID grant from the National Science Foundation under Award ID BCS-2027027.
