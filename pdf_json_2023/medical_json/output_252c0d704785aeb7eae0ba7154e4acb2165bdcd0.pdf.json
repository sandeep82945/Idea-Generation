The pathogenesis for this increased mortality is poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mediastinitis and persistently elevated cardiac-specific biomarkers [troponin T (TnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] and C-reactive protein (CRP) at mid-term follow-up following CABG.\nMaterial and methods: The epidemiologic design was of an exposed (mediastinitis, n = 41) vs. randomly selected non-exposed (non-mediastinitis) controls (n= 41) cohort. Serum samples for measurements of NT-proBNP, TnT, and CRP were obtained at a median follow up time of 2.7 (range 0.5\u20135.2) years after CABG surgery.\nResults: NT-proBNP (mean 65.0 pg/ml vs. 34.8 pg/ml, p = 0.007) and TnT levels (mean 14.7 ng/L vs. 11.2 ng/L, p = 0.004) were significantly higher in the mediastinitis group than in the control group. Patients with mediastinitis had also higher body mass index (BMI) and were more likely to have diabetes and previous myocardial infarction. There was no di erence in serum CRP level between the groups. After controlling for potential confounders (previous myocardial infarction, age, and BMI), the presence of mediastinitis was associated with higher levels of log NT-proBNP (p = 0.02) and log TnT (p = 0.04).\nConclusion: Mediastinitis increases the concentrations of cardiac-specific biomarkers NT-proBNP and TnT at mid-term follow-up, representing persistent myocardial injury and impaired cardiac function."

            "text": "The incidence of mediastinitis after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is low; around 1%. However, this feared complication is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and decreased long-term survival (1\u20134). In addition, the risk of cardiac death is significantly higher in patients with mediastinitis compared to patients without mediastinitis (1). The mechanism for development of mediastinitis and its complications is multifactorial, and not fully understood\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 01 frontiersin.org\n(1\u20135). Mediastinitis increases the risk of early internal mammary artery (IMA) graft obstruction (6), which may be due to inflammation or mechanical damage to the IMA. IMA graft failure is probably one of several factors that explains cardiac death after mediastinitis. Nterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is synthesized and released from the myocardium in response to increased wall stress and injury (7, 8). The serum levels of NT-proBNP are increased in patients with heart failure (HF), and have been shown to provide important prognostic information in these patients (9, 10). Similarly, higher concentrations of troponin T (TnT), a specific marker of cardiomyocyte damage, have been shown to be prognostically important, not only in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable coronary artery disease (CAD), but also in patients with stable CAD and in patients with HF (11, 12).\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is a stable and reliable marker of inflammation, and has been shown to give prognostic information in a wide number of atherosclerotic disorders, as well as HF, reflecting the involvement of inflammatory pathways in these disorders (13, 14). Numerous studies have shown that NT-proBNP, TnT and CRP provide important prognostic information in various cardiovascular disorders. However, whether these markers are regulated by mediastinitis following CABG, is not fully elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the levels of NTproBNP, TnT and CRP following CABG in patients with and without complicating mediastinitis."

By epidemiological design, the study included 41 exposed (mediastinitis) and 41 non-exposed (non-mediastinitis), controls. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for; (1) NT-proBNP, (2) TnT and (3) CRP. Blood samples were obtained at routine examination at a median follow up time of 2.7 (range, 0.5\u20135.2) years after primary CABG surgery. All CABG patients who had developed post-operative mediastinitis during 4.7 years follow-up, from September 2005 to April 2010, were considered as exposed patients. The non-exposed cohort was a random control sample of 41 patients without mediastinitis (Figure 1), collected from the same source population and the same period of time (17). Evaluation of the laboratory markers was performed during a period of nine months, from April to December 2010. Median observation time from primary CABG to laboratory control and coronary CT angiography was 2.6 (range 0.5\u20135.2) years in the mediastinitis and 2.8 (range 0.7\u2013 4.6) years in the control group (p = 0.87) (Figure 1). Evaluation\nof the endpoints was performed via coronary CT angiography. The evaluation of the images was performed by two independent radiologists blinded to the status of the patients and exposition to mediastinitis. Surgical technique for the CABG operation, surgical revision of mediastinitis and anesthesia were performed as previous described (1, 6). All cases of cardiac surgery were performed with cardiopulmonary bypass machine and no Off-Pump method was used."

Differences in the level of NTproBNP, CRP, and TnT between mediastinitis patients and controls were assessed using a non-parametric statistic (Mann Whitney U test) as the distribution of those markers were not Gaussian and very skewed (18). Association between the presence of mediastinits and the three markers was done via the multivariate linear regression models to control for the variables with confounding effect in the relationship between presence of mediastinitis and outcome. All markers were logged when considered as outcomes in the multivariate model (19). P < 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In the present study we showed that patients with VACtreated mediastinitis after CABG, had significantly higher serum levels of NT-proBNP and TnT, but not of CRP, compared with patients without mediastinitis even 2.7 years (median) following CABG. Cardiac biomarkers like NT-proBNP and TnT are useful for prediction of cardiac events and mortality (7\u201314), and raised levels\nin the mediastinitis group may at least partly explain the observed decreased long-term survival in this group of patients.\nMediastinitis is a severe complication after CABG, and is associated with increased risk of early and late cardiovascular death (1). In a prospective study of 5,185 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 41 patients had mediastinal infection. Among these, 16 patients had isolated CABG and 8 combined with valve intervention (20). Mediastinal infection after cardiac operation was associated with longer hospital stay, readmissions, and death. However, the frequency of graft obstruction and its association with prognosis was not studied. Based on our previous observations in this cohort (6), we hypothesized that inflammation pathway may be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic obstruction of the IMA graft, and this might explain why postoperative mediastinitis is a major contributor of reduced long-term survival after CABG.\nLevels of NT-proBNP rise with increasing degree of cardiac wall stress secondary to ventricular enlargement and maladaptive cardiac remodeling seen in patients with HF and after MI (21). Importantly, however, NT-proBNP is secreted in response to raised intra-cardiac pressure and wall stress irrespective of the underlying cause (7\u201310). TnT is a sensitive marker of cardiomyocyte damage following necrosis or apoptosis, and raised levels have been shown to\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 03 frontiersin.org\nprovide important prognostic information in various cardiovascular disorders including MI, stable CAD and HF (11, 12). In the present study, we show that patients with mediastinitis following CABG have elevated levels of NT-proBNP and TnT more than 2 years following CABG. These findings suggest that patients with mediastinitis may have persistent myocardial damage and impaired cardiac function, potentially contributing to the poorer long-term prognosis in these patients that also include increased occurrence of cardiac death (1).\nAlthough the exact reasons for the increased levels of NTproBNP and TnT in patients with mediastinitis remain unknown, a possible explanation may be the significantly higher prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in the mediastinitis group. It is well-established that metabolic syndrome leads to structural and functional left ventricular remodeling, preclinical or clinical systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis (22). However, elevated levels of TnT and NT-proBNP were also found after adjusting for BMI, suggesting that our findings may not merely reflect an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic risk in patients with mediastinitis. It is also important to note that NT-proBNP has been seen to be affected by other factors such as anemia (23) and renal failure (24) that was not adjusted for in the present study. Furthermore, the prevalence of prior MI was as twice as common in patients with mediastinitis compared with controls. Hence, silent/residual coronary ischemia, particularly due to microvascular disease, in patients with mediastinitis may also be a possible reason for increased TnT. However, all patients were clinically stable and asymptomatic, and underlying silent coronary ischemia was not assessed by stress echocardiography or other imaging modalities. Nonetheless, this highlights the importance of optimal cardioprotective medications including\nstatin and anti-angina and antihypertensive medications following CABG surgery.\nPersistent mediastinitis per se as an inflammatory condition could potentially be a contributing factor, but the lack of difference in CRP levels between the two groups, makes this possibility unlikely. However, low-grade myocardial inflammation that is not reflected by systemic CRP levels cannot be excluded. Moreover, mediastinitis may lead to an accelerated coronary ischemia and artery spasm, potentially contributing to ischemic cardiomyopathy. Also, the presence of mediastinitis in the early period following CABG, increases the risk of IMA-graft obstruction, but not saphenous vein grafts (SVG) (6). The mechanism of mediastinitis-induced IMA failure, which in turn could induce myocardial dysfunction, may be mechanical damage due to repetitive sternal revision or inflammatory reaction to the IMA with subsequent occlusion. Whatever the mechanisms, our findings suggest that mediastinitis following CABG may induce myocardial dysfunction that could be evident even more than 2 years following CABG surgery.\nThe present study has some limitations. First, our study groups are relatively small with some additional methodological limitations such as the retrospective design and lack of longterm outcome data; however we believe our results are of topical interest, hypothesis generating and should trigger lager prospective studies with longer follow-up to investigate the association of post-CABG mediastinitis with cardiac biomarkers as well as with serum biomarkers of inflammation. Second, serum biomarkers were retrospectively collected and the study lacks some relevant data. Therefore, our conclusions should be interpreted cautiously. Third, the lack of data on mortality and morbidity, including cardiac related hospitalizations and the incidence of recurrent\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 04 frontiersin.org\nangina. Fourth, only baseline left ventricular EF by echocardiography was included. Data on global longitudinal strain derived by speckle-tracking echocardiography or diastolic dysfunction were not available. Similarly, echocardiographic data during followup was not collected. Fifth, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a gold standard for assessment of persistent myocardial inflammation, subendocardial injury and scar and fibrosis. Our findings suggest that mediastinitis following CABG surgery could induce a degree of myocardial dysfunction potentially contributing to the increase in short- and long-term mortality in these patients. However, CMR was not included in the present study. Larger prospective studies in the future that also include echocardiography and CMR should examine whether elevated TnT and NT-proBNP concentration could be used as prognostic markers for long term survival after CABG."
