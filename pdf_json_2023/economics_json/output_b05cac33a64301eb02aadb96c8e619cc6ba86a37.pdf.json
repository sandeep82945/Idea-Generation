However, if we add a second possibility \u2013 of having a large prize with a small probability \u2013 the lottery becomes highly addictive to many participants. In this paper, we provide a possible theoretical explanation for this empirical phenomenon. 1 Formulation of the Problem Addiction: bad and not so bad. The word \u201caddiction\u201d has a negative connotation: people get addicted to gambling, to drugs, to alcohol, to smoking: they try it first, and then they feel the urge to continue the corresponding habit. However, from the psychological viewpoint, the same habit-forming can have (and often has) positive effects as well: people get addicted to healthy lifestyle, like eating healthy food and exercising regularly, people get addicted to their creative activities ranging from art and music to scientific research, people fall in love with each other \u2013 which is usually a good type of addiction. For bad addiction, we need to understand where it comes from so we can prevent it and \u2013 if it already happened \u2013 cure it. For good addition, we also need to understand where it comes from, so that we can have more people living healthy lives, we can have more people exploring their creativity, etc. In both cases, it is important to understand where addiction comes from, i.e., how we form the resulting habits.

In the future, this may help us prevent the formation of bad habits and promote formation of good ones, but as of now, the results of such an analysis are somewhat far away from practical applications. In general, we are not yet able to use this knowledge to prevent or promote habit forming.\nMore practical results have reasonably recently come from a different study: an analysis of which situations cause addictions and which do not \u2013 without the physiological analysis of how exactly addiction is formed in the brain. Such studies have indeed been performed, they are describe in Nir Eyal\u2019s book; see [1] and references therein. Eyal\u2019s results can be best explained on the example of gambling addiction \u2013 since in gambling (as opposed to other bad addictions), rewards and risks can be clearly stated in objective numerical form.\nEyal started with a seemingly natural simple gambling model, in which a person gets:\n\u2022 a reward r with some probability p, and \u2022 no reward at all with the remaining probability 1\u2212 p.\nThis can be a simplified model of playing a lottery, this can be a simplified version of playing the slot machine at a casino, etc. Somewhat surprisingly, this seemingly natural arrangement did not lead to any serious habit forming \u2013 participants played a little bit, but did not form a habit of playing.\nThe situation changed drastically when he introduced a somewhat more realistic description of a gambling situation, in which there are two levels of rewards:\n\u2022 a very large reward R that happens with a very low probability p\u2113, and \u2022 a medium-size (actually, small) reward r that happens with a medium-size prob-\nability pm.\nFor example, in a lottery where a lottery ticket costs 1 dollar, many people get a $5 prize and very few get a very big, multi-million dollar prize. In simulated situations, a significant proportion of participants became addicted to playing this lottery: they eagerly participated in it again and again.\nWhat we do in this paper. In this paper, we provide a natural explanation for this phenomenon: namely, we explain why lotteries with two levels of rewards are more addictive."

            "text": "Naive picture of the situation. In order to understand the situation, let us start with the first \u2013 as it turns out, naive \u2013 description of the situation. In this (naive) picture, when people engage in some repeated financial arrangements, they expect to earn some money. This is why people invest money in stocks or place them in a savings account \u2013 this way they expect to gain more than they invested. This is true for investments, but can this explain why people play lotteries in the first place? As it turns out, not really.\nWhy Do People Become Addicted 3\nIndeed, if a person plays the above-described simple lottery \u2013 in which we get a reward r with probability p \u2013 a large number of times N, then we get this reward in approximately p \u00b7N cases, so the overall reward is equal to p \u00b7N \u00b7 r. To get this reward, the person needs to buy N lottery tickets. So, if we denote the price of a ticket by t, the person spends the amount t \u00b7N.\nIn this picture, a person should play the lottery only if his/her expected gain is larger than his/her investment, i.e., if p \u00b7N \u00b7 r > t \u00b7N. But where can this extra money come from? The only possibility is for this money to come from the lottery organizers, but this does not make sense: why would the lottery organizers give away money? Lotteries usually earn money for the state, not lose them. So, this naive picture not only does not explain why people get addicted, it does not even explain why people play lotteries in the first place.\nA similar conclusion can be made for any lottery i, in which we get:\n\u2022 money reward ri1 with probability pi1, \u2022 money reward ri2 with probability pi2, etc.,\nIn this case, after N plays, we get:\n\u2022 money reward ri1 approximately N \u00b7 pi1 times, \u2022 money reward ri2 approximately N \u00b7 pi2 times, etc.\nSo, the overall reward is equal to\nN \u00b7 pi1 \u00b7 ri1 +N \u00b7 pi2 \u00b7 ri2 + . . . ,\nand the average reward per play is equal to\npi1 \u00b7 ri1 + pi2 \u00b7 ri2 + . . . (1)\nUnless the lottery organizers give out money for free, this expected amount cannot be larger than the price of a lottery ticket. Thus, from this naive viewpoint, people should not play lotteries at all \u2013 but they do. Why?\nA more adequate picture of the situation. Researchers have been analyzing human decision making for many decades. In particular, they analyzed a question of how a rational person should make decisions. Their conclusion (see, e.g., [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]) is that a rational person, when presented several situations i in which he/she will get:\n\u2022 money reward ri1 with probability pi1, \u2022 money reward ri2 with probability pi2, etc.,\nshould select an alternative i for which the following expression is the largest possible:\nui = pi1 \u00b7u(ri1)+ pi2 \u00b7u(ri2)+ . . . , (2)\nfor some function u(r) (called utility function) describing this person\u2019s preferences.\n4 Christopher Reyes and Vladik Kreinovich\nThis formula is similar to the above \u201cnaive\u201d formula (1), the main difference is that instead of computing the expected value (1) of the monetary gain ri j, we compute the expected value of the utility u(ri j) of this gain \u2013 which, crudely speaking, describes the people \u201cdegree of happiness\u201d upon receiving such gain.\nThat the degree of happiness is not directly proportion to the monetary amount makes sense. If it was, then every time you get an extra $1, you would experience the same increase in happiness. In reality, however:\n\u2022 if you have no money and someone gives you $1, then you become very happy; \u2022 on the other hand, if you already have $100 and someone gives you $1, then your\ndegree of happiness does not change that much.\nIn other words, the perceived difference between having $0 and $1 is much higher than the perceived difference between having $100 and $101.\nEmpirical studies found that this aspect of human behavior can be reasonably well described if we use the square root utility function u(r) = \u221a r; see, e.g., [4, 7]. In this case, indeed, the difference u(101)\u2212u(100) = \u221a 101\u2212 \u221a\n100 \u2248 0.05 is much smaller than the difference u(1)\u2212u(0) = \u221a 1\u2212 \u221a 0 = 1.\nIn this approach, the person is willing to play a lottery in which he/she gains r j with probability p j, j = 1,2, . . . if his/her expected utility\np1 \u00b7 \u221a r1 + p2 \u00b7 \u221a r2 + . . .\nis larger than the utility \u221a t corresponding to the ticket price t:\np1 \u00b7 \u221a r1 + p2 \u00b7 \u221a r2 + . . .\u2265 \u221a t. (1)\nThis more adequate model still does not explain why people play lotteries. Indeed, as one can easily check, the function f (x) = \u221a x is strictly concave \u2013 since its second derivative is negative. Concaveness means that for all possible convex combinations r = n \u2211\ni=1 pi \u00b7 ri, where pi \u2265 0 and\nn \u2211\ni=1 pi = 1, we have\nn\n\u2211 i=1 pi \u00b7 f (ri)\u2264 f\n( n\n\u2211 i=1 pi \u00b7 ri\n) .\nStrict concaveness means that unless one of the values pi is equal to 1 and other to 0, we have a strict inequality:\nn\n\u2211 i=1 pi \u00b7 f (ri)< f\n( n\n\u2211 i=1 pi \u00b7 ri\n) .\nIn particular, for our case, when f (r)= \u221a\nr and when some probabilities are different from 0 and 1, we get\nWhy Do People Become Addicted 5\nn\n\u2211 i=1\npi \u00b7 \u221a ri <\n\u221a n\n\u2211 i=1 pi \u00b7 ri. (2)\nAs we have mentioned, the folks organizing the lottery are not willing to lose money, so the average gain must be smaller than or equal to the price t of the lottery ticket:\nn\n\u2211 i=1 pi \u00b7 ri \u2264 t. (3)\nBy taking square root of both sides of this inequality, we conclude that:\u221a n\n\u2211 i=1\npi \u00b7 ri \u2264 \u221a t. (4)\nCombining (2) and (4), we conclude that\nn\n\u2211 i=1\npi \u00b7 \u221a ri < \u221a t,\ni.e., that the condition (1) is never satisfied \u2013 and thus, that rational people should not play lotteries.\nHow can we explain that they not only play lotteries once in a while, but that many folks even become addicted to playing them?\nLet us use an even more adequate model. The fact that the above model does not always explain human behavior means that we need to consider an even more adequate model of human behavior \u2013 a model that would take into account some additional features of human behavior.\nOne possibility for providing such more adequate model comes from the fact that the above model (implicitly) assumes that people adequately estimate the probabilities of different events. In reality, people tend to overestimate small probabilities. This phenomenon is described, e.g., in [4]. In [6, 7], we provide a possible theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Based on this explanation, provide a formula relating a subjective probability ps of an event \u2013 i.e., the values that people use to make decisions \u2013 and the actual probability p: ps = 2 \u03c0 \u00b7arcsin(\u221ap). For small value\np, this means ps = cp \u00b7 \u221a\np for some constant cp. Thus, when making decisions, people maximize the expression\nn\n\u2211 i=1\npsi \u00b7u(ri) = cp \u00b7 n\n\u2211 i=1\n\u221a pi \u00b7 \u221a ri = cp \u00b7\nn\n\u2211 i=1\n\u221a pi \u00b7 ri.\nSo, they play the lottery if\ncp \u00b7 n\n\u2211 i=1\n\u221a pi \u00b7ui > cp \u00b7 \u221a t,\n6 Christopher Reyes and Vladik Kreinovich\ni.e., equivalently, if n\n\u2211 i=1\n\u221a pi \u00b7ui > \u221a t. (5)\nFor a simple lottery, this means that \u221a p \u00b7 r > \u221a\nt. Since for a simple lottery, we must have p \u00b7 r \u2264 t \u2013 otherwise the lottery organizers will be losing money \u2013 the inequality \u221a p \u00b7 r > \u221a t is not possible.\nThis explains why simple lotteries are not addictive.\nWhat about more complex lotteries. For an above-described more complex lottery, with two levels of rewards, when p\u2113 \u00b7R+ pm \u00b7 r \u2248 t, we have\n( \u221a p\u2113 \u00b7R+ \u221a pm \u00b7 r)2 = p\u2113 \u00b7R+ pm \u00b7 r+2 \u221a (p\u2113 \u00b7R) \u00b7 (pm \u00b7 r)> t.\nSo, in this case, \u221a p\u2113 \u00b7R+ \u221a pm \u00b7 r > \u221a\nt. A similar inequality holds if we consider three or more different reward levels.\nThis explains why more complex lotteries are addictive."
