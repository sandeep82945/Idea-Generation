INTRODUCTION\nOver the past two decades, topological insulators (TIs) and topological superconductors (TSCs) have attracted a great amount of interest owing to their novel properties and promising applications in a diversity of fields1\u20136. The most salient property of TIs and TSCs is the socalled bulk-boundary correspondence, which describes the one-to-one correspondence between the number of robust gapless states on the boundary of the sample and the topological invariant characterizing the bulk energy bands7. Very recently, TIs and TSCs have been further refined due to the discovery of robust gapless boundary states with higher codimension dc in some insulators and superconductors originally thought to be topologically trivial. Concretely, insulators and superconductors whose gapless boundary states have dc = n are classified as nth-order TIs8\u201325 or TSCs26\u201374. Since conventional TIs and TSCs have dc = 1, they are also dubbed firstorder topological phases. For dc = 2, the bulk-boundary correspondence is also dubbed as bulk-corner correspondence in two dimensions and bulk-hinge correspondence in three dimensions. This is because the robust gapless states are expected to be bound at some sharp corners in two dimensions and some hinges in three dimensions. In experiments, such bulk-corner correspondence and bulkhinge correspondence have been widely taken as a smoking gun to verify the realization of higher-order topological phases75\u201379.\nBesides spin-orbit coupling, it is known that the lattice structure is another important factor in the formation of first-order topological band structures. For lattices with sublattice degrees of freedom, topological band structures in general emerge easier since the multiple bands enforced by the sublattice degrees of freedom commonly support gapless Dirac points80, the precursor of various\nfirst-order topological gapped phases81, if the lattice symmetry groups have higher-dimensional irreducible representations in the Brillouin zone. The most celebrated example is the honeycomb lattice, which naturally supports Dirac points in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and supports a first-order TI when the Dirac points are gapped by the presence of spin-orbit coupling82,83. While the importance of lattice structure with sublattice degrees of freedom for the formation of first-order topological band structure is well appreciated, the impact of sublattices on the gapless boundary states has attracted much less attention except in one dimension, where the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model provides an explicit example that the boundary sublattice terminations directly determine the presence or absence of boundary bound states84. This is easy to appreciate, since in dimensions higher than one, a change of the boundary sublattice termination is known to have no effect on the existence of gapless states in a first-order topological phase.\nRecently, Zhu et al. showed that while the boundary sublattice terminations in a two-dimensional (2D) TI with honeycomb lattice do not affect the existence of helical edge states, they have a dramatic impact on the locations of boundary Dirac points, which are the crossing points of the energy dispersion of the helical edge states in the reduced boundary Brillouin zone85. Remarkably, they found that if one puts the TI in proximity to an unconventional superconductor, the sensitive sublattice dependence of boundary Dirac points allows the realization of sublattice-sensitive Majorana Kramers pairs with codimension dc = 2 even for a cylindrical-geometry system which has no sharp corners85. This finding reveals that the sublattice degrees of freedom can have an intriguing interplay with the second-order topology.\nIn two dimensions, the kagome lattice is another kind of lattice structure with sublattice degrees of free-\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n07 04\n6v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nup r-\nco n]\n2 4\nA ug\n2 02\n2\n2 dom. In recent years, kagome-lattice materials have attracted great interest as the special lattice geometry allows a diversity of novel band-structure properties, such as Dirac points, flat bands, and van Hove singularities86\u201389, which allow many interaction-driven competing orders90\u201393. Similar to the honeycomb lattice, the kagome lattice structure also supports topological insulating phases in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling94. Since the honeycomb lattice has only two sublattices whereas the kagome lattice has three, it is natural to expect that, with the increase of one more sublattice degree of freedom, the interplay between sublattices and second-order topology can result in even richer boundary physics. Motivated by this observation, in this work we perform a systematic study of the impact of sublattice terminations on the boundary physics in the kagome lattice.\nStarting with a tight-binding model describing the kagome lattice with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling that realizes a first-order TI94, we find that, similar to the honeycomb lattice, the sublattice terminations do not affect the existence of helical edge states but have a dramatic impact on the boundary Dirac points85. Putting the topological kagome insulator in proximity to a d-wave superconductor, the helical edge states are gapped as expected. Because of the strong impact of sublattice terminations on the dispersion of the helical edge states, we find that the positions of Dirac-mass domain walls binding Majorana Kramers pairs sensitively depend on the details of the boundary geometry. When all edges are uniform (only having one type of sublattice termination), the locations of Majorana Kramers pairs follow the standard picture. That is, they appear only at the corners of the system26\u201330. However, when two types of sublattice terminations appear on the same edge, we find that the sublattice domain walls, corresponding to the interface of two distinct types of sublattice terminations, can also bind Majorana Kramers pairs. Most remarkably, we find that when the sublattice domain walls bind Majorana Kramers pairs, the Majorana Kramers pairs can be tuned to any position on the boundary by controlling the sublattice terminations and they are no longer pinned at certain sharp corners. Furthermore, by substituting the d-wave superconductor with a conventional s-wave superconductor, we find that highly controllable sublattice-sensitive Majorana zero modes (MZMs) can also be realized if an in-plane Zeeman field is additionally applied. Our findings reveal that the interplay between sublattices and second-order topology in the kagome lattice can also result in different boundary physics, suggesting the generality of the discussed physics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the kagome lattice and the associated Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian in the presence of both d-wave and conventional on-site s-wave pairing are introduced briefly. In Sec. III, we show that the energies of the boundary Dirac points of the topological kagome insulator have a sensitive dependence on the sublattice terminations. In\nSec. IV, it is shown that corner and sublattice-sensitive Majorana Kramers pairs can be realized when the topological kagome insulator is in proximity to a d-wave superconductor. In Sec. V, we illustrate that corner and sublattice-sensitive MZMs can be realized by breaking time-reversal (TR) symmetry via an in-plane Zeeman field when the topological kagome insulator is in proximity to a conventional s-wave superconductor. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Sec. VI."

            "text": "TERMINATIONS IN THE NORMAL STATE\nWithout HM, the tight-binding Hamiltonian HN(k) corresponds to a generalization of the Kane-Mele model from the honeycomb lattice to the kagome lattice and describes a TI as long as \u03bb 6= 094. As a first-order topological phase, the bulk-boundary correspondence dictates the existence of a pair of gapless helical states on the open boundary, irrespective of the orientation or microscopic details of the boundary. This, however, does not mean that the physical properties of the helical edge states are insensitive to the microscopic details of the boundary. For the Kane-Mele model on the honeycomb lattice with two sublattices, it was shown that the boundary Dirac points would shift from one TR invariant momentum to the other when the edge changes its termination from one sublattice to the other85. In addition, the boundary Dirac points would stay at the same energy if there is no potential offset between the two types of sublattices to break the particle-hole symmetry85. In comparison, the kagome lattice has three types of sublattices and there is no particle-hole symmetry; thus the impact of sublattice terminations may be quite different from the honeycomb lattice.\nTo reveal the impact of sublattice terminations on the helical edge states in the kagome lattice, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian under different boundary conditions. Without loss of generality, we consider a cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary conditions in the a1 direction and open boundary conditions in the a2 direction;\nfor simplicity, we refer to those directions as the x and y directions, respectively. For this geometry, it is easy to see from Fig. 1(a) that a flat y-normal edge has two types of sublattice terminations; one being the AB type (w = 0) and the other being the C type (w = Nx). Here 0 \u2264 w \u2264 Nx denotes the number of C sites on the edge.\nWhen both the top and bottom y-normal edges have the AB-type termination, the numerical results show that the energy dispersion of the helical edge states on the top and bottom edges are degenerate, as shown in Fig. 1(b), which is a result of the inversion symmetry for such a choice of boundary conditions. Upon modifying the termination of the top edge from AB type to C type, the numerical results show that the degeneracy is strongly lifted as a result of inversion symmetry breaking, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Comparing Fig. 1(c) with Fig. 1(b), it is readily found that the boundary Dirac points for the helical boundary states on the top edge (red dispersions) have a considerable energy shift when the termination is changed from AB type to C type, suggesting that the properties of the helical edge states also have a sensitive dependence on the boundary termination in the kagome lattice.\nBefore proceeding, it would be illuminating to make a further comparison of the boundary physics in the honeycomb and kagome lattices. For the honeycomb lattice, each edge only supports one boundary Dirac point since the helical edge states only exist in a window of the reduced boundary Brillouin zone82,83. With the change of sublattice terminations, the boundary Dirac point will shift from one TR invariant momentum to the other in the reduced boundary Brillouin zone. This shift of boundary Dirac point can be intuitively understood by noting that if one views the boundary momentum as a parameter, the 2D particle-hole symmetric Kane-Mele Hamiltonian can be viewed as a parameter-dependent\n4 a)\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\n9 10 11\nA2 B2\nC2\nw\na1\na2\nFIG. 1.

IV), the left, bottom, and right edges of the lattice respectively terminate with sublattices A (orange dots) and C (blue dots), A and B (green dots), and B. With periodic boundary conditions in the x direction, sublattice terminations refer to the top and bottom edges only. We vary the sublattice termination of the top edge by tuning w, i.e., it can be terminated with sublattice C (A and B) for w = Nx (w = 0). A domain wall between the C and AB terminations occurs for 0 < w < Nx. The triangular unit vectors are denoted by a1 = x\u0302 and a2 = (x\u0302 + \u221a 3y\u0302)/2.

The edge states tangentially merge with the bulk states in the energy spectrum.\none-dimensional Hamiltonian, and it corresponds to a spinful SSH model with opposite topological properties (or say opposite dimerization) at the two TR invariant boundary momenta84,85,95. For the kagome lattice, a close inspection of Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) reveals that the helical edge states exist in the whole reduced boundary Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the boundary Dirac points for the AB-type edge (blue dispersions) overlap with the bulk states in energy, while the boundary Dirac points for the C-type edge (red dispersions) are well located in the energy gap. The large energy shift in the boundary Dirac points from one sublattice termination to the other is due to the absence of any symmetry constraint on the energy of boundary Dirac points. For a given edge, the energy offset between Fermi level and boundary Dirac point directly affects the locations of boundary Fermi points. Since the properties of the Fermi surface play a crucial role in a weak-coupling superconducting system,\nit is natural to expect that the sublattice-sensitive large energy shift of boundary Dirac points also allows the realization of sublattice-sensitive Majorana bound states in a topological kagome insulator that is proximity-coupled to a superconductor."

            "heading": "IV. MAJORANA KRAMERS PAIRS AT CORNERS AND SUBLATTICE DOMAIN WALLS",
            "text": "MZMs at the corners of an open system are viewed as a defining property of second-order TSCs in two dimensions26\u201330. In previous works, it was shown that, when a TI without sublattice degrees of freedom is in proximity to a d-wave superconductor, Majorana Kramers pairs will emerge at the system\u2019s corners if the edges forming the corners are along crystallographic directions that are separated by a line node of the d-wave pairing function in momentum space27. The underlying physics can be simply understood via the Jackiw-Rebbi theory96. That is, the emergence of Majorana Kramers pairs is a consequence of the formation of Dirac-mass domain walls at the corners. More precisely, d-wave superconductivity will introduce a Dirac mass to gap out the helical edge states, and the sign of the Dirac mass will follow the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing27. If the line-node direction of the d-wave pairing is along the (11) and (11\u0304) directions, then a square lattice with edges in the (01) and (10) directions will carry four Majorana Kramers pairs, one per each of the four corners27. Since the pairing line-node direction is fixed, if the helical edge states are not sensitive to local deformations of the boundary, then the Dirac-mass domain walls in such systems, and thus the locations of the Majorana Kramers pairs, will also not be sensitive to such changes.\nAbove, we have shown that the sublattice terminations have a strong impact on the dispersion of helical edge states in topological kagome insulators. A natural question is whether those sublattice terminations also have a strong impact on corner MZMs. To compare with known results, we first focus on the TR invariant case (hx = 0) and also consider d-wave pairing.\nAs before, we first consider a cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary conditions in the x direction and open boundary conditions in the y direction. To see the difference for edges with different terminations, we consider the two y-normal edges to be different, with the top one being the C type and the lower one being the AB type. The normal-state band structure is then given in Fig. 1(c). In Fig. 2, we choose the chemical potential to be located within the gap between the top band and the middle band and show the evolution of the BdG energy spectra with respect to the chemical potential. In Fig. 2(a), we choose the chemical potential to be located near the upper Dirac point at kx = \u03c0 shown in Fig. 1(c). As expected, the numerical result shows that d-wave pairing opens a gap in both the top (red) and bottom (blue) edge dispersions. The resulting gaps, however, have dif-\n5\nferent magnitudes on the top and bottom edges. With the increase of chemical potential (tuning the chemical potential further away from the boundary Dirac point at kx = \u03c0), we find that the top edge will undergo a closing-and-reopening transition in the energy gap, while the energy gap for the bottom edge remains finite in the whole range of chemical potentials considered, as shown in Figs. 2(b)-2(d).\nThe distinct evolution of the boundary BdG energy spectrum with respect to the chemical potential on the top C-type edge and bottom AB-type edge can be understood via a low-energy edge theory. At a qualitative level, the low-energy physics on the edges is described by\nHC/AB(q\u03b1) = \u03b1(q\u03b1)\u03c4z \u2297 s0 + v\u03b1q\u03b1\u03c4z \u2297 sz \u2212\u03b4\u00b5\u03b1\u03c4z \u2297 s0 + \u2206eff,\u03b1(q\u03b1)\u03c4y \u2297 sy, (5)\nwhere q\u03b1 denotes the momentum measured from the TR invariant momentum kx,\u03b1 = 0/\u03c0, \u03b1 describes the particle-hole asymmetry of the Dirac cone at kx,\u03b1, v\u03b1 refers to the corresponding velocity, \u03b4\u00b5\u03b1 denotes the chemical potential measured from the corresponding Dirac point, and \u2206eff,\u03b1 describes the boundary pairing, which is determined by projecting the bulk pairing onto the subspace spanned by the wave functions of helical edge states. Based on the low-energy Hamiltonian, the boundary energy gap closes when the boundary pairing nodes determined by \u2206eff,\u03b1(q\u03b1) = 0 coincide with the boundary Fermi points determined by \u00b1v\u03b1q\u03b1 = \u03b4\u00b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1(q\u03b1). Without needing to know the detailed forms of \u03b1, v\u03b1, \u03b4\u00b5\u03b1, and \u2206eff,\u03b1, one can infer from Fig. 1(c) that the critical Fermi momenta at which the boundary energy gap closes should be different on the two types of edges. For the range of chemical potential considered in Fig. 2, the change of Fermi momenta on the C-type edge covers a considerable fraction of the Brillouin zone, while the change of Fermi momenta on the AB-type edge only covers a small range. This ex-\nplains why the boundary energy gap undergoes a closingand-reopening transition on the C-type edge but remains open on the AB-type edge when the chemical potential varies in the range considered.\nIt is worth noting that the closing-and-reopening transition suggests a change in the boundary topology on the top edge. Since a 1D TR invariant superconductor follows a Z2 classification97,98, if the top and bottom edges have the same topology before the closing-and-reopening transition, then they can have different topology after the transition and vice versa. When the top and bottom edges have different topology, the system will inevitably harbor Dirac-mass domain walls on the boundary if the remaining direction is also cut open.\nOur results for the cylindrical geometry confirm that the sublattice terminations have a strong impact on the boundary BdG energy spectrum and thus the boundary\n6 topology of the superconducting state. Next we consider a geometry with open boundary conditions in both x and y directions and investigate the impact of sublattice terminations on the locations of Majorana Kramers pairs. Without loss of generality, we choose the left boundary to be an AC-type edge and the right boundary to be a B-type edge, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We choose the chemical potential to cross the upper boundary Dirac point at kx = \u03c0, in the gap between the two uppermost bands [Fig. 1(c)]. When both the top and bottom\ny-normal boundaries are AB-type edges, the numerical result shows that there are only two Majorana Kramers pairs. Furthermore, they are localized at two corners corresponding to the ends of the left AC-type edge, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The result in Fig. 3(a) suggests that the Dirac mass on the left AC-type edge has a sign opposite to the other three edges. It is worth noting that the properties of helical edge states on the AC-type edge and AB-type edge are the same since the two edges are related by a 120\u25e6 rotation and the normal Hamiltonian is invariant under such a rotation. Thus the sign difference between AC-type edge and AB-type edge can be intuitively understood through the angular dependence of d-wave pairing, whereas the sign difference between ACtype edge and B-type edge needs to be understood via the change of boundary topology induced by the change of sublattice terminations illustrated in Fig. 2. Because of the strong impact of sublattice terminations, remarkably, we find that the locations of the Majorana Kramers pairs will move with the local change of sublattice terminations, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c).\nThe displacement of Majorana Kramers pairs with the local change of sublattice termination can be simply understood from the fact that this change can modify the boundary topology of a given edge, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Within a low-energy description, it is known that the boundary physics can be effectively described by a real-space linear Dirac Hamiltonian of the form27,81\nH = \u2212 i 2 \u03931{v(l), \u2202l}+M(l)\u03932, (6)\nwhere v(l) denotes the velocity whose value depends on the boundary coordinate l (l is defined modulo the boundary perimeter) but the sign is fixed, M(l) denotes the Dirac mass, and \u03931,2 are 4\u00d7 4 anticommuting Dirac matrices. Note that, because v(l) is space dependent, the first term of this equation is symmetrized to make it Hermitian. It is worth emphasizing that this symmetrized form, just like the standard form81, supports solutions for Majorana bound states at the Dirac-mass domain walls where M(l) changes sign.

            "text": "When TR symmetry is broken by an in-plane Zeeman field, second-order topological superconductivity can be realized even with a conventional s-wave superconductor in proximity to the TI47. Without sublattice degrees of freedom, previous works showed that the resulting MZMs will again be pinned at the system corners if the edges of the system are sharp47. In this section, we are going to investigate whether the presence of sublattice degrees of freedom will modify this picture.\nIn parallel to the TR symmetric case, we first consider a similar cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary conditions in the x direction and open boundary conditions in the y direction, and the top and bottom y-normal edges are also respectively set to the C and AB types. Without loss of generality, we choose the Fermi level to cross the boundary Dirac point of the top edge, in the uppermost band gap, and investigate the evolution of the BdG energy spectra with respect to the Zeeman field. For a fixed pairing strength, we find that s-wave pairing also opens a gap in the helical edge states on both the top and the bottom edges, as shown in Fig. 4(a). With the increase of Zeeman field, we find that the energy gap on the top edge undergoes a closing-and-reopening transition at the TR invariant momentum kx = \u03c0, while the energy gap on the bottom edge stays open in the whole range of field considered, as shown in Figs. 4(b)-4(d).

(Color online) MZMs at the corners and sublattice domain walls of the kagome lattice, for top-edge sublattice terminations with (a) w = 0, (b) w = 20, and (c) w = 60 [see Fig. 1(a)]. The red stars in the left panels represent MZMs; their corresponding probability densities and positions are plotted in the right panels. In (b) and (c), there is one MZM at the C-AB sublattice domain wall. Chosen parameters are t = 1, \u03bb = 0.2, \u00b5 = 1.442, \u22060 = 0.1, hx = 0.2, Nx = 100, and Ny = 50. The positions of the MZMs can be precisely manipulated by locally controlling the sublattice terminations.\nformula similar to the widely known form in superconducting nanowire systems99,100, i.e., hc = \u221a (\u03b4\u00b5)2 + \u220620, where \u03b4\u00b5 refers to the energy offset between the Fermi level and the boundary Dirac point. For s-wave pairing, because the Dirac mass induced by pairing is uniform on the boundary, there will be no Dirac-mass domain walls binding Majorana Kramers pairs on the boundary when the Zeeman field is absent. In the presence of Zeeman field, since a 1D superconductor without TR symmetry also follows a Z2 classification97,98, Dirac-mass domain walls binding MZMs will inevitably emerge when the Zeeman field drives some of the edges into a different topological regime.\nTo investigate the impact of sublattice termination on the MZMs for this TR symmetry breaking case, we next consider a geometry with open boundary conditions in both x and y directions. Without loss of generality, similar to the d-wave pairing case, we consider that the left\nand right boundaries are fixed to be AC-type and Btype edges, respectively, and the bottom y-normal edge is fixed to the AB type. In Fig. 5(a), the numerical results show that, when the top y-normal edge also assumes the AB-type termination, there are only two MZMs with their wave functions mainly localized at the two corners corresponding to the two ends of the right B-type edge. The locations of the MZMs can be simply understood by noting that the AB-type edge and AC-type edge should have the same topology. This can be inferred from the following facts. First, as aforementioned, the AB-type edge and AC-type edge are related by a 60\u25e6 rotation. Second, we have previously pointed out that the physical properties of the concerned system are invariant under the rotation of the in-plane Zeeman field, so the physical properties of the BdG Hamiltonian with on-site s-wave pairing are invariant under such a rotation. On the other hand, we have shown in Fig. 4 that the Zeeman field will induce a closing-and-reopening transition in the boundary energy gap on the C-type edge. Since the B-type edge is also related to the C-type edge by a 60\u25e6 rotation, their boundary topology should be the same. Thus, the boundary topology on the B-type edge is distinct from the other three edges for the set of parameters considered, leading to the formation of MZMs at the two corners shown in Fig. 5(a).\nBy changing part of the top y-normal edge\u2019s sublattice termination to the C type from the left, we find the emergence of a new pair of MZMs, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Furthermore, the MZM located at the sublattice domain walls between C-type and AB-type terminations is found to track the location of the sublattice domain walls, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The additional presence and movement of the MZMs can also be simply understood by noting that the boundary topology on the C-type edge is distinct to the AB-type and AC-type edge. It is worth noting that, in Fig. 5, the wave functions of MZMs display a much stronger localization on the B-type and Ctype edges than on the AB-type and AC-type edges. The remarkable difference in localization on different edges is a result of the remarkable difference in boundary energy spectra [see Fig. 4(c)]. Roughly speaking, the MZM wave functions obey the approximate Jackiw-Rebbi form,\n\u03c8(x) \u221d e\u2212 \u222b x M(x\u2032) v dx \u2032 . (7)\nThus their localization properties are controlled by the ratio of Dirac mass M to velocity v. Along C (or B) edges, the boundary gap (and thus Dirac mass) is larger and the velocity is smaller than along the AB (or AC) edges [Fig. 4(d)]. Therefore, the MZMs are more strongly localized along the C or B edges than along the AB or AC edges.\nThe emergence of additional MZMs and their displacement with the local change of sublattice terminations are also due to the sensitive dependence of the boundary topology on the sublattice terminations. The numerical results above reveal that, for this TR symmetry breaking case, all MZMs can also in principle be tuned away from\n8 the corners to any position on the boundary due to their sensitive dependence on sublattice terminations."

            "text": "Bound states pinned at corners of an open system have been widely taken as a characteristic property of secondorder topology in two dimensions. For systems without sublattice degrees of freedom, this scenario generally holds, because the boundary topology is not sensitive to the local change of boundary geometry. Rather, the change of boundary topology associated with the formation of Dirac-mass domain walls can only occur at certain corners of the system. In this work, we considered heterostructures composed of first-order TIs with kagome lattice structure and superconductors in proximity, and investigated the impact of boundary sublattice terminations on the locations of Majorana bound states. Because of the three-sublattice structure of the kagome lattice, we found that the boundary topology has a sensitive dependence on sublattice terminations. Such a sensitive sublattice dependence allows Majorana bound states to be positioned anywhere on the boundary, rather than being pinned at the corners of the system. This remarkable tunability can benefit the detection of Majorana bound states as well as their manipulation for applications to topological quantum computing.\nOur findings for the kagome lattice can be straightforwardly generalized to the 2D Lieb lattice, owing to their\nmany similarities in physical properties101,102. Together with a previous study on the honeycomb lattice85, our present study reveals that sublattice degrees of freedom have a strong and interesting interplay with second-order topology. Since sublattice degrees of freedom are ubiquitous in real materials, the existence of sublattice-sensitive bound states is expected to be a common property of systems with sublattice degrees of freedom and second-order topology. In the past few years, a considerable amount of kagome materials have been found to exhibit nontrivial topological properties103\u2013105. With the fast accumulation of material candidates, our predictions are expected to be testable in the near future. In experiments, we suggest the use of scanning tunneling microscopy or scanning force microscopy to manipulate the sublattice terminations106,107."
