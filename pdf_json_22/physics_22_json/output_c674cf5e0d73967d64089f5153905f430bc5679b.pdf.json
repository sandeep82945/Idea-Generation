Structurally the compounds of\ninterest are found to be stable. Both compounds possess elastic stability, anisotropy, and ductility\ndetermined by the elastic studies. The electronic-band structure analysis shows the semiconductor\nnature of GaBeCl3 and InBeCl3 compounds with indirect band gaps of 3.08 eV for GaBeCl3 and 2.04 eV for InBeCl3 along with the symmetrical points from (X\u2013G). The calculated total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of these compounds reveal that for the GaBeCl3 compound, the contribution of Ga (4p) and Cl (3p) orbital states in the valence, as well as the conduction band, is\ndominant. While for InBeCl3, the contribution of Cl (3p) states as well as In (5s) is large in the valence band and in that of Cl (3p-states) states in the conduction band. The type of chemical bonding is found\nto be ionic in both compounds. The optical properties i.e., the real (31(u)) and imaginary (32(u)) parts of dielectric function, refractive index n(u), optical reflectivity R(u), optical conductivity s(u), absorption\ncoefficient a(u), energy loss L(u) and electron extinction coefficient k(u) are also discussed in terms of\noptical spectra. It is reported that n(u) and k(u) exhibit the same characteristics as 31(u) and 32(u) respectively. Efficient application of these materials can be seen in semiconducting industries and many\nmodern electronic devices."

Therefore, the material GaBeCl3 can be regarded as semiconducting which possessing an indirect band gap of 3.08 eV, while InBeCl3 possesses a band gap of 2.04 eV and thus a semiconductor.\nTo better understand the electronic properties, the TDOS and PDOS are calculated for both compounds. Fig. 4(a\u2013d) illustrates the TDOS and PDOS for the GaBeCl3 compound. TDOS is divided into three regions. In the rst region from 7 to 1, Cl (p-states) contributes the maximum. In the second region from 1 to 0, the contribution of Ga (4p-states), as well as Cl (3p-states) atoms, is large. These are the regions below the Fermi energy (EF). Above EF, again the contribution of Ga (4pstates) and Cl (3p-states) atoms is large. Consequently, in both the valence band as well as the conduction band Ga and Cl, p orbital states are maximum. Similarly, Fig. 4(e\u2013h) shows the TDOS and PDOS for the InBeCl3 compound. Here the contribution of Cl (3p-states) is large in the energy range of 12 to 3 eV. However, in the region from 3 to 0, In (5s-states) atoms contribution is large. In addition, a Cl (3p-states) atom also makes a certain contribution. Above EF, in the energy range from 3\u20138 eV, Cl (3p-states) atoms participation is maximum. Hence the contribution of states in the valence band of InBeCl3 is due to Cl (3p-states) and In (5s-states) and in that of the conduction band is due to the Cl (3p-states) only.

It is reported that with the change in cation from Ga to In, the lattice constant and ground state energy decreases while bulk modulus and pressure derivative of bulk modulus increase. The elastic properties conrmed the anisotropic and ductile nature of both the compounds. Furthermore, the studied compounds have mechanical stability which is the key requirement for applications in high-performance electronic devices. The ionic type of chemical bonding is present in the compounds. In addition, the investigated electronic-band structure reveals the narrow bandgap semiconducting nature of the compounds with the indirect gap of 3.1 eV along (X\u2013G) for GaBeCl3 and InBeCl3compounds. The results of TDOS and PDOS for GaBeCl3 and InBeCl3 compound shows that in both the valence band as well as the conduction band Ga (4p-states) and Cl (3p-states) atoms contribution are maximum for GaBeCl3. However, in InBeCl3 the contribution of Cl (3p-states) and In (5s-states) in the conduction band and that of Cl (3p-states) in the valence band is large. In addition, the optical properties of GaBeCl3 and InBeCl3 are calculated in the photon energy range of 0\u201340 eV. It is reported that n(u) and k(u) exhibit the same characteristics as 31(u) and 32(u) respectively. The computed properties of this work must be considered to understand and utilize the possible technical benets in device manufacturing in semiconducting industries.
