    "abstractText": "Motivated by recently explored examples, we undertake a systematic study of conformal invariance in one-dimensional sigma models where an isometry group has been gauged. Perhaps surprisingly, we uncover classes of sigma models which are only scale invariant in their ungauged form and become fully conformally invariant only after gauging. In these cases the target space of the gauged sigma model satisfies a deformation of the well-known conformal geometry constraints. We consider bosonic models as well as their N = 1, 2, 4 supersymmetric extensions. We solve the quantum ordering ambiguities in implementing (super-) conformal symmetry on the physical Hilbert space. Examples of our general results are furnished by the D(2, 1; 0)-invariant Coulomb branch quiver models relevant for black hole physics.",

            "text": "Quantum mechanical systems which possess conformal symmetry, and their supersymmetric extensions, have appeared in a wide variety of interesting contexts since their initial inception in [1], see [2] for a review. One notable application is to the moduli space mechanics of extremal black holes [3] and, on a more microscopic level, as an effective description for the dynamics of their constituent D-branes [4, 5]. The precise connection between these descriptions and (near-)AdS2/CFT1 holography, along the lines of e.g. [6\u201310], as well as pure-Higgs states and scaling black holes [11\u201316] remains an interesting open question.\nA fundamental class of models are the bosonic nonlinear sigma models, describing the motion of a spinless particle in a Riemannian target spaceM. The requirement of conformal invariance of the action then translates into a specific additional geometric structure onM, as was worked out in [17, 18].\nMany interesting applications arise when supersymmetry is added to the mix. The geometry of supersymmetric one-dimensional sigma models was systematically investigated in [19, 20], see [21] for a pedagogic introduction and a comprehensive guide to the extensive literature. Supersymmetric mechanics can be described in terms of a zoo of multiplets that are traditionally denoted by their number of (bosonic, fermionic, auxiliary) fields. The most elegant and geometric formulations use (N ,N , 0) multiplets without auxiliary fields, these are sometimes also referred to as Type B and arise from dimensional reduction of 2d (N , 0) supersymmetry. The conditions for supersymmetry can then be phrased purely in terms of geometric structures on M and the supersymmetric ground states can be identified with cohomology classes of a suitable differential complex [22]. The geometric conditions for various amounts of superconformal symmetry for these multiplets were worked out in [17, 23].\nThe (N ,N , 0) sigma models play a distinguished role since other multiplets with auxiliary fields can often be recast in terms of them by gauging some of their isometries, see e.g. [24\u201326]. This sparks the question what the geometric conditions are for (super)conformal invariance in a generic one-dimensional sigma model where a group G of isometries ofM has been gauged (see [27] for more details on gauged sigma models). In this work we will address this question systematically for bosonic as well as (N ,N , 0) supersymmetric sigma models including a Lorentz coupling to a background electromagnetic field.\nIt should be remarked that, when the group of isometries G acts regularly without fixed points, the gauged sigma model is classically equivalent to an ungauged sigma model on the quotient spaceM/G. In the bosonic case, the resulting sigma model on the quotient satisfies the standard conformal geometry constraints of [17, 18]. In the supersymmetric case however, the quotienting procedure leads to a supersymmetric sigma model that is no longer formulated in terms of (N ,N , 0) multiplets, as it eliminates bosonic fields but leaves the number of fermionic fields intact. For these realizations of supersymmetry the conformal invariance conditions have not yet been worked out in the literature, and our construction leads to previously unstudied superconformal theories.\nAn additional motivation is that working with the gauged formulation in terms of (N ,N , 0) multiplets on the extended space M has significant benefits for quantizing the model. For N = 2 (N = 4), the extended target space M possesses a (hyper-) K\u00e4hler\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nstructure with torsion which is lost in the M/G formulation. For example, using the formulation as a gauged model onM, we will be able to give a geometric characterization of ground states as certain G-invariant cohomology classes onM. The paper is organized as follows. We obtain the conditions for conformal invariance in gauged bosonic and N = 1, 2, 4 supersymmetric sigma models in sections 2 and 3, 4, 5 respectively. The corresponding (super) conformal algebras are sl(2,R), osp(1|2), su(1, 1|1) and D(2, 1;\u03b1). In each case we also solve the operator ordering problem in the quantum theory and obtain a realization of these algebras on the Hilbert space. In the N = 2, 4 cases we give an explicit realization of the quantum generators as operators acting on differential forms, and characterize supersymmetric ground states as elements of the cohomology of a suitable differential complex. Along the way we provide more details on gauged supersymmetric sigma models and work out a target space covariant approach for conformal invariance. In section 6 we discuss an interesting class of examples which inspired our general analysis and arises from N = 4 superconformal theories formulated in terms of (3,4,1) multiplets. As was found in [5, 28], these can be reformulated geometrically in terms of type B sigma models with (4,4,0) multiplets where a certain isometry group is gauged. These form nontrivial examples of our construction where the model becomes D(2, 1; 0) \u223c= psu(1, 1|2) o su(2) superconformally invariant only after gauging. This class of models is also physically relevant as it includes the effective description of the Coulomb branch D-brane mechanics in an AdS2 scaling limit of the charges, which in turn provide an infinite set of explicit models with D(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry."

The algebra is generated by the Hamiltonian H, a dilatation operator D and a generator of special conformal transformations K satisfying the Poisson brackets\n{D,H} = \u2212H (2.1) {D,K} = K (2.2) {H,K} = 2D (2.3)\nAn interesting class of models are the bosonic nonlinear sigma models, describing the motion of a spinless particle in a Riemannian target space. These can be further generalized to include a potential term and/or a Lorentz coupling to a target space gauge potential. The requirement of conformal invariance of the action then translates into additional and restrictive geometric structure of the target space, as was worked out in [17, 18]. When the target space of the sigma model possesses a group of isometries, we can consider sigma models where the corresponding symmetries are gauged. In this section we investigate the conditions for conformal symmetry in such gauged nonlinear sigma models. As anticipated in the Introduction, we will encounter interesting models which become conformally invariant only after gauging, and where the target space satisfies a deformation of the conformal geometry constraints of [17, 18].

            "text": "We first review the gauging of one-dimensional bosonic sigma models with Lorentz coupling, referring to [27] for more details. We start from a bosonic particle sigma model describing motion in a Riemannian target space of dimension d with metric GAB(x), and we also include a coupling to a background vector potential AA(x). It will be useful to split the Lagrangian in a first- and second-order part in time derivatives as follows:\nLB = L(1)B + L (2) B (2.5)\nL (1) B = AAx\u0307 A (2.6) L (2) B = 1 2GABx\u0307 Ax\u0307B. (2.7)\nWe assume in addition that the action is invariant under a set of global symmetries of the form\n\u03b4xA = \u03bbIkAI . (2.8)\nwhere kAI (x) are vector fields in target space. Closure and Jacobi identities of the algebra of symmetry transformations require that\nLkIkJ = f K IJ kK , (2.9)\nwith f KIJ the structure constants of a Lie algebra which we will denote as g. We denote the dimension of g by dg. In the rest of this paper, we will assume that the g-action can be exponentiated to the action of a Lie group G on the target manifold, which furthermore acts without fixed points.\nInvariance of the action under (2.8) leads to the conditions\nikIF = dvI , LkIGAB = 0, (2.10)\nwhere F = dA and vI(x) are some potentials on target space. The second requirement states that the kI are Killing vectors. From the first relation in (2.10) one derives d(LkIvJ) = d(f KIJ vK), and therefore there must exist constants wIJ = w[IJ ] such that\nLkIvJ = f K IJ vK + wIJ . (2.11)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nThe vI are only determined up to constant shifts vI \u2192 vI +cI , under which wIJ transforms as\nwIJ \u2192 wIJ + f KIJ cK . (2.12)\nThese properties tell us that wIJ defines a Lie algebra cohomology class. Under (2.8), L(1) transforms up to a total derivative,\n\u03b4L(1) = d dt\n( \u03bbI(AAkAI + vI) ) . (2.13)\nWe recall that, in general, a symmetry with parameter \u03c3 under which the Lagrangian transforms as \u03b4\u03c3L = ddtB\u03c3 leads to a Noether charge Q\u03c3 given by\n\u03c3Q\u03c3 = \u2202L\n\u2202x\u0307A \u03b4\u03c3x\nA \u2212B\u03c3. (2.14)\nApplying this to the to the symmetries (2.8) we find the associated Noether charges MI to be\nMI = M (1)I +M (2) I = \u2212vI +GABx\u0307 AkBI . (2.15)\nWe now want to gauge the global symmetry (2.8), i.e. modify the action so that it becomes invariant under transformations of the form (2.8) with time-dependent parameters,\n\u03b4\u03bbx A = \u03bbI(t)kAI . (2.16)\nFor this purpose we introduce worldline gauge fields aI(t) with transformation law\n\u03b4\u03bba I = \u03bb\u0307I + f IJK aJ\u03bbK . (2.17)\nOne checks, using the Jacobi identities in g, that the gauge algebra closes and has the structure constants of g:\n[\u03b4\u03bb1 , \u03b4\u03bb2 ] = \u03b4\u03bb3 where \u03bbI3 = fJKI\u03bbJ1\u03bbK2 . (2.18)\nThe gauging of the second order term in time derivatives L(2) is simply achieved by replacing time derivatives with covariant derivatives Dt:\nL(1) = 12GABDtx ADtx B. (2.19)\nHere, the covariant derivative is defined as\nDtx A = x\u0307A \u2212 aIkAI , (2.20)\nand satisfies \u03b4\u03bbDtxA = \u03bbI\u2202BkAI DtxB. The gauging of the Lorentz term L(1) is more subtle and requires use of the Noether procedure [27]. Similar to the gauging of the WZW term in two-dimensional sigma models [29], the gauging is not always possible and imposes a condition on the Lie algebra g. One finds that the gauged Lagrangian is1\nL (1) B = AAx\u0307 A + aIvI . (2.21) 1The action simplifies in the special case that A defines a globally defined one-form such that LkIA = 0. In that case, one sees that the vI satisfying (2.10) with wIJ = 0 are vI = \u2212ikIA and the Lagrangian reduces to the naive minimally coupled one, L(1) = AADtxA.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nIts gauge variation yields a term proportional to wIJ defined in (2.11) which cannot be cancelled by adding further terms to the action. Gauging therefore requires that we can make wIJ vanish by a transformation of the form (2.12). In other words, the wIJ defined in (2.11) should be exact in Lie algebra cohomology and so the second Lie algebra cohomology of g classifies the obstructions to gauging [27]. A necessary condition for gauging is thus that there exist vI that satisfy (2.11) with wIJ = 0. From here onwards we will always work with that choice of vI , hence imposing (2.27) below. To summarize, we list the Lagrangian (L), gauge symmetries (GS), structural conditions (SC), algebra (A) and geometric conditions (GC) for gauged nonlinear sigma models:\nL : L(1)B = AAx\u0307 A + aIvI , L(2)B = 1 2GABDtx ADtx B (2.22)\nDtx A := x\u0307A \u2212 aIkAI\nGS : \u03b4\u03bbxA = \u03bbIkAI , \u03b4\u03bbaI = \u03bb\u0307I + f IJK aJ\u03bbK (2.23) A : [\u03b4\u03bb1 , \u03b4\u03bb2 ] = \u03b4\u03bb3 \u03bbI3 = fJKI\u03bbJ1\u03bbK2 (2.24) SC : LkIkJ = f K\nIJ kK (2.25) GC : ikIF = dvI , LkIGAB = 0 (2.26)\nLkIvJ = f K IJ vK (2.27)"

From the Lagrangian point of view, the gauged model onM is equivalent to an ungauged sigma model on the quotient manifoldM/G, while from the Hamiltonian point of view it implements a symplectic reduction of the original phase space under the action of the symmetry group G. These two approaches are equivalent since T \u2217M//G = T \u2217(M/G), i.e. the reduced phase space is indeed the phase space of the reduced model.\n2.2.1 Reduced sigma model on M/G\nSince the gauge potentials enter into the action quadratically and without time derivatives we can integrate them out to obtain a classically equivalent model with Lagrangian\nL\u0303B = A\u0303Ax\u0307A + G\u0303ABx\u0307Ax\u0307B \u2212 V\u0303 , (2.28)\nwhere\nA\u0303A = AA + kIAvI , G\u0303AB = GAB \u2212 kIAGIJkJB, V\u0303 = 1 2vIG IJvJ .

In this sense, the description as a gauged model on the larger space M is simpler. We will see that, especially when considering supersymmetric models, when quantizing the model it is advantageous use the formulation as a gauged model onM."

            "text": "With a view towards quantizing the system it is useful to point out that, from the canonical point of view, the gauging procedure implements a symplectic reduction of the phase space. Let us first illustrate the salient features of symplectic reduction (referring to [31] for more details) in our bosonic sigma models. The phase space of the ungauged theory (2.5) is 2d-dimensional with local coordinates (xA, pA). The Hamiltonian is\nHung = 1 2(pA \u2212AA)G AB(pB \u2212AB). (2.31)\nThe Noether charges (2.15), MI = kAI (pA \u2212AA)\u2212 vI (2.32)\nsatisfy, thanks to (2.25), (2.27), the Poisson brackets\n{MI ,MJ} = \u2212f KIJ MK . (2.33)\nThe MI are moment maps for a Hamiltonian G-action on the phase space whose infinitesimal version is\n\u03b4\u03bbx A := \u03bbI{xA,MI} = \u03bbIkAI (2.34) \u03b4\u03bbpA := \u03bbI{pA,MI} = (\u2212\u2202AkBI pB + LkIAA)\u03bb I . (2.35)\nSymplectic reduction with respect to the G-action constructs a new phase space which is obtained by quotienting the submanifold on which MI(x, p) = 0 by the G-action (2.35). The reduced phase space is sometimes denoted as\nT \u2217M//G = M\u22121{0}/G. (2.36)\nThe MI = 0 submanifold has dimension 2d \u2212 dg and the G-quotient further reduces the dimension by another dg, so symplectic reduction produces a 2(d\u2212 dg)-dimensional phase space. It is now straightforward to see that the phase space of the gauged sigma model is precisely the reduced phase space M\u22121{0}/G. The canonical Hamiltonian of the gauged sigma model (2.22) is:\nH = Hung + aIMI (2.37) 2More explicitly, one could use the fact that the free group action by G gives M the structure of a principal G-bundle \u03c0 : M \u2192 M/G.

(2.38)\nThese generate the gauge transformations (2.35) on the dynamical variables (xA, pA), while the transformation law (2.23) for the aI is the standard one for Lagrange multipliers, see [32]. Since we are free to redefine the Hamiltonian by combinations of the first class constraints, we can just as well work with\nH \u2032 = H \u2212 aIMI (2.39)\nwhich coincides with the Hamiltonian in the ungauged model (2.31).

(2.47)\nThe fact that it is the vector \u03be\u22a5, rather than \u03be, which appears in the last term of (2.46) will turn out to have important consequences for the conformal invariance conditions in gauged sigma models. Before examining invariance of the action it is useful to work out the constraints imposed by closure of the combined algebra of gauge transformations (2.24) and conformal transformations (2.42), (2.44). This leads to the conditions\nL\u03bekAI = \u2212\u03b3J IkAJ , LkJh I = \u03b3IJ \u2212 fJKIhK , L\u03behI = \u03b3IJhJ .

(2.50)\nNow we turn to the conditions imposed by invariance of the action under conformal transformations (2.42), (2.44). The first order part L(1) is invariant provided that\ni\u03beF = d(hIvI), L\u03bevI = \u2212\u03b3JIvJ (2.51)\nand then transforms by a total derivative\n\u03b4PL (1) = d\ndt\n( PL(1) + P\u0307 (i\u03beA+ hIvI) ) . (2.52)\nDemanding invariance of the second order Lagrangian L(2) fixes the last term in the transformation (2.44) of aI :\nhI = GIJ\u03beAkAJ . (2.53)\nOne checks that hI in (2.53) indeed satisfies (2.48). In addition, conformal invariance imposes the following conditions on the background\nL\u03beGAB = \u2212GAB (2.54)\n\u03be\u22a5A = \u2212 1 2\u2202AK (2.55)\nThe first condition states that \u03be must be a conformal Killing vector, while the second condition requires (the one-form dual to) \u03be\u22a5 to be exact. The definition (2.47) together\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nwith the invariance condition (2.53) implies that \u03be\u22a5 is the projection of \u03be orthogonal the Killing vectors kI :\n\u03beA\u22a5 = P A\u22a5 B\u03beB P A\u22a5 B := \u03b4AB \u2212GIJkIBkAJ . (2.56)\nThe right hand side of (2.55) involves a target space function K(x), which will turn out to play the role of the special conformal Noether charge. We can actually give an explicit expression for K: using (2.26), (2.48), (2.54) and the relation L\u03be\u22a5hI = 0 which follows from them, one shows that\nK = 2\u03be\u22a5A\u03beA\u22a5 (2.57)\nsatisfies (2.55). We note that (2.57) reduces to the standard expression of [17] in the ungauged case. Let us comment more on the condition (2.55), which is required for invariance under special conformal transformations. This condition forms the main generalization brought about by the gauging procedure: in ungauged sigma models, conformal invariance requires the dual of the conformal Killing vector \u03be to be exact, while in the gauged case it is sufficient that this holds for it\u2019s projection \u03be\u22a5 orthogonal to the symmetry orbits. These two conditions are different when the conformal Killing vector is not orthogonal to the symmetry orbits, which from (2.53) is equivalent to the hI being nonzero. Therefore, for nonvanishing hI the target spaceM of the gauged sigma model does not satisfy the standard geometric constraints of [17, 18] and the model is conformally invariant only when gauged. In particular, the ungauged model onM would in this case be scale invariant but not invariant under special conformal transformations. We will discuss explicit examples where hI 6= 0 in section 6.\nIf the conditions (2.54), (2.55) are met, L(2) transforms by a total derivative,\n\u03b4PL (2) = d\ndt ( PL(2) \u2212 12 P\u0308K ) .

(2.66)\nA remark is in order before moving on to the canonical formalism and quantization. As we saw in section (2.2.1), we can equivalently describe the gauged model as a sigma model (with potential term) on the quotient space M/G.

As explained in section 2.2, the phase space variables are (xA, pA) and obey the canonical Poisson brackets\n{xA, pB} = \u03b4AB. (2.70)\nThe effect of the gauging procedure is to subject the system to the first class constraints\nMI = kAI (pA \u2212AA)\u2212 vI \u2248 0. (2.71)\nFrom the transformations (2.59) and variations of the Lagrangian (2.52), (2.58), we compute the conformal Noether charges. These are time-dependent, since the field variations and boundary terms in the variation of the Lagrangian are time-dependent, reflecting the fact that the dilatation and special conformal generators don\u2019t commute with the Hamiltonian. Conservation means in this case that the Noether charges satisfy\n\u2202Q\n\u2202t + {Q,H} = 0. (2.72)\nThe conformal charges evaluated at t = 0 are\nH \u2032 = 12(pA \u2212AA)G AB(pB \u2212AB) (2.73)\nD = \u03bea(pa \u2212Aa)\u2212 hIvI (2.74) K = 2\u03be\u22a5A\u03beA\u22a5. (2.75)\nWe recall from (2.39) that H \u2032 differs from the canonical Hamiltonian by a combination of the constraints. The Poisson brackets between the conformal charges and the constraints are\n{MI , H} = 0 (2.76) {MI , D} = \u2212\u03b3J IMJ (2.77) {MI ,K} = 0 (2.78)\nIn other words, the conformal charges weakly Poisson-commute with the constraints,\n{MI , H \u2032} \u2248 {MI , D} \u2248 {MI ,K} \u2248 0.

(2.82)\nThe Poisson bracket (2.82) shows that, when the hI are non-vanishing, the conformal algebra is satisfied weakly but not strongly, as announced in (2.4). Therefore in this case the model becomes conformally invariant only after symplectic reduction to the MI \u2248 0 surface. This is just the phase-space equivalent of our findings in the Lagrangian language in section 2.3.\nBefore discussing the quantum theory, we would like to comment on the apparent contrast of (2.82) with the algebra of transformations (2.60), where conformal transformations closed among themselves without the need for an additional gauge transformation. The reason for this is that the time translations in (2.60) are generated by the canonical Hamiltonian H in (2.37), which differs from H \u2032 by a combination of the gauge generators. The transformations generated by H \u2032, D,K are therefore a combination of the earlier conformal and gauge tranformations,\n\u03b4\u2032P := \u03b4P + \u03b4\u03bb, where \u03bbI = \u2212uaI .

            "text": "The quantization of the gauged one-dimensional sigma model is well studied. If the gauge group G is compact then there exist two equivalent approaches [32, 33]: (i) as conventional quantization of motion on the quotient M/G or (ii) by first quantizing the motion on M and then restricting the Hilbert space to a subspace which is the common kernel of the quantum generators of G. In this paper we will consider option (ii) and work in a pedestrian approach to Dirac\u2019s quantization method of first-class constraints. We refer the reader to e.g. [32, 33] for a more detailed but also more technical discussion. Some of the subtleties we will encounter can be treated in a more streamlined manner in the BRST formalism. In the spirit of (ii) we first construct operators4 H,K,D,MI acting on a Hilbert space Hlarge so that they realize the operator version of the Poisson bracket relations (2.76)\u2013(2.78) and (2.80)\u2013(2.81). The second step is to perform the quantum analog of the symplectic\n4We will not make a notational distinction between classical observables and quantum operators in this work, hoping that it is clear from the context which is meant.

(2.85)\nIn addition, one has to specify how the inner product on Hphys is obtained from the one on Hlarge. The first step in this procedure is essentially a matter of finding the correct operator ordering. We take our Hilbert space Hlarge to consist of square integrable functions on the target spaceM with respect to the covariant inner product\n(f1, f2) = \u222b ddx \u221a Gf\u22171 f2.

(2.100) So one can conclude that H \u2032, D\u2032 and K are Hermitian operators with respect to (2.86) which form an SL(2,R) algebra on the physical Hilbert space defined as Hphys = \u2229I kerM \u2032I . We note that the new dilatation operator D\u2032 is related to the original one as\nD\u2032 = D \u2212 12(h IMI +MIhI) (2.101)\n= D + i2\u03b3 I I \u2212 hIM \u2032I (2.102)\nThe inner product on the physical Hilbert space takes the general form [32] \u3008f |g\u3009 = \u222b ddx \u221a G \u220f I \u03b4(\u03c7I) det({\u03c7J ,M \u2032K})f\u2217g, (2.103)\nwhere \u03c7I(x) are a suitable set of gauge-fixing functions. This inner product does not depend on the choice of \u03c7I(x). To conclude let us comment on the meaning of the expression (2.97) for the quantum gauge charges M \u2032I . Their action on a wavefunction \u03c8(x) is\niM \u2032I\u03c8 = kAI \u2202A\u03c8 + 1 2f J IJ \u03c8 \u2212 i (ikIA+ vI)\u03c8 (2.104)\nThis expression shows that the wavefunctions are not simply scalars (whose transformation would consist of only the first term), but sections of a certain bundle. More precisely, the second and last terms mean that the wavefunctions transform as densities of weight \u221212 under redefinitions of the Killing vectors kI , and with unit charge under gauge transformations of the field A. By this we mean that under\nx \u2192 x\u2032(x) (2.105) kI \u2192 N JI kJ (2.106) A \u2192 A+ d\u039b (2.107)\n7To obtain these results one has to use fIJKfKLL = 0 and \u03b3IJfIKK = 0 which follow from the Jacobi identity and (2.62) respectively.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nthe wavefunction transforms as\n\u03c8(x)\u2192 \u2223\u2223\u2223detN JI \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 12 ei\u039b\u03c8 (x(x\u2032)) . (2.108)\nRecalling that LkIkJ = f k IJ kK , LkIA = d (ikIA+ vI) , (2.109)\nthe diffeomorphism generated by kI acts on wavefunctions precisely as in (2.104). The fact that the wavefunction is a weight \u221212 density under (2.106) is in fact required for consistency of the reduced inner product (2.103), since the measure transforms as a weight one density. It leads to the shift by i2fIJ\nJ in M \u2032I , which is a generic feature for nonunimodular8 gauge groups G [33]. In the BRST formalism it can be traced back to an ordering ambiguity of the ghosts in the BRST operator which gets resolved by demanding that operator to be nilpotent and Hermitian [32]. The fact that for non-unimodular gauge groups M \u2032I is non-Hermitian with respect to the inner product in the large space (2.86) does not present any physical problem.\n3 Gauged sigma models with osp(1|2) superconformal symmetry\nIn this and the following sections we extend the analysis of conformal invariance to gauged sigma models including fermions and possessing various amounts of supersymmetry. We focus exclusively on models with (N ,N , 0) multiplets, i.e. type B supersymmetry which arises from dimensional reduction of 2-dimensional sigma models with chiral fermions and supersymmetry."

The parameters for the fermionic symmetries can be conveniently combined into a single time dependent parameter\n\u03a3 = + \u03b7t, (3.23)\n11One way to derive this is by demanding that the first order Lagrangian L(1)F is conformally invariant without additional conditions on the background.\n12To show this one has to use the identity that for conformal Killing vector X of weight \u03bb, LX(GAD\u0393DBC) = \u03bbGAD\u0393DBC \u2212GAD\u2202B\u2202CXD.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nwhere is the supersymmetry parameter and \u03b7 parametrizes conformal supersymmetry; both are time-independent.

For a symmetry with parameter \u03c3 under which the Lagrangian transforms as\n\u03b4\u03c3L = d\ndt B\u03c3, (3.34)\nthe expression for the Noether charge, including the fermions, is in our conventions,\n\u03c3Q\u03c3 = iF\u03c3 ( \u2202L\n\u2202x\u0307A \u03b4\u03c3x A + \u2202RL \u2202\u03c7\u0307A \u03b4\u03c3\u03c7 A \u2212B\u03c3\n) , (3.35)\nwhere the subscript R means that the fermionic derivative acts from the right in our conventions. The definition includes a factor i for fermionic symmetries to ensure that Q\u03c3 is real.

(3.43)\nThis reduces to the expression in [17] for ungauged models. The conformal supercharge S could similarly be found by computing the variation of the Lagrangian. A simpler way is to note from (3.31) that it should equal the Poisson bracket of the special conformal and supersymmetry generators:\nS := {K,Q} = \u22122\u03c7A\u03be\u22a5A. (3.44)\nIn the last line, we have used the canonical Poisson/Dirac brackets\n{xA, p\u0303B} = \u03b4AB (3.45) {p\u0303A, \u03c7B} = 0 (3.46) {\u03c7A, \u03c7B} = \u2212i\u03b4AB. (3.47)\nThe last line arises from a Dirac bracket due to the constraint \u03a0A\u2212 i\u03c7A \u2248 0, where \u03a0A := \u2202L/\u2202\u03c7\u0307A (the naive Poisson bracket would give twice the right-hand side). The algebra of transformations (2.24), (2.60), (2.61), (3.31), (3.32) guarantees that the Poisson brackets of the Noether charges (3.39)\u2013(3.39), (3.43), (3.44) weakly form the algebra osp(1|2). As in the bosonic models, we can just as well work with a redefined dilatation charge where we drop the second term in (3.40). This is natural from the point of supersymmetry as it is the latter that arises from the Poisson bracket of the supersymmetry and superconformal charges.\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1"

The operators S and K are free of ordering ambiguities and the classical Noether charges lead directly to (3.55), (3.58). The expression (3.53) for the gauge generators M \u2032I follows from the Noether charge (3.38), with the need for the term proportional to f JIJ explained in section 2.5. Following [17], we have chosen the operator ordering in the supercharge Q in (3.54) such that the result is Hermitian. To show the latter property, one needs (3.50). The properly ordered Hamiltonian H \u2032 and dilatation generator D\u2032 in (3.56), (3.57) are then defined by the superalgebra relations (3.61). We also made use of the following identities\n[\u03a0A, \u03c7B] = i\u0393\u030cBAC\u03c7C (3.65) [\u03a0A,\u03a0B] = \u2212 1 2R\u030cABCD\u03c7 C\u03c7D + iFAB (3.66)\n[\u03a0A, tB1...Bn\u03c7B1 . . . \u03c7Bn ] = \u2212i\u2207\u030cAtB1...Bn\u03c7B1 . . . \u03c7Bn (3.67) [MI , tA1...An\u03c7A1 . . . \u03c7An ] = \u2212iLkI tA1...An\u03c7 A1 . . . \u03c7An (3.68)\nTo verify the algebra osp(1|2) commutation relations, it suffices to check the relations (3.62), the remaining ones then follow from (super-) Jacobi identities.\n4 Gauged sigma models with su(1, 1|1) superconformal symmetry\nIn this section we comment on models with N = 2B super(conformal) symmetry. For the sake of brevity we will focus on a specific class of models that contain an R-symmetry and which furthermore can be extended to the N = 4B models of the next section, but we do point out possibilities for generalizations of which we leave a full classification to further investigation.\nGiven some extra conditions specified below, the supersymmetry of the ungauged Lagrangian (3.3), (3.4) is extended to the N = 2B susy transformations\n\u03b4 ,\u0303x A = \u2212i ( \u03c7A + \u0303JAB\u03c7B ) (4.1)\n\u03b4 ,\u0303\u03c7 A = ( x\u0307A \u2212 \u0303 ( JABx\u0307 B + i\u2202CJAB\u03c7C\u03c7B ))\n(4.2)\nwhere \u0303 = \u0303\u2217 is another real fermionic parameter. Although this is not strictly necessary, we assume the presence of a U(1) R-symmetry as well. Models with N = 2 susy but without such R symmetry exist and satisfy slightly weaker conditions than the ones we\u2019ll derive, see e.g. [23]. Since upon the addition of conformal symmetry the presence of Rsymmetry becomes mandatory we find it convenient to include it from the beginning. The R-symmetry transformation includes an a priori unconstrained vector field \u03c9A (which could in some models be zero) and is more explicitly given by\n\u03b4rx A = \u2212r\u03c9A (4.3)\n\u03b4r\u03c7 A = \u2212r ( \u2202B\u03c9\nA + 12J A B\n) \u03c7B. (4.4)\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nThen the closure of the algebra\n[\u03b4r, \u03b4r] = 0 (4.5)\n[\u03b4r, \u03b4 1,\u03031 ] = \u03b4 2,\u03032 where 2 = \u2212 1 2 \u03031 , \u03032 = 1 2 1 (4.6) [\u03b4 1,\u03031 , \u03b4 2,\u03032 ] = u\u2202t where u = 2i ( 1 2 + \u03031\u03032) (4.7)\nrequires\nJACJ C B = \u2212\u03b4AB, JD [B\u2202|D|JAC] \u2212 JAD\u2202[BJDC] = 0, L\u03c9JAB = 0, (4.8)\nwhere the second condition is the Nijenhuis integrability condition, and hence JAB is an integrable complex structure on the target manifold, with respect to which \u03c9 needs to be holomorphic. Note that invariance under N = 1 supersymmetry together with invariance under R-symmetry guarantees invariance under N = 2 supersymmetry via the algebra. Furthermore, invariance13 of the ungauged model (3.3), (3.4) under the R-symmetry is equivalent to the geometric conditions\nFAC(J)CB + FCB(J)CA = 0, GAC(J)CB +GCB(J)CA = 0, (4.9) L\u03c9GAB = 0, i\u03c9F = 0, (4.10)\n\u2207\u030cAJBC \u2212 L\u03c9CABC = 0, JB [E\u2202ACBCD] = 0. (4.11)\nWe recognize the first line as the requirement of Hermiticity of both the field strength and metric, while the second line demands both the metric and external gauge field strength to be invariant along the vector field \u03c9. Finally the most interesting condition is the first equation in (4.11). First note that by anti-symmetry it implies \u2207\u0302(AJB)C = 0, which is the slightly weaker condition one obtains by requiring only invariance under N = 2 supersymmetry (without R-symmetry), as found in e.g. [17, 23]. In what follows we will restrict attention to the special case\nL\u03c9CABC = 0 \u2207\u030cAJBC = 0 , (4.12)\nThe equality on the right expresses the condition that \u2207\u030c, see (3.6), must be the Bismut14 connection for the Hermitian structure15 (JAB, GAB). The explicit expression for CABC is then given by [35]\nCABC = \u22123JDAJEBJFC\u2207[DJEF ] (4.13)\nNote that in the special case (4.12) the second condition in (4.11) is automatically satisfied. As in the N = 1 case we can proceed and gauge some isometries. The gaugecovariantized supersymmetry transformations are\n\u03b4 ,\u0303x A = \u2212i ( \u03c7A + \u0303JAB\u03c7B ) (4.14)\n\u03b4 ,\u0303\u03c7 A = ( D\u0307tx A \u2212 \u0303 ( JABDtx B + i\u2202CJAB\u03c7C\u03c7B ))\n(4.15) 13The Lagrangian transforms with a total derivative term as given below in (4.22). 14The Bismut connection is the unique connection with totally anti-symmetric torsion tensor preserving a given Hermitian structure, see e.g [35] for a pedagogic discussion. 15More generically, if L\u03c9CABC 6= 0 the first constraint in (4.11) determines the connection \u2207\u030c = \u2207Bismut + B to be some deformation of the Bismut connection, that needs to satisfy L\u03c9BABC = BDA[BJC]D.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nand the gauge-covariantized R-symmetry is given by\n\u03b4rx A = \u2212r\u03c9A (4.16)\n\u03b4ra I = rV IADtxA (4.17)\n\u03b4r\u03c7 A = \u2212r ( \u2202B\u03c9\nA + V IBkAI + 1 2J A B\n) \u03c7B (4.18)\nwhere the deformation upon gauging is captured by the one-forms\nV IA = JBA\u2202BhI .

(4.21)\nThe N = 1B action (2.22), (3.16) remains invariant under these gauge-covariantized N = 2B susy transformations. We check this by deriving that the Lagrangian transforms under the U(1) R-symmetry (4.16), (4.18) as\n\u03b4rL = \u2212r d\ndt (i\u03c9A) (4.22)\nif one imposes the additional constraints:16\n\u2207\u030cAJBC = 0 (4.23) L\u03c9CABC = \u22123V I[ACBC]Dk D I (4.24)\nL\u03c9GAB = \u22122kI(AV IB) (4.25)\ni\u03c9F = vIV IA (4.26) L\u03c9vJ = \u2212kAJ V IAvI (4.27)\nWe see that geometric constraints (4.24)\u2013(4.26) have been slightly deformed compared to their ungauged counterparts (4.10)\u2013(4.11).\n16In case BABC 6= 0 the conditions (4.23), (4.24) get replaced by the weaker condition \u2207\u030cAJBC = L\u03c9CABC + 3V I[ACBC]DkDI .\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nTo summarize, R-symmetry (denoted as (RS) below) leads to the following structures in addition to (2.22)\u2013(2.27), and (3.16)\u2013(3.18)\nRS : \u03b4rxA =\u2212r\u03c9A \u03b4raI = rV IADtxA\n\u03b4r\u03c7 A =\u2212r ( \u2202B\u03c9\nA+V IBkAI + 1 2J A B\n) \u03c7B (4.28)\nA : [\u03b4\u03bb, \u03b4r] = 0\n[\u03b4r, \u03b4 1,\u03031 ] = \u03b4 2,\u03032 +\u03b4\u03bb , 2 = 1 2 \u03031 , \u03032 =\u2212 1 2 1\n[\u03b4 1,\u03031 , \u03b4 2,\u03032 ] =u\u2202t+\u03b4\u03bb , u= 2i( 1 2 + \u03031\u03032) , \u03bbI =\u22122iaI ( 1 2 + \u03031\u03032) (4.29) SC : JACJCB =\u2212\u03b4AB , JD [B\u2202|D|JAC]\u2212JAD\u2202[BJDC] = 0 (4.30)\nLkIJ = 0 [\u03c9,kI ] A = 0 \u2202[AV IB] = 0 (4.31)\nL\u03c9 (J)AB =V ICJCBkAI \u2212V IBJACkCI (4.32) L\u03c9 ( dhI ) A = ( \u2202Ah JV IB\u2212V JA \u2202BhI ) kBJ (4.33)\nGC : 0 =FAC(J)CB+FCB(J)CA (4.34) 0 =GAC(J)CB+GCB(J)CA (4.35)\n\u2207\u030cAJBC = 0 (4.36) L\u03c9CABC =\u22123V I[ACBC]Dk D I (4.37)\nL\u03c9GAB =\u22122kI(AV IB) i\u03c9F = vIV I A (4.38)\nL\u03c9vJ =\u2212kAJ V IAvI (4.39)"

For this it is useful to represent the algebra of canonical (anti-) commutation relations (3.49) on the Hilbert space of antiholomophic differential forms. We start by introducing, for the complex coordinates introduced in (4.58), a unitary frame satisfying em\u0304m = emm\u0304 = 0 and\nGmn\u0304 = emme n\u0304 n\u0304\u03b4mn\u0304 (4.66)\nAny (0, q) form \u03bb(q) can be expanded in the unitary frame as follows:\n\u03bb(q) = 1 q!\u03bbm\u03041...m\u0304qe m\u03041 \u2227 . . . \u2227 em\u0304q (4.67)\nThe inner product on the space of antiholomorphic forms is taken to be\n(\u03ba, \u03bb) = \u2211 q \u222b \u03ba\u0304 m1...mq (q) \u03bb(q)m\u03041...m\u0304q \u221a G|dnz|2 (4.68)\nwhere g \u2261 det{Gmn\u0304}.

(4.75)\nUsing (4.60), (4.64) one then finds that the (super-)conformal charges Q\u2212,S\u2212 and the gauge generators M \u2032I are realized as\nQ\u2212 = \u2202\u0304 + (1 8 \u2202\u0304 ln detG\u2212 iA(0,1) ) \u2227 (4.76)\nS\u2212 = \u2212 i\n2(\u2202\u0304K)\u2227 (4.77)\nM \u2032I = \u2212iLkI \u2212 (ikIA+ vI)\u2212 i\n2f J\nIJ + i\n2(\u2202[n\u0304kp] + k A\u03c9An\u0304p)Gn\u0304p (4.78)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nWe see from (4.76) that the supercharge Q\u2212 is realized as a twisted Dolbeault operator. Its nilpotency follows from the vanishing of F(0,2) which in turn follows from (4.9). This realization (4.78)\u2013(4.77) allows for a differential geometric description of the quantum mechanical Hilbert space. For example, supersymmetric ground states belong to cohomology classes of the twisted Dolbeault operator (4.76). In addition, physical states should be annihilated by the gauge generatorsM \u2032I in (4.78). The Lie derivative term acts within the Hilbert space thanks to the holomorphicity of the kI . As before, the remaining terms in this expression show that the wavefunctions should be seen as sections of an appropriate bundle. The last term signifies an additional transformation by a phase which was absent in the bosonic models; the geometric origin of this phase is a small but interesting question which we leave open at present.\n5 Gauged sigma models with D(2, 1;\u03b1) superconformal symmetry\nIn this section we construct gauged sigma models with N = 4B supersymmetry and derive the conditions for this to be extended to D(2, 1;\u03b1) superconformal symmetry.

(5.10)\nThe first two relations state that the field strength FAB and metric GAB are simultaneously Hermitian with respect to all three complex structures J i. We remark that (5.10) implies that the four-form dC is also Hermitian,\n\u2202[ECBCD](J i)EA = 0, (5.11)\nwhich will be needed below when proving invariance of the action. The last condition (5.10) means that the three different complex structures are covariantly constant with respect to the same torsionful covariant derivative (3.7). The last two conditions (5.9), (5.10) define a weakly hyperK\u00e4hler with torsion (wHKT) manifold [23].\nNow let us consider gaugedN = 4B sigma models where, as before, the fields transform under gauge transformations of the form (2.23) determined by a set of vector fields kI generating a G-action as in (2.25). The closure of the combined algebra of gauge and supersymmetry transformations requires the kI to be tri-holomorphic:\nLkIJ i = 0, i = 1, 2, 3. (5.12)\nOne then shows that, if the conditions18 (2.26), (2.27) for gauging the bosonic Lagrangian are satisfied, the model is invariant under the gauge-covariantized supersymmetry transformations\n\u03b4 x A = \u2212i(J\u03c1)AB \u03c1\u03c7B\n\u03b4 a I = 0\n\u03b4 \u03c7 A = (J\u0304\u03c1)AB \u03c1DtxB + i\u2202C(J\u03c1)AB \u03c1\u03c7C\u03c7B (5.13)\nas well as under R\u0303-symmetries:\n\u03b4r\u0303x A = 0\n\u03b4r\u0303a I = 0\n\u03b4r\u0303\u03c7 A = 12 r\u0303 i(J i)AB\u03c7B. (5.14)\nNote that the gauge fields aI are once again inert under these transformations. 17Requiring invariance only under Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetry (5.2), without imposing the R\u0303-invariance (5.4) leads to a slightly weaker set of conditions spelled out in [23]. 18One can show that the condition LkIC = 0 (see (3.18)) on the fermionic Lagrangian follows from (2.26), (5.12) and the supersymmetry condition (5.10).\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nSummarized, N = 4B supersymmetry and gauge invariance require the following structural (SC) and geometric conditions (GC) on the target space in addition to (2.22)\u2013(2.27) and (3.16)\u2013(3.18)\nSC : (J i)AC(J j)CB = \u2212\u03b4ij\u03b4AB + ijk(Jk)AB, N (J i, J j)ABC = 0 (5.15) LkIJ\ni = 0 (5.16) GC : 0 = FAC(J i)CB + FCB(J i)CA, (5.17)\n0 = GAC(J i)CB +GCB(J i)CA, \u2207\u030cA(J i)BC = 0 (5.18)\n5.2 Conditions for D(2, 1;\u03b1) superconformal invariance\nWe now turn to the conditions for the gauged N = 4B sigma model to be conformally invariant. If these are obeyed we will see that the full symmetry algebra belongs to the oneparameter family of superconformal algebras D(2, 1;\u03b1). These algebras contain a second su(2) R-symmetry, and the value of the parameter \u03b1 will be determined by the transformation of the supercharges under this second set.\nAs we did in the previous sections we first consider the off-shell realization of the symmetry algebra on the fields, independent of the invariance of the Lagrangian. Supersymmetry and gauge transformations require a quaternionic structure J i and Killing vectors kI , and we have seen in section 2.3 that conformal transformations are parametrized in terms of a vector \u03be and functions hI . To display the full algebra of transformations, it is useful to define, with the help of (5.5), vector fields \u03c9A\u03c1 and one forms V \u03c1I A as follows\n\u03c9A\u03c1 = (J\u0304\u03c1)AB\u03beB\u22a5 , \u03c1 = 1, . . . , 4 (5.19) V \u03c1IA = (J \u03c1)BA\u2202BhI . (5.20)\nA rather lengthy analysis of the closure of the full symmetry algebra yields the following conditions on the geometric data in addition to (2.25), (2.62), (2.60), (5.15)\u2013(5.18). First of all, the vector field \u03beA should be triholomorphic:\nL\u03be(J i)AB = 0. (5.21)\nFurthermore, the composite vector fields \u03c9Ai in (5.19) should transform the complex structures as\nL\u03c9i(J j)AB = 1\n1 + \u03b1 ijk(J k)AB + kAI V iIC (J j)CB \u2212 (J j)ACkCI V iIB . (5.22)\nWe note that this transformation law contains the parameter \u03b1 which determines the algebra D(2, 1;\u03b1) that is realized on the fields. A final condition is that the one-forms V iIA should be closed:\n\u2202[AV iI B] = 0. (5.23)\nThe resulting set of fermionic transformations can again be succinctly written in terms of an infinitesimal parameter \u03a3\u03c1 = \u03c1 + \u03b7\u03c1t, where the time-independent Grassmann variables \u03c1, \u03b7\u03c1 parametrize supersymmetry and superconformal transformations respectively.\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nThe fields transform as\n\u03b4\u03a3x A = \u2212i(J\u03c1)AB\u03a3\u03c1\u03c7B (5.24)\n\u03b4\u03a3a I = 2iV \u03c1 IA \u03a3\u0307\u03c1\u03c7 A (5.25)\n\u03b4\u03a3\u03c7 A = (J\u0304\u03c1)AB ( \u03a3\u03c1DtxB + 2\u03a3\u0307\u03c1\u03beB\u22a5 ) + i\u2202C(J\u03c1)AB\u03a3\u03c1\u03c7C\u03c7B (5.26)\nWe note in particular that the gauge fields aI generically transform nontrivially under superconformal transformations. In addition, under commutators of the fermionic transformations a second su(2) Rsymmetry is generated in addition to (5.14). Parametrizing it by three parameters ri the fields transform as\n\u03b4rx A = (1 + \u03b1) ri\u03c9Ai\n\u03b4ra I = \u2212(1 + \u03b1) riV i IA DtxA\n\u03b4r\u03c7 A = (1 + \u03b1) ri ( \u2202B\u03c9 A i + V iIB kAI ) \u03c7B (5.27)\nOur parametrization of two su(2) actions is natural and simple since (5.27) acts geometrically while (5.14) acts only on the fermions. However, these two factors do not commute. Two commuting su(2) factors are generated by \u03b4r+ = \u03b4r\u0303, with ri+ = r\u0303i, and \u03b4r\u2212 = \u03b4r + \u03b4r\u0303, with ri\u2212 = ri = r\u0303i. The transformations (5.24)\u2013(5.27) generate an off-shell realization of a gauged version of the D(2, 1;\u03b1) algebra whose commutators are given in (5.34)\u2013(5.40) below. One furthermore checks that the invariance of the Lagrangian under the transformations above does not impose any geometric conditions on the target space in addition to those required for N = 4B supersymmetry and conformal invariance of the action.19 Summarized, gauged sigma models invariant under D(2, 1;\u03b1) are constructed with the help of the following structures in addition to those listed in (2.22)\u2013(2.27), (2.59)\u2013(2.65), (3.16), (3.29)\u2013 (3.33), (5.15)\u2013(5.18):\nSCS : \u03b4\u03a3xA =\u2212i(J\u03c1)AB\u03a3\u03c1\u03c7B \u03b4\u03a3aI = 2iV \u03c1IA \u03a3\u0307\u03c1\u03c7 A (5.28)\n\u03b4\u03a3\u03c7 A = (J\u0304\u03c1)AB ( \u03a3\u03c1DtxB+2\u03a3\u0307\u03c1\u03beB\u22a5 ) + i\u2202C(J\u03c1)AB\u03a3\u03c1\u03c7C\u03c7B (5.29)\nRS : \u03b4rxA = (1+\u03b1)ri\u03c9Ai \u03b4raI =\u2212(1+\u03b1)riV iIA DtxA (5.30)\n\u03b4r\u03c7 A = (1+\u03b1)ri ( \u2202B\u03c9 A i +V iIB kAI ) \u03c7B (5.31)\nR\u0303S : \u03b4r\u0303xA = 0 \u03b4r\u0303aI = 0 (5.32)\n\u03b4r\u0303\u03c7 A = 12 r\u0303 i(J i)AB\u03c7B (5.33)\nA : [\u03b4r1 , \u03b4r2 ] = \u03b4r3 +\u03b4\u03bb ri3 = ijkr j 1r k 2 ,\n\u03bbI = (1+\u03b1)2 ijkrj1rk2L\u03c9ihI (5.34)\n[\u03b4r\u03031 , \u03b4r\u03032 ] = \u03b4r\u03033 r\u0303i3 =\u2212 ijkr\u0303 j 1r\u0303 k 2 (5.35) [\u03b4r1 , \u03b4r\u03032 ] = \u03b4r\u03033 r\u0303i3 = ijkr j 1r\u0303 k 2 (5.36)\n19One can show that the condition L\u03beC = \u2212C follows from (5.21).\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\n[\u03b4P , \u03b4\u03a31 ] = \u03b4\u03a32 \u03a32\u03c1 =\u2212P \u03a3\u03071\u03c1+ 1 2 P\u0307\u03a31\u03c1 (5.37)\n[\u03b4r, \u03b4\u03a31 ] = \u03b4\u03a32 +\u03b4\u03bb \u03a32\u03c1 = 1 2 ( ji\u2212+ji+ ) \u03c1\u03c3 ri\u03a31\u03c3\n\u03bbI = (1+\u03b1)V iIA ri\u03b4\u03a31xA (5.38)\n[\u03b4r\u0303, \u03b4\u03a31 ] = \u03b4\u03a32 \u03a32\u03c1 =\u2212 1 2(j i +)\u03c1\u03c3\u03a3\u03c3 r\u0303i (5.39)\n[\u03b4\u03a31 , \u03b4\u03a32 ] = \u03b4P +\u03b4r+\u03b4r\u0303+\u03b4\u03bb P = 2i\u03a31\u03c1\u03a32\u03c1\nri = 2i1+\u03b1(j i \u2212)\u03c1\u03c3(\u03a3\u03071\u03c1\u03a32\u03c3\u2212\u03a31\u03c1\u03a3\u03072\u03c3)\nr\u0303i = ( 2\u03b1i\n1+\u03b1j i +\u2212 2i 1+\u03b1j i \u2212 ) \u03c1\u03c3 (\u03a3\u03071\u03c1\u03a32\u03c3\u2212\u03a31\u03c1\u03a3\u03072\u03c3)\n\u03bbI =\u22122i ( aI\u03a31\u03c1\u03a32\u03c1+hI d\ndt (\u03a31\u03c1\u03a32\u03c1)\n) (5.40)\nSC : L\u03be(J i)AB = 0 \u2202[AV iIB] = 0 (5.41)\nL\u03c9i(J j)AB = 1\n1+\u03b1 ijk(J k)AB+kAI V iIC (J j)CB\u2212(J j)ACkCI V iIB (5.42)\nHere, the j\u00b1 denote the (anti-)selfdual \u2019t Hooft symbols given by\n(ji\u00b1)\u00b5\u03bd = \u2213(\u03b4\u00b5i\u03b4\u03bd4 \u2212 \u03b4\u00b54\u03b4\u03bdi)\u2212 i\u00b5\u03bd4.

The algebra can once more be realized on the Hilbert space of antiholomorphic forms as worked out in section 4.4 above. The expressions for the (conformal) supercharges Q\u2212,S\u2212 were already given in (4.78)\u2013(4.77).

The R\u0303-generators realize a standard Lefschetz-like su(2)-action on the space of antiholomorphic forms on quaternionic manifolds [37, 38]. The supersymmetric ground states correspond to elements of the cohomology of the twisted Dolbeault operator (4.76) which are in addition annihilated by R\u0303+. The expression for the gauge charges M \u2032I arises from (4.64) upon using triholomorphicity of the Killing vectors kI , which in particular leads to\n( \u2202[n\u0304kp] +\n1 2k ACn\u0304pA\n) Gn\u0304p = 0. (5.65)\n6 Examples with D(2, 1;\u03b1) superconformal symmetry\nTo illustrate the general discussion of the previous sections, we give an explicit class of nontrivial examples of our construction. In these, N = 4 supersymmetric sigma models acquire D(2, 1;\u03b1) superconformal symmetry upon gauging an isometry group. These examples arise from recasting D(2, 1;\u03b1) models formulated in terms of (3,4,1) multiplets (each containing with three real bosons, 4 real fermions and one auxiliary field) into a more geometric (4,4,0) multiplet description. These models are also physically interesting, as they include as a special subclass the Coulomb branch dynamics of multi-centered D-brane systems which develop an AdS2 throat region. Besides being relevant for the (n)AdS2/(n)CFT1 correspondence these provide an infinite set of examples of our construction possessing D(2, 1; 0) symmetry and with a fully explicit Lagrangian."

In models obtained in this way, the target space coordinates xA are regrouped into quadruples x\u00b5a, where \u00b5 = 1, . . . 4 and a = 1, . . . , n.

The derived objects ha, \u03b3ab, \u03be\u22a5, \u03c9i, V i defined in section 5.2 are found to be\nha = \u03b3x4a, \u03be\u22a5 = \u03b3xia\u2202ia, \u03b3ab = \u03b3\u03b4ab (6.12) \u03c9i = \u2212\u03b3 ijkxja\u2202ka \u2212 \u03b3xia\u22024a , V ia = \u03b3dxia.

In particular, verifying (5.42) one finds that the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b3 are related as\n\u03b3 = 11 + \u03b1. (6.14)\nThe conditions (2.64), (2.66), (3.33) for the action to be D(2, 1;\u03b1)-invariant reduce to\nxjb\u2202jbA4a = \u2212A4a, xjb\u2202jbAia = xjb\u2202iaAjb (6.15) xic\u2202icGab = \u2212(\u03b3\u22121 + 2)Gab, Gabxib = \u2212\u03b3\u2202ia(Gbcxjbxjc), ijkxja\u2202kaGbc = 0 (6.16)\nThe last requirement, which originates from the condition (3.33) on the torsion tensor, imposes a rotational invariance condition on the metric. Since the conformal Killing vector \u03be is not orthogonal to the Killing vectors ka (or, equivalently, the functions ha in (6.12) are nontrivial), if the above conditions are met we obtain nontrivial examples of our construction, where D(2, 1;\u03b1) invariance only appears after gauging, i.e. after reduction to the constraint surface Ma \u2248 0."

In particular, the background electromagnetic fields A4a and Aia take the form of the Coulomb potential and magnetic monopole vector potential felt by the a-th center due to the other centers:\nA4a = \u2212 \u2211 b,b 6=a \u03baab 2rab , Aia = \u2212 \u2211 b,b 6=a \u03baabA D i (x\u0303ab), (6.18)\nwhere ADi is the Dirac monopole vector potential\nADi (x) = ijkn\njxk\n2 r(xlnl \u2212 r) , (6.19)\nwith ni is an arbitrary unit vector indicating the direction of the Dirac string), and we defined\nx\u0303ab = xab = xa \u2212 xb when a < bxba = xb \u2212 xa when a > b. . (6.20) 21One could extend these models to include a background electromagnetic field of the type discussed in\nthe second class of examples.\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nOne verifies that these obey the conditions (6.15) for conformal invariance. The microscopic origin [39] of the parameters \u03baab = \u2212\u03baba is as Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger inner products of the D-brane charges of the centers labelled by a and b. The potential function H from which the metric and torsion are derived through (6.7), (6.3) is given by\nH = \u2212 \u2211\na,b,b 6=a\n|\u03baab| 4rab log rab. (6.21)\nThis second class of examples obeys the conformal invariance conditions (6.16) for \u03b3 = 1, so that the symmetry algebra of these models is D(2, 1; 0), which is isomorphic to the semi-direct product psu(1, 1|2) o su(2). We refer the reader to [5] for a detailed discussion of the symmetries of these models in their (3,4,1) description. Let us also mention that the above quiver models describe the relative motion of the D-branes and are subject to a further constraint imposing the decoupling of the center-of-mass degree of freedom, see again [5] for details."

            "text": "In this work we undertook a systematic study of the constraints imposed by (super) conformal invariance on the geometry of the target space M in gauged sigma models. Our main conclusion was that apart from models that are conformal with or without gauging of isometries, there are also models that only are conformally invariant when gauged. For models of the second type the conditions on the geometry ofM are a deformation of those encountered in ungauged models. This is in particular relevant in the supersymmetric case, whereM exhibits a torsional (hyper) Kahler geometry, which is absent in the formulation of the model onM/G, as obtained after integrating out the gauge fields. In the supersymmetric setting we focused on type B models, where the quantum symmetry algebra has an explicit realization on the Hilbert space of antiholomorphic differential forms. As we illustrated in section 6, the formulation of some models in this geometric language necessarily requires some symmetries to be gauged. An application of, and motivation for, the present work is provided by the Coulomb branch quiver mechanics describing the dynamics D-brane systems in an AdS2 scaling limit. These systems are important due to their connection to (n)AdS2/(n)CFT1 and black hole physics. A first step [40] would be to use our formulation to study the explicit Hilbert space and it\u2019s D(2, 1;\u03b1) content in the simplest examples discussed in section 6. More generally, it would be of great interest to learn more about the quantum Hilbert space through an appropriate superconformal index (see [41] for the D(2, 1;\u03b1) algebra) and to develop localization methods for its computation. An especially interesting question in our view is whether the model contains any singlet ground states under the full superconformal symmetry, which would be candidate microstates dual pure AdS2 in the picture of [6]. From our representation of the conformal generators it is clear that singlet states can exist only under very special circumstances. Indeed, the special conformal generator K = 2(\u03be\u22a5)2 can only annihilate a state if it\u2019s wavefunction has support on the fixed\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 1\nlocus of the vector \u03be\u22a5. This is essentially what happens in the N = 4 \u2018type A\u2019 models with hyperk\u00e4hler target spaces [42, 43], which were shown to contain conformal singlet ground states. In these models, the \u03be\u22a5 fixed locus is singular and the result requires a supersymmetry-preserving resolution of this singularity. It would be interesting to see if a similar mechanism can occur in the type B models considered in this work. Finally let us remark that it would be interesting to investigate a possible role of the \u2018radial-angular\u2019 split of (super)conformal mechanics, see e.g. [44\u201346] , in the considerations above."
