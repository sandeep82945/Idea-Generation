    "abstractText": "Active noise control (ANC) has been widely utilized to reduce unwanted environmental noise. The primary objective of ANC is to generate an anti-noise with the same amplitude but the opposite phase of the primary noise using the secondary source. However, the effectiveness of the ANC application is impacted by the speaker\u2019s output saturation. This paper proposes a two-gradient direction ANC algorithm with a momentum factor to solve the saturation with faster convergence. In order to make it implemented in real-time, a computation-effective variable step size approach is applied to further reduce the steady-state error brought on by the changing gradient directions. The time constant and step size bound for the momentum two-gradient direction algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in the time-unvaried and time-varied environment.",

            "text": "Index Terms\u2014 Active noise control (ANC), output saturation, two-gradient direction, momentum ANC, variable step size\n1. INTRODUCTION\nActive noise control (ANC) is commonly employed to reduce ambient noise [1\u201313]. In a single-channel feedforward ANC system, a reference microphone and an error microphone are used to pick up the reference and error signals. The collected signals are used to generate the control signal played back by the secondary source [14\u201316]. Output saturation occurs when the maximum output power of the ANC system exceeds the secondary source\u2019s driving capacity. The noise reduction performance will degrade once the driving signal of the ANC system surpasses the threshold of output saturation, and the secondary source\u2019s inherent nonlinearity could result in the adaptive algorithm divergence throughout the noise reduction process [17, 18].\nThere is a recent interest in adapting the control filter, yet not over-driving the sound level in several practical ANC application [19, 20]. A bilinear filtered-X least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm is utilized to reduce the distortion of signal saturation [21]. The bilinear filters employing feedforward and feedback polynomials have the same input-output equation as IIR filters, which accurately model the nonlinear output. Nevertheless, the bilinear algorithm raises the computational requirements when implementing feedforward, feedback, and the cross coefficient for the control filters. A filter bank-based functional link artificial neural network structure [22] is tuned using a particle swarm optimization approach without secondary path training. A rescaling approach is utilized to reduce the output signal and regulate filter coefficients [23, 24]. The application of the two-gradient (2GD) algorithm [20] depends on whether the control signal\u2019s power exceeds the output power constraint. If the control signal falls within the constraint, the weights of\nthe control filter update using the same method as the FXLMS algorithm. However, if the control signal violates the output constraints, the gradient direction switches, causing the weights to bounce off the boundary and reduce the output power. The oscillation brought on by the varying gradient increases the steady-state error, and a variable step size strategy is utilized to reduce it. However, the small step size (determined by the variable step size strategy) leads the ANC algorithm to converge slowly, especially in a time-varied environment. In this paper, we apply a momentum mechanism [25, 26] to the 2GD-FXLMS with variable step size and examine the time constant and step size bounds in two directions for the proposed approach.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes the momentum two-gradient (2GD-Momentum) algorithm with variable step size and analyzes the convergence performance with step size bounds and time constant. Sections 3 presents simulation results. Section 4 concludes this paper.\n2. PROPOSED METHOD\nIn this section, the 2GD-Momentum technique with variable step size for output-constrained ANC is proposed. Fig.1 shows the block diagram of the proposed method implemented with a feedforward ANC structure. The error signal e(n) is the acoustic summation of the disturbance and the anti-noise, which is formed by the control signal y(n) passing through the secondary path s(n).\ne(n) = d(n)\u2212 y(n) \u2217 s(n), (1) where \u2217 denotes linear convolution. The control signal y(n) is the output of control filter W (z):\ny(n) = w(n)x(n), (2)\nwhere w(n) is the coefficients of the feedforward control filter W (z) with Lf taps. x(n) denotes the reference signal vector. To solve the output-saturation issue caused by the secondary source, the 2GD-FXLMS algorithm has been developed previously [25]. The maximum output power of the secondary source is defined at \u03c12, and the coefficients of the control filter are updated as\nw(n+ 1) =\n{ w(n) + \u00b51(n)e(n)x \u2032(n), E [ y2(n) ] \u2264 \u03c12\nw(n)\u2212 \u00b52y(n)x(n), E [ y2(n) ] > \u03c12 (3)\nwhere \u00b51(n) and \u00b52 represent the step sizes. x\u2032(n) denotes the reference signal x(n) filtered by the secondary path estimated as s\u0302(n)\nx\u2032(n) = x(n) \u2217 s\u0302(n). (4)\nHowever, the unappropriated step size selection will cause serious weight oscillation when alternative updating control filter. To alleviate the weight error, a variable step size strategy is applied\n\u00b51(n+ 1) =\n{ \u00b51(n), E [ y2(n) ] \u2264 \u03c12\nmin [\u03b3\u00b51(n), \u00b5min] , E [ y2(n) ] > \u03c12 (5)\nwhere \u03b3 and \u00b5min represent the common ratio and smallest step size. Once E [ y2(n) ] > \u03c12, the step size changes to \u00b52, which is determined by \u00b51(n) \u00b52 = \u03c2\u00b51(n), (6)\nwhere \u03c2 denotes the Lagrangian factor obtained from\n\u03c2 = Gs(\u03b7 \u2212 1), (7)\nwhere Gs denotes the power gain of the secondary path, which is modeled offline. \u03b7 is the system non-linearity given by\n\u03b72 = max\n( \u03c32d\nGs\u03c12 , 1\n) , (8)\nwhere \u03b42d represents the power of disturbance d(n), and max(\u00b7) returns the maximum value of the inputs.\nIn this situation, the algorithm would gradually reduce the power of the control signal until it falls within the output constraint. However, the reduced step size will undoubtedly affect the convergence behavior when the algorithm updates along the first gradient direction, which would become more serious when the acoustic environment changes. Therefore, we bring the momentum factor in the weight updating equation to accelerate the convergence:\nw(n+ 1) =\n{ w(n) + \u03b6(n), E [ y2(n) ] \u2264 \u03c12\nw(n)\u2212 \u00b52y(n)x(n), E [ y2(n) ] > \u03c12\n(9)\nwhere \u03b6(n) denotes the momentum factor\n\u03b6(n+ 1) = \u03ba\u03b6(n) + \u00b51(n)e(n)x \u2032(n), (10)\nwhere \u03ba is the forgetting factor. By involving the momentum technique, the accumulation effect can somehow compensate for the reduced gradient value caused by the variable step size, improving the algorithm\u2019s convergence speed."

CONCLUSION\nThe two-gradient FXLMS algorithm was a practical solution to overcome the output saturation issue in adaptive ANC systems and increase system stability. However, its weight oscillation caused by\ngradient switching progress influenced the noise reduction performance. This paper applied the momentum two-gradient direction algorithm with variable step size to output-constrained ANC. The momentum factor, along with the variable step size approach, was added to reduce the weight oscillation brought on by the twogradient method and speed up convergence in a time-varied environment. The analysis of the two-gradient method\u2019s step size bounds and time constant demonstrated its accessibility and enhanced convergence capabilities. According to the simulation results, the proposed approach had an advantage in terms of convergence speed and a decreased vibration effect on weight changes for the two-gradient step size.\n5.
