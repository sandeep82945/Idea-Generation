Three images of immunostaining for PKH26, p-ERK and Merge in the co-culture transwell experiment (2nd row, 4th column, 5th column, 6th column) from the ARP1 cell line were misrepresented as the CAG cell line. The authors corrected the error with representative images of PKH26, p-ERK and Merge in CAG cells from the original experiments. Correspondingly, the quantitative results for the CAG cell line in Figure 6D were revised based on the replaced images. The presented corrections do not affect the results or conclusions of this article. The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused.",
