    "abstractText": "We searched for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background in the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array, a global collaboration synthesizing decadal-length pulsar-timing campaigns in North America, Europe, and Australia. In our reference search for a power law strain spectrum of the form hc = A(f/1 yr \u22121)\u03b1, we found strong evidence for a spectrally-similar low-frequency stochastic process of amplitude A = 3.8 \u22122.5\u00d710 and spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.5\u00b10.5, where the uncertainties represent 95% credible regions, using information from the autoand cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in the array. For a spectral index of \u03b1 = \u22122/3, as expected from a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries, the recovered amplitude is A = 2.8 \u22120.8 \u00d7 10\u221215. Nonetheless, no significant evidence of the Hellings-Downs correlations that would indicate a gravitational-wave origin was found. We also analyzed the constituent data from the individual pulsar timing arrays in a consistent way, and clearly demonstrate that the combined international data set is more sensitive. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this combined data set produces comparable constraints to recent single-array data sets which have more data than the constituent parts of the combination. Future international data releases will deliver increased sensitivity to gravitational wave radiation, and significantly increase the detection probability.",

In our reference search for a power law strain spectrum of the form hc = A(f/1 yr\n\u22121)\u03b1, we found strong evidence for a spectrally-similar low-frequency stochastic process of amplitude A = 3.8+6.3\u22122.5\u00d710\u221215 and spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.5\u00b10.5, where the uncertainties represent 95% credible regions, using information from the auto- and cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in the array. For a spectral index of \u03b1 = \u22122/3, as expected from a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries, the recovered amplitude is A = 2.8+1.2\u22120.8 \u00d7 10\u221215. Nonetheless, no significant evidence of the Hellings-Downs correlations that would indicate a gravitational-wave origin was found. We also analyzed the constituent data from the individual pulsar timing arrays in a consistent way, and clearly demonstrate that the combined international data set is more sensitive. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this combined data set produces comparable constraints to recent single-array data sets which have more data than the constituent parts of the combination. Future international data releases will deliver increased sensitivity to gravitational wave radiation, and significantly increase the detection probability.\nKey words: gravitational waves \u2014 pulsars:general \u2014 supermassive back holes \u2014 methods: data analysis \u2014 methods: statistical techniques\n?

            "text": "Inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with masses larger than 107M are expected to generate the strongest gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the Universe. The incoherent superposition of all of these inspiralling SMBHBs should generate a stochastic GW background (GWB) that is the strongest in the nanohertz frequency band (e.g., Rajagopal & Romani 1995; Jaffe & Backer 2003; Sesana et al. 2008; Burke-Spolaor et al. 2019). Other sources that could also produce a stochastic background in the nanohertz band are cosmic strings (e.g., O\u0308lmez et al. 2010), cosmological phase transitions, and a primordial background produced by quantum fluctuations in the gravitational field in the early universe (e.g., Grishchuk 2005; Lasky et al. 2016). For comparison, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo Collaboration, which are terrestrial GW detectors and have detected GWs from merging stellar mass black holes and neutron stars (e.g., Abbott et al. 2019, 2021), are only sensitive to GW signals that are ten orders of magnitude higher in frequency than PTAs.\nA nanohertz GWB can be detected using a precisely timed ensemble of millisecond pulsars (Sazhin 1978; Detweiler 1979), called a pulsar timing array (PTA, Foster & Backer 1990). The GWs distort the space-time between the Earth and pulsars, changing their proper distance, thereby leading to a measurable deviation of the pulsar pulse arrival times. Since such effects cannot be detected with confidence using only one pulsar, PTAs leverage the imprint of spatially-correlated timing deviations between pulsars which are separated by kiloparsec distances across the galaxy, yet are subject to the common influence of the GWB.\nAn isotropic GWB manifests itself as a long timescale, low-frequency (or red) common signal across the pulsars in a PTA. This common signal is characterized by the common spectrum and the inter-pulsar spatial correlations. For an isotropic GWB these spatial correlations are unique, referred to as the Hellings & Downs (1983) (HD) correlations, and thus are considered to be the \u201csmoking gun\u201d signature for the presence of a GWB (Tiburzi et al. 2016) in any PTA data set. The spectral amplitude of this common signal is determined by the characteristic strain, hc(f), of the GWB, which itself is a function of the physics sourcing the GWB (e.g., SMBHB masses, merger timescale, and number density) (e.g., Sesana 2013a; Kelley et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019). Thus, precise spectral characterization of the GWB will allow us to extract the underlying astrophysics of the background, as well as distinguish between different sources of the GWB (e.g., Pol et al. 2021).\nThe ability to detect GWs relies on, among other things, the number of pulsars available to cross-correlate in GWB searches, and on the length of each pulsar data set (Siemens et al. 2013). Improvements in both of these parameters increases the detection significance of the GWB signal which in turn allows for better constraints on the parameters of the GWB spectrum (Pol et al. 2021). Hence, international efforts spanning decades from the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA, Desvignes et al. 2016), North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav, Arzoumanian et al. 2016), and the Parkes Pulsar Timing array (PPTA, Manchester et al. 2013), as well as newer PTAs\nsuch as the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA, Joshi et al. 2018), Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA, Lee 2016), and with the MeerKAT Interferometer in South Africa (Bailes et al. 2020) share and combine their data to form the International PTA (IPTA, Hobbs et al. 2010).\nIn this spirit of international collaboration the IPTA has produced two data sets to date. The first IPTA data release (DR1, Verbiest et al. 2016) consisted of 44 millisecond pulsars and yielded no conclusive detection of a GWB. The second IPTA data release (DR2, Perera et al. 2019) consists of 65 pulsars and is the focus of this analysis. The pulsars in DR2 have data sets spanning 0.5\u2212 30 years. For the first time, we process the data subsets from each individual PTA and search for a GWB in a self-consistent way, thus enabling us to make a fair comparison of respective PTA constraints.\nRecently, a spatially uncorrelated (pulsar-weightedaverage) spectrally similar common process or commonspectrum process (CP) was detected in the NANOGrav 12.5- year data set (Arzoumanian et al. 2020), the second data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (Goncharov et al. 2021a), and the EPTA six-pulsar data set of the second data release (Chen et al. 2021b). The process is modeled as an additional time-correlated term with the same power spectrum in all of the pulsars. However, there is little evidence to support the existence of spatial HD correlations in any of these data sets. We compare the IPTA DR2 constraints on the GWB with those obtained from these analyses.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we give an overview of the second IPTA data release, hereafter referred to as DR2. We describe our data analysis methods in Section 3, and give our results in Section 4. Caveats and implications of our analysis and results are discussed in Section 5, including the astrophysical interpretation of a potential GWB. The conclusion is given in Section 6."

The EPTA data set includes high-precision timing data from 42 MSPs obtained with the largest radio telescopes in Europe \u2013 Effelsberg telescope, Lovell telescope, Nanc\u0327ay telescope, and Westerbork Synthesis telescope \u2013 covering data from 1996 to 2015 with a time baseline between 7\u201318 yr. In addition to these data, archival timing data of PSR J1939+2134 since 1994 was included. The NANOGrav 9-year data set includes high-precision timing observations from 37 MSPs obtained with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and the Arecibo telescope, spanning a time baseline between 0.6\u20139.2 yr, covering the data from 2004 to 2013. In addition, the long-term timing data of PSR J1713+0747 from Zhu et al. (2015) and the data of PSRs J1857+0943 and J1939+2134 from 1984 through 1992 (Kaspi et al. 1994) were included. The PPTA data set includes high-precision timing observations from 20 MSPs obtained with the Parkes radio telescope (also known as Murriyang) from 2004 to 2011. IPTA DR2 also included single frequency band (1.4 GHz/L-band) Parkes telescope\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nlegacy data obtained since 1994. The additional 3.0 GHz timing data reported in Shannon et al. (2015) for PSRs J0437\u22124715, J1744\u22121134, J1713+0747, and J1909\u22123744 were also included in the data set. In total, the timing data from 65 MSPs were included in IPTA DR2, which has 21 more source than the IPTA DR1 (Verbiest et al. 2016). There are 27 and 7 MSPs in IPTA DR2 with a timing baseline >10 yr and >20 yr, respectively. All pulsars were observed at multiple frequencies. All EPTA and PPTA observations were averaged in time and frequency to obtain a single time-of-arrival (TOA) for each receiver and observation. The NANOGrav observations were averaged in time and included sub-band information, i.e., averaged in frequency to maintain a frequency resolution ranging from 1.5 to 12.5 MHz depending on the receiver and backend instrument combination, resulted in a single TOA for each frequency channel. More details about the constituent PTA data sets can be found in Perera et al. (2019).\nThe different data sets for a given pulsar in IPTA DR2 were combined by fitting for time offsets, referred to as JUMPs, in the timing model to account for any systematic delays between data sets. The highest weighted data set with the lowest sum of TOA uncertainties was used as the reference data set in this process. The timing models of pulsars included astrometric parameters, rotational frequency information, dispersion measure information, and Keplerian and Post-Keplerian parameters if the pulsar is in a binary system. For NANOGrav observed pulsars, \u201cFD\u201d parameters were included to minimize the effect of frequency-dependent profile variations of pulsars (see Arzoumanian et al. 2015). IPTA DR2 produced two data set versions depending on different methods of handling the dispersion measures (DM) variations of pulsars over time (VersionA and VersionB \u2013 see Perera et al. 2019, for details). In VersionA, the DM variations of pulsars were determined using DMMODEL described in Keith et al. (2013) and the noise parameters for different data sets were directly taken from their original data releases. In VersionB, the DM variations were modeled using the first two time derivatives of the DM and a timecorrelated stochastic DM process in the timing model. The noise parameters were also re-estimated based on the new IPTA data combination in this version. We use VersionB for this work."

The multivariate Gaussian likelihood L(\u03b4t|\u03b8) is employed to model noise and signal contributions, parametrised by \u03b8, to the observed timing residuals. Our likelihood was of the same form as other PTA analyses, (e.g., Arzoumanian et al. 2015). We used enterprise (Ellis et al. 2020) to evaluate the likelihood and priors, and PTMCMCSampler (Ellis & van Haasteren 2017) to perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, drawing samples from the posterior probability distribution. Model selection was performed via the product-space sampling method (Carlin & Chib 1995; Hee et al. 2016).

            "text": "For each pulsar, we modeled the TOAs with a combination of four processes: the timing model, white noise, intrinsic red noise, and DM variations. Deterministic contributions from the timing model, described in Section 2, were analytically marginalised (van Haasteren et al. 2009). The time-uncorrelated white noise was modeled with EFAC and EQUAD, and ECORR parameters for NANOGrav pulsars with their sub-banded TOAs (definitions of EFAC, EQUAD, and ECORR can be found in, e.g., Verbiest et al. 2016; Perera et al. 2019). Every observing receiver and backend system combination is given its own set of white noise parameters. The time-correlated red noise process (e.g., pulsar spin noise, Shannon & Cordes 2010) and stochastic DM variations (Keith et al. 2013) were modeled as Fourier basis Gaussian processes. In each case Fourier spectrum coefficients were modeled as power laws,\nPRN(f) = ARN\n2\n12\u03c02 f\u22123yr\n( f\nfyr\n)\u2212\u03b3RN , (1)\nPDM(f, \u03bd) = ADM\n2\n12\u03c02 f\u22123yr\n( f\nfyr )\u2212\u03b3DM (1400MHz \u03bd )2 , (2)\nwhere A is the power law amplitude, \u03b3 its spectral index, and fyr = 1 yr\n\u22121 \u2248 3.17\u00d7 10\u22128 Hz. The difference between these two processes lies in the radio frequency \u03bd dependence. Intrinsic red noise is achromatic, i.e., frequency independent, while DM variations follow a \u03bd\u22122 dependence (e.g., Lentati et al. 2016).\nDespite all MSPs in IPTA DR2 exhibiting high rotational stability, such that the marginalized timing model, red, and DM noise terms are in general sufficient, certain pulsars have been found to experience timing events that need to be included in their data model. Of interest to this analysis is PSR J1713+0747, which was observed to experience multiple sudden drops in apparent DM with an exponential recovery (Demorest et al. 2013; Lam et al. 2018; Goncharov et al. 2021b). Only the first such event lies within the timespan of the IPTA DR2 and was included as an additional deterministic term to the full noise model of PSR J1713+0747. The amplitude, epoch and recovery time scale of the DM exponential dip are sampled simultaneously with the pulsar red and DM noise terms.\nLentati et al. (2016) found additional sources of red noise in IPTA DR1. These include radio frequency banddependent and observing system-dependent terms, which may affect measurements of PRN and PDM, if not modeled. It is possible that mismodeling these effects can bias recovery of the CP. More prescriptive models for the CP should be less affected by this bias. Recent PTA analyses have included more complex red noise and DM variation models, where different pulsars in the array use different models (e.g., Aggarwal et al. 2019; Goncharov et al. 2021b). In the name of computational efficiency we opted to use the same power law models for all pulsars except when absolutely necessary, as is the case for PSR J1713+0747.\nIPTA DR2, being the combination of data from multiple telescopes and many observing systems, has larger model\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nparameter space than its constituent data sets. The large number of model parameters and TOAs increases the computational complexity of the analysis. As we searched for long-term processes, such as the GWB, we limited our analysis to pulsars whose observation time exceeded 3 years. This reduced the number of pulsars from the full 65 in DR2 to 53. Additionally, we fixed the white noise parameters (EFAC, EQUAD, and ECORR) to median aposteriori values from single pulsar analyses. Both of these choices reduced the analysis parameter space to a more manageable size."

            "text": "In addition to modeling noise intrinsic to the individual pulsars, we also include a red CP that is present in all of the pulsars. The source of this process could be the GWB, or any other common noise that manifests itself in all pulsars, such as clock errors (Caballero et al. 2016; Hobbs et al. 2020) or errors in the Roemer delays from Solar-system ephemeris (SSE) systematics (Tiburzi et al. 2016; Vallisneri et al. 2020). The choice of red noise priors also affects the recovery of a CP due to covariance between pulsar intrinsic red noise and the CP (Hazboun et al. 2020b; Goncharov et al. 2021a). Each of these effects can be distinguished by a unique pattern of spatial cross-correlations between pulsars. The cross-power spectral density is defined as,\nSab(f) = \u0393abPCP(f) , (3)\nwhere PCP is the common-spectrum process and \u0393ab is the overlap reduction function (ORF) describing the inter-pulsar correlations.\nFor some analyses we did not account for any interpulsar correlations, taking \u0393ab = \u03b4ab to be the identity matrix. For others, we also included different choices of nondiagonal ORFs, such as the quadrupolar Hellings & Downs (1983) correlations that describe a GWB, dipolar correlations associated with SSE errors, or monopolar correlations, \u0393ab = 1, associated with clock errors. In some cases we split the diagonal auto-correlation part of the ORF from the offdiagonal cross-correlation part, treating them as independent processes as a consistency check. When modeling the CP using only the auto-correlations, it is possible to analyze the data from each pulsar independently, then recombine the results to achieve a joint posterior on the CP. We refer to this as the factorized likelihood approach.\nWe modeled the CP using a Fourier basis Gaussian process, using basis frequencies f = 1/T, 2/T, . . ., where T is the timespan between the earliest and latest observation in the data set. We model the power spectrum of the CP as a power law using Eqn. (1), replacing the pulsar noise amplitude and spectral index with those from the common process ACP and \u03b3CP. In this parameterization of the power spectrum the characteristic strain spectrum for the GWB is\nhc(f) = ACP\n( f\nfyr\n)(3\u2212\u03b3CP)/2 . (4)\nIn some cases we fixed \u03b3CP = 13/3, equivalent to \u03b1 = (3 \u2212 \u03b3CP)/2 = \u22122/3, the expected spectrum for a GWB composed of circular supermassive binary black holes (Phinney 2001), and in others we left \u03b3CP as a free parameter. To determine the number of Fourier frequencies used in the\npower law CP model, we fit the power spectrum with a broken power law model. The broken power law is the sum of the standard, red power law and a white spectrum. This is implemented as a single spectrum with a fixed spectral index at low frequencies that smoothly transitions into a flat, white noise dominated spectrum at high frequencies:\nP (f) = ACP\n2\n12\u03c02 f\u22123yr\n( f\nfyr\n)\u2212\u03b3CP [ 1 + ( f\nfbend\n)1/\u03ba]\u03ba \u03b3CP ,\n(5) where fbend is the frequency where the spectral index of the power spectrum changes and \u03ba controls the smoothness of the transition. In this model P (f) \u223c f\u2212\u03b3CP for f fbend, and P (f) constant for f fbend. As a verification of our power law models, we performed a free spectral analysis, where the power at each frequency is fit independently rather than being constrained by a particular spectral shape, P (f)."

As the cross-terms, which come from the inter-pulsar correlations, are the defining feature of the GWB, we insist on their presence in order to confidently claim a detection. However, the auto-correlations are initially the dominant source of information, especially for spectral parameter estimation, and the detection of power in them is considered to be the first hint of a GWB (Romano et al. 2021).

            "text": "To begin, we apply a free spectral model for the CP, measuring the amount of power at each sampling frequency independently, up to 30 frequency bins, the result of which is shown in the top panel of Figure 1. The common red noise power can be converted into GW strain using Eqn. (4). This alternative representation of the IPTA DR2 analysis can be found in the lower panel of Figure 1. For reference, we include the predicted sensitivity curve, made using hasasia (Hazboun et al. 2019a,b) and the measured white noise parameters of the DR2 data set. Note that the noise power spectral density used in this curve only contains TOA errors, EFAC, EQUAD and ECORR, and does not contain any estimates for the red noise, as for many pulsars it is difficult, and in fact the point of this analysis, to disentangle intrinsic red noise from a GWB. Hence the low-frequency end of the sensitivity represents a \u201cbest case\u201d scenario for comparison. The lowest frequency bin corresponds to the longest timespan, and only two pulsars, J1939+2134 (29 yr) and J1857+0943 (28 yr), have observation baselines suffi-\ncient to probe this frequency. However, both have significant RN with spectral indices \u223c 3.3 (Perera et al. 2019). Therefore, it is not surprising that we do not confidently detect any power there, evidenced by the wide tail extending to low power and median of \u223c 10\u22127 s. However, the second, third, fifth, and eighth frequency bins show power well above the expected sensitivity of IPTA DR2. This could either be the emergence of a GWB or some other unmodeled noise process.\nThe CP power spectrum can be modeled with a simple power law using Eqn. (1). Arzoumanian et al. (2020) have shown that the choice of the number of modeled frequencies can affect the constraints on the power law amplitude and spectral index. Thus, we apply the broken power law model from Eqn. (5) to find the optimal number of frequency bins for the analysis. Figure 2 shows the marginalized posterior on the bend frequency. We can identify a clear peak at the 13th frequency in N/T , corresponding to a frequency of 1.4\u00d7 10\u22128 Hz, indicated by the orange dashed line. For the remainder of this work, we will limit the search to use only the lowest 13 frequencies with the simple power law model. This produces constraints equivalent to an analysis using the broken power law, but in a simpler and computationally efficient way.\nWe have also verified that the addition of the BAYESEPHEM SSE model (Vallisneri et al. 2020) to the analysis does not change our results significantly from an analysis that fixed the SSE to DE438. The nearly 30 years of timespan allows for the separation of the SSE effects from other correlated signals (Vallisneri et al. 2020). For simplicity, we will only show results with DE438, unless stated otherwise.\nFigure 3 compares the results when using two different ORFs. The model that uses only the auto-correlation terms, which we denote CP in Table 1, is very strongly favored over a model with only intrinsic pulsar noise and no common-spectrum process with log10 Bayes factor of 8.2. Despite the large Bayes factor in favor of the CP, this does not suffice to claim a GWB detection, as we have only used the auto-correlations. This strong evidence only indicates that a number of pulsars have red noise with similar spectral characteristics. We must turn to the cross-correlations\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nto determine if this CP is HD correlated as a GWB should be. Using the full HD ORF containing both auto- and crosscorrelations, we find only middling evidence in favor of the auto+cross HD model. The log10 Bayes factor for the full HD model compared to the auto-correlated only CP is 0.3, as shown in Table 1.\nFigure 3a shows the 2D posterior contours of these two models are in relatively good agreement. A small shift towards lower amplitudes and higher spectral index can be seen when using the full HD ORF with both auto- and crosscorrelations. Using the auto-correlation terms only, we find ACP = 5.1 +6.7 \u22123.1\u00d710\u221215 and \u03b3CP = 3.9\u00b10.9, where the errors represent 95% credible regions. Using the full HD ORF we can constrain the CP power law to ACP = 3.8 +6.3 \u22122.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 and \u03b3CP = 4.0\u00b1 0.9. When we fix the power spectrum index to \u03b3 = 13/3 as shown in Figure 3b, it is clear that full HD model finds a systematically lower amplitude. In this case we find an am-\nplitude of ACP = 3.2\u00b1 1.0\u00d7 10\u221215 for the auto-correlation only analysis and an amplitude of ACP = 2.8 +1.2 \u22120.9 \u00d7 10\u221215 using the full HD ORF, where the uncertainties represent the 95% credible regions. These results are in broad agreement with published constraints on the CP. A more detailed comparison can be found in Section 4.3.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)"

            "text": "Similar to how we may consider the auto-correlation parts of the ORF alone, the full ORF can be split into two independent processes. In this case the auto-correlation and the cross-correlation parts each have their own independent amplitude, as was done in Arzoumanian et al. (2020). In the HD ORF the auto-correlation part is \u0393aa = 1 and the crosscorrelation parts are suppressed by at least a factor of 2, \u0393ab < 0.5. This makes the cross-correlations harder to constrain. Figure 4 shows the posteriors for the two amplitudes of a split ORF analysis for fixed \u03b3 = 13/3, compared to the full auto+cross-correlation model. The cross-correlations do not have sufficient precision to place constraints on the amplitude of the GWB. However, they do place a 95% upper limit of 3.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 on the GWB when the prior choice is taken into account. This is consistent with the amplitude derived using the full auto- and cross-correlation model in Fig. 4. The auto-correlation terms are much more informative. Combining the information from both shifts the amplitude towards lower values. This shows that the cross-terms can contribute to the full GWB search, even if they provide less information. The auto-correlations are more likely to be affected by intrinsic pulsar noise. Using a more sophisticated noise model for each pulsar can help produce a more robust estimate on the amplitude of any CP."

            "text": "Figure 5 shows the amplitudes and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) that are recovered by the pulsar noise marginalized optimal statistic (OS) method, which uses cross-correlations only. We find no evidence for a dipolar correlated process, as the amplitude and S/N for this model are centered on 0. SSE systematics are expected to manifest at specific frequencies related to the celestial bodies. The IPTA DR2 data set is long enough to probe lower frequencies that should be less affected by SSE errors (Vallisneri et al. 2020). The S/N = 0.6+1.2\u22120.8 for the Hellings-Downs correlation is insufficient to claim a detection. This is consistent with the Bayesian model selection. The HD amplitude from the OS seems to be in tension with the Bayesian results for the auto-correlated CP, but consistent with the Bayesian results for the full HD model. This strengthens the case that the cross-terms have a significant role to play in parameter estimation as well as detection confidence. Finally, the OS has the largest S/N = 2.0+1.8\u22121.4 for a monopole with a small amplitude. This can be due to the complexity of IPTA DR2 and some amount of unmodeled noise.\nAs the spatial correlations are not well constrained, see Figure 6, both the HD and monopolar correlation can fit the data. We have binned pulsar pairs according to their angular separation. Increasing the number of pulsars in the array as well as better timing of pulsars can help to tighten the constraints.\nWe test the significance of the OS S/N by performing two analyses which estimate the false alarm rate for a given S/N. So called phase-shifts and sky scrambles (Cornish & Sampson 2016; Taylor et al. 2017) break the correlations between the pulsars leaving the red noise power in the pulsars, but removing evidence for spatial correlations. By analyzing the phase-shifted and sky scrambled data we can determine the rate of observing a particular S/N for a type of correlations in data that has none. These two false alarm studies result in p-values, Table 2, too high to conclude that there is evidence for any correlations. It is possible that the measured HD S/N can therefore arise by chance from a common process with no spatial correlation."

            "text": "Since a PTA is made from a number of single pulsars, we can look at how each pulsar contributes to the CP by itself. The dropout factor gives a measure on how consistent a given pulsar\u2019s intrinsic red noise is with the CP by comparing a model with and without the CP for the pulsar (see e.g., Arzoumanian et al. 2020). The dropout factors for each pulsar computed using both the traditional hypermodel and factorized likelihood approaches are shown in Figure 7. About 20 pulsars have factors > 1, while only three slightly disfavor the CP, with the remaining pulsars displaying indifference.\nMonte Carlo sampling uncertainties on the dropout factors (computed either way) can be estimated through statistical bootstrapping (Efron & Tibshirani 1994). In the hypermodel dropout analysis the MCMC chain is re-sampled with replacement, generating a new statistical realization of the sampled chain that is exceptionally unlikely to be identical to the original chain. This process was repeated 103 times, generating many realizations of the MCMC chain from which the dropout factors were computed. Hence a distribution of dropout factors over bootstrap realizations was generated for each pulsar, allowing us to compute median values and 95% confidence intervals. A similar procedure was performed for the factorized likelihood approach. For a given bootstrap realization, each individual pulsar\u2019s MCMC chain was re-sampled with replacement. With the re-sampled CP posteriors for each pulsar, the factorized-likelihood approach pieces together the dropout factor by iteratively removing pulsars from the array, and all by using bootstrapped pulsar CP posterior chains. This process was repeated for 103 bootstrap realizations across 25 different combinations of metaparameters used in the factorized-likelihood dropout factor calculation. The end result is that the median dropout factor and 95% confidence intervals were computed from a total of 2.5\u00d7 104 factorized-likelihood dropout values for each pulsar. As is seen in Figure 7, all dropout factors are consistent between both techniques. The vast majority of pulsars have dropout factors with overlapping error bars from both\nmethods, and those that don\u2019t are within a few sigma of each other. Those pulsars that show the largest disparity are ones for which there were MCMC sampling inefficiencies that manifested in different stages of the dropout factor calculation, e.g., in the Savage-Dickey density ratio, or in the integral of the (N \u2212 1) array\u2019s CP likelihood over the posterior of a given pulsar (Taylor et al., in prep.).\nThe modularity and speed allowed by the factorized likelihood method can be used to approximate different combinations of pulsars within the array. These sub-arrays are a useful way to verify and understand the results we see in the full array. We created four sub-arrays, consisting of pulsars with the highest/lowest dropout factors, longest/shortest timespans. These pulsars were selected by sorting all pulsars in the array by their dropout and time-span characteristics, and then taking the top half of 27 pulsars and the bottom half of 26 pulsars. The Savage-Dickey density ratio was calculated for these sub-arrays to compare them to that of the full array. The sub-array made up of the top half of pulsars according to dropout factor had a Savage-Dickey density ratio of 5.6 \u00d7 109, an order of magnitude larger than that of the unaltered array, 1.6\u00d7 108. The corresponding sub-array of the bottom half of pulsars based on dropout had a density ratio of 1.8. When comparing the pulsars with the longest and shortest timespans, the sub-array with the longer timespans had a Savage-Dickey density ratio of 1.8 \u00d7 107 and the shorter timespan sub-array had a density ratio of 3.6. These results were not surprising, as the dropout factor is a method of measuring the evidence for the array\u2019s common process in a particular pulsar, so by removing those that have low (high) dropout factors, the evidence for the CP will increase (decrease). Similarly, pulsars with short timespans are not sensitive to the lowest frequencies explored by the array when in combination with longer timespan pulsars."

Each data set is then analysed separately. We find that the first half gives little information to the CP, with a broad power law 2D posterior contour that still encompasses the contour from the full data set.

This appears to be in tension with our results from analysis of the second data release with a CP amplitude of 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221215. However, there are two major differences to point out: 1) the different choice of priors for the pulsar red, DM and common noise (Hazboun et al. 2020b) and 2) the DR1 upper limit was computed without the use of a SSE uncertainty model (Vallisneri et al. 2020). Both of which have been shown to lead to an increase in the upper limit, alleviating tensions between the DR1 and DR2 CP amplitudes.\nAs in other recent PTA analyses, we find strong evidence in favor of the CP over the noise only hypothesis. It is important to note that 1) the lack of support for GWlike spatial correlations prohibits any claims of GW detection, however 2) this type of evidence for a similar red noise is expected to precede a detection of spatial correlations (Siemens et al. 2013; Pol et al. 2021; Romano et al. 2021).\nGoncharov et al. (2021a) recently demonstrated that the common-spectrum process model is favored over the noise-only hypothesis when the noise spectra cluster in a similar range, and it is not favored anymore when the noise spectra are drawn from the prior distribution. Because we know that the employed prior distribution for red noise parameters is not representative, it is possible that the evidence we find for a common-spectrum process is caused by a rejection of a null hypothesis rather than by all pulsars exhibiting the spatially-uncorrelated component of a GWB.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nThus, it is important to examine the single pulsar red noise in detail. We have looked at constraints on the simple power law models for the pulsars used in the CP search. In general, pulsars with detectable intrinsic noise have comparable or larger noise than the CP; pulsars without red noise typically have large amount of white noise, such that the CP is \u2018hidden\u2018. One noticeable exception is PSR J2317+1439, whose noise spectrum falls clearly below the CP, see also its low dropout factor in Figure 7.\nAs the search for the common spectrum can be influenced by pulsar intrinsic noise, especially in an inhomogeneous data set, the crucial analysis has to consider information from the cross-correlations. It should be noted that the median amplitudes are slightly different in the analyses with and without spatial correlations, 2.8\u00d7 10\u221215 vs 3.2\u00d7 10\u221215. One can also note the stark difference in the posterior for the split ORF analysis, Figure 4 and the optimal statistic analyses vs the Bayesian uncorrelated analysis, Figure 5. In other analyses (Arzoumanian et al. 2020; Goncharov et al. 2021a; Chen et al. 2021b) the amplitudes between the two analyses are more in line with one another. The difference here could be in part due to the very long baselines of only a handful of pulsars. This legacy data allows only scant opportunity for correlations amongst those few pulsars, while the long baselines allow the detection of auto-correlated power, even in noisier data. Another possibility is that there is unaccounted for noise in individual pulsars that is contaminating the signal. Advanced models to take these pulsar noises into account for the GWB search have been shown to affect the individual pulsar red noise (e.g., Arzoumanian et al. 2020; Goncharov et al. 2021a, Chalumeau et al., in prep.)."

            "text": "Spatial correlations in pulsar timing data have been studied in depth in the literature (Tiburzi et al. 2016; Roebber 2019), and their consideration is an important part of any GW detection procedure. While GWs induce a quadrupoledominated set of correlations there are other types of spatial correlations between pulsar data sets (Roebber & Holder 2017; Tiburzi et al. 2016; Roebber 2019). Monopolar spatial correlations, i.e., all pulsars seeing the same shifts in residuals irrespective of sky position, can manifest from clock errors, either in the BIPM clock standards, or the various observatory clocks used across the world (Hobbs et al. 2020). Dipolar spatial correlations can manifest from the error in measurement of processes where the motion of the Earth in the solar system is important (Caballero et al. 2018). This is most direct in the modeling of the solar system barycenter frame of reference, into which all pulsar TOAs are transformed. Errors in solar wind modeling can also add dipolar correlations (Tiburzi et al. 2016). While monopole and dipole correlations are theoretically orthogonal to HD correlations in the space of overlap reduction functions, real data with noise can result in some of these modes mixing (Roebber 2019). This mixing could erroneously be detected as a GWB.\nThe polarization content of the GWB could also deviate from the two tensor transverse (TT) modes predicted by general relativity which lead to the HD spatial correlations (Arzoumanian et al. 2021b). Deviations from general relativity would result in a correlation pattern that differs\nfrom HD. We would like to emphasize that the current data set does not allow us to draw any conclusions on the presence of spatial correlations. As can be seen in Figure 6 the uncertainties on the spatial correlation coefficients \u0393ab(\u03be) determined by the optimal statistic analysis are large. For most angular bins the correlation is indistinguishable from zero, corresponding to the uncorrelated CP. Close to submission of this paper, we noticed a preprint by Chen et al. (2021a). They have analyzed the IPTA DR2 searching for alternative GW polarizations and claim evidence for spatial correlations induced by a scalar transverse (ST) polarization mode. Chen et al. (2021a) also report a Bayes factor in favor of HD correlations (TT modes) compared to an uncorrelated CP about six times larger than we find: 12 against our 2. Even though we have not searched for the ST mode, we would like to highlight that the reported high evidence of spatial correlations in Chen et al. (2021a) is contrary to what we conclude using the same data set. The scalar transverse ORF is positive definite and should be accompanied by positive evidence for a monopolar correlation in analyses using only the cross-terms (Arzoumanian et al. 2021b). This is the case in our optimal statistic analysis where the monopolar correlations have the largest S/N and smallest false alarm p-value. In this sense finding some evidence in favor of ST correlations is not too surprising, however, we find no conclusive evidence in favor of any correlation pattern. Using more information in our analysis with both auto- and cross-terms disfavors monopolar correlations compared to an uncorrelated CP. Therefore, the conclusions of Chen et al. (2021a) need to be taken with caution. Finally, Chen et al. (2021a) find a Bayes factor in favor of the common process to be several orders of magnitude smaller (log10 BF = 4.6 compared to 8.2) than we do. They use a different pulsar noise model, including an additional sinusoidal annual DM variation in all pulsars, which could account for some, but likely not all, of the differences."

Given that these systems are just a local subset of the cosmological SMBHB population producing the GWB, their local number density, \u03a6BHB,0, should correlate with the amplitude of the GWB. The GWB amplitude induced by a cosmological population of circularized SMBHBs can be expressed in geometric units (where G = c = 1) as (e.g. Phinney 2001; Sesana et al. 2008; Sesana 2013b)\nA2GWB = 4\n3\u03c01/3\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dM1dzdq M5/3\n(1 + z)1/3 d3\u03a6BHB dM1dzdq , (7)\nwhere M1 is the mass of the primary SMBH, M2 the mass of the secondary, q = M2/M1 \u2264 1 is the mass ratio, M5/3 = [q(1 + q)\u22122]M5/3 is the SMBHB chirp mass with total binary mass M = M1 + M2, and d\n3\u03a6BHB/(dM1dzdq) is the differential comoving number density of SMBHBs per unit M1, z, and q.\nTo determine the local number density of SMBHBs implied by a AGWB \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221215 background we use the quasar-based SMBHB model from Casey-Clyde et al. (2021),\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nwhich assumes proportionality between SMBHB and quasar populations (which may be triggered by galaxy major mergers, Stemo et al. 2020) over mass and redshift. This has the effect of setting AGWB \u221d \u221a \u03a6BHB,0, so that AGWB directly implies \u03a6BHB,0. To check coverage of the entire signal from SMBHBs over mass and redshift, we parameterize AGWB = AGWB(\u03a6BHB,0,M1,min, zmax), where M1,min and zmax are the minimum primary SMBH mass and maximum redshift, respectively, in Equation 7 (Casey-Clyde et al. 2021). We plot this parameterization of the GWB compared to various strain measurements in Figure 11, including an AGWB \u2248 2.8\u00d7 10\u221215 signal (bold contour, gray isosurface).\nThe 2D panels of Figure 11 show three representative slices from this parameter space (one along each axis), with contours denoting their intersection with isosurfaces of constant GWB signal amplitude. The 3D plot shows the bottom right 2D panel in this 3D parameter space, along with its intersection with an AGWB \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221215 isosurface. We find that recovery of a background amplitude like ACP requires \u03a6BHB,0 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 Mpc\u22123 (corresponding to the bottom right 2D panel in Figure 11), roughly an order of magnitude larger than the \u223c 1.6\u00d710\u22126 Mpc\u22123 number density implied by Mingarelli et al. (2017).\nBesides this new quasar-based method the standard approach to determining the local number density \u03a6BHB,0 is to model d3\u03a6BHB/(dM1dzdq) using major mergers and empirically observed galaxy and black hole relations (e.g., Simon & Burke-Spolaor 2016; Chen et al. 2019; Middleton et al. 2021). Following the methods from Middleton et al. (2021) we analyze the IPTA DR2 CP amplitude. Figure 12 compares the spread of amplitude and spectral index from the IPTA DR2 CP against values recovered from realizations of SMBHB population simulations. The original population constraints using the NANOGrav (Arzoumanian et al. 2020) frequency bins are shown by the grey shaded area. Repeating the analysis with the frequency coverage of the IPTA DR2 gives the purple shaded contours. As we reach into lower frequencies the simulations become more constrained towards the expected spectral index \u03b3 = 13/3.

More recently immense effort was put into the development of individualized noise models for PPTA pulsars, demonstrating that sensitivity can be gained from better modeling (Goncharov et al. 2021b). Similar advanced noise modeling efforts are currently underway in both NANOGrav (Arzoumanian et al., in prep.) and EPTA (Chalumeau et al., in prep.). More sophisticated noise modeling is important, because many types of noise can add steep spectral index, low frequency power to pulsar data sets, complicating GWB recovery. For example, noise from fluctuations due to the interstellar medium or time-correlated noise from long-term instrumental effects in telescope systems, which could arise from a combination of polarisation miscalibration and secular changes in receiver gain."

Figure 1 and Figure 8 show that IPTA DR2 is significantly more sensitive than any of the constituent data sets from which it is constructed. While the data in DR2 have now been superseded by more up-to-date efforts, (Alam et al. 2021; Kerr et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2021b), Figure 9 shows that the sensitivity from combining these older data sets is comparable with these newer single PTA data releases.\nThe conclusions of this analysis are broadly similar to the various GWB analyses carried out by the NANOGrav, the PPTA and EPTA (Arzoumanian et al. 2020; Goncharov et al. 2021a; Chen et al. 2021b). All of these data sets favor the CP model over one with only intrinsic red noise in the individual pulsars. None of these data sets shows clear support\nfor the spatial correlations indicative of a GWB. Therefore a detection of a GWB can not be claimed. The strong detection of red noise that broadly matches the spectral characteristic of a GWB from SMBHBs before there is support for spatial correlations is expected from our understanding of the change in sensitivity of PTAs (Romano et al. 2021; Siemens et al. 2013). As was shown in (Pol et al. 2021), if the power in the auto-correlations of these pulsars is the first sign of the GWB then evidence for the spatial correlations should follow in upcoming data sets. If the next individual PTA data sets show increased support, but are short of detection thresholds, then combining them into an IPTA data set could immediately result in a data set with a significant detection. Such a combination will have the longest timespan, largest number of pulsars and independent observing systems, and will thus enable a robust GWB search."

Many analyses have been performed over more than 2 years by PTB, AC, SChe, JAE, JMG, JSH, KI, ADJ, WGL, CMFM, NSP, NKP, DJR, LSc, JS, LSp, SRT and SJV under the leadership of several WG chairs over this time period: PTB, SChe, JSH, PDL, CMFM, DJR and SRT.\nInitial tests, checks of the data quality and exploratory analyses were made by PTB, SChe, JAE, JMG, JSH, KI, CMFM, DJR, JS, SRT and SJV. Although not much of the work is presented in this paper, it helped us tremendously in understanding the subtle details of the data set and built confidence in our analysis. The final results shown come from runs performed by AC, SChe, JSH, ADJ, WGL, NSP, NKP, ASa, LSc, GS, LSp and SRT. The single pulsar noise analysis was done by SChe. The Bayesian parameter estimation were done by NSP, JSH and WGL. The optimal statistic analysis was run by JSH and NSP, with help from AC, NKP and LSp for the phase-shifts and sky-scramble null-distributions. ADJ and JSH have contributed to the Bayes factor computations. The factorized likelihood method has been applied to the data by LSc and SRT. NSP has computed the dropout factors. SChe performed the analyses of the constituent data sets, with cross-checks from ASa and GS. PTB lead the comparison between the IPTA DR2 and recent PTA data sets, which were graciously provided by JS for the NANOGrav 12.5yr, BG for the PPTA DR2 and SChe for the EPTA DR2. The astrophysical interpretation was lead by JACC and CMFM with contributions from SChe and ASe.\nSChe lead the coordination of the paper writing with the help of JSH and PTB. PTB, JACC, SChe, MED, BG, JSH, CMFM, BBPP, NSP, LSc, RMS, SRT and SJV con-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\ntributed to the writing of the paper. The figures were created by NSP, JSH, JACC, and SChe."
