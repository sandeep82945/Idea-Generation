            "text": "Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory response of the nervous tissue mediated by the production of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have shown that an upregulation of immunoproteasome is highly associated with various diseases and its inhibition attenuates neuroinflammation. The immunoproteasome (iP) is a specialized, pro-inflammatory cytokine-, and oxidative stress-induced subtype of the constitutive proteasome and plays a key role in both immuno and non-immuno responses due to its three immunosubunits. In detail, in presence of inflammatory stimuli, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, or oxidative stress, the proteolytic \u03b2-subunits of 20S core constitutive proteasome, i.e., \u03b21c, \u03b22c, and \u03b25c, are substituted by immunosubunits \u03b21i (LMP2/proteasome subunit beta 9, PSMB9), \u03b22i (multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1, MECL-1) and \u03b25i (LMP7). As a consequence of this subunit replacement, the iP characterized by enhanced proteolytic activities compared to the constitutive proteasome was formed [1,2]. The iP is mainly involved in the MHC-I antigen process, mediating the production of inflammatory cytokines in several animal model [3,4], and regulating protein homeostasis preventing the accumulation of the oxidatively-damaged and ubiquitylated proteins [5]. iP is also involved in a wide number of inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10732. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241310732 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10732 2 of 15\ndisease, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and neuroinflammation [6]. In particular, different works demonstrated that iP is expressed in neurons, glia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and it is markedly upregulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 [7\u201310]. In particular, under inflammatory or stress conditions of the nervous system, the accumulation of misfolded proteins causes the production of danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) which stimulate NF-kB activation and the upregulation of iP binding Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) [11,12]. In this context, neuroinflammation would trigger proteotoxicity and the persistent upregulation of iP, which in turn should be a key promoter of neuroinflammation [13]. In this context, immunoproteasome inhibition could represent a hopeful strategy for the management of several human diseases including inflammatory disease. In recent years, several \u03b25i and/or \u03b21i immunoproteasome-selective inhibitors have been developed; in particular, Ettari et al. [14]. identified several amide derivatives, which are able to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activities of iP and, due to the non-covalent inhibition, reduce side effects associated with the irreversible inhibition. Among these, KJ3 and KJ9 (Figure 1) are characterized by the presence of a pyridone scaffold at the P3 site which acts as bioisostere of a leucine residue, at the P2 site they bear a homophenyl alanine (KJ3) or a phenyl alanine residue (KJ9), while the amide function spanning into the P1 region is N-phenyl ethyl (KJ3) or N-benzyl substituted (KJ9).\nInt.

The results of this investigation showed that KJ9 inhibited both the\n\u03b25c and the \u03b25i subunits with Ki values of 3.02 and 7.77 \u00b5M, while KJ3 inhibited the sole\n\u03b25i subunit with a Ki value of 3.85 \u00b5M [14]. In particular, unlike the covalent inhibitors,\nthese designed analogues don\u2019t own an electrophilic moiety and could act as noncovalent\nimmunoproteasome inhibitors also reducing the side effects due to the irreversible inhi-\nbition [15]. Therefore, the goal of this work was to investigate the effects of amide deriva-\ntives, KJ3 and KJ9, in an in vitro model TNF-\u03b1 induced neuroinflammation in differenti-\nated SH-SY5Y and HMC3 cells."

We measured the rate of hydrolysis of the appropriate fluorogenic substrate, i.e., SucLeu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC for both \u03b25i and \u03b25c. MG-132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al), a reversible inhibitor of both proteasome and immunoproteasome, was used as a positive control. Tian continuous assays were conducted using seven different concentrations, ranging from those that minimally inhibited to those that fully inhibited the immunoproteasome or the proteasome subunits to determine the IC50 values.\nInt.

            "text": "Neuroinflammation is a complex inflammation-like process that plays a key role in the central nervous system (CNS) and it is used by cells of CNS to eradicate pathogens halting the infection, and remove cell debris and misfolded proteins. Overactivated neuroinflammation causes the activation of neuronal cells, such as microglia cells, neurons, and astrocytes, and it is mediated by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secondary messengers [16]. The activation of CNS cells during neuroinflammation is caused by several inflammatory stimuli which promote the induction of numerous pathways such as NF\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling [17]. In particular, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway inducing an overproduction and release of TNF\u03b1 causing the activation of microglia cells [18]. Moreover, Mir et al. demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 play a key role in the induction of oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and motoneuron death in rat spinal cord embryonic explants [19]. The constitutive ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates protein homeostasis and is involved in several key processes, such as cell proliferation, cell death, inflammation, and modulation of stressful conditions [20]. High concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1) or oxidative stress caused the development of immunoproteasome (iP) complex in which the active constitutive proteasome subunits, \u03b21c, \u03b22c, and \u03b25c were replaced by \u03b21i, \u03b22i, and \u03b25i. Several pieces of evidence demonstrated that the iP is involved in different inflammatory disorders and regulates ERK1/1, the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production [21\u201325]. Therefore, the use of immunoproteasome inhibitors, able to regulate the activity and the expression of iP, could represent a powerful approach for the control of many cell functions and for the management of several inflammatory diseases. In this work, we evaluated the properties of two new amide derivatives, KJ3 and KJ9, which act as inhibitors of immunoproteasome, in an in vitro model of neuroinflammation provoked by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. In accordance with previous papers and also in our experimental model, TNF-\u03b1 is able to stimulate neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity in neuronal and microglial cells [21\u201324]; indeed, ROS levels and the expression of the inflammatory targets were significantly increased. KJ9 was proven to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activities of \u03b25c and \u03b25i, whereas KJ3 inhibited only the \u03b25i of the immunoproteasome. These data are very important, because it was demonstrated that immunosubunit \u03b25i can control cytokine production through the NF-kB signaling pathway [26,27]. In accordance with this hypothesis, we tested the possible anti-inflammatory effects of these two new amides analogs in neuronal and microglia cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1. Our results demonstrated that KJ3 and KJ9 were able to reduce the expression of p-ERK, IKB\u03b1, and NF-kB; moreover, these compounds also caused a significant decrease in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 protein levels, downstream genes of NF-kB, suggesting that KJ3 and KJ9 can reduce neuroinflammation through the modulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway. Thus, these data are in agreement with previous works that demonstrated that other immunoproteasome inhibitors, such as ONX-0914, a peptide epoxyketone-based irreversible \u03b25i-selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, and a dual covalent \u03b25i/\u03b22i selective inhibitor, KZR-616, induce an anti-inflammatory response in an in vivo model of rheumatoid arthritis and inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, respectively [28\u201331]. Several studies demonstrated that diseases characterized by an increase in TNF\u03b1, such as inflammatory disorders, show an increased ubiquitin expression [32\u201335]; in particular, TNF-\u03b1 stimulates the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1 protein) that stimulates ubiquitin expression. Activated ubiquitin was transferred to a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2), which interacts with a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and transfers the ubiquitin to the protein substrate [36]. In accordance with these works, in our experimental protocol, TNF-\u03b1 produced a marked increase in the ubiquitin protein levels in both used cell lines. Moreover, our results showed that in KJ3 and KJ9 treated cells the expression of ubiquitin protein\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10732 10 of 15\nwas reduced compared to TNF-\u03b1 challenged cells; these results are in agreement with Basler et al. that suggested that the ubiquitin did not accumulate in LMP7-deficient cells, probably because constitutive proteasome cope with the immunoproteasome to degrade ubiquitin proteins [37]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that \u03b25 subunit inhibition does not influence protein degradation and proteotoxicity in multiple myeloma cells [38] whereas Kisselev and Oberdorf suggested that only the inhibition of both \u03b25 and \u03b21 or \u03b22 affects protein degradation and proteotoxic stress [39,40]. To test the involvement of \u03b25i in the degradation of cytosolic and mitochondrial-oxidized protein we evaluated the accumulation of intracellular ROS in differentiated SH-SY5Y and HMC3 cell lines. In agreement with the results obtained for the ubiquitin expression, KJ3 and KJ9 treated cells did not show an accumulation of intracellular ROS confirming the hypothesis that \u03b25 subunit is not involved in proteotoxic stress. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that both KJ3 and KJ9, non-covalent \u03b25i inhibitors, own anti-inflammatory activities, since they reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulate the NF-kB signaling pathway, without affecting the ability of immunoproteasome to degrade ubiquitin protein and control proteotoxicity. Moreover, unlike other immunoproteasome inhibitors, these new amide derivatives do not show the drawbacks and side effects due to the non-covalent inhibition. Considering these results, immunoproteasome inhibitors could represent promising candidates for preclinical and clinical investigations for several human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory diseases."
