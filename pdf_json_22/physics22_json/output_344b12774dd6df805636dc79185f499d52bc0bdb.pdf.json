    "abstractText": "Fast Radio Bursts (hereafter FRBs) can be used in cosmology by studying the Dispersion Measure (hereafter DM) as a function of redshift. The large scale structure of matter distribution is regarded as a major error budget for such application. Using optical galaxy and dispersion measure mocks built from N-body simulations, we have shown that the galaxy number density can be used as a tracer for large scale electron density and help improve the measurement of DM as a function of redshift. We have shown that, using the line-of-sight galaxy number counts within 1\u2019 around the given localized FRB source can help improve the cosmological parameter constraints by more than 20%.",

The large scale structure of matter distribution is regarded as a major error budget for such application. Using optical galaxy and dispersion measure mocks built from N-body simulations, we have shown that the galaxy number density can be used as a tracer for large scale electron density and help improve the measurement of DM as a function of redshift. We have shown that, using the line-of-sight galaxy number counts within 1\u2019 around the given localized FRB source can help improve the cosmological parameter constraints by more than 20%.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCurrently, \u039bCDM model is considered as the standard model of cosmology [1]. It is supported by varieties of observations, including cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy measurement from Planck [2], baryon acoustic oscillations data from SDSS galaxy surveys [3], type Ia supernovae data from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis [4], and H0 data from distance ladder observation [5, 6]. The constrains of cosmological parameters are quite precise today, but still lots of attempts are made to verify the consistency from different methods. There is some tension in the measurement of H0 [7\u201310]. Therefore, we demand new methods probing the cosmic expansion history, such as using standard siren, 21cm intensity mapping, FRBs [11\u201314].\nFast Radio bursts are short-duration (\u223cms) radio bursts (\u223cGHz) which was first detected in 2007 [15]. FRBs seems to be very common in our universe [16]. From their isotropic dispersion measures, most FRBs have been confirmed to have extragalactic origins [17]. FRB200428 is the first FRB which is located inside the Milky Way [18]. The astrophysical mechanism of FRBs is still mysterious, but more and more information about their source have been reported [18, 19]. Several good reviews have summarized current theories about FRBs and its physical mechanism [20\u201322]. Moreover, hundreds of FRBs are gradually observed nowadays. Their information are available online 1. Many radio telescopes such as CHIME [23], PARKES [24], FAST [25], BINGO [26], SKA [27] have detected considerable FRBs or can be expected to observe much more FRBs in the near future.\nSince the first known repeater FRB121102 [19] was detected and located, with or without a repeating source, several FRBs are well located as well [28, 29]. With their\n\u2217 jjzhang@shao.ac.cn 1 http://www.frbcat.org\nextragalactic location known, FRBs show great potential to be new independent probes of cosmology [30, 31]. The dispersion measure (hereafter DM) of an FRB contains the information about ionized baryons of the path from the source to earth. The expectation of DM contributed by the intergalactic medium from an FRB at redshift z is highly related to the cosmological model and parameters. Hence the FRBs with their DM(z) can be used to contrain cosmology, although it is still hard to separate DM from its host galaxy\u2019s contribution.\nPreviously, Macquart et al. [32] has tried to do parameters constrain from known localized FRBs in the universe. Combined with constrains from other observations [2] as their prior, Walters et al. [33] explore the constrains with more FRBs generated by simulation. Futher, Walters et al. [34] discussed the result with a weaker assumption of knowledge about diffuse gas fraction.\nFrom their large dispersion measure, naturally we can associate FRBs with large scale structure. RafieiRavandi et al. [35] has summarized the angular crosscorrelation between DM and large-scale structure of galaxy with the results released by CHIME/FRB catalogue [23]. In addition, Shirasaki et al. [36]\u2019 investigated the angular cross-correlation in detail with hydrodynamical simulation illustrisTNG. Following their inspiration, we attempted to use such a cross-correlation to partly eliminated the variance of DM contributed by the largescale structure, in order to obtain a better cosmological constraints. In this work, we will verify the improvement of cosmological parameter constraints using FRBs with the knowledge of line-of-sight galaxy number.\nIn this paper, we will show our results as follows: in section II, we will introduce some basic background knowledge, including the definition of DM and how to calculate it in different coordinate; in section III, we will introduce the method how we deal with the N-body simulation data; in section IV, we will show some noteworthy results from mocks; in section V, we will show the concrete MCMC improvement after applying the crosscorrelation we acquire; finally in section VI, a brief sum-\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n03 86\n7v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n8 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2 A0 A1 A2 A3\ndens 3\ndens 2dens 1\ndens 4\nFIG. 1.

In actual observation, contribution of Milky Way can be obtained from research about pulsars, though not very accurately. Usually we cannot get adequate information of host galaxy of an FRB, and the contribution of DM from the host galaxy is very likely unknown.

MDR1 provides the matter density field data and the halo catalogue. In our research, we need to calculate the dispersion measure between arbitrary two points in the\nbox and the galaxy number in an arbitrary light-cone (or weighted light-cone which we will introduce later).\nThe side length of the cosmological cube is 1 Gpc/h, which is still too small to cover the redshift range of FRBs. We have used the periodic boudary condition of the simulation to construct a much larger box to cover all the FRBs we have considered, up to z = 2.\nMDR1 only gives the data of over-density in each cell (for convenience we will use density instead, and denote it by dens = \u03c1background\u00d7 (1 + overdensity)). To calculate DM, we need to obtain number density of free electron in each cell. For simplicity, we have set the distribution of baryon to be the same as dark matter. We ignored the difference in metallicity and ionization fraction, assumed that IH = 1 and IHe = 2. Then expression of DM becomes\nDM = \u222b \u03c7 0 dens(\u03c7\u2032)\u00d7 7 8 \u2126b \u2126m d\u03c7\u2032.

We are looking for an optimal number of \u03b8, using which can provide us good cross correlation between DM and ngal. We can see that considering different redshift, \u03b8 = 0.0027 is an optimal choice and for simplicity we choose half top-angle for both \u2019cone\u2019 and \u2019cone+\u2019 to be \u03b8 = 0.003 (radiant) which is approximately equal to 1\u2019 in degree. The mollweide projection images are shown in the Fig.??. At low redshift, we will encounter many pixels whose value is 0, in the mollview image of cone. Such a problem can be solved by using \u2019cone+\u2019. Hence the cross-correlation between DM and ngal will be better if we use \u2019cone+\u2019 at low redshift. But at high redshift, the little difference between \u2019cone\u2019 and \u2019cone+\u2019 will not make significant influence on the cross-correlation. The comparison is shown in Fig.4. We have compared the cross correlation coefficient between DM and ngal using \u2019cone\u2019 and \u2019cone+\u2019, and we have also\n0.5\n1\nz= 0.\n1\n0.0003 0.0009 0.0027 0.0081\n0.5\n1\nz= 0.\n5\n100 200 300 400 cone\n0\n0.5\n1\nz= 1.\n4\n100 200 300 400 cone+\nshown the redshift evolution of the cross correlation using \u2019cone\u2019. It is clear that at higher redshift, the correlation is better and the difference between \u2019cone\u2019 and \u2019cone+\u2019 is smaller. Because \u2019cone+\u2019 require more complicated calculation for the galaxy distribution and considering that we are more interested in high redshift FRBs and their DM, we will use the \u2019cone\u2019 method to do further analysis about DM.\n5 0.1 1.0 2.0 0.1\n1.0\n2.0 (a) (b)\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nFIG. 5.

In our research, we will not assume any prior knowledge about the parameters; hence all the parameters will follow uniform distribution in their well-defined interval (\u2126b,\u2126m \u223c u(0, 1)). We randomly set points in the simulation box to be FRBs source and use the same method to calculate their DM. Then we will try to find a method to associate the DM with ngal, and finally compare the results.\nWe have obtained a 20 \u00d7 20 covariance matrix from the 20 mocks built from the simulations at 20 redshifts,\n80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 ngal\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\nDM\nz=1\nFIG. 7.

We then use a third-order polynomial p(z) = p3 \u00d7 z3 + p2 \u00d7 z2 + p1 \u00d7 z + p0 to fit a(z) and b(z), the results are shown in table I. In Fig.5, We also plot a smoother image of Pearson product-moment coefficient matrix compared to original one with our fitting function, in order to verify whether it is appropriate. The result shows it is applicable within the range of our research. The MCMC result from 500 FRBs with the location of true value is shown in the Fig.6 The true values well lie in the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 area, so that we use the covariance matrix and the related method to do further study.\nFrom Eq.6, we can see that the cosmological parameters that we can put constraints using DM(z) is \u2126M , \u2126b and H0, under the flat space assumption. However \u2126b and H0 are degenerate, the only independent cosmological parameters are \u2126M and \u2126bh. Therefore, it is sufficient to perform MCMC fitting for these two sets of parameters. In Fig.6, we have shown that using the covariance matrix fitting function and the randomly generated FRBs, we can put constraints on the cosmological parameters and the true value well lie in the 1\u2212\u03c3 range. In the error range contour, it is well known that the large scale structure plays an important role in the error budget of the function DM(z). With the information of lineof-sight galaxy number, we can have a better estimation of the large scale structure of matter distribution, thus provide a smaller error.\n6"

Their distribution is shown in Fif.7. Then we figure out that the relation between ngal and DM is almost linear when z \u2265 0.3; but if z is too small, there will be too many pixels with its ngal is 0. With a determined halo occupation distribution model, the mean ngal is known. We use these 16 groups of points to fit a function of form separately at different redshift,\nDM(ngal, z) = k(z)(ngal \u2212 n\u0304gal) + b(z) (11)\nAs we expect, b(z) is equal to DMmean(z) within 4% error, and the error decreases to 0.4% as z increases to 2.\nStrictly speaking, k(z) is not only dependant on the \u03b8 of the light-cone but also related to the halo occupation model we established. Hence here we will only use interpolation method to obtain k(z) at FRBs\u2019 redshift, and\na we quote the uncertainties based on the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles of the samples, and in our case, it is a little different from the maximum likelihood point.\nleave further research for our future study. With known ngal and DM associated with the same FRB which located at z > 0.2, we can correct our expectation about corresponding DMmean by using Eq.10,\nDMcor = DMfrb \u2212 k(z)[ngal \u2212 n\u0304gal], (12)\nwhere DMfrb is the primitive DM, and DMcor is what we will use in MCMC analysis after correction."

As the results shown in Fig.8 suggest, our correction is effective, the DM of FRBs distributes closer to the theoretical expectation compared with original data. More practically, if we apply our correction method to put constaints on the cosmological parameters given 100 random FRBs or 500 random FRBs, the improvement of constraints can be clearly seen in Fig.9. The blue contours show the parameter uncertainty range after the correction and the red contours show the range before the correction, which is what we normally see in literature. The detail number of the cosmological parameters are summarised in table II. We shall notice that such improvement is free. Since if we can localize the FRBs and get their redshift, these FRBs are localized by matching the radio signal location to the given galaxy catalog. We naturally know the number of galaxies near the host galaxies of the FRBs, which can be easily obtained. The improvement of the precision of cosmological constraints is more than 20%."

On the top, we show the improvement of cosmological constraints using 100 FRBs. On the bottom, we show the improvement using 500 FRBs. We can see clear improvement in the cosmological parameters constraints for both cases.\nto measure the expansion history of the universe is a unique method. If we have better understanding of the error budget in the dispersion measure of FRBs, we will have better chance to put tight constraints on cosmological parameters.\nIn this paper, we have proven the idea that, using the information of large scale structure traced by galaxies, we may put tighter constraints with FRBs, really works. We have shown that just use the galaxy number within 1\u2019 around the FRBs host galaxies, we can correct the DM(z) expectation value optimally. Afterwards, we may have more than 20% improvement in the cosmological constraining precision.\nWe have covered almost all the steps for cosmological analysis using FRBs in this paper, but there are quite some details need to be improved so that our method can be really applied to the real observation. For example, how do the DM-ngal relation rely on the galaxy mean number density, what is the parameters of this relation for some real observational data, is the simple model of ionized gas sufficient for our analysis here, how much improvement will we have if we consider other error budgets etc. We will cover these questions in our future study. Beyond cosmological application, the cross correlation between DM and galaxy distribution can also tell us more about the gas environment around galaxies and the properties of IGM. We hope our study here can provide useful hints for the other study in the future."
