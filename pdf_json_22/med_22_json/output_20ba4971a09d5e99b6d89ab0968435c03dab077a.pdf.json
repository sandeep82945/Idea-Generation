    "abstractText": "Rapeseed stores lipids in the form of oil bodies. Oil bodies in the seeds of higher plants are surrounded by oleosins. Adjusting oleosin protein levels can prevent the fusion of oil bodies and maintain oil body size during seed development. However, oil contents are affected by many factors, and studies on the complex molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the variations in seed oil contents of B. napus are limited. In this study, a total of 53 BnOLEO (B. napus oleosin) genes were identified in the genome of B. napus through a genome-wide analysis. The promoter sequences of oleosin genes consisted of various light-, hormone-, and stress-related cis-acting elements, along with transcription factor (TF) binding sites, for 25 TF families in 53 BnOLEO genes. The differentially expressed oleosin genes between two highand two low-oil-content accessions were explored. BnOLEO3-C09, BnOLEO4-A02, BnOLEO4-A09, BnOLEO2-C04, BnOLEO1-C01, and BnOLEO7-A03 showed higher expressions in the high-oil-content accessions than in low-oil-content accessions, at 25, 35, and 45 days after pollination (DAP) in two different environments. A regional association analysis of 50 re-sequenced rapeseed accessions was used to further analyze these six BnOLEO genes, and it revealed that the nucleotide variations in the BnOLEO1-C01 and BnOLEO7-A03 gene regions were related to the phenotypic variations in seed oil content. Moreover, a co-expression network analysis revealed that the BnOLEO genes were directly linked to lipid/fatty acid metabolism, TF, lipid transport, and carbohydrate genes, thus forming a molecular network involved in seed oil accumulation. These favorable haplotypes can be utilized in molecular marker-assisted selection in order to further improve seed oil contents in rapeseed.",

            "text": "Rapeseed (Brassica napus L., AACC, 2n = 38) is one of the most important oil crops, providing approximately 15% of vegetable oil worldwide [1]. It originated approximately 7500 years ago from a spontaneous hybridization between B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18) [2]. The large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) present in rapeseed oil have made it widely accepted as vegetable oil for human consumption and as biofuel for industry [3]. Enhancing seed oil content (SOC) and oil production per unit area of land is of paramount importance to meet the growing demand for oilseed breeding programs [4]. SOC is a highly complex trait due to multiple genes that regulate various seed-storage-oil metabolisms [5]. The biological and metabolic pathways for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis have been well recorded in various studies [6,7]. In the past few decades, oil content-associated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified in nearly all 19 linkage groups, and vary from 3 to 27 QTLs in each chromosome by biparental linkage mapping [8\u201315]. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to dissect the regulatory loci and genetic architecture of SOC at the whole-genome level. For example, a genome-wide association study conducted by\nPlants 2022, 11, 3140. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11223140 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nLiu et al. [16] identified 50 loci that were significantly associated with seed oil contents in 521 rapeseed accessions. GWAS was used to detect the associations of 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with seed quality traits in 405 B. napus inbred lines [17]. Tang et al. [18] used GWAS to detect the significant associations of 27 QTLs with SOC in different environments for 500 B. napus inbred lines. Xiao et al. [19] identified 17 loci that were significantly associated with seed oil content by GWAS, with 385,692 SNPs. GWAS was used to reveal nine haplotype regions that were significantly associated with the oil content in 203 Chinese semi-winter rapeseed accessions [20]. Although a large number of QTLs that affect oil content accumulations have been identified, their molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. With the development of sequencing and statistics, these approaches have been extensively applied to profile genome-wide gene expressions in crops. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) based on transcriptome data has become one of the most efficient methods to display the correlations between genes in a pairwise manner to construct network graphs [21]. Clustering genes show similar expression patterns across many samples, as they could be members of the same pathway or biological process. These co-expression network properties can be further correlated with target traits to find the functional genes [22]. For example, Cui et al. [23] established an acyl-lipid metabolism co-expression network and detected 12 hub genes related to oil content accumulations. WGCNA was used to identify five modules that were highly associated with high-quality fiber, as well as five transcription factor (TF) genes playing an important role in fiber development [24]. A co-expression network was used to detect seven hub genes that were involved in soybean oil and seed storage protein accumulations [25]. Oleosins are hydrophobic plant proteins related to small (0.6\u20132 \u00b5m diameter) storage oil droplets, termed oil bodies [26]. At present, six oleosin lineages have been reported, including P, U, SL, SH, T, and M. The P (primitive) lineage is mainly distributed in green algae and may be the source of U (universal) oleosins, which further gives rise to the SL (seed low molecular weight) and SH (seed high molecular weight) lineages. In addition, the T (tapetum) lineage was detected only in the tapeta of Brassicaceae, and the M (mesocarp) lineage was detected in Lauraceae [27\u201329]. Oleosins are found in the oil bodies of seeds, tapetum cells, and pollen, but not in fruits [30]. Many studies have shown that adjusting oleosin protein levels can prevent the fusion of oil bodies and maintain oil body size during seed development [6,31,32]. Siloto et al. [33] suggested that a lack of oleosins caused fusion of oil bodies, leading to a decrease in oil content during the middle stage of seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of GmOLEO1 was found to increase the numbers of oil bodies and oil accumulations in soybeans [34]. In this study, the expression patterns of the oleosin genes in high- and low-oil-content rapeseed inbred lines were analyzed during different developmental stages of the seed. The novel loci of the oleosin genes that affect the accumulation of seed oil content were further identified by resequencing 50 rapeseed accessions with 532,005 SNPs. A co-expression network was also employed to reveal the regulatory network of oleosin genes in the accumulation of oil content. Together, our findings lay a foundation for an enhanced understanding of the role of oleosin genes in the accumulation of oil content in B. napus."

Information on gene names, IDs, chromosomal locations, and amino acid numbers is listed in Table S1. In the present study, in order to analyze the evolutionary relationships of oleosin genes, a neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree was constructed based on 69 oleosin protein sequences that were divided into four lineages, namely, T, SL, SH, and U. The conserved motifs and exon and intron structures of the oleosin genes were then obtained (Figures S1 and S2). The T, SL, SH,\nand U lineages had 25, 8, 10, and 10 oleosin genes in B. napus, respectively. These results were consistent with the findings of Chen et al. [29]."

Cis-acting elements were found in the promoter region of the BnOLEO gene family, including elements primarily related to light, phytohormone, and abiotic stress responses (Figure 1, Table S2). The cis-regulatory elements included light-responsive elements, such as G-box, Box 4, and GT1-motif; phytohormone-responsive elements, such as ABRE (involved in the abscisic acid response); CGTCA- and TGACG-motifs (involved in methyl jasmonate response); TCA-elements (involved in salicylic acid response); motifs related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as ARE elements (essential for anaerobic induction); TC-rich repeats (involved in defense and stress responses), LTR (involved in low-temperature responsiveness); and MBS (MYB binding site involved in droughtinducibility); (Figure 1, Table S2). There were many light-responsive elements in the promoters of BnOLEO genes, including the G-box identified in the promoters of 53 BnOLEO genes (with 3.50 on average for each promoter), Box 4 elements present in 39 of the 53 BnOLEO gene promoters (with 2.67 on average for each promoter), and GT1-motif elements present in 31 BnOLEO gene promoters (with 2.10 on average for each promoter). In addition, 212 ABREs associated with hormone response were unevenly scattered in the promoters of 52 BnOLEO genes, which were most enriched in the SH lineage (54/10) but rare in the T lineage (80/25). A total of 198 methyl jasmonate (MeJA) response elements showed relatively unbiased distributions in both the SH and T lineages. Additionally, 156 ARE elements were found to be common in the promoters of 49 BnOLEO genes (with 3.18 on average for each promoter; Figure 1, Table S2).

Despite studies on genome-wide identification and functional analysis of oleosin genes in B. napus [29], the underlying molecular regulatory networks of the oleosin genes remain unclear. In this study, the promoters of 53 BnOLEO genes were studied for the presence of light-, hormone-, and stress-related cis-elements. Several types of light-responsive elements (for example, G-box, Box 4, and GT1-motif) and plant growth hormones, including abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and MeJA responsive elements, were identified in the candidate genes.\nLi et al. [36] suggested strong positive correlations between oil contents and different light intensities in Brassica species. Phytohormones play an important role in improving oil yield and quality by regulating several enzymatic activities and signaling responses [37]. Deletion of the G-box element was found to reduce the promoter activity for light and hormone responses [38]. Wu et al. [39] suggested that abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and MeJA at physiological concentrations played crucial roles in lipid accumulation. The occurrence of these cis-regulatory elements provided evidence of the role of BnOLEO genes in the accumulation of oil content in B. napus. RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the expression patterns of oleosin genes at different stages of seed development among two HOC and two LOC inbred lines. In total, 16 oleosin genes in the SL and SH lineages were highly expressed during seed development, including BnOLEO3-C09, BnOLEO4-A02, BnOLEO4-A09, BnOLEO2-C04, BnOLEO1-C01, and BnOLEO7-A03 in the HOC accessions, compared to the LOC accessions at 25, 35, and 45 DAP, in two different environments (Figure 3a). These results indicated that oleosin genes played an important role in the seed oil biosynthesis in B. napus. Meanwhile, a regional association analysis revealed that BnOLEO1-C01-Hap1 and BnOLEO7-A03-Hap1 corresponded to accessions with higher seed oil contents compared to other haplotype alleles (Figures 4 and S5, and Table S7). The haplotype region on the A03 chromosome, where BnOLEO7-A03 is located, overlaps with a previously reported QTL [40]. Thus, these favorable haplotype alleles can be used to further improve SOCs in rapeseed. In addition, co-expression network studies showed that 16 BnOLEO genes were directly linked to each other, as well as to TFs, including LEC1, WRI1, WRKY1, bZIP12, bZIP25, bZIP28, bZIP60, MYB44, MYB73, and MYB118. (Figure 5; Table S9). Prediction of the TF binding sites showed AP2/ERF, WRKY, bZIP, and MYB as the main gene families regulating oleosin genes (Figure 2, Table S3). TFs were found to be involved in positive or negative regulation of the expressions of genes responsible for oil content accumulation [41]. Overexpression of LEC1 was reported to cause upregulated expressions of FA synthetic genes, and promoted oil content accumulation in B. napus [42]. WRI1 was studied as a member of a plant-specific family of TFs (AP2/EREBP) involved in fatty acid production at the onset of the seed maturation phase in Arabidopsis [43]. ABI4 was found to encode an AP2/ERF TF involved in lipid mobilization in Arabidopsis embryos [44]. A bZIP family TF, bZIP53, was shown to form a ternary complex with bZIP10 or bZIP25 and ABI3, and promoted the expressions of seed maturation genes and lipid accumulations [45]. Overexpression of GmMYB73 was shown to enhance the lipid contents of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds and enhanced oil production in legume crop plants [46]. Barthole et al. [47] suggested that MYB118 repressing LEC2 expressions influenced FA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Oleosin genes were found to be directly linked to FA synthesis (e.g., CAC1, CAC2, CAC3, FAD3, KASI, MOD1, mtACP1, and mtACP2) and lipid transfer (ACBP1, ACBP2, ACBP6, LTP1, LTP2, LTP3, LTP5, and LTP6) genes in the co-expression network. Bhatla et al. [48] suggested that the co-expression of oleosins and genes involved in TAG biosynthesis increased oil contents. These results suggested that oleosin genes, TFs, and lipid transport-related genes form a complex network that helps to co-regulate seed oil accumulation in B. napus."
