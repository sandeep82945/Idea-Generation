 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the impact of different heating rates (in addition to final temperature) on the molecular structure changes in medium-rank coals. The current study only looked at one heating rate. Varying the rate may provide additional insights. 

2. Conduct a similar molecular structure analysis on coals of different ranks (low, medium, high) to see how the structural changes differ across coal types during heat treatment.

3. Incorporate other analytical techniques like NMR or XPS to complement the FTIR findings and gain additional molecular-level details about the heat-induced changes. 

4. Study the relationship between the observed structural changes and coal reactivity/combustion behavior. Connect the molecular transformations to macroscale performance.

5. Extend the work by analyzing the tars, gases, and chars generated during pyrolysis/gasification of the heat-treated coals. Characterize the products and link back to the starting structure of the coal.
