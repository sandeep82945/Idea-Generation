 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct empirical research to validate the causal loop diagram model and refine it based on data. This could involve surveys, interviews, and analysis of real-world data from higher education institutions.

2. Study the long-term co-evolution of AI and higher education institutions using computational modeling and simulations based on the causal loop diagram. This could provide insights into future scenarios.

3. Investigate effective policies and strategies for higher education institutions to leverage AI opportunities and mitigate risks. For example, study the impact of different approaches to dealing with academic integrity issues. 

4. Examine the skills that will be most complementary to AI in the future job market across different occupations. Develop frameworks to guide higher education curricula and programs.

5. Explore novel higher education business models and value propositions suited for a future with advanced AI and increased automation. Study how higher education institutions can create value and remain viable and sustainable.
