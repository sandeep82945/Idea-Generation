 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the tissue-specific effects of ursolic acid on different nuclear receptors. The paper notes that ursolic acid can have opposing effects on the same receptor in different cell types, suggesting more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this selectivity. 

2. Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of ursolic acid in treating metabolic disorders in humans. The paper summarizes promising results from animal and cell studies, but human clinical data is still lacking. 

3. Investigate whether ursolic acid derivatives or analogs could have improved potency or selectivity for certain nuclear receptors. Medicinal chemistry approaches could potentially optimize ursolic acid's drug-like properties.

4. Study combinations of ursolic acid with other nuclear receptor modulators for potential synergistic effects. The paper hints at beneficial interactions when ursolic acid is combined with other compounds.

5. Assess the long-term safety of ursolic acid treatment, since nuclear receptors play diverse physiological roles. Though it appears quite safe based on current data, thorough toxicology studies in animals and eventually humans will be important.
