    "abstractText": "Background: Hepatectomy for patients with Fontan circulation consists of high central venous pressure and low pulmonary vascular resistance, and is challenging for physicians. Case presentation: We performed anesthetic management for hepatectomy in three patients with Fontan circulation. Massive bleeding and transfusion as well as careful management were needed. Open abdominal surgery had to be conducted instead of laparoscopic surgery for controlling bleeding in one case. We successfully performed general anesthesia using nitric oxide and inotropes while monitoring arterial pressure and central venous pressure in all the cases. Conclusions: To maintain Fontan circulation during hepatectomy, it is important to manage central venous pressure and ensure appropriate circulatory volume.",

            "text": "Fontan circulation is an iatrogenic and definitive palliative condition for patients with single-ventricle physiology, wherein venous blood returns to the pulmonary circulation without passing through the right ventricle. The central venous pressure (CVP) drives the pressure of the pulmonary circulation, which must have low pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). With the recent improvement in survival rate after Fontan surgery, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most emerging complications. Impaired hepatic oxygen delivery and increased CVP appear to pathophysiological mechanism of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in Fontan physiology [1]. Several case reports of hepatic resection in patients with Fontan circulation have been reported earlier, but information on its perioperative anesthetic management is sparse [2\u20135, 7\u201310]."

In addition to standard monitoring, invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) via radial artery, CVP, central venous blood oxygen saturation (ScvO2), and stroke volume variation (SVV) were observed with the use of the FloTrac\u2122/-HemoSphere\u2122 system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We maintained a train-of-four (TOF) count of 1 or less as the levels of neuromuscular blockade. Dobutamine 2\u20134\u00a0 \u00b5g/kg/min and nitric oxide 5\u00a0 ppm were continuously administered through infusion and inhalation, respectively. We maintained pressure control ventilation (PCV), with pressure at 13\u201318 cmH2O, and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O. Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was maintained at 35\u201345\u00a0mmHg. Pneumoperitoneal pressure was set at 8\u00a0mmHg.

ScvO2 was stable between 66 and 78% during surgery, and between 74 and 86% after extubation. SVV was remained between 5 and 13%. The intraoperative blood loss was 2,650\u00a0 g. Rectus sheath block and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) using fentanyl were performed for postoperative pain management. Extubation was performed smoothly about 30\u00a0min after the operation.

            "text": "In recent years, some case reports describe the anesthetic contrivance against hepatectomy for the patient with Fontan physiology. Maeda, et\u00a0 al. reported that continuous thoracic paravertebral block was effective for perioperative pain management and hemodynamic stability [2]. In our cases, case 1 and 2 were lower postoperative NRS than case 3 and obtained stable hemodynamic to conduct peripheral nerve brock. This result is consistent the effect of nerve block as Maeda\u2019s report. Saito, et\u00a0 al. reported successful management of laparoscopic surgery using noninvasive monitoring system, such as a pulse contour cardiac output catheter [10]. We also conducted ABP, CVP, ScvO2, SVV, and TEE monitoring to assess Fontan circulation as a hemodynamic monitoring. However, to the best of our knowledge, there was no report of laparoscopic surgery which had to be converted open abdominal surgery for intraoperative massive bleeding as in case 3. We compare our cases each other and discuss the perioperative anesthetic management focused on CVP, intraoperative blood loss, and hemodynamic stability.\nOne concerns for hepatectomy with Fontan circulation is that high CVP might cause large amount of bleeding from the dissection surface while CVP is driving pressure of pulmonary circulation. Moreover, liver dysfunction and anticoagulation increase the risk of bleeding. We managed intraoperative CVP and Hb at preoperative levels\nto maintain Fontan circulation in fluid management and blood transfusion, as in previous case reports [3\u20135]. Ideal intraoperative CVP should be prioritized for Fontan circulation. However, some studies have suggested that the recommended CVP is less than 4\u00a0mmHg for hepatectomy without Fontan circulation, which is a conflicting management for patients with Fontan circulation [6]. The intraoperative blood loss in our cases ranged from 1,181 to 2,850\u00a0g, while other studies have reported an intraoperative blood loss of 100\u20134,100\u00a0 g [2\u20135, 7\u201310]. The blood loss was not always massive even with high preoperative CVP and an open abdominal surgery, as in case 2. Although pneumoperitoneum could decrease blood loss by increasing the intraabdominal pressure, pneumoperitoneal pressure was set modestly due to concerns about increasing the intrathoracic pressure in our patients. The tumor location, size, and ease of surgery might also affect the amount of bleeding. Laparoscopic surgery was administered according to the predictor of surgical difficulty such as extent of resection and location of tumor, even though Fontan physiology [11]. However, we should have preoperative discussions that involve cardiologists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists, and prepare the patients for possible conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery if the massive bleeding disturbs the surgical field.\nWe adjusted intraoperative inotropes when the BP was low, even though CVP was maintained. Although noradrenaline was administered to maintain the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in cases 2 and 3, it should be administered carefully because high doses of noradrenaline increase PVR. Vasopressin may help in maintaining SVR without increasing PVR. We administered and adjusted dobutamine to support cardiac contraction in cases 1 and 3 after evaluating heart contractility.\nIn the present three cases, SVV and TEE monitoring besides CVP were conducted to evaluate circulating blood volume. Moreover, ScvO2 was conducted to evaluate Fontan circulation. The information from FloTrac\u2122/-HemoSphere\u2122 system and TEE may help in decision-making, because it is monitoring mixed venous blood oxygen saturation and CI from the Swan-Ganz catheter in the Fontan circulation is difficult. In cases 1 and 2, ScvO2 was higher after extubation than during surgery. This might suggest that spontaneous respiration is ideal for Fontan physiology. SVV was remained approximately 13% in our three cases, even though the massive bleeding as in case 3. After all, ABP and CVP might be the most sensitive and useful parameters to manage circulation volume during massive bleeding. It is unclear whether SVV estimates the circulation volume or not, because the algorithm of SVV does not include Fontan circulation. There are few reports of assessing fluid responsiveness using SVV in patients with Fontan circulation. Further studies are needed in this regard.\nAbbreviations ABP: Arterial blood pressure; APTT: Activated partial thromboplastin time; BP: Blood pressure; CI: Cardiac index; CVP: Central venous pressure; EF: Ejection fraction; FALD: Fontan associated liver disease; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; Hb: Hemoglobin; HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; HR: Heart rate; IVPCA: Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia; MAC: Minimum alveolar concentration; NRS: Numerical rating scale; PaCO2: Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide; PCV: Pressure control ventilation; PEEP: Positive end expiratory pressure; PTINR: International normalized ration of partial thrombin time; PVR: Pulmonary vascular resistance; RCC : Red cell concentrate; ScvO2: Central venous blood oxygen saturation; SpO2: Oxygen saturation; SVV: Stroke volume variation; TOF: Train-of-four; TEE: Transesophageal echocardiography; TTE: Transthoracic echocardiography.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Editage (www. edita ge. com) for English language editing.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions MS, NK, TA, and YT anesthetized the patient, wrote the original draft, and edited the later versions.
