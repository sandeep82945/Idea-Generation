    "abstractText": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of implant scanbody (ISB) wear on the accuracy of digital impression for complete-arch. A polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) edentulous mandibular model with four internal hexagonal interlocking conical connections was scanned with an extraoral optical scanner to achieve a reference file. Four cylindrical polyetheretherketone (PEEK) ISBs were scanned 30 times with IOS, and the test files were aligned to the reference file with a best-fit algorithm. For each analog linear (\u2206X, \u2206Y and \u2206Z-axis) and angular deviations (\u2206ANGLE) were assessed. Euclidean distance (\u2206EUC) was calculated from the linear deviation, reporting a mean of 82 \u03bcm (SD 61) ranging from 8 to 347 \u03bcm. \u2206ANGLE error mean was 0.33\u25e6 (SD 0.20), ranging from 0.02 to 0.92\u25e6. From a multivariate analysis, when \u2206EUC was considered as a response variable, a significant influence of ISB wear by scan number in interaction to position for implant 3.6 was identified (p < 0.0001); when \u2206ANGLE was considered as a response variable, a significant effect of position 3.6 was recorded ((p < 0.0001). The obtained results showed that the ISB wear negatively influenced the accuracy of IOS, suggesting that ISB base wear could be detrimental for the seating of ISBs on angulated implants.",

            "text": "Dental impressions certainly represent a crucial step in implant dentistry [1]. Inaccurate record and transfer of the implant position can lead to an ill-fitting prosthesis, which may result in both biological and mechanical complications [2]. Passive fit, defined as a clinical condition in which the prosthesis is not responsible for static loads in the prosthetic system or in the surrounding bone tissue, directly depends on the accuracy of the impression technique [3\u20135]. As defined by ISO-5725-1:1994, the accuracy of intraoral digital optical scanning (IOS) consists of trueness and precision. Trueness means the deviation from the true dimensions of the object, while precision describes how much different scans of the same object differ from each other [6,7]. Currently, IOS is potentially considered an alternative to the conventional implant impression to improve patient comfort and speed up workflow [8,9], advantageous features that are also applicable in the field of orthodontics and traditional prosthesis [10,11]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that digital impressions are sufficiently accurate in tiny spaces; however, in more wide spaces such as those typically associated with edentulous patients, the results are less impressive\nMaterials 2022, 15, 927. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15030927 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nin terms of both accuracy and speed [6]. The lack of stable reference points, teeth or keratinized mucosa; the minor amount of attached gingiva; and unfavorable conditions such as the presence of saliva, tongue and cheek movements all represent sources of inaccuracy [12,13]. Implant scanbody (ISB) are supplied to determine intraorally a positioning and orientation of an osseointegrated implant [3]. An ISB is commonly made up of three distinct components: the scan region, which is the upper one and responsible for digitally registering the three-dimensional orientation and angulation of an implant [14,15]; the body, which joins the scan region to the base; the base, which is the apical one and liable for creating the mating surface between implant and ISB. Generally, the scan region is made by the same material of the body, such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK), titanium alloy, aluminum alloy, and various resins. It is also characterized by one or multiple scan areas, but most commonly by a single flat side in order to index the ISB and improve the recognition by the CAD software [14,16]. Instead, the base can be made, or not, by the same material as the body [14]. A mismatch in materials between the base and the implant may influence displacement of the ISB when tightened into place [17]. The wear of this component through repeated use and sterilization may also cause changes in positioning over time, which could be problematic as the overall fit of any ISB is a decisive factor for a high-precision transfer of the implant position and inclination [18,19]. To our knowledge, the influence of wear resulting from ISB\u2019s repositioning on the implant over the IOS impression accuracy was never investigated, and no reference data are currently available in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of ISB\u2019s wear on the accuracy of the IOS impression."

Thirty complete-arch scans were performed by a single operator, who underwent theoretical\u2013practical training by scanning the test model ten times as recommended by the producer (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). The ISBs were screwed and unscrewed between the individual thirty scan sessions. The torque of 10 Ncm of ISBs onto the prosthetic connection was standardized for each screwing cycle and was controlled by a second operator means a dynamometer. Moreover, the correct coupling between ISBs bases and analog heads was visually checked through magnifying loupes (Eyezoom 5X, Orascoptic, Middleton, WI, USA). Every scan started from the analog in position 4.7, while the 3.6 was the last one to be scanned. Before the scan, 3D and color calibrations were performed as suggested by the producer. The scan strategy recommended by the producer was accomplished as follows: to prevent image splitting in the anterior area, a wave movement was made, and a 45\u25e6 pen inclination indicatively was used. Firstly, ISB occlusal\u2013palatal surfaces were scanned, followed by the buccal aspect and any other missing areas. Thirty test STL files were obtained by scan procedure (Figure 3)."

The alignment of each test scan with the reference scan depends on negative and positive values. By considering the reference axis system used, the data must be interpreted as follows: negative values on the X, Y and Z axis featured a scan body positioned frontward, left and downward, respectively, while the positive ones are in the opposite direction on each axis. The univariate analysis showed the following results: \u2206Y mean \u221223 \u00b5m (SD 75) ranging from \u2212333 to 65 \u00b5m; \u2206X average \u221212 \u00b5m (SD 51) ranging from \u2212150 to 83 \u00b5m; \u2206Z mean \u221210 \u00b5m (SD 39) ranging from \u2212223 to 43 \u00b5m. When the linear discrepancy was considered a tridimensional one, \u2206EUC reported these results: mean 82 \u00b5m (SD 61) ranging from 8 to 347 \u00b5m. Lastly, the \u2206ANGLE error mean was 0.33\u25e6 (SD 0.20), ranging from 0.02 to 0.92\u25e6 (Table 1).\nThe error distribution was centered on the reference measurement for the X, Y and Z-axis, while it was moved towards the right (positive bias) for the angulation and threedimensional (3D) deviation as they were calculated on absolute values. For the multivariate analysis, when \u2206EUC was considered as a response variable, a significant influence of ISB\u2019s wear by scans in interaction with position 3.6 was identified (p < 0.0001), while no significant effect of position and of the scans related to other positions was detected (Table 2) (Figure 5).\nThe graph in Figure 6 shows the influence of the three different linear deltas (\u2206X-\u2206Y\u2206Z) of the implant in position 3.6 in correlation to the 30 different scans; the major error is related to \u2206Y followed by \u2206X.\nWhen \u2206ANGLE was considered as a response variable, a significant influence of ISB\u2019s wear on position 3.6 was identified (p < 0.0001), while no significant effect of the other positions and the scans correlated to the position was detected (Table 3) (Figure 7)."

            "text": "Currently, implant-supported prostheses are considered a reliable and effective treatment option to replace natural missing teeth [20]. In order to transfer the three-dimensional implant position, an accurate impression represent a crucial step in implant treatment [21]. IOS was suggested to be a reliable alternative in the clinical practice to conventional impression methods in the manufacture of implant-supported crowns and short-span fixed dental prostheses [22]. Moreover, digital implant impressions could offer advantages over conventional impressions, such as reduced risks of distortion during the impression and laboratory phases, improved patient comfort and acceptance, and improved time efficiency [23,24]. However, digital workflow is still subject to errors, which could derive from the digital impression and CAD/CAM software, as well as production (subtractive or additive) manufacturing processes. These last still depend on the accuracy of the impression and master model. IOS represents a fundamental part of the digital workflow; therefore, accuracy is an essential requirement [6]. The influence of ISB design on the accuracy of IOS is not altogether understood [14]. As mentioned, in single-crown or short-\nspan restorations, digital implant scans using ISBs are shown to have similar accuracy as conventional impressions [25]. However, in completely edentulous patients, a decrease in accuracy was shown [26]. Indeed, in attempting to scan an edentulous arch with ISBs, one specific challenge is the limited number of quality reference points between the scan bodies [27]. ISBs materials and shape were proved to influence the overall accuracy of the digitized data [3,27,28]. To the best of our knowledge, the influence of ISB wear on the accuracy of IOS for the complete arch was never analyzed. Therefore, the purpose of this in vitro trial was precisely to evaluate the influence of PEEK ISBs wear on the overall accuracy of digital impression. This was carried out by evaluating the linear and angular deviation of each ISB compared to the reference data that were previously obtained by a reference scan obtained by a dedicated extraoral scanner with high precision. The ISBs were subject to 30 screwing and unscrewing cycles before each corresponding scan, and the deviations were assessed for each ISB for a total of 120 test data. The obtained results showed that the ISB wear, considering \u2206EUC, influenced the accuracy of IOS in interaction with the ISB position. In particular, tilted implant analogs\u2019 (3.6\u201317\u25e6 and 4.7\u201330\u25e6 mesial angulation) accuracy were negatively influenced, with a statistically significant interaction noticed for position 3.6 (p < 0.0001). Considering \u2206ANGLE, a statistically significant effect of position 3.6 was recorded (p < 0.0001). These data suggested that ISB base wear could be detrimental to the seating of ISBs on angulated implants. That could be explained by the physical properties of the PEEK material, that as a polymer, could be worn out after repeated mechanical strains, especially at the base level. Furthermore, implants with greater inclination were subjected to loss of accuracy after repeated use, probably because of the higher strain generated during the screwing and unscrewing procedures leading to a collapse of the ISB position towards the inclination direction of the implant. According to the results of the present study, a statistically significant correlation between position and scan number was noticed for position 3.6. For this reason, the distribution of linear discrepancies for implant in the position of 3.6 related to all 30 scans was further investigated, showing a greater deviation contribution on the Y- (lateral) and X-axis (longitudinal), recording the implant position more distally and lingually, precisely towards the implant inclination direction. This would support the hypothesis that an ISB made by a plastic material could be worn out after repeated use and that an ISB with a worn-out base could be detrimental in recording the position of tilted implants, as a structural failure could be recorded according to the direction of the implant tilting. These conclusions are limited to the IOS and ISB material analyzed and do not consider the implications that the sterilization cycles could have on the material wear.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.A. and F.L.; methodology, L.A.; software, V.C. and V.M.; validation, L.A., A.N. and M.G.; formal analysis, A.N.; investigation, F.R.F. and V.C.; resources, F.R.F. and V.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.A.; supervision, M.G.; project administration, L.A.
