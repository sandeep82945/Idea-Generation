    "abstractText": "By utilising Gaia EDR3 photometric/astrometric data, we studied the dynamical evolution from the obtained astrophysical, structural and dynamical parameters of the open clusters (OCs), Berkeley 10 (Be 10), Berkeley 81 (Be 81), Berkeley 89 (Be 89), and Ruprecht 135 (Ru 135). The Gaia EDR3 photometric distances from the isochrone fitting method are smaller than the ones of Gaia EDR2. The relaxation times of four OCs are smaller than their ages, in this regard, they are dynamically relaxed. Their steep overall mass function slopes mean that their low mass stars outnumber their massive ones. Their large \u03c4/relatively small trlx values imply an advanced mass segregation. Therefore, they seem to have lost their low-mass stars much to the field. Be 89\u2019s outer parts indicate an expansion with time. However, Be 10 and Be 81 show the relatively shrinkage core/cluster radii due to dynamical evolution. Ru 135 (1.0 Gyr) may have a primordial origin, instead of shrinking in size and mass with time. Be 89\u2019s tidal radius is less than its cluster radius. This means that its member stars lie within its tidal radius, in the sense it is gravitationally bound to the cluster. For the rest OCs, the cluster members beyond their tidal radii are gravitationally unbound to the clusters, which are more influenced by the potential of the Galaxy.",

The Gaia EDR3 photometric distances from the isochrone fitting method are smaller than the ones of Gaia EDR2. The relaxation times of four OCs are smaller than their ages, in this regard, they are dynamically relaxed. Their steep overall mass function slopes mean that their low mass stars outnumber their massive ones. Their large \u03c4/relatively small trlx values imply an advanced mass segregation. Therefore, they seem to have lost their low-mass stars much to the field. Be 89\u2019s outer parts indicate an expansion with time. However, Be 10 and Be 81 show the relatively shrinkage core/cluster radii due to dynamical evolution. Ru 135 (1.0 Gyr) may have a primordial origin, instead of shrinking in size and mass with time. Be 89\u2019s tidal radius is less than its cluster radius. This means that its member stars lie within its tidal radius, in the sense it is gravitationally bound to the cluster. For the rest OCs, the cluster members beyond their tidal radii are gravitationally unbound to the clusters, which are more influenced by the potential of the Galaxy.\nKeywords: (Galaxy:) open clusters and associations:general, (Galaxy:) open clusters and associations: individual, Galaxy: stellar content\n\u2217Corresponding author Email address: hcakmak@istanbul.edu.tr (Hikmet \u00c7akmak)\nPreprint submitted to New Astronomy April 22, 2022\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n07 74\n5v 3\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]"

            "text": "Cluster members of the OCs evolve dynamically due to internal (mass loss during stellar evolution, mass segregation, evaporation) and external perturbations such as encounters with the disk and Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), spiral arm shocks, and tidal stripping due to the galactic potential. The OCs lose a significant fraction of their primordial masses through via these processes (Lamers & Gieles , 2006) and (Gieles et al. , 2007). As emphasized by Converse & Stahler (2011), inner cores of star clusters contract, and thus their outer parts expand by transferring energy to the outer skirts. In the sense mass segregation drives the low mass stars to the outer parts of the clusters. Most of the original mass are lost to the field because of dynamical effects along the several Myrs since their formation.\nFrom the analysis of Gaia EDR3 data of 389 OCs, Tarricq et al. (2021) report that the cluster dimensions and mass segregation depend on cluster ages, in this regard, their core radii are on the average small for old OCs. They also state that mass segregation is more effective in old OCs.\nIn this paper we study the dynamical evolution of Be 81, Ru 135, Be 10, and Be 89 from Gaia EDR3 photometric/astrometric data. The first two are located in the inner galaxy and the other two are outside the solar circle. These old-aged OCs have been selected as representatives of first and second galactic quadrants in Fig. 1, where their positions relative to the spiral arms are displayed. Location criterion is important due to the survival rate of the OCs. As discussed by Bonatto & Bica (2007b) and G\u00fcne\u015f et al. (2017), the majority of OCs with age > 1 Gyr lie outside the solar circle. The OCs inside the solar circle are scarce in the direction of galactic centre, due to the effects of strong absorption/crowding/dissolution by GMCs. Bonatto & Bica (2007b) reported a deficiency of OCs older than 0.85 Gyr inside solar radius. Within the framework of these issues, the astrophysical parameters (reddening, distance, age), structural parameters (RRDP , Rcore), tidal radii (Rt), overall masses, mass function slopes (\u03c7, MFs), time scales (relaxation time trlx, evolutionary parameter \u03c4 , dissociation time tdis) of these OCs have been derived. Our sample OCs were studied before in the literature with 2MASS JHKs and UBVRI photometries (Table 2). Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020) also provided their astrophysical parameters from Gaia DR2 data.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. The separation of the cluster members is explained in Section 2. The determination of reddenings, distance moduli/distances, ages, and structural parameters of four OCs is\ngiven in Section 3. Masses/mass function slopes, time scales (relaxation and dissolution times and evolutionary parameters), tidal radii, half-mass radii of four OCs are presented in Sections 4-5. Kinematics and orbital parameters are given in Section 6. A Discussion/Conclusion is presented in Section 7."

(2018) have been downloaded for a large-area (10 arcmin) from VizieR1. On the (\u00b5\u03b1, \u00b5\u03b4) diagrams (Fig. 2), the potential cluster members show a more concentrated structure, whereas field stars have a more scattered distribution. We have applied Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) (Pedregosa et al. , 2011) to the cluster stars. During GMM model trials, more than two suitable components were selected to clearly obtaion the central density in the vector point\n1http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=II/246.\ndiagrams. Thus, the membership probabilities P(%) of each cluster have been determined appropriately. The first significant rise in Fig. 3 is taken into account as the membership percentage (vertical dashed blue line). From Fig. 3, the probable members of four OCs seem to have greater than 85%. The GMM 2 model considers that the distribution of proper motions of the stars in a cluster\u2019s region can be represented by two elliptical bivariate Gaussians. For the used parameters, see the papers of Balaguer-Nunez et al. (1998), Wu et al. (2002), Sariya et al. (2012) and Dias et al. (2018). The median proper motion components, the median parallaxes/distances, and the member numbers of four OCs are presented in Table 1. Instead of\n2P is defined \u03a6c /\u03a6. Here \u03a6 = \u03a6c + \u03a6f is the total probability distribution. c and f subscripts for cluster and field parameters, respectively. The used parameters for estimation of \u03a6c and \u03a6f are \u00b5\u03b1, \u00b5\u03b4, $, \u03c3\u00b5\u03b1, \u03c3\u00b5\u03b4, \u03c3$.\nthe inverse of Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, we averaged the parallaxes of cluster stars and then get the posterior probability density functions(PDFs) from those reduced errors, given by Bailer-Jones et al. (2018, 2021). For this, the global zero point is taken as \u22120.017 mas (Lindegren et al. , 2021). Within the uncertainties, all the values are consistent with each other within the uncertainties, as compared to Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018, 2020) (bottom row). The estimated median equatorial coordinates from the likely members of our OCs and their corresponding galactic coordinates are listed in Table 1. These coordinates are similar to those of WEBDA (Mermilliod , 1992)."

            "text": "The astrophysical parameters from the probable members of four OCs have been determined by fitting the observational (G,GBP \u2212 GRP ) colourmagnitude diagrams (CMDs) to the PARSEC isochrones of Bressan et al. (2012) (hereafter B12). Magrini et al. (2015) give the spectroscopic metal abundance of Be 81 as [Fe/H] = +0.23 \u00b1 0.08. This corresponds to heavy element abundance Z = 0.025. For the rest OCs, their spectroscopic metal abundances are not available in the literature. Therefore, several iterations by taking the isochrones of three heavy element abundances (Z = 0.008, 0.0152, 0.025) together with an appropriate age are performed on the Gaia CMDs. The isochrones with (Z,Age (Myr)) = (0.008, 1350) for Be 10, (0.025, 1600) for Be 81, (0.0152, 3200) for Be 89, and (0.0152, 1000) for Ru 135, respectively provide satisfactory fits (Figs. 4-5). The PARSEC isochrones are shifted both vertically and horizontally on the Gaia CMDs to obtain the best fit to the observed main sequence, as well as the RG/RC (Red Giant/Red Clump) sequence, according to the interstellar reddening values of E(GBP\u2212GRP ) (Col. 2 of Table 2). Thus, distance modulus DM = (V0\u2212MV ) and age are obtained. The distance moduli (V0 \u2212MV ), distances d(pc) and ages (Myr) of four OCs are given in Cols. 5-7 of Table 2. Their E(B\u2212V )\u2019s are converted from their E(GBP \u2212GRP )\u2019s via E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.775E(GBP \u2212GRP ) (Wang & Chen , 2019).\nThe stellar radial density profiles (RDPs) of four OCs are constructed from the Gaia EDR3 photometric/astrometric data for cluster members and the field within 10\u2032.0 down to G = 19 mag. From the RDPs, their structural\nparameters are derived. The fitted RDPs of four OCs to the relation of King (1966) are given in Fig. 6. For this, the three-parameter function (King , 1966),\n\u03c3(R) = \u03c3bg + \u03c30\n1 + ( R Rcore )2\nis considered. For this equation, \u03c3bg is the residual background density. \u03c30 and Rcore are the central density of stars and the core radius, respectively. Thus, the Rcore, \u03c3bg, and \u03c30 of four OCs have been derived by fitting King profile to the observational RDPs (Fig. 6). The meanings of solid line, horizontal bar and the shaded area are mentioned in caption of Fig. 6.\nTheir cluster radii (RRDP ) by comparing the RDP level with background and by measuring the distance from the centre (Bonatto & Bica , 2007a) are determined. The RRDP is taken as an observational truncation radius, whose value depends both on the radial distribution of member stars and the field density. The large uncertainties within R < 1\u2032 in the RDPs are due to their low star contents in their central parts. The density contrast parameter (\u03b4c) to estimate the compactness of the clusters is obtained from the relation,\n\u03b4c = 1 + \u03c30 \u03c3bg\nAs emphasized by Bica & Bonatto (2005), the \u03b4c values of the OCs depend on the Galactic latitude than the cluster mass, accordingly, the populous and high Galactic latitude OCs have large density contrast parameters, i.e.:\nNGC 188 (b = +22.\u25e639,\u223c 3800M ) and M 67 (b = +31.\u25e689,\u223c 990M ). Different Galactic latitudes have different properties and also suffer from differences in density contrast, since low-Galactic latitude OCs tend to be projected against denser fore/backgrounds. As compared to the range (7 \u2264 \u03b4c \u2264 23), which is found from compact star clusters by Bonatto (2009), our \u03b4c values are lower. This indicates that our OCs with low-latitude are sparse. These structural parameters and their meanings together with the literature values are listed in rows 1-9 of Table 3.\nAs compared to literature values (bottom rows of Table 3), for theRcore(pc)\u2019s of Be 10, Be 81 and Ru 135, there is in a reasonable agreement with the ones of Bukowiecki et al. (2011) within the uncertainties. Be 89\u2019s Rcore value is somewhat larger than Bukowiecki et al. (2011). Kharchenko et al. (2013) give a large Rcore (pc) value for Be 81 and Ru 135. For Be 10 and Be 89,\ntheir Rcore (pc) values are in good agreement with our findings within the error bars. Our RRDP values for Be 89 and Ru 135 are quite larger than the 8.23 pc value of Bukowiecki et al. (2011). Within the error limits, our (Rcore, RRDP ) values for Be 10 are in consistent with the ones of Maciejewski & Niedzielski (2007). For Be 81, Sagar & Griffiths (1998) give a slightly small RRDP (pc) value."

Gmagnitudes of main sequence members have been converted into the absolute magnitudes from their reddenings and distance moduli (Cols. 2 and 5 of Table 2). Mass function (MF) is defined as the distribution of masses of cluster stars per unit volume. The mass functions in terms of 0.05 bin sizes are shown in Fig. 7. The MF slope is fitted to a power-law given by,\nlog dN\ndM = \u2212(1 + x) log(M) + constant\nWhere dN is the probable cluster members in a mass bin dM with central mass M and x is mass function slope. Since Gaia data (G mag) is not complete below G = 19 mag (Arenou et al. , 2018), stars brighter than this limit are taken, which correspond to stars more massive than 1 M . The obtained MF slopes are x = 1.46\u00b10.60, 2.88\u00b10.93, 1.24\u00b10.90 and 1.99\u00b10.44 for Be 10, Be 81, Be 89, and Ru 135, respectively. The MFs of Be 10 and Be 89 are consistent with \u03c7 = 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 of Kroupa (2001) with the uncertainties. Total masses are obtained from the MF slopes of four OCs. The mass range, MF slope, total mass, mean mass, and member number are listed in Cols. 2- 6 of Table 4. In order to see the mass-segregation effects of four OCs, the normalized cumulative radial stellar distributions of member stars for three mass ranges against cluster radius (arcmin) have been displayed in Fig. 8. For Be 10, bright stars (high mass ones) slightly outnumber low mass/fainter counterparts throughout the inner parts. Towards its outer parts, low-mass stars dominate. For Be 81 and Be 89, high mass stars outnumber low mass counterparts throughout the entire cluster radius. For Ru 135\u2019core region, high mass stars slightly outnumber low-mass stars. For 1 < r(arcmin) < 4, intermediate mass stars seem to be dominant over low mass ones. Towards\nits skirts, high mass stars slightly outnumber the low mass ones. During the lifetime of the OCs, encounters between its member stars lead to an increased degree of energy equipartition. Thus, the high mass stars sink towards the\ncluster center and transfer their kinetic energy to the low-mass stars, thus leading to mass segregation.\nSome factors such as age, distance and selection of bright (high mass) stars are effective in these trends. As stated by Tarricq et al. (2021), old OCs are mass segregated than young OCs. Old OCs with a significant number of stars show strong mass segregation ratio. These old OCs are on the average older than the OCs with few stars which show strongly mass segregation. Cluster stars in the outer skirts of old OCs are on average lower than for young ones. In the sense the proportion of stars in the outer parts of the OCs decreases towards old ages. Besides this, bright/high mass stars are more likely to be selected than faint stars when distinguishing cluster members. In accordance with that, especially in the core region, there is a possibility that faint stars will not be selected as cluster members, due to the\nhigh density of stars. Therefore, there may be a bias in favor of bright stars. Distance is a problem for observing faint stars, due to dense dust."

As the cluster goes near its perigalacticon, a star at a large distance from the cluster center will be detached by galactic tidal forces whereas a star at a small distance will not. In other words, the tidal radius is linked to the stripping of stars from the cluster by the Galactic tidal field.

Our distances for Be 89 and Ru 135 are larger but small for Be 81, as compared to the ones of the CCD-based UBV RI. For Be 10, the distance of Lata et al. (2004) is larger than our value.

For Ru 135, the discrepancy is somewhat larger, up to \u223c 1000 Myr. The potential sources of discrepancies between our findings and the literature are of the adopted isochrones and the reddening values, the ground-based astrometric data, and different procedures for the selection of member stars, respectively, as stated by Paunzen & Netopil (2006) and Moitinho (2010)."

On average, larger cluster radii have larger core radii. Note that our OCs with old ages are prone to have small core radii, as shown by Tarricq et al. (2021). Here as an approximation, a value of (Rcore, RRDP ) = (1.5, 7) pc of G\u00fcne\u015f et al. (2017) is taken into account in classifying the cluster dimensions as small and large.\nThe dissociation times of four OCs are higher than their relaxation times (Fig. 11c/Col. 6 of Table 6). This necessarily mean that four OCs disintegrate very early in the initial phase of quick expansion that accompanies the death of their most massive (bright) stars, as stated by Converse & Stahler (2011). The relaxation times of four OCs are smaller than their ages (Col. 5 of Table 4 and Col. 7 of Table 2), from this respective, they are dynamically relaxed. The steep overall MF slopes of four OCs (Fig. 11d) mean that their low mass stars outnumber their massive ones (Fig. 7 and Fig. 11d). Their large \u03c4 and relatively small trlx values imply an advanced mass segregation. On account of this, their low mass stars are being lost to the field.\nFollowing the works of Camargo et al. (2009); G\u00fcne\u015f et al. (2017); Cakmak et al. (2021), four OCs are plotted on (Rcore, RRDP ) versus Age (Myr) (panels (e-f) of Fig. 11). This relationship is related to survival and dissociation rates of clusters (Camargo et al., 2009). The meanings of the symbols are explained in caption of Fig. 11. Because Be 89 locates in R2 region (panels e\u2212f), its core/outer parts show an expansion with time. However, Be 10 and Be 81 indicate the relatively shrinkage core/cluster radii (R4).\nBe 81 and Ru 135 locate in solar circle, and they are survived although they expose much to the external dynamical effects. Ru 135 (1.0 Gyr) with the small dimensions shrunk in size and mass with time, as it lost its star content because of the presence of massive GMCs, and tidal effects from disk and Bulge crossings as external perturbations, taking care its direction (` = 16\u25e6, RGC = 7.5 kpc). Instead of shrinking in size and mass with time, Ru 135 may have a primordial origin which may be related to high molecular gas density in Galactic directions (Camargo et al., 2009; van den Berg et al. , 1991).\nFor our sample OCs, the relations, Rcore versus log (\u03c4) and Rt versus RRDP (pc), respectively are presented in Fig. 12(a)\u2212(b). Four OCs are in concordance with the decreasing trend between Rcore and log(\u03c4) (panel a). As stated by Angelo et al. (2020, 2021), this trend points out that our OCs with old ages are dynamically evolved, and they are losing their star contents to the field, due to internal/external dynamical processes. Be 89\u2019s tidal radius is less than its cluster radius (Fig. 12b/Tables 3 and 5). This means that its member stars lie within its tidal radius, in the sense it is gravitationally bound to the cluster. For Be 10, Be 81 and Ru 135, their tidal radii are larger than their cluster radii. Thus, the cluster members beyond their tidal radii are gravitationally unbound to the cluster. The cluster members outside their tidal radii are more influenced by external potential of the Galaxy.\nThe expected masses of four OCs based on its peri-galacticon distance/its tidal radius are obtained from the relation (King , 1962),\nMc = 3.5MG ( Rt Rmin )3 where Rmin andMG is the peri-galacticon distance and the Galaxy mass. Rt, MG, and Rmin, respectively, are taken from Tables 4\u22125. With these values, their expected masses have been calculated as 214 M (Be 10), 248 M (Be 81), 716 M (Be 89), and 181 M (Ru 135), respectively. For instance, the expected mass 214 M in Be 10 decreases to \u223c 110M (observed stellar total mass), because mass-loss processes such as evaporation and the external dynamical effects which have been acting on Be 10 for about 1.3 Gyr.\nThe orbits of Be 10 (Fig. 8) indicate that it passed a part of its time at galactosentric radius, RGC = 9.69 kpc, and then it was born at R = 10.08 kpc, which would explain its solar abundance. According to the ([M/H]) versus R (kpc) of Lepine et al. (2011), Be 10 occupies a region of R > 9 kpc (co-rotation gap at 9 kpc). In the sense its origin may be attributed to different galactic radius or different star formation region (Lepine et al. , 2011)."
