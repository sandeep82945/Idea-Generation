Expansion to Other Commercial Property Types: While this study focused on retail real estate, particularly shopping centers, future research could explore the impact of governmental restrictions on other types of commercial real estate, such as office spaces, industrial properties, and hospitality. These sectors also faced significant challenges and changes due to COVID-19 restrictions and may reveal different dynamics in investor risk perception and cap rates.

Long-Term Impact on Real Estate Markets: This study concluded that COVID-19 related restrictions did not impact the long-term risk perception of retail real estate investors. Future research could delve deeper into the long-term effects, examining how temporary restrictions may have lasting impacts on market fundamentals, investor strategies, and the structural demand for different types of real estate. This could include a focus on the shift towards e-commerce and remote work, and their implications for retail and office spaces.

Influence of Political Attitudes Beyond the Pandemic: The study highlighted the role of state governors' political affiliations and the political leanings of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in shaping investor risk perception. Future studies could investigate how political attitudes and policies in general influence real estate investment decisions and market dynamics outside the context of a pandemic. This could include examining other crises or regulatory changes and their impact on investment behavior.

Diversity and Its Impact on Real Estate Investment: The finding that the ethnic-diverse composition of an MSA presents a lower risk to retail real estate investors suggests a broader investigation into how various forms of diversity (e.g., socioeconomic, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs) affect real estate market fundamentals and investor risk perception. Research could explore whether diverse communities lead to more resilient and dynamic real estate markets.

Comparative International Analysis: Given the unique approach of using the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment in the United States, future research could conduct comparative studies in different countries or regions. This could provide insights into how different governance structures, political landscapes, and cultural attitudes towards public health measures affect real estate markets globally. Such studies could help in understanding the interplay between political decisions, investor behavior, and real estate market dynamics in various international contexts.
