    "abstractText": "We study the overscreened multi-channel Kondo (MCK) model using the recently developed unitary renormalization group (URG) technique. Our results display the importance of ground state degeneracy in explaining various important properties like the breakdown of screening and the presence of local non-Fermi liquids. The impurity susceptibility of the intermediate coupling fixed point Hamiltonian in the zero-bandwidth (or star graph) limit shows a power-law divergence at low temperature. Despite the absence of interchannel coupling in the MCK fixed point Hamiltonian, the study of mutual information between any two channels shows non-zero correlation between them. A spectral flow analysis of the star graph reveals that the degenerate ground state manifold possesses topological quantum numbers. Upon disentangling the impurity spin from its partners in the star graph, we find the presence of a local Mott liquid arising from inter-channel scattering processes. The low energy effective Hamiltonian obtained upon adding a finite non-zero conduction bath dispersion to the star graph Hamiltonian for both the two and three-channel cases displays the presence of local non-Fermi liquids arising from inter-channel quantum fluctuations. Specifically, we confirm the presence of a local marginal Fermi liquid in the two channel case, whose properties show logarithmic scaling at low temperature as expected. Discontinuous behaviour is observed in several measures of ground state entanglement, signalling the underlying orthogonality catastrophe associated with the degenerate ground state manifold. We extend our results to underscreened and perfectly screened MCK models through duality arguments. A study of channel anisotropy under renormalisation flow reveals a series of quantum phase transitions due to the change in ground state degeneracy. Our work thus presents a template for the study of how a degenerate ground state manifold arising from symmetry and duality properties in a multichannel quantum impurity model can lead to novel multicritical phases at intermediate coupling. ar X iv :2 20 5. 00 79 0v 2 [ co nd -m at .s tr -e l] 1 4 Ja n 20 23 Frustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 2",

            "text": "A local antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between a spin- 12 impurity and its host metal gives rise to the well-understood phenomenon of the Kondo effect ( [1], see [2] for an extensive discussion). Here, the impurity local moment is screened by the conduction electrons at temperatures below a certain scale called the Kondo temperature [3\u201310], leading to a spin singlet ground state and local Fermi liquid excitations above that ground state [11, 12]. The screening manifests as an initial increase at temperatures below the Kondo temperature, followed by a saturation of the resistivity of the metal [1, 13], and in the saturation of the impurity contribution to the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures [6\u20138]. Generalisations of this model are obtained by taking impurities of higher spin [2, 9, 14], adding interactions between them [15\u201321], by promoting the model to a lattice of Kondo impurities [22\u201326] or by considering the case of a correlated host metal [27]. One can also construct multi-channel Kondo (MCK) models by allowing K conduction electron channels (K > 1) to interact with a spin-Sd impurity [14, 28, 29] via a common exchange coupling J . Using conformal field theory [9, 30\u201334], bosonization [35\u201339], numerical renormalization group [32,40,41], Bethe ansatz [42\u201346] and other methods [47\u201350], it has been shown that for the over-screened systems (K > 2Sd), the low energy physics is of the non-Fermi liquid type obtained at an intermediate coupling fixed point of the RG flows [14]. Further, the system displays anomalous behaviour in thermodynamic properties near T = 0 and a fractional zero temperature entropy in the thermodynamic limit (upon ensuring that temperature is taken to zero after the system size is taken to infinity [38, 51]). This anomalous divergent behaviour is a signature of the fact that the MCK system with a single channel-symmetric exchange coupling is quantum critical: the ground state is susceptible to perturbations that introduce channel anisotropy in the exchange couplings [14, 32, 37, 45, 52]. This makes the experimental realisation of such states quite challenging. Nevertheless, several features of the two-channel Kondo model have been reproduced using structural two-level systems [28, 53] interacting with a conduction bath [54\u201358]. More recently, it has become possible to tune a two-channel quantum dot system across the quantum phase transition [59,60], revealing the fractionalisation of the low-energy degrees of freedom [49,61,62].\nThe importance of ground state degeneracy and quantum-mechanical frustration in the MCK problem has not received sufficient attention, even though they play crucial roles in determining the quantum criticality and associated non-Fermi liquid physics of\nthe system. This is, at least partially, due to the lack of an intermediate-coupling effective Hamiltonian that describes the low-energy physics of the MCK (i.e., reveals the nature of the excitations). Frustration in this context refers to the inability of the impurity spin to bind with the conduction channels, and be screened completely by forming a maximally-entangled singlet ground state. The absence of such frustration in the single-channel spin-1/2 Kondo model (and more generally, the exact screening variant of the MCK) means that imperfect screening (K 6= 2Sd) leads to dramatic differences in the multi-channel models. Indeed, we demonstrate that there exists an orthogonality catastrophe in the imperfectly screened MCK models that leads to the non-Fermi liquid behaviour of its low-energy excitations, and that this is directly related to the existence of a degenerate ground state manifold. The effects of these non-Fermi liquid low energy excitations are expected to appear in measures of many-particle entanglement; the lack of an intermediate coupling Hamiltonian has, however, prevented the study of the renormalisation group (RG) evolution of such measures [63, 64]. Importantly, our approach enables a comparison of, for instance, the inter-channel mutual information along the RG flow and as functions of the excitation energies, providing insight into the nature of the fixed point theory.\nTo obtain the RG flow of the MCK model, we have employed the unitary renormalization group (URG) technique developed recently by some of us [65, 66]. The method has been applied on several fermionic and spin problems like the single-channel Kondo model [67], the kagome antiferromagnet [68], the 1D [69] and 2D Hubbard models [70\u201372], the reduced-BCS model [73] as well as other generalised models of interacting electrons with and without translation invariance [66]. The URG proceeds by resolving the number fluctuations in the electronic Fock states at high energies by the iterative application of many-particle unitary transformations, leading to their successive decoupling from the states lying at lower energies. Applying this URG method to the channel-isotropic MCK model leads to a lowenergy fixed point Hamiltonian at the intermediate (Kondo) coupling fixed point of Ref. [14]. In further analysing the effective Hamiltonian, we focus initially on the zero bandwidth limit of this Hamiltonian (which corresponds to a frustrated quantum spin model on a star graph). We show thereby that several important properties of the MCK problem, such as the ground state degeneracy and breakdown of screening, can be understood from the zero bandwidth problem. We then proceed to studying the low energy effective Hamiltonian for the non-Fermi liquid excitations lying above the degenerate ground state\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 3\nmanifold. This enables the computation of a plethora of quantities, such as various thermodynamic measures (e.g., specific heat and susceptibility), many-particle entanglement and the self-energy of the propagating degrees of freedom. We also explore various signatures of criticality, and various duality transformations of the MCK Hamiltonian. Finally, we investigate the evolution of ground state degeneracy under RG of the channel anisotropic MCK model.\nSummary of Main Results\nWe start in section 2 by describing the URG flows for the MCK, the intermediate coupling URG fixed point Hamiltonian and the features of the zero bandwidth (star graph) limit of the effective Hamiltonian. In section 3, we explore some properties of the zero bandwidth model: namely, the degree of compensation, impurity magnetisation and impurity susceptibility. The degree of compensation is simply the average correlation between the impurity spin and the conduction channel local spins; it is found to be maximum at exact screening, and decreases for both over- and under-screening. The magnetisation and susceptibility of the star graph model show a discontinuity and a T\u22121 divergence respectively. We also explore the topological properties of the degenerate ground state manifold of the star graph model using non-local twist and translation operators. On decoupling the impurity spin from the conduction spin degrees of freedom within the star graph, we obtain an all-to-all Hamiltonian that represents a local Mott liquid phase. In section 4, we obtain the low energy effective Hamiltonian for the lowlying excitations by including a dispersion into the conduction bath. Notable features of this effective Hamiltonian include (i) the complete absence of local Fermi liquid terms, and (ii) the emergence of local non-Fermi liquid terms. Both are shown to result from the ground state degeneracy of the underlying star graph model. The excitations of the two-channel Kondo problem are found to pertain to a local marginal Fermi liquid, signalling an orthogonality catastrophe.\nIn section 5, we study various entanglement signatures (e.g., von-Neumann entanglement entropy, mutual information, multipartite information, Bures distance) of the low energy fixed-point ground state of the MCK problem, with and without dispersion into the bath. The discontinuous behaviour observed in these measures for the MCK problem reveal clear distinctions from the single-channel case. In 6, we discuss two duality transformations that exist for the MCK model - a strong-weak duality, and an overscreened-under-screened duality. It is found that the transformations are constrained by the fixed point structure, and impose relations between the under-\nscreened and over-screened models. In 7, we show the robustness of the ground state degeneracy of the star graph model against the impurity-channel coupling anisotropy, and correlate it with a URG treatment of the channel anisotropic MCK. The isotropic fixed point is found to be unstable to asymmetry, leading to impurity phase transitions that lead to dramatic changes in the ground state degeneracy. For the sake of brevity, some supporting evidence and details of certain lengthy calculations are presented in Supplementary Materials [74]. Finally, we conclude in section 8."

Here, l sums over the K channels of the conduction bath, k, k\u2032 sum over all the momentum states of the bath and \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 sum over the two spin indices of a single electron. We now perform a renormalisation group analysis of the MCK Hamiltonian using the recently developed URG method [65, 66, 68\u201371, 73]. The RG proceeds by applying unitary transformations in order to blockdiagonalize the Hamiltonian by removing number fluctuations of the high energy degrees of freedom. At the jth RG step, we focus on decoupling the highest energy electronic state denoted by |j\u3009. The Hamiltonian will in general not conserve the number of particles in this state: [ H(j), n\u0302j ] 6= 0, and the unitary transformation U(j) causes this number fluctuation to vanish [65,66]:\nH(j\u22121) = U(j)H(j)U \u2020 (j) , [ H(j\u22121), n\u0302j ] = 0 . (2)\nThe unitary transformations are given in terms of a fermionic generator \u03b7(j) [65, 66]:\nU(j) = 1\u221a 2\n( 1 + \u03b7(j) \u2212 \u03b7\u2020(j) ) ,\n{ \u03b7(j), \u03b7 \u2020 (j) } = 1 , (3)\nwhere {\u00b7} is the anticommutator. Further, [ \u03b7(j), \u03b7 \u2020 (j) ] = 2n\u0302j\u22121. The unitary operator U(j) mentioned in Eq. (3) can be thought of as a special case of the most general form U = eS of a unitary operator defined by an\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 4\nanti-Hermitian generator S. For our case, the generator turns out to be S = \u03c04 ( \u03b7\u2020(j) \u2212 \u03b7(j) ) , such that the unitary operator is U(j) = e \u03c0 4 ( \u03b7\u2020 (j) \u2212\u03b7(j) ) [65]. If one then uses the anti-commutation and commutation properties of \u03b7(j), \u03b7 \u2020 (j) [65, 66], the exponential can be expanded in its Taylor series and then resummed into the form in Eq. (3).\nThe generator itself is given by [65,66]\n\u03b7\u2020(j) = 1\n\u03c9\u0302(j) \u2212 Tr ( H(j)n\u0302j\n)c\u2020jTr ( H(j)cj ) . (4)\nThe operators \u03b7(j), \u03b7 \u2020 (j) can be thought of as the manyparticle analogue of the single-particle field operators cj , c \u2020 j that change the occupation number of the single-particle Fock space, |nj\u3009. The presence of the operators in \u03b7(j) other than cj are required to ensure that the decoupling of the specific Fock state under consideration is carried out through a unitary modification of the spectrum of the remnant degrees of freedom. Since the jth degree of freedom is coupled with many others, a rotation of the basis of j also involves a rotation of the many-particle basis of the remaining degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian H(j);\nthis is encoded within the Tr ( H(j)cj ) term. The operator \u03c9\u0302(j) encodes the quantum fluctuation scales arising from the interplay of the kinetic energy terms and the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian:\n\u03c9\u0302(j) = H(j\u22121) \u2212Hi(j) . (5) Hi(j) is that part of H(j) that commutes with n\u0302j but does not commute with at least one n\u0302l for l < j. The RG flow continues till a fixed point is reached at an energy D\u2217. The Greens function in front of cj (in Eq. 4) accounts for the dynamical cost of this rotation in terms of an operator for quantum fluctuations (\u03c9\u0302), as well as the kinetic and self-energies Tr ( H(j)n\u0302j ) .\nThere exist other renormalisation group schemes that depend on canonical transformations, such as Wegner\u2019s continuous unitary transformations (CUT) RG [75] and the similarity RG method by Glazek and Wilson [76]. There are at least two specific distinctions between the CUT RG and the URG method adopted in the present work.\n\u2022 While most RG methods that apply successive unitary transformations rely on a gradual decrease in the off-diagonal content of the Hamiltonian, the URG proceeds by decoupling each discrete Fock space node at a time. In other words, the URG achieves a block-diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian at each RG step, while the CUT RG involves a gradual decay of the off-diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian in order to make it more band diagonal.\n\u2022 The CUT RG involves choosing a truncation scheme that allows closing the RG equations. The URG, on the other hand, is able to resum the coupling expansion series through the denominator structure and the quantum fluctuation operator.\nDetailed comparisons of the URG with other methods (e.g., the functional RG, spectrum bifurcation RG etc.) can be found in Refs. [65, 70].\nThe derivation of the RG equation for the overscreened regime (2S < K) of the spin-S-impurity K-channel Kondo problem is shown in detail in the Supplementary Materials [74]. On decoupling circular isoenergetic shells at energies D(j), the change in the Kondo coupling at the jth RG step, \u2206J(j), is given by\n\u2206J(j) = \u2212 J 2(j)N(j)\n\u03c9(j) \u2212 D(j)2 + J(j) 4\n( 1\u2212 1\n2 \u03c1J(j)K\n) , (6)\nwhere N(j) is the number of electronic states at the energy shell D(j). We work in the low quantum fluctuation regime \u03c9(j) < D(j)\n2 . There are three fixed points of the RG equation. One arises from the vanishing of the denominator, and was present in the single-channel Kondo RG equation as well [67]. As shown there, this fixed-point goes to J \u2217 = \u221e as the bare bandwidth of the conduction electrons is made large. The other fixed point is the trivial one at J \u2217 = 0. The third fixed point is reached when the numerator vanishes: J \u2217 = 2K\u03c1 [14, 77\u201379]. Only the intermediate fixed point is found to be stable. This is consistent with results from Bethe ansatz calculations [42\u201346,80], CFT calculations [9,30,31], bosonization treatments [35,38] and NRG analysis [41,81].\nThe RG equation reduces to the perturbative form\n\u2206J(j) ' J 2(j)N(j) D(j) ( 1\u2212 12\u03c1J(j)K ) [14, 78, 79, 82] when one replaces \u03c9(j) with the ground state energy \u2212D(j)2 and assumes J D(j)."

Interestingly, the string operator \u03c0z is a Wilson loop operator [83] that wraps around all the nodes of the star graph:\n\u03c0z = exp [ i \u03c0\n2\n( \u03c3zd + K\u2211\nl=1\n\u03c3zl \u2212K )] = ei\u03c0(J z\u2212 12K) . (12)\n\u03c0x and \u03c0y are \u2019t Hooft operators [83] and mix states of opposite parity. For example, it can be shown that \u03c0x |Jz\u3009 = \u2212 |Jz\u3009.\nThere are several reasons for working with the star graph in particular and zero mode Hamiltonians in general. In the single-channel Kondo model, the star graph is just the two spin Heisenberg problem, and it reveals the stabilization of the Kondo model ground state, as well as certain thermodynamic properties (e.g., the impurity contribution to the susceptibility) [67, 84, 84\u201387]. Similarly, in the MCK model, the star graph captures accurately the nature of the RG flows. At weak coupling J \u2192 0+, the central spin is weakly coupled to the outer spins and prone to screening because of the S\u00b1 terms in the star graph; at strong coupling J \u2192 \u221e\u2212, the outer spin-half objects tightly bind with the central spin-half object to form a single spin object that interacts with the remaining states through an exchange coupling which is RG relevant. This renders both the terminal fixed points unstable. The true stable fixed point must then lie somewhere in between, and we recover the schematic phase diagram of fig. 1.\nMoreover, the RG flows of the MCK model have been show to preserve the degeneracy of the ground state [41, 88, 89], and the star graph captures this degeneracy in its entirety. This is important, because it will be shown in a later section that the lowest excitations of the intermediate fixed point are described by a non-Fermi liquid phase, and it can be argued that this non-Fermi liquid physics arises solely from the ground state degeneracy of the underlying zero mode Hamiltonian. As mentioned previously, the ground state degeneracy of the more general star graph with a spin-Sd impurity and K channels is given by gSdK = |K \u2212 2Sd|+ 1. The cases of K = 2Sd, K < 2Sd and K > 2Sd correspond to exactly screened, underscreened and over-screened regimes respectively. The latter two cases correspond to a multiply-degenerate manifold with gSK > 1, and simultaneously have nonFermi liquid phases [9, 14, 30, 33, 35, 49, 77, 80, 90\u201398], while the first regime has a unique ground state with gSK = 1 and is described by a local Fermi liquid (LFL) phase [6\u20138, 11, 14], thereby substantiating the claim that a degeneracy greater than unity is closely tied to non-Fermi liquid physics.\nWe now comment on the validity of our study of\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 6\nthe zero-bandwidth model at the intermediate coupling fixed point (ICFP) of the MCK problem. Nozieres and Blandin indeed present an argument for why the zerobandwidth model at the strong coupling fixed point (J = \u221e) is unstable due to the existence of nontrivial RG relevant quantum fluctuations [14]. The resulting RG flow of the Kondo coupling J to the ICFP resolves these quantum fluctuations. The RG stability of the Kondo coupling J at the ICFP then allows for a renormalised perturbation theory approach to studying the fixed point Hamiltonian. Specifically, the zero-bandwidth model can be safely extracted (in the RG sense) as the zeroth approximation of a renormalised perturbation theory in the ratio of the conduction bath hopping amplitude (t) to J . A study of the zero-bandwidth model at the ICFP offers, in turn, new perspectives into the problem, e.g., the ground state degeneracy and it\u2019s relation to the breakdown of exact screening etc., as described in the two preceding paragraphs. It also informs us on the ground state manifold about which to carry out a systematic renormalised perturbative expansion to obtain the low-lying excitations (see Sec.4 below, and Sec.III of the supplementary materials). Moreover, in the following sections, we will show how the inherent quantum-mechanical frustration of singlet order that is present in the Hamiltonian leads to the non-trivial physics of the fixed points in terms of non-Fermi liquid phase, diverging thermodynamic quantities, quantum criticality as well as emergent gauge theories."

It is given by the antiferromagnetic correlation existing between the impurity spin and conduction electron channels:\n\u0393 \u2261 \u2212 \u2329 ~Sd \u00b7 ~S \u232a . The expectation value is calculated in\nthe ground state.

M takes values in the range [Mmin,Mmax], where Mmax = K/2 for a K\u2212channel Kondo model, and Mmin = 0 if K is even, otherwise 12 . The diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian is shown in the Supplementary Materials [74].

(17)\nThe \u03c7 is seen to diverge as T\u22121 at low temperatures. Such a non-analyticity in a response function is in contrast to the behaviour in the exactlyscreened fixed point where the ground state is unique. There, the susceptibility becomes constant at low temperatures: \u03c7(T \u2192 0) = W4TK , TK being the single-channel Kondo temperature and W the Wilson number [11, 40, 67, 86]. In Fig. 4, we have checked the case of general spin-Sd impurity by diagonalising the star graph Hamiltonian numerically, and the general conclusion is that all exactly-screened models show a constant impurity susceptibility at T \u2192 0, while the over-screened and under-screened cases show a\ndiverging impurity susceptibility in the same limit. A similar divergence is also seen in the susceptibility of the outer spins, calculated by inserting a magnetic field purely on the outer spins. Some additional results regarding susceptibility are presented in the Supplementary Materials [74].\nDeparture from single-channel behaviour is most apparent in the presence of the highly polarised states |Jz = \u00b1K\u221212 \u3009 in the ground-state spectrum, |Jz = \u03c3K \u2212 1 2 \u3009 = 1\u221a 1 +K |\u03c3\u3009d \u2297 |Sz = \u03c3( K 2 \u2212 1)\u3009\n\u2212 \u221a K\u221a\n1 +K |\u03c3\u0304\u3009d \u2297 |Sz = \u03c3\nK\n2 \u3009 , (18)\nwhere \u03c3 = \u00b11 and |\u03c3\u3009d represents the up and down configurations of the impurity spin and |Sz\u3009 represents the configuration of the bath spins. These states lead to large unquenched magnetisation (m(h = 0\u00b1)) at zero temperatures that displays discontinuous behaviour in the limit of a vanishing field h \u2192 0\u00b1. This can be seen as follows. In the presence of a field, the ground-state becomes unique: |\u03c8\u3009gs (h) = \u03b8(h) |Jz = K\u221212 \u3009+\u03b8(\u2212h) |Jz = \u2212K\u221212 \u3009, and the impurity magnetisation can be calculated from the state: m(h = 0\u00b1) = \u03b8(h) \u3008Jz = K \u2212 1 2 |Szd |Jz = K \u2212 1 2 \u3009\n+ \u03b8(\u2212h) \u3008Jz = \u2212K \u2212 1 2 |Szd |Jz = \u2212 K \u2212 1 2 \u3009 = \u00b11 2 1\u2212K 1 +K . (19)\nThe magnetization is therefore discontinuous as h \u2192 0\u00b1 for K > 1. The non-analyticity occurs because the magnetic field is able to flip the states with Jz = (K \u2212 1)/2 into the state of the opposite\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 8\nmagnetisation and vice versa. The available space for scattering is simply the frustration that we discussed earlier. Indeed, we have checked (see Fig. 5) by diagonalising numerically the star graph Hamiltonian that the non-analyticity exists for all \u03b4 6= 0, where \u03b4 = K2 \u2212 Sd is the deviation from exact screening.\nThese polarised states can also be used to obtain the scattering phase shift suffered by the conduction channels at the Fermi surface. The gapless spinflip fluctuations between the impurity and the bath lead to the delocalisation of the impurity degree of freedom into the conduction bath, specifically at the Fermi surface. This results in an \u201dexcess charge\u201d being contributed by the impurity to the momentum states. As shown in the Supplementary Materials [74], within the polarised states, the impurity contributes an excess charge of n (l) exc = 1/K to each conduction channel. Following Friedel\u2019s sum rule, this leads to a total scattering phase shift (\u2206(l)) of \u03c0/K for each channel: \u2206(l) = \u03c0n(l)exc = \u03c0\nK , l \u2208 [1,K] . (20)\nFor K > 1, each channel therefore experiences an unrenormalised phase shift of value between 0 and \u03c0 that, as we will show in a later section, is responsible for the non-Fermi liquid behaviour observed at the ICFP. For example, we will show that these phase shifts are linked to the critical non-Fermi liquid exponents of various thermodynamic quantities at the fixed point. That this phase shift is tied to the frustration that leads to incomplete Kondo screening at the ICFP can be evidenced through its relation to the impurity magnetisation m(h = 0\u00b1) obtained in eq. 19:\nm(h = 0\u00b1) = \u00b11 2 \u2206(l) \u2212 \u03c0 \u2206(l) + \u03c0 . (21) When the phase shift \u2206(l) acquires a fractional value (in units of \u03c0) at the ICFP, the impurity magnetisation also becomes fractional (in units of 12 ). We will see shortly that this unrenormalised phase shift value of 0 < \u03b4(l) < \u03c0 [99] is also at the heart of an orthogonality catastrophe, i.e., a dramatic change in the ground-state wavefunction of the conduction bath degrees of freedom as the impurity is introduced among them [100,101]."

(29) Thus, the energy eigenvalues of all the orthogonal states are equal, and they form the K fold degenerate ground state subspace. By the application of the twist operator O\u0302, we can go from one degenerate ground state to another. We note that a similar exploration of the degenerate ground state manifold of spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on geometrically frustrated lattices via twist and translation operators has been conducted in Refs.

We use this expectation value to replace the denominator of the above RG equation. \u03b2\u2191(J , \u03c9\u2191) = (J 2\u0393\u2191)/2 , \u0393\u2191 = (\u03c9\u2191 \u2212 J (Szd \u2212 1))\u22121 .

(34)\nThe case \u03b2\u2191(J ,\u03c9\u2191)\n2 < 0 leads to a ferromagnetic effective Hamiltonian. In this case, the ground state is realised for S being maximum and Sz being minimum. The effective Hamiltonian can be rewritten in this case as Heff = \u2212|\u03b2\u2191(J , \u03c9\u2191)| \u00d7 (S+S\u2212 + S\u2212S+)/4 . (35) The complete set of commuting observables for this Hamiltonian contains H,S, Sz. In the ground state, S is maximum, and therefore S = K/2, and Sz can take\n2S + 1 = K + 1 values. Defining the dual operator \u03c6\u0302 with the algebra [ \u02c6\u03c6, Sz] = i, we get the twist operator\nQ\u0302 = exp(i\u03c6\u0302\u03a6/\u03a60).

After removing the quantum fluctuations between the impurity spin and the outer spins, we get an allto-all model (eq.(36)) as the effective Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of this all-to-all Hamiltonian can be labeled by the eigenvalues of Sz. There are K + 1 such states made out of only the outer spins. The total state including the impurity spin can be written as |Jz\u3009 = |Szd\u3009 \u2297 |Sz\u3009 labeled by Jz = Szd + Sz. As the all-to-all model has Z2 symmetry in impurity sector, there are 2(K + 1) total states. For Szd = 1/2, {Jz} = {\u2212(K\u22121)/2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (K\u22121)/2, (K+1)/2} and for Szd = \u22121/2, {Jz} = {\u2212(K+1)/2,\u2212(K\u22121)/2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (K\u2212 1)/2}. We can see that in both the cases, all K states of the star graph ground state manifold are present in the spectrum of the all-to-all model, one of them being the ground state. Using the twist operator, we can cycle between the various states. Some additional topological features of the Mott liquid are presented in the Supplementary Materials [74]."

(40) The 32\u2212fold degeneracy arises from the two-fold degeneracy of Jz (Jz = \u00b11/2) multiplying the 16\u2212fold degeneracy of the rest of the sites nli,\u03c3 (each of the four nli,\u03c3 can be 0 or 1, leading to a 2\n4-fold degeneracy).

Such non-Fermi liquid (NFL) terms in the effective Hamiltonian and the absence of any Fermiliquid term at the same order should be contrasted with the local Fermi liquid excitations induced by the singlet ground state of the single-channel Kondo model [2,11,86]. We now take the MCK Hamiltonian to strong-coupling, and perform a perturbative treatment of the hopping. At J \u2192 \u221e, the perturbative coupling t2/J is arbitrarily small and we again obtain Eq. 44. Such a change from the strong coupling model with parameter J to a weak coupling model with parameter t2/J amounts to a duality transformation [88, 89]. It can be shown that the duality transformation leads to an identical MCK model [88] (self-duality), which implies we can have identical RG flows, and our transformation simply extracts the NFL piece from the dual model. The self-duality also ensures that the critical intermediate-coupling fixed point is unique and can be reached from either of the models.\nThe diagonal part of eq. 44 is\nVeff = 2t2\nJ\n\u2211\nl=1,2\n(\u2211\n\u03c3\nn\u03020\u03c3,l\n) s+\n0,l\u0304 s\u2212 1,l\u0304 + h.c. , (45)\nwhere l\u0304 = 3\u2212 l is the channel index complementary to l.

Following [70], one can track the RG evolution of the dual coupling Rj = 4t2\nJj at the\njth RG step, in the form of the URG equation\n\u2206Rj = \u2212 R2j\n\u03c9 \u2212 j/2\u2212Rj/8 . (49)\nIn the RG equation, j represents the energy of the j th isoenergetic shell. It is seen from the RG equation that R is relevant in the range of \u03c9 < 12 j that has been used throughout, leading to a fixed-point at R\u2217/8 = \u03c9 \u2212 12 \u2217). The relevance of R is expected because the strong coupling J is irrelevant and R \u223c 1/J .\nThe renormalisation in R leads to a renormalisation in the single-particle self-energy [70]. The k\u2212space-averaged self-energy renormalisation is \u2206\u03a3(\u03c9) = \u03c1R\u22172 \u222b \u2217\n0\nd j \u03c9 \u2212 j/2 +Rj/8 . (50)\nThe density of states can be approximated to be N\u2217/R\u2217, where N\u2217 is the total number of states over the interval R\u2217. As suggested by the fixed point value of Rj , we can approximate its behaviour near the fixed point by a linear dependence on the dispersion j . The two limits of the integration are the starting and ending points of the RG. We start the RG very close to the Fermi surface and move towards the fixed point \u2217. Near the starting point, we substitute = 0 and R = \u03c9, following the fixed point condition. From the fixed point condition, we also substitute R\u2217/8 = \u03c9 \u2212 12 \u2217. On defining \u03c9\u0304 = N\u2217 ( \u03c9 \u2212 12 \u2217 ) , we can write \u2206\u03a3(\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9\u0304 ln N \u2217\u03c9 \u03c9\u0304 . (51)\nThe self-energy also provides the quasiparticle residue for each channel [70]:\nZ(\u03c9\u0304) = ( 2\u2212 ln 2\u03c9\u0304\nN\u2217\u03c9\n)\u22121 . (52)\nAs \u03c9 \u2192 0, the Z vanishes, implying that the ground state is not adiabatically connected to the Fermi gas in the presence of the NFL terms. This is the orthogonality catastrophe [101, 105\u2013107] in the twochannel Kondo problem, and it is brought about by the presence of the channel-non diagonal terms in Eq. 48. Such terms were absent in the single-channel Kondo model, because there was no multiply-degenerate ground state manifold that allowed scattering. This line of argument shows that the extra degeneracy of the ground state subspace and the frustration of the singlet order that comes about when one upgrades from the single-channel Kondo model to the MCK models is at the heart of the NFL behaviour, and the orthogonality catastrophe is expected to be a general feature of all such frustrated MCK models. A local NFL term and a similar self-energy was also obtained by Coleman, et\nal. [49] in terms of Majorana fermions at the strongcoupling fixed point of the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 model, which they claimed was equivalent to the intermediate-coupling fixed point of the two-channel Kondo model. Indeed, along with Ref. [39], this demonstration shows the universality between the two-channel Kondo and the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 models.\nFurther, we argue below that the orthogonality catastrophe for the 2-channel problem can also be understood as a drastic change in the ground state and lowest-lying excited state wavefunctions and related quantum numbers. The detailed calculation has been shown in the Supplementary Materials [74]. Upon taking account of the hopping between the star graph and the momentum states of the conduction bath, the full ground-state |\u03c8(l)\u2212 \u3009 and low-lying excited states |\u03c8(l)+ \u3009 in the lth channel take the form:\n|\u03c8(l)\u00b1 \u3009 = 1\u221a 2 ( |\u03c7\u2212 12 \u3009 \u2297 |e (l) \u2191 \u3009 \u00b1 |\u03c7 12 \u3009 \u2297 |e (l) \u2193 \u3009 ) , (53)\nwhere |\u03c7\u03c3 2 \u3009 = 1\u221a 6 (|\u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c3\u0304\u3009+ |\u03c3, \u03c3\u0304, \u03c3\u3009 \u2212 2 |\u03c3\u0304, \u03c3, \u03c3\u3009) are the ground-states of the two-channel star graph, and \u03c3 can take values \u00b11. The states |e(l)\u03c3 \u3009 \u2261 e\u2020\u03c3,(l) |\u03c6\u3009 =\u2211 k\u2208FS c \u2020 k\u03c3,(l) |\u03c6\u3009 are gapless excitations close to the Fermi surface (FS) |\u03c6\u3009. The residue for scattering processes of the form e\u2020\u03c3,(l)e\u03c3\u0304,(l) between the new ground and excited states is then found to vanish:\nZ = | \u3008\u03c8(l)+ |e\u2020\u2191,(l)e\u2193,(l)|\u03c8 (l) \u2212 \u3009 |2 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8(l)+ | ( |\u03c7 1 2 \u3009 |e(l)\u2191 \u3009 )\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 = 0 . (54) This shows that single-particle excitations (a signature of the local Fermi liquid associated with the single channel Kondo fixed point) are no longer long-lived, signalling the orthogonality catastrophe.\nThe orthogonality catastrophe in the infrared wavefunction arises from an unrenormalised scattering phase shift in the conduction electrons at the fixed point. We have already seen from the zero mode approximation of the fixed point Hamiltonian that each channel suffers a phase shift of \u2206(l) = \u03c0/K (eq. 20), which is non-zero but less than the limit of unitarity. We will now see that this phase shift guides the renormalisation group flow of the Kondo coupling J . Following refs. [108\u2013110], the URG equation for J (eq.6) can be recast in the form\n\u2206J(j) = \u2212 J 2(j)N(j)\n\u03c9(j) \u2212 D(j)2 + J(j) 4\n( 1\u2212 \u03c1J(j)\n2\u2206(l)/\u03c0\n) . (55)\nThe Kondo coupling J continues to flow under RG until it obtains a value dictated by the phase shift of the star graph: \u03c1J \u2217 = 2\u2206(l)/\u03c0 = 2/K. Following eq. 21, this also leads to the fractional value of 1/4 for\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 12\nthe impurity magnetisation m(0+) in the spin-half twochannel Kondo model. Indeed, the values of both \u2206(l) and m(0+) point to the frustrated nature of the MCK problem and the absence of complete screening of the impurity moment at the ICFP. Importantly, the phase shifts \u2206(l) also affect the critical exponents of wellknown algebraic behaviour of several thermodynamic properties at the ICFP.

(58)\nThe EEd for states of various J z are shown as functions of the number of channels K in fig. 6. At any given value of K on the x\u2212axis, all the points directly above it represent values of EEd for various values of Jz in the ground state manifold of the MCK problem defined by that particular value of K. The minimum entanglement entropy occurs in the maximum Jz state (|Jz = J\u3009), and this minimum value decreases with increase in K. On the other hand, the maximum entanglement entropy is attained in the\nstate with minimum Jz. This maximum value of the entanglement entropy is always ln 2 for odd values ofK; for even values of K, the value asymptotically reaches log 2 at large K.\nA very similar computation gives the entanglement entropy between one outer spin and the rest of the spins, and it is shown in Fig. 7. We again find that the minimum entanglement entropy is associated with the state |Jz = J\u3009 and it falls with increasing K, approaching zero asymptotically; the maximum entanglement entropy is, as before, associated with the state | (Jz)min\u3009 and it rises to log 2 in the limit K 1.\nTwo interesting features emerge from the study:\n\u2022 For the odd K models, the impurity is maximally entangled with the other spins in the minimum Jz, |Jz = 0\u3009, member of the ground state manifold. At large K, the even K models also acquire this property, the minimum Jz there being \u00b1 12 . \u2022 Both EEd and EE0 are individually equal for the states | \u00b1 Jz\u3009, which shows that both types of entanglement entropy are invariant under the transformation |Jz\u3009 \u2192 \u03c0 |Jz\u3009. This reflects a\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 13\nparity symmetry in the state space in terms of entanglement.\n5.1.2. Mutual Information Mutual information is a measure which captures the correlations present between two subsystems (A,B), in a particular state. It is defined as\nI2(A : B) = SA + SB \u2212 SA\u222aB , (59) where SA(B) is the entanglement entropy of the subsystem A(B) with the rest, and SA\u222aB is the entanglement entropy of A and B with the rest. We are interested in two types of mutual information: firstly, the mutual information I2(d : o) between the impurity and one of the other spins, and secondly, the mutual information I2(o : o) between any two of the outer spins. Both of these have been computed for various channel numbers K, and plotted in Figs. 8 and 9.\nIn both cases we find that the maximum and minimum mutual information are associated with the | (Jz)min\u3009 and |Jz = J\u3009 states respectively. We also find that the mutual information is the same in the\nFigure 10. Variation of multipartite information IN among N outer spins as a function of N , for K = 8.

In the large channel limit (K 1), the maximum I2(d : o) and I2(o : o) saturate to the common value of 0.375.\n5.1.3. Multipartite information Similar to mutual information, one can calculate higher order multipartite information to study the nature of correlations present in different ground states. We define the tripartite information among three subsystems A,B,C as I3ABC = (SA+SB+SC)\u2212(SAB+SBC+SCA)+SABC . I3 shows behavior similar to the mutual information - the highest I2 value is associated with the (Jz)min state and it saturates in the limit of K 1. The N\u2212partite information for a collection of subsystems (CSS) {AN} \u2261 {A1, A2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , AN} can also be defined as [111]\nIN{AN} =\n[ N\u2211\nm=1\n(\u22121)m\u22121 \u2211\nQ\u2208Bm({A}) SV\u222a(Q)\n]\n\u2212 SV\u2229(AN ) . (60) where Bm({AN}) \u2261 {Q | Q \u2282 P({AN}), |Q| = m}, and P({AN}) is the powerset of {AN}. For simplicity, we also define the union and intersection of all the subsystems present in Q as V\u222a(Q) \u2261 \u22c3 A\u2208QA and\nV\u2229(Q) \u2261 \u22c2 A\u2208QA respectively.\nThe study of such measures of multipartite information reveals the nature of the multi-party correlations present among the outer spins of the star graph. Our study, as presented in fig. (10), shows that the higher order multi-partite correlations (IN ) decrease as you increase the order (N), and the behaviour follows a power law. In the inset of the same figure, we have shown the IN vs N plot that is observed in the ground state of the all-to-all effective Hamiltonian (Eq.36), and it shows a similar power-law\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 14\nbehaviour. The similarities in the behavior suggest that one can capture entanglement properties either from the star graph or from the corresponding all-toall model."

            "text": "To study the nature of correlations at the MCK fixed point, we introduce excitations into the star graph ground state. We will work with the Hamiltonian Eq.(39) where we consider nearest-neighbor real space hopping t from the zeroth site into the lattice (Fig. 11). Setting t = 0 recovers the zero bandwidth version of the MCK. In the K = 1 single channel case, the impurity (Sd) is coupled to the spin degree of freedom at the real space origin ({1\u2191, 1\u2193}) of the single conduction bath via a Heisenberg spin-exchange coupling. For K = 2, the impurity is interacting with 2 distinct local spins {1\u2191, 1\u2193} and {2\u2191, 2\u2193} belonging to zeroth sites of different conduction channels, and the real space hopping connects these zeroth sites to their nearest neighbor sites. As we increase the hopping strength t from zero to non-zero, the lattice sites start interacting with each other.\n5.2.1. Impurity entanglement entropy The impurity entanglement entropy EEd(t) in the ground state is shown as a function of t in Fig. 12 for three values of channel number K. At low hopping strength (0 < t 1), EEd is independent of t and achieves a constant value. We also find that in this range of t, EEd decreases with increasing K. This behaviour is reversed at high t, and EEd is seen to increase with increasing K. Though the values of the impurity entanglement entropy for various values of K are quite similar at low hopping strength, as the single channel EEd varies smoothly at t \u2192 0+, whereas the EEd for K > 1 show a discontinuity at t\u2192 0+.\n5.2.2. Intra-channel Mutual information Here, we will calculate the mutual information between two\nelectronic states in the ground state wavefunction, as a function of the hopping strength t.\nCase 1: We first study the mutual information MI(d, 1 \u2191) between the impurity spin Sd and the state 1\u2191 (fig. 11), where 1 represents real-space origin of the 1st conduction channel. For a single channel model, this site is unique because there is just one channel, but in the presence of K channels, there are K possible choices corresponding to each of the channels. However, because of the symmetry of the Hamiltonian under the exchange of the channel indices, all such choices will show identical mutual information signatures. Similarly, due to the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry of the Hamiltonian, MI(d, 1 \u2193) will be identical to MI(d, 1 \u2191). We have numerically computed and plotted MI(d, 1 \u2191) as a function of t in fig. 13. The inset shows that at low hopping strength, the mutual information for the single channel and the two-channel models saturate to different values. In the single-channel case, the saturation value at t = 0 is log 2, and the mutual information changes smoothly as t is turned on. This is similar to the behaviour in the impurity entanglement entropy studied previously. The value of log 2 shows the maximal entanglement between the zeroth site and the impurity, and the perfect screening of the impurity spin. For the two channel problem, we find that the mutual information at t = 0 is MI(d, 1\u2191) = 0.2401. The reduction of the value from ln 2 shows the breakdown of screening. Also note that unlike the single channel case, there is a discontinuity in MI(d, 1\u2191) as t is increased from 0.\nCase 2: We have also computed the mutual information MI(1\u2191, 1\u2193) between the two electronic states on the zeroth site of the same conduction channel, and plotted them in fig. 14. We find that it is a smooth function of t for K = 1, and for K = 2 there is a discontinuity at t = 0+. Note that for small values of t, we find MI(1\u2191, 1\u2193) > MI(d, 1\u2191) for the\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 15\nK = 2 model, showing the presence of strong intra-site correlations.\nCase 3: Next, we measure the mutual information MI(d, l1\u2191) between the impurity site and an electronic state of the site that is nearest-neighbour to the realspace origin of one of the conduction channels (see fig. 11). The results are shown in fig. 15. Vanishing mutual information for the single channel case shows the perfect screening of the impurity spin. The nonzero value of mutual information at small values of t in the K = 2 model is again a result of the imperfect screening. As in the previous cases, we find a discontinuity in the mutual information for K = 2 as t\u2192= 0+.\nCase 4: A complementary study can be made by calculating the mutual information between the origin of a particular conduction channel and it\u2019s nearest\nneighbour site. They are plotted in fig. 16, and we find that at low hopping strength the single channel mutual information vanishes, showing the decoupling of those two states. On the other hand, in the two channel case, there is a non-zero mutual information which indicates the presence of scattering between the local Mott liquid and the local non-Fermi liquid states.\nApart from these, we have also computed an intra-channel tripartite information I3(1\u2191, l1\u2191, l1\u2193) of the two-channel ground state (blue curve in Fig. 17) - it shows that there is a discontinuity in the tripartite information at t = 0+, and at low hopping strength the tripartite information is independent of t with a value 0.084. This non-zero value of the tripartite information is consistent with the presence of a nonFermi liquid effective Hamiltonian having more than just two-particle interactions within it. We have also studied inter-channel mutual information I2(1\u2191, 2\u2191) for K = 2 (red curve in fig. 17). It reveals the correlation and quantum entanglement between these\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 16\ntwo channels, and demonstrates the all-to-all nature of the local Mott liquid.\n5.2.3. Bures distance and the orthogonality catastrophe In addition to these entanglement measures, we have also calculated the Bures distance between the states at t = 0 and t > 0. The Bures distance [112\u2013117] between two density matrices \u03c11, \u03c12 is defined as dBures(\u03c11, \u03c12) = \u221a 2 [ 1\u2212 Tr {( \u03c1 1/2 1 \u03c12\u03c1 1/2 1 )1/2}] ,(61)\nand is a measure of the distance, in the Hilbert space, between the states forming the density matrices. One can see from the above definition that the maximum and minimum possible distances are \u221a 2 and 0 respectively.\nWe get the ground state |\u03c8(t)\u3009 of the problem by solving the Hamiltonian in Eq. (39). This ground state |\u03c8(t)\u3009(t) and the associated density matrix \u03c1(t) = |\u03c8(t)\u3009\u3008\u03c8(t)| are functions of the hopping strength t. We are interested in the reduced density matrix \u03c1sg(t) of only the sites that form the star graph (impurity site and the zeroth sites of the conduction channels), so we trace out all the nearest neighbor sites from the full density matrix:, \u03c1sg(t) = Trn\u2212n(\u03c1(t)). The Bures distance dBures(\u03c1sg(0), \u03c1sg(t)) is then calculated between the reduced density matrices at t = 0 and t > 0, for K = 1, K = 2 and K = 3.\nWe have shown the variation of the Bures distance as a function of the hopping strength t in Fig. 18. Although the Bures distance is 0 (by definition) at t = 0 for all K, a difference arises as t is made slightly non-zero: there is a discontinuity in the Bures distance for the two and three channel models, while the single channel Bures distance is continuous. The smooth variation of the Bures distance in the single channel case shows the adiabatic continuity of the reduced star graph density matrix from the t = 0 case to t 6= 0 case. On the other hand, the abrupt jump in the Bures distance for higher-channel cases at t = 0+ shows the breakdown of adiabatic continuity between the t = 0 and t = 0+ Hamiltonians and signals an orthogonality catastrophe between these two ground states. The discontinuity increases as K is increased, indicating that considering the case of more channels will lead to the maximum Bures distance of dBures = \u221a 2 and hence an exact orthogonality."

At strong coupling, the ground states of the star graph eq.(8) act as a good starting point for a perturbative expansion. As argued previously, there are K \u2212 2Sd + 1 ground states, labeled by the K values of the total spin angular momentum Jz = Szd + S\nz = \u2212K2 + Sd,\u2212K2 + Sd + 1, . . . , K2 \u2212 Sd. Since a general spin-s object is simply a 2s+ 1 level system, the K\u2212fold degenerate ground state manifold can be used to define a new impurity spin Sd of multiplicity 2Sd + 1 = K \u2212 2Sd + 1 which implies that we need Sd = K2 \u2212Sd. In other words, the spin-Sd impurity has a dual described by a spin-(K\u22122Sd+1) impurity. The\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 17\nstates of this new spin are defined by\nS\u0302zd |Sz\u3009 = Sz |Sz\u3009 , S\u0302\u00b1d |Sz\u3009 = \u221a Sd (Sd + 1)\u2212 Sz (Sz \u00b1 1) |Sz \u00b1 1\u3009 . (63)\nWhile the ground state subspace gives rise to the new central spin object, the excited states of the star graph can be used to define bosonic operators that mediate interactions between the central spin and the next-nearest neighbour lattice sites [88]. In terms of the zero-bandwidth spectrum, the bosonic operators represent scattering between the ground state subspace and the excited subspaces. Through a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation in the small coupling t 2\nJ , one can then remove this interaction and generate an exchangecoupling between the new impurity ~Sd and the new zero modes formed out of the remaining sites in the lattice [88] (by remaining, we mean those real space sites that have not been consumed into forming the new spin). The new Hamiltonian, characterized by the small super-exchange coupling J of the general form \u03b3t2/J , has the form H \u2032(J) = \u2211\nk,\u03c3,l\nk,ln\u0302k\u03c3,l + J ~Sd \u00b7 ~S . (64)\n~S is the local bath spin formed by the new zero modes. This Hamiltonian is very similar to the one in eq.(62), and that is the essence of the strong-weak duality: One can go from the over-screened strong coupling spin-Sd MCK model to another over-screened weak coupling spin-(K \u2212 2Sd + 1) MCK model. For the case of K = 4Sd, we have Sd = Sd, and both Sd and Sd describe the same objects: the two models are then said to be self-dual. For example, for the case of spin1/2 MCK model, two-channel model is self-dual. One important consequence of the duality relationship between the two over-screened models is that the RG equations are also dual; while the strong coupling model has an irrelevant coupling J that flows down to the intermediate fixed point J \u2217, the weak coupling model has a relevant coupling J that flows up to the same fixed point J\u2217 = J \u2217. From the RG equation for the general spin-S MCK model, we know that J\u2217 = 2K\u03c1\u2032 , where \u03c1\n\u2032 is the DOS for the bath of the weak coupling Hamiltonian. This constrains the form of the scaling factor \u03b3:\nJ\u2217 = \u03b34t2 J \u2217 = 2 K\u03c1\u2032 =\u21d2 \u03b3 = 1 4t2 J \u22172 = 1 K2t2\u03c1\u03c1\u2032 . (65)\nApart from the strong-weak duality, there exists another set of dual pairs in the MCK model. This was hinted at when we looked at the degree of compensation in eq.(13). Since \u0393 depends only on the magnitude of \u03b4, both \u00b1\u03b4 will give the same degree of compensation, same ground state energy\nand same ground state degeneracy ( gSdK = |\u03b4|+ 1 ) .\nThe definition of \u03b4 implies the following duality transformation: K \u2192 2Sd, Sd \u2192 K2 . That is, we transform from a K\u2212channel MCK model with spinSd impurity, to a 2Sd-channel MCK with a spinK 2 impurity. The exactly-screened model K = 2Sd maps on to itself and is therefore self-dual under this transformation.\nFor K 6= 2Sd, we transform an over-screened model into an under-screened model and vice versa. This duality relationship allows us to infer the RG scaling behaviour of one of the models if we know that of the other. Importantly, we see that the existence of an intermediate coupling fixed point in the MCK model for a given K and Sd leads to the conclusion that the 2Sd-channel spinK 2 model has a strong coupling fixed point."

(66)\nFor the special case Ji = J\u2200i, we get the usual isotropic star graph model. For the case of spin-1/2 impurity, we find that the Hamiltonian with any value of Ji > 0 has K fold ground state degeneracy. This shows that the ground state degeneracy of the star graph model is extremely robust against the channel anisotropy; the ground state degeneracy does not change until at least one Ji vanishes.\nWe have demonstrated this numerically for a three channel anisotropic star graph model. In Fig. 19(a), we show that if two couplings are kept constant and equal to one another (J1 = J2 = 1) and the third coupling J3 is tuned from some finite value to zero, the degeneracy does not change from 3 to 2 until J3 becomes zero. At\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 18\nthat point, the model becomes a two channel Kondo problem. We also show in Fig. 19(b) that taking the coupling J3 fixed to 1 and varying the common coupling J1 = J2 from non-zero to zero is equivalent to keeping J1 = J2 = 1 fixed and taking J3 to infinity. In this case, when the coupling J1 = J2 = 0, the degeneracy becomes one and reveals the single channel nature of the problem.\nThe above demonstration makes it clear that the ground state degeneracy can change only when at least one of the Kondo couplings vanish. This can be realised under RG flow if one considers the anisotropic MCK model.

(67)\nWe consider the specific case where K\u22121 channels have the same coupling J1 = J2 = ... = JK\u22121 = J+ and the remaining channel has a different coupling JK = J\u2212. The RG equations for such a model are\n\u2206J\u00b1 |\u2206D| = \u2212 J 2\u00b1\u03c1 D\u00b1 + \u03c12J\u00b1 2 [ (K \u2212 1)J 2+ D+ + J 2\u2212 D\u2212 ] , (68) where D\u00b1 = \u03c9 \u2212 D2 \u2212 J\u00b1 4 are the denominators of the URG equations. Setting J+ = J\u2212 leads to the critical fixed point at J \u2217+ = J \u2217\u2212 = J\u2217 = 2K\u03c1 . We now perturb around this fixed point by defining new variables j\u00b1 = J\u00b1 \u2212 J\u2217. We also assume that the bandwidth is large enough so that D\u00b1 ' \u03c9\u2212 D2 \u2212 J\u22174 = \u2212|D\u2217|. Performing a linear stability analysis about j\u00b1 = 0 then reveals the following two possibilities:\n(a) If j\u2212 < 0 and j+ > 0, the deviation j\u2212 is relevant and J\u2212 flows to zero. The flow of j+ are constrained such that the remaining couplings J+ flow to the stable intermediate fixed point of the K \u2212 1 channel MCK model: J+,\u2217 = 2(K\u22121)\u03c1 . (b) If j\u2212 > 0 and j+ < 0, the couplings J+ are irrelevant, and this leads to a single channel Kondo model described by the coupling J\u2212 which flows to strong coupling.\nThese conclusions show that the K channel intermediate fixed point is unstable under channel anisotropy [14, 32, 37, 45]. If one of the couplings becomes smaller than the rest, then that coupling flows to zero while the other K \u2212 1 couplings flow to the K\u22121 channel fixed point. On the other hand, if K\u22121 couplings are smaller than a single coupling, then the smaller couplings vanish while the remaining coupling flows to strong-coupling."

            "text": "In summary, we have explored the low-energy behaviour of the MCK models using the unitary\nrenormalization group (URG) method, and obtained insight into the role of ground state degeneracy and quantum-mechanical frustration in shaping the nonFermi liquid physics and criticality. We have also obtained the zero-temperature phase diagram of the MCK problem and an effective Hamiltonian with a simple zero bandwidth limit (i.e., the star graph), and shown that it determines the ground state energy, wavefunction and degeneracy of the MCK models. The star graph is found to explain much of the physics of over-screening and criticality of the MCK: this includes the singularities in the susceptibility and magnetisation, as well as a reduction in the degree to which the impurity spin is compensated. This demonstrates the ground state degeneracy of the star graph (which is unity for single-channel, and greater than 1 for the over-screened models) as the key ingredient in leading to the qualitative and quantitative differences of the MCK from the singlechannel Kondo model. The presence of ground state degeneracy also allows the construction of non-local twist operators and fractional excitations that span the degenerate ground state manifold. Integrating out the quantum fluctuations of the impurity leads to an all-toall effective Hamiltonian for the local conduction bath spins of the star graph. This Hamiltonian is found to contain inter-channel quantum fluctuations involving the scattering of electron-hole pairs, thereby creating a local Mott-liquid phase proximate to the impurity.\nThe low energy effective Hamiltonian (LEH) for the excitations of the MCK problem is then obtained by considering fluctuations of the conduction bath lying above the ground state. The LEH for the 2-channel Kondo confirms the absence of any local Fermi liquid physics, as well as the presence of a local marginal Fermi liquid arising from inter-channel off-diagonal scattering processes. This reinforces the idea that the ground state degeneracy is crucial to the appearance of non-Fermi liquid physics at the MCK fixed point. Further, we confirm that this arises from an orthogonality catastrophe in the form of singularities that are absent at exact screening. Studies of various thermodynamic properties (presented in the Supplementary Material [74]) from this 2-channel Kondo LEH (e.g., specific heat and susceptibility) show logarithmic dependence at low temperature, in agreement with the literature [9, 30\u201335,42\u201346].\nThe non-diagonal nature of the low energy theory is further investigated through several measures of entanglement. The entanglement entropy calculated from (i) the minimum Jz states, (ii)between the impurity and the outer spins as well as (iii) that between an outer spin and the rest, is observed to saturate to ln 2 in the large channel limit. The opposite behaviour is observed in the maximum Jz\nFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective 19\nstate, where the entanglement entropy decreases with the increase of channel number. Moreover, the large values of inter-channel mutual information indicate high inter-channel correlation in the MCK ground state. Indeed, the power-law dependence of the multipartite information among the outer spins of the star graph model is similar to the power-law behavior of the all-to-all local Mott-liquid state. Importantly, the discontinuous behaviour in the entanglement entropy computed for the MCK ground state in the limit of vanishing bath dispersion, as compared to the smooth behaviour observed in its single-channel counterpart, points to the orthogonality catastrophe in the lowenergy phase of the multi-channel models. We confirm this by noting a similar discontinuous behaviour in the Bures distance computed between the density matrices computed from the ground states of the star graph (i.e., zero bath dispersion bandwidth) and the MCK (i.e, a non-zero the bath dispersion bandwidth). This discontinuity in the Bures distance is observed to grow as the number of channels is increased. Finally, the URG study of the channel anisotropic MCK shows the expected critical nature of the channel isotropic fixed point: under any anisotropic perturbations, the RG flows go towards either the single-channel model or the symmetric MCK with one less channel coupled to the impurity. This is complemented by the study of the star graph ground state degeneracy which shows that the degeneracy changes only if one or more couplings vanishes. Taken together, we conclude that in the presence of channel anisotropy, the degeneracy of the MCK ground state does not change until the RG reaches the stable fixed point with one (or more channels) completely disconnected.\nWe end by discussing some open directions. Our work presents a template for the study of how a degenerate ground state manifold arising from symmetry and duality properties in a multichannel quantum impurity model can lead to novel multicritical phases at intermediate coupling. Employed within an auxiliary model framework (such as dynamical meanfield theory), such quantum impurity models will likely unveil novel quantum critical points (or phases) in bulk lattice models of strongly correlated electrons and spins that arise from the competition of various quantum (or symmetry broken) orders. Since the degeneracy of the star graph is observed to be robust under anisotropy, it appears relevant to study the case of the MCK with superconducting leads, i.e., conduction baths with a superconducting gap. Specifically, it will be interesting to see whether the gap can separate the ground state manifold of the star graph from any low-energy excitations, providing thereby a protection for the topological quantum numbers associated with the degenerate ground state manifold. The duality\ntransformations then allow us to view the protected ground state as that belonging to an isolated larger quantum spin. This holds potential for applications in quantum information and quantum computation (see [118] for an alternate proposal based on an MCK model). Interesting behaviour may also be obtained by studying the MCK model with an easyaxis anisotropy term ( J i )2\nalong one of the axes (i). Such a term would, if it is able to survive the RG flows towards low energy, lift the degeneracy of the ground state and make it possible to achieve perfect screening even with K > 2Sd. Further, understanding the nature of the multicriticality in the MCK model displayed upon introducing channel anisotropy is in itself an important problem (see [119] for a recent work). One can also study the multichannel lattice models [120, 121] to better understand the role played by singlet frustration and ground state degeneracy in the competition between the local moment versus the heavy fermion sea. Finally, we note that experimental realisations of the star graph have been studied recently with regards to aspects of NMR-based quantum information processing such as algorithmic cooling and information scrambling (see [122] for a review). It will be interesting to see whether some of the results obtained by us for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg star graph can be tested experimentally in a similar manner. Finally, it is tempting to speculate whether a similar study can be conducted for a MCK system of 1D Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid conduction leads [123]."

We insert a magnetic field that acts only on the impurity and then attempt to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. H(h) = J\u2217 ~Sd \u00b7 ~stot + hSzd .

(3)\nThis means the Hamiltonian is already block-diagonal in the quantum number stot. Let us represent the quantum number of sztot by m. For a particular stot, m can take values from the set [\u2212stot, stot]. The spin Szd can also take values \u00b1 12 . From now on, we will assume we are in the subspace of a particular stot = M , so we will ignore that quantum number and write the kets simply as |Szd ,m\u3009. So, the notation |\u2191,\u22121\u3009 means the state with Szd = 12 and m = \u22121. We will now show that even inside the block of 2 \u00d7 stot (or 2 \u00d7 stot + 1, depending on where it is odd or even) defined by a particular value of stot, the Hamiltonian actually separates into decoupled 2 \u00d7 2 blocks. To see why, first note that the terminal states |\u2193,\u2212M\u3009 and |\u2191,M\u3009 are already eigenstates, because they cannot scatter (the impurity can only flip down, and this would require the bath to flip up, but sztot is already at its maximum value M). The other 2M \u2212 2 states can be organized into 2 \u00d7 2 blocks formed by the states |\u2191,m\u3009 and |\u2193,m+ 1\u3009 for m \u2208 [\u2212M,M \u2212 1]. The fact that this block does not interact with the other blocks can be observation: if there was some other state which when acted upon by the Hamiltonian gave a non-zero projection on |\u2191,m\u3009, it would have to come from Szd =\u2193, and this would mean the bath spin would have had to flip down. This means the bath spin in that state would have to be m+ 1, and that is precisely the other state in the block.\nDefining hm = 1 2 (Jm+ h) and x M m = M(M + 1)\u2212m(m+ 1), the 2\u00d7 2 blocks can be written as\nHm =\n( hm\nJ 2 \u221a xMm\nJ 2 \u221a xMm \u2212 ( hm + J/2\n) ) .

This is yet not the complete partition function, because we have not accounted for the possibility that there multiple subspaces of M . For example, the K = 3 case states can be obtained by adding the third spin-half onto the states S = 0, 1. S = 0 gives stot = 1/2 and S = 1 gives stot = 1/2, 3/2. So, stot = 1/2 appears twice. These two subspaces are actually orthogonal, because the quantum numbers for the individual channels are different. We need to count the number of instances of a particular subspace stot = M . It turns out that this number is given by r K M =\nK\u22121CK/2\u2212M , which means the correct partition function is\nZ(h) =\nMmax\u2211\nM=Mmin\nrKM   M\u22121\u2211\nm=\u2212M, m\u2208Z\n2e\u03b2J/4 cosh\u03b2 \u221a J2xMm /4 + \u03b1 2 + 2e\u2212\u03b2JM/2 cosh\u03b2h/2   .

Put differently, the presence of K singlets shows that all K channels are trying to screen the impurity simultaneously.

For this, we first note that the form eq. (12) of the polarised state shows that all the individual terms in the more explicit form of eq. (11) involve the impurity hybridising with the bath. In eq.

This term therefore contributes the entire excess charge of unity across all the channels, which results in an excess charge contribution of n (l) exc = 1/K to each channel. With these in mind, the total excess charge contributed to each channel from the state in eq. (11) is\nn(l)exc = 1\nK(1 +K)\n[ 1 + ( K2 \u00d7 1\nK\n)] = 1\nK . (13)\nThis result then connects to the Friedel scattering phase shift (eq.(20) of the main manuscript) and the magnetisation of the impurity (eq.(21) of the main manuscript). In this way, the excess charge n (l) exc of the star graph is also observed to guide the RG flow of the MCK problem to the intermediate coupling fixed point (eq.(55) of the main manuscript), and lead to the power-law behaviour of various thermodynamic quantities at the fixed point (eq.(56) of the main manuscript)."

Note that because of the degeneracy of the ground state subspace, there are multiple ground states characterised by different values of Jz = Sz + Szd , and different ground states lead to different values of EQ.\nThe variation of EQ is shown in Fig.(1) for the case of Sd = 1/2, as functions of the number of channels K as well as the ground state value Jz in which EQ is being calculated. For a particular channel K, we find that the maximum |EQ| is obtained for the state with smallest magnitude of Jz (Jz = 0 for odd K and Jz = \u00b11/2 for even K), whereas |EQ| is minimum in the states with largest Jz (Jz = \u00b1J). The larger values of |EQ| indicate that the quantum fluctuations are largest in the states with minimum Jz, and these states can be thought of as the counterparts to the maximally entangled singlet seen in the single-channel Kondo problem. This behaviour persists as K 1: the magnitude |QQ| associated with the |Jz| = J states vanish, showing the classical nature of these states and the lack of quantum fluctuations in that limit. On the other hand, the state |Jz| = |Jz|min has a non-zero |EQ| in the large K limit and hence contains some non-zero quantum fluctuations, showing the true quantum nature of this macroscopic singlet state."

This is because the total Hilbert space dimension \u2211 d( ) is simply 2\nN (N being the total number of 1-particle states in the Hilbert space), and therefore log \u2211 d( ) = N log 2 is always an integer multiple of N .

The condensation of such electron-hole pairs has already been shown in [2,3].

Let\u2019s define one such translation operator T\u0302\u00b5 = e iP\u0302 cm\u00b5 which gives a periodic shift along the closed path C\u00b5.

The full Hilbert space consists of the star graph (formed by the impurity site and the zeroth sites of all channels) and the reduced conduction bath (formed by sites 1 and beyond\nSupplementary Materials for \u201cFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective\u201d 11\nin all channels).

We will work in the Sztot = 0 sector. To construct the non-magnetic ground-states, we will assume the presence of gapless excitations vanishingly close to the Fermi surface in the reduced conduction bath.

            "heading": "4.1. Details of the URG method",
            "text": "The non-trivial nature of the impurity problem arises from the fact that the many-particle correlation between the impurity spin and the conduction electrons induces a many-particle interaction among the conduction electron states. This means that within the conduction band, the states at high and low energies get entangled with each other, leading to what is called UV-IR mixing. One of the methods of obtaining the low-energy physics while taking into account the effect of the high energy degrees of freedom is the renormalisation group (RG) approach. The specific variant of RG used in this work is the unitary renormalisation group (URG) method developed by some of us in Refs. [2, 3, 28\u201332]. The URG proceeds by applying unitary transformations on the Hamiltonian in order to decouple the high-energy k\u2212states, leading to a reduction in the effective bandwidth and changes in the couplings for the low-energy degrees of freedom in the process. This leads to a sequence of renormalised Hamiltonians, and hence the coupling RG equations. While this is similar in spirit to the Poor Man\u2019s scaling approach of Anderson as applied to the single channel Kondo model [33], there are several differences between the methods that will be apparent when we describe the method in more detail below.\nWe start by defining a UV-IR scheme for the single-particle electronic states ~k = (kF + |~k|)k\u0302. We label the single-particle ~k\u2212states in terms of their normal distance \u039b = |~k| from the Fermi surface (FS) and the orientation of the unit vectors s\u0302 = k\u0302, where s\u0302 = \u2207 k|\u2207 k| | k=EF . Each s\u0302 represents a direction that is normal to the FS. Combining these two labels with the spin index \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193, each single-particle state can be uniquely labelled as |j, l\u3009 = |(kF + \u039bj)s\u0302, \u03c3\u3009 , l \u2261 (s\u0302, \u03c3). The \u039b\u2019s are arranged as follows: \u039bN > \u039bN\u22121 > . . . > 0, such that \u039bN is farthest from the Fermi surface and is hence the most energetic (UV) while \u039b0 is closest to the Fermi surface and is least energetic (IR). The URG proceeds by disentangling these states \u039bj , starting from those near the UV and gradually scaling towards the IR. This leads to the Hamiltonian flow equation [34]\nH(j\u22121) = U(j)H(j)U \u2020 (j) , (63)\nwhere the unitary operation U(j) is the unitary map at RG step j. U(j) disentangles all the electronic states |k\u039bj s\u0302m , \u03c3\u3009 on the isogeometric curve and has the form [2,34]\nU(j) = \u220f\nl\nUj,l, Uj,l = 1\u221a 2\n\u2211\nl\n[1 + \u03b7j,l \u2212 \u03b7\u2020j,l] , (64)\nwhere l sums over the states on the isoenergetic shell at distance \u039bj , and \u03b7j,l are electron-hole transition operators following the algebra{\n\u03b7j,l, \u03b7 \u2020 j,l\n} = 1 , [ \u03b7j,l, \u03b7 \u2020 j,l ] = 2n\u0302j,l \u2212 1 . (65)\nThe transition operator can be expressed in terms of the off-diagonal part of the Hamiltonian, HXj,l = Trj,l(c \u2020 j,lHj)cj,l + h.c., and the diagonal part H D j,l (kinetic energy and self-energies):\n\u03b7j,l = Trj,l(c \u2020 j,lHj,l)cj,l\n1\n\u03c9\u0302j,l \u2212 Trj,l(HDj,ln\u0302j,l)n\u0302j,l .

The operator \u03c9\u0302j,l accounts for the quantum fluctuations arising from the non-commutation between different parts of the renormalised Hamiltonian and has the following form [34]\n\u03c9\u0302j,l = H D j,l +H X j,l \u2212HXj,l\u22121 .

The vanishing of the denominator can be shown to be concomitant with the vanishing of the off-diagonal component HX [34], and the fixed point value of the quantum fluctuation operator is equal to one of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The fixed point Hamiltonian H\u2217 consists of the renormalised, still-entangled degrees of freedom \u039bj that lie inside the window \u039b\u2217: \u039bj < \u039b\u2217, as well as the integrals of motion (IOMs) that were decoupled by the URG transformations along the way.

For the exactly-screened case, the star graph decouples from the conduction bath, leaving behind a local Fermi liquid interaction on the first site. Similarly, in the under-screened regime, the ground state is composed of states where the impurity spin is only partially screened by the conduction channels. If a particular configuration of the bath-impurity system has the total conduction bath spin down, the impurity will have a residual up spin. This induces a ferromagnetic super-exchange coupling that is irrelevant under RG, so this fixed point is stable as well.\nWe now come to the over-screened case, where there is a residual spin on the conduction channel site. The neighbouring electrons will now hop in with spins opposite to that of the impurity, so an antiferromagnetic interaction will be induced, and such an interaction is relevant under the RG. This shows that the over-screened regime cannot have a stable strong coupling fixed point, and we need to search for an intermediate coupling fixed point. We therefore need the generator of the unitary transformation that incorporates third order scattering scatterings explicitly. We should take account of all possible processes that render the set of states {|n\u0302q\u03b2 = 1\u3009 , |n\u0302q\u03b2 = 0\u3009} diagonal. The higher order generator itself has two scattering processes, such that the entire renormalisation term c\u2020q\u03b2T\u03b7 has in total three coherent processes. The complete generator up to third order can be written as\n\u03b7 = 1 \u03c9\u0302 \u2212HD T \u2020c ' 1 \u03c9\u2032 \u2212HD T \u2020c+\n1\n\u03c9\u2032 \u2212HD HX\n1\n\u03c9\u2032 \u2212HD T \u2020c+\n1\n\u03c9\u2032 \u2212HD T \u2020c\n1\n\u03c9\u2032 \u2212HD HX , (74)\nwhere HX = J \u2211 k,k\u2032<\u039bj ,\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\n~Sd \u00b7 ~s\u03b1\u03b1\u2032c\u2020k\u03b1ck\u2032\u03b1\u2032 is scattering between the entangled electrons. There are two third order terms in the above equation corresponding to the two possible sequences in which the processes can occur\nSupplementary Materials for \u201cFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective\u201d 14\nwhile keeping the total renormalisation c\u2020q\u03b2T\u03b7 diagonal in q\u03b2. The second order processes remain unchanged.

(75)\n\u2206H (2) (j) and \u2206H (3) (j) are the renormalisation arising from the second and third order processes respectively.\nIt is easier to see the RG flow of the couplings if we write the Hamiltonian in terms of the eigenstates of Szd . These eigenstates are defined by Szd |md\u3009 = md |md\u3009 ,md \u2208 [\u2212S, S]. In terms of these eigenstates, the Hamiltonian becomes\nH = \u2211\nk\u03c3\nk\u03c4k\u03c3 + S\u2211\nmd=\u2212S\n\u2211\nkl, \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\nJ\u03c3md |md\u3009 \u3008md| c \u2020 k\u03c3cl\u03c3 +\n\u2211\nkl\nS\u22121\u2211\nmd=\u2212S J tmd\n( |md + 1\u3009 \u3008md| s\u2212kl + h.c. ) ,(76)\nwhere k, l sum over the momentum states, \u03c3 sums over the spin indices, J\u03c3m = 1 2\u03c3mJ in the UV Hamiltonian, and J tm = J 1 2 \u221a S(S + 1)\u2212m(m+ 1) is the coupling that connects |m\u3009 and |m+ 1\u3009. We first calculate \u2206H(2)(j) . There will be two types of processes - those processes that start from an occupied state (particle sector) and those that start from a vacant state (hole sector). Due to particle hole symmetry of the Hamiltonian, they will be equal to each other and we will only calculate the particle sector contribution.\nIn the particle sector, we have (n\u0302q\u03b2 = 1), so we will work at a negative energy shell q = \u2212D. The renormalisation can schematically represented as HI0\n1 \u03c9\u2212HDq\u03b2 HI1 . Both H I 0 and H I 1 have all three operators S z d , S \u00b1 d .\nWe first consider specifically the case of spin- 12 impurity. Those terms that have identical operators on both sides can be ignored because Szd 2 = constant and S\u00b1 2 = 0. All the six terms that will renormalise the Hamiltonian have a spin flip operator on at least one side of the Greens function. This means that in the denominator of the Greens function, Szd and s z qq have to be anti-parallel in order to produce a non-zero result for that term. This means we can identically replace Szds z qq = \u2212 14 . Also, in the particle sector, the Greens function always has cq\u03b2 in front of it, so q\u03c4q\u03b2 = D 2 . The upshot of all this is that the denominator of all scattering processes for the spin1 2 impurity Hamiltonian will be \u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 . We now come to the general case of spin-S impurity. The various terms that renormalise the Hamiltonian can be described in terms of the bath spin operators that come into them. For example, the term that has sz on both sides of the intervening Greens function can be represented as z|z. There are 7 such terms: z|z,\u00b1|\u2213, z|\u00b1,\u00b1|z. Each of these terms occurs both in the particle and the hole sectors. We will demonstrate the calculation of two of these terms. The z|z +|\u2212 terms evaluate in the following manner.\nz|z : \u2211\nkk\u2032,m,\u03c3\nc\u2020q\u03c3ck\u2032\u03c3 |m\u3009 \u3008m| J\u03c3m\n2\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J2 \u03c3Szd |m\u3009 \u3008m| c\u2020k\u03c3cq\u03c3 = \u2212\n\u2211\nkk\u2032,m,\u03c3\nnq\u03c3 J\u03c3m 2c\u2020k\u03c3ck\u2032\u03c3 |m\u3009 \u3008m| \u03c9m,\u03c3 \u2212 D2 + J2 \u03c3m ,\n+|\u2212 : \u2211\nkk\u2032,m\nc\u2020q\u2191ck\u2032\u2193 |m\u3009 \u3008m+ 1| J tm\n2\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J2Szd |m+ 1\u3009 \u3008m| c\u2020k\u2193cq\u2191 = \u2212nq\u2191\n\u2211\nkk\u2032,m\nJ tm 2 c\u2020k\u2193ck\u2032\u2193 |m\u3009 \u3008m|\n\u03c9m+1,\u2191 \u2212 D2 + J2 (m+ 1) . (77)\nWe similarly compute the rest of the terms. We again define \u2211 q n\u0302q\u03c3 = n(D). To compare with the spin1 2\nRG equations, we will transform the general spin-S \u03c9 to the spin- 12 \u03c9, using \u03c9m,\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c9 \u2212 J2 ( m\u03c3 \u2212 12 ) . The renormalisation in J\u03c3m is\n\u2206J\u03c3m = \u2212n(D) (J\u03c3m)\n2 + ( J t m\u2212 1+\u03c32 )2 \u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 . (78)\nHere, we have defined J tm = 0 for |m| > S. Two relations can be obtained from this RG equation, the RG equations for the sum and difference of the couplings: J\u00b1m = 1 2 ( J\u2191m \u00b1 J\u2193m ) . The RG equation for the sum of the couplings is\n\u2206J+m = \u2212n(D) \u2211 \u03c3 (J \u03c3 m) 2 + \u2211 \u03c3 ( J t m\u2212 1+\u03c32 )2\n2 ( \u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4\n) = \u2212n(D)J 2\n4\nS(S + 1)\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 . (79)\nSupplementary Materials for \u201cFrustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective\u201d 15\nThis is an m\u2212independent piece, so it can be summed over to produce an impurity-independent potential scattering term, which we ignore.\nThe second is the RG equation for the difference of the couplings:\n\u2206J\u2212m = \u2212n(D) 1\n2\n( J tm\u22121 )2 \u2212 (J tm) 2\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 = \u22121 4\nn(D)mJ2\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 .

(81)\nWe can also obtain the RG equation for J from the transverse renormalisation:\n\u2206J tm = \u2212 n(D)J tm\n( J\u2193m + J \u2191 m+1 )\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 = \u22121 2\nn(D)J tmJ\n\u03c9 \u2212 D2 + J4 .
