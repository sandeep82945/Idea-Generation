Risk factors include premature infants with respiratory distress (RD) syndrome, receiving active resuscitation, meconium aspiration syndrome, and aggressive mechanical ventilation. Several cases have also been reported related to COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a female newborn with a birth weight of 3300 grams a COVID-19 confirmed 35-year-old G3P2A0 mother. The baby was not crying at born and the amniotic fluid was stained green. The baby experienced RD and was intubated. A babygram was performed at the age of 5 h with the impression of a too deep endotracheal tube, neonatal pneumonia, and PPC. COVID-19 RT-PCR examination of the baby was positive. There were no signs of cardiac tamponade, so it was decided to take conservative and supportive management. CONCLUSION: Resolution of PPC was found on repeated babygram 26 h later. The baby was then discharged after 19 days of treatment. Edited by: Ksenija Bogoeva-Kostovska Citation: Harancang KP, Afandy JE, Dewiyanti L, Hidajati Z, Sumarni N, Lukmasari A, Pramana C.

Its one of the rarest pulmonary air leak syndromes, but the incidence is the highest in the neonatal period [1], [2]. Risk factors for PPC include premature infants with respiratory distress (RD) syndrome, receiving active resuscitation, meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), and aggressive mechanical ventilation (MV). If not treated properly, PPC can lead to catastrophic complications of cardiac tamponade, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality [3]. Treatments include needle pericardiocentesis, continuous pericardial drainage, and in certain conditions conservative and supportive approach could be an option [4], [5].\nOnly 3% of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had a positive PCR examination. The clinical presentation of neonates with COVID-19 varies widely, from asymptomatic to critical condition. Among symptomatic neonates, the most common\nclinical presentations were RD (40%), fever (32%), and feeding intolerance (24%) [6]. At the KRMT Wongsonegoro Hospital in Semarang, Indonesia, one case of a premature baby with COVID-19 has been reported with severe respiratory failure [7]. Several cases of PPC also have been reported to be related to COVID-19. [8], [9], [10].\nOn this occasion, we present a case of a female newborn with RD and COVID-19 who experienced spontaneous resolution of PPC with conservative therapy."

The baby was born by cesarean section with indications of prolonged labor. The baby was not crying at born and the amniotic fluid was stained green.\n56 https://oamjms.eu/index.php/mjms/index\nNeonatal resuscitation was performed, dark greenish fluid was obtained from mouth and nose suction. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is performed because of inadequate breathing and the baby looks cyanotic. The general condition looks weak, whimpering. APGAR scores were 5-5-7 at 1, 5, and 10 min. The baby was sent to the Isolation NICU and given non-invasive ventilation oxygen therapy with 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 6 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 12 cmH2O.\nOne hour after birth, the baby is desaturated with SatO2 40% on PPV, there was chest retraction, nostrils breath, cold extremities, and capillary refill time >2 s. It was decided to intubate with size 3.5 uncuffed endotracheal tube (ETT), 9 cm deep, attached to MV with pressure control mode, inspiratory pressure (Pinsp) 13 cmH2O, PEEP 8 2O, respiratory rate (RR) 40, FiO2 100%. A no. Eight orogastric tube was also installed, there is green residue. An umbilical catheter was attached to a depth of 7 cm. After the ETT was installed, heart rate (HR) was 110\u2013160 beats/min, RR 75\u201390 times/min, SatO2 77\u201390%. Physical examination reveals marked RD. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs or additional sounds.\nA babygram was performed at the age of 5 h, the impression was too deep ETT, features of neonatal pneumonia, and PPC (Figure 1). Clinically, there were no signs of cardiac tamponade and hemodynamically\nstable. The ETT was withdrawn for 1 cm, the MV setting was maintained. After withdrawal of the ETT, there was clinical improvement with vital signs HR 130\u2013150 beats/ min, RR 60\u201380 times/min, SatO2 96\u201399%. On the 2nd day, the results of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 RT-PCR examination were positive. A repeat babygram was performed at 31 h of age with the impression of neonatal pneumonia and resolution of PPC (Figure 2). The COVID-19 RT-PCR examination was negative on the 6th and 7th days. On the 11th day, echocardiography was performed, the impression of normal cardiac structure was found, there was no PPC.\nOn the next clinical course, the baby had shock, sepsis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Weaning of oxygen therapy was carried out gradually until breathing with room air on the 14th day. On the 19th day, the baby was discharged."

            "text": "PPC is categorized into two types according to its pathogenesis. Spontaneous PPC in neonates is associated with pulmonary diseases such as hypoplasia and RD syndrome. Traumatic PPC occurs by pleural-pericardial communication associated with chest trauma and iatrogenic chest injury [1].\nOpen Access Maced J Med Sci. 2022 Jan 19; 10(C):55-58. 57\nThe pathogenesis of PPC is thought to be due to high bronchoalveolar pressure causing rupture of alveoli and air leakage into the perivascular interstitium of the lung, hilum, and mediastinum, then to the pericardial space on pulmonary vein reflection which is postulated to have an anatomical weakness [3].\nAirway obstruction by the meconium plug causes high resistance to airflow and the presence of trapped air. Complete obstruction by meconium can cause atelectasis [10]. When the number of alveoli that can expand during inspiration is reduced, the risk of spontaneous rupture is greater because of overdistention [11], [12]. This is consistent with what happened to our patient where RD was suspected due to MAS and neonatal pneumonia. The diagnosis of MAS can be established based on criteria: there were RD in newborns with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, oxygen demand to maintain saturation above 92%, need for oxygen therapy within 2 h of life for at least 12 h, and the absence of airway, lung, and heart malformations [11]. Although in our patient the radiological picture did not support the diagnosis of MAS.\nThe spectrum of PPC can vary from asymptomatic to RD, muffled to absent heart sound, and severe hemodynamic instability [3]. Chest X-ray is the standard diagnostic method with the classic finding in PPC is \u201chalo sign\u201d i.e., air completely surrounds, and limits the heart but does not extend beyond the reflection of the pericardium into the great vessels [13]. When PPC is small, the pericardial air may not surround the heart completely and exist only along a single border called \u201cpericardial line\u201d [14]. In our patient, pericardial air was found and did not extend beyond great vessels consistent with the PPC image. The radiological differential diagnosis is \u201cspinnaker-Sail sign\u201d showing neonatal pneumomediastinum [15].\nRegarding the use of MV, a study by Cohen et al. showed that the incidence of PPC was associated with high PIP with a mean of 42 mmHg equivalent to 57 cmH2O (range 26\u201360 mmHg or 35\u201382 cmH2O) [16]. Our patient used a relatively low PIP of 13 cmH2O.\nIn Burt and Lester\u2019s study of 50 patients with PPC, 28% had an ETT misplacement [14]. Based on the babygram in our patient, it is known that the distal tip\u2019s location of ETT is too deep in the thoracal vertebrae III so that it is one of the predispositions for PPC.\nSeveral cases of PPC have been reported in adult COVID-19 patients [8], [9], [10]. The underlying mechanism is suspected that COVID-19 triggers inflammatory dysregulation that causes diffuse damage and alveolar rupturen [9]. SARS-CoV2 infection in our patient may be an additional risk factor for developing PPC.\nIn asymptomatic cases, a conservative approach and supportive care are the mainstays. 100% oxygen therapy causing \u201cnitrogen washout\u201d can be used in stable infants but not in newborn\n<32 weeks of gestational age due to complications of hyperoxia [3], [14]. However, according to the study of Shaireen et al., there was no difference in the resolution time of pneumothorax between neonates receiving high concentration, medium concentration, or room air oxygen therapy. Hence, oxygen therapy should be given based on oxygen saturation targets [17]. In our patient, it was decided to take a conservative approach because there were no signs of cardiac tamponade, FiO2 100% oxygen therapy is maintained to meet the oxygen saturation target. Percutaneous pericardial aspiration may be attempted if hemodynamic instability results from tamponade. Continuous pericardial drainage may be used in recurrent and extensive cases [3], [14]."
