    "abstractText": "In a repetition-change paradigm it was explored whether the skin conductance response (SCR) and the heart rate (HR) response similarly reflect involuntary and voluntary orienting. Seven orienting stimuli, consisting of six contextually novel stimuli and one novel change, were presented to 144 participants. In order to evoke voluntary orienting, the signal value of the contextually novel stimuli was manipulated by task instruction. Results suggest that the SCR is a manifestation of the involuntary orienting response (iOR). The HR, however, showed a non-uniform pattern of response and turned out to be susceptible to voluntary orienting. While it responded to the last orienting stimulus, the novel change, with a clear-cut deceleration, the response to the first orienting stimulus had a polyphase structure and was sensitive to repetition and signal value. The HR response is, thus, of limited value as an indicator of the iOR because of its striking susceptibility to voluntary orienting.",

            "text": "Psychological research is, whenever possible, guided by theory. However, stringent hypothesis testing or reasonable practical application of a theory is often reliant on good indicators of processes or latent variables mentioned in the theory. In search of such indicators, a great deal of work has been invested by the international research community. But even in a field of research as fundamental as the investigation of orienting, it has not yet been convincingly established empirically whether two well-known autonomic responses to novel stimuli\u2014the skin conductance response (SCR) and the heart rate (HR) response\u2014indicate the brain activity of the orienting mechanism in an unambiguous and comparable manner. This mechanism was introduced to psychology years ago by an influential theory of orienting (cf. Sokolov, 1960, 1963, 1975, 1990) and it is still crucial to the understanding of human behaviour and learning. For this reason,\nwe address the question of whether these two peripheral responses similarly reflect novelty detection, the theoretical basis or key process for the triggering of the involuntary orienting response (OR). In this vein, we are interested in whether both of them are valid indicators of novelty detection and thus indicate involuntary orienting straightforwardly and independent of voluntary orienting.\nNovelty detection, i.e., detection of a contextually or actually novel event, is typically linked to avoiding dangers, adapting to environmental changes and improving one\u2019s knowledge. A novel stimulus by definition evokes the involuntary OR, an evolutionarily arisen response mechanism that ensures that processing resources are automatically focussed on unknown events to incorporate them into an enhanced representation of the world (Lynn, 1966; Pavlov, 1927). Novelty is also considered to trigger involuntary orienting because of an inherent and thus unconditioned signal value\u2014that is, unfamiliar stimuli point to potential but vital consequences that must be attended to (Campbell et\u00a0al., 1997). As soon as the OR releasing stimulus occurs repeatedly without any consequences it becomes familiar and its relevance for improvement of perception and further processing decreases rapidly. This selective adaptation is one of the most elementary forms of learning and memory (Ranganath & Rainer, 2003).\nInvoluntary orienting is thus driven by novelty detection and inevitable coupled with an automatic or passive shift of\n* Heinz Zimmer zimmerh@uni-koeln.de\nFabian Richter farichter@dhzb.de\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychology, University of\u00a0Cologne, 50931\u00a0Cologne, Germany\n2 Department of\u00a0Psychosomatic Medicine, German Heart Center Berlin, 13353\u00a0Berlin, Germany\n1 3\nattention because attentional control is in a sense captured by novelty (Johnston et\u00a0al., 1990). Nevertheless, involuntary orienting may subsequently be replaced by voluntary orienting as soon as attention is controlled by recognising clues for a significant event that is relevant to goals or actions. The conception of two different operating or control modes underlying different orienting activities originates in the classical distinction between two basic varieties of attention: (i) passive, non-voluntary, effortless attention; and (ii) active and voluntary attention (James, 1890). In other words, it is taken for granted that selective processing can be performed passively and actively (Johnston & Dark, 1986, p. 63). It is, however, important to bear in mind that attention (selection) is not orienting, and that a different attentional control as well as its triggering is only one defining feature of the differentiation between involuntary and voluntary orienting. Other distinctive features rest upon the involved processing operations and, what still has to be proved (see below), their consequences in peripheral response systems.\nThus, orienting is thought to be a brain response to novelty, significance, as well as an amalgam of both (e.g., Bernstein, 1969, 1979; Dawson et\u00a0al., 1989; Maltzman, 1979, 1990; Pendery & Maltzman, 1977; Sokolov, 1963, 1990). Some of the significant stimuli already have an inherent biological signal value, others acquire their signal value by conditioning or simply by instruction.\nWith this in mind, our current OR paradigm\u2014a special variant of the well-known repetition-change paradigm\u2014 was implemented to examine the effects of novelty and signal value on two presumable response manifestations of the OR, the skin conductance response and the heart rate response. To elicit an involuntary orienting response, a pure novelty OR, an OR associated with the involuntary and passive shift of attention, a contextually salient and unexpectedly occurring novel\u2014and consequently unfamiliar\u2014sound (change condition) was presented after a series of six familiar auditory stimuli. These familiar stimuli had a crucial feature in common, they belonged to a conceptual category (conceptual repetition condition): all of them were one-digit numerals. Moreover, independent of familiarity, the first stimulus in this series, in particular, can be regarded as contextually novel within the context of the particular experimental setting. This special event is thus expected to serve as a stimulant to another kind of novelty OR, an OR to contextual novelty. Beyond that, the present paradigm differs from classical variants especially by assigning a special signal value to some of the familiar stimuli that promotes voluntary orienting. Signal value was established by an instruction that prompted participants to pay close attention to three out of the six one-digit numerals (targets) and their immediate consequences. This instruction takes account of the hypothesis that the \u201csignificance contribution to the OR is achieved via frontal\nlobe activation of voluntary attention\u201d (Sokolov, 1990, p. 99), and it aims to emulate exploration behaviour, a striking element of orienting outside the laboratory world (Berlyne, 1966; Daffner et\u00a0al., 1998, 2003).\nIn a typical OR paradigm an exemplary OR manifestation is expected to show the unique features of the involuntary OR, response habituation and response recovery (Siddle, 1991; Sokolov, 1963). Response habituation is the expected and usually exponential amplitude decline with repeated stimulation. Response recovery is the subsequent increase in amplitude after a distinguishable change in stimulation. If this recovery does occur, the preceding response decline can be interpreted as a sign of a selective central nervous system (CNS) inhibition process (e.g., Sokolov, 1960, 1963; Voronin & Sokolov, 1960), because a generalised CNS process such as fatigue is incommensurate with response recovery. This selective inhibition process is usually called (inferred process of) habituation.\nBy definition, every unequivocal manifestation of Sokolov\u2019s involuntary OR (e.g., 1963) needs to show response habituation and response recovery. Sokolov (e.g., 1963, 1975) even emphasised that the effects of repetition and change should appear in all OR manifestations in a comparable manner.\nTo explain the selective nature of habituation, Sokolov (1963) introduced the concept of a \u201cneuronal model of the stimulus\u201d. Each occurrence of a redundant event increases the precision of this model and thus the (selective) inhibition of the OR, while the occurrence of a discrepancy, i.e., of a mismatch between stimulus and model, will again trigger an OR. The greater the mismatch, the larger will be the response recovery (Voronin & Sokolov, 1960).\nReferring to the question of whether the HR response is a manifestation of the involuntary OR pending issues mainly stem from conflicting empirical findings. Although, at times the HR exemplarily shows response recovery indicating (renewed) novelty processing (e.g., Bohlin et\u00a0al., 1981; Simons et\u00a0al., 1987, experiment II; Turpin et\u00a0al., 1999; Vossel & Zimmer, 1989a, 1992; Zimmer, 2002), the proofs about response habituation under pure stimulus repetition have been inconsistent (e.g., Barry, 1986; MacDonald et\u00a0al., 2015; Simons et\u00a0al., 1987; Turpin et\u00a0al., 1999; Vossel & Zimmer, 1989a). For a certain HR response\u2014a distinctive deceleration\u2014Zimmer (2002) even found response habituation as well as response recovery. However, considering the empirical contradictions, a clear link between the OR and HR deceleration is highly questionable. Possible HR modulations, which could result from various processing operations in different phases of processing, also impede the assumption of a simple relation (see below).\nResting upon the observation that recovery of the cardiac response is occasionally (a) a rapidly developing, (b) very pronounced and (c) relatively long-lasting slowing of the\n1 3\nheartbeat frequency (cf. Bohlin et\u00a0al., 1981; Vossel & Zimmer, 1989a, 1992; Zimmer, 2002), it may be concluded that it consists of two or three phases of HR deceleration with different starting times: (i) a brief, rapid-onset deceleration or primary bradycardia (Lacey & Lacey, 1980) representing stimulus registration (Graham, 1992), (ii) a second deceleration reflecting involuntary orienting (e.g., Graham & Clifton, 1966; Turpin, 1983), and possibly (iii) a third deceleration reflecting voluntary orienting activity associated with supervisory attentional control of processes involved in anticipation and preparation (Bohlin & Kjellberg, 1979; Damen & Brunia, 1987; Lacey & Lacey, 1978).\nReferring to a more recent concept of preparation, findings suggest that preparation is a set of processes (Jennings & Van der Molen, 2005) and that transient heartbeat slowing is indicative of inhibitory processes necessary for an appropriate task-based preparation (Jennings & Van der Molen, 2002). A task-based HR deceleration may thus be a useful psychophysiological window into the operating principle of the supervisory attentional system (Jennings & Van der Molen, 2002, pp. 337\u2013340).\nIn the transitional phase (involuntary orienting) between stimulus registration and voluntary orienting, various processes are likely to be triggered by novel stimuli. These may either (a) support slowing of the heartbeat frequency. Or, (b) depending on stimulus features (especially rise time and intensity; cf., e.g., Cook & Turpin, 1997), signal value (e.g., \u00d6hman et\u00a0al., 2000; Walter & Porges, 1976) and, most importantly, the central processing requirements associated with the particular signal value (Graham, 1992; Jennings, 1986; Lacey, 1967; Simons et\u00a0al., 1998), they might drive the heart rate up even above baseline, so that the cardiac response finally has a three-phase structure.\nIn the case of a novel event without any task or goal relevance and of moderate intensity and rise time, one of these processes, an automatic and consequently passive call for processing (\u00d6hman et\u00a0al., 2000), is assumed to trigger the slowing of the heartbeat frequency. This deceleration of the HR is presumably a pure novelty-dependent deceleration because novelty detection, the theoretical CNS core component of involuntary orienting (e.g., Graham & Hackley, 1991; \u00d6hman et\u00a0al., 2000), is the presumed cause of this call. Duration of this \u201cnovelty deceleration\u201d is assumed to be longer than the primary bradycardia and shorter than a chronologically third deceleration, which we associate with voluntary orienting. Just like the latter, a novelty deceleration is directly connected with reduced somatic activity and improvement of perception (cf. \u00d6hman et\u00a0al., 2000, pp. 552\u2013556)."

            "text": "(A) In light of the above considerations regarding the component structure of the cardiac response and its susceptibility to various CNS processes, we hypothesize (I) that the reaction of the heart to our task-irrelevant and definitely unknown stimulus is a very pronounced, rapidly developing and relatively long-running HR deceleration, as conditions causing accelerative tendencies were non-existent, whereas at least two CNS causes of deceleration were given\u2014(1) stimulus registration and, most importantly, (2) the call for processing.\nIn contrast to this clear-cut deceleration, we expect (II) the general cardiac response to our familiar stimuli to have a three-phase structure, consisting of a transient and purely stimulus-driven deceleration, followed by an acceleration and another deceleration. Regarding (a) the task-relevant familiar stimuli (targets), we assume that the acceleration and the ensuing deceleration are due to the particular signal value of the stimuli and thus to their demands on central processing (effortful memory processes and decision making) and active attentional processes (concerning perception and anticipation). In terms of (b) the remaining familiar stimuli (non-targets), the same (three-phase) response structure is expected to occur but to a lesser extent\u2014due to lower demands on the central processing and the active attentional processes. The reason for these lower demands is that further effortful processing and supervisory attentional control are no longer necessary once a stimulus has been identified as a non-target.\nHowever, if the cardiac response to the stimuli of our repetition-change paradigm were (merely) a pure indicator of novelty processing, it would have to be a strong and clear-cut novelty-dependent HR deceleration, behaving like an exemplary indicator of involuntary orienting.\n(B) The skin is expected to respond to the novel change as well as to the preceding familiar stimuli in almost the same manner\u2014an increase in conductance. This increase in skin conductance, the SCR, is expected to reflect contextual novelty (in the present case, particularly the OR to the first stimulus), actual novelty (in the present case, the recovery of the OR to the novel change), as well as the CNS process of habituation (as a result of conceptual repetition).\nSpecifically, conceptual repetition is expected to decrease the SCR and novelty as well as signal value (voluntary orienting) are expected to increase the SCR. In addition, response habituation, i.e., the decrease in the SCR with repeated conceptual stimulation, is expected to follow an exponential course.\nNo sound hypothesis can be formulated about the interactive effect of signal value and repetition on the amplitude of the SCR as well as on the component structure of the HR response, in particular because it is not clear whether voluntary orienting, as implemented in the present study, habituates.\n1 3"

They were asked to relax without using common relaxation techniques and, apart from that, to follow their task instruction (cf. \u201cInstruction and experimental manipulations\u201d). Furthermore, the participants were requested not to anticipate stimuli during the physiological data recording.\nAll stimuli were digitised, equalised regarding onset latency, and played back by a commercial PC sound card. They were presented over loudspeakers, in a sequence\nconsisting of seven stimuli, six numerals followed by a unique sound (the digit 10 presented backwards). To avoid most refractory-like effects, all stimuli were presented at long intervals (of constant 16\u00a0s). Intensity of these speech stimuli was approximately comparable and near 60\u00a0dB SPL (re: 0.0002 dynes/cm2) at the headrest of the participant\u2019s chair. Due to balancing, 72 different numerical series were utilised in the study. They represent the conceptual repetition and were suitable for measuring response habituation (cf. Zimmer, 2002). In conjunction with a different task instruction (cf. \u201cInstruction and experimental manipulations\u201d), each of these series, but only one at a time, was presented to two participants. The 72 numerical series had one feature in common: they all consisted of the acoustically presented digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The unique sound was in each case presented finally, viz. in the seventh trial (a test trial). It was used for measuring response recovery, which is an essential test of whether measured response habituation across the digit presentations (repetition trials) clearly indicates CNS habituation. The digits were not presented randomly across the repetition trials but in groups of three stimuli each. The digits 1, 2, 3 on the one hand, and the digits 4, 5, 6 on the other, belonged to different presentation groups\u2014with a balanced order being realised both within and between these groups (see Fig.\u00a01).\nTo make sure that the participants voluntarily focused attention on nothing but one of these presentation groups at a time, they were given the task of paying close attention to the respective numerals and neglecting the others.\n1 3"

The HR response was split into separate intervals (dependent variables) to get these specific values.\nAs the SCR is a unidirectional response, its strength was measured in a conventional manner as amplitude. Thus, the difference between the minimum (occurring in a latency window of 1 to 3\u00a0s subsequent to stimulus onset) and the maximum of the SC increment (in the post-stimulus time frame of 1 to 9\u00a0s) was calculated. If no SCR occurred in response to a stimulus, an amplitude value of zero entered the subsequent statistical analyses. This was possible without serious consequences because none of the participants was a SC non-responder, i.e., none of them reacted to the first three or to all six numerals with less than one SCR.\nAccording to the presumable component structure of the HR response, various predetermined time segments were considered for the determination of components. Measuring values of change (HR in \u0394bpm) were calculated for these\n1 3\nsegments because the response was defined as HR change (after stimulus onset) in relation to a baseline (HR in the last second prior to stimulus onset). The following measured values were collected: the mean value for the seconds 1\u20132 (HR1-2: as an indication of a first component, the primary bradycardia), 3\u20134 (HR3-4: as an indication of a second component which might reflect, for instance, an automatic call for processing, central processing like memory search, and resource competition between central and perceptual processing demands), and 5\u20138 (HR5-8: as an indication of a third component which might reflect particularly anticipatory orienting activity); as well as the HR difference of the seconds 7\u20138 minus 3\u20134 (HRd). The latter variable has been considered because it may be assumed to reflect pretty well the compound effects of our manipulation of signal value in one key variable. In addition, the HR response was measured as an average value across the seconds 1\u20134 after stimulus onset (HR1\u20134). This is a traditional time slot for measuring a novelty-dependent HR slowing (Zimmer, 2002), which we call \u201cnovelty deceleration\u201d."

That is to say, SCR amplitude reflected\u2014 as expected for a valid indicator of involuntary orienting\u2014 actual as well as contextual novelty. Moreover, it declined almost exponentially in response to a conceptual repetition\u2014consisting of six spoken numerals which were, at least in the beginning, contextually novel stimuli. Typical for the CNS process of habituation, the decline turned out to be selective, because it was followed by a recovered SCR to a changed stimulation. In the present case, the occurrence of a unique and actually novel sound brought about this change.\nAlthough the SCR is known for its susceptibility to stimulus significance (e.g., Bernstein, 1969, 1979; Dawson et\u00a0al., 1989; Pendery & Maltzman, 1977) or voluntary orienting (Maltzman, 1979, 1990) its amplitude stayed unresponsive to our experimental manipulation of signal value\u2014implemented by a task instruction that prompted participants to give attention actively and voluntarily to some of the numerals (targets) as well as their immediate consequences and to disregard passively the others (non-targets). In regards to the SCR, the realised two-step manipulation of signal value was consequently either too weak or in other respects ineffective. Becker and Shapiro (1980) likewise concluded from a similar SCR result, \u201cthat either simply attending to a stimulus does not make that stimulus significant to any large degree or that stimulus significance only affects the OR in a limited range of conditions\u201d (p. 389). Be that as it may, key factors of voluntary orienting, notably effort (Kahneman, 1973; Verbaten, 1983), personal relevance (Zimmer, 2000) or, more widely, motivational activation (Bradley, 2009), are known for their considerable impact on the SCR but were deliberately not manipulated to any great extent by our instruction."

            "text": "Unlike the SCR, the HR response clearly reflected both involuntary and voluntary orienting, although, as expected, not in a similar manner.\nIn response to the task-irrelevant and indeed novel stimulus, a pronounced and long-running HR deceleration appeared\u2014as expected in hypothesis A\u2013I. This deceleration is quite typical for an HR response to a unique and unconditioned change stimulus in a repetition-change paradigm (cf. Bohlin et\u00a0al., 1981; Vossel & Zimmer, 1989a, 1992; Zimmer, 2002). It may thus be regarded in line with the tenor of prior publications on the OR (cf., e.g., Turpin, 1983) as tentative evidence of involuntary orienting.\nHowever, it is important to note that this putative \u201cnovelty deceleration\u201d does not prove a true recovery of a previous and, as a result of habituation, declined novelty-dependent HR deceleration. In fact, the mean HR response on the preceding conceptual repetition trials (cf. Fig.\u00a02), as well as the HR response to contextual novelty (cf. Fig.\u00a03), was definitely not a uniform deceleration, but rather a polyphase response resembling the HR change in the foreperiod of signalled reaction time paradigms (Bohlin & Kjellberg, 1979). The response consisted of three constituent parts: a transitory and non-habituating deceleration, most likely and solely representing the stimulus-driven primary bradycardia (cf. Graham, 1992; Lacey & Lacey, 1980), followed by rapid acceleration and an ensuing deceleration. According to Bohlin and Kjellberg (1979) evidence suggests that these are relatively independent HR response components at least in signalled reaction time paradigms.\nThus, the assumption that a novelty-dependent HR deceleration also occurs inevitably contingent on contextual novelty cannot be verified by the present data. Primarily, it cannot account for the fact that a heartbeat-accelerating response component was particularly strong in early trials, was not displaced by a noticeable HR deceleration in early non-target trials, and also showed evidence of response habituation.\nYet, this is not a totally surprising result or one that could challenge stringently the common hypothesis of an HR deceleration occurring along with involuntary orienting. It is not a surprising result because the polyphase response characteristic was expected as a result of voluntary orienting (see hypothesis A-II).\nAs a whole the results are in line with the expectation that the HR is not only responding to involuntary or passive processes\u2014as reflected by the primary bradycardia and the novelty-dependent HR deceleration \u2013 but also to other factors such as task-oriented voluntary and thus active adjustments of attention. These factors might be in large part responsible for the second and the third component of the polyphase response and, in general, they may vary to a considerable degree depending on the specific processing requirements of the task at hand (cf. with the effect of signal value on the response variable HRd). Such factors may be as well determinants in case of events which have an unclear task-relevance to participants\u2014as in the standard version of the repetition-change paradigm.1\n1 Additional factors may be arousal, arousal inhibition, and an increasing inhibition of competing actions. For the relation of the OR, arousal and a brief, rapid-onset \u2013 onset latency < 2\u00a0s \u2013 HR acceleration peaking in post-stimulus second 3, see Graham and Hackley (1991). For the relation of arousal inhibition and HR deceleration see klein Selle et\u00a0al., (2016, 2017). For the relation between the late decelerative HR component and an increasing inhibition of competing actions during response selection see Jennings and Van der Molen (2002, 2005).\n1 3\nAnyway, mere listening to contextually novel but in other respects highly familiar stimuli probably cannot be held responsible for the polyphase response characteristic, especially since Zimmer (2002) found a clear HR deceleration to orienting stimuli which differed from the present ones only in task demands. In this previous HR study, the participants were only asked to listen to a train of verbal stimuli and to relax passively, whereas in the present study they were additionally requested to regard some of these verbal stimuli as signals for a definite task. By instruction, they were invited to find out whether these target stimuli were spoken by a female voice and also contaminated or followed by a noise. In short, this means that the participants had to compare each verbal stimulus with the targets\u2019 memory representation. In case of target detection, they moreover had to identify the speaker\u2019s gender and to search for a definite event, a noise superimposing or following the target.\nOn the assumption that an HR response is in the end a consequence of various processing operations, the manifestation of a specific HR component may, at the individual level, even result from the rivalry of opposing higher-level CNS processes which are involved in a temporary competition for limited perceptual-central resources (Wickens, 1980, 1984). For this reason, the HR acceleration found may be the result of task-based central processing requirements which temporarily dominate perceptual requirements. An acceleration is supposed to depend on, for example, demands upon controlled and elaborated memory processes (e.g., Jennings et\u00a0al., 1990; Simons et\u00a0al., 1998), whereas a deceleration is supposed to depend on, especially, demands upon sensory information reception (e.g., Graham & Hackley, 1991; Jennings et\u00a0al., 1990).\nBased on the differential outcomes depending on the experimental manipulation of signal value, the HR response can be supposed as more prone to voluntary influences than the SCR. This distinct susceptibility to voluntary orienting could be the main reason for the contradictory opinions on the question whether a measured HR response to novelty can be considered as a valid indicator of the involuntary OR (cf., e.g., Barry, 1986; Simons et\u00a0al., 1987, 1998; Turpin et\u00a0al., 1999; Vossel & Zimmer, 1989a).\nNonetheless, the present study showed that an HR deceleration is able to reflect the involuntary OR if but only if the orienting stimulus is a unique and highly novel change in stimulation. This (uniform) novelty-dependent deceleration has not currently been found in response to contextual novelty, although a novelty-based OR\u2014as indicated by the SCR\u2014occurred in response to both phenomena, actual and contextual novelty.\nAll in all, the present HR results are consistent with Sokolov\u2019s (1990) assumption that the \u201csignificance contribution to the OR is achieved via frontal lobe activation of voluntary attention\u201d (p. 99). Indeed, our task instruction\nregarding target stimuli was characterized by targeting voluntarily controlled intentions to attend some specific stimuli and their immediate consequences\u2014something that is typical of lifelike voluntary orienting. The HR results are also compatible with the findings of Simons et\u00a0al. (1998) that task-based higher mental functions, such as central processing and decision-making, induce HR acceleration. Different patterns of HR response might thus reflect functionally different control modes of selective information processing."

Regardless of the task at hand, the SCR reflected involuntary orienting, its habituation in consequence of conceptual repetition and its recovery as a result of a novel change in stimulation. Unlike skin conductance, the heart rate showed a non-uniform pattern of response and turned out to be susceptible to both involuntary and voluntary orienting. While the HR response to the last orienting stimulus, actual novelty, was a clear-cut deceleration, the HR response to the first orienting stimulus, contextual novelty, was neither a deceleration nor an acceleration alone but a polyphase response being sensitive to conceptual repetition and the requirements of a voluntary orienting. Thus, even if a slowing of the heart rate, were under some circumstances a reliable accompanying phenomenon of an involuntary OR, it would still be an invalid or at least restricted indicator of this OR because of its striking susceptibility to voluntary orienting.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL."
