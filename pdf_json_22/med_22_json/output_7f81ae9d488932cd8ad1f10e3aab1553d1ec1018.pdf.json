    "abstractText": "Introduction: Persistent low back pain (PLBP) is the biggest global cause of disability. Persons with PLBP experience biographic disruption and existential crisis. Guidelines recommend a biopsychosocial approach to management, with the emphasis on coping strategies. Purpose: However, there is a paucity of research exploring the lived experience of persons who self-identify as coping with PLBP. Method: The study used an interpretive phenomenological approach, analysing transcripts from 1:1 interviews with six persons who self-identify as coping with PLBP. Poetic language was used to elicit empathic, embodied relational understanding and convey a richer understanding of the phenomenon that authentic quotations might not able to reveal. Findings and Conclusion: Participants\u2019 descriptions conveyed the sense of a journey, starting with the loss of a sense of self as they engaged in the pain battle, followed by a transition towards a new \u2018normal\u2019, in which time, acceptance and trust in their own intuition were meaningful components. Although anxiety and fear were a continued presence, but they became more manageable. Society\u2019s role in the coping process was significantly meaningful and is something which requires reflections from therapists\u2019 and more widely.",

Persons with PLBP experience biographic disruption and existential crisis. Guidelines recommend a biopsychosocial approach to management, with the emphasis on coping strategies. Purpose: However, there is a paucity of research exploring the lived experience of persons who self-identify as coping with PLBP. Method: The study used an interpretive phenomenological approach, analysing transcripts from 1:1 interviews with six persons who self-identify as coping with PLBP. Poetic language was used to elicit empathic, embodied relational understanding and convey a richer understanding of the phenomenon that authentic quotations might not able to reveal. Findings and Conclusion: Participants\u2019 descriptions conveyed the sense of a journey, starting with the loss of a sense of self as they engaged in the pain battle, followed by a transition towards a new \u2018normal\u2019, in which time, acceptance and trust in their own intuition were meaningful components. Although anxiety and fear were a continued presence, but they became more manageable. Society\u2019s role in the coping process was significantly meaningful and is something which requires reflections from therapists\u2019 and more widely.\nKeywords: coping; low back pain; poetry; phenomenology\nINTRODUCTION\nGlobally, low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disabilities (Wu et al, 2020). It has been estimated that 84% of the population will develop LBP at some point in their lives and around 20% will become persistent sufferers (Balagu\u00e9, Mannion, Pellis\u00e9, Cedraschi 2012; Meucci, Fassa, Faria, 2015). The majority of LBP is termed \u201cnon-specific low back pain\u201d as no distinct or reliable pathology can be identified (Balagu\u00e9, Mannion, Pellis\u00e9, Cedraschi, 2012; Deyo and Weinstein, 2001). This lack of a clear medical diagnosis can create uncertainty, with those experiencing pain finding it difficult to understand why their symptoms are ongoing (Toye et al, 2013). Persons with PLBP are likely to continue to search for a medical cause not only in the hope of finding effective treatment or a cure (van Griensven, 2015), but also to legitimise their pain to others (MacNeela et al, 2015; Toye et al, 2013; van Griensven, 2015). In addition to the pain, uncertainty and disbelief were reported to have a negative impact on the individuals\u2019 wellbeing (Bailly et al, 2015; Bunzli et al, 2013; MacNeela et al, 2015). Persons with PLBP have described withdrawal from family and social events (MacNeela et al, 2015; Smith and Osborn, 2007; Snelgrove, Edwards, Liossi, 2013), changes in personality and a loss of empathy for others (Smith and Osborn, 2007; van Griensven, 2015). Findings from qualitative research reveal a sense of existential crisis, whereby persons with PLBP felt they were unable to be themselves anymore. Their testimonies convey the loss of a sense of self, low mood, anxiety and depression (Snelgrove, Edwards, Liossi, 2013). PLBP can last for many years and, for some, a lifetime and thus developing better understanding of the experience of PLBP and how persons learn to live with and manage their symptoms is crucial\nin optimizing care.\nContemporary management of persons suffering from PLBP uses a\nbiopsychosocial approach. This is reflected in most international guidelines (Meroni et al, 2021) which emphasise self-management strategies, including a combination of physical and psychological treatment programmes tailored to the individual needs of the person in care. Although therapists recognise the need to include self-management strategies into their treatment plans, there are challenges to them operationalizing this in practice (Hutting, Oswald, Staal, Heerkens, 2020).\nThe aim of the self - management approach is to help the person to live\nwith the condition if pain persists and there is evidence that some persons with PLBP learn to successfully self-manage their pain and are able to live well with the condition (Bunzli et al, 2013; MacNeela et al, 2015; Toye and Barker, 2012). In the literature, qualitative studies have explored the experience of persons living well with chronic pain (Lennox Thompson, Gage, Kirk, 2020; Owens et al, 2016) or chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain (de Vries et al, 2011). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, however, no previous study has explored the lived experience of persons self-identifying as coping with PLBP. Gaining a better understanding from those who have found a way of living with PLBP, pursues Antonovsky\u2019s salutogenesis theory, promoting the origin of health, rather the traditional pathogenic focus in health care, aiming to challenge the origin of disease and its associated risk factors (Mittelmark and Bauer, 2022). In addition, gaining a better understanding may enable therapists to cultivate more authentic and empathetic feelings and so may become better partners with\npersons receiving their care. Clinicians\u2019 empathy is valued by care seekers (Dima et al, 2013; Singh et al, 2018) and provokes a feeling of being understood, creating a safe space in which to speak freely about learning how to flourish whilst living with symptoms. Therefore this study aimed to explore the lived experience of learning to cope with PLBP.\nMETHODS\nStudy design\nThis study used an interpretive (hermeneutic) phenomenological framework drawing on Heidegger\u2019s interpretive phenomenological approach and Dahlberg, Dahlberg, and Nystr\u00f6m (2008) reflective lifeworld research. For Heidegger, human beings are always \u2018thrown\u2019 into the world, in a given context and culture, from which their realties cannot be separated (Converse, 2012; Finlay, 2009; Neubauer, Witkop, Varpio, 2019). Therefore, interpretive phenomenology goes beyond participants\u2019 descriptions, by interpreting their accounts through their lifeworld (Dahlberg, Dahlberg, Nystr\u00f6m, 2008, p. 73; Matua and Van Der Wal, 2015; Neubauer, Witkop, Varpio, 2019). As a result, the researcher is looking for hidden meaning by interpreting the experience using their own thoughts and experiences (Ashworth, 2016). This study also draws on van Manen\u2019s by using his work on evocative phenomenological writing and poetic expression (van Manen, 2014, pp. 261-267).\nRecruitment\nIn a phenomenological enquiry a small number of participants are recruited, as accounts need to have enough richness and experiential examples to allow a\ndeep understanding of the lived experience of each individual and enable crosscase theme analysis (Creswell and Poth, 2017, p. 161; Dahlberg, Dahlberg, Nystr\u00f6m, 2008, pp. 175-176; van Manen, 2014, pp. 352-353). Too many may lead to superficial analysis, hence, six participants were purposively recruited by responding to an advertisement on social media seeking participants who had experienced LBP for at least two years and identified themselves as coping with their symptoms. This number of participants is in line with other phenomenological enquiries (Blank, Finlay, Prior, 2016; Fitzpatrick and Finlay, 2008; Osborn and Smith, 2006).\nAll participants were based in the UK, over 18 years of age and had\nreceived multiple conservative interventions in the past. In addition, two had received injections and one person had undergone surgery. Further participant information is provided in Table 2.\n[TABLE 2]\nParticipants were offered a choice of either a face-to-face interview in a\nprivate room in a university library or virtually using Skype or telephone. Interviews took place between November 2019 and January 2020, prior to the global pandemic.\nEthics\nPotential participants who contacted the first author in response to a social media advertisement were sent an information sheet and provided written consent prior to the interviews. Ethical approval was gained from a university ethics and governance committee in the south east of England.\nData collection\nData was collected via semi-structured individual interviews. Prior to the interviews the first author, a musculoskeletal physiotherapist who has worked abroad and in the UK for several years and has personal experience of PLBP, sought to adopt a phenomenological attitude. This required her to look beyond the already-known, taken-for-granted \u201cnatural attitude\u201d. She aimed to bridle her preconceptions, assumptions and foreknowledge of the phenomenon in order to allow the phenomenon to show itself (Dahlberg, Dahlberg, Nystr\u00f6m, 2008, pp. 129-134) and become more aware of her preconceptions without completely suspending them, as it is practiced in descriptive phenomenology (Finlay, 2009; Neubauer, Witkop, Varpio, 2019). As the first author had personal experience of the phenomenon of interest, she wrote a fore-conception statement exploring her own past experience, thoughts and understanding of PLBP (Dahlberg, Dahlberg, Nystr\u00f6m, 2008, pp. 134-137; Kvale and Brinkmann, 2009, pp. 30-31). To maintain awareness of her influences on the data, the first author kept a reflexive journal throughout the research process, in which she questioned her interpretations and biases. Being aware of personal bias is important to enable openness and the true reduction of the phenomenon of interest (van Manen, 2014, p. 220), and can be a valuable guide to explore hidden meaning (Finlay, 2009).\nThe interviews were led by the first author. Two interviews were\nconducted face-to-face, three were completed via Skype and one over the telephone. All interviews started with a short introduction, as advised by Kvale and Brinkmann (2009, p. 128), followed by questions to gain contextual information. Next, participants were asked to describe, in as much detail as they\npossibly could, their life since the back pain started. A follow-up question was: \u201cCan you give me a specific example when you learned a way to cope?\u201d. Additionally, the first author used exploratory prompts to encourage the participant to elaborate on an interesting experience or expression related to the phenomenon of interest (Kvale and Brinkmann, 2009, p. 135). Notes were taken at the time about statements that the researcher wished to explore in depth at a later stage of the interview as well as gestures and non-verbal cues. Afterwards, a short reflection on the researcher\u2019s first impressions was captured. The duration of the interviews varied from 33min to 93min, concluding when it was felt that the participant had exhausted their experience. Each interview ended with an opportunity for the interviewee to add further information if they felt an important part of their experience had not been discussed.\nData analysis\nThe interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised by the first author and pseudonyms were assigned. Next phenomenological analysis was applied to each individual\u2019s account and later used to crossexamine the collective whole (Stenner, Mitchell, Palmer, 2016). A thorough reading and re-reading of the transcripts aided a deeper understanding of the data to be obtained and helped the author gain a sense of the whole. Afterwards, meaning units (parts of the text containing a meaning) were identified, ranging from a few words or short sentences to whole paragraphs. Using the researcher\u2019s field notes and reflexive journal, an annotated linguistic, descriptive and conceptual reflection of each meaning unit was compiled, and the researcher took time to dwell in the data and elucidate the hidden meaning.\nFollowing the reflections, a search for thematic meaning for each meaning unit was developed within each participant\u2019s account as shown in Table 1 in the supplemental material. The reflexive journal was used to help the researcher to reflect on whether the themes were actually present in the transcripts rather than having emerged purely from her own experience.\nAfter all the interviews were analysed, the first researcher went back to\nthe first interviews and re-evaluated the coherence between the themes of each meaning unit, comments, and the transcript within each account. This practice of \u201cdwelling\u201d (spending time with and re-examining the data), allowed new understandings and implicit meanings to emerge and helped the researcher to distance herself from the data to allow the phenomenon to show itself (Finlay, 2014).\nThe themes of the first account were printed out and grouped together.\nAfter this, themes from other accounts were cross-referenced with the alreadyexisting themes, and included when relevant or new themes were grouped (see Picture 1 in the supplemental material). These themes were later clustered into sub-themes that either stood in contrast to or echoed other thematic units (Picture 2 supplemental material).\nNext a creative approach to analysis was used to reach a deeper\nunderstanding of the phenomenon. Inspired by van Manen\u2019s \u201cPhenomenology of Practice\u201d (2014, pp. 249-267) anecdotes and poetic stanzas were crafted from participants\u2019 personal words. The latter was later used as poetic language can help to create a visually and rich sensory image in the reader\u2019s mind and thus to sensitize readers to the complexities of coping with PLBP, evoking\nempathetic, embodied relational understanding (Todres, 2008) that plain language in the form of quotations might not be able to reveal (van Manen, 2014, p. 261).\nThis processes involved to shorten sentences by taking out transition\nwords or words or parts of sentences or meaning unit that did not capture the meaning of the theme. Very rarely participants\u2019 words were exchanged for synonyms or the order of words were adjusted to allow the stanzas to better flow. The aim, however, was to stay faithful to the meaning, mood and effects of the original transcripts (see for reference supplemental material Table 2).\nVisualising sub-themes in form of maps and drawings facilitated\nimaginative variation and influenced the creation of the master-themes shown in Drawing 1. Heidegger encouraged the use of imaginative variation during analysis in order to clarify the phenomenon\u2019s structure and gaining stability of its presentation by imaginatively varying its components (Bevan, 2014). In this study, both authors visualized the sub-themes in maps and drawings, experimenting with ideas of visualizing the content of the sub-themes to gain a sense of the whole. Simultaneously, both authors discussed and explained the structural appearance of the current visional idea. This visualization was then altered or discarded during the conversations until the final visualization of the phenomenon emerged. During this process, the authors also used the hermeneutic circle by moving backwards and forwards between the single part (themes and sub-themes) and the whole data set, with the intention of capturing the nature of the phenomenon (Kvale and Brinkmann, 2009, p. 210).\nThe second author, an experienced qualitative and phenomenological\nresearcher, musculoskeletal physiotherapist and academic, familiarised herself with the transcripts. She then entered into dialogic discussions with the first author, offering alternative interpretations, and engaging in all stages of the outlined phenomenological analysis in great detail. The poetic stanzas were again discussed intensively and crafted by both authors. The analysis finally ended with the finished written enquiry as through writing, reading and adjusting the written words, more meaningful insight was gained (van Manen, 2014, p. 367).\nTrustworthiness\nThe audit trail and the supplementary material illustrates the transparency of the analysis. Additionally, the intense and open discussions between the first and second author, by challenging each other\u2019s interpretations and preunderstanding, enhance the credibility of the findings. Finally, the first author sought to maintain a critical reflective perspective throughout the data collection, analysis and writing process, while spending several months dwelling on the data, in an attempt to capture the lived experience of coping with PLBP. In line with the concept of information power in qualitative researcher, the authors ensured that participants provided rich and varied examples of concrete situations revealing new knowledge of the meaning of learning to cope with PLBP (Malterud, Siersma, Guassora, 2016). As interpretive phenomenology aims to evoke the unique and hidden meanings of an experience rather than its repetitive patterns, data saturation was not intended for this study (van Manen, 2014, p. 347). Likewise \u201cmember checking\u201d has not been completed, as interpretive phenomenology does not reflect or represent a participants\u2019\nexperience only as they understand it (Finlay, 2009). The researcher adopts the phenomenological attitude and uses their fore-understanding in a reflexive manner to identify hidden meaning of which the interviewee was not aware: participants cannot prove or disprove the analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2013, p. 285).\nFINDINGS\nThree master-themes represented the different stages on a journey\ntowards coping. This started with the loss of a sense of self, followed by the pain battle and travelling towards a new normal. The master-themes and their sub-themes are shown in Drawing 1.\n[Drawing 1]\nThe drawing starts with a rope, consisting of four cords tightly intertwined\nwith each other. These four cords represent the sub-themes of mood, relationships, society and personal background, which together form the sense of self. Participants\u2019 descriptions revealed that when pain (symbolised by the black fibres) remains over time, it infiltrates the sense of self as a whole and the tight interconnection between the cords starts to loosen and break apart. This leads to the loss of a sense of self, the first master-theme. Losing the sense of self was conveyed as being meaningfully interrelated with mood, previous established personal relationships, the person\u2019s own understanding of themselves as an individual and their interaction with the wider society and professional communities.\nParticipants\u2019 accounts conveyed the sense of chaos that characterised\nthe second master-theme, the pain battle, where personal beliefs about the cause of pain, the trial-and-error process of new management strategies and\nthe loss of previous successful strategies are in constant exchange. Participants\u2019 narrative revealed that over time (often years), as an acceptance of pain developed alongside a trust in personal intuition, a new structure slowly emerged, forming the last master-theme, a new normal.\nThe structure of the new normal is different in shape and appearance. In\nsome places, life appears darker as pain continues to be experienced: but it is now seen more as a continued presence than an infiltrator. Because of continued uncertainty caused by unpredictable and variable pain, the rope appears more fragile and less stable than before, with single fibres appearing to separate now and again symbolising the peaks of variable pain. This also illustrates the fear of once again losing the sense of self. However, some participants revealed positive experiences which are represented in the appearance of some brighter cords. The three themes, representing stages on the journey towards coping, were conveyed as merging, whereby there was uncertainty where one stage ended and the next began.\nNext, each master-theme is explored in more detail. To illuminate the\nmeaning of the experience, poetic stanzas were created from participants\u2019 descriptions. The poetic stanza can be found in their entirety in the supplemental material Table 3.\nThe loss of a sense of self All participants conveyed the vast impact of pain on their life, affecting all four cords leading to a loss of their sense of self. A change in mood, characterised by expressions of anxiety and fear, was present in all participants\u2019 accounts. Most\nparticipants also described the experience of social withdrawal, with their pain affecting their relationships with other persons."

When it keeps me awake at night I\u2019m tired during the day, that brings my mood down, quite frightening, quite low.\n(Caroline)\nI became isolated, withdrawn. Pain just destroyed my life took over my life. The anxiety was running parallel with the pain. Life was pretty shit for a long time.\n(Frank)\nThe experienced significance of society\u2019s influence was illuminated in participants\u2019 descriptions which conveyed the sense of participants being othered due to their persistent pain. Participants\u2019 perceptions of society\u2019s beliefs where meaningfully related to their mood and self-esteem.\nI know people who are embarrassed when I am using a stick. One actually said: \u201cyou are too young to be using a stick!\u201d\n(Abigail)\nEvelyn expressed her perception that others think they understand because of their own back pain experience. However, in her experience they are unable to truly understand \u201chow complex it really is\u201d or her struggle because their back pain has resolved. This appeared meaningful in relation to her mood.\nPeople who tell me a lot about their pain tend to have a little twinge, for one day in bed and it\u2019s gone forever!\nBut it\u2019s a completely different thing if it doesn\u2019t affect your whole life! That\u2019s the mental side of it, getting my head around people\u2019s reactions.\nPeople think if something is wrong, you have treatment, physio, great, you are better! But it\u2019s actually quite complicated, I can\u2019t expect everybody to understand.\n(Evelyn)\nDanielle, a physiotherapist, conveyed a sense of disapproval and a perceived lack of acknowledgment from her colleagues. This also seemed meaningful to other participants who described a lack of acknowledgment from healthcare professionals and, like Abigail, from persons within their own communities, which appeared to lead to social withdrawal. Conversely, receiving acknowledgement had a positive impact as illuminated by Danielle.\nAt work it wasn\u2019t appreciated, there was a sense of disapproval. I think, people thought I should be better, I think, people thought I was attention seeking, I think, no colleague was ready for the time it took apart from the one, who was understanding, validated my experience, that\u2019s why I was so grateful.\n(Danielle)\nI withdrew socially because people didn\u2019t acknowledge me, but others have also withdrawn from me as I wasn\u2019t dynamic enough.\n(Abigail)\nThrough the pain experience it appeared that some participants\u2019 sense of self began to collapse. Evelyn stated, when she talked about having to prioritise\ndifferently from others her age \u201c[That\u2019s] not something you expect doing, particularly when otherwise I feel quite fit and healthy\u201d. The unexpectedness also resonated with Danielle\u2019s experience. She described how pain led to a substantial change in her life and a loss of her sense of self. As a physiotherapist, she exemplifies the fact this can happen to anyone, regardless of personal background, education or knowledge.\nI\u2019ve always been very fit, very able, it was a blow to my sense of self. My body let me down hugely. That whole sense of disability hit me very, very hard, I was not ready for it.\nWhen I was still unwell I catastrophised, thought I\u2019d need surgery. In pain you are lost, no matter who you are!\n(Danielle)\nThe pain battle\nThe hunt for coping strategies was often described as a process of trial and error, which was strongly connected to the individual\u2019s beliefs about the causes of pain. As a result of failed interventions or a loss of previous successful strategies some experienced further disappointment. For others, new beliefs and strategies appeared to evolve leading to a different understanding of the cause of pain and a change from purely biomedical, perceived body-centred to additional emotional coping strategies. For Frank it almost seemed that failed biomedical - oriented interventions guided him towards a biopsychosocial understanding of pain.\nThe pharmaceutical route didn\u2019t work, the surgical route didn\u2019t work, so what else was I left with? I had to buy into this.\n(Frank)\nManagement strategies related to physical activity were dominant in all accounts. However, activities varied quite significantly. Walking, swimming, dancing, core stability and general exercises were only a few examples mentioned by participants. However, there was variation in how these were experienced, for example, while some found relief through core exercises, others found them \u201cdreadfully dull\u201d or not helpful at all.\nPilates had a beneficial effect, quite quickly my core felt stronger and my back felt better supported.\n(Caroline)\nI never do that anymore. I had the perfect set of abs but the most chronic back pain ever.\nAs taught by certain physios, I built and built a solid core to protect the spine which sends the wrong signals to the brain.\nRubbish!\n(Frank)\nFrank\u2019s description implied that it was not the core stability exercises as such, but the associated message given by healthcare professionals to protect the spine to avoid \u201cmicro-movement\u201d, that led to fear-avoidance behaviour.\nParticipants\u2019 accounts illuminated the value of their evolving understanding of the entwinement between mind and body and the influence of this on their wellbeing. Danielle expressed the meaning of her personal struggle when the healing process took longer than she expected, and she reported of catastrophising. Yet, after a reassuring conversation with one of her colleagues she felt better immediately:\nI was beating myself up for not being better after six weeks. \u201cIt takes time\u201d my colleague said and immediately I felt better. These tiny things actually had a huge impact.\n(Danielle)\nThis evolving conception of pain was conveyed in the accounts by moving away from what they perceived as primarily \u201cphysically\u201d related coping strategies. For Frank, multidimensional pain education was pivotal to his changing understanding in which his evolving conception of mind and body connection was the starting point; thereafter he adopted other self-taught strategies such as meditation, sleep hygiene and nutrition.\nAnxiety fuels pain: the things I hear, I see, I smell and can be damp down by things that are safe, pleasurable, adding value to my life.\nOnce explain pain was given to me, everything else followed, like a domino effect.\n(Frank)\nMost participants described varied mindful strategies as meaningful in helping them to cope with persistent pain. Meditation helped Frank better manage his fear and anxiety, which he attributed to pain and previous traumatic events in his\nlife. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan now, and I never used to be, of mindfulness, meditation and breathing.\u201d Caroline, a psychotherapist, used work skills such as cognitive behavioural therapy , whereas, for Evelyn, breathing techniques from yoga helped her to control pain.\nYoga gives me time to stop, to breathe. I\u2019ve learned different types of breathing, which helps when I\u2019m in pain, particularly out in public.\n(Evelyn)\nThere were hurdles along participants\u2019 self-management journey, which were characterised by feelings of uncertainty. Some participants described the challenges experienced emotionally when previous successful strategies suddenly failed. They conveyed a sense of uncertainty in which concerns about the future rose up, which required them to consider different ways to manage this new situation.\nWhat\u2019s next? I am a bit worried, it was my go-to. That\u2019s the mental side, the coping side, stopping those thoughts.\nI\u2019m thinking of a career change, not having to sit all day.\nDon\u2019t know yet.\n(Evelyn)\nThis uncertainty resonated with Ben\u2019s story which appeared to hide a sense of a dissonance. He described having an \u201cendorphin rush\u201d when he is active which makes him feel good. But he also expressed fear of doing too much which might exacerbate the pain. This seemed to leave him with uncertainty about his current exercise regime.\nI do a few more things, pushing myself a bit more. When I run I feel high, when I play table tennis I feel high. I enjoy physical activity, the feeling of well-being, the power in my body.\nI\u2019m a bit more adventurous.\nBut pain is always in the back of my mind, I am traumatised by it. I am afraid of doing too much. After a run I had pain this week, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do another run, I also put the brakes on table tennis now, I just don\u2019t want to take that risk.\nI\u2019m scared\n(Ben)\nAccounts also conveyed the challenges to maintain social contacts and work requirements. Some participants expressed having to plan activities and appointments precisely throughout the day and week at the expense of being spontaneous. Evelyn expressed dissonance, on the one hand she recognised the danger of social isolation but expressed uncertainty as to whether the required planning effort prior to social engagements will be worth it in the end.\nCoping means planning everything, the whole week is planned around one evening without knowing if it\u2019s worth it, but otherwise I don\u2019t do anything.\nThat\u2019s the danger with any chronic condition, it takes over, it controls you if you are not careful.\n(Evelyn)\nIn addition to the logistical challenges of engaging in social situations, participants also conveyed the challenges of navigating the complexity of interacting with others who do not understand their experience. Participants\u2019 accounts illuminated the perceived importance of hiding symptoms in order to avoid social judgement. In Danielle\u2019s account, it also seemed that her understanding of her professional identity as a physiotherapist prompted her to hide her symptoms.\nCoping means hiding it! I pride myself on nobody knowing, nobody knows here about the disc lesion, the foot drop, that\u2019s my history.\nWhy I am hiding it? It\u2019s part of the professional identity, it\u2019s embarrassing having backache like our patients.\nI am distancing myself not to be seen as \u201cpatient-like\u201d, I don\u2019t want people to know me as disabled, as exaggerating.\n(Danielle)\nEvelyn articulated a strategy she uses to deal with the impact on her mood caused by others\u2019 comments. She uses different replies depending on how well she knows the other person.\nI could get upset by others\u2019 comments, so I respond differently to different people, I give them a short, medium or long response depending on how well they know me.\n(Evelyn)\nShe acknowledged that others do not consciously want to upset her and that they sympathise; they just do not or cannot understand her struggle. There is a sense by which if you have not experienced persistent pain yourself you cannot possibly understand. To cope in these situations she started to ask directly for help, to explicitly make them aware. However, as she pointed out, asking for help is difficult because it implies an acceptance that pain is not going away.\nNow I ask my friends to wait and I don\u2019t get upset about it anymore. My symptoms fluctuate so much they just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not a lack of sympathy.\nWhen you ask for help you\u2019re admitting, accepting, that it\u2019s here, that it\u2019s not going away.\n(Evelyn)\nA new normal Despite the difficulties of accepting the ongoing presence of pain, there was a sense of acceptance being pivotal in participants\u2019 journey to finding a new normal. This was meaningfully related to time to trial different strategies and, for some participants, to develop a more multidimensional understanding of pain. Time was also essential for some to return to meaningful activities and to develop a trust in their body and their intuition. Most participants described specific coping strategies that came to the fore as they tried different activities and started to trust their body and in their experience.\nIt was just experience, the swimming, the jacuzzi, no one recommended it, it just felt really good.\n(Ben)\nBen\u2019s experience resonated with Evelyn\u2019s description when she explained that \u201clistening to (my) body is the biggest thing that I\u2019ve learned.\u201d Others revealed similar experiences where no one recommended a particular exercise but they just \u201cgravitated\u201d towards it or knew their body and what they needed and trusted their intuition.\nI had to get the work done, lying on the floor, taking medication wasn\u2019t an option any more.\nThat\u2019s when I adapted: no one said \u201cthink about exercising\u201d I just gravitated towards it.\n(Caroline)\nI know how my body works, what I want from it. It was not being able to walk or cycle that sort of drove me to do more.\nI did a lot of core stability and found it dreadfully dull, my core was better, but I couldn\u2019t walk any further, the treatment was very narrow, back-focused.\nBut my back? It is what it is.\n(Danielle)\nDanielle expressed a sense of acceptance that the pain was there to stay: \u201cBut my back? It is what it is\u201d: Yet she wanted to return to meaningful activities, despite the pain. This resonated with Frank, who was able to return to football despite the pain.\nRather than fight pain the solution was almost acceptance. So, I got out more, doing things I used to do and love and it started to work.\n(Frank)\nEvelyn implied that the acceptance of pain was not easy and a gradual process. She needed time to try different treatments to realise that there is no fix and that she had to let go of that old normal in order to find and accept a new normal. In her opinion this was essential in order to move forwards and live again.\nAfter years and things I\u00b4ve tried, gradually I had to accept that this is not to be fixed, that I have to find a way to manage it the best I can.\nIt is hard, but unless you get to that point you can\u2019t move forwards and live a life with pain.\n(Evelyn)\n\u201cAccept letting go of that old normal, look at a new normal instead.\u201d Five years later I get what it means: it\u2019s not worse, it\u2019s just different, and it has gradually become normal for me.\nHowever, not all participants seemed to have moved \u201cforwards\u201d and gained a sense of acceptance even over longer periods of time. Despite having experienced pain for 35 years, Abigail appeared still to be caught somewhere between the loss of a sense of self and the pain battle.\nIt's negative really, some people accept, maybe I am just not accepting.\nI\u2019ve got pain and I hate it, I\u2019m angry and pissed off, I feel stupid and peeved not to have managed the pain better, I\u2019m ageing and I don\u2019t want to age and I\u2019ve socially withdrawn.\n(Abigail)\nDespite accepting and coping with the presence of pain, other accounts also illuminated ongoing struggles, mainly with the remaining anxiety caused by pain. This was meaningfully related to the unpredictable pain, uncertainty and fear of \u201cregressing into the old world\u201d. But for some participants, like Frank, this did not mean \u201cnot coping\u201d. Instead, as Danielle expressed, the fear and the panic was seen as part of the new me, a new normal. Coping meant gaining a sense of control over the panic which had become part of normality and therefore not unexpected any more.\nI\u2019m still in pain, I still struggle, I still have anxiety, but I still cope.\n(Frank)\nI try to manage the panics that I feel by seeing the pain slightly differently, it\u2019s like a part of me, I\u2019m trying to embrace it, like the new me.\n(Danielle)\nIn some accounts there was a sense that a wider learning has taken place out of this traumatic experience, not only involving their understanding of pain but also a self-understanding and a consideration of others. Ben reported that he is now more empathetic and Frank conveyed that he uses his experience to help not only others with PLBP but also healthcare professionals, which is valuable to him \u201cbecause I am giving something back\u201d. Danielle reached an understanding of\nincreased pain as \u201ca warning sign\u201d which prompted her to change her lifestyle and maintain a better work/life balance.\nI have a much better work/life balance, I use my bad back as a flag, it tells me when my life is not right, it hurts more when I\u2019m sitting too much and it makes me to cycle to work, like: \u201cYou want me to go away? Well DO something!\u201d\n(Danielle)\nDISCUSSION\nThe lived experience of persons who self-identify as \u201ccoping\u201d with PLBP was conveyed as a journey with three stages of meaning: the loss of a sense of self leading to the pain battle and onwards towards a new normal. However, these stages were not clearly defined, and a progression and regression between the stages was conveyed in participants\u2019 accounts. The journey elucidated how life changing PLBP can be, not only affecting participants\u2019 bodies but their entire lifeworld, which resonated with other studies exploring the experience of PLBP (Bunzli et al, 2013; MacNeela et al, 2015; Stensland and Sanders, 2018). Lifeworld is increasingly used in healthcare research and is divided into five different dimensions, which are strongly interrelated and inter-twined (Todres, Galvin, Dahlberg, 2007). The following discussion will reflect on how the different dimensions of lifeworld resonated with participants` journey towards coping. Mood, embodiment, inter-subjectivity and temporality dominated participants\u2019 accounts and are further illuminated below. Spatiality, which refers to the meaningful places and things in a person\u2019s environment (Todres, Galvin,\nDahlberg, 2007), emerged but was less pervasive in this study.\nMood\nThe meaningful relationship between PLBP and persons\u2019 mood was conveyed in all accounts and in all three stages. In lifeworld, mood is related to all dimensions, as lived experience brings emotions to the foreground (Todres, Galvin, Dahlberg, 2007). Anxiety, depression and low mood expressed in the first stage resonated with other literature exploring the experience of PLBP (Bailly et al, 2015; Corbett, Foster, Ong, 2007; MacNeela et al, 2015; Singh et al, 2018). In the current study, participants\u2019 accounts suggested that anxiety and fear of pain remained meaningful and an existential challenge even in the latter stage. However, some accounts of those who appeared to have moved towards a new normal, conveyed that they have found strategies to regain some control over their thoughts and feelings and embraced these emotions as a part of their new self. The strategies varied between participants and for some were linked to a development of a more multidimensional understanding of pain. The development in some participants\u2019 understanding reflects the paradigm shift that has occurred in western healthcare, whereby understanding has evolved from a biomedical to a biopsychosocial model and latterly towards a more holistic understanding (Daluiso-King and Hebron, 2020).\nThis new understanding of pain in some of the accounts conveyed a\nchange in \u201cbeing\u201d and participants\u2019 journey towards psychological flexibility and acceptance (McCracken and Morley, 2014). The concept of psychological flexibility aims not to reduce pain or negative emotions like fear but rather to cultivate a conscious awareness of these emotions so that they do not inhibit\nbehaviour or the movement towards valuable goals (McCracken and Morley, 2014). This was illuminated in Frank\u2019s account when he described returning to his beloved football despite ongoing anxiety and pain. Participants\u2019 stories conveyed how meaningful acceptance of pain was to \u201clive\u201d again. Conversely difficulties in finding acceptance were expressed by Abigail who reflected that the lack of acceptance might be the reason of her ongoing struggle. Her challenges with acceptance and the futility of struggling against the pain resonated with previous literature (Bunzli et al, 2013; MacNeela et al, 2015).\nEmbodiment\nIntertwined with the influence of pain on mood, participants\u2019 accounts illuminated how pain led to bodily changes, the feeling of \u2018disability\u2019 and the inability to engage with meaningful activities. Embodiment refers to \u201cthe lived body; one that is not best described by chemicals and neurones but by how we bodily live in meaningful ways in relation to the world and others\u201d (Todres, Galvin, Dahlberg, 2007, p. 57). Meaning that human beings can never free themselves from their body, never \u201cstand outside their subjective bodies\u201d (Dahlberg, Dahlberg, Nystr\u00f6m, 2008, p. 41). The body is the vehicle to access the world and through the subjective bodily experience the world becomes meaningful (Dahlberg, Dahlberg, Nystr\u00f6m, 2008, p. 41). The influence of pain on participants\u2019 subjective body may explain the reported loss in their sense of self which resonated with the literature exploring the experiences of other persons suffering with PLBP (Bunzli et al, 2013; Snelgrove, Edwards, Liossi, 2013; Stensland and Sanders, 2018; Toye and Barker, 2012).\nWhen life-changes such as the development of pain appear gradually,\nthey give the person time to adapt routines, behaviour and interactions with others. But when changes occur suddenly or are of a significant nature, adaptation becomes difficult or impossible (Engman, 2019), potentially leading to \u201cbiographic disruption\u201d (Bury, 1982). This resonated with Danielle\u2019s experience when she expressed how suddenly and unexpectedly pain entered her life, not giving her time to adapt and as such, her taken-for-granted lifeworld suddenly \u201cbecomes a burden of conscious and deliberate action\u201d (Bury, 1982, p. 176). This burden may drive the sufferer to mobilise resources (Bury, 1992) which echoed participants\u2019 stories. Their testimonies illuminated a sense of chaos, a battle with personal beliefs about the cause of pain, involving a trial and error of strategies. This resonated with Arthur Frank\u2019s concept of chaos narrative, an anxiety-provoking story with a plot where life never gets better and the life lived is not a \u201dproper\u201d life. He described chaos as a continued yet unsuccessful attempt of the sufferer to regain lost control (Frank, 1998). The concept of chaos also echoed that reported by Bullington et al. (2003), in which chaos was described as a blurred and confused stage wherein the sufferer attempts to regain control.\nTo regain control, all participants described perceived body-centred\nstrategies. These strategies, however, diverged within accounts as they were differently experienced in terms of their effectiveness. This echoed the literature which was unable to detect a superior physical coping strategy (Vanti et al, 2019; Wang et al, 2012). The development of coping strategies was described as a trial and error process of both, directed and self-directed strategies. Participants conveyed the importance of self-directed learning and the development of trust in their own personal experience and intuition. Modern\nhealthcare advocates to involve sufferers\u2019 opinions and experiences into the treatment decision. This led to a responsibility shift in the care-seeker/care-taker relationship towards the person seeking care, hence self-directed learning has become more important in recent decades (King, 2014). It was argued that the responsibility shift is down to the increased value of the care-seekers\u2019 testimony (Buchman, Ho, Goldberg, 2017). Others say it is a result of cut backs in healthcare, legal claims and political interests (King, 2014). This power and responsibility shift, however, is still unfamiliar for some (Taylor, 2009) and to process new information requires literacy and research skills, which some careseekers from poor educational backgrounds and learning difficulties might struggle with in a context of only limited external support (King, 2014). Moreover, as Danielle the physiotherapist explained, pain may interfere with the rational thought process, which makes absorbing new information more challenging \u201cno matter who you are\u201d. This challenge in processing new information in the presence of pain has been reported elsewhere (Corbett, Foster, Ong, 2007). In order to prepare society for the responsibility shift, healthcare providers will have to offer more appropriate educational support in the future (King, 2014) and health education in schools may need to be adjusted to meet the new demands in healthcare early on.\nA strong interconnectedness between embodiment and intersubjectivity\nwas seen in some accounts when the perceived body-centred strategies not only seemed to positively influence participants\u2019 bodily experience, but also led to a positive change in their mood and personal relationships, conveying the meaning of connecting with others through physical activities. However, despite the positive influence of perceived body-centred strategies on personal\nrelationships for some, a number of participants conveyed the need to develop specific coping strategies to restore their relationships with others.\nInter-subjectivity In the current study, participants conveyed a meaningful change in personal relationships leading some to become socially withdrawn and isolated at the beginning of their journey. As Abigail experienced: \u201cI withdrew socially (\u2026) but others have also withdrawn from me\u201d. Inter-subjectivity describes how human beings interact, live with, and relate themselves to others (Todres, Galvin, Dahlberg, 2007). These relationships are important as we use others to reference ourselves (Todres, Galvin, Dahlberg, 2007), which influences our sense of self (Ashworth, 2016). Previous qualitative research has illuminated persistent pain sufferers experience of being othered (Lennox Thomson 2019, pp. 17, 28-30) which correlates with some accounts presented here. In the literature, othering or being othered is described as a process that labels persons as different from what society deems to be \u201cmainstream\u201d and consequently excludes the other (Johnson et al, 2004).\nThe experience of being othered might explain why the third master-\ntheme, a new normal, emerged from participants\u2019 accounts. The definition of \u201cnormality\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d, is strongly related to what society defines as \u201cabnormal\u201d (Jovanoski and Rustemi, 2021). Finding a new normality was previously expressed and seen as important in order to live well with chronic conditions (Olano-Lizarraga, Wallstr\u00f6m, Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn, Wolf, 2022). In the current study the term \u201ca\u201d new normal was chosen as it implies fluidity, changeability, or fragility, in\ncontrast to \u201cthe\u201d new normal, which suggests a certainty and stability which does not correlate with the remaining uncertainty in participants\u2019 accounts.\nOthering is also strongly linked to stigmatization and labelling, and\nchronically ill persons often experiencing stigmatization and labeling as they diverge from societies\u2019 norm (Grinker, 2021). This can be caused by persons in the wider society and - even if unintentionally - due to the behaviour of healthcare clinicians\u2019 towards persistent pain sufferers (Lennox Thompson, 2019, pp. 28- 30). Qualitative studies have illuminated PLBP experience of stigmatization and labeling (Bunzli et al, 2013; MacNeela et al, 2015). This experience of doubt and a lack of acknowledgment of pain was also expressed in the current accounts and resonated with Elaine Scarry, who says: \u201cto have great pain is to have certainty; to hear that another person has pain is to have doubt.\u201d (Scarry, 1985, p. 7). In contrast, receiving others\u2019 acknowledgement of pain and symptoms was positively perceived by participants in this study. Similar findings were reported by Bailly et al. (2015) when PLBP sufferers reported positive experiences when family and friends provided assistance by showing understanding and being able to listen and to motivate.\nTo restore and cope with intersubjective changes different strategies were\nreported by some participants in this study. For Danielle, her perception that she was facing disapproval at work led her to hide her symptoms. Evelyn\u2019s account also seemed to reveal an element of \u201chiding\u201d information by proving only short or medium answers to some people in her community. Hiding pain or symptoms has been expressed by other chronically ill persons (Almegewly, Gould, Anstey, 2019; Neville-Jan, 2003). Evelyn also appeared to try to rationalise others\u2019\nbehaviour by reminding herself of the complexity of pain and therefore the inability for others to understand her situation. By doing so Evelyn seems to put herself in non-sufferers shoes. This method is described in the literature as \u201crole-taking\u201d and \u201cworld travelling\u201d and was suggested by Roberts and Schiavenato (2017) to be applied in nursing as a form of inclusionary othering. In this context, however, the authors suggested that the nurse or healthcare professional is taking on the role of the sufferer to develop an understanding and empathy for the person in pain and as a result prevent othering. These forms of inclusionary othering were initially described by Canales (2000). Lennox Thompson, a female academic and sufferer of fibromyalgia, discussed in her autoethnography another concept to prevent othering: the concept of \u201ccharity\u201d. This concept was first described by Brons (2015). He suggested seeing persons\u2019 actions and behaviour as reasonable even if at first it is not possible to discover the true underlying reason. This charitable interpretation on others\u2019 actions may invoke a reflection of one\u2019s own personal preconceptions and assumptions about the reasons leading others, like pain sufferers, to their actions (Brons, 2015). Lennox Thompson (2019, p. 29) suggests that this concept could be applied in healthcare but also in wider society to prevent othering. If healthcare professionals and the wider society are able to move towards a more inclusive practice of othering by \u201ctaking on the role of the other\u201d, \u201ctravelling to the world of the other\u201d or applying a \u201ccharitable interpretation\u201d on others behaviour, this may reduce the battle to retain the sense of self experienced by persons with persistent pain.\nTemporality\nThe meaning of time and its relationship with coping was illuminated in most\naccounts and throughout their journey towards coping. Participants\u2019 descriptions conveyed a strong temporal component, revealing that travelling through chaos, with its trial-and-error strategies in the attempt to restructure the different dimensions of their lifeworld and the process of acceptance and self-trust, required time. For some participants this took many years and there was a sense that this was experienced longer than actual clock time. Henri Bergson, a French philosopher has argued that humans are able to experience time in two different ways, chronological time and a subjective experience of time, how time is lived through. The latter is influenced by past memories, experience and feelings. If those experiences are of positive nature, the latter is likely experienced as longer (Moravec, 2020). Thus, Bergson\u2019s argumentation might explain why for participants the perception of time appeared prolonged during this difficult journey towards coping with PLBP.\nThe current literature suggests that healthcare professionals are\ngradually reconceptualizing the management of persons with PLBP towards one of supported and guided self-management, aiming to provide a better, more meaningful life for sufferers. Accounts here illuminated the ability for persons to find new meaning despite PLBP and the authors\u2019 hope is that this study will be able to further contribute to the vision of better care for those seeking help. As time appears to play an overriding role towards coping, healthcare providers and policy makers may need to question if the current operating framework is suitable to provide time-intense, person-centred, empathic healthcare. The current provided time frames in clinics suggest a remaining in a biomedical understanding of illness. This can leave both therapists and persons seeking care unfulfilled due to a lack of time to sit with the person in need and to support\nthem through the period of chaos and trial and error.\nClinical implication\nWe are embodied beings who live through our bodies and thus pain invades different dimensions of human life. In order to guide persons with PLBP on their journey to coping with PLBP therapists should allow space for them to tell their story, seek to understand their \u201clifeworld\u201d and legitimize their experience. Only those clinicians willing to become witness to the story and provide empathetic care can help others to escape the chaos. Persons whose chaos story is not legitimised can receive care but cannot be recipients of empathic care (Frank, 1995). It is the researchers\u2019 hope that the poetic excerpts encourage clinicians to pause, and empathically engage with these participants\u2019 accounts as well as those of persons receiving their care. To \u201csit with\u201d persistent pain sufferers takes time, often several years, as persons engage in a battle with own beliefs and learn to develop their own management strategies. Clinicians may recognise that in the trial-and-error approach towards learning to \u201ccope\u201d with PLBP, some persons may need to explore biomedical strategies before, in time, they are able to engage in a more multidimensional understanding of pain. Being able to sit with persons \u201csuffering\u201d as they navigate their journey towards coping, and hopefully with time, find a way through the chaos to a place of human flourishing whilst living with PLBP. Policy makers and healthcare providers may have to question how time is best allocated within and between appointments to provide best care. Offering greater time with less frequency and over a longer period of time may better align with persons\u2019 journey towards coping.\nWe also hope that participants\u2019 poems might be shared with other\npersons living with PLBP to create a feeling of belonging and to provide a context in which conversations about feelings, thoughts, emotions and experiences can be openly shared which can then help clinicians to understand the sufferers\u2019 lifeworld. These findings suggest that coping with changes to interpersonal relationships are important. With this in mind, clinicians may explore the influence of others on persons\u2019 experiences and, through discussion, consider whether significant others might be involved in the clinical encounter and management plan. The poems provided may also help nonsufferers to understand the lifeworld of a person with PLBP and encourage inclusionary behaviour.\nCONCLUSION\nThis study revealed the journey towards coping with PLBP through three master themes: the loss of a sense of self, the pain battle and the new normal. Acceptance, self-trust and the confidence to explore different strategies independently appeared to be important on the journey towards a new normal. This seemed dependent on the passage of time, with some participants taking years to learn to cope with their situation. Due to the subjective bodily experience of pain, coping strategies need to address a person\u2019s entire lifeworld. These findings illuminated the importance of empathetic, understanding clinicians who validated persons\u2019 individual stories. The significance of others in a person\u2019s journey towards coping suggests that there could be value in healthcare professionals helping them to explore the influence of their families and society on their experiences. Lastly, health professionals\nmight consider mechanisms for educating the wider healthy population about the complexity of pain to make it more socially understood and accepted.\nDeclaration of interest The authors report there are no competing interests to declare.\nREFERENCES Almegewly W, Gould D, Anstey S 2019 Hidden voices: an interpretative\nphenomenological analysis of the experience of surviving breast cancer in Saudi Arabia.

Annals of Translational Medicine 8: 299.\nDrawing 1: The journey towards coping: master-themes and sub-themes\nThe colored threads represent the sub-themes which together form the sense of self. Pain, symbolized by the black fibres infiltrates the sense of self, causing the loss of a sense of self, the first master-theme. This leads to the pain battle, the second master -theme where personal beliefs about the cause of pain, the trial-and-error process of new management strategies and the loss of previous successful strategies are in constant exchange. Over time, as an acceptance of pain develops alongside a trust in personal intuition, a new structure slowly emerges, forming the last master-theme, a new normal. The structure appears darker as pain continues to be experienced: but it is now seen more as a continued presence than an infiltrator. The rope appears more fragile and less stable than before because of the continued uncertainty caused by unpredictable and variable pain. However, some participants revealed positive experiences represented in the appearance of some brighter cords."
