    "abstractText": "The intricate dependency structure of biological \u201comics\u201d data, particularly those originating from longitudinal intervention studies with frequently sampled repeated measurements renders the analysis of such data challenging. The high-dimensionality, inter-relatedness of multiple outcomes, and heterogeneity in the studied systems all add to the difficulty in deriving meaningful information. In addition, the subtle differences in dynamics often deemed meaningful in nutritional intervention studies can be particularly challenging to quantify. In this work we demonstrate the use of quantitative longitudinal models within the repeated-measures ANOVA simultaneous component analysis+ (RM-ASCA+) framework to capture the dynamics in frequently sampled longitudinal data with multivariate outcomes. We illustrate the use of linear mixed models with polynomial and spline basis expansion of the time variable within RM-ASCA+ in order to quantify non-linear dynamics in a simulation study as well as in a metabolomics data set. We show that the proposed approach presents a convenient and interpretable way to systematically quantify and summarize multivariate outcomes in longitudinal studies while accounting for proper within subject dependency structures.",

            "text": "The study of biological systems has seen enormous progress in recent decades in part due to the technological advances in the high-throughput data generating processes. These data often contain a large number of highly correlated variables frequently exceeding the number of samples. Moreover, the data may originate in various multi-factorial experiments carried out in heterogeneous populations. In particular, longitudinal interventions with repeated measures of multiple variables over time are used to generate time-series data to elucidate the dynamics and mechanisms of a system [1, 2]. However, to derive information from such data and assess the intervention effects, analysis must take into account the experimental design, the highdimensionality, the heterogeneity in the population, and the correlatedness of the data both in terms of variables as well as time [3].\nIn the field of nutrition, experiments studying metabolic perturbations are commonplace.\nThe dynamics of the metabolome are increasingly recognised as a more sensitive marker of metabolic health compared to fasting measurement and are regularly employed as indicators of intervention effects as well as pre-clinical and clinical conditions [4\u20136]. Standardised meal challenges are used to generate frequently sampled time-series data of metabolite concentrations in order to capture the dynamic alterations in the post-meal state [7]. The shapes of the resulting plasma metabolite transients are often non-linear and vary considerably across the study population [8]. Furthermore, nutritional intervention studies typically suffer from small effect sizes and sample sizes in addition to the high variation in the responses due to the heterogeneity of the underlying population [9]. All of these properties render it difficult to extract comprehensive information from such data.\nCommonly used methodology to analyse longitudinal responses after meal challenges in\nnutritional interventions include univariate analysis, such as computing the area under the curve (AUC) or quantifying the change in time via linear mixed models (LMM) [10]. Multivariate analysis using ordinary differential equations (ODE) based models is also frequently employed [11]. While properties of the univariate analyses are well understood, they neglect the inter-relatedness of the outcomes and often require conservative false discovery rate (FDR) correction to report the univariate results. Moreover, many of the frequently used univariate techniques (e.g. AUC) disregard the dynamics of the outcome. Conversely, ODEs have been successfully used to describe the inter-relatedness of species as well as the dynamics in biological systems [12\u201314]. However, mechanistic models are often case-specific, and require prior knowledge or extensive and costly experiments to build and validate, therefore remain impractical to extend to high-dimensional scenarios. In addition, techniques within the functional data analysis (FDA) framework, such as functional PCA, have also been successfully applied in an exploratory fashion to analyse high-dimensional longitudinal data [15, 16].\nAnalytical approaches currently employed to this type of high-dimensional longitudinal\ndata from designed interventions include extensions of the analysis of variance-simultaneous\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 2 / 18\nFunding: This project has been made possible by the Enabling Technologies Hotels programme of ZonMW (nr. 435005017, grant recipient I.C.W.A. and A.K.S.) with contributions from FrieslandCampina (https://www.frieslandcampina. com/).

Recently, this framework was extended to include random effects in linear mixed model-PCA (LiMM-PCA) and repeated measures-ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+) [19, 20]. These approaches work by estimating models of each metabolite time-course (in RM-ASCA+) or the (PCA) reduced score time-courses (LiMM-PCA). However, both methodologies considered simple longitudinal models with time as a qualitative factor, failing to capture the temporal dependency between time points. While this may be appropriate for comparison of beforeafter intervention effects or simple dynamics with few repeated measurements in time, timeas-factor models are not suited for frequently sampled time-series where the quantification of the temporal shape is important. In addition, application of such methods usually stops at quantifying the heterogeneity at baseline and rarely considers the heterogeneity in the temporal dynamics.\nIn this work we extend the RM-ASCA+ framework by introducing longitudinal linear\nmixed models with quantitative time variables in order to quantify multivariate outcomes over time. In addition, we also broaden the scope of the framework by accounting for heterogeneity in the temporal dynamics. We demonstrate that non-linear temporal effects can be recovered from noisy frequently sampled multivariate longitudinal data originating from a heterogeneous population using a simulation study. Then, we illustrate our approach on frequently sampled metabolomics data from the MELC Study, a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial looking at the postprandial energy metabolism and lipemic response [21]."

Then, we describe the steps of analysis via RM-ASCA+ with such models to analyse frequently sampled multivariate longitudinal data. Finally, we specify the setup of two applications demonstrating the use of RM-ASCA+ using continuous time LMMs: a simulation study and analysis of a metabolomics data set.\nLongitudinal linear mixed model with continuous time\nSuppose that response variable y was measured at K (k = 1, . . ., K) time-points in I (i = 1, . . ., I) subjects in a cross-over design where each subject underwent H (h = 1, . . ., H) treatments. In addition, we assume that the data displays quadratic profiles in time. If we consider the case where the number of treatments H = 2, the number of measurements K = 11, and the measurements are taken uniformly at t = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for both treatments in all individuals then a linear mixed model of the data can be written in the form:\nyihk \u00bc \u00f0b0 \u00fe gi0\u00de \u00fe \u00f0b1 \u00fe gi1\u00de tk \u00fe \u00f0b2 \u00fe gi2\u00de t2k \u00fe \u00f0b3 \u00fe gi3\u00de tk gh \u00fe \u00f0b4 \u00fe gi4\u00de t 2 k gh \u00fe \ufffdihk \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u03b20\u22124 are the fixed effects coefficients, \u03b3i0\u22124 are random effects, tk represents the sample time of the kth measurement, g 2 {\u22121, 1} is the indicator variable for treatment using sum coding, tkgh and t2kgh are factor interactions between time and treatment and \ufffdihk is a residual term. For simplicity, the example here demonstrates the use of linear and quadratic polynomials (i.e. the sample time t and its square) to introduce the temporal dependency. However, more generally, the temporal dependency may be coded by other basis functions (see section Modelling curvilinear trends in time). Sum coding of a factor variable leads to the effects of the factor levels being expressed relative to the mean across all groups. For more detail about the choice of coding and their interpretation we refer to [20].

The fixed effects parameterize the mean of the response, while the random effects allow the response trajectories in time to covary between individuals. The random effects and the residual error are assumed to have certain distributions that are specified through covariance matrix structures [22]. We assume, that \u03b3i \ufffd N q\u00f00q;D\u00de with unstructured covariance matrix D, and \u03f5i \ufffd N HK\u00f00HK ;\u03a3i\u00de with \u03a3i \u00bc Is2\ufffd where I is the identity matrix and s2\n\ufffd is the residual variance.

The effect matrices of the random effects are obtained analogously. In general, the response matrix can be decomposed into effect matrices pertaining to each term in the model, however, similarly to MfT , effect matrices can contain multiple effects. Here, we consider the effect matrices:\nY \u00bc Mf0 \u00feM f T \u00feM f TG \u00feM r 0 \u00feMrT \u00feM r TG \u00fe E \u00f05\u00de\nwhere M0, MT, MTG are the effect matrices for baseline, time, and time-treatment interaction corresponding to the intercepts, the time terms, and the interaction terms, respectively as shown for MfT above. The superscripts f and r denote effect matrices containing fixed or random effects, respectively, and E contains the residuals. After centering, multivariate analysis of the effect matrix is then carried out via principal component analysis (PCA). For example, PCA of MfT is given by:\nMfT \u00bc T f TP 0 f T \u00f06\u00de\nwhere MfT is a IHK \u00d7 J effect matrix, T f T is a IHK \u00d7 AT score matrix, and P 0f T is a J \u00d7 AT loading matrix, AT being the number of principal components used in describing M f T , and 0 denotes the matrix transpose. The score and loading matrices are then visualized to elucidate the variation in the effect matrix. The dimensions of the effect matrix determine the dimensions of the score and loading matrices, thereby effecting the mode of visualization. In general, the rows of the effect matrix contain the observations to be compared visually in the form of scores following PCA. For example, the analysis in Eq 6 yields the IHK \u00d7 AT score matrix TfT , which allows the visualization of the multivariate population differences between treatments in time for every PC separately. For brevity, we refer to this mode of visualization as a \u2018score trajectory\u2019 plot. However, the effect matrix can also be reshaped prior to PCA to facilitate a different mode of visualization by reshaping the effect matrix so that the dimensions for time K and treatment H end up in the columns. For example, consider the effect matrix of the random effects of time, MrT . Reshaping M r T from IHK \u00d7 J to I \u00d7HKJ and analysing via PCA leads to a score matrix that allows the visualization of the multivariate differences between individuals using a conventional score plot. This mode of visualization is particularly useful in the case of effect matrices containing random effects. We will refer to these plots as \u2018individual\u2019 score plots due to their use in highlighting the similarities and differences between individuals.\nPrincipal component analysis is performed on the centered effect matrices via singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) using the base R function svd.

Plasma samples were taken K = 11 times, at the fasting state (t = 0), and 30, 60,\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 6 / 18\n90, 120, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 minutes after meal ingestion. The subset of data used here contains concentrations of very low density and low density lipoprotein (VLDL and LDL) subclasses (J = 36, cholesterol esters [CE], free cholesterol [FC], triglycerides [TG] and phospholipids [PL] in particle sizes XS to XXL) that were analysed using a nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolomics platform [25].\nPrior to the analysis, measurements below the detection limit were removed. Subsequently,\nthe measurements were divided by the standard deviation of the baseline measurements (t = 0) per metabolite. This scaling ensures that metabolites with relatively large variances at baseline do not disproportionately influence the RM-ASCA+ results [26]. We assume that there is no variation at baseline between the treatments. The data was then analysed using RM-ASCA + with continuous time LMMs as described above (Eqs 1\u20136). In this case, we used natural cubic splines with two degrees of freedom instead of polynomials in Eq 1. Natural cubic splines are piece-wise cubic polynomials with continuous first and second derivatives at the knots with linearity constraints imposed at the tails of the boundary knots [27]. Natural splines are generally better behaved and do not suffer from the non-locality of polynomials at the same degrees of freedom [28, 29].\nModelling curvilinear trends in time\nThere is a wide range of transformations that may be used to move beyond linearity besides the simple polynomials and splines demonstrated in this work. The choice of basis function depends on properties of the data, required amount of flexibility as well as considerations for numerical stability. A more detailed look at basis functions is out of scope for the current study, however, for a comprehensive overview of basis functions and splines we refer the reader to [27, 29, 30]. The natural cubic splines were implemented with B-spline basis using the ns function from the splines library (ver. 3.6.2). For more details about spline functions in R we refer to [31]."

The estimated score trajectories and loadings show good agreement with the ground truth in panels a and b indicating that the encoded multivariate effects in the synthetic data could be recovered with RM-ASCA+ using the continuous metabolite models. Both the shapes of the prominent patterns in time (score trajectories) as well as their association with the metabolites (loadings) were conserved. In addition, PC3 shows that no artifact (effect outside of the encoded ground truth) was found using RM-ASCA+. The visualization in Fig 2 is representative of applying RM-ASCA+ to experimental data. Here, however, due to the simulated nature of the data, the ground truth scores and loadings are also known. Therefore, a direct comparison of encoded and estimated scores and loadings is shown in S2 and S3 Figs, respectively. In addition, the use of trailing PCs (such as PC3 in Fig 2) to indicate model validity only holds in the case when the ground truth is known.\nThe RM-ASCA+ estimated effect matrices of the random effects for time (MrT), and time-treatment interaction (MrTG) in Eq 5 were visualized in an individual score plot spanning PC1 and PC2 to facilitate the comparison of the simulated subjects\u2019 responses in Fig 3. The score plots for the effect matrix of time (panel a) and time-treatment interaction (panel b) show that the subjects are randomly distributed around zero indicating agreement with the normal sampling distribution used for specifying the random effects. The origin is an\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221.g001\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 8 / 18\napproximation of the population average response profiles based on PC1 and PC2, therefore, the position of the subjects indicate how their responses differed compared to the population average. Additionally, the distance between the subjects is representative of how similarly they responded to each other. For example, given the score plot of time-treatment interaction (panel b), subjects 36 and 37 differ along their PC1 dimension indicating differential response in time to the two treatments. This was visually confirmed by looking at the synthetic responses in S4 Fig).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221.g002\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 9 / 18\nQuantifying post-meal lipoprotein dynamics\nWe applied RM-ASCA+ using continuous time LMMs on metabolomics data from the MELC Study. A subset of the post-meal lipoprotein responses used in the analysis including triglycerides (TG) in very low and low density lipoproteins (VLDL-LDL) after the test drinks is shown in Fig 4. The complete set of data used in the analysis is shown in S5 Fig.\nAfter estimating the metabolite models we decomposed the multivariate response matrix\ninto effect matrices according to the RM-ASCA+ framework as before in Eq 5. PCA analysis of the combined response matrix MfT \u00feM f TG summarizes the overall effect of the test drinks on the post-meal lipoprotein response in the population. Visualizing the results revealed a prominent slowly increasing pattern (PC1, 89.3\u201398.7% explained variance) that was primarily dominant in the VLDLs with decreasing prevalence going from XXL to S particle size. The XS\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221.g003\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221.g004\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 10 / 18\nVLDLs and the LDLs showed the inverse of the pattern denoted by the negative loadings. A faster responding component (PC2, 0.7\u20138.4% explained variance) was observed in L to S VLDLs and LDLs with the exception of TG in LDLs. The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals suggest that there is no significant difference in the rate and shape of the multivariate responses between treatments A and B. PC3 contained no significant variation and was therefore discarded for interpretation.\nThe effect matrices MfT , and M f TG can be examined in isolation to further elucidate the\nchange in time, and the change in time due to the difference between the test drinks (S6 Fig). The change in time represents the average of the change induced by the two test drinks (panel a) due to the sum coding of the treatment effect. In addition, the additive nature of the effect matrices allows for insight into the relative variability between the sub-models. The confidence intervals in the score trajectory and loading plots indicate large variability within the population in the time-treatment interaction effects compared to the average change in time. In addition, no significant differences in the temporal profiles due to the test drink composition were found based on the time-treatment interaction results (panel b, S6 Fig).\nThe corresponding random effects model estimate-based effect matrices MrT and M r TG were\nconsulted to elucidate the between-subject variability. First, PCA of the effect matrices in IHK \u00d7 J orientation was carried out to show the individual-specific temporal profiles in a score trajectory and loading plot (S7 Fig). In addition, PCA was applied to the reshaped effect matrices (I \u00d7 HKJ) leading to an individual score plot of the effect matrices to facilitate the comparison between individuals (Fig 6). The results summarise the heterogeneity in the post-meal dynamics of the population by showing how the individuals vary around their respective population level patterns (i.e. the results of the effect matrices composed of the fixed effects model estimates in Fig 5 and S6 Fig). In Fig 6, individuals close to the origin point responded similarly to the population level responses, while individuals further away showed diverging responses. The directions along the PC axes in Fig 6 correspond to the population level ones, e.g. individual 14 appearing to the left of the origin along the PC1 dimension relates to the participant\u2019s lack of slow increasing response compared to those observed in the population trajectories in S6 Fig, panel b. In particular, the time-treatment interaction results showed that individuals within the population responded in opposite ways to the test drinks. Individual 7 generally had higher responses to treatment A compared to treatment B, while individual 17 responded to the contrary. These results were confirmed by consulting the metabolite responses in the data (S8 Fig)."

            "text": "In this work, we extended the RM-ASCA+ framework towards frequently sampled multivariate time-series outcomes by introducing the use of LMMs with quantitative time as the underlying univariate temporal model. RM-ASCA+ is a highly flexible analytical framework for longitudinal multivariate data with multi-factorial experimental designs that yields easy-tointerpret and efficient representations of the study outcomes [20]. However, its applicability to studies where the shape of the longitudinal outcomes is of importance has been limited. We showed how RM-ASCA+ using LMMs with basis expansion of the numeric time variable may be used to capture the dynamics, including non-linearities, in the multivariate outcomes. Furthermore, we introduced and demonstrated the use of random effects in the models to allow the comparison of individual specific dynamics.\nWe illustrated the use and properties of RM-ASCA+ with quantitative time models by ana-\nlysing synthetic multivariate time-courses representative of a heterogeneous population. The number of outcomes, sample size, and effect sizes were simulated to mirror the structure of dietary intervention studies in the field of nutrition.

In reality, such effects will not be orthogonal and therefore more difficult to interpret. Linear combination of the four encoded temporal effects of linear and quadratic changes in time as well as their interaction with the treatments can produce many heterogeneous shapes as shown in the simulated metabolites (S1 Fig). Additionally, the synthetic responses were simulated from LMMs including random effects pertaining to the temporal effects to introduce inter-individual variability in the dynamics of the responses. Using RM-ASCA+ with quantitative time models we were able to quantify the encoded population effects showing the potential in applying the approach on frequently sampled noisy data containing non-linear trajectories in a heterogeneous population.\nHeterogeneity in the dynamics of the post-meal lipoprotein concentrations has been previ-\nously linked to functional differences in metabolism, while the postprandial lipoprotein profile was found to vary with factors such as gender and level of adiposity [32\u201334]. Frequently sampled postprandial Lipemic responses from the MELC Study have been previously analysed to quantify the post-meal dynamics after two test drinks in a population of healthy individuals [21]. However, the univariate analyses carried out in the original study did not account for the correlation across the metabolites even though they were measured in the same individual. A re-analysis of data from the MELC Study was carried out to demonstrate the novel RM-ASCA + with quantitative time models which accounts for the multivariate nature of the data. The RM-ASCA+ derived representations provide a convenient view into the main modes of postprandial lipoprotein dynamics using the score trajectory and loading plots including typical patterns primarily determined by particle size as well as differential dynamics of triglycerides. In addition, the multivariate response profiles of individuals can be easily compared via the effect matrices of the random effects as shown in Fig 6.\nA summary of the effect of the meal challenges on the lipoprotein responses in the MELC\nStudy can be derived by visualizing the score and loading estimates of the combined time and time-treatment interaction effect matrices from RM-ASCA+ (Fig 4). The plots present a concise and convenient way to interpret as well as compare the various lipoprotein responses and treatments. In addition, the effect decomposition step allowed the quantification of the variability in the responses by effect source, highlighting the high heterogeneity in the responses to the test drinks by fat source. Furthermore, the underlying metabolite models were able to quantify between-subject variability in the dynamics via employing random effects of the time and time-treatment interaction effects. Thus, the approach allows insight into the inter-relatedness of the various lipoproteins as well as their changes in time, while accounting for subject-to-subject variability in the dynamics of the responses.\nThe approach outlined here allows the quantification of temporal dynamics while accounting for the dependency structures in data including within and between individual variability. Therefore, it presents an improvement over univariate methods frequently used to analyse post-meal dynamics such as AUC or LMM. Moreover, our approach is more easily generalizable and scalable to other systems than ODE-based models of postprandial dynamics, which may take a long time to build and validate.\nThe use of quantitative time models within RM-ASCA+ poses many benefits compared\nto the time-as-factor models demonstrated in [20]. Such approaches making use of polynomials or splines are frequently employed in univariate analysis to capture non-linearities in data. In particular, the use of explicit time models through various basis expansions of the numeric time variables allow the quantification of the dependency between the repeated measurements over time, making it possible to capture specific temporal shapes [35].\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 13 / 18\nAdditionally, as the number of repeated measurements in time grows, estimation of the time-as-factor models becomes less practical due to a large number of model parameters. Conversely, through the use of basis expansion methods such as polynomials and splines, quantitative time models present a flexible alternative with fewer parameters to estimate. Here, we demonstrated our approach using polynomial bases in a simulation study. However, it should be noted that the use of polynomial bases particularly ones with high order terms are generally not recommended due to ill-conditioning and their rigidity [28, 36]. These issues may be avoided by employing orthogonal polynomials or other basis expansions such as splines. Therefore, in the application to real data from the MELC Study, we used natural cubic splines. Quantification of the temporal dependency via continuous time models also supports the use of data with missing values. In addition, the sampling frequency, length of the sampled period, as well as the uniformity of the sampling scheme across subjects are also important in selecting the appropriate time model. A quantitative time model is flexible with regards to these properties and is generally favoured for data with irregular sampling strategies by subjects, as it requires no binning of the measurements or dropping them from the analysis.\nA key step in RM-ASCA+ is selecting the model that will represent the change in the variables over time. This temporal model must be appropriately specified to quantify the change in the univariate models. Similarly to any univariate analysis via LMMs, this includes ensuring that the model appropriately represents the experimental setup, that the model parameters are identifiable, as well as examining model diagnostics [37\u201339]. In this work, the univariate model structure was shared across the metabolites i.e. all metabolites were modeled using the same LMM specification. Diagnostic plots of the residuals in the metabolite models fitted to the MELC Study are shown in S1 Appendix. While quantitative time models are quite flexible, care must be taken to avoid misspecification of the univariate models. For example, assume that most metabolites are appropriately described using a quadratic time variable, except for a particular metabolite that shows a delayed response. In such a case, the quadratic model would be misspecified; instead, a piece-wise model capturing the delay is necessary. The use of a model selection step within RM-ASCA+ to specify the model structure in each metabolite prior to multivariate analysis may be feasible, however was out of scope for the current work. Moreover, as heterogeneity in the longitudinal outcomes is a key feature of biological systems, we advocate the use of random effects of the model terms underlying the dynamics. Nevertheless, care should be taken when adding coefficients to estimate so that the model complexity is supported by the experimental design and data [39]. In principle, an arbitrary number of metabolites may be included in the analysis presented in this work, however, note that estimating the LMMs may be costly. In such cases, performing PCA on the metabolite responses first, as done in LiMM-PCA, may be a more scalable option [19, 20].\nIn conclusion, analysis of multi-outcome longitudinal data originating from multi-factorial\nexperimental designs must take into account the within-subject dependency structures and account for the heterogeneity in the population. RM-ASCA+ is a novel analytical framework that takes into account the inter-relatedness of the multiple outcomes and population heterogeneity. Here, the framework is extended to quantify the dynamics in frequently sampled time-series data through the use of linear mixed models with numeric time predictors as the underlying univariate models of RM-ASCA+. Additionally, we showed how non-linearities in time, and heterogeneity in the dynamics -both frequently observed properties of biological systems- can be captured within RM-ASCA+ through the use of basis expansion, and random effects of the model terms describing the dynamics.\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011221 June 23, 2023 14 / 18"
