1. Investigate the potential mechanisms that account for the temporal relationships between the Trump sociopolitical era and adverse birth outcomes among Latina mothers. This could include examining changes in maternal diet and exercise, family income and social support, and quality of health care.


2. Examine temporal changes in birth and prenatal care outcomes among US-born Latina mothers across nationalities. This would help to understand how Trumpâ€™s attacks against immigrants from Latin American countries create negative health implications that extend beyond intended targets, affecting US-born co-ethnic groups.


3. Investigate the long-term health effects of adverse birth outcomes among Latina mothers during the Trump era. This could include examining the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, in children born during this time period.


4. Examine the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on birth outcomes among Latina mothers. This could include investigating whether the pandemic has exacerbated the negative effects of the Trump sociopolitical environment on birth outcomes, or whether it has led to improvements in birth outcomes due to increased access to prenatal care and other social support services.


5. Conduct qualitative studies to understand the experiences of Latina mothers during the Trump era. This could help to shed light on the mechanisms that link sociopolitical stress to adverse birth outcomes, and to identify potential interventions to mitigate these effects.
