    "abstractText": "Computational models are becoming an increasingly valuable tool in biomedical research. Their accuracy and effectiveness, however, rely on the identification of suitable parameters and on appropriate validation of the in-silico framework. Both these steps are highly dependent on the experimental model used as a reference to acquire the data. Selecting the most appropriate experimental framework thus becomes key, together with the analysis of the effect of combining results from different experimental models, a common practice often necessary due to limited data availability. In this work, the same in-silico model of ovarian cancer cell growth and metastasis, was calibrated with datasets acquired from traditional 2D monolayers, 3D cell culture models or a combination of the two. The comparison between the parameters sets obtained in the different conditions, together with the corresponding simulated behaviours, is presented. It provides a framework for the study of the effect of the different experimental models on the development of computational systems. This work also provides a set of general guidelines for the comparative testing and selection of experimental models and protocols to be used for parameter optimization in computational models.",

Marsh 3 & Caroline E. Ford 1*\nComputational models are becoming an increasingly valuable tool in biomedical research. Their accuracy and effectiveness, however, rely on the identification of suitable parameters and on appropriate validation of the in-silico framework. Both these steps are highly dependent on the experimental model used as a reference to acquire the data. Selecting the most appropriate experimental framework thus becomes key, together with the analysis of the effect of combining results from different experimental models, a common practice often necessary due to limited data availability. In this work, the same in-silico model of ovarian cancer cell growth and metastasis, was calibrated with datasets acquired from traditional 2D monolayers, 3D cell culture models or a combination of the two. The comparison between the parameters sets obtained in the different conditions, together with the corresponding simulated behaviours, is presented. It provides a framework for the study of the effect of the different experimental models on the development of computational systems. This work also provides a set of general guidelines for the comparative testing and selection of experimental models and protocols to be used for parameter optimization in computational models.\nComputational models are becoming an increasingly important tool in biomedical research, allowing for the study of complex phenomena in controlled environments1,2, the prediction of a system\u2019s behaviour in multiple conditions3,4, and the testing of hypotheses5,6. Experimental corroboration, here defined as the combination of computational model calibration and validation, is a key aspect in the development of these tools, as it represents the connection between the in-silico and the in-vitro models.\nCalibrating a computational model consists of the identification of its parameters so as to recapitulate the process of interest. Multiple search and optimisation algorithms can be used in this phase3,7\u20139, although empirical parameters selection remains common when a small number of well constrained parameters needs to be identified. Validation is the procedure used to determine the accuracy of the computational model and generally involves the comparison between simulated results and experimental data not used during the calibration phase. This step is widely recognised as fundamental for the development of useful and effective computational models and a wealth of resources and guidelines are available from the recent scientific literature4,10,11.\nThe effect of the experimental model on the results of the computational model\u2019s corroboration, however, remains largely unexplored. This is a critical aspect, as multiple evidences point to a major role of the in-vitro model in determining cell behaviour, especially when considering 3D cell cultures12\u201314. Maintaining cells in a 3D environment is becoming more and more common as their increased complexity tends to enable a more accurate replication of the behaviours observed in-vivo15,16. But availability of complete datasets acquired in comparable conditions can be a challenge. This often leads to the necessity of corroborating a computational model using data acquired on a combination of 2D and 3D settings. This practice has potentially deleterious effects on the\nOPEN\n1Gynaecological Cancer Research Group, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia. 2Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Engineering, Department of Electrical Electronic and Information Engineering \u201cG.

To test this hypothesis, we here present a comparative study of the same computational model corroborated with datasets acquired using either a 2D monolayer culture, 3D experimental models, or a combination of the two, to characterise, in a controlled and thorough manner, the effect on the computational model parameters of combining experimental data acquired from different models.\nAs a case study, we chose to focus on transcoelomic metastasis, the major mechanism of metastasis (or cancer spread) in ovarian cancer17. It occurs via the seeding of cancer cells onto the omentum, or other tissues within the abdominal cavity, following their detachment from the ovary and it is enabled by the ascites fluid which builds up in this region, and by the receptiveness of the surrounding tissues to colonisation18\u201324.\nThe extensive cell-cell and cell-environment interactions involved in this process have led to the development of a number of 3D cell culture models in order to research facets of this phenomenon12,25\u201329. We selected a 3D organotypic model30,31 used extensively to study the invasion and adhesion capabilities of ovarian cancer cells32\u201336 and 3D bio-printed multi-spheroids for the quantification of proliferation.\nTogether, these experimental models allow us to study both the initial phases of metastasis, when cells floating within the abdominal cavity exhibit a phenotype associated with very little proliferation, and the later stages of this process, when sustained cancer cell proliferation is observed within the omentum37. In all cases, standard assays performed on 2D monolayers were used as comparison.\nThe structure of the computational model was maintained constant throughout the analysis, to enable the comparison between the results obtained with different datasets. Changes in the parameter sets and the resulting simulations were analysed and used to draw general conclusions regarding the selection of the most appropriate experimental setting for the characterisation of each property. Validation of the computational model, through the comparison between the simulations and data not previously used during the calibration phase, provided a strategy to identify which combination of experimental data was associated with the most accurate in-silico representation of response to treatment in our model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)."

It uses the Otsu\u2019s method to segment the nuclei and a labelling routine to identify each segmented region and thus determine the total number of cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a,b).The accuracy of this method was evaluated by comparing the number of cells retrieved by the software for each image, with the corresponding manual count obtained by an expert user using ImageJ (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). The two measures are highly correlated (R2 = 0.95), and their average percentage error is consistent with the inter-operator variability for this assay (about 18%45). As such, the automatic count was considered to be equivalent to the manual one.\nFor the images obtained during 3D experiments, two additional filters based on the average fluorescence intensity and area were used to separate cancer cells from fibroblasts and mesothelial cells. In particular, a cell was labelled as PEO4 if its area was between 50 and 5,000 pixels and its average fluorescence intensity was higher than that of the background (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d,e,f).\nSALSA modelling and computational simulations Computational simulations were conducted in SALSA46\u201348, a hybrid continuous-discrete cellular automaton freely available at https:// www. mcbeng. it/ en/ categ ory/ softw are. html. The continuous component of the model solves the diffusion equation to retrieve the distribution of relevant variables (glucose, oxygen, drug concentration) throughout the simulated culture. The discrete one, on the other hand, models cell behaviour through a series of probabilistic rules describing macroscopic behaviours (e.g. migration, division, cell death). A cubic 3D lattice constitutes the main structure of the simulator (Fig.\u00a01a). Cells can be positioned at each of the grid\u2019s nodes and the values of the continuous variables are computed at the same locations. Specifically formatted configuration files (available as supplementary material) are used to formalize cell behaviour and initialise the experimental conditions. The simulation then proceeds for a set number of iterations, each corresponding to one hour. At each iteration the concentration of the continuous variables is updated, solving the diffusion equation and, for each cell, one of the behavioural rules is executed according to their probability. The reader is referred to46 or https:// www. mcbeng. it/ en/ categ ory/ softw are. html for further details on the simulation structure and functioning.\nModifications to the SALSA seeding procedure were implemented to replicate the layered structure of the omentum (Fig.\u00a01a). Fibroblasts cells were limited to the bottom half of the model, with mesothelial cells located immediately on top. Cancer cells were initially positioned above the mesothelial layer and were constrained to move toward the bottom, as the region above them represents the peritoneal cavity. The position of each cell, within the specific region, was randomly determined as in previous versions of SALSA.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:15769 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42486-3\nFigure\u00a01b summarises the computational representation of the 3D organotypic model. It comprises 5 different cell states: (i) fibroblasts, (ii) mesothelial cells (iii) dead PEO4 cells, (iv) quiescent PEO4 cells and (v) proliferating PEO4 cells. Arcs within the graph in Fig.\u00a01b represent the behavioural rules and are labelled with the equations describing their probability of occurrence (see Table\u00a01 for the definition of each variable). These rules were determined collating multiple evidence from the scientific literature, with the aim of describing the behaviour of PEO4 cells. Parameters a\u2013e (on the arcs in Fig.\u00a01b) are scale factors that allow to modulate the likelihood of each rule independently of the value of the variables in its probability functions. They were empirically estimated through the procedure described in the following section. Fibroblasts and mesothelial cells don\u2019t have a formalised behaviour and are assumed to maintain their status throughout the simulation. They however consume resources (glucose and oxygen), thus impacting indirectly the behaviour of the HGSOC cells.\nTreatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel was modelled as described in47. A sigmoid curve (S) was used to describe the probability of the drug affecting cell behaviour as a function of the local drug concentration (D). The parameters of this response curve were identified, using the IC50 values and assuming no effect in absence of the drug. In both cases, only proliferation (PR) and the rate of cell death (CDR) were considered to be affected by the treatment, in accordance with the mechanism of action of these agents49,50. Eqs.\u00a01 and 2 show the modified probability functions for proliferating cancer cells doubling and the quiescent cancer cells death, while Supplementary Fig.\u00a03 reports the updated state graph."

            "text": "Initially, the parameters describing the behaviour of the culture in absence of treatment (Fig.\u00a01) were calibrated. A number of different values between 0 and 1 were considered for each parameter (0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1) and every possible combination of these values was simulated 3 times for the equivalent of 72 h. Regular sampling was preferred to pseudo-random methods (e.g., Latin Hypercube) as it is associated with a more thorough exploration of the parameter space when a limited number of parameters with well-defined ranges need to be identified. The replicates were then averaged and a score comparing simulated and in-vitro data was computed (Eq.\u00a03). Supplementary Fig.\u00a04. shows an analysis of how the score varies (Eq.\u00a03) with the distance from the optimal configuration. For this analysis, the distance from the optimal parameter set was computed as in Eq.\u00a04 where i is an index that varies between the parameters a and e, pc(i) is the value of the parameter i in the current configuration and po(i) the value of the same parameter in the optimal parameter set. The median and interquartile range of the error distributions are largely conserved both across different parameter configurations and among computational models. While this might indicate that the computational models exhibit a limited range of behaviours, it also suggests that the exploration of the parameter space presented in this work is sufficient. Of note is the increase in the error range when considering the doubling rate measured in 3D (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e\u2013h). While median and interquartile ranges are mostly consistent with those obtained for 2D proliferation data (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a\u2013d), this might suggest an increased complexity of the behaviour measured in 3D, that fewer parameter configurations can recapitulate. Regular sampling, additionally, provides a general overview of the range of behaviours that the computational model can achieve. This characterisation was used to verify that the behavioural rules were suitable to describe transcoelomic metastasis in HGSOC. Maintaining the same possible values for all the parameters, additionally, simplifies the comparison among them and the determination of their relative importance for the recapitulation of specific behaviours.\n(1)PD = a \u00b7 TLD + c \u00b7 (Glu+ O2)\u2212 f \u00b7 S(D)\n(2)CDR = b \u00b7 AGE\nGlu+ O2 \u2212 g \u00b7 S(D)\n(3)S = Sp + Si + Sa\n(4)Distance = e\u2211\ni=a\n|pc(i)\u2212 po(i)|\nTable 1.

EG is the expected population growth. It was set to 2 for the monolayer cultures (based on a simulation length equivalent to 72 h and a doubling time between 36 and 46 h38) and to 0.87 for the 3D hydrogel multispheroids. This value was obtained as the number of cells counted in bright-field images obtained during a 7 day long experiment in the IncuCyte real-time cell imaging instrument (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a). Finally, Isilico and Ivitro are the number of invaded HGSOC cells and Ax the measured amount of adherent PEO4 cells at T = x.\nSp measures the effectiveness of the computational model in recapitulating cancer cell proliferation. Si achieves the same purpose, but it compares the number of invaded cells measured in-vitro with the average number of migration events recorded during the simulation. Sa has a similar structure, but it compares the number of simulated PEO4 cells at iterations 2-4 to the corresponding results of the adhesion experiments. These terms were assigned equal importance in the definition of the score (Eq.\u00a03) to favour parameter configurations modelling proliferation, invasion and adhesion with the same accuracy. The time-points at which the experimental data were acquired were selected independently for each assay, as differences in timescale and duration of the characterised processes prevented the identification of a single experiment duration.\nA total of 8 different computational models were identified, using every possible combination of 2D and 3D data (Table\u00a02) and choosing the parameter set associated with the best (i.e., lowest) score value.\nThe same procedure was repeated for the two parameters recapitulating the drug treatment. In this case, treatment with IC50 values of cisplatin and paclitaxel (10.4 \u00b5 M and 3.04 nM respectively51), was simulated. Sp (Eq.\u00a05) was used to evaluate the performance of each configuration, with an expected population growth of 0.5, according to the definition of IC50."

Hydrogel multi-spheroids, on the other hand, yield accurate proliferation measurements, but lack the multilayer structure useful for the study of invasion. As such, we decided to exploit the strengths of both systems and evaluate adhesion and invasion in the organotypic model and proliferation and drug response in the 3D hydrogel multi-spheroids. The same measures were also obtained in standard 2D cell cultures.\nAdhesion, invasion and proliferation data were used to calibrate the computational models (right end side of Fig.\u00a02). To test the effect of using different experimental models on the simulated results we considered all possible combinations of 2D and 3D data. The calibrated computational models allowed study of the in-silico behaviour of PEO4 cells both in absence and presence of treatment. The simulated dose response curves were compared with their experimental counterpart, acquired both in 2D monolayers and in the 3D hydrogel multi-spheroids, to determine which combination of calibration data yielded the computational model better replicating the treatment response of PEO4 cells (left end side of Fig.\u00a02)."

As described in the methods section, a score was computed for each simulated parameters configuration (Eq.\u00a03), and the one associated with the lowest value was selected.\nFigure\u00a04 reports the results of this analysis both as individual score components (panels a. to c.) and overall score value (panel d.). For each computational model the score values are reported as average and standard deviation (computed over 50 simulations). No statistical analysis was conducted on these data, as each computational model was compared to its own reference dataset. This change in experimental data, together with other factors (e.g., a different variability in the simulated data) could affect the shape of the cumulative distributions of the score and thus have a non-negligible effect on the results of the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Comparing the distribution averages, while limited to the available samples, is more robust to these changes and as such it was preferred.\nThe use of experimental data acquired in 3D seems to be associated with an overall lower score (1.7 for computational model 8 vs 2.8 for computational model 1), but the main result of this analysis is the low relevance of the experimental model used to evaluate adhesion. Indeed, in most cases, both 2D and 3D experimental data yield the same parameter set (Table\u00a03). The only exceptions are computational models 3 and 4, which are however associated with very similar configurations (Table\u00a03) and overall score (Fig.\u00a04).\nThe parameters describing drug response were determined in the same way.

In particular, each computational model (bars color-coded as in Table\u00a03) was independently analysed for its ability to recapitulate the experimental dose response curves (black and grey bars for 2D and 3D data respectively). Most of the computational models showed limited response to treatment and a statistically significant difference between the simulated and experimental data (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, * p < 0.05, ** p<0.01), especially at the higher drug concentrations. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test compares cumulative distributions and, as such, could be affected by a change in standard deviation between simulated and experimental data. Despite this drawback, we can conclude that computational model 4 recapitulates the dose response curve accurately.\nIt corresponds to using 3D data for both invasion and adhesion measurements and 2D measurements for proliferation (Table\u00a02). This result is also confirmed by relative error between experimental and simulated data (Table\u00a05). In this case the relative change between experimental (E([D])) and simulated (S([D])) results was computed (Eq.\u00a08) for each drug concentration ([D]), and then summed to provide an indication of how well the model captures the entire dose response curve.\n(8)Error([D]) = |S([D])\u2212 E([D])|\nE([D])\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:15769 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42486-3\n3D data tend to be better approximated by the computational model, as the error is lower. This might be partly due to the more limited growth rate and response to treatment observed in 3D, which might be simpler to capture with the simulator. At the same time, this difference between treatment in 2D and 3D settings is commonly observed, both in terms of increased IC50 and reduced overall response52,53.\nHigh resolution analysis of simulated cell behaviour A key feature of SALSA is that it retains information on the position of each cell at each iteration. This enables study of the dynamic distribution of each population with sub-organoid resolution. In particular, the distribution of the average cell viability for each simulated cell type was computed as a function of time (x axis) and z coordinate (y axis). Cell viability was obtained, for each simulation, normalising the number of cells at each depth by the initial population cardinality. Averaging over the simulation yielded the heatmaps in Figs.\u00a07,\u00a08 and 9.\nThe difference between them is the treatment condition: Fig.\u00a07 outlines the behaviour of the different computational models in the absence of treatment while Figs.\u00a08 and\u00a09 refer to treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel at a concentration equal to the simulated IC50.

Any variation in the colour shade is due to the fact that virtual cells are randomly assigned a position within the allowed area, and this will result in a non-uniform distribution even when the average density is computed. Additionally, as virtual PEO4 cells move through the organoid they have the power of displacing fibroblasts and mesothelial cells, hence producing the slight decrease in the density of these cells observed as time progresses.\nThe behaviour of virtual PEO4 cells is conceptually the same in all models: their initial location is on top of the mesothelial cells, and they progressively infiltrate the underlying layers. The different computational models are however characterised by varying degrees of infiltration and proliferation within the organoid.\nConfigurations calibrated with the 3D invasion data (computational models 3, 4, 7/8) result in a more extensive infiltration (i.e., cancer cells present at lower depth values) while 2D proliferation (computational models 1/2, 3 and 4) is associated with an overall higher number of cancer cells. 3D invasion is also connected with a higher rate of PEO4 cell death especially in the shallower layers of the organoid and the second half of the simulation. This might be connected to the dependence of cell death on the age of the cancer cells, which is likely to be higher toward the end of the simulation and in the region where this type of cells was initially located.\nComparing Fig.\u00a07 with Figs.\u00a08 and\u00a09 highlights the effect of the treatments on the behaviours of the different cell types.\ndead\nmesothelialfibroblasts\ncancer quiescent\ncancer proliferant\na. b.\nFigure\u00a01.

PEO4 cells, on the other hand, have a generally reduced growth and more limited infiltration within the virtual organotypic model. This seems to be connected to a delay in both these processes, whose probability increases as the effective drug concentration decreases due to degradation.\nCell death is also increased in the presence of treatment and this process seems to be more sustained over time. Surprisingly however, the number of dead cells becomes relevant at about the same time as in the untreated condition, suggesting that, in our simulations, treatment alone is not sufficient to induce cell quiescence and death. This is consistent with the treatment resistant nature of PEO4 cells but might also reflect the need for a more detailed modelling of drug response."

            "text": "Computational modelling has acquired great relevance in biomedical and cancer research, both as a tool for fundamental research54\u201356 and as an aid for clinical decision making57\u201359. As such, an in-depth analysis of the calibration and validation procedures is necessary to maximise the utility and accuracy of these models.\nThe focus of this work has been the effect of using different experimental models to calibrate and/or validate the computational simulator and how this choice affects the in-silico results. To this end, we measured ovarian cancer cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in both 2D monolayers and 3D cultures and evaluated the consequences of using distinct combinations of these data for the corroboration of the same computational system, a virtual representation of transcoelomic metastasis realised in SALSA (Fig.\u00a01). This biological process was chosen as it is highly dependent on the 3D interaction between different kinds of the cells and their environment, a feature expected to magnify the difference between more accurate experimental models and simplified systems.\nThe use of different datasets led to the identification of computational models characterised by distinct parameters (Tables\u00a03,\u00a04) and a varying degree of accuracy when compared with the experimental data (Fig.\u00a04, Table\u00a04). From these results, the use of at least some of data acquired in a 3D setting tends to be associated with a lower error, underscoring the importance of accurate in-vitro models for the corroboration of in-silico systems.\nFi br\nob la\nst s\nC an\nce r c\nel ls\nM es\not he\nlia l\nce lls\n1 / 2 3 4 5 / 6 7 / 8\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\nde pt h de pt h\nde pt\nh\nD ea\nd ce\nlls\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\nt t t t t\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nt t\nde pt\nh\nt de\npt h\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt de\npt h\nt\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\n.0\n0.01\n0.02\nC ell viability\n0.0\n0.07\n.14\nC ell viability\n0.0\n0.36\n0.72\nC ell viability\n0.0\n0.01\n0.03\nC ell viability\nm\np\nm\nFigure\u00a07.

The value of the b parameter, which modulates the death rate and the transition between proliferative and quiescent states (Table\u00a03), is strictly associated with the experimental model used to evaluate invasion, suggesting that culture in the organotypic model increases the likelihood of both these phenomena. On the other hand, the values of c and e (Table\u00a03) are mainly determined by the setting used to measure proliferation. As such, 2D monolayer seems to favour proliferation, while growing in 3D promotes migration and invasion. This is qualitatively coherent with with evidence from the literature37 and is also confirmed by our experimental data, as the average number of cells able to invade through the organotypic model is almost double that measured in the 2D setting (Fig.\u00a03b). These considerations are also supported by the results presented in Fig.\u00a07, where simulated dynamic evolution of the density of the different cell types is presented as a function of their position within the organotypic model. computational models calibrated with 3D invasion data (computational models 3, 4, 7 / 8) are associated with a deeper infiltration of cancer cells and a higher density of dead cells. 3D proliferation (computational models 5/6 and 7/8), on the other hand results in an overall lower number of cancer cells, in agreement with the in-vitro data used for the calibration.\nThe experimental model used to evaluate cell adhesion seems to be less relevant with 6 out of 8 models being invariant with respect to this property. This could be due to the similarity between the measurements obtained in the two experimental setups (Fig.\u00a03a) but is also a reflection of the mainly surface nature of this phenomenon, which might resent less from the simplification in the experimental setting.\nAnother key difference between the experimental data measured in 2D and 3D is the increase in variability in the latter (Figs.\u00a03,\u00a05,\u00a06). This is a phenomenon frequently observed when transitioning from monolayer cultures to more complex setups which has been linked to differences in the microenvironments experienced by each cell and have been shown to improve resilience and adaptability60.\nThe validation of these computational models was conducted by comparing the simulated dose response curves to cisplatin and paclitaxel with the corresponding experimental results obtained in 2D monolayers and 3D hydrogel models (Figs.\u00a05,\u00a06).

Most computational models are also associated with a limited response to treatment and a low sensitivity to the change in drug concentration. This is likely dependent on the formalization of cancer cell behaviour and response to treatment used within this work, and further analysis on how changing the computational model structure and probabilities affects the simulated results is warranted. Beside potentially improving the simulated drug response, this perspective study would also shed light on the role of each simulated variable (e.g., nutrients availability, cell age) in determining cell behaviour, and could provide useful insights on the biology of HGSOC cells. One of the simulated computational models (computational model 4), however, was able to effectively recapitulate 2D and 3D dose response curves. It was calibrated using 2D proliferation data and 3D invasion and adhesion measurements. Furthermore, the drug response parameters for this configuration feature a high rate of proliferation inhibition and a comparatively low induction of cell death. Overall, these characteristics produce a response comparable to model 8, which was calibrated using only 3D data, at low and mid drug levels (Figs.\u00a05,\u00a06,\u00a08,\u00a09). It however produces a better response when higher concentrations of treatment are simulated. Particularly relevant is the comparison with computational model 3, which exhibited a substantially equivalent behaviour in absence of treatment (Fig.\u00a04) but a much more drug-resistant phenotype (Figs.\u00a05,\u00a06). The values of parameters f and g for these configurations suggest that, at least in this configuration, inhibiting cell proliferation might be a more effective treatment strategy than inducing cell death. Of note is also the change score rank between calibration and validation (Fig.\u00a04, Table\u00a04). Differences in the experimental data used as reference, and the addition of treatment response in the latter computational model are likely responsible for this variation.\nOverall, while the results of this work might not be directly transferrable to different experimental and computational models, this analysis allows to draw three conclusions with general applicability.\nFirstly, the interaction of multiple phenomena can result in different datasets producing similar results. This is a longstanding problem in stochastic computational modelling61\u201363, known as model identifiability, which can limit the predictive power of the computational model. An example of this phenomenon can be observed in Figs.\u00a08,\u00a09, where computational models 4 and 7 / 8 yield comparable cancer cells densities, despite having been\nFi br\nob la\nst s\nC an\nce r c\nel ls\nM es\not he\nlia l\nce lls\n1 / 2 3 4 5 / 6 7 / 8\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\nde pt h de pt h\nde pt\nh\nD ea\nd ce\nlls\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\nt t t t t\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nde pt\nh\nt t\nde pt\nh\nt de\npt h\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\n0 000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\n0.016\n0.020\n0.024\n0.028\n0.032\nC elldensity\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt de\npt h\nt\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\nde pt\nh\nt\n.0\n0.01\n0.02\nC ell viability\n0.0\n0.07\n.14\nC ell viability\n0.0\n0.36\n0.72\nC ell viability\n0.0\n0.01\n0.03\nC ell viability\nm\np\nFigure\u00a09.

In this case, a higher number of dead cells in computational model 4 compensates for the faster proliferation of this configuration. The comparative analysis presented in this work can be a useful tool for the identification of these compensatory mechanisms, thus enabling a deeper understanding of the computational models and their mechanisms.\nSecondly, maximising the similarity between the simulated and experimental setups is associated with a low error throughout all the analysis. Indeed, while a combination of 2D and 3D data most accurately captured the response to cisplatin and paclitaxel, exclusively using data measured in 3D settings resulted in the best score for the calibration stage (Fig.\u00a03 and second best in the drug response (Tables\u00a04,\u00a05).\nThirdly, behaviours more strictly connected with the interaction between the cells and the 3D environment seem to be affected more deeply by simplifications of the experimental model. In our experiments, the number of invaded cells almost doubled shifting from a 2D to a 3D setting (Fig.\u00a03b) and the behaviour of models corroborated with 3D invasion data was markedly different from their 2D counterpart. On the other hand, quantifying adhesion in a 2D or 3D setting had little effect on the computational model\u2019s results. As such, should it not be possible to use exclusively 3D experimental models, properties characterised by limited cell-cell and cell-environment interactions are expected to be the less affected by the simplification of the experimental model.\nOverall, many obstacles are still in the way of a complete integration of in-silico and in-vitro analyses, but this and other works provide important insights on how these issues can be addressed and workflows adapted to reap the benefits of computational analysis for the study of complex biological processes."
