Tullock contests model real-life scenarios that range from competition among proof-of-work blockchain miners to rent-seeking and lobbying activities. We show that continuous-time bestresponse dynamics in Tullock contests with convex costs converges to the unique equilibrium using Lyapunov-style arguments. We then use this result to provide an algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium. We also establish convergence of related discrete-time dynamics, e.g., when the agents best-respond to the empirical average action of other agents. These results indicate that the equilibrium is a reliable predictor of the agentsâ€™ behavior in these games. 1. conclusion and future research We showed that the continuous BR dynamics, which is motivated by the observation that in certain applications the agents change their actions slowly compared to the feedback they receive from others, converges to the unique equilibrium in Tullock contests with convex costs. We then extended these convergence results to related discrete dynamics with small step sizes. These results indicate that we can expect Tullock contests with convex costs to reach equilibrium in a decentralized manner.
