In this paper, we provide an explicit, symmetric integrator for this problem. Such an integrator is more efficient than the symplectic Euler method and the Gauss Runge\u2013Kutta method as regards this problem. In addition, we proved the integrator is symplectic by the discrete Hamilton\u2019s principle. Several groups of numerical experiments demonstrated the precision and high efficiency of the integrator in the examples of the quadratic potential and the bounded orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem.",

            "text": "As space science advances, spacecraft orbit design missions become more complex, and as a result the need for advanced and efficient algorithms has grown. For example, the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope orbits the Halo orbit (Figure 1) near the second Lagrangian point L2 of the Sun-Earth restricted three-body problem. Since this Halo orbit is chaotic, the telescope needs to recalibrate the orbit after a timescale. The circular restricted three-body problem is a non-canonical Hamiltonian system, which can be transformed into canonical form. Explicit symplectic algorithms such as the symplectic Euler method can be used to the canonical form, but we argue below that our proposed method is more efficient. This paper provides a highly efficient algorithm for numerical orbit design and recalibration of orbits to the circular restricted three-body problem.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1769. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14091769 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nThe canonical Hamiltonian system could be the most important physical systems and a canonical Hamiltonian system in the variables z = (p, q) given in the form\np\u0307 = \u2212Hq(p, q) q\u0307 = Hp(p, q)\n(1)\nwhere p, q \u2208 Rd. Or equivalently\nz\u0307 = J\u22121\u2207H(z), J = (\n0 Id \u2212Id 0\n) , (2)\nwhere Id is a d\u00d7 d identity matrix. It has an outstanding property that the flow of Hamiltonian system is symplectic. It naturally finds those discrete systems that preserve the properties of symplecticity and the inner symmetries of original Hamiltonian system. Therefore, the symmetric, symplectic algorithms [1\u20135] are the standard methods to such problems. In addition, efficient structure-preserving methods [6,7] are also a research focus. The well-known Boris algorithm [8\u201313] in the plasma dynamics has some good geometric properties. Generally, it is symmetric, second-order, volume-preserving [9], and not symplectic [10]. However, in special configuration of the homogeneous magnetic field, the integrator is variational symplectic and preserves near-conservation of energy over long-term evolution [10,14]. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we gave a brief introduction to co-rotating coordinate systems and the proposed explicitly symmetric integrator \u03c8b. In Sections 3 and 4, we analyzed long term energy behaviors for this integrator and proved its symplectic property. In Section 5, two groups of numerical experiments were conducted to check the precision and high efficiency of the integrator. Finally, we summarize this work in Section 6."

In this subsection, we show that the numerical integrator \u03c8b is symplectic. We choose the discrete Lagrangian Lh as\nLh(xn, xn+1) = 12\u2206t (xn+1 \u2212 xn)2+ 1 2 \u2126 \u00b7 (rn + rn+1)\u00d7 (rn+1 \u2212 rn)\u2212 \u2206t\u03d5(xn).\n(14)\nThe discrete form of \u222b tN\nt0 L(x(t), x\u0307(t))dt, i.e., the action Sh is\nSh(x0, . . . , xN) = N\u22121 \u2211 n=0 Lh(xn, xn+1), (15)\nwhere Lh is the discrete Lagrangian. According to the discrete Hamilton\u2019s principle, the discrete Euler\u2013Lagrange equation reads\nD2Lh(xn\u22121, xn) + D1Lh(xn, xn+1) = 0, (16)\npn = \u2212D1Lh(xn, xn+1), pn+1 = D2Lh(xn, xn+1),\n(17)\nwhere Di is the partial derivative with respect to the i-th argument. The corresponding formula of the formulation (17) is the formula (6). By eliminating pn, the evolution formulation of xn can be obtained, which is \u03c8b, as follows\nxn+1 \u2212 2xn + xn\u22121 \u2206t + 2\u2126\u00d7 xn+1 \u2212 xn\u22121 2 = \u2212\u2206t\u2207\u03d5(xn). (18)\nA straightforward calculation gives the equation of dpn+1 \u2227 dxn+1 = dpn \u2227 dxn (refer to the Theorem 5.1 of Chapter 6 in Hairer [17]). It proves that the integrator \u03c8b is symplectic and defines a symplectic map (pn, xn) 7\u2192 (pn+1, xn+1). It is also well-known that the symplectic integrator has the property of near-conservation of energy over a long time. The error expression (12) is estimated by taking into account the formal energy of the modified equation [18]."
