However such simulations are still challenging. We discuss the adaption of efficient algorithms, like multigrid methods or higher order integrators, within the molecular dynamic steps of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, that are enabling simulations of a new set of gauge ensembles by the Extended Twisted Mass collaboration (ETMC). We present the status of the on-going ETMC simulation effort that aims to enabling studies of finite size and discretization effects. We work within the twisted mass discretization which is free of odd-discretization effects at maximal twist and present our tuning procedure.\nThe 38th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory, LATTICE2021 26th-30th July, 2021 Zoom/Gather@Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\u2217Speaker\n\u00a9 Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). https://pos.sissa.it/\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 1 ) 2 8 4\n0.06 0.08 0.1\n0.175/w 0 [fm]\n3\n4\n5\nm *\nL\nETMC 2021\n-ongoing-\n0.06 0.08 0.1\n0.175/w 0 [fm]\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nm [\nM e\nV ]\nETMC 2021 -ongoing-\nFigure 1: Overview of the current \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 2 + 1 + 1 twisted mass clover-improved ensembles.

            "text": "During the past decade, progress has been made enabling simulations of twisted mass fermions at physical quark masses at several lattice spacings less than 0.1 fm and volumes as large as 9 fm [1, 2]. These ensembles drive the rich physics program of the Extended Twisted Mass collaboration (ETMC), which ranges from measurements of quark masses, precision measurements of CKMmatrix elements, hadron spectroscopy and scattering, nucleon structure, semi-leptonic decays and many other ETMC projects.\nIn this presentation, we overview the progress on the algorithmic and computational side that made the generation of these ensembles possible. More specifically, we discuss how to fix the parameters of the simulations, which needs a careful fine tuning procedure in order to achieve O(\ud835\udc4e) improvement, how to optimize the multigrid solver DDalphaAMG [3, 4] and how to improve the force computation during the Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations. The use of a three level multigrid procedure comes with some limitation for current HPC machines equipped with CPUs that limit scalability. Furthermore, we present selected results using the generated statistics and discuss autocorrelations using the physical point ensembles."

Note that taking \ud835\udf07\ud835\udeff = 0 the mass-degenerate twisted mass operator in flavor space is recovered. Twisted mass fermions have several advantages. Lattice artefacts of odd power in \ud835\udc4e can be removed if the Partially Conserved Axial Current (PCAC) mass is tuned to zero, i.e. \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udf05) \u2212\u2192 0 [6]. This can be done by fine tuning the bare Wilson quark mass parameter\ud835\udc5a = 0.5/\ud835\udf05\u22124 to its critical mass\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = 0.5/\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u22124. Moreover, in the case of a finite twisted mass value, the operator \ud835\udc37 is non-singular. For the squared operator one gets in fact\n\ud835\udc37\u2020\ud835\udc37 = \ud835\udc37\u2020 \ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4a + \ud835\udf072 , (2)\nwith \ud835\udf07 playing the role of an infra-red cut-off for the eigenvalues of \ud835\udc37. While this guarantees convergence of iterative methods, such as the conjugate gradient solver, the twisted mass term breaks isospin symmetry. This results in a mass-splitting within the pion triplet. The neutral pion\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 1 ) 2 8 4\nmass is shifted with respect to the charged pion mass, which is given in next to leading order (NLO) chiral perturbation theory [7] by\n\ud835\udc4e2(\ud835\udc5a2 \ud835\udf0b0 \u2212 \ud835\udc5a2\ud835\udf0b\u00b1) = \u2212\ud835\udc500 \u00b7 \ud835\udc4e 2 . (3)\nThis cut-off effect, if large, can give neutral pion mass of zero at finite quark masses and trigger a phase transition. For values of the neutral pion mass close to zero, tuning the PCAC mass to zero becomes notoriously difficult and such Monte Carlo simulations of twisted mass fermions become impossible. This prevented simulation at physical pion masses without a clover term. Including a clover term, reduces lattice artefacts which decreases the mass gap between the charged and neutral pion given in Eq. (3) to such an extent as to make simulations at values of \ud835\udc4e \u223c 0.09 possible [9]. For our setup we use 1-loop tadpole boosted perturbation theory [8] to fix the value of the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4a parameter, given by\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4a = 1 + 0.113(3) 6\n\ud835\udefd\u3008\ud835\udc43\u3009 (4)\nwith \u3008\ud835\udc43\u3009 the plaquette."

Note that the PCAC mass depends also on the heavy quark parameters \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0e and \ud835\udf07\ud835\udeff of the non-degenerated twisted mass operator. Due to this dependence on the heavy quark pair, charm and strange, we utilise Osterwalder Seiler (OS) fermions [31] to set the strange and charm quark mass. We then match the non-unitary setup of the OS-fermions with the unitary setup with non-degenerate twisted mass fermions. This results in three tuning conditions for the heavy quark parameters. The first two are given by\n\ud835\udc361 = \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc50\n\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc60 = 11.8 and \ud835\udc362 =\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60\n= 7.9 (8)\nthat set the strange and charm quark mass parameters in the OS sector.

This procedure requires for the tuning of the A-, B- and C- ensembles to generate for each steps roughly two Markov chains with around 500 MDU, see [2] for a detailed discussion for the case of the B-lattice spacing. For the D-lattice we modify the tuning procedure by making use of reweighting for all parameters {\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udf07\u2113 , \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0e , \ud835\udf07\ud835\udeff} [10\u201312]. This reduces the number of ensembles needed for the tuning, namely to one per iteration circle.\nWith the help of reweighting by changing the bare parameters by 1% to 5% we could give an estimate of the first derivatives of \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udf07\u2113 , \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0e , \ud835\udf07\ud835\udeff). This quantity was estimated in the case of the tuning procedure of the A-, B- and C-lattice spacings via generation of several ensembles.\nFor the tuning of the D-lattice spacing we generate two different ensembles at twisted mass values \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udf07 = 0.002 and \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udf07 = 0.00125 and volumes of \ud835\udc49 = 323 \u00d7 64 and \ud835\udc49 = 483 \u00d7 96, respectively.

We find for the fit coefficients \ud835\udc500 = 0.51(2), \ud835\udc501 = 1.37(6), \ud835\udc502 = 0.04(2) and \ud835\udc503 = 0.012(4). The resulting uncorrelated fit with \ud835\udf122 = 11.2 is shown in Fig. 2, where we include all available data points generated by reweighting resulting in 19 degrees of freedom. The critical mass parameter at physical light quark mass of \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udf07 = 0.00054 is given by \ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc37, (0) \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\n= 0.137973465. Based on this estimate we generate 500 MDUs at our the physical point with \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udf07 = 0.00054, leading to a slightly negative PCAC mass of \u22124.4(7)10\u22125. This does meet our criterion and thus we proceed to retune \ud835\udf05 using our estimate for the slope \ud835\udf15 \ud835\udc53 /\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc5a = 1.37 such that our final estimate for the critical Wilson mass parameter is given by \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 |\ud835\udefd=1.9 = 0.137972174 .\nWith this tuning procedure, that it is also outlined in ref.

Additionally, we have employed the mixed-precision linear solver provided by the software package QPhiX [19\u201323], which can be utilized for the larger mass shifts, where the algebraic multigrid solver becomes less effective.\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 1 ) 2 8 4"

            "text": "For all simulations of the physical point ensembles, we take advantage of the highly reduced computational costs of using multigrid solvers within the force calculation, see e.g. [4]. The use of multigrid solver within the integration of Hamiltons molecular dynamics requires some additional care and comes with some limitations. Namely, the scalability on HPC systems, such as SuperMUCNG, is limited by the volume of the coarsest grid within the multigrid procedure. This limits the strong scaling window, as depicted in Fig. 4, breaking down for a three-level MG method for a lattice of size \ud835\udc49 = 643 \u00d7 128 at around 80 Skylake nodes, and for a lattice of size \ud835\udc49 = 963 \u00d7 192 at around 420 Skylake nodes. This results in a roughly scaling of the upper bound of the strong scaling window by \ud835\udc3f3 or \ud835\udc493/4 and limits the maximal effective parallelisation of our HMC.\nThe lower bound of the working window using a multigrid solver is determined by memory requirements. In fact prolongation and restriction operators required for projecting iteration vectors from level to level and building up the coarser operators, need allocation of O(20) full vectors, a number which scales with the size of the volume. On SuperMUC-NG with 192 GB RAM per node this introduces a hard limit for the minimal parallelisation, given by about 16 nodes for lattice size of \ud835\udc49 = 643 \u00d7 128 and increasing to 80 nodes for a volume of \ud835\udc49 = 963 \u00d7 192.\nThe usage of a multigrid solver not only limits the scalability window, but can also compromise the correctness of the HMC sampling. By reusing and updating the coarse grid operators and the corresponding prolongation and restriction operators from previous integration steps, the reversibility criterium, which is needed to fulfil detailed balance, is violated. In order to assess the magnitude of the effect, we studied reversibility violation within the HMC using a test volume with size \ud835\udc49 = 323 \u00d7 64 and measuring the variance of \ud835\udeff\u0394\ud835\udc3b for different solvers. \ud835\udeff\u0394\ud835\udc3b is given by the difference of the Hamiltonian at the beginning of the trajectory with the Hamiltonian integrated to \ud835\udf0f = 1 and integrated back to the start. As discussed in Ref. [17] for variances below 0.01 no deviations from the expectation values, such as the plaquette, are found. To match the same precision in \ud835\udf0e2(\ud835\udeff\u0394\ud835\udc3b) as the mixed-precision solver of QPhiX, the square residual of the multigrid solver needs to be two orders of magnitudes smaller. For all our physical point ensembles, we checked reversibility and find that for the selected solver criteria (see [1]), \ud835\udf0e2(\ud835\udeff\u0394\ud835\udc3b) is below the bound of set in Ref. [17].\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 1 ) 2 8 4\nFigure 5: Comparison of different numerical integrators.

At constant acceptance rate it follows cost \u221d \ud835\udc491+ 12\ud835\udc5b with \ud835\udc5b the order of the selected integrator. Thus higher order schemes have a better volume scaling. A class of various different simplectic reversible integration schemes are discussed in Ref. [26]. This includes schemes improved with force gradient terms. For example, the second minimal norm scheme can be extended to fourth order\n\u0394(\u210e) = \ud835\udc52\u210e 16 ?\u0302?\ud835\udc52\u210e 12 ?\u0302?\ud835\udc52\u210e 23 ?\u0302?\u2212 172 \u210e3?\u0302?\ud835\udc52\u210e 12 ?\u0302?\ud835\udc52\u210e 16 ?\u0302?

The additional second derivate term, needed in the force gradient term, can be approximated by an additional force term, as outline in Ref. [25]. This not only reduces the cost of the calculation of one force calculation but also simplifies the application by implicitly taking care of cross-terms between different parts of the actions. It turns out that the force gradient improves the minimal norm scheme of Eq. 11 and outperforms for larger volumes the other integrators, as shown in Fig. 5 for a \ud835\udc3f = 24 lattice. Note that to tune the nested integrator setup we minimise the cost function at constant acceptance rate using an effective model for the higher order terms in line with Ref. [27]."

By enabling DDalphaAMG within the HMC, there is a reduction of the computational cost per trajectory by more than one order of magnitude [4]. In addition, the adaptation of DDalphaAMG to the non-degenerate twisted mass operator speeds up the nondegenerated sector, as discussed in Ref. [18]. The use of higher order integrators has given further improvements, especially going to larger volumes, such as \ud835\udc3f = 96 [28]. Note that there is still space for further improvements, for example, by coarse level improvements, which are currently under investigation.

Using the three ensembles cB211.072.64, cC211.060.80 and cD211.054.96, we can take the continuum limit, and with the two ensembles at the B-lattice spacing we can study finite volume effects. In the future, we are planing to simulate at larger volumes and explore new approaches for enabling simulations at lattice spacings smaller than 0.05 fm, which are currently limited by the critical slowing down of the algorithms and their scalability with the volume. Due to the behavior of the strong scaling window of our multigrid solver DDalphaAMG, the real time per trajectories will further increase resulting in longer generation times per ensemble.
