1. **Explore the synergistic effects of XHP components.** The study identified 199 compounds in XHP, including flavonoids, organic acids, esters, saponins, glycosides, ketones, aldehydes, coumarins, and alkaloids. Future research could investigate the synergistic effects of these compounds in XHP and how they contribute to the hepatoprotective effects of the extract.


2. **Study the effects of XHP on other liver diseases.** The study focused on the effects of XHP in an animal model of alcoholic liver disease. Future research could investigate the effects of XHP in other liver diseases, such as viral or autoimmune liver disease.


3. **Examine the effects of XHP on gut microbiota.** The gut microbiota is known to play a role in liver health. Future research could investigate the effects of XHP on the gut microbiota and how this may contribute to the hepatoprotective effects of the extract.


4. **Explore the potential of XHP as a профилактический agent for liver disease.** The study demonstrated that XHP exerted protective effects in an animal model of ALD. Future research could investigate the potential of XHP as a профилактический agent for liver disease, by studying its effects on liver health in healthy individuals or individuals at risk of developing liver disease.


5. **Identify the bioactive compounds in XHP responsible for its hepatoprotective effects.** The study identified 199 compounds in XHP, but it is not known which of these compounds are responsible for the hepatoprotective effects of the extract. Future research could use in vivo and in vitromethods to identify the bioactive compounds in XHP and study their mechanisms of action.
