conclusion and future work In this paper, we propose a novel Incremental 3D Object Recognition Network (InOR-Net) to recognize novel categories of 3D objects under a streaming manner, without the catastrophic forgetting on old 3D classes. Specifically, we focus on capturing the distinctive 3D characteristics within each class via a category-guided geometric reasoning, and identifying which 3D geometric characteristics are important to alleviate the forgetting on old classes of 3D objects via a critic-induced geometric attention. A dual adaptive fairness compensations strategy including both weights and prediction scores corrections is designed to tackle the forgetting brought by class imbalance problem. We verify the superior performance of the proposed InOR-Net model via extensive comparison experiments on representative point cloud datasets. The proposed model lacks some theoretical analysis to guarantee the convergence in the theory perspective, and may suffer from recognition performance degradation when the collected point cloud is heavily polluted by noise and loses some core geometric structures.
