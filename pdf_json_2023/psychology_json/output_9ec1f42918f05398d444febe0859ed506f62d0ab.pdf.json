    "abstractText": "Diabetes-induced oxidative stress induces the development of vascular complications, which are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Among these, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is often caused by functional changes in the blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB) due to harmful oxidative stress events in lipids, proteins, and DNA. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has a potential therapeutic effect against hyperglycemia-induced oxidative damage and apoptotic pathways in the main constituents of BRB, retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19). Effective antioxidant response elicited by DHA is driven by the activation of the Nrf2/Nqo1 signaling cascade, which leads to the formation of NADH, a reductive agent found in the cytoplasm. Nrf2 also induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the modulation of lipid metabolism induced by high-glucose (HG) on ARPE-19 cells through the integration of metabolic imaging and molecular biology to provide a comprehensive functional and molecular characterization of the mechanisms activated in the disease, as well the therapeutic role of DHA. This study shows that HG augments RPE metabolic processes by enhancing lipid metabolism, from fatty acid uptake and turnover to lipid biosynthesis and \u03b2-oxidation. DHA exerts its beneficial effect by ameliorating lipid metabolism and reducing the increased ROS production under HG conditions. This investigation may provide novel insight for formulating novel treatments for DR by targeting lipid metabolism pathways.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM), a multifactorial systemic disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide, has become more common over recent years [1]. The main symptom and clinical indicator of DM are persistent high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) due to insulin deficiency and impaired peripheral glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues [2]. DM is also associated with various metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia [3], elevated levels of circulating blood free fatty acids, impaired lipid turnover [4], increased oxidative stress [5,6], and abnormal production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [7,8]. Together, these changes lead to the development of diabetes-related vascular complications, which disrupt the vasculature\u2019s normal shape and physiology, causing gradual tissue and organ damage, dysfunction, and ultimately failure [9]. Nervous system damage (neuropathy), renal system damage (nephropathy), and eye damage (retinopathy) are caused by\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 339. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12020339 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 339 2 of 13\nmicrovascular malfunction, [10]. Conversely, diabetes-associated macro vascular disease is manifested in peripheral vascular disease and cardiovascular disease. Studying the variables that trigger diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction may lead to the discovery of new strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in subjects with diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction [9]. Several studies have shown that, among a wide range of chronic hyperglycemiainduced complications, such as inflammation [11,12], as well as the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), are leading causes of cellular damage. ROSs are very reactive radicals, ions, or molecules that are produced intracellularly by impaired mitochondrial functions or by interactions with exogenous sources. It is widely known that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR), which results in severe vision loss and blindness [13,14]. Indeed, being a part of the central nervous system (CNS), the retina is particularly vulnerable to changes in its microenvironment, whose maintenance is crucial to support the health and proper functionality of retinal cells [15]. Thus, impairments in the functionality of the blood\u2013retinal barrier (BRB) has been directly related to the onset and progression of retinal diseases [16]. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, situated between the neurosensory retina and the vascular choroids, have a crucial function in preserving the normal structural and functional integrity of the retina. These cells, which are characterized by a prevalently non-glycolytic metabolism [17], play an essential role in the retinal outer segment renewal by phagocytosis and digestion of shed outer segment tips. This phagocytic activity provides the RPE with lipids that may be either metabolized via \u03b2-oxidation to generate acetyl CoA or stored in the form of triglycerides (TAG) [18]. Being one of the most vulnerable cell populations of retina, and in view of the tight metabolic coupling with photoreceptors, RPE cell damage has been related to the development of DR, making them a useful and reliable model for researching the BRB\u2019s functional changes brought on by diabetes [19]. Amongst several metabolic pathways that have been implicated in diabetes-induced vascular damage, the metabolic alteration of the lipid turnover has been proposed to play a key role in BRB disruption, but the mechanisms are not yet fully investigated [20]. A positive correlation between increased plasma lipid levels and the initiation and progression of DR has been observed in various clinical trials [21\u201323]. Of interest are the studies that show that the administration of \u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may reduce the risk of DR onset and further progression [24]. For instance, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on retinal cells have received considerable attention, making it a potential protective agent. In a previous work [25], we investigated the potential protective role of DHA at physiological concentrations [26] to prevent hyperglycemia-induced oxidative damage and apoptotic pathways in ARPE-19 cells. This study reveals that the effective antioxidant response elicited by DHA is driven by the activation of the Nrf2/Nqo1 signaling cascade, as well as the formation of the reductive agent NADH in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, Nrf2, which is known to be a master regulator of the intracellular antioxidant system as well as of cellular homeostasis, also reduces the expression of genes that encode enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including \u03b2-oxidation and lipases [27]. From this perspective, to evaluate the effect on lipid turnover, we focused on different genes that are involved in several steps of lipid metabolic pathways, from fatty acids uptake (FATP1 and CD36) to lipid storage (DGAT1) and lipolysis (ATGL), including biosynthesis (SREBP) and \u03b2-oxidation (CPT1). This study aimed at investigating alterations in lipid metabolism induced by highglucose on ARPE-19 cells, as well as the potential ameliorating effects of DHA by combining metabolic imaging and gene expression of target proteins to provide a comprehensive functional and molecular characterization of mechanisms activated in the disease.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 339 3 of 13"

Representative scheme of pathways activated in response to HG. The schem represents t e observed metabolic and antioxid nt pathways activated in response to HG highlighti g the effects of DHA. Fatty acids (FA), whose uptake is modulated by CD36 and FATP1 through a series of chemical reactions, are stored in the form of TAG in lipid droplets. When required, TAG accumulated in LD can be broken down to be used in energy production. Several genes and enzymes regulate the lipid turnover, modifying the destination of intracellular lipids depending on cellular requirements. In our experimental model, DHA shows a modulatory effect on changes in lipid metabolism, as well as in redox homeostasis induced by high-glucose concentrations in ARPE-19 cells. SREBP and Nrf2 (in green) are transcription factors indirectly acting on the highlighted functions or pathways.\nWe found that high glucose levels caused a considerable stimulation of the whole lipid metabolism in RPE cells, ranging from FA absorption to lipolysis, as evidenced by the marked over-expression of various genes and receptors implicated in lipid metabolic pathways. The increased lipid metabolism triggered by HG conditions may be explained in terms of the role of glucose as a signaling biomolecule directly involved in oxidative and inflammatory pathways, which can potentially activate a cascade of molecular mechanisms [38,39]. We hav previously sh wn that, nder the s me experimental conditions, ROS formation and apoptotic pathways are triggered by HG in ARPE cells [25]. Since one of the main functions of RPEs is to establish a bidirectional flux between choroid and photoreceptors, modulating water, nutrients, ion, and waste product exchange between the outer a d inner p rt of the retina, an structural modificati n of RPE membrane can result in either accumulation of toxic substances or energy deprivation for photoreceptors due to the strong metabolic coupling. These impairments can lead to photoreceptors damage and can be directly involved in the onset and development of retinal degeneration, which ultimately results in vision loss following BRB breakdown, whose functional alterations have been observed to precede the onset of the pathology [15,40,41]. FA uptake processes are enhanced in HG cells, as shown by the increase in RNA levels of CD36 and FATP1 (Figure 1), which code for proteins that promote cellular FA absorption.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 339 10 of 13\nDHA supplementation in HG conditions significantly reduces mRNA expression levels of both FATP1 and CD36 [42], thus modulating the uptake of FAs and toxic lipoproteins in the retina and contributing to the maintenance of BRB integrity and functionality. FA turnover is enhanced in HG conditions, as shown by the significant increase induced by HG in the expression of DGAT1 and ATGL (Figure 2), respectively, the main drivers of lipid storage and lipolysis pathway. Further addition of DHA in HG conditions decreased only ATGL expression. Metabolic imaging experiments confirmed these alterations, as we found that lipid storage processes increased in HG cells, but the treatment with DHA further enhanced this pathway, as shown by the area fraction of non-polar aggregates. The significant increase in non-polar aggregates observed in DHA-treated cells is not surprising. Indeed, when the cells are exposed to such levels of DHA, their only alternative to survive the cytotoxic and detergent effect of the free FA is to store it as TAG in lipid droplets [31]. Another process affected by HG is lipid biosynthesis, indirectly tested through the SREBP expression. SREBP increased in presence of high-glucose concentrations with respect to CTRL, indicating an enhancement of the lipid biosynthetic pathways. Again, the addition of DHA down-regulated the expression of SREBP contrasting the HG induced effect. Additionally, \u03b2-oxidation is affected by HG and modulated by DHA. \u03b2-oxidation, and the ROS generated as byproducts, are modulated by DHA, which regulated this process by reducing CPT1 expression. In summary, HG increased RPE metabolic processes by enhancing fatty acid uptake and turnover, lipid biosynthesis, and also \u03b2-oxidation. We have previously shown that DHA also induced a potent antioxidant response in RPE cells under the same conditions, which activates the Nrf2/Nqo1 signaling cascade and causes the synthesis of the reductive coenzyme NADH in the cytoplasm. Therefore, DHA protects cells by both reducing oxidative species production, as shown in this work, and activating an antioxidant response, as shown in [25]. It is interesting to observe that, in view of their close correlation with the RPE, which is a crucial regulator of retinal function, the potential beneficial effects of other long-chain \u03c93-PUFA have also been investigated. In particular, in addition to DHA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has shown antioxidant properties and the capacity to protect RPE cells against the oxidative conditions associated with diabetic retinopathy, although by different mechanisms [43]. Interestingly, despite both having positive effects on ARPE-19 cells by lowering ROS generation and minimizing oxidative damage brought on by H2O2, this study highlighted that the effectiveness of PUFAs depends not only on whether they are administered alone or in combination with each other, but also on the formulation, with better results in triglyceride or phospholipid-based formulations compared with ethyl esters. In additions, it has already been shown that other compounds, such as punicalagin [44] or idebenone [45], can induce a protective and/or therapeutic response in RPE cells under oxidative stress conditions by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. An important limitation of this study, however, is the absence of lactate, a major substrate used by RPE cells to fuel fatty acid oxidation. Indeed, since these cells relies on the oxidative metabolism of the outer retina through the oxidation of fatty acids rather than glycolysis to support its metabolic needs, we speculate that in absence of lactate the level of oxidation would be lower than that retrieved in vivo. From this perspective, further research is needed to investigate the contribution of lactate in this in vitro model, as well as to highlight if Nrf2 could be a master regulator of the overall antioxidant response. Indeed, in several cell types, it was observed that, besides influencing the intracellular antioxidant system, Nrf2 is also responsible of inducing expression of genes, which encode enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including \u03b2-oxidation and lipases [27]. Moreover, the principal actors of these pathways have to be analyzed also in terms of Western blots and cellular assays."
