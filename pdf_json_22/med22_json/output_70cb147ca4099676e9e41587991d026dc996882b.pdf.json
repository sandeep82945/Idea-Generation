Concerns were raised regarding the alleged duplication of cell colony images in Figure 4 with the same images from Figure 9. Specifically,\n\u25cf Figure 4A, HGC-27, Control, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 9C, siRNA-NC+Leu, which has been flipped. \u25cf Figure 4A, HGC-27, siRNA-NC, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 9C, Control, which has been flipped. \u25cf Figure 4A, HGC-27, siRNA-CCAT2, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 9C, siRNACCAT2+Leu, which has been flipped. \u25cf Figure 4B, HGC-27, Control, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 9D, siRNA-CCAT2 +Leu, which has been flipped. \u25cf Figure 4B, HGC-27, siRNA-NC appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 9D, siRNA-NC +Leu, which has been flipped. \u25cf Figure 4B, HGC-27, siRNA-CCAT2, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 9D, Control, which has been flipped.\nThe authors did not respond to our queries and no explanation for the alleged image duplication was provided. The Editor determined the reported study to be unreliable and requested for the article to be retracted. The authors were notified of this.\nWe have been informed in our decision-making by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retractions.\nThe retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as \u201cRetracted\u201d."
