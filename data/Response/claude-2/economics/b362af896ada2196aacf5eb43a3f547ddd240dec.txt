 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct qualitative research to understand the specific barriers faced by digitally deprived children and families in accessing technology. Interviews or focus groups could provide insights into financial constraints, lack of digital skills, availability of public access points, etc. 

2. Examine the relationship between digital deprivation and educational outcomes over time. Does lack of home computer/internet access lead to poorer grades, lower test scores, higher dropout rates? A longitudinal study could shed light on long-term impacts.

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at providing technology access to digitally deprived students, such as discounted broadband programs, device lending programs, and digital skills training. This could identify best practices to inform policy. 

4. Study the second-level digital divide by assessing digital skills and online activities among digitally deprived youth compared to peers with home technology access. This could reveal deficits beyond basic access.

5. Take a comparative approach by analyzing digital deprivation rates and associated factors among children across multiple developed and developing countries. This could elucidate broader socioeconomic and policy determinants.
