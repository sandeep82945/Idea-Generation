"The fa, fH, and fc present a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the temperature increase in different heat treatments. The reason is that during the heating process of coal, cycloalkanes will dehydrogenate and aromatize and reach a high degree of aromatization at 623.15 K. This further indicates that temperature is crucial for the aromatization of coal. Subsequently, With the continuous increase in temperature, the activation energy of the coal sample combustion reaction decreases, leading to a decrease in aromaticity. The CH2/CH3 value gradually decreases with the temperature increase in different heat treatments, indicating that the length of the fat side chain becomes shorter and the number of branch chains increases. As for the heating process of coal, it exhibits the process of continuously breaking the fatty chain, decreasing the number of methylene groups, and increasing the number of methyl groups to form more shortbranched chains. With the increase in temperature of the heat-treated coal sample, the IR presents a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. This is because the coal removes the Câ€“O oxygen-containing functional groups, and the aromatics are destroyed in the later stage during the heating process. The maturity of organic matter (M) presents a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the temperature increase in heat-treated coal, indicating that the maturity of organic matter in coal gradually matures. However, due to the continuous increase in carbon content in coal, the variation in organic matter requires higher thermal energy. Meanwhile, the degree of condensation (DC) of the coal samples with different heat treatments is much higher than that of the raw coal (R-303.15 K) because unstable carboxyl and carbonyl oxygen-containing functional groups are continuously removed during the heating process."
