 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different dopant concentrations between 1-3% Ni to find the optimal level for photocatalytic activity. The paper found 1% was best but more concentrations could be tested. 

2. Test the photocatalytic activity against other organic pollutants besides methylene blue to see if the activity extends to other dyes/chemicals. 

3. Modify the synthesis method to produce different shapes/morphologies of the Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles to see if that impacts the photocatalytic performance. 

4. Incorporate the Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles into a composite material with other semiconductors or carbon materials to create hybrid photocatalysts. 

5. Evaluate the performance of the Ni-doped ZnO under visible light or solar irradiation rather than just UV to make it usable under real-world conditions.
