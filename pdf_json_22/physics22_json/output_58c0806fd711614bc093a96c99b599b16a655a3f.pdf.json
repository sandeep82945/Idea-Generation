(1) is performed on an equally-spaced grid with distance between two adjacent grid nodes denoted by h. At each node i, we define xi = ih, i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N , and ui = u(xi, t). The midpoints associated to the node i are defined as xi\u00b1 12 = xi \u00b1 h 2 , which indicate the cell interfaces across which the fluxes are evaluated.\nEvaluation of Eq. (1) at each node yields a system of ordinary differentiation equations, given in the form\nof dui(t)\ndt = Ri(u) = \u2212\n\u2202f(u)\n\u2202x |x=xi i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N. (10)\nwhere we define Ri(u) as the spacial operator.10\nA semi-discrete solution in the conservative finite difference form can be further obtained as\ndui(t)\ndt = \u2212 hi+1/2 \u2212 hi\u22121/2 h , (11)\nwhere the primitive function or the often so-called numerical flux function h(x, t) is implicitly defined by\nf(u) = 1\nh \u222b x+h/2 x\u2212h/2 h(\u03be, t)d\u03be. (12)\nIn the framework of weighted compact nonlinear schemes (WCNSs) [1], the flux hi+1/2 is numerically approximated using the linear combination of mid-point flux terms. The approximated flux, denoted by h\u0302i+1/2, is evaluated by\nh\u0302i+1/2 = 3\n640 f\u0302i\u2212 32 \u2212\n29\n480 f\u0302i\u2212 12 +\n1067\n960 f\u0302i+ 12 \u2212\n29\n480 f\u0302i+ 32 +\n3\n640 f\u0302i+ 52 , (13)\nand Taylor series expansion of h\u0302i+1/2 indicates that\nh\u0302i+1/2 = hi+1/2 +O ( h5 ) . (14)\nThe unknown mid-point flux terms on the right hand side of Eq. (13) are computed using numerical\nupwind flux functions, which are given in a generic form\nf\u0302i+ 12 = 1\n2\n[( f(uR,i+ 12 ) + f(uL,i+ 1 2 ) ) \u2212 |A\u0302i+ 12 | ( uR,i+ 12 \u2212 uL,i+ 12 )] , (15)\nwhere the high-order interpolated flow variables on the left- and right-hand sides of the mid-point xi+ 12 are denoted by the subscripts, L and R, respectively, and A\u0302i+ 12 denotes the approximate Jacobian matrix of the flux function with respect to the conservative variables, i.e., A\u0302i+ 12 \u2248 \u2202f \u2202u ( un i+ 12 ) .\nBefore proceeding to the section 2.3 for the detailed discussion of nonlinear interpolation of aforemen-\ntioned flow variables in Eq. (15), we first review the time marching algorithm used to integrate Eq. (10), since15\nit is the core building block of the numerical methods in the proposed work. Instead of using the traditional third-order strongly stable Runge\u2013Kutta method [2], we follow the work of Li and Du [3] on the two-stage fourth-order temporal accurate discretization scheme, which is developed based on the Lax-Wendroff method.\nThe basic idea in our reconstruction is to use only r stencils to reconstruct the point-wise values of\nsolutions and spatial derivatives for the 2r\u22121-order ADER scheme in one dimension, while in two dimensions,20\nthe dimension-by-dimension sub-cell reconstruction approach for spatial derivatives is employed\nThe hyperbolic conservation laws may develop discontinuities in its solution even if the initial conditions\nare smooth.\nAn important advantage or feature of the WCNS method is that the variable interpolation is performed\non the primitive/conservative/characteristic variables from the solution points to the ux points.25\n2.1. Two-stage fourth-order temporal accurate scheme\nGiven the flow state at time step n, the two-stage temporal scheme performed to integrate Eq. (10) to\nthe next time level n+ 1 is summarized as follows.\nStep 1. Define a vector of intermediate node values u n+ 12 i , which are calculated by\nu n+ 12 i = u n i \u2212 k\n2h\n[ h\u0302\u2217i+ 12 \u2212 h\u0302\u2217i\u2212 12 ]\nh\u0302\u2217i+ 12 = h\u0302ni+ 12\n+ k\n4\n( \u2202h\u0302\n\u2202t )n i+ 12\n. (16)\nwhere k is the time step size.\nStep 2. Advance the solution to the time state tn+1 = tn + k by\nun+1i = u n i \u2212\nk h [ h\u03024thi+ 12 \u2212 h\u03024thi\u2212 12 ]\nh\u03024thi+ 12 = h\u0302ni+ 12\n+ k\n6\n( \u2202h\u0302\n\u2202t )n i+ 12 + k 3 ( \u2202h\u0302 \u2202t )n+ 12 i+ 12 . (17)\nRemark 1. In Step 1, the flux h\u0302n i+ 12 can be readily determined from Eq. (13), and its derivative with30\nrespect to time is also approximated using Eq. (13), such that\n( \u2202h\u0302\n\u2202t )n i+ 12 = 3 640 ( \u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t )n i\u2212 32 \u2212 29 480 ( \u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t )n i\u2212 12 + 1067 960 ( \u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t )n i+ 12 \u2212 29 480 ( \u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t )n i+ 32 + 3 640 ( \u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t )n i+ 52 . (18)\nThe flux derivative (\n\u2202h\u0302 \u2202t )n+ 12 i+ 12 in Step 2 can be obtained in the same way but at the intermediate time level.\nWe discuss the evaluation of the variable (\n\u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t )n i+ 12 in the following subsection.\n2.2. Generalized Riemann problem solver\nWhile the flux term f\u0302i+ 12 can be computed by a general Riemann solver, for instance, the Rusanov scheme [4], or the low dissipation hybrid Rusanov-Roe scheme [5], the evaluation of (\n\u2202 f\u0302 \u2202t ) i+ 12 plays a key\nrole, which is conducted following the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure, such that( \u2202 f\u0302\n\u2202t ) i+ 12 = ( \u2202 f\u0302 \u2202u ( uni+ 12 ))(\u2202u \u2202t ) i+ 12 = A\u0302i+ 12 ( \u2202u \u2202t ) i+ 12 , (19)\nand the Generalized Riemann problem solver is used for the term ( \u2202u \u2202t ) i+ 12 , given by35\n( \u2202u\n\u2202t ) i+ 12 = \u2212A\u0302+ i+ 12 \u2206uL,i+ 12 \u2212 A\u0302 \u2212 i+ 12 \u2206uR,i+ 12 , (20)\nwhere the operator \u2206 denotes the spacial derivative, such that \u2206uL/R,i+ 12 = ( \u2202u \u2202x ) L/R,i+ 12\n. The matrix A\u0302i+ 12 can be diagonized in the form of\nA\u0302i+ 12 = R\u039bL, (21)\nwhere R, and L denotes the right and left eigenmatrix, respectively, and \u039b is the diagonal matrix consisting of eigenvalues \u03bbk. Then two unknown matrices in Eq. (20) are defined as\nA\u0302\u00b1 i+ 12 = R\u039b\u00b1L, (22)\nwhere \u039b+ consists of eigenvalues \u03bb+k = |\u03bbk|, and \u039b\u2212 of eigenvalues \u03bb \u2212 k = \u2212|\u03bbk|.\nAs aforementioned, we will focus on the high-order interpolation of flow variables uL/R,i+ 12 in section 2.3,\nand its first spacial derivative \u2206uL/R,i+ 12 in section 2.4.\n2.3. Nonlinear interpolation of flow variables based on the Hermite polynomial\nIn the proposed work we employ the Hermite polynomial instead of the Lagrangian approach for the40\nhigher-order approximation of the flow variables at the mid-point. The Hermite polynomial enjoys the advantage of its compact stencil, since it has been demonstrated that only half of the grid points are required to derive the polynomial of the same degree when compared to the Lagrangian approach.\nIn the following work, we mainly consider the evaluation of variables on the left-hand side of xi+ 12 , i.e.,\nun L,i+ 12 for the purpose of simplicity, and un R,i+ 12 is readily obtained from a symmetrical form of uL,i+ 12 . We45\nfurther drop the subscript L and the supscript n for the rest of the discussion, unless noted otherwise.\nAs shown in Fig. ??, given the node value ui, and its spatial derivative \u2206ui, only a three-point full stencil, which is denoted by Si+ 12 = {xi\u22121, xi, xi+1}, is necessary for the construction of a fourth-degree\nHermite polynomial p(x), such that ui+ 12 = p ( xi+ 12 ) . It can be determined by satisfying\np (xk) = uk, k = i\u2212 1, i, i+ 1, (23)\nThen we can obtain a fifth-order spacial accurate interpolation for ui+ 12 , which takes the form of ui+ 12 = p ( xi+ 12 ) = \u22121 8 ui\u22121 + 9 16 ui + 9 16 ui+1 \u2212 3h 64 (\u2206ui\u22121 + 3\u2206ui+1) . (24) On the other hand, the full stencil can be split into three sub-stencils, namely, Si+ 12 ,1 = {xi\u22121, xi} ,Si+ 12 ,2 =\n{xi, xi+1} , and Si+ 12 ,3 = {xi\u22121, xi, xi+1}. Over each sub-stencil a specific Hermite polynomial can be constructed, which is subject to the following condition\np1 (xk) = uk, k = i\u2212 1, i, \u2206p1 (xi\u22121) = \u2206ui\u22121 p2 (xk) = uk, k = i, i+ 1, \u2206p2 (xi+1) = \u2206ui+1 p3 (xk) = uk, k = i\u2212 1, i, i+ 1 , (25)\nrespectively. Once these three quadratic polynomials are determined, their corresponding interpolated mid-50\npoint flow variables are obtained as\nui+ 12 ,1 = p1 ( xi+ 12 ) = \u22125 4 ui\u22121 + 9 4 ui \u2212 3h 4 \u2206ui\u22121 ui+ 12 ,2 = p2 ( xi+ 12 ) = 1 4 ui + 3 4 ui+1 \u2212 h 4 \u2206ui+1 ui+ 12 ,3 = p3 ( xi+ 12 ) = \u22121 8 ui\u22121 + 3 4 ui + 3 8 ui+1 . (26)\nLinear combination of ui+ 12 ,k yields\nui+ 12 = 3\u2211 k=1 dkui+ 12 ,k, (27)\nwhere dks denote the linear weight, having values d1 = 1/16, d2 = 9/16, and d3 = 3/8, respectively.\nThe interpolations in Eq. (26) can also be expressed in a generic form using (approximated) n th derivatives\n(n = 1, 2) in space, which are derived from the Taylor series, given by\nui+ 12 ,k = ui + u (1) i,k\nh 2 + u (2) i,k\nh2\n8 , k = 1, 2, 3, (28)\nwhere the first- and second-order derivatives are approximated by\nu (1) i,0 =\n1 h (\u22122ui\u22121 + 2ui \u2212 h\u2206ui\u22121) ,\nu (1) i,1 =\n1 h (\u22122ui + 2ui+1 \u2212 h\u2206ui+1) ,\nu (1) i,2 =\n1\n2h (\u2212ui\u22121 + ui+1) ,\n(29)\nand\nu (2) i,0 =\n1\nh2 (\u22122ui\u22121 + 2ui \u2212 2h\u2206ui\u22121) ,\nu (2) i,1 =\n1\nh2 (2ui \u2212 2ui+1 + 2h\u2206ui+1) ,\nu (2) i,2 =\n1\nh2 (ui\u22121 \u2212 2ui + ui+1) ,\n(30)\nrespectively. The smooth indicator, \u03b2k, is defined as [1]\n\u03b2k = ( hu (1) i,k )2 + ( h2u (2) i,k )2 , k = 1, 2, 3 . (31)\nNonlinear weight, \u03c9k, is used to replace the linear weight, dk, in Eq. (27) in order to alleviate non-physical oscillations when any sub-stencil is deemed crossed by a discontinuity. For instance, the nonlinear weight of Jiang and Shu [6] can be used\n\u03c9k = \u03b1k\u22112 k=0 \u03b1k , \u03b1k = dk (\u03b2k + )2 , (32)\nwhere the small parameter = 10\u22126 is used to prevent division by zero. It suggests that the corresponding JS weight can adaptively approach 0 for a substencil crossed by discontinuities, thus diminishing possible numerical oscillations, and continuously approximate the optimal linear weight in smooth regions, therefore55\nachieving high-order accuracy.\n2.4. Nonlinear interpolation of the first spacial derivative of the flow variables\nAs shown in Eq. (20), the GRP solver requires the solution of the first spacial derivative in advance, which is the major focus of this section. Although a set of Hermite polynomials for the flow variables over the full stencil and the three sub-stencils have already been determined in the previous section, we do not recommend to simply differentiate them with respect to space and use the resulting solutions for the derivation of the first spacial derivatives involved; since it leads into one-order of accuracy loss in space, and even more concerning is that the convex combination strategy from the WENO concept cannot be used. A remedy is to construct a new set of Hermite polynomials for the computation of the first spacial derivative [7, 8]. First of all, a fifth-degree Hermite polynomial p(x) over the same three-point full stencil, Si+ 12 = {xi\u22121, xi, xi+1}, is required to construct. It can be formulated by satisfying the particular conditions\np (xk) = uk, k = i\u2212 1, i, i+ 1, \u2206p (xl) = \u2206ul, l = i\u2212 1, i, i+ 1. (33)\nThen a fifth-order spacial accurate interpolation for \u2206ui+ 12 can be obtained\n\u2206ui+ 12 = \u2206p ( xi+ 12 ) = 1\nh\n( 3\n64 ui\u22121 \u2212\n3 2 ui + 93 64 ui+1\n) + 1\n64 (\u2206ui\u22121 \u2212 12\u2206ui \u2212 15\u2206ui+1) . (34)\nOver each of the three sub-stencils, namely, Si+ 12 ,1 = {xi\u22121, xi} ,Si+ 12 ,2 = {xi, xi+1} , and Si+ 12 ,3 = {xi\u22121, xi, xi+1}, a specific Hermite polynomial of third degree can be constructed, which is subject to the\nfollowing condition\np1 (xk) = uk, \u2206p1 (xk) = \u2206uk, k = i\u2212 1, i, p2 (xk) = uk, \u2206p2 (xk) = \u2206uk, k = i, i+ 1, p3 (xk) = uk, k = i\u2212 1, i, i+ 1, \u2206p3 (xi) = \u2206ui,\n(35)\nrespectively. The first spacial derivatives at the mid-point can be obtained thereafter\n\u2206ui+ 12 ,1 = \u2206p1 ( xi+ 12 ) = 9 2h (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui) + 7 4 \u2206ui\u22121 + 15 4 \u2206ui. \u2206ui+ 12 ,2 = \u2206p2 ( xi+ 12 ) = 3 2h (\u2212ui + ui+1)\u2212 1 4 \u2206ui \u2212 1 4 \u2206ui+1. \u2206ui+ 12 ,3 = \u2206p3 ( xi+ 12 ) = 1 8h (ui\u22121 \u2212 8ui + 7ui+1) + 1 4 \u2206ui.\n(36)\nAs is the case for ui+ 12 ,k in Eq. (27), a convex combination can also be found for \u2206ui+ 1 2 ,k , such that\n\u2206ui+ 12 = 3\u2211\nk=1\nd\u0304k \u2206ui+ 12 ,k, (37)\nwhere the linear weight d\u0304k is given by d\u03041 = 1/112, d\u03042 = 15/16, and d\u03043 = 3/56, respectively.\nThe interpolations in Eq. (26) can also be expressed in a generic form using (approximated) n th derivatives\n(n = 2, 3), given by\n\u2206ui+ 12 ,k = \u2206ui + u (2) i,k\nh 2 + u (3) i,k\nh2\n8 , k = 1, 2, 3, (38)\nwhere the second- and third-order derivatives are approximated by\nu (2) i,0 =\n1\nh2 (6ui\u22121 \u2212 6ui + 2h\u2206ui\u22121 + 4h\u2206ui) ,\nu (2) i,1 =\n1\nh2 (\u22126ui + 6ui+1 \u2212 4h\u2206ui \u2212 2h\u2206ui+1) ,\nu (2) i,2 =\n1\nh2 (ui\u22121 \u2212 2ui + ui+1) ,\n(39)\nand\nu (3) i,0 =\n1\nh3 (12ui\u22121 \u2212 12ui + 6h\u2206ui\u22121 + 6h\u2206ui) ,\nu (3) i,1 =\n1\nh3 (12ui \u2212 12ui+1 + 6h\u2206ui + 6h\u2206ui+1) ,\nu (3) i,2 =\n1\nh3 (\u22123ui\u22121 + 3ui+1 \u2212 6h\u2206ui) ,\n(40)\nrespectively. The smooth indicator, \u03b2k, is defined as\n\u03b2\u0304k = ( h2u (2) i,k )2 + ( h3u (3) i,k )2 , k = 1, 2, 3 . (41)\nThe nonlinear weight of Jiang and Shu [6] are also used in this case, taking the form of\n\u03c9\u0304k = \u03b1k\u22112 k=0 \u03b1k , \u03b1k = dk (\u03b2k + )2 , (42)\nwhere the small parameter = 10\u22126 is used to prevent division by zero.60\n\u2206ui+ 12 = 1 16h (3ui\u22121 \u2212 24ui + 21ui+1 + h\u2206ui\u22121 \u2212 3h\u2206ui+1) , (43)\nfor the the full stencil, and\n\u2206ui+ 12 ,1 = 1 h (\u22123ui\u22121 + 3ui \u2212 2h\u2206ui\u22121) \u2206ui+ 12 ,2 = 1 h (\u2212ui + ui+1) \u2206ui+ 12 ,3 = 1 h (\u2212ui + ui+1) . (44)\n3. Numerical results\n3.1. Sod and Lax shock tube problems\nRiemann initial-value problems of Sod [9] and Lax [10] are used to further evaluate shock-capturing\ncapability of the proposed schemes employing discretization of the 1-D Euler equations\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t + \u2202 ( \u03c1u ) \u2202x = 0 ,\n\u2202 ( \u03c1u ) \u2202t + \u2202 ( \u03c1u2 ) \u2202x = \u2212\u2202p \u2202x ,\n\u2202E \u2202t + \u2202 ( uE ) \u2202x = \u2212 \u2202 ( u p ) \u2202x ,\nwhere E = e+ 12u 2 is the total energy per unit mass, and e is internal energy. The dependent variables are65\nrelated through the perfect gas equation of state given by p = (\u03b3\u2212 1)\u03c1e with \u03b3 = 1.4, thus closing the Euler equations system.\nThe Sod shock tube problem involves a right-moving shock of Mach number 1.7, while for the Lax shock\ntube problem, the right-moving shock has Mach number 2.0. Initial conditions for the Sod problem are\n(\u03c1, u, p) =  (1, 0, 1) x \u2208 [0, 0.5],(0.125, 0, 0.1) x \u2208 (0.5, 1] , (45) and the results at t = 0.2 are given by solving the problem on an evenly-distributed grid of N = 101 points.\nInitial conditions for the Lax shock-tube problem are\n(\u03c1, u, p) = (0.445, 0.698, 3.528) x \u2208 [0, 0.5],(0.5, 0, 0.571) x \u2208 (0.5, 1] . (46) This case is also simulated on an evenly distributed grid of N = 101 points, and the results at t = 0.14 are\nshown in Fig. 2 for density and velocity distributions.70\n3.2. Osher Shu\n3.3. Two-dimensional Riemann problems\n3.3.1. Configuration 6\nThe equations of motion are the same as those used for configuration 3, the 2-D Euler equations, but\nnow with initial conditions given by\n(\u03c1, u, v, p) =  (1, 0.75,\u22120.5, 1) (x, y) \u2208 [ 1 2 , 1 ] \u00d7 [ 1 2 , 1 ] , (2, 0.75, 0.5, 1) (x, y) \u2208 [ 0, 12 ) \u00d7 [ 1 2 , 1 ] , (1,\u22120.75, 0.5, 1) (x, y) \u2208 [ 0, 12 ) \u00d7 [ 0, 12 ) , (3,\u22120.75,\u22120.5, 1) (x, y) \u2208 [ 1 2 , 1 ] \u00d7 [ 0, 12 ) .\n(47)\nBoundary conditions are the same as in the preceding test case.\nAcknowledgments75\nThis work is supported by the open fund from the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics (Grant No. SKLA20180302), and the third author is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11872144).\n4.
