A comparison of the important molecular properties of SeU with its oxygen (urea, U) and sulfur (thiourea, TU) analogs is shown in Fig. 1D.

These properties of SeU could be advantageous in excited state electron transfer reactions.\nElectron transfer (ET) plays many crucial roles in chemical and biological processes.14\u201316 Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) is one type of ET process driven by light energy. PET occurs naturally in biological systems in sunlight, i.e., photosynthesis.17,18 Over the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made to improve and rene the PET process and implement it in various applications. Many studies and thorough investigations elucidated that PET can be articially constructed between the uorophore and a quencher for application in solar cells,19\u201321 biosensors,22 organic synthesis,23 and models for monitoring biomolecule structural dynamics. Among these applications, developing biocompatible small organic molecules as uorescence quenching probes for\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It also helps to study biomolecules at a single molecular level, imaging their interactions in vivo and in vitro. Among several photophysical processes, uorescence quenching is a widely studied phenomenon as it gives valuable information on biomolecular association, structure, and functions of biomolecules. The uorescence quenching can happen through several processes, such as uorescence resonance energy transfer,31 the Dexter\nChem.

Thioamides have already been developed as efficient uorescence quenching probes, which can be used as an alternative to conventional quenchers for monitoring protein structure and dynamics in a distance-dependent manner.35,37 It has also been reported that thioamides quench the uorescence of intrinsic chromophores and several uorophores through FRET and PET processes.35\u201337,46\u201348 The reduced HOMO\u2013LUMO gap and oxidation potential are the major players in designing FRET and PET donor\u2013acceptor pairs. However, monitoring PET has several advantages over FRET as it does not require spectral overlap and is not restricted to certain spectral windows. PET is mostly governed by redox mechanisms.49\nEven though thioamides have been proven to be efficient quenching probes for PET, not much work has been devoted to exploring selenoamide and telluoroamides as alternative probes. It is well explored that down the chalcogen group, heavier analogs such as selenoamide and telluoroamides are useful in synthetic transformation, preparation of relevant peptides, and heterocyclic drugs.50 The oxidation potentials and HOMO\u2013LUMO gap further decrease with selenium substitution and the obtained selenoamide can be used as a better uorescence quenching probe without affecting the molecular size of the probe.51,52 Selenium is also introduced into crystals of proteins and nucleic acids by soaking with SeU and can be a convenient vehicle for solving phase correction problems.54,55 Fig. 1E shows the binding sites of SeU in a cyan-uorescent protein where the tryptophan-based chromophore serves as the intrinsic uorophore. Fig. 1F displays the SeU-bound lysozyme protein docked with rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) and used as an extrinsic uorophore. The priorly existence of SeU in biological systems may construct uorophore quencher pairs and be involved in uorescence quenching processes, which necessitates a deeper understanding of the mechanism. In the present study, SeU has been chosen as the model SeU-based compound as it is structurally simple, moderately stable, and can be considered a selenoamide analog. SeU can participate in FRET and PET, but this work focuses on uorescence quenching through the PET mechanism; the reasons are mentioned above. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of using SeU or any selenoamides as PET quenching probes, which persuaded us to explore their uorescence quenching efficiency. We have chosen Rh6G as the representative uorophore to investigate the PET reaction with SeU. In addition, the quenching efficiency of SeU was further explored with other biologically important uorophores and a covalently bound protein\u2013dye conjugate. We also investigated the respective oxygen and sulfur analogs, i.e., U and TU, as quenchers for comparison purposes. The free energy change (DGET) and HUMO\u2013LUMO gap (DE) were used as the descriptors of PET to\n14202 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 14200\u201314210\nquantify the ET feasibility.

            "text": "The Marcus model is one of the nest models used to understand the underlying principles of electron transfer reactions in solutions.56 For a weakly coupled donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A) system, the rate of a biomolecular ET (KET) reaction depends on (i) the free energy change of the reaction (DG\u00b0); (ii) the reorganization energy (l); (iii) the electronic coupling between D\u2013A (Hel). According to the Marcus theory,56 the KET has a quadratic dependency on DG\u00b0 and can be expressed as following eqn (1):\nKET \u00bc 2pHel 2 \u0127 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4plkBT p exp DG \u00fe l2 4plkBT\n! (1)\nFurther, the DG\u00b0 of an ET reaction can be obtained experimentally using the Rehm\u2013Weller model57 as following eqn (2):\nDGET = F{Eox(D) \u2212 Ered(A)} \u2212 E0\u20130 + Cw (2)\nhere F is the Faraday constant, Eox and Ered are the oxidation and reduction potentials of electron donor and acceptor molecules, respectively. E0\u20130 is the zero vibrational excitation energy for the uorophore, and C is the coulombic interaction term negligible when the solvent is water. The uorophores can act as electron donors and electron acceptors in bimolecular ET reactions depending upon the quencher's redox ability. When the uorophore accepts an electron, it is called the reductive or acceptor PET process, and when the uorophore donates an electron, it is called the oxidative or donor PET process. Eqn (1) uses DG\u00b0 as a descriptor of the PET process. In general, DGET < 0 activates PET, and the reaction becomes more effective with more negative DGET. However, many studies have suggested the observation of the Marcus inverted region in which the more negative DGET does not always increase ET.58\u201362 The Marcus theory predicts the kinetics of an ET reaction using DGET as a descriptor, whereas other important parameters, such as Hel of the D\u2013A pair, could provide valuable information. Hel depends upon the D\u2013A orientation and the difference in the HOMO energy level (DE) of the D\u2013A pair. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of using DE as a descriptor to explain the PET ON and OFF mechanism.63,64 The authors reported that a cut-off value of DE <\u223c0.6 eV substantially activates PET whereas DE > \u223c0.6 eV inhibits PET and is applicable to a wide variety of uorophores.\nThe above-discussed factors affecting the PET process guided us in interpreting the feasibility of the electron transfer reaction. Initially, we determined the energy gaps (DE) between the HOMO energy levels of Rh6G and the studied quenchers. The computed results showed that the DE between the HOMO energy level of the Rh6G\u2013quencher pair decreases with sulfur and selenium substitution (Fig. 2).

The HOMOs of urea, thiourea, and selenourea are displayed in Fig. 2. It shows more diffused and labile lone pair of electrons of sulfur and selenium which are more localized at the respective atomic site. The situation is different in the case of the oxygen atom due to its higher electronegativity. Furthermore, we calculated the change in Gibb\u2019s free energy (DGET) for the electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor molecule (Fig. 2). To calculate DGET, previously reported electrochemical properties, i.e., the reduction potential of Rh6G (Ered = \u22120.95 eV vs. SCE), the oxidation potential of quenchers (Eox (urea) = 3.1 eV vs. SCE,53 Eox (thiourea) = 1.07 eV vs. SCE,53 Eox (selenourea) = 0.5 eV vs. SCE),52 and the zero\u2013zero electronic excitation energy of Rh6G (E0\u20130 = 2.28 eV), were considered. The analysis of eqn (2) provides a large positive DGET = 1.77 eV along with a high energy gap (DE = 1.69 eV) for the Rh6G\u2013U pair, ruling out the possibility of the PET process. In sharp contrast, DGET = \u22120.25 eV with reduced DE = 0.41 eV for the Rh6G\u2013TU pair raises the possibility of PET. It is in line with several previous studies that demonstrated thioamides as efficient uorescent quenchers for a wide range of uorophores.35 Interestingly, a signicant reduction in the DGET = \u22120.83 eV and DE = 0.07 eV for the Rh6G\u2013SeU pair provides clear evidence of the pronounced PET from the SeU to Rh6G molecule.

We also performed the uorescence titration experiments of the equimolar solution of the uorophore in the presence of 60 mM urea and thiourea as control. In the case of thiourea, moderate quenching was observed, while no quenching was noticed upon the addition of urea (Fig. 3A and S2\u2020). This observation supported the earlier reports on thioamide quenching of uorescent probes through photoinduced electron transfer (PET).35 We further estimated the quenching efficiency (EQ) for TU and SeU at the emission maximum of Rh6G from the recorded steady-state (SS) uorescence data (eqn (S1)\u2020). A comparison of EQ(SS) for TU and SeU shows that TU quenches the uorescence of Rh6G by 34%, whereas SeU quenches with an efficiency of 74%.

The drastic decrease in the Rh6G uorescence in the presence of SeU compared to its thio analog needs a detailed analysis to unravel the quenching mechanism.\nWe performed time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments to decipher the exact nature of quenching and whether the observed phenomenon is due to static or dynamic processes. Fig. 3B and E represent the uorescence lifetime decay curves for Rh6G in the absence and presence of quenchers (TU and SeU respectively). To our surprise, we noticed the presence of an ultrafast decay component during the time-resolved uorescence quenching experiments. The contribution of this short component to the uorescence quenching of Rh6G is much less for TU and quite signicant in the case of SeU. The contribution of this fast component becomes more prominent as the quencher concentration increases. The occurrence of such a feature may arise from the interference by the lamp prole of the diode laser during titration experiments. Another possibility for the appearance of a fast component could be PET, which takes place in the ultrafast timescale. The observed ultrafast component falls within the instrument response function temporal prole, and its assignment to a true PET process is inconclusive. Thus the observed decay proles were tted single exponentially. However, the signicance of the presence of an ultrafast component in PET reactions has been discussed in the later part.\nThe uorescence lifetime of Rh6G was found to be 3.93 ns. Upon the addition of 60 mM TU, the lifetime decreased to 2.6\n14204 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 14200\u201314210\nns, corresponding to an EQ(s) of 33% (Fig. 3B and eqn (S2)\u2020). The concentration-dependent lifetime measurement helped us to generate a linear Stern\u2013Volmer (S\u2013V) plot with a Stern\u2013 Volmer constant (KSV) of 8.49 M\n\u22121 (Fig. 3C and eqn (S3)\u2020). We also calculated a near-identical KSV of 9.7 M\n\u22121 from the steadystate measurements. The KSV value obtained from the steadystate measurements was greater than that obtained under identical conditions from time-resolved measurements. Therefore, we used eqn (S4)\u2020 to t the steady-state Stern\u2013Volmer data accounting for both static (KS) and dynamic (KD) quenching contributions. The tting gave rise to KD = 8.62 M\n\u22121 and KS = 0.81 M\u22121. The comparable KD values explain the purely dynamic nature of the observed quenching for the Rh6G\u2013TU pair. On the other hand, the constructed Stern\u2013Volmer curve from steadystate measurements for the Rh6G\u2013SeU uorophore quencher pair showed an upward behavior. Interestingly, the dynamics seemed different when we performed the lifetime measurements for the Rh6G\u2013SeU pair. Upon the addition of SeU gradually up to 60 mM concentration, the lifetime of Rh6G decreased from 3.93 ns to 1.69 ns (Fig. 3E).

It was noticed that the concentrationdependent quenching of Rh6G by SeU could not be explained using the combined static and dynamic S\u2013V equation. The linear behavior of the curve is attributed to its dynamic nature. In contrast, the curved positive deviation is from the static process, which can occur via a non-uorescent ground-state or sphere of action complex formation. We did not observe any changes in the absorption spectra of Rh6G aer adding SeU, which conrmed no ground state complex formation (Fig. S3\u2020). Thus the sphere of action model was adopted to t the curve. The sphere of action model has been routinely used to describe the PET mechanism of organic molecules and uorescent nanomaterials.65,66 According to this model, the uorophore and the quencher do not form a ground-state complex. Instead, a false static process occurs as the quencher is present near the uorophore at the instant of excitation, leading to immediate uorophore quenching. The data t a modied S\u2013V equation that describes the sphere of action model (eqn (S5)\u2020).\nFig. 4 SeU quenching of Rh6G in PBS.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nAt a sphere volume of 6 M\u22121, a linear S\u2013V curve (Fig. 4A) for F0/F vs. [Q] was obtained. It matches pretty well with the s0/s vs. [Q] curve. The calculated volume in which the Rh6G and SeU are present at the moment of excitation can be treated as the contribution from the static process. Considering a sphere of volume 6 M\u22121, the radius of the sphere was determined to be 13.4 \u00c5. The calculated molecular van der Waals radius for Rh6G and SeU is 7.78 \u00c5 and 3.42 \u00c5, conrming that the uorophore\u2013 quencher pair can present and diffuse inside the sphere. Close association within the sphere may result in apparent static quenching and lead to a positive deviation from the linearity. We also calculated the collisional quenching constant KSV, which is 21.7 M\u22121. The higher collisional quenching constant (KSV = 21.7 M\n\u22121) value compared to the static quenching constant of 6 M\u22121 indicates the predominantly dynamic nature of the quenching.\nTemperature-dependent studies and quenching rate determination. Temperature-dependent TCSPC experiments further supported the dynamic nature of the quenching.

The increase in the temperature signicantly enhanced the KSV value for Rh6G\u2013TU and Rh6G\u2013SeU complexes. It further conrmed the predominantly dynamic nature of the PET process (Fig. S6\u2020). Moreover, a higher KSV value in the case of the Rh6G\u2013SeU pair supports the efficient quenching process. Additionally, the temperature-dependent steady-state experiments show that, at 60 \u00b0C, the contribution of the static quenching constant reduced from 6 M\u22121 to 4 M\u22121 (Fig. 4B). One would expect this as the weak association between the uorophore and quencher pair breaks at higher temperatures. It again conrmed the presence of a small static contribution in the total quenching. We also calculated the quenching rate constant (KQ) to be 7.05\u00d7 10\n9 M\u22121 S\u22121 for the Rh6G\u2013SeU pair (eqn (S6)\u2020). Considering the uorophore and quenchers as hard spheres with radii Rf and Rq, respectively, the bimolecular quenching rate constant (K2) can be obtained using eqn (S7).\u2020\nFig. 5 (A) Steady-state emission spectra of studied fluorophores in th fluorescence intensity of fluorophores and the dashed lines represent t C102: Coumarin 102, FLU: fluorescein free acid, Rh6G: rhodamine 6G, T Kitton Red, Rh640: rhodamine 640, T-Red: Texas Red.

The experimentally obtained and theoretically predicted quenching rate constant shows that the electron transfer process is diffusion-controlled. As a control, we carried out the above analysis for TU. The identical linear S\u2013V curve with a near equal KSV value in the steady-state and lifetime experiments indicates the purely dynamic nature of the PET process. Temperature-dependent lifetime measurements assist the collisional behavior. The bimolecular quenching constant value also suggests the diffusion-controlled PET process for the Rh6G\u2013TU pair. In general, the collisional frequency (fQ) speculates the quenching efficiency of a uorophore\u2013quencher pair. It provides information regarding the accessibility of Rh6G to the TU and SeU quenchers. The obtained fQ value revealed a nearly three-fold enhancement in the case of SeU (fQ = 0.84) than TU (fQ = 0.29) (eqn (S8)\u2020). Thus, a sulfur atom replacement by selenium in the urea moiety remarkably altered the quenching efficiency and mechanism.

Such sphere of action as a consequence of apparent static quenching results in near unity quenching and results in ultrafast electron transfer.\nFemtosecond uorescence upconversion (FUC) study. The apparent static process arises due to the close association of Rh6G and SeU inside the sphere, leading to a high quenching. The bimolecular quenching rate constant values are close to the upper limit of the diffusion-controlled quenching process (\u223c1 \u00d7 1010 M\u22121 S\u22121). As the observed dynamic PET process is diffusion-controlled, it is tough to track the presence of ultrafast electron transfer processes using the TCSPC technique with an instrumental response function (IRF) of \u223c85 ps. The diffusioncontrolled PET reaction can be understood as an initial slow diffusion between the uorophore and quencher followed by an ultrafast intrinsic photo-induced electron transfer process. The intrinsic PET occurs within a few picosecond time scale as a result of complex formation between them. The assignment of the observed fast component in the TCSPC experiment to intrinsic PET is not satisfactory due to IRF limitations. However, several reports conrm the intrinsic PET process through femtosecond experiments.21,67,68\nTo achieve this, we used a femtosecond FUC technique with a time resolution better than \u223c300 fs. The uorescence upconversion experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C for Rh6G\u2013\nFig. 6 (A) Schematic demonstration of PET-driven fluorescence quenc protein in the presence of SeU.

The decay traces at emission maximum \u223c550 nm of Rh6G for the 400 nm excitation wavelength was rst recorded. Although Rh6G has low absorbance at 400 nm, the pre-aligned laser setup gave us an appreciable signal-to-noise ratio. For Rh6G, a single exponential tting gave a lifetime value of 3.98 ns, nearly identical to the lifetime value obtained from TCSPC measurement. Fig. 4C and D depict the normalized femtosecond transients of Rh6G in the absence and presence of 60 mM TU and SeU. Interestingly, we observed a drastic reduction in the initial part of the normalized femtosecond transients for the Rh6G in the presence of 60 mM SeU (Fig. 4D). The decay curve was tted to a biexponential, which gave rise to two components, suggesting two lifetimes. An ultrafast component of 10 ps, which further decays radiatively with a lifetime of 1.55 ns, was noticed. The slow component is very similar to the lifetime observed from TCSPC measurements. We did not observe any signicant changes in the decay curve up to 200 ps in the presence of TU. However, the contribution of the 10 ps lifetime component is very negligible. We observed changes in the later part of the decay curve (Fig. S7\u2020). The tting gave a lifetime of 2.7 ns, which matches quite well with our TCSPC data.\nThe diffusion-controlled PET process with near unity quenching generally occurs in a few tens of ps.21 The presence of an ultrafast component of 10 ps can be assigned to the intrinsic PET process. Such a situation arises when the uorophore and\nhing in a TMR-5-maleimide bound lysozyme (Lys@TMR-5-maleimide) correlation function of free TMR-5-maleimide with Lys@TMR-5-mal.

Our sphere of action model suggests apparent static quenching where there is a higher probability of the presence of Rh6G and SeU within the sphere. Such conditions may result in less diffusion and instantaneous electron transfer upon electronic excitation. The proposed quenching model supports this nding, whereas the absence of any such scenario in the case of TU could be the reason for the absence of any ultrafast processes. The femtosecond FUC experiment helped to detect the ultrafast component responsible for intrinsic PET.\nSelenourea as a universal uorescence quencher. Aer understanding the quenching mechanism in detail, we explored the efficacy of SeU in quenching various uorophores. The uorescence quenching experiments were performed for a wide range of uorophores chosen based on their different redox abilities and lifetimes accessing a wide spectral window. Fig. 5A displays the steady-state uorescence quenching studies of selected uorophores in the presence of SeU. Similar studies have also been performed for TU for comparison purposes. The results are summarised in Table S3 and Fig. S8\u2013S13.\u2020 Fig. 5B displays the change in the uorescence lifetime of the studied uorophores in the presence of quenchers. To our delight, irrespective of the different properties of uorophores, we observed signicant quenching in SeU for all the uorophores displaying its potential as an efficient quenching probe. Further, the total quenching efficiency was decomposed into its static and dynamic contributions. As displayed in Fig. 5C, one can see that there is a small contribution of static quenching to the total quenching for all uorophore\u2013SeU pairs. This is due to an apparent static process, as discussed in the case of Rh6G.\nLysozyme labeling and quenching experiments. We extended our investigations to scrutinize whether SeU can be an effective probe for monitoring protein dynamics. The uorescence quenching efficiency of SeU was quantied by labeling lysozyme protein with the tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-5maleimide dye (Fig. 6A). The labeling was carried out using the reported protocol.69,70 TMR-maleimide is a thiol-reactive dye that yields pH-sensitive photostable uorescent covalently bound conjugates with the cysteine groups in lysozymes. More details of the labeling procedure are provided in the ESI.\u2020 The steady-state absorption study conrms that the protein-toligand binding ratio is one. Further binding was conrmed from uorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and timeresolved TCSPC experiments. The FCS study reveals almost ve to six-fold enhancement in the diffusion time in the case of TMR-maleimide labeled lysozymes compared to the free uorophore (Fig. 6B and S14\u2020). Moreover, the uorescence lifetime of free TMR-5-maleimide was found to be 2.16 ns, whereas the lifetime of the labeled TMR-maleimide consists of one shortlived component s1 = 250 ps (8% by amplitude) and one long component s1 = 2.47 ns (92% by amplitude) (Fig. 6C). The appearance of a short-lived component in the labeled form can be attributed to the interaction of TMR-maleimide with the nearby amino acids. SeU was found to be efficient in quenching the uorescence of free and labeled TMR-5-aleimide compared to its thio analog (Fig. 6D, E and S15\u2013S16\u2020).\n14208 | Chem.

            "text": "In summary, we proposed selenourea (SeU) as an efficient uorescence quenching probe for the rst time. The uorescence quenching of the model Rh6G\u2013SeU pair was explained through a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism. We found that SeU signicantly enhances the quenching efficiency compared to its sulfur analog i.e. thiourea (TU). It was also observed that the quenching mechanism in the case of Rh6G\u2013 TU could be explained using the modied Stern\u2013Volmer model. In sharp contrast, the quenching sphere of action model was needed to explain the quenching mechanism of the Rh6G\u2013SeU pair. Temperature-dependent studies conrmed the predominantly dynamic nature of the PET process for the studied complexes. As per the sphere of action model, the close association between SeU and Rh6G leads to an ultrafast intrinsic electron transfer process of 10 ps, which was further conrmed using femtosecond uorescence upconversion experiments. The utility of SeU as an efficient uorescence probe was examined by considering several important uorophores with different photophysical properties that are regularly used for imaging and single molecule uorescence correlation spectroscopy of biomolecules. The lysozyme labeling experiments showed the potentiality of SeU as a uorescent quencher, even for the covalently bound uorophore. The site-specic incorporation of SeU inside the protein or selenium substitution of oxo-amides could further be exploited to monitor protein dynamics in a distance-dependent manner. Recent reports suggest that the use of selenium in proteins and biomedical applications is gaining importance.71,72 This fundamental nding will also be useful for researchers while interpreting the uorescence properties of biomolecules containing selenoamides. The present work elucidates that SeU can be used as an efficient minimalistic quenching probe to monitor protein structure and dynamics, an avenue that needs to be explored in detail."
