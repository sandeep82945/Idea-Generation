    "abstractText": "Introduction: Women Veterans experience a broad range of stressors (e.g., family, relationship, and financial) and high rates of mental health and physical health conditions, all of which contribute to high levels of stress. Personalized Support for Progress (PSP), an evidence-based intervention, is well suited to support women Veterans with high stress as it involves a card-sort task to prioritize concerns as well as pragmatic and emotional support to develop and implement a personalized plan addressing those concerns. Our aims were to explore the population and context for delivery and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of PSP delivered by a peer specialist to complement existing services in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Women\u2019s Wellness Center. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled pilot trial compared treatment as usual plus PSP to treatment as usual and used the a priori Go/No-Go criteria to establish success for each outcome. We interviewed staff regarding the population and delivery context at a VHA Women\u2019s Wellness Center and analyzed interviews using a rapid qualitative approach. For the rapid qualitative analysis, we created templated summaries of each interview to identify key concepts within each a priori theme, reviewed each theme\u2019s content across all interviews, and finally reviewed key concepts across themes. We evaluated feasibility using recruitment and retention rates; acceptability via Veteran satisfaction, working relationship with the peer, and staff satisfaction; and utility based on the proportion of Veterans who experienced a large change in outcomes (e.g., stress, mental health symptoms, and quality of life). The Syracuse VA Human Subjects Institutional Review Board approved all procedures. Results: Staff interviews highlight that women Veterans have numerous unmet social needs and concerns common among women which increase the complexity of their care; call for a supportive, consistent, trusting relationship with someone on their health care team; and require many resources (e.g., staff such as social workers, services such as legal support, and physical items such as diapers) to support their needs (some of which are available within VHA but may need support for staffing or access, and some of which are unavailable). Feasibility outcomes suggest a need to modify PSP and research methods to enhance intervention and assessment retention before the larger trial; the recruitment rate was acceptable by the end of the trial. Veteran acceptability of PSP was high. Veteran outcomes demonstrate promise for utility to improve stress, mental health symptoms, and quality of life for women Veterans. Conclusions: Given the high acceptability and promising outcomes for utility, changes to the design to enhance the feasibility outcomes which failed to meet the a priori Go/No-Go criteria are warranted. These outcomes support future trials of PSP within VHA Women\u2019s Wellness Centers. *VA Center for Integrated Healthcare, Syracuse VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA \u2020Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA \u2021Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA \u00a7Women\u2019s Wellness Center, Syracuse VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA Department of Family Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA \u00b6Susan B.

Women Veterans experience high stress.1,2 Specifically, women Veterans have higher perceived stress (i.e., the perception that their lives are unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded) than the general population of U.S. women (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS] scores were 1.2 SDs higher The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position or policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the U.S. Government. doi:https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac164 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2022.

Peers are Veterans in recovery from a behavioral health concern with specialized training to support other Veterans.8 Peers working in PACT teams are well positioned to provide navigation and social support for broad, non-diagnostic concerns such as stress compared to clinical providers who largely address medical or psychiatric diagnostic concerns and social workers who address identified social needs. Despite the existence of VHA standards for gendertailored interdisciplinary care, women Veterans have poor perceptions of VHA health care and report gender-specific barriers to care.9 A study evaluating women Veterans\u2019 rationale for using VHA care identified problems with patient\u2013 provider relationships, organizational and logistic barriers, and problems with Veteran benefits as reasons they discontinued VHA care.10 Gender-tailored services, comprehensive care, and positive patient\u2013provider experiences were reasons Veterans retained care.10 Power asymmetries in the patient\u2013provider relationship can make it difficult for patients to address their priorities.11,12 Peers\u2019 identity and experiential knowledge reduce power asymmetries, inform patient navigation, and allow them to facilitate positive supportive relationships with the health care team.13 Personalized Support for Progress (PSP) is a patientcentered lay-delivered intervention co-created with patients.14,15 PSP uses a prioritization tool to help patients identify their priorities, supports personalized planning, and provides emotional and pragmatic support.14,15 Non-Veteran women with depression and unmet social needs in an obstetrics and gynecology practice who received PSP demonstrated high satisfaction and reductions in depression compared to those who received tailored referrals.14 Based on our clinical experiences with women Veterans and the literature about women Veterans\u2019 needs and barriers to care, PSP was translated to VHA. The PSP prioritization tool is well suited for the competing demands16 that contribute to stress. Furthermore, the social and pragmatic support fit well with peers\u2019 role17 and was ideally suited to address women Veterans\u2019 stressors. Thus, we hypothesized PSP delivered by a peer would meet the needs of Veterans in a VHA Women\u2019s Wellness Center with high stress. OBJECTIVES Our objective was to conduct a pilot trial of peer-delivered PSP with women Veterans with high perceived stress in a VHA Women\u2019s Wellness Center. The primary aim was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of PSP with women Veterans by conducting a small-scale trial based on a larger future trial\u2019s potential design.18 An secondary aim focused on feasibility was to understand the delivery context, specifically staff perceptions of (1) the care needs of women Veterans with unmet social needs and the barriers and facilitators to meeting those needs and (2) clinical experiences working with this population.",

We evaluated feasibility using recruitment and retention rates; acceptability via Veteran satisfaction, working relationship with the peer, and staff satisfaction; and utility based on the proportion of Veterans who experienced a large change in outcomes (e.g., stress, mental health symptoms, and quality of life). The Syracuse VA Human Subjects Institutional Review Board approved all procedures.\nResults: Staff interviews highlight that women Veterans have numerous unmet social needs and concerns common among women which increase the complexity of their care; call for a supportive, consistent, trusting relationship with someone on their health care team; and require many resources (e.g., staff such as social workers, services such as legal support, and physical items such as diapers) to support their needs (some of which are available within VHA but may need support for staffing or access, and some of which are unavailable). Feasibility outcomes suggest a need to modify PSP and research methods to enhance intervention and assessment retention before the larger trial; the recruitment rate was acceptable by the end of the trial. Veteran acceptability of PSP was high. Veteran outcomes demonstrate promise for utility to improve stress, mental health symptoms, and quality of life for women Veterans.\nConclusions: Given the high acceptability and promising outcomes for utility, changes to the design to enhance the feasibility outcomes which failed to meet the a priori Go/No-Go criteria are warranted. These outcomes support future trials of PSP within VHA Women\u2019s Wellness Centers.\n*VA Center for Integrated Healthcare, Syracuse VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA\n\u2020Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA\n\u2021Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA\n\u00a7Women\u2019s Wellness Center, Syracuse VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA\n||Department of Family Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA\n\u00b6Susan B.

Peers are Veterans in recovery from a behavioral health concern with specialized training to support other Veterans.8 Peers working in PACT teams are well positioned to provide navigation and social support for broad, non-diagnostic concerns such as stress compared to clinical providers who largely address medical or psychiatric diagnostic concerns and social workers who address identified social needs.\nDespite the existence of VHA standards for gendertailored interdisciplinary care, women Veterans have poor perceptions of VHA health care and report gender-specific barriers to care.9 A study evaluating women Veterans\u2019 rationale for using VHA care identified problems with patient\u2013 provider relationships, organizational and logistic barriers, and problems with Veteran benefits as reasons they discontinued VHA care.10 Gender-tailored services, comprehensive care, and positive patient\u2013provider experiences were reasons Veterans retained care.10 Power asymmetries in the patient\u2013provider relationship can make it difficult for patients to address their priorities.11,12 Peers\u2019 identity and experiential knowledge reduce power asymmetries, inform patient navigation, and allow them to facilitate positive supportive relationships with the health care team.13\nPersonalized Support for Progress (PSP) is a patientcentered lay-delivered intervention co-created with patients.14,15 PSP uses a prioritization tool to help patients identify their priorities, supports personalized planning, and provides emotional and pragmatic support.14,15 Non-Veteran women with depression and unmet social needs in an obstetrics and gynecology practice who received PSP demonstrated high satisfaction and reductions in depression compared to those who received tailored referrals.14 Based on our clinical experiences with women Veterans and the literature about women Veterans\u2019 needs and barriers to care, PSP was translated to VHA. The PSP prioritization tool is well suited for the competing demands16 that contribute to stress. Furthermore, the social and pragmatic support fit well with peers\u2019 role17 and was ideally suited to address women Veterans\u2019 stressors. Thus, we hypothesized PSP delivered by a peer would meet the needs of Veterans in a VHA Women\u2019s Wellness Center with high stress."

Future trials should consider reducing assessment burden, increasing staff follow-up, specifying a time frame rather than a time point for completion (e.g., 6-8- month vs. 6-month follow-up), and allowing multiple options for completion (e.g., telephone, online, mail, and in-person).\nDespite high acceptability, intervention retention did not meet the Go/No-Go criteria. To reduce potential barriers to initiating PSP, future trials could implement warm handoffs, a strategy used to increase behavioral health initiation in primary care. Warm handoffs are a staple of in-person primary care and involve an introduction to the peer from another staff member during another appointment. Increased virtual care through the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in recommendations on maximizing team-based care, including warm handoffs, virtually.33"

The pandemic changed our methods unexpectedly, but the pivot to a telephone format was associated with improved recruitment. The small sample in a single location with one peer limits generalizability. Limited assessment retention may also mean that the results fail to reflect the overall study sample\u2019s experiences. PSP was not well integrated into clinical care; thus, staff did not feel confident commenting on it, and we were unable to assess provider acceptability."
