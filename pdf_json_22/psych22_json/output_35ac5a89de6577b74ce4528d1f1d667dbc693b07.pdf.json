    "abstractText": "Background: The primary objective of this study is to ascertain whether the Expectation Confirmation Model can be expanded by external variables including computer anxiety, social interaction, and self-efficacy to better understand the intention to continue using online learning systems in the post-pandemic era among vocational college students. Moreover, this research argues that the intention to continue using online learning systems among students may be gender-sensitive.",

            "text": "The devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has reached approximately every sector of society around the globe, and vocational colleges are no exception (Xu et\u00a0al., 2017; ZapataCuervo et\u00a0 al., 2022). It has led to the interruption of most traditional teaching methods and compelled both the teaching and learning processes to undergo unpredictable and rapid shifts, such as the traditional teaching and learning activities of more than 1,300 vocational colleges and nearly 11,000 vocational high schools in China have had to be\u00a0discontinued and transferred to an online model (Han et\u00a0 al., 2021). Accordingly, educational institutions have re-established plans to begin offering online courses in a relatively short amount of time (Persada et\u00a0al., 2021; Soria-Barreto et\u00a0al., 2021; Wut et\u00a0al., 2022). Online learning is a form of synchronous learning in different places that is based on networking technology and realizes cross-border humancomputer, interpersonal communication, and long-distance interaction through information technology (Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2018). Compared to conventional learning, online learning has numerous benefits. For example, firstly, the cost of education is lowered for students because of the widespread availability of high-quality educational resources that may be\u00a0shared among them through online learning Mushtaque et\u00a0al. (2022). Secondly, online learning is conducive to communication and cooperation between students and allows them to share their ideas with others in a timely manner (Wut et\u00a0 al., 2022). Thirdly, online learning allows for personalized learning and flexible scheduling of learning progress (Besser et\u00a0al., 2022). In general, the advantages of online learning are more prominent during the epidemic.\nNumerous academics have studied online learning in recent decades from a variety of angles based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Information System Continuance (ISC), and other theories (Karaoglan Yilmaz and Yilmaz, 2020; Karao\u011flan Y\u0131lmaz, 2022). The majority of these studies concentrate on the adoption and satisfaction of online learning, but Garc\u00eda-Morales et\u00a0 al. (2021) argue that the sustainable development and service of online learning in the future will become the focus of postepidemic education. As a result, the model of expectation confirmation will serve as the foundation for this research, which will investigate the factors that influence vocational college students\u2019 decisions on whether or not they will continue using online learning in the post-epidemic age.\nScholars conducted research on the factors that affect students\u2019 continuous use of online learning in various scenarios (Li and Zhao, 2021; Persada et\u00a0al., 2021; Soria-Barreto et\u00a0al., 2021). It is concluded that the interactivity of online learning systems is the key to ensure the quality of online learning and improve the intention to use online learning systems continuously. For instance, Wut et\u00a0al. (2022) considered that the focus of the future online and offline learning debate is student experience. And interactivity is the most essential element affecting the online learning experience. A learning system with good experience can reduce the cognitive load of students when using the system and\nimprove their intention to use it continuously. Li and Zhao (2021) extended the expectation confirmation model by including social interaction and quality to investigate the factors that influence the intention to continuously use online learning. In addition to studying the external factors of learners, researchers are also increasingly interested in their psychological traits (Karaoglan Yilmaz and Yilmaz, 2020; Karaoglan Yilmaz, 2022; Karao\u011flan Y\u0131lmaz, 2022; Yilmaz et\u00a0al., 2022). For example, Self-determination theory (SDT) was used by Luo et\u00a0al. (2021) to build a model that elaborate the links between students\u2019 basic psychological needs, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and continued intention to use online self-regulated learning. Sharma et\u00a0al. (2022) explored the relationship between self-congruity, perceived enjoyment, and the intention to continue using e-learning. The above literature review demonstrates that there is a close relationship between online learners\u2019 psychological factors and their intention to continue using online learning.\nHowever, few studies have been conducted on the effects of emotional elements like computer self-efficacy and anxiety on online learners\u2019 continued intentions. This could be\u00a0interpreted as a gap in the existing literature that requires more investigation. Bao (2020) points out that this transition to online learning occurs suddenly, so the degrees of anxiety that learners experience need to be\u00a0alleviated in order to verify the efficiency of online learning. Meanwhile, the survey reveals that students at vocational colleges have a hard time maintaining focus while studying online for extended periods of time (Panigrahi et\u00a0 al., 2018; Baber, 2021; Soria-Barreto et\u00a0al., 2021). Consequently, one of the methods to boost the vocational college students\u2019 intention to continue using online learning systems is to enhance learners\u2019 self-efficacy and decrease students\u2019 anxiety level regarding the usage of online learning systems (Niu et\u00a0al., 2022).\nCompared with previous studies, the innovations of this study mainly include the following three points: Firstly, it adapts the expectation confirmation model by introducing three new context-specific elements, namely, computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, and social interaction. Secondly, most of the prior studies treated samples as a homogenous group (Panigrahi et\u00a0al., 2018; Chung et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang S. et\u00a0al., 2021). However, as the audience of online learning systems is becoming an increasingly diverse group, a differentiated strategy is required to encourage continuous user participation. Therefore, this study explores whether there are gender differences in the intention to use online learning systems (Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2018; Mouakket, 2018; Albelali and Alaulamie, 2019). Thirdly, this research selects vocational college students as samples. The majority of past research has concentrated on the fields of higher education (Cranfield et\u00a0al., 2021; Leo et\u00a0 al., 2021), elementary education, and secondary education (Christakis et\u00a0al., 2020). In spite of the importance of online learning for students at vocational colleges, most studies conducted during the pandemic ignored this sector.\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a \u201ccontinued usage intention model for online learning\u201d that would account for the factors that influence students\u2019 continued usage intentions of\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nonline learning systems. These are the sorts of issues that this research begs to address:\n(1) What factors affect vocational college students\u2019 intention to continue using online learning system? (2) How well do the influencing factors account for the intention to continue using online learning? (3) Are there gender differences in the influencing factors of students\u2019 intention to continue using online learning?\nThe remaining five portions of the research are as follows: The second part is a literature review of the relevant theory and puts forward the theoretical model of this study as well as hypotheses about the relationships between various variables. The third part describes in detail the methods used in this study and the analysis of the results, followed by a discussion. Finally, the limitations of the study are discussed, along with some recommendations for additional research that could be\u00a0done in the future."

            "text": "When faced with a stressful situation, it is normal for people to feel anxious (Fenton et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAnxiety related to using computers is known as \u201ccomputer anxiety\u201d (CA), which is a form of concept-specific anxiety and a special psychological phenomenon (Saade and Kira, 2006). In this study, \u201ccomputer anxiety\u201d is defined as a situational fear or anxiety that can be\u00a0changed when an individual anticipates or actually uses a computer (Sun et\u00a0al., 2008). The adoption of online learning systems is significantly influenced by anxiety. Individuals who are anxious or unsettled about the prospect of adopting online learning are less likely to use it.\nSome researchers have recognized the significance of CA in the intention to use technology continuously (Chou et\u00a0al., 2012; Purnomo and Lee, 2013; Zarafshani et\u00a0al., 2020; Seolah et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, Purnomo and Lee (2013) consider that the fun of playing games on the computer has disappeared when faced with the learning of professional knowledge, which can lead to anxiety and fear in the long run and dampen students\u2019 perceived usefulness of the online learning systems. Hai et\u00a0al. (2020) pointed out that using new technology tends to evoke more apprehension for users with CA because new technology requires users to learn new terminology, which is more difficult and time-consuming than technology with less complexity. Lu et\u00a0al. (2019) found that in the online learning environment, students frequently suffer from anxiety when using computers since they are not proficient enough in information technology, fear of poor learning performance, and other reasons. Since perceived usefulness is the most powerful predictor of behavioral intention to use, students\nwith high computer anxiety will indirectly affect their continued use of online learning systems (Niu and Wu, 2022). According to a comprehensive review of the relevant literature (Tri and Hafiz, 2018; Samydevan et\u00a0 al., 2020; Lee and Xiong, 2022), it can be\u00a0concluded that online learning under the influence of anxiety and fear cannot make them experience the usefulness of online learning (Persada et\u00a0al., 2021) as well as the unpleasant emotions caused by users\u2019 use of new technologies are unlikely to be\u00a0alleviated, so it is impossible to form a positive confirmation (Feng et\u00a0al., 2019). As a result, this research hypothesizes:\nH1: CA has a negative effect on PU of an online learning system.\nH2: CA has a negative effect on CON of an online learning system."

            "text": "ECM was first proposed by Bhattacherjee (2001), and it is grounded in Oliver\u2019s (1980) expectation confirmation theory (ECT). Perceived usefulness (PU; sometimes called post-adoption expectation), the extent of their confirmation, and satisfaction are the three factors that the ECM posits as determining whether or not users will continue using the technology (Bhattacherjee, 2001; Lee, 2010). Confirmation, when applied to the realm of online learning, refers to the degree to which a learner\u2019s expectations about their online learning experience match their actual online learning experience. According to ECM, after using any technology, users evaluate their performance perception in comparison to their prior expectations and then decide the level of confirmation (Wang and Wang, 2019). Users construct a postacceptance, also known as a usefulness perception, depending on their usage experience and the level of confirmation. These perceptions of usefulness may differ from or coincide with the users\u2019 initial anticipations. The subsequent formation of satisfaction is caused by the confirmation of expectations and the perception of usefulness (Rahi et\u00a0al., 2022). Finally, a high degree of technical satisfaction will form a continuous intention (Rabaa'i et\u00a0al., 2021; Anjum et\u00a0al., 2022; Huang et\u00a0al., 2022).\nPrevious research has demonstrated the relationship between various variables related to ECM (Daneji et\u00a0 al., 2019; Cheng, 2020a,b; Persada et\u00a0al., 2021; Zuniga-Jara, 2021). Persada et\u00a0al. (2021) demonstrated that the powerful indicator of users\u2019 continuous intentions is satisfaction. Zuniga-Jara (2021) indicated that perceived usefulness is found to be\u00a0 the most powerful predictor of continuous intention. Bhattacherjee (2001) found that confirmation is the key factor influencing a user\u2019s satisfaction. If online learning systems help users improve their academic performance, they are usually perceived as useful (Baber, 2021; Persada et\u00a0al., 2021). Confirmation will lead to user satisfaction\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nwhen users believe it is beneficial and their real use experience matches or surpasses their original expectations (Tan and Kim, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2017). (Akter et\u00a0al., 2020) considered that because users\u2019 perceptions of the usefulness of online learning systems can commonly serve as a baseline against confirmation judgments, more useful online learning systems will be\u00a0 more likely to be\u00a0perceived as satisfactory. Previous empirical studies have also shown that this satisfaction is an important indicator for predicting the intention to continue using online learning systems (Yang, 2018; Chen, 2021; Si et\u00a0al., 2022). In addition, students who have a positive attitude toward online learning are more likely to use it all the time if they see an improvement in their academic achievement as a result of utilizing the systems (Fang et\u00a0al., 2017; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017; Widjaja et\u00a0al., 2021). Based on a large number of literature analyses, the hypotheses are derived as follows:\nH3: CON will positively affect SAT with online learning systems.\nH4: PU will positively affect SAT with online learning systems.\nH5: PU will positively affect CI of online learning systems.\nH6: SAT will positively affect CI of online learning systems."

            "text": "Interaction has been recognized for a very long time as one of the important factors. Although there is no clear definition of interaction at present, its basic feature is behavior involving two or more subjects sharing information and opinions with each other. The definition of interaction in online learning is proposed by various researchers, and it claims that learner\u2013learner, instructor\u2013learner, and content\u2013learner are all possible types of interaction that might take place during online learning (Abrami et\u00a0 al., 2011; Alqurashi, 2018; Baber, 2021). The first two interactions are what we\u00a0refer to as social interaction. The key to a successful learning experience for students is interactions, which is at the core of the learning process (Keskin et\u00a0al., 2020).\nNumerous studies have examined the link between students\u2019 SI and CI (Lugonzo, 2020; Baber, 2021; Byun et\u00a0al., 2021; Yoon et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, using mediator factors like imagery and flow, Rodriguez-Ardura and Meseguer-Artola (2016) discover that the continual learning behavior of students can be\u00a0encouraged through frequent interaction. Research by Molinillo et\u00a0al. (2018) demonstrates the positive effects of learner-to-learner and learnerto-instructor interactions on students\u2019 emotional involvement, which in turn enhances students\u2019 active learning and their\nintention to continue using online learning. Holland (2019) found that when students communicate with each other in online learning, social interaction is fostered by the communication process. Higher levels of satisfaction with online learning are experienced by students who interact more with their teachers and peers. Consequently, social interaction in online learning will enhance the intention to continue using the systems (Panigrahi et\u00a0al., 2018; Chung et\u00a0al., 2020; Li and Zhao, 2021). The following is how the hypothesis is formed from an analysis of the available literature:\nH7: SI will positively affect CI with online learning systems."

            "text": "Self-efficacy refers to \u201cthe individuals having the ability and belief to complete a specific task, as well as the confidence to cope with future challenges\u201d (S\u00e1nchez and Hueros, 2010). In this study, computer self-efficacy is a specific definition of self-efficacy, which refers to the individual\u2019s judgment of their ability to use the online learning system (Venkatesh and Morris, 2000). Individuals who have a higher computer self-efficacy (CSE) magnitude are more likely to believe that they are able to successfully complete challenging computing activities and to believe that they are able to function with a smaller amount of support and assistance than people who have a lower CSE magnitude. In other words, a person\u2019s level of self-efficacy will affect whether or not they participate in activities, how much effort they put into finishing those activities, and how persistent they are in doing so (Bandura and Watts, 1999).\nPrevious research has suggested that relevant on CSE is linked to CI (Hermawan et\u00a0 al., 2021; Nurhikmah et\u00a0 al., 2021; Putra, 2021). For example, Mushtaque et\u00a0 al. (2022) took 369 newly enrolled medical students as samples to investigate whether or not medical students would like to use the online learning systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings showed that CSE significantly reduced the negative impacts of technological stress and increased the intention to use online learning systems among medical students. Putra (2021) also discovered that CSE had a direct positive influence on students\u2019 continued intention to use online learning. In conclusion, CSE is a critical predictor of the intention to continuously use online learning.\nCSE is directly linked to individual confidence in one\u2019s own competence and knowledge in a given area (Hsu et\u00a0al., 2018; Ren et\u00a0al., 2018). Relevant research results show that students can feel confident when using online learning systems if they possess the requisite level of competence or knowledge, which helps reinforce the perception of its usefulness (Fathema et\u00a0al., 2015; Kanwal and Rehman, 2017; Salloum et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, students with high CSE may have a higher PU of online learning systems. However, low computer self-efficacy students will experience tension and\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nanxiety when using computers, which will lower their judgment of their usefulness (Rahi et\u00a0al., 2022). Analysis based on the above literature review, the hypotheses are derived as follows:\nH8: CSE will positively affect PU with online learning systems.\nH9: CSE will positively affect CI with online learning systems."

            "heading": "2.5. The moderating effect of gender",
            "text": "The literature on social psychology suggests that there are substantial gender-based disparities in how people behave in a variety of decision-making contexts (Bandura, 1986). Meanwhile, it has long been widely accepted that there are significant gender differences in information technology use (Grint et\u00a0 al., 1995; Sandelowski, 2000; Brussevich et\u00a0 al., 2018). A lot of research shows that the online learning motivation of females shows a strong sense of self-guidance and responsibility and that they are more satisfied with the online learning experience (Albelali and Alaulamie, 2019; Malik et\u00a0al., 2020; Wongwatkit et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, some studies have indicated that gender has no influence on online learning satisfaction and learning achievements (Martin and Bolliger, 2018; Alghamdi et\u00a0al., 2020; Dubois et\u00a0al., 2020). However, whether gender affects the intentions to use online learning continuously needs to be\u00a0further clarified.\nIt has been reported that male and female students may view their own computer self-efficacy differently (Assaker, 2020; Yorulmaz, 2021; Bailey, 2022). Among a group of university freshmen, Yorulmaz (2021) finds that the males are more confident in their abilities to use computers than the females. Recent research into gender disparities in CSE suggests that the difference may be\u00a0due to the perceived masculinity of the activity in question (Alghamdi et\u00a0al., 2020; Yorulmaz, 2021). It appears that the gender difference in CSE is caused by the complexity of the task. The perceived masculinity element increases as the activity becomes more difficult, and men demonstrate more selfefficacy for such activities, which in turn affects their intentions to use online learning in a sustained manner. This study thus hypothesizes:\nH10a: There is difference between male and female in CSE and CI.\nAccording to the available literature, males are more susceptible to utility and expected performance because they are more task-oriented (Assaker, 2020; Pal and Patra, 2021; Kaur and Kaur, 2022). In particular, Kaur and Kaur (2022) found that the correlation between PU and CI is stronger for males than for females, which suggests that gender moderates the relationship. We\u00a0 anticipate that the relationship between PU and CI will be\u00a0stronger for males in the context of online learning. Males are\nmore task and result-oriented, and they care more concerned with the advantages or utilities they get from using online learning systems. Following this reasoning, the following hypothesis is established:\nH10b: There is difference between male and female in PU and CI.\nThe technical aspects of online learning are helpful in accomplishing their learning objectives, thus affecting their SAT with online learning (Brussevich et\u00a0 al., 2018; Alghamdi et\u00a0 al., 2020; Dubois et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, SAT has a greater impact on men\u2019s CI because it depends more on the technical characteristics of online learning than on social characteristics. As males are taskoriented, their SAT with online learning will be\u00a0more significant. We\u00a0predict that the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s SAT with online learning will affect their CI. The hypothesis is proposed as follows:\nH10c: There is difference between male and female in SAT and CI.\nMales and females are products of two evidently distinct cultures, and as a result, they develop very distinctive approaches to the social interactions appropriate to their respective genders (Wood-Downie et\u00a0al., 2021).

Step\u00a0 3 involves evaluating the outcomes of multi-group comparison statistical tests.\nThe first step is to form a data set. Aiming to evaluate dissimilarities among different groups. Groups are divided into males and females according to the purpose of the study (Lohm\u00f6ller, 1989). However, results from statistical tests may be\u00a0skewed, if the disparity in sample sizes between the two groups is >50% (Hair Jr. and Page 2015). There are 239 men and 243 females, respectively, representing a difference of <50%. Consequently, the statistical findings have no bias.\nSecondly, Henseler et\u00a0al. (2016) state that it is essential to carry out the MICOM before performing the multigroup analysis. The purpose of this MICOM is to provide empirical evidence to support that the difference between the two groups is due to the structural model rather than the measurement model (Henseler et\u00a0al., 2016).\nThere are three steps involved in MICOM: (1) ensuring configuration invariance; (2) ensuring compositional invariance; and (3) ensuring the composite mean values and variances are equal. Firstly, diverse groups use totally consistent measurement items, methods for processing data, and approaches for analyzing data. In light of this, the data for the male and female groups has been established for configuration invariance. Secondly, a permutation test is used to determine whether or not compositional invariance exists. The compositional invariance test requires that the original correlations should be\u00a0equal to or greater than the 5.00% quantile correlations. The last step is to determine whether or not the variances and mean values of the groups are equal. According to Table\u00a011, compositional invariance exists.\nThe difference between the composite\u2019s mean and variance ratio results must fall within the 95% confidence interval. Tables 12, 13 both show evidence of partial invariance. Actually, PLS-MGA can be\u00a0used for multi-group analysis to compare the structural paths between groups even when only partial measurement invariance is present (Henseler et\u00a0al., 2016).\nFinally, to test if significant statistical differences exist between males and females, we\u00a0employ the PLS-MGA. The path coefficient and mean difference of the composite are shown in Table\u00a014. At the same time, the study reveals that male and female data sets have distinct differences in the impact of perceived usefulness on the intention to continue using online learning systems. Other path hypotheses show no significant difference (Table\u00a015)."

Furthermore, this study also explores whether there is a gender difference among these factors in light of the growing interest in online learning. In order to better understand the causal mechanism of students\u2019 intention to continue using online learning, this study constructs a model to explore the causal relationship between variables.\nThe research results could fall into two distinct parts. First, this study sheds light on the relationships between the ECM variables. Results from our analysis show that in addition to the significant negative correlation between CON and SAT, other hypotheses about the relationship between ECM variables PU, SAT, CON and CI are supported. It\u2019s clear that our findings align with those of Mushtaque et\u00a0al. (2022), which conclude that SAT, CON, and PU all have a role in shaping vocational students\u2019 continuation intentions toward online learning systems. The following is a detailed description:\nThere is a negative relationship between CON and SAT. These findings are inconsistent with preceding ECM-based studies, as they reported that learners\u2019 initial expectations of the online learning system are positive predictors of satisfaction (Chong, 2021; Barroso et\u00a0al., 2022; Si et\u00a0al., 2022). It\u2019s likely that people\u2019s expectations for the system are based on their previous experiences with similar systems, and this could be\u00a0 one reason. Due to the impact of the epidemic, the traditional face-to-face learning mode has changed to online learning, while vocational college students lack online learning experience.\nIt is possible that the correlation between PU and SAT can be\u00a0 explained by the fact that when students\u2019 performance is improved through the use of an online learning system, they typically demonstrate high levels of satisfaction. This finding is unanimous with the outcomes of prior research (Chen and Keng, 2019; Ashraf et\u00a0al., 2020; Soria-Barreto et\u00a0al., 2021). As reported by Olasina (2018), students pay greater attention to their individual needs while using online learning systems. Students may be\u00a0satisfied with online learning systems if they have the\nperception that those systems can enhance their capabilities, work performance, or the effectiveness of their learning.\nThe empirical findings confirm the considerable impact of SAT on CI in online learning settings.\nPrevious research has found the same results (Panigrahi et\u00a0al., 2018; Chung et\u00a0al., 2020; Yoon et\u00a0al., 2021). Satisfaction is related to learners\u2019 learning experiences. According to the research conclusion, learners\u2019 learning experiences are highly correlated with their computer anxiety during the learning process. Therefore, reducing the difficulty of online learning systems and improving their self-confidence are particularly important for promoting learners\u2019 intentions to continue to participate in online learning.\nThe findings show that students\u2019 intentions to continue using online learning systems are significantly impacted by PU. The results corroborate those of earlier research (Bawack and Ahmad, 2021; Han and Du, 2021; Barroso et\u00a0al., 2022). The perception of usefulness is mainly reflected in the fact that using online learning systems to learn can improve learning effects and efficiency, and the improvement of usefulness will directly affect their intentions to continue using online learning systems to learn in the future.\nSecond, the findings have demonstrated that all of the hypotheses pertaining to the relationships between the various external variables and PU, SAT, CON, and CI are supported.\nThis study found that CA has a negative impact on PU. This suggests that perceived usefulness decreases as anxiety levels increase. These results are consistent with what was found by Chang et\u00a0al. (2017) and Wu and Wang (2020). With the continuous accumulation of experience in using online learning systems, users\u2019 perception of anxiety will also be\u00a0reduced. Teachers should therefore focus more on and mentor students with limited computer abilities in online learning to help them achieve better, so as to improve their perception of the usefulness of online learning.\nThe results of this study show that anxiety has a prominent influence on vocational college students\u2019 confirmation. Having anxiety makes it more difficult to confirm, as the relationship is negative. Previous research has supported this relationship (Lee et\u00a0al., 2009; Rabaa'i et\u00a0al., 2021; Barroso et\u00a0al., 2022). The anxiety generated by students in the online learning process will inhibit the positive expectations of the system.\nPrior researches points out to that CSE is a critical factor in determining whether someone chooses to use computers (online learning systems) through PU (Mouakket and Bettayeb, 2015; Eraslan Yalcin and Kutlu, 2019; Lew et\u00a0al., 2019). It can provide students with additional computer use opportunities to help them increase their future use and improve their self-efficacy.\nThis research demonstrates that SI has a significant role in determining CI. In light of this, it can be\u00a0deduced that SI is still an important component of effective online learning, which is consistent with the findings of Eom and Ashill (2016); (Eom et\u00a0al., 2010; Lasfeto, 2020; Mehall, 2020).

If potential users of online learning systems hear from others in their social environment that the online learning system is simple to operate, they may believe that switching to the online learning system will require little effort.\nThe findings also indicate that a student\u2019s CSE has a positive correlation with their CI to use online learning systems. As a consequence of this, the higher the CSE of the students, the higher their intention to continue using online learning systems. The finding is identical with the results of Nurhikmah et\u00a0 al. (2021), who discovered that higher CSE contributes to higher computer usage. The findings, however, show that CSE is the weakest predictor. When students grow more and more familiar with online learning systems, the significance of CSE may diminish.\nRemarkably, MGA results indicate that there is a remarkable difference between males and females in the relationship of PU to CI. There is no significant difference in other path assumptions. However, this difference does not exist naturally. It overturns the conventional understanding that males have natural advantages in the use of technology (Fu et\u00a0al., 2022). From the perspective of the path coefficient (PU \u2192 CI), females are higher than males. This shows that females pay more attention to the classroom teaching and teaching evaluation of online learning than boys and have a more significant impact on their intentions to continue using online learning. In addition, females pay more attention to the influence of PU than males, which also shows that females always maintain the gender impression of \u201chard work\u201d in learning and that online learning has stronger endogenous motivation.\nIn conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that ECM can be\u00a0applied to assess the students\u2019 intention to continue utilizing an online learning system. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that students place varying amounts of importance on the factors that determine CI but place less emphasis on CSE. In addition, we\u00a0ought to pay attention to the moderating effect of gender on students\u2019 intentions to use online learning continuously."

            "text": "This research takes students from eight vocational colleges in Jiangxi Province as the research object to explore the influencing factors of online learning\u2019s intention to use continuously. The research conclusion has certain theoretical contributions.\nFirstly, innovation in research perspectives. This paper discusses the influencing factors and the interaction mechanism between the vocational college students\u2019 intention to use online learning continuously, filling the gap that most current relevant researches focus on general college education and ignore vocational college students (Niu et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThe second is the innovation of research variables. In previous studies based on an expectation confirmation model to reveal learners\u2019 intention to use continuously, the independent variables were mostly external factors (Wang T. et\u00a0al., 2021). This research creatively introduces emotional factors such as computer anxiety and self-efficacy as independent variables in the process of online learning expectation confirmation. It is helpful to promote the innovation of research conclusions by mining variables that promote students\u2019 continuous use of online learning from their own factors.\nThird, innovation of research focus. In the past, most studies on the intention to continue using online learning treated samples as homogeneous groups (Wu and Wang, 2018; Wu and Tian, 2021), ignoring differences among users. This study is conducted from the perspective of gender, and the results show that gender moderates the relationship between perceived usefulness and intention to continually use, while having no significant impact on other paths, which is conducive to the promotion of research conclusions."

In order to further enhance the quality of the material presented in the online course, the system developers need to change the course design based on the learning behavior data of the students and provide meaningful course material to boost students\u2019 perception of the usefulness of the system.\nFrom the perspective of educators, teachers should cultivate students\u2019 online learning abilities, such as the capacity to conduct an efficient search for useful educational resources and to make appropriate use of a wide range of educational tools. Only when students become proficient in a variety of learning strategies who can their sense of self-efficacy be\u00a0further improved. Additionally, effective online learning relies heavily on social interaction. Therefore, it is necessary to design realistic ways to improve studentteacher and student\u2013student interaction. The instructional design of online classrooms may incorporate collaborative course activities such as group work and debate, as well as other forms of communication tools, such as chat rooms and discussion boards, to encourage student engagement and interaction. Meanwhile, teachers should also avoid stereotypes and recognize that, under the same\neducational background, the difference in the intentions of males and females to continue to use online learning is gradually narrowing."

First of all, only students enrolled in vocational colleges are included in the sample for this research. In the future, researchers can investigate whether or not there are differences in what ways by comparing vocational college students with general higher education students, with the goal of better understanding the vocational college students\u2019 intention to continue using online learning. Secondly, the conclusions are drawn solely from statistical data, which might make it more difficult to have an in-depth discussion about the continued use of online learning in emergency management. Therefore, future research can include qualitative methods, which could help find more key elements of the continued intention, and the results might help to explain deficiencies in quantitative research. Finally, the focus of this study is on the intention to continue using online learning system, the ultimate objective of all study on intention is to forecast and account for behavior in essence. Previous studies have shown that there is a significant correlation between the intention to continue using online learning and behavior. Future studies can further explore whether intention and behavior are directly related, indirectly related, or affected by other factors."
