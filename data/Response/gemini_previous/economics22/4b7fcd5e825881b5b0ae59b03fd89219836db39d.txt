1. **Investigate the impact of the selection right on the efficiency of land use.** This could be done by comparing the land use patterns in areas where developers have the right to select the land they want to develop with those in areas where they do not have this right. This research could help to determine whether the selection right leads to more efficient land use and, if so, how this can be achieved.


2. **Examine the relationship between the selection right and the price of construction land.** This could be done by analyzing data on the prices of construction land in areas where developers have the right to select the land they want to develop with those in areas where they do not have this right. This research could help to determine whether the selection right leads to higher land prices and, if so, how this can be mitigated.


3. **Explore the impact of the selection right on the behavior of developers.** This could be done by conducting surveys or interviews with developers to understand how they use the selection right and how it affects their decision-making process. This research could help to identify ways to encourage developers to use the selection right in a way that benefits the public good.


4. **Develop a model to simulate the effects of the selection right on the construction land market.** This model could be used to explore different scenarios and to assess the potential impacts of changes to the selection right. This research could help policymakers to make informed decisions about the design of the construction land market.


5. **Conduct a comparative analysis of the selection right in different countries.** This could help to identify best practices and to develop recommendations for how to improve the design of the selection right in China. This research could also help to inform the development of international standards for the allocation of construction land.
