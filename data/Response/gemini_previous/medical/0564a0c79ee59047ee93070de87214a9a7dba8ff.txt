1. **Investigate the long-term economic burden of LN:** This study only examined the economic burden of LN over a 12-month period. A longitudinal study could track the costs associated with LN over a longer period of time, such as 5 or 10 years, to determine the full extent of the economic burden of this disease.


2. **Compare the economic burden of LN in different countries:** This study was conducted in the United States, but the economic burden of LN may vary in other countries due to differences in healthcare systems and costs. A comparative study could examine the economic burden of LN in different countries to identify potential disparities in access to care and outcomes.


3. **Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different LN treatments:** There are a variety of treatments available for LN, but their cost-effectiveness has not been well-studied. A cost-effectiveness analysis could compare the costs and benefits of different LN treatments to help clinicians and patients make informed decisions about the best course of treatment.


4. **Identify factors that contribute to the economic burden of LN:** This study found that patients with LN had higher rates of hospitalization, emergency room visits, and pharmacy use compared to patients with SLE without LN. Future research could investigate the factors that contribute to these increased rates of healthcare utilization, such as disease severity, socioeconomic status, and access to care.


5. **Develop interventions to reduce the economic burden of LN:** The results of this study suggest that there is a need for interventions to reduce the economic burden of LN. Future research could focus on developing and evaluating interventions, such as patient education programs, disease management programs, and financial assistance programs, to help patients with LN manage their disease and reduce their healthcare costs.
