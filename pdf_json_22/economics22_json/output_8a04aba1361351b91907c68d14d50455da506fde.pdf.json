Early CPR and defibrillation improves\nSCA outcomes but access to automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) remains limited.\nMethods: Markov models were used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a portable\nSMART (SMall AED for Rapid Treatment of SCA) approach to early SCA management\nover a life-time horizon in at-risk and not at-risk populations. Simulated patients (n\n= 600,000) who had not received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) were\nrandomized to a SMART device with CPR prompts or non-SMART approaches. Annual\nSCA risk was varied from 0.2 to 3.5%. Analysis was performed in a US economy\nfrom both societal (SP) and healthcare (HP) perspectives to evaluate the number of\nSCA fatalities prevented by SMART, and SMART cost-effectiveness at a threshold\nof $100,000/Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY).\nResults: A SMART approach was cost-effective when annual SCA risk exceeded\n1.51% (SP) and 1.62% (HP). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were\n$95,251/QALY (SP) and $100,797/QALY (HP) at a 1.60% SCA annual risk. At a 3.5%\nannual SCA risk, SMART was highly cost-effective from both SP and HP [ICER:\n$53,925/QALY (SP), $59,672/QALY (HP)]. In microsimulation, SMART prevented 1,762\nfatalities across risk strata (1.59% fatality relative risk reduction across groups). From a\npopulation perspective, SMART could prevent at least 109,839 SCA deaths in persons\n45 years and older in the United States.\nShaker et al.

            "text": "Every day, almost 1,000 people experience sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the United States with a staggering 90% fatality rate (1). From a societal perspective (SP), sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the United States results in an estimated 2 million years of potential life lost for men and 1.3 million years for women (2). In fact, estimated deaths attributed to SCD exceed all other individual causes of death, including lung cancer, accidents, chronic lower respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer (2). Worldwide, SCD and arrhythmia account for 15\u201320% of all deaths with the majority occurring in patients without cardiac risk factors (3). Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of global mortality, accounting for almost 17 million deaths annually. In developing countries, it causes twice as many deaths as HIV, malaria and TB combined. It is estimated that about 40\u201350% of all cardiovascular deaths are SCDs, and about 80% of these are caused by arrhythmias (4\u20136).\nTimely intervention with early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and an automated external defibrillator (AED) greatly improves outcomes for SCA (7, 8). While AEDs are abundant in public locations and large population centers, these devices are poignantly largely unavailable where most SCAs occur, given nearly 70% of SCA occurs at home (1). Additionally, AEDs are large and may be cumbersome to easily transport, which has limited the ability to have an AED available at all times.\nAbbreviations: AED, automatic external defibrillator; HP, healthcare perspective; ICD, implantable cardioverter defibrillator; ICER, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; NMB, net monetary benefit; QALY, quality adjusted life year; SMART, small AED for rapid treatment of SCA; SCA, sudden cardiac arrest; SP, societal perspective.\nFIGURE 1 | A smart phone enabled pocket AED. This SMall AED for Rapid Treatment of SCA (SMART) allows an approach to SCA prophylaxis that fosters rapid access to defibrillation.\nTo help solve the portability/transportability issue, recently, a smart phone enabled pocket AED has been developed. This SMall AED for Rapid Treatment of SCA (SMART) takes advantage of miniaturization to treat SCA in a novel way (Figure 1). The SMART device allows rapid access not only to effective CPR prompts, but also to early defibrillation.\nIn addition to device size, another reason AEDs may not be more available is that their cost (generally >$1,000) exceeds what individuals may wish to spend for personal use (9). However, considering cost separate from the device outcome fails to balance the tremendous benefit timely use of these devices can provide to persons at risk (1). Indeed, the ability to have an affordable and accessible, pocket-sized AED that can attach to a smartphone device has broad public health implications worldwide (4\u20136). The purpose of this study is to characterize the cost-effectiveness of the personal SMART device in populations at low, moderate, and high-risk for SCA."

Markov models compared universal and risk-stratified SMART approaches using cohort and microsimulation approaches. Patients receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) were not included in the analysis. Microsimulation tracker modifications were used to evaluate SMART fatality reduction on a population level, randomizing n = 600,000 patients across ranges of annual SCA risk (0.2\u20133.5%) (9, 11, 12). In addition to SCA risk, all patients assumed all-cause non-SCA mortality, estimated from United States Life Tables (13).

SMART CEA for SCA\nan annual probability of SCA and associated morbidity and mortality. A 50-year model horizon was used to evaluate longterm outcomes with a cycle length of 1-year from both the healthcare (HP) and societal (SP) perspectives (14). From the SP, the modeling included health sector considerations with health outcomes (health related quality-of-life effects) and medical costs (paid for by third-party payers and by patients out-of-pocket) and non-health sector considerations including lost productivity and funeral cost savings for SCA deaths averted with SMART use (14). The analysis conducted from the HP excluded lost wages and funeral costs from preventable SCA deaths in those without SMART access (14). Health outcomes included fatalities prevented and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at threshold cost-effectiveness of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (9, 15, 16). The analysis conformed to the Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement (17).

The PARAMEDIC trial was used to estimate likelihood of a shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) of 23% and the probability of witnessed arrest by a family member or other person able to use SMART was estimated at 55% (22, 23). While survival rates of non-shockable arrest are 4.4\u20135.7% (12, 24), the tight linkage of quick access to CPR and early defibrillation increases survival for out-of-hospital ventricular-fibrillation SCA (1, 25\u201328). In a study of 200 patients living in Olmstead County Minnesota, with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, Bunch et al. reported mean time from 911 call to first shock was 5.7min (SD, 1.6min) in survivors, and 6.6min (SD, 1.5min) in nonsurvivors (p = 0.002). In this study, 142 (72%) patients with ventricular fibrillation who received early defibrillation survived to hospital admission and 84 (42%) survived to hospital discharge (25). In a Japanese nationwide, prospective, population-based registry of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by Kitamura et al., 49.6% of individuals with bystander-witnessed ventricular-fibrillation arrest survived and had return of spontaneous circulation before hospital arrival (with 44.7% 1-month survival) vs. 29.1% of those without public access to defibrillation (with 27.9% 1- month survival) (22). Not all patients suffering SCA receive early defibrillation, and in a prospective observational study of New York City 911 emergency response, the median on-scene dispatch to patient response time was 7.6min (29). For modeling purposes, 49.6% of patients with ventricular-fibrillation arrest who used SMART were assumed to survive to hospital admission with a total survival rate to hospital discharge of 44.7% (22); those patients with ventricular-fibrillation arrest without SMART had survival to admission and discharge rates of 29.1% and 27.9%, respectively (22).

Health state utilities represent patient preferences for competing health states measured under conditions of risk, and were used to derive quality adjusted life years (QALY), with future QALY discounted in accord with costs (30\u201332). Patients who survive SCAmay experiencemoderate to severe impairments reflected by diminished HSU (9). In one survey of 729 SCA survivors, Nichol et al. used the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 system (HUI3) to assess quality of life and reported mean scores of 0.75 (SD, 0.33) and 0.74 (SD, 0.35) at 3 and 6 months following SCA (33). Health state utilities is directly related to time of resuscitation, with mean HUI3 scores of 0.81, 0.76, and 0.65 for those with resuscitation times of <2, 3\u201310, and >10min, respectively (34). Still, individuals who receive prompt defibrillation are less likely to experience impairment (25). For example, Bunch et al. reported the health of 50 SCA survivors who had received early defibrillation, measured on theMedical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) (25). Patients with rapid access to defibrillation had mean SF-36 scores similar to the general population (45, SD 11.1 vs. 50 for age-sex matched comparators).

At an annual SCA risk of 1.6%, a SMART strategy was most sensitive to changes across multiple model inputs, including time horizon (threshold <7.48 years, SP) overall SCA survival with shockable rhythm without SMART (threshold >28.6%, SP), start age (threshold >47.72, SP), probability of a witnessed arrest by a SMART user and a shockable rhythm (thresholds <52.4%; <22.0%, SP), initial SMART costs (threshold >$1,512, SP), amortized annual cost of replacement AED, pads, and battery (thresholds >$142; $48; $56, SP), overall SCA survival with shockable rhythm using SMART (threshold <44.0%, SP), health state utility of prior SCA, unimpaired (threshold <81.9, SP), probability of no impairment with shockable rhythm with and without SMART (thresholds <75.8%; >59.6%, SP), probability of moderate impairment with shockable rhythm with SMART (threshold <2.3%, SP), and probability of coma with shockable rhythmwithout SMART (threshold>22.8%). In the SP analysis excluding funeral costs did not impact cost-effectiveness estimates (Figure 3). As rates of witnessed arrest fell, SMART became less cost-effective. For example, assuming only a 32% probability of witnessed arrest, at an annual SCA risk of 1.6%, SMART cost $163,322 (SP) and $168,870 (HP) per QALY.\nTo further explore cost-effectiveness across ranges of SCA risk, a two-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate SMART cost-thresholds (Figure 4). Assuming an $800 AED cost, a SMART approach would be cost-effective [willingness to pay (WTP), $100,000/QALY] at a 1.0% SCA risk. At an AED cost of $488, a SMART approach would be cost-effective at a threshold SCA risk of 0.77%, and at an AED cost of $176, the SMART approach becomes cost-effective at an SCA threshold risk of 0.52%."

            "text": "Our analysis demonstrates a SMART strategy was cost-effective for patients with an annual SCA risk above 1.51% (SP) and 1.62% (HP). When considering SCA fatalities prevented over the 50- year simulation, SMART could save upwards of 100,000 lives in\nthe United States by preventing death from SCA. While not costeffective in patients with low annual SCA risk, a SMART strategy appears to provide attractive health and economic benefits in atrisk populations. For example, SCA risk varies by several clinical factors, including age, gender, race, total cholesterol, HDL, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking status (Table 3) (37). Risk of SCA is a large consideration in SMART cost-effectiveness. For example, at a 1.6% annual SCA risk the SMART strategy is not cost-effective when the probability of a witnessed arrest falls below 52.4%; however, at a 3.5% annual SCA risk the SMART strategy would be cost effective even when the probability of witnessed arrest is only 29.3%.\nThese findings are consistent with prior evaluations of the economic impact of personal AEDs. Cram et al. evaluated the cost-effectiveness of in-home AEDs for individuals with standard and elevated risk for SCD (9). In their analysis, they concluded in-home AED use in all adults over 60 years of age was associated with an ICER of $216,000/QALY (9). Furthermore, a more recent analysis by Haag and colleagues demonstrated in-home AED use in children at low to intermediate risk for SCD (0.8% risk) to be cost-effective (ICER, $86,458/QALY) (38). Our analysis is distinct from these earlier analyses, because the availability of a pocket-sized, smart-phone based AED with CPR prompts allows for access to a SMART strategy both in and out of the home. This is an important distinction, because while up to 70% of cardiac arrests occur in the home, the availability of an AED on one\u2019s person facilitates more rapid access to defibrillation, which should translate to better outcomes (9, 39).\nSudden cardiac arrest continues to be a significant societal and public health burden, and a preventable cause of death, with coronary artery disease being a leading etiology of SCA for individuals 35 years and older (5, 6, 40, 41). While ICDs may benefit those with the highest risk for SCA, the majority of deaths from cardiac arrest occur in individuals in whom ICD prophylaxis is not warranted (42). Without rapid access to defibrillation, SCA survival relies on EMS response time and availability of defibrillation, which may not arrive soon enough (29). Notably, EMS response times may exceed those modeled here, particularly in rural settings and neighborhoods characterized by higher rates of poverty (43, 44). The availability of a SMART strategy could help to optimize health equity for SCA victims who suffer from longer EMS response and could be even more cost-effective for these populations. For example, in a 2018 study Hsai et al. reported impoverished neighborhoods had 10% longer EMS response times, while a study by Peters et al. of the National Emergency Medical Services Information System demonstrated longer response times for rural vs. suburban or urban settings (7.5 vs. 5.9min, p < 0.001) (43, 44). Early defibrillation and CPR are key links in the American Heart Association chain of survival; when considering outcomes of SCA seconds matter (45, 46). To address the need for rapid AED access, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved in-home AED use in 2002, and such devices have been available over-the-counter since 2004 (47). A SMART strategy evolves this concept further, making an ultraportable defibrillator in a pocket-sized device that works with any smartphone, available in any setting.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 771679\nS h a ke r e t a l.\nS M A R T C E A fo r S C A\nF ro n tie rs in C a rd io va sc u la r M e d ic in e |w w w .fro n tie rsin .o rg\n1 1\nF e b ru a ry 2 0 2 2 |V o lu m e 9 |A rtic le 7 7 1 6 7 9\nShaker et al. SMART CEA for SCA\nOur analysis has several limitations. First, the evaluation of a SMART strategy was based on simulated patients, and we did not consider potential benefits of shared SMART devices. However, the use of bystander SMART integrated with smartphone technology would further improve the cost-effectiveness of a SMART approach, as a SMART device could be used within households as well as in other settings (i.e., pulsepoint.org) (48). Secondly, we did not consider improvement in quality of life (and HSU) experienced by patients and their families with the knowledge an AED is available at all times. In fact, rapid access to an AED is highly valued by patients. In one report, patients estimated a high likelihood of SCA survival with the use of an in-home AED (87\u201392%) (49). While the presence of an AED provides reassurance and enhances perceived control over heart disease, it is important to highlight that early access to defibrillation is not a substitute for early effective CPR and rapid access to prehospital emergency medical care (49). Whether or not a patient chooses to have a SMART device available will likely involve a patient-preference centered shared decision-making approach, because such a device may be more appropriate in some circumstances compared to others (50). The device may be better leveraged for individuals who share a home with another individual capable of providing aid, given that in-home arrests are less likely to be witnessed than those that occur in public (51, 52). Third, we assumed less than one-quarter of patients with SCA would have a shockable rhythm, although immediate access to a pocket AED at the time of arrest could increase the likelihood of a shockable rhythm (53). Notably, although older evidence suggests SCA to be associated with a shockable rhythm in up to 84% of cases (54), newer data suggests this rate may be significantly lower (23, 55). Fourth, it is possible hospital costs of SCA care could be higher than base-case estimates. Still, our model accounted for immediate SCA death prior to hospital admission as well as differential costs for those who survived to hospital discharge. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses explored hospital costs to $50,000 for survivors to discharge and $15,000 for patients who died during hospitalization. Fifth, we assumed a 44.7% overall SCA survival rate for patients with a shockable rhythm who received SMART and a 27.9% rate for patients not receiving SMART from published rates of public-access defibrillation (22). It must be acknowledged that variation exists in SCA survival, even with rapid defibrillation. Lastly, at present a pocket smart phone enabled AED is not yet commercially available; however, this device is currently under development and expected to provide rapid ultra-portable access to defibrillation for consumers in the coming years. Similar to prior published health and economic analyses which have evaluated cost-effectiveness of healthcare devices prior to commercial availability, this analysis is leveraged to inform the adoption of emerging technology (56\u201359). The present analysis serves to evaluate the use of not only these devices, but to more widely understand the contemporary health and economic benefits of rapid access to a personal AED."
