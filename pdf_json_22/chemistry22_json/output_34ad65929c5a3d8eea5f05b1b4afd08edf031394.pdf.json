    "abstractText": "Laser-induced fluorescence technology is an effective method for detecting oil pollutants. The laser induced fluorescence detection system was developed, and four parallel microchannel sample pools were designed to improve the detection accuracy of fluorescence signals. The grating scanning system is improved by introducing grating feedback link to improve the wavelength scanning accuracy of the system.The experimental results show that the wavelength scanning resolution of the microchannel laser-induced fluorescence detection system is improved by 0.4 nm. Aiming at the defects of the traditional parallel factor algorithm which is sensitive to the sample components, slow operation speed and easy to fall into local convergence, the generalized inverse singular value decomposition is used to improve the parallel factor algorithm. Configure different concentrations of diesel, gasoline and kerosene solution samples. The experimental verification shows that the excitation-emission spectra of each component obtained by the improved parallel factor algorithm are highly consistent with the measured spectral characteristics, indicating that the microchannel laser-induced fluorescence detection system combined with the improved parallel factor analysis method can accurately identify oil pollutants.

INTRODUCTION Oil pollution is a serious threat to the natural environment and human health. Therefore, the identification and treatment of oil pollution is very important. Petroleumbased substances are composed of aromatic hydrocarbon components and their derivatives with strong fluorescent properties, and the components are complex, and the components and contents of different types of oil are different. The detection methods of petroleum mainly include infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy. Among them, fluorescence analysis technology can obtain more fluorescence information and has the advantages of high accuracy and good selectivity, so it is widely used in the field of oil identification.[1]-[6].\nLaser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technology belongs to an emerging material component analysis technology in the discipline of analytical chemistry[7]-[9]. Compared with other spectral techniques, LIF has the following advantages : LIF is a zero background spectral technique with high sensitivity ( up to 10-12-10-9 M, 5-6 orders of magnitude lower than UV-IR absorption method )[10], [11]. Fluorescence emission is omnidirectional and can be collected from various angles[12]. Due to the large size of the sample cell and low degree of automation of the conventional LIF detection system, microfluidic, as a miniaturized, integrated, high-throughput and low-cost analysis technology[13]-[15], can well solve these problems, and has been widely used in chemistry, biology, medicine, agricultural engineering and other related fields. J. Kim et al. [16] studied a fully automated disposable smart microfluidic\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

On-chip microfluidic flow sensors are integrated with the platform and placed at all inlet and outlet channels, hereby allowing the DIS-\u03bcChip to be fully automated with a pressure control system. Owing to the filmchip technique, the superstrate was disposable and could prevent biological cross-contamination, which cannot be realized with conventional flow sensors. Z.Y. Li et al. [17] developed a simple, sensitive, instrument-free, CRISPRbased diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 using a self-contained microfluidic system, achieving excellent sensitivity (94.1%), specificity (100%), accuracy (95.8%) and improved detection efficiency. J. J. Li et al. [18] proposed a novel microfluidics volume optical monitoring system (MVOMS). Functional channels embedded with hollow cylindrical waveguide (HCW) are integrated in MVOMS, which is convenient to realize the real-time monitoring and manipulating microfluidic. On this basis, they designed an integrated lightdriven microfluidic quantitative sampling system, which can sample a specific volume of microfluidic in microchips automatically and accurately. D.Zaremba et al. [19] present a novel microfluidic system and the small footprint of their system makes it easy to integrate with other structures of microfluidic networks, ensure superior precision, repeatability and flexibility in concentration setting. In this paper, the LIF detection method is closely combined with microfluidic technology, and a microchannel laser-induced fluorescence detection system is developed to achieve highprecision detection of oil pollutants. The parallel factor analysis method in the second-order correction analysis is an effective three-dimensional fluorescence spectral data analysis method. For the measured organic pollutant samples, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the samples are measured by LIF technology, and the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra data are obtained. The parallel factor analysis method is used to realize the quantitative analysis of different components in the samples [20]. D.M. Kong et al. [21] used threedimensional fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis algorithm and pattern recognition method to characterize and classify petroleum pollutants, and compared with the classification models constructed by KNearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, principal component discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) algorithm and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) algorithm, the results showed that the recognition accuracy of the PLS-DA model has the best recognition accuracy, and a reliable method is proposed for effective detection of oil pollutants. B. Liu et al. [22] applied fluorescence excitation emission matrix \u2013 parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis to characterize textile industry wastewater and trace its presence in water bodies. Two protein-like components (C1 and C2) were identified as the source-specific indicators of textile industry wastewater, which was further demonstrated by conducting high-performance size exclusion chromatography analysis. However, the parallel factor analysis must choose\nthe correct group fraction to ensure high resolution accuracy, and the convergence rate is slow in the iterative process. Therefore, based on the trilinear decomposition theory, an improved parallel factor algorithm is proposed, and the generalized inverse inverse singular value decomposition method is used to improve the parallel factor algorithm. In order to improve the detection accuracy of oil pollutants, in terms of hardware structure design, four groups of microchannel sample pools with the same structure were designed by microfluidic technology to enhance the intensity of fluorescence signals. The grating scale feedback grating splitting system is improved, and the grating detection feedback circuit is added to improve the wavelength scanning resolution.After preprocessing such as denoising and scattering for the obtained spectral data, the improved parallel factor analysis method was used to analyze the threedimensional fluorescence spectral data of the measured pollutants, ensuring the resolution of mixed pollutants.

IMPROVEMENT PRINCIPLE OF FOUR-CHANNEL FLU ORESCENCE SPECTRUM DETECTION SYSTEM In this paper, a multi-sample cell parallel structure is design ed, the excitation light excites each sample to be tested, and the fluorescence generated by them is collected at the same time. The specific mechanism is shown in Figure 2.\nThe size of each sample cell in Figure 2 is the same, and t he solution to be measured is the same. Where l is the solu tion transmitted light path, c is the concentration of the sol ution,  is the absorption coefficient of the fluorescent sub stance in solution, 0I is the incident light intensity, tI is t he transmitted light intensity, FY is the fluorescence quantu\nm yield, The fluorescence intensity ifI is proportional to\ntII -0 and fluorescence quantum yield FY is the same as (3).\n- 0 0( ) (1 10 )     clfi F t FI Y I I Y I (3)\nExpanding the exponential term in the above formula, the fluorescence emission intensity can be expressed as\n2 3\n0 (2.3 ) (2.3 )(2.3 ) 2! 3!     fi F cl clI Y I cl\n(4)\nWhen the solution concentration is very thin, 0.05cl  , the higher order term in the formula can be omitted, and the fluorescence emission intensity fiI increases with the increase of the molar concentration of the light absorbing material c , and it is linear. Then the formula (4) can be simplified to :\nclIYI Ffi 03.2 (5) The (5) formula shows that the emission fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent material is related to the transmission path l of the excitation light in the sample cell.

In this paper, changing the transmitted optical path l is taken as a breakthrough point to enhance the fluorescence intensity, but increasing the transmitted optical path l increases the nonlinearity between the fluorescence intensity and the solution concentration. Therefore, in this paper, four sample cells were designed for parallel excitation by microchannel processing technology to detect the fluorescence spectrum, and the fluorescence generated by them was collected. The transmitted light path of the excitation light of each sample satisfies an approximate linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the solution concentration. As shown in Eq. (6), when n is 4, the fluorescence intensity is correspondingly increased by 4 times. It can be seen that the sensitivity of the fluorescence detection system can be improved by parallel excitation of multiple sample cells.\nIII.

            "text": "Most of the detection cells of conventional fluorescence spectrophotometers use the standard quartz cuvette as the experimental sample container. Y.Y. Yuan et al. [26] used the excitation emission matrix fluorescence method to simultaneously determine the pesticide residues of carbendazim and chlorothalonil in peanut oil. The sample cell of the FS920 fluorescence spectrum detection system was also a quartz cuvette. The size of the sample pool is large, the reagent consumption is large, and only manual sampling, the degree of automation is not high. The microchannel sample cell designed based on the mechanism of fluorescence detection is of great significance to realize the accurate detection of the measured object. Micromachining technology enables the miniaturization, integration, miniaturization and automation of products. At the same time, in order to increase the signal intensity, four groups of small sample pools with the same structure were used to realize the detection of petroleum pollutants. The quartz glass parallel microchannel sample cell structure is adopted, is shown in Figure 4. The sample enters the microchannel from the in entrance, and when overflowing from the out entrance, it can be ensured that the sample is filled with the entire microchannel sample cell. The excitation light is divided into four beams I0 by the spectroscopic system, and the four microchannel samples are excited respectively. After the emission spectrum If1 - If4 is aggregated, the total spectral signal is obtained. The parallel excitation of multiple microchannel samples can improve the fluorescence spectral signal intensity and the sensitivity of spectral signal detection. Specified micro-channel structures were fabricated by femtosecond laser in quartz glass. The processing flow of the\nmicrofluidic sample cell is shown in Figure 5. Rotating coating on the surface of quartz glass substrate and the photographic plate printing is used to carve photoresist according to CAD drawings. The whole immersed tube pattern is displayed and dried. Finally, the sample system is formed by ion bonding on the quartz glass substrate. Microvalves are added at the liquid inlet of each injection system to control the liquid on and off. Femtosecond laser processing and modified quartz glass microchannels are porous and loose, which can be further corroded by hydrofluoric acid. The modified loose material is corroded and presents a complete microchannel. After calcination at 1000\u2103 for 30 minutes, the surface inside the microchannel is smooth to achieve mirror effect. In order to solve the defect that the concentration of the microchannel system does not change quickly, a Christmas tree-shaped concentration gradient generator[27], [28] was used to explore the appropriate flow rate of microfluidics and form a good linear, stable and controllable concentration gradient. Combined with the improved four-channel fluorescence spectrum detection system, the transient change of the concentration of oil pollutants are reliably reflected in the flow and measurement.\n(a)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In order to avoid the above shortcomings of the parallel factor algorithm, the iterative process of the parallel factor algorithm is improved by the principle of alternating least squares. The improvements are as follows: 1) Aiming at the iterative convergence process of the algorithm, the additive inverse singular value decomposition method in generalized inverse is adopted. Firstly, the iterative convergence error is set. When the singular value is less than the preset error value, it will be treated as 0. Even if the selected group fraction is greater than the actual group fraction, the results are not affected, It shows the robustness of the algorithm when there is interference to components.\n2) Three closely related but not completely equivalent objective functions are established, and the three objective functions are iterated simultaneously.

The maximum excitation and emission wavelengths of component 2 were 400/415 nm, respectively, indicating the spectral characteristics of 0#diese. The maximum excitation and emission wavelengths of component 3 were 280/460 nm, respectively, indicating the spectral characteristics of common kerosene. The predicted concentrations and Average recovery rate of three components in 23-30 samples obtained by improved parallel factor analysis are listed in table 3. The results show that the improved parallel factor method can not only identify the specific components of micro-content in the mixed solution samples, but also quantitatively determine the concentration of each component.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The maximum excitation emission wavelength of component 2 is 395/435 nm, which shows the spectral characteristics of 97# gasoline. The maximum excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of component 3 were 400/410 nm, showing the spectral characteristics of 93# gasoline. The maximum excitation emission wavelength of component 4 is 380/400 nm, which\nshows the spectral characteristics of -10# diesel. The aromatic hydrocarbon substances contained in 97# gasoline and 93# gasoline are similar, so their characteristic spectra are similar. But 97# gasoline will produce multiple fluorescence peaks and the fluorescence phenomenon is obvious, so component 2 is 97# gasoline, component 3 is 93# gasoline. The predicted concentrations and average recovery rate of the four-component samples predicted from the predicted samples are shown in Table 4.\nIn order to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the i mproved method in this paper in the real environment, We co llected samples from the sewage outlet of petrochemical plan\nts, and a solution of carbon tetrachloride and oil pollutants w as prepared. The ratio of the oil substance and the carbon tetr achloride was 1: 1000, which was used to gradually dilute 30 samples with different concentrations.

The excitatio n spectrum range of the microchannel fluorescence spectrosc opy experimental system is set to 230-500 nm, the emission s pectrum range is set to 250-650 nm, and the width of the entr ance slit and the exit slit is 2 mm. The improved parallel factor analysis was performed on the measured samples to obtain the three-dimensional fluorescen ce spectra of the oil-bearing species. The fluorescence peak p osition of the three oils is shown in Table 6. As shown in Fig ure 22, 23 and 24. The maximum excitation and emission wa velengths of component 1 were 350/430 nm, respectively, in dicating the spectral characteristics of kerosene. The maximu m excitation and emission wavelengths of component 2 were 290/350 nm, respectively, indicating the spectral characterist ics of 0#diese. The maximum excitation and emission wavele ngths of component 3 were 450/520 and 470/520 nm, respect ively, indicating the spectral characteristics of common 97# g asoline. It is verified that the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum obtained by the analysis corresponds to the fluoresc ence peak range of the three oils measured in the laboratory a nd compared with the data measured by the water quality res earch center of petrochemical company, the concentration err or is smaller, which verified the effectiveness and accuracy o f the improved parallel factor analysis method in the identific ation of real oil pollutants.\nTABLE 6.

            "text": "In this paper, a fluorescence detection system with fourchannel sample cell structure was developed and the grating spectrophotometer system was improved. Compared with the accuracy of traditional fluorescence spectrophotometer, the sensitivity of fluorescence detection and wavelength scanning resolution were improved. The parallel factor algorithm is improved by the generalized inverse inverse singular value decomposition method. With the CCl4 solution of gasoline, diesel and kerosene as the research objects, the excitation-emission matrix spectral data and threedimensional fluorescence spectra of different samples were\nobtained. The improved parallel factor analysis algorithm was used to separate the fluorescence spectrum data of diesel, gasoline and kerosene mixed solution samples, and the identification of different petroleum components in the mixed solution samples was completed. The experimental results show that compared with the F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer, the improved microchannel fluorescence spectrum detection system can obtain stronger oil fluorescence signals, so as to characterize more fluorescence information, which is convenient for the qualitative and quantitative research of different oil types in the future.
