A passive seismic experiment is carried out at the non-volcanic highly degassing site of Mefite d’Ansanto located at the northern tip of the Irpinia region (southern Italy), where the 1980 MS 6.9 destructive earthquake occurred. Between 2020 and 2021, background seismic noise was recorded by deploying a broadband seismic station and a seismic array composed of seven 1 Hz three-component sensors. Using two different array configurations, we were allowed to explore in detail the 1–20 Hz frequency band of the seismic noise wavefield as well as Rayleigh wave phase velocities in the 400–800 m/s range. Spectral analyses and array techniques were applied to one year of data showing that the frequency content of the signal is very stable in time. High frequency peaks are likely linked to the emission source, whereas at low frequencies seismic noise is clearly correlated to meteorological parameters. The results of this study show that small aperture seismic arrays probe the subsurface of tectonic CO2-rich emission areas and contribute to the understanding of the link between fluid circulation and seismogenesis in seismically active regions. 1. conclusions In this paper, we describe the seismic survey that was carried out at the non-volcanic CO2 degassing Mefite d’Ansanto site located at the northern tip of the Irpinia extensional fault system (MS 6.9) in southern Italy, and we give a first insight in the local seismic noise wavefield by computing RMS, spectral and array analyses. The clear link between seismic noise and CO2 emissions from a cold and thermal spring in southern Italy points out the importance of investigating in more detail the mutual interaction of seismogenic sources and fluid reservoirs at depth.
