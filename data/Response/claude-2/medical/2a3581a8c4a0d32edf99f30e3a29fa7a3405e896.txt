 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Validate the findings in other populations beyond sub-Saharan VFR travelers, such as travelers from non-endemic areas, immigrants, or residents of endemic regions. This could determine if the RDT patterns hold true across different groups. 

2. Investigate the kinetics of HRP-2 and pLDH antigenemia after parasite clearance to better understand the duration of detectable antigens after infection. This could help interpret RDT results in different transmission settings.

3. Explore combinations of clinical factors with RDT patterns to develop improved predictive models for estimating parasitemia levels. Factors like symptoms, vital signs, travel history could be combined with RDT results.

4. Compare performance of different RDT brands and formats to see if certain tests have improved correlation with parasitemia levels. Newer tests could potentially be optimized. 

5. Conduct interventional trials using RDT-guided anti-malarial therapy protocols. This could evaluate the clinical outcomes of using RDT patterns to determine medication doses or admission decisions.
