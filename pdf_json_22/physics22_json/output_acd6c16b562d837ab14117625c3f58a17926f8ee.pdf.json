    "abstractText": "The paper describes profile broadening and peak wavelength variation of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured for 46 lines of sight, probably caused by the physical properties of intervening clouds. The full width at half-maximum of four studied DIBs (5780, 5797, 6196 and 6614 \u00c5) demonstrates strong variability, sometimes doubling the widths of the features. Despite the high magnitude of the effect, our current analysis is restricted to the strongest DIBs because the weaker ones require a much higher signal-to-noise ratio. The profile broadening in the studied DIBs moves the profile\u2019s centres towards longer wavelengths, probably due to the excitation of higher levels of the P branch of the unknown molecular carrier. Moreover, DIBs are broader in clouds with abundantly populated vibrationally excited states of hydrogen molecules; that is, the broadening of DIBs correlates with the rotational temperature estimated on the H2 \u03bd = 2 vibrational level. However, objects that demonstrate extremely broadened profiles of DIBs are scarce. The extreme peculiarity of the DIB profiles was detected in Herschel 36. Here we show the gradual growths of the widths of DIBs, confirmed in spectra from different instruments.",

Overall, it addresses the scientifically very challenging issue of identifying (very likely molecular) carriers of the puzzling spectral features known, for nearly 100 yr, as diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). See Kre\u0142owski (2018) for a recent review. The only almost-confirmed carrier of a few near-infrared DIBs is fullerene C+60 (Campbell et al. 2015) but the variability of the intensity ratio of features, assigned to this molecule, has yet to be explained (Galazutdinov et al. 2017, 2020; Galazutdinov & Kre\u0142owski 2017).\nDIBs are believed to be carried by complex chemical species, including prebiotic ones, synthesized and preserved in the hostile conditions of translucent interstellar clouds. The idea of their molecular origin is supported by the presence of substructures inside DIB profiles, discovered by Sarre et al. (1995) and Kerr et al. (1998); for weak DIBs, see Galazutdinov, LoCurto & Kre\u0142owski (2008), and for broad DIBs, see Galazutdinov et al. (2020). A vast majority of DIBs are narrow (though much broader than atomic lines), shallow features so an analysis of their profile shapes requires a very high resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. High-precision DIB profiles may play a decisive role in the identification of the carrier. However, the studied line of sight must demonstrate the lack of Doppler splitting in lines of interstellar atoms and simple radicals to secure\nE-mail: runizag@gmail.com\nthe intrinsic profile of a DIB. There are more than 200 molecular species discovered (mostly in radio) due to rotational transitions; a vast majority of these are carbon-bearing (organic) species. The list of DIBs, seen in absorption, has now reached \u223c560 entries (Fan et al. 2019).\nExperiments show that the spectra of suspected molecules contain usually one strong and several weak features. It is very challenging to relate weak DIBs to strong ones and thus to divide them into \u2018families\u2019, likely sharing the same carrier. Their profiles can vary with temperature (kinetic and rotational) in a way that is characteristic of a given species. Changes of profiles may lead to different central wavelengths. It is important to relate DIB profiles (their widths, substructure patterns and intensities) to relative abundances of CH, CH+, CN and the rotational temperatures of the C2 and C3 molecular species \u2013 and perhaps also to that of CN. DIB carriers are not known, so any relation with other measurable interstellar parameters/features may give us a clue about the origin of these features.\nThe results published during the last two decades (e.g. Kre\u0142owski & Greenberg 1999; Galazutdinov, Manico\u0301 & Kre\u0142owski 2006; Galazutdinov et al. 2008; Kre\u0142owski et al. 2015) demonstrate redshifts and blueshifts of some DIBs in relation to atomic lines (i.e. not caused by the Doppler effect) as well as changes of their profiles, which vary from one specific environment to another. This was already supported by the discovery of a relation between the rotational temperatures of the simplest carbon chains and the profile shape of the 6196 DIB (Kaz\u0301mierczak et al. 2009).\nKaz\u0301mierczak et al. (2010) reported that the width and shape of the 6196 and 5797 \u00c5 DIB profiles depend on the gas kinetic\nC\u00a9 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/508/3/4241/6408734 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nand rotational temperatures of the C2 molecule; the profiles are broader because of the higher values of temperature. However, this phenomenon is not common for all DIBs; for example, the features of the 4964 and 5850 \u00c5 DIBs do not exhibit detectable broadening.\nIn a vast majority of cases, one can observe reddened stars through several clouds threaded on their sightlines. This leads to ill-defined averages, which closely resemble each other. However, if a star is seen through a single cloud, its interstellar spectrum looks \u2018peculiar\u2019. Such spectra are especially interesting as they are apparently formed in a specific volume (i.e. in reasonably homogeneous physical conditions). This concerns, for example, the above-mentioned wavelength shifts. The latter are especially evident in the unique object, Herschel 36 (Dahlstrom et al. 2013; Oka et al. 2013). The DIBs in its spectrum exhibit extremely uncommon profiles, in particular showing extended red wings. Identified interstellar lines, as shown by Dahlstrom et al., are sharp and free of Doppler splitting. Several DIB profiles, observed along the specific sightline (to Herschel 36), show unusually broadened profiles (e.g. the major 5780 DIB).\nThe presence of substructures in profiles of DIBs is the common property that can be useful for identifying their origin by comparing astrophysical data with laboratory gas phase spectra, such as for example the carbon chains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; Salama et al. 1999; Motylewski et al. 2000).\nIt is important to check the behaviour of identified and unidentified interstellar spectral features, especially if they are observed in single clouds, where the physical conditions are as homogeneous as possible. Such sightlines should be carefully selected and confirmed by atomic/molecular lines, seen in high-resolution spectra, as free of Doppler splitting."

Usually we use the K I 7699 \u00c5 and CH 4300 \u00c5 lines. The intensity of these lines generally demonstrates good correlation with those of DIBs. However, we have to emphasize that with increasing spectral resolution one can resolve additional Doppler components in atomic and/or molecular lines; in DIBs, it becomes very difficult, and impossible in the case of extinction or polarization (caused by dust grains). Nevertheless, the variability of the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of DIBs reported in this study is not caused by the presence of several clouds with different radial velocities.\nThe observational data have been collected using several highresolution, echelle spectrographs, as follows.\n(i) The Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) is fed by the 8-m Kueyen VLT mirror (Dekker et al. 2000). The spectral resolution is up to R = 80 000 in the blue range and R = 110 000 in the red range. The telescope size allows us to obtain high S/N ratio spectra of even faint stars. The selected spectra have been collected in the frame of the Large Program ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES) and our previous study (Siebenmorgen et al. 2020), where we provide online access to the analysed UVES data.1\n(ii) Some southern objects were studied with the aid of FEROS, a fibre-fed echelle spectrograph (Kaufer et al. 1999) at the ESO\u2019s La Silla observatory in Chile. FEROS provides the resolving power R \u2261\n1https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A+A/641/A35\n\u03bb/ \u03bb of 48 000 and allows us to obtain the whole available spectral range (\u223c3700\u20139200 \u00c5, divided into 37 orders) recorded in a single exposure.\n(iii) The Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars (the ESPaDOnS spectrograph)2 is the bench-mounted highresolution echelle spectrograph/spectropolarimeter attached to the 3.58-m Canada\u2013France\u2013Hawaii telescope (CFHT) at Mauna Kea (Hawaii, USA). It is designed to obtain a complete optical spectrum in the range from 3700 to 10 050 \u00c5. The whole spectrum is divided into 40 echelle orders. The resolving power is about 68 000.\n(iv) The CFHT coude\u0301 spectrograph (Gecko)3 is an echelle spectrograph optimized for use with a single spectral order from the 316 groove mm\u22121 echellette mosaic and provides resolving power \u03bb/ \u03bb up to 120 000. Order sorting is achieved with interference filters or by one of three variable grisms. An image slicer is used to optimize the throughput of the instrument.\n(v) The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) is a spectrograph fed by the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla observatory with resolving power R = 115 000 (Mayor et al. 2003).\n(vi) The Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph (Bernstein et al. 2003) is fed by the Magellan/Clay telescope. The spectral resolution with a 0.35 \u00d7 5 arcsec2 slit ranges from \u223c56 000 on the blue side (3600\u20135000 \u00c5) to \u223c77 000 on the red side (4800\u2013 9400 \u00c5).\n(vii) The Bohyunsan Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) of the Korean National Observatory (Kim et al. 2007) is installed at the 1.8-m telescope of the Bohyunsan Observatory in Korea. The spectrograph has three observational modes allowing resolving powers of 30 000, 45 000 and 90 000. In any mode, the spectrograph covers the whole spectral range of \u223c3500 to \u223c10 000 \u00c5, divided into 75\u201376 spectral orders.\n(viii) The Sandiford Cassegrain Echelle Spectrometer (McCarthy et al. 1993) is fed by the 2.1-m Otto Struve Telescope at the McDonald Observatory (Texas, USA). The instrument has a resolving power R = 60 000 for two CCD pixels and provides continuous wavelength coverage below 8000 \u00c5.\nWe processed raw data and made measurements in the reduced spectra with our interactive analysis software DECH.4 For the DECH data reduction, we averaged bias images for subsequent correction of all other images. The scattered light was determined as a complexshaped two-dimensional (2D) surface function, which is individually calculated for each stellar and flat-field frame by a 2D cubic spline approximation over areas of minima between the spectral orders. Then, the pixel-to-pixel variations across the CCD were corrected by dividing all stellar frames by the averaged and normalized flatfield frame. One-dimensional stellar spectra were extracted by simple summation in the cross-dispersion direction along the width of each spectral order. The extracted spectra of the same object, observed in the same night, were averaged to achieve the highest S/N ratio. Fiducial continuum normalization was based on a cubic spline interpolation over the interactively selected anchor points."

Measurements of FWHM (km s\u22121) of 5780, 5797, 6614 and 6196 DIBs and the mid-points of FWHM (\u03bbcen) are given in the same table. All DIBs exhibit more or less significant variability of the profile widths (Tables 1 and 2). However, our sample is statistically significant, so the inferred relations are important.\nThe two oldest-known DIBs, 5780 and 5797, have been demonstrated as being of different origin (Kre\u0142owski & Walker 1987; Kre\u0142owski & Westerlund 1988). Their varying strength ratio allows us to divide the interstellar clouds into \u03c3 and \u03b6 types. Some of profiles of DIB 5780 are shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating the \u2018peculiar\u2019 behaviour of the feature in certain objects. The depicted profiles represent extreme \u03c3 or \u03b6 types, i.e. the 5780/5797 strength ratio is very high or low. Apparently, the same DIB may be narrower or broader (depending on the line of sight); because the depicted targets do not show a strong Doppler split in the interstellar K I line, this must be caused by physical parameters of the intervening objects.\nAmong the observed objects, we can see evident positive correlation between the FWHM and the \u03bbcen depicted in Fig. 2. Three of the objects increase their width propagating towards longer wavelengths, probably due to the excitation of higher and higher levels of the P branch of the unknown molecular carrier. The same effect is also evident for the 6196 DIB (see Fig. 3) but its extended red wing in most of the cases does not reach the 50 per cent depth of the feature (see below). Therefore, the mid-point of the FWHM is almost stationary and the resulting formal correlation is low (R = 0.22; see Fig. 2).\nA particular problem is the so-called blueshift of some DIBs reported for HD 34078 and several stars in the Sco OB1 association\n(Galazutdinov et al. 2006, 2008; Kre\u0142owski et al. 2019a). The blueshift does not resemble the redshift effect; that is, it is not an extension of the profile\u2019s blue wing but rather is a displacement of the entire profile (see e.g. fig. 5 in Kre\u0142owski et al. 2019a). We suggest that the blueshift may have a surprisingly simple explanation. The \u2018interstellar\u2019 wavelength scale based on the strongest component of the CH 4300 or K I 7698 line might be slightly incorrect for these objects. Indeed, all objects demonstrating the blueshift also exhibit some weak component in the left side of their CH and/or K I profile. At the moment, there are very few known objects with evident blueshift of DIB profiles, and thus the extension of the sample is necessary for a decisive identification of the origin of the blueshift.\nTable 1 contains data of the central wavelength measured for the 5780, 5797, 6614 and 6196 DIBs as well as their FWHMs. This \u03bbcen is evidently variable (see Fig. 1). Moreover, the width of the 5797, 5780 and 6614 DIBs increases to a longer wavelength side, which is shown in the gradual move of \u03bbcen to the red when increasing the width of DIBs.\nAn additional effect, the central wavelengths of DIBs moving to the right (redshift), is observed in some targets. An example is shown in Fig. 4. A vast majority of DIBs are very weak in the spectra of stars such as HD 37903 with low or moderate reddening magnitude. Only the relatively broad DIBs, such as 5780 and 6284, remain strong; and they are also redshifted. The redshift phenomenon is observable only in these broad DIBs. The central wavelengths of the weak narrow DIBs seem even to be slightly blueshifted. Figure 4 demonstrates the DIB positions in the heliocentric radial velocity scale, compared with the interstellar CH (4300.3 \u00c5) line.\nThe rest of the narrow DIBs are most likely broadened though not shifted. However, narrow DIBs in the extreme \u03c3 type objects are so weak that any conclusions concerning them must be considered as hardly reliable. A much higher S/N ratio would be of great importance.\n4 MO L E C U L A R H Y D RO G E N\nGnacin\u0301ski, Weselak & Kre\u0142owski (2016) analysed the correlation between the temperature of H2 and the equivalent widths of some DIBs normalized by the total amount of interstellar hydrogen EW(DIB)/N(H). It was shown that in most cases the EW(DIB)/N(H) and temperatures are anticorrelated. Here we focus on the comparison of the temperature of molecular hydrogen with the peak wavelength variation and broadening of DIBs.\nThe H2 absorption lines from vibrationally excited levels can be seen in some Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet spectra. We used the temperatures of para-H2 on the \u03bd = 2 vibrational level, calculated using linearization of the Boltzmann equation and linear regression as described by Gnacin\u0301ski (2011). These temperatures are presented in Table 3.\nThe cloud heliocentric radial Doppler velocities of the H2 lines agree with those of atomic K I lines seen in the UVES spectra. Usually the Doppler velocities of simple radicals (CH, CN) coincide with those of K I; thus, we suggest that DIB carriers are occupying same volumes as the above-mentioned species.\nIt is interesting that the differences in the widths of DIBs are not caused by the gas kinetic temperature, which is correlated with the hydrogen T01 temperature. The T01 temperature originally defined by Spitzer, Dressler & Upson (1964), describes the equilibrium between ortho and para-H2 and is calculated using\nN1\nN0 = 9e[\u2212(E1\u2212E0)]/kT01 (1)\nMNRAS 508, 4241\u20134248 (2021)\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/508/3/4241/6408734 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nFigure 2.

The temperature T01 observed towards HD 27778 is only 55 K. Despite the lack of direct correlation between the DIB\u2019s FWHM and the gas kinetic temperature in the 6196 DIB (Fig. 3), the broadening of the line profile is seen mainly for stars with the highest T para\u03bd=2 temperatures: HD 37061 and HD 37903. In both of these objects, the 6196 DIB profile shows the extended red wing.\nTwo comparison stars, HD 147888 and HD 185418, show nearly unbroadened profiles of the diffuse interstellar bands. Both stars have UVES and HST high dispersion spectra. We have used HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra o59s01010 and o59s01020 to check the presence of H2 lines from vibrationally excited levels in the direction towards HD 147888. For another comparison star, HD 185418, we used the spectra ob2609010, ob2609020, o5c01q010 and obkr1q010. In the direction of both stars, no H2 absorption lines from vibrationally excited levels were detected. The H2 is present towards both comparison stars on the ground vibrational level. The column densities of the \u03bd = 0 H2 rotational levels towards these stars were adopted from Jensen et al. (2010).\nThe FWHMs of the 5780 DIB in both comparison stars are about \u223c100\u2013110 km s\u22121, which is smaller than that in \u2018peculiar\u2019 targets (Tables 1 and 2). Consequently, the broadening of the 6614 and 6203 DIBs (Figs 5 and 6) is larger for HD 37061 than for HD 37903. The cloud towards HD 37061 has the highest T para\u03bd=2 temperature in our\nFigure 6.

Therefore, Fig. 8 cannot be used to estimate the peak wavelength variation of DIBs, \u03bbcen, but only to compare the width and shape of DIBs.\n6 C O N C L U S I O N S\nThe 5780, 5797, 6196, 6203 and 6614 DIBs are formed along the lines of sight where vibrationally excited levels of H2 are abundantly populated, which may lead to extended red wings. The broad DIBs (e.g. 5780, 6284) are also shifted to the red. The observed DIB broadening cannot be explained by the unresolved blend of many components originating in different clouds (Fig. 9).\nWe emphasize that the lack of correlation between the FWHM and the central wavelength for DIB 6196 (Fig. 2) does not imply that a broadening effect of this DIB does not exist. For example, the extended red wing of DIB 6196, in most cases, does not reach the 50 per cent depth (Fig. 3). Therefore, the mid-point of the FWHM of\nthat band is almost stationary and so is the derived central wavelength, despite the evident broadening.\nWhat really causes the broadening and redshift of DIB profiles? The answer cannot be given before comprehensive identification of the carriers of DIBs. There are several possible reasons for the broadening of DIBs (mostly extending the red wing of the profile), as follows.\n(i) First of all, the observed variations in the profiles of the DIBs cannot be caused by thermal Doppler broadening because the observed broadening is not symmetric. Only the long wavelength side of the profile is extended. Also, the observed broadening cannot be explained by Doppler splitting (Fig. 9).\n(ii) The widths (FWHMs) of the 5780, 6196, 6203 and 6614 DIBs are broadened in clouds where the vibrationally excited levels of molecular hydrogen are populated. The widths of these DIBs are larger for directions with larger T para\u03bd=2 temperatures. However, the hydrogen temperature T01 does not correlate with DIB broadening while the kinetic temperature of C2 does (Kaz\u0301mierczak et al. 2010). Indeed, DIB profiles may become broad, influenced by the rotational temperatures of homonuclear molecules, such as C2 as shown by Kaz\u0301mierczak et al. (2009, 2010) for the 6196 and 5797 DIBs and the gas kinetic and rotational temperatures of the C2 molecule. Unfortunately, the bands of the C3 molecule are usually below the level of detection in our spectra and thus the possible correlation between the kinetic and rotational temperatures of C3 and the width of DIBs cannot be studied with the available data. Oka et al. (2013) offered to consider a possible reason for broadening and redshift in terms of rotational excitation of relatively small polar molecules. Marshall, Kre\u0142owski & Sarre (2015) considered variations of DIB 6614 and offered an interpretation founded in terms of the population distribution among the rotational, vibrational and potentially lowlying electronic states of a medium-sized (NC \u223c 20) planar PAHtype molecule. The profile may depend on the presence of low-lying vibrational/vibronic states of the carrier molecule, i.e. on whether these transitions are significantly wavelength-shifted from the origin band.\n(iii) H2 vibrationally excited levels are populated by fluorescence. The broadenings of DIBs may also be caused by fluorescently populated levels. An additional broader discussion was given in Kre\u0142owski et al. (2015) where the origin of the redshift, observed in two Orion B1 association stars HD 37020 and HD 37022, was discussed. Both targets are included in the current sample;\n(iv) Another interesting idea is a connection between the behaviour of profiles of DIBs and shapes of extinction curves. Redshift and broadening in molecular electronic bands might be caused by the molecules attaching to a solid substrate (e.g. Tielens & Allamandola 1987). In an environment rich in dust particles, possibly some DIB carriers can also partially attach to grain surfaces, producing what we observe in the broadened DIB profiles and in the shapes of extinction curves.\nDespite of the lack of a decisive explanation of the redshift phenomenon, the observed broadening of DIBs can be used as an additional criterion for grouping these features into families, presumably formed by the same molecule. The use of redshifts or blueshifts, observed in some DIBs, for the same purposes is not so straightforward because the atomic (molecular) lines serving as reference points for the interstellar wavelength frame and the carriers of DIBs may be occupying different parts of an interstellar cloud.\nMNRAS 508, 4241\u20134248 (2021)\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/508/3/4241/6408734 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nAC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nJK, RH and WS acknowledge financial support from the Polish National Science Centre (grant UMO-2017/25/B/ST9/01524 for the period 2018\u20132021).
