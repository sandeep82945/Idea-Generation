Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and associated protein (Cas) systems are increasingly being used for clinical diagnostic applications, due to their high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity. We\u00a0developed a sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-CRISPR/Cas13a detection method (CRISPR-MTB) and then evaluated its performance in detecting MTB in clinical specimens.\nMethods: The conserved MTB IS1081 sequence was used to design CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) and T7 promoter sequencing-containing PCR primers for use in the CRISPR-MTB assay, then assay performance was evaluated using 401 clinical specimens.\nResults: The CRISPR-MTB assay provided a low limit of detection of 1 target sequence copy/\u03bcL and excellent specificity. Furthermore, use of the assay to detect MTB in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), sputum and pus samples provided superior sensitivity (261/268, 97.4%) as compared to sensitivities of acid-fast bacilli (130/268, 48.5%) and mycobacterial culture (192/268, 71.6%) assays, and comparable or greater sensitivity to that of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (260/268, 97.0%).\nConclusion: The CRISPR-MTB assay, which provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for MTB detection in sputum, BALF and pus samples, is a viable alternative to conventional tests used to diagnose TB in resource-limited settings.\nKEYWORDS\ntuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB), GeneXpert MTB/RIF, CRISPR, PCR, diagnosis\nIntroduction\nTuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex, remains one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide, with an estimated 1.6 million TB deaths in 2021 (World Health Organization, 2022).

These undiagnosed cases act as a reservoir that fuels ongoing TB transmission that is hindering efforts towards meeting the ultimate goal of global TB eradication (Pai et\u00a0al., 2016).\nCurrently, TB detection and diagnosis are based on clinical symptoms, radiologic abnormalities and laboratory test results. However, smear microscopy to detect tubercle bacilli, a century-old test that continues to be\u00a0widely used for TB diagnosis worldwide, does not provide adequate sensitivity when used to test specimens obtained from children, HIV-infected individuals and extrapulmonary TB cases. Despite its status as a gold standard TB diagnostic test, mycobacterial culture testing of sputum specimens takes several weeks to complete, due to the intrinsic slow growth characteristics of tubercle bacilli (Miller et\u00a0al., 1994). Hence, due to the abovementioned drawbacks of currently used tests, better tests are needed to facilitate early diagnosis of active TB cases. Recent technological advances have facilitated development of molecular diagnostic assays that have enabled more rapid, specific sensitive detection of Mycobacterial tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli in patient specimens. Several of these assays have been endorsed by the World Health Organization for use in initial diagnostic testing of suspected TB cases, such as Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP). However, the cost per test of such assays, which can be\u00a0>20-times higher than that of smear microscopy, has hindered efforts to scale up such testing in low-income countries, warranting the development of less expensive and more accurate molecular diagnostic assays to identify active TB cases in resourcelimited settings.\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) systems have been used increasingly for clinical diagnostic applications, due to their high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity (Yan et\u00a0al., 2019). These novel methods can efficiently detect pathogens in human specimens by converting target nucleic acid sequences into fluorescent signals. For example, the CRISPR/Cas12abased platform has already been used to diagnose TB and other infectious diseases (Xiao et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2021; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2021; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2022; Lei et\u00a0al., 2022). Meanwhile, another CRISPR/Cas system based on Cas13a, an RNA-guided RNA-targeting endonuclease, holds great promise as a molecular diagnostic platform. In fact, by combining Cas13a collateral RNase cleavage with molecular amplification, Zhang and colleagues established a CRISPR/Cas13a-based platform that has already been shown to detect specific viruses with attomolar-scale sensitivity and single-base specificity (Gootenberg et\u00a0al., 2017; Kellner et\u00a0al., 2019). However, to our knowledge, the diagnostic efficacy of this platform when used to detect tubercle bacilli has not yet been assessed in clinical practice.\nIn this study, we\u00a0aimed to develop a CRISPR/Cas13-based diagnostic assay (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-MTB) for use in detecting MTB bacilli in TB patient specimens. The diagnostic performance of the proposed assay was then evaluated using multiple types of clinical specimens obtained from patients with TB and other respiratory diseases."

(Shanghai, China). The Cas13a protein used in this study, LwCas13a, was expressed and purified according to instructions provided by Professor Zhang of the Academy of Military Sciences Beijing, China (Gootenberg et\u00a0al., 2017). LwCas13a protein was quantified according to instructions provided with the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Aliquots of purified LwCas13a protein were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nNucleic acid and crRNAs preparation\nThe conserved MTB insertion element IS1081 that was selected for use as the target of the MTB-detection assay was cloned into the pUC57 vector to construct recombinant plasmids. After recombinant plasmids were confirmed as correct via sequencing, they were purified using an EasyPure\u00ae HiPure Plasmid MaxiPrep Kit (TransGen Biotech, China). Next, plasmid DNA was quantified based on optical density measurements conducted at 260 nm, then DNA copy number was calculated using the formula (6.02 \u00d7 1023) \u00d7 (ng/\u03bcl \u00d7 10\u22129)/(DNA length \u00d7 660) = DNA copy number/\u03bcl. The crRNA template was an 84-base-pair single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) consisting of the T7 promoter sequence, repeat sequence and target sequence. To prepare crRNA, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was amplified using the 84-base-pair ssDNA template and its flanking primers\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\n(Supplementary Table S1). After DNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), the dsDNA product was transcribed overnight at 37\u00b0C to generate crRNA using the HiScribe\u00ae T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Thereafter, the transcription product was treated with DNase I\u00a0at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to degrade the dsDNA template, then the final crRNA product was purified using an Agencourt RNAClean XP kit (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions."

            "text": "We developed a highly sensitive and simple MTB-detection assay, with steps of this method presented in Figure\u00a01. First, the target sequence (MTP IS1081) was amplified via PCR, during which the T7 promoter sequence was attached to 5\u2032 ends of the PCR products. Next, the doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) amplicon was transcribed to generate singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) using T7 RNA polymerase. Thereafter, the ssRNA, under guidance of crRNA, was recognised and bound by Cas13a, which triggered collateral RNase cleavage of the reporter RNA molecule that resulted in release of fluorescent groups into the reaction solution. Significantly enhanced fluorescence indicated the presence of the target gene.\nWe selected the MTB-specific insertion sequence IS1081 as the target sequence, since this insertion sequence is present in multiple copies per genome, thus improving MTB-detection sensitivity. We\u00a0then screened five candidate crRNAs (Supplementary Table S2) that targeted different rIS1081 sequences in order to select the crRNAs that produced the most intense fluorescence signal, as assessed using an ABI7500 fluorescence detector. The results (Figure\u00a02A) revealed that the IS1081-b crRNA candidate provided greater fluorescence signal strength than signal strengths of the other four crRNAs.\nIn order to determine the analytical sensitivity of the CRISPR/ Cas13a assay, a plasmid containing the IS1081 insertion sequence was used as a template, then the template was serially diluted to generate dilutions for limit of detection (LOD) evaluation. The results showed that an MTB DNA copy number as low as one copy per test could be\u00a0detected after 10 min of PCR amplification using the IS1081-b crRNA (Figure\u00a02B).\nTo confirm assay specificity, genomic DNA from human cells, M. tuberculosis (MTB) isolates and the MTB BCG strain, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM, including M. kansasii, M. abscessus, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. gordonae, and M. fortuitum) or other bacteria (E. coli, S. globisporus) were tested using the CRISPR-MTB assay. As shown in Figure\u00a02C, only MTB and BCG DNA contained the IS1081 target sequence; thus testing of samples containing only these organisms were the only samples that produced positive detection results. Altogether, these results suggest that CRISPR-MTB is a promising sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic assay for use in MTB detection.\nDetection of clinical TB cases using CRISPR/ Ca13a-MTB\nIn order to further evaluate the diagnostic potential of the CRISPR-MTB assay for testing of clinical samples, 401 clinical samples were obtained from 268 TB cases (112 BALF, 141 sputum, and 15 pus specimens) and 133 non-TB cases (114 BALF and 19 sputum specimens) (Supplementary Table S3). Statistical analysis of patient characteristics revealed age differences between patients with and without active TB infections (Supplementary Table S3).\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nCRISPR-MTB assay results of control samples containing no template or plasmid DNA containing the target sequence served as the negative control (NC) and positive control (PC), respectively (Figure\u00a03). Based on the final clinical diagnoses of patients as a reference, we\u00a0evaluated CRISPR-MTB TB diagnostic performance for all patients in our study cohort (Supplementary Tables S4, S5; Figures\u00a03, 4), and then compared MTB-detection results obtained via Xpert, culture, AFB and CRISPR-MTB assays for all samples. The results revealed that CRISPR-MTB assay TB diagnostic sensitivity was as high as 97.4% (261/268), which was higher than sensitivities obtained for the mycobacterial culture assay (71.6%, 192/268) and the AFB assay (48.5%, 130/268), and was at least as sensitive as that obtained for GeneXpert MTB/RIF (97.0%, 260/268), Hence, these results suggest that CRISPR-MTB is a highly sensitive TB diagnostic assay.\nAfter further analysis of the influence of clinical specimen type on assay diagnostic performance (Supplementary Tables S4, S5; Figure\u00a04), it was found that CRISPR-MTB provided the highest sensitivity (97.2%, 137/141) when used to test sputum samples from pulmonary TB cases, which was significantly higher than that of AFB (58.9%, 83/141, p < 0.001) and mycobacterial culture (79.4%, 112/141, p < 0.001), and comparable to that of Xpert (95.0%, 134/141, p = 0.45). Similarly, the detection results obtained for BALF samples collected from pulmonary TB cases showed that CRISPR-MTB sensitivity reached 97.3% (109/112), which was higher than that obtained via mycobacterial culture (64.3%, 72/112), significantly higher than that obtained via AFB (39.3%, 44/112, p < 0.001) and statistically similar\nto that obtained via Xpert (99.1%, 111/112, p = 1.0). Meanwhile, testing of pus samples obtained from osseous TB cases via both CRISPR-MTB and Xpert detected all TB cases and significantly outperformed both MTB culture (100% vs. 53.3%) and AFB (100% vs. 20.0%) (Figure\u00a04). Interestingly, CRISPR-MTB testing identified six clinically verified TB patients who would not have otherwise received a TB diagnosis based solely on their AFB and mycobacterial culture test results (Figure\u00a05).\nIn addition, it is noteworthy that the CRISPR-MTB assay produced false-positive results for samples from six patients without TB infections (specificity: 95.5%, 127/133), which included patients with malignancies, non-TB infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, as compared to specificities of Xpert and culture assays (97.7 and 99.2%, respectively) (Supplementary Tables S4, S6). Nevertheless, these results collectively suggest that CRISPR/Cas13a-MTB provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for MTB detection, warranting further development of the assay for use in clinical TB diagnosis."

            "text": "The discovery of CRISPR/Cas systems has generated a wave of development of innovative diagnostics that take advantage of both the sensitivity of PCR amplification and the specificity of the CRISPR system. In this study, we\u00a0successfully developed a CRISPR/Cas13a-based diagnostic assay for use in diagnosing TB-based on clinical specimens.\nFIGURE\u00a01 Schematic diagram of the CRISPR-MTB assay. Rapid DNA extraction from clinical specimens was performed followed by PCR amplification to increase the amount of target sequence, during which the T7 promoter sequence was attached to 5\u2032 ends of PCR products. Next, PCR products were subjected to the CRISPR/Cas reaction, during which the collateral nuclease activity of Cas proteins was activated upon specific binding of crRNA to the MTB target gene sequence. Increased fluorescent signal produced by cleaved crRNA probes indicated the presence of MTB in clinical specimens.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nThe limit of detection (LOD) of our assay (1 copy/\u03bcL) was below that reported recently by Ai and colleagues for a CRISPR/Cas12a-based system of 5 copies/\u03bcL of MTB DNA, indicating slightly greater sensitivity of our approach (Ai et\u00a0 al., 2019). Additionally, the TB-QUICK MTB-detection assay, which is based on CRISPR-Cas12b and loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), had a LOD that was as low as 1.3 copies/\u03bcL within 2 h, although the exact explanation for this result is unclear. Nevertheless, we\u00a0speculate that the lower LOD obtained for the CRISPR-MTB assay was mainly due to the production of more precisely targeted transcripts during the T7 RNA polymerase step. However, of greater concern is the greater rate of false-positive results obtained with our assay, which may have been due to its ultra-high sensitivity. Regardless, our primary results demonstrated that the CRISPR-MTB assay provided excellent specificity, since no false-positive results were obtained for any of the six NTM-containing samples or for samples containing E. coli and S. globisporus species, due to the excellent single-base mismatch specificity of Cas13a (Chen et\u00a0 al., 2019). According to a previous study, as compared with mycobacterial culture testing, the gold standard clinical diagnostic method, the CRISPR-MTB assay developed here provided diagnostic sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 95.5%, while the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert were 75.9 and 82.8%, respectively (Moussa et\u00a0al., 2016), and the sensitivity\nA\nB C\nFIGURE\u00a02 Development of the CRISPR-MTB assay. (A) Screening of crRNAs for MTB DNA detection ability based on Cas13a-induced detection. The signal obtained for the crRNA probe IS1081-b was greater than signals of all other crRNAs. (B) Analytical assessment of CRISPR-MTB sensitivity. CRISPR-MTB could detect one copy of MTB DNA in 10 min (n\u00a0= 3 technical replicates; **p\u00a0< 0.01, ***p\u00a0< 0.001, ****p\u00a0< 0.0001; bars represent mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean). (C) Analytical assessment of CRISPR-MTB specificity. Only genomic DNA of MTB and BCG were explicitly detected at 30 min, while genomic DNA samples without MTB or BCG produced no obvious signal (n\u00a0= 3 technical replicates; bars represent mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean).\nFIGURE\u00a03 Fluorescence signal profile as detected using an ABI 7500 instrument. Black, red, and blue lines represent fluorescent signals from the negative control, positive control and samples, respectively.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 06 frontiersin.org\nand specificity of CRISPR/Cas12a-based test were 79.0 and 98.0%, respectively (Ai et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, the CRISPR/Cas13a-based diagnostic is a viable alternative to conventional assays for use in detecting MTB in clinical specimens with high sensitivity and specificity.\nAs consistent with our analytical test results, CRISPR-MTB assay sensitivity was significantly greater than assay sensitivities obtained using conventional microbiological methods (e.g., smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture). This distinction is particularly important when paucibacillary BALF and pus specimens from extrapulmonary TB cases are tested, thus highlighting CRISPR-MTB as an assay that may improve diagnosis of paucibacillary extrapulmonary TB. Specifically, the\nCRISPR-MTB assay required a much lower volume of body fluid (500 \u03bcl) than that required by conventional methods. Thus, this assay may be\u00a0more appropriate for identifying tubercle bacilli in specimens obtained from paediatric TB and tuberculous meningitis cases. Our study also emphasises the advantages of CRISPR-based detection assays for use in detecting MTB in specimens with paucibacillary loads, since current molecular MTB-detection assays provide suboptimal results when used to test such specimens, warranting further study.\nIt is noteworthy that the CRISPR-MTB assay was at least as sensitive as Xpert when used to detect MTB in sputa and other specimens, a result that appears, at first glance, to contradict our results showing that CRISPR-MTB had a lower LOD than Xpert. However, diagnostic sensitivity greatly depends on both the efficiency of a molecular procedure and on sample preparation and DNA extraction efficiencies, such that the ostensibly better performance of the Xpert assay may reflect its more efficient standardized extraction protocol involving fractionation of mycobacteria via a pre-sonication step (Patel et\u00a0al., 2013). This result is supported by results of previous clinical evaluations demonstrating that Xpert outperformed other molecular tests currently used for TB diagnosis. By contrast, the relatively low efficiency of the manual DNA extraction method used in our assay may have reduced CRISPR-MTB sensitivity, while Venter et\u00a0al. reported that crude DNA extracted using the Xpert cartridge was suitable for MTBDRsl (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Drug Resistance second line) assays and produced more accurate second-line DST results than other DNA extraction methods (Venter et\u00a0al., 2017). Taken together, these results highlight the importance of using efficient DNA extraction procedures to boost sensitivity of molecular diagnostic assays.\nWhen considering the clinical applicability of the CRISPR/ Cas13a-MTB assay, all steps are easily implemented in most clinical settings, since they rely on routine PCR amplification procedures and\nFIGURE\u00a04 Evaluation of CRISPR-MTB sensitivity according to clinical sample type. Two hundred and twenty-six BALF, 160 sputum and 15 pus specimens were tested were detected via AFB, Culture, Xpert and CRISPR-MTB assays; ****McNemar test, p < 0.0001; ####Fisher\u2019s exact test, p < 0.0001.\nFIGURE\u00a05 Venn diagram showing overlap in TB diagnostic test results obtained for different clinical MTB-detection assays.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nuniversal \u2018RNA reporter\u2019 probes that can be\u00a0 detected using common fluorescence detectors. Moreover, the assay can be\u00a0completed in only 2 h using relatively inexpensive instrumentation and, as a critically important advantage, at low cost. In fact, in this pilot study the direct cost of each CRISPR/Cas13a-MTB test was less than $2 USD, a cost comparable to that of smear microscopy. However, the CRISPR-MTB assay provides dramatically greater diagnostic accuracy and thus is a superior alternative to routine TB diagnostic assays used currently in resource-limited settings.\nWe must acknowledge several limitations of the present study. First, the performance of CRISPR/Cas13a-MTB was only assessed based on a limited sample size, which may have weakened the significance of our conclusion, warranting further validation of the assay through testing of a greater number of specimens obtained from a larger patient cohort. Second, previous studies have demonstrated the potential role of LAMP in improving diagnostic sensitivity as compared with conventional realtime PCR (Sam et\u00a0al., 2021). Thus, integration of LAMP amplification within the CRISPR-Cas13a system will be\u00a0 investigated in the future towards the development of a cost-effective point-of-care (POC) MTB detection assay (Kaminski et\u00a0al., 2021). Finally, due to the intrinsic ability of Cas13a to target single-stranded RNA, an in vitro T7 transcription step was incorporated within the CRISPR-MTB diagnostic assay that undoubtedly increased the turnaround time as compared with DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems.\nIn conclusion, we\u00a0have successfully developed a CRISPR/Cas13abased diagnostic test (CRISPR-MTB) to detect MTB in clinical specimens. Our data demonstrate that the CRISPR-MTB assay provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for rapid identification of MTB in sputum, BALF and pus samples and thus should be\u00a0suitable for use as a TB diagnostic assay in resource-limited settings."
