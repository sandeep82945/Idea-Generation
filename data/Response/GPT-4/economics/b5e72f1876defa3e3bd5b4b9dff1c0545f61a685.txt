Impact of Health Improvement Programs on Work Capacity: Investigate how targeted health improvement and wellness programs for middle-aged and older women, particularly in rural areas, could enhance their work capacity and willingness to participate in the labor force. This could include interventions aimed at chronic disease management, mental health, and physical fitness.

Analysis of Social Security Policies on Labor Participation: A comparative study on the impact of different social security policies on the labor participation rates of middle-aged and older women. This could examine how various pension schemes, healthcare benefits, and retirement age policies influence decisions regarding retirement and continued work engagement, considering the heterogeneity in urban and rural settings.

Role of Childcare Responsibilities in Labor Participation: Explore the influence of familial and childcare responsibilities on the labor participation of middle-aged and older women, especially in the context of China's three-child policy. Research could focus on how providing support services for childcare and eldercare might affect women's decisions to retire or continue working.

Technology and Flexible Work Arrangements for Older Women: Study the potential of technology and flexible work arrangements to extend the working lives of older women. This could involve assessing how remote work, part-time opportunities, and other flexible employment models accommodate the health and personal circumstances of older women, thereby potentially increasing their labor participation rates.

Cross-Cultural Comparison of Delayed Retirement Policies: Conduct a cross-cultural analysis comparing China's approach to delayed retirement with those of other countries facing similar demographic challenges. This research could identify best practices and innovative policy solutions for encouraging labor participation among older women, taking into account health status, education levels, and urban-rural disparities.
