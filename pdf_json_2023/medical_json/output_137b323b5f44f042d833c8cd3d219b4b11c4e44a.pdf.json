            "text": "Endoscopic Spinal Surgery (ESS) stands as a significant leap in the direction of minimally invasive spinal surgery (MISS). It offers an avenue to enhance patient outcomes while reducing procedural invasiveness [1\u20137]. Unlike established endoscopic procedures such as laparoscopic, arthroscopic, retroperitoneal, or gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic surgeries and procedures\u2014which benefit from the natural anatomical working spaces of peritoneal cavities, joint cavities, and the lumen of GI organs\u2014spinal endoscopic surgery faced the unique challenge of lacking an inherent anatomical working space. This limitation initially posed a hurdle to the onset of ESS. It was first overcome by leveraging Kambin\u2019s triangle as a surgical corridor to access the epidural space in lumbar disc surgeries [8,9]. The evolution of ESS began with the emergence and development of Full-Endoscopic Spinal Surgery (FESS), subsequently followed by Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Spine Surgery (UBE) [10,11]. While both surgical techniques offer the benefits of minimally invasive procedures with excellent visualization and are widely used, they exhibit distinct differences primarily stemming from the design of their devices. In FESS, the endoscope serves roles as both visualization and providing a channel for instruments. Conversely, UBE utilizes the endoscope solely for visualization. This difference brings about specific advantages and disadvantages for each technique, broadening the range of procedures and catering to diverse surgical scenarios and preferences.\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 1363. https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10121363 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/bioengineering\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 1363 2 of 12\nThe development of surgical devices has played a pivotal role in advancing ESS [12]. The advent of modern scope cameras equipped with high-resolution imaging and cuttingedge sensor technology has significantly enhanced visualization, thereby facilitating more precise interventions. Similarly, innovations in Radiofrequency (RF) equipment have enabled safe bleeding control with minimal collateral damage. The refinement in drill technology, characterized by superior torque, speed, and adaptability in water-based surgery, has been instrumental in performing powerful and delicate bone drilling procedures while preserving structural integrity. Endoscopic Spine Surgery (ESS) has undergone a remarkable evolution, beginning with the introduction of transforaminal (trans-Kambin) lumbar discectomy by Parviz Kambin in the 1980s [8], followed by endoscopic interlaminar lumbar discectomy introduced by Ruetten et al. in the 2000s [13]. Over the decades, the indications for ESS have expanded significantly, now encompassing surgeries from cervical to lumbar segments and evolving to include not only decompressive but also fusion surgeries. In 2020, the AO Spine nomenclature system was established [14], categorizing ESS types based on approach corridor, visualization, spinal segments, and specific procedures. This comprehensive system includes various ESS techniques such as Anterior Endoscopic Cervical Discectomy (AECD) [15], Posterior Endoscopic Cervical Foraminotomy (PECF), Posterior Endoscopic Cervical Discectomy (PECD) [16], Cervical Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression (CE-ULBD) [17], Transforaminal Endoscopic Thoracic Discectomy (TETD) [18], Thoracic Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression (TE-ULBD) [19], Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy (TELD) [20], Interlaminar Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy (IELD) [21], Extraforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy (EELD) [22], and Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Foraminotomy (TELF) [23]. Additionally, techniques like Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Interbody Fusion [24] and UBE Fusion [25,26] are also included. Beyond the AO Spine nomenclature, ESS is also employed in various surgeries, such as surgery for craniovertebral junction [27], spinal metastasis [28], spinal abscess [29], and far-out syndrome [30]. The rapid adoption and surging popularity of ESS underscore its capacity to effectively address a wide range of spinal conditions, covering almost all segments and pathologies in spine surgeries. However, given that current ESS systems are tailored to water-based surgery, it is challenging to perform surgeries for intradural pathologies, such as intradural tumors, arachnoid cysts, and hematomas since the infused saline could lead to increased intracranial pressure (IICP) during the operation [31]. As the realm of MISS expands, the ongoing integration and enhancement of current technologies and techniques remain imperative. Despite the progress in ESS technologies and surgical techniques, a chasm still exists between the present capabilities and the ideal goals that endoscopic spine surgeons aim to achieve. Looking ahead, the field is ready for more innovation. By assimilating concepts and technologies from other endoscopic surgical disciplines, evolving device technologies, and incorporating advanced tools like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR), the horizon seems promising. This review aims to provide a thorough examination of the current state of technologies and techniques in ESS while looking forward to the exciting future possibilities in this field."

Each technique offers unique advantages and faces distinct challenges. The primary differentiation between the two lies in the endoscopic scope\u2019s role. In FESS, the endoscope serves dual purposes: visualization and providing a channel for instruments [2,3,32]. Conversely, UBE utilizes the endoscope solely for visualization. This means that in FESS, the visualization and instrument angles align, while in UBE, there is typically a 30-degree angular difference.

Such variations significantly influence surgical tactics (Figure 1).\nFESS\u2019s surgical pathway can be likened to a rifle\u2019s barrel: both the camera systems and surgical instruments pass through a single, slender, and elongated rigid scope. This design, tailored for accessing narrower spaces like the transforaminal corridor, makes FESS suitable for keyhole surgeries requiring minimal bony drilling. Nevertheless, it necessitates the use of extended and slim instruments, posing challenges to crafting versatile, robust surgical tools. Here, the scope\u2019s diameter plays a critical role and presents a trade-off. Earlier FESS models, with an outer diameter of approximately 7 mm and an inner channel of 4 mm, were apt for the foraminal area but restricted instrument variety. However, contemporary designs, boasting up to 11 mm outer and 4.6 mm inner diameters, accommodate a wider range of instruments, with the inclusion of larger drill burrs aiding efficient bone work. Conversely, UBE\u2019s design is familiar to many spine surgeons due to its resemblance to traditional open surgeries, particularly the 30-degree angle between the scope and the working channel. The shorter working portal in UBE accommodates most traditional open surgery instruments, including large-sized high-speed drills, various Kerrison rongeurs, curettes, and dissectors. However, the angular difference between the scope and working instruments in UBE necessitates more extensive bone work than FESS, making access to the actual working spaces through the drilled-out bone more challenging. This inherent trade-off makes UBE less optimal for minimal keyhole approaches.\n3. Advancements in Endoscopic Surgery Devices 3.1. Camera and Lighting Systems 3.1.1.

            "text": "In endoscopic surgeries, bleeding is a significant issue as it obscures the surgical field, potentially leading to delays or even cessation of the procedure. It is imperative to accurately and robustly control bleeding without causing damage to neural tissues. The extent of heating damage can vary depending on the RF (Radiofrequency) output and power, affecting uncontrolled areas. Hence, the development of tools that can precisely control the range and area of effect is crucial in surgeries. Since the advent of spinal endoscopic surgery, there has been significant progress in RF technology, alongside a substantial accumulation of data from actual surgeries. Initially, its application was limited to a certain extent, primarily used on soft tissues. However, as the technology advanced, its application expanded not only for soft tissue but also for bone bleeding control. Furthermore, RF functionality has evolved from being merely used for coagulation to tissue ablation as well [35]. The evolution of Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) technology can be broadly categorized into the advancement of generators and electrodes.\n3.2.1. Generator\nTypically, Radiofrequency denotes a frequency band of 3 kHz to 300 GHz, among which the frequency band mainly used in ESU ranges from 100 kHz to 5 MHz. The properties of electromagnetic radiation dictate that energy (E) is directly proportional to frequency (\u00b5) and inversely proportional to wavelength (\u03bb). Hence, as the frequency increases, the wavelength shortens, and higher energy is generated. Generators operating in MHz units tend to use lower output levels (Voltage or Watt) than those operating in kHz units due to the high energy generated [36]. Despite reaching the desired target temperature quickly, MHz generators have their output range limited to a lower range, making fine-tuning the output stages somewhat challenging, as shown in Figure 3. Bioengineering 2023, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 12\nFigure 3. Energy of each type of electromagnetic radiation.\n3.2.2. Electrode Electrodes are categorized as either Monopolar or Bipolar based on their polarity [38,39]. Monopolar devices consist of an active electrode at the tip and a return electrode on a pad, and they are commonly used in general surgeries. However, if the return electrode (or pad) is not correctly placed, it can cause current concentration, leading to complications like burns [40]. On the other hand, Bipolar devices have both active and return electrodes at the tip, significantly reducing the risk of complications like burns in the pad area (Figure 4a).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 4. Different types of radiofrequency ablation systems: (a) monopolar and bipolar configuration of the circuit; (b) Wand-type bipolar electrodes.\nMoreover, human tissues have unique impedance values, meaning that even with the same output from the generator, the resulting output varies depending on the tissue typ [37].

Traditional Bovie electrodes have separate shafts for each pole, making them unsuitable for surgeries in tight spaces like endoscopic operations. To address this limitation, the Wand-type bipolar electrode was developed for endoscopic surgeries (Figure 4b). This design has both active and return electrodes on a single shaft, making it usable even in narrow-diameter endoscopic scopes. The advent of such Wand-type bipolar electrodes has enabled the application of ESUs even in smaller-diameter spinal endoscopic surgeries. For ablation procedures, a higher current output than coagulation is applied. As surgical techniques advance, it\u2019s anticipated that future electrode developments will emphasize miniaturized, mechanically and electrically durable designs capable of enhanced ablation."

            "text": "In endoscopic surgeries, drills play a vital role in decompressing neural tissues. However, in spinal endoscopic surgery, drills require several unique characteristics differing from other endoscopic surgeries, such as transsphenoidal approach surgery. Firstly, spinal endoscopic surgeries are conducted in a water-based environment, necessitating certain features for drill operation underwater. It is crucial to swiftly expel\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 1363 7 of 12\nbone dust generated during drilling to maintain a clear surgical field. To achieve this, a smooth out-flow maintained through water flow is essential. For instance, in FESS, Wolf\u2019s drill has a suction attached to improve water flow artificially. In UBE surgery, maintaining a clear field of view becomes challenging without a separate suction for out-flow, especially if the drill\u2019s burr size is too large or the shaft is too thick, occupying part of the out-flow pathway, which deteriorates visibility. Hence, endoscopic drills need to be specialized towards having a thin shaft capable of accommodating large burrs and exhibiting high stability at high speeds. Secondly, given the water-based surgery nature, waterproof capabilities, especially in the handpiece, are indispensable for drill durability. However, the current drills have been developed without much consideration for this aspect. Frequent malfunctions, which could lead to surgery interruption, pose significant economic burdens on the operating hospitals, making it challenging to actively perform endoscopic surgeries. Industrial products have a step-by-step certification for waterproof functionality, as indicated by the IP (Identification code for Protection) ratings, yet such certification has not been applied to spinal drills, signifying a need for such certification in endoscopic surgery equipment. This issue has been attempted to be mitigated in clinical settings through various methods, such as attaching waterproof features in-between to enhance durability. Lastly, the current drills used in spinal endoscopic surgery have been adapted from the shaver types used in arthroscopic surgeries for shoulders and knees and high-speed drills used in conventional spine surgery. The shaver type offers better torque and the possibility to attach suction, maintaining a clear surgical field, albeit at the cost of being heavier and having a slower drill head speed. On the other hand, high-speed drills are lighter with the advantage of applying high RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) methods but suffer from weaker torque holding the drill, posing durability issues. Given the unique condition in spinal endoscopy where lesions are far from the skin, requiring bone resection at distant locations, there is a demand for the development of specialized drills exclusively for spinal endoscopic surgery."

            "text": "ESS evolved for decades from FESS to UBE and is currently becoming a mainstream of MIS spine surgery. Devices and technologies concurrently have developed, adopting concepts of prior endoscopic surgery from other fields, such as laparoscopic surgery and arthroscopic surgery. Thus, basic concepts are similar, such as a rigid scope and straight surgical instruments. However, there are other successful endoscopic surgery fields, such as retroperitoneal robotic surgery and gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. They have distinct differences in terms of surgical techniques, and there could be advances that are able to be adopted in the case of ESS. One of the main limitations of current ESS techniques is the use of single working instruments with minimal assistance in terms of a scope retractor, which makes fine tasks, such as intramedullary surgery or dura suture, challenging. In comparison, traditional three-portal laparoscopic surgery with one camera portal and two working portals allows the surgeon to operate with both hands. This approach provides a more dynamic and ergonomic way to manipulate tissues and organs, potentially reducing surgeon fatigue and improving precision. Robotic surgery systems, such as the da Vinci Surgical System, represent a further advancement, with multiple robotic arms providing the surgeon with the capability to manipulate several instruments concurrently. The enhanced dexterity and precision of robotic arms, along with three-dimensional visualization, could allow for complex maneuvers that are difficult to perform with manual endoscopic instruments. The application of such laparoscopic or robotic technology to ESS could revolutionize the field by enabling more intricate and delicate spine surgeries with potentially improved outcomes and lower rates of complications.\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 1363 8 of 12\nAnother issue to consider with ESS is its reliance on water-based surgery. Since water must be constantly infused during the procedure in the current ESS system, there is a risk of increased intracranial pressure (IICP) if an incidental durotomy occurs. This risk limits the indications for ESS to extradural surgery. To overcome this limitation and expand the indications of ESS to include intradural pathology, such as intradural tumors, it may be necessary to switch to air-based surgery after performing the dural incision. Additionally, strategies must be in place to manage minor bleeding from surrounding structures."

            "heading": "4.2. Camera and Visualization",
            "text": "ESS faces complex and narrow anatomical structures in many cases. For example, it is difficult to visualize the thecal sac, traversing nerve roots, and exiting roots in foraminal and extraforaminal areas at once due to the narrow bony corridor. To overcome this, angled scopes are widely used, but the angle is fixed, and visualization is often not enough. The da Vinci robotic surgery system provides a freely movable distal camera. The GI endoscope is much more flexible when passing the complex curves of the GI organ lumen; however, the working channel is limited. If we can adopt this flexible or semi-rigid camera concept, ESS could be enhanced one step further. During endoscopic surgery, securing a broader field of view can enhance surgical safety. Several candidate technologies can be considered to achieve this wider view. These include using a wide-angle lens, mounting multiple lenses in various directions on a single scope, or employing a flexible scope that allows the tip to rotate, providing a more expansive surgical field of view. However, current technological limitations exist. Using a wide-angle lens can cause distortion at the periphery of the view, and incorporating multiple lenses might result in a thicker scope. Nevertheless, the fact that other clinical fields are already utilizing scopes produced by Olympus, where the tip can flex, suggests that the day when such technologies are applied to spinal endoscopic surgeries to ensure a broader view might not be far off."

In bi-portal surgery, two lines are connected: the water line and the imaging line. As the number of connected lines increases, the weight of the scope becomes heavier, imposing limitations on its movement. Therefore, efforts should be made to reduce the number of lines. Technologically, to eliminate the currently used imaging line, one can consider a method where the image data obtained from the scope are converted in a device and then wirelessly transmitted after an image conversion process. The console then receives these data and converts the data back into an image. If this entire process can be completed in less than 130 ms [41], surgeons will not experience any discomfort during surgery. However, if it exceeds 130 ms, they might feel inconvenienced due to the delay. At present, using wireless technology might make the scope heavier and compromise image quality. However, as technology advances, these challenges are likely to be overcome [41] (Figure 5)."
