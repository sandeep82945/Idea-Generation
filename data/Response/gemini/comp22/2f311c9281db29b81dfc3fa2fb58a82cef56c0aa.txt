1. **Investigate the use of different deep learning architectures for IMU calibration.** The paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for IMU calibration, but other architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, may also be effective.


2. **Explore the use of additional sensor data for IMU calibration.** The paper only uses IMU data for calibration, but other sensor data, such as visual data or GPS data, could also be used to improve calibration accuracy.


3. **Develop a method for online IMU calibration.** The paper's method is an offline calibration method, which means that it must be performed before the IMU can be used. Developing an online calibration method that can be performed while the IMU is in use would be a valuable contribution to the field.


4. **Investigate the use of IMU calibration for other applications.** The paper focuses on using IMU calibration for orientation estimation, but IMU calibration could also be used for other applications, such as navigation or control.


5. **Develop a method for IMU calibration that is robust to noise and outliers.** The paper's method assumes that the IMU data is clean and free of noise and outliers. However, in real-world applications, IMU data is often noisy and contains outliers. Developing a method for IMU calibration that is robust to noise and outliers would be a valuable contribution to the field.
