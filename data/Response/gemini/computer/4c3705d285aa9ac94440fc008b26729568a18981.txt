1. **Investigate the use of different implicit neural representation architectures:** The paper utilizes sinusoidal representation networks for the implicit representations. Future research could explore the use of other architectures, such as radial basis functions or deep sets, to determine if they can further improve the registration performance.


2. **Apply the proposed method to other types of medical images:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for registering ISH gene expression images of the marmoset brain. Future research could investigate the applicability of the method to other types of medical images, such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound images, to assess its generalizability.


3. **Explore the use of the proposed method for multi-modal image registration:** The paper focuses on pairwise image registration. Future research could investigate the extension of the proposed method to multi-modal image registration, where images from different modalities (e.g., MRI and PET) are registered to each other.


4. **Develop a method for incorporating prior knowledge into the registration process:** The paper does not consider the incorporation of prior knowledge into the registration process. Future research could explore the development of a method that leverages prior knowledge, such as anatomical landmarks or tissue properties, to improve the registration accuracy.


5. **Investigate the use of the proposed method for image segmentation:** The paper demonstrates the use of the proposed method for image registration. Future research could explore the use of the method for image segmentation, where the goal is to partition an image into different regions or objects.
