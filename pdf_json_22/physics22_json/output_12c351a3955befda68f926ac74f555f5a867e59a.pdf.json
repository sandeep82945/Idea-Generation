An understanding of observational results generally requires a numerical solution of Maxwell equations \u2013 usually implemented on conventional computers using sophisticated numerical algorithms. In recent years, advances in quantum information science and in the development of quantum computers have piqued curiosity about taking advantage of these resources for an alternate numerical approach to Maxwell equations. This requires a reformulation of the classical Maxwell equations into a form suitable for quantum computers which, unlike conventional computers, are limited to unitary operations. In this paper, a unitary framework is developed for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a spatially inhomogeneous, passive, nondispersive, and anisotropic dielectric medium. For such a medium, generally, the evolution operator in the combined Faraday-Ampere equations is not unitary. There are two steps needed to convert this equation into a unitary evolution equation. In the first step, a weighted Hilbert space is formulated in which the generator of dynamics is a pseudo-Hermitian operator. In the second step, a Dyson map is constructed which maps the weighted\u2013physical\u2013Hilbert space to the original Hilbert space. The resulting evolution equation for the electromagnetic wave fields is unitary. Utilizing the framework developed in these steps, a unitary evolution equation is derived for electromagnetic wave propagation in a uniaxial dielectric medium. The resulting form is suitable for quantum computing.",

The resulting form is suitable for quantum computing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe prospect that, for a range of problems, quantum computers could be be exponentially faster than conventional computers [1, 2] has led to an enhanced interest in quantum computer sciences. For efficient use of quantum computers, it is necessary that the evolution equations for any physical system be expressed in terms of unitary operators [3]. There is no such requirement for classical computations. The tantalizing possibility of faster computations as well as including many more degrees of freedom has been the motivation behind applying quantum information science to traditionally classical fields.\nThe propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in magneto-dielectric matter has been of considerable interest over many decades. The electromagnetic properties of a medium are included in Maxwell equations through constitutive relations that relate the electric displacement field and magnetic induction to the electric field and magnetic intensity, respectively. Most of these studies are classical \u2013 the de Broglie wavelengths being negligibly small compared to the wavelengths of the macroscopic fields. Thus, the implementation of Maxwell equations on quantum computers requires expressing a classical description in the language of quantum mechanics. The first step in this direction was taken\n\u2217 stkoukoutsis@mail.ntua.gr\nby Laporte-Uhlenbeck [4] and Oppenheimer [5] casting Maxwell equations in vacuum into a form similar to the Dirac equation. Along similar lines, there have been recent studies drawing on the connection between the photon wave function and the Dirac equation in vacuum [6, 7], and in magneto-dielectric medium with scalar permittivity and permeability [8].\nIn this paper we formulate Maxwell equations for wave propagation in a dielectric medium such that they become amenable to quantum computations. The magnetodielectric medium is assumed to be passive and nondispersive for which both the permittivity and permeability can be a tensor. When the medium is spatially homogeneous, the Faraday-Ampere equations take on the form of a Dirac equation for spin 1 photons. The evolution operator is unitary and the state vector is a sixvector composed of the electric field and magnetic intensity. A unitarily similar representation is obtained for a state vector comprising of Riemann-Silberstein-Weber (RSW) vectors [9] \u2013 which represent the left and right hand polarizations of an electromagnetic field.\nWhen the same prescription is extended to a spatially inhomogeneous medium, the evolution operator for the electromagnetic fields is not unitary anymore. We develop a pathway towards a unitary evolution equation through a two-step process. The first step is to identify the generator of dynamics \u2013 the Hamiltonian operator \u2013 as a pseudo-Hermitian operator. In a newlydefined weighted Hilbert space the Hamiltonian is Her-\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n08 52\n3v 3\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. pl\nas m\n-p h]\n2 0\nM ar\n2 02\n3\n2 mitian with respect to a weighed inner product structure. There has been a lot of interest in pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics, especially in the subset of PT -symmetric Hamiltonians [10\u201312]. The second step is to draw a connection between the physical Hilbert space and the initial Hilbert space that preserves the inner product structure of the two spaces. This is accomplished by constructing an appropriate isometric Dyson map. The end result is a fully unitary evolution equation with an explicit Hermitian Hamiltonian that could be implemented in a quantum computer. The fields evaluated from this evolution equation are directly related to the physical electromagnetic fields.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In sections II A and II B we formulate the Faraday-Ampere equations in terms of a six-vector and in terms of RSW vectors, respectively, for a homogeneous medium. In section II C, we extend the description to allow for an inhomogeneous medium. From Poynting\u2019s theorem, as expected for a passive medium, we show that the total electromagnetic energy is conserved in a bounded medium subject to suitably chosen Dirichlet boundary conditions. In section II D, it is shown that the evolution generator of the previous section is not Hermitian due to spatial inhomogeneity. A physical Hilbert space is created in which the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. It is shown that, in this weighted Hilbert space, the norm of the state vector is the conserved energy that follows from Poynting\u2019s theorem. In section II E, we formulate three different forms of the Dyson map which lead to a Maxwell-Dirac equation with unitary evolution operator in the initial Hilbert space. In section II F, the entire formalism is applied to a uniaxial dielectric medium. There is a natural extension of the evolution equation to a set of spatially dependent RSW vectors which are a generalization of the RSW vectors in II B. In section III A, we construct a Qubit Lattice Algorithm (QLA) corresponding to our unitary formulation of Maxwell equations. The advantage of this QLA is that it can also be implemented and tested on classical computers. In section III B, to demonstrate proof of concept, we map out a quantum circuit for the QLA that is suitable for a quantum computer."

We will assume that the medium is bounded by a perfect conductor so that,\nn\u0302(r)\u00d7 u1 = 0 on the boundary \u2202\u2126, (20)\nwhere n\u0302(r) is the outward pointing normal at the boundary, and u = (u1,u2) T\nwith u1 and u2 each being a three-vector. The boundary conditions are necessary for\nenergy conservation and for ensuring that M\u0302 remains\n4 Hermitian. The set of equations (16)-(20) are the complete mathematical description of electromagnetic waves in a Hilbert state space H = L2(\u2126,R6) 3 u defined by the inner product [15],\n\u3008v|u\u3009 = \u222b\n\u2126 v\u2020(r, t)u(r, t)d r, \u2126 \u2286 R3, t \u2208 T = [0, T ], (21)\nwhere u (r, t) and v (r, t) are two solutions within the bounded domain defined by \u2126.\nA general form of the constitutive operator L\u0302 has to satisfy five physical postulates [15]: determinism, linearity, causality, locality in space, and invariance under time translations. The form that is consistent with these postulates is [15],\nd(r, t) = L\u0302u(r, t) = W\u0302 (r)u(r, t)+ \u222b t\n0 G\u0302(r, t\u2212\u03c4)u(r, \u03c4)d \u03c4. (22)\nThe first term on the right hand side in (22) corresponds to instantaneous optical response of the medium, and the second term with G as the susceptibility kernel is the dispersive response which includes memory effects.\nFor an anisotropic non-dispersive medium, (22) re-\nduces to,\nd(r, t) = W\u0302 (r)u(r, t), (23)\nwhere,\nW\u0302 = [ (r) 03\u00d73 03\u00d73 \u00b5(r) ] . (24)\nIn what follows, we will ignore dispersive effects. However, in general, a constitutive relation of the form (23) is an approximation to (22) which includes a non-local time-response function [16].\nSince W\u0302 is invertible [15], (16) takes on the form,\ni \u2202u \u2202t = W\u0302\u22121(r)M\u0302u = D\u0302u, (25)\nwhere,\nD\u0302 = W\u0302\u22121(r)M\u0302. (26)\nIn this representation, the Poynting theorem is [15],\n\u2207 \u00b7 S + u\u2020 \u2202d \u2202t = 0, (27)\nwhere S = E\u00d7H is the Poynting vector. Following [17], the electromagnetic energy density is,\nU(r, t) =\n\u222b t\n0\nu\u2020 \u2202d(r, \u03c4)\n\u2202\u03c4 d\u03c4 =\n1 2 u\u2020W\u0302u+\n\u222b t\n0\nu\u2020(r, \u03c4) W\u0302A \u2202u(r, \u03c4)\n\u2202\u03c4 d\u03c4, (28)\nwhere W\u0302A = ( W\u0302 \u2212 W\u0302 \u2020 ) /2 is the anti-Hermitian part of\nW\u0302 . For a passive medium [15, 17],\nU(r, t) \u2265 0, \u2200 r \u2208 \u2126. (29)\nFrom (28) it follows that W\u0302 must be Hermitian and semipositive definite,\nW\u0302 = W\u0302 \u2020 and W\u0302 \u2265 0. (30)\nThe total integrated stored electromagnetic energy U\u2126 in a volume \u2126 is,\nU\u2126(t) = 1\n2\n\u222b\n\u2126\nu\u2020 W\u0302 u d3r \u2265 0. (31)\nIntegrating (27) over \u2126 and making use of the divergence theorem, we obtain,\n\u2202U\u2126(t)\n\u2202t +\n\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\nS \u00b7 n\u0302(r) dA = 0, (32)\nwhere dA is an elemental area on the surface \u2202\u2126, and n\u0302 is the outward pointing normal to \u2202\u2126. Since S = u1 \u00d7 u2, it follows from (32) and the boundary condition (20) that U\u2126(t) is constant in time,\nU\u2126(t) = U\u2126(t = 0) =\n\u222b\n\u2126\nu\u20200 W\u0302 (r)u0 d 3r. (33)\nAs expected for a passive medium, there is no net dissipation or generation of electromagnetic energy within \u2126.\nD. Pseudo-Hermitian Operators\nIn the Hilbert space H,\n5 \u2329 v \u2223\u2223\u2223M\u0302u \u232a = i \u222b\n\u2126\n( v\u22171 \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7 u2)\u2212 v\u22172 \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7 u1) ) d3r (34a)\n= i\n\u222b\n\u2126\n( u2 \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7 v\u22171)\u2212 u1 \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7 v\u22172) ) d3r + i\n\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\n( v\u22171 \u00b7 (n\u0302\u00d7 u2)\u2212 v\u22172 \u00b7 (n\u0302\u00d7 u1) ) dA, (34b)\nwhere v = (v1,v2) T\n, with v1, and v2 each being threevectors. In obtaining (34b) from (34a), we have made use of the vector identity \u2207\u00b7 (a\u00d7b) = b \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7a)\u2212a \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7 b), and the divergence theorem. Since v\u22171 \u00b7 (n\u0302\u00d7 u2) = \u2212u2 \u00b7 (n\u0302\u00d7 v\u22171), the surface integral in (34b) vanishes as a consequence of the boundary condition (20). It follows from (34) that,\n\u2329 v \u2223\u2223\u2223M\u0302u \u232a = \u2329 vM\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223u \u232a , (35)\nproving that M\u0302 is Hermitian; i.e., M\u0302 = M\u0302\u2020. Even though W\u0302 (r) and M\u0302 are Hermitian, the operator D\u0302 = W\u0302\u22121M\u0302 is not Hermitian. In contrast to a homogeneous medium, the commutator [ W\u0302\u22121, M\u0302 ] is non-zero\nfor an inhomogeneous medium. Consequently, the operator on the right-hand side of the evolution equation (25) is non-unitary. In order to make Maxwell equations for an inhomogeneous medium suitable for quantum computing, we formulate a unitary representation that relies\non D\u0302 being a special kind of non-Hermitian operator \u2013 a pseudo-Hermitian operator.\nA linear operator D\u0302 in a Hilbert space H is pseudoHermitian if there exists an invertible Hermitian linear operator \u03b7\u0302 in H with the property [18\u201320],\nD\u0302\u2020 = \u03b7\u0302 D\u0302 \u03b7\u0302\u22121. (36)\nFor \u3008u|\u03b7\u0302|u\u3009 > 0 for all nonzero states u, \u03b7\u0302 is a positive definite metric operator, and we can define an inner product,\n\u3008v|u\u3009\u03b7 = \u3008v|\u03b7\u0302u\u3009 = \u222b\n\u2126\nv\u2020(r, t) \u03b7\u0302(r)u(r, t) d3r, (37)\nwith respect to a new weighted Hilbert space H\u03b7. From (26),\nD\u0302\u2020 = M\u0302 W\u0302\u22121 = W\u0302 W\u0302\u22121 M\u0302 W\u0302\u22121 = W\u0302 D\u0302 W\u0302\u22121. (38)\nComparing with (36) we note that \u03b7\u0302 = W\u0302 . Furthermore, exploiting the Hermicity condition (37) of Maxwell oper-\nator M\u0302 we obtain, \u2329 v \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u0302u\n\u232a W = \u2329 v \u2223\u2223\u2223M\u0302u \u232a = \u2329 vM\u0302W\u0302\u22121W\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223u \u232a\n= \u2329 vM\u0302W\u0302\u22121 \u2223\u2223\u2223u \u232a W = \u2329 vD\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223u \u232a W .\n(39)\nThus, D\u0302\u2020 = D\u0302, i.e., D\u0302 is Hermitian in the weighted Hilbert space HW . In HW , the inner product is as defined in (37) with \u03b7\u0302 replaced by W\u0302 , and the evolution\nequation (25) is unitary. Making use of (33), the square of the norm of u, \u3008u|u\u3009W = \u3008u|W\u0302 |u\u3009 = \u222b\n\u2126\nu\u2020(r, t) W\u0302 (r)u(r, t) d3r = 2U\u2126,\n(40) is a constant independent of time. Consequently, the underlying conservation of the electromagnetic energy in the closed volume \u2126 is preserved in HW .\nE. The Dyson map for Maxwell equations\nEven though D\u0302 is Hermitian in the new Hilbert space HW , in the Maxwell-Dirac equation (25) there is no change except that u \u2208 HW . We need to connect the original, physical, Hilbert space H, in which D\u0302 is not Hermitian, to HW by an isometric transformation that preserves the inner product structure between the two Hilbert spaces. Such an invertible transformation \u03c1\u0302(r) : HW \u2192 H between equivalent descriptions of a physical system is referred to as a Dyson map [18\u201320].\nOur derivation of the Dyson map \u03c1\u0302(r) is based on the\nfactorization of the metric operator \u03b7\u0302 = W\u0302 ,\n\u03b7\u0302(r) = \u03c1\u0302\u2020(r)\u03c1\u0302(r), (41)\nwhich preserves the inner product structure since,\n\u3008v|u\u3009\u03b7 = \u2329 v \u2223\u2223\u03c1\u0302\u2020\u03c1\u0302u \u232a = \u3008v\u03c1\u0302|\u03c1\u0302u\u3009 = \u3008\u03c6|\u03c8\u3009 , (42)\nwhere v,u \u2208 HW and \u03c6,\u03c8 \u2208 H. For Maxwell equations, there can be three different\nfactorization forms of W\u0302 in (24) [21].\n\u2022 Spectral decomposition:\nW\u0302 (r) = U\u0302\u2020\u2206\u0302(r)U\u0302 = U\u0302\u2020 \u221a \u2206\u0302(r) \u221a \u2206\u0302(r)U\u0302 = \u03c1\u0302\u2020(r)\u03c1\u0302(r),\n(43) leading to the Dyson map,\n\u03c1\u0302(r) = \u221a \u2206\u0302(r)U\u0302 . (44)\n\u2022 Square root decomposition:\nW\u0302 (r) = W\u0302 1/2(r)W\u0302 1/2(r) = \u03c1\u0302\u2020(r)\u03c1\u0302(r), (45)\nwith the corresponding Dyson map,\n\u03c1\u0302(r) = W\u0302 1/2(r). (46)\n6 \u2022 Cholesky decomposition:\nW\u0302 (r) = T\u0302 \u2020(r)T\u0302 (r) = \u03c1\u0302\u2020(r)\u03c1\u0302(r), (47)\ngiving the Dyson map,\n\u03c1\u0302(r) = T\u0302 (r). (48)\nFor the spectral decomposition (43), \u2206\u0302(r) = \u03bbi(r)\u03b4ij (there is no implied summation over repeated indices)\nwith \u03bb(r) > 0 and \u221a \u2206\u0302(r) = \u221a \u03bbi(r)\u03b4ij . For the\nCholesky decomposition (47), the T\u0302 matrix is an upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements. The particular choice of a Dyson map is based on the decomposition scheme which leads to a sparse \u03c1\u0302.\nThe Dyson map leads to a Hermitian form for Maxwell equations in H. Multiplying (25) by \u03c1\u0302 gives,\ni \u2202\u03c8 \u2202t = \u03c1\u0302(r)D\u0302\u03c1\u0302\u22121(r)\u03c8 = D\u0302\u03c1\u03c8, (49)\nwhere \u03c8 = \u03c1\u0302u \u2208 H, and D\u0302\u03c1 = \u03c1\u0302(r)D\u0302\u03c1\u0302\u22121(r) is Hermitian in H The unitary evolution of \u03c8 (r, t) is,\n\u03c8(r, t) = e\u2212itD\u0302\u03c1\u03c80 (r) , (50)\nwhere \u03c80 (r) is the initial condition at time t = 0.\nIn general, any operator A\u0302\u03b7 : H\u03b7 \u2192 H\u03b7 is related to its counterpart A\u0302 in H through a similarity transformation,\nA\u0302 = \u03c1\u0302 A\u0302\u03b7 \u03c1\u0302 \u22121. (51)\nThe Dyson map \u03c1\u0302 connecting H to H\u03b7 can be schematically represented in Figure 1. This diagram illustrates\nthe dual role of the Dyson map. The first is to map the weighted space H\u03b7 into the initial Hilbert space H\nthrough an isometric transformation. This ensures that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian and the evolution is unitary. The second is to map different, not equivalent, representation of elements u and \u03c8 belonging to H. This is evident from the Dyson mapping \u2013 the operator \u03c1\u0302 : H \u2192 H is not unitary in H. In other words, the transformation \u03c1\u0302 : u\u2192 \u03c8 is not a trivial and unitary representation of the initial dynamics (25). However, every other transformation \u03c4\u0302 in H that preserves the dynamics of (49) is unitary. From (49), applying the transforma-\ntion \u03c4\u0302 , the generator D\u0302\u03c4 yields,\nD\u0302\u03c4 = \u03c4\u0302 D\u0302\u03c1\u03c4\u0302 \u22121 = D\u0302\u2020\u03c4 = (\u03c4\u0302 \u22121)\u2020D\u0302\u03c1\u03c4\u0302 \u2020 \u21d2 \u03c4\u0302\u22121 = \u03c4\u0302 \u2020. (52) Thus, all other dynamics preserving transformations are equivalent once the Dyson map \u03c1\u0302 is established.

            "text": "The propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium is governed by classical Maxwell equations. The enticing possibility of an exponential reduction in computational time on quantum computers has led to recasting some topics in classical physics into the framework of quantum information science. We have expressed the Faraday-Ampere equations for a passive, non- dispersive dielectric medium in a form that is similar to the Dirac equation for a massless spin 1 particle. For a medium homogeneous in space, the permittivity and permeability are scalars. In the Dirac- type evolution equation, the electromagnetic fields are expressed either as a six-vector or as Riemann- SilbersteinWeber vectors. When the permittivity and permeability of the medium are functions of space then, in contrast\nto a homogeneous medium, the Maxwell operator M\u0302 and\nthe operator for the constitutive relations W\u0302 do not commute. Even though both operators are Hermitian, their product is not. A remedy is to construct a weighted Hilbert space HW in which the generator of dynamics is pseudo-Hermitian. The Hermitian, positive definite metric operator that defines the inner product within HW is W\u0302 . The norm of a state vector in HW is the electromagnetic energy which, from Poynting\u2019s theorem, is conserved. The connection between the original Hilbert space and HW is established through a Dyson map. Significantly, the Dyson map is a fundamental way to construct a unitary evolution of Maxwell equations for wave propagation in a complex medium. Any other representation, preserving the dynamics, is generated through a unitary transformation of the Dyson map. There are three different Dyson maps that are suitable for connecting the two Hilbert spaces. The preferred Dyson map could be guided by the sparseness of the associated matrix operators. Regardless of the choice, the final form\nof the Faraday-Ampere equations comprises unitary evolution operators. The formal development of Maxwell equations into a unitary evolution equation is applied to a uniaxial, inhomogeneous, dielectric medium. We use a qubit lattice algorithm to illustrate a means of implementing our formalism on to a quantum computer. The backbone of the QLA, which uses the state variable q as its qubit basis, is an interleaved sequence of unitary collision and streaming operators. The collision operators entangle the on-site qubits, while the streaming operators move this entanglement throughout the lattice. In contrast to the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki treatment of noncommuting exponential Hermitian operators, the QLA consists of sparse matrices. The present formulation of QLA needs external potential operators which are sparse but not unitary. However, following [27, 28], the potential operators can be represented as a sum of unitary operators making them amenable for quantum computers. Consequently, as we have shown, it is possible to design the appropriate quantum circuits. Since the polynomial gate complexity of a simulation scales with the number np of qubits which, in turn, are related to the number of spatial grid points, the speedup of quantum computing for simulation with high spatial resolution is quite clear. Even though it is early to estimate the scale of the speedup for QLA algorithms, recent developments provide reasons for optimism. It is likely that optimized QLA will make use of fast Fourier transform techniques for implementing the streaming operators, thereby reducing the number of operations of the streaming operator [30]."
