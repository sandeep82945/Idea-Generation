    "abstractText": "Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful imaging technique for the analysis of biological samples, providing valuable insights into the spatial distribution and structural characterization of lipids. The advancements in high-resolution MSI have made it an indispensable tool for single-cell or subcellular lipidomics. By preserving both intracellular and intercellular information, MSI enables a comprehensive analysis of lipidomics in individual cells and organelles. This enables researchers to delve deeper into the diversity of lipids within cells and to understand the role of lipids in shaping cell behavior. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and future prospects of MSI for cellular/subcellular lipidomics. By keeping abreast of the cutting-edge studies in this field, we will continue to push the boundaries of the understanding of lipid metabolism and the impact of lipids on cellular behavior.",

            "text": "The significance of cellular biology has skyrocketed in the realm of biological sciences, particularly when it comes to analyzing cellular processes at a single-cell level, such as determining cell fate, aging, differentiation, and proliferation [1]. Cells and organelles are the fundamental units of life and play a crucial role in the functioning of biological systems. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular components of these systems is critical to advancing our knowledge of biology and medicine. Lipidomics is an area of research that concentrates on the examination of lipids, a heterogeneous collection of biomolecules that have a pivotal impact on numerous biological functions, including energy storage [2,3], membrane structure and function [4\u20136], and signaling [7,8]. Therefore, understanding the lipidomics of individual cells can give us important information about cell function and cellular signaling pathways. The single-cell approaches, e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), single-cell sequencing, and mass cytometry, have been widely used. For the majority of cellular analyses, cells are typically cultured within Petri dishes or as suspensions prepared from tissue samples and isolated before being sent into instruments. However, isolating a single cell requires precise technical skills and equipment, and any mistake in the process can lead to contamination or loss of cells. In addition, the process of single-cell isolation is often low-yielding, making it challenging to study large populations of cells. The inter-cell analysis is also hindered during isolation, since the spatial distribution of the cells in the natural state is lost, especially when cells are obtained from tissues and re-cultured. Hence, image-based cell profiling has emerged as a high-throughput strategy for intracellular and intercellular analysis, enabling the quantification of phenotypic variations within diverse cell populations, which are among the various techniques used for exploring omics.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062712 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712 2 of 16\nMass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has been developed as a powerful imaging tool for analyzing biological samples at the molecular level [9]. It allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular species within cells and organelles. For cellular analysis, MSI could provide the two-dimensional or three-dimensional molecule information of cells and organelles, such as dynamic profiles of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) [10]. Moreover, with the ability to accurately identify and analyze the lipid structures of individual cells, MSI is providing new information about the complexities of cellular signaling and the regulation of cellular functions [11,12]. Despite recent advancements in MSI, MSI for cellular/subcellular lipidomics has a long way to go to become mature. The primary challenge in mass spectrometry imaging is the collection of spatial lipid information at the cellular scale (i.e., the high spatial resolution), in addition to the processing of data to enable subsequent single-cell lipidomics analysis. This review provides an overview of the recent advancements and future prospects of MSI for cellular/subcellular lipidomics."

            "text": "Single-cell lipidomics is a rapidly growing field that aims to study the lipid composition of individual cells. The significance of single-cell lipidomics lies in its ability to shed light on the biochemical processes occurring within cells and the vital role played by lipids in these processes. In addition to its fundamental importance, single-cell lipidomics also has numerous applications in the study of diseases and pathological conditions. For instance, lipid peroxidation, a chemical reaction that occurs when lipids in the cell membrane are oxidized by free radicals, leading to the formation of highly reactive and potentially harmful compounds known as lipid peroxidation products, has been implicated in several diseases and conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and aging [13,14]. Furthermore, the lipid component has an impact on many human diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of lipid peroxidation is therefore a critical area of research, with potential implications with regard to the prevention and treatment of various diseases. This knowledge could aid in the development of new therapies and drugs for these conditions. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is significant heterogeneity in cell-to-cell lipids [15]. Different cell types, subcellular structures, and physiological states can exhibit different lipid compositions and distributions which have significant impacts on the normal functions of cells and the development of diseases. In-depth studies of this heterogeneity may provide new insights and strategies for preventing and treating relevant diseases. Additionally, investigating cellto-cell lipid heterogeneity can aid in the discovery of new drugs and therapeutic strategies targeting the lipid metabolism. Hence, single-cell lipidomics offer a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity of cells within a tissue, while traditional lipidomics methods analyze the lipid composition of a cell population. By analyzing the lipid composition of individual cells, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the diversity of metabolism within a tissue and the role of lipids in regulating cell behavior. Lipids also play a key role in the functioning of organelles, which are subcellular structures that perform specific functions within the cell. The main organelles found in these cells include the mitochondria, nucleus, Golgi apparatus, endosomes (E), endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes (LE), and peroxisomes. The study of organelle lipidomics, which involves the analysis and characterization of lipids in specific organelles, offers numerous benefits compared to examining the entire cell. The relationship between the distribution of lipids in the organelles of animal cells are shown in Figure 1. Organelles exhibit distinct lipid compositions and profiles that are directly linked to their functions. For instance, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital organelle that regulates lipid metabolism and is the site of lipid synthesis and modification, including phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol. By examining the lipid composition of the ER, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the regulation of lipid synthesis and trafficking, as well as the impact of various metabolic and environmental stressors on ER function [16,17]. In the Golgi, lipids undergo various chemical modifications, such as acylation, glycosylation,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712 3 of 16\nand phosphorylation, which alter their properties and functionality. Mitochondria also play a crucial role in lipid metabolism and contain key enzymes involved in the oxidative degradation of fatty acids, which provides energy for the cell. Furthermore, mitochondria are the primary site of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, making the study of organelle lipidomics particularly relevant to understanding cellular metabolism and the associated pathologies. Additionally, researchers can gain insights into the functions of specific lipids in cellular transport and signaling by analyzing the lipid profiles of vesicles [18].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16 instance, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital organelle that regulates lipid metabolism and is the site of lipid synthesis and modification, including phospholipids, sphin-\ngolipids, and cholesterol.

In this discussion, we will delve into the principles and recent advancements in these two MSI techniques.\n3.2.1.

Far-field technology has its resolution limited by optical diffraction, whereas nearfield technology does not have this limitation. Within near-field technology, there are further subcategories including apertureless tip enhancement techniques and aperture tip desorption techniques [27]. The group led by Wei Hang has made significant contributions to the advancement of near-field-based MSI with aperture tip desorption. In 2019, Hang et al. developed a near-field desorption post ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (NDPI-TOFMS) which was able to achieve a resolution ranging from 250 nm to 350 nm, and even imaged HeLa cells with a resolution of 250 nm(Figure 3a) [28].

(c) Schematics of MALDI\u20132\u2013MSI [30]. (d) Schematics of t\u2013MALDI\u20132\u2013MSI [22].\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a most widely used ionization technique of far-field-based MSI [31]. The fundamental principle behind MALDI is the ionization of the sample through laser-assisted desorption and ionization. To achieve this, a sample is combined with a matrix, which absorbs the laser energy and facilitates the desorption and ionization of the sample molecules. The resulting sample-matrix mixture is\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712 6 of 16\nthen deposited on a sample target and subjected to a laser pulse. This laser pulse causes the sample molecules to be ionized and desorbed from the matrix into the mass spectrometer for analysis. For the applications of MALDI in single-cell imaging, spatial resolution is the most important limiting factor. The spatial resolution of MALDI is influenced by several factors, including laser spot size, matrix size, and sample preparation method. The laser spot size is a crucial factor in determining the spatial resolution of MALDI, as smaller laser spots provide higher spatial resolution. However, this comes with the disadvantage of lower sample collection efficiency and signal intensity. The size of the matrix crystals used in MALDI also contributes to the spatial resolution, with larger crystals scattering the laser light and reducing the spatial resolution [32]. Finally, the sample preparation method used can impact the spatial resolution of MALDI, with smaller sample spots deposited onto the MALDI target, resulting in higher spatial resolution, while larger spots scatter the laser light and reduce the spatial resolution. For most commercial instruments, the pixel size of MALDI MSI are in the range of 5\u201320 \u00b5m [33], which is not adequate for imaging at the cellular or subcellular level. Theoretically, a higher resolution can be achieved by focusing the laser beam to a smaller pixel. However, reduced ion abundance and ion suppression effects can hinder the acquisition of an ion image of high quality at high spatial resolution. The post-ionization (PI) strategy, laser-induced post-ionization (MALDI-2), in which the beam of a PI laser interacts with the expanding particle plume in an nitrogen cooling gas, has been developed to increase the ion yields at a ~5 \u00b5m lateral resolution [30] (Figure 3c). By improving the laser focusing objective and applying the matrix, the atmospheric pressure (AP) MALDI setup with a lateral resolution of 1.4 \u00b5m has been used to identify various metabolites expressed at the subcellular scale in a single-celled eukaryotic organism P. caudatum [34]. To elevate the MALDI-MSI to a new level, M. Niehaus et al. proposed the t-MALDI-2 [22], which combines the transmission-mode MALDI with MALDI-2 (Figure 3d). In t-MALDI-2, the 600 nm resolution has been achieved and the distribution of glycolipids and phospho- in a Vero B4 cell has been visualized. With ongoing advancements in the technology and a better understanding of the factors that influence spatial resolution, such as laser focusing objectives and matrix applications, it is expected that laser-based MSI will continue to evolve and provide even more precise and detailed results.\n3.2.2. Ion-Beam-Based MSI\nAs the most widely used ion-beam-based MSI, Secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is a surface analysis technique that utilizes a focused primary ion beam to sputter surface molecules from a sample and create secondary ions [35]. The secondary ions are then analyzed by a mass spectrometer to determine their mass-to-charge ratios. SIMS provides high-resolution, subsurface chemical imaging with lateral resolutions in the nanometer range, which allows researchers to identify chemical compounds at the molecular level within complex samples, providing a detailed understanding of their composition and distribution. In the realm of single-cell imaging, the detection sensitivity of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and the minimization of ion fragmentation are of utmost importance. One of the inherent limitations of SIMS is the limited abundance of molecular ions available for lipid structure identification due to the generation of a large number of fragment ions. The size of the primary ion beam has a direct effect on the spatial resolution, with smaller beam sizes providing improved resolution but also reducing the number of ions. This presents a challenge in lipid annotation, as the number of molecular ions becomes even more limited. Furthermore, the energy of the primary ions has a significant impact as it determines the depth of sample penetration. While using higher energy ions can result in a smaller primary ion beam size, it also increases fragmentation and complicates molecular annotation efforts. SIMS can achieve a lateral resolution of 10 nm in specific configurations. In order to effectively gather enough signals from secondary ions produced by biological samples such as lipids, a lateral resolution of \u2212100 nm is often utilized. This resolution is deemed ade-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712 7 of 16\nquate for imaging cellular structures, but the limitations of hard ionization mode and low ion yield in small pixels have restricted the full potential of SIMS for cellular/subcellular lipidomics analysis. Recently, researchers have made strides in addressing these limitations by both increasing the ion yield and softening SIMS. Gas Cluster Ion Beam SIMS (GCIBSIMS), an ionization method that minimizes fragmentation, has been developed as an alternative to conventional SIMS. The development of 3D OrbiSIMS, a hybrid instrument that combines the high spatial resolution of GCIB-SIMS and the high mass resolution of orbitrap, has enabled the visualization of metabolites in three dimensions with subcellular resolution [36] (Figure 4a). The type of cluster ion beam used in GCIB-SIMS has a significant impact on the imaging quality. To further improve the resolution of GCIB-SIMS, the Winograd group proposed the use of a 70 keV CO2 cluster ion beam. This innovative approach has been shown to effectively image high molecular weight phospholipids (PLs) in subcellular structures at a resolution of 1 \u00b5m [37] (Figure 4b). Furthermore, the John C. Vickerman group discovered that the use of H2O clusters eliminates the compromise between sensitivity and resolution, resulting in a 10\u2013100 times increase in ion production compared to Ar1000 beams and C60 [38]. When compared to Ar2000 cluster beams, water cluster beams have the potential to enhance the ion yield in a 1 \u00b5m2 area by 100\u20131000 times [39]. This innovative H2O cluster GCIB-SIMS has been successfully applied to image neurons in frozen-hydrated samples at the single-cell or subcellular level [40]. In addition, SIMS has low sample surface damage, allowing for multiple analyses or coupling with other imaging modalities. For example, (H2O)n-GCIB and C60-SIMS can be combined to enable the multi-omics imaging of different cell types in breast cancer tissues (Figure 4d) [41]. It is also worth noting that Dae Won Moon et al. achieved the subcellular SIMS imaging of wet cells without treatment by using single-layer graphene, preserving the natural distribution of lipid molecules in cells to the greatest extent possible (Figure 4c) [42]. These advances in SIMS-MSI have opened new avenues for imaging biological samples with unprecedented detail and clarity."

            "text": "The utilization of image-based analysis strategies is commonly known for its highthroughput nature. However, in the context of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI), the imaging process for the analysis of the lipidome of individual cells on a pixel-by-pixel basis can be rather lengthy. This is particularly true for microprobe-mode MSI, where higher resolution results in a prolonged imaging process and the requirement for ultra-high resolution when imaging at the cellular/subcellular level. Moreover, the implementation of tandem mass spectrometry further limits imaging throughput. Efforts have been directed towards accelerating high-resolution MSI, such as the implementation of compressed sensing, and dynamic sparse sampling [55,56], with the aim of improving throughput. However, the imaging process still requires the comprehensive scanning of all pixels on the slides, even though only a fraction of these pixels correspond to the cells or organelles of interest. To overcome this limitation and enhance MSI throughput, it is imperative to first precisely locate each cell or organelle, that is, to perform single-cell or organelle recognition,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712 11 of 16\nand then to program the scan path accordingly. Historically, this task was achieved through manual means, which was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, various statistical and supervised learning techniques, such as support vector machines, genetic algorithms, and Markovmodels [57\u201359], have been employed to automate singlecell or organelle recognition. Moreover, the utilization of color information in cell images, in addition to the conventional grayscale changes at cell edges, has been shown to be an effective means of assisting cell detection [60], but only in imaging techniques that capture information in color dimensions. With the advent of deep learning, various protocols have been established that leverage deep neural networks to increase the efficiency and accuracy of cell detection [61\u201364]. In conclusion, the low throughput of single-cell MSI can pose a significant limitation to its widespread use, and there remains ample room for improvement in this area. The integration of advanced techniques such as deep learning and image-guided protocols may hold the key to resolving this issue and advancing the field of single-cell imaging."

            "heading": "4.2. Sensitivity and Coverage",
            "text": "Sensitivity refers to the ability to detect low levels of analytes within the sample and is often quantified by the limit of detection (LOD). High sensitivity is of utmost importance in high spatial resolution mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) due to its ability to detect molecular species with low abundance within cells and subcellular structures. This attribute is particularly relevant in biological systems where the molecular composition of cells and subcellular structures can exhibit significant variability, and where low-abundance molecular species can have a critical impact on cellular processes. The specific roles played by different isomers of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in cell signaling and membrane organization have been well documented in the literature. These lipid isomers can be distinguished through tandem mass spectrometry. However, the high spatial resolution of the instrument poses a challenge in terms of the abundance of ions that can be analyzed in a single pixel during MS analysis. The higher the resolution, the fewer ions that are available for analysis, making it difficult to perform multiple MS/MS analyses. The success of wide-coverage MS/MS analysis at the single-cell scale heavily relies on the sensitivity of the instrument. This is because the sensitivity of the instrument determines the minimum amount of sample that can be analyzed in a single pixel, as well as the accuracy and reliability of the results. A more sensitive instrument can detect low-abundance species, improving the coverage of lipid structure identification and enabling a more comprehensive analysis of cell signaling and membrane organization. In the context of single-cell or organelle analysis, sensitivity and the low abundance of molecules can significantly limit the variety of lipids that can be structurally identified. However, merely increasing sensitivity is not enough, as traditional data-dependent acquisition (DDA) tandem mass spectrometry analyzes only a few ions within a narrow isolation window at a time to identify their structures, while other analytes are wasted and can only be analyzed in subsequent injections. The development of data-independent acquisition (DIA) tandem mass spectrometry methods has increased the utilization rate of analytes with lower abundance to some extent, as multiple ions can be fragmented concurrently. However, the obstacle to the application of DIA lies in how to analyze the obtained mass spectra, and various deconvolution methods have been proposed to make it possible to use DIA mode MSI for the analysis of lipid spatial distribution [65,66]. In a study at a tissue level, Guo et al. utilized photochemical derivatization to enhance the imaging of 20 phospholipid C=C-localized isomers [67]. This method has the potential to achieve single-cell scale identification of the spatial location of these lipid isomers, as long as the sensitivity of the imaging is improved to an adequate level. Therefore, the optimization of sensitivity remains a lively area of research, with ongoing efforts aimed at developing advanced techniques to improve the LOD and enhance the accuracy of MSI experiments. Moreover, existing research has demonstrated that the sensitivity of mass spectrometry imaging can be improved through chemical derivatization methods that enhance ionization\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2712 12 of 16\nand increase molecular stability [68]. The development of these techniques is crucial for the advancement of MSI in the field of biological research, allowing for a more precise and comprehensive analysis of cellular and subcellular processes."

As previously mentioned, MSI faces difficulties in characterizing the size, shape, and boundaries of cells in tissue sections, which can be easily achieved through other imaging techniques such as fluorescence microscopy. However, the implementation of multimodal imaging presents several challenges, including the requirement for the preservation of the molecular composition of cells and the avoidance of significant ion suppression. The integration of multiple sets of data generated from different imaging modalities requires accurate alignment at the micron level, given the micron-scale resolution of cellular structures. The integration of multiple ionization methods of MSI has the potential to yield a more comprehensive analysis of substances. While each single ionization technique has its limitations, the combination of multiple MSI modes provides a broader scope of substance analysis. For instance, MALDI excels in detecting large molecules such as proteins, however it lacks the necessary spatial resolution. Conversely, SIMS boasts a high spatial resolution, yet the molecular ions produced are low in abundance and biased towards smaller molecules like metabolites. By integrating MALDI-MSI with SIMS-MSI, researchers have been able to enhance the information content and image quality of mass spectrometry imaging [69,70]. Furthermore, even within the same class of ionization imaging, multiple modalities can be integrated, as demonstrated by the successful combination of H2O cluster GCIB-SIMS and C60 SIMS. The multimodal MSI offers the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular biology. However, it also presents a number of challenges that must be addressed in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. The development of robust and reliable multimodal imaging methods will significantly enhance our ability to study cellular biology at a high level of detail."

With improved techniques and methods for data analysis, MSI is now a powerful tool for complete cellular lipidomics analysis. By providing in-depth information on the spatial distribution and structure of lipids in individual cells, MSI has the potential to greatly deepen our understanding of metabolic diversity within tissues and the crucial role of lipids in regulating cellular behavior. The detailed characterization of biomolecules from single cells or organelles in tissues also requires tandem MS imaging, which may become the next climax of MSI. Certainly, instrumental and methodological innovation are necessary to support such research efforts. However, limitations such as the speed and sensitivity of MSI imaging, as well as the challenge of assigning measurement data to individual cells, may present barriers to the widespread application of MSI in cellular lipidomics. Nevertheless, these limitations also present opportunities for future development and improvement in the field, particularly in the development of computational methods [71].
