Based on the provided text, the future research directions mentioned are as follows:

1. "First, almost all generators are based on a single image, and TGDM is no exception, which inevitably introduces temporal inconsistency. To boost the coherence of the generated talking videos, previous works [19] exploit the synthesized image as the source face for the next time step, resulting in a smoother transition between frames since the adjacent frames share the most consistent texture. However, such a frame-by-frame strategy has the problem of error propagation when encountering sudden movements, resulting in face degradation in all subsequent frames."

2. "Besides, our method retains some disadvantages of the diffusion model. For example, it takes about 45 ms on one V100 GPU to generate a single face under the T = 1000 DDPM setting, which is unacceptable in the real application. We also do not train the model for a longer time, considering the high consumption of the diffusion model."

3. "For efficiency, our model only supports 256Ã— 256 image generation. Although DDIM [73] and LDMs [74] have alleviated the above problems, we hope to propose an intuitive design like StyleGAN to allow efficient high-resolution face generation."
