HF has emerged as a chronic condition that needs to be managed on multiple fronts. Hospital resources are more limited than ever due to various factors that directly impact staff and hospital space available to manage and treat patients with HF. As a result, there is increasing attention to the current state of this progressive disease and ways to improve patient outcomes.\nPURPOSE: This paper examines HF and the current and future treatment landscape, the need to reevaluate terms and definitions, and the opportunity to treat HF with the right treatment at the right time. Treatments in development and potential new investigational therapies are also discussed.\nCONCLUSION: To meet the current challenge, HF treatment must adapt. For other disease states, we have more personalized, nimble, and timely treatment strategies that harness windows of opportunity to help maximize outcomes and reduce overwhelming costs to the health care system. HF treatment is evolving with new guidelines and treatments that hold the promise of greater personalization through additions to existing treatments that are directed by medical guidelines, since each patient is unique and requires more than a one-size-fits-all approach. In addition, advances in remote monitoring, in-home care, and telemedicine are creating a more individualized treatment approach. Therefore, it becomes critical for all health care decision makers to be aware of the tools and resources available in treatment guidelines, individualized treatment options, telemedicine, and other ways of expanding the existing toolbox to enhance patient centricity in HF treatment.\nAm J Manag Care. 2022;28:S255-S267\nFor author information and disclosures, see end of text.\nC ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world, with an estimated 17.9 million fatalities in 2019 that represented 32% of all deaths. Of these deaths, a staggering 85% were due to heart attack and stroke.1 Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome with\nsymptoms and signs that result from any structural or functional\nimpairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. HF often\naffects only the left or right side of the heart, but it can affect both.\nLeft-sided HF is usually caused by coronary artery disease, a heart attack, or long-term uncontrolled high blood pressure.1 Right-sided\nHF generally results from advanced left-sided HF or significant\npulmonary disease. Biventricular HF affects both sides of the heart,\nand it can cause the same symptoms as left-sided and right-sided\nHF. The type of HF that patients have upon presentation determines the medication they will use for treatment.1 This paper focuses on\nthe most predominant type of HF\u2014left-sided HF\u2014which will be\nreferred to as \u201cHF\u201d throughout.\nThe incidence of HF has reached epidemic proportions; it is the most rapidly growing CVD health burden worldwide.2 Absolute\nnumbers of patients with HF have been increasing due to the aging\npopulation, global population growth, and improved survival after diagnosis.3 With an estimated 64.3 million individuals living with\nHF globally, it is a clinical and public health crisis associated with\nsignificant mortality, morbidity, and health care expenditures, particularly among those 65 years and older (Text Box).3-11\nR E P O R T\nFrom a payer perspective, heart failure is a growing clinical and economic issue, especially as the population ages.

HF was the underlying cause of 80,000 deaths in 2017\u2014about 22,000 more than in 2011.12\nMoving forward, it will become more critical to focus on heart\nhealth for those aged 65 years and older, which grew by approxi-\nmately 10 million individuals between 2011 and 2017 and is projected to increase by another 22 million by 2030.12\nHF Is the Leading Cause of Hospitalization Among Older Adults8 Until 2012, the rate of hospitalizations for HF in the United States\nwas decreasing; however, from 2013 to 2017, the trend reversed. In\n2017, there were 1.2 million HF hospitalizations in the United States\namong 924,000 patients with HF, representing a 26% increase from\n2013 in HF hospitalizations and the number of patients hospitalized\nwith HF. The increase in patient hospitalizations is largely due to the aging population.16\nHospitalization costs are the key driver of HF-related costs. The total cost of HF care in the United States exceeds $30 billion annually.5\nApproximately three-fourths of patients with primary or comorbid\nHF who had emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations\nwere Medicare beneficiaries; further, Medicare beneficiaries with HF have the highest readmission rate of patients with any condition.8\nUnderstanding the Evolution of HF Ejection fraction (EF) has emerged as a unique predictor of CV\noutcomes. It is a measurement expressed as the percentage of blood\nthe left ventricle (LV) pumps out with each contraction. Reduced\nEF is key to a patient\u2019s disease progression, because a decrease in\ncardiac output triggers a pathologic chain of events that results in\nsystolic HF. In fact, in patients with HF, declining LVEF is a mean-\ningful and strong predictor of CV outcomes, including all-cause\nmortality, CV mortality, sudden death, HF-related death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and HF hospitalization.17\nHF, in general, is often described as a complex condition with\na wide range of manifestations; its categorization has evolved to\ncomprise 4 subtypes: HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), HF with improved\nEF (HFimpEF), HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) (Figure 2).16 These subtypes differ considerably\nin terms of demographic distribution, underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and available preventive and therapeutic options.16,18\nCharacterized by an EF at or below 40%, HFrEF is accompa-\nnied by progressive LV dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling (Figure\u00a03).9,17-22 It is often preceded by acute or chronic loss of\ncardiomyocytes due to ischemia, infarction, myocarditis, genetic mutation, or valvular disease.2\n\u2022 Growing awareness of the need for individualized care should create\nmomentum for payers to improve coordination of care and tailor treatment for patients during their HF treatment journey.\n\u203a Earlier identification between HFpEF or HFrEF helps clinicians\nadapt treatment to the individual patient.\n\u2022 The importance of WHF in the ambulatory population with HF and\nHFrEF remains poorly defined, as a large quantity of data regarding WHF has focused on those hospitalized with HF.\n\u2022 New treatments that supplement existing GDMT regimens are on the\nhorizon, and they are entering the market at an increasing pace.\n\u2022 Improved EF has been introduced to describe patients with previous\nHFrEF who now have an EF of 40% or greater. According to 2022 revisions of the ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines, these patients should continue their HFrEF treatment.\n\u2022 Payers and other organized health care decision makers should be\naware of changing tides in HF treatment paradigms.\nACC, American College of Cardiology; AHA, American Heart Association; EF, ejection fraction; GDMT, guideline-directed medical therapy; HF, heart failure; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; HFSA, Heart Failure Society of America; WHF, worsening heart failure.\nKEY SUMMARY POINTS\nTEXT BOX. Heart Failure at a Glance5-11\nApproximately 6.2 million adults in the United States have HF, with approximately 1 million new cases diagnosed annually\u2014and the prevalence continues to rise.5\n\u2022 In 2018, HF was the cause of 379,800 fatalities.6 \u2022 The 5-year survival for HF is comparable to that for lung cancer (22%) and significantly lower than that for colorectal cancer (65%).7 \u2022 Among Medicare patients, the mortality rate for HF is 50% within 5 years of diagnosis.8 \u2022 Patients with HFrEF have a 5-year survival rate of only 25% after hospitalization.9 \u2022 Risk for death after HF hospitalization rises to as high as 35% by year 1, with risk essentially doubling with each subsequent hospitalization.10\nProjections suggest that by 2030, the total cost of HF will increase by 127% to $69.8 billion, amounting to approximately $244 for every US adult.11\nIc on\ns \u00a9\nA ha\n-S of\nt / A\ndo be\nS to\nck /\nM od\nifi ed\nb y\nJu lia\nnn e\nC os\nte llo\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE\u00ae Supplement VOL. 28, NO. 14 S257\nRETHINKING HEART FAILURE: PATIENT CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT\nA recent retrospective cohort study followed 27,323 patients\nand 19,445 matched controls for over 223,000 patient-years while measuring outcomes based on EF values.19 Regardless of CVD history,\nEF significantly predicted the risk of several different outcomes,\nincluding total mortality, CV death, CV hospitalizations, and HF hospitalizations (Figure 4).19\nRedefining What It Means to Have HF The New York Heart Association (NYHA) and the American College\nof Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society\nof America (ACC/AHA/HFSA) are the medical societies that devel-\noped systems for classifying and staging HF. The NYHA and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have created 2 systems that are complementary.16\nThe NYHA classification is a subjective assessment used to\ncharacterize symptoms and functional capacity of patients with\nsymptomatic (stage C) HF or advanced HF (stage D). It is a subjec-\ntive assessment by a clinician that can change over time; however,\nit is widely used in clinical practice to determine the eligibility of patients for treatment strategies.16\nThe ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines provide an evidence-based\napproach to managing HF with the intent to improve patient quality\nof care. The guidelines characterize HF disease progression using\n4\u00a0stages; it recently underwent significant modification\u2014including\na revised definition for the condition. The changes represent\na\u00a0shift in perspective and a building momentum toward significant\nchange in HF treatment. The ACC/AHA/HFSA recognized the need\nto provide more patient-centric, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians \u00a0(Figure 5).16\nUS adults by age (years)\nP op\nul at\nio n\nw it\nh H\nF (p\ner ce\nnt )\nHF is the 2nd largest non-maternity cause of hospitalizations15\u2014more than all cancer hospitalizations combined16 ~1.1 M hospitalizations, up 4% from the previous year15,17\nMedian survival of HF is worse than all but 7 major cancers13,19,\u00a7 HF median survival is ~5 years13\nTwo-thirds of HF costs in the US are due to hospitalizations18\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n20-39 40-59 60-79 >80\nFIgure 1.

For example, updates include a new\ncategory of EF, HF with improved ejection fraction, or HFimpEF.\nIn\u00a0these patients, treatment should be continued to prevent relapse\nof HF and LV dysfunction, even in patients who may become asymp-\ntomatic, since symptom resolution and improvement in cardiac\nfunction after treatment should be classified as remission, not full\nand sustained recovery. According to the new guidance, patients\nwith previous HFrEF who have an EF over 40% are now classified as having \u201cimproved EF\u201d and should continue HFrEF treatment.16\nThe evolution of the guidelines increasingly reflects HF as a disease\nwithout a static trajectory. There are windows of opportunity to change\ncourse and adjust treatment accordingly for a chronic condition.\nAnother critical adaptation to the ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines is\nthe identification of early risk factors for HF (stage A) and patients at\nrisk of more severe disease. This takes a more preventive approach\nto help provide treatment before structural changes or signs of\ndecreased heart function occur (stage B). Stage A is now defined as\n\u201cat risk for HF,\u201d stage B as \u201cpre-HF,\u201d stage C as \u201csymptomatic HF,\u201d\nand stage D as \u201cadvanced HF.\u201d The revisions also introduce a trajec-\ntory of stage C HF that recognizes that symptoms of patients with\nHFrEF may improve or worsen, yet the patients remain in stage C and require continued treatment or modifications.16\nThe 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines emphasize prevention\nand individualized treatment and define HF as a complex clinical\nsyndrome with symptoms and signs that result from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood.16\nOverall, the updated definitions, classifications, and stages of\nHF are steps to achieve clarity and uniformity of care. However, a\nrather low percentage of patients are treated by all indicated thera-\npies, and the majority of these patients do not reach target doses of the guideline-recommended treatments.23 Consequently, much\nwork needs to be done to reverse treatment inertia that resulted from many contributing factors.23 The NYHA functional classification\nsystem can have multiple interpretations, which is a limitation of symptom-driven treatment strategies in HF.24\nChanges Are Occurring on a Global Scale Due to the need for universal consensus in the definitions and\nclassifications of HF, members of the HFSA, the Heart Failure\nAssociation of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Japanese\nHeart Failure Society assembled a consensus document emphasizing\nthat HF is a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs caused by structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality.20\nRealizing that semantic changes are needed, the committee also\ntargeted a universal definition and classification of HF:\n\u2022 There is a need to move away from the traditionally accepted\nterm \u201cheart failure\u201d and transition to the term \u201cheart function.\u201d25\nARNi, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor; CV, cardiovascular; EF, ejection fraction; HF heart failure; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; SGL2i, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitor. aProportion of patients with CV death or HF hospitalization is derived from aggregate data from the CHARM Program (CHARM-Alternative, CHARM-Added, and CHARM-Preserved pivotal trials) evaluating the efficacy and safety of candesartan in patients with New York Heart Association Class II to IV HF. Because the CHARM Program predates newer therapies for the treatment of HFrEF (eg, SGLT2i, ARNi), current rates for CV death or HF hospitalization may vary. bAdjusted hazard ratio per 100 patient-years for each 10% reduction in LVEF below 45% is 1.21 (95% CI, 1.15-1.28).\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE\u00ae Supplement VOL. 28, NO. 14 S259\nRETHINKING HEART FAILURE: PATIENT CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT\n\u2022 Clinicians should opt for the term \u201cpersistent HF\u201d rather than\n\u201cstable HF,\u201d because, even during stable HF, there are oppor-\ntunities to optimize therapies that prevent further worsening and/or deterioration or adverse outcomes.5\n\u2022 \u201cHF in remission\u201d is defined as an important substitution for\nthe conventionally used term \u201crecovered HF\u201d for patients\nwho experience resolution of their symptoms and/or systolic\nfunction, as HF is known to frequently relapse. It is impor-\ntant that clinicians convey to patients that improvement does not mean that their HF is cured.5\nImpact of Social Determinants of Health on HF Management Approximately 3.6 million women in the United States are affected\nby HF, and their experience is different than that of men. The causes\nof HF in women also are different; they are linked to high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and diabetes.23\nThese causes may explain why women with HF require hospital-\nization more frequently than men, with approximately 40% of patients hospitalized with HFrEF being women.22 After women develop coronary heart disease, the risk of HF is high.26\nBlack patients are underprescribed certain treatments. As with women, treatment modalities are different for Black patients.27\nFor example, hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (H-ISDN) therapy is recommended to treat those with moderate to severe HFrEF.16\nDespite guideline recommendations, very few contemporary\nstudies have examined the real-world use of H-ISDN. A 2017 study\nof 5168 Black patients with HF between 2007 and 2013 found that H-ISDN remained underused in those with HF and HFrEF.28 In\naddition, Black patients may need treatment adjustments based\non use of concomitant therapies and differing treatment modalities compared with other patient populations.28\nDespite these disparities, current evidence of HF treatment is limited to clinical trials, not real-world, patient populations.26\nTherapeutic developments in HF apply mostly to men; they have\nnot been adequately studied in women. Similarly, Black patients\nhave been underrepresented in clinical trials, and studies have\nnot been designed to prospectively study differences in treatment\noutcomes. As a result, only approximations of risks and benefits can guide therapy for the least-studied populations.29\nNew research is shedding light on social determinant disparities\nin clinical terms. For example, the concept of lifetime risk is now\nconsidered to be important, and this has shed light on population\nACC, American College of Cardiology; AHA, American Heart Association; CVD, cardiovascular disease; HF, heart failure; HFSA, Heart Failure Society of America; NYHA, New York Heart Association.

Lifetime risk estimates account for the\nchance of developing the disease of interest and the risk of competing\ncauses of death. An analysis confirmed that lifetime risks for HFrEF vary by sex, race, and history of antecedent\u00a0MI.18 Among partici-\npants with antecedent MI before HF diagnosis, lifetime risks for\nHFrEF increased 4-fold compared with those without antecedent MI.\nGuideline-Directed Medical Therapy and\u00a0Individualized Strategies The use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) reduces morbidity and mortality in HF.30 However, despite a few recent\nbreakthroughs in HF treatment, the current standard of care is falling\nshort. Clinicians and payers are eagerly awaiting HF treatments that\ncan improve symptoms and reduce both admissions and mortality\nwithout deleterious effects. Changes and classification schemes in\nthe new definition offer opportunities for better communication\nand patient engagement, wherein clinicians can focus on imple-\nmentation of GDMT across a continuum to improve outcomes.\nGDMT refers to initial medical therapy with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), a \u03b2-blocker, a sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and a mineralocorticoid receptor\nantagonist.31 Patients who do not have access to an ARNi (often\nfor financial reasons) should receive an angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).\nAs evidenced by the increase in morbidity and mortality in patients\nwith HFrEF, optimized GDMT may no longer be viable for patients\nwho have exhausted GDMT treatment options. In addition, some\nof the recommendations may be useful for early stages of HF but\nlack evidence of efficacy at more advanced stages.\nGDMT has the potential to be the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy for HFrEF.16 However, it presents inherent challenges,\nbecause patients with HF represent a heterogeneous cohort with\nmultiple comorbidities. Among Medicare beneficiaries with chronic\nHF, 41% to 55% have 5 or more noncardiac comorbidities, which\nincreases the risk of hospitalization in this patient population and all hospitalizations proportionately.32\nA 2020 review of HF clinical trials published between 2001 and\n2016 with a cumulative total of 215,508 patients uncovered that\nthe reporting of comorbidities was more common in HFrEF trials.\nCommon comorbidities included hypertension, ischemic heart\ndisease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and chronic\nkidney disease. Conditions with the largest increases over time were\nhypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. In addi-\ntion, overall rates of comorbidity reporting in HF clinical trials were\nlow, which may be due to criteria excluding certain comorbidities\nto reduce competing mortality risk and/or to improve tolerability\nof therapy. Other studies have shown an increase in the number\nof patients with HF with multiple comorbidities over time, which may explain the recent US rise in HF mortality.33\nIn the clinical setting, implementation of HF treatment is not\nconsistent with current guidelines (Figure 6).24,34-37\nThe new ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines call for better incorpora-\ntion of and devotion to social health determinants for vulnerable\npatient populations at risk for health disparities. Multidisciplinary\nmanagement strategies should target both known risks for CVD and\nsocial determinants of health to level the playing field and address disparate outcomes in HF.16 Optimal pharmacologic therapy of HFrEF\nis meticulously selected based on evidence-based treatment guide-\nlines; however, a large proportion of patients with chronic HFrEF\neither do not receive GDMT or are underdosed in clinical practice.\nThis may be due to tolerability issues related to low blood pressure,\nlow heart rate, impaired renal function, or hyperkalemia. Adding\nto the complexity of HF treatment is that most patients usually\nreceive multiple concomitant therapies. Therefore, a personalized\napproach to HF treatment (eg, adjusting GDMT to patient profiles)\nmay help achieve more accurate and comprehensive therapy for\neach patient than is available with more traditional, forced titra-\ntion of each drug class before the next treatment is started. Patients\nwith HFrEF who develop worsening HF may not receive optimal\ntreatment at critical times throughout their HF journey. In addition,\nRETHINKING HEART FAILURE: PATIENT CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT\nnovel treatments are needed for patients with worsening HF, especially if they do not tolerate available HF therapies.34\nRethinking Treatment of Worsening HF In clinical practice, patients with HF are often treated reactively\nafter symptoms arise. In particular, attention has been focused on\nworsening HF (WHF), which carries an unfavorable prognosis and\npresents an opportunity for intensification and personalization of\ntreatment for HF. WHF is common and defined as worsening HF\nsigns and symptoms in a patient with chronic HF after a period of clinical stability that requires escalation of therapy.38\nWHF, an effective measure in making treatment decisions, allows\nuse of more personalized therapies at the optimal time. This may\nbe especially critical for a patient population for whom time is of\nthe essence and specialized therapies may help sooner.\nWhen presenting with reduced EF, WHF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality.38 It is now recog-\nnized as worsening or deterioration of HF signs and symptoms in\na patient with chronic HF after a period of clinical stability that\nrequires escalation of therapy and is a clinical entity independent of the location of care.37 The choice of location (eg, inpatient, outpa-\ntient, ED) is inherently subjective and subject to multiple potential clinical and nonclinical factors.37 Based on recent literature, patients with WHF typically present with any of the following paramaters10:\n\u2022 NT-proBNP level above 3800 pg/mL, or\n\u2022 EF of 35% or less, or\n\u2022 ED visit or hospitalization for HF in the past 12 months.\nWHF is increasingly used as an accepted inclusion criterion, end point, or part of a combined end point in clinical trials.10 In\u00a0general\nterms, WHF is worsening of chronic HF that occurs during hospital-\nization or in the ambulatory setting. It often results in adjustments\nto long-term therapy and inpatient hospitalization and is associ-\nEssentially, HF has become a medical epidemic with significant medical and economic costs. The increasing number of individuals who will be diagnosed with chronic HF over the coming decade should cause the health care community to have an intensified focus on differential diagnosis of various causes and types of HF and the associated treatment. We must learn to individualize care for each patient in order to provide optimal medical outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and impact longterm morbidity and mortality. This will not be an easy task but is an essential crisis that must be addressed with urgency.\n\u2014 Charles A. Stemple, DO, MBA Medical Director (Former), Humana\nThe most challenging patients with HF (worsening EF, renal dysfunction, borderline hemodynamics) account for a disproportionate amount of utilization and spending. For many of these patients, GDMT is not an option. It\u00a0is\u00a0critical to distinguish the gap between evidence and clinical practice.\n\u2014 Nihar R. Desai, MD, MPH Yale School of Medicine\nS262 NOVEMBER 2022 www.ajmc.com\nR E P O R T\nAs shown in Figure 8,10,37,39 over a 1-year period, patients with\nWHF had a significantly higher rate of subsequent HF hospital-\nization than did those without WHF (53% vs 1%; P < .001) and a\nsignificantly higher rate of composite outcome of HF hospitalization or CV death (56% vs 6%; P < .001).10\nEffect of Hospitalization on Outcomes in Patients With HF With high rates of mortality and high risk of readmission, hospital-\nizations for HF are significant events with downstream implications\nfor patients, health care systems, and payers. Long-term outcomes\namong acute HF survivors remain poor despite a similar case mix\nover the past 2 decades. Increased study of management strategies\nafter hospital discharge is imperative, including but not limited to\nprognosis reassessment, inpatient-to-clinic transitions, and HF systems-based ambulatory care.45\nRecurrent hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality as a result\nof HF remain high despite increasing technology for pharmacotherapy and device-based therapies.46 Patients with a lower EF have\na significantly increased risk of hospitalization due to HF compared with patients with the highest EF.19 HFrEF is regarded as the most\nchallenging HF syndrome to treat\u2014with patients in dire need of help and having the highest rates of hospitalization.47-49\nThe previously mentioned 2020 case-controlled cohort study\nof 27,323 patient outcomes that included total\nmortality, CV death, CV hospitalizations, and HF hospitalizations as a function of EF found that19:\n\u2022 Hospitalization rates among patients\nwith EF below the 36% to 45% range\nwere more than double those of other\nEF groups,\n\u2022 HF hospitalizations were 2- to 3-fold\nhigher among those with an EF less\nthan 25% compared with the 46% to\n55% group, and\n\u2022 Overall, the highest number of hospital-\nizations was observed among patients\nwith an EF from 25% to 35%.\nRehospitalization Rates Are\u00a0Not Only Increasing\u2014They Are\u00a0Accelerating\nRehospitalization is a major issue for patients\nwith HF, as it could increase the risk of death,\nresult in poor quality of life (QOL), and become an enormous economic burden.50\nRehospitalization rates for HF are among the\nhighest across diagnoses. Approximately 20%\nof patients with HF are readmitted within\n30\u00a0days, and about 50% are readmitted within 6\u00a0months after leaving the hospital (Figure 9).51\nThere is a dire need for vigilance and urgency\nfollowing discharge due to progressively short-\nened intervals from HF discharge to the next hospitalization.51\nA study of 8948 newly discharged patients\nwith HF that sought to identify predictors of\nhospital readmission found progressive short-\nening of the interval between hospitalization\nepisodes.

Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes. 2018;(1):18-26. doi:10.1093/ehjqcco/qcx015\nWorsening HF is a distinct condition, independent of the location of care. Reconciling how location of care (eg, hospital) could be consistently linked to a biological process is problematic.39 Patients with recent WHF have high rates of death and hospitalization, underscoring the need for novel therapies.37 Hospitalizations due to WHF represent an enormous public health and financial burden, with more physicians, health systems, and payers emphasizing prevention of\u00a0hospitalization.39\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE\u00ae Supplement VOL. 28, NO. 14 S263\nthe very expensive post\u2013acute care space. This includes all charges\nrelated to inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities, long-\nterm acute care, and home health services.\nDue to the expansion of BPCI-A, 90-day spending will become an increasingly important payment benchmark.54 The first study\nof its kind examined 90-day spending from 2016 to 2018 Medicare\nclaims for 935,962 patients discharged following HF hospitalization.\nDespite assumptions that most post-90 day costs would occur in\nthe first 30 days, an even distribution by month seems to occur with two-thirds of costs happening in the second and third months.54\nFigure 10 illustrates differences in 90-day hospital readmission rates for HF vs all causes over 7 years.55\nProcedure Costs for HF May Be Higher Than Anticipated Due to Complications and\u00a0Readmissions Overall, procedures for HF help to save lives, and they may improve\nQOL for many patients. But these benefits come with a high rate of possible complications.56 LV assist device (LVAD) therapy has\nbecome the prevailing surgical treatment (exceeding heart trans-\nplantation) for patients experiencing symptoms of advanced HF\n0 10%\n30.9%\n20% 30% 40%\n34.6%\nHF readmissions\nAll-cause readmissions\n2010 2017\n14.8%\n16%\nHF, heart failure.\nS264 NOVEMBER 2022 www.ajmc.com\nR E P O R T\n\u2022 Most readmissions resulted from CVD; they were longer and\nmore costly after LVAD therapy than before, particularly\nadmissions for \u201cheart failure and shock with complication/\ncomorbidity\u201d ($12,696 vs $7394, respectively; P < .0001)\nand\u00a0for \u201ccardiac arrhythmia and conduction disorders with complication/comorbidity\u201d ($8180 vs $5832; P < .0001).57\nThe HF Epidemic in the COVID-19 Era A pandemic within a pandemic, HF was recognized as a global\npandemic before the COVID-19 crisis due to its high prevalence\nworldwide and the likelihood of a dramatic increase in HF as the aging population grows.58 Patients with HF admitted to the hospital with concomitant COVID-19 have a very poor prognosis.59\nA retrospective analysis concluded that the risk of mortality in\nhospitalized HF patients with COVID-19 was higher than the overall risk of in patient mortality overall (50% vs 23%, respectively).59 It\nwas also found that patients with HF who had COVID-19 were 24% more likely to die in the hospital.59\nOut of necessity, the primary focus of hospitals shifted from\nproviding a wide variety of medical care to treating the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19.60 Lower procedure\nvolumes have raised concerns over long-term adverse CV health outcomes resulting from the decreased rate of diagnosis.61 A 2020\nstudy of 909\u00a0inpatient and outpatient centers was designed to\ndetermine the full magnitude of fewer diagnostic heart disease\nprocedures being performed due to COVID-19 and the impact of\nthis on long-term CVD outcomes. Procedure volumes decreased\nby 42% from March 2019 to March 2020 and by 64% from March 2019 to April 2020.61\nDelays in Care Are Creating a Sense of Urgency Treatment delays and decreased diagnoses raise serious concerns\nfor long-term adverse CV health, and the long-term impact of\ncomorbid CV risk for those with COVID-19 is still being determined.\nA 2020 study that investigated immediate consequences of the\nDanish COVID-19 lockdown for patients with HF found that the\nusual incidence rates of hospitalization with WHF or of a diagnosis\nof new-onset HF were reduced by approximately 30% after lockdown.62 These data have raised concerns that patients with HF are\ncurrently undertreated, which may negatively impact prognosis in the longer term.63\nThe rapid adoption of telehealth over the past few years has\nbecome important in facilitating continuity of care. Patients at\nhome can be monitored through dedicated applications, telephone\ncalls, or devices. Virtual visits and forward triage allow screening\nof patients with signs or symptoms of decompensated HF. Patients\nreceiving care in a hospital may benefit from remote communication\nplatforms. After discharge, patients may undergo remote follow-up or telerehabilitation to prevent early readmission.64\nCritical Need for Transitional Care Programs for\u00a0Patients With HF Transition of care (TOC) in the context of HF management refers\nto individual interventions and programs with multiple activities\ndesigned to improve shifting between therapeutic settings, most\noften from hospital to home. TOC in HF typically involves home\nvisits by nurses to monitor and manage signs and symptoms and\ndeliver patient education after discharge. Predischarge health\neducation and counseling (eg, discharge planning, health education,\ndischarge counseling, and patient-centered discharge instructions) are important components of TOC intervention.65\nTOC in HF requires optimizing communication among stake-\nholders, identifying patients at high risk, assessing health-related\nQOL, and ensuring accurate and adequate knowledge for nurses\nor other clinical leaders. Patient experiences during TOC can be\nstressful, particularly when posthospitalization care is poorly\nexecuted as the result of inadequate coordination of resources\nor follow-up. Fragmentation of patient care is characterized by\nineffective communication among providers and across health\ncare agencies, insufficient patient and caregiver education, poor\ncontinuity of care, and limited access\u2014all of which contribute to reduced quality and unfavorable cost outcomes.66\nPhysiologic, functional, social, cultural, and psychological\npatient characteristics and unmet needs may also affect HF rehospi-\ntalization during TOC. In a study of physical, psychological, social,\nand existential unmet needs of 132 patients enrolled in cardiac\nrehabilitation, key points identified were difficulty in motiva-\ntion to leave home, anxiety when short of breath, general anger\nand frustration, lack of control of life, depression, unwell feeling,\nfears of experiencing MI or stroke, forgetting to take medications,\nlack of understanding about the current situation among family and friends, and obstacles to coping with work around the home.66\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated, acceleration of\ntelehealth strategies can be implemented to ensure continuity\nof care for patients with HF. Telehealth may increase access and\nbe more convenient for patients with HF who may not be able to\nreceive specialty health care services because of geographic loca-\ntion, physical disability, advanced chronic disease, or difficulty in arranging transportation.67\nDrug Classes and Development Significant scientific breakthroughs in managing HFrEF have been realized in recent decades.67 ARNi (sacubitril/valsartan) has become\nwell established as a first-line agent in HFrEF treatment due to its beneficial impact on cardiac remodeling.68 In addition, vasodilators\n(eg, vericiguat) stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase and increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate production.67 This may decrease\nafterload and preload on the myocardium and improve morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF.67 SGLT2 inhibitors\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE\u00ae Supplement VOL. 28, NO. 14 S265\nRETHINKING HEART FAILURE: PATIENT CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT\nrecently were approved by the FDA to treat patients with type 2\ndiabetes; their use demonstrated additional benefits, including a\npositive impact on CV outcomes. SGLT2 inhibitors promote natri-\nuresis, which, combined with diuresis, is associated with decreases\nin plasma volume, blood pressure, vascular stiffness, preload and afterload, and cardiac wall stress.69\nThe trajectory of HFrEF has been favorably altered by multiple\neffective drug therapies. Findings from pivotal clinical trials have led to more individualized therapy for patients with HFrEF.70 Recent\ndevelopments include use of SGLT2 inhibitors, vasodilators, and\ntranscatheter mitral valve repair, all of which have incrementally\nimproved prognosis beyond that achieved with use of foundational\nneurohormonal therapies.\nWhen Patients Are Out of Options For many patients with meaningful comorbidities, limitations in\ncurrent treatment options present a prevailing challenge. Many\npatients have reached their individualized limits; however, risks\nof subsequent hospitalization and death remain significant. In all, HF continues to be a leading cause of hospitalization.22\nUnfortunately, multiple factors can have a major impact on the\nlikelihood of patients with HF receiving target doses of GDMT. Lower\nsystolic blood pressure and other unfavorable prognostic factors\n(eg, more severe NYHA functional class, older age, chronic renal\ninsufficiency, and recent hospitalization for HF) generally occur in most patients not achieving target doses of GDMT.71 In addition to\nWHF, these factors limit current therapeutic options and success.\nConclusions Reaching adequate GDMT targets is the foundation of HF treatment.\nHowever, many patients do not receive optimal levels of therapy,\nor they may need more individualized treatment (ie, adjunctive\ntherapy) if their management is not optimized on GDMT. This\nunderscores the need for additional therapeutic options to be used\nwith the current standard of care. A personalized patient approach\nafter initiating GDMT\u2014rather than the more traditional, hierarchical,\nstandardized, one-size-fits-all approach\u2014may lead to more effective therapy for each patient.42\nNew milestones for the optimal treatment of HF emerge as data\nare reported, clinical trials continue to resemble the general popula-\ntion more closely, and consideration is given to social determinants,\nunderlying causes of HF, individual patient characteristics, and\nthe specific natural disease course. For example, the emergence of\ntelemonitoring and telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic led\nto the adoption of these important modalities to facilitate conti-\nnuity of care. As HF classification systems become more nuanced,\nthe wait-and-see approach to treatment is being reconsidered, with\nthe hope of shifting the treatment paradigm by using timely and\nmore adaptive interventions. This earlier identification of patients\nat high risk of poor HF outcomes may be an important step in improving their prognosis.71\nSelecting treatment based on patient characteristics (eg, sex,\nrace, genetic predisposition) is also important to decrease rates of mortality and hospitalization.18 Timely interceptive treatments\ncan make significant strides in HF when time is of the essence. As\nprevious \u201cadd-on\u201d medications are expanding into frontline use,\nthe need for personalized treatment continues to grow, and new\nadditions to treatment are needed to optimize care and reduce costs.\nImprovements in the outpatient care of HF would help discharged\npatients receive comparable care outside the hospital. Because\nmost patients with WHF have gradual onset of congestive signs\nand symptoms, there is an extremely important and time-sensi-\ntive window of opportunity to halt HF worsening and avoid the\nneed for hospitalization. The coincidental evolution of treat-\nment guidelines and of telemedicine and novel therapeutics on\nthe horizon provides momentum and much needed hope for\npeople with HF. n\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank Yana Volman and Pierre Forsell of COEUS Consulting Group, LLC, for editorial assistance.\nAuthor Affiliations: VisumRX, LLC (DLC), Portland, OR; Yale New Haven Health System and Yale School of Medicine (NRD), New Haven, CT; Gary Owens Associates (GMO), Ocean View, DE; Humana (former)(CAS), Cincinnati, OH.\nFunding Source: Development of this supplement was supported by Cytokinetics, Inc.\nAuthor Disclosures: Dr Clark reports serving as a paid consultant for Cytokinetics and receiving payment for involvement in the preparation of this manuscript.
