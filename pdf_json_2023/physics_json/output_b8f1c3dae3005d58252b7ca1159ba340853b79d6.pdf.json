Here, we introduce a novel single-molecule FRET (smFRET)\nassay to monitor -finger motions during transcription initiation and promoter escape. We find that\nthe -finger is displaced from its position inside the active site cleft before promoter escape, and after\nsynthesis of RNAs with lengths that are highly dependent on the sequence of the promoter used. Realtime smFRET measurements reveal the presence of significant heterogeneity in the timing of finger\ndisplacement and show that different -finger conformations in single open transcription complexes\nare associated with substantially different kinetics in transcription initiation and promoter escape, potentially impacting gene regulation in bacteria."

            "text": "All cellular core RNA polymerases (RNAP) require at least one protein factor to perform promoterspecific transcription initiation1\u20133. In bacterial transcription, the core RNAP associates with a -factor (either the primary- [70] or alternative -factors [such as 24, 28, 32, 38, and 54]) to carry out promoter-specific transcription initiation1. Nearly all RNAP- holoenzymes (except RNAP-54; see\nbelow) contain a structurally similar module called the \u201c-finger\u201d (also referred to as R3-R4 linker\nor R2-R4 linker), which is positioned inside the active centre cleft of RNAP and interacts with unwound template strand DNA4\u20138. The RNAP-54 contains a structurally unrelated module, RII.3,\nwhich occupies a position analogous to that of the -finger module, and has been hypothesised to play a similar functional role9. Remarkably, all three domains of life feature \u03c3-finger-like structural elements which protrude into the RNAP active-centre cleft to interact and stabilise the unwound template-strand DNA in conformations that facilitate the binding of initiating nucleotides4\u201317.\nObservation of high-resolution structures of bacterial transcription initiation complexes showed that\nthe -finger is found along the path of the growing RNA chain (Fig. 1A); it has thus been postulated\nfor a long time that the -finger needs to be displaced from the path of the RNA to allow for\nproductive transcription, with the displacement thought to occur either before or during RNA synthesis in initial transcription4,18\u201320. Consistent with the structural studies, biochemical studies have\nreported altered transcription profiles for RNAP- holoenzymes containing -finger mutations or deletions21,22; further, a recent single-molecule study on the kinetics of initial transcription reported\nsignificant changes in pausing profiles during initial transcription by an RNAP derivative with a - finger deletion23.\nFurther insight on \u03c3-finger interactions and conformations during initiation was provided by a recent study that reported several high-resolution structures of T. thermophilus RNAP and M. tuberculosis\nRNAP transcription initiation complexes and defined -finger interactions with a DNA-RNA hybrid containing different lengths of RNA18. The reported structures indicated stabilisation of very short DNA-RNA hybrids, also reported in Brodolin et al.24, and stepwise displacement of the tip of the -\nfinger from the initial position in the active site cleft as the RNA length increases (>4 nt) and the RNA\nclashes with the -finger. Based on these structures, it has been hypothesized that the -finger acts as\na \u201cprotein spring\u201d by folding back on itself, storing energy which is utilised later during the large-\nscale disruption of RNAP-promoter and RNAP- interactions that occurs in promoter escape. However, the study used nucleic acid scaffolds which did not contain a scrunched DNA25 as would be\nfound in actual initial transcribing complexes. As a result, the exact mechanism and kinetics of -\nfinger displacement during active transcription in the context of a full promoter remain unresolved.\nIn this work, we define the -finger conformation and dynamics at different stages of transcription\ninitiation -- the open complex (RPo), initial transcribing complexes (RPitc), and an elongation complex\n(RDe) -- for three well characterised promoters with different properties: a consensus bacterial\npromoter based on lac promoter (lacCONS), a phage  promoter (pR) and a ribosomal RNA promoter\n(rrnBP1). Using single-molecule FRET (smFRET) approaches, we identify a new \u201cdisplaced\u201d -\nfinger conformation, define the point of -finger displacement for different promoters, identify\ndeterminants of -finger displacement, and measure the kinetics of -finger displacement during\nactive transcription. Our results show surprising diversity between promoters regarding the RNA-\nlength at which \u03c3-finger displacement occurs and reveals the presence of RPo molecules with an order\nof magnitude difference in -finger displacement kinetics during initial transcription."

            "text": "Strategy for detecting \u03c3-finger motions at the single-molecule level. For the detection of \u03c3-finger motions by smFRET during initial transcription, we designed a doubly labelled hexahistidine-tagged RNAP-\u03c370 holoenzyme (DL RNAP-70), with one fluorescent probe attached to the -finger, and another fluorescent probe attached to R2 (70 residue 366) -- a position which remains stable throughout initial transcription25. Since the -finger is a small structural module which interacts with\nthe growing RNA during initial transcription, the position of attachment of the fluorescent probe was\ncarefully chosen to minimise any interference with RNAP function. Accessible volume (AV) modelling of fluorescent probes26 attached to positions through 511 to 521 of 70 on high-resolution\nstructures of initial transcribing complexes having a 3-, 4-, or 5-nt RNA revealed that a fluorescent probe placed at position 511 (located at the base of the finger, away from the tip of the finger) should\nnot interfere with either -finger interactions and RNA interactions (Fig. S1A). The distance between fluorescent probes Cy3B and Alexa647 placed respectively at positions 511 and 366 of 70 was\nestimated to be in the 61-66 \u00c5 range (using PDB structures 4YLN, 7KHB, 7MKD and 7MKE), with corresponding estimated FRET efficiencies (E) in the 0.3-0.5 range (Fig. 1B) \u2013 a range well suited for monitoring distance changes of ~5-20 \u00c5. We thus selected these two positions to generate a DL RNAP-70 construct (see Methods; Fig. S2). The transcriptional activity of DL RNAP-70 was >80% compared to the activity of unmodified RNAP-70, indicating that the attached fluorescent probes did\nnot significantly affect RNAP assembly and RNAP function. In-vitro transcription assays also showed that the initial transcription profiles obtained using the DL RNAP-70and a wild-type RNAP-70 were\nsimilar, indicating that the introduction of a fluorescent probe at the base of the finger did not alter the function of the initial transcribing complex (Fig. S3).\nThe -finger is mobile in the RNAP holoenzyme and in an RNAP-promoter complex. To assess \u03c3-finger conformations in transcription initiation, we incubated DL RNAP-70 with a biotinylated\nconsensus bacterial core promoter fragment (biotin-lacCONS; Table S1, and Fig. 1D) to form\nheparin-resistant RNAP-promoter open complexes (RPo) using established protocols (see Methods),\nfollowed by immobilisation of individual RPo molecules to glass slides functionalised with\nneutravidin (Fig. 1C). Next, we added the initiating dinucleotide ApA to the immobilised RPo\nmolecules to form an initial transcribing complex (RPitc2) and carried out total internal reflection\nfluorescence (TIRF) microscopy with alternating laser excitation (ALEX) experiments as described previously23,27,28. The data were analysed to obtain apparent smFRET efficiencies (E*) from E*-vs-\ntime trajectories of single RPitc2 complexes, and to generate an E* histogram that reports on the\ndistribution of -finger conformational states.\nThe E* histogram for RPitc2 was multimodal with two subpopulations (Fig. 1E, top right): a major\nsubpopulation with mean E*~0.38 (93%), and a minor subpopulation with mean E*~0.14 (7%). Inspection of E*-vs-time trajectories (Fig. 1E, left) revealed a subpopulation of molecules (18%) which showed transitions between different E* values; analysis of E*-vs-time trajectories from these dynamic molecules using Hidden Markov Modelling29,30 identified three subpopulations with mean E* of ~0.22 (17%), ~0.37 (54%), and ~0.59 (29%) and dwell times in the range of ~0.6-1.0 s (Fig. 1E, bottom right).\nDistance estimates corresponding to subpopulations with mean E* values of ~0.37 (corresponding to distances of ~66\u00c5) were in excellent agreement to those predicted from AV calculations on highresolution structures of E. coli RNAP and RNAP-promoter complexes (65.9\u00b19.1\u00c5, 4YLN; 61.4\u00b18.2\u00c5, 7KHB; 64.7\u00b18.9\u00c5, 7MKD; and 62.7\u00b16.1\u00c5, 7MKE). We thus assigned subpopulations\nwith mean E* values of ~0.37 to \u201cin-cleft\u201d -finger conformations positioned to interact with a single-\nstranded template DNA loaded in the RNAP main channel as visualised in the high-resolution structures. On the other hand, subpopulations with mean E* values of ~0.22 represent structural states\nwhere the -finger is positioned away from R2, whereas subpopulations with mean E*of ~0.59\nrepresent structural states where the -finger is positioned closer to R2.\nIn a next set of experiments, we measured apparent smFRET efficiencies (E*) of DL RNAP-70\nmolecules immobilised via a hexahistidine tag on a glass slide functionalized with anti-hexahistidine tag antibody (Fig. S4A). Use of ALEX allows selection of DL RNAP-70 molecules with a single\ndonor-acceptor probe pair and measurement of corresponding E* time trajectories. As for RPitc2, the overall E* histogram for DL RNAP-70 revealed a multimodal distribution, with populations centred\naround mean E* values of ~0.15 (10%), ~0.37 (72%) and ~0.69 (18%) (Fig. S4B). A visual inspection of the E*-vs-time trajectories revealed a class of molecules (28%) which exhibited transitions between different FRET states and were classified as dynamic molecules, within which we identified three subpopulations having mean E* values of ~0.22 (28%), ~0.45 (54%), and ~0.70 (18%), all with dwell times in these conformational states on time scales of ~0.5-0.8 s (Fig. S4C). Overall, our results were\nsimilar for DL RNAP-70 and RPitc2, revealing multiple -finger subpopulations and significant -\nfinger conformational dynamics in these complexes.\n\u03c3-finger displacement during initial transcription: consensus bacterial promoter (lacCONS). We then assessed \u03c3-finger conformations in primer-dependent initial transcription for synthesis of RNAs\nup to 11-nt in length. Initial transcribing complexes (RPitc) were formed by adding subsets of\nnucleotides to RPitc2 complexes prepared using lacCONS constructs (Table S1). Use of subsets\ndirected transcription up to a desired maximum RNA length when CTP is withheld; further, use of ApA dinucleotide as a primer led to synthesis of RNAs with a 5\u2019-OH group.\nAnalysis of E*-vs-time trajectories for experiments for RPitc\u22644 resulted in E* histograms similar to\nthose for RPitc2, i.e., showing two subpopulations with E*~0.41 (93%) and E*~0.14 (7%; Fig. 2A);\nhowever, unlike the results for RPitc2, a much smaller fraction of molecules showed dynamics (9%;\nFig. 2D, green line).\nFor complexes making RNAs of up to 9-nt in length (complexes ranging from RPitc\u22645 to RPitc\u22649), the\nE* histograms showed almost exclusively the presence of the subpopulation corresponding to a \u201cincleft\u201d \u03c3-finger conformation (96%-100%; Fig. 2A). Significantly, the E* time trajectories showed few dynamics (<10% of dynamic molecules; Fig. 2D), indicating formation of a stabilised conformation\nfor the -finger module during this stage of initial transcription. The lack of significant structural\nheterogeneity and dynamics for our construct (which probes the motions of the base of the -finger;\nFig. S1B) indicates that it forms a stable structural state for the base of the finger when a 5-mer RNA is synthesised, and stays in similarly stable states for RNA extensions up to a 9-mer.\nIn contrast, further RNA extension beyond 9-nt led to increased abundance for low-FRET species\n(E*~0.15 (19%) for RPitc\u226410 and E*~0.14 (18%) for RPitc\u226411; Fig. 2A), indicating that, for a significant\nfraction of molecules, synthesis of a 10-mer RNA results in -finger displacement from an \u201cin-cleft\u201d\nconformation to a conformation positioned away from R2, which we assign to a \u201cdisplaced\u201d -\nfinger conformation.\nNotably, analysis of E* time trajectories for RPitc\u226411 revealed a much higher fraction of dynamic\nmolecules (21%, Fig. 2D), with transitions between three subpopulations centred around E*~0.23,\n0.42 and 0.64, occurring on timescales of ~1.0-1.4 s (Fig. S5). The increased mobility of the -finger\nfor a large fraction of molecules during late stages of initial transcription for lacCONS (11-nt RNA) as compared to earlier stages (4-10 nt RNA) may originate either from a loss of contact with the scrunched DNA-RNA hybrid (resulting in motions similar to the ones observed in the early stages of\ninitial transcription, i.e., RPitc2), or due to motions of the entire -finger DNA-RNA hybrid associated\nwith a \u201cunscrunching-scrunching\u201d of the transcription bubble, as reported in previous single-molecule studies31. If the resulting dynamics were indeed similar to that observed in the early stages of initial transcription, then this result would suggest that, at the stage of finger displacement, the \u03c3-finger breaks its contact with the DNA-RNA hybrid and becomes mobile, exploring several conformational states. However, a dwell-time analysis for subpopulations with a mean E*~0.23 revealed a peaked\ndistribution for dwell times corresponding to different conformational states populated in RPitc\u226411; this\ndistribution shape is in sharp contrast to exponential distributions observed previously for RPitc2 (Fig.\nS6). A peaked dwell-time distribution suggests a conformational change involving more than one\nstep, indicating that the -finger motions in these late stages of initial transcription correlate with the previously observed dynamics of the transcription-bubble31.\nFurther extension to a 14-mer RNA (RDe\u226414) resulted in a E* histogram with a subpopulation around\n~0.14 (31%) and a reduction in the fraction of dynamic trajectories (to 13%; Fig. 2D). This reduction indicates progression out of the late stages on initial transcription and promoter escape in order to form an early elongation complex that still retains \u03c370 (Ref.32).\nTo determine the status of the transcription bubble for this promoter during initial transcription, we performed similar experiments using a previously reported construct with donor and acceptor probes at positions -15 of the non-template and +20 of the template DNA23 (lacCONS -15/+20; Table S1) and an unlabelled hexahistidine tagged RNAP-70 holoenzyme. Previous reports for initial\ntranscribing complexes on this construct established that subpopulations with a mean E*~0.45\nrepresented a scrunched transcription bubble23. Our experiments monitoring E*-vs-time trajectories for complexes with 11-mer RNA revealed a large peak around E*~0.45, indicative of a scrunched bubble which disappeared upon extension to a 14-mer RNA (Fig. S7). The point of escape for the lacCONS promoter therefore lies between the synthesis of an 11-mer and a 14-mer RNA. We note a significant fraction of the complexes remain at E*~0.45, suggesting that these species include subpopulations of complexes which are either transcriptionally inactive, or engaged in abortive initiation and unable to escape to elongation. Taken together, our data clearly show that, for the\nlacCONS promoter, the base of the -finger is displaced during initial transcription, and before\npromoter escape.\nPoint of -finger displacement depends on the functional group at the 5\u2019-end of RNA. We then\nassessed -finger conformations in primer-independent transcription, which results in synthesis of\nRNAs with a 5\u2019-triphosphate (5\u2019-ppp), a chemical moiety with greater steric bulk and additional negative charges compared to a 5\u2019-OH, and thus with potential for different interactions with the\nnegatively charged -finger. We performed experiments similar to those in the previous section but in\nthe absence of a dinucleotide primer, and measured -finger conformational dynamics for complexes\ncapable of synthesizing RNAs from up to 2-nt in length (ppp-RPitc\u22642), to up to 11-nt in length (ppp-\nRPitc\u226411). Analysis of E* distributions for ppp-RPitc\u22642 and ppp-RPitc\u22644 showed results similar to those\nobtained for prime-dependent transcription initiation (Fig. 2B). However, further extension to a 5-mer RNA resulted in a E* histogram with an increased fraction of the subpopulation with E*~0.14 (14%; cf. with 3% for a 5-mer with a 5\u2019-OH end). Similar results were obtained for complexes capable of synthesizing from up to a 6-mer to up to an 11-mer RNA, with occupancies in the E*~0.14 state being within the ~18-25% range (Fig. 2B; Fig. 2C, orange line); additionally, a significant fraction (~14- 23%) of E* time trajectories for all but one of these complexes show dynamic behaviour (Fig. 2D,\norange line), analogous to results obtained for RPitc\u226411 in the primer-dependent transcription initiation.\nOur results indicate that, in primer-independent initiation, the unfavourable interactions between the\nbulky, negatively charged triphosphate group and the -finger (which has a negative net charge)\nresults in displacement at a much shorter RNA length compared to primer-dependent initiation.\nKinetics of \u03c3-finger displacement during initial transcription. To observe the kinetics of -finger\ndisplacement during initial transcription, we performed real-time RNA synthesis up to the point of\npromoter escape during the recording of our single-molecule movies. Specifically, we pre-formed RPo with DL RNAP-70 and lacCONS promoter DNA fragments at 37\u00b0C, immobilised RPo molecules (as\nin Fig. 1C) and formed RP itc\u22642 on glass, started recording of the movie, and added a subset of NTPs\ndirecting transcription up to the formation of a stable elongation complex (for lacCONS, this\ncorresponds to synthesis of a 14-nt RNA; Fig. 3A). To compare the kinetics of -finger displacement\nduring primer-dependent transcription initiation with those of primer-independent transcription initiation, RPitc2 was formed with either an ApA dinucleotide primer, or a pppApA dinucleotide primer, respectively. Movies were analysed to extract E* time trajectories and were fit using HMM to extract the time between nucleotide addition and \u03c3-finger displacement (see Methods), a time which\nwe will referred to as displacement time td.\nA visual examination of the E* time trajectories (Fig. S8) obtained in presence of ApA revealed several classes of molecules. Class-I molecules showed a step decrease in E* to a stable state around E*~0.15, which corresponds to the \u201cdisplaced\u201d \u03c3-finger; this transition occurred on a short timescale\n(Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, Class-II molecules transitioned to a stable \u201cdisplaced\u201d -finger\nconformation on a long timescale (Fig. 3B, right). Class-I and Class-II molecules made up 25% of all molecules. Class-III molecules (44% of all molecules; Fig. S8B) showed no transition to an E*-state characteristic of the \u201cdisplaced\u201d \u03c3-finger but exhibited transitions between other E* states. An\ninspection of E*-vs-time trajectories for molecules in RDe\u226414 revealed very few dynamic molecules\n(13%; Fig. 2D), indicating that, for some of the dynamic molecules in Class-III, the -finger is\ndisplaced at later time points and is missed due to premature termination of the time-trajectory. Finally, Class-IV molecules (31% of all molecules, Fig. S8C) showed no transitions and likely consist of either inactive complexes or complexes that remain at early stages of initial transcription.\nTo estimate the displacement time td, we combined molecules from Class-I and Class-II, binned them\ninto a dwell-time histogram, and fitted the distribution with a biexponential decay (Fig. 3C). Results\nshowed two types of displacement events, a fast one, td,short ~14 s (accounting for ~90% of events) and\na slow one, td,long ~190 s (accounting for ~10% of events).\nSimilar experiments with pppApA revealed E*-vs-time trajectories that contained all four Classes of molecules seen in the absence of the 5\u2019-triphospate group on the RNA, with abundances of 41% for Class-I and Class-II, 27% for Class-III and 32% for Class-IV (Fig. S9). Analysis of displacement\ntimes from Class-I and Class-II also showed some heterogeneity in displacement times, with td,short\n~1.4 s (~97% of the events) and td,long ~70 s (~3% of the events; Fig. S10A). Strikingly, the\ndisplacement events for Classes I and II for transcription with an RNA having a 5\u2019-triphosphate occurred at much faster timescales compared to transcription with an RNA having a 5\u2019-OH. Together\nwith the observation that the -finger is displaced at much shorter RNA lengths for primer-\nindependent initiation (5-nt RNA) compared to a primer-dependent initiation (10-nt RNA), this result\npoints to a much lower energy barrier for -finger displacement when a triphosphate is present at the\n5\u2019-end of the growing RNA, likely resulting from unfavourable interactions between the largely\nnegatively charged -finger module (due to the presence of a stretch of four acidic residues in the -\nfinger: D513, D514, E515, and D516) and the bulky, negatively charged triphosphate group.\nWe then explored the intriguing observation of molecules with very different displacement kinetics.\nSince the real-time reaction starts with the addition of NTPs to immobilised RP itc\u22642 complexes, we\nhypothesized that the different kinetics may be associated with conformationally different RP itc\u22642\nmolecules, and especially, with different conformations of the \u03c3-finger, which plays key roles in\ntranscription initiation and promoter escape. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the -finger\nconformations before NTP addition for two types of molecules: those showing fast displacement\nkinetics (\u201cfast-displacers\u201d, with td < 31 s for primer-dependent initiation and td < 4 s for primer-\nindependent initiation) and those showing slow displacement kinetics (\u201cslow-displacers\u201d, with td > 31\ns for primer-dependent initiation and td > 4 s for primer-independent initiation). This analysis revealed\ndistinctly different E* histograms for the two types of species on lacCONS: molecules with a wide E* distribution centred around ~0.42 for fast displacers, and molecules with a wide E* distribution\ncentred around ~0.47 for slow displacers (Fig. 3D-E). Similar results on lacCONS were obtained for both primer-dependent (5\u2019-OH RNA) and primer-independent transcription initiation (5\u2019-ppp RNA) (Fig. 3E, S10B).\n\u03c3-finger displacement during initial transcription: a phage  promoter (pR). We then examined\nthe profile of \u03c3-finger displacement in different promoters, since it is well known that initial transcription and promoter escape are heavily dependent on the promoter and initially-transcribed sequences32,33. We performed analogous experiments with two widely studied and naturally occurring bacterial promoters, the \u03bb pR and the rrnBP1 (Fig. 4A-B), which exhibit significantly different behaviour during initial transcription. The pR promoter is characterised by formation of a very stable RPo34 (lifetime >104 s), a 13-bp unwound bubble and a transcription start site seven bases downstream\nof the -10 element. The pR promoter directs accumulation of short RNA products (abortive initiation) during initial transcription and escape from the promoter at an RNA length of 11-nt34,35. Structural\nstudies of RPo formed at the pR have shown that the -finger module protrudes into the active site\ncleft to contact the single-stranded template DNA and is positioned to clash with a growing RNA chain of 4-6 nt in length19 (Fig. S11).\nExperiments performed on an RPo formed on a pR promoter fragment showed a major subpopulation\nwith mean E*~0.43 (86%) representative of an in-cleft -finger, and a minor conformation with mean\nE*~0.14 (14%) representative of a displaced -finger (Fig. 4C); these results were similar to those\nobtained on an RPo formed on the lacCONS promoter (Fig. S12). Measurements performed with\ninitial transcribing complexes containing varying lengths of RNA first revealed that the abundance of\nthe subpopulation corresponding to the displaced -finger was similar for RPitc\u22642 (18%). Surprisingly,\nhowever, the displaced \u03c3-finger conformation significantly increased for RPitc\u22643 (40%) and RPitc\u22644\n(39%) (Fig. 4C), indicating that displacement occurs after synthesis of a very short RNA (just a 3-\nmer), and well before the RNA reaches sufficient length to clash with the -finger for the pR\npromoter (~5 nt). Further, since it is known that escape for pR promoter occurs during RNA extension\nfrom a 10- to 11-mer34, our results show that, for the pR promoter, the -finger is displaced from the\nRNAP active site cleft well before promoter escape.\nNext, we performed real-time experiments with the pR promoter (Fig. 5A). Our results revealed the presence of two sub-populations of molecules exhibiting short (~17 s, ~88% of the events) and long (~185 s, ~12% of the events) displacement times (Fig. 5B), essentially identical to the results obtained previously for the lacCONS promoter. However, unlike in lacCONS, an analysis of the E* values for the fast and slow displacers before NTP addition revealed similar E* values (~0.46 and ~0.48, respectively; Fig. 5C).\n\u03c3-finger displacement during initial transcription: a ribosomal RNA promoter (rrnBP1). We then analysed \u03c3-finger displacement on a ribosomal RNA promoter (rrnBP1); such ribosomal RNA promoters are responsible for a large fraction of transcription in bacteria, especially during fast growth; as such, these promoters are characterized by very high turnover rates. In contrast to pR, the\nrrnBP1 promoter is characterised by a very unstable RPo (lifetime ~ 1 s; Ref. 36) containing a 15-bp\nunwound bubble and a transcription start-site located nine bases downstream of the -10 element; this unusually long spacing (which is 2-nt longer than average) is associated with accumulation of some DNA scrunching in the open complex prior to RNA synthesis initiation36. Further, the rrnBP1 promoter is not associated with the production of significant amounts of abortive RNAs36, and it has been postulated that promoter escape on rrnBP1 may occur as early as RNA lengths of 3 nt34, although there is no direct physical evidence supporting this hypothesis.\nUsing the same approaches as for lacCONS and pR promoters, we observed that an RPo formed on a\nrrnBP1 promoter fragment adopts almost exclusively (94% of molecules) the in-cleft -finger\nconformation, with the rest of the molecules adopting a displaced \u03c3-finger conformation; these results are essentially identical to the profile observed for the lacCONS promoter. In sharp contrast, measurements performed in complexes able to synthesize increasing lengths of RNA showed a large\nincrease in the fraction of displaced conformation as early as RPitc\u22642 (29%; Fig. 4D). Strikingly, when\ndinucleotides used to form RPitc\u22642 complexes were washed out from solution-- which should lead to\ndissociation of the RNA dinucleotide and re-formation of the initial RPo -- the E* histogram still\nshowed a significant fraction of complexes with a displaced -finger (24%; Fig. 4E). These results\nstrongly suggest that, on rrnBP1, the formation of the first phosphodiester bond during the synthesis of the dinucleotide provided sufficient interactions to reposition the \u03c3 finger in a stably displaced conformation.\nTo define the point of escape for rrnBP1 and compare it to the point of \u03c3-finger displacement, we designed a construct with donor and acceptor probes placed at an upstream (-15 of non-template strand) and a downstream (+20 of template strand) position of the rrnBP1 promoter (-15/+20 rrnBP1;\nTable S1). smFRET measurements on transcription complexes formed with the -15/+20 rrnBP1 (RPo,\nRPitc\u22642, RPitc\u22643, RPitc\u22644, and RPitc\u22645) showed subpopulations with low FRET (E*~0.15-0.20), which we\nassigned to conformations with no unwound promoter bubble, and subpopulations with intermediate FRET (E*~0.35-0.40), which we assigned to conformations with unwound promoter bubbles in initial transcription (Fig. S13). Our results showed large subpopulations (88-95%) with intermediate FRET\nfor RPitc\u22642, RPitc\u22643, and RPitc\u22644, indicating presence of unwound promoter bubbles characteristic of\nscrunched bubbles in initial transcription (Fig. S13A). Further extension of RNA to 5-mer (RPitc\u22645)\nresulted in large decrease in the intermediate-FRET subpopulation, strongly suggesting that this length associates with loss of the scrunched unwound bubble, an event characteristic of promoter escape (Fig. S13A). We thus conclude that promoter escape in rrnBP1 occurs when a 5-nt RNA is\nsynthesized. Taken together, our results for the rrnBP1 promoter indicate that the -finger is displaced\nwell before promoter escape (at 5-nt RNA) and as early as the synthesis of a 2-nt RNA.\nReal-time experiments with rrnBP1 promoter revealed two subpopulations with displacement events of ~3.8 and ~36 s, and E* efficiencies of ~0.49 before NTP addition (Fig. 5D-E). The subpopulation exhibiting very fast displacement events was similar in abundance to subpopulations exhibiting fast displacement kinetics for the other two promoters (84% for rrnBP1 vs 88% for lacCONS and pR) but exhibited much faster displacement times (~3.8 s for rrnBP1 vs. ~14 s for lacCONS and ~17 s for pR). This striking difference is a likely consequence of the distinctly different nature of RPo formed at\nthe rrnBP1 promoter and its very early point of displacement (after synthesis of 2-nt RNA). The slowdisplacing subpopulation on rrnBP1 is also 5-fold faster compared to the slow-displacing population in lacCONS (~188 s) and pR (~185 s) (Figs. 3C and 5B).\nOverall, the results of the real time experiments reveal subpopulations of molecules showing very slow displacement events of ~180-200 s for lacCONS and pR. Given the distinctly different point of\ndisplacement of the -finger for lacCONS (very late displacement) and for pR (early displacement)\nwe suggest that the majority of the displacement time is spent before initial transcription begins. A likely explanation is that the slow displacers represent RPo molecules residing in a transcriptionally inactive conformation for a significant amount of time. Similar functional heterogeneity among RPo molecules has been recently reported in studies employing the pR promoter37 and the lacCONS promoter38. A subpopulation with such markedly slow displacement (~180 s) is absent on rrnBP1. However, since we observe a very early displacement (after 2 nt RNA synthesis) for rrnBP1, it is unlikely the subpopulation with ~36 s displacement time spent most of this time in initial transcription. Therefore, we suggest that, similar to the other two promoters, a long-lived transcriptionally inactive RPo state also occurs on rrnBP1."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The -finger is displaced from an in-cleft conformational state during initial transcription. In\nthis study, we developed a new FRET-based approach for detecting -finger conformations in single\ntranscription complexes and captured the -finger conformational profile throughout initial\ntranscription (from RPo complexes to early elongation complexes) for three promoters with different\ntranscription initiation profiles.\nNotably, our FRET construct reports on the position of the base of the -finger (since we label residue\n511) and cannot observe any motions that involve only the tip of the finger (residues 513-519), such as the motions observed in a structural study examining analogues of initial transcribing complexes with increasing RNA lengths18 (Fig. S1B). Therefore, the large FRET changes observed in our assays\nwith different promoter fragments report on full displacement of the -finger from \u201cin-cleft\u201d\nconformations in early stages of transcription initiation. The observed FRET decrease upon RNA synthesis suggests that the \u03c3-finger moves out of the RNAP main cleft and away from the leading edge of RNAP (where the other FRET probe is attached), likely moving towards the dsDNA upstream of the transcription bubble. Such displaced conformations have been proposed but were never directly observed in structural studies, likely due to high mobility of this displaced structural module.\nImportantly, for all promoters studied, -finger displacement occurred at RNA lengths shorter than\nthose required for promoter escape. Specifically, -finger displacements were observed after synthesis\nof 10-nt, 3-nt, and 2-nt RNA for the lacCONS, pR and rrnBP1 promoters, respectively, whereas promoter escape occurred after synthesis of 12-nt, 11-nt and 5-nt RNA, respectively (based on results in Fig. S7, Henderson et al.34 and Fig. S13).\n-finger displacement can occur via different mechanisms depending on the promoter. Structural work on the \u03c370 finger using synthetic transcription initiation scaffolds containing different\nlengths of RNA revealed that, as the RNA length increases, the 5\u2019-end of the RNA clashes with the -\nfinger; and for sufficiently long RNAs, the tip of the -finger gets displaced, folding back on itself in\na manner analogous to compression of a spring, with each stepwise increase in RNA-length leading to greater displacement of the tip of the finger18. Very recent structural work on initial transcribing complexes formed by \u03c354 RNAP and a synthetic promoter scaffold containing increasing lengths of pre-synthesised RNA showed that the \u201cRII-finger\u201d, a \u03c354 element functionally equivalent to the \u03c370 finger, also folds back on itself when the RNA reaches ~7 nt, at which point a steric clash between the RNA and the RII-finger occurs in a manner analogous to the \u03c370-finger 39. These studies support the\nhypothesis that full displacement of the -finger away from the path of the extending RNA follows an\nobligatory steric clash with the extending RNA. As a corollary of this \u201cobligatory steric clash\u201d hypothesis, the exact point of displacement for different promoters should be dictated by the extent to\nwhich the -finger protrudes inside the unwound transcription bubble and the strength of the contacts\nit makes with the template ssDNA and the RNA.\nConsistent with the obligatory steric clash hypothesis, \u03c3-finger displacement from the cleft occurred late on the lacCONS promoter -- after synthesis of 10-nt RNA. Intriguingly, however, and contrary to the obligatory steric clash hypothesis, our measurements with the pR and rrnBP1 promoters showed that displacement occurred at RNA lengths of only 3-nt and 2-nt, respectively, lengths much shorter\nthan the 5-nt RNA length expected for a steric clash of the 5\u2019-end of the RNA with the -finger for\nthese promoters (Figs. 4C-D). We thus suggest that, even before the ensuing steric clash between the\n-finger and the nascent RNA in the active-site cleft of RNAP, a steric clash between the -finger and\nthe scrunched template DNA, and/or a weakening of interactions between the -finger and the\ntemplate ssDNA due to scrunching, triggers disruption of the \u03c3-finger contacts, enabling full\ndisplacement of the -finger. Notably, the \u03c3-finger interacts with template bases -3/-4 with promoters\nof a canonical discriminator of 6-nt (such as lacCONS and \u03bbPr [Ref. 7]), and template bases -4/-5 with promoters with a longer discriminator (such as rrnBP1 [Ref. 40]); the template bases involved in these contacts are different in all 3 promoters, raising the possibility of a DNA-sequence determinant for finger displacement. Further, the recent work on the \u03c354 RII-finger displacement also showed altered interactions between the RII-finger and the template DNA due to DNA scrunching39.\nInfluence of the different mechanisms of \u03c3-finger displacement on the \u201cinitiation pause\u201d. Previous single-molecule and crosslinking studies of initial transcription with the lacCONS promoter identified an \u201cinitiation pause\u201d during extension of a 6-nt to a 7-nt RNA; the same study showed that deletion of the \u03c3-finger resulted in significantly reduced pause lifetimes as RNA extends from 6-nt to 7-nt, establishing the \u03c3-finger as a crucial determinant of pausing during initial transcription, in addition to the initial transcribed sequence23,31,33. We suggest that, for lacCONS, the -finger clashes\nwith the RNA after synthesis of a 5-nt RNA, while making additional stabilising contacts with the 5\u2019- end of the RNA, as observed in Li et al.18, likely raising the energy barrier of translocation during initial transcription and enhancing pausing, as observed23,41. Further extension of RNA beyond the 7-\nmer results in additional scrunched DNA and additional folding of the tip of the -finger, as observed in Li et al.18 \u2013 both structural elements capable of acting like a compressed spring and storing energy which can be released to disrupt RNAP promoter contacts during late stages of initial transcription,\neventually enabling escape from the promoter. Our observation of the -finger getting displaced at\n10-nt RNA length \u2013 well before the point of promoter escape for lacCONS (Fig. S7) suggests the\nstored energy in the folded -finger may indeed be used up in this step, disrupting the contacts formed\nbetween the -finger and the RNA, facilitating its displacement from the active centre cleft, and\nclearing the path for promoter escape.\nHowever, for the pR and rrnBP1 promoters, an early displacement of the -finger well before its\nexpected clash with the nascent RNA chain indicates that the additional translocation energy barrier\nposed by the -finger (as e.g., in the case of lacCONS) would be absent. Hence, one expects\nsignificantly reduced lifetimes of the \u201cinitiation pause\u201d for these promoters, leading to much shorter\ntimes spent in initial transcription. We thus suggest that the -finger and its displacement can act as a\nmajor determinant of rates of transcription initiation and promoter escape.\nInteractions with the 5\u2019-end of nascent RNA modulate -finger displacement. In contrast to our\nresults obtained for primer-dependent transcription initiation, primer-independent transcription\ninitiation yielded strikingly different results for the lacCONS promoter, with -finger displacements\nobserved at a much earlier stage (after synthesis of 5-nt RNA instead of 10-nt RNA). Primerdependent transcription involves synthesis of an RNA with a hydroxyl group at the 5\u2019-end (5\u2019-OH), while primer-independent transcription involves an RNA with a triphosphate at the 5\u2019-end (5\u2019-ppp).\nSince the bacterial -finger is negatively charged under physiological conditions (due to the presence\nof a stretch of four acidic residues in the -finger: D513, D514, E515, and D516), our results indicates\nthat the bulky, negatively-charged triphosphate group at the 5\u2019-end of the growing RNA repels the\nnegatively charged -finger, triggering -finger displacement at RNA lengths significantly shorter\nthan that observed for reactions involving 5\u2019-OH ends of the RNA. As argued in the previous section, a displacement after 5-nt RNA synthesis would result in a lower energy barrier of translocation for the initiation pause (observed at +6) for lacCONS and consequently one expects a much shorter pause lifetime in case of primer-independent initial transcription for this promoter. In agreement with this\nresult, Dulin et al.31, previously reported a ~2.5-fold decrease in pause duration for primerindependent initiation as compared to primer-dependent initiation at the same promoter30.\nNotably, most transcription under exponential growth involve primer-independent initiation, while primer-dependent initiation becomes prevalent during stationary phase42,43. Our results indicate that -\nfinger interactions with the 5\u2019-end of the RNA may be used by bacteria to tune gene expression in a\ngrowth-dependent fashion, since an early -finger displacement in primer-independent initiation\ncould facilitate promoter escape and result in higher transcription output during exponential growth,\nwhile larger timescales for -finger displacement in primer-dependent initiation, as shown by real-\ntime measurements, could lead to reduced transcription during stationary phase.\n-finger displacement on a single promoter occurs at substantially different timescales. Our real-\ntime measurements of displacement time for primer-dependent initiation on lacCONS revealed that only ~25% of the molecules show displacement. Since we miss the displacement event in ~20% of the molecules (due to probe photobleaching prematurely terminating our FRET time-trajectories), our results imply that ~55% of the molecules are either transcriptionally inactive or remain in early stages\nof initial transcription where the -finger is still not displaced. These results are consistent with\nprevious reports from biochemical and single-molecule experiments showing the presence of a class of transcription complexes that remain in abortive initiation and do not proceed to elongation31,34.\nThe molecules showing displacement belonged to two sub-classes, exhibiting either a short (5 \u2013 20 s) or much longer (>150 s) displacement time for the lacCONS promoter. These times are strikingly similar to the promoter-escape times [~13 s (96%) and ~200 s (4%)] observed in a single-molecule study on the same promoter38. Further analysis revealed -finger conformations with distinct mean E*\nvalues in the initial state (i.e., in the RPo state) for the kinetically different molecules, indicating that\nthe heterogeneity in displacement times is correlated with conformationally different RPo molecules.\nHow do molecules with different -finger positions result in different displacement kinetics? We\nenvision that the basis for this resides on altered pre-organisation of the template strand by the\ndifferently positioned -fingers, and/or on differences in the ensuing steric clash between the nascent\nRNA and the differently positioned -finger modules.\nIn contrast, our analysis on the pR promoter (which showed displacement early in initial transcription, after synthesis of a 3-mer RNA) showed both short and long displacement times, as in the lacCONS\ncase \u2013 however, both short and long displacement times show -finger conformations with similar E*\nvalues before NTP addition. What gives rises to this kinetic heterogeneity? Given the short RNA\nlength needed for -finger displacement on the pR promoter, a steric clash with the RNA during\ninitial transcription can be ruled out; further, our assay could not pick up significantly different -\nfinger conformations in the kinetically distinct subpopulations and, as such, our results on \u03bbPR do not support the presence of an altered pre-organisation of the template strand driven by different -finger\nconformations.\nInstead, we speculate that the kinetic heterogeneity in this case arises from conformational\nheterogeneity in RPo molecules which involve different template strand organizations as observed in a recent study on RPo formed on a pR promoter19; in that study, the authors report one RPo conformation with template strand conformations incompatible with binding initiating nucleotides, and hence incompatible with transcription initiation19. In this scenario, the long -finger displacement\ntimes for a subpopulation of transcription complexes on the pR promoter could originate from the\nrate-limiting step of the conversion of the inactive conformation of RPo to the active conformation.\nOur analysis on the rrnBP1 promoter also showed kinetically heterogeneous \u03c3-finger displacement, with both fast-displacers and slow-displacers showing displacement much faster than the other two promoters. This heterogeneity is intriguing, since the displacement times for rrnBP1 under our conditions essentially report on the binding of the dinucleotide primer (and not on rate of RNA\nsynthesis); in other words, primer binding alone can trigger -finger displacement. The observed\nheterogeneity again indicates the presence of distinct RPo conformational states (as for the pR\npromoter), with different template strand organisation, which in turn result in distinct binding efficiency of the dinucleotide primer to the RNAP active site. Similar to the pR promoter, we do not\nobserve significant differences in E* values for the -finger conformation for the kinetically different\nmolecules.\nTaken together, our study identifies displacement of the -finger as a key step that influence the\nkinetics of initial transcription and reveals different mechanisms which influence this process; these mechanisms can be leveraged by the bacteria to regulate transcription at many levels (different genes, different sets of genes, or different physiological states). Such conformational control may also offer a new target for generating antibiotics, e.g., by identifying small molecules that severely delay or block promoter escape on pivotal genes, such as the rRNA genes.\nWe note that structural modules similar the bacterial -finger (in that they protrude into the cleft of\ntranscription initiation complexes, interact with template ssDNA and occupy the path of the nascent RNA chain) are present in other kingdoms of life [e.g., TFB zinc ribbon and CSB of the archaeal RNAP10; Rrn7 zinc ribbon and B reader R of RNAP-I14,15; TFIIB zinc ribbon and B reader of RNAPII11,13,44,45; and Brf1 zinc ribbon of RNAP-III16,17. We suggest these modules likely behave in a manner\nanalogous to the bacterial -finger and influence the kinetics of transcription and gene regulation in\nboth archaea and higher eukaryotes in an analogous manner."

After categorization, HMM analysis was re-run on groups exhibiting displacement (4-state model to incorporate the displaced state) or dynamics (3-state model) separately. Displacement time histograms for \u03c3-finger displacement (Figs. 3C, 5B, 5E, S10A) were calculated by subtracting the time of nucleotide addition from the time of \u03c3-finger displacement, taken from HMM analysis. The time for \u03c3-finger displacement were then plotted as histograms and fit to double exponential decays in Origin and the two time-constants extracted. For analysis in Figs. 3E, 5C, 5F and S10B, E* values before nucleotide addition were extracted from traces exhibiting \u03c3-finger displacement (Class-I and Class-II). These traces were classified into either exhibiting \u2018short\u2019 or \u2018long\u2019 finger displacement using a boundary\ncalculated from the time at which the two components of the double exponential decay intersect. The E*-values for these two groups were then extracted and a histogram produced from binned values. These were then fit to single gaussian distributions in Origin."

    "title": "Bacterial sigma factors (\uf073) contain a highly conserved structural module, the \u2018\u2018\uf073-finger\u2019\u2019, which forms a loop that protrudes towards the RNA polymerase (RNAP) active-centre in the open complex and has been implicated in pre-organisation of template DNA, abortive initiation of short RNAs, initiation pausing, and promoter escape. Here, we introduce a novel single-molecule FRET (smFRET) assay to monitor \uf073-finger motions during transcription initiation and promoter escape. We find that the \uf073-finger is displaced from its position inside the active site cleft before promoter escape, and after synthesis of RNAs with lengths that are highly dependent on the sequence of the promoter used. Real- time smFRET measurements reveal the presence of significant heterogeneity in the timing of finger displacement and show that different \uf073-finger conformations in single open transcription complexes are associated with substantially different kinetics in transcription initiation and promoter escape,",
