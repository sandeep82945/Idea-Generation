 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar study in other provinces or regions of Indonesia to compare the acceptance and adoption of electronic payment systems across different areas. This could provide insights into how local context influences technology acceptance.

2. Examine how demographic factors like age, education level, and income influence acceptance and use of electronic payment systems. This could identify segments of the population that may need more support or education when new systems are introduced.

3. Research the impact of electronic payment systems on tax compliance and government revenue generation over time. Does implementing these systems lead to sustained increases in tax payments and revenue?

4. Evaluate the user experience and interface design of electronic payment apps and platforms for paying taxes and fees. How could the user experience be improved to increase adoption and acceptance? 

5. Study the implementation process for new electronic payment systems in depth through interviews and focus groups. What are the critical success factors and challenges faced when rolling out a new digital payment platform? How can implementation be improved?
