    "abstractText": "With the promotion of intellectual property strategy, the whole chain development of intellectual property environment faced by manufacturing firms has been improved, but the effect of the whole chain development of intellectual property on firm performance still needs to be studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the whole chain development of intellectual property on different types of manufacturing firm performance. A panel regression model is constructed based on listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2020, and this is tested empirically. The results of the study show that the whole chain development of intellectual property has a promotion effect on manufacturing firm performance, among which the promotion effect of intellectual property services is the strongest, followed by intellectual property utilization and intellectual property creation, and the promotion effect of intellectual property management has a significant lag, while the relationship between intellectual property protection and manufacturing firms performance is significantly negative. The promotion effect of the whole chain development of intellectual property on different types of manufacturing firm performance is heterogeneous, and the promotion effect of the whole chain development of intellectual property on the performance of small-scale, non-state-owned, medium-high-technology manufacturing firms is stronger than that of large-scale, state-owned, low-technology manufacturing firms. This study not only extends the research direction of intellectual property, but also adds to the literature on firm performance. In addition, the findings of this paper help government authorities to further optimize the strategic layout of the whole chain development of intellectual property, promote manufacturing firms to solve internal management problems, and achieve a positive interaction between the top-level design of the intellectual property and the bottom-level logic of manufacturing firms.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the whole chain development of intellectual property on different types of manufacturing firm performance. A panel regression model is constructed based on listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2020, and this is tested empirically. The results of the study show that the whole chain development of intellectual property has a promotion effect on manufacturing firm performance, among which the promotion effect of intellectual property services is the strongest, followed by intellectual property utilization and intellectual property creation, and the promotion effect of intellectual property management has a significant lag, while the relationship between intellectual property protection and manufacturing firms performance is significantly negative. The promotion effect of the whole chain development of intellectual property on different types of manufacturing firm performance is heterogeneous, and the promotion effect of the whole chain development of intellectual property on the performance of small-scale, non-state-owned, medium-high-technology manufacturing firms is stronger than that of large-scale, state-owned, low-technology manufacturing firms. This study not only extends the research direction of intellectual property, but also adds to the literature on firm performance.

However, China\u2019s manufacturing industry is still big but not strong. Weak independent innovation capability, high external dependence on core technologies, the high energy consumption of products, and high carbon emissions are still the biggest constraints to the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry (Yu and Hu, 2018). So policymakers focus on intellectual property rights (IPR) and regard the development of IPR as a policy tool to stimulate the vitality of manufacturing firms and promote the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China formulated the \u201cManufacturing Intellectual Property Action Plan (2018\u20132020),\u201d emphasizing that firms should be\u00a0the main body to make up for the unbalanced and insufficient development of IPR in the manufacturing industry. Then in 2021, the State Council of China issued the \u201cOutline for Building a Powerful Intellectual Property Country (2021\u20132035),\u201d which proposed to realize the whole chain development of intellectual property (WCDIP), including intellectual property creation (IPC), intellectual property utilization (IPU), intellectual property protection (IPP), intellectual property management (IPM), intellectual property service (IPS), and optimize the IPR development system, and provide a solid guarantee for the development of various industries, including the manufacturing industry. In recent years, the IPR creation mechanism, market operation mechanism, protection system, regulatory system, and public service system faced by the manufacturing firms have been improved, but has the macro-level WCDIP promoted the performance of micro-manufacturing firms? A study by Wu and Tang (2016) found that the stronger the enforcement of IPP, the more the patent output of firms, and the more significant the promotion of patent output on firm performance. Using panel data from Korean firms, Cho et\u00a0al. (2015) empirically tested that the intensity of IPP has different effects on different industries and firms, specifically stronger IPP is more favorable to patent-intensive industries, but is detrimental to small and medium-sized firms. Wang and Hu (2021) analyzed the mechanism of macro-institutional effects on micro-firms with a sample of startups and concluded that the IPP system has a positive effect on both firm innovation and performance.\nIn summary, scholars have conducted some studies on the relationship between IPR and firm performance, but the following shortcomings remain: First, the literature on the impact of macro-level IPR development on firm performance is scarce and the research is mostly limited to the IPP perspective, while few scholars have conducted comprehensive studies from the perspective of WCDIP. Second, the theoretical and empirical research on the heterogeneity effect at the firm level is relatively weak, especially the systematic research on the impact of intellectual property development on the performance of heterogeneous manufacturing firms. This paper explores the role and heterogeneity effect of WCDIP on manufacturing firm performance (MFP) through empirical research, hoping to provide a theoretical basis for the government to promote MFP through WCDIP, and to provide a reference for manufacturing firms to achieve high-quality development through matching the national policies on WCDIP. The marginal contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we\u00a0 use the entropy value to construct an evaluation index system for WCDIP in five dimensions of IPC, IPU, IPP, IPM, and IPS, which enriches the measurement method of WCDIP. Second, using the panel regression models, we\u00a0explore the\nimpact of WCDIP and the development of each dimension on MFP from the macro level, which expands a new research direction of IPR. Finally, using the panel moderation regression models, we\u00a0reveal the heterogeneous impact of WCDIP on MFP from the perspectives of firm scale, property rights nature, and industry technology level, which complements the literature on the heterogeneity of firm performance research.\nThe remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: the second part defines the concept of WCDIP, summarizes the literature views related to WCDIP and firm performance, and presents the research hypotheses of this paper; the third part is the empirical research design scheme, providing detailed information about the sample and variable selection; the fourth part is the empirical research results and analysis, including benchmark regressions, model endogeneity problem solving, and robustness tests; finally, we\u00a0summarize the research findings and point out the practical implications."

There are few researchers on WCDIP in the existing literature, but some scholars have integrated several dimensions of WCDIP based on system principle and synergy theory. McCurdy and Phelps (2002) analyzed the internal composition of the IPR management system based on systematics theory, and regard the IPR management system as an organic composition of intellectual property protection, acquisition, utilization, and licensing subsystems. From a strategic perspective, Al-Aali and Teece (2013) argued that IPR should be\u00a0managed in an integrated manner, rather than separated according to creation, utilization, and protection. Shan (2014), Chen H. et\u00a0al. (2022), and Li et\u00a0al. (2022) integrated the IPR creation subsystem, utilization subsystem, protection subsystem, and management subsystem into one system.

            "text": "With the development of new growth theories, scholars have focused on the subsequent impacts of IPR development at the macro\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nlevel (Falvey et\u00a0al., 2006). On the one hand, it has been argued that these effects are reflected at the macro level, such as a country\u2019s economic growth, innovation, productivity, etc. (Bielig, 2015; Haydaroglu, 2015; Awaworyi Churchill et\u00a0al., 2022). On the other hand, studies have shown that IPR development also acts at the micro-firm level (Branstetter et\u00a0al., 2006; Wu and Tang, 2016; Van Stel et\u00a0al., 2019; Wang and Hu, 2021). This paper will discuss the relationship between WCDIP and MFP from five dimensions: creation, utilization, protection, management, and service. First of all, IPC is the process of developing knowledge products through innovation activities by innovation subjects, and it is the premise of WCDIP. The development of IPC reflects the potential of innovation subjects to generate IPR. IPC can help manufacturing firms maintain their competitive advantage (Cho et\u00a0al., 2015). This will motivate firms to increase their R&D investment and achieve a high quantity and quality of IPR output, which will improve their performance (Hazarika, 2021; Leung and Sharma, 2021). Second, IPU is the process of commercialization and marketization of IPR achievements, and it is the ultimate purpose of WCDIP. The development of IPU reflects the potential of realizing IPR value by industrializing and capitalizing on IPR achievements. Manufacturing firms tend to use IPR results on their products or license them to others (Cockburn, 2009), both of which generate revenue for the firm (Xu and Yang, 2019). Third, IPP is the process of protecting IPR according to law, and it is a strong guarantee for WCDIP. The development of IPP reflects the attitude and strength of the state in safeguarding the legitimate rights of innovation subjects by formulating and implementing relevant laws and regulations. IPP can reduce the occurrence of infringement, and manufacturing firms will be\u00a0 more inclined to increase R&D investment, consolidate patent reserves, actively participate in market transactions, and strive to improve firm performance through IPR activities (Allred and Park, 2007; Wu and Tang, 2016; Wang and Hu, 2021). In addition, IPM is the process of implementing the legal system of intellectual property through the adoption of a series of management actions by the relevant state departments, and it is the foundation of WCDIP. The development of IPM reflects the state\u2019s level of examination, supervision, coordination, and service on IPR acquisition and utilization. IPM provides firms with management mechanisms and standards that stimulate manufacturing firms to carry out IPR activities more efficiently and thus profitably in the competitive marketplace (Grimaldi et\u00a0al., 2021; Le Thi et\u00a0al., 2022). Using a sample of 308 Korean firms, Yong-Hyung and Ki-suk (2016) found that IPM policies have a significant positive impact on the business performance of startups. Finally, IPS is a special service that includes legal service and professional technical services, and it runs through all aspects of WCDIP. The development of IPS reflects the level of providing information, agency, and consultation for innovation subjects through the IPR public service system. As seen in the \u201cEvaluation Report of China\u2019s IPR Development Status in 2020\u201d published in 2021, the number of IPS providers and personnel has increased every year since 2010. By 2020, the number of IPS institutions reached 61,000 and the number of licensed patent attorneys reached 22,000. The IPR pledge financing service index increased by 42.0% from 2019. IPS can facilitate IPC, IPU, and IPM for manufacturing firms, thus contributing to the improvement of their performance. Based on this, the paper puts forward the following research hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: The whole chain development of intellectual property has a promotion effect on manufacturing firm performance."

            "text": "This paper will explore the heterogeneous impact of WCDIP on MFP from three aspects: firm size, property rights nature, and industry technology level.\nAccording to the quartiles of operating revenue, manufacturing firms can be\u00a0 divided into mega, large, medium, and small firms (Xiong, 2021). Large-scale manufacturing firms have more advantages than small-scale manufacturing firms in facing the opportunities brought by WCDIP. On the one hand, large-scale manufacturing firms have more deployable resources and financing channels (Zhuang et\u00a0al., 2022), and already have a scale advantage, which enables large-scale manufacturing firms to invest more human and material resources in innovation activities, so they have more intensive IPR activities, pay more attention to the development of external IPR environment, and obtain competitive advantages in IPR development (Zhang and Peng, 2016). Whereas small-scale manufacturing firms have relatively few IPR activities due to the lack of innovation ability, which makes it difficult for them to profit from the development of the external IPR environment. On the other hand, large-scale manufacturing firms have well-developed IPM institutions and management systems, and rich IPM experience, to implement external IPR policies more accurately (Gonz\u00e1lez-\u00c1lvarez and Nieto-Antol\u00edn, 2007). While smallscale manufacturing firms are faced with many constraints in the implementation of IPR policies due to a lack of experience in IPR development (Agostini et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhuang et\u00a0al., 2022). Empirical studies have been conducted, which also show this view (Macdonald, 2004; Suh and Hwang, 2010). Based on this, this paper proposes the following research hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: Compared with small-scale manufacturing firms, the whole chain development of intellectual property has a stronger promotion effect on the large-scale manufacturing firm performance.\nState-owned manufacturing firms and non-state-owned manufacturing firms have heterogeneity in the relationship between WCDIP and firm performance because of the special institutional background, and the heterogeneity is manifested in political attributes and firm governance. On the one hand, the heavy policy burden may cause state-owned manufacturing firms to violate their business objectives and have a relatively low willingness to engage in innovative activities with high risks and uncertain returns (Tang and Sun, 2014; Duan and Kang, 2022), while non-state-owned manufacturing firms have a lighter policy burden, and are brave enough to engage in technological innovation and IPR activities to achieve high returns, so they rely more on WCDIP. On the other hand, in terms of firm governance, managers of state-owned manufacturing firms are not the actual decision-makers, and there is a mismatch between risk-taking and benefits (Chen L. et\u00a0al., 2022). The management of state-owned\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nmanufacturing firms is doubly constrained in terms of economic and political incentives (Low, 2009; Huang and Li, 2019), which limits the innovative activities of managers. However, managers of non-stateowned manufacturing firms are the actual decision-makers, and their benefits and risks are consistent, coupled with a perfect residual ownership distribution system, which makes managers more willing to innovate, pay more attention to the dynamics of external WCDIP, and more adept in seizing the opportunities brought by WCDIP to improve firm performance (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2015). Based on this, this paper proposes the following research hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: Compared with state-owned manufacturing firms, the whole chain development of intellectual property has a stronger promotion effect on the non-state-owned manufacturing firm performance.\nAccording to the industry technology level, manufacturing firms can be\u00a0divided into low-technology (low-tech) manufacturing firms, medium-technology (medium-tech) manufacturing firms, and hightechnology (high-tech) manufacturing firms. Studies have shown that medium- and high-technology manufacturing firms have an advantage in technological innovation and IPR development compared to low-technology manufacturing firms (Acemoglu and Akcigit, 2012; Zheng and Song, 2012; Woo et\u00a0al., 2015). On the one hand, medium- and high-tech industries have higher technology intensity and stronger technological innovation capability (Luo and Liu, 2009). In order to maintain their competitive advantages, medium- and high-tech manufacturing firms tend to increase technological innovation, pay more attention to the IPR environment, and adjust their innovation direction and IPR strategies in time according to changes in the external environment. Whereas low-tech manufacturing firms lack innovation and IPR activities, the promotion effect of WCDIP on firm performance is also limited. On the other hand, a higher technology level means higher barriers to entry and lower competition in the market. In addition, the achievements of high-level IPR are not easy to be\u00a0imitated, so medium- and high-tech manufacturing firms are more motivated to carry out innovation and IPR activities (Wang and Xu, 2005), which further releases the promotion effect of WCDIP on the medium- and high-tech manufacturing firm performance. Based on this, this paper proposes the following research hypothesis:\nHypothesis 4: Compared with low-tech manufacturing firms, the whole chain development of intellectual property has a stronger promotion effect on the medium-and high-tech manufacturing firm performance."

The current indicators for measuring the level of firm performance are broadly divided into two categories: first, the indicators based on firm finances represented by the return on total\nassets and return on net assets; second, the indicators based on capital market returns represented by Tobin\u2019s Q value. Financial indicators can only respond to historical data, but react slowly to changes in firm performance and require a certain response period (Li and Kong, 2005). In this paper, Tobin\u2019s Q value is used to measure MFP based on the following two considerations. First, the sample selected for this study is listed as manufacturing firms, which are more active in terms of market performance. Tobin\u2019s Q value is an indicator to measure the market performance of firms, and the selection of Tobin\u2019s Q value can make the results more accurate. Second, compared with financial indicators, Tobin\u2019s Q value can reflect and predict the current and future value of companies, and passive disclosure will not be\u00a0subjectively manipulated by management (Hai et\u00a0al., 2020), so it can more sensitively and objectively reflect the changes of manufacturing firms with the changes of WCDIP, which is more consistent with this study. This study uses Tobin Q to measure MFP in the main effect test, drawing on the research of Swift (2013), and Wu and Xiao (2016). In the robustness test, we\u00a0use the logarithmic value of operating income (lnOR) to measure MFP, drawing on the research of Liu and Chen (2010). Tobin\u2019s Q value is the ratio of a firm market value to the replacement cost of its assets, which is calculated as follows:\nTobin\u2019s Q value = (price per share \u00d7 number of tradable shares + net assets per share \u00d7 number of non-tradable shares + liabilities)/ total assets."

(2) The level of IPU is ultimately tested by the market, and the higher the activity of the IPR market and the higher the transaction volume, the higher the level of IPU; (3) IPP aims to protect IPC and IPU, and whether intellectual achievements are effectively protected and whether IPR can be\u00a0traded in a safe environment is the key to measuring the level of IPP (Wu and Tang, 2016; Zhuang et\u00a0 al., 2022). (4) IPM makes the intellectual property activities of innovation subjects more standardized and efficient, and the construction of IPM rules and regulations and the efficiency of IPM are important indicators of the level of IPM; (5) The more dense the intellectual property service institutions and service personnel in a region, the more developed the local IPS are. Therefore, the number of intellectual property service institutions and service personnel can reflect the level of IPS development. The indicators\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nselected based on the above idea and the indicator weights determined by the entropy value method are shown in Table\u00a01."

Considering that macro-level WCDIP has a certain delay effect on MFP, MFP lags by one period, and MFPi,t + 1 denotes the performance of firm i\u00a0 in year t + 1. The explanatory variable WCDIPi,t denotes the whole chain development of intellectual property faced by firm i\u00a0in year t. IPXi,t includes intellectual property creation (IPCi,t), intellectual property utilization (IPUi,t), intellectual property protection (IPPi,t), intellectual property management (IPMi,t), and intellectual property service (IPSi,t). When taking MFP as the explanatory variable, the individual characteristic variables and other financial indicators at the firm level should be\u00a0 considered. These variables are closely related to MFP and may cause estimation bias if omitted. Therefore, the control variables CVi,t include firm total assets, firm net profit, gearing ratio, firm ownership nature, and firm industry technology level. \u03b4i and \u03b6i denote individual fixed effects and industry fixed effects, respectively, and \u03b5it denotes the error term.\nThe existing research literature on firm heterogeneity provides a theoretical basis for this paper to infirm firm heterogeneity factors into the empirical research framework of the impact of WCDIP on MFP. Most scholars believe that firms of different scales, property rights nature, and industry technology levels have significant differences in their ability to adapt to the external environment. Therefore, firm size, property rights nature, and industry technology level may be\u00a0important influencing factors for WCDIP on MFP.

In order to explore the heterogeneous effect of WCDIP on MFP of different sizes, an interaction term between WCDIP and the dummy variable of firm size (WCDIPi,t*sizei,t,r) is added to the model. a3 is the coefficient of interactive items.

If firm i\u00a0is a state-owned manufacturing firm in year t, the value is 1; for non-state-owned manufacturing firms, the value is 0. In order to explore the heterogeneous effect of WCDIP on MFP with different property rights, the interaction term between WCDIP and the dummy variable of whether or not a manufacturing firm is state-owned (WCDIPi,t*capital_typei,t) is added to the model. If a3 is significantly positive, it indicates a stronger promotion effect of WCDIP on the performance of state-owned manufacturing firms.

In order to explore the heterogeneity effect of WCDIP on MFP of different industry technology levels, the interaction term between WCDIP and the dummy variable of the industry technology level (WCDIPi,t*industryi,t) is added to the model.

Column (3) reports the impact of the five dimensions of IPC, IPU, IPP, IPM, and IPS on MFP. Given the other variables unchanged, IPC, IPU, and IPS have a promotion effect on MFP, and the promotion effect of IPS is the most significant (BIPS\u00a0= 5.020, p\u00a0< 0.01), followed by IPU (BIPU\u00a0= 2.594, p\u00a0< 0.01) and IPC (BIPC\u00a0= 1.228, p\u00a0< 0.01). The IPS promotes MFP by building service platforms and improving service efficiency. The IPU promotes MFP by stimulating market vitality and expanding IPR trading platforms. The IPC promotes MFP by correctly guiding the R&D orientation of firms and consolidating the high-level IPR stock of firms. However, IPP (BIPP\u00a0 = \u22120.903, p\u00a0 < 0.01) and IPM (BIPM\u00a0= \u22122.585, p\u00a0< 0.01) have a suppressive effect on MFP, probably because the measures of these two dimensions are more macroscopic than the other three dimensions and involve the promulgation and implementation of policies and legal documents, but the impact of policies and legal documents on micro-firm performance will take some time to reflect. Therefore, this paper takes Tobin\u2019s Q value of t + 2 and t + 3 as explanatory variables to test again. Columns (4)\u2013(5) show that IPP still has a suppressive effect on MFP, probably because China is still at the stage of building an innovative country, with a strong capacity for imitative innovation and a weak capacity for original innovation (van Stel et\u00a0al., 2019), and an excessive level of IPP will increase the cost of imitative innovation of manufacturing firms and thus negatively affect MFP (Falvey et\u00a0 al., 2006; Gold et\u00a0 al., 2019). IPM has a significant promotion effect on MFP, probably because IPM makes the innovation and IPR activities of manufacturing firms more standardized and efficient, and then promotes MFP. But the promotion effect can only be\u00a0seen after a certain period due to the lagging effect of policies and regulations.\nAlthough this paper controls for industry fixed effects, individual fixed effects, and other firm characteristics that affect performance in the baseline regression model, there may still be\u00a0uncontrollable factors, such as the macroeconomic environment and socio-cultural environment, that may have an impact on WCDIP and MFP, which may lead to some bias in the estimated coefficients. In order to solve the possible endogenous problems, this paper will use the instrumental variables method to further test the accuracy of the research results. Referring to the study of Xiong (2021), this paper takes the WCDIP of the United\u00a0Kingdom index as a tool variable, because the United\u00a0Kingdom has frequent trade with China, and the WCDIP of the United\u00a0Kingdom is correlated with the WCDIP of China, while it is not related to the market performance of China\u2019s manufacturing firms. Therefore, the WCDIP of the United\u00a0Kingdom index is used as the instrumental variable for endogeneity analysis. If the level of IPR development in the United\u00a0Kingdom is higher than that in China in that year, the value is 1, otherwise, the value is 0. Considering the correlation between instrumental variables and endogenous variables, this paper uses three kinds of statistics to test. First, the Kleibergen-Paap rk LM statistic is used to test the hypothesis of \u201cunder-identification of instrumental variables,\u201d which is rejected at the 1% level. Second, the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F-statistic is 30.388, which is higher than the 10% level critical value of the Stock-Yogo test, and the Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic is 30.573, which is higher than the 10% level critical value of StockYogo test, all of which reject the hypothesis of weak identification of instrumental variables. Finally, the value of the first-stage F-statistic is 34.8, which is much higher than 10, so it can be\u00a0concluded that\nthere is no weak instrumental variable problem. In summary, it can be\u00a0judged that there is a strong correlation between instrumental variables and endogenous variables. Therefore, the instrumental variables selected in this paper satisfy the application conditions. The results of the first-stage regression show that the coefficient of the instrumental variables is significantly positive at the 1% significance level, which indicates that there is a significant positive relationship between the level of WCDIP in China and the level of IPR development in China and the United\u00a0Kingdom. The estimation results of the two-stage least squares method reported in column (6) show that although the coefficients estimated by the instrumental variables method are somewhat different from the coefficients of the benchmark regression, the signs and significance of the core variables are consistent with the results of the benchmark regression, so the results of the benchmark regression are relatively robust and reliable."

In contrast, large-scale manufacturing firms often have mature development, complex organizational structure, and a set of standardized operation modes, which makes it difficult for them to respond quickly to the external environment (Tripsas and Gavetti, 2017). In addition, relevant studies support this conclusion (Arora and Fosfuri, 2003; Motohashi, 2008).

            "text": "H1 confirms the positive association between WCDIP and MFP, and the prior literature supports our findings. This implies that the better the macro WCDIP environment is, the more favorable it is for MFP. The specific mechanism of the effect of WCDIP on MFP can be\u00a0reflected in five dimensions: IPC, IPU, IPP, IPM, and IPS. IPC development can stimulate manufacturing firms to increase R&D investment and innovation output, and studies have shown that patent application can improve the innovation performance of firms and have a positive impact on firm performance (Andries and Faems, 2013; Cho et\u00a0al., 2015; Leung and Sharma, 2021). IPU development provides a good market trading environment for firms, which provides a good basis for manufacturing firms to transform and transfer IPR results. The existing literature suggests that firms tend to transfer patents to external parties (Cockburn, 2009), which brings additional revenue to firms (Gans et\u00a0al., 2002). IPP development can help firms to defend their legal rights and reduce external infringements, thus increasing their incentive to engage in IPR activities and profit from them. While this has been demonstrated in relevant studies, it has also been suggested that IPP does not promote performance growth, which is consistent with the results of the empirical tests in this paper. This may also be\u00a0related to the current stage of China as a developing country (Falvey et\u00a0al., 2006; Gold et\u00a0al., 2019). IPM development enhances the competitiveness of firms by setting development standards and standardizing the IPM activities"

There are empirical studies that support this view (Yong-hyung and Ki-suk, 2016), but the implementation of IPM standards requires a certain period to work on firm performance. IPS development helps firms to quickly access IPR-related information and facilitates efficient IPR activities, which will benefit firms to improve their performance. H2 shows that WCDIP is more beneficial to the performance of large-scale manufacturing firms compared to small-scale manufacturing firms. Scholars have explained this in terms of accessible resources and financing channels, suggesting that largescale firms not only have more human, financial, and material resources but also more channels for financing, which facilitates largescale firms to quickly identify opportunities in the external environment of IPR development and gain competitive advantages from them (Zhang and Peng, 2016; Zhuang et\u00a0al., 2022). It has also been shown that stronger IPR conditions stimulate large-scale firms to increase R&D expenditures and boost sales revenue. In contrast, small-scale firms will not be\u00a0able to generate better sales revenue due to budget constraints (Cho et\u00a0 al., 2015). This is contrary to the empirical test results in this paper, which may be\u00a0because small-scale manufacturing firms are more responsive and quicker to make decisions, adapt quickly to changes in the external environment, and take the lead to improve their performance, while large-scale manufacturing firms are slower to respond to changes in the external environment due to organizational inertia.\nH3 shows that WCDIP is more beneficial to the performance of non-state manufacturing firms compared to state-owned manufacturing firms. The results of this paper confirm this hypothesis, which has also been verified in many studies. It shows that non-state manufacturing firms have the advantages of lighter policy burden and better incentive system than state-owned manufacturing firms, and managers of non-state manufacturing firms are more willing to innovate and carry out IPR activities, so non-state manufacturing firms are better at finding opportunities to develop themselves in WCDIP environment (Low, 2009; Tang and Sun, 2014; Huang and Li, 2019; Duan and Kang, 2022).\nTABLE\u00a05 Robustness test of the impact of WCDIP on MFP.\nVariables (1) (2) (3)\nL.TQ (Delete 2018)\nL.lnOR L.lnOR (Delete 2018)\nWCDIP 15.671*** 2.210*** 2.798***\n(85.771) (8.223) (10.187)\nLnasset 0.125*** 0.750*** 0.684***\n(17.325) (81.562) (63.256)\nLeverage 0.004*** 0.001 \u22120.001\n(2.621) (0.425) (\u22120.265)\nLnnp \u22120.449*** \u22120.052*** 0.142\n(\u22123.196) (\u22123.277) (0.672)\nSOE 0.129*** 0.100*** 0.109***\n(5.467) (3.205) (3.052)\nIdf Yes Yes Yes\nInd Yes Yes Yes\nw-R2 0.632 0.507 0.469\nN 7,760 9,700 7,760\nTABLE\u00a06 Robustness test of the heterogeneity impact of WCDIP on MFP.\nVariables (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)\nFirm scale Property rights nature\nTechnology level\nSmallscale\nMediumscale\nLargescale\nMegascale\nStateowned\nNonstateowned\nHightech\nMediumtech\nLowtech\nL.MFP L.MFP L.MFP L.MFP L.MFP L.MFP L.MFP L.MFP L.MFP\nWCDIP 20.660*** 16.387*** 12.826*** 9.592*** 10.839*** 19.695*** 16.275*** 15.973*** 14.560***\n(51.059) (39.710) (38.743) (35.494) (59.264) (72.423) (38.754) (68.804) (34.292)\nLnasset 0.198*** 0.193*** 0.136*** 0.124*** 0.058*** 0.131*** 0.102*** 0.132*** 0.138***\n(9.901) (8.052) (6.707) (8.941) (7.027) (12.779) (6.623) (13.750) (6.394)\nLeverage 0.005** 0.314*** 0.253*** 0.015 0.084*** 0.004** 0.058*** 0.004** 0.344***\n(2.446) (5.002) (4.886) (0.287) (2.943) (2.169) (4.609) (2.022) (5.458)\nLnnp \u22127.074*** 2.091** 1.615** 0.016 0.095 \u22120.357 0.092 \u22120.525*** \u22121.226***\n(\u22122.779) (2.379) (2.552) (0.139) (0.772) (\u22121.577) (0.374) (\u22122.755) (\u22123.137)\nSOE 0.143*** 0.087* 0.031 0.026 0.000 0.000 0.155*** 0.087*** 0.124**\n(2.954) (1.872) (0.614) (0.603) (3.172) (2.619) (2.381)\nIdf Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nInd Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nw-R2 0.639 0.568 0.549 0.637 0.641 0.695 0.619 0.631 0.640\nN 1,968 1,995 1,910 1,887 3,253 4,507 1,948 4,637 1,175\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nH4 indicates that WCDIP is more beneficial to the performance of medium- and high-technology manufacturing firms compared to low-tech manufacturing firms. Compared to low-tech manufacturing firms, medium- and high-tech manufacturing firms are more dependent on innovation, more motivated to conduct R&D, and able to seize the opportunities brought by macro WCDIP promptly to actively develop IPR, thus improving firm performance. Previous studies have also found the same findings and support our study (Wang and Xu, 2005; Cho et\u00a0al., 2015).\nAll along, China attaches great importance to the development of the manufacturing industry and regards WCDIP as a driving force for the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. WCDIP refers to the synergistic development of the five dimensions of creation, utilization, protection, management, and service, rather than the single-dimensional development. In the existing studies, few scholars have explored the relationship between WCDIP and firm performance from a comprehensive perspective, and most scholars have only studied its effect on firm performance from a certain dimension. For example, scholars such as Wu and Tang (2016) and Wang and Hu (2021) found that IPP had a significant contribution to firm performance. As a comprehensive dimension, there may also be\u00a0a link between WCDIP and MFP. In addition, in corporate practice, firms set up IPR affairs departments to quickly adapt to changes in the external IPR environment, which are specifically responsible for IPR work. It is evident that firms attach importance to the macro IPR development environment. The research findings of this paper have certain reference values for the government and manufacturing firms. On the one hand, it provides direction for the government to optimize the strategic layout of IPR. The government should formulate specific policies according to the characteristics of different types of firms to maximize the effectiveness of the policies. On the other hand, manufacturing firms should strengthen their internal IPR management to be\u00a0 able to seize opportunities in the IPR development environment."

            "text": "The results of this empirical study show that WCDIP can significantly promote MFP, but the five dimensions of IPC, IPU, IPP, IPM, and IPS have different effects on MFP. IPC, IPU, and IPS have a significant promotion effect on MFP, among which IPS has the strongest promotion effect, followed by IPU and IPC. Professional IPS improves the efficiency and effectiveness of intellectual property activities of manufacturing firms, which, in turn, promotes manufacturing firm performance; IPU helps manufacturing firms to realize the transformation of intellectual property achievements by stimulating intellectual property market activity, which, in turn, promotes MFP; IPC maintains the sustainable competitive advantage of manufacturing firms by correctly guiding the direction of R&D and increasing the stock of creative achievements, which, in turn, promotes MFP. There is a significant negative relationship between IPP, IPM, and MFP. Considering that IPM involves the promulgation and implementation of policies and regulations, and the effect of policies and regulations has a lag, this paper tests the firm performance again\nwith a lag of three periods. The results show that IPM has a significant promotion effect on MFP, while IPP and MFP are still significantly negatively correlated. IPM makes the innovation and intellectual property activities of manufacturing firms more standardized and efficient, and thus promotes MFP, but the lagging effect of policies and regulations makes this promotion effect appear only after a certain period. IPP always has a suppressive effect on MFP, probably because China is still in the construction stage of an innovative country, with strong imitation innovation capability and insufficient original innovation capability, and the excessive level of IPP will increase the cost of imitation innovation of manufacturing firms and thus negatively affect MFP.\nIn addition, the promotion effect of WCDIP on MFP of different types is heterogeneous. In terms of firm size, the promotion effect of WCDIP on MFP is small, medium, large, and mega manufacturing firms from strong to weak. In terms of property rights nature, the promotion effect of WCDIP on the performance of non-state manufacturing firms is significantly stronger than that of state-owned manufacturing firms. In terms of industry technology level, WCDIP has the strongest promotion effect on the performance of mediumtech manufacturing firms, followed by high-tech manufacturing firms, and finally low-tech manufacturing firms. Furthermore, the results of the endogeneity test based on the instrumental variables method and the robustness test based on re-screening the sample and replacing the explanatory variables also support the above findings."

Further, break the institutional barriers and resource bottleneck of non-state manufacturing firms in innovation development. Actively exert the innovation leading role of mediumand high-tech manufacturing firms, promote the organic integration of the innovation value chain of high-, medium- and low-tech manufacturing firms, and fully release the strong promotion effect of WCDIP on the performance of small-scale, non-state, mediumand high-tech manufacturing firms. \u2462 To improve the performance of large-scale, state-owned, low-tech manufacturing firms, it is not enough to rely on WCDIP alone, and diversified policies are needed. For example, guide large-scale manufacturing firms to high-end, intelligent, and green development by implementing intelligent manufacturing engineering and digital transformation, and realize precise service for large-scale manufacturing firms by establishing the \u201cfirm through train\u201d system. Promote the innovation in the operational and mechanism of mixed ownership reform of stateowned manufacturing firms, and enhance the environmental insight and response sensitivity of state-owned manufacturing firms. Strengthen the awareness of transformation and upgrading of low-tech manufacturing firms, increase the assistance during the transition period of transformation and upgrading, and enhance the status of low-tech manufacturing firms in the international division of labor.\nIn addition, manufacturing firms should respond positively to the national WCDIP policy, solve the problem of unbalanced and insufficient IPR development, and cooperate to promote the highquality development of the manufacturing industry. The specific policy suggestions are as follows: \u2460 Manufacturing firms should implant the concept of IPR development, actively study and judge the national WCDIP policy, grasp the policy dividends to strengthen the foundation of innovation and IPR development, and build the management mechanism of synergy between IPR and firm performance. \u2461 Small-scale, non-state-owned, medium- and hightech manufacturing firms should build a framework system of highquality output, rapid transformation, key protection, and standard management of IPR as soon as possible, make full use of the strong driving effect of WCDIP on performance, and enhance the core competitiveness and international competitiveness of IPR. \u2462 Largescale, state-owned, low-tech manufacturing firms should overcome their obstacles such as low efficiency, rigid organization, and backward consciousness, tap the shortcomings of insufficient innovation and IPR development and apply precise measures and\ntargeted efforts to collaboratively promote the manufacturing industry out of the dilemma of being large but not strong."
