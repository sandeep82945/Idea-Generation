            "text": "In \u03b1+28Si elastic and inelastic scattering at projectile energies of E = 50\u2013 120 MeV, various refractive effects are observed, such as a nuclear rainbow and Airy minima of the first (A1) and (or) second (A2) orders, which are a key ingredient in the unambiguous determination of the characteristics of the nucleus\u2013nucleus interaction (see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2]). These refractive effects were revealed [3] as a result of a systematic data analysis within the S-matrix formalism using a six-parameter S-matrix model [4].\nIn this context, it seems important using these results for \u03b1+28Si scattering to perform an S-matrix analysis of the one-nucleon transfer reactions induced by \u03b1-particles and to find out whether the indicated refractive effects are manifested in these reactions. The appearance of such effects depends on the correspondence between a number of parameters of the entrance and\n(2-A1.1)\nexit channels (see, e.g., Refs. [5, 6]). The procedure for identifying Airy minima in transfer reaction angular distributions is similar to that used in the case of elastic scattering (e.g., Refs. [3, 7, 8]).\nTo perform S-matrix analysis of the one-nucleon transfer reactions, we use the partial-wave representation of the transfer amplitude [9, 10] expressed in terms of the S-matrices for the entrance and exit reaction channels. In this case, the Hahne representation [11] of the transition matrix element is applied, which is an extension of that of Austern\u2013Blair [12] for inelastic scattering. In this approach, it is assumed that the Hahne representation of the transition matrix element for inelastic scattering is also applicable to transfer reactions populating the levels of the final nuclei by a one-step process. Of course, the consequence of the applied simplifications is the loss of the spectroscopic strength but, at the same time, the dynamics of the transfer reaction, Q-value dependence, and transfer angular momentum matching are properly described (for more details see, e.g., Refs. [9, 10, 13]).\nParametrization [4] was taken as S-matrices for the entrance and exit channels since it turned out to be very successful in describing the nuclear rainbow pattern and refractive patterns with Airy minima (see, e.g., Refs. [3, 14]). The S-matrix parameters have been derived from the analysis of the elastic scattering data for both entrance and exit channels.\nWithin this approach, Airy minima A1 and A2 have been identified for the first time in the differential cross sections for the 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si and 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reactions with the transition to the ground states of the final nuclei at E\u03b1 = 50\u2013120 MeV. The formation of these minima due to particular partial waves has been analysed."

            "text": "We have performed calculations of the angular distributions for the 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si reaction with the \u2113 = 0 (here, \u2113 is the transfer angular momentum) transition to the ground state (1/2+) in 29Si (Q-value of reaction is \u221212.104 MeV) at E\u03b1 = 64.9 and 120.0 MeV, and for the 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reaction with the \u2113 = 0 transition to the ground state (1/2+) in 29P (Q = \u221217.065 MeV) at E\u03b1 = 50.0 and 64.9 MeV. Note that the indicated transfer momentum was defined in Ref. [15].\nFor a transfer reaction with a zero transfer momentum involving spinless nuclei and neglecting the nuclear recoil effect, the differential cross section within the framework of the distorted-wave Born approximation is given by [9]\nd\u03c3 d\u2126 (\u03b8) = mimf (2\u03c0\u210f2)2 kf ki |T (\u03b8)|2 , (1)\nT (\u03b8) = \u03c4\n\u221a 4\u03c0\nkikf \u221e\u2211 l=0 (2l + 1)ei(\u03c3 i l+\u03c3 f l)\u03b2lPl(cos \u03b8) , (2)\nwhere \u03b8 is the scattering angle, the indices \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 refer to the entrance and exit channels, respectively, m is the reduced mass, k is the wave number of relative motion, \u03c4 is the transfer parameter, \u03c3l is the Coulomb scattering phase, and \u03b2l is the transition matrix element.\nThe transition matrix element is taken in the form of [11]\n\u03b2l = 1\n2i\n[ EicmE f cm\n\u2202Sil \u2202l \u2202Sfl \u2202l\n]1/2 , (3)\nwhere Ei(f)cm is the center-of-mass energy in the entrance (i) or exit (f) channel, Sil and S f l are the nuclear S-matrix elements in the state with angular momentum l in the entrance and exit channels, respectively. The applicability of expression (3) to the considered transfer reactions was discussed in the introduction. The use of (3) makes it possible to perform calculations directly in the angular momentum space if the representations of the S-matrix elements Sil and S f l are chosen.\nIn our analysis of (\u03b1, 3He) and (\u03b1, t) reactions on 28Si, the nuclear S-matrix element as a complex function of the angular momentum L = l+1/2 both in the entrance and exit channels has the following parameterized form [4]:\nS (L) = \u03b7 (L) exp [2i\u03b4r (L)] , \u03b7 (L) = exp [\u22122\u03b40g (L,L0, \u22060)] , (4) \u03b4r (L) = \u03b41g 2 (L,L1, \u22061) , (5)\ng (L,Lj , \u2206j) = sinh\n( Lj \u2206j ) cosh ( Lj \u2206j ) + cosh ( L \u2206j\n) , j = 0, 1 , (6) where \u03b7 (L) is the scattering matrix modulus, \u03b4r (L) is the nuclear refraction phase, the parameters 2\u03b40,1 are measures of the intensity of absorption and nuclear refraction, respectively, Lj and \u2206j are the parameters, characterizing the size and diffuseness of the absorption (j = 0) and refraction (j = 1) regions, the indices \u2018i\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 indicating the entrance and exit channels are omitted for all presented quantities and parameters. It is convenient to introduce the relation 2\u03b40 = \u2212 ln \u03b5, where \u03b5 is the nuclear transparency.\nThe characteristic features of the one-nucleon stripping reaction cross sections are analyzed using the nearside\u2013farside decomposition [16], which is applicable in the usual way due to the presence of the Legendre polynomials in (2). To detect Airy minima, we study the behavior of both the farside\ncomponent of transfer reaction cross section under consideration and the farside cross-section component obtained in the case of turned-off absorption in the entrance channel (see, e.g., Refs. [17, 18]). In the latter case, when calculating (3), we set | Sil |= 1 for all l. The minimum of the cross section, which is described by the farside cross-section component and whose angular position is the same or close enough to that for the Airy minimum of a particular order in the farside component, calculated with the turned-off absorption in the entrance channel, is identified as the Airy minimum of the same particular order.\nAt the first stage of our work, the S-matrix parameters for the entrance channel of the studied (\u03b1, 3He) and (\u03b1, t) reactions on 28Si are derived from the analysis of the \u03b1+28Si elastic scattering data at energies under consideration. The parameters at E\u03b1 = 50.0 and 120.0 MeV (see Table 1) were taken from Ref. [3], and at E\u03b1 = 64.9 MeV were obtained from the agreement of the calculated cross section both with the result of the optical model analysis of the data (unpublished) at the same energy (see Ref. [15]) and with the existing data for the neighboring system \u03b1+27Al at 64.5 MeV (see Fig. 1). The calculations were performed using the elastic scattering amplitude in the form of a standard expansion into a series of Legendre polynomials. The nuclear part of the S-matrix had the representation of (4)\u2013(6), and the Coulomb scattering phase was taken in the form of [3, 4]. The obtained S-matrix parameters for 64.9 MeV are listed in Table 1.\nThe next stage of the work is associated with finding the S-matrix parameters for the exit channels of the transfer reactions under consideration. Due to the non-availability of data on the 3He+29Si and t+29P elastic scattering at the required energies, we will obtain the exit channel parameters from the results of the analysis of the available data for systems adjacent to the indicated ones at close to the required energies. Thus, as the S-matrix parameters for the exit channel of the 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si reaction at E\u03b1 = 64.9 and 120.0 MeV we will use the parameters obtained from the description of the elastic scattering angular distributions for 3He+28Si at 60.0 MeV and 3He+27Al at 119.0 MeV, respectively. The S-matrix parameters for the exit channel of the 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reaction at E\u03b1 = 50.0 and 64.9 MeV will be the parameters producing the best fits to the elastic scattering angular distributions for t+30Si at 36.0 MeV and 3He+29Si at 46.0 MeV, respectively. The results of the elastic scattering data analysis for the systems listed above using the parametrization of (4)\u2013(6) are shown in Fig. 2. The spin\u2013orbit part of the nuclear S-matrix was not taken into account in the calculations due to its unimportant effect on the scattering cross section (e.g., Refs. [17, 20]). The quality of fitting the experimental data was determined by means of the usual \u03c72/N (N is the number of data points) magnitude. A uniform uncertainty of 10% was assumed for all considered experimental cross-section points. The calculation parameters and the values of \u03c72/N are given in Table 2.\nUsing (1)\u2013(6) and parameters for Si(L) from Table 1 and for Sf(L) from Table 2, we have calculated the differential cross sections for the 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si, and 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reactions accompanied by the transition to the ground states of final nuclei within the incident energy range 50\u2013120 MeV (dash-double-dotted curve in Fig. 3 (a), (b), (c), and (d), obtained with \u03c4 = 0.328, 0.341, 0.300 and 0.211 fm, respectively). We have also obtained the farside components of these cross sections for the case of turned-off absorption in the entrance channel (short-dashed curves in Figs. 3 (a)\u2013(d)). Note that the description of the cross sections for the indicated one-nucleon stripping reactions is performed without using any fitting S-matrix parameters for both reaction channels and serves as a critical test for the results of the analysis of the elastic scattering cross sections.\nWhen refining the parameter values for the exit channels of the considered transfer reactions, based on the corresponding values of Table 2, a slight variation of the latter (mainly within 10%) seems legitimate for better agreement between the calculation results and the data. Differential cross sections calculated with the exit channel parameters changed in this way (see Table 3, parameter \u03c4 for each reaction was not varied) and the\nentrance channel parameters of Table 1 are displayed in Fig. 3 together with their nearside\u2013farside components. Table 3 also shows the values of \u03c72tr/N (10% error bars) for the calculated cross sections.\nFrom Fig. 3 we see that the results of both versions of calculating the transfer reaction cross sections are mostly close to each other in the measured angular range, which makes it possible to use them equally for revealing Airy structures. In general, the agreement between the calculated and measured transfer reaction cross sections is reasonable in view of the simplifying assumptions (see Refs. [10, 11]) made to obtain (2) and (3)."

            "text": "The 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si reaction leading to the ground state of 29Si at E\u03b1 = 120.0 MeV refers to the case when a nuclear rainbow is observed in elastic scattering of nuclei interacting in both the entrance and exit channels (see Ref. [3] and Fig. 2 (a)). As can be seen in Fig. 3 (a), the differential cross section for this reaction also displays a pattern characteristic of a nuclear rainbow preceded by the Airy minimum A1, which turns out to be shifted towards smaller angles compared with that for the \u03b1+28Si elastic scattering (see Fig. 4).\nConsidering the (\u03b1, 3He) and (\u03b1, t) reactions on 28Si at E\u03b1 = 64.9 and 50.0 MeV, we are dealing with the case when the pattern of elastic scattering of nuclei interacting in the entrance channel (refractive pattern with minima A1 and A2 (see Fig. 1 and Ref. [3])) and that in the exit channel (nuclear rainbow/prerainbow pattern only with A1 (see Figs. 2 (b)\u2013(d))) are quite different. The calculated angular distributions for the 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si and 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reactions at E\u03b1 = 64.9 MeV are characterized by a well-marked A2 minimum and a weakly pronounced A1 minimum (see Figs. 3 (b) and (c)), whereas in the available data for each of these reactions one can notice only a hint of A1 minimum. Figure 3 (d) indicates that a weakly pronounced A2 minimum is retained in the differential cross section for the 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reaction at E\u03b1 = 50.0 MeV, being at a position shifted forward from that in the case of \u03b1+28Si elastic scattering (see Fig. 4), but the A1 minimum disappears.\nLet us find out which particular partial waves are responsible for the appearance of the identified Airy minima in the calculated cross sections for the (\u03b1, 3He) and (\u03b1, t) reactions on 28Si. To do this, we split the transition amplitude (2) into the sum of three subamplitudes for the ranges \u2206l1 = 0 \u00f7 lm \u2212 1, \u2206l2 = lm \u00f7 ln, and \u2206l3 = ln + 1 \u00f7 \u221e. The angular momenta lm and ln are determined proceeding from the fact that we are looking for the narrowest possible \u2206l2, for which the calculated component of the transfer reaction cross section continues to describe all available Airy minima and their surroundings. The cross-section components calculated for \u2206l2 and \u2206l3 have little effect on the formation of the mentioned Airy minima.\nFigure 5 presents our results obtained in such a way: we found \u2206l2 = 6\u00f723 (corresponding impact parameter range \u2206b2 = \u2206l2/ki = 1.4\u00f75.5 fm) for the 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si reaction at E\u03b1 = 120.0 MeV, \u2206l2 = 2\u00f716 and 3\u00f718 (\u2206b2 = 0.7 \u00f7 5.9 and 1.0 \u00f7 5.8 fm) for the 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P reaction at E\u03b1= 50.0 and 64.9 MeV, respectively (the boundaries of the ranges \u2206l1 and \u2206l3 adjacent to \u2206l2 on both sides are obvious). The dashed, dash-double-dotted, and dotted curves are calculated for \u2206l2, \u2206l3 and \u2206l1, respectively.\nFrom Fig. 5 we see that in each of the considered cases the cross-section component obtained for \u2206l2 (dashed curve) represents the major contribution to the corresponding total cross section (solid curve) in the measured angular range. This component is farside dominated (as shown by the shortdashed curve). The farside contribution to the considered cross-section component in the case of turned-off absorption in the entrance channel (dash-\ndotted curve) is characterized by the presence of A1 and (or) A2 minima at angles close to those for the Airy minima in the experimental data. The cross-section components obtained for \u2206l1 and \u2206l3 are small.\nConsider the localization of the found \u2206l2 ranges in l-space. To be specific, surface waves are considered to be those that have angular momenta for which | Sil | varies from 0.1 to 0.9 (see Ref. [24]), and inner waves are those for which | Sil |< 0.1. Then, each of the indicated \u2206l2 ranges includes several inner waves with momenta up to l = 16, 13, and 12 for the cases shown in Figs. 5 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The rest of the waves related to \u2206l2 are surface waves. They have momenta less than the strong absorption momentum lisa = 25.18, 19.01 and 17.16 (corresponding strong absorption radius Risa = 6.29, 6.67 and 6.98 fm) for the cases shown in Figs. 5 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.\nThis indicates that such a refractive effect in the one-nucleon stripping reactions induced by \u03b1-particles on 28Si as the first(second)-order Airy minimum is due to the interference between several inner and surface waves. The impact parameters of these partial waves fall within the range, the upper boundary of which is less than the strong absorption radius."

            "text": "Using the partial-wave representation of the transfer amplitude expressed in terms of the S-matrices for the entrance and exit reaction channels, we have analyzed the angular distributions for the (\u03b1, 3He) and (\u03b1, t) reactions on 28Si populating the ground states of the final nuclei at E\u03b1 = 50\u2013120 MeV, focusing on the detection of Airy minima of various orders. We have used a six-parameter S-matrix model [4] and S-matrix parameters obtained from the analysis of available elastic scattering data for the system in the entrance channel and for the systems adjacent to those in the exit channels.\nWe have clearly identified a nuclear rainbow with a preceding A1 minimum in the differential cross section for 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si at E\u03b1 = 120.0 MeV, A1 and A2 minima in the cross sections for 28Si(\u03b1, 3He)29Si and 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P at E\u03b1 = 64.9 MeV, and only A2 minimum in the cross section for 28Si(\u03b1, t)29P at E\u03b1 = 50.0 MeV.\nThe identified A1 and A2 minima are formed due to the interference between several inner and surface partial waves. The impact parameters of these partial waves are in the range from 1 to 6 fm, whereas the strong absorption radius is somewhat greater than 6 fm. This indicates to what extent the studied transfer reaction cross sections containing Airy minima are sensitive to the interaction in the nuclear interior."
