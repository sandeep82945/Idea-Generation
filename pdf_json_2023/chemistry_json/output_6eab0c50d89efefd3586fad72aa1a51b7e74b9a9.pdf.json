    "abstractText": "Achieving highly transmitting molecular junctions through resonant transport at low bias is key to the next-generation low-power molecular devices. Although, resonant transport in molecular junctions was observed by connecting a molecule between the metal electrodes via chemical anchors by applying a high source-drain bias (> 1V), the conductance was limited to < 0.1 G0, G0 being the quantum of conductance. Here, we report electronic transport measurements by directly connecting a Ferrocene molecule between Au electrodes at the ambient condition in a mechanically controllable break junction setup (MCBJ), revealing a conductance peak at ~ 0.2 G0 in the conductance histogram. A similar experiment was repeated for Ferrocene terminated with amine (-NH2) and cyano (-CN) anchors, where conductance histograms exhibit an extended low conductance feature including the sharp high conductance peak, similar to pristine ferrocene. Statistical analysis of the data along with density functional theory-based transport calculation suggests the possible molecular conformation with a strong hybridization between the Au electrodes and Fe atom of Ferrocene molecule is responsible for a near-perfect transmission in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, leading to the resonant transport at a small applied bias (< 0.5V). Moreover, calculations including Van der Waals/dispersion corrections reveal a covalent like organometallic bonding between Au and the central Fe atom of Ferrocene, having bond energies of ~ 660 meV. Overall, our study not only demonstrates the realization of an air-stable highly transmitting molecular junction, but also provides an important insight about the nature of chemical bonding at the metal/organo-metallic interface.",

Although, resonant transport in molecular junctions was observed by connecting a molecule between the metal electrodes via chemical anchors by applying a high source-drain bias (> 1V), the conductance was limited to < 0.1 G0, G0 being the quantum of conductance. Here, we report electronic transport measurements by directly connecting a Ferrocene molecule between Au electrodes at the ambient condition in a mechanically controllable break junction setup (MCBJ), revealing a conductance peak at ~ 0.2 G0 in the conductance histogram. A similar experiment was repeated for Ferrocene terminated with amine (-NH2) and cyano (-CN) anchors, where conductance histograms exhibit an extended low conductance feature including the sharp high conductance peak, similar to pristine ferrocene. Statistical analysis of the data along with density functional theory-based transport calculation suggests the possible molecular conformation with a strong hybridization between the Au electrodes and Fe atom of Ferrocene molecule is responsible for a near-perfect transmission in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, leading to the resonant transport at a small applied bias (< 0.5V). Moreover, calculations including Van der Waals/dispersion corrections reveal a covalent like organometallic bonding between Au and the central Fe atom of Ferrocene, having bond energies of ~ 660 meV. Overall, our study not only demonstrates the realization of an air-stable highly transmitting molecular junction, but also provides an important insight about the nature of chemical bonding at the metal/organo-metallic interface."

            "text": "The central motivation of molecular electronics is to reduce the size of the conventional electronic components by taking advantage of the quantum mechanical phenomena at the atomic scale, along with the structural versatility of molecules. By adopting the revolutionary idea proposed by Aviram and Ratner1, various experimental techniques2\u201319 were developed to create single-molecule junctions, allowing access to electrical20\u201324, chemical25\u201329, mechanical30\u201332, magnetic33, thermal34\u2013 38 and optical39,40 properties. Typically, various anchoring groups such as thiol (-SH)11,41,42, amine (-NH2)43,44, pyridyl (-PY)11, nitrile (-CN)45, isonitrile (-NC)46,47, carboxylic acid (-COOH)48, nitro (-NO2)49, trimethyltin (-SnMe3)50, fullerene(C60)51,52 are used to connect organic molecules to the metal electrodes to achieve physically stable structure with reliable electronic coupling at the\ninterface. Since the conductance of a single molecule junction is primarily sensitive to the degree of orbital hybridization and energy-offset between the frontier molecular orbitals and the Fermi level of the metal electrodes53,54, the presence of these anchoring group adversely affects the conductance in most of the cases55. With the goal of achieving high conductance, molecular junctions were realized either via direct metal-carbon coupling through molecules like oligocene56, benzene57\u201360 , fullerene54 or through direct Au-C covalent bonding in trimethyl tin (SnMe3)terminated polymethylene chains50. However, at ambient condition, the conductance remains far from the quantum of conductance (G0 = 2e 2/h \u2248 77.6 \u00b5S) mostly due to the off-resonant transport mechanism50,58,61 either through coherent tunneling or via hopping as a result of large energy offset.\nRecently, there are efforts to access the resonant transport regime in biphenyl-porphyrin oligomers (bp-ppo)62, donor-acceptor oligomers based on DPP23 and amine or thiomethyl terminated oligophenyls63. Notably, the resonance could be achieved only by applying a high source drain bias (> 1V) or through a gate voltage in a three-terminal configuration64 at cryogenic temperature. At such a high bias the molecular junction could become unstable due to the Joule heating, or, the characteristics of the junction can be modified by the chemical reaction occurring due to the higher current density65,66. Also, considering the realistic difficulties in fabricating three terminal single molecular devices, it is indeed desirable to reduce the energy off-set by exploring other possibilities of chemical functionalization.\nHere, we focus on ferrocene, a chemically stable molecule at ambient condition, as the primary component of a single molecular device67\u201373. The unique structure of metallocene having a central transition metal at the center was shown to provide near-ballistic spin transport while incorporated between silver electrodes at cryogenic environment74. Despite recent reports on ferrocene or its derivative in molecular junctions69\u201371,75\u201377, the detailed transport mechanism of ferrocene based junction is still elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the charge transport characteristics of a single Au/ferrocene/Au junction via direct metal-molecule coupling, exhibiting a significantly high conductance (~ one quarter of the quantum of conductance) at ambient condition. Density functional theory-based transport calculations suggest that the frontier molecular orbitals (LUMO) lies in close proximity to the metallic Fermi level of the electrodes for a certain orientation of the molecule, providing resonant transport at small applied bias (<0.5V). Further experiment along with the theoretical calculation, considering ferrocene terminated with two anchoring groups (- NH2) and (-CN), display the similar high conductance conformation in addition to the features at the low conductance value, arising due to bonding with the chemical anchors. In general, our study reveals a way to obtain the resonant transport at the low bias regime along with a deeper understanding on the role of the spatial orientation of organometallic molecules on the charge transport mechanism."

            "text": "Typical conductance-distance breaking traces of ferrocene (FC) single molecular junction, connected to Au electrodes, is displayed in the left panel of figure 1b. Conductance plateau at 1 G0 (G0 = 2e 2/h being the quantum of conductance) demonstrates the formation of single atomic contact, i.e., only one Au atom in the narrowest cross section. However, upon further stretching, the conductance has a sudden fall due to the breaking of atomic contact followed by an opening a nanogap due to the snapback effect78,79, leading to additional features below 1.0 G0 when placed\nin a molecular environment. In this case, almost flat conductance plateaus can be observed in the region ~ 0.1-0.4 G0 (figure 1b, left panel) following the post-rupture quantum tunneling features which confirm the successful formation of molecular junctions. Due to the pronounced thermal noise at room temperature, molecular plateaus are not always identical and vary from trace to trace. Thus, to get meaningful conductance value from statistically independent junction configurations, several thousands of traces are analyzed and represented as conductance histogram (1D histogram)\nin the middle panel of figure 1b (for bias voltage, Vbias = 400 mV). Histogram is constructed using 35 bins per decade from 1800 molecular traces. Large counts at or around 1.0 G0 appears due to repetitive formation of Au-atomic junction80. However, a well-defined conductance peak with maximum at (2.20 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10-1 G0 is also evident from the histogram, and it corroborates the most probable conductance value of the Au/ferrocene/Au single molecular junction at room temperature. Since it is technically unachievable to obtain any vibrational fingerprint of the molecule in a notched-wire break junction set up using the conventional techniques like surface\nenhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) or inelastic electronic spectroscopy (IETS) at room temperature, we performed controlled experiment with DCM and found the peak to be completely absent, as shown in Supplementary Information, figure S581. The bias dependent measurement shows an enhancement of the conductance peak by almost a factor of 1.5 when the bias is increased from 20 mV to 400 mV (inset of figure 1b, middle panel; also see Supplementary Information, figure S6 for the histograms at 20 mV and 50 mV bias).To get more insight about the evolution of the molecular junction during stretching, we constructed a 2D conductance-distance density plot in a semi logarithmic scale. The distance or electrode separation was calibrated following the procedure using tunneling experiments82. Right panel of the figure 1b shows the typical 2D histogram of FC, which is generated by compiling the same traces used in the 1D histogram with 80 bins per decade. High density data clouds at or above 1G0, represents the Au atomic junction. A second horizontal data cloud (marked with a black dashed circle) is noticed from 3.00 \u00d7 10-1 G0 to 8.00 \u00d7 10 -2 G0 and interestingly, conductance of the molecular plateaus does not change significantly with the increase of electrode separation, similar to the silver-vanadocene junction reported by Pal et al74."

Histogram of the molecular traces reveals a shallow peak at ~1.2 G0 in addition to the atomic peak at ~ 1.0 G0 , arising possibly due to the formation of precursor configuration prior to the atomic junction in line with the previous reports 83,84. To get a clearer picture about the evolution of the junction, we divide the molecular traces into three different sub-categories based on the presence of plateaus at Gp, GAu and Gm (Case-I), at Gp and Gm (Case-II), at GAu and Gm (Case-III) (conductance values of Gp~1.2 G0, GAu~1.0 G0 and Gm~0.2 G0). Characteristic traces of three different subcategories are shown in figures 2a-c with the inset revealing the possible junction geometries, where L and R denote the left and right electrodes with M as molecule. Figure 2d shows the conditional conductance histogram of the three categories and the pie chart (inset) showing the probability to find the different cases: CaseI [20%], Case-II [13%] and case-III [67%]. From the above analysis, it is obvious that precursor configuration is not a necessary condition to have the molecular junction. In fact, the most possible scenario [Case-III] does not even involve the precursor configuration. Similar precursor configuration was observed for diatomic83,85 and organometallic84 molecule-based junction which primarily occurs when the atomic contact lies in parallel to the molecular junction (shown schematically in the insets of figures 2a and 2b). As a next step, we explore the statistical relationship of these configurations with the help of two dimensional cross-correlation histogram (2DCH) technique, introduced in reference [86] (also see Supplementary Information, section 2d). Using this technique, a map is generated for arbitrary conductance pairs Gi & Gj where the colorscale indicates the sign of the correlation among the conductance pairs (orange and blue represents the positive and negative correlation respectively). Figure 2e shows the 2D cross correlation map of ferrocene (FC) molecular junctions where horizontal and vertical axes correspond to the two conductance, Gi & Gj. Now we consider three different conductance regions: (a) R1- molecular conductance (0.09 - 0.40 G0); (b) R2 - single atomic conductance (0.80 - 1.05 G0) and (c) R3 \u2013 precursor conductance (1.05 - 1.40 G0). In line with the conditional analysis, a positive correlation between the precursor peak (R3) and the molecular peak (R1) is noticed, marked with the black rectangle in figure 2e. However, the correlation between R1 and R2 is negative, marked by the\nwhite rectangle, similar to the observation of Ag-CO-Ag junction83. This observed negative correlation is not an anti-correlation in the presence of these two configurations. Rather, the presence of one plateau restricts the occurrence of other in longer length, as evident from the conditional analysis shown in the Supplementary Information, figure S886. Overall, this combined analysis reestablishes the eventual formation of the precursor configuration in which molecule binds alongside to the atomic contact and opens additional channel which results in an increase of the conductance up to ~ 1.3 G0."

Left panels of figures 3a and 3b, respectively, show the conductance-distance\nbreaking traces of amine-terminated ferrocene (1,1\u2032-bis(aminomethyl)ferrocene, abbreviated as FC-NH2) and cyano-terminated ferrocene (1,1\u2032-dicyanoferrocene, abbreviated as FC-CN) single molecular junctions connected to Au electrodes. In contrast to FC, molecular plateaus of FC-NH2\nand FC-CN have a broad range of conductance values and subsequent plateaus can also appear in a single trace71. Transitions among these plateaus are not always sequential, their order completely arbitrary. Thus, introduction of anchoring group provides more conductance plateaus which signifies the multiple junction geometries. One-dimensional conductance histograms of FC- NH2 and FC-CN molecular junctions are shown in the middle panels of figures 3a and 3b. Histograms are constructed from 5000 molecular traces using 35 bins per decade. Closely looking into the histogram, well defined conductance peaks at (3.57 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 10-1 G0 and (2.47 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10 -1 G0 are observed for FC-NH2 and FC-CN junctions. These conductance values agree well within a factor of two of the conductance peak of pristine FC and from now on, we address the high\nconductance peak as H. Additionally, FC-NH2 and FC-CN reveal a rather broad conductance feature beneath the high conductance peak (H) which can be convoluted into two individual conductance peaks with maxima at (1.21 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10-2 G0 and (2.99 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10 -3 G0 for FCNH2 and at (1.57 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 10 -2 G0 and (5.19 \u00b1 0.22) \u00d7 10 -3 G0 for FC-CN. We refer to these conductance regions as M and L in descending values of conductance. M and L configurations show a trend: FC-CN > FC-NH2 and their conductance values are distributed over two orders of magnitude between ~ 10-2 to 10-4 G0 which hint at the structural variety of geometries due to the easy rotation of FC\u2019s cyclopentadiene rings87. All the conductance values are summarized in Table 1. Representative density plots of FC-NH2 and FC-CN (right panel of figures 3a and 3b respectively) are constructed from the same 5000 traces using 80 bins per decade. A distribution of molecular plateaus over a broad range (as evident from the traces in the left panels of figures 3a and 3b ), along with the slanted data cloud (see right panels of figures 3a and 3b) establishes multiple stable configurations appearing due to the chemical anchors81."

Figures 4a-c display the typical stretching length histogram of FC, FC-NH2 and FC-CN for H (blue), M (red) and L (yellow) conductance regimes. The most probable plateau length is determined by the Gaussian fitting of the distribution (shown by the black dashed line), also summarized in Table 1. Notably, a positive shift in the distribution of M and L configurations compared to the H configuration, suggests that they correspond to a relatively longer conformation. While the larger width of the distribution for M and L configurations (figures 4a-c) illustrates the widespread variation in geometry upon stretching the junction6,88, larger stretching length indicates higher formation stability.

Theoretical calculations and interpretation of experimental results 2.5.1. High conductance feature\nTo gain insight into the origin of measured conductance, we now compare experimental results with detailed DFT - based calculations. First, we consider two possible geometries (parallel and perpendicular orientation of FC with respect to the electrodes) and for each geometry, energies at different distances of the electrodes from the central Fe atom are evaluated. Example coordinate files are provided in the Supplementary Information, Section (j). The scale of the energies for different distances is large compared to the thermal energy accessible to the system (see Supplementary Information, figure S9) and hence, each geometry can be considered stable with respect to the thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, we have also investigated the nature of bonding between the Au-Fe and Au-C for perpendicular and parallel geometries, respectively. Note that the incorporation of van der Waals correction seems to have significant impact on the binding energies for both the geometries. The bond energy was found to be significantly higher, ~ -660 meV for perpendicular and ~ -1610 meV for the parallel geometries, suggesting formation of\nof the corresponding geometries (c-d). The transport windows for perpendicular (c) and parallel (d) geometries are given as filled curves for bias of 1 V (gray) and infinitesimal bias (green), both at 300 K. Transmission functions at different electrode distances d from center of the junction are shown, as well as transmission due to the displayed scattering state (see Supplementary Information for details).\ncovalent bonding (see Supplementary Information, section 4f for details).

The distribution of the left and right reservoir is shifted symmetrically by the bias of the junction. The difference between the Fermi distributions is called the transport window. For conductance to be significant, the overlap of the transmission function and the transport window must be non-negligible. The transmission functions for both geometries are displayed in figures 5c-d. In perpendicular geometry, the transport window overlaps with a resonance for bias of about 1 V but does not overlap significantly for infinitesimal bias. The wavefunction responsible for this resonance (see figure 5a) resembles the LUMO orbital of gas-phase FC, shown in the Supplementary Information, figure S10. In the parallel geometry (figures 5b,d), the resonance of LUMO orbital is shifted further away from the Fermi energy and the transmission peak does not overlap with transport window even for bias of 1V. The resonance also corresponds to a peak in the local density of states on the iron atom, as described in the Supplementary Information, Section (g). The resonant transport in the perpendicular geometry yields relatively high conductance 0.1-0.3 G0 and a stronger bias dependence in contrast to the offresonant parallel geometry having conductance values in the range of 0.02-0.09 G0. See Supplementary Information (Figure S11) for values of conductance at different bias for both the geometries. Comparing the measured conductance along with its strong bias dependence, we suggest that the perpendicular geometry dominates in the ensemble of junctions over the parallel geometry. The observation of high conductance peak in all three molecules along with similar stretching length (figures 4a-c) suggest that it originates primarily from the perpendicular geometry via Au-Fe bond. Additionally, we also explored the effect of ring rotation at a fixed geometry, but the calculated transmission function remains nearly unchanged, as shown in Supplementary Information, figure S12."

By measuring conductance-distance traces for thousands of statistically independent junctions using a mechanically controllable break junction set-up, we observe that pristine Ferrocene binds strongly with the Au electrodes and provides a significant high conductance (~ 0.1-0.3 G0 in the bias range of 20 - 400 mV) in the conductance histogram. The density functional calculations suggest that both perpendicular and parallel orientations of the molecule with respect to electrodes are energetically favorable configurations via covalent-like bonding. Transmission curve for the perpendicular geometry reveals a sharp peak near metallic Fermi level which leads to a conductance value closed to the experimentally observed conductance as well as a stronger bias dependence. Whereas similar calculations in parallel geometry shows a conductance in the range of 0.01 \u2013 0.09 G0 and having a rather weak bias\ndependence. We also observed that the inherent rotation of cyclopentadienyl rings of Ferrocene has negligible impact on the transmission curves. Furthermore, to understand the effect of chemical anchors, we performed similar experiment on ferrocene terminated with two different anchoring groups (-NH2) and (-CN). Both molecules display the high conductance peaks like pristine ferrocene in the conductance histogram, along with additional low conductance features. While the perpendicular geometry with Au facing the Fe atom might be responsible for the high conductance peak, the low conductance feature originate mainly due to the multiple binding geometries with the anchoring groups. Through this study we have not only explored the charge transport mechanism through a single organometallic molecule directly coupled to the metal electrodes via metal-metal chemical bond, but also provide a mechanism to exhibit long-range intramolecular transport which is important for next generation molecular devices working at ambient condition."

The residue was purified by column chromatography in neutral alumina with EtOAc/n-hexane (1/4, v/v) as the eluant to obtain pure 1,1\u2032-dicyanoferrocene (613 mg, 2.6 mmol) as orange powder. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) \u03b4 = 4.82 (t, 4H, HFc, J = 3 Hz), 4.60 (t, 4H, HFc, J = 3 Hz). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz) \u03b4 = 118.3, 73.9, 73.5, 54.7."

            "text": "We choose MCBJ technique to measure the electrical conductance of three organometallic molecular junction, illustrated in figure 1a (abbreviated as: FC \u2013 ferrocene, FC-NH2 \u2013 1,1\u2032- bis(aminomethyl)ferrocene, FC-CN \u2013 1,1\u2032-dicyanoferrocene), at room temperature and ambient condition93,94. A notch is first created on an Au wire (0.1 mm diameter, 99.998%, Alfa aesar) and placed on top of a flexible substrate (Phosphor Bronze) using two component epoxy glue (Stycast 2850 FT with catalyst 9), schematically shown in figure 1a. Upon bending the substrate, the wire is broken from its weak spot creating a sub-nanometer gap which can be controlled using a piezo electric actuator with sub-angstrom precision. Molecules can then be easily trapped between the leads and this process is repeated several times to address many independent configurations. Throughout this breaking/making process, electrical current through the junction is recorded and one complete measurement cycle is called a breaking/making trace. In the conductance-distance measurements, typical moving rate of piezo is 3.2 \u00b5m/s, which translates into an opening and corresponding closing rate for two leads of about 2-4 nm/s (attenuation factor ~ 0.001)95. The set up is capable of measuring a current ~ 1 nA at an applied bias of 1 V. Prior to the experiments, ~ 0.1 mM dichloromethane (DCM ) solution of target molecules is deposited over the suspended part of the unbroken electrodes by means of self-assembly from the solution81."

            "text": "Transport calculations are based on the DFT electronic structure of the ferrocene bound to a pair of Au clusters and NEGF formalism. These are implemented in TURBOMOLE96 package and FHI-AIMS97 package, with NEGF method in aitranss module of FHI-AIMS90. In both cases, we employed a PBE functional98 with dispersion corrections (disp499 in TURBOMOLE or Van der Waals100 and many body dispersion101 in FHI-AIMS). Two different molecular geometries are considered \u2013 perpendicular and parallel geometries, as shown in figure 5. For each geometry, the optimal molecular position for several distances of Au electrodes is considered (see figure S9 in Supplementary Information). Furthermore, dependence on random ad-atoms that break the pyramidal symmetry is investigated and shown to be negligible, see Supplementary Information, Section (h) for details. The basis used is TZVP in TURBOMOLE and tight basis in FHI-AIMS.\nThe transmission function is also calculated for smaller basis set size, showing that the basis set size is converged \u2013 details are given in the Supplementary Information.\n4.6.2. 1,1\u2032-bis(aminomethyl)ferrocene and 1,1\u2032-dicyanoferrocene\nFirst-principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used for electronic structure calculations using Quantum ATK102. This study uses the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (SGGA) of the Perdew - Burke - Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional with double-zeta polarized basis set and a 120 Hartree density mesh cut-off. Geometry optimization for each structure has been performed for forces smaller than 10 meV/\u00c5. The transmission probabilities T(E) of the 2-probe geometry was investigated using the Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism in conjunction with DFT theory. For the transport calculation, a k-point grid of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 134 was used with 134 along the transport direction, as no changes in the transmission was detected beyond that limit.\nAcknowledgements:\nB.

            "text": "In case of break junction experiment, conductance of the junction is measured as a function of electrode separation, starting from few tenths of atom to the breaking of the junction, by a small and constant increment of electrode separation. A complete measurement cycle is called a conductance traces and thousands or even more such traces are collected to look into the junction statistically. Before entering into the next cycle, electrodes are always crashed up to few atoms to delete the memory from previous cycle. In each cycle, junction evolves via series of elastic and plastic deformation leading to a unique configuration, which is beyond to probe experimentally. Thus, statistical analysis of large traces is critically important to identify the most possible scenario. This has been performed by creating conductance histogram1 which presents distribution of conductance values collected from bulk number of traces. Consequently, when junction exhibits constant conductance values with respect to stretching (i.e. conductance plateaus), many values will add up to a small range of conductance and reflected as a peak in the histogram. Peaks in the histogram are fitted to calculate the most probable conductance values.\n(b) 2D conductance-distance histogram and average traces\nAs mentioned earlier, conductance of the junction is recorded as a function of electrode separation. However, conductance histogram provides only the conductance value, ignoring information\nrelated to the conductance in conjugation with electrode separation or distance. 2D conductancedistance histogram2,3 is thus created to check the correlation of conductance and distance in a statistical manner. 2D conductance- distance histogram is constructed by following the way: first a conductance value is assigned for each traces as the origin of the distance axis i.e. zero distance point (for our case it is at 2 G0). Each point in the traces is then contributes to one of the 2D bins of the histogram, defined by conductance and distance from the starting point. The resulting histogram can then be considered as a stack of many traces, placed on top of each other and is helpful to determine the most common feature during stretching. Average traces for a conductance peak is prepared by calculating most probable conductance values in a certain conductance range, defined by the two local minima around the peak. This gives an additional information regarding the evolution of the junction. Linear fitting of the average traces yields the slope, useful to get an intuitive understanding about the metal-molecule coupling.\n(c) Stretching-Length histogram\nStretching length is defined as the difference between two absolute distance values, corresponding to a conductance Gi (= 0.5 G0; our case) to a desired conductance value Gf. In our case, Gf is assigned at the one order of magnitude beneath the most probable conductance value of the corresponding conductance peak. Stretching length histogram is thus presents the distribution of stretching length, obtained from each traces. Most probable stretching length is calculated by Gaussian fitting of the histogram, which is an indicative of the stability of the junction4. Moreover, detailed analysis of stretching length histogram paves the way to quantify the junction formation probability5.\n(d) Correlation analysis\nCorrelation analysis, introduced by the Makk and coworkers6, is an extremely useful tool to detect the several features of junction formation and evolution, which cannot be accessible using conventional conductance histogram. To obtain the statistical relation between different junction configurations having its characteristics conductance value, correlation parameter can be defined as,\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc5b = < \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5f) \u2217 \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5f) >\ud835\udc5f\n\u221a< [\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5f)] 2 >\ud835\udc5f\u2217< [\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5f)] 2 >\ud835\udc5f\nWhere \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5f) and \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5f) are the number of data points in the m th and nth bin of the given trace r. \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5b\u2044 (\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5b\u2044 (\ud835\udc5f) \u2212< \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5b\u2044 (\ud835\udc5f) > is the deviation from the mean value. Let\u2019s discuss the value of\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc5b along with its physical significance(i) \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc5b 0; Configurations are statistically independent. (ii) \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc5b \u2260 0; Configurations are statistically dependent and type of dependency is determined by the sign of the function. Positive values of \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc5b leads to the positive correlation and for these cases configurations either appear or disappear together. Negative value of the function indicate negative correlation and more than average counts in one configuration is supported by the less than average counts in another configuration. It may also happen that formation of one configuration resists the formation of other. Further details about the correlation analysis is described in reference 6. Using this method, a correlation map is drawn for arbitrary conductance pairs Gm and Gn. Two axis corresponds to the two conductance values and color illustrates\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc5b."

            "text": "Figure S9: (a-b) Energy of the extended molecule for different distances of the electrodes from the molecule. For perpendicular geometry (a), no clear minimum is observed for distances around 2.8 \u00c5. However, the molecule occupies a symmetric junction position only for electrodes at this distance or closer. Asymmetric tilting of molecule towards one electrode is illustrated in detail of the junction geometry. For parallel geometry (b), the minimum is observed and the energy dependence is relatively weak. For these positions of electrodes, molecule always forms a symmetric junction.\n(b) Molecular orbitals of free ferrocene\nFerrocene without presence of electrodes has HOMO and LUMO, with HOMO being the dominant transport state.\nFigure S10: (a-b) The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for free ferrocene (a) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the same molecule (b). The LUMO state is present on the ferrocene extended molecule, as shown in figure 5a-b.\n(c) Conductance of perpendicular and parallel geometry with applied voltage\nFigure S11: (a-b) Conductance (nominal, i.e., current divided by voltage) calculated as integral of the transmission function with transport window kernel. For perpendicular geometry (a), the broadening of the transport window by increased bias voltage leads to significant conductance \u2013 the window now encompasses a transmission function peak. For parallel geometry (b), voltage applied would need to be larger to achieve the same conductance as in perpendicular geometry.\n(d) Effect of ring rotation of Cp rings on transmission\nFigure S12: (a) Energy of the extended molecule in parallel geometry for different relative rotations of the cyclopentacene rings (0\u00b0 would represent eclipsed rings). Energy scale is about 40 meV, which is accessible at room temperature. However, the ring rotations have no discernible influence on the shape of transmission function. Hence, only a single relative position of the rings is considered in rest of the text.\n(e) Transmission function of perpendicular and parallel geometry\nFigure S13: (a-b) Transmission functions with varying distance of electrodes from the junction centre in perpendicular (a) and parallel (b) geometries of ferrocene molecular junction. For smaller distance, the transmission increases overall, as the overlap of the orbitals increases. Furthermore, peaks tend to shift towards lower energy as the distance decreases. Calculations for parallel geometry are done in TURBOMOLE, for perpendicular geometry, the calculations are done in FHI-AIMS with exception of calculation at 3.2 \u00c5, which is also done in TURBOMOLE \u2013 hence wee see that main features of the transmission function are same in TURBOMOLE and in FHI-AIMS.\n(f) Influence of Van der Waals correction and nature of adsorption\nWe investigate the bond energy in the following way \u2013 we calculate the DFT total energy of molecule + electrodes system (extended molecule), E|| for parallel geometry (at 4.1 \u00c5) and E\u22a5 for perpendicular geometry (at 2.8 \u00c5) with Van der Waals/dispersion corrections. Then the energy of the same system without the central molecule (electrodes only) E||/\u22a5,E and the energy of the ferrocene molecule alone (in gas phase), Eg are subtracted, resulting in the estimate of bond energy. Same analysis is carried out for the system without Van der Waals/dispersion corrections, using energy of the extended molecule without dispersion E||/\u22a5,N, energy of electrodes without dispersion E||/\u22a5,E,N and energy of gas phase ferrocene without dispersion Eg,N. Results are summarized in Table S1.\nWe can see that at the given distance, the perpendicular geometry is stabilised by Van der Waals interaction \u2013 without it, the bond is not energetically favourable to dissociated state.\nName of the calculation Energy, perpendicular (x = \u22a5) [eV] Energy, parallel (x=||) [eV]\nBond energy with VdW (Ex-Ex,E - Eg) -0.66 -1.61\nBond energy without VdW\n(Ex,N \u2013 Ex,E,N-Eg,N) 0.11 -0.52\nTable S1: Bond energy for the perpendicular and parallel geometries. The used electrode distance is 2.8 \u00c5 for perpendicular and 4.1 \u00c5 for parallel calculations. For perpendicular geometry, FHIAIMS program was used, for parallel geometry, TURBOMOLE program was used.\n(g) Local Density of States on the Iron Ion\nThe local density of states (LDOS) is calculated as a projection of spectral density operator onto the basis of atomic orbitals of a given atom/ion9. For a Green\u2019s function G(E) in the basis of atomic orbitals, local density of states \u03c1(E) for set of chosen orbitals I is given as\n\ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc38) = \u22121\n\ud835\udf0b \u2111\n\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc3c\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc38)\nIn our case, since we claim that the transport occurs through the metal-metal bond in the perpendicular geometry, it is reasonable to investigate the LDOS on the iron ion at the centre of the ferrocene molecule. The calculation is carried out in the AITRANSS program. The resultant LDOS in both parallel and perpendicular geometry is shown in Fig. S14. Compare these results with the transmission curves presented in Fig. 5 in the main text \u2013 the features present in the transmission function are also present in the LDOS.\nFigure S14: The local density of states (LDOS) on the iron ion at the centre of the ferrocene molecule. In the parallel geometry, the LUMO transport state is further away from the Fermi energy than in the perpendicular geometry. The apex-to-iron distance were 2.6 \u00c5 in perpendicular geometry and 4.1 \u00c5 in parallel geometry. The contributions to transport are different from different states, but their location is similar to location of resonances in the transmission curve.\n(h) Stability of Observables \u2013 Basis Set Size and Ad-Atoms\nTwo considerations should be taken into account when determining the convergence behaviour of the observables derived from the ab-initio calculations. Firstly, we should be certain that the basis sets used to represent the molecular orbitals are sufficiently large so that the states (especially the excited states) can be accurately modelled. Secondly, at room temperatures, the surface of the gold electrodes is not perfectly crystalline. We model this by repeating the calculations with randomly placed ad-atoms (see Fig. S16) that simulate deviations from the crystalline order. In Fig. S15, we can compare the results obtained for smaller basis set size and for the same basis set size but including add-atoms with the results obtained in the rest of the text. We can see that in both cases, the changes to both the transmission function and the local density of states are small, on the order of few percent of the magnitude of the respective observables.\nFigure S15: The transmission function (a) and local density of states (b) on the iron ion at the centre of the ferrocene molecule for different basis sets and with the inclusion of add-atoms. Changes to both observables are small \u2013 on the order of few percent. The qualitative results of the ab-initio calculations are therefore numerically (basis) and configurationally (add-atoms) stable.\nFigure S16: The geometries of the parallel (a) and perpendicular (b) junctions with ad-atoms placed on the electrodes. Ad-atoms are gold atoms, here their color is changed to gray to explicitly differentiate them from the regular (crystalline) gold atoms.\n(i) Calculation of transmission function constrained to a single scattering state\nThe transmission function is calculated in the Landauer-Buttiker approach in the AITRANSS package, as described in the main text. This involves derivation of the transmission function as\ntrace of the matrix product of matrices based on NEGFs of the extended molecule. Dropping the (orbital) indices for certain orbitals allows us to see the transmission function without the influence of the orbitals with given indices. Alternatively, all indices except one can be set to zero, leaving us with a single peak, corresponding to non-interfering transport through single orbital. Numerically, this is done by including a masking matrix Mij, which has entries either 1 or 0, with 1 only at indices with orbitals to be considered for transmission, i.e.\n\ud835\udc47 =\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc57\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc50\nwhere the symbols used have the same meaning as given in the AITRANSS package article8 and the summation runs over indices of the non-equilibrium eigen states.\n(j) Coordinates of Converged Junctions\nWe are including the xyz coordinate files of the junctions used for conductance and LDOS calculations in main text.
