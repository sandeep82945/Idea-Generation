    "abstractText": "The hedgehog lattice (HL) is a three-dimensional topological spin texture hosting a periodic array of magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles. It has been studied theoretically for noncentrosymmetric systems with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, but the stability, as well as the magnetic and topological properties, remains elusive in the centrosymmetric case. We here investigate the ground state of an effective spin model with longrange bilinear and biquadratic interactions for a centrosymmetric cubic metal by simulated annealing. We show that our model stabilizes a HL composed of two pairs of leftand right-handed helices, resulting in no net scalar spin chirality, in stark contrast to the noncentrosymmetric case. We find that the HL turns into topologicallytrivial conical states in an applied magnetic field. From the detailed analyses of the constituent spin helices, we clarify that the ellipticity and angles of the helical planes change gradually while increasing the magnetic field. We discuss the results in comparison with the experiments for a centrosymmetric cubic metal SrFeO3.",

            "text": "Magnetic Hedgehog Lattice in a Centrosymmetric Cubic Metal\nShun Okumura1, Satoru Hayami2, Yasuyuki Kato3, and Yukitoshi Motome3 1The Institute for Solid State Physics, the University of Tokyo, Kashiwa 277-8581, Japan\n2Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan 3Department of Applied Physics, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan\nThe hedgehog lattice (HL) is a three-dimensional topological spin texture hosting a periodic array of magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles. It has been studied theoretically for noncentrosymmetric systems with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, but the stability, as well as the magnetic and topological properties, remains elusive in the centrosymmetric case. We here investigate the ground state of an effective spin model with longrange bilinear and biquadratic interactions for a centrosymmetric cubic metal by simulated annealing. We show that our model stabilizes a HL composed of two pairs of left- and right-handed helices, resulting in no net scalar spin chirality, in stark contrast to the noncentrosymmetric case. We find that the HL turns into topologicallytrivial conical states in an applied magnetic field. From the detailed analyses of the constituent spin helices, we clarify that the ellipticity and angles of the helical planes change gradually while increasing the magnetic field. We discuss the results in comparison with the experiments for a centrosymmetric cubic metal SrFeO3.\nMultiple-Q spin textures, which are superpositions of multiple spin density waves or helices, have attracted much attention in condensed matter physics for several decades [1\u2013 10]. Of particular interest are the ones hosting periodic arrays of topological objects, typically exemplified by a twodimensional array of magnetic skyrmions called the skyrmion lattice [5, 7, 8]. The hedgehog lattice (HL) is one of the three-dimensional multiple-Q spin textures given by an array of magnetic hedgehogs and antihedgehogs [11, 12]. The hedgehogs and antihedgehogs can be regarded as magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles, respectively, with respect to the emergent magnetic field arising from the noncoplanar spin configurations through the Berry phase mechanism. The peculiar distribution of the emergent magnetic field in the HL leads to intriguing macroscopic responses, such as the topological Hall and Nernst effects [13\u201317].\nIt has been recognized that an antisymmetric exchange interaction, called the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction [18, 19], plays a crucial role in realizing such multiple-Q spin textures in magnets with noncentrosymmetric crystalline structures [5, 20]. In recent years, however, a new generation of topological spin textures has been discovered even in the centrosymmetric systems. Following theoretical findings of skyrmion lattices stabilized by magnetic frustration in insulators [21, 22] and spin-charge coupling in metals [23, 24], several candidate substances have been discovered [25\u201328]. HLs have also been observed not only in the noncentrosymmetric B20-type compounds MnSixGe1\u2212x [29] but also in the simple cubic perovskite SrFeO3 [30]. While the noncentrosymmetric HLs were studied theoretically for the stabilization mechanism and the magnetic and topological properties [31\u201342], the centrosymmetric ones have not been detailed thus far.\nIn this Letter, we theoretically study HLs in a centrosymmetric cubic system. For an effective spin model with longrange interactions that incorporate the itinerant nature of electrons, we clarify the ground-state phase diagram by using simulated annealing. The model stabilizes a HL composed of four spin helices (4Q-HL) by synergy of bilinear and biquadratic spin interactions. We show that an external magnetic field\ncauses phase transitions from the topological 4Q-HL to three different types of topologically-trivial 4Q conical states (4QC) depending on the model parameters. Analyzing the detailed spin structures of the 4Q-HL and the 4Q-C, we clarify how the constituent spin helices evolve with the magnetic field. We discuss the results in comparison with the noncentrosymmetric case and the experiments for the centrosymmetric cubic metal SrFeO3 [30, 43].\nFollowing the previous study [36], we consider an effective spin model with long-range interactions arising from the itinerant nature of electrons on a simple cubic lattice; we omit the DM-type interaction since we consider a centrosymmetric case in this study. The Hamiltonian is given by [44]\nH = 2 \u2211 \u03b7 [ \u2212JSQ\u03b7 \u00b7 S\u2212Q\u03b7 + K N (SQ\u03b7 \u00b7 S\u2212Q\u03b7 )2 ] \u2212 \u2211 l h \u00b7 Srl ,(1)\nwhere Sq = 1\u221aN \u2211\nl Srl eiq\u00b7rl , Srl represents the spin at site l, rl is the position vector of the site l, and N is the number of spins. The first term denotes the bilinear interaction called the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction [45\u201347]; we set the energy scale as J = 1. The second term is the biquadratic interaction with a positive coupling constant K > 0, which is the most relevant term among the higher-order perturbations with respect to the spin-charge coupling [48\u201350]. The sum is taken for a set of the tetrahedral wave vectors as Q1 = (Q,\u2212Q,\u2212Q), Q2 = (\u2212Q,Q,\u2212Q), Q3 = (\u2212Q,\u2212Q,Q), and Q4 = (Q,Q,Q), following the previous model for the 4Q-HL [36]. The last term in Eq. (1) describes the Zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field h. Note that the energy of the model in Eq. (1) is independent of the field direction because of the absence of the spin anisotropy. In the following calculations, we take h = 1\u221a\n3 (h, h, h) \u2016 Q4, treat the\nspins as classical vectors with |Srl | = 1 for simplicity, and take Q = \u03c0/8 in the system with N = 163 under periodic boundary conditions, for which the finite-size effect is negligible.\nWe study the ground state of the model in Eq. (1) by simulated annealing with gradually reducing temperature from T = 1 to T = 10\u22125 with a condition Tn = 10\u22120.1n, where Tn is the temperature in the nth step. We spend a total of 105 \u2212 106\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n03 04\n2v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 7\nJ un\n2 02\n2\n2 Monte Carlo sweeps during the annealing by using the standard Metropolis algorithm. After annealing at a set of K and h, we increase or decrease K and h successively by \u2206K = 0.02 and \u2206h = 0.05, respectively. At every shift by \u2206K or \u2206h, we heat the system up to T = 10\u22123 and cool it down again to T = 10\u22125 by the same scheme of annealing. Carefully comparing the results by starting from various K and h, we obtain the lowest-energy state at each K and h. To identify the magnetic phases, we calculate the magnetic moment with wave vector q, mq = \u221a S (q)/N, where S (q) is the spin structure factor de-\nfined by S (q) = 1N \u2211\nl,l\u2032 Srl \u00b7 Srl\u2032 eiq\u00b7(rl\u2212rl\u2032 ); mq=0 corresponds to the magnetization per spin. We also compute the number of hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs, Npair = \u2211 j |Qm(r j)|/2, where the sum is taken for the magnetic unit cell, and Qm(r j) is the topological number called the monopole charge [33, 36, 51]; Qm(r j) takes the value of +1 (\u22121) when a (anti)monopole exists in a jth unit cube at r j.\nFigure 1 shows the phase diagram obtained by the simulated annealing. At zero field, the bilinear interaction stabilizes the single-Q helical state (1Q-H) of any Q\u03b7 at K = 0. When introducing K, the double-Q chiral stripe (2Q-CS) appears for 0 < K . 0.13, which is a superposition of a helix and a sinusoid propagating in different directions (any two of Q\u03b7) [52]. For K & 0.13, the system stabilizes the 4Q-HL, whose spin texture is displayed in Fig. 2(a). The spin configuration is composed of a superposition of two pairs of spin helices whose amplitudes are the same but helical axes are orthogonal to each other, as approximately given by\nSrl \u221d \u2211 \u03b7=1,4 c\u03b7,l + \u2211 \u03b7=2,3 \u03c7\u03b7\u03be\u03b7s\u03b7,l, \u2211 \u03b7=1,4 \u03c7\u03b7\u03be\u03b7s\u03b7,l, \u2211 \u03b7=2,3 c\u03b7,l  , (2) where c\u03b7,l = cos(Q\u03b7,l), s\u03b7,l = sin(Q\u03b7,l), Q\u03b7,l = Q\u03b7 \u00b7 rl + \u03d5\u03b7 with the phase degrees of freedom \u03d5\u03b7, \u03be\u03b7 represents the ellipticity of each helical plane (0 < \u03be\u03b7 < 1), and the chirality of each helix, \u03c7\u03b7, takes a value of +1 or \u22121 for a right- or left-handed helix; any combinations of \u03b7 are allowed, and any global spin rotation is also allowed. We find that \u03be\u03b7 is common to the four components and the value decreases with increasing K. We also find that the values of \u03c7\u03b7 appear in pairs; we will discuss its implication later. In the example in Fig. 2(a), \u03c7\u03b7 takes \u22121 for \u03b7 = 1, 2 and +1 for \u03b7 = 3, 4. In addition, we note that \u2211 \u03b7 \u03d5\u03b7 = \u03c0/3 [53]. Similar to the noncentrosymmetric case [36], this 4Q-HL state accommodates eight pairs of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs, i.e., Npair = 8, forming two interpenetrating body-centered-cubic structures, as shown in Fig. 2(a). We note that the phase boundary between the 2QCS and 4Q-HL locates at lower K than the previous result in the absence of the DM-type interaction obtained by variational calculations [36, 44].\nBy applying the magnetic field h, the 4Q-HL exhibits phase transitions to several topologically trivial states without hedgehogs and antihedgehogs, as shown in Fig. 1: three types of the quadruple-Q conical states (4Q-C I, II, and III), the single-Q conical state (1Q-C) generated by spin canting from the 1Q-H at K = h = 0, and the forced ferromagnetic\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nh\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nK\n4Q-HL 4Q-C I\nFFM 4Q-C III\n4Q-C II\n2Q-CS 1Q-C 1Q-H\nFIG. 1. Phase diagram of the model in Eq. (1) for the magnetic field h and the biquadratic interaction K. 4Q-HL, 4Q-C I\u2013III, 2Q-CS, 1Q-H, 1Q-C, and FFM represent the 4Q hedgehog lattice, the three different 4Q conical states, the 2Q chiral stripe, the 1Q helical state, the 1Q conical state, and the forced ferromagnetic state, respectively.\nstate (FFM) for h > 2. The typical spin configuration in each phase including the 2Q-CS is displayed in Figs. 2(b)\u20132(f) (except for the FFM). All the above states are described by a superposition of helices and sinusoids in a unified form as\nSrl \u221d \u2211 \u03b7 a\u03b7 [ c\u03b7,le1 + \u03c7\u03b7s\u03b7,le2 ] + \u2211 \u03b7 b\u03b7s\u03b7,l + m  e0, (3) where e0 is the unit vector parallel to the field direction, e1 and e2 are the other unit vectors satisfying e0 = e1\u00d7e2, and m is the uniform magnetization; a\u03b7 and b\u03b7 are amplitudes of the helices and sinusoids, respectively. The 4Q-C I in Fig. 2(b) is given by a superposition of four helices with the same amplitudes, namely, \u2200a\u03b7 = a , 0 and \u2200b\u03b7 = 0, whose chirality are paired in two similar to the 4Q-HL; \u03c71,2 = \u22121 and \u03c73,4 = +1 in Fig. 2(b). Meanwhile, the 4Q-C II in Fig. 2(c) consists of two helices with different amplitudes and two sinusoids with the same amplitudes, namely, 0 < a1 < b2 = b3 < a4 and the other a\u03b7 and b\u03b7 are zero, and the two helices have opposite chirality [\u03c71 = +1 and \u03c74 = \u22121 in Fig. 2(c)]. The 4Q-C III in Fig. 2(d) is composed of a helix and three sinusoids with 0 < b1 = b2 = b3 < a4 and \u03c74 is either +1 or \u22121. Finally, the 1Q-C in Fig. 2(e) and the 2Q-CS in Fig. 2(f) are characterized by a4 = 1 and 0 < b3 < a4, respectively; \u03c74 is also either +1 or \u22121 in both cases. In the 4Q-C I\u2013III, 1Q-C, and 2Q-CS, all the helices are perfectly circular (\u03be\u03b7 = 1) with the helical axes parallel to the field direction, and all the sinusoids oscillate in the field direction. Note that for all the above states any combinations of \u03b7 are energetically degenerate in the current isotropic model.\nFigure 3 shows the magnetic field dependences of Npair and\nmq at three different values of K. At K = 0.3 in Fig. 3(a), the 4Q-HL with Npair = 8 turns into the 4Q-C I with Npair = 0 at h ' 0.675. The magnetization mq=0 increases with h and jumps at h ' 0.675, while mQ\u03b7 decrease equally and also jump at h ' 0.675. These indicate that the phase transition is of the first order. Meanwhile, at K = 0.14 in Fig. 3(b), the 4Q-HL turns into the 4Q-C II with a similar change of Npair at h ' 0.425, and the 4Q-C II changes into the 4Q-C III at h ' 0.525. Both are first-order transitions resulting from the changes of the types of constituent waves; see Figs. 2(a), 2(c) and 2(d). While further increasing h, the 4Q-C III turns into the 1Q-C at h ' 0.625, with continuous changes mQ\u03b7,4 \u2192 0, namely, b\u03b7,4 \u2192 0 in Eq. (3). At K = 0.06 in Fig. 3(c), the 2QCS turns into the 1Q-C at h ' 0.425 with vanishing sinusoidal component mQ\u03b7,4 \u2192 0, namely, b\u03b7,4 \u2192 0 in Eq. (3). In all the cases, the transitions to the FFM at h = 2 are continuous.\nLet us closely look into the field dependence of the magnetic structure of the 4Q-HL, focusing on the case with K = 0.3. Using the spin configurations obtained by simulated annealing, we obtain the ellipticity of each helical plane \u03be\u03b7 and the direction of the helical axis u0\u03b7 (|u0\u03b7| = 1) [54]. Figure 4(a) shows the changes of \u03be\u03b7 and the angles between the helical axes and the field direction, \u03b8h\u03b7 = arccos ( u0\u03b7 \u00b7 e0 ) . We find that, while increasing h, all \u03be\u03b7 increase equally and jump to 1 (perfectly circular) at the first-order transition to the 4Q-C I at h ' 0.675. Meanwhile, \u03b8\u03b7 are grouped into two: \u03b8h1 and \u03b8h2 increase gradually from \u223c 3\u03c04 with h and jump to \u03c0 at h ' 0.675, while \u03b8h3 and \u03b8 h 4 decrease from \u223c \u03c0 4 and finally vanish. This indicates that the helical axes for \u03b7 = 3, 4 (1, 2) are gradually tilted to (away from) the magnetic field direction, and become (anti)parallel to the magnetic field at the first-order transition.\nFigure 4(b) shows the relative angles between the helical\naxes, \u03b8\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 = arccos ( u0\u03b7 \u00b7 u0\u03b7\u2032 ) . We find that \u03b812 = \u03b834 = \u03b813 = \u03b824 = \u03c0 2 at zero field: the corresponding u 0 \u03b7 are orthogonal to each other. While increasing h, these \u03b8\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 change gradually in pairs, and finally, \u03b812 and \u03b834 (\u03b813 and \u03b824) become 0 (\u03c0): u01 and u02, u 0 3 and u 0 4 (u 0 1 and u 0 3, u 0 2 and u 0 4) become (anti)parallel in the 4Q-I phase for h & 0.675. Interestingly, \u03b814 = \u03b823 = \u03c0 for all h; namely the helical axis u01(2) is always antiparallel to u04(3). This indicates that the chirality \u03c71(2) has the opposite sign to \u03c74(3): the right-handed and left-handed helices appear in pairs. Therefore, the net scalar spin chirality is always zero, even in an applied magnetic field, suggesting no topological Hall effect. We confirm it by directly computing the scalar spin chirality. Furthermore, we find no movement of the hedgehogs and antihedgehogs by the magnetic field, and hence, no topological transition due to their pair annihilation. These aspects are in stark contrast to the noncentrosymmetric cases with the DM interaction [36].\nFinally, let us discuss our results in comparison with the experimental data for SrFeO3. This material has a centrosymmetric cubic lattice and exhibits not only a single-Q helical state [55\u201357] but also multiple-Q magnetic phases [30, 43, 58]. The 4Q-HL in our results for large K appears to be related with the quadruple-Q phase in SrFeO3 at finite temperature [30], considering that the biquadratic interaction K can be effectively enhanced by raising temperature [59, 60]. The field-induced transition from the 4Q-HL to the 1Q-C in Fig. 3(b) is also consistent with the experimental observation [30]. In addition, the 2Q-CS in the small-K region appears to be relevant to the double-Q phase in SrFeO3 at low temperature [30, 61], which changes into the single-Q phase [62, 63] with decreasing the magnetic moments not parallel to the magnetic field similarly to the result in Fig. 3(c).\n4\nHowever, our results suggest no topological Hall effect, in contrast to the experiments, in both double- and quadrupleQ phases in SrFeO3 [43, 64]. We speculate that the discrepancy can be reconciled, for instance, by introducing magnetic anisotropy that differentiates the amplitudes, angles, and ellipticity of helical planes [37, 38]; we will discuss the effects of cubic single-ion anisotropy elsewhere.\nIn summary, we have numerically demonstrated that the synergy between the long-range bilinear and biquadratic interactions leads to a variety of multiple-Q spin textures, including the 4Q-HL, even in a centrosymmetric system. We showed that the 4Q-HL at zero field consists of two pairs of elliptically distorted spin helices whose helical axes are orthogonal to each other, while the angles and ellipticity are changed gradually by the external magnetic field before entering the 4Q-C. We also found that one of the 4Q-C states consists of four spin helices like the 4Q-HL, whereas the rest two are composed of mixtures of helices and sinusoids. These behaviors of the 4Q-HL and 4Q-C states in the magnetic field are qualitatively different from those in the noncentrosymmetric systems in the presence of the DM interaction [36]. Notably, we found that our centrosymmetric model exhibits no\nnet scalar spin chirality, which is a source of the topological effect. While we have studied the ground state only, it is important to study the effects of temperature [38] and magnetic anisotropy for understanding of the experiments. It is also an interesting issue to explore characteristic phenomena in the centrosymmetric HL, such as magnetic excitations [41], transport, and optical responses.\nWe would like to thank K.
