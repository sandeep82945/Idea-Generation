    "abstractText": "The photoluminescence of modified spiropyran on solid surfaces is poor, and the fluorescence intensity of its MC form is weak, which affects its application in the field of sensing. In this work, a PMMA layer containing Au nanoparticles and a spiropyran monomolecular layer are coated on the surface of a PDMS substrate with inverted micro-pyramids successively by means of interface assembly and soft lithography, and the overall structure is similar to insect compound eyes. The anti-reflection effect of the bioinspired structure, the SPR (surface plasmon resonance) effect of the Au nanoparticles and the anti-NRET (non-radiation energy transfer) effect of the PMMA isolation layer raise the fluorescence enhancement factor of the composite substrate vs. the surface MC form of spiropyran to 5.06. In the process of metal ion detection, the composite substrate can achieve both colorimetric and fluorescence response, and the detection limit for Zn2+ can reach 0.281 \u03bcM. However, at the same time, the lack of the ability to recognize specific metal ions is expected to be further improved by the modification of spiropyran.",

            "text": "Spiropyrans have attracted much attention because of their ability to bind various metal ions and provide a unique spectral response to each metal ion [1\u20133]. As a typical representative of a photochromic molecule, spiropyran can convert to the colored merocyanine (MC) form due to C-O bond breaking under UV light induction and can return to its colorless initial state (SP) through a ring-closure reaction under visible light or heating stimulation [4]. The negatively charged phenoxy group in MC can provide complex sites for metal ions, causing the absorption spectrum and fluorescence spectrum of spiropyran to change when spiropyran interacts with metal ions [5,6]. As a result, spiropyran can be used in colorimetry and fluorescence sensing for metal ions. However, the spiropyran molecule has some shortcomings, such as easy photodegradation leading to poor fatigue resistance [7,8], easy aggregation of the MC form leading to weak fluorescence and inability to undergo the ring-closure reaction [9], which limit its practical application in the field of sensing. An effective way to solve these problems is to immobilize spiropyran on other supports (polymer chains, nanoparticles, etc.) through covalent bonds [10,11]. The supports will affect the switching dynamics of spiropyran to a large extent, avoid spiropyran aggregation and improve its photostability [12], switchability and processability. According to the dispersed form of spiropyran, the immobilization modes can be divided into two types: The first type is to copolymerize spiropyran monomers with other monomers to form a copolymer. For example, Locklin et al. prepared copolymers of methacrylated spiropyran\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3746. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16103746 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3746 2 of 13\nand methyl methacrylate by atom transfer radical polymerization. The ester group on the main chain of the polymer served as an additional coordinative group for metal ions, and the copolymer showed a unique colorimetric response to different metal ions including Cu2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ [13]. However, the dense polymer network not only prolongs the ring-opening response time of spiropyran but also makes it difficult for metal ions to desorb from the polymer system, which is bad for cyclic performance. The second type is to fix spiropyran on the surface of the support by interface modification. For example, Maclachlan et al. modified spiropyran on a chiral nematic mesoporous organosilica (CNMO) surface with the help of an aminosilylation reagent. The mesoporous properties of the substrate provided a large number of attachment sites for spiropyran. As a result, the substrate exhibited excellent photochromic properties and colorimetric responses to Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Sn2+ [14]. However, spiropyrans modified on the surface of the support are usually in monomolecular layer forms, and their colorimetric or fluorescence sensing signals are weak. Thus far, trace detection of metal ions cannot be realized by using modified spiropyran on a substrate. Therefore, improving the spectral responsiveness of modified spiropyran on the support surface is the key to expand the application of spiropyran in metal ion sensing. In our previous work, a Siph/TiO2/PMMA-SP/Au@SiO2 substrate was fabricated and the fluorescence of spiropyran was effectively enhanced [15]. Introducing noble metal nanoparticles such as Au nanoparticles (AuNRs) into spiropyran-based systems has attracted a great deal of interest in optical and plasmonic devices. There is exciton\u2013 plasmon coupling between the spiropyran molecules and the Au nanoparticles, which will enhance the fluorescence of spiropyran. Meanwhile, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak will shift with the photoswitching of spiropyran molecules [16]. What is more, the high absorptivity of AuNRs to UV light could improve the SP-to-MC conversion for spiropyran [17]. For example, Mahdavian et al. show that the conjugation of the MC form of spiropyran with Au nanoparticles enhanced the photogeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18]. Here, spiropyrans are modified onto the surface of a PMMA membrane containing Au nanoparticles. The support below the PMMA is PDMS with a micron-scale inverted pyramid structure, and the whole structure is defined as PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP. The PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP has a structure similar to the compound eyes of insects, and its large specific surface area and low reflectivity can provide more attachment sites and higher light absorption efficiency for spiropyran, which is helpful to improve the fluorescence intensity of the open-ring MC form of spiropyran. In the meantime, the electromagnetic field effect of Au nanoparticles can further enhance the fluorescence intensity of MC [19,20]. Compared with our previous work [15], the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate is more flexible, and its original color is white, while the color of the Siph/TiO2/PMMA-SP/Au@SiO2 substrate was black. The white color of the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP will not influence the visual identification of metal ions. The novel PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate was successfully applied to detect trace amounts of metal ions."

After that, the mixture of PDMS prepolymer and curing agent was poured on the hydrophobic-treated Si template and cured at 68 \u25e6C for 3 h [25,26]. After curing, the PDMS was cooled to room temperature and peeled off to obtain a PDMS substrate with inverted micro-pyramids. Fabrication of the PDMS/PMMA-Au substrate: First, a 20 mL aqueous solution of chloroauric acid (0.01 wt%) was added to a round-bottomed flask and boiled under stirring and reflux. Then, a 0.14 mL aqueous solution of sodium citrate (1 wt%) was quickly added to the boiling solution, and the solution continued to boil for 30 min. The solution was then cooled to room temperature and centrifuged to obtain Au nanoparticles [15]. Subsequently, 0.0455 g of PMMA was dissolved in 20 g of dichloromethane, and 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 g of Au nanoparticles was added into the above solution.

            "text": "The fabrication process of the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate is shown in Figure 1. Firstly, a Si substrate containing micro-pyramid arrays was obtained by alkali anisotropic etching on a planar Si surface based on the much lower etching rate of plane (111) than plane (100) of monocrystalline Si in KOH solution [27]. The average height of the micropyramid was 5 \u00b5m, and the angle between the side and the plane was about 54.7\u25e6, as shown in Figure 2a,d. Then, the mixture of PDMS prepolymer and curing agent was poured on the Si substrate surface, and the PDMS substrate with inverted pyramid structure was obtained after curing. As shown in Figure 2b,e, the inverted micro-pyramids on the surface of the PDMS complemented the pyramid structure on the Si substrate surface, indicating that the PDMS substrate was successfully impressed with the Si substrate. Compared with the planar structure, this kind of PDMS substrate not only has a larger specific surface area but also has excellent anti-reflection ability, which is beneficial to improve the absorption efficiency of light and enhance the isomerization efficiency and excitation efficiency of spiropyran. After that, PMMA films containing Au nanoparticles were coated on the surface of PDMS. The PMMA, as a dielectric layer, could effectively reduce the probability of direct contact between Au nanoparticles and spiropyran molecules and reduce the non-radiative energy transfer between Au and spiropyran molecules [28\u201330]. In addition, tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane (TBDS) was modified on the surface of PMMA by reaction of the Si-Cl bond and the hydroxyl group. The modification of TBDS containing rigid groups onto the surface of PMMA could increase the distance between spiropyran molecules, providing enough free space for the isomerization of spiropyran [31]. Finally, (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (ATMS) was modified on the free sites of the PMMA surface by reaction of the Si-OCH3 bond and the hydroxyl group. The decoration of spiropyran on the substrate was achieved by the reaction of the carboxyl group on SP-COOH with the amino group of ATMS modified onto the PMMA surface [14].

shows the variation of the surface contact angle during sample preparation. Both PDMS and PMMA are hydrophobic polymers, so the contact angle of the PDMS substrate and the PDMS/PMMA-Au substrate surface was about 120\u25e6 without obvious change. After being treated with oxygen plasma, a large number of hydroxyl groups were generated on the surface of PDMS/PMMA-Au, and the contact angle reached 30\u25e6. The substrate showed a certain hydrophilicity. After TBDS modification, the contact angle of the PDMS/PMMA-Au surface reached 106.1\u25e6. This is because the modified TBDS contains a large number of benzene rings, which makes the surface of the sample show a certain hydrophobicity. After grafting with ATMS, the contact angle of the substrate surface decreased to 60.4\u25e6, which is due to the large number of amino groups in ATMS, making the substrate surface hydrophilic. When spiropyran was grafted to the substrate surface through the react on of the amino grou and the carboxyl group, the contact angle reached 103.4\u25e6, because the closed-ring SP form of spiropyran is hydrophobic. Finally, under UV irradiation, the spiropyran grafted on the substrate isomerized to the zwitterionic MC form, showing a hydrophilic property, so the contact angle was only 37.0\u25e6 [33]. The change in the contact angle was consistent with the functionalization of the substrate surface in each step, which fully proved the successful preparation of the composite substrate."

Optimization of Au Nanoparticle Concentration\nFirstly, the effect of Au nanoparticles\u2019 concentration on the fluorescence enhancement performance of the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP composite substrate was studied. The composite substrates discussed below were all treated with UV light for 90 s. As shown in Figure 4b, when there were no Au nanoparticles, the fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate was very weak under incident light excitation. The fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate increased with an increase in the concentration of Au nanoparticles, which is caused by the plasmon effect of Au nanoparticles [19]. When the concentration of Au nanoparticles was 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, the fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate reached a larger value, and the corresponding plasmon resonance absorption peak was stronger (Figure 4a).

Optimization of TBDS Addition\nSecondly, the effect of TBDS addition on the fluorescence enhancement performance of the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP composite substrate was studied. The composite substrates discussed below were all treated with UV light for 90 s. As shown in Figure 5, when the additive amount of TBDS was 100 \u00b5L, the transmittance of the composite substrate was lower; that is, the discoloration of spiropyran on the surface of the composite substrate was more obvious, and the fluorescence intensity reached a larger value. This is because the density of TBDS on the surface of the substrate will affect the spacing between spiropyrans and further affect the steric hindrance in the ring-opening isomerization process of spiropyran. When the density of TBDS was too low, the spacing between the spiropyran molecules was too small for their isomerization, resulting in the slow or even impossible ring opening of spiropyran, which led to small changes in the composite substrate\u2019s transmittance and weak fluorescence intensity. However, if the density of TBDS was too high, the amount of spiropyran on the surface of the composite substrate would be reduced, and the change in the transmittance and fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate would be small.\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nand\u00a0the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0plasmon\u00a0resonance\u00a0absorption\u00a0peak\u00a0was\u00a0stronger\u00a0(Figure\u00a04a).\u00a0However,\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0Au\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0continued\u00a0to\u00a0increase,\u00a0the\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0intensity\u00a0 decreased,\u00a0because\u00a0accumulation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Au\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0will\u00a0occur\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0 of\u00a0Au\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0is\u00a0too\u00a0high,\u00a0which\u00a0weakens\u00a0the\u00a0electro agnetic\u00a0field\u00a0effect.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a04.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Absorption\u00a0spectra\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0\nAu\u00a0nanoparticle\u00a0concentrations\u00a0in\u00a0PMMA\u00a0solution\u00a0at\u00a0spin\u00a0coating\u00a0process.\u00a0\n3.3.2.\u00a0Optimization\u00a0of\u00a0TBDS\u00a0Addition\u00a0 Secondly,\u00a0 he\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0TBDS\u00a0addition\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0enhancement\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0 composite\u00a0 substrate\u00a0was\u00a0 studied.\u00a0The\u00a0 composite\u00a0 substrates\u00a0discussed\u00a0below\u00a0were\u00a0all\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a0UV\u00a0light\u00a0for\u00a090\u00a0s.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a05,\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0additive\u00a0 amount\u00a0of\u00a0TBDS\u00a0was\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b5L,\u00a0the\u00a0transmittance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0was\u00a0lower;\u00a0that\u00a0is,\u00a0 the\u00a0discoloration\u00a0of\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0was\u00a0more\u00a0obvious,\u00a0 and\u00a0the\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0intensity\u00a0reached\u00a0a\u00a0larger\u00a0value.\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0because\u00a0the\u00a0density\u00a0of\u00a0TBDS\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0will\u00a0affect\u00a0the\u00a0spacing\u00a0between\u00a0spiropyrans\u00a0and\u00a0further\u00a0affect\u00a0the\u00a0 steric\u00a0hindrance\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0ring-opening\u00a0isomerization\u00a0process\u00a0of\u00a0spiropyran.\u00a0When\u00a0the\u00a0density\u00a0of\u00a0 TBDS\u00a0was\u00a0too\u00a0low,\u00a0the\u00a0spacing\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0molecules\u00a0was\u00a0too\u00a0small\u00a0for\u00a0their\u00a0isomerization,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0slow\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0impossible\u00a0ring\u00a0opening\u00a0of\u00a0spiropyran,\u00a0which\u00a0led\u00a0to\u00a0 small\u00a0changes\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u2019s\u00a0 transmittance\u00a0and\u00a0weak\u00a0 fluorescence\u00a0 intensity.\u00a0 However,\u00a0if\u00a0the\u00a0density\u00a0of\u00a0TBDS\u00a0was\u00a0too\u00a0high,\u00a0the\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0reduced,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0transmittance\u00a0and\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0 intensity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0small.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Transmission\u00a0spectra\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0composite\u00a0\nsubstrates\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0TBDS\u00a0addition\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0preparation\u00a0process.\u00a0\n3.3.3.

The additive amount of ATMS will affect the number of graft sites for spiropyran on the substrate surface. As shown in Figure 6, when the additive amount of ATMS was too small, graft sites on substrate surface were not enough, resulting in low spiropyran grafting amounts, and the characteristic peak of spiropyran in the transmittance spectrum became small and the fluorescence intensity of the substrate was weak. With an increase in ATMS addition, the transmittance of the composite substrate continued to decrease, and the fluorescence intensity gradually increased. The fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate was higher when the additive amount of ATMS was 10 \u00b5L. However, the fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate decreased when the addition of ATMS exceeded 10 \u00b5L, which was because the density of spiropyran was too high, resulting in

ll , the eff t f t i t e orescence enhancement perfor PMMA-Au/SP composite subs rate was stu ied, as shown in Figure 7. The compo ite substrates discussed below were ll trea ed with UV light for 90 s. The grafting time of spiropyran was closely related to the grafting amount of spiropyran on the composite substrate surface. When the grafting time was too short, the number of spiropyran mol cules grafted on the ub trate was les , so the transmission sp ctrum of the composite substrate changed less. With an increase in grafti g time, the transmittance of the composite substrate decr ased, and th fluorescence intensity increased gradually. When the grafting time was 12 h, the transmittance of the composite substrate changed mo t obviously. However, it should be noted that the fluorescence intensity of the composite substrate reached a larg value when grafting time was 3 h and then showed a decreasing trend with a furth r increase in grafting time. This may b due to the aggregation quenching of spiropyran causing by the increase i the dens ty of spir pyran on the substrate when the rafting time was lo ger than 3 h. Here, we ch se a spi opyran grafting time of 3 h as the ptimal c ndition f r the follow-up study because although the transmittance p ak of the composi substrate as 3% low r whe the grafting time increased from 3 h to 12 h, the fluore cence intensity was reduced by about 30%. Here, the compo ite substrate is int nded to be u d for the subsequent trace detection of m tal io s, so excellent fluorescence perfo mance is very import n for the pr ctical application of this substrate.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3746 9 of 13Materials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0

The fluoresc n enha cement mainly came from three asp cts: good anti-reflection ab lity of the inverted pyramid structu e, plasmon resonance effect of Au nanoparticles and low probability f non-radiative energy transfer realized by th PMMA isolation layer. (1) The inverted pyramid structure had excellent anti-reflection ability, which could improve the exc tation efficiency of spiropyra on the substrate surface, and thus improv its fluorescence intensity. To prov this, the flu rescence ntensity f the Psample (PDMS/PMMA-Au/S ) with an inverted pyramid structur and the Fsample without an inverted pyramid structure was compared, as shown in Figure 8a. The fluorescence intensity of the former was 19 times that of the latter, and the enhancement f ctor was as high as 5.06. (2) Au nanoparticle could generate an enhanced local el ctromagnetic fi ld under in ident ligh , so as to prov de more rapid attenuati n channels for spiropyr n on the substrate urface, reduce its fluorescence lif time [35], increase its spontaneous radiation rate and enhance its fluorescence intensity. To prove this, the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP with Au nanoparticles and PDMS/SP without Au nanoparticles ere compared. The fluoresc nce intensity of PDMS/PMMAAu/SP was significantly higher than that of PDMS/SP, and the fluorescence lifetime of PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP was shorter than that of PDMS/SP, as sh wn in Figure 8c,d. In addition, the resonance coupling betw en Au anoparticles and fluorescent molecules could significantly enha ce the fluorescence intensity of the latter, and this enhancement effect reached its maximum when the plasmon resonance peak of the met l nanoparticles overlapped with the absorption or excitati peak of the fluorescent molecules [36]. As shown in Figure 8b, the plasmon resonance abso ption peak of the Au nanoparticles overlap ed with th absorption peak of spi opyran to a high degree, which would significantly improve the excitation effici ncy and r diation rate of spiropyran on the subst ate surface, and thu improve its fluorescence intensi y. (3) The desig of the PMMA isolation lay r reduced the pr bability of non-radiative energy transfer caused by direct conta t between Au and MC, thereby i creasi g the fluo scence inte si y of the substrate. To prove is, the fluor scence intensity and fluorescence lifetime of the substrate containing PMMA (PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP) and the substrate without PMMA (PDMS/Au/SP) were compared, as shown in Figure 8c,d. The fluorescence int nsity of PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP was higher than that of PDMS/Au/SP, and e fluorescence lifetime of PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP was longer than that of PDMS/Au/SP, indicating that there was more electron t ansfer betw en the metal nanoparticles and the spiropyrans on PDMS/Au/SP, which led to the fluorescence quenching of MC.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3746 10 of 13Materials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a08.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0Fluorescence\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0substrate\u00a0without\u00a0 inverted\u00a0pyramid\u00a0structure\u00a0and\u00a0substrate\u00a0 with\u00a0 inverted\u00a0 pyramid\u00a0 structure\u00a0 before\u00a0 and\u00a0 after\u00a0 UV\u00a0 illumination.\u00a0 (b)\u00a0Absorption\u00a0 spectra\u00a0 of\u00a0 PDMS/PMMA-Au\u00a0 (black)\u00a0 and\u00a0MC\u00a0 ethanol\u00a0 solution\u00a0 (red).\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Fluorescence\u00a0 spectra\u00a0 of\u00a0 PDMS/SP\u00a0 (black),\u00a0PDMS/Au/SP\u00a0(red)\u00a0and\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0(blue).\u00a0(d)\u00a0Time-resolved\u00a0emission\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0 PDMS/SP\u00a0(black),\u00a0PDMS/Au/SP\u00a0(blue)\u00a0and\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0(red).\u00a0\n3.5.\u00a0Metal\u00a0Ion\u00a0Detection\u00a0 When\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0isomerizes\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0SP\u00a0form\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0MC\u00a0form\u00a0under\u00a0UV\u00a0irradiation,\u00a0 the\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0and\u00a0colorimetric\u00a0sensing\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0ions\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0realized\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0complexation\u00a0of\u00a0MC\u2019s\u00a0phenoxy\u00a0group\u00a0with\u00a0metal\u00a0ions.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a09a,\u00a0when\u00a0a\u00a010\u22123\u00a0M\u00a0 ethanol\u00a0solution\u00a0of\u00a0Zn2+,\u00a0Ni2+,\u00a0Sn2+\u00a0and\u00a0Cu2+\u00a0was\u00a0added\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PDMS/PMMAAu/SP\u00a0substrate,\u00a0the\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0peak\u00a0of\u00a0MC\u00a0shifted\u00a0from\u00a0620\u00a0nm\u00a0to\u00a0615\u00a0nm,\u00a0610\u00a0nm,\u00a0625\u00a0 nm\u00a0and\u00a0630\u00a0nm\u00a0respectively,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0of\u00a0MC\u00a0was\u00a0obviously\u00a0quenched.\u00a0The\u00a0 fluorescence\u00a0intensity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0was\u00a0linear\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0 ions.\u00a0Taking\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0as\u00a0an\u00a0example\u00a0 to\u00a0show\u00a0 the\u00a0ability\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMAAu/SP\u00a0in\u00a0metal\u00a0ion\u00a0sensing,\u00a0the\u00a0reason\u00a0for\u00a0choosing\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0is\u00a0that\u00a0it\u00a0plays\u00a0an\u00a0important\u00a0role\u00a0 in\u00a0many\u00a0physiological\u00a0and\u00a0pathological\u00a0processes,\u00a0and\u00a0identifying\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0is\u00a0of\u00a0great\u00a0theoretical\u00a0and\u00a0practical\u00a0significance.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a09c,\u00a0the\u00a0linear\u00a0analysis\u00a0equation\u00a0of\u00a0 substrate\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0 intensity\u00a0and\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0concentration\u00a0was\u00a0as\u00a0 follows:\u00a0Y\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212307433X\u00a0\u2212\u00a0 319506\u00a0(10\u22121\u00a0M\u00a0~\u00a010\u22126\u00a0M),\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0detection\u00a0limit\u00a0(LOD)\u00a0was\u00a00.281\u00a0\u00b5M\u00a0(LOD\u00a0=\u00a03Sb/S,\u00a0Sb\u00a0=\u00a0 0.08613),\u00a0which\u00a0indicated\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0trace\u00a0detection\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0 ions.\u00a0In\u00a0addition,\u00a0since\u00a0the\u00a0complex\u00a0bond\u00a0formed\u00a0between\u00a0MC\u00a0and\u00a0metal\u00a0ions\u00a0was\u00a0unstable,\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0was\u00a0exposed\u00a0to\u00a0visible\u00a0light,\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0would\u00a0isomerize\u00a0back\u00a0to\u00a0 the\u00a0close-ring\u00a0state\u00a0[37],\u00a0which\u00a0made\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0recyclable.\u00a0The\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0 substrate\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0show\u00a0obvious\u00a0attenuation\u00a0of\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0within\u00a0six\u00a0cycles\u00a0(Figure\u00a09d).\u00a0 Siph/TiO2/PMMA-SP/Au@SiO2,\u00a0reported\u00a0in\u00a0our\u00a0previous\u00a0work,\u00a0showed\u00a0lower\u00a0LOD\u00a0(0.054\u00a0 \u00b5M)\u00a0 to\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0due\u00a0 to\u00a0Au/Ag-coupled\u00a0plasmonic\u00a0resonance,\u00a0but\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0a\u00a0hard\u00a0substrate\u00a0and\u00a0 cannot\u00a0realize\u00a0the\u00a0visual\u00a0identification\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0ions.\u00a0Here,\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0soft\u00a0 substrate\u00a0and\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0detect\u00a0different\u00a0metal\u00a0ions\u00a0by\u00a0colorimetry.\u00a0Figure\u00a09f,e\u00a0show\u00a0the\u00a0real\u00a0\n( ) l rescence spectra of substrate without inverted pyramid structure and substrate ith inverted pyra id structure before and after illu ination.

            "text": "hen spiropyran isomerizes from the SP form to the MC form under UV irradiation, the fluorescence and colorimetric sensing of metal ions can be realized through the complexation of MC\u2019s phenoxy group with metal ions. As shown in Figure 9a, when a 10\u22123 M ethanol solution of Zn2+, Ni2+, Sn2+ and Cu2+ was added to the surface of the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate, the fluorescence peak of MC shifted from 620 nm to 615 nm, 610 n , 625 nm and 630 nm respectively, and the fluorescence of MC was obviously quenched. The fluorescence intensity of the PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate was linear with the concentration of metal ions. Taking Zn2+ as an example to show the ability of PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP in metal ion sensing, the reason for choosing Zn2+ is that it plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes, and identifying Zn2+ is of great theoretical and practical significance. As shown in Figure 9c, the linear analysis equation of substrate fluorescence intensity and Zn2+ concentration was as follows: Y = \u2212307433X \u2212 319506 (10\u22121 M~10\u22126 M), and the detection limit (LOD) was 0.281 \u00b5M (LOD = 3Sb/S, Sb = 0.08613), which indicated that the substrate could be used for the trace detection of metal ions. In addition, since the complex bond formed between MC and metal ions was unstable, when the substrate was exposed to visible light, spiropyran would isomerize back to the close-ring state [37], which made the substrate recyclable. The PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate did not show obvious attenuation of sensitivity within six cycles (Figure 9d). Siph/TiO2/PMMA-SP/Au@SiO2, reported in our previous work, showed lower LOD (0.054 \u00b5M) to Zn2+ due to Au/Ag-coupled plasmonic resonance, but it is a hard substrate and cannot realize the visual identification of metal ions. Here, PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP is a soft substrate and can also detect different metal ions by colorimetry. Figure 9e,f show the real picture and transmission spectra of the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3746 11 of 13\nPDMS/PMMA-Au/SP substrate in response to different metal ions. After UV irradiation for 150 s, spiropyran on the substrate surface isomerized from the colorless SP form to the deep-purple MC form, resulting in an obvious color change of the substrate, which coincided with the transmission spectrum change of the substrate. When MC was complexed with different metal ions, its transmission peak showed an obvious blue shift, resulting in the color change of the substrate. In this way, different metal ions could be distinguished by the naked eye; this visual identification method greatly reduces the cost of ion detection. However, in the mixed solution of several metal ions, this substrate cannot be used for the specific recognition of each ion, which is expected to be further solved by the modification of the spiropyran.\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 11\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\npicture\u00a0and\u00a0transmission\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0different\u00a0metal\u00a0ions.\u00a0After\u00a0UV\u00a0irradiation\u00a0for\u00a0150\u00a0s,\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0surface\u00a0isomerized\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0colorless\u00a0SP\u00a0form\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0deep-purple\u00a0MC\u00a0form,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0obvious\u00a0 color\u00a0change\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0substrate,\u00a0which\u00a0coincided\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0transmission\u00a0spectrum\u00a0change\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0substrate.\u00a0When\u00a0MC\u00a0was\u00a0complexed\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0metal\u00a0ions,\u00a0its\u00a0transmission\u00a0peak\u00a0 showed\u00a0an\u00a0obvious\u00a0blue\u00a0shift,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0color\u00a0change\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0substrate.\u00a0In\u00a0this\u00a0way,\u00a0 different\u00a0metal\u00a0 ions\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0distinguished\u00a0by\u00a0 the\u00a0naked\u00a0eye;\u00a0 this\u00a0visual\u00a0 identification\u00a0 method\u00a0greatly\u00a0reduces\u00a0the\u00a0cost\u00a0of\u00a0ion\u00a0detection.\u00a0However,\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0mixed\u00a0solution\u00a0of\u00a0several\u00a0metal\u00a0ions,\u00a0this\u00a0substrate\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0specific\u00a0recognition\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0ion,\u00a0which\u00a0 is\u00a0expected\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0further\u00a0solved\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0modification\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0spiropyran.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a09.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Fluorescence\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0into\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0\nsolutions\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0metal\u00a0ions\u00a0(10\u22123\u00a0M\u00a0in\u00a0ethanol)\u00a0after\u00a0UV\u00a0irradiation.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Fluorescence\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0\nPDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0into\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0ethanol\u00a0solution\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0\nconcentrations\u00a0after\u00a0UV\u00a0irradiation.\u00a0(c)\u00a0Linear\u00a0plots\u00a0of\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0intensity\u00a0versus\u00a0the\u00a0logarithm\u00a0\nof\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0concentration.\u00a0(d)\u00a0Cycle\u00a0test\u00a0for\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0in\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0detection.\u00a0(e)\u00a0Trans-\nmission\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0into\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0solutions\u00a0of\u00a0dif-\nferent\u00a0metal\u00a0 ions\u00a0 (10\u22123\u00a0M\u00a0 in\u00a0ethanol)\u00a0after\u00a0UV\u00a0 irradiation.\u00a0 (f)\u00a0The\u00a0real\u00a0picture\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-\nAu/SP\u00a0substrate\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0into\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0solutions\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0metal\u00a0ions\u00a0(10\u22123\u00a0M\u00a0in\u00a0ethanol)\u00a0\nafter\u00a0UV\u00a0irradiation.\u00a0\n4.\u00a0Conclusions\u00a0 PDMS\u00a0soft\u00a0substrates\u00a0containing\u00a0 inverted\u00a0pyramid\u00a0microstructures\u00a0were\u00a0prepared\u00a0 by\u00a0 template-impressing\u00a0 techniques,\u00a0 then\u00a0PMMA-Au\u00a0 thin\u00a0films\u00a0were\u00a0assembled\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0 surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0soft\u00a0substrates.\u00a0After\u00a0that,\u00a0a\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0of\u00a0PDMS/PMMA-Au/SP\u00a0 was\u00a0obtained\u00a0by\u00a0modifying\u00a0tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane\u00a0(TBDS)\u00a0and\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0 surface\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0PMMA-Au\u00a0 thin\u00a0films\u00a0by\u00a0covalent\u00a0grafting.\u00a0The\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0was\u00a0 used\u00a0for\u00a0colorimetric\u00a0and\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0sensing\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0ions.\u00a0The\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0enhancement\u00a0factor\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0open-ring\u00a0MC\u00a0form\u00a0of\u00a0spiropyran\u00a0was\u00a0as\u00a0 high\u00a0as\u00a05.06,\u00a0and\u00a0 its\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0detection\u00a0 limit\u00a0 for\u00a0Zn2+\u00a0was\u00a00.281\u00a0\u00b5M.\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0 the\u00a0 color\u00a0transformation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0composite\u00a0substrate\u00a0from\u00a0colorless\u00a0to\u00a0deep\u00a0purple\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0completed\u00a0within\u00a0150\u00a0s,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0visual\u00a0identification\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0ions\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0Zn2+,\u00a0Ni2+,\u00a0Sn2+\u00a0and\u00a0 Cu2+\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0realized.\u00a0"
