The CME source region was an X1.4 flare located at approximately S15W01 on the solar disk as observed from the Earth\u2019s perspective. The position of the CME as derived from the 3D Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) reconstruction method was at around S18W00 at 2.5 solar radii and S07W00 at 5.7 solar radii, meaning that the CME was deflected towards the Equator while propagating outward in the corona. The projected speed of the leading edge of the CME also evolved from around 200 km s\u22121 in the lower corona to around 1000 km s\u22121 in the COR2 field of view. The degree of polarisation of the CME is around 65 % but it can go as high as 80 % in some CME regions. The CME showed deviation of the polarisation angle from the tangential in the range of 10\u25e6 \u2013 15\u25e6 (or more). Our analysis showed that this is mostly due to the fact that the sequence of three polarised images from where the polarised parameters are derived is not taken simultaneously, but at a difference of few seconds in time. In this interval of time, the CME is moving by at least two pixels in the FOV of the instruments and this displacement results in uncertainties in the polarisation parameters (degree of polarisation, polarisation angle, etc.). We propose some steps forward to improve the derivation of the polarisation. This study is important for analysing the future data from instruments with polarisation capabilities.\nKeywords: Corona, K; Corona, Active; polarisation, Optical; Coronal Mass Ejections"

            "text": "The white-light emission of the solar K-corona originates in Thomson-scattering of photospheric light by free electrons in the corona. Detailed description of the Thomson-scattering theory can be found in various articles (see, e.g., Minnaert, 1930; Baumbach, 1938; van de Hulst, 1950; Shklovskii, 1965; Billings, 1966; Inhester, 2015).\nIt is known that the degree of polarisation of Thomson-scattered light by coronal electrons is a sensitive function of the scattering angle between the incident light direction and the direction towards the observer (Billings, 1966). This effect allows us to estimate an effective distance of the coronal scattering volume off the plane of the sky (POS) and it has been employed to obtain 3D position of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from coronagraph images obtained with different polariser orientations (see, e.g., Moran and Davila, 2004; Dere, Wang, and Howard, 2005; Vourlidas and Howard, 2006; Mierla et al., 2009).\nIn a recent study, Floyd and Lamy (2019), taking advantage of the much improved determination of the polarisation of the corona (see, e.g., Lamy et al., 2014) from the LASCO-C2 images (Brueckner et al., 1995), applied the polarisedratio technique to a set of 15 CMEs observed in the time interval from 1998 to 2014. The authors showed that despite the unfavorable conditions affecting the LASCO-C2 polarisation measurements, the polarimetric reconstruction works quite well and is able to produce meaningful 3D CME morphology and direction of propagation. Even in the case of the very fast CME of 18 July 2002 (speed around 2000 km s\u22121), its localization could be obtained from its bulk part.\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 2\nBecause the observed polarised brightness is much less sensitive to stray light, it has been also widely used to estimate the electron density of the average corona and of the total mass of CMEs (see, e.g., Que\u0301merais and Lamy, 2002; Feng et al., 2015; Decraemer, Zhukov, and Van Doorsselaere, 2019). As the estimation of the CME mass and propagation direction has important implications for space weather forecasts it is important to have accurate measurements of the polarisation parameters quantities.\nThe accurate measurements of the polarisation parameters can be checked by the tangential orientation of the polarisation direction. There are limits to this check, both experimental (mirrors may rotate the polarisation (Floyd and Lamy, 2019), atmospheric effects to ground measurements (see Koutchmy et al., 1999), limited precision, etc.), and theoretical (non-random orientation of dust, relativistic electrons (Molodensky, 1973; Kishonkov and Molodenskii, 1975), magnetically sensitive resonant line scattering (see, e.g., Mierla et al., 2011; Qu et al., 2013; Heinzel et al., 2020). In this paper we present the observation of a systematic deviation of the polarisation angle. This deviation occurs near the propagation front of a fast CME. This lead us to the conclusion that we have to account for yet another effect which may lead to rotated polarisation angles. This effect has so far not been considered in the literature. We discuss this effect quantitatively and compare it with possible alternative reasons in the discussion section. The article is structured as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the data, and in Sections 3 and 4 we describe how they are processed and analysed. Discussions and conclusions are presented in Section 5 and 6, respectively."

COR1 is the coronagraph with the innermost field of view of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instrument suite (Howard et al., 2008) onboard the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft (STEREO: see Kaiser et al., 2008). Each of the STEREO/COR1 telescopes has a field of view from 1.4 to 4 solar radii (R ) and observes in a white-light waveband 22.5 nm wide centred at the H\u03b1 line at 656 nm (Thompson and Reginald, 2008).\nLike the COR1, the SECCHI outer field of view coronagraph, COR2, observes the coronal signal in visible light from 2 to 15 R , with a passband from 650 to 750 nm. Both COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs take polarised images at three different polarisation angles at 0\u25e6, 120\u25e6, and 240\u25e6.\nThe COR1 images have a dimension of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels and a pixel size of 15 \u2032\u2032 . The exposure time is one second and the image cadence five minutes. Each set of three polarised images (I0, I120, I240) is taken in approximately 18 seconds (COR1-A) and 24 seconds (COR1-B), with nine seconds between the frames in the case of COR1-A data, and 12 seconds between the frames for COR1-B.\nThe COR2 images have a dimension of 2048\u00d7 2048 pixels and a pixel size of 15 \u2032\u2032 . The exposure time is six seconds and the image cadence one hour. Each set of three polarised images (I0, I120, I240) is taken in approximately 60 seconds with 30 seconds between the frames.\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 3\nOn 12 July 2012 a fast and wide CME (associated with an X1.4 flare) was observed at the East limb on COR-A images, at the West limb in COR-B images and coming from the central disk in LASCO images. The approximate location of the CME source region (the X1.4 flare) was S15W01 as observed from the Earth\u2019s perspective (see, e.g., https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/halo/halo.html and https://solarmonitor.org/index.php?date=20120712&region=11520).\nThe CME was observed first time by COR1 at around 16:00 UT, by COR2 at around 16:40 UT and by LASCO-C2 at around 16:50 UT. COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs observed a structured, three-part CME consisting of a bright circular leading edge, followed by a dark cavity and a bright compact core (see, e.g., Illing and Hundhausen, 1986), while LASCO-C2 and -C3 coronagraphs observed a full-halo CME with apparent angular width of 360\u25e6. A diffuse shock (see, e.g., Vourlidas et al., 2003) was also observed ahead of the leading edge."

The F-corona is the scattering of the light on the dust particles around the Sun (contains Fraunhofer absorption lines). The E-corona is formed from the emission of highly ionised atoms of the solar corona. One more component, the thermal (T-corona) is produced by thermal emission of dust particles heated by the Sun (Shopov et al., 2008).\nThe K-corona contains features like streamers, CMEs, outflows, inflows, etc. In the ideal case we would like to get rid of all the unwanted contribution and keep the signal only from the K-corona, or in our case only from the CME Thomson-scattered light. In order to get rid of the unwanted signal, one can employ different procedures: (i) subtraction of the monthly minimum background from a raw white-light coronagraph image; (ii) subtraction of a pre-event image from a raw white-light coronagraph image (the so-called base-difference image technique); (iii) subtraction of a hourly-minimum background from a raw white-light coronagraph image.\nThese procedures are described in detail in Appendix A. For this study we used base-difference images by subtracting the frame before the CME was observed, at 15:50 UT in COR1 and at 16:09 UT in the COR2 field of view (FOV). Three different pre-event images are used, one each for the three polarisers. Further on if not stated otherwise we will always be using base-difference images.\nThe influence of different backgrounds on our results is discussed in Appendix B.\nIn Figure 1 it is shown an example of one set of three polarised COR1-A images taken on 12 July 2012, 16:35 UT."

Besides the position in space of the structure (streamer, coronal mass ejection, etc.), the effective line-of-sight integration length is also important when deducing the degree of polarisation (Koutchmy, 1972).\nWe have found that the degree of polarisation is around 65 % but it can go as high as 80 % in some CME regions from COR1-A. Floyd and Lamy (2019) showed that for an electron in the POS at 2 R , the polarisation is about 0.8 and increases to nearly 1 at 3 R . These values decrease with increasing angle from the POS.\nSimilar or lower values of the degree of polarisation were observed for coronal streamers. Lamy et al. (2020) by studying polarised LASCO-C2 images showed that the brightest streamers culminate at a peak degree of polarisation of around 0.4 at 2.2 R , at maximum of solar activity. Duerst (1982), by studying the solar eclipse of 16 February 1980, found that the degree of polarisation of the Kcorona is strongly increasing with height in the inner corona and it is almost constant for heights higher than 2 R . Several streamers located in or near the POS have maximum polarisation near 80 %. Koutchmy, Picat, and Dantel (1977), by studying the eclipse of 30 June 1973, found polarisations as high as 60 % in regions associated with coronal streamers. In another solar-eclipse study, Vorobiev et al. (2020) found that the degree of polarisation of the F+K corona (including also the sky) peaks at around 47 % in the equatorial features, at a distance of around 1.5 R .\nAn unexpectedly large degree of polarisation (exceeding the maximum nonrelativistic Thomson scatter value) was observed by a number of authors (Koutchmy and Schatten, 1971; Pepin, 1970; Skomorovsky et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2013). This was attributed by Qu et al. (2013) to the contamination of the scattered whitelight signal by coronal ion emission lines. As the majority of these studies were made during solar eclipses one extra source of contamination may come from the sky polarisation (see Koutchmy et al., 1999). Obviously this is not the case for space data."

These kinds of deviations have been reported only seldom in the literature (Pepin, 1970; Badalyan, 1988; Skomorovsky et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2013) and some results deduced from photographic films/plates are of limited precision and significance (Park et al., 2001; Kim and Popov, 2015), especially when radial neutral filters were not used. Other studies explicitly found no deviation from tangential polarisation within the measurement error (Koutchmy et al., 1993; Filippov, Molodensky, and Koutchmy, 1994; Kim et al., 1996; Kulijanishvili and Kapanadze, 2005; Vorobiev et al., 2020).\nIn the case of a CME-driven shock wave the semi-relativistic electrons can be expected at the front or the flanks of the CME inducing radio emission (type II and type III radio bursts) (see, e.g., Cla\u00dfen and Aurass, 2002; Magdalenic\u0301 et al., 2014). The energies of impulsive electron events near the Sun could be in the range of 1-40 keV (sometimes going down to 0.1 keV) (Reid and Ratcliffe, 2014). A small, e.g. order of 10 % population of high energy electrons is sufficient to produce bursts. For a net rotation of the polarisation angle the contribution of all electrons adds up incoherently. So if there are 10 % beamed high energy electrons their scatter with rotated polarisation adds to the unrotated Thomson background of the other 90 %. This may strongly reduce the observed net rotation. If the electrons are not beamed but just isotropically heated, then each energetic electron in the tail of the distribution may rotate its scatter but if all contributions are added up this results not in a net observable rotation of the polarisation direction but just in a random broadening of the polarisation directions which probably is observed as a slightly reduced polarisation degree.\nSmall relativistic effects may be observed even for an electron energy of 0.03 keV with deviations relative to the non-relativistic limit of a few % for the degree of polarisation and 2 degrees away from the tangential direction for the polarisation angle (Inhester, 2015)."

This implies that the CME signal observed by\nCOR1 may be \u201dcontaminated\u201d with H\u03b1 emission.\nTo investigate potential contribution from H\u03b1 emission, we applied the po-\nlarisation ratio technique on COR1-A data at 16:35. If the H\u03b1 contribution is\nsignificant we should observe low polarisation in the region of our CME (see,\ne.g., Poland and Munro, 1976; Mierla et al., 2011). Instead, from Figure 3 it is\nclear that a high degree of polarisation of order of 0.7 is observed in the CME\nregion. Note also that the H\u03b1 emission is supposed to be observed in the core of\nthe CME, but the deviation from the tangential was most visible in the leading\nedge.\nLet us compare our reasoning with other events. As was pointed out by Floyd\nand Lamy (2019), the Helium D3 line at 587.7 nm, falls right at the center of\nthe LASCO-C2 orange bandpass and it was seen in the core of many three-\npart CMEs imaged by C2. The authors concluded that the prominence material\nembedded in LASCO CMEs is expected to have a maximum polarisation of the\norder of 17 % and a direction somewhat deviating from tangential. The same\nconclusion was derived from another study by Heinzel et al. (2020). In quiescent\nprominences, the polarisation of the He I D3 emission is low, typically 2 % and its direction deviates from tangential by approximately \u00b115\u25e6 (Leroy, Ratier, and Bommier, 1977).\nDolei, Bemporad, and Spadaro (2014), by studying three blobs observed in\nCOR1 images, demonstrated that the H\u03b1 contribution to the total white-light\nintensity observed at the location of the blobs is between 95 and 98 %. They also\nshowed that the H\u03b1 polarised component is of the order of a few percent of the\nH\u03b1 total emission from the blobs.\nMierla et al. (2011) demonstrated that the major part of a CME core emission\n(more than 85 %), is H\u03b1 radiation, and only a small fraction is Thomson-\nscattered light. This results in the reduction of the CME polarisation signal.\nThe CME was associated with a filament eruption, and it was observed by the\nCOR1 instrument.\nThe same was deduced from the eclipse of 2019 with the CATE experiment\n(D. Elmore, private communication). They observed a prominence at NNE limb\nwith polarisation close to zero over the polarised coronal background.\nFor this study EUV images in 304 and 195 A\u030a taken by EUVI and AIA were\ninspected and no filament/prominence was found. Nevertheless, the CME had\na three-part structure with a bright leading edge, followed by a dark cavity\nand a bright core, meaning it was a flux-rope-like ejecta. Such CMEs without\nany associated filaments are often reported in the literature, e.g. Howard et al.\n(2017); Vourlidas et al. (2013). From the 3D reconstruction described above we\nsaw that the two methods, triangulation and polarisation ratio method, yield\nthe same values for the position of the scattering material.\nThus we can conclude that there is no H\u03b1 emission associated with our CME,\ni.e. the signal of the CME is due entirely to the Thomson-scattered light.\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 18"

F-corona contribution is ruled out because it forms a diffuse background and does not vary rapidly in time. The subtraction of the image taken 45 minutes before our image at 16:35 should have removed any F-corona contribution.\nAs shown above, the CME appears at different locations in each polarised image resulting in an error in the measured polarisation. This effect may be taken care of by binning the images. Thernisien, Vourlidas, and Howard (2011) showed that substantial binning of the LASCO-C2 images would be required to suppress the effect, for instance by a factor of about 36 (from the original format of 1024\u00d7 1024 pixels) for a CME traveling at 500 km s\u22121.\nWe performed a similar test with the COR1-A image at 16:35 UT.

In these regions, the original image can have deviation as high as 15\u25e6 or more (see Figure 3). The binned images of 32 \u00d7 32 were too noisy to conclude anything.\nThe degree of polarisation for the binned images behaves in a similar way to the deviation angle images, i.e. the high values (above 0.65) decrease or disappear with the size of the image."

            "text": "In a recent study by Floyd and Lamy (2019), the main limitations the authors encountered when deriving the polarisation parameters of 15 CMEs observed by LASCO-C2 were: i) the contamination of the LASCO-C2 passband filter with the He I D3 line at 587.7 nm. ii) the duration of ten minutes of a LASCOC2 polarisation sequence resulting in the blurring of the polarisation in case of the fast CMEs. The front of fast CMEs appeared at different locations in each polarised image resulting in an error in the measured polarisation. iii) using a pre-event image resulted in artifacts affecting the pB -images of the LASCO-C2 CMEs because traces of underlying coronal structures are interfering with the CME signal.\nIn another study, Lamy et al. (2020), using the newest calibrated LASCOC2 polarised images, analysed the polarised K-corona over the two complete Solar Cycles 23 and 24, and they compare it with a variety of eclipse data taken during the two solar cycles. The agreement with the eclipse data is in general good except for slight discrepancies affecting the innermost part of the C2 field of view.\nTo do this analysis, the authors needed to introduce further corrections to the polarised data: i) the correction for the global transmission of the 0\u25e6 polariser; ii)\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 19\nglobal correction function applied to polarised images; iii) exposure-time equalization of the three polarised images. They showed that errors on the relative global transmission between polarisers and on the individual exposure times of the triplet forming a polarisation sequence have similar effects, which were corrected by an optimization procedure based on imposing a tangential direction to the solar limb of polarisation and minimal dispersion around this direction. They concluded that capability of LASCO-C2 to perform accurate polarimetric measurements is affected by several adverse conditions, prominently the very basic polarisation analyzer system (three Polaroid foils), the optical design with two folding mirrors, and the fluctuations in exposure times.\nA similar study was performed by Lamy et al. (2021), this time with the newest calibrated LASCO-C3 polarised data. They only used two polarisers in this case, because of the degradation of the 0\u25e6 polariser.\nIn the case of internally occulted coronagraphs (like COR1) multiple reflections in the instrument from the direct photospheric light are difficult to avoid. When using an externally occulted instrument simulating a total eclipse (LASCO-C2, COR2, etc.), the photospheric light does not reach the instrument, but several new problems appear as described by Lamy et al. (2020). Some significant improvement was made in the case of the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs by using a rotating single polariser instead of comparing images taken using different polarisers, as done with LASCO-C2. However, in the case of COR1 and COR2 although polarisation images are taken through the same optics, the rotation of the polariser introduces some wobble between the images due to the fact that the front and rear surfaces of the polariser are not exactly parallel. This effect is smaller than a pixel, but the slight misregistration between the three images can produce some spurious polarisation signals at sharp transitions in brightness (see e.g. the analysis of the Comet Lovejoy by Thompson (2015)). This is definitely an issue when analyzing comet data, but is not generally a problem for the solar corona, where the variations in brightness tend to be more gradual. In our case the effect is negligible compared to other sources of uncertainty.\nTo summarise, the causes affecting the polarimetric measurements may be related to i) the instrument design: e.g. the optical design with two folding mirrors as in the case of LASCO-C2; the basic polarisation analyzer system (three Polaroid foils as in LASCO-C2, and one polariser which rotates as in COR). ii) the instrumental operation mode: e.g. the fluctuations in exposure times; the time difference in taking a polarisation sequence (ten minutes for LASCO-C2, a few seconds for COR1 and COR2). iii) the correct extraction of the K-corona signal from other signals (different background subtraction are involved). iv) contamination of the bandpass with emission lines (He I D3 for LASCO-C2 and H\u03b1 for COR1).\nFrom the effects specified above, the one affecting the most our measurements is related to the time span in taking a polarisation sequence. The other effects are minimised by our data pre-processing (with the secchi prep routine), by background subtraction (to keep only the CME K-corona signal - see discussions in Appendix B) and by the type of the observation (CME without any prominence associated, i.e. no emission-line contamination).\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 20"

            "text": "The questions arises of how we can improve polarisation measurements of CMEs. Of course one aspect is low scattered light, but this is not the key aspect since scattered light is subtracted by the pre-event image. Key areas of improvement are the accuracy, hence the technique (three polaroids being the worst) and the speed of the measurements (to \u201dfreeze\u201d the motion of the CMEs).\nThe Solar Orbiter visible light and ultraviolet coronal imager (Metis) (Antonucci et al., 2020) has the technical capability of obtaining polarisation measurements of quality superior to those of LASCO-C2 and COR1 thanks to its electro-optical device, which does not require any mechanical motion. The resulting much faster mode of operation will contribute to the reduction of the time delays between the individual images required to obtain the deviation-angle image.\nOne step forward to improve the derivation of the polarisation parameters was proposed by Vorobiev et al. 2020. The authors used a new polarimetric imaging camera and method: a set of four linear micro-polarisers at 0, 45, 90, and 135\u25e6 put over each \u201dsub-matrix\u201d made of \u201dsuper pixels\u201d of 2\u00d72 assembled on the CCD chip. They could detect polarisation signals as small as 0.3 % and found no strong deviations in the angle of linear polarisation from the tangential direction.\nKoutchmy et al. (2019) also performed such analyses by using a rotating linear Polaroid placed before the entrance lens of F300 mm at F/5.6 and a Canon D60 color CMOS camera of 24 Mpx. Twelve images were recorded at positions consecutively shifted by 15\u25e6, with a precision better than one degree and a cadence of four seconds using the same exposure time 1/8 second. No deviation from the tangential direction was found (at the 1\u25e6 level of precision) after subtracting the sky background as measured over the image of the Moon.\nAmong the next space missions with new polarisation technical developments is BITSE - Balloon-borne Investigation of Temperature and Speed of Electrons in the corona (see Gong, Gopalswamy, and Newmark, 2019). The BITSE\u2019s detector will be able to directly collect polarised light at four different wavelengths: 385.0, 398.7, 410.0, and 423.3 nm. It will measure the coronal average electron temperature using the Grotrian method.\nPUNCH - Polarimeter to UNify the Corona and Heliosphere will also have polarisation capability. It comprises four matched cameras all operating as a \u201dvirtual instrument\u201d to image Thomson-scattered light, from the vantage of four separate spacecraft in Sun-synchronous LEO. PUNCH is the first coronal and solar-wind imager designed specifically to produce three dimensional images from a single vantage point (DeForest et al., 2019).\nThe future externally occulted coronagraph ASPIICS (the Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun), onboard PROBA-3 (the Project for On-Board Autonomy), will be the first spaceborne instrument to image the polarised corona at distances as low as 1.1 R , with low straylight (Lamy et al., 2010; Renotte et al., 2015; Galano et al., 2018). The coronagraph will be equipped with a filter wheel with six positions to choose between three spectral filters and three linear polarisers. ASPIICS will not suffer\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 21\nfrom radial vignetting due to its remote external occulter and it will preserve its image quality throughout its FOV. Nevertheless, due to the usage of a filter wheel there will be limitations because of the non-simultaneity in taking the set of three polarised images."

            "text": "In this work we have used SECCHI/COR1 and COR2 polarised white-light data to study a large and fast CME on 12 July 2012. We used the degree of polarisation to calculate the position of the CME in 3D. We compared it with the position derived from triangulation and forward modelling techniques and we found very good agreement among them. From the study of the CME kinematics we derived projected speeds up to around 1000 km s\u22121. The CME studied here showed deviation of the polarisation angle from the tangential in the range of 10\u2212\u2212 15\u25e6 (or more). Our analysis showed that this is mostly due to the fact that the sequence of three polarised images from which the polarised parameters are derived is not taken simultaneously, but at a difference of few seconds in time. In this interval of time, the CME is moving by at least two pixels in the FOV of the instruments, and this displacement results in uncertainties in the polarisation parameters (degree of polarisation, polarisation angle, etc.).\nWe conclude that the observational effect of the propagation of the CME front through the image combined with non-simultaneous polarisation observations is the most likely reason of the deviation of the polarisation angle from the tangential direction. To our knowledge this effect has not been considered before.\nThis study is important also for analysing future data from instruments with polarisation capabilities.\nAcknowledgments M.

The monthly minimum background is created by taking the minimum in each pixel over a four week period of daily median images. It removes the static K-corona, the F-corona, and the stray light from the images, assuming that the F-corona and the stray light do not change much during one month period. Overall, this procedure works well but it can remove also parts of the stable K-corona (and parts of F-corona and stray light may still be present in the image).\nii) subtraction of a previous image from a raw white-light coronagraph image. This is mostly used for studying K-corona dynamic features like CMEs. One can subtract a pre-event image (the so-called base difference image technique) or the precedent image (the so-called running-difference image technique) in order to keep only the signal from the dynamic feature we are interested in. Nevertheless, static features and the E-corona signal may still be present in the final image. The main assumption here is that the stray-light and F-corona does not vary over few minutes/hours.\niii) subtraction of a hourly-minimum background from a raw white-light coronagraph image. This is also suitable for dynamic features. The background is built by taking the minimum value in each pixel of all images over a time range of 8 hours, centred at the launch time of the CME. As a result, we should obtain the brightness of the CME alone. Nevertheless, static features and the E-corona signal may still be present in the final image.\nWithin the field of view of COR1 the dominant signal is the K-corona (when compared with the F-corona). But because of the COR1 design (no external occulter) the instrumental stray-light is very high.\nFor COR2 (and LASCO) the F-corona is the dominant signal in the images. The instrumental stray-light in COR2 is very low (especially when compared to COR1).\nAs a consequence, the COR1 and COR2 monthly-minimum background images are fundamentally different. The COR1 monthly-minimum background image (subtracted as part of secchi prep) is used to remove instrumental straylight. The COR2 monthly-minimum background images (not removed within secchi prep) are used to remove the F-corona signal.\nIn our study we used different background images for COR1 data. The COR1 monthly-minimum background subtracted images should leave us only with the K-corona signal. If any F-corona signal is left it should be unpolarised in the COR1 FOV and it should not influence the polarisation angle. Nevertheless, it is not guarantee that the full stray-light is removed by this background. On the other side, when using the base-difference images, due to the short time between the two images, any contribution from stray-light and F-corona should be removed. But also part of the stable K-corona is removed, leaving us in theory only with the CME K-corona signal. The hourly-minimum background subtraction, obtained over a time range of 8 hours centred at the launch time of the CME should remove all the unwanted signal and leave us only with the brightness of the CME alone, similar with base-difference images.\nSOLA: fs.tex; 10 June 2022; 0:40; p. 23"

We suspect it is because the stray-light may be still present in these images.\nAs described in Appendix A no one of the above mentioned backgrounds is perfect. Nevertheless, all of them points to the same result: deviation higher than 10\u25e6 of the polarisation angle from tangential, in all pixels where a significant CME excess brightness is observed (see Figure 11)."
