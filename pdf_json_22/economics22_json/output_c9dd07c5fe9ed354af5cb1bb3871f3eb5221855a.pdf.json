This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of tislelizumab versus chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for advanced or metastatic ESCC in China.\nMethods: A partitioned survival model was developed to predict patients\u2019 lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) from the Chinese healthcare payers\u2019 perspective. We extracted efficacy and safety data from the RATIONALE-302 trial and the local cost and resource use data from online databases and published studies. One-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed to explore model uncertainty.\nResults: Compared with chemotherapy, tislelizumab generated a higher cost (US$ 10211.78 vs. US$ 7294.72) but yielded more QALY (0.78 vs. 0.51 QALYs). The ICER for tislelizumab was US$11073.85 per QALY gained. The PSA results indicated that the probability of tislelizumab being economical was 76% under a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 1.5 times per capita GDP ($17915) in China.\nConclusion: Tislelizumab could be a promising cost-effective strategy as the second-line treatment for patients with ESCC compared with chemotherapy in the Chinese setting.\nKEYWORDS\ncost-effectiveness analysis, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, tislelizumab, second-line treatment, China"

            "text": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the commonest malignant tumors associated with distinct morbidity and mortality globally (Sung et al., 2021). The two main histological types of oesophageal cancer include esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (Abnet et al., 2018). Studies indicated that the incidence of EC in Asia and Southern Africa outclassed other regions, with approximately 90% of esophageal cancer patients diagnosed in Asia and 30% in the US and other Western countries. China bears a rather heavy disease burden in the high-risk areas, with more than 3,20,000 esophageal cancer cases occurring in 2020 (Lagergren et al., 2017). (Zhang et al., 2012).\nSince the clinical symptoms of early ESCC are not distinctive, most patients are at an advanced stage when diagnosed with ESCC. Platinum drugs combined with 5- fluorouracil or paclitaxel are recommended as the standard first-line treatment option for advanced or metastatic ESCC. A retrospective study showed that paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TP) results in similar median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) (7.9 months versus 6.5 months) in patients with advanced ESCC. However, such chemotherapeutic regimens\u2019 clinical benefits are limited, with a median overall survival of less than 1 year (Liu et al., 2016).\nIn recent years, Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown outstanding performance in esophageal cancer therapy, which enhances the anti-tumor activity across esophageal cancer. Existing randomized studies that evaluate PD-(L) 1 blockade in the second-line treatment of ESCC patients demonstrate a significant OS improvement in anti-PD-(L) 1 compared with chemotherapy (Kato et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021).\nTislelizumab, a fully humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody specific for human PD-1, is designed to limit antibody-dependent phagocytosis and to minimize binding to FcgR on macrophages (Xu et al., 2020). The RATIONALE-302 trial (NCT03430843), an open-label phase III clinical study covering 512 patients across 11 countries/regions, showed that treating ESCC patients with tislelizumab was associated with longer overall survival (8.6 v 6.3 months), higher objective response rate (20.3% v 9.8%) and a more durable anti-tumor response (7.1 months v 4.0 months). This trial demonstrated a clinically meaningful efficacy and a manageable safety profile of tislelizumab compared with traditional chemotherapy (Shen et al., 2022). Although tislelizumab showed superior clinical benefit, its cost-effectiveness in treating ESCC awaits\nfurther investigation. To this end, this paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of tislelizumab vs. traditional chemotherapy regimens as the second-line treatment for ESCC from the Chinese healthcare payers\u2019 perspective, aiming to inform policy and clinical practice."

As suggested and recognized by the comparative studies, our PartSA model has included three states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death (Figure 1) (Minacori et al., 2015). To evaluate the lifetime impact of treatment on the patients, we simulated until 99% of patients in the tislelizumab group and the chemotherapy group were dead. We used standard survival parametric functions, log-logistic and log-normal, to fit the OS and PFS survival curves. Outputs of the model contain long-term cost, qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER). As suggested by the Guidelines for pharmacoeconomic evaluation in China and comparative studies, we applied a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 1.5 times China\u2019s national per capita GDP (US$17915 per QALY in 2021) to test the cost-effectiveness of second-line tislelizumab (China Market Press, 2020) (Cai D.et al., 2021). The study set a 10-year time horizon with each simulation cycle of 3 weeks, aligning the design of the RATIONALE-302 trial.

The pseudoindividual patient data (IPD) was reconstructed with the recommendation of Guyot and fitted using the standard parametric models in IPDfromKM (Guyot et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2021). We explored Log-normal, Gamma, Weibull, Gompertz, Exponential, Log-logistic, and Generalized gamma functions to fit the curve (Latimer, 2011). The best fitting distribution was selected by the lowest value of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and visual inspection (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S4). As a result, the log-logistic function was used to simulate the OS curves of the two schemes, the log-normal function was used to simulate the PFS curves of tislelizumab, and the generalized gamma function was used to simulate the PFS curves of chemotherapy. All the survival curve simulation results were shown in Table 1."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "This study is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of tislelizumab for ESCC from theChinese healthcare payers\u2019perspective. Due to the high cost of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), it is unclear whether the tislelizumab would be economical for advanced ESCC. Hence, it is crucial to evaluate the effect of tislelizumab in china. We obtained relevant OS and PFS data from a diligently published phase III clinical trial of tislelizumab. The base-case analysis indicated that compared with chemotherapy therapy, the ICER of tislelizumab for second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic ESCC in China was $11073.85/ QALY. According to the results of DSA, the cost of irinotecan and tislelizumab were driving factors of the evaluation. In the PSA, the tislelizumab regimenhad 76%probability of being economical atWTP thresholds of 1.5 times GDP per capita in China, ensuring the economic advantage of tislelizumab and the stability of the model.\nThe current economic evaluation studies on immunotherapy for the second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic ESCC mainly concentrated on three drugs: nivolumab, camrelizumab, and pembrolizumab. Economic evaluations of nivolumab and pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy based on the ATTRACTION-3 and the KEYNOTE-181 trial showed that both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were not economical compared with chemotherapy in China (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2022).\nFIGURE 4 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05\nThe main reason for this disparity is that nivolumab and pembrolizumab are not included in the National Medical Insurance catalogue. For camrelizumab, the economic evidence was inconsistent as its entrance to China\u2019s National Medical Insurance catalogue vastly improved its probability of being costeffective compared with chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic ESCC in China (Cai H. et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).\nThe study is subject to several limitations. First, since the RATIONALE-302 study did not publish utility data, we retrieved utility data from the literature, which might cause a certain degree of bias due to the inconsistency of study participants. However, we conducted the one-way sensitivity analysis of utility values and found that the study ICERs are not sensitive to utility values. Second, the RATIONALE-302 trial did not report the dosing regimen for patients after progression, so we assume that patients on tislelizumab and chemotherapy have the same follow-up regimen and are on the best supportive care. The cost of the best supportive carewas adopted from previous pharmacoeconomics research for Chinese patients with advanced ESCC in 2021 (Cai D.et al., 2021). Third, due to the lack of individual data from the RATIONALE-302 trial, we did not perform a subgroup analysis to demonstrate the heterogeneity of patients\u2019 characteristics. Finally, we did not compare other immunotherapy strategies for the second-line treatment model for ESCC, such as nivolumab (Kato et al., 2019), camrelizumab (Huang et al., 2020), and pembrolizumab (Kojima et al., 2020) as it requires further analysis using network meta-analysis."
