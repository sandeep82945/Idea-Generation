TLC plates were visualized with UV light (254 nm) or KMnO4 stain. Flash chromatography was carried out with 60\u00c5 (particle size 35-70 \u03bcm) normal flash silica gel. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 or 500 MHz spectrometer unless otherwise stated. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in ppm, using the residual solvent peak in CDCl3 ( 1H = 7.26 ppm and 13C = 77.0 ppm) as internal standard, and coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. HRMS were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF instrument using ESI technique. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was carried out using a 200 kV JEOL 2100F microscope, which equips with a Schottky field-emission gun and ultrahigh-resolution pole-piece (Cs=0.5 mm). Bright-field (BF) and High angle annular dark field (HAADF) were acquired simultaneously using Gatan BF and JEOL ADF detectors, respectively, through Gatan DigitalMicrograph. The samples in vials were shaken, in order to have small pieces. Then the samples were dispersed onto Cu TEM supporting grid with holey carbon films without using solvent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the oxidation state of the Cu nanoparticles. All XPS data were processed using Kratos software. XPS spectral data were collected using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer with a monochromatized Al-K\u03b1 source operating at 120W. The binding energies (BE) were scaled with regards to the aliphatic C 1s carbon set to 285.0 eV. The concentration of copper was determined with inductively coupled plasmaoptical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) by Medac Ltd. (UK) on Varian Vista MPZ.\nS3"

Next, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (2.27 mL, 13.0 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 82 \u2103 for 48 h. The suspension was then centrifuged and the crude AmPMCC was washed using soxholated extraction with acetone. After 16h, the resulting AmPMCC was dried under vacuum for 24 h.\nPreparation of the mixed valence Cu(I/II) nanocatalyst Cu-AmP-MCC:[2] To a suspension of AmP-MCC (1.0 g) in pH-adjusted H2O solution (25 ml, pH 9) by the use of 0.1 N LiOH, was added a suspension of copper(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate (Cu(OTf)2, 0.3 g) in deionized water (20 mL, pH 9) at room temperature. After stirring for 24 h, the formed Cu(II)-AmP-MCC with pale-blue color was recovered by centrifugation and was washed with deionized H2O (3 \u00d7 30 mL) and acetone (3 \u00d7 30 mL) by using centrifuge. The washed Cu(II)-AmP-MCC was collected by decantation and dried overnight under vacuum.\nIn the next step, the dry Cu(II)-AmP-MCC was suspended in deionized water (35 mL), and NaBH4 (190.0 mg, 5.0 mmol, 3.7 equiv to copper) in deionized water (15 mL) was added slowly at room temperature. After vigorous stirring for 1 h, the resulting mixed valence Cu(I/II) nanocatalyst Cu-AmP-MCC was recovered by centrifugation and was washed with deionized H2O (3\u00d730 mL) and acetone (3\u00d730 mL) by the use of a centrifuge. The washed Cu-AmP-MCC was collected by decantation, dried for 48 h under vacuum and obtained as dark blue amorphous powder.

The flask was evacuated under vacuum and flushed with argon for three times. To this mixture toluene (10.0 mL) was added, followed by DMEDA (43.1 \u00b5L, 0.40 mmol, 20 mol%) and the alkynyl bromide S2 (2.4 mmol, 1.2 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred under argon at 40 \u00b0C.

The reaction mixture was stirred under argon at 80 \u00b0C. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to rt and centrifuged for 3 min at 10000 rpm. The catalyst was washed with toluene (2 \u00d7 2 mL), H2O (2 \u00d7 2 mL), and acetone (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried for 12 h under vacuum before being used in the next run or for characterizations. The supernatant of toluene was combined for the determination of yield by NMR using 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as the internal standard. The leaching test of the copper nanocatalyst was carried out by ICP-OES analysis of the recovered solution from the 1st run and the amount of copper in the reaction mixture was determined to be <1 ppm.\nS26"
