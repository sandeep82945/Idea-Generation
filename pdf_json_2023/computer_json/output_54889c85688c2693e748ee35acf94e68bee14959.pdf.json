            "text": "16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomics studies typically yield different results, usually attributed 44 to biases in PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes. Here, we introduce Greengenes2 and show 45 that differences in reference phylogeny are more important. By inserting sequences into a 46\nwhole-genome phylogeny, we show that 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic data generated 47 from the same samples agree in principal coordinates space, taxonomy, and in phenotype effect 48 size when analyzed with the same tree. 49 50 Body: 51 Shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S) studies are widely used in 52 microbiome research, but investigators using different methods typically find their results hard to 53 reconcile. This lack of standardization across methods limits the utility of the microbiome for 54 reproducible biomarker discovery. 55 56 A key problem is that whole-genome resources and rRNA resources depend on different 57 taxonomies and phylogenies. For example, Web of Life (WoL) 1 and the Genome Taxonomy 58 Database (GTDB) 2 provide whole-genome trees that cover only a small fraction of known 59 bacteria and archaea, while SILVA 3 and Greengenes 4 are more comprehensive but most often 60 not linked to genome records. 61 62 We reasoned that an iterative approach could yield a single massive reference tree that unifies 63 these different data layers (e.g., genome and 16S rRNA records). We began with a whole-64 genome catalog of 15,953 bacterial and archeal genomes evenly sampled from NCBI, and 65 reconstructed an accurate phylogenomic tree by summarizing evolutionary trajectories of 380 66 global marker genes using the new workflow uDance. This work, namely Web of Life version 2 67 (WoL2), represents a significant upgrade from the previously released WoL1 (10,575 genomes) 68 15. Then, we added 18,356 full-length 16S rRNA sequences from the Living Tree Project 69 January 2022 release 6 ,1,725,274 near-complete 16S rRNA genes from Karst et al. 7 and the 70 EMP500 8, and all full-length 16S rRNA sequences from GTDB r207 to the genome-based 71 backbone with uDance v1.1.0, producing a genome supported phylogeny with 16S rRNA 72\nexplicitly represented. Finally, we inserted 23,113,447 short V4 16S rRNA Deblur v1.1.0 9 73 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Qiita (retrieved Dec. 14, 2021) 10 as well as 74 mitochondria and chloroplast 16S from SILVA v138 using DEPP v0.311. This final step 75 represents ASVs from over 300,000 public and private samples in Qiita including the entirety of 76 the Earth Microbiome Project 12 and American Gut Project/Microsetta 13 (Fig. 1A). Our use of 77 uDance ensured the genome-based relationships are kept fixed and relationships between full-78 length 16S rRNA sequences are inferred. For short fragments, we kept genome and full-length 79 relationships fixed and inserted fragments independently from each other. Following 80 deduplication and quality control on fragment placement, this yielded a tree covering 21,074,442 81 sequences from 31 different Earth Microbiome Project Ontology (EMPO) EMPO_3 82 environments, of which 46.5% of species-level leaves were covered by a complete genome. 83 Taxonomic labels were decorated onto the phylogeny using tax2tree v1.1 4. The input taxonomy 84 for decoration used GTDB r207, combined with the Living Tree Project January 2022 release. 85 Taxonomy was harmonized prioritizing GTDB including preserving the polyphyletic labelings of 86 GTDB (see also Online Methods). Taxonomy will be updated every six months using the latest 87 versions of GTDB and LTP. 88 89 Greengenes2 is much larger than past resources in its phylogenetic coverage, as compared to 90 SILVA (Fig. 1B), Greengenes (Fig. S1A) or GTDB (Fig. S1B). Moreover, because our amplicon 91 library is linked to environments labeled with Earth Microbiome Project Ontology (EMPO) 92 categories, we can easily identify the environments that contain samples that can fill out the 93 tree. Because MAG assembly efforts can only cover abundant taxa, we plotted for each EMPO 94 category the amount of new branch length added to the tree by taxa whose minimum 95 abundance is 1% in each sample (Fig. 1C). The results show which environment types on 96 average will best yield new metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), and also show which 97 environments harbor individual samples that will have a large impact when sequenced. 98\n99\nPast efforts to reconcile 16S and shotgun datasets have led to non-overlapping distributions and 100 only techniques such as Procrustes analysis can even show relationships between the results 101 14. On two large human stool cohorts 13,15 where both 16S and shotgun data were generated on 102 the same samples, we find that Bray-Curtis 16 (non-phylogenetic) ordination fails to reconcile at 103 the feature level (Fig. 1D) and is poor at the genus level (Fig. 1E, S1C). However, UniFrac 17, a 104 phylogenetic method, used with our Greengenes2 tree provides better concordance (Fig. 1F, 105 S1D). To examine applicability of Greengenes2 to non-human environments, we next computed 106 both Bray-Curtis and weighted UniFrac at the feature level on the 16S and shotgun data from 107 the Earth Microbiome Project 8. As with the human data, we observe better concordance with 108 the use of the Greengenes2 phylogeny (Fig. S2), despite limited representation of whole 109 genomes from non-human sources as these environments are not as well characterized in 110 general. 111\n112\nFigure 1. (A) The Greengenes2 phylogeny rendered using Empress 18 with amplicon sequence 113 variant multifurcations collapsed, tip color indicating representation in the American Gut Project 114 (AGP), the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), both or neither, and with the top 20 represented 115 phyla depicted in the outer bar.

(D) Bray-120\nCurtis applied to paired 16S V4 rRNA amplicon sequence variants and whole genome shotgun 121 samples from The Human Diet Microbiome Initiative subset of The Microsetta Initiative. (E) 122 Same data as (D) but computing Bray-Curtis on genus collapsed data. (F) Same data as (D-E) 123 but using weighted UniFrac at the ASV and genome identifier level. 124 125 We also find that the per-sample shotgun and 16S taxonomy relative abundance profiles are 126 concordant even to the species level. We first computed taxonomy profiles for shotgun data 127 using the Woltka pipeline 20. Using a Naive Bayes classifier from q2-feature-classifier v2022.2 21 128 to compare GTDB r207 taxonomy results at each level down to genus against SILVA v138 (Fig. 129 2A) or down to species against Greengenes v13_8 (Fig. 2B), no species-level reconciliation was 130 possible. In contrast, Greengenes2 provided excellent concordance at the genus level (Pearson 131 r=0.85) and good concordance at the species level (Pearson r=0.65) (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the 132 tree is now sufficiently complete that exact matching of 16S ASVs followed by reading the 133 taxonomy off the tree performs even better than the Naive Bayes Classifier (Naive Bayes; 134 Pearson r=0.54 at species, r=0.84 at genus). 135 136 Finally, a critical reason to assign taxonomy is downstream use of biomarkers and indicator 137 taxa. Microbiome science has been described as having a reproducibility crisis 22, but much of 138 this problem stems from incompatible methods 23. We initially used the The Human Diet 139 Microbiome Initiative (THDMI) dataset, which is a multipopulation expansion of The Microsetta 140 Initiative 13 that contains samples with paired 16S and shotgun preparations, to test whether a 141 harmonized resource would provide concordant rankings for the variables that affect the human 142 microbiome similarly. Using Greengenes2, the concordance was good with Bray-Curtis (Fig. 2D; 143 Pearson r2=0.56), better using UniFrac with different phylogenies (SILVA 138 and 144 Greengenes2; Fig S1E; Pearson r2=0.77), and excellent with UniFrac on the same phylogeny 145\n(Fig. 2E; Pearson r2=0.87). We confirmed these results with an additional cohort 15 (Fig. S1FG). 146 Intriguingly, the ranked effect sizes across different cohorts were concordant. 147 148\n149\nFigure 2. (A-C) Per sample taxonomy comparisons between 16S and whole genome shotgun 150 profiles from THDMI. The solid bar depicts the 50th percentile, the dashed lines are 25th and 151 75th percentiles. (A) 16S taxonomy assessed with SILVA 138 using the default q2-feature-152\nclassifier Naive Bayes model (note: SILVA does not annotate at the species level). (B) 16S 153 taxonomy assessment with Greengenes 13_8 using the default q2-feature-classifier Naive 154\nBayes model. (C) 16S taxonomy assessment performed by reading the lineages directly from 155 the phylogeny or through Naive Bayes trained on the V4 regions of the Greengenes2 backbone. 156 (D-E) Effect size calculations performed with Evident on paired 16S and whole genome shotgun 157 samples from THDMI. Calculations performed at maximal resolution, using ASVs for 16S and 158 genome identifiers for shotgun. The data represented here are human gut microbiome samples. 159 The stars denote variables which are drawn out specifically in the plot (e.g., Population), and 160 were arbitrarily selected as comparison points to help highlight differences between panels (D) 161 and (E). (D) Bray-Curtis distances. (E) Weighted normalized UniFrac. 162 163 Taken together, these results show that use of a consistent, integrated taxonomic resource 164 dramatically improves the reproducibility of microbiome studies using different data types, and 165 allows variables of large versus small effect to be reliably recovered in different populations. 166 167 ONLINE METHODS 168 169 Phylogeny construction 170 Web of Life version 2 1 (a tree inferred using genome-wide data) was used as the starting 171 backbone. Full length 16S sequences from the Living Tree Project 6, full length mitochondria 172 and chloroplast from SILVA 138 3, full length 16S from GTDB r207 2, full length 16S from Karst 173 et al 7, and full length 16S from the EMP 500 8 (samples selected and sequenced specifically for 174 Greengenes2) were collected and deduplicated. Sequences were then aligned using UPP 24 175 and gappy sequences with less than 1000bp were removed. The resulting set of 321,210 176 unique sequences were used with uDance v1.1.0 to update the Web of Life 2 (WoL2) backbone. 177 Briefly, uDance updates an existing tree with new sequences and (unlike placement methods) 178 also infers the relationship of existing sequences. uDance has two modes: one that allows 179 updates to the backbone and one that keeps the backbone fixed, where the former mode is 180\nintended for use with whole genomes. In our analyses, we kept the backbone tree (inferred 181 using genomic data) fixed. To extend the genomic tree with 16S data, we identified 13,249 (out 182 of 15,953 total) genomes in the WoL2 backbone tree with at least one 16S copy and used them 183 to train a Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP) model with the weighted 184 average method detailed below to handle multiple copies. We then used DEPP to insert all 16S 185 copies of all genomes into the backbone and measured the distance between the genome 186 position and the 16S position. We removed copies that were placed far further than others, as 187 identified using a 2-means approach with centroids equals to at least 13 branches. We repeated 188 this process in a second round. Then, for every remaining genome, we selected as its 189 representative the copy with the minimum placement error and computing the consensus with 190 ties. At the end, we were left with 12,344 unique 16S sequences across all the WoL2 genomes. 191 For tree inference, uDance used IQ-TREE2 25 in fast tree search with model GTR+\u0393 after 192 removing duplicate sequences. 193 194 Next, we collected 16S V4 ASVs from Qiita 10 using redbiom 26 (query performed December 14, 195 2021) from contexts \u201cDeblur_2021.09-Illumina-16S-V4-90nt-dd6875\u201d, \u201cDeblur_2021.09-Illumina-196 16S-V4-100nt-50b3a2\u201d, \u201cDeblur_2021.09-Illumina-16S-V4-125nt-92f954\u201d, \u201cDeblur_2021.09-197 Illumina-16S-V4-150nt-ac8c0b\u201d, \u201cDeblur_2021.09-Illumina-16S-V4-200nt-0b8b48\u201d, 198 \u201cDeblur_2021.09-Illumina-16S-V4-250nt-8b2bff\u201d and aligned them to the existing 16S alignment 199 of sequences in WoL2 using UPP, setting the maximum alignment subset size to 200 (to help 200 with scalability). The collected 16S V4 ASVs are aligned to the V4 region of the existing 201 \"backbone\" alignments. A DEPP model was then trained on the full length 16S sequences from 202 the backbone. DEPP constructs a Neural network model that embeds sequences in high 203 dimensional spaces such that embedded points resemble the phylogeny in their distances. 204 Such a model then allows insertion of new sequences into a tree using distance-based 205 phylogenetic insertion method APPLES-2 27. The ASVs from redbiom were then inserted into 206\nthe backbone using the trained DEPP model. To enable analyses of large datasets, we used a 207 clustering approach with DEPP: we trained an ensemble of DEPP models corresponding to 208 different parts of the tree and used a classifier to detect the correct subtree. During training, for 209 species with multiple 16S, all the copies are mapped to the same leaf in the backbone tree. To 210 train the DEPP models with multiple sequences mapped to a leaf, each site in the sequences is 211 encoded as a probability vector of four nucleotides across all the copies. 212 213 Integrating the GTDB and Living Tree Project taxonomies 214 GTDB and Living Tree Project are not directly compatible due to differences in their curation. As 215 a result, it is not always possible to map a species from one resource to the other, either 216 because parts of a species lineage are not present, are described using different names, or 217 have an ambiguous association due to polyphyletic taxa in GTDB (e.g., Firmicutes_A, 218 Firmicutes_B, etc, see https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/faq#why-do-some-family-and-higher-rank-219 names-end-with-an-alphabetic-suffix for more detail). We integrated taxonomic data from LTP 220 into GTDB as LTP includes species that are not yet represented in GTDB. Additionally, GTDB is 221 actively curated, while LTP generally uses the NCBI taxonomy. To account for these 222 differences, we first mapped any species that had a perfect species name association and 223 revised its ancestral lineage to match GTDB. Next, we generated lineage rewrite rules using the 224 GTDB record metadata. Specifically, we limited the metadata to records that are GTDB 225 representatives and NCBI type material, and then defined a lineage renaming from the recorded 226 NCBI taxonomy to the GTDB taxonomy. These rewrite rules were applied from most to least 227 specific taxa, and through this mechanism we could revise much of the higher ranks of LTP. We 228 then identified incertae sedis records in LTP that we could not map, removed their lineage 229 strings and did not attempt to provide taxonomy for them, instead opting to rely on downstream 230 taxonomy decoration to resolve their lineages. Next, any record that was ambiguous to map 231 was split into a secondary taxonomy for use in backfilling in the downstream taxonomy 232\ndecoration. Finally, we instrumented numerous consistency checks in the taxonomy through the 233 process to capture inconsistent parents in the taxonomic hierarchy, consistent numbers of ranks 234 in a lineage and ensuring the resulting taxonomy was a strict hierarchy. 235 236 Taxonomy decoration 237 The original tax2tree algorithm was not well suited for a large volume of species level records in 238 the backbone, as the algorithm requires an internal node to place a name. If two species are 239 siblings, the tree would lack a node to contain the species label for both taxa. To account for 240 this, we updated the algorithm to insert \u201cplaceholder\u201d nodes with zero branch length as the 241 parents of backbone records, which could accept these species labels. We further updated 242 tax2tree to operate directly on .jplace data 28, preserving edge numbering of the original edges 243 prior to adding \u201cplaceholder\u201d nodes. To support LTP records which could not be integrated into 244 GTDB, we instrumented a secondary taxonomy mode for tax2tree. Specifically, following the 245 standard decoration, backfilling and name promotion procedures, we determine on a per record 246 basis for the secondary taxonomy what portion of the lineage is missing, and place the missing 247 labels on the placeholder node. We then issue a second round of name promotion using the 248 existing tax2tree methods. 249 250 The actual taxonomy decoration occurs on the backbone tree, which contains only full length 251 16S records, and does not contain the amplicon sequence variants (ASV). This is done as ASV 252 placements are independent, do not modify the backbone, and would substantially increase the 253 computational resources required. After the backbone is decorated, fragment placements from 254 DEPP are resolved using a multifurcation strategy using the balanced-parentheses library 255 (https://github.com/biocore/improved-octo-waddle/). 256 257 Phylogenetic collapse for visualization 258\nWe are unaware of phylogenetic visualization software that can display a tree with over 259 20,000,000 tips. To produce the visualizations in figure 1, we reduced the dimension of the tree 260 by collapsing fragment multifurcations to single nodes, dropping the tree to 522,849 tips. 261 262 MAG target environments 263 A feature table for the 27,015 16S rRNA V4 90nt Earth Microbiome Project samples was 264 obtained from redbiom. The amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were filtered to the overlap of 265 ASVs present in Greengenes2. Any feature with < 1% relative abundance within a sample was 266 removed. The feature table was then rarefied to 1,000 sequences per sample. The amount of 267 novel branch length was then computed, per sample, by summing the branch length of each 268 ASV\u2019s placement edge. The per sample branch length was then normalized by the total tree 269 branch length (excluding length contributed by ASVs). 270 271 Per sample taxonomy correlations 272 All comparisons used the THDMI13 16S and Woltka processed shotgun data. These data were 273 accessed from Qiita study 10317, and filtered the set of features that overlap with Greengenes2 274 using the QIIME 229 q2-greengenes2 plugin. 16S taxonomy was assessed using either a 275 traditional Naive Bayes classifier with q2-feature-classifier and default references from QIIME 2 276 2022.2, or by reading the lineage directly from the phylogeny. To help improve correlation 277 between SILVA and Greengenes2, and Greengenes and Greengenes2, we stripped 278 polyphyletic labelings from those data; we did not strip polyphyletic labels from the phylogenetic 279 taxonomy comparison or the Greengenes2 16S vs. Greengenes2 WGS Naive Bayes 280 comparison. Shotgun taxonomy was determined by the specific observed genome records. 281 Once the 16S taxonomy was assigned, those tables as well as the WGS Woltka WoL version 2 282 table were collapsed at the species, genus, family, order, and class levels. We then computed a 283 minimum relative abundance per sample in the THDMI dataset. In each sample, we removed 284\nany feature, either 16S or WGS, below the per sample minimum (i.e., max(min(16S), 285 min(WGS))), forming a common minimal basis for taxonomy comparison. Following filtering, 286 Pearson correlation was computed per sample using SciPy 30. These correlations were 287 aggregated per 16S taxonomy assignment method, and by each taxonomic rank. The 25th, 50th 288 and 75th percentiles were then plotted with Matplotlib 31. 289 290 Principal coordinates 291 THDMI Deblur 16S and Woltka processed shotgun sequencing data, against WoL version 2, 292 were obtained from Qiita study 10317. Both feature tables were filtered against Greengenes2 293 2022.10, removing any feature not present in the tree. For the genus collapsed plot (figure 1e), 294 both the 16S and WGS data features were collapsed using the same taxonomy. For all three 295 figures, the 16S data were subsampled, with replacement, to 10,000 sequences per sample. 296 The WGS data were subsampled, with replacement, to 1,000,000 sequences per sample. Bray-297 Curtis and Weighted UniFrac, and PCoA were computed using q2-diversity 2022.2. The 298 resulting coordinates were visualized with q2-emperor 32. 299 300 The Earth Microbiome Project \u201cEMP500\u201d 16S and Woltka processed shotgun sequencing data, 301 against WoL version 2, were obtained from Qiita study 13114. Both feature tables were filtered 302 against Greengenes2 2022.10. The 16S data were subsampled, with replacement, to 1,000 303 sequences per sample. The WGS data were subsampled, with replacement, to 50,000 304 sequences per sample. The sequencing depth for WGS data was selected based on Figure S6 305 of Shaffer et al.8 which noted low levels of read recruitment to publicly available whole genomes. 306 Bray-Curtis and Weighted UniFrac, and PCoA were computed using q2-diversity 2022.2. The 307 resulting coordinates were visualized with q2-emperor. 308 309 Effect size calculations 310\nSimilar to principal coordinates, the THDMI data were rarefied to 9,000 and 2,000,000 311 sequences per sample for 16S and WGS respectively. Bray-Curtis and weighted normalized 312 UniFrac were computed on both sets of data. The variables for THDMI were subset to those 313 with at least two category values having more than 50 samples. For UniFrac with SILVA, figure 314 S1E, we performed fragment insertion using q2-fragment-insertion 33 into the standard QIIME 2 315 SILVA reference, followed by rarefaction to 9,000 sequences per sample, and then computed 316 weighted normalized UniFrac. 317 318 For FINRISK, the data were rarefied to 1,000 and 500,000 sequences per sample for 16S and 319 WGS, respectively. A different depth was used to account for the overall lower amount of 320 sequencing data for FINRISK. As with THDMI, the variables selected were reduced to those 321 with at least two category values having more than 50 samples. 322 323 Support for computing paired effect sizes is part of the QIIME2 Greengenes2 plugin, q2-324 greengenes2, which performs effect size calculations using Evident 325 (https://github.com/biocore/evident/). 326 327 Data access 328 The official location of the Greengenes2 releases is http://ftp.microbio.me/greengenes_release/. 329 The data are released under a BSD-3 clause license.
