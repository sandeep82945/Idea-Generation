 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the specific roles of different fatty acid desaturase enzymes (FADS) in modulating inflammation and disease progression. The paper mentions FADS enzymes introduce double bonds into fatty acids, generating polyunsaturated fatty acids that serve as precursors for bioactive lipid mediators. Further research on how the different FADS enzymes influence inflammatory signaling could reveal therapeutic targets. 

2. Examine how dietary intake of specific fatty acids influences the composition and properties of cell membranes in different tissues. The paper discusses how fatty acid composition adapts in response to factors like diet. More research on how dietary fatty acids impact membrane composition in key tissues like the brain, retina, etc could have implications for nutritional recommendations.

3. Explore the formation and functions of elovanoids in neural tissues. The paper introduces elovanoids as a newly discovered class of bioactive lipids derived from very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their protective effects have been studied in the retina, but more research is needed on their roles in the brain and nervous system. 

4. Investigate the potential of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) as therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases. SPMs like resolvins and protectins derived from DHA and EPA exhibit anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties. Further research on their mechanisms and testing their efficacy as drug candidates could lead to new anti-inflammatory therapies.

5. Engineer cell membranes with specific fatty acid compositions and evaluate impacts on membrane properties and cell signaling/function. The paper discusses how fatty acid composition influences membrane fluidity, permeability, etc. Studies could engineer model membranes with defined fatty acid profiles and characterize resulting effects on membrane physics and cell physiology.
