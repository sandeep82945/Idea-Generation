    "abstractText": "Transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) can be studied from first principles by a perturbative matching onto lattice-calculable quantities: so-called lattice TMDs, which are a class of equal-time correlators that includes quasi-TMDs and TMDs in the Lorentz-invariant approach. We introduce a general correlator that includes as special cases these two Lattice TMDs and continuum TMDs, like the Collins scheme. Then, to facilitate the derivation of a factorization relation between lattice and continuum TMDs, we construct a new scheme, the Large Rapidity (LR) scheme, intermediate between the Collins and quasi-TMDs. The LR and Collins schemes differ only by an order of limits, and can be matched onto one another by a multiplicative kernel. We show that this same matching also holds between quasi and Collins TMDs, which enables us to prove a factorization relation between these quantities to all orders in \u03b1s. Our results imply that there is no mixing between various quark flavors or gluons when matching Collins and quasi TMDs, making the lattice calculation of individual flavors and gluon TMDs easier than anticipated. We cross-check these results explicitly at one loop and discuss implications for other physical-to-lattice scheme factorizations.",

            "text": "Nuclear and particle physicists have striven to ascertain the full three-dimensional structure of hadrons for decades, through a combination of experimental measurements and their theoretical description via parton distribution functions (PDFs). The study of PDFs in the longitudinal momentum direction has reached a high level of maturity within many frameworks, such as global fitting efforts [1\u20138], lattice QCD calculations using moments [9\u201311], quasi-distributions in large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) [12\u201314], and various other techniques [15\u201322]. A major thrust of current research is to extend this progress to transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs (TMDs). In principle, TMDs can be extracted from experiments using global fits [23, 24], but due to limited data these extractions have not yet yielded the same precision as PDFs. However, ongoing and planned experiments such as the Electron-Ion Collider [25, 26] will have enhanced capabilities to probe TMDs, and it is important to complement them with theoretical insight.\nTMDs are intrinsically nonperturbative at small transverse momenta and so lattice QCD provides the only practical method for their first-principles calculation. Unfortunately, TMDs are defined along nonlocal lightlike or close-to-lightlike Wilson line paths, which depend explicitly on a real-valued time variable and thus lie outside the reach of current lattice techniques due to a sign problem, the speculated non-deterministic non-polynomial hard issue of numerically averaging over complex weights in a Euclidean path integral. To circumvent this obstacle, one can construct equal-time correlators that are calculable on the lattice, which we collectively dub \u201cLattice TMDs\u201d. We can then extract information from lattice calculations by relating a lattice TMD to a physical continuum TMD (that appear in cross sections) through a so-called factorization formula, which forms the focus of this paper.\nThere exist several approaches for defining continuum and lattice TMDs. The first lattice TMD studies used the Lorentz-invariant approach of refs. [27\u201332], which we refer to as the Musch-H\u00e4gler-Engelhardt-Negele-Sch\u00e4fer (MHENS) scheme. This approach defines TMDs which are calculated with lattice QCD using spacelike Wilson line paths, and then uses Lorentz invariance to relate them to the path considered for the continuum TMD definitions, which is spacelike but close to the light-cone. This method has so far primarily been used to calculate ratios of physical TMD moments. Later on, LaMET motivated the study of quasi-TMDs [33\u201342], which are Euclidean distributions defined using boosted hadron matrix elements of somewhat different spacelike Wilson line paths. Since the quasi-TMD obeys the Collins-Soper evolution [33], one can extract the nonperturbative Collins-Soper (CS) evolution of TMDs using ratios of quasi-TMDs at different hadron momenta [35], and first lattice results were obtained in refs. [43\u201348]. Methods to calculate the so-called soft function have also been proposed [38] and implemented on the lattice [46, 47].\nTo relate lattice TMDs and physical continuum TMDs one should derive a factorization formula that demonstrates that these TMDs agree in the infrared, and perhaps differ in the ultraviolet by perturbative matching coefficients [33, 34, 36, 39, 41, 49]. In this work, we set up a unified notational framework for lattice and continuum TMDs and derive the factorization formula between the physical Collins TMD and quasi-TMD to all orders in \u03b1s, for both quark and gluon TMDs. Up until now, no lattice-to-continuum factorization\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nformlula has been proven, but a matching between the quasi-TMD and Collins-TMD for the non-singlet quark case has been verified at one-loop order.1 In our analysis here we also fully account for lattice renormalization, soft function subtractions, and finite Wilson line lengths; items that are important to account for in analyses for lattice-QCD-friendly TMDs."

            "text": "Factorization formulae that relate the non-singlet quark quasi-TMD and physical TMD have been proposed in refs. [35, 36, 38, 39]. The objects we are interested in here include both a naive quasi-TMD f\u0303naivens that can be directly calculated with lattice QCD, but whose infrared structure differs from the physical TMD, and a proper quasi-TMD f\u0303ns whose infrared structure agrees. The factorization theorem for both of these quasi-TMDs can be expressed as\nf\u0303 (naive)ns (x,~bT , \u00b5, xP\u0303 z) = Cns(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5)g q S(bT , \u00b5) exp [ 1 2\u03b3 q \u03b6 (bT , \u00b5) ln (2xP\u0303 z)2 \u03b6 ] fns(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6)\n\u00d7 { 1 +O [\n1 (xP\u0303 zbT )2 , \u039b2QCD (xP\u0303 z)2\n]} . (1.1)\nHere ns = u\u2212 d for non-singlet flavor, and Cns is a perturbative matching coefficient which does not depend on spin [40, 49]. In eq. (1.1) x is the fraction of the hadron\u2019s longitudinal momentum carried by the parton, ~bT with bT = |~bT | is the Fourier conjugate of parton transverse momentum, and \u00b5 is the MS renormalization scale. The quasi-TMD depends on the hadron momentum P\u0303 z, while the TMD depends on the CS scale \u03b6; also, \u03b3q\u03b6 is the anomalous dimension for \u03b6-evolution, which is often referred to as the CS kernel [50\u201352]. Since we are interested in nonperturbative bT \u223c \u039b\u22121QCD, for the proper quasi-TMD f\u0303ns we must have gqS = 1, while for the naive quasi-TMD fnaivens the function g q S(bT , \u00b5) is nonperturbative and arises from using a naive quasi-soft function S\u0303Rnaive, but can be calculated from the reduced soft function with the methods proposed in ref. [39]. The definition of the proper quasi-TMD we use here is not the same as earlier literature, see section 2.3.1 for more details. This factorization is valid at large but finite P\u0303 z, with power corrections suppressed by the parton momentum xP\u0303 z as shown in eq. (1.1). In this work, we prove eq. (1.1) at all orders in \u03b1s and generalize it to the quasi-TMDs of all partons i, including light quark flavors (u, d, s) and gluons. Specifically, for the TMDs for hadron h we find\nf\u0303 [s] i/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z) = Ci(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) exp [ 1 2\u03b3 i \u03b6(\u00b5, bT ) ln \u03b6\u0303 \u03b6 ] f [s] i/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6)\n\u00d7 { 1 +O [\n1 (xP\u0303 zbT )2 , \u039b2QCD (xP\u0303 z)2\n]} , (1.2)\n1In ref. [39] arguments for the factorization based on an analysis of leading regions were suggested. The presentation of such an analysis will be an important complement to the proof given here. We note that the collinear, soft and hard leading regions, respectively correspond to the collinear beam function, soft factor and the perturbative matching coefficient considered here. Ref. [49] analyzes factorization for lattice-friendly correlators. The transverse distribution that they study there is not the same as the quasi-TMD in refs. [33, 34, 36, 39, 41] and this work.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nwhere [s] denotes the choice of spin-polarization for the hadronic state and operator, and Ci and \u03b3i\u03b6 depend only on the choice of fundamental or adjoint color representations, so Ci = Cq and \u03b3i\u03b6 = \u03b3 q \u03b6 for all quarks, and Ci = Cg and \u03b3i\u03b6 = \u03b3 g \u03b6 for gluons. The quasi-TMD in eq. (1.2) differs from eq. (1.1) by the soft factor,\nf\u0303 [s] i/h ( x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z ) = f\u0303 [s]naivei/h (x,~bT , \u00b5, xP\u0303 z) \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a S\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5) SRC (bT , \u00b5, 2yn, 2yB) , (1.3)\nwhere SRC (bT , \u00b5, 2yn, 2yB) is the soft function in the Collins scheme [53], R = q, g for quarks in the fundamental or gluons in the adjoint representation, and yn and yB are two different rapidities (see section 2.2.1). Notably, the quasi-TMD depends on a new variable \u03b6\u0303 = x2m2he2(yP\u0303+yB\u2212yn) with hadron mass mh and rapidity yP\u0303 , which is equivalent to a CS scale. Comparing eqs. (1.1)\u2013(1.3), we also show that gqS can be calculated as a ratio of soft functions, in agreement with the definition of the reduced soft function in ref. [39]. Two key results of this work are that eq. (1.2) holds for both quark and gluon quasiTMDs, and there is no mixing between the quark and gluon channels or quarks of different flavors. This differs from the case of the factorizations of quark and gluon longitudinal quasi-PDFs [54]. The matching coefficient Ci takes different values for the two different cases i = q, g, but is independent of quark flavor and spin."

            "text": "We begin by developing a unified notational framework that is applicable to both lattice and continuum TMDs. This framework brings to the forefront the common underlying structural features of different TMD schemes, allowing one to more easily construct factorization formulae relating them to one another. We can write every lattice and continuum TMD as the product of a proton matrix element (beam function), vacuum matrix element (soft factor), and appropriate renormalization factors. In the cases studied in the literature, we show that the beam function can be expressed as the Fourier transform of a generic, common correlator \u2126. Each scheme manifests as a special case of the correlator, encoded by a choice of \u2126\u2019s arguments and of the order in which we take parameter limits needed for proper TMD regularization and renormalization. More details are provided later, and we summarize the choices needed for various schemes in tables 1 and 2. Having a unified notational framework is useful for constructing relationships between continuum TMD schemes that can be connected to physical observables, with schemes that can be computed on the lattice. From the structure of the correlator \u2126, we observe that the Collins and quasi-TMDs are closely related. To relate these schemes we begin by constructing a new TMD scheme that is intermediate between the quasi and Collins TMDs: the Large-Rapidity (LR) scheme. The LR scheme uses the same ingredients as the Collins scheme, but performs UV renormalization at large but finite Wilson line rapidities. Using Lorentz invariance, we show that the quasi- and LR scheme TMDs are equivalent, up to terms suppressed at large proton rapidity. We then show that we can relate the LR and Collins TMDs simply by a perturbative matching kernel, which is flavor-diagonal and spin-independent for both quarks and gluons. Combining the quasi-to-LR and LR-to-Collins\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nQuasi MHENS\nCollins JMY\nLR\nLattice schemes\nContinuum schemes\nChange Wilson lines\nPz large, \u03b7 \u279d \u221e\nSwitch order of \u03b5 \u279d 0, Y \u279d \u221e\nMatching relations\nContinuum limits\nFigure 1. An overview of schemes and their relationships, including the LR scheme introduced in this work. See section 3 for details.\nrelations leads to eq. (1.2). We summarize relationships between a number of common TMD schemes in figure 1.\nThis proof is a beautiful application of the fundamental principle underlying LaMET [12\u2013 14]: partons encode the internal degrees of freedom of a highly energetic hadron, with the hadron momentum limit P z \u2192\u221e taken prior to UV renormalization. In contrast, on the lattice one must carry out UV renormalization prior to the large-momentum limit. This different order of limits in an asymptotically free theory like QCD induces a nontrivial matching kernel between a parton observable and its corresponding lattice construction.\nPeculiarly, in TMDs this noncommutativity of orders of limits appears naturally, since at intermediate steps of the calculation one must regulate so-called rapidity divergences [50, 53, 55\u201364], usually by choosing to deviate from lightcone kinematics or by introducing an additional regulator on the lightcone. These divergences cancel when combining the hadronic and soft matrix elements, allowing one to take the lightcone limit (or infinite rapidity-regulator limit), but also forcing one to decide whether to take this limit before or after UV renormalization. Many schemes for constructing TMDs take the lightcone limit first, e.g. the Collins scheme [53]; others, such as the Ji-Ma-Yuan (JMY) scheme, do the opposite [56]. Once again, exchanging these orders of limits is a UV effect, and thus induces a nontrivial matching relation between Collins and JMY TMDs.\nThis paper is structured as follows: section 2 introduces our new notational framework for defining TMDs. We then provide an overview of the definitions of common physical and lattice TMD schemes. Section 3 presents the proof of the factorization statement in eq. (1.2). We then discuss the physical implications of this proof, in particular the lack of flavor mixing in the matching and utility for calculating ratios of TMDs. We also confirm the momentum evolution RGE equation for the hard matching coefficient, and give a complete solution for it with next-to-leading-logarithmic resummation. From our proof, we also gain intuition for factorization relations between other lattice and continuum TMD schemes, in\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nparticular for the MHENS and Collins schemes which differ due to the presence of Wilson line cusp angles in the former that are not in the latter, and by the need for different soft factors in these two TMDs. We make concluding remarks and outline future directions in section 4. In the appendices, we verify our quasi-to-Collins factorization results analytically at one-loop order, present a one-loop comparison of the continuum JMY and Collins TMDs, and also discuss Wilson line self-energies."

The ellipses in eq. (2.1) denote additional parameters related to UV and rapidity renormalization, whose precise forms are scheme dependent. Note that we suppress indices related to spin-dependent processes and contributions.\nThe literature is rife with schemes for defining TMDs, each of which has different strengths for different types of calculations. This section reviews schemes relevant for lattice studies; in particular, we only discuss schemes based on off-lightcone Wilson lines. Schemes with intrinsically lightlike Wilson lines [58, 60, 62\u201365] are not accessible on a Euclidean lattice, but many are equivalent to the Collins scheme once limits needed to obtain TMD PDFs are taken; see refs. [36, 66] for an overview. Because each scheme in the literature employs its own conventions and notation, in section 2.1 we begin by introducing new unified TMD Lorentz-invariant correlators for which all schemes follow as special cases. Then, we provide definitions of physical and lattice schemes in sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively."

Different choices of b, v, and \u03b4 constitute different, equally valid ways of defining a TMD. Continuum and lattice TMDs are distinguished by the length parameter, \u03b7, which may be infinite or finite. The length of the staple is relevant for its renormalization properties; here we have\nLstaple = |\u03b7v \u2212 \u03b4/2|+ |\u03b7v + \u03b4/2|+ |b\u2212 \u03b4| , (2.5)\nwhere the length of a four-vector is given by |X| = \u221a |X2|.

(2.7), qi(x) is a quark field of flavor i, and G\u00b5\u03bd(x) is the gluon field strength tensor. The quark and gluon fields are spatially separated by b, which is Fourier-conjugate to the momentum of the struck parton. In the quark correlator, \u0393 denotes a generic Dirac structure, while for the gluon correlator \u00b5, \u03bd, \u03c1, and \u03c3 are Lorentz indices. See refs. [40, 67] for decompositions of different choices of \u0393 into independent spin structures for quark TMDs, and refs. [68, 69] for the decomposition for gluon TMDs. In both cases, h denotes the struck hadron with momentum P , is the UV regulator, and \u03b7v and \u03b4 characterize the longitudinal and transverse segments of the Wilson line, which we illustrate in figure 2.\nWe define the generic soft vacuum matrix element as\nSR(b, , \u03b7v, \u03b7\u0304v\u0304) = 1 dR\n\u2329 0 \u2223\u2223\u2223Tr[SR(b, \u03b7v, \u03b7\u0304v\u0304)]\u2223\u2223\u22230\u232a , (2.8)\nwhere the trace is over color. The color averaging factor dR takes values dq = Nc and dg = N2c \u2212 1.

S consists of two beam function staples glued together at the points \u00b1b/2; the long sides of the staples run along the \u03b7\u0304v\u0304 and \u03b7v directions. The dependence on two conjugate directions arises from the appearance of two TMDs in the physical cross section in eq. (2.2). The length of the soft function path is L = 2|\u03b7\u0304v\u0304|+ 2|\u03b7v|+ 2|b|. We define the transverse direction with respect to the plane spanned by P and v, taking P\u22a5 = v\u22a5 = 0. Formally, this can be expressed as b\u00b5\u22a5 = g \u00b5\u03bd \u22a5 b\u03bd with\ng\u00b5\u03bd\u22a5 = g \u00b5\u03bd \u2212 1\n1 + \u03b6\u03022\n[ v\u00b5v\u03bd\nv2 + P\n\u00b5P \u03bd\nP 2 + \u03b6\u0302\n2 P \u00b7 v ( P\u00b5v\u03bd + v\u00b5P \u03bd\n)] , \u03b6\u0302 = v \u00b7 P\u221a\n|v2|P 2 . (2.10)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nWe always take v and P to span the same plane as v and v\u0304. It follows that v\u22a5 = v\u0304\u22a5 = 0. Our unified notation facilitates the comparison of different TMD schemes, particularly when we examine their Lorentz invariants. In the most generic case, the beam function correlator in eq. (2.7) is specified by four independent vectors: b\u00b5, P\u00b5, \u03b7v\u00b5, and \u03b4\u00b5. From these vectors we can construct ten independent Lorentz invariants, which we choose to be\nP 2 , b2 , \u03b72v2 , P \u00b7 b , P \u00b7 (\u03b7v)\u221a P 2|(\u03b7v)2| , b \u00b7 (\u03b7v)\u221a |b2(\u03b7v)2| , \u03b42 b2 , b \u00b7 \u03b4 b2 , P \u00b7 \u03b4 P \u00b7 b , \u03b4 \u00b7 (\u03b7v) b \u00b7 (\u03b7v) . (2.11)\nNone of the TMD schemes we study in this paper contains a vector \u03b4\u00b5 that is linearly independent of b\u00b5, P\u00b5, and \u03b7v\u00b5; thus, these schemes have six independent Lorentz invariants. However, the quasi and MHENS TMDs do not follow from the same correlator defined with six invariants, since they fix \u03b4\u00b5 in different ways, as we will see below. Hence, even if the first six invariants in eq. (2.11) are fixed to be the same, the two approaches have different values for the last four invariants, and thus the quasi- and MHENS TMDs belong to distinct schemes."

This transverse segment is important in singular gauges [70]. Note that the transverse segment is often not specified in the literature: in nonsingular gauges such as Feynman gauge, a Wilson line at lightcone infinity does not make contributions, and its self-energy cancels against the corresponding piece in the soft function [53]. The longitudinal Wilson line segments extend along \u03b7v \u00b1 \u03b42 = (\u03b7e\n2yB , \u03b7 \u00b1 \u03b42 , 0\u22a5) and thus only depend on the rapidity yB in the limit |\u03b7| \u2192 \u221e. The limit \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e taken in eq. (2.19) applies to Drell-Yan kinematics, whereas SIDIS kinematics uses \u03b7 \u2192\u221e. Finally, we remark that due to taking the lightcone limit prior to UV renormalization, the Collins scheme is equivalent to schemes defined with rapidity regulators on the lightcone [58, 60, 62\u201365] that are often employed in higher-order perturbative calculations and higher-order resummed phenomenological analyses, see e.g. ref.

(2.24)\nHere BJMYi/h and SJMY are renormalized beam and soft functions. This is a crucial distinction from the Collins scheme, in which we first combine the beam and soft functions, then take the lightlike limit \u03c1\u2192\u221e, and only thereafter carry out renormalization, cf. eq. (2.18).\nFor a hadron moving in the na direction, the JMY quark beam and soft functions are\nBJMYqi/h (x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6v) = \u222b db\u2212 2\u03c0 e \u2212ib\u2212(xP+)\u2126[\u03b3 +] qi/h [ b, P, \u00b5,\u2212\u221ev, b\u2212nb ] ,\nSRJMY(bT , \u00b5, \u03c1) = SR[b\u22a5, \u00b5,\u2212\u221ev,\u2212\u221ev\u0303] , (2.25)\nwhere \u2126i/h and SR are the renormalized generic correlators in eqs.

The JMY correlator differs from the Collins correlator in eq. (2.19) by the presence of timelike (v2 > 0) rather than spacelike (n2B < 0) Wilson lines. We can perturbatively match the JMY and Collins scheme TMDs, see appendix B.\nJMY gluon TMDs are not explicitly defined in the literature; nonetheless, one can define them in an analogous manner to the quark TMDs through eq.

The LR scheme uses the same beam and soft functions as the Collins scheme, but a different order of carrying out UV renormalization and approaching the lightcone.

The UV counterterm ZLRuv does not depend on the rapidities in the beam function because the beam function does not involve nontrivial cusp angles, and the renormalization of its staple-shaped Wilson line and quark operators are rapidity-independent. It does however explicitly depend on the Wilson line rapidity difference yn \u2212 yB through the renormalization of the soft function. In particular, the UV renormalization constant ZLRuv is the product of those of the bare beam function and soft factor. As will be shown in section 3.1.2, the bare beam function at large, but finite, (\u2212yB) is equal to the quasi-beam function in a hadron state with momentum given by yP \u2212 yB. Using the auxiliary field formalism of the Wilson lines, one can show [37, 71\u201373] that renormalization of the quasi-beam function is multiplicative in coordinate space and independent of the external hadron momentum. Therefore, ZLRuv is independent of yP \u2212 yB , and only depends on yn \u2212 yB due to the renormalization of the soft factor. This should be contrasted with the Collins scheme, where ZCuv depends on \u03b6 \u221d e2(yP\u2212yn), cf. eq. (2.18). We note that the renormalized LR scheme TMD depends on yP \u2212 yB; hence, the limit \u2212yB 1 is to be understood as taking (\u2212yB) large but finite instead of taking the limit yB \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The LR and Collins TMDs use the same \u03b6 = (2xmheyP\u2212yn)2 to encode yn dependence. We can also view the LR scheme as the JMY scheme defined with spacelike instead of timelike Wilson lines. See section 3.1 for further elaboration on and derivation of LR scheme properties."

(2.29)\nHere, \u0393\u0303 is a Dirac structure, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are generic Lorentz indices, \u03c1 and \u03c3 are transverse indices, and N\u0393\u0303 and N\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03c3 are normalization factors. To enable calculations on the lattice, we use equal-time paths\nb\u0303 = (0, bxT , b y T , b\u0303 z) , \u03b7\u0303v = \u03b7\u0303z\u0302 = (0, 0, 0, \u03b7\u0303) , \u03b4 = b\u0303z z\u0302 = (0, 0, 0, b\u0303z) , (2.30)\nas illustrated in figure 4. This choice of \u03b4 guarantees that the transverse Wilson line segment is perpendicular to the longitudinal segments and that the total length of the staple ` = 2\u03b7\u0303 + bT is independent of b\u0303z. Therefore, the cusp angles in the quasi-beam function are always trivially \u03c0/2, so that the UV renormalization factor is independent of b\u0303z and can be pulled out of the Fourier integral in eq. (2.29) [37]. This is a key difference to the MHENS scheme discussed in section 2.3.2.\nThe construction of the quasi-beam function in eq. (2.29) is guided by the observation that by boosting the operator and taking |\u03b7\u0303| \u2192 \u221e, one recovers eq. (2.19). In contrast, the soft function depends on two almost-lightlike directions and thus cannot be obtained by boosting an equal-time operator [36]; several potential (quasi-)soft functions have been proposed [33, 34, 36] despite the fact that these proposals cannot recover eq. (2.19) under any Lorentz boost. Here, we construct the lattice soft function as a finite-length version of the Collins soft function in eq. (2.19),\nS\u0303R(bT , a, \u03b7\u0303, yA, yB) = SR [ b\u22a5, a,\u2212\u03b7\u0303\nnA(yA) |nA(yA)| ,\u2212\u03b7\u0303 nB(yB) |nB(yB)|\n] . (2.31)\nHere the length of the soft function path is L = 2(2\u03b7\u0303 + bT ) = 2Lstaple. The choice of the minus sign in the last two arguments, \u03b7v and \u03b7\u0304v\u0304, allows Lorentz-invariant products obtained from these choices to be more easily related to continuum schemes.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nb\nt z\nq\nq\nbz\nT\nbz+ \n\nbz -\n\u03b7\n\u02dc\n\u02dc\u02dc \u02dc\nt z\nq\nb \nb -\nq v\u03b7\nv\u03b7\nbT\nFigure 4.

In practice, calculating (quasi-)TMD soft functions poses a significant challenge for the lattice. It is possible to construct the quasi-soft function indirectly through the spacelike meson form factor and quasi-wavefunction [38]; promising first results using this approach have been reported in refs. [46, 47]. Prior to this work, the literature has studied different proposals of the quasi-soft function which are constructed from equal-time Wilson lines [33\u201336, 38, 39]. The naive quasi-soft function features a rectangle-shaped Wilson loop along the z direction,\nS\u0303Rnaive(bT , a, \u03b7\u0303) \u2261 SR [ b\u22a5, a, \u03b7\u0303z\u0302,\u2212\u03b7\u0303z\u0302 ] , (2.33)\nwhose renormalized continuum version with \u03b7\u0303 =\u221e in the MS scheme is denoted\nS\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5) \u2261 SR [ b\u22a5, \u00b5,\u221ez\u0302,\u2212\u221ez\u0302 ] . (2.34)\nHowever, it has been shown at one-loop level [36] that S\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5) does not have the correct IR physics for the quasi-TMD to be perturbatively matchable to the Collins TMD. Although refs. [34, 36] proposed a bent quasi-soft function that works at one-loop order, it was argued that the factorization utilizing this function will break down at two loops [38].\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nNevertheless, the naive quasi-soft function S\u0303Rnaive can still serve a useful purpose for lattice calculations, where it can be used to cancel linear power divergences proportional to \u03b7\u0303 and bT . For this reason it is useful to define the naive quasi-TMD as\nf\u0303 [\u0393\u0303]naive i/h (x,~bT , \u00b5, xP\u0303 z) = lim \u03b7\u0303\u2192\u221e\nB\u0303 [\u0393\u0303] i/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b7\u0303, xP\u0303 z)\u221a S\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5, \u03b7\u0303) . (2.35)\nThis can then be compared to the quasi-TMD f\u0303i/h defined with a quasi-soft function S\u0303R that yields the correct infrared structure. Since the \u03b7-dependence cancels exactly between the quasi beam and soft functions, we have\nlim \u03b7\u0303\u2192\u221e S\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5, \u03b7\u0303) S\u0303R(bT , \u00b5, \u03b7\u0303, 2yn, 2yB) = S\u0303 R naive(bT , \u00b5) SRC (bT , \u00b5, 2yn, 2yB) , (2.36)\nwhich leads to the relationship between f\u0303naivei and f\u0303i in eq. (1.3). A further discussion of the equivalence in eq. (2.36) is provided in section 3.1.2.\nMoreover, at large rapidity the Collins soft function behaves as [50\u201352]\nlim \u2212yB 1\nSRC (bT , \u00b5, 2yn, 2yB) = SI(bT , \u00b5) e 2(yn\u2212yB)\u03b3q\u03b6 (bT ,\u00b5) , (2.37)\nwhere SI(bT , \u00b5) is a rapidity-independent component of the soft function. Although the entire SRC exponentiates due to the non-Abelian exponentiation theorem for Wilson line operators [74, 75], the important aspect of eq. (2.37) is the particular dependence on rapidity. Using eq. (2.37), the multiplicative factor relating f\u0303naivei and f\u0303i can be simplified as\nlim yB\u2192\u2212\u221e \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a S\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5) SRC (bT , \u00b5, 2yn, 2yB) = \u221a S\u0303Rnaive(bT , \u00b5) SI(bT , \u00b5) e\u2212(yn\u2212yB)\u03b3 q \u03b6 (bT ,\u00b5)\n\u2261 [gqS(bT , \u00b5)] \u22121 exp [ \u221212\u03b3 q \u03b6 (bT , \u00b5) ln (2xP\u0303 z)2 \u03b6 ] , (2.38)\nPlugging eq. (2.38) into eq. (1.2) gives the original factorization formula eq. (1.1) proposed in refs. [35, 36, 38, 39]. We identify gqS(bT , \u00b5) as the same factor introduced in ref. [36], which is equivalent to the square root of the reduced soft function Sr(bT , \u00b5) in refs. [38, 39]."

For the full parametrization and similar decompositions for all \u0393, see ref. [29]. The scalar amplitudes A\u03032 and B\u03031 depend on all six Lorentz invariants, though we leave implicit dependence on the hadron mass P 2 = m2h. For the beam function in eq.

To connect to the continuum TMDs one considers the large rapidity limit, equivalent to v \u00b7 P \u2192\u221e with P 2 fixed, so \u03b6\u0302 \u2192\u221e. Inserting eq. (2.42) into eq.

Inserting this result into eq. (2.39), the unpolarized MHENS beam function is given by\n1 2B MHENS [\u03b3+] qi/h\n(x,~bT , P, a, \u03b7v) = \u222b d(b\u00b7P )\n2\u03c0 e \u2212ix(P \u00b7b)A\u03032B\n( b2, b\u00b7P, b\u00b7P\nP 2 R ( \u03b6\u03022 ) , v2 (v\u00b7P )2 , \u03b7v\u00b7P ) .\n(2.46)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nOne can obtain other leading-twist and spin-dependent beam functions in a similar fashion. Due to its Lorentz-invariant formulation, eq. (2.46) can be evaluated in any frame so long as eq. (2.42) is satisfied. This includes a frame where b0 = v0 = 0, as required on the lattice. The above method has been applied to calculating the moments of TMDs. Since integrating over x sets P \u00b7b = 0, the moments can be calculated in a frame where b = (0, 0, b\u22a5). In this case the beam functions \u2126[\u03b3\n+] q/h agree between the MHENS and Collins schemes since\nwe have \u03b4 = 0 in both cases. We elaborate on this further in section 3.2.4. To calculate the x-dependence, one must evaluate eq. (2.46) for generic P \u00b7b 6= 0. In this case, the MHENS and Collins staples are shaped differently, and thus their beam functions are not equivalent. There are two key differences. First, the Collins staple is closed along b\u2212 \u03b4 = b\u22a5, and thus its tranverse and longitudinal Wilson line segments are perpendicular to one another. In contrast, the MHENS staple closes along b\u2212 \u03b4 = b, which for v \u00b7 b 6= 0 induces a (P \u00b7 b)-dependent cusp angle according to eq. (2.42). Second, in the frame where b0 = 0, the MHENS staple length is not bz-independent, leading to nontrivial Wilson-line self-energies that depend on bz or P \u00b7 b. Overall, this leads to a nontrivial Wilson line renormalization that depends on P \u00b7 b which cannot be factored out of the Fourier integral. We demonstrate this at one-loop order in appendix C, and discuss the relation between the MHENS and Collins TMDs in depth in section 3.2.4."

(2.7), in table 1 we see that TMDs take on a similar form in all schemes. Key differences manifest in the order of limits taken to form the TMD, as well as the specific arguments of the beam function correlator \u2126. Notably, we can express \u2126 in terms of Lorentz-invariant combinations of its arguments. Comparing the values that these Lorentz invariants take on in each scheme, as shown in table 2, provides a useful way of relating different schemes to one another.

(3.13)\nHere, the first correlator yields the quasi-beam function at the shifted proton momentum, while the second correlator is that of the Collins/LR scheme at finite length\n\u03b7 = \u2212 \u03b7\u0303e \u2212yB \u221a\n2 . (3.14)\nNote that \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0303 always have opposite signs, and that \u03b7 < 0 corresponds to the TMD PDF for Drell-Yan, while \u03b7 > 0 corresponds to the TMD PDF for SIDIS. Next, we supplement eq. (3.13) with a soft subtraction and UV renormalization. On the lattice we cannot take the strict limit yB \u2192 \u2212\u221e, so we must keep yB large but finite. The Collins scheme entails taking the lightcone limit of B/ \u221a S prior to UV renormalization, but here we must renormalize at finite yB . Up until this point, all statements we made hold for both the bare Collins and LR schemes, but for the remainder of this subsection, we only compare the renormalized quasi- and LR TMDs.

(3.18)\nIn eq. (3.15), following standard notation for quasi-TMDs, we encode dependence on yP \u2212yB in P\u0303 z = mh sinh(yP \u2212 yB), whereas in eq. (3.16) we state this dependence explicitly. The constraint of yP\u0303 = yP \u2212 yB leads to \u03b6 = \u03b6\u0303. For both TMDs, we use the finite-length soft function in eq. (2.31), repeated here for convenience:\nS\u0303R(bT , , \u03b7\u0303, yA, yB) = SR [ b\u22a5, ,\u2212\u03b7\u0303\nnA(yA) |nA(yA)| ,\u2212\u03b7\u0303 nB(yB) |nB(yB)|\n] . (3.19)\nThe geometric length of the soft function Wilson line is twice of that of the quasi-beam function, so that all linear divergences from Wilson line self-energies cancel in eq. (3.15).4 Since the hadronic matrix elements in eqs. (3.15) and (3.16) are related by a boost, we naturally also employ this soft function for the finite-length LR scheme. Finally, we discuss the form of the UV counterterm Zq, which is simply the ratio of the individual counterterms ZBuv and ZSuv for the beam and soft functions,\nZquv(\u00b5, , yn \u2212 yB) = ZBuv(\u00b5, )\u221a\nZSuv(\u00b5, , 2yn \u2212 2yB) . (3.20)\nHere, we use that in the MS scheme, the UV divergences of the quasi-beam and soft functions are multiplicative and xP\u0303 z-independent, according to the auxiliary field formalism [40, 73]. Using eq. (3.13), we can now relate the renormalized finite-length quasi-TMD and LR TMD defined in eqs. (3.15) and (3.16),\nlim yB \u22121 f\u0303qi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b7\u0303, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z) = lim yB \u22121 fLRqi/h\n( x,~bT , \u00b5,\u2212\n\u03b7\u0303\u221a 2 e\u2212yB , \u03b6\u0303, yP \u2212 yB\n) . (3.21)\nHere, we have accounted for the change of Wilson line length in the LR scheme and used \u03b6\u0303 as the common CS scale. The final step is to take the limit \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e to relate this result to the continuum TMD. In the continuum TMD, this limit is taken prior to UV renormalization (or \u2192 0), while on the lattice one is forced to extrapolate to infinite \u03b7\u0303 after renormalization. Thus, we must show that the limits \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e and \u2192 0 commute. First, for \u03b7\u0303 bT b\u0303z the Wilson-line self-energy contributions cancel exactly in the ratio \u2126/ \u221a S, which is not affected by the order of the \u03b7\u0303 \u2192 \u221e and \u2192 0 limits. The reason is that the staple geometry in the correlator \u2126 is one half of that of the quasi-soft function S, and the exchange of gluons between the two halves in S is exponentially suppressed due to the spacelike separation and\n4Recall that in dimensional regularization considered here, these linear divergences appear as poles in 1/(d\u2212 3), and hence are absent in the MS scheme where only poles in 1/(d\u2212 4) are subtracted. Hence, these linear divergences are set to zero for perturbative calculations in the MS scheme, but it is important to take them into account for a definition amenable to lattice calculations.\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nlarge \u03b7\u0303. Second, after the subtraction of Wilson-line self-energy diagrams, the remaining diagrams will include the eikonal propagators\n1\u2212 e\u00b1i(nB \u00b7(k\u00b1i\u03b5)\u03b7\u0303/|nB |\nnB \u00b7 k \u00b1 i\u03b5 , (3.22)\nwhich have a singularity at nB \u00b7 k = 0. Such a singularity can be regulated either with a finite \u03b7\u0303 and without the imaginary part i\u03b5, or if we keep i\u03b5 and throw away the second term in the numerator. For both regulators, the results are the same and independent of \u03b7\u0303 if one takes the \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e or \u03b5\u2192 0 limit in the end, which we have also verified explicitly at one-loop order. Therefore, the \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e and \u2192 0 limits also commute for these diagrams. In summary, this commutativity leads to the equivalence of the quasi- and LR TMDs with infinite Wilson lines:\nf\u0303qi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z)\n= lim \u2212yB 1 \u222b d(P\u0303 \u00b7b\u0303) 2\u03c0 e \u2212ix(P\u0303 \u00b7b\u0303) lim \u21920 Zquv(\u00b5, , yn \u2212 yB) lim \u03b7\u0303\u2192\u221e\n\u2126qi/h [ b\u0303, P\u0303 , , \u03b7\u0303z\u0302, b\u0303z z\u0302 ] \u221a S\u0303q(bT , , \u03b7\u0303, 2yn, 2yB)\n= lim \u2212yB 1 \u222b d(P \u00b7b) 2\u03c0 e \u2212ix(P \u00b7b) lim \u21920 Zquv(\u00b5, , yn \u2212 yB) lim\u03b7\u2192\u2212\u221e \u2126qi/h[b, P, , \u03b7nB(yB), b\u2212nb]\u221a\nSq(bT , , \u03b7, 2yn, 2yB) = fLRqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, yP \u2212 yB) . (3.23)\nHere we used the commutativity of the \u2192 0 and \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e limits in first step, used eq. (3.21) in the second step, and used that the \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit naturally gives the continuum LR TMD defined in eq. (2.26) in the last step. Note that we could equally well have obtained the LR TMD with \u03b7 \u2192 +\u221e by choosing to consider the quasi TMD with the limit \u03b7\u0303 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This choice of obtaining the limits \u03b7 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e is physically relevant for the time reversal odd TMD PDFs, namely the Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions, which are known to differ by an overall sign in Drell-Yan and SIDIS."

The next step is to derive the relation between the LR and Collins schemes. According to eqs. (2.18) and (2.26), the only difference between these schemes is the order of their \u2192 0 and yB \u2192 \u2212\u221e limits. In the LR scheme, large (\u2212yB) corresponds to a momentum scale\n\u03b6LR = 4x2m2h sinh2(yP \u2212 yB) , (3.24)\nso the limit yB \u2192 \u2212\u221e corresponds to \u03b6LR \u2192\u221e. Due to asymptotic freedom in QCD, changing the order of limits \u2192 0 and \u03b6LR \u2192\u221e should only affect the UV region while leaving infrared (IR) physics intact. Using the LaMET formalism [12\u201314], behind which is the general principle for effective field theories (EFTs), we can relate the two different orders of limits with a factorization formula or\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nperturbative matching,5 which takes the form\nfqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) = C \u22121 q (\u221a \u03b6LR/2, \u00b5 ) fLRqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6, yP \u2212 yB) +O(y k Be yB ) , (3.25)\nwhere we have expanded at large (\u2212yB) or in \u039b2QCD/\u03b6LR. Here, ykB captures logarithms of \u03b6LR where k is a positive integer. At large (\u2212yB), the matching coefficient C cancels the overall yB dependence in the renormalized beam and soft functions through its \u03b6LR dependence. By dimensional analysis, Cq could depend on the logarithm of \u03b6LR/\u00b52 or the rapidity difference (yn\u2212 yB). However, according to eq. (2.37), the dependence on (yn\u2212 yB) implies dependence on the CS kernel \u03b3q\u03b6 (bT , \u00b5), which at bT \u223c 1/\u039bQCD is nonperturbative and hence infrared sensitive. Therefore, Cq can only depend on \u03b6LR/\u00b52 and \u03b1s(\u00b5), and so the factorization formula for the LR-TMD is\nfLRqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6, yP \u2212 yB) = Cq (\u221a \u03b6LR/2, \u00b5 ) fqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) +O(y k Be yB ) , (3.26)\nwhere \u03b6LR is given by eq. (3.24). Combining this with the relation derived above in eqs. (1.3) and (2.38) for the quasi-TMD, with \u03b6LR = (2xP\u0303 z)2, we have\nf\u0303qi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z) = Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5)fqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303) +O(y\u0303 k P e \u2212y\u0303P ) (3.27) = Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) exp [\n1 2\u03b3 q \u03b6 (\u00b5, bT ) ln \u03b6\u0303 \u03b6 ] fqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) +O(y\u0303 k P e \u2212y\u0303P ) .\nwhere \u03b6 can be of any value.

            "text": "Our derivation of the factorization formula has not specified the quark flavor, and the result actually implies that mixings between quarks of different flavors or quarks and gluons do not exist. This lack of mixing is a generic feature for quasi-TMDs of all parton species. The LR and Collins schemes differ only in the order of their \u2192 0 and yB \u2192 \u2212\u221e limits. When matching the schemes, mixing between quark and gluon channels could only occur if\n5The impact of exchanging these limits has also been pointed out in the discussion of the Sudakov form factor in ref. [53], in particular eq. (10.97) therein. The EFT argument for the matching would also be reinforced by an order-by-order diagrammatical analysis [76] following ref.

This cannot happen because these quark fields are always spacelike separated, and thus their exchange of intermediate particles in a Feynman diagram is exponentially suppressed and does not generate a new UV divergence. As a result, the yB \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit can only change UV divergences locally at quark-Wilson line vertices and in Wilson line wavefunction renormalization, which leaves the parton flavor intact. In contrast to the quasi-TMDs, the quark quasi-PDFs are defined from bilinear operators with a straight Wilson line along the z direction. In the infinite boost limit, the spacelike separated quarks will approach the light-cone, thus inducing a nonlocal UV divergence that contracts the quark flavor indices and allows mixing with the gluon quasi-PDF [54]. There is another perspective from which we can understand the lack of mixing. The LR and JMY schemes are related to each other by analytic continuation between space- and timelike Wilson lines. Thus, the JMY scheme should factorize similarly to eq. (3.26), as we check at one-loop order in appendix A.1. If there were quark-gluon or flavor mixing in the Collins-to-JMY matching, then such mixing would manifest in the TMD factorization formula for the Drell-Yan or SIDIS cross-section in either scheme; but it does not. Therefore, no mixing should occur in the Collins-to-JMY or Collins-to-LR matching. Note that this factorization relation holds for quark and gluon quasi-TMDs with all spin-dependent structures [40, 49], so we can use it to compute the ratios of spin-dependent TMDs from the quasi-TMDs or quasi-beam functions, an approach that has been proposed and used in refs. [27\u201332]. In summary, all quark and gluon quasi-TMDs should satisfy the factorization relation in eq. (1.2). We cross-check our all-orders analysis above by explicit one-loop order calculations in appendix A.2."

Explicit results at a given order can be obtained by substituting fixed order series for \u0393cusp[\u03b1\u2032], \u03b3qC [\u03b1], and Cq[\u03b1s].\nUsing the known one-loop results [33, 35] we have\n\u03b3qC(2xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) = \u03b1s(\u00b5)CF\n\u03c0\n( \u2212 ln (2xP\u0303 z)2\n\u00b52 + 1\n) +O(\u03b12s) , (3.35)\nCq[\u03b1s] = 1 + \u03b1sCF\n2\u03c0\n( \u22122 + \u03c0 2\n12\n) +O(\u03b12s) ,\nwhich is consistent with \u0393q0 = 4CF and allows us to identify \u03b3 q C 0 = 4CF . To obtain results for eq.

Using the notation of ref.

Expanding we find agreement with an earlier O(\u03b12s) analysis for the terms we can predict at NLL, given by all the O(\u03b12s lnj 2xP\u0303 z\n\u00b5 ) terms with j = 2, 3, 4 in eqs. (25,26) of ref. [39]. Equation (3.36) can be expanded to higher orders in \u03b1s, and then predicts the terms in lnCq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) of the form \u03b1js lnj+1 2xP\u0303 z \u00b5 and \u03b1 j s lnj 2xP\u0303 z\n\u00b5 for any j. Results for Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) beyond NLL can be obtained from eq. (3.34) by substituting\nin higher order results for the anomalous dimensions and boundary condition. (Results for Kq\u0393 and Kq\u03b3 in terms of anomalous dimensions can be found in many places in the literature to order N3LL, see also ref. [78] for an exact solution.) An RGE equation in the form in eq. (3.28) will also hold for the xP\u0303 z anomalous dimension for the gluon TMD, so a resummed formula for its matching coefficient Cg(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) is given by the above expressions with q \u2192 g and replacement by the gluon cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions."

            "text": "The lack of mixing in the factorization formula eq. (1.2) for quasi-TMDs allows us to calculate ratios of TMDs of all flavor and spin structures more easily since there are cancellations between the numerator and denominators. This approach of studying ratios was pioneered in the Lorentz-invariant method of refs. [27, 28] using the MHENS scheme. This has been shown to have great utility for exploring ratios involving an integral over x and different spin and flavor choices [28\u201332]. We return to discuss the prospects for including renormalization and matching corrections in the MHENS scheme approach in section 3.2.4. For quasi-TMDs the ability to more easily calculate ratios of spin dependent structure functions was observed for quark non-singlet distributions in refs. [40, 41], and occur due to the universality of the quasi-TMD to Collins-TMD matching coefficient. Our result in eq. (1.2) enable us to extend these observations to all orders in \u03b1s, and include singlet quark distributions and gluon distributions. Since the quasi soft factor \u2206\u0303R in eq. (2.27) and the matching coefficients Cq,g in eq. (1.2) only depend on the color representation, we can formulate ratios of quark or gluon quasi-TMDs where these components cancel, and thus immediately can be related to the analogous ratios for the quark and gluon TMDs in the Collins scheme.

To calculate the ratios in eq. (3.37) as a function of x, one must first compute the matrix elements for the quasi-beam functions at all bz, then take the Fourier transform. Because UV divergences in the bare quasi-beam function matrix elements are bz-independent, they factor out of the Fourier integral. So, in principle we can skip renormalization and matching to the MS scheme when calculating TMD ratios, if there are no bz-dependent finite operator mixings on the discretized lattice. However, in the presence of such mixings, lattice renormalization is necessary, as studied in refs. [43, 73]. Also, in numerical analyses it can be advantageous to consider the \u03b7\u0303 \u2192 \u221e limit separately for the numerator and denominator of eq. (3.37) separately. This can be accomplished by utilizing the naive quasi-soft function or quasi-beam function at bz = 0 to cancel the large \u03b7\u0303-dependence."

            "heading": "3.2.4 Matching MHENS and continuum TMDs",
            "text": "We now consider the relation between the MHENS lattice TMD and Collins continuum TMD, focusing again on the quark case. In the literature, the MHENS scheme has primarily been used to study matrix elements evaluated at P \u00b7 b = 0 [27\u201332]. In this case, the equal-time-restricted Wilson line path in the MHENS beam function is the same as that of the quasi-beam function. This is easily seen by comparing the integral over x of the MHENS beam function in eq. (2.39), with the integral over x of the quasi-beam function in eq. (2.29), and noting that both give the same correlator \u2126[\u0393]q/h [ ~bT , P\u0303 , a, \u03b7\u0303z\u0302, 0 ] = \u03a6\u0303[\u0393]unsubtr.

The results on the right hand side correspond to the hadronic matrix element of the operator with bz = 0. We adopt the same notation for the MHENS TMD, as shown. Given this correspondence, we can simply adopt the same terms used in defining the quasi-TMD in eq. (2.27) to define a renormalized and soft subtracted MHENS TMD for P\u0303 \u00b7 b = 0, b0 = 0, and v = z\u0302, giving\nf [\u0393]MHENS qi/h (bz = 0,~bT , \u00b5, P\u0303 , yn \u2212 yB, \u03b7\u0303) (3.39)\n\u2261 lim a\u21920 Z \u2032uv(\u00b5, \u00b5\u0303)Zuv(a, \u00b5\u0303, yn \u2212 yB) N\u0393 P z \u03a6\u0303[\u0393]qi/hunsubtr.(~bT , P\u0303 , a, \u03b7\u0303z\u0302) \u2206\u0303 q S(bT , a, \u03b7\u0303, yn, yB) .\nThe limit \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e of eq. (3.39) gives a finite result independent of \u03b7\u0303, since the Wilson line self-energy power law divergences cancel between \u03a6\u0303[\u0393]unsubtr. and \u2206\u0303 q S . With this definition for the MHENS TMD, our result in eq.

(3.40)\nHere, the MHENS TMD (or quasi-TMD) on the l.h.s. is calculated with states involving proton momentum P\u0303 , while the Collins TMD on the r.h.s. utilizes states with proton momentum P . We have chosen to relate these two momenta by the rapidity relation yP = yP\u0303 + yB that appeared in our proof of factorization. In the large P\u0303 z limit, we have \u03b6 = (2xP ze\u2212yn)2 = (2xP\u0303 zeyB\u2212yn)2 = \u03b6\u0303, which eliminates the ln(\u03b6\u0303/\u03b6)-dependent term in eq. (1.2), which would otherwise appear in the integrand in eq. (3.40). Note that for large P\u0303 z we also have \u03b6\u0302 \u2192\u221e, where \u03b6\u0302 was defined in eq. (2.43). We now consider the implications of the factorization in eq. (3.40) for computing Collins TMD ratios. Taking ratios of MHENS TMDs with different choices of spin structures \u0393, we see that the UV renormalization factors Z \u2032uv and Zuv and soft factor \u2206\u0303 q S all drop out. Thus, ratios of MHENS beam functions give us information about the ratios of Collins-TMDs,\nlim a\u2192 0 \u03b7\u0303\u2192\u221e\nN\u03931\u03a6\u0303 [\u03931]qi/h unsubtr.(~bT , P\u0303 , a, \u03b7\u0303z\u0302) N\u03932\u03a6\u0303 [\u03932]qi/h unsubtr.(~bT , P\u0303 , a, \u03b7\u0303z\u0302)\n= \u222b dx Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5)f [\u03931]qi/h(x, ~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6)\u222b\ndx Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5)f [\u03932]qi/h(x, ~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6)\n, (3.41)\nalbeit with an integration over the matching coefficient Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5). Here there is power law sensitivity to \u03b7\u0303 in the numerator and denominator of the l.h.s., but this sensitivity cancels in the ratio, as does the dependence on a (assuming that there is no mixing amongst spin structures for the lattice fermion discretization chosen [43, 73, 79, 80]). As explained in section 3.1.3, Cq arises precisely because of the different orders in which renormalization and the large rapidity limit are taken to be performed between the MHENS and Collins TMDs. Equation (3.41) reduces to the relation between MHENS beam functions and the moment of the Collins TMDs discussed in earlier literature [28\u201332] if one sets Cq = 1 + O(\u03b1s), i.e. works to tree level in the matching coefficient. Beyond tree-level, the convolution becomes nontrivial. Nevertheless, one can plug the TMDs from global analysis into eq. (3.41) to compare with the lattice ratio of the MHENS beam function. It is worth noting that the CS evolution for the \u03b6 dependence is multiplicative and independent of x, and hence the ratio of Collins TMDs on the r.h.s. is independent of \u03b6 as long as the same value of \u03b6 is used in the numerator and denominator. By constructing lattice TMD ratios with the same spin structures but different momenta P\u0303 z in the numerator and denominator, one can extract the CS kernel \u03b3\u03b6(\u00b5, bT ) [35]. Once again one cannot avoid the need to include the matching coefficient whether working in longitudinal momentum or position space [37]. Thus a formula for obtaining \u03b3\u03b6 that does not explicitly rely on a truncation of the \u03b1s expansion always requires calculation of the full bz dependence of lattice beam functions. When the series expansion in \u03b1s is utilized, a broader range of extraction techniques are possible, see for example ref. [45]. Next we consider the use of the MHENS correlator for obtaining x-dependent information about Collins TMDs. There are two complications in this case relative to the use of\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nquasi-TMDs. The first is that the MHENS staple-shaped Wilson line path for the beam functions has non-trivial cusp angles \u03b3(v, b), which from eq. (2.6) is given by\ncosh[\u03b3(v, b)] = \u00b1 v \u00b7 b |v||b| , (3.42)\nwhere the sign is determined by \u00b1 = sign(\u03b7\u0303). For bz 6= 0 we have v \u00b7 b 6= 0, and the UV renormalization factor ZMHENSuv will depend on \u03b3(v, b) irrespective of whether or not we extrapolate towards infinitely long staples, |\u03b7\u0303| \u2192 \u221e. This complicates the analysis because the UV renormalization is now bz dependent and hence will not cancel in ratios formed from correlators with the same x. The second complication for x-dependent MHENS calculations is that the length of the Wilson line path becomes bz-dependent, since using eq. (2.5) we have\nLMHENSstaple = 2|\u03b7\u0303v|+ |b| . (3.43)\nThis implies that if we do a Fourier transform in b \u00b7 P to obtain x-dependent correlators, then the power law dependence on the staple length does not cancel for ratios taken at finite \u03b7\u0303, where the |b| term can not be neglected. To make these issues more transparent, we consider the generalization of the MHENS TMD definition in eq. (3.39) that is needed to include bz-dependence. Working in an equal-time configuration with b0 = 0 and v0 = 0 that is suitable for lattice calculations, we expect that the definition would take the form\nf [\u0393]MHENS qi/h\n(b, \u00b5, P\u0303 , v, v\u0303) \u2261 lim a\u2192 0 |\u03b7\u0303|\u2192\u221e\nZ \u2032uv(\u00b5, \u00b5\u0303)ZMHENSuv [ a, \u00b5\u0303, v, v\u0303, \u03b3(v, b), . . . ] (3.44)\n\u00d7 N\u0393 P z \u03a6\u0303[\u0393]qi/hunsubtr.(b, P\u0303 , a, \u03b7\u0303v) \u2206\u0303 qMHENS S (b, a, \u03b7\u0303v, \u03b7\u0303v\u0303) .\nAlthough ZMHENSuv depends on the cusp angle \u03b3(v, b) this is unlikely to be a fundamental road block, since this renormalization can be carried out perturbatively (for example, four-loop results for the related cusp-anomalous dimension are now available in MS [81]). It also seems likely that a non-perturbative method of carrying out the calculation of ZMHENSuv on the lattice could also be formulated. A greater difficulty will be determining a suitable soft factor \u2206\u0303qMHENSS = (S q MHENS)\u22121/2, which itself must satisfy three non-trivial constraints. In particular, it should be constructed from a soft function SqMHENS which is a vacuum matrix element of a closed Wilson loop that has a total length 2LMHENSstaple with eq. (3.43). This ensures that the |\u03b7\u0303| \u2192 \u221e limit for f [\u0393]MHENSqi/h will exist. An additional constraint is that it should include dependence which compensates for the mismatch in the Lorentz invariants in the 12th and 13th rows of table 2. Finally, it must have the proper infrared dependence on bT such that f\u0303 [\u0393]MHENSqi/h correctly reproduces the infrared structure of the Collins TMD. This last constraint is necessary for a factorization formula relating the MHENS TMD and Collins TMD to exist. The construction of a suitable \u2206\u0303qMHENSS involves two steps: finding an operator definition for this quantity satisfying the above constraints, and then developing a method by which this factor can be computed with lattice QCD. The\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nargument v\u0303 that we have written for \u2206\u0303qMHENSS in eq. (3.44) should be a suitably chosen space-like vector. The ellipses in ZMHENSuv in eq. (3.44) denote any further arguments needed due to UV renormalization for the soft factor (like additional cusp angles). Let us assume that a suitable \u2206\u0303qMHENSS has been determined. In this case the factorization formula for the MHENS TMD to Collins TMD should take the form\nf [\u0393]MHENS qi/h\n( x,~bT , \u00b5, P\u0303 , v, v\u0303 ) \u2261 \u222b d(b \u00b7 P\u0303 )\n2\u03c0 e \u2212ix(P\u0303 \u00b7b) f [\u0393]MHENS qi/h (b, P\u0303 , \u00b5, v, v\u0303)\n= CMHENSq (xv \u00b7P\u0303 , . . . , \u00b5) exp [\n1 2\u03b3 q \u03b6 (\u00b5, bT ) ln \u03b6\u0303 \u03b6 ] f [\u0393]qi (x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6)\n\u00d7 { 1 +O [\n1( xv \u00b7P\u0303 bT )2 , \u039b2QCD( xv \u00b7P\u0303\n)2 ]} , (3.45)\nwhere based on results from the JMY scheme we expect \u03b6\u0303 = 2(xP\u0303 \u00b7 v)2 \u221a |v2||v\u03032|/(v2 v \u00b7 v\u0303). Our notation anticipates the fact that the matching coefficient CMHENSq is likely to differ from the Cq in the quasi-TMD factorization. This is expected due to the fact that the UV behavior of \u2206\u0303qMHENSS can differ from \u2206\u0303 q S , and the fact that ZMHENSuv differs from Zuv. Instead of directly trying to match the MHENS-TMD onto the Collins-TMD as in eq. (3.45), one can consider determining the x-dependence of ratios. For example, taking ratios with potentially different Dirac structures, flavors qi and qj , and hadrons h and h\u2032, but the same x and P\u0303 we have\nf [\u03931] qi/h (x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) f [\u03932] qj/h\u2032 (x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) = f [\u03931]MHENS qi/h (x,~bT , \u00b5, P\u0303 , v, v\u0303) f [\u03932]MHENS qj/h\u2032 (x,~bT , \u00b5, P\u0303 , v, v\u0303) (3.46)\n= lim a\u2192 0 |\u03b7\u0303|\u2192\u221e\n\u222b d(b \u00b7 P\u0303 ) e\u2212ix(P\u0303 \u00b7b) ZMHENSuv (a, . . .)N\u03931\u03a6\u0303 [\u03931]qi/h unsubtr.(b, P\u0303 , a, \u03b7\u0303z\u0302) \u2206\u0303\nqMHENS S (b, a, \u03b7\u0303v, \u03b7\u0303v\u0303)\u222b\nd(b \u00b7 P\u0303 ) e\u2212ix(P\u0303 \u00b7b) ZMHENSuv (a, . . .)N\u03932\u03a6\u0303 [\u03932]qj/h\u2032 unsubtr.

(3.45) the CMHENSq and CS kernel terms drop out, giving the first equality in eq. (3.46). Using eq. (3.44) then gives the second equality. For finite \u03b7\u0303 the soft factors \u2206\u0303qMHENSS (b, a, \u03b7\u0303v, \u03b7\u0303v\u0303) do not cancel out from the numerator and denominator, due to their dependence on the integration variable, namely the component of b that is parallel to P\u0303 .6 In addition the UV counterterms ZMHENSuv (a, . . . , \u03b3(b, v), . . .) depend on the integration variable through their dependence on the cusp angle \u03b3(b, v), and the dependence on these variables remains regardless of how large \u03b7\u0303 is.7 Equation (3.46) can be contrasted with the ratios involving quasi-TMDs in the first line of eq. (3.37). The situation is simpler for the quasi-TMDs because of the simpler dependence of the UV counterterm and soft factor, which cancel out in the ratios at finite \u03b7\u0303.\n6It is possible that one may be able to construct \u2206\u0303qMHENSS such that the dependence on the component b \u00b7 P\u0303 /mh is subleading as |\u03b7\u0303| \u2192 \u221e, just like it is in LMHENSstaple , in which case these soft factors can be canceled out in the ratio in eq. (3.46) as |\u03b7\u0303| \u2192 \u221e.\n7It is possible that one may be able to define the soft factor \u2206qMHENSS so as to cancel the UV dependence on the cusp angles, and thus make ZMHENSuv independent of \u03b3(b, v). However, this makes it more probable that \u2206qMHENSS will not cancel between the numerator and denominator of eq. (3.46) as |\u03b7\u0303| \u2192 \u221e.\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8"

            "text": "The central focus of this paper was to derive the factorization formula eq. (1.2) that relates the lattice-calculable quasi-TMD to physical TMD schemes through a simple perturbative matching coefficient. This formula is valid at all orders in \u03b1s up to power corrections for any light quark flavor and for gluons. We began our derivation by developing a generalized TMD notational framework applicable to both continuum and lattice TMDs, enabling us to unify various choices used in the literature and thus more easily unpack the relationships between various physical and lattice TMD schemes. Comparing the operator structures and Lorentz invariants appearing in each scheme, we observed a close relation between the Collins and quasi-TMDs. We then constructed a new continuum TMD scheme intermediate between the Collins and quasi-TMDs, which we called the large rapidity (LR) scheme. The LR and Collins schemes differ by the order of UV renormalization and the lightcone limits, so they are related by a perturbative matching in the spirit of LaMET. Meanwhile, using Lorentz invariance we showed that the quasi- and LR TMDs are equivalent. This enabled us to prove the full factorization relation between the Collins and quasi-TMDs. For any quark flavor qi and for gluons g, the relations are\nf\u0303qi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z) = Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) exp [ 1 2\u03b3 q \u03b6 (\u00b5, bT ) ln \u03b6\u0303 \u03b6 ] fqi/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) + . . . , (4.1)\nf\u0303g/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6\u0303, xP\u0303 z) = Cg(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) exp [\n1 2\u03b3 g \u03b6 (\u00b5, bT ) ln \u03b6\u0303 \u03b6\n] fg/h(x,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) + . . . , (4.2)\nwhere the ellipses indicate power corrections. The quark matching coefficient Cq and CS kernel \u03b3q\u03b6 are both independent of the quark flavor. The factorization formula has many implications. First, when matching quasi- and continuum TMDs, there is no mixing between quarks and gluons, nor is there flavor mixing. This means that lattice calculations of TMDs for various flavors and for gluons should be easier than anticipated. We confirmed the momentum renormalization-group evolution for the matching coefficient, and solved it to obtain a explicit result at NLL, confirming it agreed with earlier fixed-order results in the literature. Finally, our proof has implications for factorization formulas matching the Lorentz-invariant approach (MHENS scheme) to lattice TMDs. It implies that ratios of MHENS TMDs with b = ~bT give direct access to information about the ratio of Collins TMDs integrated against the matching coefficient Cq(xP\u0303 z, \u00b5) in the numerator and denominator. The treatment of factorization for x-dependent ratios of MHENS correlators is a bit more complicated, and we identified the additional ingredients as being from cusp anomalous dimensions in the lattice renormalization and the need for a different soft factor subtraction in the relation to the Collins TMD. Our results are an important step in pushing forward the knowledge we can extract from the lattice about TMD observables, yet much remains to be done. We have derived a factorization formula at leading power to all orders in \u03b1s. However, the perturbative quasito-Collins matching coefficient Cq is only known at one-loop, except for certain logarithmic terms constrained by its RGE, see section 3.2.2. Recently there has been renewed interest\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nin TMDs at subleading power, with for example a derivation of the necessary form of the factorization formula for polarized SIDIS at subleading power [82, 83]. Finding continuumto-lattice factorization formulas for subleading power TMDs would be interesting. As experiments come online that promise to push our knowledge of hadronic structure to new depths, the need for corresponding first-principles predictions becomes ever more clear. The challenges faced in calculating TMDs on the lattice give us a roadmap for efficiently deriving other key hadronic properties. Constructing a generic operator encompassing all possible physical and lattice scheme choices for a specific distribution is useful for understanding the space of possibilities. Comparing the quasi-to-Collins and MHENSto-Collins factorizations, we see that we must walk a fine line between perturbative and numerical challenges when choosing a lattice observable. From the lattice standpoint, unless headway is made on the sign problem, matrix element correlators from which distributions are constructed must employ Wilson lines on equal-time paths. Wilson lines should have as few sides and cusps as possible to minimize difficulties with renormalization. From the start, it is also important to account for lattice renormalization, soft function subtractions, and finite Wilson line lengths. One must also be careful with different orders of limits and renormalization, which can often lead to additional perturbative matching kernels. In the case of TMDs specifically, it is clear from the phase space of possible lattice correlators that there are additional freedoms in the definitions that could still be exploited. Quasi-TMDs and MHENS TMDs provide two examples of how things can differ due to these choices, and we have advocated for some of the benefits of the quasi-TMD approach. The calculation of MHENS TMDs has an excellent track record, and it will be important to continue to carry out calculations with various lattice TMDs, and confirm consistency amongst the results. Ultimately, this program has the potential to lead to precise determinations of the full functional dependence of the eight leading-power spin-dependent TMDs."

            "text": "A.1 Matching unpolarized quark TMDs in different schemes at NLO\nIn this section, we perturbatively test our results from section 3 by first constructing the matching between the Collins and JMY TMDs at next-to-leading order (NLO), and then deriving the same matching between the Collins and LR TMDs. The latter immediately yields the matching between the quasi- and Collins TMDs.\nA.1.1 Matching Collins and JMY TMDs\nWe first relate the Collins and JMY TMDs. Since the physical cross-section is schemeindependent, we have\nd\u03c3 dQ2dY d2~qT\n(A.1)\n= \u03c30 \u2211 i,j Hij(Q,\u00b5) \u222b d2~bT (2\u03c0)2 e i~qT \u00b7~bT fi/h1 ( x1,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b61 ) fj/h2 ( x2,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b62 ) = \u03c30\n\u2211 i,j Hij(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) \u222b d2~bT (2\u03c0)2 e i~qT \u00b7~bT fJMYi/h1 ( x1,~bT , \u00b5, x1\u03b6v, \u03c1 ) fJMYj/h2 ( x2,~bT , \u00b5, x2\u03b6v\u0303, \u03c1 ) ,\nwhere the first and second lines employ the Collins and JMY schemes as given in eqs. (2.15) and (2.21), respectively. We want to choose a frame where the TMDs appear symmetrically, such that there is no CS evolution from an asymmetric split of soft radiation. This can be ensured by choosing \u03b61 = \u03b62 and x1\u03b6v = x2\u03b6v\u0303, which using their definitions implies8\n\u03b61 = \u03b62 = Q2 , (x1\u03b6v)2 = (x2\u03b6v\u0303)2 = \u03c1Q2 . (A.2)\nThe last equality fixing \u03c1 results from the definition in eq. (2.23). Eq. (A.1) then implies\nfJMYi/h ( x1, bT , \u00b5, \u221a \u03c1Q, \u03c1 ) = CJMYi (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1)fi/h ( x1, bT , \u00b5,Q 2) , (A.3) where CJMYi is a perturbative kernel which is defined as\nCJMYi (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = \u221a\nHi\u0304i(Q,\u00b5) Hi\u0304i(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) . (A.4)\nHere, we set j = i\u0304 because this relation must hold for the simplest cases of flavor-diagonal Drell-Yan scattering. The hard function is independent of quark flavor, so the matching is also flavor-independent.9 We can write an asymmetric form of eq. (A.3) using CS evolution,\nfJMYi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, \u221a \u03c1Q, \u03c1 ) = CJMYi (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) exp [ 1 2\u03b3 i \u03b6(bT , \u00b5) ln Q2 \u03b6 ] fi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b6 ) . (A.5)\n8The one-loop expressions for eq. (A.1) only agree if one fixes x1\u03b6v = x2\u03b6v\u0303. This may simply be a result of using this particular frame when calculating the NLO ingredients in ref. [56]; the factorization theorem in ref. [56] does not make a definite statement on this. For more details, see appendix B.\n9This is violated starting at three loops due to closed quark loops that couple to the vector current. In order for eq. (A.1) to be true, such contributions must precisely cancel in the ratio in eq. (A.4).\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nHere, CJMYi and \u03b3i\u03b6 differ for quarks and gluons, but do not depend on quark flavor. Appendix B verifies eq. (A.5) at one loop; here, we only show one-loop results for the hard function,\nHqq\u0304(Q,\u00b5) = 1 + \u03b1sCF\n2\u03c0\n[ \u2212 ln2 Q 2\n\u00b52 + 3 ln Q\n2\n\u00b52 + 76\u03c0\n2 \u2212 8 ]\n+O(\u03b12s) , (A.6)\nHqq\u0304(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = 1 + \u03b1sCF\n2\u03c0\n[ \u2212 ln2 Q 2\n\u00b52 + 3 ln Q\n2\n\u00b52 + ln2 \u03c1Q\n2\n\u00b52 \u2212 2 ln \u03c1Q\n2\n\u00b52 + 2\u03c02 \u2212 4\n] +O(\u03b12s) ,\nsee eqs. (B.2) and (B.12). We stress that the second line only holds in the frame defined by eq. (A.2). Inserting eq. (A.6) into eq. (A.4), we obtain the one-loop quark matching kernel\nCJMYq (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = 1 + \u03b1sCF\n2\u03c0 ( \u221212L 2 \u03c1 + L\u03c1 \u2212 5 12\u03c0 2 \u2212 2 ) +O(\u03b12s) , (A.7)\nwhere we abbreviate the logarithm as\nL\u03c1 = ln \u03c1Q2 \u00b52 = ln (2x1P1 \u00b7 v) 2 v2\u00b52 . (A.8)\nA.1.2 Matching Collins and LR/quasi TMDs\nThe LR and JMY TMDs differ only by the direction of their Wilson lines, so the LR-toCollins and JMY-to-Collins matchings should be equivalent, up to accounting for the Wilson line change. First, we make the choice\nv\u00b5 = n\u00b5B(yB) = (e 2yB , 1, 0\u22a5) , v\u0303\u00b5 = n\u00b5A(yn) = (1, e \u22122yn , 0\u22a5) , (A.9)\nwhich are the timelike versions of the Wilson line directions defining the LR scheme; we will address the continuation to the spacelike case soon. Note that here, yn is a parameter in the LR scheme, not in Collins scheme. Also note that v\u0303 does not obey the hierarchy v\u0303+ v\u0303\u2212 assumed in the JMY scheme. As long as we only consider the v-collinear TMD, this does not matter, as the hierarchy v\u2212 v+ ensures the validity of the expressions for \u03b6v and \u03c1 as given in eq. (2.23),\n(x1\u03b6v)2 = (2x1P1 \u00b7 v)2 v2 = ( \u221a 2x1P+1 e\u2212yB )2 , \u03c12 = 4(v \u00b7 v\u0303)2 v2v\u03032 = e2(yn\u2212yB) . (A.10)\nSo far, yB and yn are not fixed, as the LR scheme is well defined as long as \u2212yB 1. However, to use the results that can be perturbatively matched to the physical scheme in appendix A.1.1, we have to work in the symmetric frame as specified by eq. (A.2), namely (x1\u03b6v)2 = \u03c1Q2. Thus, we find\n\u03c1 = eyn\u2212yB != (x1\u03b6v) 2\nQ2 = e2(Y\u2212yB) \u21d2 yn = 2Y \u2212 yB , (A.11)\nwhere the dependence on the final-state rapidity Y arises through \u221a\n2x1P+1 = QeY . Here we choose to treat yB as the independent parameter, since it specifies the geometry of the Wilson line in the hadronic matrix element, while yn only enters through the soft function\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nand thus is considered a derived quantity. With this special choice of yn, we can make use of eq. (A.5) to obtain\nfJMYi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, x1\u03b6v, \u03c1 ) = CJMYi ( Q,\u00b5, \u03c1 ) fi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5,Q 2) , \u03c1 = (x1\u03b6v)2 Q2 . (A.12)\nTo obtain the corresponding result for the LR scheme, we have to replace the timelike Wilson lines in eq. (A.9) by spacelike ones,\nv\u00b5 = (e2yB , 1, 0\u22a5) \u2192 (\u2212e2yB , 1, 0\u22a5) , v\u0303\u00b5 = (1, e\u22122yn , 0\u22a5)\u2192 (1,\u2212e\u22122yn , 0\u22a5) . (A.13)\nThe Lorentz invariants in eq. (A.10) then change to\n\u03b62v = (2P1 \u00b7 v)2 v2 \u2192 \u2212(2P1 \u00b7 v) 2 |v2| = \u2212|\u03b62v | , \u03c1 = (x1\u03b6v)2 Q2 \u2192 \u2212|\u03c1| . (A.14)\nNote that the sign change of \u03c1 is not directly obvious from eq. (A.10), which only fixes \u03c12, but immediately follows from eq. (A.11). Applying these transformations to eq. (A.12), we obtain the matching between the LR and Collins scheme,\nfLRi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b6 = Q2, yP \u2212 yB ) = CLRi ( Q,\u00b5, \u03c1 ) fi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b6 = Q2 ) , (A.15)\nwhere fLRi/h arises from the appropriate analytic continuation of the JMY TMD at operator level. Due to the symmetry constraints both TMDs are evaluated at \u03b6 = Q2, and the matching coefficient is given by\nCLRi (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = CJMYi (Q,\u00b5,\u2212\u03c1) . (A.16)\nSince CJMYi depends on \u03c1 only through L\u03c1 = ln(\u03c1Q2/\u00b52), we need to analytically continue \u03c1 to \u2212\u03c1 to make use of eq. (A.16),\nL\u03c1 = ln \u03c1Q2\n\u00b52 \u2192 L\u2212\u03c1 = ln\n\u2212\u03c1Q2\n\u00b52 = L|\u03c1| \u00b1 i\u03c0 . (A.17)\nThe sign of this phase induced by the spacelike v2 < 0 cannot be easily reconstructed a posteriori, but is fixed by the i0 prescription in perturbation theory. Fortunately, we do not need to fix this sign for our purpose, as the hard function is the squared magnitude of a complex amplitude, so at NLO we deduce that the spacelike version of eq. (A.7) is\nCLRq ( Q,\u00b5, \u03c1 ) = 1 + \u03b1sCF2\u03c0 < ( \u221212(L|\u03c1| \u00b1 i\u03c0) 2 + (L|\u03c1| \u00b1 i\u03c0)\u2212 5 12\u03c0 2 \u2212 2 ) +O(\u03b12s)\n= 1 + \u03b1sCF4\u03c0\n( \u2212L2|\u03c1| + 2L|\u03c1| + \u03c02 6 \u2212 4 ) +O(\u03b12s) . (A.18)\nUsing eq. (A.11), the logarithm can be expressed as\nL|\u03c1| = ln |\u03c1|Q2 \u00b52 = ln (2x1P1 \u00b7 v) 2 |v2|\u00b52 . (A.19)\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nTo complete our derivation, we first replace Q2 with \u03b6, corresponding to a simple relabelling, and employ that the hard coefficient only depends on the combination\n\u03c1Q2 = (2x1P1 \u00b7 v) 2\n|v2| = e2(yn\u2212yB)\u03b6 = x2m2he2(yP\u2212yB) \u2248 \u03b6LR , (A.20)\nwhere the \u2248 indicates equality for the large \u2212yB limit. We can then rewrite eq. (A.12) as\nfLRi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b6, yP \u2212 yB ) = Ci(\u03b6LR, \u00b5 ) fi/h ( x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b6 ) , (A.21)\nwhere \u03b6LR is given by eq. (3.24) and we have defined\nCi(\u03c1Q2, \u00b5) = CLRi ( Q,\u00b5, \u03c1 ) . (A.22)\nEq. (A.21) reproduces eq. (3.26), with the one-loop conversion given by eq. (A.18). This provides a one-loop confirmation of one of the key parts of our all orders factorization analysis. For the quasi-TMD, where v = (0, 0, 0, 1) and \u03b6LR = (2xP\u0303 z)2, eq. (A.18) exactly reproduces the matching coefficient for quasi-TMD obtained in refs. [35, 37]; see also refs. [34, 49] for an independent calculation.\nA.2 NLO results for quark-gluon mixing\nWe next calculate quark-gluon mixing in TMDs and quasi-TMDs at O(\u03b1s). We work in coordinate space to obtain matrix elements as a function of the Lorentz invariants b2 and p \u00b7 b, where p\u00b5 is the on-shell momentum of the external parton (p2 = 0). As expected from the factorization theorem, the TMD and quasi-TMD will turn out to be identical at fixed b2 and p \u00b7 b, so there is no mixing.\nA.2.1 Mixing of quarks into gluon distributions\nWe first study mixing of quarks into gluon distributions. At O(\u03b1s), we have two Feynman diagrams, shown in figure 5. These diagrams do not suffer from a rapidity divergence, so we can work without a rapidity regulator. For the quasi-TMD, we take \u03b7\u0303 \u2192\u221e. In figure 5, the Feynman rule for the insertion of gluon field strength tensor in the gluon beam function in eq. (2.7) is\nG\u00b5\u03bda (b) \u03b1, a\u2032\nk = (\u2212ik\u00b5g\u03bd\u03b1 + ik\u03bdg\u00b5\u03b1)\u03b4aa\u2032e\u2212ik\u00b7b . (A.23)\nTherefore, the two diagrams have values\nf\u00b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03c3a (b, p) = \u00b52 0 \u222b ddk (2\u03c0)d u\u0304(p)(ig\u03b3\u03b1\u03c4 a)\u2212i k2 ( ik\u03c1g\u00b5\u03b1 \u2212 ik\u00b5g\u03c1\u03b1 ) eik\u00b7b i /p\u2212 /k\n\u00d7 ( \u2212 ik\u03c3g\u03bd\u03b2 + ik\u03bdg\u03c3\u03b2 )\u2212i k2 eik\u00b70(ig\u03b3\u03b2\u03c4a)u(p) , (A.24)\nf\u00b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03c3b (b, p) = \u00b5 2 0 \u222b ddk (2\u03c0)d u\u0304(p)(ig\u03b3\u03b1\u03c4 a)\u2212i k2 ( ik\u03c3g\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 ik\u03bdg\u03c3\u03b2 ) eik\u00b70 i /p\u2212 /k\n\u00d7 ( \u2212 ik\u03c1g\u00b5\u03b2 + ik\u00b5g\u03c1\u03b2 )\u2212i k2 e\u2212ik\u00b7b(ig\u03b3\u03b2\u03c4a)u(p) .

[40] we define the integral Iv(b2, p \u00b7 b) = \u22124i\u00b52 0 \u222b ddk (2\u03c0)d\u22122 eik\u00b7b k4(p\u2212 k)2 = \u2212 (\u03c0\u00b520) 4 \u0393(\u22121\u2212 ) 1 + ip\u00b7b\u2212 eip\u00b7b (p\u00b7b)2 (\u2212b 2)1+ .\n(A.27)\nLet us examine the first derivative of Iv(b) for use in eq. (A.26),\n\u2202\u03b1Iv(b2, p \u00b7 b) = 2b\u03b1 \u2202Iv \u2202(b2) + p \u03b1 \u2202Iv \u2202(p \u00b7 b) . (A.28)\nEventually, we will need to specify the directions associated with free Lorentz indices (na, nb, n\u0302\u22a5). Doing so early on streamlines our work with power counting. Examining all derivative terms that arise when we contract indices relevant at leading power, we have\nna \u00b7 \u2202 Iv(b2, p \u00b7 b) = 2na \u00b7 b \u2202Iv \u2202(b2) , nb \u00b7 \u2202 Iv(b2, p \u00b7 b) = nb \u00b7 p \u2202Iv\n\u2202(p \u00b7 b) ,\n\u2202\u03b1\u22a5Iv(b2, p \u00b7 b) = 2b\u03b1\u22a5 \u2202Iv \u2202(b2) . (A.29)\nQuasi-TMD factorization gives us p \u00b7 b \u223c 1, 1/b2T (nb \u00b7 p)2, and na \u00b7 b |bT |. This leads to a power counting of (\nnb \u00b7 \u2202, na \u00b7 \u2202, \u2202\u22a5 ) \u223c ( 1, \u03bb2, \u03bb)nb \u00b7 p , (A.30)\nwhere \u03bb \u223c 1/ ( bT nb \u00b7 p ) 1. This is the same power counting as for the momenta of particles created by n-collinear fields in SCET [84\u201387]. We now obtain leading-power results. We start with the TMDs, for which we must contract \u00b5 and \u03bd with n\u00b5b and n\u03bdb , as well as take \u03c1, \u03c3 to be transverse Lorentz indices:\nf n\u0304\u03c3\u22a5n\u0304\u03c1\u22a5a = \u03b1sCF 4\u03c0 Tr [ \u03b3\u03b1(/p+i/\u2202)\u03b3\u03b2 /p 2 ] (n\u03b1b \u2202 \u03c1 \u22a5\u2212g \u03c1\u03b1 \u22a5 nb \u00b7\u2202) ( n\u03b2b \u2202 \u03c3 \u22a5\u2212g \u03c3\u03b2 \u22a5 nb \u00b7\u2202 ) Iv(b) ,\nf n\u0304\u03c3\u22a5n\u0304\u03c1\u22a5b = \u03b1sCF 4\u03c0 Tr [ \u03b3\u03b1(/p\u2212i/\u2202)\u03b3\u03b2 /p 2 ] (n\u03b1b \u2202\u03c3\u22a5\u2212g\u03c3\u03b1\u22a5 nb \u00b7\u2202) ( n\u03b2b \u2202 \u03c1 \u22a5\u2212g \u03c1\u03b2 \u22a5 nb \u00b7\u2202 ) Iv(\u2212b) . (A.31)\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nThe Dirac traces lead to the following tensor structures\ng\u03b1\u03b2 p \u00b7 \u2202, p\u03b1p\u03b2 , p\u03b1\u2202\u03b2 + p\u03b2\u2202\u03b1 . (A.32)\nWhen we contract the indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 with the remaining parts of each Feynman diagram, both diagrams have a nonvanishing contribution at leading power of order\np \u00b7 \u2202(nb \u00b7 \u2202)2g\u03c1\u03c3\u22a5 \u223c (nb \u00b7 p) 2\u2202\u03c1\u22a5\u2202 \u03c3 \u22a5 \u223c O ( \u03bb2(nb \u00b7 p)4 ) . (A.33)\nTo obtain the corresponding quasi-TMDs, we contract \u00b5 and \u03bd with n\u0304\u00b51 and n\u0304\u03bd2 , and we take \u03c1, \u03c3 to be transverse Lorentz indices. Here we are free to pick each of n\u03041 and n\u03042 to be in the time direction or z-direction, ie. n\u03041,2 = nt or \u2212nz.

(A.31) except for the overall factor of 1/2. After taking into account the Fourier transform in the definition of the quasi-TMDs in eq. (2.29), this 1/2 factor is cancelled by the change of the integration measure, so the results are equal between quasi- and Collins TMDs in this channel.\nA.2.2 Mixing of gluons into quark distributions\nNext, we consider the mixing of gluons into quark distributions. This process first receives corrections at O(\u03b1s), as shown in figure 6. The sum of these diagrams yields\nf\u03c1\u03c3c+d = ig 2TF \u03b4\nab \u222b ddk (2\u03c0)dTr [ \u03931 /k \u03b3\u03c1\u22a5 1 /p\u2212 /k \u03b3\u03c3\u22a5 1 /k ] [ e\u2212ik\u00b7b + eik\u00b7b ] , (A.36)\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03c3 are transverse Lorentz indices because they contract with on-shell gluon polarization vectors. fc+d reduces to a form expressible in terms of derivatives of Iv(b):\nf\u03c1\u03c3c+d = \u03b1sTF \u03b4\nab 4\u03c0 { Tr [ \u0393/\u2202\u03b3\u03c1\u22a5(/p+ i/\u2202)\u03b3 \u03c3 \u22a5/\u2202 ] Iv(b) + Tr [ \u0393/\u2202\u03b3\u03c1\u22a5(/p\u2212 i/\u2202)\u03b3 \u03c3 \u22a5/\u2202 ] Iv(\u2212b) } . (A.37)\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nTo obtain the TMD, we take \u0393 = /nb. The trace in eq.

The contribution from na/ \u221a 2 is once again suppressed by O(\u03bb2). Therefore, after Fourier transform we find that mixing graphs in figure 6 have identical values for the TMD and quasi-TMD at the same p \u00b7 b and b2."

We first collect perturbative results in both schemes and then compare them to one other.\nB.1 NLO results in the Collins scheme\nThe Drell-Yan hard function can be obtained from the corresponding vector form factor, which is known to three loops [88\u201396]. At one loop, we have\nHqq\u0304(Q,\u00b5) = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 H (1) qq\u0304 (Q,\u00b5) +O(\u03b12s) ,\nH (1) qq\u0304 (Q,\u00b5) = \u2212 ln2\nQ2\n\u00b52 + 3 ln Q\n2\n\u00b52 + 76\u03c0 2 \u2212 8 .

(B.4)\nAt one loop, the quark-to-quark kernel reads\nC(1)qq (x,bT ,\u00b5,\u03b6) =\u2212LbPqq(x)+(1\u2212x)+\u03b4(1\u2212x) [ \u221212L 2 b+Lb ( 3 2 +ln \u00b52 \u03b6 ) \u2212\u03c0 2 12 ] , (B.5)\nwhere we use the standard expressions\nPqq(x) = [ 1 + x2\n1\u2212 x ] + , Lb = ln b2T\u00b5 2 b20 (B.6)\nfor the quark-quark splitting kernel and the standard logarithm, respectively.\nB.2 NLO results in the JMY scheme\nRef. [56] calculates the JMY hard function and TMD at NLO using a version of MS in which one absorbs the factor SJMY = (4\u03c0) /\u0393(1 \u2212 ) in the subtraction, as opposed to the standard scheme with SMS = (4\u03c0e\u2212\u03b3E ) . These schemes only begin to differ at O( 2), so there is no impact on one-loop calculations, which have a single pole in . (It does affect on-lightcone calculations, for which the bare hard function and TMD have double poles.) Ref. [56] examined SIDIS, whereas we consider Drell-Yan; thus we must analytically continue from q2 = \u2212Q2 < 0 (SIDIS) to q2 = Q2 > 0 (Drell-Yan).\nIn this section, we abbreviate\nLv = ln (x1\u03b6v)2\n\u00b52 , Lv\u0303 = ln\n(x2\u03b6v\u0303)2\n\u00b52 . (B.7)\nUsing eq. (2.23) and noting that \u03b62v\u03b62v\u0303 = E4cm\u03c12, where E2cm = (P1 + P2)2, we have\nLv + Lv\u0303 = 2 ln Q2\n\u00b52 + ln \u03c12 , (B.8)\nwhere Q2 = x1x2E2cm is the invariant mass of the produced color-singlet final state. We expand the hard function in the JMY scheme similar to eq. (B.2) as\nHqq\u0304(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 H (1) qq\u0304 (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) +O(\u03b12s) . (B.9)\nThe NLO result in SIDIS kinematics is given by [56]\nH SIDIS(1) qq\u0304 (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = (1 + ln \u03c12) ln\nQ2\n\u00b52 \u2212 ln \u03c12 + 14 ln 2 \u03c12 + \u03c02 \u2212 4\n= \u2212 ln2 Q 2\n\u00b52 + 3 ln Q\n2\n\u00b52 + 14(Lv + Lv\u0303) 2 \u2212 (Lv + Lv\u0303) + \u03c02 \u2212 4 , (B.10)\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nwhere in the second line we used eq. (B.8). To recover the corresponding result for Drell-Yan, we need to analytically continue Q2 \u2192 \u2212Q2, which is achieved by\nln2 Q 2\n\u00b52 = <\n[ ln2 \u2212q\n2 \u2212 i0 \u00b52 ] q2=\u2212Q2 \u2192 < [ ln2 \u2212q 2 \u2212 i0 \u00b52 ] q2=+Q2 = ln2 Q 2 \u00b52 \u2212 \u03c02 . (B.11)\nThe single logarithm of Q2 is unaffected, as are logarithms of the fixed parameters v2 and v\u03032. Applying this to eq. (B.10), we obtain the Drell-Yan hard function in the JMY scheme,\nH (1) qq\u0304 (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) = \u2212 ln2\nQ2\n\u00b52 + 3 ln Q\n2\n\u00b52 + 14(Lv + Lv\u0303) 2 \u2212 (Lv + Lv\u0303) + 2\u03c02 \u2212 4 . (B.12)\nIn ref. [56] the TMD was originally defined as qi = Bi/S, which is distinguished from the definition fi = Bi/ \u221a S in eq. (2.24). Both qi and fi can be matched onto collinear PDFs similar to eq.

We expand both in the same fashion as eq. (B.4), and the one-loop result of C\u0303ij can be read off from ref. [56] as\nC\u0303(1)qq (x, bT , \u00b5, x\u03b6v, \u03c1) = \u2212LbPqq(x) + (1\u2212 x) (B.14) + \u03b4(1\u2212 x) [ \u221212 (Lb + Lv) 2 + Lb (1 2 + ln \u03c1 2 ) + Lv \u2212 2\u2212 \u03c02 2 ] .\nTo obtain the result for C(1)ij , we first need the one-loop result for the soft function [56]\nS(bT , \u00b5, \u03c1) = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 S (1)(bT , \u00b5, \u03c1) +O(\u03b12s) , S(1)(bT , \u00b5, \u03c1) = (2\u2212 ln \u03c12)Lb . (B.15)\nUsing the relation between qi and fi, we then obtain\nC(1)qq (x, bT , \u00b5, x\u03b6v, \u03c1) = C\u0303(1)qq (x, bT , \u00b5, x\u03b6v, \u03c1) + 1 2S (1)(bT , \u00b5, \u03c1)\n= \u2212LbPqq(x) + (1\u2212 x) (B.16) + \u03b4(1\u2212 x) [ \u221212 (Lb + Lv) 2 + Lb (3 2 + 1 2 ln \u03c1 2 ) + Lv \u2212 2\u2212 \u03c02 2 ] .\nB.3 Comparison at NLO\nUsing eqs. (B.3) and (B.13), at the perturbative level we recast eq. (B.1) as\n1 != Hij(Q,\u00b5)Cii \u2032(y1,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b61)Cjj\u2032(y2,~bT , \u00b5, \u03b62)\nHij(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1)Cii\u2032(y1,~bT , \u00b5, x1\u03b6v, \u03c1)Cjj\u2032(y2,~bT , \u00b5, x2\u03b6v\u0303, \u03c1) , (B.17)\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nwhere i, j are flavors of the underlying Born processes; i\u2032, j\u2032 are flavors summed over in eqs. (B.3) and (B.13); and y1,2 are the corresponding convolution variables. We restrict our attention to the qq channel, using eqs. (B.2) and (B.5) for the numerator and eqs. (B.12) and (B.16) for the denominator:\n1 != 1 + \u03b1sCF2\u03c0\n[ Lb ln Q4\n\u03b61\u03b62 + 14 (Lv \u2212 Lv\u0303)\n2 ]\n+O(\u03b12s) . (B.18)\nEquality of schemes enforces the conditions\n\u03b61\u03b62 = Q4 and Lv = Lv\u0303 . (B.19)\nThe first constraint on the CS scale is trivially obeyed by eq. (2.16), while the latter is a nontrivial restriction of JMY Wilson line paths. This implies that the one-loop results given in ref. [56] are only valid in the reference frame where eq. (B.19) is fulfilled. It may be possible to get a more generic result for the hard function without requiring Lv = Lv\u0303.\nFrom eq. (B.7), we see that eq. (B.19) is equivalent to x1\u03b6v = x2\u03b6v\u0303, which implies that\nv+v\u0303+ v\u2212v\u0303\u2212 = ( x1P + 1\nx2P \u2212 2\n)2 = e4Y , \u03c1 = \u03b6v\u03b6v\u0303\nE2cm = (x1\u03b6v)\n2\nQ2 = (x2\u03b6v\u0303)\n2\nQ2 , (B.20)\nwhere E2cm = (P1 + P2)2 = 2P+1 P \u2212 2 , and Q2 = x1x2E2cm and Y are the invariant mass and rapidity of the final state, respectively. It is also instructive to compare ratios of hard functions and TMDs in the two schemes. For the hard function, from eqs. (B.12) and (B.2) we obtain\u221a HDY(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) HDY(Q,\u00b5) = 1 + \u03b1sCF2\u03c0 [1 8(Lv + Lv\u0303) 2 \u2212 12(Lv + Lv\u0303) + 5 12\u03c0 2 + 2 ] +O(\u03b12s)\n(B.19)= 1 + \u03b1sCF2\u03c0 [1 2L 2 v \u2212 Lv + 5 12\u03c0 2 + 2 ] +O(\u03b12s) . (B.21)\nIn the second step, we used Lv = Lv\u0303 as required by eq. (B.19). For the TMDs, comparing eqs. (B.16) and (B.5) yields\nCqq(x1, bT , \u00b5, x1\u03b6v, \u03c1) Cqq(x1, bT , \u00b5, \u03b61) = 1 + \u03b1sCF2\u03c0\n[ Lb ln\n\u03c1\u03b61 x21\u03b6 2 v\n\u2212 (1\n2L 2 v \u2212 Lv + 5 12\u03c0\n2 + 2 )]\n+O(\u03b12s) .\n(B.22)\nNote that the bT -independent terms are exactly the negative of those in eq. (B.21). The leftover bT dependence implies that eq. (B.22) is nonperturbative when bT & \u039b\u22121QCD. However, since it is directly proportional to \u03b61 and \u03b6v, it can be eliminated for a certain choice of the evolution parameters. Demanding that the Lb term vanishes to have a perturbative relation, we obtain\n1 != \u03c1\u03b61 x21\u03b6 2 v\n= e\u22122yn \u221a v+v\u0303+\nv\u2212v\u0303\u2212 . (B.23)\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nHere, we used \u03b61 = 2(x1P+1 )2e\u22122yn . In conclusion, we find that a perturbative matching requires the specific combination\nv+v\u0303+ v\u2212v\u0303\u2212 = e4yn . (B.24)\nThe corresponding requirement for the conjugate TMD is the same as eq. (B.24). The appearance of yn in this condition is not surprising, as yn 6= 0 implies that soft radiation is not split uniformly between the two TMDs in the Collins scheme, and the same asymmetry must be reflected in the JMY scheme to obtain a perturbative relation. Note that eqs. (B.20) and (B.24) only agree if yn = Y . For this specific choice, we have that x1\u03b6v = x2\u03b6v\u0303 and \u03b61 = \u03b62 = Q2, i.e. the evolution variables appear symmetrically in both the Collins and JMY scheme. This symmetric choice was already enforced in appendix A.1.1 on more general grounds. We are interested in the matching relation between a single JMY and Collins TMD PDF, for which we now limit ourselves to the case of the n-collinear PDF. In this case, we have to use eq. (B.24) to fix the value of \u03c1 in the JMY TMD as\n\u03c12v \u2261 v\u2212 v+ v\u0303+ v\u0303\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (B.24) = [ v\u2212 v+ e2yn ]2 = (x 2 1\u03b6 2 v )2 \u03b621 . (B.25)\nAt this particular value, we have the relation\nfqi/h(x, bT , \u00b5, x\u03b6v, \u03c1v) = C JMY q (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1v) fqi/h(x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b61) , (B.26)\nwhere (at least to one loop) the matching kernel is identical to the ratios of hard functions,\nCJMYq (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1v) = \u221a\nHqq\u0304(Q,\u00b5) Hqq\u0304(Q,\u00b5, \u03c1v) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Lv=Lv\u0303\n= 1 + \u03b1sCF2\u03c0 ( \u221212L 2 v + Lv \u2212 2\u2212 5 12\u03c0 2 ) +O(\u03b12s) . (B.27)\nThe logarithm on the right-hand side is given by\nLv = ln (2xP1 \u00b7 v)2/v2\n\u00b52 = ln \u03c1vQ\n2\n\u00b52 . (B.28)\nTo obtain the final relation between the JMY and Collins TMDs at generic \u03c1 and \u03b6, we can use the \u03b6 evolution to obtain\nfi(x, bT , \u00b5, x\u03b6v, \u03c1) = CJMYi (Q,\u00b5, \u03c1) exp [\n1 2\u03b3 i \u03b6(\u00b5, bT ) ln (x\u03b6v)2/\u03c1 \u03b6\n] fi(x, bT , \u00b5, \u03b6) . (B.29)\nTo obtain this result we have replaced \u03b61 using eq. (B.25), which allows us to express the result using a generic value of \u03c1. The scheme conversion relation in eq. (B.29) can be compared to the factorization formula relating the quasi-TMD and Collins TMD in eq. (3.27), which has a very similar form.\n\u2013 43 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8"

            "text": "A key consideration for lattice TMDs is the cancellation of Wilson line self-energies. Here, we examine the self-energy of the Wilson staple in eq. (2.4). Using the auxiliary field formalism, the renormalization of an open, piecewise-smooth Wilson loop reads [107]\nW ren[\u03b3] = Z\u22121z e\u2212\u03b4mz` [\u220f i Z\u22121z\u0304z (\u03b3i) ] W bare[\u03b3] , (C.1)\nwhere Zz and Zz\u0304z are counterterms for the linear and quadratic operators of the auxiliary z field, \u03b4mz is the mass counterterm, ` is the length of the Wilson loop, and the product runs over all cusps \u03b3i arising on the Wilson line path \u03b3. The cusp angles are given by\ncosh \u03b3i = pi \u00b7 qi\u221a p2i q 2 i , (C.2)\nwhere pi and qi are the unit vectors at the cusp. In the Euclidean case, one has\n\u03b3i = i\u03b4i , cos \u03b4i = ~pi \u00b7 ~qi |~pi||~qi| . (C.3)\nAt one loop in the MS scheme and in Feynman gauge, the counterterms are [107]\nZz = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 1 +O(\u03b12s) ,\nZz\u0304z(\u03b3 = i\u03b4) = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 1 (1\u2212 \u03b4 cot \u03b4) +O(\u03b12s) . (C.4)\nHere, we take \u03b4 \u2208 [0, \u03c0); straight angles \u03b4 = \u03c0 are mapped back onto \u03b4 = 0, where Zz\u0304z = 1. For two-loop results, see ref. [108]. \u03b4m vanishes in dimensional regularization with the MS scheme, but is important to take into account on the lattice. We now restrict our discussion to purely Euclidean paths, with vanishing time component. The Wilson loop in eq. (2.4) has total length and cusp angles\n`A = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b7~v \u2212 ~\u03b42 \u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u2223~b\u2212 ~\u03b4\u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b7~v + ~\u03b42 \u2223\u2223\u2223\ncos \u03b41 = ( \u03b7~v \u2212 ~\u03b42 ) \u00b7 (~\u03b4 \u2212~b)\u2223\u2223\u03b7~v \u2212 ~\u03b42 \u2223\u2223|~\u03b4 \u2212~b| , cos \u03b42 = \u2212 ( \u03b7~v + ~\u03b42 ) \u00b7 (~\u03b4 \u2212~b)\u2223\u2223\u03b7~v + ~\u03b42 \u2223\u2223|~\u03b4 \u2212~b| , (C.5)\nwith the appropriate mapping into [0, \u03c0). By construction, \u03b41 + \u03b42 = \u03c0, as seen in figure 2. At one loop in the MS scheme, it follows that the self-energy is\nZA = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 1 [3\u2212 \u03b41 cot \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42 cot \u03b42] +O(\u03b12s) . (C.6)\nQuasi-beam function. Using ~\u03b4 = (0, 0, bz) and \u03b7\u0303~v = (0, 0, \u03b7\u0303) from eq. (2.30), we have\n`A = 2\u03b7\u0303 + bT , \u03b41 = \u03b42 = \u03c0 2 , ZA = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 3 +O(\u03b12s) . (C.7)\nThis UV divergence agrees with the result of the one-loop calculation in ref. [36]. Furthermore, we see that ZA is independent of any kinematic variables, as the staple was constructed to involve only perpendicular angles. The mass divergence \u03b4mz`A is independent of bz due to our choice of having the staple sides have lengths \u03b7 \u00b1 bz/2, such that bz dependence cancels in the sum.\n\u2013 44 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 8\nMHENS scheme. The MHENS scheme in eq. (2.39) has arbitrary ~v and ~\u03b4 = 0, so\n`\u22a5 = 2\u03b7|~v|+ \u221a b2T + (bz)2 , cos \u03b41,2 = \u2213\n~v \u00b7~b |~v||~b| . (C.8)\nFor illustration, we make the simplification ~vT = 0, which gives\n`\u22a5 = 2\u03b7|vz|+ \u221a b2T + (bz)2 , \u03b41 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b42 = tan\n\u22121 bT |bz| ,\nZA = 1 + \u03b1sCF 2\u03c0 1\n[ 3\u2212 2 |b\nz| bT\n( tan\u22121 bT\n|bz| \u2212 \u03c02\n)] +O(\u03b12s) . (C.9)\nWe see here bz-dependence of the Wilson line self-energy, which must be removed by a bz-dependent counterterm.\nOpen Access.
