    "abstractText": "Candida albicans is a human pathogen that is part of the healthy microbiome. However, it is often associated with opportunistic fungal infections. The treatment of these infections is challenging because prolonged exposure to antifungal drugs can culminate in fungal resistance during therapy, and there is a limited number of available drugs. Therefore, this study investigated the antifungal activity of ononin by in silico and in vitro assays, and in Tenebrio molitor as an alternative in vivo model of infection caused by C. albicans. Ononin is an isoflavone glycoside derived from formononetin that has various biological activities. According in silico evaluation, ononin showed the best electron affinity in molecular docking with CaCYP51, with a binding free energy of \u221210.89 kcal/mol, superior to that of the antifungal drugs fluconazole and posaconazole. The ononin + CaCYP51 complex formed hydrogen bonds with Tyr132, Ser378, Phe380, and Met508, as well as hydrophobic connections with Tyr118, Leu121, Phe126, Leu131, Ile304, and Leu309, and interactions with the heme group. Ononin exerted anti-Candida albicans activity, with MIC between 3.9 and 7.8 \u03bcg/mL, and inhibited young and mature biofilms, with a reduction in cell density and metabolic activity of 50 to 80%. The compound was not cytotoxic to sheep red blood cells at concentrations up to 1000 \u03bcg/mL. Larvae of the mealworm T. molitor were used as an alternative in vivo model of C. albicans infection. Ononin was able to prolong larval survival at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg, and was not toxic up to a concentration of 20 mg/kg. Moreover, ononin reduced the fungal charge in treated animals. In conclusion, our results suggest that ononin has anti-Candida albicans activity and is a potential candidate for the development of new therapeutic alternatives.",

In most immunocompetent individuals, this fungus lives in harmony with other members of the microbiota [1]. Certain situations, such as pH and nutritional\nMetabolites 2022, 12, 1014. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12111014 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2022, 12, 1014 2 of 20\nalterations, antibiotic use, and immune suppression (patients receiving chemotherapy or patients with AIDS) can trigger proliferation of the fungus and give rise to infections that can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe infections whose mortality rates are higher than 40% [2,3]. A common treatment for these infections is the administration of a broad-spectrum antifungal agent. Among the antimicrobials destined for this purpose, azoles are by far the most widely used, both in isolation [3,4] or in synergism with other drugs and compounds [5]. These antifungal agents act by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which is encoded by the ERG11 gene and converts lanosterol to ergosterol [3,5,6]. This enzyme contains an iron protoporphyrin complex (heme group) in its active site. This group is dependent on cytochrome P450, a key enzyme in the synthesis of sterols. Azoles bind to the iron of protoporphyrin and block the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, with the consequent accumulation of 14\u03b1-methylated sterols that are toxic and inhibit fungal growth and replication [6]. Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to antifungal agents, especially those of the azole class, can culminate in fungal resistance [6]. In addition, C. albicans can form highly structured biofilms that contain yeast-like cells, pseudohyphae, and hyphae embedded in an extracellular matrix. These biofilms are known to develop on abiotic and biotic surfaces, and are difficult to control [2,7]. Candida biofilms can colonize implanted medical devices such as catheters, pacemakers, heart valves, and prostheses, and can form on host surfaces such as mucosae, epithelial cell linings, and parenchymatous organs [3,8]. Furthermore, conventional antifungal drugs can cause various adverse effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, skin rash, and hepatotoxicity [9]. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of C. albicans infections are urgently needed. In a study conducted by our research group [10], the hydroethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of Platonia insignis Mart. exhibited antifungal activity. Platonia insignis (Clusiaceae family) is a species of the genus Platonia, and is popularly known as \u201cbacurizeiro\u201d in the Brazilian Amazon region, where it is possible to find high densities of this tree [9]. The main compounds identified by LC-ESI-IT-MS were quinic acid, ononin, orientin, vitexin, and fukugentin. Ononin is an isoflavone glycoside derived from formononetin that has various biological activities. This compound has been identified in several plant species, including the stem of Millettia nitida var. hirsutissima [11], rhizomes and roots of Smilax scobinicaulis [12], roots of Astragali radix [13], and leaves of Platonia insignis Mart. [10], and is one of the major isoflavonoids. Different biological activities of ononin have been reported, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-pulmonary fibrosis properties [14\u201318], as well as in vivo anti-inflammatory activity [19]. Furthermore, ononin exerts antibacterial activity [20,21], including activity against Escherichia coli [22]; however, there are no studies describing its antifungal activity. There are several software that facilitate the analysis of possible drugs, thus they may contribute to identify new therapeutic drugs [6]. Molecular docking (MD) is a method that can predict the orientation of a ligand to its receptor (protein) to form a stable complex. However, we found no MD studies that established the binding mode of ononin in the active site of CYP51, the target of antifungal azoles. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that ononin, a substance present in P. insignis extract, is associated with the antifungal effect. Based on this, the present study investigated the antifungal activity of ononin by in silico and in vitro assays, and in Tenebrio molitor as an alternative in vivo model of infection caused by Candida albicans. In addition, we also investigated the biological and toxicological activity of ononin in silico."

            "text": "2.3.1. Structure of the Compounds and Receptor\nA previous study from our group [10] identified the following compounds by LCESI-IT-MS in the hydroethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of Platonia insignis Mart.: quinic acid, ononin, orientin, vitexin, and fukugentin. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of these compounds were visualized with GaussView 5.0.8 [23]. The geometric and vibrational properties were calculated (optimized) in a vacuum by applying the density functional theory (DFT) method, using a combination of the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6\u201331 ++ G (d, p) basis sets. Calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 [24]. The 3D structure of C. albicans 14\u03b1-demethylase (CaCYP51) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (#5FSA), and resolved by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.86 \u00c5. The antifungal agent posaconazole present in the crystal and other molecules were removed, maintaining only one of the two homologous chains together with the heme group.\n2.3.2. Molecular Docking\nThe Autodock 4.2 package [25,26] was used for all docking procedures. The structures of CaCYP51 and of the ligands were prepared for MD calculations using AutoDock Tools (ADT), version 1.5.6 [27]. The structure of CaCYP51 was considered rigid, while that of each ligand was assumed to be flexible. The partial Gasteiger charges were calculated after the addition of all hydrogens. Nonpolar hydrogens of CaCYP51 and of the ligands were then merged. A cubic box with 80 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 80 points and spacing of 0.35 \u00c5 between grid points was generated for the entire target protein. The grid box was centered in the Fe atom of the heme group of CaCPY51. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) for global searching and the pseudo-Solis and Wets local searches were used for MD. Each ligand was submitted to 100 independent runs of docking simulations. Standard values were defined for the remaining docking parameters. The initial coordinates of the interactions between CaCYP51 metabolites and the compounds studied were chosen using as criterion the lowest energy conformation combined with visual inspection [28].\n2.3.3. Prediction of Biological Activities\nThe biological activities of ononin and fluconazole (standard drug) were evaluated using PASS Online (www.way2drug.com/passonline (accessed on 05 May 2022)), considering the biological activity as \u201cactive\u201d (Pa) or \u201cinactive\u201d (Pi), based on the estimated probability that varies from zero to one. The results of PASS prediction considered only the biological activities with Pa > Pi, and data were as described previously [29], taking into account the following values:\ni. Pa > 0.7\u2014the substance probably exhibits biological activity, and there is also a high probability of this compound showing analogy with a known pharmaceutical. ii. 0.5< Pa < 0.7\u2014the compound may have biological activity, but the substance differs from known drugs.\nMetabolites 2022, 12, 1014 4 of 20\niii. Pa < 0.5\u2014the chance of finding biological activity is lower, but the chance of finding a structurally new compound is greater.\n2.3.4. Prediction of Pharmacokinetic Characteristics and the Toxic Effects of Ononin\nThe prediction of the characteristics of gastrointestinal absorption of the compounds, and their permeability through the blood\u2013brain barrier, was performed by SwissADME program [30]. The possible toxic effects of ononin was performed using Os\u00edris (\u00a9Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland) (www.organic-chemistry.org/prog/peo/drugScore. html) [31]. The toxicity parameters were predicted by comparing the chemical structures of the compounds with a database containing commercially available drugs and commercially available compounds. The toxic effects obtained were classified as mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritating, and effects on the reproductive system [32].\n2.3.5. In Silico Analysis of Ononin Toxicity\nTo assess the hepatic toxicity of ononin, we used SuperCYPsPred (http://insilico-cyp. charite.de/SuperCYPsPred (accessed on 5 May 2022)), which includes machine learning models based on the random forest algorithm and different types of data sampling methods. The models presented in SuperCYPsPred discriminate between inhibitors and noninhibitors for the five main CYP450 isoforms. Fragment-based and structural similarity approaches were used to evaluate the applicability domain of the models, in addition to predicting a specific compound as active (inhibitor) or inactive (non-inhibitor) for a defined CYP isoform [29].\n2.3.6. LD50 Prediction\nThe lethal dose (LD50) prediction was performed used using GUSAR software (http: //way2drug.com/mg/index.php (accessed on 5 May 2022) [33]. The GUSAR toxicity values were calculated on the Log10 scale to predict the LD50 (mg/kg) after intravenous and oral administration for rats. The toxicity classes were defined according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification (GHS) according to the values expressed in mg/kg [20].\nClass I: fatal if swallowed (LD50 \u2264 5). Class II: fatal by ingestion (5 < LD50 \u2264 50). Class III: toxic by ingestion (50 < LD50 \u2264 300). Class IV: harmful by ingestion (300 < LD50 \u2264 2000). Class V: may be harmful if ingested (2000 < LD50 \u2264 5000). Class VI: nontoxic (LD50 > 5000)."

The clinical (vaginal) isolates were obtained after approval of the protocol by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (UFMA) (Approval No. 3.956.307/2019). The isolates are part of the collection of the Laboratory of Immunophysiology, UFMA, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-MA, Brazil, and are maintained in 50% glycerol at \u221220 \u25e6C. The CaR and CaS isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Microflex, Bruker, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), and their fluconazole profile was obtained by an automated method (VITEK\u00ae2 Compact, BioM\u00e9rieux, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) and confirmed by the Kirby\u2013Bauer method according to standard M27-A3 [34].\nMetabolites 2022, 12, 1014 5 of 20\n2.4.1. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration\nThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ononin and fluconazole were determined using the standardized antifungal microdilution susceptibility test proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, standard M27-A3) [34]. The microorganisms were reactivated on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; Kasvi, Italy) for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C. The inoculum was prepared in NaCl (0.85%) from colonies isolated from 18\u201324-h cultures and adjusted in a Neubauer chamber to a density corresponding to 0.5 on the McFarland scale. For the microdilution tests, the suspension was diluted in RPMI 1640 medium with glutamine and without bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and buffered with MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a pH of 7.0 \u00b1 0.2 to obtain a concentration of 1 \u00d7 103 to 5 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL (CLSI, 2008). The final concentrations ranged from 0.24 to 500 \u00b5g/mL for ononin and from 0.125 to 0 128 \u00b5g/mL for fluconazole. The MIC was defined as a 50% reduction in visible growth of the microorganism compared to the growth control. DMSO (1%) was used as vehicle control.\n2.4.2. Minimum Fungicidal Concentration\nThe minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was defined as the concentration of the antifungal agent that inhibited the growth of colonies. For the determination of the MFC, 10 \u00b5L was removed from all wells of the standard MIC plates and transferred to Petri dishes containing SDA. The plates were incubated for 24\u201348 h at 37 \u25e6C before colony counting. All tests were carried out in triplicate and repeated three times.\n2.4.3. Cell Growth Kinetics\nThis assay was carried according to [35], with modifications. Cultures of the C. albicans strains (ATCC 10231, CaR and CaS) grown for 18\u201324 h on SDA were used. An initial inoculum of 5 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL was prepared in fresh RPMI, and ononin was added at concentrations of 1/4 MIC, 1/2 MIC, and MIC. The cultures were incubated at 37 \u25e6C. Aliquots were removed after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (Softmax\u00ae\u00ae Pro), plotted against time in hours. DMSO (1%) was used as vehicle control. The assays were performed in six replicates on three different occasions.\n2.4.4. Antibiofilm Activity\nThe in vitro biofilm formation assay was carried out as described previously [4,36,37] with some modifications. Briefly, C. albicans ATCC 10231 and CaR cells were incubated on SDA for 18\u201324 h at 37 \u25e6C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 3000 g and washed twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The pellets were suspended in MOPS-buffered RPMI 1640 medium. The inoculum was adjusted to an optical density of 0.5 (~1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL) at 600 nm in 200 \u00b5L, added to a 96-well flat-bottom plate, and left to stand for 90 min at 37 \u25e6C for adhesion. After this period, the supernatant was aspirated carefully to remove nonadherent cells and washed twice with 200 \u00b5L PBS. Next, 200 \u00b5L of fresh medium with or without the antifungal agent was added to the wells. The following antifungal concentrations were used in this assay: MIC, 2 \u00d7 MIC, 4 \u00d7 MIC, and 8 \u00d7 MIC. After the addition of the antifungal agents, the plates were incubated for 24 or 48 h at 37 \u25e6C. For the evaluation of young biofilms, the plates were incubated in the presence of the antifungals for 24 h. Mature biofilms were left to grow for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C in the absence of antifungal agents. Next, the old medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without antifungals and incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 \u25e6C. After this period, the supernatant was removed and the plates were read at an optical density of 600 nm [36,38,39]. Metabolic activity was analyzed by a colorimetric assay that measures the reduction of 3-methyl-(4\u20135-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium salt (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to formazan according to [10].

Ononin showed better binding affinity than the antifungal agents (Table 1). Posaconazole is the native ligand of CaCYP51, and redocking of posaconazole was therefore performed to validate the docking protocol. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the predicted docking conformation and the observed X-ray crystal structure was 1.47 \u00c5. Values less than 2 \u00c5 indicate that the docking protocol is valid.

The inoculum of 5 \u00d7 105 cells/larva provided the most reproducible results, and was therefore used for the subsequent survival tests. In addition, the inoculum of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/larva did not cause death, although infection persisted in the larvae throughout the period studied. To ensure that death was not due to shock caused by the injection of a large amount of fluid, one group of larvae was injected with 10 \u00b5L PBS as a control, and no deaths were observed (Figure 6A). Tenebrio molitor infected with C. albicans (5 \u00d7 105 cells/larva) exhibited 100% mortality on the third day, and the median survival of this group was 2 days (Figure 6B). The treatments affected the lifespan of the groups. Even at the lowest dose of ononin (0.5 mg/kg), the average survival was 4 days, with a survival rate of 13% after 7 days of infection. At the dose of 1 mg/kg, the survival rate was 53% on day 4 of infection, and the larvae started to die by day 2, with a delay in the onset of death compared to fluconazole (death started on day 1). At the dose of 5 mg/kg, the survival rate was 80% by day 4, with the onset of death on day 3. This result is superior to fluconazole, which ensured a survival rate of 60% of the larvae by day 4 at a dose of 10 mg/kg (Figure 6B). To determine whether mortality was related to the antifungal activity of ononin, the survival of C. albicans was evaluated in larvae using a previously standardized nonlethal inoculum (Figure 6C).

            "text": "Candida albicans species can cause superficial infection of the oral and vaginal mucosa, as well as infections disseminated to the bloodstream and deep tissues. The commonly prescribed antifungal agent for most C. albicans infections is fluconazole, a member of the azole class [1,40]. Its pharmacological effect is related to the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which is encoded by the ERG11 gene [41]. Azoles directly inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol by binding to C. albicans CYP51 (CaCYP51), causing the depletion of ergosterol and, at the same time, increasing 14\u03b1-methylated sterols, which leads to the accumulation of toxic sterol intermediates [1,42]. Many plants are used in research to identify new bases of antifungal agents [43]. The results of biological tests conducted by our group show that the hydroethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of Platonia insignis Mart. possesses antifungal activity against several Candida species, including 16 clinical isolates. Both the extract and its fractions showed antifungal effects against Candida isolates, with MICs ranging from 1.8 to 6.3 mg/mL against C. albicans and 1.6 to 8.3 mg/mL against C. glabrata. [10]. In the present study, the main compounds identified in the extract (quinic acid, ononin, orientin, vitexin, and fukugentin) were submitted to MD to evaluate their possible interaction with CaCYP51. Negative binding free energies indicate that these interactions favor formation of the ligand\u2013receptor complex, and the inhibitory constant is a valuable piece of data to predict clinically relevant drug interactions [28]. According to the MD results, among the compounds identified in the extract, ononin exhibited the most favorable parameters for the formation of complexes with CaCYP51, and was therefore selected for this study. The X-ray crystallography data of the CaCYP51\u2013itraconazole complex (PDB ID 5V5Z) obtained in previous studies showed that this drug interacts with amino acid residues Gly307, Thr311, and Leu376. Our results indicate that ononin interacts with the same amino acids, as well as with the neighboring residues Ile304, Leu309, Ser378, and Phe380 (Figure 1). Previous results observed for the drug VT-1161 (oteseconazole) (PDB ID 5TZ1) complexed with CaCYP51, showed interactions with the same residues as those found in our study. This new class of antifungals targeting fungal CYP51 without significantly affecting the human homolog is promising to increase treatment options [44]. It is important to mention that posaconazole, used as control in our study, interacts with Leu121, Phe126, Ile131, Phe228, and Leu376, the same residues identified for ononin, suggesting that the latter effectively binds to the active site of CaCYP51 (Table 1). Molecular docking studies using fluconazole have demonstrated the unsatisfactory affinity of this drug to CaCYP51 when compared to other conventional antifungal agents [6]. In a study testing fluconazole and posaconazole in vitro against C. albicans, fluconazole exhibited low efficiency (activity of 54%), while posaconazole showed very high efficiency of 98% when tested at the same concentration [45]. These results agree with our in silico data, demonstrating a superior binding affinity for posaconazole compared to fluconazole (Table 1). Ononin and fluconazole showed high intestinal absorption characteristics, but they both are not able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier according the SwissADME in silico prediction (Table 3). In addition, the in silico analysis revealed that ononin has no mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritating, or reproductive system effects (Tables 3 and 4). In silico prediction of ononin include anti-inflammatory; antioxidant, anti-infective, antifungal, and immunostimulant biological proprieties (Table 2). The low toxicity of ononin was also confirmed by our in vivo results using T. molitor, since all animals remained alive during the period of observation even when they received the highest dose of this compound (20 mg/Kg, Figure 5) The anti-inflammatory effect of ononin was demonstrated in vitro on lipopolysaccharideinduced inflammatory responses using RAW 264.7 [15] and in vivo in rats with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative disease categorized by the deficiency in the cognition and memory. According to Chen et al. [46], ononin treatment effectively modulates\nMetabolites 2022, 12, 1014 16 of 20\nbehavioral alterations, ameliorates the cognitive impairment, and suppresses the neuroinflammation oxidative stress in AD animals. Ononin also showed an anti-inflammatory effect in rheumatoid arthritis. In this case, the compound induced cell apoptosis and reduced the fibroblast-like synoviocyte inflammation by alleviating MAPK and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [47]. In relation to the anti-infective and antifungal effects of ononin, there is limited information; for this reason, it was our aim to investigate this activity in vitro and in vivo. The present study evaluated the in vitro antifungal activity of ononin against two clinical C. albicans isolates obtained from patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (one sensitive, CaS, and one resistant to fluconazole, CaR) and with ATCC 10231 as a reference strain. Ononin inhibited the growth of C. albicans (ATCC 10231, CaR, and CaS) with MICs of 3.9 to 7.8 \u00b5g/mL, and was effective for the both strains: fluconazole-sensitive and - resistant isolates (Table 5). For the CaR isolate, there was no difference in growth between the untreated control and the cultures treated with fluconazole, confirming the resistant genotype. Instead, analysis of growth kinetics showed a dose-dependent effect for the compound, which also exhibited activity even when used at subinhibitory concentrations (Figure 2). The emergence of C. albicans strains that are resistant to azoles as a result of the prophylactic and prolonged use of azole antifungal agents in clinical practice, especially fluconazole, has been reported [48,49]. This has become a growing problem, especially among immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant patients, patients with cancer, and HIV/AIDS patients [50]; for this reason, there is an urgent need to develop new effective therapeutic strategies against these strains that are resistant to conventional antifungals. In view of the positive results obtained in silico and the effect of ononin on planktonic C. albicans cells, we studied the effect of this substance on young and mature biofilms. The results show that ononin was effective against the two types of biofilms, since ononin reduced the density of young biofilms at the lowest concentration tested, as well as the density of mature biofilms at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 MIC or higher (Figure 3). These data were validated by the MTT assay, which showed considerable inhibition of young and mature biofilms (p < 0.05), with the reduction of metabolic activity reaching 52 to 81% (Figure 4). Thus, ononin is a potential antifungal candidate since it inhibited biofilm formation, as well as the mature biofilm, which is normally difficult to treat. Biofilm formation is an important virulence factor of C. albicans that contributes to the pathogenicity of this species. Biofilms consist of a structured set of cells, and can develop at different locations in the human body [37]. Antifungal therapy is necessary for successful treatment and control of the infection [51]. An important characteristic of Candida biofilms is their resistance to antifungal agents, which can be classified as intrinsic or acquired through the transfer of genetic material between biofilm cells [52]. In addition, these biofilms resist the host immune response [2], a fact that contributes to the persistence of yeasts in tissues and on implanted medical devices and to therapeutic failures. The capacity to form biofilms is a marked and clinically relevant characteristic of C. albicans virulence [53]. Our results show a more effective activity of ononin against young biofilms; moreover, its effect on mature biofilms was also significant, suggesting the possibility to consider the ononin as an alternative to conventional antifungal agents and a target in the development of new drugs. Biological properties of ononin, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial activity, have already been reported [14,15,18,20]; however, this is the first study to analyze its antifungal activity against C. albicans. Molecular docking studies have proved efficient for the identification of new antifungal drug candidates. In vitro studies using 3,4-dichlorobenzyl derivatives against C. albicans demonstrated that the derivative with the best results exhibited comparable or superior activity to the conventional drugs tested, including fluconazole, and the same compounds provided the best binding affinity in MD, corroborating with our in vitro data [54,55]. In view of these findings, we evaluated the efficacy of ononin in vivo using the T. molitor as a model of infection with C. albicans. The use of invertebrate for the study of\nMetabolites 2022, 12, 1014 17 of 20\nmicrobial infection has increased considerably in an attempt to avoid or reduce the use of vertebrates in animal experimentation [38,39,56]. Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera), popularly known as the mealworm, is found worldwide, and is a rapid, inexpensive, and efficient model for in vivo testing of antifungal substances, since it is susceptible to human pathogens such as C. albicans, can be incubated at 37 \u25e6C, and its size favors the collection of body fluids [56]. Within this context and considering the in silico and in vitro results, we first standardized the most appropriate inoculum for the subsequent experiments. Our data agree with the inocula used in T. molitor experimentation [38,57,58]. Ononin extended the lifespan of the larvae and reduced fungal loads (Figure 6). The lowest concentration of the compound was able to increase larval survival and ensured an average survival of 3 days, while the median survival of the untreated infected control was only 2 days. Survival at the higher ononin concentration used for treatment (5 mg/kg) was superior to that observed for fluconazole. It should be noted that ononin did not exert any toxic effect on T. molitor survival when using concentrations higher than 10 mg/kg (Figure 5). The absence of hemolytic activity of ononin at higher concentrations corroborates these data, thus demonstrating that ononin can be used safely in vivo since it is not toxic. Mammalian red blood cells represent a good model for assessing the cytotoxicity of organic and inorganic natural or synthetic molecules by measuring cell damage [59]. Taken together, the present findings show the high affinity of ononin for CaCYP51 in silico, its effective activity against biofilms, and the reduction of fungal loads in treated animals, in addition to the absence of toxicity, demonstrating the significant therapeutic potential of this compound."

Ononin was not cytotoxic, and also showed several biological activities that may improve the antifungal effect in vivo and can be associated with the efficacy in increasing the T. molitor survival. This finding suggests that the mechanism of action of ononin might be related to the biosynthesis of ergosterol, rendering it a strong antifungal candidate.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo12111014/s1, Figure S1: Structure of ononin; Table S1: The physicochemical properties of ononin and fluconazole.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.F.d.S., C.A.M. and R.N.M.G.; methodology, A.F.d.S., J.R.F., D.C.G.F., A.A.G., E.P.M., A.d.S.O., C.C.V., M.d.S.d.S.C., C.Q.d.R., M.C.P.d.S. and A.J.O.L.; formal analysis, A.F.d.S., C.C.V., A.J.O.L., F.R.F.d.N., C.A.M. and R.N.M.G.; investigation, A.F.d.S., C.C.V., A.J.O.L., C.A.M. and R.N.M.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.F.d.S., A.J.O.L., C.A.M. and R.N.M.G. writing\u2014review and editing, A.F.d.S., A.J.O.L., F.R.F.d.N., C.A.M., and R.N.M.G.; supervision, R.N.M.G.; project administration, R.N.M.G.; funding acquisition, R.N.M.G.
