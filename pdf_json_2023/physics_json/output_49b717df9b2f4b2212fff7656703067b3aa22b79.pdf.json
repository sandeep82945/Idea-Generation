            "text": "There has been a rapid increase in global energy demand together with a rapid increase in fossil fuel price in recent years.1 In addition, environmental pollution has become a major global issue, leading to global warming and climate change.2 In order to reduce the environmental demand for clean and sustainable energy, intensive research is needed to develop various renewable and sustainable energy sources to deal with the severe energy crisis.3 The fuel cell is a device used to convert a chemical reaction into electricity, which is considered a zero-emission system when using hydrogen as the fuel.4 The anodic reaction of the fuel cell is a fuel oxidation reaction in which a fuel, such as hydrogen or methanol, is oxidized to produce electrons. Although much research has been done on direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) in recent years, due to their simple operation and low cost of methanol,\nartment, Faculty of Postgraduate Studies Beni-Suef 62511, Egypt na, Suez 43511, Egypt , Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef 62511, edu.eg tion (ESI) available.

These drawbacks hinder the extensive commercialization of DMFCs.5 Despite this, it is well known that rare and noble metals, such as Pt- and Ru-based electrocatalysts, have superior electrocatalytic activity to the methanol oxidation reaction, but to a large extent their high cost and scarcity still restrict their practical application.6,7 In addition, the strong affinity of Pt for poisoning by absorbing the intermediate species, such as CO or HCHO, that are produced during the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) limits the large-scale usage of DMFCs.7,8 Consequently, the development of effective, reliable, and low-cost Pt-free MOR catalysts is considered a vital issue. Several catalysts based on non-noble transition metals, such as Mn, Co, Ni, Fe, and Cu, and their oxides have been widely used as possible alternatives due to their promising electrocatalytic activity.9,10\nRecently, a new class of porous solid materials has emerged: metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from metal ions and organic ligands coordination bonds.11 MOFs are attracting attention due to their many unique properties, such as their controllable structures and composition, large surface area, high catalytic activity, good porosity, and excellent thermal stability.12,13 However, the poor chemical stability, low electrical conductivity, sluggish ion transference, and few exposed active\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Dual composite CNT-based MOFs display synergistic features from both components, resulting in improved electrochemical activity, due to their enhanced conductivity, increased electroactive sites for reaction, short diffusion path for ions, and abundant redox reactions in basic electrolytes.17,18 Thus, different carbon-based nanocomposites as electrochemically active materials have been studied and evaluated in fuel cell applications.19,20\nRecently, the cobalt metal\u2013organic framework (Co-MOF) has demonstrated an effective electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction HER, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an acceptable current density.21 For instance, Mehek et al. prepared a Co-MOF and its composites with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a solvothermal method for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol with a current density of 29.1 mA cm\u22122.16 Also, Anchu et al. synthesized Co@CNT via the conventional pyrolysis method, and then tested this in the electrochemical oxidation of methanol, revealing a current density of 0.9 mA cm\u22122.22 However, these composites could only display a limited current density and stability.\nThe objectives of this work were to develop platinum-free, low-cost, and electroactive materials for the MOR with unique properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst report of a Co-MOF composite fabricated with CNTs with high electrochemical activity for methanol oxidation. So, in this work, the Co-MOF ower structure and its nanocomposite with CNTs were prepared as effective electrocatalytic materials for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) using a simple ultrasonication route. Different ratios of CNTs were used in the nanocomposites, namely 25, 50, and 75 wt%, to investigate their role in the MOR. The electrochemical performances of Co-MOF and Co-MOF/CNTs composites toward the MOR in a basic medium were compared. The newly owered structure offered complementary features from (i) the high conductivity of CNTs, which could can improve the electron conductivity of the MOF, (ii) the anchoring of CNTs between the Co-MOF ower petals, which could provide open architectures that afford pathways for the ions and electrons. The Co-MOF/CNT composites exhibited extraordinarily high electrocatalytic activity toward the MOR with remarkable stability, suggesting their use as an alternative electrode material as an electrocatalyst."

In addition, in Fig. 6(a), the desorption part of the isotherm had a weak jump at P/P0 (0.4\u20130.9) with an open\nhysteresis loop, which is characteristic of mesoporous solids.44\u201347 The Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) method results for the determination of the pore-size distribution is shown in Fig. 6(b). All the materials were in the mesopore range, with a pore-size distribution between 10\u201320 nm. Furthermore, the hierarchically porous structure gave short pathways for ion transport and electron transfer, which could improve the MOR performance.23,48,49"

Also, CoMOF displayed two redox anodic peaks at 0.11 and 0.4 V and a distinct redox cathodic peak at 0.25 V, which could be attributed to the automatic electrochemical redox reaction of the Co2+/Co3+ couple.14 Moreover, there was stability in the obtained current peak density with increasing the MeOH concentrations from 1 to 3 M, which might have been because the active sites for methanol adsorption had been used up, whereby increasing the methanol concentration did not improve the nal activity and even prevented molecule diffusion.19 The same trends were obtained with MeOH addition to 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte for the Co-MOF/25% CNTs and CoMOF/50% CNTs, as shown in Fig. 8(b and c), respectively. This behavior indicated that the MOR depended on the available active sites for methanol adsorption and the oxidation reaction was a diffusion-controlled process. On the other hand, a lower methanol activity was noticed for Co-MOF/75% CNTs with a current density as low as 1.7 mA cm\u22122, which may be due to the blockage of the active sites due to the aggregation of CNTs around the Co-MOFs.54\nThe onset potentials were measured for Co-MOF, Co-MOF/ 25% CNTs, Co-MOF/50% CNTs, and Co-MOF/75% CNTs toward methanol oxidation in alkaline media through CVs.

The Co-MOF/50% CNTs exhibited a strong oxidation current density (35 mA cm\u22122) in the presence of 1 M methanol, and a relatively low onset potential of methanol oxidation, which was 0.335 V, such that the Co-MOF/50% CNTs needed low energy for the redox reactions to occur.

The effect of the CNTs content on the MOR activity in both scan rates was noticed. The results showed an increase in the oxidation peak's current density up to a CNTs content of 50% CNTs. The excellent catalytic performance of the Co-MOF/ 25% CNTs and Co-MOF/50% CNTs for the oxidation of methanol demonstrated that the conductive matrix of CNTs offered a good linkage with the Co-MOF, which may facilitate quick electron transfer into the active sites within the composites, and could potentially enhance the DMFC performance.

The electrooxidation of methanol in DMFCs can be assessed using the redox couples as electroactive sites.4 The mass activity of all electrocatalysts was calculated from the ratio of the current density (J) vs. the deposited mass (m).57\nMass activity (M.A.) = J/m (1)\nFig. 9 CV curves of CNT, Co-MOF, Co-MOF/25% CNTs, Co-MOF/50% C NaOH and 1 M methanol.\n27942 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 27934\u201327945\nThe mass activity (M.A.) of the measured samples was CoMOF: 30 mA mg\u22121; MOF/25% CNTs: 166.66 mA mg\u22121; CoMOF/50% CNTs: 233.33 mA mg\u22121; and MOF/75% CNTs: 11.33 mA mg\u22121, with the activity for the MOR in the order of Co-MOF/ 50% CNTs > Co-MOF/25% CNTs > Co-MOF > Co-MOF/75% CNTs.

In the rst 60 s, there was an initial decline in the current density due to intermediate reactions, i.e., the adsorptions of Coadso, CHOadso, and COOHadso on the catalyst surface.16 Aer that, the current density decreased regularly and reached a quasi-stationary state until 3600 s.

The long-term stability of the Co-MOF/50% CNTs was measured by cyclic voltammogram with continuous CV cycles. The current density retained by the catalyst aer 500 cycles is presented in Fig. 10(b), showing it could retain 75% of the initial current aer 500 cycles. This result could be assumed to indicate the blockage of the active sites by excessive bubbling produced during the methanol oxidation that covered the electrode surface. The sample stability tended to diminish with a reasonable ratio aer repeated cycling due to the inhibition of electrolyte transportation toward the catalytic material, and the reduced electrochemical active surface area due to the continuous bubbling.57 This case can be resolved by refreshing the electrolyte by a following cathodic reduction (reverse scan) and performing CV for limited cycles. This study demonstrated good stability values in comparison with previous studies due to the good surface area, good scattering of CNTs in between the MOF akes, and slight charge-transfer resistance.54\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique used to examine electrodes' conductivity by evaluating their resistance and the equivalent series resistance (ESR),\nFig. 10 Chronoamperometric curves of the electrodes (a), cyclic stability MOF, Co-MOF/25% CNTs, Co-MOF/50% CNTs, and Co-MOF/75% CNTs NaOH.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

EIS was performed in a three-electrode electrochemical system at a potential of 0.6 V, and a frequency range between 10 to 100 kHz. The Nyquist plots could only be interpreted using the equivalent circuit shown as an inset in Fig. 10(c). From Fig. 10(b), lower semicircles were obtained for Co-MOF, CoMOF/25% CNTs, and Co-MOF/50% CNTs, indicating the lower equivalent series resistance and higher conductivity for these composites with lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Fig. 10(c) shows that the lowest semicircle was obtained for Co-MOF/50% CNTs, with the lowest Rct of (0.0116 kU), which was remarkably smaller than those of Co-MOF (0.018 kU) and Co-MOF/25% CNTs (0.0116 kU), suggesting the fast and efficient electron transport for Co-MOF/50% CNTs. These data reveal the importance of the incorporation of MOF with CNTs, which reduces the resistance of CNTs and promotes its conductivity.\nThe proposed methanol oxidation reaction mechanism over the surface of the prepared catalysts involved some simple steps. Typically, the process followed eqn (2)\u2013(9), comprising adsorption of methanol on the catalyst surface, methanol dissociation by C\u2013H bond activation, the adsorption of water molecules followed by water activation, and nally, the oxidation of carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide.

The Co-MOF/CNTs showed well-organized and stable methanol oxidation activities in an alkaline medium. The greatest electrochemical activity of the Co-MOF/50% CNTs composite over the other catalysts may be due to the existence of CNTs in the composite with fewer aggregations, higher active sites due to the open structure, and lower electrode resistance. These features endow the structure with great electronic conductivity, enhance the surface area, and facilitate ion transportation during redox reactions. Furthermore, in Co-MOF/ 50% CNTs, the acceptable percentage of CNTs, uniform distribution between Co-MOF layers, and co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation states caused an increase in the current density from 4.5 mA cm\u22122 to 35 mA cm\u22122 at 0.335 V and a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121, and improved its stability for up to 3600 s with a retention of 87.6%.
