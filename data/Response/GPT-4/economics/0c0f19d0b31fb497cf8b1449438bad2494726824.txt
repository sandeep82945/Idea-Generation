Exploration of Renewable Energy Alternatives in the Transportation Sector: Investigating the feasibility, economic implications, and environmental benefits of integrating renewable energy sources into Pakistan's transportation infrastructure. This research could include case studies of successful renewable energy projects in transportation globally, adapted to Pakistan's unique geographical, economic, and social context.

Impact of Advanced Urban Planning on Transport Emissions: A comprehensive study on how urban planning and development strategies can be optimized to reduce transportation emissions in Pakistan. This study could focus on the design of urban spaces that promote the use of public transport, cycling, and walking, and the impact of high-rise buildings on reducing the demand for transportation.

Technological Innovations and Their Role in Reducing Transportation Emissions: Evaluating the potential of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen fuel cells, and advanced public transportation systems, to reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. The study could also assess the barriers to adoption and propose strategies for overcoming these challenges in Pakistan.

Impact of Public Transportation Improvements on Urban Air Quality: Analyzing the relationship between investments in public transportation infrastructure and improvements in air quality and public health in urban areas of Pakistan. This research could explore the potential for public transport to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road and the consequent decrease in transportation-related emissions.

Socio-economic Impacts of Transportation Emissions Reduction Policies: A detailed investigation into the socio-economic impacts of policies aimed at reducing transportation emissions, including the effects on employment, income levels, and access to mobility. This study could provide valuable insights into the trade-offs and synergies between economic development and environmental sustainability in the context of Pakistan's transportation sector.
