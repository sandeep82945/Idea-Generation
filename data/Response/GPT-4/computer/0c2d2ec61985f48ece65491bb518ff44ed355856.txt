Enhanced Adaptive Intralimb Coordination: Extending the proposed adaptive neural control by integrating advanced reflex mechanisms and muscle models to improve the robotâ€™s adaptability to complex terrains, such as slopes and high obstacles, by enabling dynamic adjustments in the foot trajectory and body posture.

Self-organized Locomotion on Multi-legged Robots: Exploring the scalability and adaptability of the proposed control approach on robots with different numbers and configurations of legs, such as hexapods or octopods, to study how adaptive interlimb and intralimb coordination can be achieved in a broader range of robotic platforms.

Robustness to Sensor and Actuator Failures: Developing algorithms for adaptive neural control that can compensate for sensor and actuator failures more effectively, thereby enhancing the robustness of self-organized locomotion under various unexpected conditions.

Gait Transition Mechanisms: Investigating the possibility of implementing multiple sensory feedback modulation and incorporating a backbone joint with adaptive stiffness in the control system, to enable spontaneous gait transitions based on changes in environmental conditions, robot speed, and navigational requirements.

Integration with Cognitive Systems for Autonomous Navigation: Combining the adaptive neural control with cognitive systems for high-level decision-making, to enable robots to not only adaptively generate and control their locomotion but also autonomously navigate in complex, dynamic environments by recognizing obstacles, planning paths, and making decisions based on sensory inputs.
