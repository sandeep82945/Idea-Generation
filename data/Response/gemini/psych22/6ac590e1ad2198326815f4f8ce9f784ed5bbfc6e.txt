1. **Investigate the relationship between different types of leisure time sports and executive functions in children.** This study focused on leisure time sport in general, but it would be interesting to see if there are specific types of sports that are more beneficial for executive function development. For example, sports that require quick decision-making and reaction time, such as soccer or basketball, might be more effective than sports that are more focused on endurance, such as running or swimming.


2. **Examine the effects of leisure time sport on executive functions in children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.** This study found that socioeconomic status was not a confounder for the relationship between leisure time sport and executive functions, but it is possible that the effects of sport may vary depending on a child's socioeconomic background. For example, children from lower-income families may have less access to opportunities for leisure time sport, or they may face other challenges that make it difficult for them to benefit from sport participation.


3. **Explore the mechanisms by which leisure time sport improves executive functions in children.** This study did not investigate the mechanisms by which leisure time sport might improve executive functions, but there are several possible explanations. For example, sport participation may help to improve brain plasticity, increase the production of neurotransmitters that are important for cognitive function, or reduce inflammation.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of leisure time sport on executive functions and academic achievement.** This study only looked at the effects of leisure time sport on executive functions in 1st grade children, but it would be interesting to see if these effects persist over time. It is possible that children who participate in leisure time sport in childhood may have better executive functions and academic achievement in later years.


5. **Develop interventions that use leisure time sport to improve executive functions in children.** This study provides evidence that leisure time sport can improve executive functions in children, but more research is needed to develop effective interventions that can be used to promote sport participation and improve executive function development. Such interventions could be implemented in schools, community centers, or other settings where children can participate in leisure time sport.
