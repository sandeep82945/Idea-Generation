    "abstractText": "Biofertilizers are agricultural materials capable of reducing the usage amounts of chemical fertilizers. Spore-forming microorganisms (SFM) could be used for plant growth promotion or to improve plant health. Until now, biofertilizers based on SFM have been applied for rice and other crops. In this study, we isolated and characterized SFM, which were colonized on the Oryza sativa L. roots. SFM were analyzed regarding the short-term effects of biofertilization on the nursery growths. Analysis was performed without nitrogen or any inorganic fertilizer and was divided into two groups, including bacteria and fungi. SF-bacteria were dominated by the Firmicutes group, including species from Viridibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Solibacillus, Paenibacillus, Priestia, and mainly Bacillus (50%). The fungi group was classified as Mucoromycota, Basidiomycota, and mainly Ascomycota (80%), with a predominance of Penicillium and Trichoderma species. In plant performance in comparison with B. pumilus TUAT1, some bacteria and fungus isolates significantly improved the early growth of rice, based on 48 h inoculum with 107 CFU mL\u22121. Furthermore, several SFM showed positive physiological responses under abiotic stress or with limited nutrients such as phosphorous (P). Moreover, the metabolic fingerprint was obtained. The biofertilizer based on SFM could significantly reduce the application of the inorganic fertilizer and improve the lodging resistances of rice, interactively enhancing better plant health and crop production.",

            "text": "The nutrient supplies of plants are significantly influenced by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi [1\u20134]. Those microorganisms that have a positive effect and stimulate plant growth are defined as plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms [5\u20137], including those that form spores. They are distributed in the rhizosphere, on root surfaces (rhizoplane), within root tissues (root cortex), leaves, stems, and as free-living microorganisms in the soil. Currently, some mechanisms related to plant growth promotion have been clarified, such as biological nitrogen fixation, phytohormone production, nutrient solubilization, and siderophore production [5,8]. However, many factors and pathways are still unknown, especially under stress conditions. Many environmental factors affect spore-forming microorganisms (SFM), such as spore formation and plant-interaction effectiveness. Some responses and interactions vary\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 232. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11020232 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 232 2 of 19\ndepending on the plant host, environmental factors, and strain origin [9]. The effect of various environmental factors on the competitiveness of PGP strains in plant hosts has been examined, but many questions are still unresolved. For example, in plant\u2013microbe interactions, nitrogen fixation is strongly related to the physiological state of the host plant, but in other cases, such as Fe or P mobilization, most plant responses depend on the strain [1,9,10]. Therefore, a competitive and persistent SFM strain is not expected to express its total capacity for nitrogen fixation under limiting factors (e.g., salinity, unfavorable soil pH, nutrient deficiency, mineral toxicity, extreme temperatures, and soil moisture problems) [7,9]. Moreover, populations of SFM species vary in their tolerance to major environmental factors [1,10], such as what happened with the radioactive disaster in Fukushima prefecture, Japan. However, those pathways and mechanisms are poorly described. Moreover, they can indirectly affect plant growth to inhibit plant pathogenic organisms via the production of diverse anti-pathogenic chemical compounds [4,6,9]. Presently, many countries have started to develop organic farming systems for sustainable food production. As a result, some PGP rhizobacteria have been commercialized as biofertilizers. Many of these inoculants are based on strains such as Azospirillum brasilense, A. lipoferum, A. chroococcum, Bacillus fimus, B. licheniformis, P. megaterium, Bacillus mucilaginous, B. pumilus, B. subtilis, Burkholderia cepacia, Deltia acidovorans, Paenobacillus macerans, Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, P. chlororaphis, P. fluorescens, P. solanacearum, P. syringae, Serratia entomophilia, Streptomyces griseoviridis, S. lydicus, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Rhizobium species [4,9]. Correspondingly, there are many published papers about the positive effects of plant growth-promoting microorganisms on various cultivated crops [2,4,10\u201312]. However, the information regarding the spore-forming microorganisms (SFM) associated with plant growth promotion is limited. The studies mainly focus on those associated with animal health [13,14], and commonly spore-forming (SF-) bacteria are more reported than fungi. Therefore, to clarify the SFM-rice interactions and mechanisms, we need a base line to understand the metabolism of these SFM [1,15]. Thus, BIOLOG is a suitable method reported in other studies as a metabolic fingerprint of some bacterial or fungal species. In the current study, we analyzed the phylogenetic diversity and physiological characteristics of cultivated SFM from different ecological conditions as well as from rice fields as forestal rhizosphere in the Fukushima region, Japan. This study focused on the genetic diversity of fungi and bacteria that are positively associated with Oryza sativa L. as the main crop, which is continuously cultivated in different Japanese regions and other countries. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between physiological characteristics as an individual and in correlation with the nutrient uptake in soils such as N, P, and K; this will lead to promising bio-inoculants for further application in crop production with low chemical fertilizer, especially in the Fukushima region. Moreover, this study will benefit the restoration of Fukushima Prefecture by helping the organic cultivation of different crops such as rice and vegetables."

In the collected rhizosphere, 222 bacterial strains and 47 fungi were present. In contrast, there were 98 bacterial strains and 19 fungus isolates from soils (Figure 2b). Moreover, the number of isolates was predominated by SF-bacteria independently of the sample (Figure 2b).

In the case of fungal isolates, ITS1 and 18S rRNA gene sequences of fifteen fungal strains were used for their identification (Table 1).\nFuk: Fukushima. a: Consensus identity including the phylogenetic analysis. b: Based on the literature up to 2021, unknown means no reference was found about this strain positively or negatively. Highlighted means no information was found about any species of this genus.\nOn the one hand, the phylogenetic tree results of \u201cBacteria isolates\u201d were similar between both genes (Figures S1 and S2), which showed that Fukushima isolates were clustered into the Bacilliales group. Interestingly, in this study, the SF-bacterial isolates were closely related to the Firmicutes phylum, only the Bacilli class, independently of the gene used. Then, the clustering analysis results for both genes divided the isolates into six genera groups (Figures S1 and S2) as follows: Bacillus (50% of total bacterial isolates), Priestia (11%), Peanibacillus (22%), Viridibacillus (6%), Solibacillus (6%), and Lysinbacillus (6%). Bacillus genus is dominant in this study, and according to the species, 9 isolates were divided into 3 sub-groups, establishing a relationship between Fukushima isolates and B. pumilus (4 strains), Bacillus sp. close to B. thuringiensis (3 strains) and B. simplex (2 strains) formerly known as Peribacillus simplex (Figures S1 and S2). The subsequent group was the Paenibacillus genus which included 4 strains and somehow closely correlated to Paenibacillus amylolyticus; most of the strains were classified as Paenibacillus sp. (Figures S1 and S2) in consensus with all genetic results (Table 1). The remaining isolates are divided into one strain for each genus (Table 1, Figures S1 and S2). Regarding the frequency of bacterial isolates, the Bacillus isolates were mainly collected from soil samples with Japanese pampas grass or rice cultivation history. However, two strains, Fuk 10_10 and Fuk 4_10 were obtained from the rhizosphere. In contrast, Priesta isolates were only from rhizosphere samples. In the case of Paenibacillus, these strains were collected equally from the soil and rhizosphere. Furthermore, the Viridibacillus strain was\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 232 8 of 19\ncollected from the rhizosphere (Table S1), and up to date, it is the first time to describe these genera as plant growth promoting (Table 1). On the other hand, \u201cFungal isolates\u201d were genetically analyzed based on the sequences of ITS1 (Figure S3) and 18S rRNA (Figure S4) gene sequences, and their consensus species per each selected isolate is summarized in Table 1. In this study, the fungus strains were divided into 3 big groups in the fungi taxonomy. The predominant group in this study is closely related to the Ascomycota division (80% of the total fungal strains), followed by the Mucoromycota phylum (13%) and Basidiomycota division (7%), independently of the phylogenetic gene used. The clustering analysis results for both genes divided Ascomycota division into five genera groups (Figures S3 and S4) as follows: Trichoderma (27% of total fungus strains), Penicillium (27%), Fusarium (13%), Sarocladium (7%), and Bisporella (7%). Trichoderma was mainly related to three species: T. polysporum, T. lixii, and T. reesei (Figure S3). In the case of Penicillium genus, the isolates were closely related to P. decumbens or P. brasilianum and P. oxalicum (Figure S3). Furthermore, the Ascomycota isolates were related to two species as F. equiseti and F. oxysporum. The remaining Ascomycota strains were closely related to Sarocladium bactrocephalum and Bisporella discendens. In contrast, Mucoromycota and Basidiomycota isolates were closely related to one specie, respectively (Figures S3 and S4). Fuk 38 and Fuk 39 were related to Mortierella alpina (Mucoromycota), and Fuk 6 was related to Cutaneotrichosporon moniliiforme (formerly known as Trichosporon moniliiforme). Regarding the occurrence of fungal isolates, the highest number was rhizosphere samples, with 87% of the total (Table 1). Only two isolates were collected from soil; both were found in soil with Japanese pampas grass cultivation history. Furthermore, to date, it is the first time that Cutaneotrichosporon, and Bisporella isolates were described as plant growth promoting (Table 1). Additionally, several fungal strains have been described as pest biocontrol, cellulose degradation, endophytic fungus, or even a pathogen with phytohormone production activity."

First, all isolates were tolerant to high-temperature, especially SF-bacteria. Salinity tolerance was determined by recording growth rates compared to the control (media without any modifications). A total of 89% of bacterial isolates and 80% of fungi could grow at high NaCl concentrations (4%) and showed good or the same growth as the control (Table S2). However, two bacterial isolates, Fuk 11_7 (from the soil) and Fuk 13_15 (from the rhizosphere) could not tolerate NaCl at 4%; these bacterial isolates belonged to Bacillus and Viridibacillus, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, three fungal strains, Fuk 44, Fuk 49, and Fuk 36 could not grow at 4% NaCl but could grow at lower salinity (Table S2); all of them were isolated from rhizosphere samples and belonged to the Trichoderma genus (Table 1). Fukushima SFM showed tolerance to different pH conditions, from acidic to alkaline. Surprisingly, fungal isolates were not affected by pH changes. However, bacterial isolates were more affected by acidic than alkaline pH. The isolates Fuk 11_7 and Fuk 11_10 (from rhizosphere) could not grow under acidic conditions. Moreover, Fuk 11_7 could not grow at 10 pH. Figure 3(a1,b1) showed the relation between the stress abiotic and the SFM strains, indicating that one strain is out in the SF-bacteria strains, which is identified as Fuk 11_7 (Bacillus sp.); it is a very sensitive bacterial strain to any abiotic stress.

In detail, the Priestia group is capable of metabolizing 77 compounds; however, these isolates could not grow or use the following sources such as \u03b1-D-glucose, D-mannose, and the organic acids such as formic, \u03b3-Hydroxybutyric, and glutamic acids. While the isolates related to B. pumilus could metabolize acetic and citric acid, but they could not grow with D-galactose as the only carbon source. In the remaining compounds, the response varied depending on the isolate. The B. thuringiensis group shares certain characteristics with each strain as incapable of metabolizing \u03b1-D-glucose and D-gluconic and D-saccharic acids. These strains could metabolize 18 compounds, such as gentiobiose, raffinose, and some acids, such as glucosaminic, \u03b1-ketoglutaric, and malonic acids. Peribacillus isolates can synthesize around 26 compounds such as glycerol-phosphates, citric and phydroxyphenlyacetic acids. However, these isolates cannot grow in media with carbon sources such as D-galactose, D-mannose, D-glucuronic and succinic acids. Furthermore, Viridibacillus, Lysinibacillus, and Solibacillus isolates could not grow with glucosamine-bound compounds, D-mannose, and some organic acids such as malonic and D-saccharic acids (Figure 4, Table S3). Lastly, Paenibacillus share the characteristics of metabolizing some organic acids, maltose, and \u03b2-methyl-D-glucoside. However, Paenibacillus isolates cannot metabolize 18 compounds such as organic acids such as succinic acid, and sugars such as D-galactose, and D-mannose (Figure 4, Table S3). On the other hand, the fungal isolates\u2019 metabolic profiles were examined, as shown in Figure 5. These fungal isolates were correlated by the positive responses to metabolize or assimilate dextrin, glycogen, D-melibiose, cis-aconitic, \u03b1-hydroxybutyric, \u03b1-ketobutyric, succinamic acids, and L-ornithine. In the case of malonic acid, lactic, acetic, propionic, formic, and \u03b1-ketoglutaric acids were compounds assimilated or metabolized by almost all fungal isolates except Fuk 59. The fungal isolates share certain characteristics by the phylogenetic group as follows: Trichoderma isolates metabolize 57 compounds (Figure 5). However, these isolates cannot grow in D-cellobiose, L-fucose, and D-galactose. Penicillium isolates have in common that they could metabolize 34 compounds, but these isolates are not capable of growing in the presence of D-cellobiose, D-galactose, \u03b1-D-glucose, and L-rhamnose. The isolates\u2019 responses in front of the remaining compounds depend on the strains, including inconclusive ones (Figure 5, Table S4). Fusarium could not metabolize \u03b1-D-glucose and D-glucuronic acid; however, the isolates could metabolize the remaining compounds. Mortierella could not grow with 23 compounds such as using \u03b1-D-glucose and D-mannitol as thesole carbon source, and organic acids such as D-saccharic, succinic, L-glutamic acids, and compounds with glucosephosphate (Figure 5).

            "text": "The diversity of SFM in spore form are dormant species with great importance worldwide and have been examined with various techniques and criteria [14,27,28]. However, most of the descriptions are focused on public health and poorly describe them from the perspective of plant\u2013microbe interactions or as an inoculant [4,14]. Our study focused on fast-growing SFM isolation and their characteristics as future plant partners with fast break dormancy strains, and their positive effects on the plant growth or health. This is because a slow-growing group of microbes could not compete with fast-growing bacteria and fungi, especially during the early phases of crop development where microbial diversity establishes itself, even after harvest [3,4]. Additionally, our study will increase the knowledge of SFM in Fukushima prefecture after a long-term halt to crop cultivation in many sampling areas. The SFM were found independently from rhizosphere and soil samples due to the large range of environmental conditions [27\u201329] in Fukushima prefecture. However, low diversity of SFM or absence was observed in some samples, which indicates that the method used may not be the most suitable for studying SFM diversity. Other reasons, such as the selection method, also need a longer period for isolation (\u226548 h), and out of the isolates reported in this study other species may need to take more than 72 h to break spore dormancy. Lastly, some SFM might be uncultivable because the media use is unsuitable or the strains become uncultivable after changing their ecological niche [13,28\u201330]. Our results indicate that the rhizosphere is a better source than the soil and bacterial isolates are more frequent and faster growers than the fungal type [3,13]. This is attributable to the ability of these SF-bacteria to better adapt than fungi, which gives them the capability to survive abiotic stresses, nutrient deficient, and compound productions such as biofilms [27,31]. In this study, we tried to cover the fast-growing SFM independently from the season due to decomposition deceleration; bacterial and fungal biomass and sporulation rates change according to the type of origin sample or area in one region whether it is a wetland,\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 232 16 of 19\ntemperate stream, or arable land, in concordance to previous reports [13,32\u201336]. SFM populations with different ecological or agricultural conditions are active colonizers of these ecosystems, thereby showing some specialized physiological functions associated. It was also observed that in the field with different stages of plant succession or rice development, bacteria and fungi seem to be the main colonizers, which was in agreement with our results wherein the bacteria were dominant [3,28,29,34\u201342]. Similarly, our results suggested that the class Bacilli dominated fast growth and fastbreaking spore dormancy [34]. Garbeva et al. [34] described SF-bacteria as Bacilli-related community structures with high diversity among the order Bacillales, including Bacillus as main genus, their changes have been found under different agricultural regimes such as in permanent grassland, arable land, and under long term presence of grass in soil [34\u201336]. In contrast, our results are somewhat similar but include the predominance of filamentous fungi (Ascomycota) as the main group, which is supported by Sharma et al. [3]; it described that in paddy fields under different growth or decomposition stages, the fungal community and their ratio changes, and not only SF-bacteria [15]. Thus, these results could be associated more with the significant interaction between the time of decomposition and emersion for sporulation of fungal communities, which is related to the enzymatic process of C mineralization, N, P, and S cycles [3,28,29,33\u201335]. Furthermore, SFM development is commonly attributed to the level of adaptation to a specific niche in terms of the ability to utilize available nutrient resources and tolerate metabolite accumulation or deficiency, such as proline, glycine, trehalose, sucrose and mannitol; on the other hand, these compounds cause oxidative and osmotic stresses in plants [9,15]. Our results indicated that SFM isolates utilize or metabolize these compounds, as demonstrated by Biolog\u2122, and indirectly suggested that the presence of SFM in the soil might improve the rice seedling under stress or stress tolerance in plants. Moreover, the Biolog\u2122 method was used as an Eco-Plates, which can provide an overview and screening of the metabolic fingerprint characteristics of SFM in a short time [31,34,38,39]. The physiological profiling is accompanied by microbial identification for future investigations of microbial community structure and applications in the field [13,30,37,38]. The immediate results can be compared with other studies; for example, until the 2020 outcome, pathogenic spore-formers do not grow below pH 4.5 and the species encountered in spoilaged foods are not the same as in our study [14,27,39]. Therefore, the metabolic profile and other physiological results supported the adequate selection of SFM and the isolates\u2019 ability for use as a possible response to climatic changes or different crop cultivation due to its adaptability [13]. Moreover, our results suggested that SFM positively promoted plant growth through various mechanisms, such as plant hormone and ESP production, regulating nutrient exchange, and releasing stress-protectant compounds. At the same time, our SFM metabolic results support, for example, cytokinin production [1,16] by the assimilation of amino acids or sugar-bound and phosphate-bound compounds [15]. The stress-protectant compounds could be the result of SFM biosynthesis of total soluble sugar, proline, and trehalose or by regulating metabolites such as pyruvic acid, succinic acid, and uridine [9,15]. Future experimentation is needed for different SFM strains, which will help elucidate the underlying mechanisms and ecology, such as signaling, colonization, and SFM community interactions. On the other hand, the spore resistance of SFM is related to the sporulation performance at optimal vegetative growth conditions resulting in the highest sporulation efficiency and spore resistance [14]. Until now, the major influence of sporulation was well reported to be the temperature conditions; based on this, knowing other factors could help increase their resistance to many abiotic stress factors and improve the predictability of spore behavior [1,8,14]. Additionally, this can change according to the succession in the environmental conditions and plant stage, similar to the ripening stages of SF-bacteria in cheese manufacturing [28,37]. Consequently, our results indicate that Bacilli isolates from Fukushima can tolerate low temperatures and acidic conditions and can also be heat-stable spores, as reported pre-\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 232 17 of 19\nviously [1,4]. Moreover, the SFM isolates are mainly aerobically forming with a mesophilic preference (optimal growth temperature between 10 \u25e6C and 30 \u25e6C) with stable spores forming at 65 \u25e6C. Hence, previous studies indicated that endophytic Penicillium, Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Bacillus, and Paenibacillus reduced pathogenic fungi and also induced the biomass yield of cultivated plants [12,28,29,36,37,40] which is similar to our results in the promotion of growth for Oryza sativa L.; however, further experiments are required for assertive use as a future pathogenic antagonist. Finally, physiological results and their interaction with rice can be correlated; for example, those SFM isolates capable of metabolizing D,L,\u03b1-glycerol-phosphate, \u03b1-D-glucose1-phosphate or D-glucose-6-phosphate, also have good P abilities reported in the Pikoskaya medium. At the same time, these results work as guidelines for other unknown strains, such as Viridibacillus, Lysinibacillus, and Bisporella reported in this study. Those strains are reported as PGPR or are known to be P solubilizers such as P. megaterium [4]. Altogether, this suggests that some species could solubilize P, K, and other minerals and fix nitrogen to promote plant growth. Similarly, it could control plant diseases [3,4,13,41], especially in Fukushima area, with the relationship between K/Cs uptake. Thus, their physiological role was one factor behind their plant association or interactions throughout [1,42]. In summary, these results suggest that SF-bacteria development and sporulation may be more resilient in shorter growth periods, and their effect as inoculants may be shorter than fungi; however, the effect of the fungi could remain longer than bacteria [13]."

Moreover, further research is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of strains for rice and other crops in field conditions with low nutrient supply as a biofertilizer or against pathogens as biocontrol.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11020232/s1, Figure S1: Phylogenetic analysis of Fukushima isolates based on 16S rRNA sequences.
