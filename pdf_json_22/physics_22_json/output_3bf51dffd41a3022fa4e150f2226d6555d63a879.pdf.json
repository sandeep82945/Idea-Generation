    "abstractText": "In analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, one-dimensional (1D) electromagnetic (EM) crystals can exhibit nontrivial topological properties. In particular, when a nontrivial EM crystal is in contact with its trivial counterpart, a topologically protected interface state is formed. While much attention has been focused on single interface state, multiple interface states can interact collectively when under suitable conditions, giving rise to trivial or nontrivial band topologies resembling to the standard SSH model. Here, we study the topological properties of 1D metallic superlattices that support multiple interface states. We first demonstrate single interface state exists at the boundary between two topologically distinct metallic arrays that carry Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons. Such interface state is then used as the building block for further constructing the superlattices. By exploiting the separation between two dimerized interface states and the distinct interand intra-interface configurations to facilitate different intracell and intercell interactions, we vary the band topology of the superlattices. More importantly, new superlattice interface state is formed when trivial and nontrivial superlattices are brought together. The superlattice interface state is found to have smaller angular divergence and longer localization length than its single counterpart, thus is desired for robust signal transmission and high finesse cavity.",

INTRODUCTION\nTopological photonics has aroused much interest lately in realizing the so-called\ntopological protected interface state [1-3]. When two photonic systems with distinct topological properties are brought together, an energy state must exist at the interface and spectrally lies within the band gap of the surrounding bulks [1-3]. Such bulk-edge correspondence yields the interface state which is robust against disorders and has become an attractive candidate for signal transmission [1-3]. In fact, various two-dimensional (2D) electromagnetic systems spanning from visible to microwave frequency have been demonstrated to support one-dimensional (1D) interface, or edge, state and backscattering free wave propagation has also been reported [3,4-10].\nOther than 2D systems, 1D systems are also of interest because they support zero-\ndimensional interface state or soliton and serve as a toy model for studying the topological physics [11-16]. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which originally was proposed to explain the charge transport properties of the conductive polyacetylene polymer, has provided the basic tool for studying topological insulators [18,19]. Its tight binding approach formulates the bipartite chains with different intracell and intercell interactions, leading to different Zak phases [20]. For the chain that possesses inversion symmetry, the Zak phase is quantized to 0\nor , defining whether it is topologically trivial or nontrivial [21]. For a nontrivial finite chain, two degenerate edge states, with energy lying within the band gap, are found at the terminations [20]. The model has successfully captured the importance of using Zak phase to characterize the band topology and the formation of edge states. Since then, SSH model has been generalized to include different elements such as long-range order [22,23], non-Hermiticity [24], higher dimensionality [16,25,26], Fano resonance [27], etc.\nIf one considers the interface state as a localized atomic orbital, it is possible to go beyond\nthe standard SHH model by using two interface states as a building block for constructing superlattices. The superlattices may manifest different topological phases and, more importantly, new interface state. In contrast to the superlattices studied by Midya and Feng [28] and Wang et al [29] where multipartite basis is used to support higher order bands and multiple interface states, the superlattices proposed here involve bipartite interface states to form the basis. In fact, Munoz et al have theoretically studied such topological superlattices and found superlattice interface state (SIS) exists [30]. It is revealed SIS possesses longer localization length and is more resistance to on-site disorders than the regular interface state\n[30]. As a result, it may result in better wave propagation and less distortion in signal transmission.\nHere, we demonstrate the SIS from 1D plasmonic superlattices. First, we find by varying\nthe groove width of 1D Au plasmonic crystals (PmCs), band inversion is observed by angleresolved reflectivity spectroscopy and verified by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. In particular, the band topology can simply be determined by examining the spectral positions of the dark and bright coupled modes at the Brillouin zone center. When two topological trivial and nontrivial PmCs are bound together, an interface state is found within the bulk band gap. The interface state is then used as the building block for constructing the superlattices. By using a pair of interface states to form bipartite basis, we observe, analogous to the PmC counterparts, two dark and bright superlattice modes and band inversion can occur when varying the separation between two interfaces. We study the intracell and intercell coupling constants by temporal coupled mode theory (CMT), and find the constants are consistent with the SSH model in which stronger intercell coupling than that of intracell yields nontrivial properties. Two trivial and nontrivial superlattices are connected to demonstrate\nSIS. The SIS is shown to have longer localization length of 15.7 m compared to 9.96 m determined from the single interface state. II. BAND INVERSION AND ZAK PHASE OF PLASMONIC CRYSTALS\nWe first study the topological properties of 1D Au PmCs. The PmCs are fabricated by\nusing focused ion beam (FIB) and their scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are shown in the insets of Fig. 1(a) \u2013 (e), showing they are periodic rectangular grooves with period P = 600 nm, groove height H = 30 nm, and groove width W varying from 100 to 500 nm. After the sample preparation, they are then characterized by a homebuilt Fourier space optical microscope for measuring the angle- and wavelength-resolved reflectivity mapping [31,32]. Briefly, a supercontinuum white light laser is illuminated on the sample at a well-defined\nincident angle  via the microscope objective lens and the reflection from the sample is collected by the same objective lens and a spectrometer-based CCD detector for spectroscopy\n[33]. By varying  and at the same time measuring the reflectivity spectrum, we contour plot the reflectivity mapping. The p-polarized reflectivity mappings of the PmCs taken along the\n-X direction are displayed in Fig. 1(a) \u2013 (e), showing the n = \u00b11 Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), as indicated by two dash lines that are calculated by the phase matching\nequation\n2 2 1 sin\n1\nAu\nAu\nn P          = +    +     , where Au is the dielectric constant of Au, are excited\nand they cross at normal incidence [34]. At the cross-point, the SPPs couple to form two dark and bright modes separated by an energy band gap [34-36]. The dark mode is nonradiative whereas the bright mode is radiative, giving rise to high and low reflectivity [36]. We plot the spectral positions of the dark and bright modes in Fig. 1(f) as a function of W. When W increases, one sees the band gap shrinks gradually, closes at W = 300 nm, and then reopens again afterwards. At the same time, the dark and bright modes switch places after the closure of the gap. We note the dark mode is a symmetry protected bound states in the continuum (BIC), featuring zero radiation damping [37]. As the dark and bright modes are associated with different SPP field symmetries, the interchange of two modes implies the occurrence of band inversion and the presence of a Dirac point at W = 300 nm [13,33,38]. More importantly, such\nband inversion also signifies the Zak phase of the -1 SPP band changes from 0 to  or vice versa [12].\nWe perform FDTD simulations to further study the band topology. The p-polarized\nreflectivity mappings based on the same structures are provided in the Supplementary Information, and they agree with the experiment [33]. We then use the dipole source excitation method to calculate the electric near-field patterns of the -1 SPP band across the Brillouin zone from k = -/P to /P m-1 in the Supplementary Information [33]. The field patterns at the k = 0 and /P m-1 for W = 100, 200, 400, and 500 nm PmCs are summarized in Fig. 2(a) \u2013 (d). At k = 0 m-1, we see the field symmetry in fact changes from odd to even with respect to the groove center when W increases, corresponding to the mode changes from dark to bright. On the other hand, at k = /P m-1, the fields are even for all PmCs. Therefore, the field symmetries at two k points change for W = 100 and 200 nm PmCs but remain the same for W = 400 and\n500 nm PmCs, yielding Zak phase =  and 0 accordingly [37]. To directly determine the Zak phase, we employ the Wilson loop approach to calculate the Zak phase of the -1 SPP bulk band [39]. The Zak phase is defined as [21]:\n( )Pn nn P\nX k dk \n \u2212 =  , (1)\nwhere ( )nnX k is the Berry connection and given as [13,39]:\n( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n* n,k nk\nunit cell\nnn *\nnk n,k\nunit cell\nu ( x ) i u x x dx\nk X k\nu x x u ( x )dx\n\n\n\n =\n\n , (2)\nwhere n,ku ( x ) is the periodic function of the electric field components of the SPP Bloch\nwavefunctions and  is the permittivity. The evolutions of individal phase difference, which is\n( )nnX k k , of the -1 SPP band across the Brillouin zone with k = 0.04\u03c0/P are plotted in Fig\n3(a) \u2013 (d), and the integrations give the Zak phases to be  for small W and 0 for larger W, in consistent with the results deduced from the field symmetry. We also have studied the Zak phases of the n = 0 SPP band, which is beyond the light line, by using the field symmetry\napproach for all PmCs and they are found to be  [33]. As the topology of the PmCs is defined by the sum of the Zak phases of all the isolated bands below the gap [12], we conclude the W = 100 and 200 nm PmCs are topological trival whereas W = 400 and 500 nm PmCs are nontrival."

            "text": "Once the topological properties of the PmCs have been studied, we then construct a PmC\nheterostructure with different topological phases on two sides to produce an interface state. We fabricate the heterostructure by FIB and the SEM image is displayed in the inset of Fig. 4(a), showing it has P and H = 600 and 40 nm and W = 100 (nontrivial) and 500 (trivial) nm on the left- and right-hand sides of the interface, which is indicated by the dash line. The p-polarized\nreflectivity mapping taken along the -X direction is shown in Fig. 4(a), showing the +1 and - 1 SPPs cross at normal incidence to yield two upper and lower bulk modes located at 610 and 640 nm and a band gap. However, unlike the regular PmCs, as two sides from the heterostructure carry different topological phases, a localized resonance with low reflectivity\nis clearly observed at  ~ 622 nm within the band gap. The resonance has a narrow angular divergence of 2.1o if estimated from the FWHM of the angular profile [33]. For verification, we have simulated the reflectivity mapping of a similar finite heterostructure in Fig. 4(b), and\nit agrees with experiment that a localized mode is present at  = 635 nm in the middle of the band gap together with two upper and lower bulk modes at 615 and 660 nm. We notice the mapping taken at positive and negative incident angles are slightly different due to the finite simulation size effect in which the numbers of unit cells on each side are limited to 40 to save the computational time. By examining the angular profile of the localized mode, the divergence is found to be 4.65o [33]. To check the localized mode is in fact the interface state, we simulate the near-field patterns in logarithmic scale at 20 nm above the heterostructure across the whole spectrum in Fig. 4(c) under normal incidence. The topological trivial and\nnontrivial PmCs are the left- and right-hand sides of the interface which is located at x = 0 m. The fields are visible at the wavelengths corresponding to the upper and lower bulk modes as\nwell as the localized mode. The fields observed from the bright mode, in which its wavelengths are 615 and 660 nm for the nontrivial and trivial PmCs, are always stronger than those from the dark counterparts because of the strong radiative coupling from the incidence to the resonance despite a lower quality factor [40]. More importantly, we find the localized mode is spatially localized at the interface and its fields decay rapidly into the bulk regions. The crosssection field profile at 635 nm is plotted in Fig. 4(d), showing and the fields decay asymmetrically and exponentially from the interface into two sides. The exponential decays follow well with the edge state from the SSH model [20,30] and their decay lengths are\ndetermined to be 4.17 and 3.45 m for the trivial and nontrivial parts, respectively. We then Fourier transform the field pattern to k space in Fig. 4(d) and the localization length is deduced\nto be 9.96 m."

            "text": "The interface state can serve as the building block for assembling plasmonic superlattice.\nIn fact, if each interface state can be treated as a single orbital, collective interaction between its neighboring interface states is then possible for producing continuous energy bands. Such interaction should be examined in prior to studying the superlattice. Therefore, we first demonstrate the interaction between two interface states by simulation [41,42]. We simulate two series of finite nT/mN/nT and nN/mT/nN tri-structures, where T and N denote trivial (W = 100 nm) and nontrivial (500 nm) PmCs, and n/m = 10/2, 9/4 and 8/6 are the numbers of PmC unit cells. All of them have a pair of interface states with different separations. In addition, two series have either N or T PmC as the middle layer. The corresponding p-polarized reflectivity mappings taken along the direction perpendicular to the grooves are illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b), showing, for all structures, two discrete interface coupled modes separated by an avoided crossing are seen within the bulk band gap. However, their characteristics are strongly system dependent. While they all show the size of the avoided crossing shrinks when the separation between two interfaces increases, the spectral positions of the bright and dark modes depend on the middle layer. Bright mode is observed at short wavelength in T/N/T but is flipped to long wavelength when N/T/N is used [42]. The near-field patterns of the bright and dark modes for 10T/2N/10T and 10N/2T/10N taken under normal incidence at 20 nm above the surface are calculated in Fig. 5(c) and (d). One sees the fields of the bright and dark modes are odd and even with respect to the center, indicating the field symmetries are strongly associated with the topological phase of the middle layer.\nThe interaction constant between two interface states can be determined by CMT in which\nthe complex eigenfrequencies of the bright and dark modes are given as\n( )oi i i      +  = +   + , where o and  are the angular frequency and decay rate of the\nuncoupled interface state and  and   are the real and imaginary parts of the interaction constant [33,43]. Given 2  + \u2212 \u2212 = and 2+ \u2212  \u2212 = , we use the  and  of the bright and dark modes from Fig. 5(a) and (b) to determine  and   accordingly and the results are plotted in Fig. 5(e). While we see  in both series decreases with increasing separation, it is negative in T/N/T but positive in N/T/N. Likewise,   also exhibits opposite signs in two series despite their trend is similar. Therefore, the choice of the middle layer is likely to introduce a phase in the near- and far-field couplings between two interface states,\ngoverning both  and   [44]. We then calculate the moduli  of two series in Fig. 5(f),\nindicating they are almost the same and decrease with increasing the separation distance. As a result, we conclude the interface separation serves as a parameter for controlling different intracell and intercell interactions when formulating the bipartite unit cell in superlattice."

Therefore, following our earlier study on two coupled states, we expect they should exhibit different intercell and intracell interactions in which the intracell interaction is stronger than that of the intercell in 2T/2N/2T\nbut is weaker in 1T/4N/1T. Their p-polarized reflectivity mappings taken along the -X direction are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). In contrast to the heterostructure where only an isolated interface state is observed, two continuous dispersive bands arising from the collective interaction between the interface states are present within the bulk band gap [30]. Two interface bands cross and produce a new band gap in which its size is much smaller than that of the bulk counterpart [30]. In addition, two dark and bright modes are present, and their positions depend on the intra-interface separation. In analogy to the groove width dependence found in regular PmCs, we see the dark and bright modes are observed at short and long wavelengths when two interfaces in the unit cell are close to each other but switch places when they are farther apart. Band inversion may have occurred, signifying the superlattices carry\ndifferent topological phases as well. The simulated reflectivity mappings of two superlattices are provided in the Supplementary Information for reference [33].\nTo examine the band topology of the lower interface band, we have simulated the near-\nfield patterns of two superlattices across the first Brillouin zone in the Supplementary Information [33]. Their field patterns at the zone center and boundary are summarized in Fig. 6(c) and (d), showing the field symmetries are both even in 2T/2N/2T superlattice but are even\nand odd in 1T/4N/1T, facilitating 0 and  Zak phases. To double check, we use the Wilson loop method to determine the Zak phases. The individual phase differences are plotted in Fig. 6(e) and (f) as a function of k and the integrals yields Zak phase = 0 and  for 2T/2N/2T and 1T/4N/1T superlattices, respectively, and they are consistent with the field symmetry results. We also see the interface bands can interact with the bulk bands to form avoided crossings at  ~ 4.4o. The crossing in 1T/4N/1T is larger than that in 2T/2N/2T, indicating different interactions between the interface and bulk bands."

The topological properties of the PmCs have been studied by angle- and wavelength-resolved reflectivity spectroscopy and FDTD simulations. For PmCs, it is found the topological phase can be changed from trivial to nontrivial by varying the groove width. The spectral positions of the dark and bright coupled modes at the Brillouin zone center serve as a good indicator to reveal the field symmetry as well as the Zak phases of the plasmonic bulk bands. Well defined interface state is observed within the bulk band gap at the boundary between trivial and nontrivial PmCs both experimentally and numerically. Once the interface state is available, it is then used as the building block for constructing superlattices. We then show the interaction between two interface states strongly depends on their separation and thus the intracell and intercell interactions in bipartite superlattice can be engineered by varying the intra- and interinterface distances. Topologically trivial and nontrivial superlattices have been fabricated and their characteristics are consistent with the SSH model. Finally, two superlattices carrying distinct topological phases are connected to demonstrate SIS. The SIS is shown to have longer\nlocalization length of 15.7 m when compared to the 9.96 m from the single interface state. As SLS is more resistance to on-site disorders than the regular interface state, our results may provide an approach for more robust signal transmission and higher finesse cavity. IX.

Briefly, a broadband supercontinuum laser from a photonic crystal fiber is collimated and then passed through a set of polarizers, wave plates, and lenses before being focused onto the back focal plane (BFP) of a 100X objective lens (OB) with numerical aperture = 0.9. By displacing the focused spot across the BFP of the objective lens using a motorized translation stage, the light exiting from\nthe objective lens is collimated again and the incident polar angle  onto the sample is given\nby sin = d/f, where d is the distance between the focused spot and the optical axis of the\nobjective lens and f is the focal length of the objective. In addition, the azimuth angle  can be\nvaried by a motorized rotation sample stage to align the incident plane to the -X direction of the array. The light reflected from the array is then collected by the same objective lens and passes through another set of analyzers and lenses before being detected by a spectrometerbased CCD detector.\nFig. S1.
