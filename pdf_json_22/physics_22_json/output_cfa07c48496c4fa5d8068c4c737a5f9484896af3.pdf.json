    "abstractText": "The deflection angle \u03c6 of charged signals in general charged spacetime in the strong deflection limit is analyzed in this work using a perturbative method generalized from the neutral signal case. The solved \u03c6 naturally contains the finite distance effect and takes a quasi-power series form with a logarithmic divergence at the leading order. The coefficients of the series contain both the gravitational and electric contributions. Using the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m spacetime as an example, we found that an electric repulsion (or attraction) tends to decrease (or increase) the critical impact parameterbc. If the repulsion is strong enough, thenbc can shrink to zero and the critical particle sphere r0c will disappear. These results are applied to the gravitational lensing of charge signal, from which we solved the image positions, their magnifications and time delays. It is found that in general, the electric repulsion (or attraction) will decrease (or increase) the image apparent angles, the black hole shadow sizes as well as their magnifications but increase (or decrease) the time delays.",

            "text": "Deflection of light in gravitational field was one of the most important evidence for the establishment of General Relativity (GR) [1]. Based on this, the gravitational lensing (GL) phenomenon has been developed into a powerful tool in astronomy. GL can not only link the properties of the source, the lens and the messengers to the observables [2\u20139], but also be used to test gravitational theories beyond GR [10,11].\nWith the discovery of supernova neutrinos [12,13] and blazer neutrinos [14,15], the gravitational wave [16\u201320], and the more historical cosmic rays [21], people become more\na e-mail: junjijia@whu.edu.cn (corresponding author)\nand more interested in the deflection and GL of massive signals. Among these, cosmic rays with ultra-high energies are known to be composed of charged massive particles of protons and heavier nuclei [22]. Therefore, not only are they massive but carry charge and experience electric interaction if the spacetime is also charged.\nPreviously, there have been a large amount of studies on the trajectory of charged signals in electrically or magnetically charged spacetimes, including the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m (RN) spacetime in the former case [23\u201326], and some particular spacetime background supplemented by a weak magnetic field in the latter [27\u201329]. However, most of these are either concerned with the circular motion of the signal or the general features of the motion. Concentrating on the deflection and GL of charged signals, then they have been studied in the weak field limit in arbitrary static and spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetimes using perturbative method [30] and in particular spherically or axially symmetric spacetimes using Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem method [31\u201334]. It was shown that in general, the repulsion (or attraction) between small signal and lens charges will increase (or decrease) the deflection angle at the leading order, i.e., at the order O(M/b) where M and b are the mass of the lens and impact parameter of the signal respectively. For a gravitational-electric dual lensing in the weak field limit, this implies that in the repulsion (or attraction) case the impact parameters, the apparent angles, the magnifications and total travel times of the images will be smaller (or larger) [30].\nHowever, these results are more or less intuitively expected because in the weak field limit, gravity resembles its Newtonian limit and therefore both the gravitational and electric forces take the inverse square form. Consequently the physics due to both interactions can be expected in the same way, except a possible choice of signs of the electric interaction. In contrast, in the strong field limit (SFL), GR deviates most\nfrom its Newtonian limit but the Coulomb potential keeps its form. Then one would naturally anticipate more interesting interplay or competition between these two kinds of interactions and more nontrivial results are expected.\nThe signal deflection and GL in the SFL have been studied for a relatively long time. Darwin first pointed out the existence of the relativistic image sequences around the Schwarzschild black hole (BH) [35], which was later restudied by Virbhadra and Ellis [36,37]. The magnification of such images was first studied by Ohanian [38]. Bozza et al. systematically studied the GL in the SFL for null signals in SSS spacetimes and in equatorial plane of stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes [39\u201341], and then many authors followed in particular spacetimes [42\u201352]. In Refs. [53,54] we were able to develop a perturbative method applicable to arbitrary SSS spacetime to study the deflection, GL and time delay for neutral timelike signals. It was found that in the SFL, i.e. as the impact parameter b approaches its critical value bc, the deflection takes a simple quasi-power series form\n\u03c6 = \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n[ \u2212Cn ln ( 1 \u2212 bc\nb\n) + Dn ]( 1 \u2212 bc\nb\n)n , (1)\nand the time delay has a simple physical interpretation. In this work, we would like to examine how the electric interaction will affect these results, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will show that our method not only works for charged signals in arbitrary SSS charged spacetime, but automatically takes into account the finite distance effect of the source and observer.\nIt seems also useful to explain in general why we study electrically charged BH at all. It is a general belief by many astronomers that BH\u2019s are electrically neutral in the long run: even if they are charged initially, their charges will be neutralized through selective accretion of the opposite charges. However, even if this is true, there are still at least the following reasons that might necessitate the study of the electric effects. The first is that although a small BH charge (for RN BH, this means Q/M 1) will not produce a large gravitational effect, its effect to charged signals might still be very apparent, as can be seen in Fig. 6 for the effect of a small charge on the Einstein ring size. The fundamental reason lies in the fact that the strength of electromagnetic interaction is immensely stronger than that of the gravitational interaction. The second reason is that the neutralization process takes time to finish. This time not only depends on the amount of charge the BH initially carries, but also the effective accretion rate of the opposite charge. When the latter is small comparing to its total mass (e.g. Sgr A* supermassive BH has a mass \u223c 4 \u00d7 106M , while its accretion rate is estimated to be at the order of (10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22126)M /[year] [55\u201357]), the neutralization time might also be long enough\nto be observed. In general, assuming a BH is weakly charged so that Q/M = \u03b71 1 and accretes at a low rate so that M\u0307/M = \u03b72 1/year, the time for this BH to become neutral is \u03b71/\u03b72 [year], which might still be long enough depending on the exact value of \u03b71 and \u03b72 to observe the effect of the charge.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we lay out the general equations involved in the problem. In Sect. 3, the perturbative method to compute the deflection angle and total travel time with electric interaction is presented. In Sect. 4, we take the RN spacetime as an example to show how the formalism works in a particular spacetime. The corresponding GL and BH shadow are analyzed in Sect. 5, where the images\u2019 apparent angles, their magnifications, time delays as well as the BH shadow sizes are solved. Section 6 closes the work by a discussion. Throughout the paper we work in the units where G = c = 1/(4\u03c0 0) = 1."

            "text": "We first lay out the preliminary quantities and equations that are necessary for the discussion of the problem. Although this work studies the deflection of charged signals in the SFL, some basic equations and definitions, such as the equation of motion (3) and definition of deflection and travel time (7), will be similar to those in Ref. [30], which studied the deflection in the weak field limit.\nWe start from the most general SSS metric, which can be described by the line element\nds2 = \u2212A(r)dt2 + B(r)dr2 + C(r)(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62), (2)\nwhere t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6 are coordinates and A(r), B(r) and C(r) are functions of the radial coordinate only.\nWhen the signal is charged and the electromagnetic force is taken into account, the signal will not follow the geodesic but the Lorentz equation [58]. For simplicity, in this work we will only consider the effect of an electric field but not the magnetic field because the later will spoil the SSS symmetry. That is, in the four potential A\u03bc of the electromagnetic field, we assume A0(r) = 0 and Ai = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3). Besides, due to this SSS symmetry, we can always assume without losing any generality that the trajectory lies in the equatorial plane so that \u03b8(\u03c4 ) = \u03c0/2.\nWith these considerations, then the Lorentz equations after the first integrals are [30]\nt\u0307 = E + qA0 mA , (3a) \u03c6\u0307 = L mC , (3b)\nr\u03072 = [ (E + qA0)2 \u2212 m2A ] C \u2212 L2A\nm2ABC , (3c)\nwhere dot is the derivative with respect to the proper time \u03c4 , q and m are the charge and mass of the signal, E and L are integration constants that can be interpreted as the energy and the angular momentum of the particle respectively. Comparing to the case without the electric interaction (setting q to zero), we observe that the changes in these equations happen in and only in terms containing E : all E is replaced by the E+qA0(r), i.e., the electric potential energy manifests itself in this way. We emphasize that although algebraically this might look like a simple modification to the motion equations, its physical implication is not simple at all because of the extra electromagnetic interaction, and the solution to these equations will also be significantly more difficult.\nIn asymptotically flat spacetimes, on which this work will concentrate, L and E can be related to the impact parameter b and asymptotic velocity v of the signal\nL = |r \u00d7 p| = mv\u221a 1 \u2212 v2 b, (4a) E = m\u221a 1 \u2212 v2 . (4b)\nMoreover, L can also be related to the shortest approach r0 of the trajectory, which is defined through r\u0307 |r=r0 = 0. Using Eq. (3c), the equation determining r0 becomes L = \u221a\n[(E + qA0(r0))2 \u2212 m2A(r0)]C(r0)/A(r0). (5) Equations (4a) and (5) establish the following correspondence between b and r0,\n1 b =\n\u221a E2 \u2212 m2\u221a\n(E + qA0(r0))2 \u2212 m2A(r0)\n\u221a A(r0)\nC(r0) , (6)\nand this allows us in principle to express the deflection angle and time delay in either of them.\nFor a signal from a source located at radius rs to an observer at rd (see Fig. 1), from Eq. (3) we see then the change of the angular coordinate \u03c6 and the total travel time\nt become respectively\n\u03c6 = [\u222b rs r0 + \u222b rd r0 ] L \u221a B/C\u221a[(E + qA0)2/A \u2212 m2]C \u2212 L2 dr,\n(7a)\nt = [\u222b rs r0 + \u222b rd r0 ] (E + qA0)\n\u221a BC\nLA\n\u00d7 L\u221a[(E + qA0)2/A \u2212 m2]C \u2212 L2 dr. (7b)\nFor general SSS spacetime metric and potential A0(r), these integrals usually can not be worked out analytically even for the simplest RN case. Therefore, some special techniques are required to approximate them. The technique we will use in this work is actually a generalization of the perturbative method developed in Refs. [53,54] for neutral signals to the current case, in which the electric interaction is now taken into account.\nIn the SFL, the spacetime allows the existence of some critical value r0c of the closest approach r0. When r0 \u2192 r+0c, the trajectory will circulate many times around the center before propagating to the observer; while below it, the signal will enter the event horizon and therefore not reach the observer anymore. Previously, the existence of such r0c has been known for many BH spacetimes for photons (the photon sphere) (see [59] for the condition of its existence in SSS spacetime), and for massive signals too (the particle sphere (PS)) [53,60]. In this work, because of the presence of the electric interaction, the existence and size of r0c might both be affected. Therefore, next, we derive the equation determining r0c in this new case first. This process will also help us to better understand its dependence on various parameters of the spacetime and signal.\nWe first re-write Eq. (3c) into the following form\nAB m2\nE2\n( dr\nd\u03c4\n)2\n+ [ A ( 1\nC\nL2\nE2 + m\n2\nE2\n) \u2212 2q\nE A0 \u2212 q\n2 E2 A20 ] = 1. (8)\nWe recognize that the radial motion then depends on (m, L , E, q) entirely through the three ratios m/E, L/E and q/E , which are constants of motion. From Eq. (4), we see that the former two can be connected to v and b, and in the null limit of the signal, the Am2/E2 term in the square bracket automatically decouples from Eq. (8). Using Eq. (8), we can then define the second term on the left hand side as the effective potential\nVeff = A ( 1\nC\nL2\nE2 + m\n2\nE2\n) \u2212 2q\nE A0 \u2212 q\n2\nE2 A20. (9)\nWhen A = 1/B and A0 = 0, as in many well-known SSS chargeless spacetimes, this reduces to the effective potential in the corresponding spacetimes (up to a constant) [60]. The terms proportional to qA0/E and its square in Eq. (9) are due to the electric interaction. From Eq. (8) we see that the allowed range of r for a signal is when Veff(r) is smaller than the right hand side of Eq. (8), i.e.,\nVeff(r) \u2264 1. (10) The equal sign of this equation is actually equivalent to Eq. (5) and therefore also determines the closest radius r0.\nNow for many interesting spacetimes, such as the Gibbons\u2013Maeda\u2013Garfinkle\u2013Horowitz\u2013Strominger (GM GHS) [61\u201363] and charged Horndeski [64] spacetime, their Eq. (8) also possesses a critical behavior. As certain parameter(s) in Veff(r) varies (e.g., L or equivalently b, q and Q, etc), if Veff(r) barely reaches 1 and eventually detaches from 1 (see Fig. 2), then at this point, the r0, which is defined by the equal sign of Eq. (10), ceases to exist and the signal coming from larger r will be able to continue to smaller r . This critical behavior can be thought to happen at the critical value of the above mentioned parameters. But on the other hand, since this detaching point in the radial direction is also the location of r0, it can also be thought as the critical value of r0, which we will denote as r0c. Mathematically, r0c can be determined from the conditions\ndVeff(r)\ndr \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=r0c = 0, (11a) Veff(r0c) = 1. (11b)\nAnd we can also supplement the condition\nVeff(r) < 1 for r > r0c (12)\nto ensure the signal can come from large r . Once the spacetime metric is specified, Eq. (11) will fix the value of r0c completely. Using Eq. (6), the corresponding critical impact parameter bc becomes bc = \u221a\n(E + qA0(r0c))2 \u2212 m2A(r0c)\u221a E2 \u2212 m2\n\u221a C(r0c)\nA(r0c) . (13)\nIt is necessary to point out that some spacetimes allow multiple PS at different r0c. Some can also allow the signal to enter without eventually fall into the BH, if any. In these cases, our method in the following sections will be only applicable to the case of the (effectively) outermost PS, with the signal coming from infinity turning back to infinity after circulating around this PS. If the signal enters the outer PS but bounced back and escape to infinity again, then to compute the deflection or travel time using the perturbative method, one will have to separate the trajectory to several parts and do series expansion each time."

(15)\nDenoting the inverse function of p(x) as w(x), the above means\n1 r0 = w\n( 1\nbc \u2212 1 b\n) = w ( 1 \u2212 bc/b\nbc\n) . (16)\nUsing the function w(x), we can define a change of variables in the integrals (7) from r to \u03be , which are connected by\n1 r = w\n( \u03be\nbc\n) , i.e., p ( 1\nr\n) = \u03be\nbc . (17)\nWith this, the integral limits and integrands of Eq. (7) change in the following way\nr0 \u2192 1 \u2212 bc/b, (18a) rs,d \u2192 1 \u2212 bc \u221a E2 \u2212 m2\u221a\n(E + qA0(rs,d))2 \u2212 m2A(rs,d)\n\u221a A(rs,d)\nC(rs,d)\n\u2261 \u03b7s,d , (18b) dr \u2192 \u2212 w \u2032\nbcw2 d\u03be, (18c)\nA(r) \u2192 A(1/w), B(r) \u2192 B(1/w), C(r) \u2192 C(1/w), A0(r) \u2192 A0(1/w), (18d)\nL\u221a[(E + qA0(r))2/A(r) \u2212 m2]C(r) \u2212 L2 \u2192 \u03be \u2212 1\u221a\n2 \u2212 a \u2212 \u03be\u221a\u03be \u2212 a , (18e)\nwhere w = w ( \u03be\nbc\n) and w\u2032 = d[w(x)]\ndx \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=\u03be/bc , (19)\nand in Eq. (18b) we have defined \u03b7s,d , and in Eq. (18e) and henceforth we set\na = 1 \u2212 bc/b. (20) Collecting terms in Eq. (18) together and using Eqs. (4) and (20), Eq. (7) becomes\n\u03c6 = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u222b \u03b7i\na\n\u221a B(1/w)\nC(1/w) w\u2032(\u03be \u2212 1) w2bc 1\u221a 2 \u2212 a \u2212 \u03be 1\u221a \u03be \u2212 a d\u03be.\n(21a)\nt = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u222b \u03b7i\na\n[1 + qA0(1/w)/E]\u221aB(1/w)C(1/w) A(1/w)\n\u00d7 w \u2032(1 \u2212 a)(\u03be \u2212 1)\nvw2b2c\n1\u221a 2 \u2212 a \u2212 \u03be 1\u221a \u03be \u2212 a d\u03be. (21b)\nIn the SFL, i.e., r0 \u2192 r+0c, b \u2192 b+c and a \u2192 0+, the integrands of Eq. (21) can be perturbatively expanded for small \u03be and therefore it allows us to find an effective approximation of \u03c6 and t . Among the four factors of each of the integrands, the last one is the simplest and can be kept since its product with a power series of \u03be can be directly integrated. The third factor has a simple Taylor expansion\n1\u221a 2 \u2212 a \u2212 \u03be =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(2n \u2212 1)!! (2n)!!\n\u03ben\n(2 \u2212 a)n+ 12 . (22)\nDenoting the product of the first two factors of Eq. (21a) as f (\u03be) and those of Eq. (21b) as g(\u03be),\nf (\u03be) = \u221a B(1/w)\nC(1/w) w\u2032(\u03be \u2212 1) w2bc , (23)\ng(\u03be) = [1 + qA0(1/w)/E] \u221a B(1/w)C(1/w)\nA(1/w)\n\u00d7 w \u2032(1 \u2212 a)(\u03be \u2212 1)\nvw2b2c , (24)\nwe then are able to show that f (\u03be) and g(\u03be) have the following form of expansions\nf (\u03be) = \u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121 fn\u03be\nn 2 , (25a)\ng(\u03be) = (1 \u2212 a) \u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121 gn\u03be\nn 2 . (25b)\nNote in these expansions, the series expansion of w(x) is needed, and it can always be obtained using the Lagrange Inversion Theorem from the series form of its inverse function p(x). In Eq. (25), the initial summation index is \u22121 and the powers are half integers because q \u2032(x) has a singularity at x = 0. We can indeed collectively denote the product of the first three factors in Eq. (21a) as y(\u03be, a) and that of Eq. (21b) as z(\u03be, a)\ny(\u03be, a) = \u221a B(1/w)\nC(1/w) w\u2032(\u03be \u2212 1) w2bc 1\u221a 2 \u2212 a \u2212 \u03be , (26a)\nz(\u03be, a) = [1 + qA0(1/w)/E] \u221a B(1/w)C(1/w)\nA(1/w)\n\u00d7 w \u2032(1 \u2212 a)(\u03be \u2212 1)\nvw2b2c\n1\u221a 2 \u2212 a \u2212 \u03be . (26b)\nThen their expansions are given by the product of expansions (22) and (25a), and (22) and (25b). After some reorganization, they become respectively\ny(\u03be) = \u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u23a1\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n[ n+1\n2\n]\n\u2211\nm=0\nam\n(2 \u2212 a) [ n+1 2 ] + 12 yn,m\n\u23a4\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 \u03be n/2, (27a)\nz(\u03be) = \u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n\u23a1\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n[ n+1\n2\n]\n\u2211\nm=0\n(1 \u2212 a)am\n(2 \u2212 a) [ n+1 2 ] + 12 zn,m\n\u23a4\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 \u03be n/2, (27b)\nwhere yn,m and zn,m denote coefficients of corresponding powers of \u03be and a. Note that these yn,m and zn,m can be completely determined once the metric functions are fixed.\nThe first few of them for general SSS spacetime with a critical r0c are given in Eqs. (38) and (39).\nSubstituting Eq. (27) into Eq. (21), \u03c6 and t are written as series of integrals of \u03be\n\u03c6 = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n[ n+1\n2\n]\n\u2211\nm=0\nam\n(2 \u2212 a) [ n+1 2 ] + 12 yn,m\n\u222b \u03b7i\na\n\u03ben/2\u221a \u03be \u2212 a d\u03be,\n(28a)\nt = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u22121\n[ n+1\n2\n]\n\u2211\nm=0\n(1 \u2212 a)am\n(2 \u2212 a) [ n+1 2 ] + 12 zn,m\n\u222b \u03b7i\na\n\u03ben/2\u221a \u03be \u2212 a d\u03be.\n(28b)\nWe emphasize that the integrals in the above series can always be carried out and the results are some elementary functions presented in Eqs. (A1) of Ref. [53]. Using these formulas, \u03c6 and t are finally found to be\n\u03c6 = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\nk\u2211\nm=0\nam (2 \u2212 a)k+ 12 { y2k\u22121,m \u00b7 a kCk2k 4k [ \u2212 lna\n+ 2ln (\u221a\u03b7i + \u221a\u03b7i \u2212 a )+ k\u2211\nj=1\n4 j\njC j2 j\n(\u03b7i a ) j \u221a 1 \u2212 a\n\u03b7i\n]\n+ y2k,m k\u2211\nj=0\n2Ckj a k\u2212 j (\u03b7i \u2212 a) j+1/2 2 j + 1 } , (29a)\nt = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\nk\u2211\nm=0\n(1 \u2212 a)am (2 \u2212 a)k+ 12\n{ z2k\u22121,m \u00b7 a\nkCk2k 4k\n[ \u2212 lna\n+ 2ln (\u221a\u03b7i + \u221a\u03b7i \u2212 a )+ k\u2211\nj=1\n4 j\njC j2 j\n(\u03b7i a ) j \u221a 1 \u2212 a\n\u03b7i\n]\n+ z2k,m k\u2211\nj=0\n2Ckj a k\u2212 j (\u03b7i \u2212 a) j+1/2 2 j + 1 } . (29b)\nA few remarks are in order here. First of all, for both \u03c6 and t , we observe that when rs and rd are not infinite, there is only one divergence proportional to ln a in the SFL a \u2192 0+, which is only contained by the k = m = 0 term. Secondly, we can further expand other functions involving a, i.e. ln( \u221a \u03b7i + \u221a\u03b7i \u2212 a) and \u221a1 \u2212 a/\u03b7i etc., in the limit a \u2192 0+, and the results should become quasi-power series of a with the coefficient of an containing one ln a. That is,\n\u03c6 = \u221e\u2211\nn=0 [\u2212Cn ln a + Dn] an, (30a)\nt = \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n[\u2212C \u2032n ln a + D\u2032n ] an, (30b)\nwhere Cn and Dn , and C \u2032n and D\u2032n are constants determined by the initial conditions of the trajectory and metric function\nparameters. Thirdly, from Eq. (29a), it is seen that to the O(a)0 order, the m = 0, j = k terms contribute dominantly to \u03c6 so that it becomes\n\u03c6 = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u23a7 \u23a8\n\u23a9\n\u221a 2y\u22121,0\n2\n[\u2212 ln a + 2 ln(2\u221a\u03b7i ) ]\n+ \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n2yn,0\u03b7 n+1 2 i\n2\n[ n+1\n2 ] + 12 (n + 1)\n\u23ab \u23ac \u23ad+ O(a) 1\n\u2261 \u2212C0 ln a + D0(\u03b7s, \u03b7d) + O(a)1, (31) where we have identified C0 = \u221a 2y\u22121,0, (32)\nD0 = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u23a1 \u23a3\u221a2y\u22121,0 ln(2\u221a\u03b7i ) + \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n2yn,0\u03b7 n+1 2 i\n2\n[ n+1\n2 ] + 12 (n + 1)\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 .\n(33)\nThe travel time (29b) can also be similarly expanded again for small a so that to the leading orders it becomes\nt = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u23a7 \u23a8\n\u23a9\n\u221a 2z\u22121,0\n2\n[\u2212 ln a + 2 ln(2\u221a\u03b7i ) ]\n+ \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n2zn,0\u03b7 n+1 2 i\n2\n[ n+1\n2 ] + 12 (n + 1)\n\u23ab \u23ac \u23ad+ O(a) 1\n\u2261 \u2212C \u20320 ln a + D\u20320(\u03b7s, \u03b7d) + O(a)1, (34) where we see that C \u20320 = \u221a 2z\u22121,0, (35)\nD\u20320 = \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u23a1 \u23a3\u221a2z\u22121,0 ln(2\u221a\u03b7i ) + \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n2zn,0\u03b7 n+1 2 i\n2\n[ n+1\n2 ] + 12 (n + 1)\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 .\n(36)\nAt this point, it is appropriate to point out the difference between the perturbative method and result in this work and the case without electric interaction [53,54]. Superficially, the steps from Eq. (15) to the result (36) are very similar to the case without electric interaction. However, indeed there exists a fundamental difference in the definition of p(x) in Eq. (13), where the electric potential explicitly contributes in the current case but not so in Refs. [53,54]. Consequently, its inverse function w(x) is also changed by A0(r) and this further changed all formulas involving the expansions of terms containing w(\u03be/bc). More specifically, the coefficients fn and gn in Eq. (25) and consequently yn,m and zn,m in Eqs. (27)\u2013(29), as well as the Cn, Dn, C \u2032n, D\u2032n in Eqs. (30)\u2013 (36), all contain contribution from the electric potential. We now show their dependence onA0(r), as well as other metric functions, more explicitly.\nAssuming the metric functions and the electric potential have the following series expansions near r0c\nA(r \u2192 r0c) = \u221e\u2211\nn=0 an(r \u2212 r0c)n, (37a)\nB(r \u2192 r0c) = \u221e\u2211\nn=0 bn(r \u2212 r0c)n, (37b)\nC(r \u2192 r0c) = \u221e\u2211\nn=0 cn(r \u2212 r0c)n, (37c)\nA0(r \u2192 r0c) = \u221e\u2211\nn=0 a0n(r \u2212 r0c)n, (37d)\nwhere an, bn, cn and a0n (n = 0, 1, . . .) are the coefficients, and substituting them into Eq. (14), we can solve the series p(x). Inverting it to find w(x) and then further substituting into Eq. (26), we can compute yn,m and zn,m to any desired order. The first two of yn,m , i.e. y\u22121,0 in Eq. (32) which fixes the divergence of \u03c6 and y0,0 in Eq. (33) which dominates the constant term of \u03c6, are\ny\u22121,0 = bc \u221a\nb0 2c0T2 , (38a)\ny0,0 = b 2 c (b1c0T2 \u2212 b0c1T2 \u2212 2b0c0T3)\n2 \u221a b0c 3/2 0 T 2 2\n, (38b)\nwhere bc is given in Eq. (13) and T2 and T3 are related to the first few coefficients in Eq. (37) by Eq. (A1). Similarly, the first few zn,m are found to be\nz\u22121,0 = (a00q + E)\u221a 2Ea0v \u221a b0c0 T2 , (39a)\nz0,0 = bc {[(qa00 + E)(a0b1c0 + a0b0c1 \u2212 2a1b0c0) +2qa0a01b0c0] T2 \u2212 2(qa00 + E)a0b0c0T3} /(2Eva20 \u221a b0c0T 2 2 ) (39b)\nThe higher order terms of yn,m and zn,m can also be computed but are too long to present here. It is seen from these equations that a0n explicitly appear in all of the yn,m and zn,m and therefore will affect how the deflection angle \u03c6 and total travel time t diverge. In Sect. 4, we will study the dependence of \u03c6 on the electric interaction using RN spacetime as an example. It is also interesting to note from Eqs. (A1a) and (A1b) by factoring out an E2 from the curly brackets that both T2, T3, and indeed all orders of yn,m and zn,m and consequently the entire \u03c6 and t , depend on (q, m, E) only through the ratios q/E and v = \u221aE2 \u2212 m2/E . That is, there is one degree of degeneracy among these three param-\neters. This fact was also observed in the weak deflection case in Refs. [30,34]."

            "text": "In this section, we apply our result to the RN spacetime, which is the simplest SSS spacetime that allows both electric and gravitational interactions. The metric functions and the electric potential in the RN spacetime are given by\nA(r) = 1 B(r) = 1 \u2212 2M r + Q 2 r2 , C(r) = r2, A0(r) = \u2212Q r . (40)\nWe will examine the validity of the results in Sects. 2 and 3, particularly concentrating on how the electric interaction will affect the PS radius r0c defined in Eq. (11), bc defined in (13) and the deflection \u03c6 in Eq. (31).\n4.1 The critical r0c and bc\nSubstituting Eq. (40) into Eq. (11) and simplifying the result, it is not difficult to find that r0c satisfies the following quartic equation\n( E2 \u2212 m2 ) r40c + [ (4m2 \u2212 3E2)M \u2212 EqQ ] r30c\n+ [ \u22124m2M2 + 4EqMQ + 2(E2 \u2212 m2)Q2 ] r20c + [ (4m2 \u2212 q2)M \u2212 3EqQ ] Q2r0c + (q2 \u2212 m2)Q4 = 0.\n(41)\nDenoting the coefficients of rn0c by gn for n = 0, . . . , 4, this equation can be solved to yield an explicit formula of the only physical root of r0c (see Eq. (A3) of Refs. [65,66])\nr0c = \u2212 g3 4g4 + S + 1 2\n\u221a \u22122P1 \u2212 P2\nS \u2212 4S2, (42)\nwhere\nP1 = 8g4g2 \u2212 3g 2 3\n8g24 ,\nP2 = 8g 2 4g1 \u2212 4g4g3g2 + g33\n8g34 ,\nS = 1 2\n\u221a\n\u22122P1 3\n+ 2 \u221a 0 cos ( \u03d5 3 )\n3g4 ,\n\u03d5 = cos\u22121 \u239b\n\u239d 1 2 \u221a\n30\n\u239e\n\u23a0 ,\n0 = 12g4g0 \u2212 3g3g1 + g22, 1 = \u221272g4g2g0 + 27g4g21 + 27g23g0 \u2212 9g3g2g1 + 2g32 .\nAlthough Eq. (42) is not very transparent to see the effects of various parameters such as M, Q, E, m and q on the above r0c, it is however not difficult to demonstrate by dividing Eq. (41) by m2M4 that r0c/M depends on them only through the ratios q/m \u2261 q\u0302, Q/M \u2261 Q\u0302 and E/m = 1/\u221a1 \u2212 v2. In other words, r0c = r0c(q\u0302, Q\u0302, v). (43) Moreover, there are a few limits of Eq. (42) that one can check. The first is its neutral particle limit, which can be obtained by letting q\u0302 \u2192 0 and then the result agrees with Eq. (18) of Ref. [65]. The second is its Schwarzschild limit reached by letting Q\u0302 \u2192 0\nr0c(q\u0302, Q\u0302 = 0, v) = M (\n2 + 4\u221a 8v2 + 1 + 1\n) . (44)\nThis agrees with Eq. (18) of Ref. [67]. The third limit is the ultra-relativistic limit of the charged signal, which is simply the limit E \u2192 \u221e while holding m finite or equivalently v \u2192 1. The result is\nr0c(q\u0302, Q\u0302, v = 1) = 3M 2\n( 1 + \u221a 1 \u2212 8Q\u03022/9 ) . (45)\nFinally, one can also attempt the v \u2192 0 limit of r0c, in which case the Eq. (41) becomes cubic and a root simpler than Eq. (42) can be obtained (see Eq. (26) of Ref. [65] for the neutral case).\nIn both the limits (44) and (45), the dependence of r0c on the charge-mass ratio q\u0302 of the charged signal disappears. The disappearance in the former is quite easy to understand, since in a neutral spacetime like the Schwarzschild one, the signal although charged will not experience any electric interaction. While for the second disappearance, one can show by dividing Eq. (41) by E2M4 that r0c will depend on q\u0302 only through q\u0302/(E/m) = q\u0302\u221a1 \u2212 v2. That is, Eq. (43) can be further transformed into r0c = r0c(q\u0302 \u221a\n1 \u2212 v2, Q\u0302, v). (46) Therefore as v \u2192 1, q\u0302 effectively drops out from r0c.\nThe r0c solved from Eq. (41) is plotted in Fig. 3a as a function of q/m and v for a typical Q/M . It is seen that for any fixed v \u2264 1 and 0 < Q/M \u2264 1, as q increases to some positive maximal value qmax, r0c decreases monotonically if v is large or otherwise it could increase again when q increases towards qmax. Only for q \u2264 qmax, a critical r0c is allowed. This implies that for any given Q (|Q| \u2264 M), as the repulsion between q and Q increases, the critical r0c may cease to exist. For cases with q > qmax, signals incoming\nalong any direction will not be captured. This qmax is actually determined by the requirement that even when L = 0 = b, there still exists a closest approach of radius and its value should be equal to r0c. Solving r0 from L = 0 using Eq. (5), the positiveness of r0 yields the qmax for the RN spacetime to be\nqmax = m\u221a 1 \u2212 v2\n\u239b\n\u239dM Q\n+ v \u221a M2 Q2 \u2212 1 \u239e \u23a0 , (47)\nand at this boundary, the value or r0c is simply r0c(q = qmax, v) = M + \u221a M2 \u2212 Q2\nv . (48)\nNote that since v < 1 this value is always larger than the RN BH exterior horizon radius rH = M + \u221a M2 \u2212 Q2. The boundary (47) and its corresponding value of r0c is also plotted in Fig. 3a using the red curve. We also note that in the limit v \u2192 0, qmax approaches mM/Q and r0c(q, v \u2192 0) approaches an infinite value, except in the extremal RN case r0c(q = qmax, Q = M, v) = M .\nFor any r0c, there exists a corresponding critical value of the impact parameter, bc. For RN spacetime, using Eq. (13), bc is found to be\nbc = r0c v\n( 1 \u2212 v2 r20c \u2212 2Mr0c + Q2 )1/2\n\u00d7 [( q\nm Q \u2212 r0c\u221a 1 \u2212 v2 )2 \u2212 ( r20c \u2212 2Mr0c + Q2 )] 12 .\n(49)\nThis bc is also important because it can be directly linked to the angular size \u03b8sh of the BH shadow observed by the remote observer at radius rd , through relation \u03b8sh \u2248 bc/rd (see Eq. (57)) when E and rd are large. Using Eq. (49), the bc corresponding to Fig. 3a is plotted in Fig. 3b. It is seen that unlike r0c, bc for any fixed Q and v decreases monotonically as q increases, and reaches 0 at qmax. While for its dependence on v, then as v decreases to zero, bc increases monotonically to infinity.\nIt is more interesting to study the effect of Q on bc than that of q/m, because q/m only affects the electric deflection while Q affects both the electric and the gravitational deflections. Previous works have implied that in the weak field limit increasing |Q| would decrease bc gravitationally for neutral signals (see Eq. (122) of Ref. [65]), and the desired b to reach the same observer will be increased if the signal is charged and qQ < 0 (see by Eq. (3.3) of Ref. [30]). These mean that when q is fixed and qQ < 0, a nonzero Q will cause a competition between its gravitational and electric effects on bc, which is worthy to investigate.\nIn Fig. 4 we plotted the bc as a function of Q/M and q/m. It is seen that for fixed q/m, bc monotonically decreases as Q increases, as long as it is positive so that qQ > 0. For q/m 2.3, when Q increases to a certain point Qmax, the bc decreases to zero. The critical points where bc approaches zero is also where r0c ceases to exist and therefore we can work out this Qmax directly from Eq. (47). Replacing qmax by q in this equation, we find\nQmax = Mm q\n\u221a 1 \u2212 v2\n1 \u2212\u221a1 \u2212 m2/q2v , (50)\nwhich is shown as the red curve in Fig. 4. Using relation (59), bc approaching zero corresponds to the point that the\nBH shadow angular size shrinks to zero. This will be verified in Fig. 6. While for small q/m (0 < q/m < 2.3), bc only decreases to a finite value when Q reaches its extreme value of Qext = M .\nOn the other hand, for Q < 0 so that qQ < 0, we also see from Fig. 4 that bc also increases as Q decreases by a small amount from zero (more apparent for large q). This suggests that for the chosen ranges of parameters q and v, the electric effect on bc is stronger than that of the gravitational one for small negative Q, because we know that Q\u2019s gravitational effect alone would decrease bc [30]. With Q further decreases to more negative value, we see that for small q/m, bc decreases again, implying the gravitational effect exceeds the electric effect again. While for larger q/m, bc keeps increasing for the entire range of Q from 0 to \u2212Qext. This will also be confirmed in Fig. 6 by ultra-high energy protons. The above features for small and large negative Q are intuitively understandable after a quantitative comparison of the two effects on \u03c6 in the weak field limit. The gravitational and electric contributions of Q to \u03c6 in this limit are respectively about the size\n\u2212 cQ2/b2 and \u2212 c\u2032qQ/b, (51) where c and c\u2032 are some positive constants (see Eq. (4.4) of Ref. [30]). Consequently for a small but fixed q, when Q is very small (or large) the gravitational effect on the deflection is always weaker (or stronger) than the electric one. Also from these contributions in Eq. (51), we see that if q is very large, such as in the case of q/m 2.3 in Fig. 4, the charge Q might not be able to reach the desired value for the gravitational effect to overcome the electric one, before it reaches its extreme value \u2212M .\nFinally, it is also instructive to comment on the case when q exceeds the qmax in Eq. (47) for a fixed Q or Q exceeds the Qmax in Eq. (50) for a fixed q. The vanishing of r0c or bc reaching zero does not mean that the signal will be able to travel to the very central region of the BH. Indeed in these cases the closet approach r0 of the trajectory solvable from Eq. (5) still exists and can be shown to be well beyond the RN BH outer horizon. However, the critical behavior of the effective potential (9) detaching the right hand side of Eq. (10) will not happen. A key noticeable feature following this is that the charged signal will always only experience a finite amount of angular deflection regardless how small b is.\n4.2 Deflection angle \u03c6\nAfter obtaining r0c, we can continue to expand the RN metric and electric potential functions in Eq. (40) and obtain\nA(r) = (\n\u22122M r0c + Q 2 r20c + 1 ) \u2212 2 ( Q2 \u2212 Mr0c ) r30c (r \u2212 r0c)\n+ ( 3Q2 \u2212 2Mr0c )\nr40c (r \u2212 r0c)2\n+ ( 2M\nr40c \u2212 4Q\n2\nr50c\n) (r \u2212 r0c)3 + O (r \u2212 r0c)4 , (52a)\nB(r) = 1 \u2212 2Mr0c + Q 2 r20c + 1\n+ 2r0c ( Q2 \u2212 Mr0c )\n(\u22122Mr0c + Q2 + r20c )2 (r \u2212 r0c)\n+ ( 2Mr30c \u2212 3Q2r20c + Q4 )\n(\u22122Mr0c + Q2 + r20c )3 (r \u2212 r0c)2\n\u2212 2 (\u2212MQ4 + Mr40c \u2212 2Q2r30c + 2Q4r0c )\n(\u22122Mr0c + Q2 + r20c )4 (r \u2212 r0c)3\n+ O (r \u2212 r0c)4 , (52b) C(r) = r20c + 2r0c(r \u2212 r0c) + (r \u2212 r0c)2, (52c) A0(r) = \u2212 Q\nr0c + Q r20c (r \u2212 r0c) \u2212 Q r30c (r \u2212 r0c)2\n+ Q r40c (r \u2212 r0c)3 + O (r \u2212 r0c)4 . (52d)\nReading off the coefficientsan ,bn , cn anda0n in Eq. (37) from the above, and substituting them into Eqs. (38)\u2013(A1b), the y\u22121,0, y0,0 and higher order yn,m\u2019s can be obtained. Further substituting into Eq. (31), the perturbative \u03c6 in the RN spacetime in the SFL for charged signal is found immediately\n\u03c6R \u2248 \u2212 \u221a 2y\u22121,0,R ln (\n1 \u2212 bc b\n)\n+ \u221a2y\u22121,0,R ln ( 4 \u221a \u03b7s\u03b7d )\n+ \u2211\ni=s,d\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n2yn,0,R\u03b7 n+1 2 i\n2\n[ n+1\n2 ] + 12 (n + 1)\n+ O(a1), (53)\nwhere the coefficients yn,0,R are given in Eq. (A2). To check the validity of this \u03c6, we can define a truncated\n\u03c6m (m = 0, 2, . . .) by including only terms to order m in the summation of n in Eq. (53) and compare its value with a \u03c6num obtained by numerically integrating Eq. (7a). In Fig. 5a we chose some exemplary parameters M = 1, Q = M/2, q/m = 1, v = 9/10 and plot the \u03c6m and \u03c6num as functions of a = 1\u2212bc/b. We see that as the truncation order increases, the perturbative result converges to the numerical value in general, and more rapidly so for smaller a. This is in accord with the fact that as a \u2192 0, \u03c6 diverges as \u223c ln a and the a-independent terms composing D0 in Eq. (33) become less important to \u03c6.\nTo study the effect of the charges Q and q and the electric interaction on the deflection in the SFL, in Fig. 5b we plot \u03c6 using Eq. (53) for a fixed impact parameter. We chose a small parameter range of Q \u2208 (0.5 \u00b1 0.0005)M and q \u2208 (1 \u00b1 0.002)m in order to make sure that for the fixed b, the parameter a = 1 \u2212 bc/b is still smaller than 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124\nso that the approximation (53) is always valid. It is seen that as Q or q increases, \u03c6 decreases monotonically in this range, suggesting that a stronger repulsion results in a smaller deflection. This actually is understandable from Fig. 4 that larger Q and q when qQ > 0 result in a smaller bc and therefore the trajectory with fixed b experiences weaker field and smaller deflection."

            "text": "To reveal the effect of the electric interaction on the GL in the SFL, we will have to solve the GL equation for this case. Formally, this equation and its solution process are the same as in the case of neutral particle which was studied in Ref. [53], except now all parameters or coefficients have to be updated to include the electric interaction. Therefore in this work, we will do a parallel analysis of the GL but concentrate on the electric effect.\nWhen one has a \u03c6 that takes the finite distance effect of the source and detector into account, establishing the GL is particularly simple. For a source located at (rs, \u03c6s) and detector at (rd , \u03c6d) (0 \u2264 \u03c6d < \u03c6s < 2\u03c0) (see Fig. 1), the change of the angular coordinate \u03c6 satisfies\n\u03c6(rs, rd , b) \u2212 2|n|\u03c0 = \u03c0(1 + sign(n)) \u2212sign(n)(\u03c6s \u2212 \u03c6d), (54)\nwhere integer |n| = 1, 2, . . . is the looping number of the trajectory around the center andn > 0 andn < 0 corresponds\nto the anti-clockwise and the clockwise looping directions respectively. Substituting Eq. (31) for \u03c6 into Eq. (54), it becomes\n\u2212 C0 ln (\n1 \u2212 bc b\n) + D0 \u2212 2|n|\u03c0 = \u03c0(1 + sign(n))\n\u2212sign(n) \u03c6sd , (55) where we have denoted \u03c6sd \u2261 \u03c6s \u2212 \u03c6d . From this, we can easily solve b that allows the signal to reach the detector in terms of other quantities\nbn = bc 1 \u2212 exp\n{\u2212[2|n|+1+sign(n)]\u03c0+D0+sign(n) \u03c6sd C0 } ,\n|n| = 1, 2, . . . . (56)\nFormally this is the same as Eq. (38) of Ref. [53], however the parameters bc, C0 and D0 are now given by the updated values in Eqs. (13), (32) and (33).\n5.1 The relativistic image and BH shadow locations\nCorresponding to this series of bn are two series of images in the SFL, one series on each side of the lens, and their apparent angles are given by the following formula [30]\n\u03b8n = arcsin \u23a1 \u23a3bn \u00b7 \u221a E2 \u2212 m2\u221a\n(E + qA0(rd))2 \u2212 m2A(rd)\n\u221a A(rd) C(rd)\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 ,\n|n| = 1, 2, . . . . (57)\nSubstituting Eqs. (56) and (13), this becomes\n\u03b8n = arcsin \u23a1 \u23a3 1\n1 \u2212 exp {\u2212[2|n|+1+sign(n)]\u03c0+D0+sign(n) \u03c6sd\nC0\n}\n\u00d7 \u221a\n(E + qA0(r0c))2 \u2212 m2A(r0c) (E + qA0(rd))2 \u2212 m2A(rd)\n\u221a A(rd)C(r0c)\nA(r0c)C(rd)\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 .\n(58)\nClearly if all other parameters are fixed but |n| increases, \u03b8n will decrease monotonically. At |n| \u2192 \u221e, this yields the angular size \u03b8sh of the BH shadow formed by charged signals. That is,\n\u03b8sh = \u03b8\u00b1\u221e\n= arcsin \u23a1 \u23a3 \u221a\n(E + qA0(r0c))2 \u2212 m2A(r0c) (E + qA0(rd))2 \u2212 m2A(rd )\n\u221a A(rd)C(r0c)\nA(r0c)C(rd)\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 .\n(59)\nClearly, the effect of first term inside the arcsin function in Eq. (58), including parameters sign(n) and sd , becomes irrelevant to the shadow size.\nTo see the effect of the electric interaction on \u03b8n and \u03b8sh, in Fig. 6 we plot them for the SgrA* SMBH by assuming it is a RN BH and the shadow is formed by cosmic protons. We take the proton energy to be 2 \u00d7 109 [eV] and the SgrA* SMBH mass M = 4.30 \u00d7106M and source/detector distance rs = rd = 8.28 [kpc] to be the distance to us [68]. For the BH charge, we use the tightest constrained value for Sgr A*\nQsb \u2248 3.0 \u00d7 108 [C] (60)\nobtained from the surface brightness profile of the thermal bremsstrahlung inside the innermost 1000 Schwarzschild radii [69] as the rough unit. Here we remind the readers that this upper limit is model dependent and there exists\nother estimations even in the same work [69] as well as when other method are used [70]. We plot the first relativistic image \u03b81 and then the BH shadow \u03b8sh for several Q. We chose \u03c6sd = \u03c0 so that the source, lens and detector are aligned. From Fig. 6a it is clear that for our fixed q, as Q increases positively from zero (the red solid curve), the shadow size decreases monotonically, until Q reaches Qmax at which point bc and consequently \u03b8sh becomes zero. This corresponds to the large q case in Fig. 4, for which a maximal Q exists. For the chosen parameter values (v, q/m, M etc.) in this figure, we can actually work out the critical Qmax = 8.9Qsb from Eq. (50). Also, in this case, one can see from the green dash-dotted curve that for negative Q, the shadow size will increase, which again is in accord with Fig. 4. Because of the same electrical repulsion effect, we see from Fig. 6b that if charge Q of the BH is fixed to a positive value, decreasing q/m to its value of typical heavier nuclei, i.e., half its value for proton, will increase the shadow size. From both zoom-in\u2019s in Fig. 6 we see that all the relativistic images are very packed, and close to the BH shadow location. This is a general feature of all such lensed images in the SFL.\n5.2 Magnification\nThe magnification of the images are defined as \u03bcn = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b8n\n\u03b2 d\u03b8n d\u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (61)\nwhere \u03b2 is the angle of source against the lens-detector axis. To carry out the differentiation in above, we have to link \u03b2 to quantities in Eq. (58). This can be achieved by considering the following geometrical relation\n[rd \u2212 rs cos \u03c6sd ] tan \u03b2 = rs sin \u03c6sd . (62) Substituting Eqs. (58) and (62) into Eq. (61), we have\n\u03bcn = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b8n\n\u03b2 d\u03b8n d\u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b8n \u03b2 d\u03b8n d \u03c6sd d \u03c6sd d\u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2248 1 C0 b2c rsr3d\n[ r2d + r2s \u2212 2rdrs cos \u03c6sd ] \u2223\u2223\u2223(cos \u03c6sd \u2212 rsrd ) arctan sin \u03c6sd cos \u03c6sd\u2212rd/rs \u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u00d7 exp \u2212(2|n| + 1 + sign(n))\u03c0 + D0 + sign(n) \u03c6sd C0 .\n(63)\nFormally, this agrees with Eq. (44) of Ref. [53] (after a typo corrected there), but again the coefficients C0, D0 and bc are the ones containing the electric interaction.\nTo see the electric effect on \u03bcn more clearly, in Fig. 7 we have plotted the magnification as a function of Q and q. It is seen that comparing to neutral particles, the magnification receives a correction that is also determined by sign(qQ).\nWhen sign(qQ) is positive (or negative), the magnification is decreased (or increased). Therefore qualitatively the effect of the electric interaction to the magnification here in the SFL is the same as that in the weak field limit [30].\n5.3 Time delay\nWith the impact parameter bn of the n-th images known in Eq. (56), we can find the total travel time for the n-th trajectory using Eq. (34)\ntn = \u2212C \u20320 ln (\n1 \u2212 bc bn\n) + D\u20320 + O(a1). (64)\nUsing this, we can obtain the more observationally interesting quantity, the time delay 2tn,m between the n-th and m-th images\n2tn,m \u2261 tn \u2212 tm\n= 2\u03c0C \u2032 0\nC0\n[ (|n| \u2212 |m|) + [ sign(n) \u2212 sign(m)] (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6sd)\n2\u03c0\n] ,\n(65)\nwhere Eq. (56) for bn was substituted. We now show that similar to the case of neutral particles [54], Eq. (65) also has a simple interpretation as the amount of local time to move around one full circle of the PS times the redshift factor from the PS to the observer, and then times the difference of the looping numbers of the two trajectories. For the first factor of Eq. (65), using Eqs. (33), (35), (38a) and (39a), it becomes 2\u03c0C \u20320 C0 = 2\u03c0 \u221a c0\u221a\n1 \u2212 (\nm E+a00q\n)2 a0\n1\u221a a0 . (66)\nNow for a SSS spacetime, it is always possible to scale the metric function C(r) = r2 and therefore its expansion at r0c yields c0 = r20c. Consequently the numerator 2\u03c0 \u221a c0 of\nEq. (66) is actually the circumference of the PS. For the first denominator of this equation, we can show that it is nothing but the local speed vl of the particle\u2019s motion around the PS. Since in the SFL the signal circulates the PS, vl is given by\nvl = r0c\u03c6\u0307 \u03b3sr , (67) where \u03b3sr = 1/ \u221a\n1 \u2212 v2l is the gamma factor due to special relativity. Substituting Eqs. (3b), (4a), (13), (37) and c0 = r20c into Eq. (67) and after some simple algebra, one can solve vl as vl = \u221a 1 \u2212 ( m\nE + a00q )2 a0, (68)\nwhich is exactly the first denominator of Eq. (66). Finally, the factor 1/ \u221a a0 = 1/\u221aA(r0c) in Eq. (66) is the redshift factor from the PS to an asymptotic observer in an SSS spacetime described by the metric (2). Combining these three parts, therefore the first factor of Eq. (65) is the time observed by the asymptotic observer for the signal to loop one circle of the PS. The second factor of Eq. (65) is the difference between looping number of the n-th and m-th trajectories. Putting these factors together, we obtain the claimed interpretation of the formula (65). That is,\n2tn,m = 2\u03c0r0c\u221a 1 \u2212 ( m\nE+a00q )2 a0\n1\u221a a0\n\u00d7 [ (|n| \u2212 |m|) + [ sign(n) \u2212 sign(m)] (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6sd)\n2\u03c0\n] .\n(69)\nIn the above time delay, usually E, m and q of the signal are measurable. And if we assume that the spacetime is RN type, then it is seen from Eqs. (41), (52a) and (52d) that r0c, a0 and a00 will be fixed once M and Q are known. Since mass M of a lens can often be known using other astronomical means, from Eq. (69) we immediately see that the charge Q can be constrained by the measurement of 2tn,m . In Fig. 8, we plot the PS radius r0c, the redshift factor 1/ \u221a a0 and the time delay 2tm+1,m as functions of Q by again assuming the Sgr A* SMBH is a RN one. Note that 2tm+1,m actually does not depend on the value of \u03c6sd or m as long as m \u2265 1 or m \u2264 \u22122. It is seen from the lower subplot of Fig. 8a that for charged signal with q > 0, the time delay increases when Q increases from zero. This is actually a combined effect of a decreasing PS radius and increasing redshift factor (see the upper subplot of Fig. 8a). While for neutral signals, although all quantities seem flat in Fig. 8a, they are not truly invariant. They appear quite flat because in this case there is no electric interaction and therefore Q only affect them\ngravitationally and then it takes a much larger Q to make a comparable difference. As one can see from Fig. 8b, only when Q reaches about 0.1M \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 1017Qsb , the time delay variation can reach the same order as the charged case in Fig. 8a. This comparison suggests that although the time delay of the neutral signal can also be used to constrain the lens charge as suggested in Ref. [54], that of the charged signal is more sensitive when Q is small, which is generally expected by many astronomers."

            "heading": "6 Conclusions and discussions",
            "text": "In this work we studied the deflection, GL and time delay of charged signal in a charged spacetime in the SFL using a perturbative method. The effect of the extra electric interaction was carefully analyzed. It is found that the deflection \u03c6 still has a weak logarithmic divergence\n\u03c6 = \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n[ \u2212Cn ln ( 1 \u2212 bc\nb\n) + Dn ]( 1 \u2212 bc\nb\n)n (70)\nas the trajectory approaches the PS. Perturbatively, a small electric repulsion (or attraction) will decrease (or increase) the critical impact parameter and therefore decreases (or increases) the deflection. For any fixed Q, in general there is a maximal qmax given in Eq. (47) (qQ > 0) beyond which the PS ceases to exist and bc shrinks to zero. While for fixed q, the electric effect of Q on bc will be weaker (or stronger) than its gravitational one when Q is small (or large).\nFor the GL in the SFL, similar to the neutral signal case, there exists one series of very packed and weakly magnified images on each side of the lens. Their angular positions and magnifications are given by Eqs. (58) and (63). The BH shadow with electric interaction is still given by a simple formula Eq. (59). The electric repulsion (or attraction) tends to decrease (or increase) the angular sizes of these images and that of the BH shadow. For a fixed q/m of the charged signal, the BH shadow size shrinks to zero when Q is beyond Qmax (qQ > 0).\nThe time delay between two images given by Eq. (69) has an intuitive and yet quantitatively precise explanation, as the PS circumference dividing the local velocity and then multiplying the redshift factor from the PS to the observer and the difference of the loop numbers of the two trajectories. It is shown that comparing to neutral signals, the time delay of charged signal is much more sensitive to the spacetime charge Q when it is small.\nA few comments are in order regarding these results. The first is about the potential application of these results. We see from the dependence of the ring size on the charge Q in Fig. 6 that if we can detect any charge cosmic ray from the central region of Sgr A*, then its angular size might be used to constrain the total charges of the BH. However, we also realize that since the angular size is expected to be generally small ( 50 \u00b5as), one has to have an excellent angular resolution for these signals. This value is certainly beyond the current or near future cosmic detectors [71].\nThe second is about the comparison of our method and results with numerical techniques. In principle, the deflection angles and travel times are definite integrals and therefore one might attempt to find them numerically. However the very fact that the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit is divergent and that the total travel time across astrophysical distance is also very large, makes the numerical computation to have large error. These inaccuracies become severely bad\nwhen solving the lensing equation for the apparent angles of the images and the time delay, because the former involves the modulation of many 2\u03c0 \u2019s from a large angle, while the latter is the small difference between two large total times. Moreover, a pure numerical result of a quantity will never be as revealing as an analytical formula, nor will it be as inspiring when building our comprehensive understanding of the physical process. For example, if one only finds a numerical time delay t between two images, it will be difficult for this numerical number to inspire us to find a neat physical explanation of it as between Eqs. (65) and (69).\nFor the third point, we emphasize that most of the results in this work, except Sect. 4, are generally applicable to SSS and charged spacetimes with one PS. Therefore besides the RN one, it is equally simple to apply them to other kinds of such spacetimes, such as the Gibbons\u2013Maeda\u2013Garfinkle\u2013 Horowitz\u2013Strominger (GMGHS) [61\u201363] and charged Horndeski [64] spacetimes. We also expect that it is straightforward to extend the perturbative method in this work to the deflection and GL in the equatorial plane of stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, with or without the electric interactions. Moreover, for the axisymmetric case, we might also take into account the effect of an axisymmetric magnetic field to the deflection and lensing.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Haotian Liu for helping creating illustration Fig. 1.
