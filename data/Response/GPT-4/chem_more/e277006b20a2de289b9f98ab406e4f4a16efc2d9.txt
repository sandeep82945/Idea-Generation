Exploration of Different Metal Oxides Combinations: Given the unique properties exhibited by FCBOs in arsenic sorption, it would be insightful to explore the synthesis and characterization of other binary or even ternary metal oxide systems. Investigating different metal combinations, such as Fe-Mn or Cu-Zn binary oxides, could reveal new insights into structure-performance relationships and potentially uncover materials with superior sorption capacities or selectivities for various contaminants.

Impact of Nanostructure Morphology on Sorption Capacity: The paper highlights the influence of crystallinity and surface hydroxyl density on arsenic sorption. A systematic study varying nanostructure morphology, such as nanorods, nanosheets, or hierarchical structures, could provide deeper understanding on how surface area, pore size distribution, and morphology impact sorption performance. This could lead to the design of optimized nanostructures for targeted contaminant removal.

Mechanism Study of Arsenic Sorption at Different Environmental Conditions: The research could be extended to study the sorption mechanism of arsenic under varying environmental conditions, such as different temperatures, competing ions presence, and variable water chemistries. This would help in understanding the stability and efficiency of FCBOs in real-world applications and tailoring the synthesis process to enhance performance under specific conditions.

Scale-Up and Application in Water Treatment Systems: Building on the laboratory-scale experiments, research could focus on scaling up the synthesis process of FCBOs and integrating these materials into pilot-scale water treatment systems. Evaluating the performance, regeneration capabilities, and economic feasibility of using FCBOs in real water treatment scenarios would be critical for transitioning from laboratory research to practical applications.

Advanced Characterization and Modeling Studies: Further advanced characterization studies, such as in-situ spectroscopy or advanced microscopy techniques, could provide deeper insights into the interaction mechanisms between arsenic species and FCBOs. Coupled with computational modeling and simulations, these studies could elucidate the fundamental principles governing sorption dynamics and help in predicting the performance of FCBOs under various scenarios, guiding the design of more efficient sorbents.
