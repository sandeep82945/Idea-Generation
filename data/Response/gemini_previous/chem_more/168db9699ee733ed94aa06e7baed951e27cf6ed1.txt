1. **Investigate the role of PI(3,4)P2 in the maintenance of apical-basolateral polarity.** While the study mentioned in the paper suggests that PI(3,4)P2 is important for the formation of the apical membrane, it is unclear whether it plays a role in maintaining polarity once it has been established. Future research could investigate this question by examining the effects of PI(3,4)P2 depletion on the localization of polarity proteins and the maintenance of apical-basolateral asymmetry.
2. **Determine the mechanisms by which PI4KIIIα/TTC7A/B complex regulates the localization of PS.** The paper mentions that PI4KIIIα/TTC7A/B complex is important for the apical enrichment of PS, but the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Future research could investigate this question by examining the effects of PI4KIIIα/TTC7A/B depletion on the localization of PS and the activity of PS transporters.
3. **Examine the role of GSLs in the formation and function of the apical membrane.** While the paper briefly mentions the importance of GSLs in the formation of the apical membrane, it does not provide a detailed investigation of their role. Future research could investigate this question by examining the effects of GSL depletion on the formation and function of the apical membrane, including the localization of apical proteins and the transport of molecules across the membrane.
4. **Investigate the interplay between PIs, GSLs, and PS in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity.** The paper suggests that PIs, GSLs, and PS all play a role in the regulation of epithelial cell polarity, but it does not examine the interplay between these lipids. Future research could investigate this question by examining the effects of manipulating the levels of one lipid on the localization and function of the others.
5. **Determine the role of membrane lipids in the formation of lumens in vivo.** While the paper focuses on the role of membrane lipids in the formation of lumens in vitro, it does not examine their role in vivo. Future research could investigate this question by examining the effects of manipulating the levels of membrane lipids on the formation of lumens in vivo, using animal models or organoids.
