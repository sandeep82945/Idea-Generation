 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Synthesize and test additional metallodendrimer compounds with different metal cores (e.g. ruthenium, osmium) and bridging ligands to explore how structural modifications impact anticancer activity.

2. Conduct mechanistic studies on the most potent compounds like complex 5 to determine how they inhibit cancer cell growth, such as their interactions with DNA or proteins. 

3. Test the cytotoxicity of the most active complexes on a wider panel of cancer cell lines, including drug resistant lines, to further evaluate their potential as broad-spectrum anticancer agents.

4. Evaluate the selectivity of the best compounds by testing their toxicity against normal non-cancerous cell lines. Develop strategies to improve cancer cell selectivity.

5. Perform in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies of the lead compounds in animal models of ovarian cancer to assess their potential for further preclinical development.
