    "abstractText": "The selective adsorption of C2H6 and C2H2 over C2H4 from C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 ternary mixtures for one-step C2H4 purification represents a crucial yet challenging task in industry. The pore structure of the adsorbents must be finely tailored to meet the demanding requirements for the separation considering the very similar physicochemical properties of the three gases. Herein, we report a Zn\u2013triazolate\u2013dicarboxylate framework, HIAM-210, featuring a novel topology which possesses one-dimensional channels decorated with adjacent uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013O atoms. The suitable pore size and customized pore environment enable the compound to selectively capture C2H6 and C2H2 with high C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities of both 2.0. Breakthrough experiments show that polymer-grade C2H4 can be directly harvested from C2H2/C2H4/ C2H6 (34/33/33 and 1/90/9) ternary mixtures. The underlying mechanism of the preferential adsorption was uncovered by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations.",

In this context, metal\u2013 organic frameworks (MOFs), for which the pore size and chemical environment can be precisely adjusted, are considered promising candidates to address this challenging process.10,11 In general, a non-polar surface favors C2H6 while smaller pore size prefers C2H2. However, since C2H2 has the lowest polarizability among the three hydrocarbons, a non-polar pore surface is also unfavorable for C2H2 adsorption, and most previously reported MOFs with high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity also possess low C2H2 uptake, insufficient for the efficient separation of C2H2/ C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. Thus, the key to constructing MOFs for one-step C2H4 purication is to nd the \u201csweet spot\u201d by creating an optimal chemical environment on the pore surface and suitable pore size so as to achieve simultaneously high selectivities for both C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4.\nIn this work, we present a new pillar-layer MOF constructed via zinc ions, triazole and a dicarboxylate linker (denoted as HIAM-210, HIAM = Hoffman Institution of Advanced Material), which combines suitable pore dimensions and a pore chemical environment for one-step separation of C2H4 from C2H2/C2H4/ C2H6 ternary mixtures. The adjacent uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013O atoms decorated on the pore surface act as strong binding sites for preferential adsorption toward C2H6 and C2H2 over C2H4, enabling HIAM-210 to have relatively high adsorption selectivities for C2H2/C2H4 (2.0) and C2H6/C2H4 (2.0), which exceed most of the MOFs previously tested for C2H4/C2H6/C2H2 separation, such as TJT-100 (1.8 and 1.2), ZJNU-115 (2.05 and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "Yellow rod-shaped crystals of HIAM-210 were obtained by solvothermal reactions of Zn(NO3)2$6H2O, 1,2,4-triazole (TZ) and 1,4-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (NDC) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/H2O solution at 423 K (Fig. 1a and S1, see the ESI\u2020 for detailed synthesis). Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that HIAM-210 crystallized in the monoclinic crystal system with a space group of Pm (Table S2\u2020). The asymmetric unit of the structure contains ten independent Zn(II) centers coordinated in three fashions (Fig. S2\u2020). Zn1, Zn3, Zn4, Zn7, Zn8, and Zn9 are tetrahedrally coordinated to two oxygen atoms from two NDC and two N atoms from two TZ ligands respectively; Zn2 and Zn6 are octahedrally bonded to two oxygen atoms from two NDC and four N atoms from four TZ ligands respectively; Zn5 and Zn10 are pentahedrally coordinated to three oxygen atoms from two NDC and two N atoms from two TZ ligands respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1b, each TZ ligand connects to three Zn(II) ions through m1,2,4-bridging mode to form a 1D Zn\u2013TZ chain along the b-axis, and the 1D chains are interconnected through NDC linkers to form a 2D Zn\u2013TZ\u2013NDC layer. The layers are further pillared by the linear ditopic\nFig. 1 Structure of HIAM-210.

It is noteworthy that this structure is different from the widely reported Zn\u2013triazolate\u2013dicarboxylate frameworks where the 2D layer was formed only by metal\u2013triazolate coordination.17\u201321 The compound features an unprecedented topology with point symbols {43$52$7}${43$53}2${4\n3}${46$52$68$7$84}{46$66$83} (Fig. S3\u2020). The 1D channels of HIAM-210 were partitioned by benzene rings of NDC into arrays of interconnected cages with approximate sizes of 4.5 \u00d7 14.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 1e and S4\u2020). As shown in Fig. 1f, multiple uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013O atoms are unevenly distributed in four different cages, which have been believed to act as strong adsorption sites for hydrocarbons.3,22,23\nThe powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the assynthesized and activated sample of HIAM-210 matched well with the simulated pattern, conrming its phase purity and structural integrity upon activation (Fig. S5\u2020). N2 adsorption\u2013 desorption measurement at 77 K was carried out to evaluate the porosity of HIAM-210 (Fig. 2a). The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume were calculated to be 565.96 m2 g\u22121 and 0.24 cm3 g\u22121, respectively and the pore size was centered at 4.02 \u00c5 established by the Horvath\u2013Kawazoe method (inset, Fig. 2a), which is close to the kinetic diameter of C2 hydrocarbons. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the assynthesized and activated HIAM-210 revealed that the latter has a longer plateau from 353 to 453 K. A thermal stability test by treating the compound under high temperature indicated that HIAM-210 maintained its structural integrity upon heating at 423 K for 3 days (Fig. S7\u2020).

The good stability, suitable pore size and delicate pore environment prompted us to further investigate the adsorption and separation ability of HIAM-210 for C2 hydrocarbons.\nSingle-component adsorption isotherms of C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 for HIAM-210 were collected at 298 K and up to 1 bar, as shown in Fig. 2b. HIAM-210 adsorbs 52.44 cm3 g\u22121 (7.04 wt%) of C2H6 and 67.26 cm3 g\u22121 (7.82 wt%) of C2H2 at 1 bar and 298 K, higher than that of C2H4 (47.43 cm\n3 g\u22121, 5.94 wt%) under identical conditions, showing preferential adsorption of C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. To access the separation capability for C2H2/C2H4/ C2H6 mixtures, ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)24 selectivities for the two binary mixtures (C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4) were calculated and the dual-site Langmuir\u2013Freundlich tting parameters are shown in Table S3.\u2020 The calculated selectivities of C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 at 298 K and 1 bar are both 2.0, which are higher than those of most of the MOFs previously tested for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation (Fig. 2d).3,12\u201316,25\u201332 The isosteric heats of adsorption (Qst) of C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 on HIAM-210 were determined by using the Virial equation (Fig. S8 and S9\u2020). The initial Qst of C2H6 and C2H2 was 31.24 and 34.31 kJ mol\u22121, respectively, higher than that of C2H4 (22.72 kJ mol\u22121), suggesting that C2H6 and C2H2 have a relatively stronger interaction with the adsorbent than C2H4. It is worth noting that the Qst curve of C2H2 shows a decrease followed by an increase with the gas loading. The decrease at low coverage is caused by the fact that adsorption sites with higher interaction\n5914 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 5912\u20135917\nenergy are rst occupied before the sites with lower energy. In contrast, the increase at higher coverage should be attributed to the attractive interactions between the adsorbed molecules.33,34\nTo reveal the preferential adsorption behavior of C2H6 and C2H2 over C2H4, GCMC simulation was carried out to study the preferential adsorption sites (see the ESI\u2020 for simulation detail). The simulation shows that the primary adsorption site is located at Cage C with two adjacent uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013 O atoms which can capture all three hydrocarbon molecules (Fig. 3a\u2013c). The C2H2 molecule interacts strongly with the framework by forming multiple C\u2013H/O hydrogen bonds with two uncoordinated O atoms (2.57 and 2.93 \u00c5) and one coordinated O atom (2.70 \u00c5). For C2H6, the adsorbed molecule forms multiple bonding interactions involving one C\u2013H/p van der Waals (vdW) interaction (3.52 \u00c5) with TZ, and three C\u2013H/O hydrogen bonds with three O atoms (2.84\u20133.00 \u00c5, including two uncoordinated and one coordinated one). In contrast, we found C2H4 is weakly adsorbed by longer bonding distances including three C\u2013H/O hydrogen bonds with three O atoms (3.06\u20133.54 \u00c5, including two uncoordinated and one coordinated one) and one C\u2013H/p vdW interaction (3.43 \u00c5) with TZ. The different interaction patterns between the gas and framework induced different binding energies with the trend of C2H2 (21.44 kJ mol\u22121) > C2H6 (19.29 kJ mol \u22121) > C2H4 (16.39 kJ mol \u22121), obtained from DFT calculations. This trend is consistent with the sequences of adsorption isotherms and heats of adsorption. Moreover, we noticed a secondary adsorption site located in Cage B, which only adsorbs the C2H2 molecule (Fig. 3d). In Cage B, the C2H2 molecule also interacts with the uncoordinated\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The above phenomenon indicates that the adjacent uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013O atoms along the channels of HIAM-210 are crucial for the preferential recognition of C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4.\nFig. 4 Dynamic breakthrough tests on HIAM-210.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nTo further evaluate the competitive adsorption of C2H2 and C2H6 on HIAM-210, GCMC simulation was conducted by introducing an equimolar binary mixture into the framework. The results show that C2H2 still occupies the primary binding sites within Cage C near the two adjacent uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013O atoms. In contrast, C2H6 molecules tend to bind with uncoordinated carboxylate\u2013O atoms in Cage A and Cage D (Fig. S10\u2020). The results indicated that the binding energy of C2H2 in Cage C is higher than that of C2H6 at similar adsorption sites, which is consistent with the previous binding energy calculations.\nDynamic breakthrough experiments were further carried out to evaluate the feasibility of using HIAM-210 for the separation of C2 binary and ternary mixtures. As depicted in Fig. 4a, b and S11,\u2020 HIAM-210 is capable of efficiently separating C2H4 from C2H2/C2H4 (50/50 and 1/99, v/v) and C2H6/C2H4 (50/50 and 10/ 90, v/v) binary mixtures. C2H4 always rst eluted through the column to produce polymer-grade (>99.95%) C2H4. Breakthrough tests for ternary mixtures were subsequently performed. As shown in Fig. 4c, this compound can separate C2H4 from the equimolar ternary mixture. And breakthrough measurement with a gas mixture of C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 (1/90/9, v/ v) that is close to the gas compositions in real applications was carried out. It was observed that C2H4 eluted out rst at the 30th min, followed by C2H6 at the 38th min and C2H2 at the 39th min, producing polymer-grade C2H4 during the interval between the breakthrough of C2H4 and C2H6 with a productivity of 2.56 L kg\u22121 (Fig. 4d). Considering the potential interference and competitive adsorption of moisture in practical processes, we carried out a breakthrough experiment under a humid environment of 50% relative humidity (RH). As shown in Fig. 4e, the breakthrough curves and productivity of pure C2H4 under humid and dry environments were similar, demonstrating the\nes for binarymixtures with the composition of (a) C2H2/C2H4 (50/50, v/ ixtures with the composition of (c) C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 (34/33/33, v/v/v) ison of the breakthrough curves under humid and dry environments; (d)\nChem.

To further evaluate the recyclability of the material, the adsorption column was regenerated under a helium ow (10 mL min\u22121) at 373 K, and four consecutive breakthrough cycles were carried out. The results displayed no noticeable decrease of the separation capability of the adsorbent (Fig. 4f). The above tests suggest the durability of HIAM-210 for C2H4 purication under real-world industrial conditions."
