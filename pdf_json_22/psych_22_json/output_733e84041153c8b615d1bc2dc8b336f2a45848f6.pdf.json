Development of an applicable adult-oriented protocol and demonstration of its effectiveness is warranted. The present study outlined the development and evaluation of Core Autism Parenting Skills (CAPS), which targets to enhance parenting self-efficacy (PSE) intervention for adult children with ASD by addressing two intervention goals in parallel: acquisition of parenting skills and cultivating positive attributes. In CAPS, PSE is operationalised into four parent roles: to observe, reinforce, empathise, and accompany, each with requisite attributes, skills, and prescribed training. Twenty-seven parents with adult children with ASD (aged 16\u201337) were recruited. They completed measures assessing their PSE, competence in the four parent roles, and emotional well-being at pre-training, posttraining and 2-month follow-up. The intervention was well-received by the participants and reported significant improvements in PSE, parent role competence at post-training and 2-month follow-up. The applicability of PSE and parent role competence in constructing effective parenting intervention for adult children with ASD was supported.\nKeywords: autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), parenting self-efficacy, mindfulness, adult, Chinese, parent\nINTRODUCTION\nAmple studies suggested that parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are susceptible to elevated parenting stress, even compared with children with other developmental disabilities (Hayes and Watson, 2013). They tend to report elevated rates of anxiety and depression, poorer quality of life and overall psychological well-being (Weitlauf et al., 2014; Pisula and Por\u00eabowicz-D\u00f6rsmann, 2017). Impact on parents\u2019 personal life also extends to occupational, social and recreational areas (Smith et al., 2008; Nealy et al., 2012).\nASD-specific symptom severity (i.e., impairments in social communication and interaction and restricted patterns of behaviours) and co-occurring behavioural problems are suggested to be the two most decisive factors in contributing parental distress and negative parenting behaviours (Dieleman et al., 2018). ASD symptoms and behaviour problems in adolescents and adults with\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 841264\nASD tend to persist or shift in presentation, continuously influencing the well-being of mothers (Orsmond et al., 2006). Even with maturity in age, grown children with ASD continually rely on parents for medical, academic and daily living arrangements (Kanne et al., 2011; Hume et al., 2014; Strunk et al., 2014). A 10-year follow-up study showed that maternal anxiety about the child\u2019s day-to-day activities and care arrangements subsides when a grown child moves out. However, maternal depressive symptoms remain stable in those who had previous concerns about their child\u2019s transition to adult independence (Barker et al., 2011). Parents continue to be the primary source of support and care for their adult children, having high childcare responsibility and involvement and experiencing chronic parenting stress throughout mid-age to advanced age (Barker et al., 2011).\nMoreover, the developmental need for greater autonomy in grown children may easily conflict with the parent\u2019s guidance. A diary study revealed that parents of adolescents with ASD experience more frequent arguments, on top of other daily challenges such as increased time for caretaking and intrusions of work time (Smith et al., 2010). In adulthood, mother-child interactions are often more aversive, resulting in negative family dynamics and recurrent conflicts (Golan et al., 2018). Maternal well-being and mother-child interaction created a vicious cycle: maternal pessimism about the child\u2019s future maintained the harsh feelings between parents and child or within the parents themselves; negative mother-child interaction prevents effective parenting to be implemented, maintaining their hopelessness (Orsmond et al., 2006).\nIn order to empower parents\u2019 coping to the life-long parenting stress, research attention was drawn to psychosocial factors that support parenting resilience (Hayes and Watson, 2013; Prata et al., 2019). Parenting self-efficacy (PSE), described as a \u201cparent\u2019s belief in his or her ability to influence the child and his or her environment to foster the child\u2019s development and success\u201d (Ardelt and Eccles, 2001, p. 945), is a psychosocial factor that is associated with adaptive parenting, and well-being in parents and children (Albanese et al., 2019). In mothers with children with ASD, higher PSE in parents is associated with decreased parental anxiety, depression, and child behavioural problems (Hastings and Brown, 2002; Kuhn and Carter, 2006; Weiss et al., 2012). Research also suggested that PSE can be enhanced through professionally supported intervention, translating into improved child, parent and service outcomes (Keen et al., 2010).\nIn the field of ASD, recent discussions on intervention for PSE advocated a two-pronged approach comprised of (1) problem-focused strategies in remediating problem behaviours and (2) strategies to promote psychological acceptance for situations beyond control (Weiss et al., 2016). The rationale of the first prong of intervention could be attributed to the role of the environment and people around individuals with ASD in maintaining behavioural problems and evoking negative responses (Horner et al., 2002). Being the people they most often are rewarded by, parents and the family members serve as one of the most substantial reinforcing factors to problem behaviours (Reeve and Carr, 2000). Equipping parents with problem-focused strategies could improve the generalizability of skills, intensify\ntreatment and augment treatment outcomes (Anderson and Romanczyk, 1999). Nevertheless, building self-efficacy in parents requires skill acquisition and, more importantly, nurturing acceptance, hopefulness, compassion and endurance, which is advocated in the second prong of intervention. Individuals with ASD can be challenging to understand due to their atypical social responsiveness and maladaptive behaviours (Falk et al., 2014). When being confronted with these challenges, parents may not receive clear reinforcement in terms of \u201cpositive\u201d changes in their child\u2019s behaviour or demeanour. They may start to perceive themselves as ineffective parents. Parents\u2019 capacity in adhering to behavioural treatment programmes could be further reduced by their mental health problems (Moore, 2009) and loss of hope after observing regression in some critical skills in their children (Bashir et al., 2014). Under these circumstances, providing parents with new behavioural management plans may not affect them if they already perceive themselves as ineffectual (Falk et al., 2014). Cultivating positive attributes and psychological acceptance in the face of setbacks and regressions are thus necessary for promoting PSE among parents of children with ASD.\nNotably, existing intervention for parents with adolescents and adults with ASD was not developed to enhance PSE. For instance, some targeted at enhancing children\u2019s social skills (Schultz et al., 2012), parents\u2019 overall emotional well-being (Singh et al., 2014) or family communication (Golan et al., 2018). Intervention targeting PSE are scarce. The research team aimed at supplementing the above intervention gaps by developing a training intervention focusing on PSE for parents with adult ASD children. We started by operationalising PSE as the acquisition of competence of four parent roles derived from our clinical experiences and about the role theory, positive behavioural support, mindfulness, developmental psychology, and family life cycle. The four critical parent roles are summarised below:"

            "text": "As discussed above, parents\u2019 sense of hope in soliciting children\u2019s change is fundamental to effective behavioural treatment. Loss of hope is particularly prominent as children reach adulthood. Maturation in age does not bring hope in increased independence, but saturation in growth and need for autonomy; both are obstacles to adhering to parental instructions and changing one\u2019s behavioural pattern, creating parent-child conflicts. As negative interaction accumulates, parents commonly present with a fixated, negative perception toward their adult children, such as \u201cthey always bring inconvenience,\u201d \u201cthey can never change,\u201d maintaining negative interaction and feeling of hopelessness. Fundamental to any skill acquisition, parents need to nurture an open, curious and non-judgemental attitude in observing their children in order for them to interrupt the vicious cycle of negative interactions and hopeless feelings. These positive attributes echo the concept of mindfulness, which involves a non-judgmental observation of the ongoing stream of internal and external stimuli in the present moment and adopting an attitude of curiosity, openness, and acceptance toward one\u2019s own experience (Bishop et al., 2004).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 841264"

Parents need to equip with appropriate behavioural management skills on the adolescents\u2019 disruptive behaviours and reinforce adaptive ones (Burrell and BorregoJr., 2012). To parents, challenges in delivering reinforcement move beyond the technical aspects: they tend to present with a biased perception overemphasising inadequacies, regression and negativity toward their children, contributing to a frequent complaint that there is no opportunity to give reinforcement. This phenomenon may be particularly prominent in Asian communities due to cultural influences and the frequent use of authoritarian parenting styles (Shen et al., 2018). In order to equip parents to be an effective interventionist, parent training should also harbour positivity and address the biased perception toward their adult children before any reinforcement techniques could be implemented."

Alexithymia, defined as a deficit in identifying and describing one\u2019s own emotions and feelings (Taylor, 1984), has been recognised as a contributing factor of mental health problems in individuals with ASD (Gaigg et al., 2018; Morie et al., 2019). Individuals with alexithymia need others to name their emotions and facilitate appraisals toward triggering events (Vanheule et al., 2011). While regulating emotions in individuals with ASD is assumed mainly by parents, parents themselves also exhibited alexithymia traits (Szatmari et al., 2008; Durukan et al., 2018). Inability to understand and express emotional states in parents leads to a reduced capacity to contain the children\u2019s emotions, reduce parental reflective functioning, and hinder positive relationships with their children (Y\u00fcr\u00fcmez et al., 2014; Ahrnberg et al., 2021). Parents are therefore in need of training to enhance their emotional sensitivity toward self and others and techniques in delivering empathic responses to the children to co-regulate their negative emotions in times of stressful events."

ASD was found to be associated with the increased likelihood of a disordered parentchildren relationship characterised by high expressed emotions (Smith et al., 2010). Relatedly, family leisure activities are often sacrificed for various reasons related to the diagnosis (Nealy et al., 2012). Both reduce the joy that family members can experience in the family context. Repairing the communication pattern and fostering positive emotional exchange in the parent-child relationship would facilitate the functioning of the individual, the parent and the family to navigate various stressors in the life journey. Furthermore, the developmental nature of ASD poses tremendous demand in the resilience of parents, which depends on positive relationships with themselves and external resources\n(Bronfenbrenner and Ceci, 1994). Self-compassion, defined as self-kindness, common humanity and mindfulness (Neff, 2003), emerges as a powerful source of resilience in the face of stressors. Self-compassion often leads to greater perceived confidence, less fear of failure and more persistence and goal reengagement after failure (Neff et al., 2005; Breines and Chen, 2012), which are crucial attributes in accompanying a child with ASD in his/her growth, and should be cultivated in intervention for parents of children with ASD (Bohadana et al., 2019).\nThe current paper outlined the development of parent training, the Core Autism Parenting Skills (CAPS), which aims at enhancing the PSE of parents of adults with ASD by improving the competence of the four parent roles. It was hypothesised that the CAPS would demonstrate (1) acceptability as measured by group attendance and homework compliance; (2) effectiveness in enhancing PSE of parents and the attributes and skills in the four parent roles, and (3) spill-over effectiveness in reducing negative mood and parenting stress."

Parent interventions were often delivered in conjunction with social competence training (Lopata et al., 2010; Thomeer et al., 2012) or cognitive behavioural therapy (Storch et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2014) to enhance children\u2019s outcomes. Some intervention focusing on parental outcomes included PSE as an auxiliary outcome (e.g., Iadarola et al., 2018; Kuravackel et al., 2018), but their development was not oriented to enhance PSE.

PSE represents a domain-specific subset of self-efficacy and is found to be associated with adaptive parenting, psychosocial adjustment, and\nwell-being in parents and children (Albanese et al., 2019).

All PWAs applied for services, and their parents were interviewed jointly by their case manager at intake. All parents were introduced to the CAPS at intake or subsequent phone interviews if the parents were not available to join the intake. Parents interested in the CAPS were put on a waitlist and contacted to confirm enrolment before groups started. Each intervention group comprised 7\u201310 parents. The programme consisted of 8 weekly sessions; each lasted 2 h. The session outline of the CAPS is summarised in Table 2. The preintervention assessment was mailed to parents 1 week prior to the first session and was collected at the first session. The postintervention assessment was collected at the last session of the intervention. The follow-up assessment was collected at a reunion session 2 months after the last session or by mail for absentees of the reunion session. All intervention was conducted in 2021 and delivered in-person."

            "text": "The current study examined the acceptability and effectiveness of the Core Autism Parenting Skills (CAPS) in enhancing parenting self-efficacy (PSE) of parents with adult ASD children by improving the core competence of four parent roles: to observe, reinforce, empathise and accompany. The acceptability of the intervention was reflected in the mean attendance rate as high as 85%. The high attendance rate reflected that parents were motivated and receptive toward the CAPS training. Despite achieving a lower mean rate than attendance, the homework submission mean rate was skewed toward the higher end: about 70% of the parents submitted at least half of the assigned homework. Satisfactory homework compliance reflected parents\u2019 eagerness in practising the skills in daily lives despite heavy caretaking responsibility and daily hassles.\nOn the effectiveness of the CAPS, significant post-intervention improvement was reported in PSE and the roles to observe, reinforce, and empathise measured by the ASPR. A relatively high score in the role \u201cto accompany\u201d on ASPR at preintervention (5.87) may have made statistically significant change more difficult even the scores rose numerically to 6.50 and 6.54 at post-intervention and follow-up, respectively. Significant changes in the first three roles at post-intervention suggested that training delivered in CAPS effectively enhanced role competence. Specifically, the training method in CAPS first focused on cultivating positive attributes then equipping parenting skills. The demonstrated gains in the CAPS supported the twopronged intervention approach for parent intervention in ASD, as discussed in Weiss et al. (2016), promoting psychological attributes and acquiring problem-focused strategies. Applying the two-pronged intervention in CAPS may also echo the emerging trend of integrating treatment originated from behavioural principles and mindfulness-based intervention to complement each other. For instance, a mindfulness-based positive behavioural support programme was developed to address the limitation that parents learning only behavioural\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 841264\napproaches may quit easily due to decreasing motivation and implementation fatigue (Singh et al., 2019).\nAnother promising finding was that parents reported being abler to cultivate positive attributes toward themselves, potentially reflecting better self-awareness and self-compassion. Parents with children with disabilities often put the needs of their children, instead of their own, at a higher priority, which commonly leads to burnout and exhaustion (Nealy et al., 2012). Paradoxically, parents sacrificing their well-being for caretaking tasks did not promote children\u2019s well-being but was detrimental to their resilience and overall family functioning (Pisula and Por\u00eabowicz-D\u00f6rsmann, 2017). The CAPS attempted to address the lack of self-care commonly observed in parents of individuals with ASD by relating the positive attributes in the four parent roles on themselves. A change in relationship with self may potentially enhance their resilience and self-compassion, facilitating their acquisition and continued practices of the attributes and skills shared in the CAPS training.\nThe results on spill-over effectiveness in reducing negative mood and parenting stress in parents were contrary to our hypothesis. All variables did not demonstrate significant improvement at post-intervention. Notably, the divergence in outcomes of parents\u2019 emotional well-being and PSE in the current study may support separate psychological constructs for intervention. Reduction in parenting stress was commonly reported in other parent interventions, especially for parents with younger children (see review Lichtle et al., 2020). On the contrary, parents with adult children may have suffered from stress more chronically and are less likely to show a significant decrease of negative mood within 8 weeks. In our previous studies on social competence training for individuals with ASD, parents of adolescent participants showed a significant reduction in parenting stress but not parents with adult children (Chan et al., 2018; Leung et al., 2019). Possibly, for parents with adult\nchildren to alleviate their negative mood, they require more intensive and long-term intervention.\nThe CAPS enriched the existing parent-focused intervention in ASD in two folds. First, it filled the service gap for parents with older children emerging into adulthood. Despite a recognised dependency of adults with ASD on their parents, intervention empowering the parent role in this developmental stage was insufficient. Individuals with ASD in more advanced age are confronted with wanting more autonomy and continuously relying on a trusted person for the living arrangement. In such connection, interventions developed for parents of children with ASD may not be readily applicable to those with older children, as the interventions for the latter has to take a delicate balance between allowing autonomy and intervening. The CAPS solidified its age-appropriateness by embedding teaching contents in parent-child conflicts common to this age range. Further, the CAPS emphasises the importance of observing children with curiosity and patience in \u201cto observe,\u201d thus allowing room and space before parents decide to intervene.\nAnother clinical significance of the CAPS was its orientation to enhance PSE in parents of children with ASD through role competence. As discussed above, different psychological constructs may require different interventions. Interventions developed to enhance other psychological or behavioural outcomes may not guarantee a change in PSE and vice versa. The CAPS was a preliminary attempt to define and operationalise PSE and related parenting roles: to observe, reinforce, empathise and accompany, in the ASD population from our clinical experiences and research in ASD. It demonstrated that enhancing role competence through a two-pronged approach targeting both acquisition of parenting skills and cultivating positive attributes would be a possible intervention in enhancing PSE. The CAPS also serves as a prototype in blending essence of different treatment modalities, including positive behavioural support, mindfulness, developmental psychology and family life\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 841264\ncycle, tailoring intervention for a specific population.With its demonstrated effectiveness, future research on the CAPS could examine the mediating effect of role competence on PSE with a larger sample size. Its applicability on parents with children of different ages or IQ levels under the autism spectrum could also be further explored."

The validity of findings was potentially limited by a few factors in the methodology, including a lack of a control group, a lack of validated assessment on the four parent roles and a lack of long-term follow-up data. Further studies may extend the scope of research by adopting a randomised controlled design, a mediation analysis illustrating how the change in role competence contributes to PSE\u2019s change and a more comprehensive assessment on potential constructs that mediate the change in PSE. The effectiveness of the CAPS was only examined among parents with children having an FSIQ of 70 or above. Its generalizability to the entire autism spectrum has yet to be confirmed. Modification and application to parents of children in young developmental stage or with other neurodevelopmental comorbidities, e.g., ADHD or intellectual disabilities, may be conducted to examine the intervention\u2019s applicability across different ages, needs and symptom severity."
