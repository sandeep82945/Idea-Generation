    "abstractText": "We investigated the communicative gestures used by chimpanzee and human infants. In contrast to previous studies, we compared the species at the same age (12\u201314 months) and used multiple groups living in diverse socioecological settings for both species. We recorded gestures produced by infants and those produce by others and directed toward infants. We classified the gestures into the following types: human-usual, chimpanzee-usual, and species-common; and searched for within species and between species differences. We found no significant differences between groups or species in overall rates of infant-produced or infant-received gestures, suggesting that all of these infants produced and received gestures at similar levels. We did find significant differences, however, when we considered the three types of gesture. Chimpanzee infants produced significantly higher rates of chimpanzee-usual gestures, and human infants produced significantly higher rates of human-usual gestures, but there was no significant species difference in the species-common gestures. Reports of species differences in gesturing in young infants, therefore, could be influenced by investigators\u2019 choice of gesture type. Interestingly, we found that 1-year-old infants produced the gesture of \u201chold mutual gaze\" and that the chimpanzee infants had a significantly higher rate than the human infants. We did not find strong evidence that the specific types of gestural environment experienced by young infants influenced the types of gestures that infants produce. We suggest that at this point in development (before human infants use lots of speech), nonverbal communicative gestures may be equally important for human and chimpanzee infants.",

The 1980s were also an exciting time in comparative psychology, as we learned about the communicative capacity of great apes, through the numerous ape-language studies and the long-term field studies, especially by Goodall. I (K.A.B.) was fortunate indeed to begin my graduate studies at Georgia State University during this exciting time, while renting a room in Sally Boysen\u2019s house. Sally regaled me with many stories of her experiences with\nchimpanzees, from their strength, their humor, their strategic social negotiations, and their capacity for strong social bonds (with humans as well as other chimpanzees). We discussed the different perspectives of ape-language studies, and what it meant to be communicatively competent.\nAfter these conversations with Sally, while reflecting on what I learned about chimpanzees from her, I was reading Sacks (1985) book about humans\u2019 need to be understood communicatively. I was working with the young chimpanzees in the Yerkes nursery, and watching how they interacted with other people, and these experiences led me to consider the importance of the co-construction of communicative meaning in chimpanzees. I recall observing nursery-reared chimpanzees of 3 and 4 years of age, very desirous of play, trying to get the human staff to play with them, especially chase play. The staff, however, had worked hard all morning, and by early afternoon were invested in resting. Initial attempts by the chimpanzees to engage the staff in play were relatively polite and resulted in some tickle play. But the chimpanzees wanted to be chased. The chimpanzees tried * Kim A.

They would climb on the fence above the staffs\u2019 seated position, dangle their legs, and then drop down on their heads, quickly running away with a playface. Although the staff might simply yell, or shake a fist, the first or even the second or third time, once the chimpanzees had dropped on their head a sufficiently annoying number of times, the staff would jump up, and angrily run after the chimpanzees, much to delight of the chimpanzees\u2014very happy to finally be engaged in chase play. At the time, when the initial behaviors did not serve the chimpanzees desires, my impression was that the chimpanzee acted like they thought that either the staff did not understand what they wanted or that they, themselves, had not asked in the right way. To the chimpanzees, it seemed perfectly sensible to keep trying to find a way to communicate their desires. I once tried to convey this to the staff: \u201cYou know that the chimpanzees jump on your head because they think that is the way to ask you to chase them,\u201d but the staff did not seem to appreciate this remark or me going on to tell them that they could instead encourage more polite and agreeable communication. I was struck with the chimpanzees\u2019 continuous striving to be understood via gestural communication, and their flexibility in co-constructing meaning with gesture.\nThus, I began my career with the knowledge that chimpanzees were sentient beings, with personalities and natural abilities to communicate nonverbally. This article is dedicated to Sally, with thanks for the enormous contribution she has made to my understanding and appreciation of chimpanzees.\nChimpanzees and humans share a long evolutionary history. It is therefore possible that these species may share commonalities in nonlinguistic communication, either in types of communication or in developmental processes from which communication emerges. In particular, the gestures of 1-year-old human infants may have similarities with those of 1-year-old chimpanzee infants. One aspect of importance in development may be the types of care experienced by infants, which can vary widely within species. For example, in the wild, chimpanzee infants spend much of their time in contact with their mothers (e.g., Goodall, 1986; Nishida, 1990, 2012), whereas in some captive settings, they may spend much of their time separated from their caregivers and placed on their backs, experiencing face-to-face contact with human caregivers from an early age (e.g., Bard, 1996). Similarly, human infants can experience much of their first year in physical contact with caregivers, including the mother (Crittenden & Marlowe, 2013; Meehan & Hawks, 2013: Keller, 2007), whereas in other settings, they can experience independence from physical contact with increased amounts of face-toface contact (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021; Takeshita et\u00a0al., 2009). Early\nexperiences of proximal caregiving (e.g., wild chimpanzees and foraging people) may engender more tactile communication in infants, whereas early experiences of distal caregiving (e.g., laboratory-reared chimpanzees and Western middleclass humans) may engender more visually based communication in infants. It would be interesting to examine whether these differences in early caregiving environments relate to differences in communication both within and between species, as this would provide insight into the impact of caregiving environments on the development of infant communication, illuminating similarities and differences in the early communication of these two closely related species.\nThere is a great deal of evidence that both human and chimpanzee infants communicative nonverbally, with gestures and sounds. There are a few studies that have shown cultural variation in the types of gestures used by human infants (e.g., Abels, 2020; Kwon et\u00a0al., 2018), and in the frequency of some gestures in human infants (Blake et\u00a0al., 2003; Salomo & Liszkowski, 2013). There are a few studies that have demonstrated that infant chimpanzees use communicative gestures in captive settings (e.g., Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b; Tomasello et\u00a0al., 1994; Tomasello et\u00a0al., 1985) and in the wild (Brundl et\u00a0al., 2020; Plooij, 1979; van Lawick-Goodall, 1968), albeit most field studies of chimpanzee gestures do not focus on, or include infants (e.g., Hobaiter & Byrne, 2011; Roberts et\u00a0al., 2012, respectively). There are a few studies that have documented cultural differences in gestures among wild chimpanzees, but these focus on adult gestures (e.g., grooming hand clasp: Van Leeuwen et\u00a0al., 2017; Wrangham et\u00a0al., 2016; McGrew & Tutin, 1978; directed scratching for grooming: Wilke et\u00a0al., 2022; a variety of behaviors that serve to attract attention to the self, such as leaf-clipping: Bessa et\u00a0al., 2022; Whiten et\u00a0al., 2001; and making noise by leaf stripping or branch bending to threat or warn, respectively: Whiten et\u00a0al., 2001). Few studies compare gestures in human infants with gestures in chimpanzee infants.\nMatching the age in cross-species comparisons is important for a variety of reasons (Bard & Leavens, 2014). Studies of prelinguistic gestures in humans focus on infants, therefore comparative studies ought to focus on infants as well (i.e., matching the groups on at least one variable: Leavens et\u00a0al., 2019). The most relevant reason, for the current study, is to match the groups in amount of early experiences and stage of life. There are few studies that have directly compared gesture use between young chimpanzees and young humans (e.g., Kersken et\u00a0al., 2019). As far as we know, however, the current study is the first study of gesture use that directly compares multiple, diverse groups of human infants to multiple, diverse groups of chimpanzee infants. Using multiple groups is essential to capture the diversity within each species (e.g., Bard et\u00a0al., 2021). Given that there is diversity within species (e.g., cultural differences\n16\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\nor differences associated with early rearing: reviewed in Bard et\u00a0al., 2021) then comparing one group of humans (that may not be representative of the entire human species: e.g., Kline et\u00a0al., 2018) to one group of chimpanzees (that may not be representative of the entire chimpanzee species; Bard & Leavens, 2014; Leavens et\u00a0al., 2019) is fraught with confounds and is a design that does not isolate species membership as a causal variable. Thus, designs that embrace diversity for both species are more helpful than 1 group\u20131 species designs to indicate species differences."

            "text": "Among human infants, we know that there are cultural differences in the frequency or the prevalence of gestures, such as, point, show, offer, wave, and demonstrate. We also know that the vast majority of studies of infants, regardless of the topic area, have been conducted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (i.e., WEIRD: Henrich et\u00a0al., 2010) settings (Nielson et\u00a0al., 2017). Fewer rural Mayan infants pointed compared with urban Dutch and urban Chinese infants (Salomo & Liszkowski, 2013), although other studies found no cultural differences in pointing (e.g., among infants from Canadian, rural Peru, and rural India settings: Callaghan et\u00a0al., 2011). The frequency of requesting gestures varies with socioeconomic status (SES), with more requesting in infants from high SES families compared with low and medium SES families (Abels & Hutman, 2015), and there may be changes in frequency with age. In a study in Japan, for example, requesting gestures decreased from 9 and 14 months of age (Blake et\u00a0al., 2003). It seems that \u201cshow\u201d is particularly evident in urban dwelling infants (perhaps associated with distal caregiving), since no show gestures were observed in rural Nigerian infants (Childers et\u00a0al., 2007). \u201cShow\u201d can be when an infant holds an object for the partner to look at (which can be labelled as \u201cshow object\u201d) or when highlighting an unusual aspect of the self, as in mirrorself recognition studies (which can be labelled as \u201cshow self\u201d). A significant difference was found between the frequency of toddlers showing the face (the marked spot in mirror-recognition studies) between urban (German and India) compared with rural (Indian and Nso) communities (K\u00e4rtner et\u00a0al., 2012). In naturalistic observations, there is a relatively low frequency of showing objects by infants, albeit at significantly higher rates in urban (Chinese and Dutch) than in rural (Mayan) settings (average of eight, five vs. two per hour, respectively: Salomo & Liskowski, 2013). Notably low levels of showing were observed in free play between infants and mothers in an urban Japanese community (Blake et\u00a0al., 2003).\nOffering may be considered a gesture focusing on social etiquette, with strong cultural differences (Lancy, 2015). In many Western middle-class families, offering is part of a give-and-take exchange, perhaps with a goal of sharing attention on objects (e.g., Tomasello, 2019), whereas in many other communities, offering is part of the sharing etiquette of giving to others (e.g., Bakeman et\u00a0al., 1990; Lancy, 2015). Offering an object, thus, may mean, \u201cLet\u2019s exchange the object between us\u201d in the first instance, or maybe mean, \u201cHere is an object for you to have\u201d in the second instance. Although in both instances an object is offered, in the first the infant expects the object to be returned, but not in the second. This difference in meaning in the give/offer gesture may explain why Salomo and Liskowski (2013), for example, did not find cultural group differences in the frequency of the offer gesture.\nAnother gesture with potentially different meanings is \u201carm raise.\u201d In many WEIRD settings, this gesture is interpreted to mean that the infants want to be picked up (this was used as the prototypical example of the process of ontogenetic ritualization by Tomasello & Call, 2007; see Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b, for further details). This gesture may appear less often in cultural communities in which adults anticipate infants\u2019 needs (i.e., in which infants are not expected to signal their needs: Bard et\u00a0al., 2021; Morelli et\u00a0al., 2017) or in cultures in which caregivers sit together with infants rather than bringing infants up to the level of standing caregivers (Kwon et\u00a0al., 2018). In the comparative literature, the arm-raised gesture is often interpreted as an invitation for play, for chimpanzee infants living in captive settings and wild settings (e.g., Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b; Graham et\u00a0al., 2018; Plooij, 1979; Tomasello et\u00a0al., 1994; van Lawick-Goodall, 1968), but can be interpreted as a threat (Goodall, 1986), or as an invitation for grooming (Plooij, 1979). Differences in meaning of the arm raised gesture can be explained, in part, with knowledge of the movement trajectory of the arm (the raised arm moving down is a play invitation, whereas the arm being raised up is a threat, and the arms held in a static vertical position indicate the pick-me-up gesture) and positioning of the arm/hand (e.g., open hand for play invitation, back of the wrist for threat: Bard, 1996; Goodall, 1986). Rather than both arms, more often it is a single arm that is raised as a request for grooming (and soliciting grooming with a clasping hands gesture, which occurs only in some chimpanzee communities, is also single arms raised [McGrew & Tutin, 1978], but is not a skill observed in infants [Nakamura & Nishida, 2013; Wrangham et\u00a0al., 2016]).\nThere are additional gestures that focus on social etiquette, which may be very prevalent in some, but not all human cultures. For example, the finger to the lips with the \u201cshh\u201d sound (labelled the Quiet gesture by Kwon et\u00a0al., 2018) is a gesture with the conventionalized meaning for\n17\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\nothers to be quiet. Wagging the finger or shaking the head may both mean \u201cno, no,\u201d but the former usually is an admonishment to others, whereas the latter is usually an individual\u2019s refusal (reject or protest: Blake et\u00a0al., 2003). These and other gestures of social convention are not often included in human infant gesture studies, perhaps because it does not involve an object, and thus may be more difficult to be classified as a referential or intentional gesture. Similarly, some chimpanzee studies include gestures involving social manners such as rump or wrist presents (sometimes called wrist offer: Tomasello et\u00a0al., 1994), which can be interpreted as acknowledgements of rank relationships or appeasements (e.g., Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b). Perhaps because the outcome of this gesture may be the lack of aggression; for example, rather than an observable outcome, this gesture may be missed in some studies of chimpanzee gestures."

It has been shown that chimpanzees and bonobos share about 90% of their gestures (Graham et\u00a0al., 2018) and that young chimpanzees emit many gestures in the contexts of play (Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2016a), food begging (Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2020; van Lawick-Goodall, 1968), grooming (Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b), and travelling (Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2016b).\nA few studies have documented within-species differences\u2014for example, in gesture rates (higher rates in infants living in Kanyawara [Kibale National Park, Uganda] compared with Tai [Ivory Coast]: Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0 al., 2017), in repertoire size (significantly related to number of interaction partners: Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2017), and in the presence or absence of specific types of gestures, some indicating cultural customs (e.g., Whiten et\u00a0al., 1999) and others indicating flexibility (Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2016b). Another dimension of within-species differences is in the meaning of a gesture. For example, exaggerated loud scratches (Wilkes et\u00a0al., 2022) appear to have different meanings across wild chimpanzee sites: including \u201cGroom me here\u201d (in the Ngogo fieldsite: Pika & Mitani, 2006), \u201cPlease groom me\u201d (in two field sites: Sonso, Kanyawara), and \u201cLet me groom you\u201d (in the Kanyawara field site). We agree with the conclusion of Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al. (2017): \u201cHence, communicative abilities rely on a combination of social, physical, and cognitive development in the individual while interacting with the social and physical world surrounding it\u201d (p. 278)."

            "text": "There are just a few studies that have directly compared the gestural repertoires of human infants/juveniles to chimpanzee infants/juveniles. For example, Kersken et\u00a0al. (2019) found that 54% (28 of 52) of the gestures found in wild chimpanzees, aged 0\u20135 yrs, from Budongo, Uganda, were shared by human 1\u20132-year-olds (urban German combined with rural Ugandan infants). The most frequently observed gestures produced by human infants were \u201cdirected reach\u201d (i.e., point), \u201creach palm\u201d (i.e., request), \u201carm raise,\u201d and \u201cthrow object,\u201d which are also reported in chimpanzees living in both captive (e.g., Primate Foundation of Arizona: Berdecio & Nash, 1981; Yerkes Primate Center: Leavens, 2021; Tomasello et\u00a0al., 1994) and wild settings (e.g., Budongo: Byrne et\u00a0al., 2017; Gombe: van Lawick-Goodall, 1968; Tai & Kibale: Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2016b). Additionally, communicative milestones of both wild (Brundl et\u00a0al., 2020) and captive chimpanzees (Bard, 2017) appear very similar to those of humans in the first 5 years of life.\nAlthough previous comparative studies have sometimes made comparisons among great ape groups (e.g., Kersken et\u00a0al., 2019), no previous comparative study of gestures has investigated within-species variation in both human and chimpanzee infants. Additionally, we are not aware of any comparative study that has investigated both human-typical gestures and chimpanzee-typical gestures when comparing human with chimpanzee infant samples. Here we include both those gestures typically studied in human infants (sometimes called conventional gestures, such as pointing), and those typically observed in chimpanzee infants. Moreover, we compare three groups of chimpanzee infants living in diverse settings and three groups of human infants living in diverse settings, to investigate both within species and between species variation. We hasten to add, however, that our sample sizes were small. Therefore, this study can be interpreted as supporting (or rejecting) the premise that there are within-species variations in gestures, since we studied infants of each species that lived in diverse settings, but further studies will be required to support the generalizability of our findings.\nClassification of\u00a0gestures\nThere are many ways to classify gesture types. In chimpanzee studies, classifications range from classifying structural elements (e.g., Hobaiter & Byrne, 2011; Plooij, 1984; Roberts et\u00a0al., 2012), or classifying gestures in terms of the context in which they occur, to classifying meanings (Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b; Goodall, 1986). For example, suppose an individual X approaches another (Individual A) who is\n18\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\nof higher rank/dominance (context). At the level of structure elements, Individual X may display a \u201cfear grin,\u201d may present their rear end (or wrist), and/or may emit a specific type of pant-grunt vocalization directed at Individual A. One could simply classify these as \u201csubmissive\u201d gestures, since they were displayed in this context. If attending to the meaning, one could classify the different elements (i.e., that there was an indication of emotional arousal [fear grin] or that there was a gesture indicative of social etiquette [rump or wrist present] and/or there was a gesture indicative of dominance relationship [vocal pant-grunt] when given by Individual X indicates an acknowledgement that Individual A is dominant). Meaningfulness of gestures is sometimes assessed by determining the ASO (apparently satisfactory outcome: Hobaiter & Byrne, 2014), or the communicative message (e.g., Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b). We felt that it was important to distinguish gestures according to meaning, at the moment of occurrence, in part, because one cannot know what is being communicated after the fact, especially if only structural elements are record (e.g., touches to specific body locations or even specific touch-location configurations do not convey specific meanings: Bard et\u00a0al., 2019). We therefore choose to record the functional meaning of each gesture when it was observed. We recorded only those behaviors with communicative meaning or communicative intent but did not limit this to manual gestures.\nWe note that the same gesture may have different meanings across contexts and across cultural settings. For example, pointing in WEIRD settings may appear as part of a \u201cnatural pedagogy\u201d (Csibra & Gergely, 2011), interpreted to mean that the infant is inviting instruction (e.g., pointing to a picture in a book invites the parent to name the object: Liszkowski et\u00a0al., 2004). Pointing is found commonly among captive chimpanzees, with most studies finding more than half the subjects produce points, comprehend points, and are sensitive to partner\u2019s attention during pointing events (Krause et\u00a0al., 2018). Pointing is rare but present in wild chimpanzees as well (e.g., Budongo: Hobaiter et\u00a0al., 2014). Leavens (2021) suggests that pointing develops in both species when individuals encounter the referential problem space. The problem space is when an individual desires an object but there is a barrier to obtaining it directly. It becomes a referential problem space, when the individual has the capacity to refer both to the desired, but out-of-reach object and to a communicative partner willing to fulfil the request (Leavens et\u00a0al., 2005). This is the only current theory that explains both the cross-species and within species differences in propensity to point (Leavens, 2021). Lancy (2015) argues from the historical cross-cultural database that pointing in human infants is rare and caregivers may not respond to it. Much is made of ostensive cues, especially eye gaze, signaling the intentionality of infants\u2019 communicative gestures (e.g., using a WEIRD framework: Gomez, 1996),\nbut there are human communities in which gaze is only directed down the social hierarchy and other human communities in which infants are attentive to multiple events at the same time, albeit not necessarily through gaze (reviewed in Bard et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe gesture of \u201cshow\u201d can have many different meanings. Most common in the developmental literature is showing an object. However, also common in infants living in middle-class, urban settings is \u201cshowing self,\u201d which, similar to showing an object, is highlighting something as special. Showing self is defined as infant highlighting some (unique) feature on the infant\u2019s own body (e.g., when toddlers have mark on their face: K\u00e4rtner et\u00a0al., 2012), or in the infant\u2019s own actions. It is interesting that in the anthropological literature, \u201cshow\u201d does not refer to an infant gesture but rather to caregivers parading through the village while holding the infant facing outward to an admiring crowd (Lancy, 2015) or making infants look beautiful for others to behold\u2014for example, to encourage child care by others in Beng communities (Gottlieb, 1995). In other human communities, infants are socialized to blend in, to be in harmony with the social group, and \u201cshowing off\u201d or any behavior designed to make an individual stand out is rarely seen (Keller, 2007; Keller, 2018; Morelli et\u00a0al., 2018; Yovsi et\u00a0al., 2009)."

Rather, it is a descriptive account of the production of communicative gestures based on approximately 45 minutes of natural observation for each of 51 infants collected originally for a study of joint attention (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021). This study differs from many studies of human gestures but is similar to many studies of chimpanzee gestures in that it is based exclusively on observation. We think it is important to document gesture production during infants\u2019 everyday interactions with others, in their everyday ecology, in order to understand the ecological situatedness of gestural communication (Dahl, 2017). We discuss the groups as embedded within their sociocultural ecologies (Keller & K\u00e4rtner, 2013; Rogoff et\u00a0al., 2018), with the presumption that the behaviors of infant and caregiver(s) are adaptive to specific socioecologies (Fouts et\u00a0al., 2016; Keller, 2018).\nOur main aim is to document the extent to which we see variety in the types of gestures produced (and received) by infants across six samples, which vary in both socioecology and species membership. One hypothesis is that there will be species differences. Perhaps human infants will differ from chimpanzee infants in the frequency and range of gestural repertoire due to the higher levels of communicative competence of the human species. Alternatively, chimpanzee\n19\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\ninfants, without spoken language, may rely more on nonverbal gestural communication than do human infants. Our hypothesis, however, is that there will be diversity in the gestures within each species, given that we are sampling quite diverse groups (see Bard et\u00a0al., 2021, for further details)."

We chose these three settings primarily because they represent a wide diversity of socioecological settings in which extant humans live, and secondarily because we could obtain videotaped recordings of the everyday behavior of infants.\nSocioecology of the human infants The UK infants were videotaped mostly in their living rooms, most often with their mother, although all lived in two-parent families, some also interacted with an older sibling. Parents practiced distal caregiving. All UK families had many toys and books designed for infant play. Some had a grandmother in the household, but she was not present in the videotapes.\nThe Aka infants were videotaped outdoors, in the clearings outside of their mobile, beehive shaped huts. They had a network of caregivers (e.g., Meehan & Hawkes, 2013) and lived in a community of 25\u201335 individuals of mixed ages, mixed kin, and both sexes. Aka infants experienced proximal caregiving from many caregivers (Meehan & Hawkes, 2013), and ethnotheories of \u201cfierce egalitarianism\u201d (Gray, 2009). The Aka infants had access to rain-forest vegetation and to\u00a0various cooking utensils and tools, but there were no dedicated infant toys.\nThe Nso infants were videotaped mostly in the communal clearings outside of their permanent mud brick houses. There was at least one social partner with the infant (albeit not always the mother), but usually there were between six and 45 people of mixed ages, and both sexes in the community with whom infants could interact. Nso infants experienced proximal caregiving from many caregivers (Keller et\u00a0al., 2009), with ethnotheories of \u201chierarchical\ninterconnectedness\u201d (households were patrilineal: Keller, 2021). There were household objects, natural vegetation, and some animals available for infants to play with. Rarely a family had a toy, such as a ball."

The PRI and Zoo chimpanzees were combined due to the small samples and the lack of obvious group differences in outcomes. We chose these settings primarily because they represent a wide diversity of socioecological settings in which extant chimpanzees live, and secondarily because we could obtain videotaped recordings of the everyday behavior of infants living in these settings.\nSocioecology of chimpanzee settings The Gombe infants lived in the tropical rainforest of the Gombe National Park. The available social partners always included the biological mother, and other partners, including siblings, unrelated families, and adult males were often available. Gombe infants experienced proximal caregiving, within a fission-fusion community with a male dominance hierarchy (Goodall, 1986). There was natural vegetation available but no human artifacts for Gombe infants.\nThe Chester infants lived in a captive environment typical of most zoos, with an outdoor (ground) area and indoor (concrete floor) area containing climbing structures, canvas hammock-like areas, and hanging ropes. Chester infants experienced proximal caregiving and lived in a stable social group of 26 other chimpanzees, including peers, juveniles, adolescents, and adults of both sexes. The infants played on the hanging ropes and had a few plastic toys available for enrichment. Most of the videotaping took place while the infants were inside.\nThe PRI infants lived in a very enriched physical setting with an outdoor area containing a 30-m high climbing structure with ropes, tubes, and wooden platforms at different levels of the enclosure, and large indoor areas for sleeping. The infants experienced proximal caregiving from their mothers, lived in a stable group of 11 other chimpanzees (but without\n20\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\nsiblings or juveniles), and had distal interactions with an adult male human experimenter while participating in cognitive studies each weekday (e.g., Matsuzawa, 2007). Infants played with natural vegetation and ropes while outside, and some manmade objects and toys while inside. All of the videotaping of the PRI infants took place while they were outside.\nThe Home-raised infants lived in a Western middle-class home (overnight and weekends), and spent their days at the Chimpanzee Cognition Lab, The Ohio State University. These infants experienced distal caregiving, although the two infants were always together. At both locations there were lots of toys available for the infants. They were filmed in both the indoor rooms of the lab and on the grass outside the building."

For example, the Gombe chimpanzee infants lived in the tropical rain forest, where visibility was sometimes very limited (Goodall, 1986). Infants were very small, making them\nharder to see than adults. At Gombe, although a family might have been the focus for many hours of videotaping, the infant was the main focus for only part of the session. For these reasons, we analyzed the rates of gesturing (number per 10 minutes of visible time) to compare groups given the relatively infrequent nature of infant gesturing.\nInitially, we analyzed the extent to which there were differences among the six groups in overall rates, and if the omnibus test was significant, specifying with contrasts which groups differed significantly from the others. If there were no significant differences across the groups, we investigated whether there were significant differences between species (i.e., all the human infants compared with all the chimpanzee infants). We analyzed infant-produced gestures (the main focus of the study) and also infantreceived gestures, when mothers and/or others directed a gesture to the focal infant. We also assessed whether there was any relation between them with correlations to determine if rates of infant-received were related to infantproduced gesture types.\nAfter data were collected, we analyzed one gesture (hold mutual gaze) on its own because (1) we were surprised to find that it occurred in our sample of 1-year-olds, and (2) we thought that this gesture, in particular, might differ in infants who had experienced proximal caregiving versus those that experienced distal caregiving (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021; Keller, 2007). In other words, given that this behavior occurred, we wanted to know if there were within species differences, and whether this gesture was related to any particular type of infant-produced or infant-received gesture."

A significant correlation between produced and received was found in the human-usual gesture types, rho(51) = .292, p = .038, but not in either the chimpanzee-usual gesture types, rho(51) = .129, p = .365, or the species-common gesture types, rho(51) = .009, p = .95.\nSpeciesGiven that not all infants received all types of gestures, we additionally ran analyses focusing on the number of infants receiving each type of gesture, rather than comparing rates. We considered the local gesture environment by comparing the number of infants in each group that received each type of gestures. For these analyses, however, there were too many cells with low counts to run the analysis by group (we display the counts in Tables\u00a02, 3, and 4). Therefore, we report the analyses only by species. We found a significant species difference in receiving human-usual gestures (Table\u00a02), \u03c72(1) = 25.64, p < .001: more human infants received human-usual gestures than expected, and fewer chimpanzee infants received human-usual gestures than expected. Table\u00a03 shows the number of infants that received chimpanzee-usual gestures by group. Since even in the analysis by species, the expected count for half the cells was under 5, we used a Fisher\u2019s Exact Test, which was not significant, p = .15.\nFinally, Table\u00a04 shows the number of infants in each group that received species-common gestures. There was a significant effect of species on these gestures, \u03c72(1) = 4.255, p = .04. Fewer human infants received species-common gestures than expected and more chimpanzee infants received species-common gestures than expected (Table\u00a04).\n25\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3"

            "text": "In this paper, we report infant-produced and infant-received gesturing as observed in samples of 1-year-old human and chimpanzee infants. The sample sizes were small and there were only three samples of human infants and three samples of chimpanzee infants, although there was diversity in\nsocioecological settings within each species. Nonetheless, this study represents one of the only studies to make species comparisons in gestures while also documenting within-species variation in gestures. There were some findings that were expected, such as infants with human interactants produced higher rates of human-usual gestures than groups without human interactants, and infant groups with chimpanzee interactants produced significantly higher rates of chimpanzeeusual gestures than those without chimpanzee interactants. That said, we found fewer differences than expected. There were no differences among groups or across species in the overall rate of infant-produced gesturing or in the overall rate of infant-received gesturing. There were no significant differences across groups or species in the rates of gestures common to both species, whether infant produced or received. The most unexpected finding, however, was in the species difference in the behavior of Holding Mutual Gaze. Counter to theoretically driven expectations of the importance of mutual gaze for human infants raised with distal caregiving (see discussion in Akhtar & Gernsbacher, 2008), we found that the Holding Mutual Gaze gesture was more strongly associated with chimpanzees (who displayed significantly higher rates than human infants) and chimpanzee-usual gestures (infants who displayed the hold-mutual-gaze gesture produced significantly higher rates of chimpanzee-usual gestures compared with those infants who did not display the hold-mutual-gaze gesture). Although the communicative environments differed across groups in various ways, we indexed this with infantreceived gestures. We found within-species differences in infant-received rates both of human-usual gesture types and of species-common gesture types. There was not, however, a tight association between infant-received and infant-produced gesturing. We found little correlation between the type of gestures received by infants and the type of gestures produced by infants, although we note that we only observed infants at a single age point and used only infant-received gestures as a broad index of the communicative environment.\nOur premise in beginning this study was that previous communicative interactions were vital for the emergence of communicative gestures at 1 year of age, and that this would be true for chimpanzees as well as humans. One could presume that human infants would produce significantly more gestures than do chimpanzee infants because of the species differences in adult communicative competence, or that chimpanzee infants would produce more gestures that human infants because chimpanzee do not have any other means of communication (i.e., humans have language in addition to gestures, whereas chimpanzees have only gestures for communication). As infants, however, we found no support for either of these assumptions, since 1-yearold human and chimpanzee infants did not differ in their overall rates of produced gestures. One could also presume that human infants would receive significantly more gestures\n26\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\nthan do chimpanzee infants, based on the species differences in adult communicative competence. We found no support for this assumption, as 1-year-old human and chimpanzee infants did not differ in overall rates of received gestures.\nThe lack of species differences in infant-produced gestures could be related to differential rates of communicative development (e.g., 1-year-old human infants typically develop some spoken language while they are still communicating primarily with gestures, whereas chimpanzee infants typically communicate only nonverbally). Although human infants may\nbe acquiring single words at 1 year of age, we find that in naturalistic observations their non-verbal communication rate is not different from that of chimpanzee infants. Although chimpanzee infants, given language training, may also express single words (e.g., Gardner & Gardner, 1998; Kellogg, 1968), none of our sample was language trained. We did not find an overall species difference in the rate of infant gesturing, the overall average rate was 5.9 gestures per 10 visible minutes at 1 year of age, but we do not know whether developmental trajectories of gesture rates may differ across species.\n27\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\nAn important feature of our study was that we included three categories of gestures, those that are commonly reported for human infants, those that are commonly reported for chimpanzees, and those that are commonly reported for both species. We searched for within-species differences in these three types of gesture, which we expected to find, in part, because previously, Bard et\u00a0al. (2021) found significant within species differences in the form of coordinated joint engagements, using these same naturalistic observations. Although the 1-year-olds in the Bard et\u00a0al. (2021) study engaged in triadic co-ordinations for an average of 65% of the observation time, we found that the overall rate of gesturing in our samples of 1-year-olds was low. In fact, even with multiple gestures of each type, we found that not all infants produced (or received) all types of gesture. We were unable to document significant within-species differences for most gesture types but did document some species differences in types of gesture.\nSince our study was only a \u201cpoint-in-time,\u201d we do not know how gesture rate trajectories may differ over time, nor, from this study, the processes by which gestures emerge (see Bard, Dunbar, et\u00a0al., 2014b, for discussion of the range of processes by which gestures may develop). We do know that, in general, human infants\u2019 verbal production increases, and chimpanzees fine tune their gesture repertoire from ~5 years to adulthood, using fewer but more successful gestures (Hobaiter & Byrne, 2011). Further discussion about linguistic relative to non-linguistic communication rates and how this may differ across species is beyond the scope of the present study."

            "text": "We expected to find tight associations between types of gestures that infants produce and types that they receive. We did not find a significant correlation overall between infant-produced and infant-received gesture rates and found a significant correlation in only one of the three gesture types. The rate of human-usual gestures produced by infants was significantly correlated with the rate of humanusual gestures received by infants. This finding is supported by previous studies, which show that, in humans, the frequency of human-usual gestures (especially pointing) produced by infants is positively correlated with the frequency of those received from their caregivers (Kishimoto, 2017; Liszkowski & Tomasello, 2011). The humanusual gestures are thought to be a way for infants to share attention and interest about objects with each other (Liszkowski et\u00a0al., 2004). Although it has been suggested that the experience of shared attention and interest through human-usual gestures by caregivers may facilitate the development of shared intentionality (Tomasello, 2019), we note that (1) the UK infants experienced significant lower rates of infant-received human-usual gestures than\nthe other human groups, and in fact, their rates of infantreceived human-usual gestures did not differ from any of the chimpanzee infant groups, and (2) infant chimpanzees do not differ from infant humans in the amount of coordinated shared attention (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021). We might argue instead that the presence of communicative gestures in human and chimpanzee infants, with their equivalent propensity for shared joint engagements (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021) supports a conclusion that, at 1 year of age, infants of both species are flexibly responsive to the communicative needs of their local settings. Communicative needs may differ within species, across socioecological settings (e.g., for humans: Kwon et\u00a0al., 2018; Vogt et\u00a0al., 2015; Wang & Vallotton, 2016; and for chimpanzees: Boesch, 2012; de Waal, 1982; Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al., 2020; Girard-Buttoz et\u00a0al., 2022; Mitani, 2020; Wrangham et\u00a0al., 2016), and may differ substantially later in life, across species, as we note that with fully developed language, humans, as a species, excel in communication compared with the chimpanzee species."

            "text": "One of the interesting findings of the study was that infants engage in the hold-mutual-gaze gesture already at 1 year of age, and that the chimpanzee infants had significantly higher rates of holding mutual gaze than the human infants. Although there have been several comparative studies of mutual gaze between 3-month-old infants and caregivers (which occurs in the daily life in humans: Keller, 2003; and in chimpanzees; Bard et\u00a0al., 2005), this is probably the first study to compare its occurrence in older infants between species. The fact that the rate is higher in chimpanzees compared with humans is a surprising result. It has long been believed that such communication is rare in chimpanzees and may be associated with a lack of joint attention (Tomonaga et\u00a0al., 2004), but perhaps this is associated with captive settings, more than the complex socioecologies of wild settings (e.g., collaborative hunting is found in some wild chimpanzee communities: Boesch, 2012). We know, for instance, that the frequency of 3-month mutual gaze is highly influenced by environmental factors for both chimpanzees (Bard et\u00a0al., 2005) and humans (Keller, 2007), and that triadic connectedness (the competence underlying 1-year-old\u2019s joint attention) is present at the same high levels in both human and chimpanzee infants (i.e., 65% of the time: Bard et\u00a0al., 2021). We expected that hold mutual gaze would vary with the extent of distal caregiving\u2014that is, would vary within species. This gesture, however, was significantly and positively related to the rate of chimpanzee-usual gestures, and not to the extent of human-usual gestures (see Bard et\u00a0al., 2021, for further discussion).\nThe present result could be interpreted in several ways\u2014 for example, related to the reciprocity of mutual gaze and\n28\nLearning & Behavior (2023) 51:15\u201333\n1 3\ngaze alternation, to gaze patterns that differ across socioecological settings, or to the reliance on nonverbal communication in infants. Holding gaze may be antithetical to gaze alternation, so that if more holding gaze is observed then this means there will be less gaze alternation. It may be that the strong encouragement for objects as shared topics, such as in Western middle-class settings, reduces the occurrence of mutual gaze, instead focusing on gaze alternations. However, gaze alternations are characteristic of the joint attention toward objects for both humans and chimpanzees (e.g., Bard, Bakeman, et\u00a0al., 2014a; Bates et\u00a0al., 1975; Leavens et\u00a0al., 2009), and mutual gaze can occur in 3-month-olds at similar rates for humans and chimpanzees (Bard et\u00a0al., 2005), although there is significant within species variation for both species (see Bard et\u00a0al., 2021, for discussion). To resolve this issue, we would need to assess the degree to which gaze alternations to objects is inversely related to the hold-mutual-gaze gesture in 1-year-olds.\nInfants experiencing distal caregiving (i.e., the UK human infants and the home-raised chimpanzees) are encouraged to jointly focus on objects, whereas infants experiencing more proximal caregiving (i.e., the Nso and Aka human infants, and the Gombe and PRI/Zoo chimpanzees of the current study) are encouraged to jointly focus on social activities, as well (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021). There are known cultural differences in mutual gaze that parallel cultural differences in distal versus proximal caregiving, and also parallel cultural differences in type of stimulation. In WEIRD cultures such as UK, distal parenting values lots of mutual gaze, and caregivers draw attention to the surrounding objects (so-called object stimulation), whereas in other cultural settings, such as subsistence farming or foraging communities of the Nso or Aka, respectively, caregivers stimulate infants with movement (sometimes called \u201cgymnastics\u201d: Takada, 2020) and visual attention to others (Keller, 2003, 2007; Lavelli et\u00a0al., 2019). Although mutual gaze has been documented to be more frequent in distal than proximal settings around 3 months, we are not as aware of differences in frequency of mutual gaze at 1 year of age. Blake et\u00a0al. (2003) found no increase in the coordination of gesture with eye contact in 9- to 14-month-old Japanese infants, \u201ccasting doubt upon the usefulness of eye contact as a criterion for communicative gesture . . . at least in naturalistic studies\u201d (p. 15).\nA final potential explanation for the species difference in hold mutual gaze may reside in differences in the manner of indicating (i.e., indicating the target of a communicative event). Although it may be that pointing emerges in response to the referential problem space (when individuals desire out-of-reach items but are prevented from obtaining them directly, needing a communicative partner to retrieve or deliver them: Leavens, 2021; Leavens et\u00a0al., 2005), once in the repertoire, points are very effective in\nindicating specific referents. If points are not (yet) in the repertoire, human infants can use other ways to indicate, including verbal labels and eye gaze. It is plausible that human infants are more able to use the additional methods of verbalization and pointing in addition to Hold MG, where the chimpanzee infants, without verbalizations, are only able to indicate referents with gaze. This claim, however, is undermined by the lack of a significant correlation between the rate of human-usual gestures and hold mutual gaze, and instead we found that chimpanzee-usual gestures were significantly correlated with the hold-mutual-gaze gesture. Clearly more detailed studies of mutual gaze, gaze alternations, and type of gesture across various socioecological settings are needed to explain the reasons for this finding, which we found intriguing."

            "text": "Our study suggests that the overall rate of infant-produced gestures and the overall rate of infant-received gestures do not differ among groups of human infants from diverse socioecological settings or among chimpanzee infants from diverse socioecological settings, or in fact, between the species. However, when we delve into different types of gesture, we find differences in the rates of human-usual gestures and of chimpanzee-usual gestures. We also found that there were differences in the rate of infant-received human-usual gestures. A surprising finding was that the chimpanzee infants engage in the hold-mutual-gaze gesture at a significantly higher rate than the human infants, which significantly correlated to the rate of chimpanzee-usual gestures, not humanusual gestures as might be expected from the importance of gaze that is suggested in the human developmental literature. Our study highlights the value of including a diverse range of gesture types in studies of early communication, and of comparing diverse groups of both species to aid in identifying those aspects of gestural communication which may differ within and between species.\nAcknowledgements Gestures were coded from videotaped observations provided by Heidi Keller, Barry Hewlett, Kirsty Ross, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, Anne Pusey, and Sally Boysen that were used for the study of joint attention (Bard et\u00a0al., 2021).
