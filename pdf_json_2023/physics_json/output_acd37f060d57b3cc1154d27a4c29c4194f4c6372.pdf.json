    "abstractText": "Background Lignin is an attractive alternative for producing biobased chemicals. It is the second major component of the plant cell wall and is an abundant natural source of aromatic compounds. Lignin degradation using microbial oxidative enzymes that depolymerize lignin and catabolize aromatic compounds into central metabolic intermediates is a promising strategy for lignin valorization. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity and recalcitrance of lignin severely hinder its biocatalytic conversion. In this context, examining microbial degradation systems can provide a fundamental understanding of the pathways and enzymes that are useful for lignin conversion into biotechnologically relevant compounds. Results Lignin-degrading catabolism of a novel Rhodosporidium fluviale strain LM-2 was characterized using multiomic strategies. This strain was previously isolated from a ligninolytic microbial consortium and presents a set of enzymes related to lignin depolymerization and aromatic compound catabolism. Furthermore, two catabolic routes for producing 4-vinyl guaiacol and vanillin were identified in R. fluviale LM-2. Conclusions The multi-omic analysis of R. fluviale LM-2, the first for this species, elucidated a repertoire of genes, transcripts, and secreted proteins involved in lignin degradation. This study expands the understanding of ligninolytic metabolism in a non-conventional yeast, which has the potential for future genetic manipulation. Moreover, this work unveiled critical pathways and enzymes that can be exported to other systems, including model organisms, for lignin valorization.",

This strain was previously isolated from a ligninolytic microbial consortium and presents a set of enzymes related to lignin depolymerization and aromatic compound catabolism. Furthermore, two catabolic routes for producing 4-vinyl guaiacol and vanillin were identified in R. fluviale LM-2.\nConclusions The multi-omic analysis of R. fluviale LM-2, the first for this species, elucidated a repertoire of genes, transcripts, and secreted proteins involved in lignin degradation. This study expands the understanding of ligninolytic metabolism in a non-conventional yeast, which has the potential for future genetic manipulation.

            "text": "Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant and lowcost source of fermentable sugars and building blocks for the production of biofuels and value-added chemicals, which makes it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels [1]. It is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. While cellulose and/or hemicellulose can be utilized to produce biofuels and chemicals, the use of lignin has been limited to energy supply.\nLignin is the second major component of plant cell walls, imparting structural stability to plant tissues and fibers, and forming a barrier against microbial infections [2]. It consists of phenylpropanoid monomeric guaiacyl (G), p-hydroxyphenyl (H), and syringyl (S) units randomly interconnected mainly by \u03b2-O-4 aryl ether bonds [3]. Considering that 70 million tons of lignin is extracted annually during pulping operations [4], lignin is an abundant natural source of aromatic compounds. However, lignin valorization requires efficient methods for the degradation and conversion of complex mixtures of ligninderived aromatic compounds into bioproducts. Some microorganisms have been described as being capable of bioconverting lignin into value-added compounds, such as vanillin [5], polyester precursors [6, 7], and even nylon [8], indicating their usefulness for lignin valorization.\nIn nature, lignin bioprocessing occurs through symbiotic activity, involving white-rot fungi and certain bacterial species, and consists of two steps [9, 10]: (i) lignin depolymerization and (ii) aromatic ring fission. In the first step, lignin macropolymer degraders, such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Schizophyllum commune, and Pseudomonas putida, secrete an enzymatic cocktail consisting of oxidative enzymes (e.g., laccases and peroxidases) and accessory enzymes to cleave the linkages between S, G, and H units. Laccases and class II hemedependent lignin-modifying peroxidases (e.g., lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP)) act directly on lignin and lignin fragments [1, 11]. Auxiliary enzymes such as glyoxal oxidases (GLOX) support lignin degradation by producing H2O2 [12], the main substrate for peroxidase reactions (13). In addition to secreting extracellular enzymes, certain microorganisms produce \u03b2-etherase and cytochrome P450 (CYP), which cleave \u03b2-O-4 bonds and demethylate intracellular lignin fragments, respectively [14, 15].\nIn the second step, bacteria, fungi, and yeasts assimilate aromatic compounds through funneling pathways, converting the molecules into key central metabolic intermediates or target compounds [10, 16]. Despite the diverse array of oxidized fragments originating from lignin degradation, catabolism proceeds mainly via two major compounds, protocatechuate and catechol (both of which are cleaved to form central intermediates) [9,\n16]. For instance, during the degradation of G-unit rich lignin, ferulic acid is converted into vanillin by feruloylCoA synthetase (FCS) and feruloyl-CoA hydratase-lyase (FCHL). Vanillin is then cleaved into protocatechuate (vanillin pathway), and the latter is converted into central intermediates (pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and succinate) through three different pathways, namely the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage, protocatechuate 2,3-cleavage, and \u03b2-ketoadipate pathways [10].\nAn alternative catabolic route has been described for ferulic acid bioconversion in Rhodotorula rubra [17], Candida guilliermondii [18], and Cupriavidus sp. B-8 [19]. In these microorganisms, ferulic acid is converted into 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG) using the cofactor-free enzyme phenolic acid decarboxylase (PDC) [20]. Furthermore, 4-VG can be converted to vanillin and subsequently to protocatechuate [21]. Both ferulic acid catabolism pathways have potential biotechnological applications since vanillin and 4-VG are considered value-added bioproducts, and are widely used in the food and cosmetics industries [5, 22].\nAlthough lignin degradation is mainly attributed to white-rot fungi and bacteria, oleaginous yeasts have been reported to be capable of degrading lignin and further assimilating the lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Rhodosporidium sp. can modify wheat straw and Sarkanda grass [23] and consume p-coumaric, p-hydroxybenzoic, and ferulic acids [24, 25]. Additionally, species of this genus have high tolerance toward inhibitors generated during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass [26]. Even though some model microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, have been engineered for lignin valorization [27, 28], non-model microbes have also been continually characterized to unveil novel ligninolytic pathways with biotechnological relevance. For instance, Rhodosporidium toruloides is genetically and physiologically well characterized, providing vital knowledge for further strain engineering [29].\nIn this context, a combination of omics approaches was used to determine the genetic potential and physiology of a novel Rhodosporidium fluviale strain LM-2 isolated from a lignin-degrading microbial consortium [30] (Fig.\u00a0 1). Genomic analysis revealed several genes involved in lignin degradation and aromatic catabolism, and transcriptomic and secretomic analyses elucidated the metabolism of yeast grown in lignin-containing medium. To exploit the biotechnological potential of R. fluviale for the production of compounds of interest, this novel strain was cultivated in media containing ferulic acid. Afterwards, the resulting metabolites were identified by UHPLC\u2013MS/MS to determine possible pathways for ferulic acid catabolism in this yeast. Combining these results and omics approaches, biocatalytic pathways that\nmay be useful for lignin valorization strategies were identified in this novel yeast."

For isolation of microorganisms, the culture broth from LigMet was diluted and plated on agar supplemented with LW lignin and high-molecular-weight (HW) lignin with glucose (HW + G) [30]. For the analysis described herein, the yeast strain LM-2 was selected, which was capable of growing on LW and\nHW + G plates (data not shown) and was highly tolerant to different kraft lignin concentrations (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S1).\nTo identify the LM-2, the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were sequenced, and a BLAST search was performed against the GenBank nucleotide (nonredundant) database. The analysis revealed that LM-2 shared 100% and 98% sequence identity with R. fluviale and Rhodosporidium azoricum, respectively (Table\u00a0 1), and clustered together with R. fluviale DMKU RK253 [31] based on phylogenetic tree construction using ITS regions (Additional file\u00a0 2: Fig. S2). This indicated that LM-2 was a novel R. fluviale strain and was therefore named R. fluviale LM-2.\nPhysiological tests based on cell viability at different temperatures have been used to distinguish between R.\nazoricum and R. fluviale [32, 33]. R. fluviale can grow at both 30 and 37\u00a0\u2103, whereas R. azoricum grows at 30\u00a0\u2103 [32]. LM-2 showed the same temperature tolerance at 30 and 37\u00a0\u2103 (Additional file\u00a0 3: Fig. S3), corroborating the result of species determination by phylogenetic analyses."

While class II heme peroxidases, Dyp-type peroxidases, and CYP are capable of degrading polymeric lignin [35, 36], catalases and glutathione peroxidases are responsible for controlling the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during lignin oxidation, by regulating the intracellular levels of H2O2, and thus protecting the cells under stress conditions [37].\nThese results were obtained using BLASTn search against hypervariable internal transcribed spacer ITS1/ITS2 sequences 1 Homotypic synonym: Rhodosporidiobolus fluvialis [81] 2 Homotypic synonym: Rhodosporidiobolus\u00a0azoricus [81]"

Among the CAZymes involved in lignin degradation, 57 belonged to 10 distinct auxiliary activity (AA) families. For instance, four genes previously identified as those of heme peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.14) belong to the AA2 family, 12 genes coding for aryl alcohol oxidases (AAO) belong to the AA3 family, and 10 genes coding for GLOX belong to the AA5_1 subfamily. Moreover, four AAO and nine GLOX genes were predicted to code for signal peptides, indicating that the encoded proteins may be extracellularly localized and participate in lignin degradation.\nIn addition to oxidative enzymes, the intracellular pathways for lignin and aromatic catabolism were also investigated, reconstructing metabolic pathways based on Pfam domain prediction. Among the 17,565 proteins predicted, 31 \u03b2-etherase encoding sequences (Pfam numbers: PF02798, PF00043, and PF13417) participated in intracellular lignin degradation, and 246 encoded proteins were related to aromatic catabolism (Fig.\u00a0 3). Among the predicted aromatic catabolic enzymes, two FCSs (PF13607 and PF13380), 14 FCHLs (PF00378), and two PDCs (PF05870) were identified, suggesting that R. fluviale LM-2 is potentially capable of catabolizing ferulic acid by two distinct pathways, named here as ferulic\nacid pathways I (via vanillin) and II (via 4-vinyl guaiacol) (Additional file\u00a0 5: Fig. S5). Moreover, the identification of enzymes involved in protocatechuate 4,5 and protocatechuate 2,3-cleavage pathways and the \u03b2-ketoadipate pathway indicated that protocatechuate produced from the vanillin pathway can be converted to central intermediates through these three different pathways (protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage, protocatechuate 2,3-cleavage and \u03b2-ketoadipate pathways)."

Transcriptomic data contained an average of 25 million and 17 million reads for replicates with kraft lignincontaining medium and glucose control, respectively. RNA-seq analysis identified 15,986 distinct transcripts, of which 3618 were differentially expressed during cultivation on lignin-containing medium (p \u2264 0.05), including 1657 upregulated (Log2 fold change \u2265 1) and 1961 downregulated (Log2 fold change \u2264 1) transcripts (Additional file\u00a06: Fig. S6). The Log2 fold change ranged from 8.5 to \u2212\u00a09.1, and the top ten upregulated and downregulated genes by fold change are listed in Additional file\u00a09: Table\u00a0S3. The top ten upregulated genes consisted mainly of hypothetical proteins and dehydrin, which is a stress\nresponse protein (DHN family protein). On the other hand, the top ten downregulated genes included sugar transporters and proteins identified from the expansin family which include cell wall modification proteins [38]. Table\u00a0 3 summarizes the upregulated genes encoding enzymes related to lignin depolymerization, including heme peroxidases (AA2), \u03b2-etherase, and CYP. No upregulated genes related to ferulic acid pathway II or\nRNA sequence results were obtained after cell culture in kraft lignin-containing medium. Padj is the adjusted p value (\u2265 0.05)\nprotocatechuate 2,3-cleavage pathway were identified under the conditions analyzed. Therefore, under the analyzed conditions, the transcriptomic analyses indicated that R. fluviale LM-2 catabolizes ferulic acid preferentially through ferulic acid pathway I, followed by the vanillin, protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage, and \u03b2-ketoadipate pathways (Fig.\u00a04). A finding that has indirect implications for lignin degradation, is that the stress response enzyme catalase (Table\u00a0 3) and 45 genes of 229 major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters predicted in the R. fluviale LM-2 genome (Additional file\u00a08: Table\u00a0S2) were also upregulated during cultivation on lignin-containing medium.\nTo identify secreted proteins related to lignin degradation, R. fluviale LM-2 cells were cultivated in lignin-containing medium. After 24\u00a0 h, supernatant was collected for mass spectrometry and data processing. Sixty-one protein matches were identified (Table\u00a04), with 271 unique peptides. Among these protein matches, 21 (34%) were identified as hypothetical proteins, 10 (16%) as CAZymes (coding for GT71 family, GH23 family, GH128 family, AA5_1 subfamily, and carbohydratebinding molecules-CBM), 3 (5%) as ligninolytic enzymes (GLOX\u2014AA5_1 and CYP) (Fig.\u00a05), and 45 (74%) as signal peptides (Table\u00a04). With regard to ligninolytic enzymes, two protein matches for the auxiliary activity enzyme\nGLOX \u2013 AA5_1 (with a signal peptide) and one protein match for CYP (without a signal peptide) were identified. Although R. fluviale LM-2 contains genes related to lignin-modifying peroxidases (AA2), none of these enzymes were detected in the secretome.\nCollectively, gene expression and production of ligninolytic enzymes analysis confirmed that R. fluviale LM-2 can carry out the first and second steps of the lignin degradation, producing H2O2, which is the substrate of peroxidases and several enzymes involved in the conversion of phenolic compounds into central metabolic intermediates."

            "text": "To our knowledge, the genomic analysis of R. fluviale LM-2 in this study is the first one for this species, and as with other species from this genus, R. fluviale is capable of accumulating lipids (up to 50\u201370% of their dry weight) [41] and of tolerating inhibitory compounds [42]. For example, R. fluviale DMKU-RK253, which was isolated after enrichment of sugarcane leaf samples [41], accumulated high lipid levels after cultivation in glycerol containing medium [31]. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that R. fluviale LM-2 harbors a relatively large genome (50\u00a0 Mb), with a larger set of predicted protein-coding genes (17,565) than R. toruloides (20.2\u00a0 Mb, containing 8171 protein-coding genes) [43]. Genome size variation is a typical adaptive response in fungi to adapt to a specific habitat or ecological niche and involves genome duplication and translocation [44]. For instance, the genome of Phanerochaete carnosa shows a tandem duplication of ligninolytic genes compared to P. chrysosporium [45]. Furthermore, duplication of these genes could confer competitive advantage to ligninolytic organisms in nature, compared to other organisms that have less tolerance to the toxicity of aromatic compounds [46]. The large size of R. fluviale LM-2 genome was also observed based on de novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity, which was about 44\u00a0Mb with a completeness of 80%.\nMulti-omic analysis of R. fluviale LM-2 elucidated a repertoire of genes, transcripts, and secreted proteins involved in lignin degradation, as well as the ability to convert lignin-derived aromatics into vanillin and 4-VG. R. fluviale LM-2 expresses heme peroxidases (AA2), \u03b2-etherases, and CYPs for lignin depolymerization, as well as several enzymes with a Pfam domain related to aromatic degradation. In contrast to the Rhodotorula sp. R2 [23], which secretes enzymes that act directly on lignin macromolecules, the AA2 enzyme from R. fluviale LM-2 was not secreted under the conditions analyzed. However, R. fluviale LM-2 appears to perform the first step of lignin degradation by secreting GLOX\u2014AA5_1.\nAlthough aromatic compound metabolism by yeast is an uncommon phenotype, for example, S. cerevisiae INVSc1 Invitrogen\u2122 uptakes low levels of mono-aryl compounds for further metabolism [47], oleaginous yeasts such as R. fluviale LM-2 have been extensively studied in this context since the products of aromatic metabolism (acetylCoA and pyruvate) are fatty acid biosynthesis precursors. For instance, Yaguchi and collaborators (2020) screened 36 yeast strains cultivated with several aromatic compounds, in which each species presented a unique metabolism and tolerance profile to these compounds [48]. Additionally, it is important to mention that the work described here focused on the secreted enzymes for lignin depolymerization. However, the whole proteomic analysis would also be helpful to improve the coverage of lignin-inducible genes in this yeast.\nCollectively, the data indicated that during lignin catabolism, genes involved in stress response were upregulated in R. fluviale LM-2, probably in response to the toxicity of aromatic compounds. For example, enzymes responsible for controlling intracellular ROS production, such as catalases, were overexpressed in the presence of lignin. In addition, DNH was also overexpressed under the conditions analyzed. DHN has been characterized as a stress enzyme in plants, and is involved in membrane protection, cryoprotection of enzymes, and protection from reactive oxygen species [49, 50]. Beyond its demethylation role, CYP is also an essential component of the stress response system [51] and could therefore play a role in the adaptation of R. fluviale LM-2 to support ligninolytic pathways.\nAmong the transporters, MSF was upregulated in response to growth in lignin-containing medium, indicating its importance in lignin catabolism in R. fluviale LM-2. Members of this superfamily transport various small compounds, including aromatic compounds, across biological membranes [52]. Moreover, the overexpression of this transporter has been described as crucial for increasing protocatechuate conversion in Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 [53].\nThe biocatalytic conversion of ferulic acid can be useful for the production of desired chemicals [46, 54, 55]. Ferulic acid is usually converted to vanillin by FCS and FCHL with ATP consumption in two steps [56, 57]: (i) CoA-thioesterification of ferulic acid by FCS, and (ii) hydration of feruloyl-CoA by FCHL. The alternative catabolic route of ferulic acid through the 4-VG pathway is a detoxification process involving non-oxidative decarboxylation driven by the cofactor-free enzyme PDC [20]. Sequences coding a FCS, a FCHL, and a PDC were identified in the R. fluviale LM-2 genome based on Pfam domain analyses. This finding and the detection of vanillin and 4-VG after cultivation with ferulic\nacid indicated that these two ferulic acid catabolic pathways are functional in R. fluviale LM-2. Furthermore, similar to R. toruloides IFO0880 [24], R. fluviale LM-2 consumed all the ferulic acid added to the culture media before 24\u00a0h of growth."

            "text": "The present study shows that R. fluviale LM-2 possesses a wide spectrum of enzymes involved in lignin and phenylpropanoid degradation, which can be useful for lignin valorization strategies. Therefore, these results suggest that R. fluviale LM-2 could not only be classified as a ligninolytic yeast, but also as a degrader of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic pollutants. In summary, the omics-based characterization of R. fluviale LM-2 opens new opportunities for biotechnological applications of this yeast. The availability of genomic data can support the genetic manipulation of this yeast and the development of lignin valorization strategies. In addition, this work uncovered functional ligninolytic pathways and novel genes, including FCS, FCHL, and PDC enzymes, that can be exported to other systems, such as model organisms, in biotechnology for the production of biofuels and bioproducts."
