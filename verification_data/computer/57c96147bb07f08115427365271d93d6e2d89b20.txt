"Future work will focus on extending our method to handle more complex urban environments with higher levels of occlusion and dynamic objects. Additionally, we plan to explore the integration of temporal information from sequential images to further improve localization accuracy and robustness. Another direction is to investigate the use of alternative satellite imagery sources and the potential for real-time updating of satellite maps to reflect current environmental conditions."
