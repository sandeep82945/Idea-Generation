    "abstractText": "Flexible mechanical sensors based on nanomaterials operate on a deformation-response mechanism, making it challenging to discern different types of mechanical stimuli such as pressure and strain. Therefore, these sensors are susceptible to significant mechanical interference. Here, we introduce a multifunctional flexible sensor capable of discriminating coupled pressure and strain without cross-interference. Our design involves an elastic cantilever fixed on the pillar of the flexible main substrate, creating a three-dimensional (3D) substrate, and two percolative nanoparticle (NP) arrays are deposited on the cantilever and main substrate, respectively, as the sensing materials. The 3D flexible substrate could confine pressure/strain loading exclusively on the cantilever or main substrate, resulting in independent responses of the two nanoparticle arrays with no crossinterference. Benefitting from the quantum transport in nanoparticle arrays, our sensors demonstrate an exceptional sensitivity, enabling discrimination of subtle strains down to 1.34 \u00d7 10\u22124. Furthermore, the suspended cantilever with one movable end can enhance the pressure perception of the NP array, exhibiting a high sensitivity of \u22120.223 kPa\u22121 and an ultrahigh resolution of 4.24 Pa. This flexible sensor with multifunctional design will provide inspiration for the development of flexible mechanical sensors and the advancement of decoupling strategies.",

            "text": "Mechanical flexible sensors can be integrated into micromechanical electronic systems (MEMS) [1\u20133], enabling them to detect mechanical stimuli including strain [4], pressure [5], force [6], and vibration [7]. These sensors, which are considered as the essential building blocks for the future generation of intelligent systems, are currently widely applied in the automotive industry, health care technology, and clinical medicine, due to the advantages of flexibility, portability, and lightweight [6,8]. Consequently, there has been a significant surge of interest among researchers toward the development of flexible mechanical sensors with high performance in recent years. Most flexible mechanical sensors are composed of elastic substrates and conducting sensing nanomaterials [9\u201313]. For example, Lee et al. prepared porous nanofibrous thin layers of carbon nanotubes, graphene and fluorinated copolymer by electrospinning [14]. The numerous internal pores inside the materials can be compressed by normal pressure to enhance the intercontact of the conducting nanomaterials, thus enabling the sensing materials to detect tiny pressure loads with an ultrahigh change factor over 1 \u00d7 106. In another study, Liu et al. fabricated piezoresistive composite films by incorporating silver nanowires into an ethylene-co-vinyl acetate matrix through solvodynamic printing [15]. These sensing materials demonstrated the ability to detect pressures as low as 12.9 Pa, with\nSensors 2023, 23, 5956. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23135956 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 5956 2 of 12\nthe highest sensitivity recorded at 41.8 kPa\u22121. Boland et al. added graphene nanosheets to a cross-linked polysilicone, and found these conductive nanocomposites are sensitive electromechanical sensors with gauge factors >500 that can measure even the impact associated with the footsteps of a small spider [13]. It is easy to find that these mechanical sensing materials all seem to follow a common response mechanism. That is, when mechanical stimuli are applied to these sensors, the sensing materials undergo deformation, causing a change in the conductivity of the internal conducting networks. As a result, the internal resistance or capacitance of the sensing materials change with mechanical stimuli loading [9,10,12,13]. However, according to this operating mechanism, these mechanical sensors may exhibit a similar response to various kinds of mechanical stimuli, making it difficult to discern the type of mechanical stimuli accurately [14,16]. For example, the porous nanofibrous pressure sensors introduced above are still difficult to be completely insensitive to bending [14], and the piezoresistive composite films are also sensitive to strain [15]. Therefore, unless applied in situations only involving one specific type of mechanical stimuli, current mechanical flexible sensors suffer from cross-interference from other mechanical stimuli when applied in complex scenarios. It is still challenging to design flexible sensors based on conductive nanomaterials with the capability of distinguishing complex mechanical stimuli with high performance [17]. Recently, some conducting nanoparticles (NPs) are assembled as percolative dense arrays to construct flexible sensing materials [18,19]. In these NP arrays, the electronic transport involving tunneling and hopping, is sensitive to the deformation of the sensing array, resulting in NP array-based sensors with the capability of detecting mechanical stimuli with ultrahigh sensitivities and resolutions as well as ultralow power consumption [20,21]. It is worth noting that the properties of sensors could be tailored by adjusting the size of particles, the array coverage, the deposition position, and even the geometric dimension of substrates. The high-level designability of NP array-based sensing materials opens up great possibilities for fabricating multifunctional flexible sensors capable of discriminating the coupled mechanical stimuli [22]. However, the question of how to transform the highlevel designability of NP arrays into flexible sensors that can discern pressure and strain simultaneously without interference still has to be investigated. In fact, some three-dimensional (3D) elastic cantilever structures have been applied to develop many kinds of sensors with excellent sensing performance [23\u201325]. In addition, the 3D sensing structures can break through the dimensional limitations of traditional planar designs by confining the effects of different stimuli to different planes. Hence, we present a multifunctional flexible sensor to differentiate the in situ coupled pressure and strain. This 3D flexible sensors involves an elastic cantilever fixed on the pillar of the flexible main substrate, and two percolative nanoparticle (NP) arrays deposited on the cantilever and main substrate, respectively. Based on this specific sensing structure, the external pressure is loaded on the cantilever and the internal strain occurs on the main substrate, so that the cross-interference that the current mechanical sensors are susceptible to could be eliminated sufficiently. The sensor demonstrates excellent sensing characteristics for both pressure and strain. In particular, when responding to pressure, the sensor presented an impressive performance with ultrahigh sensitivity and minimal hysteresis, because of the mechanical sensing cantilever with only one end fixed and the other end free to move. This advantageous design allows the movable end to easily undergo buckling [26], as it primarily overcomes a bending resistance rather than an elastic resistance [27], to minimize the occurrence of significant plastic deformation on the cantilever [28]. This multifunctional mechanical sensor, which can sense pressure and strain simultaneously, is expected to find wide applications in accurately detecting complex stimuli."

PET\nSensors 2023, 23, 5956 3 of 12\ncantilevers of varied thicknesses and excellent quality were procured straight from the market, while the PDMS main substrates were produced by pouring a 10:1 mixture of elastomer of Sylgard 184, Dow Corning into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mold with a square hole and curing. Thus, we could obtain a PDMS substrate with a 6 mm high pillar after peering off. We used silver (Ag) fuel with high conductivity to print electrodes. The shadow-mask evaporation was employed to print two silver interdigital electrodes (IDEs) with separations of 100 \u00b5m on the upper surface of PET and the lower surface of PDMS [29]. Figure 1a shows the structure of our NP array-based multifunctional sensor. Numerous metals, including gold (Au), tin (Sn), and zinc (Zn), could be used to create NP arrays. In this paper, palladium (Pd) was used to create NP arrays because of its exceptional chemical stability [30]. The Pd NP arrays were generated from the gas aggregation source and deposited into the IDEs on both substrates [20,31], to fabricate the sensing elements (SEs) on the PET and PDMS. The schematic of the NPs deposition system is shown in Figure 1b. The conductance evolution of assembled NP arrays could be monitored during deposition to control the percolation of NP arrays. Inset of Figure 1b depicts a typical nanoparticle deposition percolation curve. It is unable to detect any conductance of NP arrays at this early stage of the deposition, because the particles in IDEs are still too less to establish a conducting pathway. With continued deposition, the nanoparticles are enough to form the least conducting pathways which could be discerned by our instrument, thus forming a percolative threshold in the evolution curve. As more nanoparticles reach the surface, the complex pathways are interconnected into a network structure, and the conductance rises rapidly until we stop depositing when the conductance of the NP array exceeds 0.5 \u00b5S. In fact, the continuous deposition leads subsequent NPs to fill the insulating separation in the NP arrays, resulting in a gradual transformation of electronic transport from quantized tunneling/hopping to the classical flowing, which may degrade the sensitivities of the sensing elements to mechanical stimuli. Controlling the amount of NP deposition to ensure the quantized transport domaining the transport behavior in NP arrays, is much significant for the performance guarantee of the sensors [20]. We purchased silver particles and palladium target materials with a purity of 99.99% to vapor-deposit IDEs and deposit NP arrays, respectively."

Benefitting from quantum transport in nanoparticle arrays and the special mechanical structure, our sensor demonstrates superior sensing capabilities compared to other devices. Particularly, when subjected to pressure loading, the cantilever efficiently transfers the applied pressure to surface deformation, resulting in a higher sensitivity compared to other pressure-sensitive designs. Notably, the 3D composited sensing design, as demonstrated in Figure 8, offers interference-free properties, providing valuable inspiration for the development of other flexible sensing devices which are susceptible to mechanical cross-interference easily.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5956 10 of 12"

            "text": "In this study, we achieved to develop a multifunctional flexible sensor which can discriminate correlative pressure and strain simultaneously. The sensor employs percolative NP arrays as the essential SEs and arranges them on the cantilever and main substrate of the 3D flexible substrate, respectively. Leveraging the high sensitivity response of the NP arrays to stimuli, our sensor exhibited a pressure sensitivity of \u22120.223 kPa\u22121 on the cantilever SE, with a pressure resolution of 4.24 Pa. When subjected to applied strain, within the test range the maximum GF value for the SE is 387.63, so that it can determine the strain as tiny as 1.34 \u00d7 10\u22124. Moreover, we also found that in NP arrays, there is almost no mechanical interaction among dispersive NPs, thus the SEs have little contribution or affection on the mechanical properties of sensor and even could decrease the hysteresis as much as possible during operation. The remarkable capabilities of our sensor can contribute to the development of intelligent and flexible devices, as well as advanced interaction methods.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.Y. and X.Y.; methodology, P.T.; software, X.L.; validation, X.L. and X.Y.; formal analysis, L.Y.; data curation, X.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.Y., X.L., P.T., X.Y. and M.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.C. and L.Y.
