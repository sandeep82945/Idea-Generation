    "abstractText": "Aims To examine whether all-cause mortality is independently associated with serum bicarbonate concentration below the laboratory reference interval in a representative, well-characterised community-based cohort of people with type 2 diabetes. Methods 1478 FDS2 participants with type 2 diabetes (mean age 65.8 years, 51.6% males, median diabetes duration 9.0 years) from the longitudinal, observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2) were followed from study entry to death or end-2016. Independent associates of a low baseline serum bicarbonate (< 22 mmol/L) were determined using multiple logistic regression. The role of important covariates in influencing the association between bicarbonate and mortality was assessed by a stepwise Cox regression approach. Results A low serum bicarbonate was associated with increased all-cause mortality in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 (95% confidence limits (CL) 1.39, 2.60 per mmol/L). Mortality remained significantly associated with low serum bicarbonate (HR 1.40 (95% CL 1.01, 1.94) per mmol/L) in a Cox regression model with adjustment for factors associated with mortality but not low serum bicarbonate, but inclusion of estimated glomerular filtration rate categories rendered the association non-significant (HR 1.16 (95% CL 0.83, 1.63) per mmol/L). Conclusions A low serum bicarbonate is not an independent prognostic marker in people with type 2 diabetes but it may be a manifestation of the pathway between the development of impaired renal function and death.",

            "text": "The serum bicarbonate concentration is a commonly measured surrogate marker of acid\u2013base status in hospitalised and community-based patients. It is well recognised that both metabolic and respiratory acid\u2013base derangements can affect the serum bicarbonate concentration and this complicates its clinical interpretation. Nevertheless, recent studies have identified serum bicarbonate as a marker of mortality risk that is independent of other predictive variables. There is evidence that a low serum bicarbonate concentration is\nindependently associated with all-cause mortality in representative community-based individuals [1\u20134] regardless of whether the cause is a metabolic acidosis or compensated respiratory alkalosis [3]. In the case of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or hypertension, a low serum bicarbonate was an independent risk factor for mortality in some [5\u20137] but not all [8\u201310] studies.\nWhether a low serum bicarbonate is an independent mortality risk factor among people with type 2 diabetes is uncertain. Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of CKD [11] and pulmonary dysfunction [12, 13], and relatively frequent use of diuretic and anti-hypertensive medications [14], factors that can have a complex influence on acid\u2013base status. While most studies in the general population and in people with CKD suggest a significant link between a low serum bicarbonate and death [1\u20137], there is no such independent association in people with diabetic nephropathy [15], type 2 diabetes and CKD [6], or diabetes from the community [16], even if a positive association was Managed By Antonio Secchi. * Timothy M.

The aim of the present study was, therefore, to examine whether all-cause mortality is independently associated with serum bicarbonate concentration below the reference interval in a representative, well-characterised cohort of people with type 2 diabetes from the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2). We also aimed to determine whether there are covariates of serum bicarbonate that modulate its relationship with mortality and help explain inconsistencies between previous published studies."

A body shape index (ABSI) was calculated as a more robust index of visceral obesity as a predictor of death [19]. Micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes at study entry were identified using standard criteria [17, 20], including distal symmetric polyneuropathy (a score of > 2/8 on the clinical portion of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument [21]), retinopathy from graded fundus photographs, nephropathy (first-morning\nurinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 3.0\u00a0mg/mmol), renal impairment by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [22], coronary heart disease (CHD) (self-reported history of myocardial infarction, angina and/or revascularisation, or prior hospitalisations for these events), cerebrovascular disease (self-reported stroke/transient ischaemic attack or prior hospitalisations for these events) and peripheral arterial disease (ankle:brachial index \u2264 0.90 on either leg or diabetes-related amputation). The Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated as a measure of chronic disease effects after excluding diabetes and diabetes-related conditions [23].\nThe Hospital Morbidity Data Collection (HMDC) contains information regarding all public/private hospitalisations in WA since 1970 while the Death Registrations contains information on all deaths in WA [24].

However, this association was non-significant in fully adjusted models that included impaired renal function. These observations suggest that a low serum bicarbonate may a manifestation of the causal pathway between renal impairment and death, but that it is not an independent risk factor for mortality in type 2 diabetes.\nThere appears to be a distinction between the consistent finding that a low serum bicarbonate is associated with the risk of death in representative general population samples after adjustment for relevant covariates including eGFR [1\u20134] and the inconsistent but largely negative results in studies of people with CKD [5\u20138, 10] or diabetes [1, 6, 16]. In the present study, we developed models which adjusted for increasing numbers of clinically relevant covariates and, in accord with post hoc analyses of two large two angiotensin II receptor blocking agent trials in people with diabetic nephropathy [15], found that eGFR abrogated the relationship between serum bicarbonate and death.\nA possible explanation for these different observations is that, in people from the general population who do not have CKD or diabetes, a chronic low grade metabolic acidosis, for which a low serum bicarbonate is a surrogate, has pathophysiological consequences including accelerated renal damage [26], protein catabolism [27], systemic inflammation [28] and activation of the renin-angiotensin system [29]. These effects are amplified and swamped by the dominant adverse metabolic consequences of CKD, which is also associated with exacerbation of major conventional\ncardiovascular disease risk factors including hypertension and dyslipidaemia [30]. This is likely to be the case in diabetes as well, although there is some evidence that that a low serum bicarbonate in an individual with diabetes is not as strongly associated with kidney disease progression and mortality as in people with CKD but without diabetes [31]. Nevertheless, there was an independent graded positive association between baseline eGFR and a low serum bicarbonate in our participants even if the cross-sectional nature of the analysis does not allow distinguishing cause from consequence.\nThere were other significant independent associates of a serum bicarbonate < 22\u00a0mmol/L in the present study. The association with a younger age at diagnosis likely reflects the effect of accelerated cellular ageing in diabetes [32] which could exacerbate the age-related increase in the serum bicarbonate [33]. The inverse association between insulin therapy and a low serum bicarbonate can be explained by its known effect of inhibiting adipocyte lipolysis and thereby reducing serum free fatty acid and ketoacid concentrations [34]. Evidence from in\u00a0vitro to in\u00a0vivo studies suggests that acidosis may cause decreased cardiomyocyte contractility and a reflex increased heart rate [35\u201337], consistent with the positive association between low serum bicarbonate and heart rate in the present and previous [1, 16] studies. An increase in heart rate is also a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death in general populations studies, as demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis showing an increase in risk for\nTable 1 (continued) Serum bicarbonate (mmol/L) < 22 \u2265 22 P-value\nPeripheral arterial disease (%) 26.8 22.3 0.227 Coronary heart disease (%) 40.5 28.0 0.002 Cerebrovascular disease (%) 13.9 7.9 0.015 Charlson Comorbidity Index (%): < 0.001 \u00a00 62.0 76.4 \u00a01\u20132 22.2 16.7 \u00a0\u2265 3 15.8 6.9\nTable 2 Multiple logistic regression model of independent associates of baseline serum bicarbonate < 22\u00a0mmol/L in participants with type 2 diabetes (N = 1478).

An association between serum potassium and a low serum bicarbonate is well recognised, including in older people with renal impairment [39], as is an inverse association between serum HDL-cholesterol and a low serum bicarbonate [9] and between CHD and a low serum bicarbonate [16].\nOur study had some limitations. We used the serum bicarbonate as a surrogate measure of metabolic acidosis even though respiratory alkalosis is a possible cause of low bicarbonate. In common with most relevant studies to date, we did not have measures of blood pH or pCO2 so cannot make the distinction between these states but our results with respect to associations of a low serum bicarbonate with factor such as renal impairment, hyperkalaemia and increased heart rate are consistent with the published evidence. We did not have enough incident cases of CHD or incident heart failure to make meaningful analyses of the relationship between bicarbonate and these outcomes. On the other hand, the present study is one of few of the association of bicarbonate and mortality to be carried out in a representative community-based cohort of people with type 2 diabetes, with extensive clinical and biochemical characterisation of the participants. Model adjustment utilised the most parsimonious approach, thus reducing the risk of over-adjustment.\nThe clinical implications of our findings are that a low serum bicarbonate, measured as part of routine care, is a crude mortality risk factor that may indicate need for intensified cardiometabolic management in people with type 2 diabetes. In most, similar information will be obtained from the eGFR as calculated from serum creatinine measurement. However, in some groups of people, particularly frail elderly patients and those who have suffered significant limb amputations in whom eGFR may be overestimated by serum creatinine, a serum bicarbonate may be complementary or even better marker of mortality risk.\nIn conclusion, in our community-based cohort of people with type 2 diabetes, a serum bicarbonate below the laboratory reference interval was bivariately significantly associated with all-cause mortality, but adjustment for important confounders including renal dysfunction abrogated this association. Our results are consistent with serum bicarbonate being one manifestation of the pathway from impaired renal function to death in people with type 2 diabetes. A low serum bicarbonate in a patient being cared for in the community may be a valid marker of increased risk of death, especially in patients with complications of advanced diabetes such as sarcopenia or amputation in whom the calculated eGFR may be less reliable.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to FDS2 participants and FDS staff for help with collecting and recording clinical information.
