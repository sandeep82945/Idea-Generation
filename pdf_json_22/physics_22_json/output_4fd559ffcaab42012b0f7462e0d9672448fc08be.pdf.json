            "text": "Multispectral spaceborne instruments are of great interest for Earth observation: they provide ground coverage and generate high-value scientific data. However, they require bulky optical systems designed for a specific scientific goal. For monitoring purposes in the thermal infrared (IR) domain, dual-band instruments are often sufficient,1,2 provided that their revisit time is less than two days. This is achievable using constellations of small satellites, which sets the need for compact dual-band infrared imagers. We consider two infrared wavebands, defined by the atmospheric IR windows: the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) from 3 to 5 \u00b5m and the long-wave infrared (LWIR) from 8 to 12 \u00b5m. The MWIR band is often shortened (4.4\u20135 \u00b5m) to avoid solar albedo contributions.\nRefractive systems are rendered more compact when combined with extremely thin diffractive lenses. In addition, these diffractive optical elements (DOEs) very well compensate for the chromatic and thermal defocuses of refractive lenses. However, conventional monolayer DOEs cannot be used for dual-band IR applications since they can only operate within a narrow spectral band. The promising solution studied in this paper consists of an extended dual-band DOE called multilayer diffractive optical element (MLDOE). This optical component has been intensively studied since 1997.3 The extended scalar theory (EST), introduced by Swanson4 and recently applied to MLDOEs5 combines the grating equation and Snell\u2019s law to optimize the profile of a DOE (reducing the shadowing effect). Finally, FDTD and Fourier optics have been combined to accurately estimate MLDOE\u2019s optical performance at the focal plane.6\nIn this article, we explain how to retrieve an MLDOE performance and how to optimize its shape using the EST (Sec. 2). Since MLDOEs are complex diffractive elements, we describe a process to accurately retrieve the optical performance at the focal plane. This procedure combines an FDTD-based phase model (Section 3.1) with Fourier optics (Section 3.2). An MLDOE\u2019s optical performance is computed at its \u201dbest\u201d focal plane and evaluated over the MWIR-LWIR wavebands using the Strehl ratio metric. As a result, an MLDOE with optimized profile design is tested in both bands and compared to a classical ZnS 4 DOE.\nFurther author information: (Send correspondence to Victor Laborde) Victor Laborde: E-mail: victor.laborde@uliege.be Loicq Je\u0301ro\u0302me: E-mail: J.J.D.Loicq@tudelft.nl\nSpace Telescopes and Instrumentation 2022: Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave, edited by Laura E.

            "text": "An MLDOE is composed of two harmonic diffractive optical elements (HDOEs)7,8 (Fig. 1), joined together by an optical material or separated by air. These HDOEs are made of different materials, and their groove heights are designed to provide constructive interference for two distinct wavelengths, called \u201ddesign wavelengths\u201d and denoted \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. Both layers are aligned and have the same groove periods (i.e., the same number of diffractive zones). As an example, a three-layer MLDOE made of IRG24-IRG27-AgCl is depicted in Fig. 1:\nThis section describes the extended scalar theory (EST), introduced by Swanson,4 and its application to MLDOEs.5 By combining Snell\u2019s law of refraction and the grating equation, the EST method provides optimal thickness for each diffractive groove, which reduces the shadowing effect (unwanted shielding of light by the grooves).\nFollowing this reasoning, alternative MLDOE layer thickness equations has been proposed.5 They are based on the layout depicted in Fig. 2.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12180 121805Q-2 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 15 Sep 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nFollowing Fig. 2 layout, we define n1, ng and n2 the refractive indices of layer 1, the gap and layer 2, respectively. The period size Tm varies for each zone m according to.\n9 \u03b11 = H1/Tm and \u03b12 = H2/Tm, with H1 and H2 the initial microstructure heights of layer 1 and 2. H1 and H2 are initially computed using the thin element approximation (TEA) as described in:5,6 H1 = \u03bb2A(\u03bb1)\u2212 \u03bb1A(\u03bb2) B(\u03bb1)A(\u03bb2)\u2212B(\u03bb2)A(\u03bb1) H2 = \u03bb1B(\u03bb2)\u2212 \u03bb2B(\u03bb1)\nB(\u03bb1)A(\u03bb2)\u2212B(\u03bb2)A(\u03bb1)\n(1)\nwhere A(\u03bb) = n2(\u03bb)\u2212 ng(\u03bb) and B(\u03bb) = n1(\u03bb)\u2212 ng(\u03bb). The wavelengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the MLDOE design wavelengths, defined in two distinct wavebands. The EST height calculation for the first layer is detailed in the following.\nSnell\u2019s law of refraction is applied to the first layer:\nn1 sin (\u03b8i + \u03b11) = ng sin (\u03b8r1 + \u03b11) (2)\n\u03b8i and \u03b8r1 are respectively the incident and refracted angles. The grating equation, applied to the first layer at local period Tm, wavelength \u03bb and diffractive order p1, gives:\nng(\u03bb) sin \u03b8d1 \u2212 n1(\u03bb) sin \u03b8i = p1\u03bb\nTm (3)\nfor a particular wavelength \u03bb = \u03bbopt and order p1, we can equate the refractive and diffractive deviation angles (\u03b8d1 = \u03b8r1) in Eq. 3. It results in a single layer height value, H EST 1 (Tm), for each zone m of layer 1:\nHEST1 (Tm) = p1\u03bbopt\nn1 cos \u03b8i \u2212 \u221a n2g \u2212 ( p1\u03bbopt Tm + n1 sin \u03b8i )2 (4) the MLDOE layer height depends on the chosen \u201doptimization\u201d wavelength \u03bbopt and the chosen operating order p1. Refractive indices in Eq. 4 are defined at \u03bbopt. The second layer EST height H EST 2 (Tm) follows a similar calculation, detailed in:5\nHEST2 (Tm) = p2\u03bbopt\u221a\nn22 \u2212 ( (p1 + p2)\u03bbopt\nTm + n1 sin \u03b8i\n)2 \u2212 \u221a n2g \u2212 ( p1\u03bbopt Tm + n1 sin \u03b8i )2 (5) where p2 corresponds to the operating diffractive order of layer 2. Since this paper focuses on the on-axis MLDOE design and performance, we assume \u03b8i = 0\u00b0 in the following. Each MLDOE diffractive zone m will have a unique thickness HEST (Tm). Eq. 5 supposes that p1 + p2 = 1, which is imposed in this whole paper to ensure that the studied MLDOE designs are converging (first order). The diffractive orders p1 and p2 are expressed in,\n5 based on the harmonic diffractive optical elements (HDOEs) theory:7,8  p1 = H1 \u03bbopt [n1(\u03bbopt)\u2212 ng(\u03bbopt)] p2 = H2 \u03bbopt [n2(\u03bbopt)\u2212 ng(\u03bbopt)]\n\u21d2 p1 + p2 = 1\n(6)\nthe relation p1 + p2 = 1 is ensured using the TEA heights definition of Eq. 1.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12180 121805Q-3 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 15 Sep 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

In the whole article, we use the Strehl ratio at the \u201dbest\u201d focal plane as the main MLDOE optical performance metric. This simulation process has been introduced in6 and is depicted in Fig. 3:\nThe Strehl ratio retrieval procedure depicted in Fig. 3 combines near-field modeling (step 1) and free-space optical propagation (step 2). The former is detailed in Section 3.1 and involves a rigorous vectorial electromagnetic approach (FDTD). The optical propagation in free-space is described in Section 3.2 and revolves around Fourier optics, specifically the angular spectrum of plane waves. The procedure depicted in Fig. 3 takes an MLDOE design as input (i.e. the periods Tm and thicknesses H\nEST Tm for any zone m) and is purely monochromatic. The loop, displayed in gray, allows to precisely determine the \u201dbest\u201d focal plane f(\u03bb).\nThe focal plane of an MLDOE is theoretically given by the following law, whose expression is the same as for standard DOEs:9\nfj(\u03bb) = D F/\u266f\nj\u03bb (7)\nwhere j is the diffractive order (j = 1 is considered in this paper).\nHowever, since this law has been demonstrated using the TEA, it might be inaccurate for thick MLDOEs. Consequently, the \u201dbest\u201d focal plane is considered unknown in this paper. Concentrating on the loop, displayed in gray in Fig. 3, each optical propagation to any plane z > 0 leads to a Strehl ratio. Therefore, the \u201dbest\u201d focal plane f(\u03bb) is defined as the plane with the highest Strehl ratio output and is determined iteratively."

            "text": "This section details how Fourier optics propagation (Fig. 3 step 2: AS) is performed in this paper. Analysis using the Fourier transform formalism is a powerful optical modeling tool introduced and widely popularized by Goodman.11 It provides a straightforward method for evaluating, in any point in space, the properties (phase and amplitude) of a monochromatic electromagnetic wave, propagating in a free-space medium (linear, homogeneous, non-magnetic, free of electric charge and current). More specifically, the accurate angular spectrum (AS) method is used in this paper for optical wave propagation. A complex field phasor U(x, y; z) can be expressed at any propagation plane z along the optical axis, as long as the initial phasor U(x, y; 0) is known:U(x, y; z) = F \u22121{F{U(x, y; 0)}Hz(fx, fy)} Hz(fx, fy) = F{hz(x, y)} = exp [ i2\u03c0z \u221a \u03bb\u22122 \u2212 f2x \u2212 f2y\n] (8) where (fx, fy) are the spatial frequencies of the field, Hz is the transfer function of the wave propagation phenomenon, and hz is the impulse response of the system. Note that since the angular spectrum method is constrained by free-space assumptions, it cannot be employed to compute the optical field propagation through an MLDOE. Therefore, Fourier optics is bounded to propagate a complex field, calculated after the MLDOE, onto a target plane.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12180 121805Q-5 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 15 Sep 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

The latter has been optimized using the EST (Eqs. (4) and (5)). The Strehl ratio is accurately retrieved over various wavelengths in the MWIR-LWIR wavebands and displayed in Fig. 5:\nThe optical propagation at \u03bb = 8 \u00b5m is displayed in Fig. 6:\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12180 121805Q-6 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 15 Sep 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nFinally, the longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) is computed over the MWIR-LWIR wavebands, to provide a design-oriented evaluation. In this paper, the LCA is defined as:\nLCA = f(\u03bb)\u2212 f(\u03bb = 8\u00b5m) (9)\nthe theoretical LCA is deduced from Eq. 7. The LCA is displayed in Fig. 7 for the studied IRG24-IRG27-AgCl three-layer MLDOE:\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12180 121805Q-7 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 15 Sep 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nFrom Fig. 7, it can be seen that the MLDOE LCA follows the analytical Eq. (7) and has a negative variation. This is typical for diffractive optics and allows to compensate the refractive LCA (hybrid lens) as depicted in Fig. 8:"

            "text": "The studied multilayer diffractive optical element is a dual-band extension of the classical monolayer diffractive lens (DOE). It is more complex to study but outperforms DOEs in dual-band situations. For Earth observation\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12180 121805Q-8 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 15 Sep 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\npurposes, using both MWIR and LWIR wavebands allow to gather high spatial and thermal resolution data. Since these wavebands are tied to the IR source temperature (Planck\u2019s law), having two wavebands is promising for wildfire detection, irrigation monitoring, volcano surveillance, etc. The proposed MLDOE has great potential in compact dual-band optical systems since it can be combined with refractive lenses to correct chromatic aberrations, very challenging in such a wide bandwidth. In practice, diffractive grooves are engraved on two refractive lenses (MLDOE layer 1 and 2), resulting in an apochromat hybrid triplet (three wavelength correction) having nearly the size of a doublet. Manufacturing the presented three elements MLDOE is challenging, but the materials have been chosen to be moldable and diamond-turnable, allowing for the generation of complex shapes."
