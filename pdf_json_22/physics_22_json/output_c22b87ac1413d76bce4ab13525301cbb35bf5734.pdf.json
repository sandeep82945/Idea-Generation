    "abstractText": "We define a new morphology metric called \u201cpatchiness\u201d (P) that is sensitive to deviations from the average of a resolved distribution, does not require the galaxy center to be defined, and can be used on the spatially-resolved distribution of any galaxy property. While the patchiness metric has a broad range of applications, we demonstrate its utility by investigating the distribution of dust in the interstellar medium of 310 star-forming galaxies at spectroscopic redshifts 1.36 < z < 2.66 observed by the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. The stellar continuum reddening distribution, derived from high-resolution multi-waveband CANDELS/3D-HST imaging, is quantified using the patchiness, Gini, and M20 coefficients. We find that the reddening maps of high-mass galaxies, which are dustier and more metal-rich on average, tend to exhibit patchier distributions (high P) with the reddest components concentrated within a single region (low M20). Our results support a picture where dust is uniformly distributed in low-mass galaxies (.1010M ), implying efficient mixing of dust throughout the interstellar medium. On the other hand, the dust distribution is patchier in high-mass galaxies (&1010M ). Dust is concentrated near regions of active star formation and dust mixing timescales are expected to be longer in high-mass galaxies, such that the outskirt regions of these physically larger galaxies remain relatively unenriched. This study presents direct evidence for patchy dust distributions on scales of a few kpc in high-redshift galaxies, which previously has only been suggested as a possible explanation for the observed differences between nebular and stellar continuum reddening, SFR indicators, and dust attenuation curves.",

M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. \u2020 E-mail: Tara.Fetherolf@gmail.com (TF) \u2021 Hubble Fellow\nThe morphology of a galaxy can most fundamentally be classified based on its visual structure, as is done when identifying galaxies on the well-known \u201cHubble sequence\u201d (Hubble 1926; de Vaucouleurs 1959). While the classification of galaxies has significantly advanced by crowd sourcing volunteers for visual classification (e.g., Galaxy Zoo; Lintott et al. 2008, 2011; Kartaltepe et al. 2015) and developing machine learning algorithms to train computers (e.g., Banerji et al. 2010; Dieleman et al. 2015; Dom\u00ednguez S\u00e1nchez et al. 2018), the disk-, bulge-, and bar-like structures used in visual classifications of local galaxies are not typically observed in high-redshift galaxies, which instead appear clumpy and irregular in shape (e.g., Griffiths et al. 1994; Dickinson 2000; van den Bergh 2002; Papovich et al. 2005; Shapley 2011; Law et al. 2012; Conselice 2014; Guo et al.\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n04 97\n2v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\n2015, 2018). However, quantifying the morphology of irregularly shaped high-redshift galaxies, especially at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 when galaxies were rapidly assembling their stellar mass (see Madau & Dickinson 2014), is a critical step in understanding how they evolve into the ordered structures that are observed in the local universe. In this regard, there are also quantitative morphology metrics that are dependent on the distribution of flux from images at one or two wavebands rather than visually defined patterned structures, such as the S\u00e9rsic index (S\u00e9rsic 1963), bulge-to-disk light ratio (i.e., GALFIT; Peng et al. 2002, 2010), CAS parameters (i.e., concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness; Conselice 2003), Gini coefficient (Abraham et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2004), second-order moment of light (i.e., \ud835\udc4020; Lotz et al. 2004, 2008), internal color dispersion (ICD; Papovich et al. 2005), and MID statistics (multimode, intensity, and deviation; Freeman et al. 2013). Quantitative metrics may be more appropriate for defining the morphology of high-redshift galaxies, but several of these metrics still require a well-defined center for the galaxy (e.g., S\u00e9rsic index, concentration, \ud835\udc4020), which is not trivial to define for clumpy, irregularly shaped galaxies. Furthermore, since these metrics were originally designed to be used on resolved images at only one or two wavebands, they are not necessarily suitable for probing the distribution of resolved physical properties in galaxies that are inferred from their multi-wavelength photometry. The distribution of stellar mass and sites of recent star formation can be used to investigate the efficiency of star-formation (e.g., Lang et al. 2014; Jung et al. 2017; Tacchella et al. 2018), the history of merging galaxies (e.g., Conselice 2003; Lotz et al. 2004, 2008; Cibinel et al. 2015), and the overall assembly of galaxies (e.g., Wuyts et al. 2012; Hemmati et al. 2014; Boada et al. 2015). Revealing the intrinsic properties of stellar populations within galaxies requires a correction for the obscuring effects of dust, which depends on the physical properties of the dust grains, the total amount of dust, and its distribution relative to the stars (e.g., Draine & Lee 1984; Fitzpatrick &Massa 1986; Calzetti et al. 1994; Charlot & Fall 2000). Patchy or clumpy dust distributions have been theorized as the cause behind observed variations in reddening (e.g., Calzetti et al. 1994; Wild et al. 2011; Price et al. 2014; Reddy et al. 2015, 2018a, 2020) and SFRs (e.g., Boquien et al. 2009, 2015; Hao et al. 2011; Reddy et al. 2015; Katsianis et al. 2017; Fetherolf et al. 2021) that are deduced from different probes, such as UV and H\ud835\udefc. Furthermore, the shape and slope of the dust attenuation curve has been found to vary with galactic properties both in local and high-redshift galaxies (e.g., Reddy et al. 2006, 2010, 2018b; Leja et al. 2017; Salim et al. 2018; Shivaei et al. 2020), and these variations could also be explained by differences in their dust distribution. In this study, we investigate the inferred distribution of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high-redshift galaxies based on their resolved stellar continuum reddening maps (\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars). To achieve this goal, we define a new general morphology metric, called \u201cpatchiness,\u201d which is sensitive to deviations that are both above and below the average of for a given resolved distribution and can be used to probe any resolved property, such as the flux distribution, stellar population and reddening maps, or spatially resolved emission line measurements. Resolved stellar population and robust reddening maps are constructed using the high-resolution multi-waveband imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalctic Legacy Survey (CANDELS; Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011). We also use spectroscopic redshifts and emission line measurements from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF; Kriek et al. 2015) survey to mitigate degeneracies in the resolved SED-fitting, and to derive globally averaged nebular reddening (\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas) and gas-phase metallicities. The MOSDEF survey obtained rest-frame\noptical spectra for \u223c1500 star-forming and AGN galaxies that also have been observed through CANDELS and the 3D-HST grism survey (Brammer et al. 2012; Skelton et al. 2014). The legacy of these data is such that we can probe how the distribution of dust in the ISM evolves with globally measured properties for a statistically large sample of 310 galaxies at 1.36 < \ud835\udc67 < 2.66. The data and sample selection are introduced, and the methodology for constructing resolved stellar population and robust reddening maps is outlined in Section 2. The new morphology metric, deemed \u201cpatchiness,\u201d is defined in Section 3 alongside the Gini and\ud835\udc4020 coefficients that are additionally used to probe the distribution of resolved stellar continuum reddening. Our results are presented in Section 4 with a discussion of how the ISM of high-redshift galaxies evolves with stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section 5. A cosmology that assumes\ud835\udc3b0 = 70 km s\u22121Mpc\u22121,\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and \u03a9\ud835\udc5a = 0.3 is used throughout this work. The vacuum wavelengths of emission lines are used and magnitudes are presented in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983)."

In this work, we utilize the spectroscopic redshifts and emission line measurements from the MOSDEF survey, and refer the reader to Kriek et al.

H\ud835\udefc and H\ud835\udefd emission line fluxes are corrected for Balmer absorption using the stellar populationmodel that best fits the observed 3D-HST broadband photometry (see Section 2.5). To obtain flux errors, the 1D spectra are perturbed 1000 times by their error spectra, line fluxes are remeasured, and the 1\ud835\udf0e errors are assumed to be the 68th-percentile width of the distribution. The spectroscopic redshift is determined from the observed wavelength of the highest signal-to-noise (S/N) line (typically H\ud835\udefc or [OIII]\ud835\udf065008). Refer to Kriek et al.

            "text": "The methodology for constructing stellar population and robust reddening maps is briefly outlined here, but we refer the reader to Fetherolf et al. (2020) for more detail. Individual galaxies in the sample are separated into sub-images that are 80 \u00d7 80 pixels in size (4.\u2032\u20328\u00d74.\u2032\u20328, or approximately 40 \u00d7 40 kpc at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2), which corresponds to approximately 40 \u00d7 40 kpc at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2. Pixels that are not associated with the central galaxy in each sub-image are masked using the noise equalized \ud835\udc3d125+ \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3b140+\ud835\udc3b160 Source Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) segmentation map provided by the 3D-HST survey team (Skelton et al. 2014). In order to group low S/N pixels and avoid correlated signal between individual pixels, the pixels associated with the galaxy are binned using an adaptive Voronoi binning technique (Cappellari & Copin 2003) that has been modified (see Fetherolf et al. 2020) to incorporate the S/N distribution of multiple filters with resolved\nimaging. Fetherolf et al. (2020) found that additionally considering the S/N distribution of filters at shorter wavelengths, which typically have lower S/N compared to the \ud835\udc3b160 filter, resulted in better constrained resolved SEDs compared to using the \ud835\udc3b160 S/N distribution alone. In particular, the estimated \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars is better constrained when more than one filter is required to reach a certain S/N threshold for each Voronoi bin, which also helps reduce the degeneracy between the SED-measured stellar population ages and dust attenuation. To ensure robust resolved stellar population fits, Voronoi bins are required to satisfy a S/N \u2265 5 in at least 5 filters with resolved imaging. Bins that do not satisfy this requirement are deemed as \u201coutskirt\u201d bins and are not included in the analysis. The counts from the pixels that make up an individual Voronoi bin are summed and converted to an AB magnitude. Magnitude errors are measured similarly by summing the noise in quadrature from the corresponding RMSmaps. A minimummagnitude error of 0.05mag is adopted to prevent any single photometric point from driving the best-fit resolved SED. The resolved CANDELS photometry is additionally supplemented with unresolved Spitzer/IRAC photometry (3.6 \ud835\udf07m, 4.5 \ud835\udf07m, 5.8 \ud835\udf07m, and 8.0 \ud835\udf07m; Skelton et al. 2014) in order to constrain stellar masses and stellar population ages. In order to incorporate the Spitzer/IRAC photometry into the resolved photometry, a constant \ud835\udc3b160\u2013IRAC3 color is assumed by dividing the total IRAC fluxes by the \ud835\udc3b160 flux within each Voronoi bin (see Fetherolf et al. 2020).\n3 Fetherolf et al. (2020) showed that constraining the \ud835\udc3b160\u2013IRAC does not unduly influence the degeneracy between stellar population ages and attenuation within galaxies.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)"

A Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF) and constant SFHs are assumed. Stellar ages are permitted to vary between 50Myr and the age of the Universe at the spectroscopic redshift of the galaxy.5 Sub-solarmetallicities (0.2 Z ) and an SMC extinction curve (Fitzpatrick & Massa 1990; Gordon et al. 2003) are assumed and reddening is allowed to range between 0.0 \u2264 \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars \u2264 0.4.6 Examples of the resultant stellar population and reddening maps are shown for UDS 25642 (\ud835\udc67 = 1.42) and GOODS-N 12345 (\ud835\udc67 = 2.27) in Figure 2. The number in the top left corner of each panel shows the average \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, average stellar population age, total summed SFR, and total summed stellar mass obtained from the Voronoi bins. The low S/N \u201coutskirt\u201d components that are not used throughout this analysis are indicated by the gray regions in each panel. Measuring resolved SED parameter errors can be computationally expensive for a large number of Voronoi bins and galaxies. Therefore, a subset of 50 galaxies that have a range of stellar population parameters that are representative of the larger sample are selected to obtain typical SED parameter errors. The measured unresolved and resolved photometric fluxes are perturbed by their errors and refit 100 times. The 68 models with the lowest \ud835\udf122 are used to obtain the 1\ud835\udf0e uncertainties in the SED properties derived from the unresolved photometry and individual Voronoi bins. The average SED parameter errors of the Voronoi bins for an individual galaxy are obtained by taking the average of the individual Voronoi bin parameter errors (summed in quadrature) within the galaxy. Finally, the typical resolved SED parameter errors are obtained by taking the average of the parameter errors determined from the 50 galaxies in the subsample. The typical unresolved SED parameter errors are 0.01 in \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, 0.20 dex in log stellar population age, 0.05 dex in log SFR, and 0.16 dex in log stellar mass. The typical resolved SED parameter errors based on the individual Voronoi bins are 0.03 in\n4 The results do not significantly change when alternatively using SED parameters derived from the integrated Voronoi bin fluxes. 5 Reddy et al. (2012) found that if stellar ages are restricted to being older than the typical dynamical timescale, then either constant SFHs or exponentially rising SFHs best reproduce the SFRs of \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 galaxies compared to other tracers such as IR+UV. Alternatively assuming exponentially rising SFHs results in stellar population ages that are on average \u223c30% older than those determinedwhen assuming constant SFHs (Reddy et al. 2012). For our sample we find that the SED-derived SFRs measured when assuming exponentially rising and declining SFHs are typically within 0.03 dex (higher and lower, respectively) of those measured when assuming constant SFHs, which is within the typical uncertainty of the SED-derived SFRs (0.05 dex). 6 Assuming an SMC extinction curve Fitzpatrick & Massa (1990); Gordon et al. (2003) and sub-solar metallicities, opposed to a Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve and solar metallicities, does not affect the relative order of mass measurements (Reddy et al. 2018a). The reddening of the observed restframe \ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 colors can be reproduced by a combination of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 ) and attenuation curve. The same range of observed rest-frame \ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 colors can be reproduced using either a steep attenuation curve and an \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 ) with a small dynamic range (such as SMC and 0.0 \u2264 \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 )stars \u2264 0.4) or a shallow attenuation curve and an \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 ) with a larger dynamic range (such as Calzetti and 0.0 \u2264 \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 )stars \u2264 0.6).

            "text": "Studying the structure of galaxies at high-redshifts is key towards understanding how galaxies build their stellar mass. Commonly used metrics for quantifying galactic structure include S\u00e9rsic surface brightness profiles (S\u00e9rsic 1963), light concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness (CAS; Conselice 2003), Gini coefficient, second-order moment of light (Gini-\ud835\udc4020; Abraham et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2004), and internal color dispersion (ICD; Papovich et al. 2003). All of these measures either require a well-defined centroid, are based on one- to two-filter photometry, or focus exclusively on the brightest parts of the light distribution. Alternatively, we aim to quantify structure in a way that is not dependent on a centroid\u2014especially considering that galaxies at progressively higher redshifts have increasingly irregular structure such that a \u201ccenter\u201d may not be clearly defined (e.g., Griffiths et al. 1994; Dickinson 2000; van den Bergh 2002; Papovich et al. 2005; Shapley 2011; Law et al. 2012; Conselice 2014; Guo et al. 2015, 2018). In Section 3.1 we introduce \u201cpatchiness\u201d (\ud835\udc43) as a newmorphology metric, which quantifies the dispersion of light (or any resolved property) and is sensitive to both faint and bright regions of light without requiring a defined center. The definitions and choice of the Gini (\ud835\udc3a) and \ud835\udc4020 coefficients to be used alongside patchiness are explained in Section 3.2. Finally, while the these morphology metrics could be used on any SED parameters, we have chosen in this paper to focus on how \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 is applied to the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution, which is specifically described in Section 3.3."

            "heading": "3.1 The Patchiness Metric",
            "text": "Patchiness, \ud835\udc43, is defined using a Bayesian maximum likelihood technique (for a recent review of Bayes\u2019 Theorem, see Sharma 2017) that measures the Gaussian probability that every individual resolved element, \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 , equals the weighted average of the distribution, \ud835\udc4bw. Since the stellar population and dust maps that we are using do not have equally sized bins, we choose to weight each resolved element (i.e., Voronoi bin) by their area.7 The weighted average for a Voronoi bin distribution is defined by\n\ud835\udc4bw = \u2211\ud835\udc41Vbins \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc5bpix,\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56\u2211\ud835\udc41Vbins \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc5bpix,\ud835\udc56 , (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc41Vbins is the number of Voroni bins within a single galaxy and \ud835\udc5bpix is the number of pixels contained within each Voronoi bin. Note that the denominator of Equation 1 is simply the total area of (or number of pixels contained within) the galaxy. Patchiness is used to quantify the resolved distribution of some parameter within a single galaxy and is defined by\n\ud835\udc43 = \u2212 ln { \ud835\udc41Vbins\u220f \ud835\udc56=1 1 \u221a 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56 exp [ \u2212 (\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc4bw) 2 2\ud835\udf0e2 \ud835\udc56 ] } , (2)\nwhere \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is the value of a single resolved element (Voronoi bins, in this case), \ud835\udc4bw is the weighted (or non-weighted) average of the distribution, and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56 is the parameter uncertainty within each resolved\n7 Alternatively weighting by either the \ud835\udc3b160 flux or log stellar mass of individual Voronoi bins does not significantly affect our results.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nelement. The patchiness metric is defined such that the measured \ud835\udc43 value will be low when the resolved elements equal the weighted average (high likelihood) and \ud835\udc43will be highwhen there are deviations from the average (low likelihood). For the resolved distributions probed in this study, the range of \ud835\udc43 spans several orders ofmagnitude. In order to show log \ud835\udc43 in the figures, all calculated \ud835\udc43 values are offset by a constant such that \ud835\udc43min = 1. The patchiness metric is unique compared to other traditional morphologymetrics in that it does not require a defined centroid or radius, it is sensitive to below average outliers in addition to deviations above themean, and it is insensitive to properties with large dynamic ranges (e.g., stellar mass) or values that approach zero (e.g., \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)). Patchiness is most comparable to the ICD (Papovich et al. 2003), which measures the dispersion of light between the resolved imaging obtained in two different filters for a given galaxy. However, patchiness can be directly applied to any resolved property\u2014including those derived from resolved SED fitting, which incorporates the flux distribution in several photometric bands. It is important to note that the patchiness metric (and other quantitative metrics) should only be used to compare the relative patchiness of resolved distributions for galaxies that make up a uniformly defined and analyzed sample. The calculated values of patchiness will vary depending on how the resolved distribution is defined, such as the choice of binning and the method for defining which resolved elements are included in the morphology analysis for a single galaxy. An in-depth analysis of the patchiness metric is presented in Appendix A using the resolved SED-derived \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, stellar population ages, SFRs, and stellar masses. Our conclusions from Appendix A are summarized briefly as follows. 1) Galaxies that are patchier in one resolved SED-derived property are more likely to be\npatchier in other resolved SED-derived properties, possibly due to dependencies between SED-derived parameters. 2) The ICD is most significantly correlated with the patchiness of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution compared to other SED-derived properties. 3) Patchiness is significantly correlated with the Gini coefficient (also see Section 3.2). 4) Caution should be taken when measuring the patchiness on a pixel-by-pixel scale due to correlated signal between neighboring pixels and stochastic measurements from pixels with low S/N. 5) Patchiness values should only be compared between galaxies at similar redshifts, as the patchiness values are not preserved due to surface brightness dimming. Inconsistencies between quantified galaxy structure when measured across a range of redshifts is a common issue with nonparametric morphology indicators (e.g., Giavalisco et al. 1996; Conselice 2003, 2014; Lisker 2008) and, thus, is not unique to the performance of the patchiness metric. For this reason, the subsequent analyses are separated by the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 redshift bins. 6) Patchiness is not biased towards higher values for galaxies with more resolved elements, but galaxies with more resolved elements may be intrinsically patchier for some resolved properties (such as stellar mass). Finally, it is important to emphasize that the morphology of galaxies can be best understoodwhen several morphologymetrics are used together. In the present study, we choose to pair patchiness with the Gini and \ud835\udc4020 coefficients, which are sensitive to the resolved elements with the highest measured values or inferred quantities (e.g., brightest or highest mass regions). Morphology metrics that are sensitive to outliers with specific characteristics in a resolved distribution (i.e., high flux or high mass), such as Gini and \ud835\udc4020, complement the patchiness metric, which is sensitive to any type of outlier (high or low) in a resolved distribution.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)"

(2003) adapted theGini coefficient tomeasure the concentration of light within galaxies based on their resolved imaging. After sorting the resolved measurements from lowest to highest flux, the Gini coefficient is calculated by\n\ud835\udc3a = 1\n|\ud835\udc4bw |\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 (2\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) |\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 |, (3)\nwhere \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is the flux within an individual resolved element (i.e., Voronoi bin), \ud835\udc5b is the total number of resolved elements, and \ud835\udc4bw is the weighted average of the resolved distribution. If all \ud835\udc5b resolved elements have an equal amount of flux, then \ud835\udc3a = 0. Conversely, if a single resolved element has all of the flux, then \ud835\udc3a = 1. While a high Gini value implies a high concentration of flux, the flux is not necessarily concentrated in a single region since there is no spatial information in the metric. Lotz et al. (2004) introduced the \ud835\udc4020 parameter, which is the normalized second-order moment of the 20% brightest regions in a galaxy. The center of the brightest region is defined at (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc50 , \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc50), which is determined by minimizing the total second-order moment. The total second-order moment, \ud835\udc40tot is defined by\n\ud835\udc40tot = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc5b\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 [(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc50)2 + (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc50)2], (4)\nwhere (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56) is the location of each resolved element and \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is the flux of each resolved element. The \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 fluxes are then ordered from highest to lowest flux and \ud835\udc4020 is defined as\n\ud835\udc4020 = log (\u2211 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc40tot\n) , while \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 < 0.2\ud835\udc4btot, (5)\nwhere only the brightest 20% of resolved elements are included. Like the Gini coefficient, \ud835\udc4020 is also a measure of the concentration of light, but includes spatial information of the brightest regions. Low \ud835\udc4020 values (typically negative) indicate that the brightest regions are more significantly grouped within a single region of the galaxy. As \ud835\udc4020 increases (less negative and towards zero), the brightest regions tend to be more spatially spread across several clusters of light. The \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc4020 coefficients complement each other in that \ud835\udc3a identifies galaxies where there exists regions of high brightness compared to the average, and \ud835\udc4020 identifies the spatial distribution of the brightest regions. Together, the\ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc4020 coefficients have been used to characterize the morphologies of galaxies (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2011; Wuyts et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2018), classify galaxies into traditional Hubble types (Lotz et al. 2004, 2008; Boada et al. 2015), and identify merging galaxies (Lotz et al. 2008; Boada et al. 2015). However, a critical assessment of theGini coefficient byLisker (2008) found that the Gini coefficient significantly depends on the S/N of resolved elements and the radius used to determine the inclusion of pixels when calculating \ud835\udc3a. Therefore, \ud835\udc3a measurements and Gini-defined classification schemes (e.g., Lotz et al. 2008) cannot be directly compared between studies with differing methodologies or sample characteristics. The same can be said for \ud835\udc43, which is why we emphasize in Section 3.1 that \ud835\udc43 should only be used to compare the patchiness of resolved distributions for galaxies in uniformly defined and analyzed samples at similar redshifts (also see Appendix A). An in-depth comparison between \ud835\udc43 and the \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc4020 coefficients is discussed in Appendix A, where we find that \ud835\udc43 is significantly correlated with \ud835\udc3a in all resolved SED-derived properties for galaxies in our sample."

However, Wuyts et al. (2012) emphasized the importance of studying multi-color morphologies using \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc4020 by calculating these metrics on the resolved stellar mass distribution for the first time. We further extend the usage of \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc4020 by quantifying the concentration of the reddest Voronoi bins (\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars,bin > \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009) in the resolved reddening maps.

Uncertainties in \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 are determined by perturbing the entire resolved distribution by the uncertainties of the resolved elements and remeasuring \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 100 times. The 1\ud835\udf0e uncertainty is set to be the range of the 68 perturbations that are closest to the originally measured morphology value. Examples of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars maps ordered by their \ud835\udc43 values are shown in Appendix B. The revised interpretation for measuring \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution requires redefining \u201cbright\u201d regions as the reddest regions in the distribution, or the Voronoi bins with the highest \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars. A high \ud835\udc3a then indicates the presence of regions with red (high) inferred \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars relative to \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009, and a low \ud835\udc3a implies a more uniform distribution of reddening between regions that are close to the average value. The spatial continuity of the reddest (highest 20% \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars) regions is quantified by\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\n\ud835\udc4020, where a low \ud835\udc4020 indicates that the reddest regions tend to be concentrated within a single clump and a high \ud835\udc4020 indicates that the reddest regions occur in several clumps that are spatially separated across the galaxy. Figure 3 shows examples of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars maps for eight galaxies that span the parameter space between \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020. It can be seen that the galaxies in the top panels (high \ud835\udc3a) exhibit larger differences between \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 and the reddest region (maximum resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars) compared to the galaxies shown in the bottom panels (low \ud835\udc3a). Patchiness, on the other hand, more generally probes the dispersion of a resolved distribution and, thus, is sensitive to both the reddest and bluest regions in the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars maps (see examples of \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars ordered by \ud835\udc43 in Appendix B). Furthermore, from the right set of panels in Figure 3 it can be seen that the reddest regions (highest resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars) are distributed generally within a single region for the galaxies shown in the left sub-panels (low \ud835\udc4020), but are spatially spread across the galaxies shown in the right sub-panels (high \ud835\udc4020). A complication when calculating \ud835\udc3a on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution is that \ud835\udc3a may be artificially high or unphysical (\ud835\udc3a > 1) as \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 approaches zero (consistent with no dust reddening inferred from the best-fit SEDs). Therefore, we raise caution when using \ud835\udc3a on any resolved distribution where the average could be near zero, such as the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution. The relationship between the \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 and \ud835\udc3a calculated on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution for galaxies in the sample is shown in Figure 4 and is separated by the two redshift bins. The regions where \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 \u2264 0.05 and \u22640.10mag are shaded in green. While galaxies with low \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 typically tend to have high\ud835\udc3a, there are also individual galaxies within the green shaded regions that have relatively low \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 and low or average \ud835\udc3a such that \ud835\udc3a is not necessarily artificially boosted when \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 is nearly zero. On the high \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 end, there is a similar effect where low \ud835\udc3a values are caused by the maximum \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars of 0.40mag allowed in the SED models (see Section 2.5). If the galaxy is very red on average (high \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009), then the \u201creddest\u201d regions will not appear as significant outliers in the resolved distribution. Referring to Figure 3, the example reddening maps show that galaxies with low \ud835\udc3a (bottom panels) tend to be redder on average (higher \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009) than those with higher \ud835\udc3a (top panels). These limitations of \ud835\udc3a on the resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution highlight the importance of pairing \ud835\udc3a with a morphology metric that is not exclusively sensitive towards the highest or lowest values in a resolved distribution\u2014such as the patchiness metric, \ud835\udc43. Furthermore, while \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc3a are generally positively correlated (see Appendix A), the examples shown in the left set of sub-panels of Figure 3 demonstrate how \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc3a can be used together to further quantify differences in the morphology of galaxies. For example, GOODS-S 33036 (top left sub-panel) shows how a single outlier can drive \ud835\udc3a higher while the global distribution remains generally smooth with low \ud835\udc43. Therefore, \ud835\udc3a can still be used to probe the concentration of dust reddening as long as the contribution of \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 is considered when interpreting trends with \ud835\udc3a."

            "text": "Mass is a fundamental parameter of galaxies. Connections between the stellar mass of a galaxy and its other physical properties, such as their SFR (e.g., Noeske et al. 2007; Daddi et al. 2007; Pannella et al. 2009; Wuyts et al. 2011; Reddy et al. 2012; Whitaker et al. 2012, 2014; Shivaei et al. 2015), gas-phase oxygen abundance (Tremonti et al. 2004; Erb et al. 2006; Kewley & Ellison 2008; Mannucci et al. 2010; Andrews & Martini 2013; Sanders et al. 2015, 2018, 2021), and dust content (e.g., Pannella et al. 2009; Yoshikawa et al. 2010; Price et al. 2014; Hemmati et al. 2015; Reddy et al. 2006, 2010, 2015; Nelson et al. 2016; Tacchella et al. 2018; Shivaei et al. 2020), give clues to the processes that drive the evolution of galaxies. Understanding the distribution of dust is also critical for inferring the bolometric output from the underlying stellar populations. Therefore, in this section we investigate how the dust distribution, as inferred by the \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 morphology metrics measured on the resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars maps, varies as a function of the total stellar mass for galaxies at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2. Total stellar masses are derived from the SEDs that best fit the integrated 3D-HST photometry (see Section 2.5). Examples of the reddening maps for the lowest and highest mass galaxies in our \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples are shown in Figure 5, with the log stellar mass of each galaxy listed in the bottom right corner of each panel. The highest mass galaxies in both redshift samples tend to exhibit more complicated \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions, whereas the low-mass galaxies exhibit more uniform and generally bluer \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions (see further discussion in Section 4.3). In addition to using the morphology metrics on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution, the global \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars derived from the integrated 3D-HST photometry (see Section 2.5) and the global \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas are also incorporated into this analysis. Balmer decrements (H\ud835\udefc/H\ud835\udefd) measured for each galaxy by the MOSDEF survey (see Section 2.2) are used to calculate the globally averaged \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas, where a Cardelli et al. (1989) galactic extinction curve is assumed.8 Typical ISM conditions with \ud835\udc47 = 10000K, \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52 = 102 cm\u22123, and Case B recombination are assumed. Zero dust extinction is assumed for galaxies with H\ud835\udefc/H\ud835\udefd < 2.86 (Osterbrock 1989). If H\ud835\udefc or H\ud835\udefd is not detected with a S/N \u2265 3, then individual measurements for \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas are represented by their 3\ud835\udf0e upper limit. Figure 6 shows all measures of \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49) versus stellar mass for the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 (top panels) and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 (bottom panels) samples. Each top row of panels shows the unresolved globally averaged \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas (panel a), \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (panel b), and difference between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (panel c) versus stellar mass. Each bottom row of panels show the \ud835\udc43 (panel d),\ud835\udc3a (panel e), and\ud835\udc4020 (panel f) morphology metrics calculated on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution versus stellar mass. Stacked measurements of \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas in four bins of stellar mass containing an equal number of objects from the parent (large red diamonds) and final (small orange diamonds) samples are also shown (see Section 2.3). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60) is calculated from the individual measurements\u2014not including those with upper or lower limits\u2014 and its significance is shown in the top left corner of each panel. Throughout our analysis we consider >2\ud835\udf0e significance as statistically significant given that there is a >95% confidence of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n8 Reddy et al. (2020) found that the shape of the nebular dust attenuation curve derived directly from the MOSDEF sample is similar in shape at restframe optical wavelengths to the Cardelli et al. (1989) Galactic extinction curve.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nIn agreement with previous studies, we find that \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas (panel a), \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (panel b), and the difference between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (panel c) are significantly correlated with stellar mass (e.g., Yoshikawa et al. 2010; Price et al. 2014; Hemmati et al. 2015; Reddy et al. 2015; Nelson et al. 2016; Tacchella et al. 2018). The relationship between \ud835\udc43 and stellar mass (panel d) shows that low-mass galaxies tend to have smoother \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions while high-mass galaxies exhibit generally patchier dust reddening distributions, but with a higher dispersion in \ud835\udc43 between galaxies of similar mass (see left panel of Figure 7). The \ud835\udc3a of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution anti-correlates with stellar mass (panel e). An anti-correlation between \ud835\udc3a and stellar mass implies that the reddest regions in low-mass galaxies are significant outliers relative to \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 and the reddest regions in high-mass galaxies are comparable to \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 (see Section 3.3). Since high-mass\ngalaxies are known to be typically dustier than low-mass galaxies, their reddest regions are not significant outliers compared to the average reddening and, thus, it is expected that they would exhibit lower Gini \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions (see Section 3.3). Finally, the high-mass galaxies in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample tend to have lower \ud835\udc4020 values than low-mass \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 galaxies (top panel f). Low \ud835\udc4020 values indicates that the reddest regions are generally concentrated within a single region in high-mass \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 galaxies. There is no correlation observed between \ud835\udc4020 and stellar mass for the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample (bottom panel f).\nWe further investigate the significance of the relationship between \ud835\udc43 measured on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution versus stellar mass (Figure 6d) by performing an independent t-test. The \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples are each split into a low- and high-mass bin, each with an equal number of galaxies where the threshold between low-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nand high-mass galaxies is \u223c1010M . The independent t-test on the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample shows that there is a significant difference in the \ud835\udc43 measured between low- and high-mass galaxies (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05), whereas the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample shows a marginal difference in the \ud835\udc43 measured between low- and high-mass galaxies (\ud835\udc5d < 0.1). The significant difference shown by the independent t-test could be caused by the large difference in the dispersion of \ud835\udc43 between each redshift bin (see left panel of Figure 7), therefore we also perform bootstrap resampling over 1000 iterations to determine the 68% confidence interval on the distribution of \ud835\udc43 values in each sub-sample. We find that the confidence intervals from the bootstrap resampling of the low- and high-mass bins do not overlap with each other for either the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 or \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 galaxies. After testing higher confidence intervals, we find that they begin to overlap at the 90% and 87% confidence levels for the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples, respectively. Therefore, we consider the trend between \ud835\udc43 measured on the stellar continuum reddening distribution and stellar mass to be significant to at least 1.5\ud835\udf0e confidence. In extension to the discussion throughout Appendix A, we also further investigate how \ud835\udc43 of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution may be correlated with the number of Voronoi bins and the sizes of the galaxies in our sample. We find that the \ud835\udc43 of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution for the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample is positively correlated with both the number of Voronoi bins and the size of the galaxies at 3.5\ud835\udf0e and 2.4\ud835\udf0e, respectively. On the other hand, the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample shows that \ud835\udc43 on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution is inversely correlated with the number of Voronoi bins to 4.0\ud835\udf0e significance, such that galaxies with fewer Voronoi bins tend to have patchier dust distributions, and \ud835\udc43 measured on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution is not significantly correlated with the size of the galaxy (1.6\ud835\udf0e). When combining the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples, \ud835\udc43 is not significantly correlated with the number of Voronoi bins (1.2\ud835\udf0e) but is significantly correlated with the size of the galaxy (5.3\ud835\udf0e). The significant correlation between \ud835\udc43 and the size of the galaxies is not surprising given that there is a very strong size\u2013\ud835\udc40\u2217 relationship (see Figure 1) and Figure 6d shows how \ud835\udc43 correlateswith stellarmass in both redshift bins.While \ud835\udc43 correlates significantly with the number of Voronoi bins in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample, this trend is inverse in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample and does not persist in the combined sample. Therefore, we suggest that the patchiness metric is not biased by the number of Voronoi bins in a galaxy, and instead that the trend between \ud835\udc43 and the number of Voronoi bins is more directly related to the clumpy light distribution observed from the imaging of the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 galaxies (see also Appendix B). Based on our investigations on the significance in the difference between the \ud835\udc43 measured from the low- and high-mass bins and the insignificant correlation between \ud835\udc43 and the number of Voronoi bins, we overall suggest that the trend between \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc40\u2217 is driven by the physical conditions in the ISM. It is expected that galaxies with centrally-peaked radial dust profiles would exhibit lower\ud835\udc4020 since the reddest regions are defined as being located within a single region. Several studies have observed \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas to be centrally peaked in \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 galaxies, with some evidence for steeper radial gradients as stellar mass increases (e.g. Nelson et al. 2013, 2016; Hemmati et al. 2015; Tacchella et al. 2018). These observations are in agreement with our findings of lower \ud835\udc4020 in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 high-mass galaxies (Figure 6f top panel). Tacchella et al. (2018) also found that several galaxies in their sample of 10 star-forming galaxies at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 (\ud835\udc40\u2217 \u223c 1010\u2013 1011.4M ) exhibited secondary local maxima in their radial attenuation profiles while the stacked profile showed a mostly smooth gradient. Secondary non-central peaks in the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution would cause generally higher \ud835\udc43 and, if the secondary peaks are\nwithin the 20% reddest regions, higher\ud835\udc4020 values.We find examples of galaxies with both types of \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions with high \ud835\udc43 on the high-mass end of the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample. For example, COSMOS 19753 (top right sub-panel of Figure 3) has high \ud835\udc4020 (several red clumps) and AEGIS 10494 (left of the bottom right panel of Figure 5) has low \ud835\udc4020 (single red clump). Therefore, a mix of galaxies with a single central peak and those with additional off-center peaks in their radial dust attenuation profiles could explain both patchier dust distributions in high-mass galaxies and the flat correlation between stellar mass and \ud835\udc4020 observed in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample (bottom panels d and f in Figure 6f). Alternatively, it is possible that galaxies in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample are not sufficiently resolved (see Appendix A) to robustly probe the shape of the radial dust attenuation profile. While high Gini could indicate steeper radial gradients, the reddest regions probed by the Gini coefficient do not necessarily need to be grouped within a single region (e.g., the center). Furthermore, when Gini is measured on the dust reddening, high Gini values can be attributed to \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 being nearly zero (see Figure 4), which could drive the significance of the relationship between Gini and stellar mass. While patchiness is a newly-derived morphology metric, we show in Appendix A that \ud835\udc43 calculated on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution is significantly correlated with ICD (Papovich et al. 2003). Boada et al. (2015) found that higher mass galaxies (up to \ud835\udc40\u2217 = 1011M ) at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 tend to have higher ICD, which is comparable with our findings that the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution tends to be patchier in higher mass galaxies (Figure 6d). Several studies have suggested that patchy dust distributions could explain observed differences between nebular and stellar continuum reddening (e.g., Calzetti et al. 1994; Wild et al. 2011; Price et al. 2014; Reddy et al. 2015, 2018a, 2020) and SFR indicators (e.g., Boquien et al. 2009, 2015; Hao et al. 2011; Reddy et al. 2015; Katsianis et al. 2017; Fetherolf et al. 2021). Our observation of high-mass galaxies exhibiting patchier stellar continuum dust reddening distributions (Figure 6d) and larger differences\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nbetween their globally averaged nebular and stellar continuum reddening (Figure 6c) further suggests a connection between patchy dust distributions and the differences between the stellar continuum and nebular reddening. However, we find no correlation between the \ud835\udc43 of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution and the difference between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, which suggests that other processes may also be contributing to the observed differences between stellar continuum and nebular reddening."

            "text": "There exists a well-known relationship between stellar mass and gasphase oxygen abundance, hereafter referred to as the \u201cmetallicity\u201d (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004). There is also a known correlation between dust and metals (e.g., Dwek 1998; Jenkins 2009; Reddy et al. 2010; Mattsson et al. 2014; R\u00e9my-Ruyer et al. 2014; Shivaei et al. 2017; De Vis et al. 2019; Shapley et al. 2020; Galliano et al. 2021). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the morphology metrics that probe the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution may correlate with metallicity. In this section we show how \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 calculated on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution vary as a function of metallicity. Gas-phase metallicities are based on the [NII]\ud835\udf066585, H\ud835\udefc, [OIII]\ud835\udf065008, and H\ud835\udefd emission line measurements from the MOSDEF survey (see Section 2.2). The empirical calibrations from Pettini & Pagel (2004) are assumed to obtain gas-phase oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)) based on the log{([OIII]\ud835\udf065008/H\ud835\udefd)/([NII]\ud835\udf066585/H\ud835\udefc)} (O3N2) indicator.9 Since these ratios include lines that are close in wavelength, the lines are not corrected for dust obscuration. If [NII]\ud835\udf066585 and/or H\ud835\udefd is not detected with a S/N \u2265 3, then an upper limit on the metallicity is assumed. If [OIII]\ud835\udf065008 and/or H\ud835\udefc is not detected with a S/N \u2265 3, then a lower limit on the metallicity is assumed. Any other combination of lines that are not detected with a S/N \u2265 3 is not useful for obtaining gas-phase metallicities. Based on these restrictions, we obtained gas-phase metallicities for 262 galaxies, with 128 of those galaxies having either upper or lower limits on their metallicities. Metallicities with upper or lower limits on their measurements are not included when determining the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and its significance and the results do not change significantly when all measurements are included. Figure 8 shows all measures of \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49) (similar to Figure 6) versus O3N2 metallicity, split by the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 (top panels) and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 (bottom panels) samples. The orange diamonds in panels d\u2013f show the metallicities measured from the spectra that were stacked in two bins of each morphology metric (\ud835\udc43,\ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020). Most significantly, we find that higher metallicity galaxies in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample tend to be overall dustier with higher \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (top panels a and b). The correlation between metallicity and globally averaged dust reddening is consistent with the known connection between dust and metals (e.g., Dwek 1998; Jenkins 2009; Reddy et al. 2010; Mattsson et al. 2014; R\u00e9my-Ruyer et al. 2014; Shivaei et al. 2017; De Vis et al. 2019; Shapley et al. 2020; Galliano et al. 2021). The correlation between metallicity and \ud835\udc4020 (top panel f) suggests that high-metallicity galaxies at \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 exhibit centrally-peaked radial dust profiles (see Section 4.3), similar to galaxies with higher masses (Nelson et al. 2016). There is no significant correlation between metallicity and \ud835\udc43 (panel d), but the dispersion in \ud835\udc43 is higher in \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 high-metallicity galaxies (right panel of Figure 7). This\n9 Using the N2 indicator produces results that are statistically consistent with those using the O3N2 indicator.\nsuggests that low-metallicity galaxies have comparable \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions while there is more variety in the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions of high-metallicity galaxies, in that the distribution can be either smooth or patchy. For the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample, we find that high-metallicity galaxies tend to have higher \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars relative to low-metallicity galaxies (bottom panel b). On the other hand, unlike the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample, we find no significant trend between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and metallicity for the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample (bottom panel a). The lack of correlation between metallicity and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample, such that \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas is typically the average of the sample ( \u2329 \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas\n\u232a = 0.31mag) at any metallicity, may be related to why the difference between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas is uncorrelated with metallicity (bottom panel c). Shivaei et al. (2020) suggested that a larger difference between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas observed in lowmetallicity galaxies may be attributed to patchier dust distributions. However, we do not observe a correlation between \ud835\udc43 measured on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution and metallicity for galaxies in either the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 or \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples (panel d). It is possible that the metalrich gas may follow a similar distribution to the dust that reddens the stellar continuum (as probed by \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars) across the ISM, but the global enrichment of the galaxy is not directly connected to the dust reddening towards the most massive stars that have recently formed (as probed by \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas). Due to the significant relationship between \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars and metallicity, lower metallicity \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 galaxies also tend to show higher\ud835\udc3a on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution (bottom panel e; also see Figure 4). Finally, there is no significant correlation between the concentration of the reddest regions, as probed by \ud835\udc4020, and the global metallicity for the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample, which is similar to what is found between \ud835\udc4020 and stellar mass (Figure 6f)."

            "text": "Here we present a possible physical interpretation for how the dust distribution evolves in \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 galaxies based on the relationships observed among nebular reddening, stellar continuum reddening, stellar mass, and metallicity. Specifically, our results suggest that the dust distribution in high-redshift galaxies tends to transition from smooth to patchy with increasing stellar mass. While there exists a well-known relationship between the stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004; Erb et al. 2006; Kewley&Ellison 2008; Mannucci et al. 2010; Andrews &Martini 2013; Sanders et al. 2015, 2018, 2021), we showed in Section 4.2 that the distribution of dust as probed by \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 in the resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars maps is not significantly connected with the global metal enrichment of the ISM compared to the total stellar mass. We observed a significant correlation between metallicity and the average \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (panel b in Figure 8), but there are marginal to null relationships between metallicity and \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020 (panels d\u2013f in Figure 8). These findings are consistent with previous studies that have found radialmetallicity profiles in \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 galaxies that are generally flat for a wide range of stellar masses (\ud835\udc40\u2217 \u223c 107\u20131011M ; Jones et al. 2015; Leethochawalit et al. 2016; Wuyts et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019; Simons et al. 2021). Radial dust profiles, on the other hand, tend to be centrally peaked in massive \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2 galaxies (\ud835\udc40\u2217 \u223c 109\u20131011M ; Nelson et al. 2013, 2016; Hemmati et al. 2015; Tacchella et al. 2018). Therefore, while higher metallicity galaxies are dustier on average, the actual spatial distribution of dust is not necessarily correlated with the global metallicity of the galaxy. Instead, we propose that the mechanisms responsible for distributing dust throughout the ISM of high-redshift galaxies are more fundamentally connected to the stellar mass of these galaxies. In the following discussion, we focus\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\non describing how the distribution of dust tends to change with stellar mass by referencing Figure 9. The corresponding interpretation with metallicity is mentioned when relevant. The characteristics of the dust distribution in low- and high-mass galaxies are described separately, then we summarize how galaxies may transition from a smooth to patchy dust distribution as they increase in stellar mass. In the subsequent discussion, we use a threshold of 1010M to define low- and high-mass galaxies. A schematic example for low-mass galaxies is shown on the left side of Figure 9. Low-mass galaxies are observed to exhibit lower globally-averaged \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars that are approximately equal to each other (panels a\u2013c in Figure 6), indicating that low-mass galaxies (and similarly low-metallicity galaxies) have low dust content. Low-mass galaxies tend to have lower measures of \ud835\udc43 on their \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions (panel d in Figure 6), which implies that the distribution of dust is typically smooth in these galaxies (as depicted by the large yellow circle in Figure 9; also see Figure 5).10 Furthermore, both low-mass and low-metallicity galaxies exhibit similar degrees of patchiness in their \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions (i.e, low dispersion; see Figure 7). The higher \ud835\udc3a in low-mass galaxies is likely boosted by there being very little dust overall (\u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 \u2248 0; see Figure 4), but localized regions with higher \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars compared to the global average may exist (Figure 6e). The higher \ud835\udc4020 values (Figure 6f) indicate that the highest \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars regions are not concentrated within a single area in low-mass galaxies (as depicted by the small orange circles in Figure 9). The localized regions with higher \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars likely correspond to sites of recent star formation,11 but the distribution of\n10 Low \ud835\udc43 is not caused by having fewer Voronoi bins (see Appendix A) or low S/N components. Low S/N Voronoi bins are not included in the analysis (see Section 2.4). 11 Confirmation that the regions with higher \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 )stars (small orange circles in Figure 9) correspond to sites of recent star formation would require resolved nebular emission line maps (i.e., resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc49 )gas maps), which are not available for individual galaxies in our sample. The 3D-HST\nstar formation as probed by the SED-derived SFR maps is still observed to be generally smooth in low-mass galaxies (see Figure 10). These results are consistent with a picture in which dust distributes throughout low-mass galaxies on a short timescale (<100Myr), such that there is a generally negligible difference between the observed \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars and\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gasmeasured globally across these galaxies (Figure 6c). The right side of Figure 9 shows a schematic for high-mass galaxies. While \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas is observed to be higher than \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars in high-mass galaxies, both \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars are high when compared to values typical of low-mass galaxies (panels a\u2013c in Figure 6; e.g., Yoshikawa et al. 2010; Price et al. 2014; Hemmati et al. 2015; Reddy et al. 2015; Nelson et al. 2016; Tacchella et al. 2018; Shivaei et al. 2020). These trends suggest that while highmass galaxies (and similarly high-metallicity galaxies) are generally dustier than low-mass galaxies (medium-sized orange circles), the regions that formed stars most recently are dustier than that which is typical of the ISM across the galaxy (small dark orange circles; Figure 6c). There is a wide dispersion in the patchiness of high-mass galaxies and high-metallicity \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 galaxies (Figure 7), but on average the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions of high-mass galaxies tend to be patchier than those of low-mass galaxies and they have lower \ud835\udc3a (panels d\u2013e in Figure 6). Since \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 is redder in high-mass and high-metallicity galaxies, the reddest regions are not sufficiently significant outliers to drive\ud835\udc3a to higher values (see Figure 4).\ud835\udc3a is also not sensitive to the bluest regions in the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution, by definition (Equation 3). Therefore, a high \ud835\udc43 and low \ud835\udc3a in high-mass galaxies indicates that there are several low \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars outliers that are driving \ud835\udc43 to higher values (yellow regions near edges).\nresolved emission line maps have been used to study the distribution of recent star formation and dust in stacks of several galaxies (e.g., Wuyts et al. 2013; Nelson et al. 2013, 2016), but the S/N of the emission-line map elements are not typically sufficient for performing a comparative analysis on the distribution of the stellar continuum and nebular emission in individual galaxies at high redshifts.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\nLastly, the dustiest regions are generally concentrated within a single clump (overlapping orange regions) given the lower \ud835\udc4020 values in the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions of high-mass and high-metallicity galaxies in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample. The centers of the reddest regions, defined by (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc50 , \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc50) from Section 3.2, are typically within 1 kpc of the center of the sub-images (i.e., observed center; see Section 2.4) and are at most 4.5 kpc from the center. It then follows that the interpretation of low \ud835\udc4020, which indicates a single dusty region in the ISM of \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 high-mass and high-metallicity galaxies, is consistent with observations of centrally-peaked radial dust profiles in these galaxies (e.g., Nelson et al. 2013, 2016; Hemmati et al. 2015; Tacchella et al. 2018). The lack of centrally-concentrated dust reddening (probed by\ud835\udc4020) in \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 high-mass galaxies could be explained by spatially independent young star-forming regions or there being insufficient time for the dust to diffuse throughout the ISM in these physically large galaxies. The possibility of spatially independent young star-forming regions in high-mass galaxies is further supported by a correlation between \ud835\udc43 of the SED-derived resolved SFR and stellar mass (Figure 10), which is more significant for galaxies in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample (3.4\ud835\udf0e) than the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample (2.3\ud835\udf0e). Alternatively, the total amount of dust increases throughout the diffuse ISM in high-mass galaxies, but mixes throughout the ISM on longer timescales than that of lowmass galaxies due to the physically larger sizes of high-mass galaxies (see right panel of Figure 1 and Figure 6d). Otherwise, the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 galaxies may not be sufficiently resolved to robustly probe the dynamic range of \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc4020 since the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 galaxies have fewer resolved components (i.e., Voronoi bins) than the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 galaxies in this study (see Appendix A). The distribution of dust has traditionally been approximated by either a uniform dust screen or a two-component dust model (Calzetti et al. 1994; Charlot & Fall 2000) with higher optical depths towards the youngest star-forming regions, which causes \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas to be systematically larger than \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars (Calzetti et al. 2000). Patchy dust distributions have also been invoked in order to explain both the observed differences between stellar continuum and nebular reddening, andUV andH\ud835\udefc SFR indicators (e.g.,Wild et al. 2011; Price et al.\n2014; Boquien et al. 2015; Reddy et al. 2015). Our results suggest that low-mass galaxies have a generally diffuse and uniform distribution of dust throughout their ISM, with only minor deviations towards higher opacities in localized regions. Recent star-formation activity may be distributed uniformly throughout low-mass galaxies, thus resulting in a smooth distribution of dust through stellar evolutionary processes. Furthermore, several simulation studies have suggested that dust mixes nearly instantaneously (\u223cfew tens of Myr) between the cold and warm ISM (e.g., McKee 1989; Tielens 1998; Peters et al. 2017). Therefore, efficient dust mixing in spatially small (i.e., low-mass) galaxies could explain their relatively smooth distributions as indicated in the dust reddening maps. As galaxies increase in stellar mass through in-situ star formation, they will produce significantly more dust and have physically larger sizes than their low-mass counterparts. We suggest that regions closest to sites of dust production (star-forming regions) within high-mass galaxies will become enriched first, while the remainder of the ISM becomes enriched on longer timescales. Meanwhile, a centrally-peaked concentration of dust can form in high-mass galaxies (\ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample) if star-forming regions are closely spaced or if star-formation activity is generally higher in the centers of high-mass galaxies. The observed variations in the dust distribution has implications for the selection of an appropriate dust attenuation curve, especially considering that the shape of the dust attenuation curve has been observed to vary with galaxy properties (e.g., Reddy et al. 2006, 2010, 2018b; Leja et al. 2017; Salim et al. 2018; Shivaei et al. 2020). Therefore, assuming a single attenuation curve shape for all high-redshift galaxies may not be appropriate. Since the highest mass galaxies tend to exhibit patchier dust distributions, their starlight may more appropriately be corrected for dust obscuration by assuming a grayer dust attenuation curve (e.g., Calzetti et al. 2000). On the other hand, a steeper SMC-like dust attenuation curve (Fitzpatrick & Massa 1990; Gordon et al. 2003) may be more appropriate for low-mass galaxies with smoother dust distributions. Investigating the distribution of dust in galaxies using a sample that is split between different attenuation curve assumptions would require a further indepth investigation with a larger sample size given that comparative morphology metrics\u2014such as \ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020\u2014are best applied to uniformly defined samples (see Section 3 and Appendix A). To summarize, as depicted by Figure 9, we suggest that the evolution of the dust distribution in the ISM is correlated with stellar mass and possibly the physical size of the galaxy. Low-mass galaxies exhibit smooth dust distributions, possibly due to uniformly distributed star-formation activity and short dust mixing timescales in these generally compact galaxies.Meanwhile, high-mass galaxies tend to show more complex dust distributions on average (but with higher dispersion) compared to low-mass galaxies, perhaps due to their physically larger sizes and longer dust mixing timescales. Galaxy simulations that include the effects of dust propagation through the ISM should help to quantify the dust mixing timescales for galaxies of different masses. Finally, we defer a discussion about how the ISM dust distribution evolves across cosmic time to a future work with a larger sample across redshift bins given that the trends observed in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 are generally statistically consistent between our \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 redshift samples."

            "text": "We investigated the inferred distribution of dust for a sample of 310 star-forming galaxies from the MOSDEF survey at spectroscopic redshifts 1.36 < \ud835\udc67 < 2.66. Using a new morphology metric called\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\npatchiness (\ud835\udc43), the Gini coefficient (\ud835\udc3a), and second-order moment of light (\ud835\udc4020), we quantified robust dust reddening maps that were constructed from CANDELS/3D-HST high-resolution imaging. Globally averaged \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)gas, \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, and gas-phase metallicity (O3N2) were also used to help build a physical interpretation for the evolution of the distribution of dust throughout the ISM of highredshift galaxies. We found that the total amount of dust is correlated both with stellar mass and metallicity, but the distribution of dust (as probed by \ud835\udc43,\ud835\udc3a, and \ud835\udc4020) is more significantly connected to the stellar mass (Figure 6) of a galaxy than its globally-averaged gas-phase metallicity (Figure 8). The patchiness metric (\ud835\udc43; Equation 2) is sensitive to both the high and low outliers of a distribution. Low-mass galaxies tend to exhibit low \ud835\udc43 in their \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions, indicating that the dust is uniformly distributed throughout their ISM. Meanwhile, high-mass galaxies are more likely to exhibit patchy \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions (with a large dispersion in \ud835\udc43). High-mass galaxies have both extremely dusty star-forming regions and regions that are sufficiently far from sites of young star formation that are not enriched to the same extent, possibly due to the physically larger size of high-mass galaxies. The progression of higher to lower \ud835\udc4020 values (Equation 5) in the dust distribution of the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample suggests that the dustiest regions in low-mass galaxies exist in several isolated clumps, which then become more centrally concentrated as galaxies increase in stellar mass and metallicity. The resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution also exhibits high \ud835\udc3a in low-mass and low-metallicity galaxies, which is attributed to sites of star formation that enhance the dust reddening in a few isolated regions relative to the generally low \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 of the ISM. However, \ud835\udc3a is systematically higher at \u3008\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars\u3009 by definition (Equation 3). Therefore, these localized regions of higher dust opacities are, in fact, insignificant compared to the global \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution such that the dust distribution remains smooth overall. Since the Gini coefficient is only sensitive to values that are above the average of a distribution, \ud835\udc3a on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution becomes less sensitive as galaxies become dustier at higher stellar masses and metallicities (Section 3.3 and Figure 4). Overall, we propose that the dust formed through stellar evolutionary processes is mixed efficiently throughout the ISM of low-mass galaxies due to either uniformly distributed star-formation activity or their compact sizes. High-mass galaxies, on the other hand, have longer dust mixing timescales possibly due to their physically larger sizes. High-mass galaxies also produce significantly more dust than low-mass galaxies such that only the regions closest to the sites of dust production (star-forming regions) become enriched on short timescales. An illustration of the transition between a smooth to a more complex dust distribution as galaxies increase in stellar mass is shown in Figure 9. As sample sizes increase with the advent of statistically large resolved imaging surveys, galaxy morphology measurements must move away from visual classification and more towards quantitative metrics. We showed that using patchiness, Gini, and \ud835\udc4020 together was critical towards painting a complete picture of the resolved structures within galaxies. In particular, higher patchiness values were driven by the bluest regions in the dust reddening distribution of high-mass galaxies, thus emphasizing that void-like or darker regions within galaxies could reveal valuable information about galaxy structure. Resolved observations of high-redshift galaxies have also revealed that galaxy structure is increasingly irregular, which brings into question how the center of these galaxies should be definedwhen quantifying structure radially. Increasing the sample of high-redshift galaxies with resolved imaging and spectroscopy will further build\nupon the results of this paper, such as those that will be obtained using NIRCam and NIRSpec on the James Webb Space Telescope for galaxies out to \ud835\udc67 \u223c 6. These observations will further enable the construction of high-resolution stellar population, reddening, and emission line maps for high-redshift galaxies\u2014such as spatially resolved Balmer decrements\u2014and will reveal how galaxies assemble and evolve across cosmic time."

            "heading": "APPENDIX A: ANALYSIS OF THE PATCHINESS METRIC",
            "text": "In Section 3.1, we defined a morphology measure that is sensitive to both faint and bright regions within galaxies, called \u201cpatchiness\u201d (Equation 2). In this appendix, an in-depth analysis of the patchiness metric, \ud835\udc43, is presented using the patchiness calculated from the resolved \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, stellar population age, SFR, and stellar mass maps. This analysis of the patchiness metric includes: observed correlations between the calculated \ud835\udc43 of all resolved SED-derived properties; a comparison between \ud835\udc43 and the ICD (Papovich et al. 2003), Gini (Abraham et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2004), and \ud835\udc4020 (Lotz et al. 2004, 2008) morphology metrics; \ud835\udc43 calculated from the pixelscale distribution; the behavior of \ud835\udc43 when galaxies are artificially redshifted; and the potential dependence of \ud835\udc43 on the number of resolved elements. First, the calculated \ud835\udc43 on the resolved SED-derived \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, stellar population ages, SFRs, and stellar masses are directly compared in Figure A1. If a given galaxy exhibits a patchy distribution in any SED-derived property, it is likely to exhibit a patchy distribution in the other resolved stellar population properties. Most significantly, galaxies with patchier SFRs tend to have patchier stellar masses and galaxies with patchier \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distributions tend to have patchier stellar ages. While the relationship between the \ud835\udc43 of the resolved SFRs and stellar masses could provide clues as to how galaxies build their stellar mass in the context of the resolved SFR\u2013\ud835\udc40\u2217 relationship, the significance of this relationship could alternatively be explained by the covariance between SFR and stellar mass as both are derived from the normalization of the SEDmodel to the photometry. Similarly, the relationship between patchy reddening and stellar ages could be related to the age\u2013extinction degeneracy (e.g., Worthey 1994; Shapley et al. 2001), where the SED of an old, dust-free stellar population has a similar shape compared to the SED of a young, dusty stellar population. Of the pre-existingmorphologymetrics, patchiness is most closely related to the ICD (Papovich et al. 2003). The ICD measures deviations in color and, thus, is sensitive to the general dispersion in flux rather than exclusively the brightest regions. The primary advantage of patchiness compared to the ICD is that patchiness can be applied to any resolved property, whereas the ICD is limited to a single color (i.e., resolved imaging for two filters). Based on themethodology presented in Section 2.4, \ud835\udc43 calculated on the resolved stellar population and reddening maps incorporates information from at least 5 filters with resolved imaging. We measure the ICD using the \ud835\udc49606\u2013\ud835\udc3b160 color,12 which spans the Balmer/4000\u00c5 breaks and thus is expected to have some dependence on the dispersion in stellar population age and stellar mass. The ICD measured from the \ud835\udc49606\u2013\ud835\udc3b160 color is compared to the \ud835\udc43 calculated from the resolved stellar population properties in Figure A2 and is found to correlate most significantly with the \ud835\udc43 of the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars and stellar mass distribution, with a marginal correlation towards higher \ud835\udc43 measured from the stellar population age distribution.\n12 The \ud835\udc49606 and \ud835\udc3b160 filters are the bluest and reddest resolved filters, respectively, that were used to observe all of the galaxies in our sample.\nThroughout this paper we use patchiness alongside the previously defined Gini and \ud835\udc4020 coefficients (Abraham et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2004, 2008). Figure A3 shows how patchiness is related to \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc4020 when each of these morphology metrics are measured on the resolved SED-derived \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, stellar population ages, SFRs, and stellar masses. In all cases, \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc3a are significantly positively correlated, whereas there is no significant correlation between \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc4020. The correlation between \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc3a is attributed to both metrics being sensitive to the resolved components with the highest values relative to the average of the distribution, but \ud835\udc43 is additionally driven by regions with the lowest values relative to the average. While \ud835\udc4020 is similarly based on the highest values of a resolved distribution, \ud835\udc4020 is primarily sensitive to the spatial distribution of the highest valued regions and, thus, is not expected to be directly correlated with \ud835\udc43 or \ud835\udc3a. To examine the behavior of the patchiness metric on other resolved scales, patchiness is calculated on the pixel-to-pixel scale for a subset of 50 galaxies that have stellar population parameters that are representative of the larger sample. In the pixel-to-pixel patchiness calculation, all pixels identified by the 3D-HST segmentation map are included. Figure A4 shows how \ud835\udc43 measured on the pixel-to-pixel distribution compares to \ud835\udc43measured on the Voronoi bin distribution. The relative \ud835\udc43 calculated on the \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars distribution is generally preserved between a pixel and Voronoi bin scale and marginally preserved for \ud835\udc43 calculated on the stellar mass distribution. However, caution should be taken when measuring \ud835\udc43 on a pixel-to-pixel scale due to correlated signal between neighboring pixels and low S/N pixels that cause unphysical outliers in the resolved distribution that artificially drive \ud835\udc43 to higher values. Therefore, we discourage the use of the patchiness parameter on pixel-to-pixel scales. Alternatively, we recommend using a minimum bin size that is at least as large as the PSF and that low S/N components that can cause unreliable resolved measurements are removed from the analysis (also see Fetherolf et al. 2020). The effect of redshift on the patchiness metric is explored by artificially redshifting each of the galaxies in the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 sample (126 galaxies) to a redshift that is randomly selected from a Gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation of the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 sample (\ud835\udc67 = 2.30 \u00b1 0.14). For simplicity, the change in pixel scale between these redshifts is considered negligible and no correction is applied for the shift in the bandpass due to the largewidths of theHST filters. Cosmological dimming is applied bymultiplying the observed flux in each filter by the square of the ratio of luminosity distances at the two redshifts (Barden et al. 2008). The Voronoi binning and resolved SED fitting procedures are then repeated using the dimmed flux distributions. The artificially redshifted sample is restricted to galaxies with at least 5 Voronoi bins that have a S/N \u2265 5 in at least 5 filters (see Section 2.4), resulting in a subsample of 43 galaxies that have been artificially redshifted to \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3. The \ud835\udc43 measured from the artificially redshifted stellar population and reddening maps is compared to the original \ud835\udc43 measurements in Figure A5. Except in the case of the resolved SFRs, the ordering of \ud835\udc43 is generally not preserved when the effects of cosmological dimming are considered. Furthermore, there are intrinsic differences in the physical properties of galaxies between redshifts \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 (e.g., see recent reviews by Shapley 2011; Madau & Dickinson 2014). Therefore, we recommend using \ud835\udc43 only for relative comparisons of galaxies at similar redshifts and in uniformly defined sample selections (see Section 3.1). Finally, a possible dependence between \ud835\udc43 and the number of Voronoi bins in the galaxy is investigated through Figure A6. The \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 (left panels) and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples (right panels) are each\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\n101\n102\n103\nP {\nAg e}\n9.7 s = 0.49\n101\n102\n103\n104\nP {\nSF R}\n4.1 s = 0.23\n6.9 s = 0.36\n101 102 103 P {E(B-V)}\n100\n101\n102\n103\nP {\nM \u2217 }\n4.0 s = 0.22\n101 102 103 P {Age}\n8.7 s = 0.44\n101 102 103 104 P {SFR}\n14.0 s = 0.62\nFigure A1.

The yellow stars show the median \ud835\udc43 values in three equally sized bins that are based on the \ud835\udc43 measurement of the x-axis, with the yellow bars indicating the standard error in the median \ud835\udc43 values. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient and its significance is listed in the bottom right corner of each panel.\nsplit into two equally sized bins based on the number of Voronoi bins. Their distribution in \ud835\udc43 (blue and red histograms) and average \ud835\udc43 (vertical dashed lines) are shown for each stellar population property. While galaxies with more Voronoi bins (red histogram) tend to have higher \ud835\udc43 on average, the range of the distribution in \ud835\udc43 is either consistent or broader than the distribution of \ud835\udc43 for galaxies with fewer Voronoi bins (blue histogram). One exception is the distribution of \ud835\udc43 calculated from the resolved stellar mass (bottom right sub-panels of Figure A6), where galaxies with more Voronoi bins tend to have patchier stellar mass distributions while galaxies with fewer Voronoi bins have smoother stellar mass distributions. However, since this offset is not equivalently seen for all resolved stellar population properties, we suggest that the relationship between the number of resolved elements and the calculated \ud835\udc43 is physically driven\u2014especially regarding stellar mass. Furthermore, the number and size of Voronoi bins are defined by grouping regions of similar brightness (Cappellari & Copin 2003) and low S/N components that could artificially drive \ud835\udc43 towards higher values are not included in the analysis (see Section 2.4). Therefore, we conclude that the calculation of \ud835\udc43 is not systematically biased towards higher \ud835\udc43 when a galaxy contains more resolved elements.\nThe most important conclusions from this in-depth analysis on the patchiness metric are summarized as follows: 1) calculating \ud835\udc43 on the pixel-to-pixel distribution is not recommended due to unphysical low S/N outliers that could drive \ud835\udc43 towards higher values, 2) the \ud835\udc43 (and other morphology metrics) of galaxies at different redshifts should be analyzed separately, and 3) \ud835\udc43 is not dependent on the number of resolved elements within a given galaxy. These conclusions align with our recommendation to compare the relative \ud835\udc43 values of resolved distributions for galaxies within uniformly defined samples. The resolved distributions for the sample of galaxies used throughout this paper are uniformly defined by separating the \ud835\udc67 \u223c 1.5 and \ud835\udc67 \u223c 2.3 samples and applying a strict criteria for including resolved elements in the analysis (see Section 2.4). The findings in this appendix also highlight how the patchiness metric can be used on other resolved stellar population properties (besides \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35 \u2212\ud835\udc49)stars, which is the focus of this work).\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201325 (2022)\n10-2\n10-1\n100 s = 0.40 7.7\nE(B-V)\ns = 0.10 1.8\nAge\n101 102 103\n10-2\n10-1\n100 s = 0.07 1.2\nSFR 101 102 103\ns = 0.26 4.8\nM \u2217\nPatchiness\nIC D\n= (V\n60 6 \u2212 H\n1 60\n)\nFigure A2.
