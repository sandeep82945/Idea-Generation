    "abstractText": "TERT promoter mutations are a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM). Accordingly, TERT and GABPB1, a subunit of the upstream mutant TERT promoter transcription factor GABP, are being considered as promising therapeutic targets in GBM. We recently reported that the expression of TERT or GABP1 modulates flux via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here, we investigated whether 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized (HP) \u03b4\u2010 [1\u201013C]gluconolactone can serve to image the reduction in PPP flux following TERT or GABPB1 silencing. We investigated two different human GBM cell lines stably expressing shRNAs targeting TERT or GABPB1, as well as doxycycline\u2010 inducible shTERT or shGABPB1cells. MRS studies were performed on live cells and in vivo tumors, and dynamic sets of 13C MR spectra were acquired following injection of HP \u03b4\u2010[1\u201013C]gluconolactone. HP 6\u2010phosphogluconolactone (6PG), the product of \u03b4\u2010[1\u201013C]gluconolactone via the PPP, was significantly reduced in TERT or GABPB1\u2010silenced cells or tumors compared to controls in all our models. Furthermore, a positive correlation between TERT expression and 6PG levels was observed. Our data indicate that HP \u03b4\u2010[1\u201013C]gluconolactone, an imaging tool with translational potential, could serve to monitor TERT expression and its silencing with therapies that target either TERT or GABPB1 in mutant TERT promoter GBM patients.",

HP 6\u2011phosphogluconolactone (6PG), the product of \u03b4\u2011[1\u201113C]gluconolactone via the PPP, was significantly reduced in TERT or GABPB1\u2011silenced cells or tumors compared to controls in all our models. Furthermore, a positive correlation between TERT expression and 6PG levels was observed. Our data indicate that HP \u03b4\u2011[1\u201113C]gluconolactone, an imaging tool with translational potential, could serve to monitor TERT expression and its silencing with therapies that target either TERT or GABPB1 in mutant TERT promoter GBM patients.\nGlioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive and treatment-resistant malignant primary intracranial tumor with a very poor prognosis and median survival of 15\u00a0months. Upregulation of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) expression resulting from TERT promoter mutations is a prominent genetic hallmark of GBM, present in over 80% of GBM patients. As a result, TERT is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target1\u20134. Direct targeting of TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, can affect telomerase activity in normal and germ cells leading to bone marrow suppression and limiting the clinical application of TERT inhibitors2,5,6. However, the recent discovery of the TERT upstream transcriptional factor GA-binding protein (GABP) has identified an alternative approach for targeting TERT expression7,8. Because GABPB1 is a subunit of GABP, which binds to the mutant TERT promoter without interfering with the normal TERT promoter, GABPB1 is viewed as a tumorspecific therapeutic approach with potentially limited toxicity7\u201310. Furthermore, recent findings highlight the value of GABP targeting in increasing GBM susceptibility to DNA damage. This identifies the combination of GABP-targeting and classical DNA-damaging agents such as temozolomide as a synergetic therapeutic approach, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth in\u00a0vivo11. Another related finding discovered the EGFR, AMPK, GABP, and TERT axis in GBM, pointing to additional potential combination therapies for GBM12. Collectively, these findings motivated us to develop non-invasive imaging approaches to enable the detection of targeted TERT-silencing and response to therapy.\nPreviously, we demonstrated the effectiveness of 1H-MRS or 13C-MRS as useful approaches for assessing TERT or GABPB1-targeted therapies in GBM9. Specifically, we showed that 1H-MRS-detectable total steady-state lactate, as well as 13C-MRS-detectable lactate produced from hyperpolarized (HP) [1-13C]pyruvate, are both correlated with TERT expression. However, these metabolic alterations are not specific to TERT. Indeed, changes in\nOPEN\n1Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San Francisco, 1700 4th Street, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA. 2Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, USA. 3These authors contributed equally: Noriaki Minami and Donghyun Hong. *email: sabrina.ronen@ucsf.edu\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:5190 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32463-1\n13C-MRS-detected HP lactate production have been reported following chemotherapeutic treatments, radiation treatment, and PI3K inhibition13\u201317 and 1H-MRS total lactate levels are also affected by the presence of necrotic regions in GBM18. We, therefore, wanted to develop additional complementary imaging methods that can further help assess TERT expression and inhibition and enhance the specificity of our imaging.\nIn our previous study, we found that silencing TERT or GABPB1 in GBM also resulted in a consistent and significant reduction of NADPH and reduced glutathione (GSH). This was associated with a reduction in flux via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which is essential for the production of NADPH and the maintenance of GSH. In a separate study, HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone metabolism to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) was reported as a useful probe for monitoring PPP activity19. Furthermore, another recent study from our group reported that HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone crosses that blood\u2013brain barrier and provides a method to distinguish between GBM and normal contralateral brain with higher levels of 6PG detected in tumors20. Based on these previous findings, in the present study, we asked whether HP 13C MRS imaging of \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone metabolism can visualize TERT or GABPB1 modulation. We found that both in cells and orthotopic tumors in rats, silencing TERT expression either directly or upstream at the level of GABPB1 resulted in a significant drop in 6PG production, and 6PG levels were correlated with TERT expression in cells. This identifies another imaging method to monitor response to TERT or GABPB1 targeting therapy in GBM."

The PPP is an important source for the production of NADPH (Fig.\u00a01a), which is essential for the maintenance of cellular redox.

PGLS is also central for our HP 13C imaging method probing the fate of \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone20. In the case of U251 cells, we previously showed that the expression of PGLS and other enzymes of the PPP was reduced in TERT or GABPB1-silenced cells (U251shTERT or U251shB1)\u00a0compared to controls\u00a0(U251shCtrl)9. In the current study, we also assessed the expression of PGLS in our GS2-based model comparing TERT-expressing cells to cells in which TERT expression was silenced by shRNA targeting of either TERT or GABPB1, and in U251cells with doxycycline-inducible TERT or GABPB1 expression (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013 e). We also assessed the expression of the other PPP pathway enzymes G6PD and PGD in our models (Fig.\u00a01f\u2013i) comparing TERT or GABPB1 silenced cells to controls. Consistent with our previous results in the U251 cell model9, we found that whenever TERT was silenced either directly or via GABPB1-targeting, the expression of all the PPP enzymes was reduced. Most importantly, the enzyme central to our HP 13C-MRS approach, PGLS, was reduced whenever TERT expression was reduced. The dysregulation of PPP enzymes in TERT or GABPB1 silenced cells was also associated, as expected, with a significant reduction in NADPH levels that are produced via the PPP, and therefore the NADPH/NADP+ ratio in all of our models was significantly reduced when TERT was silenced (Fig.\u00a01j and k).\nIn our previous work9 we had also found that the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 is reduced in TERT-silenced cells. Importantly, GLUT1 is also responsible for the transport of gluconolactone into the cell, and can therefore affect HP gluconolactone metabolism to 6PG. We therefore also assessed the expression of GLUT1 in our GS2-based model and in U251 cells with doxycycline-inducible TERT or GABPB1 expression. Consistent with our previous data in the U251 model, we found that TERT silencing led to a drop in GLUT1 expression in every case (Fig.\u00a01l and m).\nHP 13C\u20116PG can detect the effect of stable TERT or GABPB1 silencing. HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone was described as a method to monitor PGLS activity in the liver19 and brain20. Based on our finding that PGLS is dysregulated by TERT or GABPB1 silencing, we, therefore, questioned whether the change in PGLS expression, as well as other PPP enzymes and GLUT1, that result from targeting of TERT or GABPB1 could also be monitored using HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone.\nFigure\u00a02.

As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, both metabolites were clearly detected in the 13C spectral array of U251shCtrl cells following injection of HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone. In line with previous studies20, \u03b3-[1-13C]gluconolactone, which is in rapid equilibrium with \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone in the aqueous phase, was also observed. Next, we compared HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone metabolism between control and TERT-silenced cells. The temporal evolution of [1-13C]6PG normalized to total gluconolactone showed that [1-13C]6PG levels were suppressed in U251shTERT as well as in U251shB1 cells compared to U251shCtrl (Fig.\u00a02b), and accordingly the quantified AUC of [1-13C]6PG normalized to total [1-13C]gluconolactone was significantly reduced in U251shTERT and U251shB1 compared to U251shCtrl (Fig.\u00a02c). We also investigated the relationship between TERT expression and relative 6PG production levels. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a02d, although the distribution of points is somewhat limited due to the limited variability in TERT expression in our cells, we observed a correlation between TERT expression and 6PG levels (R2 = 0.9056; p < 0.0001).\nSimilar results were also obtained when performing the same experiments and comparing GS2shCtrl, GS2shTERT, and GS2shB1 cells. Again, 6PG levels normalized to total gluconolactone in GS2shCtrl cells were significantly higher than those of GS2shTERT or GS2shB1. A positive correlation between relative 6PG and TERT expression was also observed (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d).\nHP 13C\u20116PG can detect the effect of rapid TERT or GABPB1 silencing. Next, we asked whether acute silencing can be rapidly detected by monitoring HP 6PG production. To address this question, we examined two U251 models with doxycycline-inducible shRNA: U251 expressing doxycycline-inducible shTERT (U251doxshTERT), and U251 expressing doxycycline-inducible shGABPB1 (U251doxshB1). First, we confirmed that the expression of TERT was significantly reduced by doxycycline and rescued by the removal of doxycycline in both U251doxshTERT and U251doxshB1 (Fig.\u00a04a and b). Next, we assessed the fate of HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone by comparing controls (doxycycline-free, dox(\u00a0\u2212)), to cells exposed to doxycycline for 72\u00a0h (dox( +)) and cells 72\u00a0h after doxycycline removal (dox_off). As illustrated in Fig.\u00a04c and d, [1-13C]6PG production was clearly suppressed by acute silencing of TERT and GABPB1. Importantly, following doxycycline removal, [1-13C]6PG levels recovered. The AUC of [1-13C]6PG normalized to the maximum total [1-13C]gluconolactone confirmed\nFigure\u00a03.

Collectively, HP 13C-6PG imaging can therefore visualize acute TERT or GABPB1 silencing and rescue in our cell models.\nIn vivo HP 13C\u20116PG imaging can clearly visualize TERT or GABPB1 silencing in vivo. After confirmation of the utility of HP [1-13C]6PG for assessing TERT expression in live cells, our next step was to assess whether we could observe changes in TERT expression after TERT or GABPB1 targeting in preclinical in\u00a0vivo tumor models.\nFirst, we probed in\u00a0vivo tumors formed in rat brains from stably expressing shRNA cell lines, U251shCtrl, U251shTERT, and U251shB. Typically, it took 4\u20136\u00a0weeks to get tumors large enough for the HP MRS data acquisition (> 0.27\u00a0 mm3). Our dynamic HP 13C EPSI data set (Fig.\u00a05a), as well as sum spectra over time (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1), clearly indicated that [1-13C]6PG production is attenuated in U251shTERT and U251shB1 tumors compared to U251shCtrl, reflecting TERT silencing. Quantification of the dynamic 6PG normalized to the maximum total gluconolactone showed that, as expected, the differences between U251shCtrl and U251shTERT tumors as well as U251shCtrl and U251shB1 tumors are significant (Fig.\u00a05b and c). We also compared our\nFigure\u00a04. (a) TERT expression comparing dox(\u00a0\u2212), dox( +), and dox_off for U251doxshTERT cells.

In fact, the difference between tumor and contralateral brain observed here was greater than observations made in another brain tumor model20 possibly reflecting the larger size and greater substrate uptake in our tumor models.\nTo further confirm our findings and determine whether therapeutic TERT silencing is likely to be rapidly detected in\u00a0vivo, we also investigated rats implanted with U251 cells expressing doxycycline-inducible shRNAs. We then compared our tumors prior to exposure to doxycycline (dox(\u00a0\u2212)), following exposure to doxycycline for 7\u00a0days (dox( +)), and 14\u00a0days after the last day of doxycycline exposure (dox_off, n = 1). The dynamic HP 13C EPSI data set of [1-13C]6PG normalized to total gluconolactone revealed that 6PG production was reduced by inducible knockdown of TERT via doxycycline in a similar manner to the drop observed when comparing the stable\u00a0U251shTERT, U251shB1, and U251shCtrl (Figs.\u00a06a and 7a). Quantification of 6PG confirmed a significant decrease in relative 6PG levels in tumors wherein TERT or GABPB1 was modulated by exposure to doxycycline dox( +) (Figs.\u00a06b,c and 7b,c). Removal of doxycycline in a single animal that survived also showed a return of 6PG levels to those observed pre-doxycycline exposure (see Fig.\u00a06a, data not included in Fig.\u00a06c due to lack of statistical significance).\nFinally, we also performed a small-scale study on GS2 tumors investigating two GS2shCtrl tumors and one each of GS2shTERT and GS2shB1 tumors in order to validate the results of U251 tumors in a patient-derived model. As expected, quantified 6PG again showed a decrease when TERT or GABPB1 was silenced (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2a\u2013c).\nFigure\u00a05.

            "text": "TERT promoter mutations are a hallmark of glioblastoma, enabling TERT expression, telomerase activity and telomere maintenance. Accordingly, TERT and its upstream transcriptional factor GABP are emerging therapeutic targets. Most notably, targeting the GABPB1 subunit is considered a promising approach because GABP is expected to only impact the mutant TERT promoter without affecting wild-type TERT. As a result, inhibiting GABPB1 would likely have a limited impact on normal proliferating cells and thus potentially limited toxicity8. Furthermore, and as mentioned above, recent research has revealed that GABP inhibition increases the susceptibility of GBM to DNA damage, pointing to the potential of combining GABP targeting with traditional DNA damaging agents such as temozolomide for enhanced treatment of GBM11. The recent finding of signaling from EGFR via AMPK to GABP and TERT also suggests the possibility of a combination EGFR and GABP targeting as another therapeutic strategy for GBM12. Collectively, these recent reports highlight the need for early noninvasive imaging biomarkers of response to TERT silencing in order to achieve better precision medicine for glioblastoma patients.\nWe previously demonstrated the utility of GSH and lactate in the 1H-MRS spectrum, as well as HP lactate production detected by 13C-MRS, as biomarkers for TERT-positive glioma and TERT modulation by TERT or GABP silencing. This observation was associated with an overall modulation by TERT of glucose uptake, glycolytic flux, and flux via the PPP. Here we further confirmed that the expression of PPP enzymes and NADPH/NADP+ are significantly decreased by TERT or GABPB1 silencing in additional models. In addition, and importantly, we also show that inhibition of the PPP when TERT is silenced can also be noninvasively imaged by probing HP 6PG production using 13C-MRS imaging. This finding identifies an additional and complementary approach for noninvasively detecting TERT or GABPB1 silencing, likely enhancing the specificity of our observations.\nIn this study, we investigated both cells that stably express shRNAs that target TERT or GABPB1, and cells in which shRNA targeting of TERT or GABPB1 is rapidly induced by doxycycline. All these models retained TERT promoter mutations that recruit GABP to activate TERT expression. When comparing the contralateral brain to the tumor, and in line with our prior work20, we consistently observed higher levels of 6PG in the tumor.\nFigure\u00a06.

(c) The AUC of [1-13C]6PG comparing U251doxshTERT tumors prior to (dox(\u00a0\u2212)) and following (dox( +)) doxycycline.\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:5190 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32463-1\nFurthermore, when TERT was silenced, either rapidly following doxycycline addition, or in a sustained fashion due to stable shRNA expression, we found that upstream GLUT1 levels and downstream PPP enzyme levels were all reduced. This led to a drop in 6PG production in both cells and in\u00a0vivo tumors. These observations confirm the association between TERT, enzymes that control gluconolactone uptake and its PPP flux, and HP 6PG production, and highlight the likely value of HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone imaging as an early indicator of response to TERT-targeted treatment. Indeed, we also observed a significant positive correlation between TERT and HP 6PG production in our cells. This suggests that we could potentially estimate relative TERT expression levels and further points to the value of our imaging approach for early detection of response to TERT or GABPB1targeting as well as the development of resistance.\nAnother HP 13C probe that could be used to monitor both the glycolytic pathway and the PPP is HP glucose, previously shown as a useful method for monitoring metabolism in lymphoma, lung, and brain tumors21,22. However, HP glucose has a relatively short T1 relaxation time (9.5\u00a0s at 3\u00a0 T22,23) when compared to gluconolactone (32\u00a0s at 3\u00a0 T20) potentially limiting the detection of metabolic products. Importantly, gluconolactone and glucose use the same GLUT transporter to enter the cell19,20,24 and gluconolactone is being used as a food additive and is therefore unlikely to show significant toxicity25. Translation of HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone to monitor metabolism in patients has not been demonstrated to date, nonetheless this study, combined with prior work, point to the value of monitoring PPP flux in patients.\nWhen considering clinical imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) is commonly used to assess disease in cancer patients. Previous preclinical studies have reported PET or radioactive antisense oligonucleotides to image TERT26, however, to date, no clinical translation of these methods has been reported. In contrast, some recent studies have used T2-weighted, perfusion, and diffusion MRI images combined with radiomics to detect IDH and TERT promoter status27\u201330. Combining our MR metabolic imaging approaches with these MRI-based and advanced machine learning methods could further enhance the value of noninvasive MR-based personalized imaging for GBM patients.\nIn summary, our study identified 13C-MRS-detectable HP 6PG produced from HP gluconolactone as a metabolic biomarker of TERT and its silencing in human GBM with TERT promoter mutations, adding another translatable biomarker to the armamentarium of imaging tools that can help improve the monitoring of targeted therapies and personalized treatment of GBM patients, and more broadly any cancer patients for whom TERT might be considered a therapeutic target.\nFigure\u00a07.

TERT or GABPB1 silencing for U251 or GS2 was achieved by shRNA transduction as previously described (U251shCtrl, U251shTERT, U251GABPB1, GS2shCtrl, GS2shTERT, and GS2shB1)9. Cells were maintained in a 37\u2103 incubator at 5% CO2. U251 cells were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2\u00a0mM glutamine, and 100U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. GS2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM glutamine, and 100U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. Doxycycline-inducible shRNA cell lines (U251doxshtrl, U251doxshTERT, U251doxshB1) were generated as previously described9. These cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, 11330-032) supplemented as above. To silence TERT expression, cells were exposed to 500\u00a0ng/mL doxycycline for 72\u00a0h prior to HP 13C-MRS experiments, and to turn TERT back on cells were cultured without doxycycline for another 72\u00a0h. All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination and authenticated by short tandem repeat fingerprinting within 6\u00a0months of any experiment.\nRT\u2011qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells by using Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and portions of (1000\u00a0ng) RNA were subjected to reverse transcription using High-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR analysis was performed with POWER SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System for Human Identification, 96 well. 0.2\u00a0mL, desktop (Applied Biosystems).

In line with previous studies, \u03b3-[113C] gluconolactone, which is in rapid equilibrium with \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone in the aqueous phase, was also observed in our spectra and therefore 6PG levels were normalized to maximum total gluconolactone (sum of \u03b3 and \u03b4 \u2013[1-13C]gluconolactone peaks)19,20.\nIn vivo tumor models. All animal studies were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Use and Care Regulations and approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; approval AN181313). All procedures were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (https:// arriv eguid elines. org/). Every effort was made to minimize the number of animals investigated and a total number of 26 animals was used in this study. Animals were investigated until euthanasia was necessary per IACUC guidelines. Investigators were not blinded. Male RH-Foxn1rnu rats weighing 150\u2013200\u00a0g and aged 7\u20138\u00a0weeks (Envigo IN) were used for in\u00a0vivo tumor studies.

To turn TERT back on, animals were returned to doxycycline-free normal conditions for 14\u00a0days.\nHP 13C\u2011MRS in vivo. All measurements were performed on a 3\u00a0 T preclinical scanner (Bruker, Germany), equipped with a quadrature 1H-13C volume coil (Neos-Biotech, Spain). Tumor growth was monitored via T2-weighted images acquired using a multi-slice spin-echo sequence with the following parameters: echo time (TE) = 64\u00a0ms, repetition time (TR) = 3484\u00a0ms, matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, resolution = 0.13 \u00d7 0.13 mm2, slice thickness = 1\u00a0mm, and the number of averages = 5. Once tumors reached approximately 0.27 cm3, we acquired HP 13C MRS data assessing HP [1-13C]6PG production from gluconolactone as follows. HP 13C studies were performed following injection of 2.5\u00a0ml of HP \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone via a tail-vein catheter over 12\u00a0s. Data were acquired using a spectral-spatial echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) sequence with a spatial resolution of 5.375 \u00d7 5.375 \u00d7 8 mm3 (TR = 3\u00a0s/NR = 20/flip angles = 15.2\u00b0 on 6PG, 12\u00b0 on \u03b3-[1-13C]gluconolactone, and 3.4\u00b0 on \u03b4-[1-13C]gluconolactone)23,31. For the EPSI data, the SNR of each voxel spectrum at every time point was improved using the tensor denoising23,31, and spectra were analyzed by determining the area under the curve (AUC) and 6PG normalized to the maximum total gluconolactone as above. All post-processing and quantification procedures were performed using an in-house Matlab (Mathworks, MA) script.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:5190 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32463-1\nStatistical analysis. All studies were repeated 3\u00a0 times unless otherwise stated. All results represent mean \u00b1 SD. Either a student\u2019s t-test assuming unequal variance for two-group comparisons or an ordinary one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons, were used to assess the statistical significance of differences with p < 0.05 considered significant (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, **** = p < 0.0001)."
