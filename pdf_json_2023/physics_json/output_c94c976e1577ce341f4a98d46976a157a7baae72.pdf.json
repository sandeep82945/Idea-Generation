    "abstractText": "The widespread usage of Schiff bases in chemistry, industry, medicine, and pharmacy has increased interest in these compounds. Schiff bases and derivative compounds have important bioactive properties. Heterocyclic compounds containing phenol derivative groups in their structure have the potential to capture free radicals that can cause diseases. In this study, we designed and synthesized eight Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16\u201317), which contain phenol moieties and have the potential to be used as synthetic antioxidants, for the first time using microwave energy. Additionally, the antioxidant effects of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16\u201317) were studied using by the bioanalytical methods of 2,2\u2019-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline6-sulfonic acid) cation radical (ABTS\u2022+) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH\u2022) scavenging activities, and Fe3+, Cu2+, and Fe3+-TPTZ complex reducing capacities. In the context of studies on antioxidants, Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16\u201317) were found to be as powerful DPPH (IC50: 12.15\u201399.01 \u03bcg/mL) and ABTS\u2022+ (IC50: 4.30\u201334.65 \u03bcg/mL). Additionally, the inhibition abilities of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16\u201317) were determined towards some metabolic enzymes including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and human carbonic anhydrase I and II (hCAs I and II), enzymes that are linked to some global disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), epilepsy, and glaucoma. In the context of studies on enzyme inhibition, it was observed that the synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16\u201317) inhibited AChE, BChE, hCAs I, and hCA II enzymes with IC50 values in ranges of 16.11\u201357.75 nM, 19.80\u201353.31 nM, 26.08 \u00b1 8.53 nM, and 85.79 \u00b1 24.80 nM, respectively. In addition, in light of the results obtained, we hope that this study will be useful and guiding for the evaluation of biological activities in the fields of the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries in the future.",

            "text": "Excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals in living metabolism can cause cell death by damaging many cellular biomolecules, especially nucleic acids, membrane lipids, and proteins. On the other hand, antioxidants neutralize free radicals and effectively terminate radical chain reactions [1,2]. Hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022), superoxide anion radicals (O2\u2022\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and singlet oxygen (1O2) can be considered the most common ROS. They are formed as a result of normal metabolic functions of the body or as a result of physical and mental stress. Additionally, radiations, organic solvents, pesticides, and cigarette smoke are thought to be exogenous sources of ROS and free radical sources [3].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030779 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779 2 of 17\nAntioxidants protect living organisms from hazardous effects of ROS by reducing the generation of free radicals. In addition, ROS and free radicals have been reported to be responsible for many global diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, cardiovascular, and age-related diseases [4]. In this regard, it is critical to avoid or delay the development of ROS that cause a various of health problems. In living organisms, antioxidant defense mechanisms prevent the formation of ROS and reduce their cellular damage [5]. Nowadays, the most commonly used synthetic antioxidants are butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and propyl gallate (PG). They are added to food products during processing, thereby increasing the resistance of food to degradation and extending its shelf life. However, it has been reported that there are findings about serious health problems of synthetic antioxidants such as liver toxicity [6,7]. Therefore, this situation has recently led researchers to the synthesis of more alternative and safer antioxidant compounds. In previous studies, it has been reported that antioxidant molecules inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes, which are linked to some common diseases including epilepsy, glaucoma, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [8]. Recently, Schiff bases and their derivatives have attracted the attention of researchers [9,10]. It is well-known that ROS and free radicals alter the structure of human cells, causing various diseases such as cancer, neurological problems, AD, and diabetes. Of these, AD is a common neurological disease that progresses with rapid behavioral change with memory loss, forgetfulness, and impaired cognition and language [11\u201314]. An important side effect of AD pathology is the lack of cholinergic neurons in the brain of AD patients [15,16]. Therefore, the activation of cholinergic receptors is an attractive and highly important therapeutic possibility for AD. This option can be achieved by inhibiting the ACh degradation using AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) such as donepezil, tacrine, and rivastigmine, which are approved for the treatment of AD [17]. It is well-known that most AChEIs have undesired side effects such as gastrointestinal anomalies, diarrhea, nausea, and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, Tacrine is no longer used due to the emergence of hepatotoxicity effects [18]. AChEIs are the most-prescribed drug classes for AD treatment. Therefore, the search for new and undesired side effect-free cholinesterase inhibitors has become a necessity in the pharmaceutical field [19,20]. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, E.C.4.2.1.1) catalyze the conversion between CO2 and HCO3\u2212 for generating a H+ and pH regulating. To date, eight distinct CA families (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03b8, and t-CAs) are known. Of these, humans only have \u03b1-CAs, which have sixteen CA isoforms [21]. These isoenzymes differ in cellular localization, oligomeric structure, distribution in organs and tissues, affinity for inhibition, kinetic and molecular properties, and expression levels. CA inhibitors (CAIs) have been designed to obtain diuretic, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, and antitumor agents. They have drug potential for many biochemical and pharmacological applications [22,23]. CA II isozyme inhibition is associated with a variety of tumors, including kidney, lung, and esophageal cancers, melanoma, and glaucoma disease [24,25]. Heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen atoms have various biological properties. Schiff bases as a crucial class of heterocyclic compounds show anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, antimalarial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities [26,27]. These chemicals are significant in the synthesis of many physiologically and medically active substances. Schiff bases and derivatives are also known as important intermediates for the synthesis of N-containing heterocyclic substances. They are commonly represented by the R-CH=N-Ar formula [28,29]. Schiff bases are commonly found in the structure of naturally occurring products. They have an important role in synthesis and pharmaceutical research. The chemical structures of some pharmacologically active Schiff bases are given in Figure 1.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779 3 of 17\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17\nThey are commonly represented by the R-CH=N-Ar formula [28,29]. Schiff bases are commonly found in the structure of naturally occurring products. They have an important role in synthesis and pharmaceutical research. The chemical structures of some pharmacologically active Schiff bases are given in Figure 1.\nImine structures have drug potential for diseases caused by free radical damage due to their antioxidant abilities [30]. When the literature is reviewed, it is seen that Schiff bases exhibit antioxidant ability by removing ROS [31]. Additionally, the connection between the chemical structures of Schiff bases and their antioxidant ability is well established [32]. Additionally, Schiff bases and derivatives containing the azomethine group (\u2013 N=CH\u2013) have different applications. Therefore, they are of great interest due to their potential biological properties, including their antioxidant effects. Heterocyclic structures containing imine and phenol groups have ROS and free radical scavenging abilities. Therefore, they have potential to be used as a medicine against some diseases induced by oxidative stress [30]. Among the chemicals that can be utilized as synthetic antioxidants, Schiff bases have a significant role and potentials. By reviewing the literature, we observed that many studies have been carried out on the antioxidant ability of Schiff bases. They are conventionally obtained through the heat treatment of ketones or aldehydes with amine compounds under acidic conditions. With the latest developments in chemistry, alternative assays have been searched and utilized for the synthesis of Schiff bases [33]. Scientists have synthesized many new and chemical compounds using the heating method. However, this method generally takes a long time and increases chemical consumption and costs [34]. The use of microwave energy has become an appreciated and popular topic in synthetic organic chemistry. The use of this energy in experiments after the 1980s has brought great benefits in organic synthesis [35]. This technique has many advantages over the classical techniques. It reduces the formation of by-products and the evaporation of solvents, shortens the reaction time, and the reactions result in higher yields [36]. Recently, increasing studies on Schiff bases and the antioxidant activity of these bases encouraged us to carry out this study. In this work, we synthesized eight Schiff bases and hydrazineylidene derivatives (10\u201317) containing phenol rings using microwave irradiation (Scheme 1). Another important goal of this study is to examine the antioxidant abilities of these compounds. For this purpose, isovanillin (1) and different amine compounds\ni re 1. i l tr ct res f so e har acological y active Schif bases.\nI ine structures have drug potential for diseases caused by free radical da age due to their antioxidant abilities [30].

Therefore, oxidative stress and ROS pose significant risks for many chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, immunodeficiency syndrome, age-related pathologies, arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and obesity [52]. Antioxidants eliminate undesirable harmful effects of ROS and free radicals even at low concentrations. Additionally, they reduce oxidative stresses in the human body or food systems and prevent harmful effects of ROS [53]. There are many methods for the determination of the antioxidant effectiveness of newly synthesized molecules. In this study, we selected putative and prominent methods including ABTS\u2022+ and DPPH\u2022 scavenging activity, and Fe3+, Fe2+-TPTZ complex, and Cu2+reducing abilities. The reduction potentials of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) were realized with three different reduction assays. In this study, Fe3+ reducing by compounds (10\u201317) led to the formation of an Fe4[Fe(CN)6] complex, which demonstrated absorbance at 700 nm [53]. In this way, Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) can have reducing capabilities, and neutralize free radicals and ROS. As shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1A, Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) exhibited a potent Fe3+ reducing ability. However, the Fe3+ reducing effect of 30 \u00b5g/mL Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) and standards were ordered as 10 (2.827 \u00b1 0.016, r2: 0.9912) > 14 (2.741 \u00b1 0.026, r2: 0.9989) > 11 (2.591 \u00b1 0.010, r2: 0.9822) > BHA (2.448 \u00b1 0.021, r2: 0.9984) > 17 (2.391 \u00b1 0.037, r2: 0.9959) > BHT (1.994 \u00b1 0.033, r2: 0.9932) > Trolox (1.570 \u00b1 0.016, r2: 0.9915) > \u03b1-Tocopherol (1.446 \u00b1 0.009, r2: 0.9665) > 15 (0.363 \u00b1 0.021, r2: 0.9748) > 16 (0.311 \u00b1 0.018, r2: 0.9839) > 12 (0.294 \u00b1 0.008, r2: 0.9742) > 8 (0.244 \u00b1 0.005, r2: 0.9632) > 13 (0.198 \u00b1 0.004, r2: 0.9611).

However, the lowest reducing activity was observed in Schiff base 13, which contained a bromo group.

As in Fe3+ reduction, in this reduction method, the highest reducing activity was exhibited by 11, and the lowest reducing activity was shown by 15. The presence of -OH groups in phenolic rings increases the reducing activity properties of compounds [1]. Aside from Fe3+ and Cu2+ reduction properties, the Fe3+-TPTZ reducing ability of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) was studied, and is summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1C. Additionally, a positive correlation was displayed between the reducing abilities and used concentrations (10\u201330 \u00b5g/mL). At 30 \u00b5g/mL, the Fe3+-TPTZ ability of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) and standards declined in the following order (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1B): 11 (2.183\u00b1 0.016, r2: 0.9921) > BHA (2.156\u00b1 0.005, r2: 0.9565) > 17 (2.121 \u00b1 0.014, r2: 0.9815) > 10 (2.076 \u00b1 0.004, r2: 0.9897) \u2248 14 (2.074 \u00b1 0.017, r2: 0.9917) > Trolox (2.051 \u00b1 0.028, r2: 0.9931) > BHT (2.037 \u00b1 0.027, r2: 0.9782) > \u03b1-Tocopherol (1.763 \u00b1 0.026, r2: 0.9828 > 16 (1.069 \u00b1 0.057, r2: 0.9897) > 12 (0.806 \u00b1 0.003, r2: 0.9569) > 8 (0.728 \u00b1 0.020, r2: 0.9561) > 13 (0.701 \u00b1 0.003, r2: 0.9648) > 15 (0.646 \u00b1 0.034, r2: 0.9523). Like other reduction tests, this is low-cost, rapid, stable, and selective for pure compounds, regardless of hydrophobicity and chemical ingredient. There are many radical scavenging ability methods for the evaluation of the antioxidant power of pure and newly synthesized compounds. In this study, we selected two putative and common methods including DPPH\u2022scavenging and ABTS\u2022+ scavenging activities. Additionally, as given in Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2A, Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) demonstrated statistically significant effective DPPH radical ability (p < 0.01). The DPPH radical activity of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) and positive controls increased depending on increased Schiff base (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivative (16 and 17) concentrations. The half maximal scavenging concentration (IC50) of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) and standards toward DPPH radicals increased in the following\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779 10 of 17\norder: 15 (IC50: 99.010 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9980) < 13 (IC50: 87.721 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9922) < 8 (IC50: 86.625 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9989) < 12 (IC50: 57.750 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9998) < 16 (IC50: 30.130 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9723) < 10 (IC50: 16.902 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9687 < 17 (IC50: 14.744 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9874) < 14 (IC50: 13.860 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9629) < BHT (IC50: 13.326 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9734) < Trolox (IC50: 12.157 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9645)\u2248 11 (IC50: 12.157 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9636) < BHA (IC50: 11.550 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9690) < \u03b1-Tocopherol (IC50: 10.043 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9760). The results demonstrated that the DPPH radical activity of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) was close to the standards. However, the most powerful DPPH radical scavenging value was calculated for 11 (IC50: 12.157 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9636), which is similar to Trolox (IC50: 12.157 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9645) and lower than BHA (IC50: 11.550 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9690) and \u03b1-Tocopherol (IC50: 10.043 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9760). As an example of the radical scavenging mechanism for Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17), the proposed radical scavenging mechanism of molecule 14 is given in Scheme 2.\nAll the synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) displayed in vitro inhibition effects against cytosolic hCA I, which is associated with cerebral and retinal edema, hCA II, which is associated with edema, glaucoma, epilepsy, and mountain sickness, and AChE and BChE, which have been linked with AD for their inhibition efficacy. Mountain sickness is a disease that affects mountaineers or travelers at high altitudes who do not have enough time to acclimatize to altitudes above 2400 m [56,57]. They often develop symptoms including headaches, appetite loss, nausea, poor sleep, gastrointestinal distress, and general malaise due to low oxygen levels. In some cases, mountain sickness can cause brain edema and even death. The CA inhibitory effects of the Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) were determined using an esterase assay [53] and compared to acetazolamide (AZA). For the determination of the synthesized Schiff bases\u2019 (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives\u2019 (16 and 17) action towards AChE and BChE, Ellman\u2019s procedure [45] was employed, and compared to the standard inhibitor of Tacrine. Further, the following insights can be gleaned from the studied enzyme inhibition results given in Tables 3 and 4. The synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) exhibited effective inhibition profiles against widespread cytosolic hCA I isozyme with Ki values ranging from 26.08 \u00b1 8.53 nM to 85.79 \u00b1 24.80 nM. Isovanilin (1), as our starting material, showed a lesser inhibition profile (Ki: 112.30 \u00b1 25.75 nM) when compared to the synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17). However, within this series, the compounds (E/Z)-5-(((4-aminophenyl)imino)methyl)-2-methoxyphenol (14) were found to be the best inhibitor (Ki: 26.08 \u00b1 8.53 nM) towards cytosolic hCA I isozyme in comparison with AZA (Ki: 35.39 \u00b1 9.01 nM). However, the compounds 17, 13, and 14 showed stronger inhibition ability than AZA. Common to all hCA isomers of the \u03b1-CA family is a highly conserved active site, which a Zn2+ ion coordinated by His94, His96, and His119 residues and an H2O molecule. Most hCA inhibitors have been identified as Zn2+-binding molecules. Overexpression of the hCA I isozyme has been associated with cerebral and retinal edema, while the hCA II isoform has been associated with altitude sickness, glaucoma, and epilepsy [58].\nThe ABTS\u2022+ scavenging assay was used for the radical removing ability of the compounds. As shown in Supplementary Figure S2B and Table 1, t e results demonstrate that Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) had higher ABTS\u2022+ scavenging ability as follows: 13 (IC50: 34.650 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9901) < 15 (IC50: 23.896 \u00b5g/mL;\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779 11 of 17\nr2: 0.9979) < 12 (IC50: 27.720 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9982) < 10 (IC50: 14.437 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9767 < 8 (IC50: 12.157 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9549) < 16 (IC50: 11.745 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9838) < \u03b1-Tocopherol (IC50: 9.493 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9889) < 14 (IC50: 5.330 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9498) < BHT (IC50: 4.950 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9633) < Trolox (IC50: 4.846 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9769) < BHA (IC50: 4.470 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9702) < 11 (IC50: 4.386 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9701) < 17 (IC50: 4.304 \u00b5g/mL; r2: 0.9711). The low IC50 values reflect effective ABTS\u2022+ scavenging ability [55]. All the synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) displayed in vitro inhibition effects against cytosolic hCA I, which is associated with cerebral and retinal edema, hCA II, which is associated with edema, glaucoma, epilepsy, and mountain sickness, and AChE and BChE, which have been linked with AD for their inhibition efficacy.

Isovanilin (1), as our starting material, showed a lesser inhibition profile (Ki: 112.30\u00b1 25.75 nM) when compared to the synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17).

Most hCA inhibitors have been identified as Zn2+-binding molecules. Overexpression of the hCA I isozyme has been associated with cerebral and retinal edema, while the hCA II isoform has been associated with altitude sickness, glaucoma, and epilepsy [58]. All synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) inhibited cytosolic and dominant hCA II isozyme with Kis of 67.59\u00b1 15.70\u2013164.72\u00b1 29.46 nM. Among them, the compound of (E)-5-(((4-bromophenyl)imino)methyl)-2-methoxyphenol (13) showed important inhibition effects towards hCA II with a Ki of 67.59 \u00b1 15.70 nM. However, the inhibition profiles of all synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) were found to be lower than AZA (Ki: 16.60 \u00b1 1.29 nM). Additionally, the selectivity index (hCA I/hCA II) for both hCA isoenzymes shows that the synthesized substances have a higher affinity for the hCA I isozyme than hCA II isoforms. However, the rest of the Schiff bases demonstrated moderate inhibition of ubiquitous and dominant cytosolic hCA II isoenzyme. The AChE inhibition abilities of Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) were given for the first time in this study. The results are presented and summarized in Table 4. Tacrine was used as positive control for AChE inhibition with a Ki of 68.6 \u00b1 3.8 nM towards AChE enzyme. As presented in Table 4, IC50 values of all the Schiff bases (17\u201324) were in the range of 16.11 to 57.75 nM towards AChE. The inhibition results showed by most of synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) had higher inhibitory effects than the TAC (IC50: 46.20 nM). Additionally, BChE was highly inhibited by the Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17), with IC50s in the range of 19.80 to 53.31 nM (Table 4). These results clearly show that the synthesized Schiff bases (10\u201315) and hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) displayed effective BChE inhibition abilities. However, the most powerful BChE inhibition was observed for (E)-2-methoxy-5-((2-phenylhydrazineylidene)methyl)phenol (17) with an IC50 value of 19.80 nM. For comparison, Tacrine, the first centrally acting BChE inhibitor, exhibited an IC50 of 24. 75 nM (r2: 0.9878) against BChE enzyme. Tacrine has been removed from the market due to some undesirable side effects, especially hepatotoxicity, in a significant number of patients [58]."

            "text": "In this study, the synthesis of Schiff bases using the microwave method, and their antioxidant capacity and some metabolic enzyme inhibition properties were reported for the first time. Here, six Schiff bases (10\u201315) and two hydrazineylidene derivatives (16 and 17) were synthesized using an environmentally friendly methodology. A simple, efficient, and fast method was applied for synthesis that does not include solvents or catalysts. Compared to other methods, microwave irradiation is the simplest and cheapest way to synthesize novel Schiff bases. Schiff bases are an important class of organic compounds that are commonly used and researched due to their unique structural properties and biological activities. Additionally, they have numerous applications, especially in biochemistry and medicine [59]. It is known that Schiff bases have received great attention due to their many biological and pharmaceutical activities [60] such as antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, antibacterial, antimalarial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities and enzyme inhibition properties [61\u201364]. The biological activity of Schiff bases originates from the imine or azomethine (-C=N-) func-\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779 13 of 17\ntional groups, as well as hydrophobic aromatic groups, and they can coordinate easily with metals to form versatile functional complexes [65]. The enzyme inhibition properties of Schiff bases were tested against very important metabolic enzymes such as CA, AChE, and BChE, which are associated with some global disorders, and it was observed that they effectively inhibited them. Recently, three series of symmetrical Schiff bases and their amine derivatives were tested towards AChE and hCA I and II isoenzymes, and demonstrated nanomolar inhibition profiles against the indicated metabolic enzymes, which have a significant role in drug discovery and design as well as in toxicology and medicine [59]. It was reported that Schiff bases, as kind of compounds containing azomethine groups, exhibited antioxidant activity, especially O2\u2022\u2013 scavenging activity. In this context, it has been observed that Schiff base complexes containing copper can almost completely remove the existing O2\u2022\u2013 even at low concentrations [66]. In another study, the antioxidant activity of some resveratrol analogues including 4\u2032- hydroxyphenyl-benzo[d]thiazole, p-(N,N-dimethyl)aminobenzylidene-2-aminothiophenol, and p-nitrobenzylidene-2-aminothiophenol were synthesized, characterized, and their antioxidant activity was evaluated [67]. Better antioxidant and antifungal activity of chitosan derivatives bearing Schiff bases were reported. In a recent study, many chitosan derivatives containing Schiff bases were synthesized. In this study, the structural characterization of chloracetyl chitosan oligosaccharide derivatives grafted with pyridine-4-aldehyde Schiff bases was performed, and their antioxidant activities against DPPH\u2022radical and O2\u2022\u2013 were determined [68]. Similarly, it was indicated that some chiral selenite ligands and their palladium complexes have antioxidant activity, which increased with concentration [69]. In a recent study, it was shown that the Co2+ and Fe2+ complexes of Schiff bases demonstrated effective antioxidant ability using different methods including the FRAP and CUPRAC reducing methods, and ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging methods [60]. Similarly, some Schiff base ligands ((E)-6-methyl-2-(2,3,4-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]-thiophene-3-carbonitrile) and their Co2+ and Pd2+ complexes exhibited powerful antioxidant abilities [10]. The transition metal complexes from bidentate Schiff base ligands containing both amine (\u2013NH2) and \u2013OH groups have been extensively studied. In particular, Schiff base\u2013metal complexes containing nitrogen and oxygen donor atoms show many application areas such as catalytic and biological activities [10]. Antioxidants containing such Schiff bases significantly prevent the formation and accumulation of free radicals, and protect the body from oxidative damage. In a recent study, Schiff bases and new secondary amine derivatives of p-vanillin demonstrated powerful antioxidant abilities by strongly scavenging ABTS (IC50: 1.25\u2013464.38 mM) and DPPH radicals (IC50: 2.20\u2013870.78 mM) and by exhibiting strong Fe[(CN)6]3+ reducing ability [70]. When the relevant literature is examined, it can be observed that Schiff bases inhibit some metabolic enzymes that are seriously important. This situation holds great promise in the design and synthesis of new drugs for some diseases that are very common in the global context. In studies carried out in this context, symmetrical Schiff bases were synthesized from 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,3-diaminopropane, and 1,4-diaminobutane and substituted benzaldehydes effectively inhibited the cytosolic CA I and II isozymes and AChE, with Ki values in the range of 159.43 \u00b1 30.03 to 563.73 \u00b1 115.30 nM for hCA I, 104.88 \u00b1 18.44 to 524.32 \u00b1 95.03 nM for hCA II, and 3.95 \u00b1 0.74 to 30.83 \u00b1 6.81 nM for AChE [71]. Similarly, Co2+ and Fe2+ complexes of Schiff bases demonstrated Ki values in the range of 1.06 \u00b1 0.16 to 9.83 \u00b1 0.74 nM for hCA I, 0.68 \u00b1 0.12 to 7.16 \u00b1 1.14 nM for hCA II, 44.66 \u00b1 10.06 to 78.34 \u00b1 17.83 nM for AChE,50.36 \u00b1 13.88 to 88.36 \u00b1 20.03 nM for BChE, and 33.72 \u00b1 7.93 to 90.56 \u00b1 27.52 nM for \u03b1-glycosidase enzyme [56]. Some Schiff base ligands ((E)-6-methyl-2-(2,3,4-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carbonitrile) and their Co2+ and Pd2+ complexes exhibited IC50 values in the range of 98.86\u2013153.25 \u00b5M against glutathione S-transferase (GST), 50.47\u201388.22 \u00b5M towards AChE, and 88.76\u2013120.72 \u00b5M on BChE [10]. In conclusion, the newly synthesized Schiff bases are promising potential antioxidant agent candidates for the scavenging of ROS, which cause damage in humans. Additionally,\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 779 14 of 17\nwe believe that these results may be useful for the synthesis of new hCA I and II isoenzymes, AChE and BChE inhibitors, and in the development of drugs for the treatment of some common and global diseases including edema, epilepsy, glaucoma, mountain sickness, and AD.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030779/s1, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of synthesized compounds.
