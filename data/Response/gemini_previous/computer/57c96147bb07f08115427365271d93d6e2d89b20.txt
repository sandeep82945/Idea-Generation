1. **Investigate the use of different spatial embedding techniques:** The paper proposes a spatial embedding approach that leverages camera intrinsic and extrinsic information to reduce the ambiguity of purely visual matching. Future research could explore alternative spatial embedding techniques to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the localization method.


2. **Develop a method for estimating the initial pose more accurately:** The paper assumes that an initial pose is available, but in practice, this pose may not be accurate. Future research could develop a method for estimating the initial pose more accurately, which would improve the overall performance of the localization method.


3. **Extend the method to handle dynamic environments:** The paper assumes that the environment is static, but in practice, there may be dynamic objects such as moving vehicles or pedestrians. Future research could extend the method to handle dynamic environments by incorporating techniques for tracking and compensating for the motion of dynamic objects.


4. **Explore the use of additional sensors:** The paper focuses on using only visual information for localization. Future research could explore the use of additional sensors, such as radar or lidar, to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the localization method.


5. **Investigate the use of deep learning for feature extraction:** The paper uses a handcrafted feature extractor for extracting features from the images. Future research could explore the use of deep learning for feature extraction, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of computer vision tasks.
