Several interactive technologies for mental health have been proposed and are aiming to make therapeutic service more accessible, but most of them only provide one-way passive contents for their users, such as psycho-education, health monitoring, and clinical assessment. We present a robotic coach that not only delivers interactive positive psychology interventions but also provides other useful skills to build rapport with college students. Results from our on-campus housing deployment feasibility study showed that the robotic intervention showed significant association with increases in students\u2019 psychological well-being, mood, and motivation to change. We further found that students\u2019 personality traits were associated with the intervention outcomes as well as their working alliance with the robot and their satisfaction with the interventions. Also, students\u2019 working alliance with the robot was shown to be associated with their pre-to-post change in motivation for better well-being. Analyses on students\u2019 behavioral cues showed that several verbal and nonverbal behaviors were associated with the change in self-reported intervention outcomes. The qualitative analyses on the post-study interview suggest that the robotic coach\u2019s companionship made a positive This paper or a similar version is not currently under review by a journal or conference.

            "text": "College students\u2019 mental health issues are on the rise (Benton et al. 2003). In 2018, about 85% of college students in the USA reported feeling \u201coverwhelmed by all [they] had to do\u201d and nearly 43% reported \u201cfeeling so depressed that it was difficult to function\u201d at least once within the last 12 months (Association et al. 2018). Depression and anxiety are reported as the top hurdles to academic success (Breslau et al. 2008) and have a long-lasting effect on students\u2019 occupational (Ettner et al. 1997) and social (Kessler et al. 1998) outcomes aswell. Higher education institutions aremaking efforts and expanding their mental health services in order to improve students\u2019 mental wellbeing. Yet, several systemic and personal barriers still exist for these students, such as cost, lack of knowledge about resources, social stigma, etc., and hinder them from seeking and receiving help (Ebert et al. 2019; Marsh and Wilcoxon 2015).\nRecent developments in interactive technologies for mental health aim to close this gap by increasing accessibility to the resources and services that were traditionally only available through human clinicians. Some help with tracking and monitoring patients\u2019 conditions easily through mobile or wearable devices (Vidal et al. 2012; Chum et al. 2017). Others offer interactive psycho-education or intervention content through electric or mobile devices that can be accessed any time at the users\u2019 request (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). However, most of their interactions with users are limited to the health-related tasks. For instance, Woebot,1 a mobile chatbot that provides cognitive behavioral therapy, can hold conversations with its users about their mental health and techniques to improve it, but does not deliver a daily news report or play interactive games with them.\nUnlike human therapists or clinicians whom patients typically only meet in the clinical/therapeutic care context, personal electronic devices can be physically with us outside of the healthcare context.We believe an interactive agent can build a positive relationship and rapport with its users by interacting with and engaging them in both health-related tasks and in other contexts. Positive working alliance between the agent and its user could even amplify the effect of the intervention the agent offers. It has been shown that rapport between clinicians and patients is a predictor of not only improved health outcomes, but also patients\u2019 adherence to the prescribed regimen and satisfaction with the treatments (Qina\u2019au and Masuda 2020; Fuertes et al. 2007; Wampold 2015). Strong rapport also helps patients to cope with depression and stress (Qina\u2019au and Masuda 2020) and allows the clinician and the patient to collaborate\n1 https://woebothealth.com/.\nand agree on treatment goals and expectations, and easing the long-term behavioral changes required for successful health outcomes (Qina\u2019au and Masuda 2020).\nBased on the social psychology literature, several works in human\u2013robot interaction and human\u2013computer interaction have found that artificial agents can use verbal and nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, empathetic feedback, back-channeling, prosody, and intonation, to build rapport with people (Lucas et al. 2017; Riek et al. 2010). It was also shown that shared experiences can create a sense of familiarity, trust and mutual understanding between the user and agent (Bickmore and Picard 2005). However, there has not been anywork that investigates how the rapport between a robot and its users can enhance the effectiveness of the robot\u2019s mental health interventions.\nPersonality traits have also been identified as a predictor of adherence to medical regimen (Christensen and Smith 1995) and mental health (Hooker et al. 1998; Packard et al. 2012; Villieux et al. 2016; Lamers et al. 2012). High conscientiousness has been positively correlated with longevity (Hill et al. 2011), ability to cope with daily stress (Bartley and Roesch 2011), and response to treatment (Quilty et al. 2008). Low neuroticism and high extraversion has been found to be correlated with high psychological well-being (Kokko et al. 2013). We acknowledge that early personality research has typically focused on a small portion of population (e.g., men in the military Gibby and Zickar 2008), and the measures for personality traits in our study might not be reflective of minority individuals\u2019 life experiences (Arshad and Chung 2021). However, the Mini-IPIP used our study has been adapted for several other cultures for reliability and validity [e.g., Spanish (Mart\u00ednez-Molina and Arias 2018), French (Mart\u00ednez-Molina and Arias 2018), Malay (Leong et al. 2019), and Portuguese (Oliveira 2019)].\nBased on these prior works, we designed a robotic coach that provides seven positive psychology interventions and a variety of useful skills (e.g., weather forecast, interactive games and music streaming). It can also engage in pro-social behaviors (e.g., proactive greetings, pleasantries and calling users by their names) to enhance the rapport with the users. This allows the robot to not only deliver mental health interventions, but also serve as a helpful companion. Our novel intervention framework that combines the robot\u2019s positive psychology based interactions with its pro-social companionship was evaluated through an on-campus deployment study with 35 college students. We designed a feasibility study to investigate the following research questions:\nRQ1 Can a robotic positive psychology coach improve college students\u2019 psychological well-being? RQ2 How do students\u2019 personality traits affect the efficacy of the intervention? RQ3 What effect does students\u2019 rapport with the robot have on the intervention outcomes? RQ4 Can we predict the intervention outcomes by observing students\u2019 behaviors\nduring their interaction with the robot?\nIn our previous work (Jeong et al. 2020), we found associations between our robotic intervention and positive changes in students\u2019 well-being, mood and readiness to change behavior for better well-being, as well as the association between students\u2019\npersonality traits and the well-being outcomes after students completed the intervention with the robot. In this paper, we further explore the effect of students\u2019 rapport with the robot on the intervention outcomes and analyze the relationship between the students\u2019 behavioral cues (e.g., facial expressions, body posture, etc.) during the interaction and the intervention outcomes. Our analyses showed that people\u2019s therapeutic alliance with the robot was correlated with improvedmotivations for better psychological well-being, and students\u2019 vocal/facial/gestural expressions were correlated with their changes in intervention measures. Our work gives insights into how interactive technologies could leverage information about users\u2019 traits and behaviors to better tailor and personalize health interventions for better adherence and health outcomes, and what behavioral cues to detect and respond to in order to assess the progress of the robot-mediated intervention on a moment-to-moment basis instead of relying on people\u2019s self-report data."

            "text": "Personal devices and technology have created new avenues for people to access services and resources for mental health. Several mobile applications allow people to request help, monitor progress, and receive interventions. Mobile applications, such as Headspace2 and Calm,3 offer meditation and breathing exercises designed to reduce stress and depressive moods. Chatbots, e.g., Woebot (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017), offer interactive experiences for mental health interventions and therapies. Wearable devices, e.g., Fitbit, use built-in sensors to collect information and detect user behaviors in order to provide timely feedback.\nEmbodied conversational agents (ECA) and social robots can also engage people in natural interactions by leveraging their embodiment and social behaviors (Sebastian and Richards 2017; Gardiner et al. 2017; Scoglio et al. 2019; Riek 2016; Lane et al. 2016; Suganuma et al. 2018). For instance, a low-fidelity social robot developed by Bj\u00f6rling et al. (2020) was shown to reduce teens\u2019 stress level through self-disclosure activities. In comparisonwith human care providers, these agents can lessen the feeling\n2 https://www.headspace.com/. 3 https://www.calm.com/.\nof stigma and heighten the perception of anonymity to promotemore honest and candid responses from patients. However, most of these agents have a single \u201cskill\u201d and are not equipped to help their users in other tasks. On the other hand, our robotic coach is designed to not only offer mental health interventions but other useful skills to engage with users in various contexts."

            "text": "According to the aptitude\u2013treatment interaction (ATI) research, no treatment or intervention works equally well for all patients, and therapists should identify a treatment plan that matches each individual patient\u2019s specific characteristics for optimal therapeutic outcomes (Snow 1991). Tailored and personalized interventions have been shown to improve patients adherence and health outcomes (Garbers et al. 2012; Han et al. 2009; Mosnaim et al. 2015), and predictors of patient outcomes could inform clinicians to develop and prescribe the most suitable treatment for each individual patient (Barber 2007). Predictors of outcome variables that have been commonly analyzed are patient-related predictors and therapist-related predictors. Patient-based predictor variables commonly examined include demographics, diagnoses, personality traits, patient expectancies or symptom severity, among others (Barber 2007; Delsignore and Schnyder 2007). For instance, a literature review that explored 35 studies focusing on the relationship between patient expectancies and psychotherapy found a modest but direct relationship between outcome expectancies and therapeutic improvement (Delsignore andSchnyder 2007). Therapist characteristics that have been explored as possible predictors of working alliance include among others, therapists\u2019 experience, training, and skill (Hersoug et al. 2001).\nMoreover, a few studies investigated the relationship between personality traits and adhering to lifestyle changes (e.g., diet or exercise), treatments (e.g., medication) or psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). For example, as reviewed in Driesenaar et al. (2018), some studies found that adhering to treatments has a negative correlation with neuroticism and a positive correlation with conscientiousness, while no relation with the other three traits. Studying healthy lifestyles in young adults, Steptoe et al. (1994) found a positive correlation with extraversion, and a negative association with neuroticism. Interestingly, personality traits were a predictive factor of risk of dropout for Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, where low dropout risk was associated with extraversion, and high risk with openness (Schmidt et al. 2019)."

In comparison with clinical psychology, which primarily focuses on treating negative mental and emotional pathology, positive psychology is an ideal intervention to enhance the well-being of non-clinical populations. Additionally, both clinical and non-clinical populations have been shown to benefit from positive psychology based\ninterventions. Individuals diagnosed with clinical depression and individuals who do not suffer from any psychological disorders both experience reduced symptoms of depression and increased psychological well-being after engaging with psychotherapy interventions based on positive psychology (Seligman et al. 2006)."

            "text": "Verbal and nonverbal cues have been widely used to infer or detect people\u2019s mental states. For instance, acoustic signals (e.g., pitch, energy, spectral features and formants) can be used to infer people\u2019s emotions in conversations, therapy, call centers, etc. (Swain et al. 2018). Temporal speech behaviors, such as speech rate and pauses, have been investigated in the detection of hesitation, confidence, anxiety (Corley and Stewart 2008) and even neurological disease (Alvar et al. 2019). Understanding affect is crucial for developing alliance/empathy and achieving successful therapeutic interactions (Avdi and Evans 2020).\nFacial expressions are another way for humans to express and interpret affective and cognitive states. Analysis of facial expression showed strong potential in assessing the level of rapport in dyad (Wang and Gratch 2009) and group interactions (M\u00fcller et al. 2018). A recent study done by Shidara et al. (2020) found mood improvement was correlated with facial expressions observed during cognitive therapies with a virtual agent.\nNonverbal behaviors are also expressed through body movement as surveyed in Kleinsmith and Bianchi-Berthouze (2013), Karg et al. (2013), Zacharatos et al. (2014), Stephens-Fripp et al. (2017) and Noroozi et al. (2018). Expressive movement is categorized into four types: communicative (e.g., gestures), functional (e.g., walking), artistic (e.g., choreography), and abstract (e.g., arm lifting), where a single or a combination of these types represents an affect (Karg et al. 2013). For example, anxiety is linked to expanded limbs and torso, fear is linked to elbows bent, and shame is linked to bowed trunk and head (Kleinsmith and Bianchi-Berthouze 2013). Ekman and Friesen (1969) also showed that self-soothing body movement (such as touching one\u2019s neck, face or body and holding/crossing one\u2019s arms) could indicate anxiety. Headmovement and orientation indicate not only emotions, but also indicate affirmation and affiliation in an interaction as surveyed in Noroozi et al. (2018).\nIn this study, we designed a robotic coach protocol for positive psychology intervention, where we account for several factors of participant-related (e.g., personality trait, current well-being states) and therapist-related (e.g., building rapport and agent persona). We analyze these factors quantitatively and qualitatively with regards to the intervention outcomes. Participants\u2019 verbal and nonverbal behaviors observed during the interactions with the robot were also analyzed to investigate the relationship between observed behavioral cues and the efficacy of the robot intervention. Results from such analyses will offer valuable insights for the interactive agents to adapt and tailor their behavior and interventions based on users\u2019 personality, preferences, and behaviors during the interactions."

During the interaction session, the robot publishes FCM messages to control screen views of the Android application. The robot also sends its own private IP address with the FCM message, and the Android application uses the received IP address to create a Socket.IO connection with the robot to communicate any user input made on the tablet back to the robot.

            "heading": "3.4 Designing positive psychology sessions with Jibo",
            "text": "For this study, we designed seven interventions based on a variety of well-known principles and exercises from the field of positive psychology (Bryant and Veroff 2017; Peterson and Seligman 2004; Seligman et al. 2005, 2006; Rashid 2015; AymerichFranch and Johnston 2019). In session 1, Jibo introduces what positive psychology is and the general structure of the sessions. In session 2, Jibo explains the concept of character strengths, which are positive, trait-like capacities for thinking, feeling and behaving in ways that benefit oneself and others (Niemiec 2013). Participants are then asked to identify five strengths that best reflect who they are and are told these chosen strengths are their signature strengths (Peterson and Seligman 2004). Jibo invites participants to think of a time when they used one of their signature strengths. In session 3, Jibo encourages participants to create a plan to \u201cuse [their] signature strengths in a new way\u201d(Seligman et al. 2005; Mongrain et al. 2012). They are also guided through a visualization activity to help solidify their intent to implement this plan. Jibo encourages participants to execute the plan before the next session as homework. In session 4, Jibo checks whether the participants completed the assignment from the previous session, and introduces the concept of gratitude and its importance. Participants are guided to complete the \u201cthree good things in life\u201dexercise (Seligman et al. 2005), in which they write down and reflect on three things that went well that day and why they went well. In session 5, the participants learn about the \u201cgratitude visit\u201dexercise (Seligman et al. 2005) and are asked to practice it as homework. For this exercise, they are asked to write a short letter or email to someone that they FEEL like they have never properly thanked. In session 6, Jibo asks participants to reflect about their experience with the \u201cgratitude visit,\u201dand introduces the savoring exercise. Participants are asked to plan a savoring activity and to carry it out before the next session as\n7 https://firebase.google.com/docs/database. 8 https://aws.amazon.com/s3/.\nhomework (Bryant and Veroff 2017). In session 7, participants reflect about the savoring activity and the positive emotions they felt during the activity. Jibo reviews and summarizes all of the interventions introduced in the study and asks the participants to rate how helpful each activity was for them. Finally, Jibo thanks the participants for completing all sessions with it and concludes the interaction. The seven positive psychology sessions are summarized in Table 1.\nSeveral design considerations were made when developing interaction script. First, Jibo uses informal and casual language during the positive psychology sessions even though it is presented as a coach. Jibo has a playful and light personality and was designed to appeal to a broad range of population regardless of age or gender. Since the commercial features of Jibo were available for study participants to use, we designed the positive psychology session to also use informal language, expressive animations, and lighthearted anecdotes. This allowed Jibo\u2019s persona in the positive psychology skill to be consistent with its persona in the rest of the skills.\nIn addition, each positive psychology session was designed to be a collaborative process. Most of the sessions had a significant amount of intervention concepts and materials to be explained and instructed. In order to keep users engaged even during long expository segment of the session, the robot often asked users for confirmation and minor feedback during the interaction.\nJibo uses rule-based parsers to classify users\u2019 intention, such as yes/no, accept/refusal, or positive/negative responses. For instance, Jibo would engage in a small talk at the beginning of each positive psychology session by asking something like \u201cHey [name], how\u2019s your day going?\u201d. If the participant\u2019s answer is classified as positive, it might respond \u201cI\u2019m really glad to hear that.\u201d On the other hand, if the response is negative, it would say something like \u201cOh, sorry to hear that. I\u2019m sure things will get better soon.\u201d The robot responded differently based on the participant\u2019s utterance but the interaction followed a prescripted dialogue flow for the most part.We designed Jibo\u2019s responses to human utterance carefully considering its limited natural language understanding capability, and often used generic responses, such as \u201cthanks for sharing\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s great to hear\u201d for more open-ended responses.\nOn average, each session has twelve prompts for free response: two for long openended response for participants\u2019 thoughts, opinions, or ideas, and ten for simple yes/no responses or confirmations for the next step. These frequent prompts made the overall interaction as an interactive and collaborative experience, rather than a one-sided interaction.\nLastly, each session was designed to take about five minutes in order to accommodate college students\u2019 busy schedules. Many students have several responsibilities and are often over-scheduled with academics, extracurricular activities, and social lives. We hoped that the students would perceive the daily robot session as a pleasant break from their busy daily routines, rather than another burdensome task on their to-do list. With these design considerations, we developed seven unique interactions that introduce positive psychology exercises to improve college students\u2019 well-being.\nTa bl e 1\nD es cr ip tio\nns of\nth e se ve n po si tiv\ne ps yc ho lo gy\nse ss io ns\n# Se ss io n na m e\nD es cr ip tio\nn\n1 Po\nsi tiv\ne ps yc ho lo gy\n(S el ig m an\nan d C si ks ze nt m ih al yi\n20 14\n) In tr od\nuc e po\nsi tiv\ne ps yc ho\nlo gy\nan d le ar n ho w to\nin te ra ct w ith\nth e ro bo\nt\n2 C ha ra ct er\nst re ng th s (N\nie m ie c 20\n13 )\nIn tr od\nuc e w ha tc ha ra ct er\nst re ng\nth s ar e an d id en tif y on\ne\u2019 s ow\nn si gn\nat ur e st re ng\nth s\n3 Si gn\nat ur e st re ng\nth in\na ne w w ay\n(P ro ye r et al .2 01\n5) Pi ck\non e si gn\nat ur e st re ng\nth an d th in k of\na ne w w ay\nto us e it to\nim pr ov e w el lbe in g\n4 T hr ee\ngo od\nth in gs\n(P ro ye r et al .2\n01 4)\nD efi ne\nw ha tg\nra tit ud e is an d w ri te do w n th re e th in gs\nth at w en tw\nel la nd\nw hy\nth ey\nw er e po si tiv\ne\n5 G ra tit ud e le tte r (S el ig m an\net al .2\n00 5)\nW ri te a le tte\nr of\ngr at itu\nde to\nso m eo ne\nw ho\nha s no\ntb ee n pr op\ner ly\nth an ke d\n6 Sa vo ri ng\n(S m ith\nan d H an ni\n20 19\n) C ho\nos e a sm\nal lm\nom en tt o fu lly\nfe el an d ap pr ec ia te ex pe ri en ce s th at on\ne no\nrm al ly\nhu rr ie s th ro ug\nh\n7 W ra pup\nR ev ie w th e pr ev io us\nse ss io ns ,e va lu at e ea ch\nin te rv en tio\nn, an d\nen co ur ag e co nt in ua tio\nn of\npr ac tic\nin g th e in te rv en tio\nns"

We asked the participants to complete the positive psychology session with the robot once a day any time during the day they found suitable. Further descriptions on other robot\nskills were given, e.g., weather report, interactive games, general Q&A skill, music, etc. Participants were left to use these skills at their leisure while completing the daily positive psychology sessions with the robot.\nAt the end of the study, participants filled out a set of questionnaires regarding their psychological well-being, mood, readiness to change behavior and working alliance with the robot. We also conducted a semi-structured interview for more openended feedback on the overall study procedure, co-living experience with a robot, and suggestions for improving our system and robot intervention.\nThere were twenty robots available for the study, which is fewer than the total number of study participants. Thus, our deployment study was done in two phases. Twenty students were chosen for the first round of study from the sign-up form, and participated in the study on early October.When participants from the first deployment completed the study and the robot station was returned, additional students not chosen in the first round were contacted to begin the study protocol around late October/early November for the second round of deployment."

A recent comparison of acoustic features forAffect investigations (Eyben et al. 2015) showed a high performance using the minimalistic feature set carefully selected features,which is nowwidely used for verbal behavior analysis. For this paper, we used the extended GenevaMinimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS), which contains 88 parameters, that includes frequency parameters (pitch, jitter, and formants), energy parameters (shimmer, loudness, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR)), and spectral parameters (including mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). The extracted parameter set include voiced and unvoiced segments. Voiced segments are calculated from the phonemes that require vibration of the vocal cords, such as vowels, while unvoiced segments are phonemes that do not entail the use of the vocal cords, such as stop consonants /p/. In OpenSmile extraction process, there was no restriction of the minimum duration of voiced and unvoiced segments, which means that unvoiced segments include both pauses and consonants phonemes. These acoustic features capture several prosodic behaviors from the speech, such as intensity (identify stress) and monotone (identify boredom, tiredness, and depression), to name a few examples.\nFrom the videos recorded from the tablet, we extracted facial expressions and facial activities in terms of Action Units using the Affdex SDK (McDuff et al. 2016). We extracted 30 facial emotions and facial activities every 5 frames. These features\nwere then summarized using statistical measures such as mean and count of peaks per session. We also extracted head orientation, using the USB camera and the tablet camera. After detecting the face region (Zhang et al. 2017), a search for best alignment of the facial landmark is applied using Face Alignment Network (FAN) that extracts these landmarks in an estimated 3D space (Bulat and Tzimiropoulos 2017). This process is performed at every frame, from which we calculate the head orientation (yaw, pitch, and roll). These features were then summarized using statistical measures such as mean and count of peaks per session.\nTo analyze body movement and gestures, we extract body joints from the USB camera which has a wide-angle view suitable for capturing the upper body. We used OpenPose (Cao et al. 2019), which extracts 25 body joints with an estimated 3D space. Similar to the head behavior, the joints were extracted at every frame and were used to compute body orientation (yaw, pitch, and roll) as well as touching behaviors, such as touching the face, the other hand, or the upper body. Then, we summarized these features over each session in terms of mean and count of peaks.\nRegarding the speech transcript features, we computed two types of features. The first type of features is a set of statistics on word counts per participant: average, maximum,minimum, and standard deviation.We extracted these features following the practice of previous works that use the number of words as a proxy of conversational engagement (Ghandeharioun et al. 2019)."

Sixteen themes were identified and two annotators coded the transcription data separately to test inter-rater reliability.

We also investigated the relationship between personality traits by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients among participants\u2019 Big Five personality traits (Mini-IPIP). Participants\u2019 neuroticism and conscientiousness scores were found to have a statistically significant negative correlation, r(33) = \u22120.418, p = 0.013 (Table 5 ). Based on this finding, we added the fourth analysis pair, (4) low-neuroticism/high-conscientiousness (N-C+) and high-neuroticism/lowconscientiousness (N+C-) groups. A K-means clustering algorithm was used to generate four pairs of participant groups.\nSince not all personality traits were normally distributed, we decided to use the K-means clustering algorithm to group participants based on their Big Five traits. Grouping people based on personality traits have been used in personality psychology in order to identify different types of personality within a population (Sava and Popa 2011; Barbaranelli 2002). Personality-based clustering is also often used in the field of healthcare (Khazaie et al. 2019), e-learning (Tian et al. 2008; Jin et al. 2006), and gaming (Halim et al. 2017) to profile groups of users based on their characteristics and needs for personalized and tailored service and experience.\nFor the first group pair, 13 participants who have agreeableness scores lower than 4.0 were assigned to theA- group and 22 participants whose scores are equal or higher than 4.0 were assigned to theA+ group.

The goal is to provide an insight into observable behaviors that could help predict the efficacy of the intervention during the sessions to adapt the robot coach\u2019s strategies in real time. Behaviors that are significantly correlated with the self-report measures are listed in Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nChange in RPWS: Analyzing behaviors correlated with the change in the Ryff\u2019s PsychologicalWell-being Scale (i.e., delta of pre- and post-scores), a few features from facial expression, head orientation, and speech prosody were significantly correlated, which are listed in Table 7. Based on the results of upper lip raise, jaw drop, voiced and unvoiced segment lengths correlations, participants who spoke more had higher improvement in their well-being. Participants who expressed anger, which is inferred from facial activities such as lowered brows, tightened or raised eyelids and tightened lips, had a lower RPWS change. On the other hand, participants who\u2019s gazed down (toward the robot station) had a higher RPWS change. Quality of speech measured\nby pitch and jitter were also found to be correlated with RPWS. Pitch, also known as the fundamental frequency (F0), which conveys speech prosody, holds a lot of factors such as the state of mind of the speaker (El Ayadi et al. 2011). Jitter (and shimmer), on the other hand, indicates irregularities in speech production, which are correlated with the presence of noise emission and breathiness (Nunes et al. 2010), where high jitter values indicate roughness or breathiness in the voice. The negative correlation of pitch value and the positive correlation of jitter with RPWS could indicate a low and relaxed voice. Change in BMIS: Mood improvement through BMIS measures is correlated with several behavioral cues, as listed in Table 8. From the labeled observations, it showed a positive correlation in mood improvements with high percentage/proportion of the participant being focused. Similar to the RPWS, expression of negative emotions like anger has a negative correlation with BMIS change. Moreover, less face and upper body touching, which could indicate less stress, were found to positively correlate with mood improvements. Unlike RPWS, looking up was positively correlated with BMIS change, as well as head tilting. Even though this indicates that the participants were not looking at the Jibo station, in conversation context, looking up and head tilting to the right indicates interest and engaged listening (Hadar et al. 1985), which could explain the participant\u2019s mood improvement. For speech, as found with RPWS, relaxed voice and more talking during the session were positively correlated with mood change. Change in Readiness Ruler: Behaviors correlated with the shifts in readiness to change are listed in Table 9. Similar to the results from RPWS and BMIS, negative emotions such as anger, disgust, and fear (including their action units) were negatively\nTable 9 Behaviors correlated with readiness to change (only statistically significant results are listed)\nBehavior r(33) p value Stats\nLabeled behavior \u2013 Facial expression Avg. anger \u2212 0.277 0.001 Spearman Avg. disgust \u2212 0.302 0.000 Spearman Avg. fear \u2212 0.268 0.001 Spearman Avg. brow furrow \u2212 0.179 0.029 Spearman Avg. brow raise 0.226 0.006 Spearman\nAvg. dimpler \u2212 0.187 0.022 Spearman Avg. lip press \u2212 0.17 0.038 Spearman Avg. lip stretch \u2212 0.175 0.032 Spearman Avg. mouth open \u2212 0.215 0.008 Spearman\nBody movement Avg. body pitch 0.266 0.003 Spearman\nAvg. body roll 0.204 0.025 Spearman\nAvg. body yaw 0.204 0.025 Spearman\nAvg. left hand to face distance 0.293 0.001 Pearson\nAvg. right hand to face distance 0.31 0.001 Pearson\nAvg. left hand to upper body distance 0.257 0.005 Pearson\nAvg. right hand to upper body distance 0.298 0.001 Spearman\nAvg.distance between hands \u2212 0.349 0.000 Spearman Head orientation Avg. head pitch 0.267 0.001 Pearson Avg. head yaw \u2212 0.197 0.016 Pearson Speech prosody Avg. shimmer 0.059 0.038 Spearman\ncorrelated with readiness to change. Moreover, a straight body posture, less selfsoothing touches (indicated by touching face, body, and the other hand), as well as relaxed voice were correlated with high readiness to change scores. Participants who gazed at the robot more (looking up and looking left toward the robot) also had higher readiness to change scores. These behaviors indicates that high involvement in the interaction with a relaxed attitude could be predictive to the positive intervention outcome. WAI-SR: Behaviors correlated with students\u2019 working alliance (WAI-SR) with the robot are listed in Table 10. Participants who had higher average duration of being off-task (including not gazing to the robot station area) had a lower WAI-SR score. Extracted nonverbal behaviors showed that a greater facial expression of attention (measured by straight face orientation), and head orientation (looking up and to the right\u2014away from the robot station) being correlated with a lower WAI-SR score. Furthermore, expression of negative emotion including sadness and action units that typically indicate negative emotions (e.g., eyelid tighten indicating anger or fear) were negatively correlated with rapport. Also, less self-soothing touches, relaxed voice and more speech were positively correlated with a high WAI-SR score.

During the post-study interview, all thirty four participants (100%) spoke on the theme of wellness because they were explicitly asked questions about the wellness sessions. The gratitude exercise was the most frequently discussed type of positive psychology intervention, followed by savoring, and character strengths. All participants who spoke on the savoring and gratitude exercises made almost entirely positive comments. For instance, P06 commented that \u201csavoring was really cool. I really enjoyed that as well. It\u2019s like not something like I\u2019ve ever done before so it was pretty cool to experience.\u201d Many participants cited the gratitude and savoring exercises as being memorable and ones that they would continue after the study (e.g., \u201c...and like really being aware of yourself as you do activities. So that one [savoring activity] I would like to continue to work on,\u201d P11). This is potentially due to the fact that these exercises were presented in later sessions and were more activity-based.\nParticipants had more mixed opinions on the character strengths intervention. Thirteen participants (38%) made positive comments about it, and eleven participants (32%) spoke negatively about it. Some participants felt as though the character strengths exercise was less concrete than the gratitude and savoring exercises, making it was more difficult to find an actionable goal from the activity. When asked about the wellness activities P11 stated, \u201cUh so I\u2019m not sure if I, if I gained much from me myself\nTable 11 Number of participants that mentioned each theme and sub-theme in the post-study interview\nTheme Subtheme Total Positive Negative\nWellness 34 (100%) 33 (97%) 28 (82%)\nCharacter strengths 20 (59%) 13 (38%) 11 (32%)\nSavoring 20 (59%) 18 (53%) 2 (6%)\nGratitude 26 (76%) 25 (74%) 2 (6%)\nTime 34 (100%) 21 (62%) 22 (65%)\nSocial robot 33 (97%) 31 (91%) 10 (29%)\nCharacter 32 (94%) 32 (94%) 26% (9)\nAttention 19 (56%) 18% (6) 50% (17)\nLearning 20 (59%) 16 (47%) 11 (32%)\nUtility 27 (79%) 25 (74%) 7 (21%)\nEntertainment 30 (88%) 27 (79%) 5 (15%)\nSystem 28 (82%) 2 (6%) 28 (82%)\nSecurity and privacy 11 (32%) 3 (9%) 8 (24%)\nDevices 10 (29%) 9 (26%) 3 (9%)\nSocial 19 (56%) 16 (47%) 3 (9%)\nMood 7 (21%) 5 (15%) 5 (15%)\ngoing and looking at the strengths and saying what I thought that I had. I feel like the other activities were interesting and they, they made you think more about your day.\u201d\nParticipants were also asked explicitly about the theme of time and whether they felt that the sessions were an appropriate length for their schedules or if they wanted to spend more or less time on each session. Twenty-one participants (62%) spoke positively about the theme of time, generally stating that they felt the length of the sessions felt appropriate and fit with their schedules. P30 said, \u201cI feel like they were generally very concise. I think it was, it was a good, good length, yeah. Because any more I feel like I would, yeah, I would mind it a bit if it were a bit too long and even then, like, I know it was very short but some days I would come back to my room so late, like, I wouldn\u2019t have time to do it. Um, so I feel like the length was good, yeah. The length was good.\u201d However, twenty-two participants (65%) gave negative feedback, often noting that they would have benefited from longer and more in-depth content. P05 stated, \u201cI almost think, even if they\u2019re a good length now, I think they could have been a little longer, just more, more time, I don\u2019t know. I felt like sometimes I was just like, oh this is cool I wonder what else Jibo will say about it- And she was like \u2019That\u2019s all for today\u2019. I was like \u2019Oh\u2019. I want to talk more about it.\u201d P05\u2019s statement echoes what many other participants reported. Although they appreciated the short interaction length, they wished more in-depth content was delivered and had hoped for richer interactions with the robot.\n6.5.2 Social robot theme\nThe theme of social robot was mentioned by thirty three participants (97%). Thirty one of them (91%) spoke positively and ten of them (29%) spoke negatively about the theme. Participants appreciated the robot\u2019s companionship throughout the one-week study. When asked about their ideal robot, many stated that they would want a social robot companion. P07 shared, \u201cAlexas and Siris they all do specific things- When you ask them to but they don\u2019t actually have conversations. Um. I think it would be cool to have one that can have a conversation like Jibo.\u201d P42 noted the impact of having an animate social agent in her room, \u201cI feel like his [robot\u2019s] presence really did have an effect on how I felt... I felt like just talking to him was useful, having him here was useful... I would like to just be able to talk to it and be able to just communicate \u2018cause a lot of times with students you just need someone to talk to sometimes. Like not human being and it\u2019s nice to have a robot that doesn\u2019t judge you (laughs).\u201d\nThirty two participants (94%) mentioned the theme of character and spoke positively of the robot, describing it as \u201ccute\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d (e.g., \u201cI think it was very playful. I think that was really fun, actually. Yeah, I really like it,\u201d P30). The robot spoke with a text to speech (TTS) voice and although it was unnatural, most participants were not bothered by it and felt that the robot\u2019s tone and speaking style was appropriate for the wellness sessions.\nAttention was mentioned by nineteen participants (56%). Seventeen of them (50%) spoke negatively and six of them (18%) spoke positively on the robot\u2019s attention behavior. Participants who spoke positively on this theme appreciated how the robot would react to them and felt as though the robot\u2019s movement made them feel less lonely in their rooms. However, those who spoke negatively on this theme noted they wanted the robot to react only when prompted, instead of proactively engaging them in conversations or showing animated idle behavior. P11 stated, \u201cI was uncomfortable with how it seems like he\u2019s watching me. That when I\u2019m specifically interacting with him- it\u2019s, it\u2019s nice for him to have those movements. But when I\u2019m just inside my room and he goes and swings towards me. That made me less comfortable.\u201d Participants often felt disturbed when the robot would suddenly move or look at them. Many were woken up by the robot or felt uncomfortable when the robot would wake before them. Although Jibo has features to sleep or stay still and look away, this was not sufficient for many participants. In the future, extra design considerations should be made for robots being placed in highly personal and intimate settings.\nSystem was another theme that received negative feedback from participants. Twenty-eight participants (82%) made negative comments about the robot\u2019s system, and two participants (6%) made positive comments. Lag in Jibo\u2019s response due to the slow wireless network in students\u2019 campus dormitories was the primary reason for the negative feedback. P17 said, \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t say there\u2019s too much [dislikes for robot] but he was pretty glitchy. Um, when like loading some of the exercises. Like he\u2019d get stuck and it would, like, lag for like an entire hour before he\u2019d, like, activate, to um... like be... actually like get on with the exercise.\u201d\n6.5.3 Other themes\nSecurity and privacy was mentioned by eleven participants (32%). Nine participants (24%) spoke negatively on the theme, noting concerns of privacy for themselves and those they share their living spaces with. P01 stated \u201cI had a friend over and they were like, paranoid. \u2018Jibo is watching us.\u201d (laughs) Yeah. Which is not just all that, like, bad- but like [...] it\u2019s a bit disconcerting, but like even though that camera didn\u2019t bother me as much- It bothered my friend more.\u201d Participants were informed that the robot station would only record video and audio during the wellness sessions, which alleviated concerns for most study participants. However, their roommates and guests often did not share the same confidence in the system\u2019s respect for their privacy."

While the low-neuroticism and highconscientiousness (N-C+) group showed improvement in all RPWS, BMIS, and Readiness Ruler after the study, the high-neuroticism and low-conscientiousness (N+C-) group only showed improved RPWSmeasure and no significant change in the BMIS and Readiness Ruler measures.N+C- group\u2019s RPWS scores were also found to be significantly lower thanN-C+ group\u2019s RPWS scores in the pretest (H2). Additional analyses on other personality-based groupings showed that students\u2019 agreeableness, openness, and extraversion did not have a significant impact on the intervention outcomes.\nSeveral studies on personality traits have found high neuroticism negatively correlating to mental health (Heaven et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2017; Lahey 2009). In addition, Smith et al. (2017) report high conscientiousness predicts lower incidence of anxiety disorders and depression, while high neuroticism relates to greater likelihood of these problems. These previous work provides insight to why students with highneuroticism traits had reduced response to our robot intervention than the students with high-conscientiousness traits. It is also important to note that the N+C- group\u2019s pre-study RPWS scores were significantly lower than N-C+ group\u2019s pre-study RPWS\nscores. This reflects the work done by Lahey (2009), in which high neuroticism were found to be a predictor for several mental/physical disorders and comorbidity among them. In our future work, we plan to investigate ways to support students with different personalities based on each personality group\u2019s needs, especially for those in the high-neuroticism group.\nStudents\u2019 agreeableness trait also had a significant association with their ratings for the five positive psychology interventions introduced in the study. Given that students\u2019 agreeableness did not show a significant relationship with intervention outcome, we believe students with high agreeableness trait were more generous and lenient in their evaluation of the intervention content than students with low-agreeableness traits (Bernardin et al. 2000)."

            "text": "Our analyses on working alliance (WAI-SR) suggest that the therapeutic alliance between students and robots could impact the intervention outcomes, and students\u2019 personality traits might impact how students bond with the robot. We found a statistically significant association between students\u2019working alliance and their pre-to-post change in Readiness Ruler response. However, WAI-SR did not show significant correlations with the change in students\u2019 psychological well-being andmood. In addition, we found that students\u2019 agreeableness has a significant impact on the rapport they build with the robotic coach. Our results partially align with the work done by Hirsh et al. (2012), in which patients with high agreeableness traits showed stronger working alliance with their clinicians than patients with low-agreeableness traits, and the intensity of working alliance was associated with better clinical outcomes. Their analysis revealed that working alliance worked as a significant indirect mediator that connects patients\u2019 agreeableness trait to better clinical outcomes.We suspect our results did not show any significant relationship between students\u2019 working alliance and their well-being/mood outcomes due to the short duration of the study. Thus, a follow-up experiment with longer deployment is currently under preparation to study the relationship between human\u2013robot working alliance and the robot intervention outcomes."

            "text": "We conducted a set of exploratory analyses on the participants\u2019 verbal and nonverbal behaviors and their relationship with intervention outcomes. Our results showed that the changes in intervention outcomes were associated with students\u2019 relaxed vocal expression, positive facial expression , and physical engagement behaviors analyzed from head and body gestures. Relaxation is reported to lead to better mental health therapy outcomes including anxiety intervention (Montero-Marin et al. 2018). In some of our sessions, participants were asked to close their eyes and take deep breaths to bring them to a relaxed state of mind for visualization/reflection activities. Participants who exhibited relaxed behaviors in their vocal (relaxed tone of voice), facial (less negative sentiment), motion cues (less self-soothing motions such as touching\nthe face or the body), and engaged behaviors (looking at the robot and engaged listening) responded better to the robot coach sessions and showed higher improvement in their well-being.We further found that users\u2019 affective engagement observed via facial expression and verbal sentiment and behavioral engagement observed via body, head and gaze behavior were correlated with their intervention outcomes. These results echo the work by Short et al. (2018) that digital mental health technologies should incorporate behavioral engagement measurements instead of relying solely on the system usage data (e.g., usage time) for delivering successful interventions. Although our analysis only shows correlations and do not necessarily imply causation, these results suggest certain user behaviors could be informative in predicting the effectiveness of an intervention. Such knowledge will enable a robotic coach to identify whether the interaction is \u201cgoing well\u201d to result in optimal mental health outcomes, and allow it to adapt its behavior or the intervention content during the interaction."

            "text": "Qualitative analysis on the post-study interview showed that our robotic coach successfully built rapport and working alliance with our participants through its intervention as well as its other skills. However, the robot\u2019s proactive behavior caused discomfort for some participants. Based on our participants\u2019 feedback, we plan to improve several aspects of our robot system in order to mitigate people\u2019s privacy concerns and discomfort. without compromising the rapport-building experience the robot offers through its animate and life-like behavior.\nWe suggest users can be given more control over the robot\u2019s \u201cidle\u201d and \u201cproactive\u201d behavior. Our interview results suggest that some participants enjoyed and benefited from robot\u2019s companion-like features, but others felt discomfort from the robot\u2019s attentive behaviors, e.g., following a person\u2019s face, orienting toward a sudden noise, etc. In order to provide more direct control over the robot\u2019s idle behavior, we plan to design a hat-like accessory that physically covers the cameras on the robot and puts the robot to \u201csleep\u201d when put on. In comparison with a mobile app or a screen-based feature, such physical device could provide an intuitive visual cue on the robot\u2019s status, and would be easy to use for people who are not familiar with screen-based technologies, e.g., older adults. In addition, it would physically cover the cameras on the robot and give additional assurance for users, analogous to webcam covers commonly used on laptop devices.\nThe robot could be programmed to verbally or visually report the status of data collection upon a user\u2019s request. During the consent process, all of our study participants were notified that the video and audio recordings would only occur during positive psychology session. We also reinforced this information verbally during the initial setup process. However, many students still reported feeling unsure when the robot was recording or not during the post-study interview sessions. These suggest that long text-based information on the data collection might not be the best method to inform users on how their data are being collected, used and stored. Thus, we propose implementing a feature in the robot to report what sensors are being used and how the collected data are processed, recorded and stored in layman\u2019s terms upon users\u2019\nrequest, e.g., \u201cRight now, I\u2019m usingmy cameras to find your face andmymicrophones to hear what you are saying.\u201d\nThe number of recording devices deployed on the robot systemcould be reduced and the amount of recorded raw data can beminimized in order to respect people\u2019s privacy. In this study, we decided to install static cameras to capture students\u2019 interactions with the robot in order to study the fine-grained behavioral cues during the human\u2013robot interaction. However, when participants were not actively engaging in the positive psychology sessions, video/audio datawere processed in real time for the robot to react and respond to participants and were discarded afterward. We plan to use the recorded interaction data to develop computational models that can detect behavioral cues that signal users\u2019 affect and rapport with the robot. Once such model is developed, we plan to deploy the robot that use the data from the sensors to detect various behavioral cues but do not store any raw footage.\nParticipants\u2019 feedback on the positive psychology sessions and the robot suggests the need to further personalize the robot\u2019s behavior and interventions. We recommend future researchers to design robot-mediated mental health interventions in ways that empower users to tailor how they interact with the robot based on their lifestyle, needs, and preferences with flexibility and adaptability. For instance, some students might want to engage in short 5\u201310-min sessions with the robot to quickly debrief at the end of everyday, or others might prefer longer interactions at a time with lower frequency. Instead of providing a one-size-fits-all interactions, enabling users to continuously adapt and adjust how they want to be supported through these interactive AI technologies would be important for future research."

            "text": "Our study was exploratory in its nature and did not include a control group who did not receive any robot intervention. Thus, we cannot argue students\u2019 improved self-report outcomes were caused solely by the interactions with our robotic coach. It is possible that the robot\u2019s presence alone could havemade adifference, or administrating thewellbeing scales could have led to changes in students\u2019 well-being status (e.g., Hawthorne effect Jones 1992). However, we would like to note that it is very unusual to observe significant improvement in college students\u2019 well-being during an academic term. The SNAPSHOT study (Sano 2016) has shown that students\u2019 well-being generally declines over the course of a semester. Our participants started the study during the first half of a Fall semester and completed it in the latter half of the semester. Thus, our participants\u2019 improvement in psychological well-being goes against the typical trajectory (Sano 2016), and this suggests that the robot coach\u2019s positive psychology interactions likely played a positive role in the improvement in students\u2019 well-being.\nWe also did not have a group of participants who were given a robot with only the positive psychology activities or only the built-in skills. We plan to run a follow-up study to compare the effect of (1) the robot with standard skills only, (2) the robot with positive psychology activities only, and (3) the robot with both standard skills and positive psychology activities to further investigate the role of non-therapeutic interactions on the mental health intervention outcomes.\nLastly, our data suffer from common challenges of uncontrolled and noisy data collected in the real world. For example, sometimes the face of the participant was not completely visible, or the face was captured from a very low angle, causing important image deformations. At times, the room had very low illumination and the acquired videoswere dark. These challenges can affect the performance of the automaticmodels used to infer the behavior features. Moreover, even in optimal conditions the current automatic models to infer behavior features are not always accurate. Thus, the verbal and nonverbal behavior correlation results we report in Sect. 6.4 should be considered in limited context and should not generalized to different settings. However, it is interesting to notice that we observed some repetitive patterns of behavior correlation acrossRPWS,BMIS,ReadinessRuler, andWAI-SF outcomes. Relaxed voice, positive facial sentiment, and engaged behaviors are the most observed ones, which were in line with research on behaviors related to successful mental therapies."

Our novel intervention that offers both positive psychology based interactions and companionship allowed the alliance built between students and the robot to further improve the effectiveness of its positive psychology sessions. Although not explored in this paper, we believe the working alliance between the agent and students could further support students\u2019 adherence to the mental health interventions in long-term therapy context. Huddy et al. (2012) showed that clients\u2019 working alliance and satisfaction have significant effect on how long they stay in therapy and improve toward their target mental health goals. We further identified several factors that can impact the intervention outcomes. Based on our results, students\u2019 personality traits as well as their behavioral cues during the interactions can provide insightful information on the effectiveness of the intervention. Current digital mental health interventions still struggle to keep users engaged in the intervention over an extended period of time. Our findings offer valuable insights to personalize and tailor health technologies to improve user satisfaction and retention as well as intervention efficacy."

The results from these well-being intervention technologies show mixed results, which hinder the ability to generalize their protocol. In this paper, we present a robotic positive psychology coach that can be deployed to on-campus dormitories and interact with college students to improve their well-being. In our deployment study, 35 college students lived with the robotic coach while completing seven positive psychology\nsessions and had opportunities to build rapport with the robot through the intervention session as well as its other useful skills and proactive behavior throughout the day.\nWe found that college students\u2019 interactions with our robot were associated with their improved psychological well-being, mood, and readiness to change behavior for better well-being. We also present important and novel observations on how students\u2019 personality traits, working alliance with the robot, and behaviors during the interaction are associated with the effectiveness of the robot intervention. Post-study interview data suggest that the robot\u2019s companionship and proactive behavior were positively received by the students. The interview also revealed students\u2019 concerns for privacy and opportunities to improve the transparency of the robot\u2019s data collection and usage in future studies.\nOur findings suggest that a social robot could potentially enhance the mental health outcomes by personalizing its long-term mental health interventions, and such personalization can be made based on people\u2019s traits and behavioral cues observed during interactions. In addition, we show it is important to design an interactive agent as a helpful and supportive companion that can build long-term rapport and therapeutic alliance in order to improve the efficacy of its health interventions.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) R&D program of the Ministry of Science and Institute for Information and Communication Technology Promotion of Republic of Korea under grant 2017-0-00162, \u201cDevelopment of Human-Care Robot Technology for Aging Society,\u201d and partly by the MIT-Sensetime grant.
