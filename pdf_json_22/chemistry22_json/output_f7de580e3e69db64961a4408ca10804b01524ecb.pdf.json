The underlying data for Figs 2\u20134, 6\u20139 and S1 are in S1\u2013S17 Files. The cDNA sequence data, accession numbers OM258702, OM258703, OM258704 and OM258705, can be found on GenBank. With this correction, all relevant data are now provided. The Data Availability statement is therefore updated to read: All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files. The cDNA sequence data can be found on GenBank under accession numbers OM258702, OM258703, OM258704 and OM258705. In Fig 9 [1], the GFP and ATPase blot images included for the mutants are from different experimental replicates. The GFP and ATPase blot data in the S1 Raw Images file published with the article are from the same internal experiment; the ATPase image in the S1 Raw Images file is that shown in the figure.",
