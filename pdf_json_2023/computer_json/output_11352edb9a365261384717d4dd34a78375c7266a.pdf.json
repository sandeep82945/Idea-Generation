            "heading": "II. SUMMARY OF PAPERS",
            "text": "The papers appearing in the current Special Section are summarized as following. We begin with an article by Saenz et al. [A1]. This work contends that interactive robot applications are limited by a lack of safety engineering expertise to ensure human safety in working with cobots. The researchers developed web-based tools to support engineers and users in considering safety risks in cobot applications with utility for persons with different levels of safety knowledge. This article covers several examples of cobot applications and the benefits of applying the web-based toolkit.\nWe continue with the interactive robotics theme in [A2]. Samper-Escudero et al. focus on exoskeletons, specifically flexible forms that use fabrics and other soft materials to promote joint stability and work production. Unfortunately, body fit issues may occur with such technologies, leading to ineffectiveness in application. The researchers developed a new cabledriven, soft exoskeleton that provides greater anatomical adaptation through deformation of materials to limb states during motion. The suit was found to effectively transfer mobilizing forces to the arm for performing bimanual daily living tasks. The suit also reduced muscular loading and promoted postural endurance.\nDate of current version 31 July 2023. Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/THMS.2023.3295512\nIn [A3], Huang and Pitts contend that automated vehicle driver\u2019s visual and auditory attentional resources are usually occupied during driving. They explore the use of vibrotactile displays as interfaces to support takeover processes under offnominal conditions. They investigated the effectiveness of such displays for cueing takeover requests in a driving simulator study with a Level 3 automated vehicle control scenario. Surrounding vehicle status and recommended maneuvers (lane changes and braking) were conveyed with seat back, seat pan, and a combo display. Results from the study were counter to expectation with the shortest takeover times occurring for a baseline condition with no meaningful pattern to the vibrotactile display. Furthermore, the baseline condition also resulted in the lowest maximum acceleration response (conservative action) relative to the displayed takeover request. These results suggested limited potential utility of vibrotactile displays for complementing visual and auditory display in automated vehicles to facilitate driver takeover actions.\nThe fourth paper in the Special Section shifts our focus to the use of physiological responses for gaining insights into human cognitive states. In [A4], Du et al. advocates the use of virtual reality (VR) systems for surgeon training in pre and postoperative conditions. Furthermore, this work identifies shortcomings in existing measure of surgeon skill and proposes an electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm index for distinguishing between novice and expert surgeon skill levels. A VR-based simulation of a neurosurgery cutting task was presented to testers. The EEG rhythm index was compared with other conventional measures of surgeon skill assessment and revealed a 20% increase in novice versus expert surgeon classification accuracy. The authors subsequently applied machine learning (ML) methods (SVM and random forest) for the analysis of EEG energy topographic maps and found a 10% increase in surgeon skill classification relative to other conventional measures. The analyses also included common ML metrics with all demonstrating improvement in skill classification.\nThe next paper in the Special Section also focuses on physiological responses for gaining insights into human cognitive states. In [A5], Cai et al. examined the utility of combining EEG measures with the electro-oculogram (EOG) measures for classification of human multidimensional emotional states. The authors downselected EEG channels by identifying those containing the greatest degree of mutual emotion information.\n2168-2291 \u00a9 2023 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/index.html for more information.\nThe authors also examined multiple time windows of EEG and EOG data as a basis for optimizing emotional state classification accuracy with little guidance from the existing literature. The classification approach included extracting multiple statistical features as well as entropy measures on the EEG responses as a basis for producing accurate and refined classification models. The authors found that 13 EEG features with EOG feature boosting could accurately predict the emotional states with data collected in 4, 5, 6, and 10 s time windows.\nThe sixth paper in the Special Section is topically unique relative to the other papers. In [A6], Scarcello et al. address the challenge of evaluating both objective and subjective indicators of environment thermal conditions to optimize control. The authors collected data on user perceptions of comfort based on interactions with a control interface, as well as indoor temperature data and energy consumption levels. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm was applied to the dataset to learn and adapt to user comfort requirements. The DRL algorithm included various combinations of rewards in order for the system to optimally emphasize different outcome objectives.\nThe final paper in the Special Section is presented by Demir et al. [A7]. This work is complementary to other major themes of the conference papers. The authors investigated manipulations of multiple member teams for degrees of agility. Team configurations included human participants working with synthetic agents, randomly assigned coparticipants or experts. The teams were assigned to complete a remotely piloted aircraft systems operation. Results revealed the presence of an expert on teams to produce a tendency for exploration of new strategic alternatives to task performance (target negotiation), whereas when interacting with a synthetic agent or random partner, teams tend to explore established performance strategies that the authors interpreted as successful agility."

            "text": "The 2nd ICHMS was a dense and full hybrid conference program over three days with core contributions organized in a single track format, including special sessions on Interactive and Wearable Computing Systems, Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Applications, and Interactive Robotics. The conference program yielded many high-quality research contributions. Authors were subsequently invited to expand these contributions into full journal papers with substantial additional results. The Special Section presents selected items from the conference having met the rigorous review criteria of T-HMS."
