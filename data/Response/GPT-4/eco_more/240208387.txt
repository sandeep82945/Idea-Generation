Exploring the Impact of Asymmetric Transaction Costs: This paper considers proportional transaction costs in the investment-consumption problem. Future research could explore the impact of asymmetric transaction costs on the optimal investment and consumption strategies, i.e., when the costs of buying and selling assets are different. This could involve analyzing how these asymmetries affect the well-posedness of the problem and the characteristics of the optimal strategies.

Extension to Multiple Risky Assets: The current study focuses on a market with a single risky asset. Extending the model to include multiple risky assets would introduce the challenge of portfolio diversification under transaction costs and Epstein-Zin preferences. Research in this direction could investigate how the inclusion of multiple assets affects the optimal consumption and investment decisions, and how the shadow fraction of wealth concept applies in a multi-asset setting.

Incorporating Market Impact and Liquidity Constraints: Another possible extension is to consider the effects of market impact and liquidity constraints on the investment-consumption problem. This would involve modeling how large transactions can affect asset prices and how liquidity constraints limit the set of feasible strategies, particularly under the presence of transaction costs and when preferences are described by stochastic differential utility.

Long-term Impact of Recurring Small Transaction Costs: While the paper touches on the asymptotics in the small transaction regime, a deeper investigation into the long-term impact of recurring small transaction costs on wealth accumulation and consumption patterns could be insightful. This research could focus on the cumulative effect of such costs over time and how they influence the optimal dynamic strategy, especially under non-additive utility models.

Behavioral Factors and Heuristic-Based Strategies: Finally, considering behavioral factors and heuristic-based strategies in the context of the Merton problem with transaction costs and Epstein-Zin utility could offer valuable insights. This line of research would explore how investors' psychological biases and heuristic decision-making processes affect the optimal strategies derived from the mathematical model, potentially leading to the development of more realistic and applicable financial advice.
