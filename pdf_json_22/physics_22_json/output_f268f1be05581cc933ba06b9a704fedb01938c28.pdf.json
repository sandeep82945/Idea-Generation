    "abstractText": "We investigate the spin\u2010torque\u2010dependent Spin Hall phenomenon in a two\u2010dimensional tight\u2010 binding system in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin\u2013orbit interactions and random static impurities. We employ the Matsubara Green function techniques to calculate the relaxation time caused by the scattering of electrons by impurities. The longitudinal and transverse conductivities are next calculated with the help of the Kubo formalism. We have also calculated the spin Hall angle for the present model and studied its dependence on spin\u2013orbit interactions and impurity strength. Finally, we explore the effect of interplay between the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions on the spin\u2010Hall effect.",

We employ the Matsubara Green function techniques to calculate the relaxation time caused by the scattering of electrons by impurities. The longitudinal and transverse conductivities are next calculated with the help of the Kubo formalism. We have also calculated the spin Hall angle for the present model and studied its dependence on spin\u2013orbit interactions and impurity strength. Finally, we explore the effect of interplay between the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions on the spin\u2011Hall effect.\nWith recent development in the field of spin-based devices, the subject of Spintronics has become an active area of research in low-dimensional physics for its potential applications in spin filters, field-effect spin transistors, information processing, and mass storage1,2, magnetic recording, sensors and so on. Spin transport plays a key role in spintronic devices and causes a spin current in a similar manner the charge transport gives the charge current. Methods like injecting ferromagnetic atoms in a non-ferromagnetic material3\u201310 have been used widely in the past to get spin current. However, this method is efficacious only when the magnetic field is strong. An alternative approach has been proposed by Sharma et\u00a0al.11 to produce spin current in the GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Here the basic idea is that in the GaAs/AlGaAs hetero-structure cavity, the spin\u2013orbit interaction couples the electron\u2019s spin and orbital motion making the electrons of the system spin-polarized11. The study of intrinsic Spin-Hall effect in p-doped semiconductors by Murakami et\u00a0al.12 and in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas by Sinova et\u00a0al.13 with a substantial Rashba spin\u2013orbit coupling has brought the subject of spintronics to the forefront of current research. The intrinsic spin-Hall effect refers to a non-dissipative spin current flowing normal to the driving electric field when the spin\u2013orbit interaction (SOI) dominates over the quantum collisions caused by the disorder. This is in contrast to the extrinsic Spin-Hall effect proposed by Hirsch14 and Zhang15, where the spin current is generated by the spin\u2013orbit dependent scattering from the impurity. Also, the effect of random disorders on the spin-Hall effect has been widely studied over time. The impurities considered have mainly been magnetic16\u201319, and also static random impurities20\u201329. Inoue et\u00a0al.30,31 have shown that in a two-dimensional electron gas, spin accumulation can be achieved by applying a bias and have calculated the diffusive conductance tensor. They have also demonstrated that vertex correction in SHC causes SHC to vanish.\nIn most of the earlier works on spin transport mentioned above, the spin current has been defined in the conventional way and is given by 4 {v, \u03c3 }13,31 In the presence of SOIs, this definition suffers from two fundamental drawbacks. First, the conservation of spin magnetic moment no longer holds and secondly, the spin current is found to be finite even in a localized state. To avoid these difficulties, Shi et\u00a0al.32,33 have put forward an alternative definition for the current. They define the current as a time derivative of the polarization operator, which differs from the conventional definition by the torque dipole term. Here the torque dipole term in the case of spin current is given by the expectation value of the rate of change of spin and arises when the spin magnetic moment of the system is not conserved. Recently, we have studied the effect of disorder on the longitudinal charge and spin currents in a 2D system described by the tight-binding model (TBM) incorporating the Rashba SOI (RSOI) effect34. Later we have also studied the same model taking into account the effects of both RSOI and Dresselhaus SOI (DSOI)35. DSOI arises because of the breaking of bulk inversion symmetry and its strength (which is not\nOPEN\n1School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, India. 2Department of Physics, Visva Bharati University, Bolpur, West Bengal, India. *email: acsp.uohyd@gmail.com\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:14201 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18042-w\ntunable) is of the same order as RSOI\u2019s and is usually present in almost all systems. Therefore, the incorporation of DSOI is important for the proper understanding of any SOI effect.\nIn this paper, we purport to examine the role of RSOI, DSOI, and the static random disorder on the longitudinal spin conductivity (LSC) and the transverse spin conductivity in a 2D TBM system using Shi\u2019s approach. The transverse spin conductivity is usually referred to as the spin Hall conductivity (SHC). For the sake of completeness, we shall also calculate the corresponding charge conductivities. We finally calculate the ratio: SHC/LCC which is known as the spin-Hall angle36 and study its dependence on various parameters."

(27) and (28) in Eq.\u00a0(25):\nEquation\u00a0(29) is solved in parts. We first calculate the correlation function corresponding to the first term of Eq.\u00a0(29). Using Wick\u2019s theorem, the current\u2013current correlation function for the first term in the Fourier basis is given by:\nwhere G ( k, ipn ) and G ( k, ipn + i\u03c9n ) are the single particle Green functions which are represented by the lower and upper lines of the loop of the bubble diagram for the current\u2013current correlation function shown in Fig.\u00a02. It can be seen that at the vertices where the electrons lines meet, the momentum is conserved. Here the two electron lines differ by the Matsubara frequency i\u03c9n . In order to calculate the charge conductivity (CC) we calculate the imaginary part of the current\u2013current correlation function and perform analytic continuation (i\u03c9n \u2192 \u03c9+ i\u03b4) and write the Green functions in terms of spectral functions.

            "text": "We measure all energies in units of t . Numerical computations have been done using the software GNU Octave version 6.3.040. Figure\u00a03 shows the energy dispersion along the kx-direction in the presence and absence of SOI. The splitting of bands and the renormalization of the ground state energy (GS) are clearly visible.\nThe effect of this splitting and the renormalization can be seen in Fig.\u00a04, where SHC is plotted with respect to chemical potential. Initially SHC increases with \u00b5 (Fig.\u00a04a), reaches a maximum at some crucial \u03bc-value and then decreases with a further increase in \u03bc to zero (Fig.\u00a04b). When studied in the presence of the DSOI (Fig.\u00a04a), SHC increases with \u03bc at a lower rate as it counters the Rashba effect. This increase in SHC with chemical potential can be easily understood from Fig.\u00a05. At low \u03bc, the density of states is high which gives rise to more scattering events leading to a lower value in SHC. As \u03bc increases, DOS decreases and we observe an increase in SHC. However, as \u03bc increases beyond a certain value, DOS becomes very small (Fig.\u00a05), and then not any states are available for conduction and SHC decreases with \u03bc at large value of \u03bc (Fig.\u00a04b). As a result, SHC exhibits a maximum with respect to \u03bc (Fig.\u00a04b). Figure\u00a04c shows the nature of the variation of SHC with respect to \u03bc for different values of the impurity strength (v). As expected, with an increase in impurity strength, SHC decreases.\nIn Fig.\u00a06, we present the behaviour of SHC as a function of \u03b1R with different values of SMT parameters. Figure\u00a06a describes the behavior of SHC versus RSOI strength \u03b1R . One can see that at \u03b2D = 0 , SHC is zero up to a certain value of \u03b1R . For \u03b2D = 0, SHC has a finite value finite at \u03b1R = 0 . This shows that the difference in the spin states is minimum at smaller value of \u03b1R for \u03b2D = 0, while for finite \u03b2D , there is an appreciable difference in the spin states that causes a larger spin current. As \u03b1R increases, RSOI counters the effect of DSOI and concomitantly, SHC decreases. SHC becomes zero when \u03b1R becomes equal to \u03b2D . As \u03b1R increases further, SHC increases with \u03b1R (Fig.\u00a06a). With the increase in \u03b1R beyond \u03b1R = \u03b2D , the spin up and down bands move apart, causing a higher spin imbalance and hence a rise in SHC. As \u03b1R is increased further, SHC exhibits an asymmetric peak at a critical \u03b1R , and then decreases with further increase in \u03b1R and finally reaches a constant saturation value (Fig.\u00a06b). This peak mentioned above gives the maximum value of SHC for the system. As \u03b2D is increased, the spin imbalance decreases leading to a decrease in spin current. Figure\u00a06c displays the behaviour of SHC as a function of \u03b1R for a few values of \u00b5 . The plot exhibits a similar nature as in Fig.\u00a06a. SHC increases with the increase in \u00b5 , which is also evident from Fig.\u00a04. In Fig.\u00a06d we examine the behaviour of SHC versus \u03b1R for different values of the impurity strength. The figure shows that as the impurity strength increases, SHC decreases. In Fig.\u00a07, SHC is considered as a function of impurity strength for various system parameters. When the strength of impurity scattering coefficient is very small, SHC remains essentially unaffected by impurity. As the impurity coupling increases, one can observe a gradual decrease in SHC. Figure\u00a07a,b shows that with an increase in DSOI strength and chemical potential, SHC has a lower value and higher decreasing rate.\nFinally In the last segment, we present our results for the spin-Hall angle (SHA) which is measured by the ratio: SHC/LCC. The effect of RSOI, DSOI and the impurity on LCC was thoroughly investigated by us in our earlier works34,35.

SHC increase with increase in chemical potential while decrease with increase in impurity strength similar to SHC. And for higher value of Rashba strength once again one can observe a peak-like structure, which is maximum for a lower value of \u03b2D (Fig.\u00a08c).\nIn Fig.\u00a09, we show the three-dimensional and contour plots for the ratio of the spin Hall to charge conductivities as a function of \u03b1R and \u03b2D . As anticipated, when \u03b1R and \u03b2D are small, the ratio of SHC to LCC is almost zero. As we increase any one of the SOI strengths (keeping the other constant), the ratios initially increase but beyond a critical value of \u03b1R or \u03b2D they decrase. This gives rise to peak structures in SHC/LCC. When \u03b1R and \u03b2D are both increased together, the ratio remains zero, and as one becomes more effective than the other, we witness a measurable value. The Rashba strength can be adjusted up to 50% by varying the gate voltage41\u201343. Figure\u00a010 shows the SHC/LCC ratio for Indium arsenide for which \u03b1R and \u03b2D can take values in the range: 0. 07\u20131.6\u00a0meV and \u00b5 can be in the range: 20\u201350\u00a0 meV39,44. It can be seen that when impurity strength is low, SHA increases. This is because at low impurity concentration, SHC remains constant (Fig.\u00a07) while LCC decreases35. From Fig.\u00a010, one can see that for InAs, SHA can be in the range: 0.00001\u20130.00015.\nFigure\u00a04. SHC versus \u00b5/t for different values of: (a, b) \u03b2 \u2032D , (c) v\u2032 .

In the absence of impurity scattering, the system admits an exact solution with two degenerate electron states. We have treated the electron-impurity scattering by the Matsubara Green function technique using the diagrammatic perturbation theory. The randomness of the impurities has been taken into account by performing configuration averaging. Finally, the Kubo formalism is used to calculate spin-Hall conductivity.\nOur results suggest that as a function of the chemical potential, the spin-Hall conductivity increases monotonically for the smaller values has a peak structure for higher values.

Similar nature is also observed with respect to the RSOI coefficient.\nWe have also studied the effect of the electron-impurity interaction strength v on SHC in the presence of both the RSOI and DSOI effects and observed that for low impurity strength, SHC remains almost negligible, but with an increase in the impurity strength, SHC decreases rapidly and the rate of decrease depends on the difference between \u03b1R and \u03b2D.\nFinally, the spin-Hall angle has been calculated and it is shown that when one of the two spin\u2013orbit interactions dominates, the spin-Hall angle increases and it vanishes whenever the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions become equal. As an example, the variation of SHA as a function of the impurity coupling strength is shown for InAs.\nFigure\u00a08.
