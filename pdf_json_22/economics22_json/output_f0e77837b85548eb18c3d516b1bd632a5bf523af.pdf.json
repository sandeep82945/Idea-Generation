Housed at the World Bank, the new Pandemic Fund\u2014formerly called the Financial Intermediary Fund for PPR\u2014seeks to \u201cprovide a dedicated stream of additional, long term financing to strengthen PPR capabilities in low and middle income countries and address critical gaps through investments and technical support at thenational, regional, andglobal levels.\u201d1\nFinancial intermediary funds are financingplatforms with contributors from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors. They have a good track record of mobilising large amounts of financing for health\u2014for example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (the Global Fund) is a financial intermediary fund thathasmobilisedalmost $66bn for country programmes to tackle these three diseases. So, the launch of a new financial intermediary fund for PPR is highly welcome.2\nLow and middle income governments and regional bodies (such as Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) will be able to apply to the new Pandemic Fund for grant funding to strengthen their PPR capacities. They will be required to partner in somewaywithoneof 13pre-accredited implementing agencies,1 which include the African and Asian Development Banks, the World Health Organization, Unicef, the Global Fund, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance\u2014though details of the partnership arrangements are scant.\nThe fundhasnot yet put out its first call for proposals, although it is expected to do so in late 2022 or early 2023. In the meantime, we think there are three big questions facing the new fund that will determine how successful it will be.\nWhere will the money come from? The goal of the fund is to generate new funding for PPR that is additional to existing foreign aid budgets. $ 1.4 bn has been contributed thus far from a variety of donors,1 but this falls short of the estimated $ 10.5bn needed annually in donor funding for PPR.3 So, where will the money come from?\nDespite record amounts of foreign aid in 2021 owing to donor support for covid-19 control,4 many donors\u2019 aid budgets are actually stagnant5 or shrinking,6 leaving little optimism for new aid money to make up the difference needed for the new fund. Even if the aid outlook was more optimistic, the required amount of annual financing for thenew fund isnearly half of total aid for health disbursements in 2019,7 suggesting that the $10.5bn target is unreachable. Victoria Fan at the Center for Global Development says thatweshould lookbeyonddevelopment finance\nto national security or defence budgets as a potential source.8\nGaining support for a pandemic prevention rainy day fund has always been tricky, and even during our ongoing pandemic we have struggled to garner adequate funds to properly respond.9 The cycles of \u201cpanic and neglect\u201d in pandemic funding have proven true time and time again\u2014why will this time be any different?"

            "text": "Although the World Bank will have a critical role as secretariat and trustee, the fund will be independently governed by a board. The governing board will rely on a technical advisory panel, chaired by the WHO, for guidance and inputs. There are 21 people on the governing board,10 with equal representation between sovereign donors and potential implementing country governments. Civil society organisations will have two voting seats, whereas foundations will have one.\nCritics of the new fund, however, claim that the dominance of donors in its governance means that the fund is \u201ca step back to the donor driven past that even the funds of 20 years ago were trying to escape.\u201d11 These critics call instead for a \u201cglobal public investment\u201d paradigm, which would ensure all countries are part of and benefit from the fund.\nA recent evaluation of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), which includes Covax, found that many beneficiaries were excluded and that no low or middle income country governments were involved in the creation or early governance of the mechanism, despite its intention of being a global instrument for all countries to participate and benefit.12 13 Although the new fund has taken steps to ensure that this is not the case in terms of its governance structure, how decisions ultimately get made will reveal whether or not civil society and recipient country governments have equal footing with those holding the purse strings."

Response is also critical, but the funding realities might necessitate a rethink on what the fund can truly offer. As iswell documented, prevention ismuchmore cost effective than response. Even if the $10.5bn in annual financing for the Pandemic Fund canbemobilised, this amount pales in comparison to the estimated $13.8tn in global economic losses caused by covid-19 from 2020 to 2024.15\nCompeting interests: The Center for Policy Impact in Global Health has received funding from two philanthropic organisations, the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for research on innovative ways to finance and deliver PPR.\n1 World Bank.
