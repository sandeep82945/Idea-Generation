    "abstractText": "The low-energy gamma-ray domain is an important window for the study of the high energy Universe. Here matter can be observed in extreme physical conditions and during powerful explosive events. However, observing gamma-rays from faint sources is extremely challenging with current instrumentation. With techniques used at present collecting more signal requires larger detectors, leading to an increase in instrumental background. For the leap in sensitivity that is required for future gamma-ray missions use must be made of flux concentrating telescopes. Fortunately, gamma-ray optics such as Laue or Fresnel lenses, based on diffraction, make this possible. Laue lenses work with moderate focal lengths (tens to a few hundreds of metres), but provide only rudimentary imaging capabilities. On the other hand, Fresnel lenses offer extremely good imaging, but with a very small field of view and a requirement for focal lengths \u223c108 m. This chapter presents the basic concepts of these optics and describes their working principles, their main properties and some feasibility studies already conducted.

Here matter can be observed in extreme physical conditions and during powerful explosive events. However, observing gamma-rays from faint sources is extremely challenging with current instrumentation. With techniques used at present collecting more signal requires larger detectors, leading to an increase in instrumental background. For the leap in sensitivity that is required for future gamma-ray missions use must be made of flux concentrating telescopes. Fortunately, gamma-ray optics such as Laue or Fresnel lenses, based on diffraction, make this possible. Laue lenses work with moderate focal lengths (tens to a few hundreds of metres), but provide only rudimentary imaging capabilities. On the other hand, Fresnel lenses offer extremely good imaging, but with a very small field of view and a requirement for focal lengths \u223c108 m. This chapter presents the basic concepts of these optics and describes their working principles, their main properties and some feasibility studies already conducted.\nEnrico Virgilli Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica INAF-OAS, Via Piero Gobetti, 93/3, 40129 Bologna - Italy e-mail: enrico.virgilli@inaf.it\nHubert Halloin Universite\u0301 de Paris, CNRS, Astroparticule et Cosmologie, F-75013 Paris, France e-mail: hubert.halloin@apc.in2p3.fr\nGerald Skinner University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK e-mail: gerald.k.skinner@gmail.com\n\u2217 corresponding author\n1\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n12 36\n2v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .I\nM ]\n2 5"

It is the band in which many astrophysical systems emit most of their energy. It also contains the majority of gamma-ray lines from the decay of radioactive nuclei associated with synthesis of the chemical elements and also the 511 keV line tracing the annihilation of positrons. However, observations at these energies are constrained in ways that those at lower and higher energies are not. At lower energies grazing incidence optics enable true focusing of the incoming radiation, forming images and concentrating power from compact sources onto a small detector area. At higher energies the pair production process allows the direction of the incoming photon to be deduced. But in the low energy gamma-ray band grazing incidence optics are impractical (the graze angles are extremely small) and the dominant Compton interaction process provides only limited directional information.\nDetector background due to particle interactions and to photons from outside the region of interest is a major problem in gamma-ray astronomy. A large collecting area is essential because the fluxes are low, but unless a means is found to concentrate the radiation this implies a large detector and hence a lot of background. Shielding helps but it is imperfect and the materials in the shield themselves produce additional background. If the flux from a large collecting area A can be concentrated with efficiency \u03b7 onto a small area Ad of detector then for backgrounddominated observations there is an advantage in sensitivity of \u221a \u03b7A/Ad compared with a \u2018direct-view\u2019 instrument of area A having the same background per unit area, energy band and observation time.\nAt energies where grazing incidence optics are not viable, only two technologies are available for concentrating gamma-rays. Both use diffraction. Laue lenses use diffraction from arrays of crystals while Fresnel lenses utilise diffraction from manufactured structures. Both type of lens can provide a high degree of concentration of flux from a compact on-axis source. Fresnel lenses provides true imaging, albeit with chromatic aberrations, whereas the Laue lens is a \u2018single-reflection\u2019 optic, where the off-axis aberrations are severe.\nMeV astrophysics is now eagerly waiting for the launch of NASA\u2019s COSI mission [1] which is scheduled for 2025. This will be a survey mission with a large field of view - and consequently a relatively high background. Nevertheless, COSI is expected to be a factor of 10 more sensitive than Comptel the pioneering instrument for the MeV gamma-ray range [2]. A focusing telescope using the techniques discussed here may improve the sensitivity for the study of individual sources by another large factor, allowing studies not possible with scanning, high-background, instruments.\nLaue lenses and Fresnel lenses are discussed separately below."

            "text": "The concept of a Laue telescope is shown in Figure 1. The essential element is a \u2018Laue Lens\u2019 containing a large number of high-quality crystals. Each crystal must be correctly oriented to diffract radiation in a narrow spectral range from a distant source towards a detector located at a common focus behind the lens. The crystals are used in the Laue-mode (transmission) since the very small diffraction angles make it impractical to rely on surface reflections. Excellent reviews of previous work on this topic can be found in [3] and [4].\nThe term \u2018Laue lens\u00b4 is actually a misnomer and it would be more correct to refer to a Laue-mirror. Such a \u2018lens\u2019 relies on the mirror reflection of gamma-rays from the lattice planes in the crystals. The reflective power of the electrons bound in atoms in a single lattice plane is very small, but the power increases with the square of the number of planes - or electrons - acting coherently.\nLaue lenses basic principles: Bragg\u2019s law\nThe requirement for coherent diffraction is both the strength and the weakness of Laue lenses. It provides for the possibility of high reflectivity, but at the same time it imposes a strict dependence of the diffraction angle, \u03b8B, on the wavelength, \u03bb , (or the energy, E) of the radiation. This dependence is expressed by Bragg\u2019s law:\nsin\u03b8B = n \u03bb\n2dhkl with : n = 1,2,3, ... (1)\nwhere n is the diffraction order, dhkl is the spacing of the crystal lattice planes and \u03bb is the wavelength of the gamma-rays. The first order (n = 1) contributions are by far the most significant. For energies which concern us here the Bragg angles are always small (' 1o), so we can set tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 = \u03b8 . In the following we shall often prefer to speak in terms of energy, E, rather than wavelength. Bragg\u2019s law then takes the form:\nsin\u03b8B = n hc\n2dhklE , (2)\nwhere h is Planck\u2019s constant and c the velocity of light. (\u03bb (A\u030a) = 12.39/E (keV)). From the Bragg equation for first diffraction order, with simple geometrical considerations it can be shown that there is a relation between the distance ri at which the crystal is positioned with respect to the Laue lens axis and the diffracted energy Ei:\nEi = hcF\ndhklri , (3)\nwhere F is the focal length of the Laue lens. Eq. 3 shows that for a given focal length, if crystals with a fixed dhkl are used, those placed closer to the lens axis are dedicated to the highest energies while those positioned further away from the axis diffract the lower energies. Consequently, at a given focal length there is a direct link between the energy band of a Laue lens and its spatial extent, rin to rout . For a narrow band Laue lens, with the whole surface optimised for a single energy, it would be necessary to arrange that dhkl varies in the radial direction such that dhklri is constant (an analogous condition will be seen when the zone widths of Fresnel lenses are discussed in section Fresnel Lenses)."

In ideal (defect free) crystals the crystalline pattern is continuous over macroscopic distances. Examples of such crystals are the highly perfect Silicon and Germanium crystals now commer-\ncially available thanks to their great commercial interest and the consequent intense development effort. \u2018Mosaic crystals\u2019 on the other hand are described by a very successful theoretical model introduced by Darwin [5, 6] a century ago. Darwin modelled imperfect crystals as composed of a large number of small \u2018crystallite\u2019 blocks, individually having a perfect crystal structure but slightly misaligned one to another. The spread of the deviations, \u03c9 , of the orientation of a lattice plane in one block from the mean for the entire mosaic crystal is described by means of a probability distribution \u2126 \u2032(\u03c9), the so-called mosaic distribution function.\nDarwin\u2019s model has been very useful and quantitatively describes many aspects of real crystals. The mosaic distribution function, \u2126 \u2032 can be found experimentally for a given crystal through observation of the \u2018rocking curve\u2019, which is the measured reflectivity as function of angle for an incident beam of parallel, monochromatic gamma-rays when a crystal is scanned through the angle corresponding to a Braggreflection. The crystal sample should be thin enough that the reflectivity is never close to the saturation value. Examples of measured rocking curves are shown in Figure 2.\nFor good quality crystals the mosaic distribution can be well approximated by a Gaussian function. Its width, as observed through the rocking curve, is called the mosaic width of the crystal. Mosaic widths are specified as angular quantities, characterized by either the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) or the standard deviation, \u03c3\u03b8 , of the rocking curve.\nRocking curves are measured at constant diffraction angle, hence constant energy. For Laue lens design where the source direction is the fixed quantity, what is often of interest is the mosaic distribution as a function of the energy offset from the energy, EB, corresponding to the Bragg angle. If the standard deviation of the distribution as a function of energy is \u03c3E , then the two quantities are related by:\n\u03c3E EB = \u03c3\u03b8 \u03b8B\n(4)\nTo be useful in a Laue telescope the rocking curve for each crystal should possess a single, narrow peak. Unless great care is taken in the growth of crystals the mosaic distribution may not be well behaved and the rocking curves may be broad or exhibit multi-peaked structures."

            "text": "According to Schneider [9] the crystal reflectivity, \u03bd(E), for mosaic crystals of macroscopic thickness in the Laue-case can be calculated from:\n\u03bd(E) = 1 2 e\u2212\u00b5(E)t(1\u2212 e\u2212\u2126(E\u2212E0)R(E)t). (5)\nHere \u00b5(E) is the linear attenuation coefficient for photons of energy E and t is the crystal thickness. \u2126(E \u2212E0) is the mosaic distribution as function of energy, and R(E) is the specific reflectivity (reflectivity per unit thickness). E0 is defined as the energy where \u2126 is at its maximum.\nIn the following we shall assume that the mosaic distribution \u2126 has a Gaussian shape:\n\u2126(E\u2212E0) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3 e\u2212(E\u2212E0) 2/2\u03c32 . (6)\nWe then get for the peak reflectivity:\n\u03bd(E0) = 1 2 e\u2212\u00b5(E0)t(1\u2212 e\u2212 R(E0)t\u221a 2\u03c0\u03c3 ). (7)\nThe value of the crystal thickness which maximizes the peak reflectivity is\ntmax = ln(1+\u03b1) \u00b5(E0)\u03b1\n(8)\nwith:\n\u03b1 = R(E0) \u00b5(E0) 1\u221a 2\u03c0\u03c3\n(9)\nand the corresponding peak reflectivity is\n\u03bdm(E0) = 1 2 \u03b1(1+\u03b1)\u2212 1+\u03b1 \u03b1 . (10)\nNote that the specific reflectivity, R, and the attenuation coefficient, \u00b5 , are characteristic of a particular material and set of crystalline planes, whereas the mosaic width, \u03c3 , depends on the method of manufacture and subsequent treatment of the crystals. It is therefore reasonable to start by seeking crystals that maximise the value of R/\u00b5 and leave the choice of the mosaic width to the detailed lens design.\nThe specific reflectivity is given by:\nR(E) = 2r2e \u03bb 3\nsin(2\u03b8B) (Fstruct(x) V )2 e\u22122Bx 2 (11)\nwith x = sin(\u03b8B)/\u03bb . Here re is the classical electron radius, V is the volume of the unit cell and Fstruct is the \u2018structure factor\u2019 for the crystal unit cell. The structure factor depends on the crystal structure type (e.g. body centred cubic, face centred cubic), on the atoms, and on the choice of lattice planes involved, described by the Miller indices (h,k,l). The exponential factor describes the reduction in the diffraction intensity due to the thermal motion of the diffracting atoms. Considering only crystals of the pure elements, 11 can be rewritten as:\nR(E) \u221d E\u22122a\u22125/3( f1(x,Z))2e\u22122Bn 2/2d2 , (12)\nwhere a is the atomic volume, d is the interplanar distance of the diffracting planes, f1(x,Z) is the atomic form factor and n is the diffraction order. Here use has been made of the approximations sin(2\u03b8B)\u223c 2sin(\u03b8B) and x\u223c n/2d.\nThe linear attenuation coefficient, \u00b5(E), can be expressed as a function of the total atomic cross section, \u03ba(E), and the atomic volume :\n\u00b5(E) = \u03ba(E)\na (13)\nthus\nR \u00b5 \u221d E\u22122a\u22122/3 f1(x,Z)2 \u03ba(E) e\u2212Bn 2/2d2 . (14)\nSince at high energies both f1(x,Z) and \u03ba(E) are roughly proportional to Z it is clear that for gamma-ray energies a high atomic number and a small atomic volume (a high atomic density) are important for maximizing R/\u00b5 . For energies below \u223c 100 keV photoelectric absorption may rule out the use of crystals of the heaviest elements for Laue lenses.\nThe atomic density of crystals of the pure elements varies systematically with the atomic number, Z, as illustrated in Figure 3. The most suitable elements for Laue lens crystals are found near the peaks in this plot, that is near Z = 13 (Al), Z = 29 (Ni, Cu,), Z = 45 (Mo, Ru, Rh Ag) or Z = 76 (Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt, Au).\nThe atomic form factors are tabulated in the literature [10] and software for their calculation is publicly available [11].\nThe thermal factor, B, turns out to be anti-correlated with the atomic density, thereby strengthening somewhat the case for a high atomic density [12]."

However losses due to coherent effects also occur. These are termed \u2018extinction effects\u2019 [13]. One type of extinction loss is due to the diffraction process itself and occurs in both mosaic and perfect crystals. Photons are removed from both the incoming beam and from the diffracted beam by diffraction. (The diffracted beam is a mirror image of the incoming beam with respect to the lattice planes and fulfills the Bragg condition just as well). This dynamic interaction is termed \u2018secondary extinction\u2019 and accounts for the factor 12 in 5.\nA more subtle extinction effect, which is only present if phase coherence is maintained through multiple diffractions, is termed the \u2018primary extinction\u2019. Every diffraction instance is associated with a phase shift of \u03c0/2. Consequently, after two coherent diffraction processes the photon has accumulated a phase shift of \u03c0 and destructively interferes with the incoming beam. In the same way, three coherent diffraction processes will cause destructive interference in the diffracted beam. This effect only occurs in perfect crystals or in mosaic crystals in which the size of the crystallites is large enough that there is a significant probability of multiple successive coherent scatterings. The critical dimension here is the \u2018extinction length\u2019 (see [7]) which can be estimated as:\ntext \u2248 1 r0 V Fstruct(x)\u03bb . (15)\nThe extinction length for the Cu(111) reflection at 412 keV is 66 \u00b5m [9] . As text is proportional to the energy it will be at the lower gamma-ray energies that\nextinction effects may become noticeable. For Laue lenses it is important to find or develop crystals in which the defect density is high enough to keep the crystallite size below text at the lowest energies where the crystals are to be used."

For example, at 511 keV a perfect Germanium crystal will have an angular width of the diffraction peak (the \u2018Darwin width\u2019) of only 0.25 arc-seconds. This should be compared to the Bragg angle, which at this energy is 750 arc-seconds, i.e. about one part in 3000. The corresponding energy bandwidth is then only 0.14 keV!

According to the Darwin model, such crystals can be viewed as an ensembles of perfect micro-crystals with some spread of their angular alignments.

Mosaic crystals generally perform much better than perfect crystals in the context of Laue lenses. The internal disorder, the mosaic width, may be controlled to some extent during the crystal growth or by subsequent treatment. Mosaic widths of some arc-minutes can be obtained with relative ease for a range of crystal types. For the lenses described below a mosaic width of about 0.5 arcminutes is typical. Such values can be obtained, but this has required substantial development effort [14]. Copper crystals in particular have attracted interest because of the need for large size, high quality, Copper crystal for use in low energy neutron diffraction.\nIt must be kept in mind that Bragg\u2019s law is always strictly valid, even for mosaic crystals. As illustrated in Figure 4-(a), after diffraction from a mosaic crystal a polychromatic beam of parallel gamma-rays with a spread of energies will emerge as a rainbow coloured fan. Its angular width will be twice the angular mosaic width of the crystal. Even if the crystal is oriented so that the central ray of the emerging beam hits the detector, the extreme rays of the fan may miss it.\nAt a given energy, the radiation diffracted from a flat mosaic crystal forms in the detector plane a projected image of the crystal. It is important to note that this projected image does not move if the crystal tilt is changed. Its position is fixed by Bragg\u2019s law and it only changes in intensity.\nCrystals with curved lattice planes\nAs well as perfect and mosaic crystals, a third group has attracted interest as potential diffractive elements for Laue lenses. These are perfect crystals with curved lattice planes. The curvature of the lattice planes has two remarkable effects: i) the secondary extinction may be suppressed and ii) the energy pass-band is not constrained anymore to the Darwin width but will be defined by the total range of lattice direction, i.e. in principle something under our control. If the lattice curvature is correctly chosen relative to the photon energy secondary extinction may be suppressed and the diffraction efficiency can approach 100 % - ignoring incoherent absorption, which is always present.\nDifferent methods to create such lattice curvature have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. One involves imposing a thermal gradient on the crystal along its thickness, such that the hot side expands and the cold side contracts. This method is very convenient in the laboratory because both the degree of bending (the bending radius) and the \u2018sign\u2019 of the bending can be changed with minimal change in the experimental set up [15]. Unfortunately, this method cannot be used in space due to the significant power dissipation required to maintain the thermal gradient.\nA second method relies on specific pairs of elements (or compounds) which can form perfect crystals across a range of component fractions. Stable, curved lattice\nplanes exist in these binary crystals in the regions where a composition gradient is present [16]. Silicon/Germanium composition-gradient crystals have been proposed for the \u2018MAX\u2019 Laue lens described in Section The MAX project (2006).\nA further bending method relies on externally applied mechanical forces to bend the crystals. Mechanically bent crystals are used in several applications in laboratory experiments including monochromators. However the mass of the structures necessary to maintain the bending forces is unlikely to be acceptable for a space experiment.\nControlled permanent bending of Silicon and Germanium wafers by surface scratching has been developed by the Institute of Materials for Electronics and Magnetism, (IMEM-CNR) in Parma [17] in connection with the Italian Laue project [18]. The lapping procedure introduces defects in a superficial layer of a few microns, providing a high compressive stress resulting in a convex surface on the worked side. In such transversally bent crystals the orientation of the diffraction planes with respect to the incident radiation continuously changes in the direction of the curvature of the crystal. If the bending radius is equal to twice the focal length of the lens, the effect is to produce achromatic focusing as illustrated in Figure 4.\nA spectrum of finite extent may be focused into an area which is considerably smaller than the crystal cross-section. In this way the overall Point Source Response Function (PSF) of a Laue lens can be narrower than achievable with flat crystals of the same size.\nTransversally bent crystals were studied in the Laue project in which a number of different aspects of the Laue lens technology were faced, from the production of suitable crystals to the definition of an accurate and fast method for their alignment. It was demonstrated through simulations and experimental tests [19] that a transversally bent crystal focuses a fraction of the radiation arriving on its surface into an area which, depending on mosaicity, can be smaller than the cross section of the crystal itself. For some crystals and crystallographic orientations, if an external (primary) curvature is imposed through external forces a secondary curvature may arise. This effect is a result of crystalline anisotropy. It has been termed quasi-mosaicity [20] and leads to an increased diffraction efficiency and angular acceptance [21].\nA promising manufacturing technology for bent crystals which may overcome some of the limitations of flat crystal diffraction optics is based on so-called Silicon Pore Optics (SPO) [23]. This is a bonding technology for silicon wafers which is being developed for the ESA Athena mission. It has made possible the development of novel units for focusing gamma-rays called Silicon Laue Components (SiLCs [24, 25]). These components are being developed at the COSINE company (The Netherlands) in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley. They are self-standing Silicon diffracting elements which can focus in both the radial and the azimuthal directions. SiLCs consist of a stack of thin Silicon wafers with a small wedge angle between adjacent plates such that the diffracted rays from all the plates converge at a common focus. The incidence angle of the radiation is small so the radiation passes through only one plate. The wafer angle with respect to the optical axis of the telescope is selected such that the mean angle enables diffraction at energy E, and the overall range of wedge angles between the wafers dictates\nthe energy bandpass around the centroid E. As can be seen in Figure 5 the curvature of the wafers allows focusing in the ortho-radial direction."

            "text": "The response of a Laue lens is strongly energy dependent. For a given focal length and crystal plane spacing the area diffracting a particular energy pass-band is inversely proportional to E. Furthermore, the diffraction efficiency of the crystals adopted for realizing these optics decreases with energy. These two reasons, combined with the fact that the gamma-ray emission of astrophysical sources typically decreases with energy according to a power law, make observations at high energies even more challenging. The dependence of the effective area on energy is a geometric effect and can be mitigated only at particular energies in narrow pass-band Laue lenses. The decrease in diffraction efficiency with energy can be mitigated by choosing crystals to maximize the reflectivity.\nA number of parameters can be tuned in the optimization of a Laue lens. They are mainly related to the crystals properties (mosaicity, crystal material, diffraction planes, crystallite size, crystal thickness), or to the overall lens structure (lens diameter, focal length, inner and outer radius, geometrical configuration). The optimization is complex and depends on the Laue lens requirements (lens bandwidth, point spread function extension, total weight of the lens). The main factors involved in the optimization are described in the following sections."

            "text": "As discussed in Section Diffraction efficiency, crystals with high atomic density and high atomic number are generally preferable as Laue lens elements except at the lowest energies where photo-electric absorption may render their use less attractive. The technical difficulties involved in the fabrication and handling of crystals of the different chemical elements are also important factors. These difficulties vary significantly among the elements. The mechanical properties of the crystals are an important issue - for example Silicon and Germanium are quite hard and rugged whereas Copper, Silver and Gold crystals are soft and require special care in treatment and handling.\nAs already observed in Sect. Extinction effects, the crystallite thickness plays an important role in the reflectivity optimization. For given values of the mosaicity and crystal thickness, the highest reflectivity is obtained for a crystallite size much smaller than the extinction length of the radiation. At the energies of interest this thickness must be of the order of few \u00b5m. The crystal mosaicity also has a primary role in the Laue lens optimization. The higher the mosaicity, the larger is the integrated reflectivity, and thus the effective area, but the broader is the signal on the focal plane detector. These two effects act in opposite senses in the optimization of the sensitivity.\nThe crystal thickness is also an important factor for the optimization of the crystal reflectivity and therefore for the maximization of the Laue lens sensitivity. Eq. 8 provides the thickness that maximizes the reflectivity for a given material and for fixed diffraction planes. As the best thickness is also a function of energy it is expected that, depending on the adopted geometry, crystals dedicated to high energy are thicker than those used to diffract low energies. It must be also taken into account that, the choice of the thickness maximizing the reflectivity would often lead to a mass unacceptable for a satellite-borne experiment. A trade-off between lens throughput and mass is then necessary.\nNarrow- and broad-band Laue lenses\nDepending on the scientific goal to be tackled, Laue lens can be designed, or adjusted, with two different optimizations: lenses for a broad energy pass-band (e.g. 100 keV - 1 MeV) or those configured to achieve a high sensitivity over one or more limited range(s) of energy. The latter can be valuable for studying gamma-ray lines, or narrow band radiation. Relevant energies of interest might be the 511 keV e+/e- annihilation energy or the 800-900 keV energy range for its importance in Supernova emission. The two classes of Laue lenses need different optimizations and dispositions of the crystals over the available geometric area. For a narrow energy pass-band Laue lens as many as possible of the crystals should be tuned to the same energy. According to Eq. 3, the d-spacing of the crystals should ideally increase in proportion to their radial distance from the focal axis in order keep the diffracted energy fixed.\nThe energy range of a broadband Laue lens follows from Eq. 3. With the focal length and d-spacing of the crystalline diffraction planes both fixed, the energy range will be from\nEmin = hc F\ndhkl Rmax to Emax = hc F dhkl Rmin ,\nwhere the radial extent of the lens is Rmin to Rmax. If the inner and outer radii are fixed, the simultaneous use of different materials, and thus of different dhkl , would allow enlarging the Laue lens energy pass-band compared with a single-material Laue lens. Equivalently, for given energy pass-band and focal length, the use of multi-material crystals would allow a more compact lens."

            "text": "A classical Laue lens with fixed inner/outer radius and focal length has a pass-band which is uniquely defined by the d-spacing of the crystals used. The red curve in Figure 6 shows the effective area of an example 100 m focal length Laue lens configured to cover a 300 - 800 keV energy pass-band.\nIf all of the crystals could be retuned for different focal lengths, the Laue less could be made sensitive to different pass-bands. Furthermore, as shown in Figure\n6, the larger the focal length, the broader the pass-band and the higher the integrated effective area. The adjustment in orbit is not trivial - both the orientation of thousands of crystals and the lens to detector separation must be changed and verified. The former requires thousands of actuators and a sophisticated optical system.\nAn innovative mechanism for the adjustment of the orientation of a crystal, along with an optical system for monitoring alignment of each one, has nevertheless been proposed [27, 28]. The mechanism is based on a miniature piezo-actuator coupled with a tilt pedestal and does not require power once a crystal has been correctly oriented. It is assumed that the lens and detector are on separate spacecraft that can be manoeuvred to adjust their separation.\nMultiple layer Laue lenses\nA possible way to increase the flux collection from a lens is to use two or more layers of crystals covering the same area. For instance, two layers of crystals can be used, one on each side of the lens structure. In order to focus at the same position, crystals placed at the same radius but in different layers must diffract at the same angle, so different crystals or Bragg planes must be used to diffract different energies.\nIn a simulations [27] two layers of thin crystals made with Ag(111) and Ag(200), increased the effective area by about 65% (see Fig. 7). A third layer did not fur-\nther increase the lens throughput. It must be stressed that with multiple layers, the diffracted radiation from any one layer will be attenuated by all of the other layers. The number of layers maximizing the effective area will depend on the crystals parameters (thickness, mosaicity, diffraction efficiency).\nFlux concentration and imaging properties of Laue lenses\nThe sensitivity of a telescope using a Laue lens depends on the effective area over which flux is collected, but because observations will almost always be background limited it is also a function of the extent to which the collected flux is concentrated into a compact region in the detector plane.\nFor a given lens design the collecting area at a particular energy is just the sum of the areas of the crystals multiplied by their reflecting efficiency at that energy. Obviously only those crystals for which the incidence angle is close to the Bragg angle need be considered. In practice this means that the only crystals that contribute are those with centres that fall inside an annulus whose width depends on the extent, \u2206\u03b8 , of the rocking curve. For broadband lenses the incidence angle is a simple inverse function of radius from the axis. Consequently crystals at the centre of the band will contribute most, with the response decreasing towards the edges of the annulus. Making the small angle approximation \u03b8 = r/2F , the width of the annulus is given by:\n\u2206r = \u2206\u03b8\nd\u03b8/dr = 2F\u2206\u03b8 . (16)\nAs the radius of the annulus is also proportional to F this means that its area is proportional to F2.\nBecause each crystal simply changes the direction of the incoming parallel beam it will illuminate a region in the detector plane identical in size and shape to the profile it presents to the incoming radiation. This immediately means that the focal spot can never be smaller than the size of the crystals. Moreover, crystals that are not at the centre of the illuminating annulus will have a \u2018footprint\u2019 in the detector plane that is offset from the instrument axis by a corresponding distance. Thus to a good approximation the radial form of the on-axis PSF of a broadband Laue lens is the convolution of the (scaled) rocking curve and a flat-topped function corresponding to the crystal size2.\nAs is usual with telescopes, other things being equal, the best signal to noise ratio will be obtained with a compact PSF.\n\u2022 In circumstances where use of smaller crystals is feasible and would lead to a significantly narrower PSF then choosing them will always offer an advantage.\n2 The azimuthal extent of the crystals has been ignored and it is assumed that the crystals are smoothly distributed in radius.\n\u2022 If the PSF width is dominated by the rocking curve width the situation is more complex. Decreasing the mosaicity will then narrow the PSF but also decrease the area of the diffracting annulus, reducing the advantage to be gained. \u2022 Lastly because of the F2 dependence of the area of lens over which crystals diffract a given energy, a wider PSF can actually provide an advantage if it is the result of an increased focal length - although the signal will be spread over a detector area proportional to F2, the uncertainty due to background only increases as F . This of course assumes that such a design is feasible given the cost and mass of the larger lens and detector.\nThe above discussion concerns the response to an on-axis source. As Laue lenses are single reflection optics, they do not fulfill the Abbe sine condition and therefore for off-axis sources they are subject to coma. The aberrations are very severe as illustrated in Figure 8. The integrated flux is little affected by off-axis pointing, but importantly the image is smeared over a larger area and thus the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal is significantly reduced."

            "text": "In a Laue lens it obviously important that each crystal is properly oriented. It is useful to consider three angles describing the orientation of a generic crystal:\n\u2022 (i) a rotation \u03b1 about an axis parallel to the instrument axis. If there is an error in \u03b1 , diffraction will occur with the expected efficiency but the photons will arrive in the focal plane displaced by a distance R\u2206\u03b1 , where R is the distance of the crystal from the instrument axis. This displacement should be kept small compared with the spatial scale of the PSF.\n\u2022 (ii) a rotation \u03c6 about an axis normal to the diffracting crystal planes. To first order an error in \u03c6 will not have any effect on efficiency or imaging.\n\u2022 (iii) a rotation \u03b8 about an axis in the plane of the crystal plane and orthogonal to the instrument axis. If \u03b8 does not have the intended value then the energy at which the reflectivity is highest will change. For any given energy, the position in the focal plane where photons of a given energy are arrive will not be altered. However the number of photons diffracted by the crystal may either increase or decrease depending on the energy considered.\nThe probable effect is a spreading of the PSF as a result of enhancing the response of crystals that are not at the optimum radius for diffracting photons of a given energy towards the centre of the focal spot, at the expense of that of those that are. To avoid such spreading, errors in \u03b8 should be kept much smaller than the rocking curve width.\nThe most obvious mounting method is to use adhesives to bond the crystals to a supporting structure at their proper position and orientation. However due to glue deformation during the polymerization phases it has not proven easy to maintain the necessary precision [29, 30]. The amount of misalignment that is introduced depends on the type of adhesive used and on the polymerization process (two components epoxy adhesive, UV curable, thermal polymerization, etc.).\nIn the CLAIRE experiment the effects of uncertainties in the bonding process were avoided by the use of a manual adjustment mechanism (Sect: The CLAIRE balloon project (2001)), but this technique is probably not appropriate for space instrumentation."

One possible way is to install mirror reflectors on the lens structure, the orientation of which can be monitored, perhaps from a separate detector spacecraft. If the attachment technique for these mirrors is similar to that used for the Laue crystals the long-term stability of the mirror alignment will also give some confidence in the stability of the crystal mounting.\nExamples of Laue lens projects\nIn this section we will review the Laue lens experiments that have been realized or proposed from the early 2000s until the present.

It was designed for focusing photons with energy \u223c 170 keV, with a pass-band of \u223c 4 keV at a focal distance of 2.8 m. The lens (Figure 10) consisted of 659 Germanium/Silicon mosaic crystals arranged in 8 concentric rings providing a collecting area of 511 cm2 and a field of view (FOV) of 90 arcseconds. The mosaicity of the crystals selected was in the range 60 to 120 arc-seconds, leading to an angular resolution for the instrument of 25-30 arcseconds. Two crystal sizes were used: 10 \u00d7 10 mm2 and 7 \u00d710 mm2. The crystals focused the radiation onto a Germanium detector with 9 elements, each 15 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 40 mm3, having an equivalent volume for background noise of 18 cm3.\nThe fine tuning of the lens utilized a mechanical system capable of tilting each crystal tile until the correct diffracted energy was detected. The crystals were mounted via flexible lamellae on a rigid Titanium frame. The tuning of the individual crystals was done manually with adjustment screws. Due to the finite distance (14 m) of the X-ray source during the crystal tuning phase, the gamma-ray energy used was lowered from 170 keV to 122 keV. Moreover, also due to the finite source distance used for the crystals alignment, only a limited fraction of each crys-\ntal was effectively diffracting at the tuning energy, their subtended angle (about 150 arc-seconds, as seen from the source) being much larger that the crystal mosaicity.\nThe performance of the complete lens was verified using a powerful industrial X-ray source at a distance of 200 m, (hence a diffracted energy of 165.4 keV). Seen from a distance of 200 m each crystal subtended an angle of about 10 arc-seconds, i.e. significantly less than the crystal mosaic width.\nThe CLAIRE lens was flown twice on balloon campaigns in 2000 and 2001. In both flights the target source was the Crab Nebula. The observed diffracted signal at 170 keV was found to be consistent with that expected from the Crab Nebula given the lens peak efficiency, estimated at about 8% from ground measurements [34]."

For a review see [50]. The circumstances in which such lenses offer diffraction limited resolution are discussed in 1.\nAlthough the idea of Fresnel lenses for gamma-rays was introduced at least as far back as 2001 [51, 52]. when their potential for micro-arc-second imaging was pointed out, the idea has rested largely dormant. It will be seen below that the main reason for this is the extremely long focal lengths of such lenses. A secondary reason is that although they offer effective areas far greater than any other technique, with a simple lens the bandwidth over which this is achieved is narrow because of chromatic aberration. However, if those difficulties can be overcome, gammaray Fresnel lenses offer some unique possibilities. Like Laue lenses, Fresnel lenses provide a way of concentrating incoming gamma-rays onto a small, and hence low background, detector. A gamma-ray Fresnel lens could focus the flux incident on an aperture that could be many square metres into a millimetre scale spot with close to 100% efficiency. Moreover, such a lens would also provide true imaging in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between incident direction and positions in a focal plane. At photon energies above the limits of grazing energy optics no other technique can do this. Finally, the imaging can be diffraction-limited, which in the gamma-ray band with a metre scale aperture means sub-micro-arcsecond resolution. What is more, even if missions employing them present challenges, gamma-ray Fresnel lenses are, per se, low-technology items.\nA conventional refractive lens, operating for example in the visible band, focuses radiation by introducing a radius-dependent delay such that radiation from different parts of the lens arrives at the focal spot with the same phase (Figure 13a). A Fresnel lens 3 (Figure 13b) achieves the same phase-matching by taking advantage of the fact that the phase of the incoming radiation never needs to be changed by more than 2\u03c0 . Consequently the maximum thickness of the lens can be reduced to that necessary to produce a phase change of 2\u03c0 , a thickness termed here t2\u03c0 . It is usual to write the complex refractive index as n = 1\u2212\u03b4 \u2212 i\u03b2 where for gamma-rays both \u03b4 and \u03b2 are small and positive. The imaginary component describes absorption and does not affect the phase so t2\u03c0 = \u03bb/\u03b4 where \u03bb is the wavelength. The fact that \u03b4 is positive for gamma-rays means that a converging lens has a concave profile and a Fresnel lens has the form illustrated in Figure 13c. It is a more efficient form of a \u2018Phase Zone Plate\u2018 (Figure 13d) in which the thickness profile has just two levels differing in phase shift by \u03c0 .\nThe parameter \u03b4 is given in terms of the atomic scattering factor f1(x,Z) discussed in Section Crystal diffraction by:\n\u03b4 = re\u03bb 2\n2\u03c0 na f1(x,Z) (17)\nwhere re is the classical electron radius and na is the atomic density. For lenses of the type considered here x is essentially zero. Well above all absorption edges f1 approaches the atomic number Z and so is constant. Thus \u03b4 is proportional to \u03bb 2 or inversely proportional to the square of the photon energy E.\nIn principle in the region of the 1.022 MeV threshold for pair production in the nuclear electric field and above, Delbru\u0308ck scattering should be taken into consideration. Early reports of an unexpectedly large contribution to \u03b4 from this effect [53] turned out to be mistaken [54] but did lead to experimental confirmations of predicted gamma-ray refractive indices at energies up to 2 MeV [55, 56]. Like those from Delbru\u0308ck scattering, contributions from nuclear resonant scattering will also be negligible in most circumstances.\nAlthough \u03b4 is extremely small at gamma-ray energies, the wavelength is also extremely short, for example 1.24 pico-metres at 1 MeV. Using \u03b4 from Eq. 17 results in the following expression for t2\u03c0 in terms of some example parameters\nt2\u03c0 = \u03bb \u03b4 = 2.98 ( Z A )\u22121( E 1 MeV )( \u03c1 1 g cm\u22123 )\u22121 mm. (18)\nNoting that for materials of interest Z/A is in the range 0.4 to 0.5, this means that a gamma-ray Fresnel lens need have a thickness only of the order of millimetres.\nThe period of the sawtooth profile where it is lowest at the edge of the lens is a crucial parameter. Again in terms of example parameters, for a lens of diameter d and focal length F the minimum period is given by\n3 Strictly the term used should be \u201cPhase Fresnel Lens\u201d as the shorter form can also be used for stepped lenses in which coherence is not maintained between steps\npmin = 2\u03bb F d = 2.48\n( E\n1 MeV )\u22121( F 109 m )( d 1 m )\u22121 mm. (19)\nThe difficulties lie in the F term. For reasonable values of pmin extremely long focal lengths are required.\npmin is an important parameter in another respect. The PSF will be an Airy function with a FWHM of 1.03\u03bb/d, so the focal spot size using this measure will be given by\nw = 1.03 F\u03bb d = 0.501pmin (20)\nThat is to say the size of the focal spot is about half the period at the periphery of the lens. The corresponding angular resolution is w/F and is given in micro-arcseconds (\u00b5\u201d) by\n\u2206\u03b8d = 0.263 (\nE 1 MeV )\u22121( d 1 m )\u22121 . (21)\nThus gamma-ray Fresnel lenses have the potential to form images with an angular resolution better than available in any other waveband and would be capable of\nresolving, for example, structures on the scale of the event horizons of extra-galactic massive black holes."

Except at energies above 1 MeV the required thickness is also of the order of millimetres (Fig. 14a) so high aspect ratios are not then needed. Almost any convenient material can be used \u2013 the nuclei only serve to hold in place the cloud of electrons that produces the phase shifts! Dense materials have the advantage of minimising thickness but also tend to be of higher Z and hence more lossy at low and high energies. Over much of the gamma-ray band all reasonably low Z materials have similarly low losses (Figure 14b). Because the refractive index is so close to unity, dimensional tolerances are relatively slack. Using the Mare\u0301chal formula [57], if the rms errors in the profile are kept within 3.5% of the maximum lens thickness (assumed to be t2\u03c0 ) the loss in Strehl ratio (on-axis intensity) will be less than 5%. If the lens is assembled from segments then the precision needed in their alignment is only at a similar level. Thus a range of constructional technologies can be considered, including diamond point turning, vapour-phase deposition, photo-chemical etching and 3-d printing."

When this is coupled with a requirement for a reasonable collecting area Eq. 19 implies a focal length of the order of 105\u2013106 km. This sort of focal length clearly demands formation flying of two spacecraft, one carrying the lens and the other a focal plane detector. Minimising station-keeping propulsion requirement suggests locations near to a Sun-Earth Lagrangian point.\nThe line of sight from detector to lens must be controlled with sufficient accuracy to keep the image on the detector, so the precision needed depends on the size of the detector. This could be from a few cm up to perhaps 1m. Changes in the direction of that line of sight need to be determined with an accuracy corresponding to the angular resolution aimed for, which could be sub-micro-arcsecond.\nDetailed studies have been performed of missions with requirements that meet all of these requirements separately. Not all are met together in any single study, but on the other hand the complexity of the instrumentation and spacecraft was in each case much greater than that for a gamma-ray Fresnel telescope. New Worlds Observer requires a 50 m star shade and a 4 m visible-light diffraction-limited telescope to be separated by 8\u00d7 104 km [58]. The transverse position of the telescope\nmust be maintained to within a few cm. The MAXIM X-ray interferometer mission calls for a fleet of 26 spacecraft distributed over an area 1 km in diameter to be separated from a detector craft 2\u00d7 104 km away [59, 60]. The requirement for a diffraction-limited gamma-ray Fresnel lens mission to track changes in the orientation of the configuration in inertial space at the sub-micro-arcsecond level are similar to the corresponding requirement for MAXIM, though only two spacecraft are needed. MAXIM studies envisaged a \u2018super star tracker\u2019. Such a device could locate a beacon on the lens spacecraft relative to a stellar reference frame. In terms of separation distance, the requirement for \u223c 106 km separation can be compared with the needs of the LISA gravitational wave mission [61] for which 3 spacecraft must each be separated from the others by 2.5\u00d7106 km, though in this case it is the rate of change of inter-spacecraft distance that requires strict monitoring rather than the orientation."

            "heading": "Effective area",
            "text": "The focusing efficiency of a gamma-ray Fresnel lens will depend on the fraction of incoming radiation that passes unabsorbed through the lens and on the efficiency with which that radiation is concentrated into a focal spot.\nIn Figure 14b the mean transmission of a lens with a maximum thickness of t2\u03c0 and a typical profile is shown for some example materials. Transmissions in excess of 95% should generally be possible. For an Airy disc 84% of the radiation falls within the central peak, that is to say within a radius equal to the resolution according to the Rayleigh criterion. As noted in Section Construction, allowing for profile errors with an rms level of 3.5% rms of the maximum height could reduce the Strehl ratio by 5%. If the errors are random, the form of the PSF will be little changed and so the effective area will be reduced in proportion. Combining all these factors together indicates a focussing efficiency of about 75%.\nWe take as a reference design a 2 m diameter lens made from polycarbonate with a nominal working energy of 500 keV and focal length 106 km. The baseline active thickness is taken to be t2\u03c0 = 1.15 mm but absorption in a 2 mm substrate has been allowed for. Additional support against diaphragm mode vibrations would obviously be needed during launch but out of plane distortions during operation have little effect.\nAllowing for the above factors, an effective area over 20000 cm2 should be attainable with a simple Fresnel lens having these parameters. The diffraction-limited angular resolution of such a lens would be 0.31 micro-arc-seconds."

            "text": "Unfortunately the above indication of a possible effective area applies only at the particular energy and focal distance for which the lens has been designed. An important limit to the performance of a Fresnel lens is the chromatic nature of the imaging. The bandwidth over which the good focussing is achieved is very narrow. For even quite small deviations from the wavelength for which the profile has been designed the focal length changes and for a fixed detector position the focal spot rapidly becomes blurred. The FWHM of the on-axis intensity as a function of energy is approximately\n\u03b4\u03bb \u03bb = \u03b4E E = 1.79 NF\n(22)\nwhere NF is the Fresnel number, r2/( f \u03bb ). When the lens thickness is t2\u03c0 then NF is equal to twice the number of rings.\nIf the flux within a focal spot the size of the ideal Airy peak is used as a measure of the response, then the bandwidth is somewhat larger, with the numerical factor in Eq. 22 increased to about 2.95, and if the flux from a larger detector region is accepted, then the bandwidth increases further as seen in Figure 15. The improvement will be at the expense of poorer angular resolution and increased detector background. Note that the diffraction-limited angular resolution will anyway only be available if the detector energy resolution is good enough to select only those photons within \u2206E. For a High Purity Germanium detector (see Volume 2 of this work, 2 ) then \u03b4EE \u223c 4\u00d7 10\n\u22123 at 500 keV, effectively setting a limit of about 700 on the useful Fresnel Number of a diffraction limited telescope using a simple gamma-ray Fresnel lens.\nOver a much wider band, good focussing can be recovered by adjusting the detector position (Figure 15) but only radiation within the narrow bands can be focussed efficiently for any given position. There is a direct analogy with the tunable Laue lenses described in Tunable Laue lens, but for a Fresnel lens no adjustment is required to the lens, only a change in focal distance.\nFor visible and IR radiation it has been shown possible to increase the bandpass of Fresnel lenses by correcting the chromaticity of one diffractive lens with that of another one of opposite power, but such systems cannot produce a real image as is required for a gamma-ray telescope [62, 50]. Similarly schemes used in those wavebands to make \u201dMultiorder\u201d or \u201dHarmonic\u201d Fresnel lenses by increasing the maximum thickness of the lens so that it becomes a (different) integer multiple of t2\u03c0 at each wavelength [63, 64] do not work in the gamma-ray band. A small part of the surface of such a lens can be regarded as a diffraction grating blazed to direct radiation into the appropriate order, but as t2\u03c0 for gamma-rays is almost universally proportional to \u03bb\u22121, the blaze angle cannot be correct at different energies.\nHowever various possibilities do exist for alleviating the chromaticity problem:\n1. \u2018Axilenses\u2019 in which the pitch is varied in ways other than the r\u22121 variation of a regular Fresnel lens. This can produce an enlarged bandwidth at the expense of\nefficiency [65]. The integral over energy of the effective area is close to that of a corresponding classical Fresnel lens. 2. Achromatic doublets. While the focal length of a diffractive lens for X-rays or gamma-rays is proportional to E, that of a refractive lens is even more strongly dependent on energy, being proportional to E2. In various contexts [52, 66, 67] it has been pointed out that consequently diffractive and refractive lenses for which the focal lengths are\nfd = (\nE E0 ) f0 2\nfr =\u2212 (\nE E0\n)2 f0 (23)\ncan be combined to form an achromatic doublet for which the combined focal length is to first order independent of wavelength. In the gamma-ray band the absorption losses for a full refractive lens with useful parameters are likely to be prohibitive but steps that are many times t2\u03c0 can be introduced. This leads to a lens having a profile corresponding to the combination of those shown in Figure 16(a) and (b). Fig 16(c) is a zoom on parts of the fine structure in the diffractive component, (b). At a given radius only the total thickness is important, so the two components can be separate as shown, or back to back in s single component, or the diffractive profile can be superimposed on that of the refractive one. With such lens focusing then be achieved at a number of wavelengths over an extended band (Figure 17(a)). The peak effective area is less than that for a single lens but\nthe integral can be several times higher. The mass of the lens will be many times that of a simple lens and the finest scale of the structure must be a factor of two smaller.\n3. Multi-wavelength lenses. Recently, a number of papers have been published describing the design of \u2018achromatic diffractive lenses\u2019 for UV/visible/IR radiation (e.g. [68]). The approach used is to optimise the thickness of a number of concentric rings so that the imaging performance over a number of wavelengths is as good as possible based of some figure of merit. The same technique can be used to design gamma-ray lenses. At first sight the reported performance of the IR lens designs is remarkably good with, for example, 91% \u2018average efficiency\u2019 reported over wavelengths spanning a factor of 2. On detailed examination, though, the efficiency is low except at a few specific wavelengths for which the design was optimised and analysis suggests that even at these wavelengths the efficiency may have been overestimated [69]. If the maximum thickness is restricted to be \u223c t2\u03c0 then the integrated effective area of a lens designed in this way is found to be similar to that of a simple Fresnel lens. If larger thicknesses are allowed then the performance and limitations are similar to those for an achromat of the same total thickness but there is the possibility of choosing the energies at which the performance is optimised. An example is illustrated in Figure 17 (b) which shows the effective area of a lens designed to work simultaneously at the energies of 4 astrophysical gamma-ray lines. The approach used is basically that described by Doskolovich et al. [70] which maximises the Strehl ratio averaged over the design energies. However an additional step was performed in which different target phases were tried and that selected which resulted in the highest value for the minimum over the four energies of the effective area, thus avoiding solutions in which one dominated.\nDetector issues for focused gamma-rays\nA discussion of detectors for gamma-ray astronomy can be found in Volume 2 of this work. Here we present some specific considerations for detectors for focusing gamma-ray telescopes.\n\u2022 Low Background. Gamma-ray observations are almost always limited by background from diffuse sky emission and events arising directly or indirectly from\ncosmic-rays. It is imperative to suppress these as far as possible. Shielding is heavy and even active shielding is imperfect, some background actually being created by the shielding itself. \u2022 Sensitivity to Photon Arrival Direction. A key method of background reduction in the low energy gamma-ray band involves extracting information about the direction from which a photon arrived. Where the first interaction of a photon in the detector is a Compton scattering and the 3-d locations of that and subsequent interactions can be recorded a Compton kinematics analysis allows constraints to be placed on the arrival direction. Although there are ambiguities and in the MeV range the precision is limited to a few degrees, background can be drastically reduced by selecting only events whose direction is consistent with having passed through the lens. Obviously such analysis is not possible for all events, but it is possible to identify a subset of low detection efficiency, very low background, events and give these a high weight during analysis. \u2022 Position Resolution. In an imaging system it is strictly the position where a photon first interacts in the detector that is important, though the location of the centroid of all energy deposits may provide an adequate approximation. Even when the instrument is used as a flux-collector the position information can be used to define a region of the detector within which events are counted or, better, to attribute to each event a weight depending on the noise level and the expected response at its location. The latter amounts to \u2019PSF fitting\u2019. Of course Compton kinematics analysis requires recording the positions in 3-d of subsequent interactions as well as the first. \u2022 Spatial extent For a Laue lens a large detector will allow all of the events in the broad wings of the PSF to be captured. With the long focal lengths associated with Fresnel lenses, fields of view tend to be very small and are limited by how large a detector is feasible. In either case a large detector can provide regions that can be used for contemporaneous background estimation, obviating or reducing the need for \u2019off-source\u2019 observations \u2022 Energy Resolution. As gamma-ray lenses operate over a limited band, good energy resolution reduces the amount of background accompanying the signal. Fresnel lenses, particularly those that are large or have less extreme focal lengths, suffer from severe chromatic aberration so this is crucial where they are used. More generally, insufficient energy resolution will degrade the angular resolution of the Compton kinematic reconstruction and so increase the background. \u2022 Detection efficiency Detection efficiency is a major problem in the MeV region. The photons are very penetrating and a non-negligible fraction of photons traverse the detector without interacting at all.\nThe constraints resulting from these objectives are often conflicting. A dense detector is desirable to maximise efficiency, but for Compton reconstruction low density materials are favoured. Compton reconstruction requires measuring position and the energy deposits at multiple sites but on the other hand electronic read-out noise has least impact on energy resolution if all of the charge is fed to a single preamplifier.\nHigh purity Germanium detectors provide good efficiency and currently the best energy resolution. Germanium based Compton cameras are well advanced and demonstrated [1]. Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) elements have an energy resolution that is only slightly inferior, do not need cooling and can be assembled in large arrays. More complex detectors using a 3d-imaging Silicon scattering column surrounded by a 3d-imaging CZT-shield absorbing the scattered photons may reach a higher efficiency, but are currently at a development stage [39]."

            "text": "Diffractive gamma-ray optics is a field yet to be explored and exploited. Nevertheless, Laue and Fresnel lenses offer unique possibilities. The examples shown in this review illustrate both their capabilities and their limitations. An important consideration in choosing a lens design is the expected signal and how it compares with the likely event rate due to background in the detector. Increasing the effective area is not necessarily an advantage if the background noise increases. For photonstarved observations of continuum sources, though, large integrated effective areas are needed. For applications in which lower effective area or poorer resolution are adequate, reduced diameter or shorter focal lengths can be considered. In some cases an array of smaller lenses can provide the best solution.\nObservational MeV astrophysics is still in its infancy. We only know of a handful of low energy gamma-ray point sources. This is even less than the number known at 100 MeV and above from the SAS-2 and COS-B missions in the 1970s and 1980s. Today high energy gamma-ray sources are counted in the thousands. For MeV astrophysics we now await results from the COSI mission [71], which in a few years will give us a much clearer picture of the sky at a few MeV, that will be very important in designing future gamma-ray telescopes."
