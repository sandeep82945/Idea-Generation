    "abstractText": "Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is one of the most widely used molecular markers to help researchers understand the relationship between phenotypes and genotypes. SNP calling mainly consists of two steps, including read alignment and locus identification based on statistical models, and various software have been developed and applied in this issue. Meanwhile, in our study, very low agreement (<25%) was found among the prediction results generated by different software, which was much less consistent than expected. In order to obtain the optimal protocol of SNP mining in tree species, the algorithm principles of different alignment and SNP mining software were discussed in detail. And the prediction results were further validated based on in silico and experimental methods. In addition, hundreds of validated SNPs were provided along with some practical suggestions on program selection and accuracy improvement were provided, and we wish that these results could lay the foundation for the subsequent analysis of SNP mining.",

In humans, many serious diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, as well as several essential traits, are closely associated with low-frequency SNPs [2\u20134]. SNPs are also widely used in agriculture and forestry to detect significant variation that may be correlated with resistance or growth [5,6]. In addition, they are currently one of the most popular molecular markers in genetic evolutionary studies and are particularly suitable for diploid species [7]. The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, represented by the 454/Roche, SOLiD/ABI, and Solexa/Illumina sequencing platforms, has further facilitated SNP-related research [8]. In general, the following three steps are required during the SNP calling process. The first step is the removal of low-quality reads to obtain clean data. The next step is alignment between the reference and the clean reads. The complete genome sequence of a species is the most appropriate choice for setting as the reference, and the de novo assembly results would be the alternative if the genome is missing. And the last step is the mining work according to the alignment results to identify potential SNPs based on different statistical models. The quality of the alignment result and the performance of the SNP calling program are crucial for the final SNP mining result. Currently, a large number of SNP calling programs have been developed [9], while in many studies, researchers\u2019 choice\nLife 2023, 13, 1069. https://doi.org/10.3390/life13051069 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/life\nof analysis software seems to be not uniform, and the consistency of results of different software could be quite different [10]. For tree species and several other plants, SNP mining and sequencing are relatively more difficult and costly due to their highly heterozygous genotypes, together with generally large genome sizes and complex genome structures. Currently, with the exception of a few well-studied tree species, the quality of most tree genomes is unsatisfactory, especially in terms of accurate annotation of gene structure and repeat sequences [11]. It should be noted that a mass of repetitive sequences can seriously affect the accuracy of the alignment when using SNP calling programs. In addition, the typical characteristics of high heterozygosity make it more difficult to mine SNPs accurately in tree species. Therefore, how to establish an accurate and robust SNP calling protocol that is feasible for forestry researchers may be one of the most important issues in the field [12]. To address this issue, two of the most widely used alignment programs were selected, including BWA [13] and Bowtie2 [14]. Three widely used SNP calling programs based on high-throughput sequencing data were also evaluated in detail. Moreover, in the validation process of potential SNPs, both experimental together with data simulation methods were applied for verification. We wish that our work will serve as a reference for researchers in the selection of optimal SNP calling programs, as well as a complement for the experimental validation of SNPs in tree species."

The core algorithms of them are full-text minute-space-index (FM-index) [15] and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) [16]. The BWT algorithm is an important data compression method that was originally developed for string compression, and then this method was gradually applied to the genome alignment field (Figure 1). The original biological sequence, such as the string of \u201cATGGACT\u201d is difficult to compress and would occupy more storage space (A:1, T:1, G:2, A:1, C:1, T:1, respectively). Meanwhile, after BWT treatment, this sequence would be stored more compactly without losing any information (A: 2, C: 1, G: 2, T: 2, respectively). In detail, the original string (ATGGACT) would be shifted base by base to form an array, then all the elements in this array are sorted by the first column of this array in order to create a new index. Then, the original string could be restored according to the relationship between the first and last columns of this new index. The FM-index algorithm is based on the BWT method, it first performs BWT on the strings and then several compression methods are combined, such as Huffman coding [17], to better compress the data. The sequence alignment map (SAM) output format is widely used in high-throughput RNA-seq analysis [18]. The format consists mainly of a header section (annotation information) and an alignment section (alignment result information). This format could simply be considered as another type of information compression, and our following analysis will all be based on this format or its binary format (Binary Alignment Map, BAM)."

In addition, SAMtools can be applied directly to multi-samples with filtering of base qualities. In GATK-HC, the core algorithm is divided into four steps. The first step is to identify the active regions. Since this software uses the theory of de novo assembly, and it takes too much time to reassemble each region, the active regions are first identified according to the alignment scores. Second, the active regions are reconstructed based on string or hash table in order to obtain haplotypes. Each haplotype is then re-aligned to the initial reference sequence and raw SNPs are found in this step. These raw results are further processed in the next step. The third step is the calculation of the likelihood to evaluate if these haplotypes have enough evidence. In this step, base quality scores and some other quality information are mainly considered. The final step is genotyping and output of final screening results. Tables containing the probability information and some other information are generated according to each candidate, and these potential SNPs are evaluated to estimate the genotype at each locus with the highest probability. Freebayes relies on Bayesian models to predict small variations. Freebayes can call SNPs based on the literal sequences of reads aligned to a particular target, rather than their exact alignment. It uses BAM files for any number of individuals from a population and the reference genome to determine the most likely combination of genotypes at each position. It can also use the variant call format (VCF) as a source of prior information and a copy number variant map to define non-uniform ploidy variation across the samples under analysis.\n2.3.

During the SNP prediction process in the poplar genome, the differences in running time among the alignment and prediction program combinations were not significant (less than 40 min). Among the tested combinations, BWA + Freebayes took the least time, lasting for 24 min 4 s (alignment: 8 min 33 s; SNP calling: 15 min 31 s), and Bowtie2 + SAMtools took the most time, lasting for 37 min 44 s (alignment: 21 min 50 s; SNP calling: 15 min 54 s). When the input was the transcriptome data set, the running time of the different programs showed differences to the previous results (Table 1). Among all three SNP callers, Freebayes still took the least time regardless of the alignment tool selected, and GATK-HC took the most time. The time spent on GATK-HC/Freebayes was almost half when Bowtie2 was used instead of BWA as alignment tool. The running time on SAMtools was close with both alignment tools.

The first algorithm proposed to align two sequences is dynamic programming, which is widely used in several alignment programs, including the well-known basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [25]. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of NGS sequencing, custom sequence alignment algorithms are not sufficient for these rapidly increasing sequencing data. Both BWA and Bowtie2 are developed to solve two essential problems caused by sequencing platforms: sequencing length and sequencing errors (including mismatch, insertions, and deletions). Two major derivative strategies, hash table and suffix tree, were then proposed to solve these two problems [26].

On the other hand, suffix tree indexing has become increasingly popular in alignment, and both BWA and Bowtie2 are based on this theory. Suffix tree is a rooted tree-like data structure, and this structure could store all the suffix sequences of a string. Although this structure could store all the information, it would still take up a lot of space, and the cache information could not be used efficiently. In this case, Suffix Array (SA) is developed to make a trade-off between time consumption and space occupation, and BWT or FM-index are all based on this basic data structure [27].

The main advantage of MAQ is its very fast speed when calling SNPs within a single individual, whereas the time consumption can increase very quickly when dealing with different samples or long sequences. SAMtools modifies the algorithm of MAQ and could be suitable for multiple samples with much higher speed. SAMtools infers the likelihood function of a genotype based on the prior probability and the minimum sequencing error rate. Note that although SAMtools is usually faster, the algorithm is relatively simpler than GATK-HC and the filtering process is ignored. According to our previous results, SAMtools performed best on G. biloba data set. Meanwhile, GATK-HC had a much more sophisticated framework than SAMtools and Freebayes, which we expected to have the highest accuracy. Given the de novo assembly and critical filtering processes in GATK-HC, it is reasonable to assume that the quality of the input data set could significantly affect the output. If the input sequences were coupled with low sequencing coverage, it is very likely that the de novo assembly of sub-regions would be unsatisfactory. In this case, the subsequent filtering process would remove too many potentially positive SNPs, which is mainly influenced by the sequencing depth and the quality of the reference.\n3.4. Experimental Validation and SNP Mining with the Optimized Protocol In addition to testing with simulated data, we also evaluated the predictive efficiency of the software on real transcriptome data. Using PCR amplification and the Sanger sequencing method, eight unigenes were randomly selected over continuous time periods in G. biloba kernels, and the initial transcriptome sequences were manually aligned with the corresponding Sanger sequencing results. If the double-peak phenomenon could be clearly observed together with the base variation, the putative site could be considered as a validated SNV/SNP (Figure 6). The high-resolution melting curve method has been used previously to mine SNPs in the Ginkgo transcriptome [31], while the Sanger method is cheaper and requires less instrumentation, and this validation method has been used in previous SNP mining in poplar [32]. The results showed that the number of predicted SNPs was much higher with BWA than with Bowtie2, which was consistent with the previous results with the simulation (Table 2).

The main advantage of MAQ is its very fast speed when calling SNPs within a single individual, whereas the time consumption can increase very quickly when dealing with different samples or long sequences. SAMtools modifies the algorithm of MAQ and could be suitable for multiple samples with much higher speed. SAMtools infers the likelihood function of a genotype based on the prior probability and the minimum sequencing error rate. Note that although SAMtools is usually faster, the algorithm is relatively simpler than GATK-HC and the filtering process is ignored. According to our previous results, SAMtools performed best on G. biloba data set. Meanwhile, GATK-HC had a much more sophisticated framework than SAMtools and\nFreebayes, which we expected to have the highest accuracy. Given the de novo assembly and critical filtering processes in GATK-HC, it is reasonable to assume that the quality of the input data set could significantly affect the output. If the input sequences were coupled with low sequencing coverage, it is very likely that the de novo assembly of sub-regions would be unsatisfactory. In this case, the subsequent filtering process would remove too many potentially positive SNPs, which is mainly influenced by the sequencing depth and the quality of the reference."

Using PCR amplification and the Sanger sequencing method, eight unigenes were randomly selected over continuous time periods in G. biloba kernels, and the initial transcriptome sequences were manually aligned with the corresponding Sanger sequencing results. If the double-peak phenomenon could be clearly observed together with the base variation, the putative site could be considered as a validated SNV/SNP (Figure 6). The high-resolution melting curve method has been used previously to mine SNPs in the Ginkgo transcriptome [31], while the Sanger method is cheaper and requires less instrumentation, and this validation method has been used in previous SNP mining in poplar [32]. The results showed that the number of predicted SNPs was much higher with BWA than with Bowtie2, which was consistent with the previous results with the simulation (Table 2). In addition, the accuracy of the prediction results decreased significantly with de novo assembly. Among all of the combinations, BWA + SAMtools performed best with the highest true positive rate of 43.45%, which was slightly higher than BWA + GATK-HC.

            "text": "From the above results, we can see that even with strict control of variables, including identical data filtering and alignment software, the final results of different SNP mining software can still vary widely, and we speculate that the algorithmic framework of different software and sequencing depth play a key role in this. As mentioned above, HaplotypeCaller is the main SNP calling model in GATK. This framework is different from the previous GATK-Unified Genotyper (UGT), which requires significantly higher data quality. The most important feature of GATK is the introduction of the de novo algorithm, which means that it could independently assemble some partial regions to identify potential SNPs without the reference. There are also many detailed differences between GATK-HC and SAMtools. For example, GATK-HC may discard all reads with low mapping quality, while SAMtools tends to utilize all reads by default and limit the base quality by alignment. In addition, SAMtools uses manually tuned filters, while GATK-HC can learn filters from the data, which can lead to large differences between the two. On the other hand, sequencing depth also has a significant impact on data quality and prediction accuracy. Although the sequencing depth reached 10x in the simulated poplar data, previous results have shown that further increasing the sequencing depth still holds promise for further improving the accuracy of data prediction [10], and this conclusion was confirmed by comparing the results of our two data sets. Hence, based on our practical experience, the following suggestions have been made for SNP calling researchers. The reads that map to multiple positions can easily distinguish SNPs, especially at low coverage levels. To reduce these errors, multi-mapped reads should be removed in advance after the initial alignment. According to the SAM format, reads with MAPQ < 0, containing the label XA: Z or AS: i < XS: i could be considered as multi-mapped. On the other hand, in the SAM file, the SA: Z label or two lines of mapping results from a single read usually represent a read that has been split into two parts and mapped to two positions on the reference, rather than a multi-mapping. This is usually due to genome structure and does not affect SNP calling. Therefore, these reads can be retained. If the reference genome is available in a chromosome-assembled version, then these reads mapped to the same chromosome are recommended. Duplicate reads are clones of single reads caused by external factors and significantly affect the reliability of SNPs. The use of picard-tools or the rmdup command may help to remove them. The -Q parameter in the mpileup command could be set to 20 or higher. This parameter is the base quality threshold, and a higher value increases the confidence in the results of the call. In addition, DPR labels can be added using the -t parameter. These values represent the number of reads that support mapping to different bases at their respective positions, which can benefit downstream filtering. Furthermore, initial call results could be filtered to retrieve higher quality SNPs based on depth and quality values. For heterozygous genotypes, the same threshold can be set using DPR labels for the depth of all variable bases to obtain high-quality heterozygous sites."

            "text": "SNP mining based on short read length sequencing is still the dominant strategy, and the choice of different combinations of analysis software can make a big difference in the final results. According to our results, GATK-HC tends to be more robust, although more potential results could be found in the G. biloba data set with SAMtools as the alignment tool. In conclusion, the selection of different SNP calling programs should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. If the researcher wants to mine as many potential SNPs as possible for downstream analysis with relatively low sequencing depth, or with an unsatisfactory reference genome, then BWA + SAMtools might be the preferred choice. On the other hand, BWA + GATK-HC tends to be more robust and sophisticated when coupled with adequate sequencing depth.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life13051069/s1, File S1: Information of primers for amplification.
