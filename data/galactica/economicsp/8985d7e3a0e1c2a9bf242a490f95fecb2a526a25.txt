 1 conclusion This work promotes the theoretical boundary regarding optimality and stability for one-sided matching with initial endowments over social networks. We design the Connected Trading Cycles that satisfies IC, IR, stable-cc, and optimal-c. Furthermore, we propose the first IC characterization in the network setting to complete the theoretical framework. There are still open questions worth investigating in this field.
