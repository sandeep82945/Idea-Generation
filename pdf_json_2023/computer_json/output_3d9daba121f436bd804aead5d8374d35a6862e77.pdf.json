    "abstractText": "We present a number of puzzles arising for the interpretation of modified numerals. Following B\u00fcring and others we assume that the main difference between comparative and superlativemodifiers is that only the latter convey disjunctivemeanings.We further argue that the inference patterns triggered by disjunction and superlative modifiers are hard to capture in existing semantic and pragmatic analyses of these phenomena (neoGricean or grammatical alike), and we propose a novel account of these inferences in the framework of bilateral state-based modal logic defining a first order extension of Aloni (Semant Pragmat 15:5-EA, 2022. https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.15.5)\u2019s BSML.",

            "text": "Modified numerals are constructions where a numeral n combines with a modifier to form more complex expressions like less than 18, at least 5, exactly 7 or between 10 and 15. There are many such constructions but in this paper we will focus on the pairs of expressions { at least / at most } n and {more than / fewer than } n. Following Hackl (2001), Nouwen (2010b) we call expressions in the former pair superlative quantifiers and the expressions in the latter pair comparative quantifiers.1\nOn a naive view one would perhaps expect the following expressions to be interchangeable.\n1 Other examples of modified numerals are differential quantifiers, disjunctive quantifiers, locative quantifiers, directional quantifiers (see Nouwen, 2010a; 2010b).\nThe authors wish to thank Aleksi Anttila, the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.\nB Peter van Ormondt P.vanOrmondt@uva.nl\nMaria Aloni M.D.Aloni@uva.nl\n1 Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n(1) a. At least n A are B \u21d0\u21d2 More than n \u2212 1 A are B. b. At most n A are B \u21d0\u21d2 Fewer than n \u2212 1 A are B.\nAt least sinceGeurts et al. (2007) it is clear that superlative and comparative quantifiers are in fact quite distinct. One of the observed differences is that superlative quantifiers generate ignorance effects, while comparative quantifiers do not (Nouwen, 2010b).2\n(2) a. At least/at most n \u03d5 Speaker does not know how many \u03d5 b. More/fewer than n \u03d5 Speaker does not know how many \u03d5\nAs an illustration consider the contrast between the following two sentences fromBlok (2019):\n(3) a. ? I have at least three children. b. I have more than two children.\nExample (3-a) is odd because it gives rise to the unlikely implication that the speaker doesn\u2019t know how many children she has. Example (3-b) instead implicates no such thing.\nThe same point can be made with the downward entailing quantifiers. For instance in the following example from Nouwen (2010b):\n(4) a. ? A hexagon has at most 10 sides. b. A hexagon has fewer than 11 sides.\nIn the next section we will present three puzzles arising for the interpretation of modified numerals. Following B\u00fcring (2008), we will show that these puzzles can be solved if we assume that superlative quantifiers convey disjunctive meanings, while comparative ones do not. The crucial observation is that disjunctions and superlative modifiers generate the same inferences. B\u00fcring proposed to derive these inferences as Gricean conversational implicatures (Grice, 1975, 1989). Neo-Gricean (Sauerland, 2004) as well as grammatical accounts of implicatures (Chierchia, 2004; Fox, 2007; Chierchia et al., 2012), however, have difficulties in accounting for the whole range of inference patterns (Kennedy, 2015; Schwarz, 2013, 2016; Crnic\u030c et al., 2015). We will instead propose an account using the logic of pragmatic enrichment presented in Aloni (2022). The main difference with traditional grammatical or neo-Gricean approaches is that onAloni\u2019s view such pragmatic inferences neither follow from some grammatical operation nor are the result of (complex) reasoning based on alternative expressions speakersmight have used, but rather are a direct consequence of something else speakers do in conversation: when interpreting a sentence they create pictures of theworld and by doing so they favour vivid and concrete representations systematically neglecting empty configurations. Let us refer to this as the neglect zero assumption. Aloni (2022) showed that free choice (Kamp, 1974; Zimmermann, 2000) and related inferences directly follow from neglect zero. Her analysis is implemented in a bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML) modelling assertion and rejection conditions rather\n2 Westera & Brasoveanu (2014) challenged this generalisation. On their view, both superlative and comparative modifiers can generate ignorance inferences and whether they do depends on the question under discussion (QUD). Cremers et al. (2019) however experimentally attested that precise knowledge negatively affects the acceptability of superlative modifiers more than the acceptability of comparative ones across all QUD types.\nthan truth. In this paper we will present a first order version of BSML, a quantified bilateral state-based modal logic (QBSML), and apply it to explain modified numerals and the puzzles their interpretation gives rise to."

Bare numerals generate exact quantity inferences, superlative modifiers ignorance inferences, comparative modifiers neither of the two3:\n(5) The band has three players exactly three (6) The band has at least three players ignorance (7) The band has more than two players neither The first challenge for semantic theory is to explain why these different effects are generated given that the determiners \u201cn\u201d, \u201cmore than (n \u2212 1)\u201d and \u201cat least n\u201d are assumed to have the same denotation in standard generalised quantifier theory (Barwise & Cooper, 1981):\n(8) n / at least n / more than (n \u2212 1) \u2192 \u03bbP\u03bbQ. |P \u2229 Q| \u2265 n Why do only bare numerals express an exact meaning? And why do superlative modifiers imply ignorance about exact quantity while comparative modifiers do not, given that both appear equally uninformative about the intended number?\nA standard answer to the first question (Krifka, 1987; Schwarz, 2013; Kennedy, 2015) assumes that bare numerals express exact meanings as part of their conventional meaning. This is the so called two-sided analysis of numerals, whichwewill also adopt (even though nothing in what follows hinges on this choice):\n(9) n \u2192 \u03bbP\u03bbQ. |P \u2229 Q| = n A crucial observation towards an answer to the second question is that superlative numerals are not the only constructions that give rise to ignorance effects. The same is the case with plain disjunctions (Grice, 1989; Gazdar, 1976).\n(10) Klaus married Paul or John. speaker doesn\u2019t know who (11) Klaus has three or four children. speaker doesn\u2019t know how many Also in the case of disjunction this ignorance effect is strong. In the introduction we observed the oddity of the following sentences:\n3 Cummins et al. (2012) observed that comparative quantifiers may receive enriched interpretation when they combine with \u201cround\" numerals as in (i):\n(i) More than 90 people got married today. No more than 100 people got married today.\nWe will not consider these inferences here.\n(3-a) ? I have at least three children. (3-b) ? A hexagon has at most 10 sides.\nSimilarly, the following are odd because they suggest that the speaker doesn\u2019t know who they are married to or how many children they have:\n(12) ? I married Paul or John. (13) ? I have three or four children.\nBased on these observations, we follow B\u00fcring (2008) and propose that the main difference between superlative and comparative modifiers is that only the former convey inherently disjunctive meanings:\n(14) at least n \u2192 \u03bbP\u03bbQ.|P \u2229 Q| > n \u2228 |P \u2229 Q| = n (\u2261 \u03bbP\u03bbQ.|P \u2229 Q| \u2265 n) (15) more than n \u2192 \u03bbP\u03bbQ.|P \u2229 Q| > n (16) at most n \u2192 \u03bbP\u03bbQ.|P \u2229 Q| < n \u2228 |P \u2229 Q| = n (\u2261 \u03bbP\u03bbQ.|P \u2229 Q| \u2264 n) (17) less than n \u2192 \u03bbP\u03bbQ.|P \u2229 Q| < n What we need now is to derive the following ignorance inferences for superlativemodifiers and disjunctions, while no such inference should be derived for the comparative modifier cases.\n(18) Klaus married with Paul or John (according to the speaker) it is possible that Klaus married with Paul and it is possible that Klaus married with John. (19) The band has at least/at most three players (according to the speaker) it is possible that the band has exactly three player and it is possible that the band has more/less than three players.\nB\u00fcring proposed to derive these inferences as conversational implicatures. The following section presents a strong argument in favour of such a pragmatic account. As we will see in later sections, however, neo-Gricean (Sauerland, 2004) as well as grammatical accounts of implicatures (Chierchia, 2004; Fox, 2007; Chierchia et al., 2012) have difficulties in scaling up to account for the whole range of facts."

            "heading": "2.2 Obviation",
            "text": "It has been observed by Nouwen (2010b) and Blok (2019) that the ignorance readings we saw in the previous section can be obviated once superlative modifiers appear in the scope of certain operators. In particular, if they appear in the scope of universal quantifiers and modals. Consider first the case of the universal quantifier:\n(20) Everyone read at least three books. ignorance On its most prominent reading, (20) does not imply any ignorance. The example is felicitous in a context where the speaker has full knowledge of the situation and simply conveys that no individual read less than three books.\nConsider now the following modal case, which as B\u00fcring (2008) observed is ambiguous:\n(21) Paprika is required to read at least three books.\na. Authoritative reading: It has to be the case that P reads three or more books. ignorance b. Epistemic reading: Three or more is such that P has to read that many books. ignorance\nThe most prevalent reading is one compatible with a situation where the speaker has full knowledge. B\u00fcring called it the authoritative reading. On this reading, Paprika is not allowed to read less than 3 books, but may read more. In such cases the speaker knows precisely what is and what is not allowed. No ignorance inference is generated.\nOn the less obvious epistemic reading, which B\u00fcring called speaker-insecurity reading, the speaker knows that there is some lower bound to howmany books Paprika should read and that this lower bound is three or higher, but she does not know which of the two: it might be three or higher than three.\nAs an illustration of the authoritative reading, B\u00fcring proposes (22), encountered on a computer screen while creating a new account:\n(22) The password must be at least five characters long.\nB\u00fcring observes: \u201cIf it turns out that the password must in fact be seven (or more) characters long, we would object to [the sentence]\u201d.\nAs an illustration of the epistemic reading B\u00fcring proposes:\n(23) To become a member of this club, you have to pay at least $200,000.\nB\u00fcring observes \u201cIf it turns out that no donation of less than $250,000 gets you into the club\u2019s rank and file, what I said wasn\u2019t false, nor infelicitous. I merely claimed that the minimum contribution was 200K, or more\u201d.\nNotice that again similar effects obtain with disjunction:\n(24) a. Paprika read two or three books ignorance b. \u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8 \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 (25) a. Everyone read two or three books ignorance [obviation] b. \u2200x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2200x( \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) (26) Paprika is required to read two or three books.\na. authoritative ignorance [obviation] b. epistemic ignorance\nThe challenge here is to explain the emergence of the ignorance effect in the plain case and its obviation in these embedded cases. Semantic accounts of ignorance inferences (e.g., Geurts et al. 2007; Nouwen 2010b), that propose that superlative modifiers have an epistemic component as part of their lexical contribution, have problems in accounting for obviation, which instead is unproblematic for neo-Gricean pragmatic accounts (B\u00fcring, 2008; Schwarz, 2013;Kennedy, 2015). In pragmatic accounts, ignorance effects are treated as conversational implicatures, and therefore are expected to disappear in some embedded contexts. Pragmatic accounts however typically have difficulties in accounting for additional inferences obviation cases give rise to. These will be discussed in the following section."

            "text": "It has been observed that sentences with disjunction in the scope of a universal quantifier tend to give rise to distributive inferences that each of the disjuncts holds (Spector, 2006; Fox, 2007; Klinedinst, 2007).\n(27) Every woman in my family has two or three children. Some woman has two and some woman has three children.\nTo be more precise, this inference is only generated in contexts where the speaker is assumed to have full knowledge of the situation. In situations of partial information something weaker obtains:\n(28) Every woman in my family has two or three children. Some woman might have two and some woman might have three children.\nNotice again the similarity with the case of superlative quantifiers:\n(29) Every woman in my family has at least three children.\na. full knowledge Some woman has three and some woman has more than three children. b. partial information Some woman might have three and some woman might have more than three children.\nDisjunctions in the scope of a necessity modal give rise to similar distribution effects. We will call these -free choice inferences: (30) a. To pass this course you are required to give a presentation or write a short\npaper You are allowed to give a presentation and you are allowed to write a short paper b. (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 (NB: = (\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)) Similar inferences are generated for authoritative readings of modal sentences with superlative quantifiers:\n(31) a. To pass the course, you\u2019re required to read at least three books. (authoritative reading)\nb. You are allowed to read three books and you are allowed to read more. In neo-Gricean approaches, distribution and -free choice inferences can be easily derived via negations of universal alternatives:\n(32) \u2200x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) + \u00ac\u2200x\u03d5 + \u00ac\u2200x\u03c8 | \u2203x\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203x\u03c8 (33) (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) + \u00ac \u03d5 + \u00ac \u03c8 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 But as experimentally attested by Crnic\u030c et al. (2015), Ramotowska et al. (2022), distributive inferences may obtain in the absence of plain negated universal inferences.4 Consider the following sentence used in a situation where all brothers have been married to a woman, but one of the brothers married first a woman and then a man:\n4 Crnic\u030c et al. (2015) tested only the case of universal quantifier. Ramotowska et al. (2022) reached the same conclusion for the case of necessity modals either of the epistemic or the deontic kind.\n(34) Every brother of mine has been married to a woman or a man. somebrother has beenmarried to awoman and somebrother has beenmarried to a man (even in a situation where all brothers have been married to a woman)\n(34) \u2200x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2203x\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203x\u03c8 , even when \u00ac\u2200x\u03d5 Furthermore eventually we also want to account for the classical cases of -free choice inferences (Kamp, 1974; Zimmermann, 2000):\n(35) a. You may have coffee or tea you may have coffee and you may have tea b. (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8\nBut -free choice inferences are not easy to derive by standard Gricean reasoning:\n(36) (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) + \u00ac \u03d5 + \u00ac \u03c8 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 Hence, neo-Gricean approaches have problems with both distribution inferences and free choice effects. More in general, note that the different behaviour of \u2203 and in interaction with disjunction is surprising from a purely pragmatic (neo-Gricean) point of view:\n(37) a. \u2200x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2203x\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203x\u03c8 [distribution] b. \u2203x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2203x\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203x\u03c8 (38) a. (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 [ -free choice] b. (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 [ -free choice]\nFor a natural language example illustrating (37-b) consider the following which triggers no distribution effects but rather an ignorance inference:\n(39) a. Some woman in my family has two or three children. some woman has two and some woman has three some woman in my family might have two children and might have three children\nb. \u2203x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2203x\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203x\u03c8 \u2203x(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2203x( \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)\nBoth distribution and free choice inferences can be captured by grammatical accounts of implicatures (Chierchia et al., 2012; Fox, 2007), which derive them by the application of exh, a grammaticalised operation of exhaustification. However, grammatical accounts do not allow us to derive ignorance effects for plain disjunction (exh(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) unless we assume the presence of a covert epistemic modal operator (exh( (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8)) | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8). It\u2019s plausible to assume that also in the case of plain disjunction the modal inference \u03c6 and \u03c8 obtains in the absence of the negated universal inference \u00ac \u03c6 and \u00ac \u03c8 (the results of recent experiments (Degano et al., 2023), a follow-up of Ramotowska et al. (2022), are in support of this assumption). To derive these facts, the grammatical approach has to assume not only that all assertions involve the presence of a covert , but also that this covert operator induces alternatives, for which we lack an intuitive interpretation.\nAnother problem arising for grammatical approaches to implicatures is discussed in the following section."

Since exh is treated as a grammatical operator which can scopally interact with negation, there are more possible readings generated for example (41) and some of them might fail to be blocked by alternative forms involving simpler expressions."

            "text": "In the following sections we will present a logic-based account where ignorance and related inferences will follow as \u201creasonable inferences\u201d in the sense of Stalnaker (1975).7 We understand a reasonable inference not as a semantic relation but as a pragmatic one, which relates speech acts rather than propositions. To derive reasonable inference we employ a state-based modal logic modeling assertion and rejection conditions rather than truth.\nWhere classical modal logic interprets formulas with respect to a single possible world, state-based modal logic interprets formulas with respect to a state modelled as a set of possible worlds. In the propositional case, developed in Aloni (2022), this amounts to the following. Let M = \u3008W , R, V \u3009 be a Kripke model, where W is a non-empty set of worlds, R \u2286 W \u00d7 W a two-place relation over W and V a worlddependent valuation function assigning truth values to propositional variables of the language.\nClassical modal logic models truth in a possible world (an element of W ) while state-based modal logic models support in an information state (a subset of W ):\nM, w | \u03d5, where w \u2208 W (Classical)\nM, s | \u03d5, where s \u2286 W (State-based)\nAloni (2022) employs a bilateral version of state-based modal logic which defines both support (| ) and anti-support ( |) conditions meant to capture the assertability and rejectability of a sentence in an information state,8\n7 To be precise, while in spirit our approach is close to Stalnaker\u2019s, empirically we make quite different predictions for example because some of the pragmatic rules Stalnaker adopts for disjunction are different from ours. 8 Information states are then less determinate entities than possible worlds and are comparable to truthmakers (van Fraassen, 1969; Fine, 2017), possibilities (Lloyd Humberstone, 1981; Holliday, 2018) or situations (Barwise & Perry, 1983). The partial nature of an information state makes state-based systems particularly suitable for capturing phenomena at the semantics-pragmatics interface, including anaphora (Groenendijk &Stokhof, 1991; Groenendijk et al., 1996; Dekker, 2012), questions (Ciardelli &Roelofsen, 2011; Ciardelli et al., 2018), epistemic modals (Veltman, 1996).\nWe then have that\nIn our first-order extension of state-based modal logic, the elements of a state, the possibilities or indices as we will call them, are pairs of worlds and (partial) assignments.\nBefore we continue let\u2019s have a look at an example to get a better understanding of our intended models.\nExample 3.1 (An example of a pointed model M, s) Consider themodel depicted in Fig. 1.Worlds in this example (and the ones throughout this paper)will be designated by lettersw, v, u, etc. togetherwith a subscript indicating what is the case in that world. So wPa is the world w in which some object a has property P . The arrows indicate which worlds are R-related. In this model s consists of the following indices:\ns = {\u3008wPa, g[x/a]\u3009, \u3008wPaPb, g[x/a]\u3009, \u3008wPaPb, g[x/b]\u3009, \u3008wPb, g[x/b]\u3009},\nwhere g[x/d] means the assignment function g that maps variable x onto object d in some domain D.\nIn state-based systems to be supported in a state you normally must be true in all possibilities. It is then easy to see for instance thatM, s | Px because in each i \u2208 s the value of x in i is P . It is also clear that M, s | Pa because for instance a is not P in wPb and therefore Pa is not supported by all i \u2208 s. The same is the case for Pb: M, s | Pb.\nOf course, the relation R in the model does not have influence on the formulas we just evaluated and this will only become relevant when we will discuss modal formulas."

As a result, a pragmatically enriched disjunction [\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8]+ is supported by a state s iff there are two non-empty states t, t \u2032 such that t \u222a t \u2032 = s and t | \u03d5 and t \u2032 | \u03c8 .\nAs an example of how pragmatic enrichment will allow us to derive the ignorance effect, consider Fig. 2.\nThe model and state in Fig. 2a support [Pa \u2228 Pb]+ because the state can be split into two non-empty substates, the states t and t \u2032 represented in Fig. 2b, each supporting one of the disjuncts. The modalized conjuncts Pa and Pb then follow in part by requiring the relation to be state-based which we will explain in Sect. 4.1.1. Notice that in each of the two singleton states in 2b classical Pa \u2228 Pb is satisfied but its pragmatically enriched version [Pa \u2228 Pb]+ is not.\nIn combination with the right notion of modality, quantification and negation, the resulting system will predict all the inferences observed in previous sections."

Like Aloni\u2019s BSML, QBSML is a modal predicate logic with state-based semantics that defines conditions of assertion and rejection rather than conditions of truth.\nWe start by defining the language.\nDefinition 4.1 (Language) The language L of state-based first-order modal logic is built up from predicate constants Pn \u2208 P n , with n \u2208 N, individual constants c \u2208 C and variables x \u2208 V.\nt : := c | x \u03d5: := Pnt1 . . . tn | NE | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2228 \u03d5 | \u2203x\u03d5 | \u2200x\u03d5 | \u03d5\nDefinition 4.2 (Model) A model for L is a quadruple M = \u3008W , D, R, I \u3009, where W is set of worlds, D is a non-empty domain, R is an accessibility relation on W , I : W \u00d7 C \u222a P n \u2192 D \u222a \u2118(Dn) is an interpretation function which assigns entities to individual constants and sets of entities to predicate letters relativized to worlds w \u2208 W :\nI (w)(\u03b3 ) = { d \u2208 D if \u03b3 \u2208 C, Sn \u2286 Dn if \u03b3 \u2208 P n .\nContrary to classical modal predicate logic, formulas will be interpreted with respect to states, rather than a world. A state is a set of indices. An index i is a pair i = \u3008wi , gi \u3009 consisting of a world wi \u2208 W and a partial assignment function gi : V \u2192 D.9 We may think of an information state as encoding information about the value of variables restricted to worlds. We require for all indices i, j in a state s that gi has the same domain as g j : dom(gi ) = dom(g j ).\nGiven a model M, the set of information states is defined as\nSM := \u22c3 X\u2286V \u2118(W \u00d7 DX ).\nThis is a general definition including all subsets of V, but usually, when modelling a dialogue this will be a union of finite sets of V. We will use I X to denote the set of indices W \u00d7 DX for some X \u2286 V.\nThis paper models pragmatic effects that occur in discourse. We see discourse as starting out with an initial state where there is no information about the values of the variables, i.e., we have an empty assignment. See Fig. 3for an illustration of an initial information state s = {\u3008wPa Pb , \u2205\u3009, \u3008wPb , \u2205\u3009}.\nWhenwe do learn the value of a variable this information is added to the information state. In order to capture this idea we will define a number of operations on states. Let\u2019s first fix some terminology.\n9 See Heim (1982), Dekker (1993).\nLet SM be the set of information states of somemodelM. We say a state s is initial if its domain X is empty. We say a state is of minimal information if it is initial and it contains all possible worlds. A state is of maximal information if it is a singleton set.\nNext we use the following definitions for operations on states (building on Dekker 1993; Aloni 2001).\nDefinition 4.3 g[x/d] := (g \\ {\u3008x, g(x)\u3009}) \u222a {\u3008x, d\u3009}\nIn the course of a discourse noun phrases are associated with variables. g[x/d] adds x and sets its value to d, if x /\u2208 dom(g), or, otherwise, resets the value of x to d. We write i[x/d] when gi is in i and d is assigned to x . Definition 4.4 i[x/d] := \u3008wi , gi [x/d]\u3009. The individual x-extension of s, s[x/d], is the state resulting from s by replacing the assignment gi in each index i \u2208 s by gi [x/d]. Definition 4.5 (Individual x-extension of s)\ns[x/d] := {i[x/d] | i \u2208 s}, for some d \u2208 D.\nSee Fig. 4 for an example where individual a is assigned to x extending the initial state s = {\u3008wPa Pb , \u2205\u3009, \u3008wPb , \u2205\u3009}.\nThe universal x-extension of s, s[x], is the state which results by extending the state s with the assignment g[x/d] for all d \u2208 D. See Fig. 5 for an example. Definition 4.6 (Universal x-extension of s)\ns[x] := {i[x/d] | i \u2208 s & d \u2208 D}.\nA functional x-extension of s is any state t where for each index i \u2208 s there is at least one index j \u2208 t such that j = i[x/d] for some d \u2208 D.\nFig. 6 A functional x-extension of s\nFig. 7 Not a functional x-extension of s\nDefinition 4.7 (Functional x-extension of s)\ns[x/h] := {i[x/d] | i \u2208 s & d \u2208 h(i)}, some function h : s \u2192 \u2118(D) \\ \u2205.\nIndividual extensions and universal extensions are examples of functional extensions. But also the state depicted in Fig. 6 is a functional extension of the state s = {\u3008wPa Pb , \u2205\u3009, \u3008wPb , \u2205\u3009}with h mapping \u3008wPa Pb , \u2205\u3009 to {a} and \u3008wPb , \u2205\u3009 to {a, b}.\nHowever, the state represented in Fig. 7is not a functional extension of s because it does not contain any extension of index \u3008wPa Pb , \u2205\u3009, such index does not \u201csurvive\u201d in it.

Then \u03d5 | epi \u03c8 iff for all epistemicM, s, such that (i) the signature of M contains all the non-logical symbols of \u03d5 and \u03c8 and (ii) the domain of s contains x : ifM, s | epi \u03d5, then M, s | epi \u03c8 .\nIt is easy to show that the current semantics validates a number of classical laws (\u03d5 \u2261 \u03c8 is short for \u03d5 | \u03c8 and \u03c8 | \u03d5):\nFact 1 (Classical QBSML validities)\n\u03d5 \u2261 \u00ac\u00ac\u03d5 (Double Negation Elimination) \u00ac(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8 (De Morgan Laws) \u00ac(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 \u2228 \u00ac\u03c8 \u00ac \u03d5 \u2261 \u00ac \u03d5 (Duality / ) \u00ac \u03d5 \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 \u00ac\u2200x\u03d5 \u2261 \u2203x\u00ac\u03d5 (Duality \u2200/\u2203) \u00ac\u2203x\u03d5 \u2261 \u2200x\u00ac\u03d5\nHowever, not all classical validities are validated. For example, addition fails whenever NE occurs in one of the disjuncts: \u03d5 | \u03d5\u2228(\u03c8 \u2227NE). In fact, the non-emptiness atom is the only source of non-classical behaviour.11 As stated in Proposition 4.1, the NE-free fragment of QBSML can be reduced to classical quantified modal logic.\nProposition 4.1 Let \u03d5( x) be aNE-free formula ofQBSML with free variables in x. And let s be a state over M whose domain contains x. Then\nM, s | \u03d5( x) iffM, w | g \u03d5( x), for all \u3008w, g\u3009 \u2208 s\n(where | on the left is the state-based support relation, and | on the right is the truth relation from classical quantified modal logic).\nThis result was proved for the propositional BSML by Antilla (2021, Propositions 2.2.2, 2.2.8 and 2.2.16). In order to show that it also holds for QBSML it is enough to show that, if \u03d5 is NE-free, \u2200x\u03d5, and \u2203x\u03d5 are flat, i.e., have the downward closure property, the union closure property and the empty state property. Note that given the duality of \u2203x and \u2200x all formulas of QBSML can be given in negation normal form, as was the case in BSML (Anttila 2021, Propositions 2.2.6).\nFact 2 Let \u2200x\u03d5, \u2203x\u03d5 be formulas of QBSML such that they do not contain an occurrence ofNE. Then \u2200x\u03d5 and \u2203x\u03d5 have the downward closure property, the union closure property and the empty state property.\nProof We rely on the induction hypothesis given by Antilla (2021, Proposition 2.2.8).\n\u2200x\u03d5. Downward closure property: If \u2200x\u03d5 does not contain NE we may assume by the induction hypothesis that \u03d5 is downward closed. Assume that M, s | \u2200x\u03d5 and that t \u2286 s. Observe that t \u2286 s \u21d0\u21d2 t[x] \u2286 s[x]. By M, s | \u2200x\u03d5 we have thatM, s[x] | \u03d5. By the induction hypothesis, we have thatM, t[x] | \u03d5, hence M, t | \u2200x\u03d5. Union closure property: If \u2200x\u03d5 does not contain NE then by the induction hypothesis, \u03d5 has the union closure property. Assume that for some modelM and some non-empty set of states S on M we have M, s | \u2200x\u03d5, for all s \u2208 S. This means that M, s[x] | \u03d5, for all s \u2208 S. By the induction hypothesis, we have\n11 Although logical consequence in NE-free fragment is classical (e.g., it validates LEM), the logic does not satisfy bivalence since we can have states which neither support a formula neither its negation. So in a sense also the NE-free fragment displays non-classically behaviour.\nthat the union of the universal extensions of s \u2208 S, \u22c3s\u2208S{S[x]}, supports \u03d5.\u22c3 s\u2208S{S[x]} = \u22c3 S[x], soM,\u22c3 S[x] | \u03d5. We conclude M,\u22c3 S | \u2200x\u03d5. Empty state property: If \u2200x\u03d5 does not containNE, then by the induction hypothesis \u03d5 has the empty state property. LetM be some modelM then by the empty state property: M, \u2205 | \u03d5. Clearly, \u2205[x] = \u2205, hence M, \u2205 | \u2200x\u03d5. \u2203x\u03d5. Downward closure property: If \u2203x\u03d5 does not contain NE we may assume by the induction hypothesis that \u03d5 is downward closed. Assume thatM, s | \u2203x\u03d5. By M, s | \u2203x\u03d5 we have thatM, s[x/h] | \u03d5, for some h : s \u2192 \u2118(D)\\\u2205. Observe that t \u2286 s \u21d2 t[x/h|t ] \u2286 s[x/h]. By the induction hypothesis: M, t[x/h|t ] | \u03d5. HenceM, t | \u2203x\u03d5. As t was arbitrary we conclude that \u2203x\u03d5 is downward closed. Union closure property: If \u2203x\u03d5 does not contain NE, then by the induction hypothesis, \u03d5 has the union closure property. Assume that for some modelM and some non-empty set of states S on M we have M, s | \u2203x\u03d5, for all s \u2208 S. This means that for all s \u2208 S:M, s[x/hs] | \u03d5, for some hs : s \u2192 \u2118(D)\\\u2205. By the induction hypothesis we have that the union of the functional extensions of s \u2208 S, supports\u03d5: M,\u22c3s\u2208S s[x/hs] | \u03d5. It is easy to see that \u22c3s\u2208S s[x/hs] is itself a x-functional extension of \u22c3 S. We conclude M,\u22c3 S | \u2203x\u03d5. Empty state property: If \u2203x\u03d5 does not contain NEwemay assume by the induction hypothesis that \u03d5 has the empty state property:M, \u2205 | \u03d5. Clearly, \u2205[x/h] = \u2205, for any h. Hence M, \u2205 | \u2203x\u03d5."

Following B\u00fcring and others we have assumed that the main difference between comparative and superlativemodifiers is that only the latter convey disjunctive\nmeanings. We further argued that the inference patterns triggered by disjunction and superlative modifiers are hard to capture in existing semantic and pragmatic analyses of these phenomena (neo-Gricean or grammatical alike), and we have proposed a novel account of these inferences in the framework of bilateral state-based modal logic defining a first order extension of Aloni\u2019s BSML. In this framework, next to literal meanings (the NE-free fragment of the language, ruled by classical logic), also pragmatic factors (NE) are modelled and the additional inferences that arise from their interaction (ignorance, distribution, free choice). The intruding pragmatic factor represented byNE, connects to a tendency of language users to neglect the empty state, an abstract element comparable to the zero in mathematics. In future work we would like to seek corroboration by conducting experiments and test our predictions. This would perhaps also shed more light on the tendency to neglect the empty state and the cognitive plausibility of the framework.\nOpenAccess This article is licensedunder aCreativeCommonsAttribution 4.0 InternationalLicense,which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
