    "abstractText": "Shale rock swelling poses a significant challenge during drilling a well, leading to issues related to wellbore instability. Water-based mud with specific shale inhibitors is preferred over oil-based drilling mud due to its lower environmental impact. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as potential shale inhibitors due to their adjustable properties and strong electrostatic attraction. However, research has shown that the most commonly used class of ILs (imidazolium) in drilling mud are toxic, non-biodegradable, and expensive. Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), the fourth generation of ionic liquids, have been proposed as a cheaper and non-toxic alternative to ILs. However, ammonium salt-based DESs are not truly environmentally friendly. This research explores the utilization of Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NADES) based on Epsom salt (a naturally occurring salt) and glycerine as a drilling fluid additive. The drilling mud is prepared according to API 13B-1 standards. Various concentrations of NADES-based mud are tested for yield point, plastic viscosity, and filtration properties for both aged and non-aged samples. The linear swell meter is used to determine the percentage swelling of the NADES-based mud, and the results are compared with the swelling caused by KCland EMIM-Clbased mud. FTIR analysis is conducted to understand the interaction between NADES and clay, while surface tension, d-spacing (XRD), and zeta potential are measured to comprehend the mechanism of swelling inhibition by NADES. The findings reveal that NADES improves the yield point and plastic viscosity of the mud, resulting in a 26% reduction in mudcake thickness and a 30.1% decrease in filtrate volume at a concentration of 1%. NADES achieves a significant 49.14% inhibition of swelling at the optimal concentration of 1%, attributed to its ability to modify surface activity, zeta potential of clay surfaces, and d-spacing of clay layers. Consequently, NADES emerges as a non-toxic, cost-effective, and efficient shale inhibitor that can replace ILs and DESs.",

            "text": "Shale behaves as both a source rock and reservoir rock; i.e., it is able to generate hydrocarbons, and it can offer an environment for trapping these hydrocarbons in a porous medium [1]. Shale contains clay minerals which causes the shale formation to become sensitive towards hydration [2]. There are several types of clay minerals present in the shale formation, e.g., smectite. The smectite is composed of montmorillonite which has tendency to swell in water while kaolinite and illite minerals tend to disperse in water [3,4]. Smectite and smectite/illite mixed layer minerals possess larger specific surface area and high imbibing abilities. The shale containing these two minerals has a strong ability to permeate which will lead to shale swelling causing wellbore instability [5]. Wellbore instability results in non-productive time (NPT), mainly during drilling the shale formations, and results in various problems. These problems are not limited to a stuck pipe, bit balling, lost circulation, caving, and a tight hole, which requires additional time and cost for maintenance [6]. Oil-based drilling fluid (OBDF) is usually preferred to drill a shale-bearing formation because water-based drilling mud (WBDF) will result in shale swelling and ultimately wellbore instability [7,8]. But a higher price and environmental risks are associated with\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155784 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 2 of 14\nthe usage of OBDF which constrains its application. Synthetic-based drilling fluid (SBDF) is also recommended for drilling shale formation, but its ineptness at a higher temperature does not make it an appropriate candidate to be used [9]. WBDF is relatively safe, does not cause grave environmental perils, and has minimal preparation cost which makes it a potential candidate to replace OBDF and incompatible SBDF [10]. Different additives such as shale inhibitors are added into the WBDF to enhance its shale inhibition capability. Shale has a negatively charged clay layer, and these inhibitors bond with that clay layer and neutralize the charge thus stabilizing it against hydration. Traditional inhibitors in water-based drilling fluids include KCl, limes, silicates, polymers, etc., but they are effective to a certain limit [11]. However, apart from a lack of efficiency, a huge concentration of K+ (in KCl inhibitor) is not ecologically friendly. Moreover, silicates are highly pH-dependent which also limits their applications [12,13]. Many research groups started exploiting the application of ionic liquids as drilling fluid additives and found out that ionic liquids have successfully improved mud rheology and inhibited shale swelling and hydrate formation [14]. However, recent research has shown that ionic liquid comprising imidazolium-based cations is usually toxic [15\u201317]. Moreover, generally, ionic liquids are expensive, non-biodegradable, and not easy to prepare. This is when the quest to find a cheaper and non-toxic but equally effective alternative to ionic liquids started. This search of researchers concluded with the introduction of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) in many applied fields. A eutectic system is mainly a homogeneous mixture of ingredients that solidifies or fuses at a single temperature that is smaller than the melting point of any of the constituents. This (melting) temperature is regarded as the eutectic temperature. It is the smallest possible melting temperature of all the mixing ratios for the involved constituents. DESs are simply the mixture of Hydrogen Bond Donor (HBDs) and Hydrogen Bond Acceptor (HBAs) which are mixed at a particular composition (molar ratios) at a particular temperature to obtain a eutectic mixture [18]. Theoretically, it has been generally assumed that the noteworthy decline in melting of a eutectic mixture as compared to that of the pure materials\u2019 is due to the charge delocalization from an HBA to the HBD which is aided by a hydrogen bond (H-bond) formation [19]. Furthermore, the enhanced strength of the hydrogen bonds developed at a eutectic point must be balanced by a reduction in strength of several other cohesive force of interactions. Also, the other crucial factors such as the lattice energies of the HBA and HBD, the changes in entropy upon DES formation, and the way the anion and HBD interact also play a critical role in melting point depression of DES [20] Ofei et al. (2017) added 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM-Cl) into waterbased drilling mud which in turn reduced mudcake thickness up to 50% and decreased YP/PV at all considered temperatures [21]. Han Jia (2019) for the very first time utilized propoanoic acid ChCl (1:1), 3-phenyl propanoic acid ChCl (1:2), and 3-mercapto propanoic acid + Itaconic acid + ChCl (1:1:2)-based DES and achieved 68%, 58%, and 58% bentonite swelling inhibition, respectively [22]. Huang et al. (2020) utilized ionic liquids, i.e., 1-hexyl3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1,2-bis(3-hexylimidazolium1-yl) ethane bromide, using Na-Bt pellets and achieved 86.43% and 94.17% reduction in shale swelling, respectively [23]. Yang et al. (2017) utilized 1- Vinyl-3- ethylimidazolium bromide and achieved 31.62% reduction in shale swelling with a 40.60% shale recovery rate [24]. Luo et al. (2017) used 1- octyl-3- methylimidazolium tetraflouroboreate which resulted in an 80% reduction in shale swelling [25]. M.H. Rasool (2021) utilized Glycerine: Potassium Carbonate DES 2:1 for a free style experiment using swelling shale samples and obtained 87% swelling inhibition [26]. Jingua Ma (2020) used Urea: ChCl and achieved 67% shale swelling inhibition [7]. Though DESs are considered to be the greenest alternative of ionic liquids, in reality, DESs too are composed of some toxic components such as hydrogen bond acceptors, e.g., ammonium-based salts, etc. [27]. This puts a big question mark on the green nature of DES. This is when the natural derivate of Deep Eutectic Solvents called Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADESs), comprising naturally occurring components, came into the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 3 of 14\npicture [28,29]. NADESs, by definition, are also DESs, but their components are naturally occurring substances and salts such as potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), Epsom salt (MgSO4\u00b77H2O), etc. [30]. There are millions of combination of DES and NADES available; thus, this area needs a lot of consideration to exploit as many combinations as possible to check its efficacy and utilization in various applied fields [31\u201334]. NADESs are typically composed of combinations of natural compounds such as organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and polyols, which can be sourced from various agricultural and forestry by-products. Unlike traditional solvents that often rely on petroleum-based chemicals, the use of naturally occurring products significantly reduces the production costs associated with NADESs. Furthermore, the abundance and wide availability of these natural compounds contribute to their cost competitiveness. The raw materials for NADESs can often be obtained at lower costs compared to synthetic solvents, which require complex manufacturing processes and specialized chemicals. Various researchers have successfully prepared novel combination of NADESs/DESs which have been proven to be effective in various applied fields [35]. In 2013, Naser et al. prepared a novel potassium carbonate-based DES and found its thermophysical properties [36]. This newly prepared DES was then later utilized by many research groups in applied fields, e.g., as a hydrate inhibitor, as a drilling fluid additive, for delignification and nano-fibrillation, etc. [18,26,37]. Jordy Kim et al. prepared ascorbic acid-based NADES and determined its antioxidant properties for various applications [38]. Krister et al. concocted a citric acid-based NADES and found out that it can be successfully employed as a potential excipient in collagen-based products [39]. Liu Y. et al. in their detailed review work summarized the applications of NADESs as extraction and chromatographic media [40]. Misan et al. studied the successful applications of NADESs in the agri-food sector [41]. Rasool et al. (2023) tested the successful applications of ascorbic acid-based NADES as a shale swelling inhibitor [42]. This research will utilize Epsom salt as a hydrogen bond acceptor and glycerine as a hydrogen bond donor, selected based upon M.H. screening criteria [43] for selection of DESs for shale inhibition. M.H screening criteria address two factors for the selection of DESs for shale swelling inhibition, (i) the value of total hydrogen bond count and (ii) polarity of functional group. NADESs will be prepared in-house and will then be utilized as a drilling fluid additive to find drilling fluid properties and swelling inhibition traits. FTIR, XRD, and Zeta Potential will be measured to understand the NADES\u2013clay interaction and swelling inhibition mechanism of the clay."

The final results of experimentation reveal that the eutectic mixture has been obtained at 50 \u25e6C when HBA and HBD are mixed with molar ratios of 1:2. The eutectic mixture will only be achieved at eutectic temperature and eutectic mole ratios. If the stirring up is taking place at hypoeutectic and hypereutectic conditions, either the mixture will turn out cloudy, or the precipitation will form. At 1:2, 50 \u25e6C, a transparent and homogenous liquid is obtained with no precipitation, turbidity, and cloudiness, which confirms that this is a eutectic point and the rest of the compositions were either hypoeutectic or hypereutectic solvents. This experimentation also shows that the preparation of an NADES is mainly controlled by three factors: (i) molar ratio, (ii) temperature, and (iii) mixing speed. Among these three factors, it has been observed that molar ratio is the most significant factor while mixing speed is the least controlling factor in the preparation of DESs or NADESs. The detailed preparation and thermophysical and chemical characterization of this Epsom salt-based NADES can be studied in our previous work [44].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 4 of 14"

            "text": "The yield point is described as the force of attraction present between colloidal particles of the drilling mud while plastic viscosity is the resistive force caused by solid particles and the liquid in the drilling mud. The cutting carrying capability of the mud can be best described by YP/PV which is an important indicator of mud rheology. The rise in YP/PV values usually levels the mud flow profile which in turn improves the cutting carrying ability of the mud as shown in Figure 1. It is also worth noting that very high values of YP/PV will result in a surge in annular frictional pressure losses, consequently increasing the equivalent circulation density (ECD), which may result into fracturing. A literature survey has shown that YP/PV values ranging between 0.75 and 1 lbm/100 ft2/cp will result in a good cutting transportation without causing any unwarranted ECD. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the addition of NADES in the mud improves the cutting carrying ability of the mud by reducing the YP/PV value nearer to the optimum range. This is because NADESs, just like DESs and ionic liquids, modify the structure of clay platelets which modifies the mud rheology. For aged samples at high temperatures, it can be seen in Figure 1 that YP/PV nearly lies in the optimal range.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0

YP/PV of ADES-based ud.\nThe diminution in yield point and plastic viscosity ratio of the drilling mud with the increase in temperature is the combined effect of various phenomena occurring concurrently such as variations in the electrical double-layer thickness surrounding the clay particles, waning in the degree of hydration, augmented thermal energy of the clay particles, and decline in the viscosity of the colloidal medium along with the increase in clay particles\u2019 dispersion. At high temperature, bentonite suffers severe dehydration, mechanical shearing, and degradation. The clay platelets, at high temperatures, after enduring degradation, come closer to each other, and attractive forces are created between them giving the clay platelets a face-to-edge orientation. The increase in temperature will then lead to a state of agglomeration and flocculation that results in lower rheological properties as seen in Figure 1."

            "heading": "2.3. Gel Strength",
            "text": "Gel strength helps to assess the mud\u2019s ability to retain suspended cuttings under static conditions. Gel strength is typically measured at three different time intervals: 10 s, 10 min, and 30 min. While both gel strength and yield point are measured in the same units (lb/100 ft2), it is important to note that yield point is a dynamic property, whereas gel strength can be considered a static property of the drilling mud. To rationalize results of gel\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 5 of 14\nstrength, the increase in gel strength at a greater waiting time (10 min) is compared with the previous reading at 10 s. A larger difference between readings indicates a higher pump pressure required to disrupt the gel and initiate circulation. In some cases, the mud may solidify, necessitating the addition of different chemicals to dilute it. Analyzing Figure 2, it becomes evident that the incorporation of NADESs into the drilling mud did not lead to a significant increase gel strength. This observation remains consistent for both fresh and aged samples. The presence of NADESs in the samples hindered the increment in gel strength to a notable extent. Notably, the samples containing 1% NADESs exhibited the most substantial decline in the increment of gel strength. It is important to consider these results when evaluating the potential impact of NADESs and DESs on the performance and behavior of the drilling mud. The observation of a good flat profile for gel strength results in the presence of NADESs that can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, NADESs, being composed of naturally occurring compounds, often exhibit good compatibility and interaction with the components of the drilling mud. This compatibility can contribute to the formation of a stable gel network within the mud, leading to a consistent and flat gel strength profile. Additionally, NADESs may act as effective dispersants or stabilizers in the drilling mud system. By reducing the aggregation or flocculation of particles, NADESs can help maintain a uniform distribution of solids, preventing the formation of localized regions with higher or lower gel strength values.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.3.\u00a0Gel\u00a0Strength\u00a0 Gel\u00a0 strength\u00a0helps\u00a0

As compared to the base s mple (no NADES), the addit on of NADESs improved the filtration p operties of th s by reducing t e mu cake thickness and filtrat volume as evident in Figures 3 and 4. If the mud ake b comes very thick, it will lead o certain problems such as the drill pipe sticking, which causes NPT and wellbore failure. In such scenarios, thinners are added in the drilling mud to reduce the thickness of the mudcake. The NADESs in the mud mimicked the role of a thinner as it decreased the mudcake and filtrate volume. Moreover, this attribute of the NADES may be associated with its ability to bond with clay platelets and change its wettability which in turn will modify the filtration properties of the mud. One percent NADES-based mud with no aging showed the minimum decline of 26% and 30.4% in mudcake thickness and filtrate volume as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The elevated aging temperature caused the mud to flocculate and aggregate which leads to thicker mudcake and higher filtrate loss which is also evident from Figures 3 and 4. It is interesting to note that NADES-based aged mud samples still perform\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 6 of 14\nbetter in terms of filtration properties as compared to the aged base sample while giving optimum results at 1% NADES concentration. The NADES can interact with solid particles present in drilling mud, encapsulating them and aiding in the formation of a filter cake on the wellbore. At lower concentrations, there might not be enough NADESs to effectively encapsulate and hold the solids together, resulting in poor filter cake development and reduced filtration efficiency. Conversely, at higher concentrations, an excessive amount of NADESs might lead to the formation of a dense and impermeable filter cake that hinders fluid flow. The optimum concentration in Figure 3 indicates the range where the NADES concentration promotes optimal solids encapsulation and filter cake formation, facilitating efficient filtration.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nscenarios,\u00a0thinners\u00a0are\u00a0added\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0drilling\u00a0mud\u00a0to\u00a0reduce\u00a0the\u00a0thickness\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mudcake.\u00a0 The\u00a0NADESs\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0mud\u00a0mimicked\u00a0the\u00a0role\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0thinner\u00a0as\u00a0it\u00a0decreased\u00a0the\u00a0mudcake\u00a0and\u00a0 filtrate\u00a0volume.\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0this\u00a0attribute\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0NADES\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0associated\u00a0with\u00a0its\u00a0ability\u00a0 to\u00a0bond\u00a0with\u00a0clay\u00a0platelets\u00a0and\u00a0change\u00a0its\u00a0wettability\u00a0which\u00a0in\u00a0turn\u00a0will\u00a0modify\u00a0the\u00a0filtration\u00a0properties\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mud.\u00a0One\u00a0percent\u00a0NADES-based\u00a0mud\u00a0with\u00a0no\u00a0aging\u00a0showed\u00a0the\u00a0 minimum\u00a0decline\u00a0of\u00a026%\u00a0and\u00a030.4%\u00a0in\u00a0mudcake\u00a0thickness\u00a0and\u00a0filtrate\u00a0volume\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0 in\u00a0Figures\u00a03\u00a0and\u00a04.\u00a0The\u00a0elevated\u00a0aging\u00a0temperature\u00a0caused\u00a0the\u00a0mud\u00a0to\u00a0flocculate\u00a0and\u00a0aggregate\u00a0which\u00a0leads\u00a0to\u00a0thicker\u00a0mudcake\u00a0and\u00a0higher\u00a0filtrate\u00a0loss\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0evident\u00a0from\u00a0 Figures\u00a03\u00a0and\u00a04.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0interesting\u00a0to\u00a0note\u00a0that\u00a0NADES-based\u00a0aged\u00a0mud\u00a0samples\u00a0still\u00a0perform\u00a0 better\u00a0in\u00a0terms\u00a0of\u00a0filtration\u00a0properties\u00a0as\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0aged\u00a0base\u00a0sample\u00a0while\u00a0giving\u00a0 optimum\u00a0results\u00a0at\u00a01%\u00a0NADES\u00a0concentration.\u00a0The\u00a0NADES\u00a0can\u00a0interact\u00a0with\u00a0solid\u00a0particles\u00a0present\u00a0 in\u00a0drilling\u00a0mud,\u00a0encapsulating\u00a0them\u00a0and\u00a0aiding\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0filter\u00a0 cake\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0wellbore.\u00a0At\u00a0lower\u00a0concentrations,\u00a0there\u00a0might\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0enough\u00a0NADESs\u00a0to\u00a0effectively\u00a0encapsulate\u00a0and\u00a0hold\u00a0the\u00a0solids\u00a0together,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0poor\u00a0filter\u00a0cake\u00a0development\u00a0and\u00a0reduced\u00a0filtration\u00a0efficiency.\u00a0Conversely,\u00a0at\u00a0higher\u00a0concentrations,\u00a0an\u00a0excessive\u00a0 amount\u00a0of\u00a0NADESs\u00a0might\u00a0lead\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0dense\u00a0and\u00a0impermeable\u00a0filter\u00a0cake\u00a0 that\u00a0hinders\u00a0fluid\u00a0flow.\u00a0The\u00a0optimum\u00a0concentration\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03\u00a0indicates\u00a0the\u00a0range\u00a0where\u00a0 the\u00a0NADES\u00a0 concentration\u00a0 promotes\u00a0 optimal\u00a0 solids\u00a0 encapsulation\u00a0 and\u00a0 filter\u00a0 cake\u00a0 formation,\u00a0facilitating\u00a0efficient\u00a0filtration.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0Mudcake\u00a0thickness\u00a0of\u00a0NADES-based\u00a0mud.\u00a0\nFigure 3.

Comparison of Shale swelling caused by NADES, KCl, and EMIMCl.\nl inhibitors are able to inhibit shale swel ing to some extent. KCl inhibited shale s el ing up to 12 ; E I -Cl inhibited shale s el ing up to 22.8 ; and ES inhibited shale swelling up to 49.12% as shown i Figure 4. KCl mainly inh bits shale swelling by the cationic ex hange betw en clay ers. It exp ls the water cation between the clay layers and makes th clay re tively stable. KCl-based drilling mud has shown the lo est swelling inhibition property. This is because KCl needs to b used in a very high concentratio to g ve optimal results, which outweighs its advantages. Ionic liquids posse s a trong electrostatic force of attraction nd are able to interact with clay with an electrostatic force of attraction, thus neutralizing the clay, which stabilized the shale ydr tion process. Moreover, th hydrophobic alkyl chain also plays a vit l role in the swelling inhibitio properties of ionic liquids. Swelling inhibition due to EMIM-Cl is because of its ability to induce hydrophobicity in the medium and maks expulsion water between the aluminosilicate layers of clay easier. However, they are very expensive, and imidazolium-based ionic liquids are toxic and non-biodegradable; therefore, they are not a feasible solution for shale swelling problems. Conclusively, NADESs gave better results as compared to the other inhibitors, a result which is associated with its excellent hydrogen bond formation capability. NADES interacts with negatively charged clay and attaches onto it, thus neutralizing clay charges, which stabilizes the shale hydration process. Moreover, NADES also replaces water between the clay layers, which is confirmed from the results of d-spacing."

            "text": "2.6.1. FTIR of NADES-Based Mud\nFTIR has been conducted to examine and confirm the interaction of clay with different concentrations of NADES. Sodium bentonite (Na-Bt) contains alumina and silica incorporated in its layered caged structure. A measurement of 1032 cm\u22121 is the fingerprint region for alumina while 634 cm\u22121 is the fingerprint region for alumina mineral as shown in Figure 6. NADES has the strong ability to formulate hydrogen bond and the interaction by NADES and Na-Bt clay is shown by change in wavenumbers of silica region for different concentrations of NADES. The change in wavelength corresponds to the change in electronegativity difference which in turn depicts the formulation of new bonds. In the case of NADES, this new electrostatic interaction is hydrogen bonding. Thus, the FTIR confirms that NADES has successfully interacted with clay which in turn explains the modification of rheological and filtration properties of the drilling mud.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 8 of 14\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nincorporated\u00a0in\u00a0its\u00a0layered\u00a0caged\u00a0structure.\u00a0A\u00a0measurement\u00a0of\u00a01032\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0fingerprint\u00a0 region\u00a0for\u00a0alumina\u00a0while\u00a0634\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0fingerprint\u00a0region\u00a0for\u00a0alumina\u00a0mineral\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a06.\u00a0NADES\u00a0has\u00a0the\u00a0strong\u00a0ability\u00a0to\u00a0formulate\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0bond\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0interaction\u00a0 by\u00a0NADES\u00a0and\u00a0Na-Bt\u00a0clay\u00a0is\u00a0shown\u00a0by\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0wavenumbers\u00a0of\u00a0silica\u00a0region\u00a0for\u00a0different\u00a0concentrations\u00a0of\u00a0NADES.\u00a0The\u00a0change\u00a0 in\u00a0wavelength\u00a0corresponds\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0change\u00a0 in\u00a0 electronegativity\u00a0difference\u00a0which\u00a0in\u00a0turn\u00a0depicts\u00a0the\u00a0formulation\u00a0of\u00a0new\u00a0bonds.\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0 case\u00a0of\u00a0NADES,\u00a0 this\u00a0new\u00a0electrostatic\u00a0 interaction\u00a0 is\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0bonding.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0the\u00a0FTIR\u00a0 confirms\u00a0 that\u00a0NADES\u00a0has\u00a0 successfully\u00a0 interacted\u00a0with\u00a0clay\u00a0which\u00a0 in\u00a0 turn\u00a0explains\u00a0 the\u00a0 modification\u00a0of\u00a0rheological\u00a0and\u00a0filtration\u00a0properties\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0drilling\u00a0mud.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a06.\u00a0FTIR\u00a0of\u00a0NADES-based\u00a0drilling\u00a0mud.\u00a0\n2.6.2.\u00a0Surface\u00a0Tension\u00a0 The\u00a0anti-swelling\u00a0traits\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0clay\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0well\u00a0realized\u00a0by\u00a0studying\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0tension\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0base\u00a0mud\u00a0and\u00a0inhibitor-based\u00a0mud\u00a0at\u00a0various\u00a0concentrations.\u00a0Surface\u00a0tension\u00a0 has\u00a0a\u00a0direct\u00a0proportion\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0capillary\u00a0pressure,\u00a0though\u00a0the\u00a0relation\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0very\u00a0straightforward\u00a0[45].\u00a0The\u00a0more\u00a0the\u00a0capillary\u00a0pressure\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0shale,\u00a0the\u00a0higher\u00a0 the\u00a0tendency\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0for\u00a0water\u00a0cations\u00a0to\u00a0permeate\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0clay\u00a0layers\u00a0and\u00a0result\u00a0in\u00a0swelling\u00a0[46].\u00a0The\u00a0shale\u00a0inhibitors\u00a0have\u00a0the\u00a0tendency\u00a0to\u00a0impact\u00a0surface\u00a0activity\u00a0and\u00a0lower\u00a0the\u00a0 surface\u00a0tension,\u00a0which\u00a0obstructs\u00a0the\u00a0water\u00a0to\u00a0permeate\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0clay\u00a0layers.\u00a0The\u00a0maximum\u00a0 decline\u00a0of\u00a023.8%\u00a0 in\u00a0surface\u00a0 tension\u00a0had\u00a0been\u00a0noted\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0case\u00a0of\u00a01%\u00a0NADES\u00a0 inhibitor\u00a0 while\u00a014.2%,\u00a019.02%,\u00a06%,\u00a0and\u00a014.9%\u00a0declines\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0observed\u00a0for\u00a00.1%\u00a0NADES,\u00a02%\u00a0 NADES,\u00a04%\u00a0KCl,\u00a0and\u00a01%\u00a0EMIM-Cl,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a07.\u00a0The\u00a0decline\u00a0 in\u00a0 surface\u00a0 tension\u00a0by\u00a0NADES\u00a0 is\u00a0attributed\u00a0 to\u00a0 its\u00a0strong\u00a0ability\u00a0 to\u00a0 formulate\u00a0 the\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0 bond\u00a0with\u00a0clay,\u00a0thus\u00a0altering\u00a0the\u00a0contact\u00a0angle\u00a0and\u00a0capillary\u00a0behavior\u00a0which\u00a0in\u00a0turn\u00a0modifies\u00a0clay\u00a0behavior\u00a0in\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0water.\u00a0The\u00a0results\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0accordance\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0of\u00a0 LSM.\u00a0\ni re 6. I f - s rilli .\n2.6.2. Surface Tension\nThe anti-swelling traits of the clay can be well realized by studying the surface tension of the base mud and inhibitor-based mud at various concentrations. Surface tension has a direct proportion to the capillary pressure, though the relation is not very straightforward [45]. The more the capillary pressure will be at the surface of a shale, the higher the tendency will be for water cations to permeate into the clay layers and result in swelling [46]. The shale inhibitors have the tendency to impact surface activity and lower the surface tension, which obstructs the water to permeate into the clay layers. The maximum decline of 23.8% in surface tension had been noted in the case of 1% NADES inhibitor while 14.2%, 19.02%, 6%, and 14.9% declines have been observed for 0.1% NADES, 2% NADES, 4% KCl, and 1% EMIM-Cl, respectively, as shown in Figure 7. The decline in surface tension by NADES is attributed to its strong ability to formulate the hydrogen bond with clay, thus altering the contact angle and capillary behavior which in turn modifies clay behavior in presence of water. The results are in accordance with the results of LSM.

This decline in d-spacing values shows that the inhibitors have effectively intercalated between the clay layers and have expelled the water out from the clay layers thus making clay more stable against hydration. This also shows that all added inhibitors have more affinity towards clay than water which makes them apt for shale stabilization, and as per the comparison, 1% NADES has shown the most affinity towards clay as compared to water and proved to be the best inhibitor with optimized concentration in this study. The results of d-spacing are in accordance with results of the linear swell meter."

NADES has also decreased surface tension on clay surface which in turn reduced the capillary action and thus reduced the permeation of water cations into clay layers. Moreover, the decline in d-spacing of NADES-based mud shows that NADES possesses more affinity than water toward clay which makes it a potential shale inhibitor against hydration.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H.R. and M.A.; methodology, M.H.R.; validation, M.H.R.; formal analysis, M.H.R.; investigation, M.H.R.; resources, M.A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.H.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.A.; supervision, M.A.; project administration, M.A.; funding acquisition, M.A. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: The APC was funded by YUTP 015LC0-326.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5784 13 of 14\nData Availability Statement: No data are provided along with this research work.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Petroleum Engineering and Petroleum Geosciences Departments in UTP for providing lab facilities and resources to conduct this research work.
