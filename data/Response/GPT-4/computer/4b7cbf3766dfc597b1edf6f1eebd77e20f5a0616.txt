Comparative Analysis Across Different Universities and Countries: Conduct a study that compares waiting list procedures and outcomes across a variety of universities and countries. This research could explore how different educational systems approach the challenge of course enrollment limitations and waiting lists, including how they prioritize student enrollment. Investigating the impact of different strategies on student satisfaction, academic performance, and overall fairness could offer valuable insights for improving waiting list management globally.

Technology-Driven Solutions for Waiting List Management: Explore the development and implementation of advanced technology solutions, such as AI and machine learning algorithms, to manage course waiting lists more efficiently. This research could focus on creating systems that automatically adjust course capacities based on real-time demand and supply, prioritize student enrollment based on a wider range of criteria, and predict enrollment patterns to better prepare for future academic periods.

The Impact of Waiting List Policies on Student Behavior and Academic Planning: Investigate how different waiting list policies affect student behavior, such as course selection strategies and academic planning. This research could also explore the psychological impact on students, including stress and anxiety related to course enrollment uncertainty. Findings could help universities design waiting list policies that minimize negative impacts on students while promoting strategic academic planning.

Blended and Online Learning as a Solution to Enrollment Limitations: Study the effectiveness of blended and online learning models in mitigating the impact of course enrollment limitations. This research could examine how hybrid and fully online courses can be used to increase enrollment capacities without compromising educational quality. Additionally, it could explore student and faculty perceptions of these models and their impact on learning outcomes.

Longitudinal Study on the Outcomes of Improved Waiting List Procedures: Initiate a longitudinal study to track the long-term effects of the newly implemented waiting list procedures at Utrecht University or similar institutions. This research would monitor the academic success, satisfaction, and graduation rates of students affected by these changes compared to those under the old system. The findings could provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of specific waiting list management strategies and inform future improvements.
