"Third, the concentration of metal precursor added during the reaction changes the amount of NP growth, which can be leveraged in future studies to access more complex NPmorphologies. Finally, these results, including continuous NP formation, were observed in a variety of bimetallic NP systems as well, showing reasonable substrate versatility."
