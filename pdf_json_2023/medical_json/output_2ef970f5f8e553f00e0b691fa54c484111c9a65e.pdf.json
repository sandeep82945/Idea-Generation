The association between the noncanonical Wnt-signaling pathway and carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. This study investigated the significance of ROR2 expression in HCC. Methods. The study examined ROR2 expression in liver cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of ROR2 was performed on 243 resected HCC specimens. The study investigated ROR2 expression and its association with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis. Results. Findings showed that ROR2 was expressed in welldifferentiated Huh7 and HepG2 cells, but not in poorly differentiated HLE and HLF cells. Expression of ROR2 was positive in 147 (60.5%) and negative in 96 (39.5%) HCC specimens. A significant association was shown between ROR2 negativity and high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (P = 0.006), poor differentiation (P = 0.015), and Wnt5a negativity (P = 0.024). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for the ROR2-negative group (64.2 %) tended to be worse than for the ROR2-positive group (73.8%), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.312). The 5-year OS rate was 78.7% for the ROR2+Wnt5a+ group, 71.3 % for the ROR2+Wnt5a\u2212 group, 80.8% for the ROR2\u2212Wnt5a+ group, and 60.5 % for the ROR2\u2212Wnt5a\u2212 group. The OS in the ROR2\u2212Wnt5a\u2212 group was significantly poorer than in the ROR2+Wnt5a+ group (P = 0.030). The multivariate analysis showed that Wnt5a\u2212ROR2\u2212 was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.058; 95% confidence interval, 1.013\u20134.180; P = 0.045). Conclusions. The combination of ROR2 and Wnt5a may be a prognostic indicator for HCC. The Wnt5a/ROR2 signal pathway may be involved in the differentiation of HCC. This pathway may be a new therapeutic target for HCC.",

However, even after curative resection, HCC has a high recurrence rate.2 Better understanding of the mechanisms of HCC carcinogenesis and progression is critical to identification of novel target molecules for treatment and improvement of the prognosis for HCC patients.\nThe Wnt-signaling pathway is classified into canonical and noncanonical pathways. In the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway, \u03b2-catenin, which is normally degraded and maintained at low levels in the cytoplasm, accumulates in the cytoplasm from inhibition of degradation by Wnt stimulation. Accumulated \u03b2-catenin then translocates to the nucleus and binds to transcription factors to promote gene expression.3 Inappropriate activation of the canonical pathway is associated with carcinogenesis via abnormal \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023 First Received: 13 July 2023 Accepted: 15 September 2023 Published online: 9 October 2023 K.

Studies have shown that ROR2 is overexpressed in renal cancer, oral cancer, and malignant melanoma but suppressed in colon cancer.15\u201318 Thus, the role of ROR2 in cancer may differ depending on the type of cancer. Its role in carcinogenesis has not been completely determined.\nThe current study investigated the significance ROR2 expression and its association with Wnt5a in HCC."

The relationship between ROR2 expression and tumor differentiation was shown in both clinical specimens\nand cell lines, in which decreased expression of ROR2 was associated with decreased tumor differentiation. These results suggest that ROR2 alone is weak in action but more potent when coexisting with the ligand Wnt5a, and that the Wnt5a/ROR2-signaling pathway may be involved in HCC differentiation.\nAs shown in the supportive data of our previous study, Wnt5a/ROR2-binding is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation because the expression of E-cadherin decreased when the ligand Wnt5a was downregulated in Huh7, in which Wnt5a and ROR2 are co-expressed.8 The same phenomenon would be expected to occur when the expression of the receptor ROR2 is decreased, although the experiment should have been performed in which ROR2 expression was directly decreased.\nA stepwise dedifferentiation occurs during the carcinogenesis and progression of HCC. Dysplastic nodules arise from regenerative nodules of the cirrhotic liver, which gradually develop into well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated HCC.22 Wnt/\u03b2-cateninsignaling, TGF- \u03b2/SMAD-signaling, and PI3K/AKT-signaling are widely activated in HCC and cooperatively promote dedifferentiation of HCC.23 Furthermore, some reports have shown that the noncanonical Wnt pathway inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway in HCC cell lines.24 Therefore, these studies combined with the result in the current study that ROR2 expression is decreased in poorly differentiated cell lines suggest that inactivation of the noncanonical pathway from decreased ROR2 expression may activate the canonical pathway, leading to dedifferentiation.\nAs further support, in our immunohistochemical staining of ROR2 in 243 HCC cases, ROR2 negativity was significantly associated with high level of AFP (P = 0.006) and poor differentiation (P = 0.015), which correlated with tumor differentiation. The association of the noncanonical pathway involving ROR2 with the aforementioned signaling involved in dedifferentiation should be investigated in future studies.\nThis study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective single-center study. Therefore, prospective, multicenter studies are necessary to validate our results. To clarify the relationship between ROR2 and tumor differentiation in HCC, it is necessary to examine the signal transduction pathways involved.\nIn conclusion, our results showed that ROR2 in combination with Wnt5a may be a prognostic indicator in HCC. The Wnt5a/ROR2 signal pathway may be involved in the differentiation of HCC. Furthermore, this pathway may be a new therapeutic target for HCC.\nHBV hepatitis B virus, HCV hepatitis C virus, AFP \u03b1-fetoprotein, PIVKAII protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II a P < 0.05"
