    "abstractText": "Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are exceptionally sensitive detectors in the frequency band nHz\u2272 f \u2272 \u03bcHz. Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), with mass in the range 10\u221223 eV\u2272m\u03c6 \u2272 10\u221220 eV, is one class of DM models known to generate signals in this frequency window. While purely gravitational signatures of ULDM have been studied previously, in this work we consider two signals in PTAs which arise in the presence of direct couplings between ULDM and ordinary matter. These couplings induce variations in fundamental constants, i.e., particle masses and couplings. These variations can alter the moment of inertia of pulsars, inducing pulsar spin fluctuations via conservation of angular momentum, or induce apparent timing residuals due to reference clock shifts. By using mock data mimicking current PTA datasets, we show that PTA experiments outperform torsion balance and atomic clock constraints for ULDM coupled to electrons, muons, or gluons. In the case of coupling to quarks or photons, we find that PTAs and atomic clocks set similar constraints. Additionally, we discuss how future PTAs can further improve these constraints, and detail the unique properties of these signals relative to the previously studied effects of ULDM on PTAs.",

Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), with mass in the range 10\u221223 eV\u2272m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221220 eV, is one class of DM models known to generate signals in this frequency window. While purely gravitational signatures of ULDM have been studied previously, in this work we consider two signals in PTAs which arise in the presence of direct couplings between ULDM and ordinary matter. These couplings induce variations in fundamental constants, i.e., particle masses and couplings. These variations can alter the moment of inertia of pulsars, inducing pulsar spin fluctuations via conservation of angular momentum, or induce apparent timing residuals due to reference clock shifts. By using mock data mimicking current PTA datasets, we show that PTA experiments outperform torsion balance and atomic clock constraints for ULDM coupled to electrons, muons, or gluons. In the case of coupling to quarks or photons, we find that PTAs and atomic clocks set similar constraints. Additionally, we discuss how future PTAs can further improve these constraints, and detail the unique properties of these signals relative to the previously studied effects of ULDM on PTAs.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.035032\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIdentifying the nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the most important goals of physics. While roughly five times more abundant thanvisiblematter, shockingly little is known about how DM fits in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. One class of DM models, known as ultralight DM (ULDM), considers DM candidates with tiny particle masses, typicallym\u03d5 \u226a 10\u22126 eV. Such light DM candidates must be bosonic, otherwise they would severely violate the Tremaine-Gunn bound [1\u20134] on light fermionic DM. These light DM candidates are well described by classical fields oscillating in time with a frequency 2\u03c0f \u2243m\u03d5. In the presence of a direct coupling between DM and the SM, these oscillations behave as time-dependent sources for SM fields, and can lead to time-dependent signals with \u03c9 \u223cm\u03d5. Therefore pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), thanks to their tremendous ability to detect signals in the nHz \u2212 \u03bcHz\nfrequency range, offer a unique probe of ULDM candidates in the mass window 10\u221223 eV \u2212 10\u221220 eV.1 Models of ULDM in this mass range are theoretically interesting since they are able to suppress structure formation up to length scales much larger than a prototypical WIMP particle [5]. This feature of ULDM models has been proposed as a possible solution of the small-scale challenges faced by the \u039bCDM paradigm, such as the missing satellites, and corecusp problem. See Ref. [6] for a recent review. The phenomenology of ULDM particles is vast [7\u201315]. Independent of any specific DM model, a cosmic background of ULDM will affect CMB observables [16\u201319], galaxy density profiles and stellar kinematics [20\u201324], the Milky Way (sub)Halo mass functions [25,26], Lyman-\u03b1 observables [5,27\u201329], and propagation of light due to metric fluctuations [30\u201333]. Specific models of ULDM can introduce further interesting effects such as atomic clock shifts [7,19,34\u201341], relative accelerations in interferometers and PTAs [42\u201348], and changes to orbital periods of binary pulsars [49\u201351]. Moreover, ULDM can mediate model dependent Yukawa forces between particles, allowing it to be searched for even in the absence of a cosmic background [42,52,53]. *david.kaplan@jhu.edu \u2020amitri@caltech.edu \u2021ttrickle@caltech.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

However non-CMB constraints are susceptible to uncertainties related to determining properties of small scale structures, for which cosmological simulations [21,54], and analytic methods [55] can be insufficient to derive bounds with high precision. Therefore it is important to have complementary probes in this mass region which are not subject to the same uncertainties. Moreover, many of these astrophysical constraints are dependent on the ULDM constituting all of the DM, and therefore weaken dramatically when considering ULDMwhich is a subcomponent of the DM. In this work we focus on the effect of ULDM induced fluctuations of fundamental constants. These fluctuations, in the mass window considered here, have previously been searched for before via their effects on atomic clock systems [34\u201337,39] and torsion balance experiments [52,53]. Here we detail two experimental signatures in PTAs. The first is due to fluctuations in the PTA reference clock, previously discussed in Ref. [42]. PTAs are exceptionally sensitive to timing residuals, and fluctuations in the reference clock used can be observed via these residuals. The second is from pulsar spin fluctuations, previously discussed in Refs. [42,56]. ULDM induced particle mass fluctuations will cause the pulsar mass to fluctuate. Therefore, by conservation of angular momentum, this must be accompanied by a fluctuation in the pulsar spin. We set constraints on these signals by using mock data closely resembling the current IPTA second data release, and a more futuristic PTA dataset. We find that in the mass range 10\u221223 eV\u2272m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221220 eV current PTA constraints are competitive or stronger than current atomic clocks and fifth force constraints for a wide range of ULDM models. The outline of this paper is as follows, in Sec. II we begin by reviewing the ULDM models which give rise to fundamental constant fluctuations, and then show how these models generate a PTA signal by inducing pulsar spin fluctuations, Sec. II A, and reference clock shifts, Sec. II B. In Sec. III we describe the analyses performed to set constraints, and the procedure followed to generate the mock data. In Sec. IV we discuss the results of the analyses, and the connection between the signals searched for here and those previously searched for in PTAs (Sec. IVA)."

Owing to their high phase space density, cold (v\u03d5 \u223c 10\u22123) ULDM candidates are well described by a classical field oscillating in time with a frequency \u03c9 \u00bc m\u03d5,\n\u03d5\u00f0x\u20d7; t\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2\u03c1\u03d5 p m\u03d5 \u03d5\u0302\u00f0x\u20d7\u00de cos \u00f0m\u03d5t\u00fe \u03b3\u00f0x\u20d7\u00de\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u03d5\u0302\u00f0x\u20d7\u00de is a random amplitude with zero mean and unit variance, \u03c1\u03d5 \u00bc 0.4 GeVcm\u22123 is the local ULDM density, and \u03b3\u00f0x\u20d7\u00de is the phase of the field. This ULDM field can directly couple to ordinary matter in a plethora of ways. Following the notation in Ref. [8], we parametrize the couplings to the QED sector as\nL\u03d5;QED \u2283 \u03d5\n\u039b d\u03b3 4e2 F\u03bc\u03bdF\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 X f\u00bce;\u03bc dfmff\u0304f ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere \u039b \u00bc MPl= ffiffiffiffiffi 4\u03c0 p , MPl is the Planck mass, and d\u2019s are dimensionless coupling coefficients.2 Due to these couplings, fluctuations in the ULDM background induce variations in the fundamental constants of the SM. Specifically, the couplings in Eq. (2) drive fluctuations in the electromagnetic coupling constant, \u03b1, and the electron and muon masses, me;\u03bc,\n\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1 \u00bc d\u03b3 \u039b \u03d5;\n\u03b4me;\u03bc me;\u03bc \u00bc de;\u03bc \u039b \u03d5: \u00f03\u00de\nULDM can also couple to the QCD sector, however, more care must be taken relative to the QED case due to the running of masses and couplings (implicitly ignored for QED). Still following the notation of Ref. [8], we parametrize the couplings to the QCD sector as\nL\u03d5;QCD \u2283 \u03d5\n\u039b dg\u03b23 2g3 GA\u03bc\u03bdG \u03bc\u03bd A \u2212 X q\u00bcu;d \u00f0dq \u00fe \u03b3qdg\u00demqq\u0304q\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u03b23 is the QCD beta function, and \u03b3q are the light quark anomalous dimensions. This specific parametrization of the couplings is useful since it makes the \u03d5 induced shift to fundamental constants independent of \u03b23 and \u03b3q. Specifically, the light quark mass shifts are given by\n\u03b4mq mq \u00bc dq \u039b \u03d5; \u00f05\u00de\nwhile the shifts of the nucleon masses are\n\u03b4mp;n mp;n \u2243 1 \u039b \u00f0dg \u00fe Cndm\u0302\u00de\u03d5; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere Cn \u00bc 0.048 [8], and we have defined the symmetric combination of the quark mass couplings as\n2Note that the electromagnetic field strength tensor, F\u03bc\u03bd, is normalized such that the electron has unit charge.\n035032-2\ndm\u0302 \u2261 dumu \u00fe ddmdmu \u00femd : \u00f07\u00de\nThe first term in Eq. (6) comes from the shift to the QCD scale, \u03b4\u039bQCD=\u039bQCD \u00bc dg\u00f0\u03d5=\u039b\u00de. The second, subleading, term comes from the shift to the light quark masses, Eq. (5). The contribution from a strange quark mass shift is expected to be smaller by a factor of \u223c4 [38], although there are uncertainties in deriving its precise value [8]. The effect of the other d\u2019s are even smaller [8], and neglected here for simplicity, though in principle these searches can put constraints on those parameters as well. With the effects of ULDM on fundamental constants defined, we now describe how these can affect PTA observables. Pulsars are rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles. Given a misalignment between the rotation and magnetic axes, the pulsar rotation can cause the radiation beam to sweep across Earth. If this happens, a pulsar will appear to an Earth observer as a periodic emitter. Thanks to pulsars\u2019 extremely stable rotation periods, the time of arrival (TOA) of these radiation pulses can be predicted with great accuracy. PTAs accurately measure the TOAs by looking for deviations from these predictions, a quantity referred to as timing residuals. In the following sections we will discuss how the fundamental constant variations can source these timing residuals and therefore be detected, or constrained, by PTAs. Specifically, in Sec. II A we describe how mass fluctuations can induce pulsars spin variations which naturally source timing residuals. In Sec. II B we describe how shifts in fundamental constants can induce shifts in the energy levels of the atomic clocks used by PTAs, and lead to apparent aberrations in the pulsars TOAs."

The TAI estimates TT using measurements from\n035032-3\nan ensemble of more than 400 atomic clocks (most of them based on the hyperfine transition of the ground state of the Cesium atom). A shift in the frequency of these clocks will induce an apparent shift in the pulsar spin frequency, which translates to pulsar timing residuals according to the first equality in Eq. (10). In this section, we will discuss how fundamental constant variations can induce such shifts. Using a similar notation to Ref.

Thepulsar spin fluctuation signal is dominant formuon-philic models, while the reference clock shift is dominant for models coupling to photons or electrons. The two signals also differ in the correlations between pulsars. Assuming the distance between pulsars is much larger than the DM coherence length, the pulsar spin fluctuations will be uncorrelated between pulsars, i.e., hhIhJi \u221d h\u03d5\u0302\u00f0x\u20d7I\u00de\u03d5\u0302\u00f0x\u20d7J\u00dei \u2243 \u03b4IJ. Conversely, the reference clock shift affects all of the pulsars in an identical way; this will leave an imprint of monopole correlations across the array, or hhIhJi \u221d 1. Note that both of\nthese signals are distinct from those of gravitational waves or Doppler shifts which will leave quadrupole, and dipole signatures, respectively. A summary of the difference between these effects and other ULDM effects in PTAs is given in Table III in Sec. IVA."

For each of the N TOAs, the white noise is assumed to be a normally distributed random variable, with zero mean and variance,\nhni;\u03bcnj;\u03bdi \u00bc E2\u03bc\u03c3i\u03b4ij\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u00feQ2\u03bc\u03b4ij\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u00f019\u00de\nwhere \u03c3i is the TOA uncertainty for the ith observation,E\u03bc is the extra factor (EFAC) parameter for the receiver-backend system \u03bc, and Q\u03bc is the extra quadrature (EQUAD) parameter.3\nRed noise is modeled in a Fourier basis for frequencies k=T, where k indexes the harmonics of the basis and T is the observation time. Since red noise is a low-frequency process, the summation over k is truncated to some reasonable frequency, Nf. For example, in the most recent NANOGrav search for a gravitational wave background (GWB) this cutoff was set to Nf \u00bc 30. We will use the same cutoff in our analyses. This set of 2Nf sine-cosine\n3If the data are measured in multiple frequency bands, as they are in NANOGrav, there is also extra correlated (ECORR) white noise between different frequency bands within the same observation epoch [61]. It should also be noticed that when considering data sets withmuch longer observation times, and using telescopes with greater sensitivity than current PTAs, EFAC and EQUAD might not capture the effects from all noise sources [62].\n035032-4\npairs evaluated at the different observation times is contained in the Fourier density matrix, F. The Fourier coefficients a\u20d7 are assumed to be normally distributed random variables, with zero mean and covariance matrix ha\u20d7a\u20d7Ti \u00bc \u03d5. This covariance matrix will contain all the possible sources of low-frequency achromatic noise. For our analysis we will consider two possible sources: pulsar intrinsic red noise, and GWB. Therefore, \u03d5 takes the form\n\u00bd\u03d5 \u00f0ak\u00de\u00f0bj\u00de \u00bc \u0393ab\u03c1k\u03b4kj \u00fe \u03baak\u03b4kj\u03b4ab \u00f020\u00de\nwhere a and b index pulsars, k and j index frequency harmonics, and \u0393ab is the GWB overlap function for the pulsar pair \u00f0a; b\u00de. In this expression the terms \u03c1k (\u03baak) are related to the power spectral density (PSD) of the timing residuals, S\u00f0f\u00de, induced by the GWB (pulsar intrinsic red noise) such that \u03c1\u00f0f\u00de \u00bc S\u00f0f\u00de\u0394f with \u0394f \u00bc 1=T [and similarly for \u03baa\u00f0f\u00de]. Following the assumptions commonly made in PTA analysis, we model the PSD for the two red noise contributions as\n\u03c1\u00f0f\u00de \u00bc A 2 GWB\n12\u03c02\nf\n1 year\u22121\n\u2212\u03b3GWB\nyear2; \u00f021\u00de\n\u03ba\u00f0f\u00de \u00bc A 2 a\n12\u03c02\nf\n1 year\u22121\n\u2212\u03b3a\nyear2: \u00f022\u00de\nFinally, possible small deviations from the initial best-fit values of them timing-ephemeris parameters are accounted for by the term M\u03f5\u20d7. The design matrix, M, is an N \u00d7m matrix containing the partial derivatives of the TOAs with respect to each timing-ephemeris parameter (evaluated at the initial best-fit value), and \u03f5\u20d7 is a vector containing the linear offset from these best-fit parameters. Since in most analyses, ours included, we do not care about the specific realization of the noise but are instead interested in its statistical properties, we can analytically marginalize over all the possible noise realizations (i.e., integrate over all the possible values of a\u20d7 and \u03f5\u20d7). This leaves us with a marginalized likelihood that depends only on the hyperparameters, \u03b7 \u00bc \u00f0AGWB; \u03b3;\u2026\u00de, characterizing the statistical properties of the noise [63,64]:\np\u00f0\u03b4t!j\u03b7\u00de \u00bc exp \u00f0\u2212 1 2 \u03b4t !T C\u22121\u03b4t !\u00deffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ndet\u00f02\u03c0C\u00dep ; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere C \u00bc N \u00fe TBTT .

The results are shown in Figs. 1, where we compare them to constraints from atomic clocks [34,35,39], torsion balances [53], and decay of neutron star binaries orbits [50,51]. While other constraints apply to these models (see, e.g., Refs. [34,53,76]) to simplify Fig. 1 we only show those which have the strongest constraints in the mass range of interest here: 10\u221224 eV\u2272m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221220 eV. We find that, in the mass range under consideration, an IPTA-like array can already be competitive with the most precise atomic clock experiments [34,35,39] available today when ULDM couples to the QCD sector via dm\u0302, and strictly outperforms them when the coupling happens through dg.

[39] (as well as Ref. [45]) take into account the stochastic nature of \u03d5\u0302, as done here. Some previous constraints, e.g., those in Ref. [35], assume \u03d5\u0302 \u00bc 1which can lead to O\u00f01\u00de differences in the projections [14]. For simplicity, we directly reproduce the constraints from their respective paper and do not rescale them.\n035032-6\nthis cancellation one needs to compare different types of transitions as done in [34]. At the moment, the observation time of this experiment limits the constraints to 10\u221221 eV\u2272 m\u03d5. PTAs can also beat torsion balance constraints [52,53] by several orders of magnitude. Lastly, we note that PTAs are exceptionally sensitive to d\u03bc. This is due to the large number of muons within neutron stars, sustained through \u03b2 equilibrium [77,78]. This allows PTAs to improve by more than three orders of magnitude the next best projected constraints from the orbital decay of a neutron star binary system [50,51]. All of the previous conclusions are amplified for future PTA experiments. With better timing parameters and more pulsars, a future PTAwill be a strict improvement over the IPTA, as can be seen in Fig. 1.5 Similar improvements\ncould also be achieved by the IPTA collaborations, as the observation time and number of pulsars keep increasing. To gain intuition for the dependence of these constraints on the PTA parameters we will momentarily resort to a frequentist signal analysis approach, see Refs. [79\u201382] for more details. Given a deterministic signal in each pulsar, hI \u00bc A sin \u00f0m\u03d5t\u00fe \u03b3\u00de for simplicity, and assuming NP identical pulsars with only white noise, the signal SNR can be shown to scale as,\nSNR2 \u221d NPT \u03c32\u0394t A2: \u00f028\u00de\nThis explains the scaling of the constraints in Fig. 1 at high masses; SNR \u221d A \u221d d=m2\u03d5 and therefore the constraints on d are proportional to m2\u03d5. The scaling of Eq. (28) is appropriate when the signal is known in all the pulsars, i.e., for an Earth term signal, since this SNR is derived using a matched filter approach. A pulsar dependent signal would have a more complicated, weaker, dependence on NP, with all other dependencies being equal. With the\n5The increased dimensionality of the parameter space for the future PTA setup makes sampling computationally demanding. Because of this, some constraints are less converged, specifically the correlated constraints on dm\u0302; d\u03bc, and dg.

At low masses, m\u03d5 \u2272 1=T, this picture breaks down. In this limit, the signal no longer oscillates over the observing time and looks like a polynomial expanded in m\u03d5t. PTAs are not sensitive to the first few terms, up to O\u00f0t2\u00de, in this polynomial since they are degenerate with the timing model [79]. The first term they are sensitive to is \u221d A\u00f0m\u03d5t\u00de3, and therefore at low masses, SNR \u221d A\u00f0m\u03d5T\u00de3 and the constraints weaken as d \u221d 1=m\u03d5. In addition to these subtraction effects, red noise can also deteriorate the signal significance [83] at low masses. This explains why the constraints begin to flatten before turning to the d \u221d 1=m\u03d5 scaling. Lastly, we note that the reduced sensitivity around f \u223c year\u22121 is due to the fact that the relative position of the pulsar, which oscillates yearly, is not known to high precision [74,75] and must be fit away, therefore reducing sensitivity."

A summary of our discussion is given in Table III, previous effects are labeled \u201cShapiro\u201d and \u201cDoppler,\u201d and the new effects are labeled \u201cpulsar spin fluctuations\u201d and \u201creference clock shift\u201d. The primary purpose of most PTAs is to measure the stochastic gravitational wave background. These ripples in\nspace-time affect the photons\u2019 geodesic when traveling from the pulsar to the Earth. ULDM can induce a similar effect; the local ULDM density sources fluctuations to the metric which can affect light travel time in near complete analogy with the gravitational waves PTAs are searching for. This effect only depends on the background ULDM density and is model independent; any ULDM model which constitutes all of the DM will produce this effect.

In this region the purely gravitational signal is stronger and a more thorough analysis should include all effects. However these signals are not degenerate for a few reasons. First, the purely gravitational signal has a frequency of \u03c9 \u00bc 2m\u03d5 whereas the model dependent ULDM signals have a frequency of \u03c9 \u00bc m\u03d5. In addition, the pulsar spin fluctuation signal is uncorrelated between pulsars, whereas the purely gravitational one is perfectly correlated giving another method of disentangling the signals. Recently, the Doppler effect from vector ULDM has been studied using the Parkes PTA dataset [45]. This effect can be understood by thinking about the vector DM sourcing a dark \u201celectric\u201d field from \u2202t\u03d5. If the pulsar or Earth are charged under this dark force they will accelerate in the presence of this field. A similar effect is present for scalar ULDM, however the acceleration induced will be due to the spatial derivative of the field, a \u223c\u2207\u03d5, leading to a suppression since v\u03d5 \u223c 10\u22123. Therefore this effect will be subdominant to those discussed here which are not velocity suppressed. However the signal correlations are dipolar between pulsars which could potentially be used to search for this smaller signal."

In this work we have discussed two types of signals generically expected from scalar ULDM models with direct couplings to the SM. These couplings will generate apparent fluctuations in the SM fundamental constants, e.g., particle masses and couplings, which are then realized as new contributions to the timing residuals. The two signals we discussed were: \u201cpulsar spin fluctuations,\u201d Sec. II A, generated via changes to the moment of inertia and conservation of angular momentum, and \u201creference clock shifts,\u201d Sec. II B which change the tick frequency of the reference clocks used for the PTA. Notably, neither of these effects suffer from a velocity suppression as a Doppler shift would.
