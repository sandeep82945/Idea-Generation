 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct similar studies on chloramphenicol resistance rates in other countries to determine if the trends found in Israel are consistent globally. This could help guide treatment recommendations. 

2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria, especially in Pseudomonas aeruginosa which showed high resistance rates. This could uncover new treatment targets.

3. Perform clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chloramphenicol for treating multidrug-resistant infections. This could provide evidence for reintroducing it into clinical practice.

4. Develop modified versions or derivatives of chloramphenicol to overcome existing resistance mechanisms. This could create new treatment options against resistant bacteria. 

5. Use genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to identify novel resistance determinants in chloramphenicol-resistant isolates. These studies could elucidate how resistance emerges and spreads.
