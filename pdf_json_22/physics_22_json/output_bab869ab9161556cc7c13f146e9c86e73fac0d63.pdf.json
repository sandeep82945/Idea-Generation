    "abstractText": "Generation of perpendicular effective magnetic field or perpendicular spins (\u03c3z) is central for the development of energy-efficient, scalable, and external-magnetic-field-free spintronic memory and computing technologies. Here, we report the first identification and the profound impacts of a significant effective perpendicular magnetic field that can arise from asymmetric current spreading within magnetic microstrips and Hall bars. This effective perpendicular magnetic field can exhibit all the three characteristics that have been widely assumed in the literature to \u201csignify\u201d the presence of a flow of \u03c3z, i.e., external-magnetic-field-free current switching of uniform perpendicular magnetization, a sin2\u03c6-dependent contribution in spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance signal of in-plane magnetization (\u03c6 is the angle of the external magnetic field with respect to the current, and a \u03c6-independent but field-dependent contribution in the second harmonic Hall voltage of in-plane magnetization. This finding suggests that it is critical to include current spreading effects in the analyses of various spin polarizations and spin-orbit torques in magnetic heterostructure. Technologically, our results provide perpendicular effective magnetic field induced by asymmetric current spreading as a novel, universally accessible mechanism for efficient, scalable, and external-magnetic-field-free magnetization switching in memory and computing technologies.",

Microscopically, perpendicular magnetization can be\nswitched by a current of transverse spins (\u03c3y) under the assist of an in-plane effective magnetic field along current (\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc65 eff, to overcome the Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interaction or to break the switching symmetry)1, or by an antidamping spin torque exerted by high-density current of perpendicular spins (\u03c3z)2-10, or by a strong perpendicular effective magnetic field (\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff)11-15. Since the first method (\u03c3y+\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc65 eff) is hardly energy-efficient or scalable, searching of \u03c3z or \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff in magnetic heterostructures becomes a very hot topic.\nExperimentally, it is widely assumed that the presence of \u03c3z could be concluded from a small but sizable sin2\u03c6 dependent contribution in spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR)2,7,8,16-18 or a \u03c6 independent second harmonic Hall voltage response (HHVR)5,19,20 of an in-plane magnetization (\u03c6 is the angle of external magnetic\nfield with respect to the current). Presence of \u03c3z is also claimed from the occurrence of external-field-free current switching of a uniform perpendicular magnetization4,9-15 because the polarization and fieldlike spin-orbit torque\n(SOT) field of \u03c3z, if any, are along the film normal.\nIn this work, we show that \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff can arise from asymmetric current spreading and thus can widely exist in STFMR bars and Hall bars of magnetic heterostructures. While being microscopically distinct from \u03c3z, this currentspreading-induced \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff shows all the three characteristics that were widely assumed in the literature to signify the presence of \u03c3z, i.e., it can enable external-field-free current switching of perpendicular magnetization and contributes to HHVR and ST-FMR signals of in-plane magnetization in analogue to the fieldlike SOT of \u03c3z. Neglect of asymmetric current spreading can lead to erroneous analyses of various spin polarizations and SOTs."

            "text": "We first perform ST-FMR measurements on the Pt 4/Py 9.4 microstrips using the nominally symmetric 3-\nterminal contact configuration in Fig. 1(a). The symmetric (S) and anti-symmetric (A) components of the ST-FMR\nresponses for the Pt 4/Py 9.4 are plotted in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) as a function of \u03c6 (see Ref. 28 and Supplementary\nmaterials for the method how to determine the S and A). Considering a magnetic strip interacting with a spin current with arbitrary spin polarization \u03c3 = (\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z), the S and A values should vary with \u03c6 following2,22,23:\nS =SDL,y sin2\u03c6cos\u03c6 + SDL,x sin2\u03c6sin\u03c6 + SFL,z sin2\u03c6 + SSPsin\u03c6, (1)\nA = AFL,y sin2\u03c6 cos\u03c6 + AFL,x sin2\u03c6 sin\u03c6 + ADL, z sin2\u03c6. (2)\nThe four terms of Eq. (1) are contributions of the dampinglike SOT of \u03c3y, the dampinglike SOT of \u03c3x, \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff (fieldlike SOT of \u03c3z and others), and spin pumping, respectively. Equation (2) includes the contributions from the sum of the fieldlike SOT of \u03c3y and the transverse Oersted field, the fieldlike SOT of \u03c3x, and the dampinglike SOT of \u03c3z. The fits of the S and A data to Eqs. (1) and (2) untangle different contributions and yield the values of SDL,y, SDL,x, SFL,z, SSP, AFL,y, AFL,x, and ADL,z. As expected, there is a predominant contribution from \u03c3y (SDL,y, AFL,y) but no indication of \u03c3x (SDL,x = 0, AFL,x = 0, see Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)).\nHowever, it is striking that such heavy metal/ferromagnet (HM/FM) samples exhibit a non-negligible SFL,z term\nand thus a non-zero \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff, in the case of the 3-terminal geometry (Fig. 1(a)). This \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff is unlikely to arise from \u03c3z because we only measure a negligible dampinglike SOT of \u03c3z (i.e., ADL,z \u2248 0). This is reasonable because the sputter-deposited polycrystalline bilayers do not have a long-range lateral crystal or magnetic symmetry breaking.\nWe also find no obvious correlation between SFL,z and the interfacial SOC strength for the Pt/FM samples. First, we find a strong SFL,z component in control samples Cu 2/Py 9.4/Cu 2 and Cu 2/FeCoB 9.6/Cu 2 with negligible SOC (Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)). As we show in Fig. 2(c), the SFL,z/SDL,y ratios for the Pt/Py, Pt/FeCoB, and Pt/Ni samples, with similar layer thicknesses, do not scale with the interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density\n(Ks) of the Pt/FM interfaces (as determined in Supplementary Materials), with Ks reflecting the interfacial SOC strength24,25. These observations indicate that the \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff here is not induced by any SOC-related precession/rotation scattering4,5. The SFL,z/AFL,y ratio of a given device is found to be largely independent of the power of the rf current (Fig. 2(d)), excluding any relevance of the \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff to thermal effects. Note that the \u201chidden\u201d vertical symmetry breaking that leads to bulk SOT of \u03c3y in ferromagnets21,26 and ferrimagnets27 cannot explain the \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff because the latter requires a lateral rather than vertical asymmetry.\nL=20 \u03bcm). The solid curves represent the SFL,z, SDL,y, and Ssp components as determined from fit of the data to Eq.(1). (c) SFL,z/SDL,y for the Pt 4/Py 9.4, Pt 4/FeCoB 9.6, and Pt 4/Ni 9.2 plotted as a function of interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density (Ks) of the Pt/FM interfaces. (d) Dependence on the rf power of SFL,z/SDL,y for the Pt 4/Py 9.4. The data are from 3-terminal ST-FMR measurements. In (a)-(c), the rf power is 15 dBm.\nNext, we show that the \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff is microscopically a perpendicular Oersted field arising from asymmetric current spreading near the contacts of ST-FMR devices. First, SFL,z for the same Pt/Py device becomes a factor of 6 greater when the contact is switched from 3-terminal ST-FMR configuration (nominally symmetric, Fig. 1(a)) to strongly\nasymmetric 2-terminal ones (Figs. 3(a) and 3(d)). SFL,z also reverses sign when contact geometry is switched from that in Fig. 3(a) to the one in Fig. 3(d), which is in contrast to SDL,y that remains essentially the same in both sign and magnitude.\nOne of the features of current spreading near the contacts should be an apparent dependence of the resultant \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff on the width W and length L of the ST-FMR device, because the lateral current density asymmetry should decrease (increase) with reducing W (L). This can be quantitatively checked by using the ratio of SFL,z/SDL,y to represent the relative strength of \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff/HDL,y. Indeed, the measured value of SFL,z/SDL,y for the Pt 4/Py 9.4 devices decreases substantially as W decreases (L= 20 \u03bcm, Fig. 4(a)) and increases as L decreases (W = 10 \u03bcm, Fig. 4(a)).\nAs shown in Fig. 4(b), the SFL,z/SDL,y ratio increases with the FM thickness approximately following a parabolic function, which can be understood by in-plane current spreading near the contacts (Supplementary Materials).\nbeing injected from (a) left and (d) right contact arms, respectively. \u03c6 dependence of (b) S and (c) A from 2-\nterminal ST-FMR measurements with contact configuration in (a). \u03c6 dependence of (e) S and (f) A from 2-terminal\nST-FMR measurements with contact configuration in (d). The solid curves in (b) and (e) represent the SFL,z, SDL,y, and Ssp components as determined from fit of the data to Eq.(1). The solid curves in (c) and (f) represent the ADL,z and AFL,y components as determined from fit of the data to Eq.(2).\nEffects on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance analysis\nNow we discuss how the \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff affects the estimation of the efficiency of the dampinglike SOT of \u03c3y. Taking\ninto account the asymmetric current spreading effect, we define a FMR efficiency using the values of SDL,y and AFL,y from angle-dependent FMR measurements (Eq. (1) and Eq. (2)) as\n\ud835\udf09FMR,y \u2261 \ud835\udc46DL,y\n\ud835\udc34FL,y\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf070\ud835\udc40s\ud835\udc61FM\ud835\udc61HM\n\u210f \u221a1 +\n4\u03c0\ud835\udc40eff\n\ud835\udc3br , (3)\n\ud835\udf09DL,y \ud835\udc57 would be the inverse intercept in the linear fit of 1/\ud835\udf09FMR,y vs 1/tFM 28,29. Here, e is the electron charge, \u210f the reduced Planck constant, \u03bc0 the vacuum permeability, tHM the thickness of the HM, and 4\u03c0Meff the effective demagnetization field of the FM estimated from Kittel\u2019s equation (Supplementary Materials). The saturation magnetization (Ms) is determined by vibrating sample magnetometry to be 370 \u00b1 30 emu/cm3 for the Ni, 705 \u00b1 50 emu/cm3 for the Py, and 1180 \u00b1 40 emu/cm3 for the FeCoB.\n\ud835\udf09DL,y \ud835\udc57 in 2-terminal ST-FMR measurements at \u03c6 = 45o compared to 3-terminal measurements.\nFigure 4(c) shows the 1/\ud835\udf09FMR,y vs 1/tFM results from 3-terminal ST-FMR measurements, from which \ud835\udf09DL,y \ud835\udc57\nis determined to be 0.062 \u00b1 0.003 for Pt/FeCoB, 0.053 \u00b1 0.003 for Pt/Py, and 0.046 \u00b1 0.003 for Pt/Ni. The slight variation of \ud835\udf09DL,y \ud835\udc57 of these samples is attributed to the change of resistivity (\u03c1xx) and thus the spin Hall ratio (\u03b8SH= \u03c3SH\u03c1xx, where \u03c3SH is the spin Hall conductivity of the transverse spins) of the Pt layers 30. As we determine by\nmeasuring the conductance enhancement of the corresponding stacks (tPt = 4 nm) relative to the control tPt = 0 nm stack, \u03c1xx of the 4 nm Pt layer is 42 \u00b5\u2126 cm, 32 \u00b5\u2126 cm, and 29 \u00b5\u2126 cm in contact with FeCoB, Py, and Ni, respectively. Note that the spin transparency of the Pt/FM interfaces should be close in these samples because the spin-mixing conductance of Pt/FM interfaces is insensitive to the type of the FM 25 and there is negligible spin memory loss31 as indicated by the small interfacial magnetic anisotropy energy density (Fig. 2(c)). Importantly, we find that, regardless of the contact configuration, \ud835\udf09DL,y \ud835\udc57 can be determined from such angle- and thicknessdependent ST-FMR measurements (Fig. 4(d)).\nHowever, as we show in Figs. 4(e) and 4(f), a 2-terminal ST-FMR measurement at a single angle (e.g., \u03c6 =\n45o) leads to a substantial under- or over-estimation of \ud835\udf09DL,y \ud835\udc57 , depending on the current direction. This observation is consistent with a previous study that the SDL,y/AFL,y ratio in 2-terminal ST-FMR measurement deviates from that from \u03c6-dependent 3-terminal measurements32. This is likely a universal issue for 2-terminal ST-FMR measurements in which a significant \ud835\udc3bz eff exists due to asymmetric current spreading33.\nEffects on second harmonic Hall voltage of in-plane magnetization\nWe show below that such asymmetric current spreading also induces \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff in Hall bar devices (Figs. 5(a)-\n5(f)). Within the approximation of an in-plane magnetized macrospin, the angle dependence of the second HHVR (V2\u03c9) under a sinusoidal electric field E = 25.4 kV/m and an in-plane magnetic bias field (H) follows19,20,34,35:\nV2\u03c9 = VDL,y+ANE cos\u03c6 + VFL,y+Oe cos\u03c6cos2\u03c6 + VDL,z cos2\u03c6 + VFL,z+Oe + VPNEsin2\u03c6 (4)\nwith VDL,y+ANE = VAHEHDL,y /2(Hk+H) + VANE, (5)\nVFL,y+Oe = -VPHE\ud835\udc3by eff/2H, (6) VDL,z = -VPHEHDL,z/2H, (7) VFL,z+Oe = VAHE\ud835\udc3bz eff/2(Hk+H), (8) Here, VPHE, VAHE, VPNE, and VANE are the planar Hall voltage, the anomalous Hall voltage, the planar Nernst\nvoltage, and the anomalous Nernst voltage; VDL,y+ANE is the contributions of dampinglike SOT field of \u03c3y (HDL,y) and VANE; VFL,y+Oe is the contributions of fieldlike SOT field of \u03c3y and the transverse Oersted field; VDL,z is contributions of the dampinglike SOT field of \u03c3z (HDL,z), and VFL,z+Oe is contributions of the fieldlike SOT field of \u03c3z (HFL,z) and the asymmetric spreading current induced \ud835\udc3bz eff. Fits of the V2\u03c9 data to Eq. (4) yield the values of VDL,y+ANE , VFL,y+Oe, VDL,z, and VFL,z+Oe for the Pt 4/Co 1.7 at each magnitude of H (Figs. 5(b), and 5(e)). According to Eqs. (5)-(8), the slopes of the linear fits of VDL,y+ANE vs VAHE/2(Hk+H), VFL,y+Oe vs VPHE/2H, VDL,z vs VPHE/2H, VFL,z+Oe vs VAHE/2(Hk+H) give the values of HDL,y, \ud835\udc3by eff, HDL,z, and \ud835\udc3bz eff. Here, the anisotropy field of the in-plane magnetization, Hk, is estimated using the out-of-plane saturation field.\nAs we show in Figs. 5(c) and 5(f), the SOT fields for \u03c3y and \u03c3z are similar for the two contact configurations\n(HDL,y \u2248 15 Oe, HFL,y \u2248 -1.1 Oe, HDL,z \u2248 0), while \ud835\udc3bz eff is small (-1.7 \u00b1 1.3 Oe) in the nominally symmetric contact configuration and much larger (-6.0 \u00b1 0.9 Oe) in the more asymmetric configuration. The high sensitivity of \ud835\udc3bz eff to the contact configuration also unambiguously indicates that the \ud835\udc3bz eff in the Hall bars is an extrinsic current spreading effect rather than the fieldlike torque of \u03c3z. We expect that, similar to the ST-FMR case (Fig.\n4(a)), such asymmetric current spreading near the electrical contacts gets more significant for Hall bars that are\nwider and/or shorter than the ones in this study. As a result, angle-dependent HHVR measurements are required\nto reliably determine the SOT efficiencies. For instance, the measurement that records V2\u03c9 as a function of a swept in-plane field H along charge current direction (\u03c6 = 0o) would result in erroneous value of HDL,y because, as Eqs.(5) and (8) suggest, the second HHVR of \ud835\udc3bz eff and the dampinglike SOT of \u03c3y have the same form in the field dependence. The symmetric current shunting into the voltage detection arm pairs of Hall bars36 is not involved with the presence and the analysis of \ud835\udc3bz eff.\nExternal-magnetic-field-free switching of uniform perpendicular magnetization\nFinally, we demonstrate that the effective perpendicular magnetic field induced by asymmetric current\nspreading can enable external-magnetic-field-free current switching of perpendicular magnetization. As expected, in-plane current cannot switch a magnetic bilayer of Pt 5/FeTb 7.5 bilayer (Ms \u2248 350 emu/cm3, Hk \u2248 30 kOe, coercivity Hc \u2248 0.5 kOe) in absence of an assisting external magnetic field, in the configuration of Fig. 6(a) in which the asymmetric current spreading is weak (the current channel is 60 \u03bcm long and the current leads have\nsymmetric shapes). When the contact configuration is changed to a more asymmetric one, e.g., the one in Figs.\n6(b) and 6(c) (the current channel is 40 um long in Fig. 6(b) and 65 um long in Fig. 6(c) and the current leads have asymmetric shapes), in-plane current can switch the same Pt 5/FeTb 7.5 bilayer at current density of \u2248 1.8\u00d7107 A/cm2 without need of an external magnetic field. Here, since \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff is much smaller than the coercivity of the FeTb layer, the observed magnetization switching is driven mainly by the transverse spins generated by the spin Hall effect of Pt and assisted by \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 eff. While the deterministic magnetization switching of the Pt 5/FeTb 7.5 sample is not full yet (volume percentage of 20% or 30%) because some of the magnetic domains appear to be pinned\nmore firmly, a full switching is possible for samples with enhanced asymmetric current spreading and/or with\nreduced pinning field."

            "text": "We have shown that a perpendicular effective magnetic field can widely exist in magnetic micron devices\ndue to asymmetric current spreading and vary with the geometries of devices and measurements. This\nperpendicular effective field exhibits the characteristics that were widely assumed in the literature to \u201csignify\u201d the\npresence of \u03c3z, i.e., it can enable external-magnetic-field-free current switching of perpendicular magnetization, and make a sin2\u03c6 dependent contribution in the ST-FMR signal of in-plane magnetization and a \u03c6-independent\nbut field-dependent contribution in the second HHVR of in-plane magnetization. This implies that these\ncharacteristics are not reliable indication for perpendicular spins (\u03c3z) and that determination of SOTs of transverse spins (\u03c3y) from ST-FMR and HHVR analyses requires careful angle-dependent measurements, especially those on low-length/width-ratio magnetic strips and/or with asymmetric electrical contacts (e.g. 2-terminal ST-FMR\ndevices similar to that in Fig. 6(d)). Neglect of a significant current spreading causes incorrect conclusions about\nthe presence of \u03c3z and the strength and anisotropy of SOTs of \u03c3y from ST-FMR, HHVR, and magnetization switching analyses. This work also provides a unified solution to reliably measure SOTs of spin polarizations,\nregardless of the contact configurations, from careful angle dependent ST-FMR and HHVR measurements that have taken in account current spreading. Distinct from thickness-wedged samples37 and low-symmetry NbSe2 single crystal with anisotropic resistivity22, such perpendicular effective magnetic field induced by asymmetric\ncurrent spreading within uniform magnetic heterostructures provides a new, universally accessible mechanism for\nefficient, scalable and external-field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization in nonvolatile memory and\ncomputing technologies (see Fig. 6(e) for a possible integration scheme of a SOT-MRAM device with optimized\ncontact geometry to enhance the spreading Oersted field)."
