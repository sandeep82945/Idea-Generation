Exploration of Peptide Sequences and Amino Acid Compositions for Enhanced Oxidative Stability: Investigate the specific peptide sequences and amino acid compositions derived from different proteases besides trypsin and pepsin to understand their contribution to the oxidative stability of oils. This could involve using a variety of proteolytic enzymes to hydrolyze soy proteins and other plant-based proteins, followed by an analysis of their peptide profiles and antioxidant activities in oil and food systems.

Application of Soy Protein Hydrolysates in Various Food Systems: Extend the application of soy protein hydrolysates to other food systems beyond frying oils, such as baked goods, dairy products, and meat alternatives, to assess their potential in improving oxidative stability, shelf-life, and nutritional profiles. This could involve comparative studies of hydrolysate effectiveness in different food matrices and processing conditions.

Mechanistic Studies on the Antioxidant Action of Hydrolysates: Conduct in-depth mechanistic studies to understand how soy protein hydrolysates interact with lipid molecules and radical species at the molecular level. This could involve computational modeling and in vitro experiments to explore the dynamics of peptide-lipid interactions and the role of specific amino acids in scavenging free radicals and metal ions.

Development of Environmentally Friendly and Health-focused Antioxidants: Given the interest in replacing synthetic antioxidants with natural alternatives, further research could focus on optimizing the production, purification, and application of soy protein hydrolysates as natural antioxidants. This could include exploring sustainable extraction methods, evaluating the safety and efficacy of hydrolysates in food systems, and assessing consumer acceptance.

Comparative Analysis of Hydrolysates from Different Oilseed Proteins: Since the study focused on soy proteins, future research could explore the antioxidative potential of hydrolysates derived from other oilseed proteins, such as sunflower, canola, or hemp. This would involve a comparative analysis of their antioxidative activities, peptide compositions, and effectiveness in enhancing the oxidative stability of different types of oils and fats used in food processing and storage.
