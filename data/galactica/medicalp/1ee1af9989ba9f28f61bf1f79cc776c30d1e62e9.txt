conclusion These results indicate that after 65% HRR and 40 min of transient constant-load exercise, the plasma Hcy concentration first increased, and then the non-mercaptoalbumin/mercaptoalbumin ratio increased as the elevated state was maintained. We could establish a novel acute exercise model that increased plasma Hcy concentration and the blood non-mercaptoalbumin/mercaptoalbumin ratio. Since blood non-mercaptoalbumin is a systemic oxidative stress marker, it was found that acute exercise equivalent to 65% HRR for 40 min increased systemic oxidative stress. Transient exercise equivalent to 65% HRR is moderate intensity exercise, not high-intensity exercise. Specifically, it is inferred that the oxidative stress of the whole body increases without high-intensity exercise like that of an athlete, which may be clinically significant.
