1. Investigate the role of necdin in the development and function of the sympathetic nervous system in PWS using animal models and human studies.


2. Examine the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities in PWS, including insulin sensitivity, ghrelin levels, and body composition.


3. Explore the potential of vagus nerve stimulation as a treatment for autonomic dysfunction and associated symptoms in PWS.


4. Investigate the impact of growth hormone therapy on autonomic function and associated symptoms in children with PWS.


5. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the natural history of autonomic dysfunction in PWS and its impact on long-term health outcomes.
