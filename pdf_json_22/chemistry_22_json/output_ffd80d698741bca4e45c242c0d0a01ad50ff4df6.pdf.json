    "abstractText": "Ginseng (Panax ginseng) is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to Panax genus of Araliaceae. Ginsenosides are a kind of important compounds in ginseng and minor ginsenosides are secondary metabolic derivatives of ginsenosides. Studies have shown that minor ginsenosides have many pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-platelet aggregation, and neuroprotective effects. However, the therapeutic effects of minor ginsenosides are limited due to poor solubility in water, short halflife, and poor targeting accuracy. In recent years, to improve the application efficiency, the research on the nanocrystallization of minor ginsenosides have attracted extensive attention from researchers. This review focuses on the classification, preparation methods, pharmacological effects, and action mechanisms of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles, as well as existing problems and future direction of relevant research, which provides a reference for the in-depth research of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles.",

Ginsenosides are a kind of important compounds in ginseng and minor ginsenosides are secondary metabolic derivatives of ginsenosides. Studies have shown that minor ginsenosides have many pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-platelet aggregation, and neuroprotective effects. However, the therapeutic effects of minor ginsenosides are limited due to poor solubility in water, short halflife, and poor targeting accuracy. In recent years, to improve the application efficiency, the research on the nanocrystallization of minor ginsenosides have attracted extensive attention from researchers. This review focuses on the classification, preparation methods, pharmacological effects, and action mechanisms of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles, as well as existing problems and future direction of relevant research, which provides a reference for the in-depth research of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles.\nKEYWORDS\nminor ginsenosides, nanoparticles, preparation, pharmacological effects, action mechanism\n1 Introduction\nBelonging to Panax genus of Araliaceae, ginseng is a perennial herbaceous plant with fleshy roots. It is also a traditional precious herb, a tonic that can enhance physical vitality (Park et al., 2005), known as the \u201cking of herbs\u201d (He et al., 2019). Ginseng can be used for the treatment of several diseases effectively, such as liver and stomach diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, etc., so it is widely used in the world. Ginsenoside is a tetracyclic triterpenoid saponin extracted from ginseng (Li et al., 2009), and it is the main active ingredient of ginseng. In recent years, the pharmacological effects of ginsenosides have been continuously discovered. According to the literature, ginsenosides have clinical applications such as anti-allergy (Yoo et al., 2016) and reducing hypertension (Zhou et al., 2017). Minor ginsenosides are secondary metabolic derivatives of ginsenosides, and they are the most important active ingredient in ginsenosides. At present, more than 60 minor ginsenosides have been found (Liu et al., 2019), mainly including Rg3, Rg5, Rh1, Rh2, Compound K (CK), etc. It has been confirmed that minor ginsenosides are easier to be\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY Weicheng Hu, Huaiyin Normal University, China\nREVIEWED BY Enhui Zhang, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics (CAS), China Yu Huang, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China Lin Dai, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, China\n*CORRESPONDENCE Taoyun Wang, wangtaoyun@mail.usts.edu.cn Linmao Wang, wanglinmao12345@sina.com\nSPECIALTY SECTION This article was submitted to Experimental Pharmacology and Drug Discovery, a section of the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology\nRECEIVED 21 June 2022 ACCEPTED 11 July 2022 PUBLISHED 08 August 2022\nCITATION Ke Y, Huang L, Song Y, Liu Z, Liang L, Wang L and Wang T (2022), Preparation and pharmacological effects of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles: a review.

However, minor ginsenosides show low solubility in water, low bioavailability and short half-life (Ye et al., 2014), which restricts the pharmacological effects of minor ginsenosides to a certain extent.\nNanotechnology is a modern technology which controls the material structure in 0.1\u2013100 nm and makes the material show special properties (Kaehler, 1994). Professor Xu Bihui (Yang et al., 2000) took the lead in introducing nanotechnology into the field of traditional Chinese medicine and put forward the concept of \u201cnano traditional Chinese medicine\u201d. Based on the different forms of nanoparticles, nano-drugs can be divided into two types: one is nano-drug crystal, that is, the material itself is nanosized or crushed to nano size; the other one is nano-drug carrier, which carries drugs with the help of nanoscale carrier materials (Zheng and Shi, 2012). Nano-drugs improve the utilization rate of drugs, enhance the original curative effects and improve the targeting effect (Liu et al., 2014). Therefore, in recent years, to improve the pharmacological effects of minor ginsenosides, the research of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles has attracted extensive attention from researchers in related fields.\nFocusing on the current research hotspot of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles, this review summarizes the classification, preparation methods, pharmacological effects, and action mechanisms of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles, and provides a reference for the in-depth research of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles."

The disadvantage of \u201cTop-bottom\u201d technology is that reducing the particle size below 100 nm\nrequires much processing time and is not easy to expand production (Sinha et al., 2013). Xie et al. (2016) prepared minor ginsenoside Rg3 nanocrystals by high-pressure homogenization and precipitation. The minor ginsenoside Rg3 was dissolved in methanol as the organic phase, and poloxamer 188 was dissolved in purified water as the aqueous phase. The organic phase was added to the aqueous phase to prepare the crude suspension. The nanosuspension was obtained by circulating 4 times under the pressure of 28 MPa and 10 times under the pressure of 48 MPa through a high-pressure homogenizer. The suspension mixed with mannitol were prefrozen in an ultra-low temperature refrigerator, and then transferred into a freeze dryer for freeze-drying to obtain ginsenoside Rg3 nano freeze-dried powder. The prepared nanocrystals had a small particle size of (284 \u00b1 14) nm, an ideal polydispersity coefficient of 0.156 \u00b1 0.007 and good overall stability.

The results showed that Rh2 nanoparticles had good anticancer activity, and the anticancer ability was more effective with the decrease in particle size. This may be through endocytosis, which promotes the uptake of nano drugs by cancer cells and further leads to apoptosis. At the same time, X-ray diffraction showed that there were very few crystalline substances and no valuable diffraction peaks, indicating that Rh2 nanoparticles showed an amorphous shape after being treated by the ASES process. This situation may be due to the rapid precipitation in the process of ASES, which makes the drug form a metastable region, and then reduces the crystallinity of the drug. This transformation from crystalline state to amorphous state may reduce the water insolubility of drugs, improve the dissolution efficiency, and then improve the bioavailability. This may also be the reason for improved anticancer activity. (Figure 1)."

The\npharmacological effects of minor ginsenosides were significantly enhanced by the introduction of nano-drug carriers (Table 1). The typical feature of this kind of drug carriers is that it can carry out targeted delivery, and the action mechanism of its pharmacological effects can be classified into passive targeting and active targeting (Figure 2). Drugs of passive targeting type enter pathological sites through the intercellular space of the inner wall of blood vessels, and use the high enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to make drugs accumulate in tumor, inflammation and other pathological sites (Iyer et al., 2006), so that the required drug level in the blood can be maintained for a long time (Torchilin, 2010). The active targeting type mainly refers to the target site has some special receptors. The antibody specifically bound to it or some modification is carried out on the carrier, and the targeted ligand is linked to the surface of the carrier. Through the mutual recognition of the ligand and the receptor, a specific binding with the target is realized, and then the drug is released at a specific location (Dong et al., 2017). Nano drugs are engulfed by tumor or other pathological cell membrane invagination to form endocytosomes (Sahay et al., 2010), and then the drugs are released to achieve the therapeutic effect. The pharmacological activities and specific mechanisms are introduced according to different carrier types as follows."

The membrane stability of liposomes was improved by changing the thermodynamic parameters of bilayer phospholipids (Fukuda et al., 1985; Hong et al., 2020). Zhu et al. (2021) studied a minor ginsenoside Rg3-based liposomal system (Rg3-LPs). Rg3 was used to replace cholesterol in liposomes. Compared with cholesterol liposomes (C-LPs), Rg3-LPs improved the uptake and targeting of glioma spheres in vitro, and the anti-proliferation effect of paclitaxel-loaded Rg3-LPs on glioma cells was significantly stronger than that of paclitaxel loaded C-LPs. Hong et al. (2020) developed a new nanocarrier, the ginsenoside Rh2 liposome (Rh2-lipo), in which cholesterol was replaced by Rh2 and paclitaxel (PTX). The results showed that compared with ordinary liposomes, Rh2-lipo loaded with PTX could significantly inhibit tumor growth and reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor microenvironment (TME).\nTME is still the main challenge of drug therapy. Data show that some immune cells have immunosuppressive properties, which lead to the production of cancer stem cells and promote the proliferation of cancer cells, thus reducing the efficacy of drugs (Arneth, 2019). Minor ginsenosides themselves have excellent antitumor and anticancer activities, and some also show good immunomodulatory effects in reshaping the TME. Therefore, the combination of TME remodeling ability and\nsmaller particle size improves its tumor penetration effect and uptake rate (Zhu et al., 2021). At the same time, the interaction between glucose transporters of tumor cells and minor ginsenosides significantly increases the accumulation of liposomes in tumors. After endocytosis, nanoparticles can be separated from lysosomes, so that drugs can be released and take effect in the cytoplasm (Figure 3)."

The results showed that compared with unencapsulated drugs, encapsulated drugs enhanced intestinal cell uptake and\noral utilization.

The hydrophobic core is used as the natural carrier for encapsulating hydrophobic drugs, while the hydrophilic shell stabilizes the particles in aqueous solution (Nasongkla et al., 2006) (Figure 4). Zhang et al. (2020) prepared micelles loaded with minor ginsenoside CK (APD-CK) with A54 peptide. Compared with CK alone, polymer micelles have enhanced antiproliferative effects on Huh-7 cells and HepG2 cells, and have better anticancer effects. This may because the A54 is a hepatoma-specific binding peptide, it can help the modified drugloaded nanosystem specifically target hepatoma cells through cell surface receptors and be absorbed by these cells quickly. The release of CK in micelles is pH-dependent, which may be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between polymercarriers and hydrophobic drugs. The sustained release may be due to the gradual separation of CK from the micellar carrier and release into the solution. And this prolongs the time of the drug in the blood, which is conducive to the targeted release and improves the bioavailability of minor ginsenosides."

Qiu et al. (2019) prepared self-assembled polymer nanoparticles of poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (L-glutamic acid-co-L-phenylalanine) [mPEG-b-P (Glu-coPhe)]. Then the minor ginsenoside Rg3 was encapsulated into it to form mPEG-b-P (Glu-co-Phe) nanoparticles (Rg3-NPs). Compared with free Rg3, Rg3-NPs are more cytotoxic to colon cancer cells and can effectively inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. The mechanism is that nanoparticles enter cells through endocytosis, and there is electrostatic interaction between drugs\nand polymers. The increase of acidity in the TME destroys the electrostatic interaction, which is conducive to the release of more drugs, enhancing the accumulation of drugs in tumors and achieving the effect of treating tumor cells (Lv et al., 2013). It is reported that the particle size of 100 nm is an appropriate particle size for selective accumulation in the tumor through EPR effect (Linqiang Xu et al., 2015). And it leads to apoptosis by enhancing the expression of caspase-3 (Figure 5)."

The results showed that the prepared nanoparticles had uniform particle size distribution and good dispersion, and showed a significant anti-proliferation effect on HepG2 cells. This may be because the release of CK is pH-dependent, and CK release is significantly enhanced in a slightly acidic environment. CK-NPs may be absorbed by cells through endocytosis, and the encapsulated drugs are released in a slightly acidic environment, increasing the absorption of drugs by HepG2 cells. At pH 7.4, it will reduce the release, to decrease the toxic and side effects on normal tissues."

It is reported that as a drug carrier, gold nanoparticles can increase the absorption of drugs by tumor tissues stimulated by hyperthermia (Zhang et al., 2016). Nanoparticles bind to cells through endocytosis. And because the surface is cationic, nanoparticles can gather on the anionic surface of cancer cells. After photoinduced hyperthermia, they can quickly induce cell lysis and release the curative effect (Figure 7)."

The anti-inflammatory effect was better in RAW264.7 cells. This may be because MSNPs are essentially immune to hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation, which can protect drugs from early release before reaching the point of action (Tang et al., 2012). Moreover, MSNPs have nanoscale pores, and the diameter of most enzymes is much larger than their pores, which prevents the entry of many enzymes, thus protecting the drugs from being hydrolyzed prematurely (Heidegger et al., 2016). Combined with its high drug loading, the curative effect of the drug is enhanced."

One is to use strong acid oxidation, and the other one is to react with amino acid derivatives and aldehydes to add solubilized parts around the outer surface. Functionalized carbon nanotubes can be connected to a variety of active molecules (Bianco et al., 2005). Luo et al.\n(2021) combined the minor ginsenoside Rg3 with CNT to obtain the conjugate CNT-loaded Rg3 (Rg3-CNT). Nitric acid and sulfuric acid were mixed to functionalize CNT. This method reduced the length, produced carboxyl groups and increased the dispersion in aqueous solution (Liu et al., 1998) (Figure 9). The results showed that the anti-cancer activity was enhanced compared with free Rg3. The reason is that Rg3CNT can reduce the expression of PD-1 in activated T cells, thereby enhancing the anti-cancer effect of Rg3 on triplenegative breast cancer. Many experiments have proved that diverse mammalian cells absorb CNT or its conjugates, and CNT can overcome the cell barrier (Shi Kam et al., 2004), CNT-loaded glycopolymer can target breast cancer (Ozgen et al., 2020), so the enhancement of anticancer activity may be because CNT overcomes the cell barrier to release drugs in cells."

The results showed that the functionalization of Gr composite Rh2, positively charged amino acids lysine and Gr showed higher antitumor activity. Compared with pure graphene, it reduces the toxicity to the coagulation system and heart tissue.\nThis may be due to the synergistic effect of minor ginsenoside and graphene, which show better antitumor effect and cytotoxic activity. In addition, there is stronger electrostatic absorption and interaction between positively charged amino acids and negative charged amino acids on certain biological surfaces and cancer cells, which may also be responsible for the enhanced biological activity.\nFIGURE 9 Functional principle of carbon nanotubes (Bianco et al., 2005).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11"

Lee et al.

The results showed that compared with HACE alone, the composite nanocarrier had higher cell uptake rate and enhanced circulation time in the blood stream. This may be due to the fact that lipid vesicles can bind to the cell surface and their lipid parts can fuse with the cell membrane, thus improving the cell uptake rate. The lipid fraction also provides spatial stability, thereby prolonging circulation in the blood stream. Therefore, composite nanocarriers can become a superior choice for drug delivery."

            "text": "Minor ginsenosides have attracted the attention of researchers due to their various pharmacological activities. However, because of poor water solubility and stability, the efficacy cannot be well guaranteed, which limits the clinical application. Nanocrystallization of minor ginsenosides can well solve this problem. At present, relevant researchers have explored and practiced in the preparation methods, pharmacological effects and mechanism of minor ginsenosides nanocrystallization, which provides a reference for the clinical application of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles.\nCompared with nanocarriers, nanocrystals have the advantages of high drug load, simple preparation methods\nand not restricted by carrier materials. The preparation difficulty of nanocrystals is closely related to the choice of preparation methods and physicochemical properties of drugs. However, it is still difficult to shorten the preparation time and improve the stability of nanocrystals. The key factors affecting the preparation of nanocrystals and the content of targeted drug delivery need to be further studied. Compared with nanocrystals, nanocarriers can achieve targeted release and protect drugs from early release before reaching the endpoint. But there are also some shortcomings. In the preparation process, the research and development of nanocarrier technology requirements are high, and the preparation process is complex. The process is greatly affected by equipment, operating conditions, raw materials and process parameters. The subtle changes in the manufacturing process can cause large changes in the final product quality, resulting in high uncertainty and poor reproducibility in production. The tissue specificity of the targeted drug is not high, and most experiments are conducted in vitro, and intracorporeal environment is not easy to be detected. So the development of core technology of nano medicine needs to be further broken.\nIn summary, some achievements have been made in the research of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles. However, the research on the targeted release, mechanism and optimization of preparation of minor ginsenoside nanoparticles needs to be further strengthened. It is necessary to further explore the pharmacokinetics in vivo and pre-clinical safety evaluation and management of minor ginsenoside nano-drugs, in addition, to evaluate the side effects and adverse reactions of minor ginsenoside nano-drugs to patients and promote the clinical application of nano minor ginsenoside drugs. The development and improvement of new dosage forms of minor ginsenosides show great potential in minor ginsenoside drug treatment.\nAuthor contributions\nTW and LW contributed to design of the study.
