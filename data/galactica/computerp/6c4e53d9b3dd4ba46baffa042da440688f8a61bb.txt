conclusions and discussions In this paper, we present RMMDet, a road-side multitype and multigroup sensor detection system for autonomous driving, for more intelligent vehicle-road collaboration. RMMDet uses a virtual simulation counterpart based on ROS, implementing three types sensors detection and lidar-camera, radar-camera fusion detection in the complex traffic scene. Real-time multimodal data streams are captured, processed, fed into model and generate the desired results to construct an end-to-end efficient roadside system. For the detection algorithms, we initially choose YOLOv4 and pointpillars, which could be replaced by any other methods and itâ€™s convenient for further research and experiments. And we link a lightweight scheduling system to showcase the functionality. In general, RMMDet presents an early attempt to build a comprehensive roadside system virtually and actually for autonomous driving. This is a long-line work and we will keep on it.
