            "text": "The observational study of quasars took off rapidly from the back-to-back-to-back papers of Nature\u2019s 16 March 1963 issue, which featured the redshift determinations for 3C 273 and 3C 48 (Schmidt 1963; Oke 1963; Greenstein 1963). Barely two years later, the quasar 3C 9 became the first known object at a redshift greater than 2 (Schmidt 1965). But as exemplified by the 5-magnitude difference in the optical brightness between 3C 273 and 3C 9, the exploration towards higher redshifts became a push to fainter magnitudes.\nFortunately, the early recognition of radio-quiet quasars becoming prominent amongst blue, star-like objects beyond a magnitude of V = 14.5 (Vega) provided an efficient means of identifying quasars from photometric techniques (Sandage 1965) and known quasars now number in the hundreds of thousands (see, e.g., the Million Quasar Catalogue, v7.5, hereafter Milliquas; Flesch 2021). Despite the proliferation of wide-area surveys across a range of wavelengths over the intervening fifty years, the search for bright quasars remains unfinished.\nHere, we report on a spectroscopic investigation of a bright, blue, point-like source selected from the SkyMapper Southern Survey Data Release 2 (SMSS DR2; Wolf et al. 2018b; Onken et al. 2019), which demonstrates that SMSS J114447.77430859.3 (SMSS DR2 object_ida 84280208; hereafter, J1144) is a z = 0.83 quasar. Aside from one blazar object at z = 0.6 (PKS 1424+240), this makes J1144 the optically brightest quasar known above a redshift of 0.4.\nSpectroscopy of J1144 was first acquired during a search for symbiotic binaries, in which cool giant stars accrete onto smaller companions, using SMSS DR2 (Lucy 2021). While any known active galactic nucleus (AGN, as identified in SIMBAD; Wenger et al. 2000) was excluded, J1144 had only been identified as an AGN candidate by its near-IR and IR colours. It was identified as a candidate by Edelson & Malkan (2012) using the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010; Mainzer et al. 2011). Similarly, Secrest\naThe name and object_id remain the same in SMSS DR3.\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n04 20\n4v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\net al. (2015) utilised the AllWISEb update to the IR dataset and selected J1144 as a quasar candidate from its IR colours alone. Notably, Shu et al. (2019) even estimated a photometric redshift for J1144 of z = 0.82 from DR2 of the Gaia satellite mission (Gaia Collaboration & et al. 2016; Gaia Collaboration 2018) and the unWISE (Schlafly et al. 2019) revision to the photometry from WISE.\nHowever, the WISE colours of symbiotic stars sometimes fall in typical AGN selection regimes, which is why such sources were not excluded from the symbiotic star search. In fact, the flickering, accretion-powered symbiotic star EF Aql has an AGN-like (W1 \u2013 W2) \u2248 0.9 colour and was discovered via the UV-bright Quasar Survey (UVQS; Monroe et al. 2016; Margon et al. 2016; Zamanov et al. 2017). Lucy (2021) explored various SMSS selection mechanisms for different types of symbiotic stars, and J1144, being much bluer than most isolated cool giant stars, was caught by a (u \u2013 g)/(u \u2013 v) colouronly selection. Thus, along with 232 other symbiotic star candidates, optical spectroscopy of J1144 was obtained with the goal of confirming the presence of a cool giant star with emission lines, indicative of symbiotic binarity. J1144 was the only observed source to show AGN emission lines.\nIn \u00a7 2, we describe the observations and data processing. In \u00a7 3, we analyse the spectroscopic data and estimate the mass of the central black hole (BH). We summarise additional data available for J1144 in \u00a7 4 and compare J1144 to other bright quasars in \u00a7 5. \u00a7 6 discusses the outlook to further study and utilisation of J1144, as well as the prospects for additional such discoveries in the future. Throughout the paper, we use Vega magnitudes for Gaia and IR data, and AB magnitudes for the SkyMapper passbands: uvgriz. We adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmology with \u2126m = 0.3 and a Hubble-Lema\u00eetre constant of H0 = 70 km sec\u20131 Mpc\u20131."

Following the initial classification of J1144 as an AGN, additional optical spectroscopic data was obtained at higher spectral resolution with the Australian National University (ANU) 2.3-meter telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) using the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS; Dopita et al. 2007, 2010), and near-IR spectroscopy was obtained with the TripleSpec4.1 instrument (Schlawin et al. 2014) on the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) 4.1-meter telescope."

This involves the g, r, and i bands from SMSS DR3 and the 2MASS H-band for the near-IR spectrum.

The strong emission lines in the J1144 spectrum (Mg II, H\u03b2, H\u03b1, and Pa\u03b2) were used together (weighted mean) to provide a redshift estimate of 0.8314\u00b10.0001. The observed spectrum is then transformed to rest-frame wavelengths and to luminosity in units of erg s\u20131 \u00c5\u20131, giving a velocity resolution of 109 km s\u20131 pixel\u20131 and a final S/N between 100 and 250 per pixel. The combined spectrum is shown in Figure 1.\nWhen fitting the spectrum, we separately consider the wavelength regimes around C III], Mg II, H\u03b2, H\u03b1, and Pa\u03b2. For each wavelength region, we first fit a combined power-law continuum and iron template. The best power-law slope for the combined UV/optical range is found to be \u03b1\u03bb = \u20131.56, although a flatter slope of -0.79 is a better fit for the near-IR, likely reflecting the contributions of hot dust in the region longward of 1 \u00b5m (cf. the WISE photometry in Fig. 4). Because of the impact of the iron model on the remaining emission line profiles, we test the systematic effects of adopting various iron emission templates in the UV and optical portions of the spectrum. For the UV iron templates, we use those of Shen & Liu (2012, ; implementing a combination of Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001), Tsuzuki et al. (2006), and Salviander et al. (2007)), Tsuzuki et al. (2006), and Mej\u00eda-Restrepo et al. (2016), while for the optical templates, we use those of Boroson & Green(1992; BG92, hereafter), Tsuzuki et al. (2006), Bruh-\n0.121\u00b1 0.004 mag. Schr\u00f6der et al. (2021) also suggest retaining the rescaling factor of 0.86.\nweiler & Verner (2008), and Park et al. (2022). The velocity broadening of the template is a free parameter in each fit. On average, the best-fit iron full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was \u223c 2500 km s\u20131. The systematic errors arising from the iron template choice are square-added to the statistical errors in the fit results below.\nFor the subsequent steps of the spectral modelling, the emission lines are each fit with a sum of three Gaussian profiles. We estimate the statistical uncertainties on the fit parameters via a Monte Carlo approach, taking the RMS from 50 realisations in which the flux at each pixel is varied according to the error spectrum. Because of the weak [O III] and [S II] emission and lack of evident narrow-line contribution to the Balmer lines, even in the original R \u223c 7000 spectrum of H\u03b2, no narrowline subtraction is performed for the Balmer lines or the [N II] lines near H\u03b1. Integrating 3\u00d7 the error spectrum over spectral windows of \u00b1200 km s\u20131 around [O III] 5007 \u00c5 and [S II] 6716 + 6731 \u00c5 provides conservative upper limits of 5 \u00d7 1042 and 3 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u20131, respectively; however, the blending of H\u03b1 with [N II] precludes a similar upper limit estimate for the latter.\nThe emission line fits are shown in Figure 2. The C III] fit is poorly constrained, because of limited wavelength coverage, the lower spectral resolution of the SAAO data from which it is principally observed, and lack of de-blending with Al III and Si III]. As a result, the parameters are omitted from Table 1. The features redward of H\u03b2 are likely iron lines that have not been well modelled because of errors in the flux calibration at the long-wavelength limit of the optical spectra.\nFrom the sum of the Gaussian fits, we determine the velocity shift (derived from the peak of the line profile), the integrated line luminosity, the FWHM, and the second moment of the line profile (\u03c3line). The emission line properties are summarised in Table 1. As was the case for the continuum luminosities, the emission line luminosity errors are dominated by the photometric calibration uncertainties."

The luminosity at 3000 \u00c5 translates into an absolute magnitude of M300nm = \u201328.70 mag (AB). To aid comparison with higherredshift samples, we extrapolate the best-fit continuum powerlaw (with \u03b1\u03bb = \u20131.56) to shorter wavelengths and find log10 ( \u03bbL\u03bb(1450\u00c5) / erg s\u20131 ) = 47.2 or M145nm = \u201328.36 mag (AB). Using the prescription of Richards et al. (2006), we find Mi(z = 2) = \u201329.74 mag (AB).\nWe adopt the bolometric correction (BC) for 3000 \u00c5 from Runnoe et al. (2012b,a), although their BC values for 5100 \u00c5 (with spectral slope correction) or the BC values from Netzer (2019) yield similar results. The bolometric luminosity of J1144 is (4.7 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 1047 erg s\u20131, where the uncertainty accounts for the variation arising from different BC assumptions. For the canonical radiative efficiency of 0.1 (e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2002), this equates to an accretion rate of \u223c 80 M yr\u20131."

Anchored to the H\u03b2 reverberation mapping results from the local AGN sample (see Peterson et al. 2004), the virial relations rely on a single epoch of line width and luminosity measurements to infer the velocity of the BLR gas around the BH, as well as the characteristic distance from the BH to the line-emitting gas in question (see, e.g., Cackett et al. 2021, and references therein). Each emission line may have its own velocity and distance, which should yield consistent mass estimates under the assumption that the gravity of the BH dominates the gas dynamics.

(2020), the A parameters in Table 2 have been renormalised to that paper\u2019s adopted virial factor of f = 1.12 (from Woo et al. 2015) for these FWHM-based measurements.\nWith the emission line measurements of Table 1 and the continuum luminosities indicated above, we derive several complementary BH mass estimates. The MBH values we estimate are presented in Table 3. For Mg II, we do not apply the mass correction factors from Le et al. (2020) for the emission line shape (FWHM/\u03c3line ratio) and spectral slope, which would increase that mass estimate by 0.3 dex and make it more discrepant with the other emission line results. The different emission lines produce BH mass estimates that span the range from (1.9 \u2013 3.8)\u00d7 109 M . The high S/N of our spectroscopic data mean the statistical errors on the BH mass estimate are small compared to the systematic errors. Dalla Bont\u00e0 et al.\n(2020) estimate the intrinsic scatter to be 0.371 dex for the best-measured FWHM-based virial relation (using H\u03b2 and 5100 \u00c5), and the systematic errors for the other estimates are likely to be larger. Thus, we take the mean value of our five measurements as the best estimate for the BH mass in J1144, MBH = 2.6\u00d7109 M , and conservatively adopt an uncertainty of 0.5 dex (cf. Vestergaard & Osmer 2009). Our measurements of the bolometric luminosity and BH mass yield an Eddington ratio of \u2248 1.4 for J1144.\nIn Table 4, we present a summary of the observed and derived properties of J1144."

            "text": "Typical thin disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) and slim disk (Abramowicz et al. 1988) models of BH accretion predict UV/optical continuum emission having a power-law slope of \u03b1\u03bb \u2248 \u20132.3 (\u03b1\u03bd \u2248 +0.3), though real quasars are rarely observed to be so blue (Xie et al. 2016). Taking such a spectral slope as the limiting case, we can assess the maximum amount of internal reddening that may be present in the emitted spectrum of J1144.\nFor a UV-flat reddening curve like that of Gaskell & Benker (2007, GB07, hereafter), we find that a maximum intrinsic E(B-V) of 0.17 mag provides a reasonable fit to the\ndata. In contrast, a UV-steep reddening curve \u2013 one lacking the strong bump at 2175 \u00c5 \u2013 such as the Gordon et al. (2003) model for the star-forming bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud, implies a maximum E(B-V) of 0.10 mag to avoid over-correcting C III], but then under-corrects the spectrum near Mg II. (Reddening curves retaining the 2175 \u00c5 bump perform even worse in the regime between C III] and Mg II.) The GB07 reddening correction would lift the 3000 \u00c5 luminosity by 0.34 dex, which might be expected to increase each of the BH mass and the Eddington ratio by roughly half that margin. However, because the sources anchoring the virial relations have not been corrected for internal reddening, the appropriate adjustments for J1144 would be reduced in\namplitude. It is also worth highlighting that the power-law prescription for the rest-frame UV spectrum breaks down in accretion disk models at higher BH masses, as the high-energy turnover migrates to longer wavelengths (e.g., see Campitiello et al. 2018). For MBH \u223c 109 M , the departure from a power-law exceeds 0.1 magnitudes between 2000 and 3000 \u00c5, suggesting extreme care must be taken to disentangle the intrinsic spectral shape from any internal reddening. Observed-frame UV spectroscopy of J1144 should contribute to our ability to remove such degeneracies.\nFinally, reddening will lead to an enhancement of the Balmer decrement, i.e., the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio. Low-redshift quasars with blue spectral slopes (implying little intrinsic reddening) are often found to have Balmer decrements of 3.1 (Dong et al. 2008). Our observed Balmer decrement of 5.1 would imply E(B-V) \u2248 0.4 mag, depending on the reddening curve adopted. However, Gaskell (2017) has argued that quasar Balmer decrements are consistent with an assumption of intrinsic Case B recombination and a flux ratio of 2.72, which would suggest even more reddening in J1144: E(B-V) \u2248 0.5 mag. In either case, such high reddening appears to be incompatible with the expected spectral slopes, suggesting an intrinsically higher Balmer decrement, which can arise from optical depth effects redistributing H\u03b2 photons into H\u03b1 and Pa\u03b1 (Pottasch 1960; Netzer 1975)."

The photographic glass plate (b5269) has been digitised, and astrometrically and photometrically calibrated by the Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) projecti (Laycock et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2013). The brightness of J1144 in the 1890 image is estimated to be 14.80\u00b1 0.16 mag (AB), calibrated to Pan-STARRS g-band using the Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) All-Sky Stellar Reference Catalog (Tonry et al. 2018a). Similar plates available through DASCH from more recent epochs show J1144 with estimated g-band magnitudes between 13.9 and 15.1 mag (AB; omitting highly uncertain measurements or those close to the plate\u2019s limiting depth). The heterogeneity of the data precludes a more detailed analysis, but the DASCH photographic archives indicate that the optical brightness of J1144 has not varied by more than a factor of \u223c 2 in the last 130 years.\nConsidering data focused on the blue end of the optical spectrum, photographic glass plates taken by the UK Schmidt telescope at SSO on UT 1977-03-21, as part of the ESO/SERC\niSee https://library.cfa.harvard.edu/dasch.\nSouthern Sky Survey, measured BJ = 14.7 \u00b1 0.4 mag (Vega), as cataloguedj by the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (Hambly et al. 2001b,a). The BJ and SMSS g bandpasses are similar (e.g., see the BJ throughput compared to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey gSDSS in Richards et al. 2005) and the (BJ \u2013 g) colours of 3673 quasars in the redshift range 0.6\u20131.0 from the 2dF and 6dF QSO Redshift Surveys (2QZ/6QZ; Croom et al. 2004) show a median of 0.10 mag with a scaled median absolute deviation (SMAD) of 0.38 mag. With an SMSS DR3 g-band magnitude of 14.534 \u00b1 0.014 mag (AB), we conclude there has been no significant variation in the J1144 brightness at rest-frame \u223c 2700 \u00c5 compared to 45 years ago.\nOn more recent timescales, the SMSS DR3 dataset incorporates images of J1144 acquired between February 2015 and June 2018. Across that time window, each of the six SMSS filters shows a brightening of \u2248 0.1 mag, with 7 \u2013 9 epochs per filter. Denser time sampling is available from the ATLAS telescopes (Tonry et al. 2018b; Smith et al. 2020), which have observed J1144 at a high rate (typically over 200 times per year) since December 2017k. Both the o (\"orange\"; comprising 80% of the data) and c (\"cyan\") filters show a brightening of 0.2 mag relative to the earliest ATLAS epoch (January 2016), with a peak roughly in May 2020. Together, these datasets provide a consistent picture of modest brightness variations over timescales of days to years.\nTo probe even shorter timescales, we examined the J1144 data available from two \u223cmonth-long visits by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2015), one beginning on UT 2019-03-26 (during the primary mission; Sector 10) and one beginning on 2021-04-02 (first extended mission; Sector 37). In the TESS Input Catalog (TIC; Paegert et al. 2022), J1144 has the designation TIC 61537875, but it was not selected for the Candidate Target List. As a result, photometry is only available from the Full Frame Image (FFI) dataset, which were acquired every 30 minutes in the primary mission and every 10 minutes in the first extended mission. The coarse spatial resolution of TESS results in J1144 being heavily blended with TIC 61537878, a star 30 arcsec away that is \u223c 1 mag brighter in TESS\u2019s wide bandpass (600 \u2013 1000 nm). As a result, precise photometry is difficult to obtain, but we note no significant fluctuations above 1% in the combined light curve of the quasar and star."

At rest-frame equivalents of 1.8 and 2.5 \u00b5m for W1 and W2, respectively, the WISE data is dominated by the hot dust near the quasar, rather than the quasar\u2019s accretion disk that is probed at shorter wavelengths. In Figure 3, we show the WISE and ATLAS light curves, binned to 30-day median values.\njSee http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/index.html. kSee https://fallingstar-data.com/forcedphot/. lSee https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/.\nIn contrast to the ATLAS photometry, J1144 exhibits a very slight fading in both IR bands over that time period, with an amplitude of \u223c 0.05 mag, comparable to the level of intraday photometric scatter. This uncorrelated behaviour can be understood in the context of the multi-year time lags for dust reverberation that would be expected from the large dust sublimation radius implied by the high luminosity of J1144. For the luminosity of J1144 (1.2 \u00d7 1014 L ), the predicted time lag for the IR response to optical variations would be 9.7 years (Lyu et al. 2019), slightly longer than the time span shown in Figure 3. Thus, the steadiness of the IR photometry since the start of WISE operations implies no significant and lengthy changes in the quasar luminosity over the past \u223c20 years.\nAs the recent increase in luminosity shown by the ATLAS light curves propagates into the dust surrounding the quasar, we could expect to see the IR similarly brighten within the next decade. However, the relative amplitude of IR variability in response to optical fluctuations is extremely broad, between factors of 0.1 and 10 for high-luminosity, high-time-lag sources (Lyu et al. 2019, cf. their Fig. 14). Future monitoring by WISE and the Dynamic REd All-sky Monitoring Survey (DREAMS; Soon et al. 2020) may reveal the amplitude of the dust response in J1144."

To check for a small-separation galaxy lens, we examine the corrected BP and RP flux excess, C\u2217, from Gaia EDR3 (Riello et al. 2021), which makes a standardised comparison between the flux measured in the 0.35-arcsec-wide G-band photometric aperture with the integrated fluxes measured in the 3.5-arcsec-wide apertures for the BP and RP photometry (integrating along the wavelength dimension of the low-resolution spectra). With C\u2217 = 0.023, the variation in flux measured by the different extraction apertures for the Gaia photometry is within 2\u03c3 of the 0-value expected for point sources of the brightness of J1144 (where \u03c3 = 0.012).

Moreover, the presence of the strong radio jet, with synchrotron emission that extends into the optical regime, has opened a window into the relatively rare class of radio-loud quasars (e.g., Bahcall et al. 1995; Jester et al. 2005; Uchiyama et al. 2006).\nIn Figure 4, we compare the rest-frame UV-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED) of J1144 from recent data to the minimum and maximum luminosities of 3C 273 (including synchrotron flares), as observed over a 40-year spanp (T\u00fcrler et al. 1999; Soldi et al. 2008), as well as to SMSS J2157-3602, the most luminous known quasar in the Universe, at a redshift of z = 4.692 (Wolf et al. 2018a; Onken et al. 2020). The J1144 SED is derived from a subset of the photometry presented in Table 4, namely, that of SMSS DR3 (u, v, g, r, i, z), 2MASS (J , H, K)q, and AllWISE (W1, W2, W3, W4). The photometry in Figure 4 was corrected for Galactic extinction up to an observed-frame wavelength of 3 \u00b5m using the Fitzpatrick et al. (2019) extinction curve, a standard RV=3.1 Milky Way dust model, and the Schlegel et al. (1998) E(B-V) values of 0.123, 0.021, and 0.015 mag for J1144, 3C 273, and SMSS J2157, respectively, with the \u00d70.86 correction factor of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). As with the spectroscopic calibration above, the bandpass details were retrieved from the SVO. The SMSS u- and v-band photometry were also corrected with the stellarcolour regression method of Huang et al. (2021), which makes them 0.088 and 0.069 mag fainter, respectively. (The corrections for g- and r-band are less than 0.01 mag and are therefore omitted.)\nAcross the entire observed UV/optical range, J1144 has an intrinsic luminosity that is roughly 8 times greater than the brightest observations of 3C 273, and only about 3 times\npData retrieved from the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre (ISDC): http: //isdc.unige.ch/3c273/.\nqThe J and Ks photometry available from DR6 of the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (McMahon et al. 2013) is little different from the 2MASS data of \u223c 20 years earlier.\nless than the most luminous quasar known. Even with the occasional synchrotron flares elevating the peak luminosities of 3C 273 in the IR, the blazar has remained \u223c 5\u00d7 less luminous than J1144. The inset in Figure 4 includes the maximum potential radio luminosity observed for J1144, on the assumption of the RACS DR1 detection being associated with the quasar, illustrating the dramatic difference in the long-wavelength SED of radio-quiet quasars compared to radio-loud sources such as 3C 273.\nIn Figure 4, we also show three SED templatesr (Lyu et al. 2017) exhibiting different mid-IR dust properties. The \"Normal SED\" represents the typical broad-line quasar SED, while the hot-dust-deficient (HDD) and warm-dust-deficient (WDD) templates show reduced emission at shorter and longer mid-IR wavelengths, respectively. With the templates anchored to match the J1144 SED near 1 \u00b5m, the WISE photometry suggests that J1144 is an intermediate case and may be somewhat lacking in dust close to the quasar.\nIn addition, we note the similarity between the optical spectra of J1144 (Fig. 1 and 2) and 3C 273 (Dietrich et al. 1999), with prominent Balmer lines and comparatively weak [O III] emission, suggesting a commonality in their central engines despite the differences in their radio properties. Compared to the sample of bright quasars analysed by BG92, J1144 is on the strong Fe II-weak [O III] end of their \"Eigenvector 1\" correlation, although the Fe II equivalent widths (EW) of \u223c 40 \u00c5 is typical of radio-quiet quasars. The ratio of Fe II-to-H\u03b2 EWs of 1.5 is at the high end of their distribution, but J1144 does not exhibit the enhanced blue H\u03b2 asymmetry often seen for such sources.\nIn Figure 5, we compare the J1144 bolometric luminosity estimated in Section 3.1 to 3C 273, SMSS J2157, and a large number of quasars, drawn from either the SDSS DR14 quasar catalogue (DR14Q; Rakshit et al. 2020) or Milliquas, as a function of lookback time. In order to use a consistent bolometric correction, we estimate the continuum luminosities at 3000 \u00c5 for the literature sources. For 3C 273, we use the mean U-band flux from the 40-year dataset of the ISDC. DR14Q values use the 3000 \u00c5 luminosity tabulated in the catalogue, or, at higher or lower redshifts, respectively, estimate log10 ( \u03bbL\u03bb(3000) ) from the 1350 \u00c5 luminosity as 4.887 + 0.89 log10 ( \u03bbL\u03bb(1350) ) or from the 5100 \u00c5 luminosity as 9.213 + 0.792 log10 ( \u03bbL\u03bb(5100) ), based on the best-fit relations from the DR14Q sources having both luminosities estimated. Sources with non-zero QUALITY_L3000 values were excluded.

With an extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 14.059 mag (AB), J1144 is nearly 1 full magnitude brighter than the SDSS cutoff at iSDSS = 15 mag (AB) and nearly 1.5 mag brighter in Mi(z = 2) than any source actually found in the SDSS DR3 quasar luminosity function at redshifts below z = 0.9 (Richards et al. 2006)."

Utilising \u223c 3, 000 known quasars from Milliquas in the same redshift range as J1144, for which both GALEX and Gaia photometry exist, we use the FUV \u2013 G and NUV \u2013 G colours to predict J1144 to have (FUV , NUV) = (17, 16) mag (AB), with uncertainties of roughly 1 mag in each band. With FUV = 17 mag (AB), J1144 would have been amongst the top 10% of the brightest discoveries by UVQS DR1, but at a redshift 0.2 higher than the rest.\nThe high luminosity of J1144 also implies a large size for its BLR. Extrapolating the radius\u2013luminosity relation of Bentz et al. (2013) to the 5100 \u00c5 luminosity of J1144 suggests an H\u03b2-emitting size of \u223c 1200 light-days. With the additional time-dilation factor of \u223c 2, a reverberation mapping campaign would be a long-term endeavour. However, the angular size of the BLR is expected to be in excess of 100 microarcseconds. Since J1144 has a K-band magnitude of 11.9 mag (Vega), its BLR will be well within the reach of the upgraded GRAVITY+ instrumentu at ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescopes. Thus, it may be possible to measure the Pa\u03b2 dynamics in J1144, comparable to the Pa\u03b1 measurement for 3C 273 (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018).\nAdditional studies may make productive use of an exceptionally bright quasar like J1144 as a background source. For example, UV spectroscopy of J1144 may probe the Milky Way\u2019s circumgalactic medium (Tumlinson et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2019; Bish et al. 2021).\nPrevious searches for quasars and other blue objects in the Southern hemisphere have usually not reached as close to the Galactic Plane as J1144, which lies at b = +18.1\u25e6. For example, the Edinburgh-Cape Blue Object Survey (Stobie et al. 1997; Kilkenny et al. 2016) was restricted to |b| > 30\u25e6; the Hamburg/ESO quasar survey (Wisotzki et al. 1996, 2000) searched at |b| > 25\u25e6; and the Cal\u00e1n-Tololo Survey (Maza et al. 1988, 1996) observed to |b| > 20\u25e6. Dedicated quasar searches closer to the Galactic Plane (e.g., Im et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2021) may produce samples of objects useful both in their own right and for studies of the gas and dust near the Galactic disk.\nMoreover, the discovery power inherent in the recent generation of all-sky surveys like those of Gaia, WISE, and\nuSee https://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/gravityplus.\neROSITA motivate a fresh examination of what other bright quasars may have been missed in previous searches across the celestial sphere. A spectroscopic campaign underway at the ANU 2.3m telescope has already identified \u223c 80 new, bright quasars (in addition to J1144), some with Galactic latitudes in excess of 60 deg. Thus, after 60 years, it would appear we are finally approaching a complete census of bright quasars, with only the discovery of Changing Look Quasars (CLQ; e.g., LaMassa et al. 2015) from forthcoming surveys likely to add to the sample."
