            "text": "Organic single-molecule white light emitters (OSMWLEs)1 have stimulated enormous interest owing to their potential applications in next-generation white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs),2 sensing,3 anti-counterfeiting,4 biological imaging5,6 and optical waveguides (OWGs).7 The unique photophysical processes governing the broad visible spectrum emission of OSMWLEs are fundamentally very intriguing. The majority of WLEs reported, thus far, rely on harnessing singlet excitons either in a single molecule and/or polymers8 or multicomponent uorescent blends.9 These systems typically include monomer/ excimer complexes,10 inter/intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) systems,11 Fo\u0308rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems,12 excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) systems,13 and dual (prompt/delayed) uorescence (DFL) systems.14 In contrast, weakly susceptible triplet excitons in organic molecules adopt non-radiative pathways, and dissipate as heat\nInstitute of Technology Guwahati, i@iitg.ac.in notechnology, University of Hyderabad,\nd-500046, India te of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati-\n(ESI) available.

Essentially, phosphorescent OSMWLEs have immense prospects of triplet harvesting features under ambient conditions. They offer alternatives to conventional emitters due to the favourable no phase segregation, no colour aging, uniform lm-forming ability and simple device fabrication.17,18 However, due to ineffective molecular design and lack of fundamental insights on the excited-state dynamic (ESD) process, the origin of white light emission (WLE) is oen overlooked.\nRecently, multiple radiative decays from both singlet and triplet excitons generating WLE were demonstrated in organic molecules by typical FL or thermally activated delayed FL (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) or two distinct dual-phosphorescence (DP) studies.19\u201322 Strategically, an engineered TADF emitter possesses a well-separated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), comprising small singlet\u2013triplet splitting (DEST), that can harvest triplet excitons through an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process.23 Aer the rst report of seminal TADF emitter 4CZIPN,24 tremendous\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

These reports conrm that nearly all the WLEs rely on the conventional knowledge of crystallization and the external/internal heavy atom effect in a directly connected D\u2013A system. Despite the progress in designing WLEs, potential solid state applications at RT using a combination of multiple excited states in purely organic molecules are unexplored. Thus far, optical crystals with hot-exciton harvesting OSMWLEs having DFL and DP demonstrating efficient OWG attributes have not been reported to the best of our knowledge.\nIn this work, four through-space charge transfer (TSCT) OSMWLE materials have been designed and synthesized, denoted as BT2OxCz (x \u00bc 3, 4, 5 and 6), which contain acceptor 2,20-(1,3-phenylene)bis(benzothiazole) [BT2] and donor carbazole [Cz], connected via a series of odd/even alkyl chains. The synthesized BT2OxCz molecular crystals exhibit highly sought aer DFL and DP at RT. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the origin of WLE to substantially high lying manifold singlet and triplet excited states. A key conceptual insight on the emission process in the solid state is prompt uorescence (locally excited emission) and TADF, accompanied by DP at RT. Further, the enhancement of SOC via ne adjustment of moderate DEST ( 0.50\u20130.55 eV) between S1 and T1 with\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncollateral narrow DEST ( 0.02\u20130.12 eV) between S1 and T3/T4 facilitates efficient ISC and RISC to upsurge the TADF and RTP simultaneously. By varying the chain length between D and A, singlet and triplet states could be manipulated to realize a broadband visible range emission in powder, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) doped thin-lms and in single molecular crystals. Notably, sterically constrained shorter chain BT2OxCZ (x \u00bc 3, 4, 5) molecules display TADF and RTP. In contrast, the longest chain analogue BT2O6Cz exhibits relatively intense RTP, owing to dimer formation and subsequent inter-TSCT. Moreover, sterically strained \u2018J-aggregation\u2019 and geometrically relaxed \u2018H-aggregation\u2019 in the crystal lattice enable harvesting of singlet and triplet-excitons, simultaneously. Remarkably, 1D crystals of BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz efficiently guide triplet-harvesting light along their long axes with a low optical loss coefcient (a0 \u00bc 0.3260 dB mm 1, and 0.2158 dB mm 1 respectively)."

            "text": "By considering important aspects of OSMWLEs, a throughspace rational design strategy was developed to achieve solidstate WLE at RT. The conceived TADF and DP luminogens (BT2OxCz, x \u00bc 3, 4, 5 and 6) bear a donor Cz and an acceptor BT2 connected via short (three/four membered) and long (ve/ six membered) alkyl chains viz. BT2O3Cz, BT2O4Cz, BT2O5Cz, and BT2O6Cz. The key requisites to achieve white-emission in organic molecules depend on the following quantum-mechanical aspects and a few stringent requirements, which include: (1) singlet exciton equilibration with parent and other accessible excited states (e.g., $S1), favouring RISC from $T2 via a small DEST producing TADF.42 (2) Utilization of triplet excitons either from the distinct radiative decay of the T1 states (populated via TTET/IC, from $T2) or directly from $T3 by evolving with $S1 via a mixed ISC process. (3) Realization of stable phosphorescence from a small amount of impurities that could protect against triplet exciton quenching and result in faster decay from$T3.31 (4) Faster decay of$T3 to counterbalance the smaller extents with T1 to facilitate radiative decay from $T3 and T1, producing DP. (5) By creating excited state chargeseparation (ESCS) involving the hot-excitons in highly-exible molecular systems and controlling the complex excited-state dynamics, solid state white light emission could be generated. Collectively, these aspects directly inuence and contribute to the higher-lying singlet and triplet energy ($S4/S7 and $T8/T10) states allowing TADF and RTP simultaneously. The proposed Jablonski diagram illustrates the prominent photophysical processes and relative energy levels involved in ne tuning of the higher-lying excited states for WLE emission for the integrated OSMWLEs (Fig. 1).\nSynthesis of BT2OxCZ (x \u00bc 3, 4, 5 and 6) OSMWLEs 2,20-(5-(3-(9H-Carbazol-9-yl)alkoxy)-1,3-phenylene)bis(benzothiazole) compounds (BT2OxCz, x \u00bc 3, 4, 5 and 6) were synthesized using a simple two-step substitution reaction with 3,5-bis (benzothiazol-2-yl)phenol (BT2OH) in the presence of 9-\nChem.

Detailed structural characterization using NMR (1H and 13C) and HRMS is shown in Fig. S2\u2013S25.\u2020 The electron-accepting (A) (3,5-bis(benzothiazol-2yl)phenoxy) unit bearing a large number of lone pairs and two sulphur atoms makes the conjugated fragment highly electron decient. D\u2013A units are connected through-space via various non-conjugated alkyl chains. The electron balance in the molecule happens via through-space charge transfer (TSCT) from electron rich Cz to the electron decient BT2O unit. Moreover, by changing the length of the alkyl chain (propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl), the resultant molecules (BT2OxCz, x \u00bc 3, 4, 5 and 6) show an impressive tunable WLE at RT in the solid-state. From their crystal structures and computational optimized geometry it was observed that the molecules containing a shorter chain length adopt large twisted conformations rather than the structurally relaxed longer chain molecules. Geometrically strained BT2O3Cz and BT2O4Cz molecules showed a strong twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) feature rather than the more relaxed BT2O5Cz and BT2O6Cz which formed dimers. However, in the solid state all the emitters exhibited distinct TADF and RTP properties with Commission Internationale de l'e\u0301clairage (CIE) coordinate values very close to those of pure WLEs (0.33, 0.33).\nSolid state optical properties of OSMWLEs\nA clear mechanistic insight on the origin of WLE was methodically obtained by studying crystalline powders obtained from the slow evaporation of chloroform/hexane (8 : 2) solution. To decipher the details of intrinsic solid state WLE, PL and TRPL characteristics were investigated for all the through-space BT2OxCz emitters in their crystalline/amorphous powder states. UV-visible spectra for shorter chain BT2O3Cz and BT2O4Cz exhibited absorption bands at 350 and 315 nm, respectively. In contrast, longer chain BT2O5Cz and BT2O6Cz showed comparatively broader absorption bands at 340 and 330\n9006 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 9004\u20139015\nnm, respectively (Fig. 2A\u2013D, solid black lines). The broad absorption for longer chain emitters can be attributed to the dimeric assembly evident from the crystal packings. Further, steady state optical emission spectra recorded (Fig. 2A\u2013D, blue dotted line) for all the BT2OxCzs displayed broad emission spectra with multiple peaks covering the 400 to 700 nm region. Remarkably, an intense peak around 430 nm and other broad and weak shoulder peaks at 550 and >600 nm were observed for all the emitters, suggesting multimode emission due to the combined existence of uorescence and phosphorescence. Besides, the intensities of later peaks for BT2O5Cz and BT2O6Cz gradually decrease with increasing chain length due to the weakening of TSCT properties. To conrm the TICT effect on varying chain length between D\u2013A, solvatochromism studies were performed for BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz. Notably, a robust TICT feature with 150 nm red-shied emission was observed for BT2O3Cz containing a highly twisted shorter chain, while the strain free structure of BT2O6Cz showed no such TICT effect (Fig. S26\u2020).\nLikewise, the solid state phosphorescence spectra of all the WLE BT2OxCz showed multiple peaks distributed over the visible region (Fig. 2A\u2013D, orange dotted line). A weaker uorescence band (blue shaded) superimposes with steady state uorescence at 430 nm, whereas intense phosphorescence signals (red shaded) appear in the green ( 550 nm) and near-IR region (640, 634, 620 and 635 nm) for BT2O3Cz, BT2O4Cz, BT2O5Cz, and BT2O6Cz. These signals were also found to be identical with a steady state faint shoulder emission band (>600 nm). However, BT2O5Cz exhibited bright uorescence and showed weak phosphorescence because of its amorphous nature. To conrm the ascertained hypothesis for BT2O5Cz, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)/thin lm XRD and FETEM studies were conducted with pristine OSMWLEs at RT (Fig. S27\u2020). In both the XRD patterns, broad and weak peaks were observed for BT2O5Cz relating to its amorphous nature, whereas, other emitters of BT2OxCz (x \u00bc 3, 4, 6) showed sharp diffracting peak patterns in the low d-spacing region (marked by a red dotted box) depicting a high degree of crystallinity. In the FETEM, despite the micro-rod shaped morphologies of the OSMWLEs, the selected area (electron) diffraction (SAED) images showed a clear amorphous nature of BT2O5Cz powder (Fig. S28\u2020) which does not affect the singlets. Hence, it had bright uorescence and due to the lack of rigid crystallinity, non-radiative deactivation of triplets has not been fully circumvented, and thereby it showed weak phosphorescence. Notably, with increasing chain length, BT2O5Cz and BT2O6Cz exhibited blue-shied phosphorescence, probably due to the less geometrical strain reduced thermal relaxation of high lying triplet energy. Hence, we hypothesized that the former blue emission at 430 nm originated from a higher singlet state (>S1) and TADF in nature. However, the latter peaks are assigned to room temperature dual phosphorescence (RTDP) emission, derived from low (T1) and high lying triplet states (>T1). Subsequently, the lifetime recorded at 430 nm showed a biexponential decay comprising a ns range lifetime, due to the prompt locally excited emission (sPF \u00bc 0.94, 4.09, 5.27 and 3.11 ns for all BT2OxCz WLEs) (Fig. S29\u2020) and a microsecond (ms)\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The long average lifetime (5.27 ns and 55 ms) for BT2O5Cz further conrms the prominent uorescence nature of the emitter compared to the other three emitters. Besides, longer wavelength green/red region peaks are actually derived from the triplet state. To validate this, lifetime studies were carried out under ambient and inert conditions for all the emitters. As expected, the average lifetime calculated from bi-exponential decays showed huge enhancement from 6.77 to 68.07 ms for BT2O3Cz (lem \u00bc 640 nm), 10.89 to 18.89 ms for BT2O4Cz (lem \u00bc 634 nm), 21.65 to 30.75 ms for BT2O5Cz (lem \u00bc 620 nm) and 20.72 to 29.12 ms for BT2O6Cz (lem \u00bc 635 nm) (Fig. 2E\u2013H) under inert conditions.\nNotably, the higher lifetime for BT2O5Cz and BT2O6Cz was presumably due to the thermally elevated phosphorescence while the comparatively lower lifetime for BT2O3Cz and BT2O4Cz was because of TADF emission under ambient conditions. Further, the temperature-dependent delayed emission and the corresponding lifetime were veried by recording\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nemission at 100, 150, 200 and 300 K respectively for BT2O3CZ and BT2O6Cz (Fig. S31\u2013S36\u2020). Collectively, peaks at 430 and 600 nm with their delayed lifetime were veried as TADF and thermally elevated RTP in character. In contrast, delayed intensity and lifetime increase with increasing temperature from 100 to 300 K, providing concrete evidence to simultaneously support the thermally activated singlet and triplet exciton release process at RT.\nIn the temperature dependency results we observed anomalous behaviour for the OSMWLEs, which can be explained by considering the following aspects: (1) isomeric impurities act as charge traps and generate charge-separated excited states which are responsible for fast phosphorescence decay (at 550 nm emission with ms lifetime), (2) at elevated temperature hotter excitons are produced that may prefer a direct transition from higher-lying states (T3/T4 / S0) or go via TTET for favourable relaxation to feed T1 thereby resulting in 600 nm red phosphorescence and (3) communications among these emitting states at local minima by thermal motions (e.g., vibrations) may be weakened at low temperatures so that hot excitons remain\nChem.

Phosphorescence QY for all the BT2OxCz powders was calculated to be 4.5%, 4.4%, 5.3% and 13.3%. The radiative rate constant (kr) was calculated to be 6.72 107 s 1, 4.08 107 s 1, 2.55 107 s 1, and 6.14 107 s 1 and non-radiative rate constants (knr) were found to be 1.40 104 s 1, 0.87 104 s 1, 0.40 104 s 1, and 0.42 104 s 1, for all BT2OxCz WLEs. These results signify that excitons were utilized to the maximum extent for radiative decay ( 107) under photo-illumination.\nFurther, ISC and RISC rate constants calculated from PLQY and lifetime values of the prompt and delayed components were estimated to be kISC \u00bc 7.5 106 s 1, 1.53 106 s 1, 1.25 106 s 1, 0.75 106 s 1 and kRISC \u00bc 1.47 105 s 1, 0.24 105 s 1, 0.46 105 s 1, 0.48 105 s 1, for BT2OxCz (x \u00bc 3\u20136) respectively (summarized in Table S1\u2020).43 To obtain clear insights into phosphorescence emission at the molecular level, including elimination of the molecular aggregation effect and to restrict non-radiative motion, a set of control experiments were conducted on spin-coated lms aer doping all the BT2OxCz WLEs at 0.5 wt% and 5 wt% concentration into PMMA under inert conditions using dry toluene. The phosphorescence spectrum in low concentrated lms (0.5%) exhibited three distinct peaks located at 450 nm (TADF), 545 nm (fast RTP, sav \u00bc 80 ms) and 700 nm (slow RTP, sav \u00bc 2.5 ms) covering the entire visible range (Fig. 2I and J), clearly suggesting exclusion of molecular oxygen in the rigid polymer matrix, allowing signicant RTP contribution (triplet excitons are dominant over singlet excitons). Notably, in lms, there was an 20 nm bathochromic shi compared to the powder form with no change in peak positions for all four emitters, which could be due to the restriction in molecular motion (RIM), and strong intramolecular interactions rigidifying the structural conformation and resulting in suppression of non-radiative deactivation.44 The colour purity and uniform single molecular surface morphologies were established from the CIE diagram and atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography, respectively (Fig. S37 and S38\u2020). However, molecular aggregation caused the quenching effect reducing the RTP efficiency of the highly concentrated (5.0 wt%) PMMA-doped lm. As expected, the lm displayed only a broad uorescence and no phosphorescence at RT (Fig. S39 and S40\u2020). This result suggests that conformational rigidity in the proximity of phosphors is more important than the environmental matrix rigidity. Moreover, the two distinct triplet emission peaks from the 0.5 wt% PMMA-doped lm due to boosted ISC allowed triplet exciton migration from the high lying Tm state to the high lying T1 state via the intramolecular TTET process33 which was further elucidated by recording timeresolved emission spectra (TRES) at RT. The TRES spectra of model PMMA-doped BT2O3Cz exhibited two persistent delayed emission bands in the millisecond (ms) lifetime region within the 400 to 800 nm wavelength region (Fig. 2K). Here the\n9008 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 9004\u20139015\nemission band centered at 545 nm was inherited from the high energy level of T3/T4 states, corresponding to fast RTP, whereas the emission at 700 nm stems through the TTET process from T3/T4 to the low energy stable T1 state revealing slow RTP. It has also been observed that these compounds adopted broad and switchable emission colours by changing their excitation source. Upon steady state excitation the emission colour for crystalline powder had CIE coordinates near the blue region (0.24, 0.24) for BT2O3Cz, (0.26, 0.27) for BT2O4Cz, (0.18, 0.11) for BT2O5Cz and (0.19, 0.13) for BT2O6Cz. These CIE values revealed that OSMWLEs turn bluer with increasing chain length. In contrast, a very close pure white CIE (0.33, 0.33) was obtained upon excitation with a microsecond pulse as a source. The obtained phosphorescence CIE values were (0.35, 0.30) for BT2O3Cz, (0.39, 0.33) for BT2O4Cz, (0.40, 0.31) for BT2O5Cz and (0.36, 0.31) for BT2O6Cz (Fig. 2L). The emitters containing shorter and longer chains emit close to pure white, likely due to the strong packing and wider overlaps of dual uorescence and phosphorescence in the crystalline state that enabled the suppression of triplet non-radiative decays and promoted equilibrium in their states. Furthermore, phosphorescence spectra and decays were recorded for the neat lm of model compound BT2O3Cz under heating conditions (298 K, 323 K, 353 K and 373 K). Considering the photostability of OSMWLEs, both TADF and thermally elevated phosphorescence were involved. The phosphorescence spectra of the heated lms of BT2O3Cz exhibited distinct TADF and phosphorescence properties with increasing temperatures and relatively higher intensity was observed at 353 K. Notably, at RT (298 K) no distinguishable peaks at 550 and 600 nm were observed which may be due to the quenching effect in neat lms. However, peaks were distinguished at elevated temperatures due to the contributions of hot-excitons in their respective emission sources. Moreover, no signicant difference in life-time was observed in the lm, signifying good photo-stability of BT2O3Cz (Fig. S41\u2020). The overall photophysical properties are summarized in Table 1, which identies multimode emissions and their vital difference in various states."

To verify this, excitation wavelength-dependent emission studies were performed for BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz. A series of excitation wavelengths were used to excite the luminogens, and the PL spectra illustrated the bright state emission (lem \u00bc 430 nm) which disappears when excitation shied to a longer wavelength (lex \u00bc 300 to 500 nm) from normal excitation (lex \u00bc 320 nm) (Fig. S43 and S44\u2020). Moreover, on excitation at lex \u00bc 500 nm a red-shied dark emission feature emerges at 530 and 570 nm, indicating that the molecule relaxes to the lower energy dark states viz. S1/S2. By xing the excitation wavelength to a lower energy (500 nm), weak emission was observed from a lower-lying excited state (the dark state, which in this scenario is S1). This experiment proved that the main emission is from an energy level higher than S1, while S1 is a weakly emissive one and corroborates the existence of dark states via SOKR.45 Further, viscosity-induced enhanced uorescence of BT2OxCz (x \u00bc 3 and 6) was also studied in various microviscous environments where a binary mixture, glycerol (Gly) and methanol, was used to regulate the viscosity of the medium (Fig. S45 and S46\u2020). The emission maxima initially shied to longer wavelengths with increasing Gly fraction (fGly) due to ICT. However, tenfold enhanced emission intensity was observed at 99% fGly, compared to the methanol solution. Since, in the low viscous medium, excitation to the emissive excited state followed by rotation about the rotor axis signicantly decreases the energy gap between the emissive and dark excited states, it resulted in a rapid internal conversion (IC) to S1, while in a highly viscous medium or in the aggregated state, the non-radiative deactivation of the twisted complex is circumvented by suppressing IC from the >S1 state to the dark S1 state, due to restricted rotation thereby resulting in huge uorescence enhancement.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFurther, to shed light on the 550 nm emission, carbazole units containing alkyl chains were taken independently, resulting in ultra-long room temperature phosphorescence emission (URTP)4,31 of up to several seconds aerglow (removing UV-excitation) for carbazole moieties containing four, ve and six carbon chains, respectively (Fig. S47 including live Videos SIV1-URTP-1,3CzBr, SIV2-URTP-1,4CzBr, SIV3-URTP1,5CzBr and SIV4-URTP-1,6CzBr respectively\u2020). Moreover, steady state PL spectra of 1, nCzBr exhibited a sharp prompt uorescence band near 375 nm and a shoulder phosphorescence peak at 550 nm. Additionally, phosphorescence spectra recorded in air showed a very distinct band centered at 550 nm with lifetime values of 95.1 ms, 187.5 ms, 47.57 ms and 126.2 ms for 1,3CzBr, 1,4CzBr, 1,5CzBr and 1,6CzBr, respectively. More interestingly, the fast RTP at 550 nm emission of BT2OxCz exactly matched with the URTP emission of bromo alkylated carbazole derivatives.\nNotably, it is reported that URTP emission can be observed due to the presence of trace amounts of isomeric impurities [1H-benzo[f]indole (Bd)] of commercial carbazole derivatives.31 Therefore, the fast phosphorescence emission from the present BT2OxCz emitter is also inherited because of the impurity effect conrmed by HPLC analysis (Fig. 3A, B and S48\u2020).\nThe hypothesis was further conrmed by laser-induced uorescence (LIF) spectra and transient absorption (TA) study. We recorded LIF spectra for BT2O6Cz at 77 K and RT from LP980 at varying delays aer the pump pulse (Fig. 3C and S49\u2013 S51\u2020). The LIF spectra demonstrated that on moving from ns to ms delay, distinctive phosphorescence was observed in the range of 500\u2013700 nm. Further, TA study was conducted with the PMMA doped spin-coated lm (0.5%) of BT2O6Cz, and two distinct positive transient absorption signals appeared at 550 and 700 nm at 77 K while at RT both peaks increased and the 700 nm TA signal dominated (Fig. 3D). Besides, kinetic TA trace also exhibited an exponential decay prole (Fig. S53B\u2020). These results clearly depicted that the trace\nChem.

Consecutively, the hotter excitons (emissive higher-lying triplet excited states T3/T4) are likely feeding the lowest T1 state via TTET at RT. Substantially, the communication is cut off at 77 K, indicative of such higher triplet excited states that are being separated from the lowest T1.46 At the same time, 700 nm emission has also been rationalized as due to due to aggregation-induced supramolecular non-covalent interactions evolving alkyl chains furnishing tight molecular packing via dimerization and circumventing non-radiative decays in the solid state. To investigate the intrinsic insights and support the experimentally obtained multimode emission results, quantum-mechanical calculations were performed for BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz from their optimized single crystal structure geometry using the Gaussian 16 program.47 Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level up to the 10th state at their different spin multiplicities (Fig. 4A, B and S54\u2020). Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) results displayed well separated electron density distributions in their respective HOMO and LUMO with a wider band gap prole (3.61/3.48 eV) depicting TSCT behaviour of these emitters (Fig. 4A(i) and B(i)). Nonetheless, zero energy splitting (0.02 and 0.12 eV) between S1 and T3/T4 strongly favours an efficient RISC process, where, relatively larger differences of S1 (3.24, 3.03 eV) and T1 (2.74, 2.39 eV) lead to moderate DEST values of 0.50 and 0.71 eV for BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz (Fig. 4A(ii) and B(ii)), which\n9010 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 9004\u20139015\ncorresponds to the basic prerequisite for displaying a simultaneous TADF and RTP emission.19,20\nEnergy band gap and DEST values suggest a strong susceptibility of TADF for shorter chain and intense RTP for longer chain emitters respectively. Further, active manifold ISC channels were also investigated using sequential adiabatic energies related to the ground state for S1, >S1 and T1 to higher triplet states of up to the 10th state and their corresponding major frontier orbital contributions are summarized in Tables S2\u2013S9.\u2020 Noticeably, the oscillator strengths (f) at S1\u2013S3 states for both the emitters were found to be zero (f\u00bc 0), indicating that the lowest S1 state is a non-emissive state. Large f values were observed beyond S4/S5 depicting electronic relaxation from higher-lying states (>S4) contributing an emissive state which is unusual and reverse of conventional and many experimental results. Moreover, ambient delayed uorescence or phosphorescence emission by harvesting the triplet state is a very difficult process, as most of the organic molecules undergo S1 (p\u2013p*) / T1 (p\u2013p*), a forbidden ISC transition. However, in the present molecules, natural transition orbital (NTO) calculations suggested that S1 and >S1 have pure\n1ICT and 1LE (p\u2013p*) characters while T1 and T3 have a\n3LE (n\u2013p*) character (Fig. S55\u2020). Therefore, the multimode emissions by the involved NTOs corresponding to higher excited states producing 1ICT / 3LE and 1LE / 3LE/3ICT transitions (allowed transition) within singlet and triplet (Sn and Tm) manifolds result in substantially enhanced SOC thereby leading to TADF and RTP simultaneously. These theoretical ndings are able to rationalize the simultaneous process of TADF and RTP that occurred from higher-lying states (hot-excitons).48 Furthermore, to reveal the dissimilar\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Besides, very weak p\u2013p stacking between the two BT units in BT2O6Cz (3.35 A, 3.36 A) leads to a dimeric structure, whereas, BT2O3Cz exhibits a J-aggregated structure (slip angle 43.71 between BT cores, 37.56 between Cz cores). BT2O6Cz exhibits an H-aggregated structure (slip angle 82.61 between BT cores, 78.48 between Cz cores) (Fig. 5C and D), and this dimeric form is stabilized by multiple non-covalent interactions and separated electron clouds of individual D\u2013A units (detailed SC-structural analysis summarized in Table S11\u2020). These key factors enabled considerably weak p\u2013p stacking, leading to strengthening of TSCT interactions. Additionally, their bulk crystal tight packing shows that H-aggregated BT2O6Cz leads to overall denser molecular packing rather than J-aggregated BT2O3Cz in their crystalline state, which suppressed vibrational deactivation and activated the radiative channels52 (Fig. 5E and F). Simulation studies by electrostatic potential (ESP) mapping and their corresponding two-dimensional (2D) ngerprint plots (Crystal Explorer 3.1 soware) substantiated the packing and interactions (p\u2013p stacking and intermolecular HB interactions).

Moreover, (001) and (002) are the primary crystal growth facet for BT2O3Cz while (200) is for BT2O6Cz (Fig. 5M and N and Tables S12 and S13\u2020). Further, both crystals were thermally stable up to 400 C (Fig. S59\u2020). Overall, these studies reveal the contribution of denser supramolecular noncovalent interactions, self-assembly induced solid-state packing, growth morphology and thermal stability profoundly to their ESD and multi-emissions. Further, the H-aggregated molecular packing greatly impedes higher triplet state stabilization thereby favouring phosphorescence for longer chain BT2O6Cz.\nThe densely packed crystalline state is a key strategy to realize triplet emission for most organic phosphorescent materials.55 The solid state features of BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz motivated us to probe the triplet-harvesting optical waveguiding properties in their single crystal states. We performed single-crystal micro-spectroscopy studies on crystals of BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz of length z202.9 mm and z75.6 mm."

Excitation at the le terminal of the microcrystal generated bright greenish-white luminescence which subsequently propagated and out-coupled at the opposite terminal (Fig. 6A and B). The microcrystals were excited at different points along their long axes (202.9, 163.2, 132.3, 101.4, 67.6, 32.3 and 0 mm for BT2O3Cz and 75.6, 63.1, 46.5, 39, 27, 15 and 0 mm for BT2O6Cz).

Noticeably, the spectral proles did not shi with the excitation position. However, with an increase of light propagation distance, the PL intensity gradually decreased due to propagation-induced optical loss (Fig. 6C and D).\nBy tting of an exponential decay function, Iout/Iin\u00bc exp( aD), where D is the distance between the illuminated position and the signal collection point of the crystal, the loss coefficient a0 (where a0 \u00bc 4.34a) was determined to be as low as 0.3260 dB mm 1 and 0.2158 dB mm 1 for BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz respectively (Fig. 6E and F).56 These data suggest good optical waveguiding performance of these crystalline organic phosphorescent micro-rods (Fig. 6G and H). Notably, these a0 values are lower than those of most of the state-of-the art 1D optical waveguide materials such as solvate crystals, metal\u2013organic frameworks and hybrid perovskite crystals.57,58 These results conrm the triplet-harvesting light propagation ability of microcrystals suitable for photonic device applications."

The bridging alkyl chain-length between D\u2013A and a trace amount of carbazole isomer plays a crucial role in controlling the excited state relaxation processes and ne tunes the emission behaviour in the solid state and PMMA doped lm states, respectively. The integrated heavy atom free and amorphous OSMWLEs with shorter chain BT2O3Cz, BT2O4Cz and BT2O5Cz displayed TADF-RTP while longer chain BT2O6Cz was more susceptible to\nChem.

Notably, two distinct fast/slow phosphorescence emissions were realized where the fast phosphorescence was observed due to trace amounts of isomeric impurities of commercial carbazole, while H-/J-aggregation results in slow phosphorescence. Theoretical studies provided valuable information on the effective manifold ISC channel and narrow DEST values (0.02/0.50 and 0.12/0.71 eV) strongly supporting the experimental results in the isolated and dimeric form of the emitters from their single crystal geometry. Transient PL studies revealed the co-existence of thermally elevated uorescence-phosphoresce at the same time. Remarkably, the single-crystal structure illustrates that aggregation induced densely packed supramolecular crystals of BT2O3Cz and BT2O6Cz exhibited self-guided triplet-harvesting light propagation capability along the primary growth direction with a low optical loss coefficient. Overall, this new approach presents a unique strategy to obtain efficient photonic materials by stressing the importance of modulating and optimizing the bridging groups in achieving multi-emissions in a single molecule. The multifunctional OSMWLEs from a single component system demonstrate the rst example of simultaneous observation of locally excited emission, TADF, RTDP and optical wave-guiding properties."
