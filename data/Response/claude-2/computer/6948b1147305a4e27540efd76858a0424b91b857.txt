 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Explore using different similarity metrics besides L2 distance and cosine similarity for retrieving nearest neighbors. Metrics like semantic textual similarity could help find more relevant neighbors. 

2. Investigate incorporating external domain data as part of the k-NN search instead of just using the training data. This could provide more diverse neighbors and knowledge.

3. Study how to reduce the memory requirements for large-scale k-NN retrieval, such as approximate nearest neighbor search methods. This could improve efficiency.

4. Examine the impact of different modulating factors f(pkNN) for calibrating the training loss. The paper explored focal loss and negative log-likelihood, but other options could be researched.

5. Evaluate the effectiveness of integrating k-NN with other state-of-the-art PLMs besides RoBERTa, such as T5, BART, etc. This could reveal if the benefits generalize across PLMs.
