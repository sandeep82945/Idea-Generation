Using the Apathy Evaluation Scales among other awareness scales, we 4 report that apathy is the sole awareness dimension distinguishing healthy controls (25), mild 5 (57) and moderate-to-moderately-severe (11) Alzheimer\u2019s patients. A linear regression 6 showed that the Mini-Mental State Examination score used as a risk factor for non-awareness 7 was the only factor associated with awareness of apathy and was the best predictor. This 8 suggests that apathy is the most discriminant dimension for awareness assessment in 9\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. 10\nKey-words: Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 Awareness \u2013 Apathy \u2013 Assessment method 11\nPage 3 sur 14\nLack of awareness of their own deficits is commonly observed among patients with 2 Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). This can increase with disease progression, complicating 3 management because patients refuse assistance, thinking they do not need it [1]. 4\nAwareness is usually assessed using three methods. The patient-caregiver discrepancy 5 method, using caregiver ratings as the reference, and subtracting patient ratings. The clinical 6 rating methods use structured patient interviews on different impairment domains. The 7 prediction of performance discrepancy method where scores on tests used are the reference to 8 be compared to predictions [1]. 9\nLack of awareness has been found to be associated with executive functions and more 10 particularly with dysexecutive behavioural symptoms. Using a longitudinal methodology, 11 Starkstein et al [2] reported that patients with impaired awareness were more apathetic than 12 those with better awareness, and that apathy increased with the progression of the disease. 13 Horning et al. [3] reported a positive association between behavioural disturbances and lack 14 of awareness. This association was particularly pronounced for apathy and lack of awareness. 15 Starkstein et al. [4] found anosognosia to be the best predictor of apathy in AD. More 16 recently, in a review of literature, Azocar et al. reported that the majority of studies assessing 17 the relationship between impaired awareness and apathy in mild-to-moderate AD showed a 18 significant positive association [5]. In addition, apathy is the commonest symptom at any 19 stage in the disease [6-7]. Conversely, better awareness has been frequently found to be 20 associated with greater depression [5, 8]. 21\nSince associations between poorer awareness, lesser depression and greater apathy have been 22 reported, the role of assessment methods has been studied, showing associations with apathy 23 scored by a relative or a clinician, whatever the assessment method used, [9]. Indeed, the 24\nPage 4 sur 14\nrelative whatever the awareness dimensions explored [10], suggesting that lack of awareness 2 could be a main component of apathy. This does not contradict studies suggesting the 3 multidimensionality of awareness, because multidimensionality entails various components of 4 awareness such as different cognitive functions, behaviours and emotional expressions. All of 5 this can be modulated and even inhibited by apathy, which could explain why, with certain 6 statistical analyses, awareness appears multidimensional whereas modelling awareness using 7 regression analysis can reduce it to a few factors supervising the others. 8\nBecause apathy, meaning a lack of initiation and interest relating to various dimensions of 9 cognition, behaviour and emotions, is involved whatever the awareness dimension assessed 10 using the patient-caregiver discrepancy method, it could be the most discriminant awareness 11 dimension to be explored in AD using this method. Here, we predicted that apathy could be 12 the most discriminant awareness dimension over and above the cognitive, behavioural, 13 emotional, relational and daily living autonomy awareness dimensions among patients with 14 mild-to-moderately-severe AD, compared to healthy controls. 15\n2 Method 16\n2.1 Participants 17\nThe study included 93 participants. Twenty-five were Healthy Controls (HC) recruited from a 18 pool of previous participants. Sixty-eight participants were Alzheimer\u2019s patients, according to 19 the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association Working Group diagnostic 20 guidelines for AD [11], recruited from a memory center. The disease stage was determined 21 using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE score) [12-13]. Fifty-seven (57) patients 22 presented mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease (20\u2264MMSE<30) and 11 a moderate-to-moderately-severe 23 form (10\u2264MMSE<20). In fact, only one patient with a moderately-severe form (MMSE=13) 24\nPage 5 sur 14\nalready been recruited in our previous studies [9-10] and we added only 7 Alzheimer\u2019s 2 patients. All participants signed consent to participate and the study was approved by the local 3 ethics committee. 4\n2.2 Evaluation tools 5\n2.2.1 Cognitive assessment 6\nAll participants were assessed using the MMSE, and the Frontal Assessment Battery \u2013 FAB 7 [14]. In order to ensure the absence of anterograde memory impairment (possible Mild 8 Cognitive Impairment) among healthy controls, we systematically used the Free and Cued 9 Recall Test \u2013 FCRT [15] and the Delayed Match to Sample test \u2013 DMS-48 [16]. Healthy 10 controls perform normally for all cognitive tasks (MMSE, FCRT, DMS-48 and FAB). 11"

Healthy controls were younger (W=24.05, p<0.0001) and more 20 educated than patients (W=11.87, p=0.0026) who did not differ across subgroups. The three 21 groups were comparable for gender (p>0.05). Healthy controls performed significantly better 22 than patients for all variables except for depression where all groups were comparable (GDS: 23 p>0.05). Only four variables distinguished the three groups (healthy controls > mild 24\nPage 7 sur 14\np<0.0001), which is logical because it was used to distinguish the groups, the FAB (W=38.39, 2 p<0.0001) relating to executive functioning, apathy, only scored by a relative (AESRelative: 3 W=37.05, p<0.0001) and awareness of apathy obtained by subtracting AESPatient from 4 AESRelative (W=18.39, p=0.0001). 5\nConcerning awareness dimensions, only apathy distinguished the three groups (W=18.39, 6 p=0.0001). Concerning the PCRS, the total score, the Activities of Daily Living sub-scale and 7 the Cognition subscale distinguished healthy controls from patients without taking into 8 account the disease stage (healthy controls / patients, respectively: W=16.64, p=0.0006; 9 W=9.09, p=0.0102; W=20.56, p<0.0001). The PCRS Emotions sub-scale and the PCRS 10 Relations sub-scale only distinguished healthy controls from mild Alzheimer without 11 distinguishing moderate-to-moderately-severe Alzheimer from the previous two (respectively: 12 W=8.019, p=0.0181; W=7.892, p=0.0193). Finally, for the A-QD, the total score, and the 13 intellectual and behavioural subscale scores distinguished healthy controls from patients 14 without taking into account the disease stage (healthy controls / patients, respectively: 15 W=17.33, p=0.0001; W=17.03, p=0.0002; W=9.518, p=0.0085). 16\nWe also performed a manual backward regression for awareness of apathy (AESRelative - 17 AESPatient) using the disease stage (MMSE score) as a risk factor. In addition to the risk factor 18 maintained in the model, we entered the following variables: Age, Education, Gender, IADL, 19 FAB, GDS relating to depression and AESClinician for apathy. We maintained confounding 20 factors impacting at least 15% of the risk factor estimate in the model [9-10]. The only factor 21 associated with awareness of apathy was the risk factor itself (\u03b2=1.17, IC95%=0.64-1.69, 22 p<0.0001), without confounding factors. The model showed normal fit (W=0.99, p=0.81) but 23 homoscedasticity with the Snedecor test was debatable (F=0.21, p<0.0001). 24\nPage 8 sur 14\nscore was the best predictor of awareness of apathy, explaining 17.62% of the variance. 2 Nevertheless, this not exclude other associations such as that between the AESClinician and the 3 MMSE (r= 0.636, p<0.0001), and awareness of apathy and the AESClinician (r= 0.366, 4 p=0.0003). 5\nAfter adjusting our model on age and education, MMSE and age were significantly associated 6 with awareness of apathy (respectively p=0.0028, and p=0.01847), and the three factors 7 explained 20.57% of the variance against 17.62% for the MMSE alone.

            "text": "Our hypothesis that awareness of apathy could be the most discriminant dimension for 12 awareness assessment using the patient-caregiver discrepancy method appears valid. 13\nFirstly, apathy is the only awareness dimension, rather than the cognitive, relational, 14 emotional, behavioural and autonomy in daily living dimensions, discriminating healthy 15 controls, mild Alzheimer\u2019s patients and moderate-to-moderately-severe Alzheimer\u2019s patients. 16 The other discriminant dimensions were the cognitive, autonomy and behavioural dimensions, 17 which only distinguished patients from healthy controls. 18\nSecondly, when using a risk factor (i.e. stage of the disease as measured by the MMSE) to 19 take into account its interactions with awareness of apathy, the only associated factor was the 20 MMSE score. Therefore, this score also appears as the best predictor of awareness of apathy 21 in our sample, explaining alone 17.62% of the variance. 22\nPage 9 sur 14\nclinician was systematically associated with awareness whatever the dimension explored 2 when using the patient-caregiver discrepancy method [10]. 3\nNevertheless, some studies [21-22] have reported that the MMSE was not a predictor of 4 behavioural disturbances, although their objectives (studying imagery, personality changes\u2026) 5 and assessment tools were different from those used here which only partially concerned 6 apathy. Alongside, some authors such Starkstein et al. [2] clearly highlighted the associations 7 between increased dementia, increased apathy and decreased awareness with a longitudinal 8 methodology. Our results were totally congruent with that all the more so because the patient 9 groups were more impaired than the HC group for all the awareness scores and the apathy 10 scores. 11\nTherefore, it can appear curious that in spite of our knowledge about the relationship between 12 apathy and awareness or apathy and dementia, there is no study assessing awareness of apathy 13 across different stages in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. For several years, anosognosia has been known 14 to be a predictor of apathy in Alzheimer\u2019s disease [4], and apathy is known to be a main risk 15 factor for conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment into Alzheimer\u2019s disease [23-24]. 16 Recently, Azocar et al. [5] reported that ten out of eleven studies on apathy and impaired 17 awareness found positive associations between them. In addition, systematic associations 18 between different domains of awareness as measured with the A-QD and apathy were also 19 reported by Amanzio et al. [25] and Mak et al. [26]. 20\nIndeed, we found one study on awareness of apathy among addiction patients [27]. This study 21 reported that greater grey matter volume in the dorsal striatum was associated with poorer 22 awareness of apathy among cocaine-dependent individuals. We found another study reporting 23 the role of awareness dimensions in AD [28]. This study showed that the level of awareness 24 differs according to the dimension studied, with awareness of the overall condition and 25\nPage 10 sur 14\ndis-inhibition and apathy. It is possible that the differing objectives, assessment tools and 2 statistical analyses used in this second study could explain why the authors did not report the 3 same findings as ours. Nevertheless, the lack of studies relating to awareness of apathy across 4 different stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease could be explained by other behavioural disturbances 5 appearing with disease progression that could mask apathy. However, apathy is the 6 commonest symptom at any stage of the disease [6-7]. Awareness of it seems to increase with 7 disease progression and it therefore appears as a very discriminating dimension for awareness 8 assessment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in particular using the patient-caregiver discrepancy 9\nmethod. 10\nFrom a practical viewpoint, the AES, implementing the patient-caregiver discrepancy 11 method, can be used to assess awareness in mild to moderate stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease 12 only, because of the several response choices (Never, Sometimes, Often, Always), making the 13 scale more difficult to complete in more severe stages of the disease. Other apathy scales 14 could be more suited to severe stages of the disease such as the Apathy Inventory designed on 15 the same principle as the AES, but comprising only three general questions relating to 16 affectivity, initiation and interest in each version (patient, relative and caregiver) [29]. 17\nSeveral limitations should be underlined. Group sizes were not matched and some of them 18 were small. Nor were they matched for age or for education level, which could increase the 19 impact of MMSE on awareness of apathy as the level of apathy. The depression scale was 20 only scored by participants, which does not take into account anosognosia towards depression 21 reported in AD [30] possibly explaining the comparability for depression across groups. There 22 was collinearity between the factors entered into the model, and the validity conditions for 23 linear models were not totally met, in particular for homoscedasticity. Furthermore, 24\nPage 11 sur 14\ncollinearity. 2\nFurther studies should explore associations between apathy and lack of awareness in order to 3 determine whether lack of awareness is a main component of apathy, and to identify any 4 overlap between symptoms. Because apathy is a person\u2019s lack of concern towards his or her 5 environment and him or herself, greater apathy could lead to poorer awareness. Therefore, 6 one question remains: whether awareness of apathy could be a meta-awareness. 7\nThe authors have no conflict of interest to report. 8\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Mrs Angela VERDIER for her linguistic 9\nand scientific assistance. 10"
