Benzimidazolone and benzimidazole are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, pigments, herbicides, and ne chemicals (Fig. 1).11 The synthesis of these privileged scaffolds primarily relies on ortho-phenylenediamine or orthohaloanilines.12 Recently, the oxidative annulation of anilides/ aniline is emerging as an attractive strategy for expanding the substrate scope.13 The Zhang group reported the coppercatalyzed synthesis of benzimidazolones and benzimidazoles exploiting the SOMO-stabilized radical cation of diarylamines (Scheme 1a).14 The electrophilic C\u2013H amination has emerged as\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The incipient oxyanion may trigger the 1,2-migration of the directing group to provide benzimidazolone. Instead, thiophilic copper may endorse the extrusion of hydrogen sulde to provide benzimidazole from the corresponding thioamide directing group (Scheme 1c). However, (1) copper-catalyzed C\u2013H amination with a primary amine is a formidable challenge due to the catalyst inhibition;18 (2) a deleterious intramolecular oxidative cyclization of the corresponding directing group may impede the cascade process19 (Scheme 1d(i)); (3) competing periand para-C\u2013H amination of naphthalene should be suppressed20 (Scheme 1d(ii)). Furthermore, C\u2013H amination with aliphatic primary amines is challenging and less explored.21"

            "text": "We hypothesized that C\u2013H amination with electrophilic primary amine surrogates may overcome the catalyst inhibition problem. To test our hypothesis, picolinamide-protected 1- naphthylamine 1a, and 1.0 equiv. of O-benzoylhydroxylamine 2a was subjected to our previous reaction condition to afford the expected imidazolone product 3a in 44% yield. In the course of further optimization, DMSO was found to be the optimal solvent and excellent yields of this tandem reaction, e.g., 93% and 87% were obtained with just 5.0 and 1.0 mol% catalyst loading, respectively (Table 1). Other copper catalysts, lower reaction temperature, and 1.2 equiv. of 2a provided inferior results. Free primary amines along with external oxidants such as PIDA, K2S2O8 or Bz2O2 were able to furnish the desired product in <5%, 12% and 32% yields, respectively. Using 1.2 equiv. of 2a along with 1.0 equiv. Bz2O2 the yield was dropped to 58%. Other metal catalysts such as Pd(OAc)2, Co(OAc)2, Ni(OAc)2, Mn(OAc)2, FeCl2, and FeBr2 were less or ineffective for this transformation (for detailed optimization, see the ESI\u2020). Other aminating reagents such as anthranil, benzisoxazole, or oxime esters under the same condition could not afford any desired product.\nUnder the optimized reaction condition, cyclic as well as acyclic primary amines furnished the desired products in good to high yields (Table 2). Cyclohexylamine provided an excellent 93% yield of the desired product (3a), whereas cyclopentyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctylamines afforded slightly lower 78%, 65%, and 46% yields, respectively (3b\u20133d). In the case of acyclic amines, yields increased with the increase in chain length (3e\u2013 3g) and steric bulk. Surprisingly, sterically hindered sec-butyl (3i), tert-butyl (3j), adamantylamine (3m) provided almost quantitative yields exhibiting a positive inuence of steric bulk\nChem.

Competition experiment of 1a with 2m and 2n afforded 3m and 3n in 70% and 28%, respectively. Several substituted 1-naphthylamines including methyl substitution at the C8 position provided high to excellent yields of the desired products (3q\u20133y). Heterocyclic amino quinoline and isoquinoline provided the rearranged product in excellent yields (3z, 3aa). Delightedly, diverse (2-Nheteroaryl) anilides serve as excellent directing groups and are incorporated into the benzimidazolones (3ac\u20133ah). Interestingly, 3-methyl picolinamide provided the corresponding Npyridyl product (3ac) via ipso-substitution. Similarly, the amides of 5-methyl pyrazinoic (3ad, CCDC 2025269), quinaldic (3ae), and pyrazinoic acid (3af, 3ag) also furnished in comparable yields. Isoquinoline-1-carbamide provided a mixture of benzimidazolone 3ah and C\u2013H amination product 3ah0. This may be the result of an unfavourable tetrahedral intermediate due to steric reasons. 6-Aminoquinoline provided the C\u2013H amination at the C5 position. Furthermore, sterically less hindered methyl amine provided a corresponding 2-pyridylbenzimidazole (3aj, CCDC 2025266), imparting the role of steric and trajectory of the C\u2013H amination on the subsequent rearrangement reaction.\nWe performed the reaction with various ortho, meta, parasubstituted anilines under the same condition and successfully we got 30% rearranged product in 2-phenyl aniline and ortho amination product (35%) in a 3,5-dimethoxy aniline system. Aer getting these results, we turned our attention to optimize\n5728 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 5726\u20135733\nthese reactions (for detailed optimization; see the ESI\u2020). Aer several screenings of solvents, base or acid additives, ligands there was no signicant improvement in the rearrangement reaction of 2-phenyl aniline picolinamide. Increasing temperature to 100 C product yield increased to 40%. Then, we performed the reaction in different ortho-substituted anilines (electron-donating bulky groups) to obtain rearranged benzimidazolones in moderate to good yields (3ak\u20133ao). Finally, we were able to get an ortho C\u2013H amination product in 3,5-dimethoxy aniline with 72% yield at 90 C using 2.0 equiv. LiOtBu (3ap). While 3,5-dimethyl substituted picolinamide furnished the C\u2013H amination product in 52% yield, the corresponding 3,5- bis(triuoromethyl)aniline substrate remained unreactive indicating a profound role of electronic nature (3aq, 3ar). Besides cyclohexylamine, other amines also afforded the ortho C\u2013H amination products in moderate yields (3as\u20133au). However, no benzimidazolones were formed even at a low catalyst loading or additives, suggesting that an ortho substitution w.r.t. picolinamide is crucial for the subsequent rearrangement reaction.\n2-Pyridylbenzimidazoles are an important class of compounds generally used as excellent ligands for metal complexation and glukokinase activator.22 We turned our attention to optimize the reaction for benzimidazole. Initially, we started the optimization of benzimidazole with 1a and 2a. All our efforts using different acidic solvents such as AcOH or TFE, acid additives such as BzOH, TsOH, and high temperature (120 C) to facilitate dehydration aer cyclization were in vain. Gratifyingly, the corresponding picolinimidamide afforded the imidazole product in 30% yield in 12 h. Since thioamides have been proved as excellent directing groups in Pd- or Co-catalyzed C\u2013H functionalizations,23 we hypothesized that thiophilic copper24 may trigger the liberation of hydrogen sulde from thioamide instead of 1,2-pyridyl migration to furnish the desired benzimidazole product. Hence, examining thiopicolinamide 4a under the reaction condition resulted in the desired 2-pyridylbenzimidazole exclusively albeit in a low yield. Aer several screenings (for detailed optimization, see the ESI\u2020), using 3.0 equiv. of 2a, 20 mol% Cu(OAc)2$H2O and 1.2 equiv. of K2CO3 in DMSO at 90 C under O2 atmosphere the desired product was obtained in 88% yield. During the optimization, we found K2CO3 and O2 to be crucial otherwise yield dropped signicantly.\nDuring the substrate scope studies, we observed a positive inuence of the increasing chain length of the linear amines (5c\u20135d, Table 3). Unlike imidazolones, the yields of isomeric acyclic amines decreased with the increase in a-substitution (5d\u20135g). Benzylamine, furylamine, adamantanemethylamine and 4-amino-1-boc piperidine afforded the products in moderate yields (5h\u20135k). Thioamides of 5-methyl pyrazine-2carboxylic acid and 2-quinaldic acids also provided the imidazole product in moderate yields (5l, 5m). Various substituted 1- naphthylamines at different positions also underwent the reaction providing the desired product in medium to good yields (5n\u20135s).

Gratifyingly, varying different substituents in the phenyl ring of 2, we observed that 4-NMe2 substitution furnished the product in 65% yield. Protected cyclopentylamine afforded the desired product in 44% yield in 12 h. Monocyclic substrates were unreactive under metal-free conditions. Notably, the possibility of metal contamination was excluded by using all new glassware, freshly distilled solvents, and repeating the reaction at least four times. Although, this metal-free, two-step process has inherent limitations, we anticipate that it has profound mechanistic implications.\nTo gain insight into the reaction mechanism, when an equimolarmixture of 1r and 1acwas treated in our reaction condition, 3r and 3ac were formed and no cross-over product was isolated suggesting an intramolecular 1,2-pyridyl migration (Scheme 2a). Unsymmetrically-substituted 5-methyl pyrazine anilide 1ad afforded the imidazolone product 3ad exclusively through ipso C\u2013N bond formation (Table 2). Either performing the reaction at room temperature for a shorter time or quenching the reaction aer 1.5 h, a mixture of the starting material, C\u2013H amination product 1a0, and rearranged product were observed. Heating a preformed C\u2013H amination product 1a0 in absence of 2a <5% product was formed. However, a combination of copper catalyst and O-benzoylhydroxylamine 2a (1.5 equiv.) or even benzoylperoxide alone furnished the desired 3a in high yields (Scheme 2b). Therefore, besides an aminating agent, 2a also acts as an oxidant for catalytic turnover. Furthermore, the imidazole product 5a was not converted into the corresponding imidazolone 3a under the\nScheme 2 Control experiments.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

In place of picolinamide 1a, the corresponding benzanilide 6 or 7 did not furnish any desired product (Scheme 2d). 7 does not undergo any rearrangement even in the presence of Bz2O2, suggesting that the pyridyl-nitrogen is not only involved in the directed C\u2013H amination but also in the subsequent steps. In both conditions, 7 underwent decomposition with 50% starting material recovery. To examine the involvement of radicals in this C\u2013H amination/ migratory annulation cascade, we performed the reaction in the presence of 2.0 equiv. of TEMPO. The yield was slightly decreased from 93% to 82% (Scheme 2e). Further, cyclization from a preformed amination product 1a0 furnished an almost similar yield in the presence of TEMPO. Hence, the single electron transfer (SET) process may not be involved in the migratory cyclization step. Then, we performed the time-dependent 1H NMR experiment to get a clue about the intermediate of the rearrangement reaction. We took 1a0 in a NMR tube in DMSO-d6 and 1.0 equiv. of Bz2O2 was added to it for recording the time-dependent\n1H NMR spectra at room temperature (Fig. 2). Aer 5\u20137 min, a new peak corresponding to Hb or Hb0 appeared at 8.71, which was slowly decreased and nally diminished while the desired product was formed. In this study, the chemical shi of the ortho proton of pyridine (Ha) in 1a0 is indicative of the formation of intermediate VII or VIIa0, which gradually shied to more upeld in the intermediates and then in the product (Hd). It indicates that the electron-withdrawing effect of the amide-carbonyl is no longer persists in the intermediate pointing either of the intermediates VII or VIIa0 (Hb or Hb0). Since the chemical shi value in the intermediate is closer to the product than the starting material, we assume that the new C\u2013N bond may already have been formed, which is in favor of the intermediate VIIa0 (for full spectrum, see the ESI\u2020).\nA CuI/CuIII cycle may be involved in this cascade reaction as reported by the Li, Gaunt, Stahl, and other groups.25 Based on control experiments and the above literature reports, Cu(II) salt rst undergoes disproportionation to form an active CuI species, which undergoes oxidative addition toO-benzoylhydroxylamine 2\nFig. 2 Time-dependent 1H NMR experiment.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

This complex chelates with the substrate 1 or 3 forming II, which then undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution type reaction generating III. Similarly, intermediate IVmay also form under metal-free conditions. The pyridine of the picolinamide may work as a proton shuttle that abstracts ortho proton and delivers to the amide nitrogen during rearomatization through V providing ortho amination products VI. Next, a tetrahedral intermediate VII may form through the intramolecular attack of the amine moiety to the amide/thioamide carbonyl group. The nucleophilic nitrogenmay attack at the ipso position of the pyridine moiety in the presence of the second molecule of the CuIII-complex I, forming VIIa that explains the need for an excess (2.5 equiv.) amount of O-benzoylhydroxylamine.26 A similar kind of an intermediate, VIIa0 may generate in the presence of Bz2O2 in the metal-free pathway. This kind of a three-membered cyclic intermediate is claimed by the Feng group for aryl migration.27 A similar O / C pyridyl migration through the de-aromatization of the pyridine ring was reported.28 Then, a 1,2-pyridyl migration from C / N may take place to furnish the corresponding benzimidazolone product 3 and regenerates the active CuI species. VIIa0 also furnishes the product in a similar fashion. It is further supported by the fact that electron-donating substitution (e.g. ethyl, isopropyl in case of\nScheme 3 Proposed reaction mechanism.\nChem.

However, the tert-Bu group may hinder the reaction slightly due to steric inhibition. Owing to the distinct reactivity of thiol than the corresponding oxygen analogue,29 a putative 4-membered cyclic intermediate VIIb may form with thiophilic copper from the tetrahedral thiolate intermediate (Scheme 3). Subsequently, the elimination of hydrogen sulphide provides the thermodynamically favourable benzimidazoles (5) regenerating Cu(II). However, the exact mechanism is not clear at this moment and warrants further studies.\nOur efforts to utilize the pendant pyridine moiety for further C\u2013H functionalization (thioarylation, alkynylation) at the periposition remained unsuccessful at this moment. However, to expand the synthetic utility of this migratory annulation cascade, the pyridine and pyrazine moieties were deprotected from the representative benzimidazolones (3a, 3ag) using a reported condition providing 8a and 8b in 70% and 55% yield, respectively (Scheme 4).30 The free \u2013NH moiety can be further manipulated to achieve further molecular diversity."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated a directing group-dependent complete switch of product selectivity in copper-catalyzed electrophilic C\u2013H amination with protected primary amines. The benzimidazolones are formed via an unprecedented electrophilic ortho C\u2013H amination with primary amines, intramolecular cyclization, and 1,2-directing group migration from carbon to the nitrogen center. Remarkably, one C\u2013H and C\u2013C bond cleavage and three new C\u2013N bond formations take place in a single operation in this migratory annulation cascade. Strikingly, by changing the picolinamide directing group to the corresponding thiopicolinamide, the chemoselectivity is switched to form 2-pyridylbenzimidazoles via the extrusion of H2S. Inexpensive copper catalyst, scale-up synthesis, low catalyst loading, and controlled scaffold diversication are some of the practical aspects of this tandem reaction. From the preliminary studies, the benzimidazolone product was also obtained in good tomoderate yields in two steps under metalfree conditions. The in-depth mechanistic studies and investigation of metal-free conditions of this divergent tandem reaction is undergoing in our laboratory."
