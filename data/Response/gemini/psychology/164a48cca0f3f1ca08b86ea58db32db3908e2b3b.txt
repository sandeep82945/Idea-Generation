1. **Investigate the antihypertensive and antidiabetic effects of AW6 in vivo.** Animal models of hypertension and diabetes could be used to evaluate the efficacy of AW6 in lowering blood pressure and improving glucose tolerance. This would provide valuable information on the potential therapeutic applications of AW6.


2. **Study the structure-activity relationship of AW6 and its derivatives.** By synthesizing and testing a series of AW6 analogs, researchers could identify the structural features that are essential for its ACEI and DPP4I activities. This information could be used to design more potent and selective AW6 derivatives.


3. **Explore the use of AW6 in combination with other antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs.** AW6 could be combined with other drugs to improve their efficacy and reduce their side effects. For example, AW6 could be combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs to lower blood pressure, or it could be combined with metformin or insulin to improve glucose control.


4. **Develop AW6-based functional foods and nutraceuticals.** AW6 could be incorporated into functional foods and nutraceuticals to improve their health benefits. For example, AW6 could be added to yogurt, milk, or protein bars to enhance their antihypertensive and antidiabetic properties.


5. **Investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of AW6 in humans.** Clinical trials would be needed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of AW6 in humans. This would involve administering AW6 to healthy volunteers and patients with hypertension or diabetes and monitoring their blood pressure, glucose levels, and other health parameters over a period of time.
