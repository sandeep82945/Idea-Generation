Given the extensive and detailed nature of the text you've provided, which appears to be a comprehensive review or a section of a research paper discussing various aspects of hydrogels and cross-linking agents, it's clear that the focus is on comparing and analyzing the use of natural versus synthetic cross-linking agents in the preparation of hydrogels for various applications. However, specific sentences or portions explicitly mentioning future research directions are not directly quoted in the provided text.

To extract future research directions from such a detailed and technical text, one would typically look for phrases like "future studies should," "further research is needed," "more work is required," or similar expressions that indicate areas where current knowledge is lacking or where the authors of the paper believe additional investigation could be fruitful. Since these specific phrases or clear indications of future research directions are not present in the text you've provided, it's challenging to extract direct quotes without more context or additional sections of the paper that might explicitly discuss future research directions.

If you have specific sections of the paper that discuss future research directions or if there are sentences within the provided text that hint at future studies but are not explicitly labeled as such, please highlight those for a more targeted extraction.
