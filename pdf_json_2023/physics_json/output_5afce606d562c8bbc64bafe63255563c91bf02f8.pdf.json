    "abstractText": "Cyclic anthraquinone derivatives (cAQs), which link two side chains of 1,5-disubstituted anthraquinone as a threading DNA intercalator, have been developed as G-quartet (G4) DNA-specific ligands. Among the cAQs, cAQ-mBen linked through the 1,3-position of benzene had the strongest affinity for G4 recognition and stabilization in vitro and was confirmed to bind to the G4 structure in vivo, selectively inhibiting cancer cell proliferation in correlation with telomerase expression levels and triggering cell apoptosis. RNA-sequencing analysis further indicated that differentially expressed genes regulated by cAQ-mBen were profiled with more potential quadruplexforming sequences. In the treatment of the tumor-bearing mouse model, cAQ-mBen could effectively reduce tumor tissue and had less adverse effects on healthy tissue. These results suggest that cAQ-mBen can be a potential cancer therapeutic agent as a G4 binder.",

            "text": "Classical chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice for\nmany malignancies that cannot be cured solely by surgery, which\ncan be best used by understanding the principles of pharmacol-\nogy, tumor biology, and drug resistance (1, 2). Unfortunately,\nchemotherapy drugs, such as some DNA alkylating agents and\nintercalating agents, indiscriminately kill tumor and normal cells\nalike and cause several adverse effects, including bone marrow\nsuppression, gastrointestinal problems, and alopecia (3). Hence, targeted therapies are now a component of many types of cancer therapeutics. Combining conventional chemotherapy\nwith targeted cancer therapy may result in a more catastrophic\ncell kill in tumors than in healthy tissues and avoid the development of primary or secondary resistance (4, 5). Regarding targeted cancer therapy, except for the well-known mutant kinase or particular cancer microenvironment targeting (6\u20138), expression abnormalities of some specific genes, such as the MYC oncogene, which drives increased cellular proliferation, and TERT, which accelerates the activity of telomerase in elongating telomere DNA, are also highly correlated with carcinogenesis and could be promising targets for cancer-selective therapy (9\u201311).\nWith the increasing progress of genome sequence profiling, a higher order DNA structure, formed from Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding of guanines to form stacked quartets, also termed the G-quadruplex (G4) structure, was identified as comprehensively\nic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/7/pgad211/7205819 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nlocated and formed in the promoter regions of the abovementioned cancer-related genes and could be involved in the regulation of gene expression and transcription (12\u201314). Furthermore, telomere DNA consists of repeating TTAGGG elements and can adopt multiple G4 structures, which physically inhibit the activity of telomerase and lead to antitumor effects (15, 16). Small molecules can stabilize G4 DNAs, thus causing transcription repression and triggering cancer cell apoptosis because of the functional relationship between telomeres, oncogenes, and cancer; therefore, this is a promising targeted chemotherapeutic strategy (17\u201324). Several molecules have been developed and identified as G4 binders, through their interaction with the G4 plane (25). However, the selectivity issues of the G4 binder interacting with particular G4 structures and exhibiting selective bioactivity for tumor cells remain incompletely explored (26).\nNaphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives are known to form stable complexes with duplex DNA by threading intercalation and have been expected to be an anticancer agent. Recently, they have been shown to bind strongly to both an electron-deficient NDI aromatic plane and electron-rich G4 plane, providing a mechanism for their anticancer activity (27\u201329). The performance of disubstituted NDI as anticancer agents has been improved by making them tri- or tetra-substituted, thereby inhibiting their binding to duplex DNA and increasing their specificity to G4 (29). We have successfully synthesized a cyclic NDI by linking two substituent positions of a di-substituted NDI. The cyclic form of the NDI prevents the duplex DNA from binding in a stitched fashion due to steric hindrance, thereby realizing G4-specific binding (28).\nAnother well-known DNA-threading intercalators, namely, anthraquinone derivatives with two substituents above and below their long axis (AQs), shows a preference for GC base pairs and disrupts DNA replication and transcription (30). Its derivatives such as doxorubicin and nogalamycin have been adopted as classical chemo-cancer therapeutic drugs but have been associated with some adverse effects such as cardiomyopathy (31, 32). AQ, like NDI, is also a G4-binding agent. It can act and is frequently reported to be effective as a telomerase inhibitor by recognizing and stabilizing the G4 structure (33\u201335).\nThis study will clarify whether G4 specificity can be expressed by cyclic AQ (Fig. 1a) and open up the possibility of anticancer agents (Fig. 1b). Here, we reported three cyclic AQ derivatives (cAQs) and investigated their G4-binding affinity and stabilization effect using UV-Vis plus Scatchard plot analysis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and a melting temperature assay. Their performance in inhibiting telomerase activity was evaluated by using an in vitro telomerase repeated amplification protocol (TRAP) assay."

            "text": "cAQ-mBen might be a promising G4-selective binder Three cAQs were prepared with different cyclic substituents, and the noncyclic anthraquinone AQ-ac was adopted as a control molecule, with an acetylated amino terminus to avoid free amino group induced\u2013biased comparison. The synthesis and verifying information is provided in the experimental section (Figs. 1a and S1\u2013S5). UV-Vis titrations were performed to investigate the interaction of these AQ derivatives with G4 and double-stranded oligonucleotide (ds-oligo; Figs. 2a, S6\u2013S8, and Table S1). All derivatives showed hypochromic effects and red shifts with G4 and ds-oligo. All derivatives could be analyzed by Scatchard analysis in the\ninteraction with G4 using absorbance changes; however, the ds-oligo was analyzed in a Benesi\u2013Hildebrand plot because the absorbance of the complex was not clear, except for the acyclic AQ-ac. Although the exact binding capacity for ds-oligo could not be determined, it was suggested that the cAQ derivative exhibits hundreds of times higher G4 specificity than ds-oligo. Adding these AQ derivatives to telomere G4 with potassium ion, cAQs induced a shift in CD spectra with increased intensity around 245 and 288 nm and decreased intensity around 257 nm (Figs. 2b and S9). A similar phenomenon has been reported in a previous anthraquinone study (36); cAQ-mBen induced the most significant CD shift, indicating a stronger G4 structure strain might be generated because of cAQ binding.\nThen, CD-based melting temperature measurements investigated the stabilization effects of AQ derivatives for G4 and ds-oligo. Interestingly, for telomere G4 within 100 mM K+, AQ-Ac did not stabilize its structure, cAQ-C2 and cAQ-ch enhanced the melting temperature by 2.8\u00b0C, and cAQ-mBen led to the strongest stabilization and enhanced the melting temperature by 8.8\u00b0C. For telomere G4 within 100 mM Na+, cAQ-mBen was still able to induce a stronger stabilization for G4 than other AQ derivatives (Figs. 2c, d, S10, and Table S2). According to the molecular model created using Molecular Operating Environment (37), when cAQ-mBen recognizes telomere G4 (PDB, 2GKU), the cyclic structure of cAQ-mBen serves as a pocket for adenine insertion, and the meta-benzene part can also form a hydrogen bond with the nucleic base, enhancing the binding affinity of cAQ-mBen for G4 (Fig. 2e). Considering that cAQ-mBen also demonstrated the highest binding constant, cAQ-mBen is a promising G4-selective binder with enhanced affinity for recognizing and stabilizing G4 structures.\ncAQ-mBen inhibited telomerase activity in vitro and recognized G4 in vivo AQ derivatives stabilize the G4 structure and further inhibit the function of telomerase. Here, a classical gel shift assay was combined with TRAP assay to investigate the telomerase inhibition ability of these AQ derivatives (32, 35, 36). Upon increasing the concentration of AQs, telomere DNA elongation was inhibited, as seen by the decreases in shifting bands (Fig. 3a). Consistent with the results obtained for the melting temperature measurement, cAQ-mBen displayed the strongest inhibition ability, which induced a significant inhibition of telomere DNA elongation, whereas cAQ-C2 and cAQ-ch and AQ-Ac inhibited telomerase activity marginally. This finding indicated that the ability of G4 binder to stabilize telomerase G4 could be a positive factor for further inhibiting telomerase activity. Therefore, cAQ-mBen was considered to have a higher potential to interfere with the function of telomerase and induce a shorter length of telomere DNA. Nevertheless, AQ-Ac did not significantly influence the telomere DNA elongation within 10 \u00b5M, but the continuous increasing concentration of AQ-Ac might cause DNA aggregation and disturb the DNA gel shift (Fig. S11). Furthermore, cAQ-mBen, cAQ-C2, and cAQ-ch did not inhibit PCR up to 50, 150, and 150 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. S11), indicating weak interaction with duplex DNA. This result is in agreement with the binding results based on UV-Vis measurements (Fig. 2a, Table S1).\nTo examine whether cAQ-mBen can recognize G4 DNA in the cells, we performed a G4 binder competition assay with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy according to a previous report (38). The G4 DNA was revealed by o-BMVC, a G4 fluorescent probe, to selectively recognize the G4 structure. The pretreatment of\n2 | PNAS Nexus, 2023, Vol. 2, No. 7 D\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/7/pgad211/7205819 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nHeLa cells with cAQ-mBen resulted in a 65% reduction in the number of o-BMVC foci in the nucleus (Fig. 3b and c), indicating that cAQ-mBen could block the subsequent binding of o-BMVC to G4s, similar to previous findings for other G4-binding molecules (39). The results have established that cAQ-mBen could bind to G4 DNA in the cells.\ncAQ-mBen selectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation The cell proliferation assay was performed with several cell lines, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated to clarify whether these AQ derivatives have the potential to selectively inhibit only tumor cell proliferation (Table 1, Fig. S12). cAQ-mBen showed a potent ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation with IC50 values generally <1 \u00b5M and less toxicity to normal cells such as freshly prepared primary mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) and cell lines derived from healthy\ntissue (IC50 > 6 \u00b5M), especially the IC50 for HeLa was only 0.3 \u00b5M, which was almost 20-fold lower than for normal cells. The other\ntwo cAQ derivatives, cAQ-C2 and cAQ-ch, showed comparable\nG4-binding affinity but weaker telomere G4 stabilization effect\nand telomerase inhibition ability, with unsatisfactory results in\nterms of inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and differentiating\ncancer and normal cells. Moreover, AQ-Ac could selectively in-\nhibit the proliferation of cancer cell lines and not normal cells.\nHere we also compared the inhibitory effect of AQs with cisplatin\n(cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), CDDP), one of the most com-\nmonly used cancer chemotherapeutic drugs (40). However, the\nDNA-damaging agent CDDP showed comparable or even stronger\ninhibitory effect on the proliferation of healthy cells than that of\ncancer cell lines such as Ca9-22 and SAS cells (Table 1, Fig. S12),\nwhich further demonstrated that cAQ-mBen has a superior effect\non cancer-selective growth inhibition as a G4-targeted agent.\nO\nO\nCl\nCl\nN H2N NH2 O\nO\nHN\nNH\nN NH2\nN NH2\nHO OH\nO\nO OH\nO HO\nO\nOH\nO HO\nO\nOH\nO\nO\nO\nHN\nNH\nN N H\nN N H\nO\nO\nO\nO\nHN\nNH\nN\nHN\nN H N\nO\nO\nO\nO\nHN\nHN\nN\nHN\nN N H O\nO\nO\nO\nHN\nHN\nN\nNH\nN H N\nO\nO\nAQ-Ac cAQ-C2 cAQ-ch cAQ-mBen\nTreatment with cAQ-mBen desaercedemulovromuTecimedungniraeb-romuT\nCancer cell apoptosis G4 recognition and stabilization Telomerase inhibition Telomere elongation\nTelomer cAQ-mBen\na\nb\nFig. 1.

Unexpectedly, no gene expression fluctuation was observed after AQ-Ac treatment; however, cAQ-mBen treatment markedly induced differential gene expression (Data set Fig. 4; PNASNEXUS-PNASNEXUS-2023-00340Rs05.xlsx. More differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after 5 \u03bcM cAQ-mBen treatment than after 1 \u03bcM cAQ-mBen treatment and at 24 h than at 6 h. For all cAQ-mBen treatment conditions, 262 DEGs (3.5%) were obtained (Fig. 4a).\nTo further investigate possible correlations between cAQ-mBen-induced gene expression modulation and the G4 region, the potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) of the genome were predicted using G4Hunter (41). The distribution of the numbers of PQS on the promoter region (from \u22121 to 1 kb) and gene body was compared between upregulated and downregulated genes after cAQ-mBen treatment under various conditions (Fig. 4b). The numbers of PQS in DEGs were higher than those in all genes in the background. For the promoter, the distribution of PQS in the gene with downregulated expression was slightly larger than that in the gene with upregulated expression at 6 h; however, at 24 h, the difference had almost disappeared.\nFor the gene body, when 5 \u00b5M of cAQ-mBen was added, the distribution of PQS in the genes with downregulated expression was larger than that in the genes with upregulated expression at both 6 and 24 h, whereas there were minor differences after 1 \u00b5M cAQ-mBen treatment.\nAccording to the results of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis (Fig. 4c), for genes with upregulated expression, cancer-related pathways, virus infection\u2013related pathways, p53-signaling pathways, apoptosis, and cellular senescence involved in tumor suppressor pathways were highly enriched. In contrast, genes with downregulated expression were enriched in many pathways involved in diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and prion disease. These pathways were associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which occurs inside the mitochondrion. Figure 4d shows the expression levels and the number of PQS on the genes that are related to telomere extension by telomerase, which is identified as R-HSA-171319 in the Reactome database (42), such as TERT and POT1; these results indicate that cAQ-mBen affects the biogenesis and assembly of the telomerase RNP and their recruitment to the telomeric chromosome end.\ncAQ-mBen inhibited cell proliferation in correlation with TERT expression and induced cancer cell apoptosis Subsequently, to address whether the inhibitory effect of cAQ-mBen is correlated with telomerase activity inhibition, we\na b\nc d e\nFig. 2.

In the normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and BMCs, both of which were primarily prepared cells from healthy tissues, the human TERT or mouse Tert mRNA expression was hardly detected compared with that in the human cancer cell line Ca9-22 or immortalized mouse cell lines MC3T3-E1, respectively (Fig. 5a), and a clear stronger cell proliferation inhibition was observed for Ca9-22 than for the other two primary cells from healthy tissues (Fig. 5b). Then, we investigated the relationship between the expression level of TERT and the effect of cAQ-mBen in four different human cancer cell lines. The mRNA expression levels of TERT in Ca9-22 and HeLa cells were significantly higher than those in HEK293 and HSC-2 cells (Fig. 5c). Proliferation of all cancer cells was inhibited in a dosedependent manner that was positively correlated with the TERT expression level in these cell lines, indicating that cAQ-mBen potently inhibited the proliferation of telomerase-active cell lines (Fig. 5d).\nSince cAQ-mBen inhibited cell growth with higher specificity in cancer cells than normal cells and gene expression profile in the RNA-Seq analysis indicated the state of apoptosis after cAQ-mBen treatment in these cell lines, we sought to determine whether the potent cell proliferation inhibitory effect was mediated through induction of cell death or not. Tumor cell line SAS was incubated with cAQ-mBen or CDDP (as a positive control) and then subjected to an annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)-staining assay. When the cells were incubated with 5 \u00b5M of cAQ-mBen for 24 h, around 10.5% of the cells were positive for annexin V (representing the cells in the early apoptotic stages) and 10.9% of the total cells were positive for PI signal (which stains necrotic cells), both were at a comparable level\nwith that of SAS incubated with 50 \u00b5M CDDP (24.0 and 18.5%, respectively; Fig. 5e).\nRNA-Seq analysis suggested that cAQ-mBen regulated many caspase-related genes; regarding the protein level, after 5 \u00b5M cAQ-mBen or 50 \u00b5M CDDP treatment, the digestion of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and caspase-3 was observed in a time-dependent manner, i.e. intact forms of both PARP-1 and caspase-3 were decreased along with increasing amount of cleaved PARP-1 (Fig. 5f). These results further suggested that cAQ-mBen could induce cancer cell apoptosis.\ncAQ-mBen suppressed tumor growth without obvious adverse effect in a mouse xenograft model We next investigated the effect of cAQ-mBen on tumor growth and its adverse effects in vivo, with continuous adaptation of CDDP as a chemotherapeutic control. Stable SAS cell mouse xenograft models were prepared in our laboratory for evaluation. Based on the potent antitumor effects observed with cAQ-mBen in the cell viability assays, 3 \u00b5mol/kg of cAQ-mBen and 30 \u00b5mol/ kg of CDDP were utilized for treating tumor-bearing mice. The tumor volume continuously increased without treatment; however, the increase in the tumor volume was significantly suppressed in mice treated with cAQ-mBen and CDDP (Fig. 6a, b and S13). The effect of cAQ-mBen on suppressing tumor growth was comparable with that of CDDP despite the use of a 10-fold lower dose than CDDP. Although CDDP considerably reduced the body weight of mice, cAQ-mBen barely affected the body weight throughout the study period (Figs. 6c and S13).\nCDDP is known to induce a pathological change in the liver and kidney of mice: the shape of the central vein of the liver becomes irregular, the size of the glomerulus becomes smaller, and the cell\n0 \u2013 10 \u00b5M\nAQ-Ac cAQ-mBencAQ-C2 cAQ-ch\nM T H N 0 \u2013 10 \u00b5M 0 \u2013 10 \u00b5M 0 \u2013 10 \u00b5M\na\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nA ve\nra ge\nfo ci\n(p er\nnu cl\nue s)\nHeLa cell (n = 38) w/o cAQ-mBen (n = 33)\nb c\nFig. 3. cAQ-mBen inhibits telomerase activity in vitro and recognizes G-quadruplex in vivo. a) Telomerase activity inhibition by AQ derivatives in a TRAP assay.

In our evaluation, similar pathological changes in the liver and kidney including significant condensation of the glomerulus area were observed in mice treated with CDDP (Fig. 6d and e). In contrast, no histopathological changes were observed in the liver of mice treated with cAQ-mBen. The cell arrangement and the size of the glomerulus in the kidney of cAQ-mBen-treated mice were also not affected (Fig. 6d and e). Moreover, CDDP treatment led\nto a substantial increase in various physiological indices (BUN, UA, AST, ALT, CRE, and \u03b3-GTP levels), as seen by performing biochemical examination of the blood serum samples, indicating damage to the liver and kidney. However, no significant differences in terms of these indices were observed between cAQ-mBen treatment and negative control groups, indicating that cAQ-mBen did not affect these organs (Fig. 6f, Table S3). These results suggest that cAQ-mBen shows a strong suppressing effect on\nTable 1. Cytotoxicity of AQ derivatives for different cell lines."

In particular, cAQ-mBen showed the highest stabilizing effect on telomeric G4 and the strongest inhibition of telomerase activity. o-BMVC competition experiments showed that cAQ-mBen is taken up into cells simply by adding it to cells and binds to the nuclear G4 site. Furthermore,\nit showed excellent potential to selectively inhibit tumor cell growth.\nG4 targeting has been considered one potential strategy for targeted cancer therapy; many G4 ligands and some ligand multimers have been developed for G4 recognition in vitro and in vivo. Some previously reported small molecule inhibitors of rDNA transcription mediate their function by interacting with the G4 structure (19). However, most of these molecules continue to be investigated in vitro, and only a few reports of satisfactory antitumor effects were obtained in clinical trials (45, 46). Binding affinity and structure stabilization are two important in vitro factors to assess the performance of the G4 ligand for G4 targeting. However, some G4 ligands demonstrated promising potential for G4\n0 20 40 60 80\n100 120 140 160 180\nTE R\nT m\nR N\nA e\nxp re\nss io n (% o f H E K 29 3)\na\nb,c\na\na\nb,c d\nba\nc\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\nC el\nl V ia\nbi lit\ny (%\no f c\non tr\nol )\n0\nCa9-22 BMC NHEK\nNS\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 A nn ex in V /P I po si tiv e ce lls (% )\n*** * e f\n35\n48\n75\n0 012 24 12 24\ncAQ-mBen\nTime (h)\nCDDP\nkDa Intact PARP\nCleaved PARP\nIntact Caspase-3\n-actin\n116\ncAQ-mBen ( M)\nTERT\nACTB\nTert\nActb\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\nC el\nl V ia\nbi lit\ny (%\no f c\non tr\nol )\ncAQ-mBen ( M)\nHeLa SAS HEK293 HSC-2\nCa9-22\nannexin V-FITC staining\nannexin V-FITC and PI staining\nFig. 5. cAQ-mBen inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis. a) Expression of human TERT or mouse Tert mRNA in the primarily prepared normal cells\u2014NHEKs and mouse BMCs\u2014was compared with those of tumor-derived or immortalized cell lines\u2014human gingival carcinoma cell line (Ca9-22) and mouse osteoblast-like cell line (MC3T3-E1) by general PCR. b) Cell viabilities of NEHK, BMCs, and Ca9-22 cells treated with the indicated concentrations of cAQ-mBen for 48 h.

The in vitro and in vivo evaluation gap is a conceivable but straightforward issue for chemo-targeted cancer therapeutic research.\nPreviously, other studies on AQ derivatives, with selectivity similar to that of cAQ-C2 and cAQ-ch but lower G4 stabilization effects, also showed the same unsatisfactory inhibition of cancer cell growth (38). However, cAQ-mBen could potently stabilize G4 structures over other cAQs and demonstrated excellent specificity for antitumor growth, indicating that this stabilization effect might be essential to its therapeutic effects. However, it is impossible to conclude that its stabilization effect is the key factor in its being a potential G4 binder. Finding the right trade-off between affinity and selectivity of G4 ligand remains an object of study in the design of G4 ligands (22). Moreover, AQ-ac also demonstrated comparable performance in selectively inducing cancer cell death, but the anticancer cell proliferation effect was not correlated with\ntelomerase-activity-related TERT mRNA expression levels. Regarding the poor ability of AQ-Ac to selectively differentiate and stabilize G4 and the observed AQ-Ac-induced DNA aggregation, AQ-ac was considered to have an anticancer effect as a GC base pair-preferring DNA intercalator rather than as a G4 binder.\nAfter cAQ-mBen treatment, the numbers of PQS in the DEGs were significantly increased in both the promoter region and gene body, suggesting that cAQ-mBen might regulate gene expression by binding to G4. PQSs were present in genes with both downregulated and upregulated expressions. The formation of G4 in the promoter does not necessarily inhibit polymerase progression and suppress gene expression. G4 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing results obtained by H\u00e4nsel-Hertsch et al. have also indicated that G4 sites show hallmarks of dynamic epigenetic features in\nC on\ntr ol\ncA Q\n-m B en C D D P\nKidneyLiver ed\nb\nB od\ny W\nei gh\nt( g)\nDays\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n**** ****\n****\n*\nc\nControl\ncAQ-mBen\nCDDP\nf\na\nControl\ncAQ-mBen\nCDDP0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50 *\nB U\nN (m\ng/ dL\n) NS *\nU A\n(m g/\ndL )\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nNS NS *\n0\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200 *\nA S\nT (I\nU /L\n)\n*NS\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nA LT\n(I U\n/L ) *\nNS *\nG lo\nm er\nul s\nar ea\n(x 10\n7 \u00b5m\n2 )\n**** NS ****\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nT um\nor V\nol um\ne (m\nm 3 )\nDays\n********\n***\n*\n**\nControl\ncAQ-mBen\nCDDP\n**** **** ****\n****\nFig. 6. cAQ-mBen suppressed tumor growth with no obvious adverse effect in a mouse xenograft model.

Therefore, in vivo, G4 may act as a promoter or repressor depending on chromatin status and other transcription factors.\nExcept for the activation of apoptosis, it was characteristic that the mitochondrial OXPHOS-related genes were downregulated at 6 and 24 h with 1 and 5 \u03bcM cAQ-mBen treatment. Mitochondria are complex organelles that influence the development, growth, survival, and metastasis of cancer cells, and many aspects of mitochondrial biology other than energy production actively contribute to tumorigenesis. Recently, the metabolic, mitochondrial, and oxidative stress vulnerabilities of cancer cells have become a focus of attention as selective targets for inducing cancer cell death (47, 48). Moreover, the regulatory roles of G4 structures in mitochondria have been drawing increasing research attention (49). Like some G4-specific binding ligands that could bind to G4 in mitochondria (50, 51), it is conceivable that cAQ-mBen reported here also bound to G4 in mitochondria and suppressed OXPHOS-related gene activity, resulting in apoptosis.\nA previous study (29, 52) reported changes in gene expression by RNA-Seq in human pancreatic cancer cell lines, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2, with the addition of NDI derivatives, CM03 and SOP1812, which are G4-binding reagents. The study showed that the G4-binding reagent downregulated many genes in the Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. However, in our study, the downregulated genes were not significantly overrepresented in the Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (cAQ-mBen, 5 \u03bcM, 6 h, 9 genes, P = 0.96; cAQ-mBen, 5 M, 24 h, 19 genes, P = 0.97). Individual gene expression changes were also different between cAQ-mBen and NDI derivatives. For example, the expression of hTERT, in which G4 is present in the promoter, was significantly downregulated once after 6 h of cAQ-mBen addition and reverted to the original level after 24 h (Fig. 4d); whereas the expression of CM03 and SOP1812 remained downregulated after 6 and 24 h, respectively. At this time, we do not know whether this is due to the difference in the cell line between human pancreatic and human tongue cancer, the difference in the G4 sequence to which the compounds bind, or some other factor.\nRegarding the antitumor activity in the mouse xenograft model, cAQ-mBen showed comparable tumor-suppressing performance to that of CDDP but significantly fewer adverse effects that were assessed. In contrast, CDDP displayed serious adverse effects on the liver, kidneys, and testis, and reduced body weight. Although the antitumor activity of cAQ-mBen on cultured cells showed a tendency to correlate with the TERT gene expression level in the cells. G4-binding ligands do not target a specific gene or protein but various locations in the genome and interact with surrounding transcription factors to promote or inhibit gene expression via multiple pathways to display antitumor effects. Owing to the still ambiguous function of G4 in vivo, it is difficult to unravel the detailed mechanism of cAQ-mBen leading to apoptosis. Investigating the genome-wide localization of G4 using G4 ChIP-Seq4 and the binding state of cAQ-mBen to the genome by applying cAQ-mBen to Chem-Seq may give more information for elucidating the underlying regulatory process (53)."
