    "abstractText": "Protein\u2013small molecule interactions naturally occur in foodstuffs, which could improve the properties of protein and small molecules. Meanwhile, they might affect the bioavailability and nutritional value of proteins. Ferritin, as an iron-storage protein, has been a focus of research. However, the complexity of foodstuffs enables the interaction between ferritin and food components, especially polyphenols, which can induce iron release from ferritin. Thus, the application of ferritin in food is limited. Inspired by the natural-occurring, strong protein\u2013polyphenol interactions in beer, to inhibit the iron release of ferritin, the malt-derived protein Z (PZ) was chosen to interact with ferulic acid (FA), an abundant reductant in malt, beer, and other foodstuffs. The analysis of the interaction between PZ and FA was carried out using fluorescence spectroscopy, the results of which suggest that one PZ molecule can bind with 22.11 \u00b1 2.13 of FA, and the binding constant is (4.99 \u00b1 2.13) \u00d7 105 M\u22121. In a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, FA was found to be embedded in the internal hydrophobic pocket of PZ, where it formed hydrogen bonds with Val-389 and Tyr-234. As expected, compared to iron release induced by FA, the iron release from donkey spleen ferritin (DSF) induced by FA decreased by 86.20% in the presence of PZ. Meanwhile, based on the PZ\u2013FA interaction, adding PZ in beer reduced iron release from DSF by 40.5% when DSF:PZ was 1:40 (molar ratio). This work will provide a novel method of inhibiting iron release from ferritin.",

            "text": "Protein\u2013small molecule interactions in nature are a universal phenomenon. For example, heme interacts with proteins in mammalian cells as part of the prosthetic group to perform its physiological functions [1]. In addition, human serum albumin could combine fatty acids for storage and transportation [2]. Interestingly, protein\u2013small molecule interactions occur commonly in foodstuffs as well, particularly protein\u2013polyphenol interactions. Such interactions could improve protein properties such as thermal stability, surface hydrophobicity, and structural stabilization, while protecting small molecules against light-, thermal-, and pH-induced damage [3\u20135]. However, protein\u2013small molecules can decrease the bioavailability and nutritional value of protein as well. Ferritin is a kind of iron storage protein, which could accommodate up to ~4500 iron atoms in the form of the iron core stored in the cavity. Natural components in foodstuffs, especially phytochemicals, could induce iron release from ferritins, such as FMNH2, FADH2, ascorbate, epigallocatechin gallate, and other phenolic acids [6\u201312]. The released iron could cause quality deterioration of food such as iron smell and discoloration. In addition, it is reported that under the reaction of ferritin with reductants, the cleavage and mutation of DNA increased via a Fenton reaction of free iron ions released from ferritin [13]. To prevent iron release, we chose beer as a reducing agent and fabricated a donkey spleen ferritin\u2013pectin complex with electrostatic interaction in previous research, and the iron release from ferritin in beer was significantly reduced by 52.68% [14]. However,\nFoods 2023, 12, 234. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12020234 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 234 2 of 12\nexogenous pectin additives are unstable, which might increase the viscosity and affect the taste of food. Therefore, selecting natural-occurring components that can form a stable complex with phytochemicals and reduce iron release is of vital importance. Ferulic acid (FA), as a major hydroxycinnamic acid, is widely distributed in plant foods, especially in coffee, wheat bran, barley malt, and beer [15\u201318]. FA is the most abundant phenolic acid in beer, the contents of which range from 83.9 \u00b1 0.35 to 296.02 \u00b1 4.88 \u00b5g/100 mL [18,19]. Meanwhile, ferulic acid has been proven to induce ferritin to release iron [14]. Of all the interactions in beer components, the protein\u2013polyphenol interaction contributes an important role in beer\u2019s stability, flavor, and visual appearance. Inspired by the protein\u2013 polyphenol interactions occurring in beer, it is possible to find a kind of protein that can bind with ferulic acid naturally. Proteinaceous materials in beer primarily originates from malt, and proteins are essential for the quality of beer [20]. Among them, ~9 kDa lipid transfer protein (LTP) and ~43 kDa protein Z (PZ) stay soluble and have shown good stability in resisting proteolysis and heating [21]. Former research has demonstrated that LTP1 interacts with polyphenols via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The high level of proline residues in LTP1 makes it possible to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups in polyphenols due to the exposed carbonyl oxygens in the protein backbone [22]. The primary protein in beer is PZ, which comes from barley malt. In addition to its role in maintaining foam stability, it functions in physiological metabolism such as inflammation, coagulation, thrombosis, and immunity. Recently, researchers have concentrated on PZ as a promising carrier; so far, PZ as a carrier has enhanced the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of xanthohumol, curcumin, and other bioactive compounds [23\u201325]. Based on previous research, we supposed that the naturally occurring protein PZ in beer might interact with ferulic acid to reduce iron release from ferritin. However, the interaction between ferulic acid and PZ is lacking. In this study, we extracted and purified the PZ derived from barley malt and explored the interaction between PZ and FA using fluorescence spectroscopy, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectra, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In order to understand how specifically FA interacts with PZ, molecular dynamics (MD) was used to analyze potential binding sites and forces. Finally, iron release from the donkey spleen was evaluated in the presence of PZ. It is hoped that this work may shed light on the interaction between food components and the prevention of iron release from ferritin."

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was explored, as previously reported [25]. MD analysis of the PZ\u2013FA interaction was performed using the AMBER 18, based on ff14sb and GAFF2 force fields, respectively [28\u201330]. After that, hydrogen atoms were added to the simulated system, which was put into a truncated octahedral TIP3P solvent box with an edge length 10 \u00c5 from the edge of the simulation box. Following this, Na+ and Cl+ ions sufficient for system charge equilibrium were added. To minimize the system energy, the steepest descent algorithm and the conjugate gradient algorithm, both for 2500 steps, were used before MD simulations. After the minimization step, heating simulation was performed by linearly increasing the temperature (200 ps) from 0 K to 298.15 K at a constant volume. Then, the system was equilibrated by keeping the system for 500 ps NVT simulation at 298.15 K and 500 ps NPT simulation. Then, MD simulations were conducted at NPT for each system for 100 ns. The truncation distance of non-bond interaction was set at 10 \u00c5, and the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was used to calculate the longrange electrostatic interaction [31,32].

The iron release system (0.5 mL) induced by beer contains beer, DSF (0.1 \u03bcM), and ferrozine (0.5 mM) with a different molar ratio tha PZ. To exclude the influence of PZ and as a buffer to iron measurement, the FeSO4 standard curve was obtained in the absence f DSF, and the groups contained control checks, buffers without PZ, and buffers with 14.5 \u03bcM of PZ. The control check contained 10\u201350 \u03bcM of FeSO4 nd 0.5 mM of ferrozine, while o r reaction systems tained 10~50 \u03bcM of FeSO4, 320 \u03bcM of FA, 50 mM of citrate, and 0.5 mM of ferrozine in the presence and absence of PZ.

FRET could happen as a result of the overlap between the fluorescence emission spectra of the donor and the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of the acceptor, and the distance is 2\u20138 nm [41]. As expected, there is good overlapping between the fluorescence emission spectrum of PZ and the absorption spectra of FA (Figure 3), indicating the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PZ and FA.

As shown in Figure 4A,B, the synchronous fluorescence intensity of Tyr (\u0394\u03bb = 15 nm) and Trp (\u0394\u03bb = 60 nm) decreased gradually with the addition of FA, indicating that the conformation of PZ was changed, and both Tyr and Trp residues were involved in the quenching of the intrinsic\nFigure 3.

Effects of FA Binding on PZ Structure\nDespite the effect of FA binding on the tertiary structure of PZ, synchronous fluorescence spectra could provide the changes of the tertiary structure on Tyr and Trp residues when the \u2206\u03bb value is set at 15 nm or 60 nm, respectively [43]. As shown in Figure 4A,B, the synchronous fluorescence intensity of Tyr (\u2206\u03bb = 15 nm) and Trp (\u2206\u03bb = 60 nm) decreased gradually with the addition of FA, indicating that the conformation of PZ was changed, and both Tyr and Trp residues were involved in the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence within PZ. Compared to Tyr, the decrease in synchronous fluorescence intensity on Trp is more significant, suggesting that the binding site of the PZ\u2013FA interaction was close to Trp residues. This result is in accordance with that calculated from FRET. Furthermore, a red shift of the Trp residue fluorescence spectra (from 277 to 283) was observed, which reveals that the polarity around the tryptophan residues was more hydrophilic.\nFoods 2023, 12, 234 7 of 12\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12 fluorescence within PZ.

This result is in accordance with that calculated from FRET. Furthermore, a red shift of the Trp residue fluorescence spectra (from 277 to 283) was observed, which reveals that the polarity around the tryptophan residues was more hydrophilic.\nIn addition, the effect of FA on the secondary structure has been identified. Figure 4C shows the far-UV CD spectra of PZ in the absence and presence of FA, and there were two negative bands around 208 and 222 nm as well as a strong positive band at 200 nm, which is the characteristic of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet structures [44]. However, after the addition of FA, the negative ellipticity, the shape of the peaks, and the position of the peak maximum did not change, which illustrated that the binding of FA did not change the secondary structure of PZ.\nFigure 4.

MD Analysis MD analysis was performed to obtain the potential PZ\u2013FA binding sites and forces related to their interactions, which was on the basis of lowest energy conformation from molecular docking. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) can reflect the motion process of the protein\u2013small molecule complex, and the fluctuation means the motion is violent; otherwise, the motion is stable. The RMSD of the active sites of PZ [45] was monitored, and it is worth noting that the active sites tended to be stabilized with FA binding, which indicated that the FA molecule could stabilize the site, and there is a good binding effect between PZ and FA (Figure 5A). The binding free energy predicted using the MM-GBSA method was (\u221225.20 \u00b1 2.18) kcal/mol (Table S1), which implied that FA could form an affinity with PZ. Additionally, the leading contribution of PZ\u2013FA binding is van der Waals energy (\u221228.88 \u00b1 2.04 kcal/mol), followed by electrostatic energy (\u221221.30 \u00b1 2.77 kcal/mol), and then the non-polar contribution to solvation (\u22124.61 \u00b1 0.05 kcal/mol). This result correlated well with the ovalbumin\u2013FA interactions, and its binding free energy reached \u221226.78 kcal/mol [46]. For further analysis of binding energy, we explored the contribution of amino acids to binding. As shown in Figure S1, residues Val 337, Phe 388, Glu 338, Val 389, Phe 376, Ala 39, Ile 378, Phe 182, Val 339, and Met 245 are the ten amino acids that contribute the most to the binding of PZ\u2013FA, particularly Val 337 and Phe 388.\nFigure 4.

At 60 min, they released 0.16 \u00b5M, 0.67 \u00b5M, and 0.82 \u00b5M iron, respectively, which is much lower than FA without PZ (1.16 \u00b5M).

When PZ: FA was at 1:22, the content of iron release was the least, suggesting that the PZ\u2013FA interaction effectively inhibited the iron release. In our study, the iron release from DSF was not inhibited efficiently at the ratio of 1:11 (PZ and FA), which may be due to the fact that PZ molecules may assemble together when concentration increases, and thus affected the interaction between PZ and ferulic acid.\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 12 bind 22 FA molecules, the molar ratios of PZ and FA were chosen at 1:11, 1:22, 1:44, and 1:66. To evaluate the initial rate of iron release, the kinetic curve was fitted using a thirdorder equation based on the previous report: Y = A0 + A1t + A2t2 + A3t3 and dY/dt = A1+ 2A2t + 3A3t2 (at t = 0, (dY/dt)0 = v0).

The beer contained plenty of polyphenols such as gallic acid, salicylic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid [48]. Thus, we further tested the inhibition effect of PZ in beer systems. As shown in Figure 6B\u2013D, the amount of released iron reached 1.78 \u03bcM, 0.92 \u03bcM, and 0.88 \u03bcM with DSF: PZ at 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40, and the iron release decreased by 11.52%, 33.42%, and 40.5%, respectively. Inspired by this, the addition of stable beer-occurring PZ would interact with the polyphenols, by which the iron release could be prevented. The inhibition of iron release is meaningful for the application of ferritin. It will protect sensitive components in food substances, such as lipids, from oxidation and degradation by Fe2+, which contributes to an iron smell and discoloration.\nThe beer contained plenty of polyphenols such as gallic acid, salicylic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid [48].

            "text": "Protein\u2013small molecule interactions commonly occur in foodstuffs, which could lead to either benefits or harm to the quality of food. Ferritin is vulnerable to iron release by multiple reductants in food, which makes it challenging for further applications. In this study, we explored a novel method based on protein\u2013polyphenol interactions to reduce iron release. The interactions between the malt-derived PZ and FA were evaluated using muti-spectroscopy methods, and we found that one PZ molecule can bind with 22.11 \u00b1 2.13\nFoods 2023, 12, 234 10 of 12\nof FA with the binding constant at (4.99 \u00b1 2.13) \u00d7 105 M\u22121, while the tryptophan residues of PZ were made more hydrophilic without changing the secondary structure. FRET indicated that the binding distance between PZ and FA is 3.09 nm. In addition, MD analysis showed that FA could enter the internal hydrophobic pocket of PZ and form hydrogen bonds with Val-389 and Tyr-234. As expected, the iron release from DSF in beer showed a decrease of up to 40.5% in the presence of PZ. In FA solutions, the iron release was reduced by 86.20% when PZ:FA was 1:22 (molar ratio) compared with that without PZ addition. In conclusion, the inhibition of iron release from DSF is effective based on the PZ\u2013FA interaction, and it will provide a new approach for the prevention of iron release from ferritin in foodstuffs.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12020234/s1, Figure S1: The amino acids that contribute most to binding energy; Figure S2: The model of PZ\u2013FA complex after MD.
