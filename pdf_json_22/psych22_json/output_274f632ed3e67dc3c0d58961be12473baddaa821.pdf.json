Sousa*, J. Br\u00e1s, A. Costa, R. Vaz, J. Martins, D. Teixeira, A. Marques, J. Abreu, E. Almeida and N. Cunha\nCentro Hospitalar Tondela-Viseu, Departamento De Psiquiatria E Sa\u00fade Mental, Viseu, Portugal *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1348\nIntroduction: The COVID-19 pandemic represented a serious strain on the mental health resilience worldwide. Implementation\nof restrictive rules implied the disruption of social networks, eliciting emotional exhaustion and intense response to fear. This was amplified bymedia spread of panic and fake news, representing risk factors for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fear can be dangerous, especially accounting premorbid psychopathological vulnerability, such as pathological personality traits. Emotional dysregulation increases fear levels, mediated by the relationship between emotional dysregulation and lack of tolerance. Objectives: Clinical case presentation of patient who developed dissociative and behavioral symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Bibliographic research. Methods: Bibliographic research using Pubmed\u00ae. Clinical file consultation and patient interviews. Results:Heightened psychophysiological reactivity can result from the persistent fear experienced during a traumatic event and repeated memories related to it, leading to a sensitization of the response to fear.We present 57 year-old female patient, admitted to the COVID ward after trying to escape from home isolation due to positivity to COVID-19. In the hospital setting she developed dissociative symptoms, trying to escape from the ward and infect other people. Conclusions: Intense fear responses to COVID-19 are likely explained by poor emotion regulation capacities as well as dissociative mechanisms. Studies have shown that this pandemic was experienced as a real traumatic event and some studies have found that it may lead to the development of PTSD. Pathological personality is positively related to PTSD symptoms, attributable to higher levels of mood instability, cognitive/perceptual disorders, interpersonal dysfunctions and negative affection.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Objectives: Emphasize the importance of eliminating the diagnosis of covid 19 infection in a pandemic context face to first episode psychosis. Methods: Presentation of case report Results: A 29-year-old woman unemployed married with no personal medical history and with psychiatric family history. She wasn\u2019t exposed to subject with covid 19 in her family circle. She was admitted in psychiatric care for acute behavioural disorders during five days. On physical examination: shewas afebrile, eupneic and tachycardiac. Oxygen saturation was 96% and blood pressure was 100/50 mmHg. Specialized neurological examination was normal and cerebral CT scan was without abnormalities. At the psychiatric interview shewas extremely agitated. Shewas distressed her speech was incoherent. She had auditory and visual hallucinations\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1349 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nand a multi-thematic delirium. One day after her admission she died suddenly, the autopsy found positive RT PCR covid test and bilateral basal pneumonia. Conclusions: In individuals presenting with new-onset psychosis in areas endemic to COVID-19, consideration should be made for neuropsychiatric manifestations of Covid 19 from where the importance to push the explorations and to test the patients.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Henderson1, R. Gilmore2 and I. Bartolome1 1University of East Anglia, Norwich Medical School, Norwich, United Kingdom and 2University of East Anglia, Psychiatry, Norwich, United Kingdom *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1350\nIntroduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted medical students in many ways. They are not exempt from personal struggles caused by the health crisis, and many have faced similar challenges adapting to a new learning experience. The University of East Anglia (UEA) has initiatives in place to support medical students including the society Headucate UEA and the Wellbeing Champions scheme established by Norwich Medical School (NMS). Objectives: Headucate aims to improve mental wellbeing by educational online webinars and social events aimed at university students. NMS Wellbeing Champions offer support and signpost students to resources and the wider student support system at the UEA. Methods: Headucate was established in 2012 by NMS students that began running workshops at local secondary schools. Their work has expanded to include wellbeing workshops, social events for students and mental health first aid training, so members can provide peer support. Wellbeing Champions are medical student representatives responsible for completing mental health first aid training, communication between students and faculty, providing resources and signposting, creating mental health bulletin newsletters, and running socials exclusively for medical students. Results: 100% of Headucate workshop attendees who completed anonymous feedback agreed that they enjoyed it and that it was useful. No feedback has been collected regarding the success of the Wellbeing Champions. This should be carried out to assess and enhance the project further. Conclusions: More data is needed to establish the success of the initiatives at NMS and their impact on medical student\u2019s wellbeing.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Albert2 1Semmelweis University, Mental Health Sciences, Budapest, Hungary and 2Hungarian Academy of Sciences Centre of Excellence, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd Research Network, Institute Of Sociology, Centre For Social Sciences, Budapest, Hungary *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1351\nIntroduction: Covid-19-pandemic is likely to have a substantial and long-term effect on the mental health of the adult Hungarian population. Objectives: To investigate the self-reported change of loneliness, change in well-being, and change in the numbers of significant others due to Covid-19-pandemic. Methods: Computer-assisted web interviewing is being conducted. Survey design uses a multistaged sampling and iterative weighting algorithm, both based on the 2016 Hungarian micro census. The sample can be considered representative for age, gender, educational attainment, region, and size of the settlement. Continuous variables will be tested for normality of distribution using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk, and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests. To check the comparability of the two groups, the Mann\u2013Whitney U tests will be applied. The crosstabulation Pearson chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests will be performed to assess the association between categorical variables. Twosample Z-tests will be applied to evaluate the difference between the proportions of the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression models will be also applied to understand the association between the direction of change and sociodemographic variables. Results: The survey is currently being conducted; results shall be presented at the conference. Conclusions: The survey is currently being conducted; results and conclusions shall be presented at the conference.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Kilian\nUlm University, Department Of Psychiatry Ii, Guenzburg, Germany *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1352\nIntroduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the provision of mental health care. Particularly the limitations of faceto-face contacts and the access to treatment facilities can be expected to have significant negative effects on the practice of psychiatric treatment and outcomes. To date the extent and the severity of these effects in people with severe mental illnesses are rarely investigated in Germany. Objectives: We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and service use of people with severe mental illness in Germany.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1349 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
