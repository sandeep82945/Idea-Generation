Preferential access to scarce resources can bring competitive advantages and better performance to enterprises. However, the existing literature has a relatively single research path on the in\u0087uencing factors of enterprise resource access, which lacks su\u0088cient research from the perspective of multidimensional environment. In particular, as an important factor a\u008aecting enterprises\u2019 access to external resources, few studies have given empirical results on the impact of political factors such as government structure on enterprise resource access. \u00adrough the discussion of multidimensional environmental factors, this paper can provide theoretical reference for the reform of government institutions and the establishment of good political relations between enterprises and the government. Focusing on the multidimensional environment of government structure, political relations, and enterprise resource acquisition, this paper takes 129 enterprises in Central China as samples and uses the structural equation model to empirically verify the relationship between the formalization of government structure, liaison mechanism, decentralization, and enterprise resource acquisition, especially the easing e\u008aect of political relations. \u00ade results show that the formalization of government structure is promoting enterprises to obtain policy resources and \u0093nancial resources; the liaison mechanism helps enterprises to obtain \u0093nancial resources and market resources; decentralization has a signi\u0093cant positive impact on enterprises\u2019 access to policy resources and market resources; and political connection magni\u0093es the positive e\u008aect of government structure on enterprise resource acquisition, but there are di\u008aerences in di\u008aerent dimensions.",

Scholars mainly study the external resource acquisition of Chinese enterprises from two aspects: rst, the factors of the enterprise itself, such as\nthe internal resources of the enterprise and managers\u2019 relations and talents; second, the in uence of nonmarket environmental factors, such as collaborative innovation network and social capital, on key resources and information of enterprises. e government-enterprise network, political ties, and government policies a ect the enterprise\u2019s resource acquisition [2, 3]. Among them, scholars pay special attention to the political factors in the nonmarket environment. Almost every enterprise is in uenced by government\nHindawi Journal of Environmental and Public Health Volume 2022, Article ID 4471412, 10 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4471412\npolicy and regulation [4], ignoring the relationship with the government may have a negative effect on the competitive advantage of enterprises. Government networks and political connections are the relational assets of political factors, and enterprises can decide whether to construct the relational networks or take political actions to obtain the resources. However, the author found in the investigation that the government structure, which cannot be controlled by the enterprise, is also affecting the acquisition of enterprise resources. Studies have shown that government is not a single entity and that the relationships between government agencies affect their ability to provide benefits to business [5]. ,ese studies have improved our understanding of the effects of government structural factors on firm resource acquisition, but we still know little about what other structural factors affect firm resource acquisition and the magnitude of the effects.\n,e purpose of this paper is to break through the limitations of the research on the influence of political factors, focus on multidimensional environmental factors, regard the government structure as a variable, and use political connection factors to explore the relationship between it and government structure and enterprise resource acquisition. On the basis of literature analysis, interviews, and expert opinions, this paper puts forward three factors (formalization, liaison mechanism, and decentralization) of government structure influencing enterprise resources and uses the theory of political connection to deepen the understanding of the relationship between them. We tested our hypothesis through a questionnaire survey of 129 enterprises in central China, in order to fill in the gap in the research on the relationship between government structure and enterprise resources and to gain a deep understanding of the law of government structure change. It is also helpful for enterprises to understand the operating mode and characteristics of government structure and to take targeted strategies to establish political ties and access to resources.\n,e rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides theoretical motivations and research assumptions, followed by an overview of the research design, data collection, and data analysis and followed by a substantive interpretation of the data and discussion of the findings."

            "heading": "2. Theoretical Background",
            "text": "2.1. Dimensions of Government Structure. ,e early administrative theory pointed out that the formal organizational structure has the basic characteristics of hierarchy, specialization, and formalization [6], which is the basic starting point of the evolution of organizational theory. Organization hierarchization requires each individual to have a clear position in the pyramid-shaped relationship control structure, which is a kind of hierarchical structure based on authority difference and has the principle of unified command. Specialization involves how the various positions are organized into work units and departments and where jobs with the same attributes or relationships should be located within the same department [7]. A hierarchical and professional organization must meet some formal\nspecifications to ensure consistent results. In addition to the vertical control of the hierarchical and horizontal relationship to coordinate the functional departments, there exist the power differences caused by the rank and function within the organization.\nIn the study of organizational structure effectiveness, more scholars choose to use case study and questionnaire survey methods. Among them, there are 12 dimensions of organizational structure discussed by the scale method, such as formalization, specialization, standardization, personnel ratio, decentralization, complexity, authorization, and vertical range, which can be summarized and merged into four measurement dimensions, such as complexity, formalization, decentralization, and liaison mechanism [8\u201311].\nSince the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, the Chinese government has carried out eight organizational reforms, mainly to solve the problems of overstaffed institutions, numerous departments, overlapping responsibilities, and unclear functions. ,e Chinese government improves government performance by streamlining institutions and personnel, transforming government functions, and rationalizing departmental responsibilities. At present, China\u2019s government level is generally a five-level system of the central, provincial, municipal, county, and township levels, but in fact, the government level has the characteristics of the same level of heterogeneity, the combination of virtual reality, the coexistence of rank, and dislocation. ,e Chinese government has formally completed the institutional reform of merger and reorganization, but has not made any real changes in terms of structural adjustment and decentralization.\n,is paper selects and adjusts the measurement dimensions through the content of previous interviews and puts forward three dimensions of enterprise resource acquisition, which are formalization, liaison mechanism, and decentralization, by means of organizational structure theory research, combined with the reality of the Chinese government, and on the basis of listening to experts\u2019 opinions. What needs to be explained here is that we define the government structure as the local governments at the municipal (district) and county levels below the provincial level because the government agencies in this area havemore contacts with enterprises in urban economic management so that certain dimensions can be verified.\n2.2. Enterprise Resources. ,is paper studies the impact of government structure on resource acquisition, so we use the results of corporate political behavior to determine the types of corporate resources. Generally speaking, the results of corporate political behavior are divided into three categories: policy performance, financial performance, and market performance [12]. Accordingly, we define the types of enterprise resources in this paper as: policy resources, financial resources, and market resources. Among them, policy resources are government subsidies, tax exemptions, bailouts or support [13\u201315], lower administrative and regulatory barriers [16], and changes in public policy to help firms maintain their competitive advantage [17]. Financial\nresources refer to the availability or low cost of long-term debt financing [18\u201320]. Market resources refer to the resources obtained by an enterprise that have an impact on market competition, business promotion, and sales. Examples include greater pricing power [16], participation in international competition and trade expansion [21], and income from obtaining business licenses or government contracts [17].\n2.3. Political Connection. Because governments control critical information and resources, it is difficult for companies to gain a sustainable competitive advantage if they do not pay attention to the political process and dynamics in the operating environment and adopt political strategies. ,erefore, the act of political linkage is crucial for companies to gain access to key resources and facilitate economic exchanges [22]. ,e idea of a positive relationship between political connection and firm performance has been demonstrated [12, 17], which provides firms with various forms of institutional support and valuable resources and information. In the study of the relationship between government structure and enterprise resource acquisition, this paper takes political relations as moderating variables and analyzes the relationship between variables."

            "heading": "3. Research Assumptions",
            "text": "3.1. Formalization. Formalization refers to the degree of formalization in the organizational structure, including clear working procedures and instructions, various rules and regulations, working rules, guidelines. ,e degree of formalization is usually measured by the degree to which regulations are written and the way by which quality and performance are monitored. ,erefore, the clearer the workflow of government agencies and the higher the degree of specialization of staff, the higher the efficiency of government work. For example, many enterprises pay special attention to the government\u2019s discount loan policy because the interest is very low and there is no repayment pressure, which is very suitable for the business turnover of enterprises. However, the discount loan policy has many conditions and restrictions. If the relevant government departments do not give a detailed explanation of the latest policy, it will increase the various costs for enterprises to apply for discount loans. Similarly, in the process of applying for discount loans, the simplification of government procedures and the degree of specialization of staff will directly or indirectly affect the probability of successful application. At the same time, formalization can effectively reduce the impact of individual differences on the organization. A high degree of formalization means that individuals in an organization have low autonomy in the content and means of work. On the contrary, it means that individuals have greater authority in handling organizational affairs. For example, when an enterprise applies for government project funding, if the government agencies carry out procedures such as document release, selection, and publicity according to uniform requirements and standards, then the enterprise\ndoes not need to contact the person in charge of the agency deliberately, and the absence of such informal contact does not hinder the enterprise from applying for the project. Based on the above discussion, the following assumptions are put forward:\nH1: the formalization of government structure has a positive influence on promoting the acquisition of enterprise policy resources H2: the formalization of government structure has a positive influence on promoting the acquisition of financial resources of enterprises H3: the formalization of government structure has a positive influence on promoting enterprises\u2019 access to market resources\n3.2. Liaison Mechanism. ,e liaison mechanism mainly refers to the communication and liaison mechanism among the various departments in the organization. As a result of the horizontal division of labour brought about by specialization, different functional units have been created within the organization that are independent of each other, and the organizational structure needs to coordinate these different functional units so that they are less conflict-ridden and interdependent. ,e degree of interdependence among the various branches of government may be determined by their degree of differentiation. Some scholars have suggested that the government governance model is between the administrative and the market boundary. ,e department presents the different system logic and the behavior result: first is to administer according to institutionalized procedures, which is based on the administrative mechanism of bureaucracy; second is to administer in a market-based manner, which is themanagementmechanism extended by breaking the fetters of bureaucracy. ,e departmental mechanism of bureaucratic logic is considered to be traditional and procedural, and departments act in accordance with procedures and responsibilities.,e latter kind of managementmechanism is unconventional and flexible, and departments have similar functions and communicate closely with enterprises under this kind of market logic. Two different departmental operating mechanisms bring different values, rules, and institutional arrangements, which increase the difficulty of coordination. For example, if a business wants to promote a new business related to local economic planning through the government, the government department in charge of the business tends to support the business, while the department with approval authority has bureaucratic logic due to functional differences. Applications for this business may be rejected by examination and approval department, if the necessary liaison mechanisms between departments are not in place. Similarly, in the process of government discount or interest-free loans, the provision of materials, interpretation of policies, and specific handling involve different levels and different machines. If the standards are not uniform and there are barriers to communication, the cost of business handling will increase. Based on the above discussion, the following assumptions are put forward:\nH4: the liaison mechanism of government structure has a positive influence on promoting the acquisition of enterprise policy resources H5: the liaison mechanism of government structure has a positive influence on promoting the acquisition of enterprise financial resources H6: the liaison mechanism of government structure plays a positive influence on promoting enterprises\u2019 access to market resources\n3.3. Decentralization. Generally speaking, the control system at the organizational level can ensure the rapid execution of orders from top to bottom. However, in the complex and diverse unitary centralized system, it is a big problem in the practice of state governance to deal with the contradiction between it and effective governance. Decentralization mechanism is an important way proposed by scholars to alleviate the contradiction between the centralized system and effective governance [23]. Since the reform and opening up, the central government has delegated greater power to provincial governments, and the financial relationship between them has been straightened out. With the implementation of decentralization, decentralization among local governments is increasing. However, among provincial, municipal, county, and township governments, financial power is excessively concentrated upward and administrative power is excessively concentrated downward, which hinders the improvement of local government governance performance. In addition to the vertical government hierarchy, the horizontal departmental setup within the government also involves the issue of decentralization. ,e degree of power concentration and distribution affects the effectiveness of organizational control. When the power of an organization or department is highly concentrated, decisions are made by senior managers, and it is difficult for managers to make accurate decisions due to the limited amount of information. If the power of organizations or departments is decentralized, more grass-roots organizations or people can participate in the decision-making process, which can help reduce the uncertainty of information and make more satisfactory decisions [24]. For example, when several enterprises compete for funds for a government project, the grass-roots government departments or staff often have various business contacts with the enterprise, so they will better understand the real conditions of the enterprise. ,erefore, increasing the decision-making power of the grass-roots government departments or staff, such as preliminary review, may reduce the probability of improper allocation of project resources, not only maintaining the reputation of the government departments but also saving the time cost of the enterprise. In addition, enterprises often have some practical difficulties that need to be solved urgently, such as slow-moving products and brain drain, but these difficulties are not within the scope of the work responsibilities of the middle- and high-level government agencies, and the grassroots government organizations or grass-roots staff lack the actual power to solve problems. Once the grass-roots\ngovernment is given more powers, the efficiency of enterprises\u2019 access to resources may be greatly improved. Based on the above discussion, the following assumptions are put forward:\nH7: the decentralization of government agencies has a positive influence on promoting the acquisition of enterprise policy resources. H8: the decentralization of government agencies has a positive influence on promoting the acquisition of financial resources of enterprises. H9: the decentralization of government agencies plays a positive influence on promoting enterprises\u2019 access to market resources.\n3.4. Moderating Role of Political Connection. ,e relationship system formed by groups or individuals is included in the norms, levels, departments, coordination, power, and other elements of government organizational structure. Enterprise\u2019s political connection is one of the important components, which mainly refers to the establishment of good contacts and relationships between enterprises and the government so that enterprises can be protected by the government and reduce the uncertainty in their operations [25, 26]. Specifically, high-level political ties enable enterprises to avoid the predatory behavior of government grassroots personnel and improve their relative bargaining power when dealing with government officials [27]. If the liaison mechanism between government departments is not smooth, enterprises can offset this negative impact by directly or indirectly establishing contact with government agencies that have control over government departments [28]. For example, when an enterprise applies for a certain qualification standard certification, the grass-roots personnel of the government refuses the application of the enterprise on the ground that there is no relevant certification standard in the region. If the enterprise has a familiar high-level political relationship, it can avoid grass-roots personnel and communicate directly with high-level officials. May be, it can be solved by learning from the certification standards of other regions and adopting the filing system. Even if the business is finally handled by the grassroots personnel, with the contact of senior officials, the enterprise will increase the probability of successfully handling the business. However, some studies have also shown that the value created by political connections may be weakened by the checks and balances between government departments [5], or political capital may become a negative lift after a sudden change in political structure [29]. Based on the above discussion, the following assumptions are put forward:\nH10: political connection has a positive moderating effect between government structure and enterprise policy resources and market resources. ,ere is a moderating effect between government structure and enterprise financial resources, but there are differences between different dimensions of government structure."

            "text": "How does the government structure a ect the acquisition of enterprise resources? rough the analysis of 307 observations of 129 enterprises in central China, this paper nds that the formalized structure has a signi cant positive impact on the acquisition of enterprise policy resources, the liaison mechanism has a signi cant positive impact on the acquisition of enterprise nancial resources, and the decentralization of power has a signi cant positive impact on the acquisition of enterprise policy resources and market resources. e formalized structure has a weak signi cant positive impact on the acquisition of nancial resources, and the liaison mechanism has a weak signi cant positive impact on the acquisition of market resources. At the same time, political connection can amplify the positive e ects of the three structural elements on enterprise resource acquisition, and even for variables that had no connection, such as formalization structure and enterprise market resources, decentralization, and enterprise nancial resources, political\nconnection has played a significant positive role in regulating.\n,e core contribution of this paper is reflected in three aspects. Firstly, this paper provides a new idea for the study of multidimensional political factors affecting enterprise resource acquisition. ,e existing literature fails to consider the influence of government structure on enterprise resource acquisition and ignores the uncontrollable factors in enterprise resource acquisition. At the same time, due to the abstraction and complexity of the concept of organizational structure itself, academic circles rarely use quantitative methods to study organizational structure. Based on the three elements of government structure, such as formalization, liaison mechanism, and decentralization, this paper empirically analyzes their relationship with the political resources of enterprises and their influence degree.\nSecondly, the paper points out the influence of the correct operation mode of government structure on enterprise development. When the government structure runs in a reasonable and efficient way, that is, its dimensions such as formalization, liaison mechanism, and decentralization are in a good state, both enterprises and the government benefit. For example, when a government agency conducts public service bidding, the formalization process brings reasonable and fair enterprise competition, and the government can complete the project construction at the lowest cost. Also, enterprises can put more resources into the improvement of market capacity and achieve long-term development.\nFinally, the article provides a way to solve the structural obstacles of government institutions. During the period of China\u2019s transition, weak administrative institutions have created some structural obstacles. For example, the irregularities of government behavior still exist. ,e checks and balances between government departments weaken their ability to provide resources for enterprises; Slow public sector systemmay lead to the delay of approval.When power is highly concentrated, enterprises may be exploited from the grass-roots level and so on. ,erefore, this kind of environment makes it necessary for enterprises to establish appropriate political ties. ,rough the political connection of enterprises, the uncertainty caused by structural obstacles can be reduced, and opportunities for obtaining resources can be created. However, enterprises cannot rely too much on the political ties established with the government in terms of resource acquisition. Excessive political ties will lead to increased operating costs and bribery and corruption, or inappropriate political connection leads to excessive power of enterprises, such as excessive use of public resources to enhance competitive advantage and excessive discretion of enterprise executives.\n,e findings of this paper have important management implications for the reform of government structure and how to build the relationship between enterprises and the government. First of all, the government structure needs to continue to deepen the reform in the following three aspects: (1) scientific, procedural, and transparent government normative acts based on legal basis. (2) Cooperation and linkage between government departments. (3)\nDecentralization based on unified leadership. Secondly, in order to prevent the negative impact of government structural obstacles on enterprise resource acquisition, enterprises must have certain political ability, that is, regardless of the state of government structure; enterprises can identify different types of political problems and take different actions. ,ere are two main ways to develop and cultivate the political ability of enterprises. (1) Previous experience: enterprises can learn to make better use of political strategies by summing up their experiences in dealing with government agencies [31]. (2) Market ability: on the basis of market ability, enterprises develop directly related political ability, which can reduce the cost of political contact. Of course, under the environment of perfect government structure elements, the market ability of enterprises can replace the function of their political ability, so as to realize the acquisition of enterprise resources.\nDue to the limitation of conditions, there are still some research limitations in this paper, which need further research in the future. (1) ,e area where the sample is located can be further expanded. In the future, small- and mediumsized enterprises and government agencies in the east and south can be included in the research scope, and a more meaningful conclusion may be obtained by comparative analysis with the situation in the central and western regions. (2) Combining the case analysis with the questionnaire survey can not only ensure the universality of the conclusion but also help to create a new theory, which is more effective.\nData Availability\nAll data used to support the findings of the study are included within this article.\nConflicts of Interest\n,e authors declare no conflicts of interest."
