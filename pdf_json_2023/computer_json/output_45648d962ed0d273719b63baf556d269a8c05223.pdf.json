    "abstractText": "Online education has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in the field of engineering. However, one of the challenges of online engineering education is providing students with hands-on laboratory experiences that require being at an on-campus laboratory. Virtual laboratory technical solutions have been developed during the last decade to allow learners to simulate engineering systems online or to connect to predesigned systems modules within physical laboratories. However, these predesigned solutions need to be acquired as software and hardware components which would require a certain budget and a training time before they can be used. In addition, these solutions do not concentrate on the construction portion of the systems under experimentation, but rather on testing the predesigned module using a virtual application that connects to it. In this paper we have developed a solution that would enable online learners to build virtual systems step by step at their ends and connect them to real time on-campus labs to perform remote experimentation. We have designed and developed a prototype for a simple, easy to learn and use virtual laboratory model for logic gates systems.. We have used a combination of technologies such as Virtual Networking Computing (VNC) technology, Video Conferencing (VC) technology, and Object-Oriented programming (OOP). Our solution was practically proven using Python programming running on a raspberry PI system to construct sample examples virtual logic gates applications. This allows online students to concentrate on constructing, step by step, logic gates systems virtually, and to control actual physical logic gates systems within an on-campus lab with the help of a webcam. Our solution was tested by group of learners and was proved to be a costeffective alternative to traditional laboratory experiences, as our virtual laboratory can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need for additional expensive equipment and laboratory space.

INTRODUCTION\nI.I EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING Experiential Learning is a powerful approach to learning, development, and change. The theory was proposed by psychologist David Kolb who was influenced by the work of other theorists including John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, and Jean Piaget. It emphasizes the importance of experience and its role in the learning process [1, 2]. The Institute for Experiential Learning describes it as a proactive approach to career readiness that develops students\u2019 professionalism and core competencies they will need, in addition to the theoretical knowledge they gain in their degree program. Universities such as UGA College of Engineering and Northeastern University Graduate School of Engineering have implemented experiential learning programs to give\nstudents first-hand opportunities to connect academic foundations to the world beyond the classroom [3]. Experiential Learning has an array of benefits that can contribute to education. Some of these benefits include:\nA better grasp of concepts: Through experiential learning, an opportunity is provided to apply ideas and data in a real-world setting where the learner will have an active role [4]. Creative opportunities: Learning by experience is one of the best ways to learn creative problem-solving [5]. Opportunities to reflect: Learners can reflect on their actions and how the outcome might vary from other peers [2, 4]. A Real-world relevance: Students may tune out lectures if they think the material doesn\u2019t pertain to the real world. Experiential learning takes data and concepts\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

These environments provide students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Virtual learning can take place either in a self-paced (asynchronous) environment or in a real-time (synchronous) environment. The use of technologies such as Virtual Networking Computing (VNC) and Video Conferencing (VC) allows for real-time interaction and collaboration between students and instructors. Online learning can also help students to practice their IT skills, which are increasingly important in today\u2019s digital world. Additionally, online learning can improve students\u2019 attention and engagement using interactive educational games. According to [6], cognitive, social, and teaching presence were significant factors in learners obtaining high-level outcomes using OLEs. The study also showed higher student post-test success based on the noted factors. Additional study further noted the importance of online learners being just as valued as face-to-face learners from a communications frequency perspective. Instructor responsiveness is also a key factor in success [7]. Learner content interaction (LCI) and Learner instructor interaction (LII) were also identified as primary factors by [8]. In recent years, OLEs have also shown to be effective in teaching\nstudents programming. Roshni & Choon observed that interaction through peer reviews in an online programming environment is beneficial to student learning. Students are better prepared for learning and applying programming in learning and in their career field [9]. However, there are also challenges associated with online learning, such as the need for reliable technology and family support.\nSpecifically, online engineering programs can be challenging for students, particularly those with math and science difficulties. These programs traditionally include rigorous study requirements and are content-centered, hands-on, and design-oriented [10]. The greatest challenges usually come in the early years of the program. Some of the most common challenges undergraduate students face during online classes include technical issues, distractions, and time management, staying motivated, understanding course expectations, lack of in-person interaction, and adapting to unfamiliar technology [11]. Technical issues can arise when learners in various locations use devices with different operating systems or when there is limited internet access or bandwidth. Distractions and time management can be a challenge when students are learning from home and have to balance their studies with other responsibilities. Staying motivated can be difficult when students feel isolated and de-motivated due to the lack of inperson interaction. Understanding course expectations can be\nchallenging when students have to rely solely on online communication with their instructors. Adapting to unfamiliar technology can also be a challenge for students who are not used to using online learning platforms [12].\nI.III RELATED WORK\nThe rapid developments in communications technologies during the past two decades allowed the development of virtual laboratory technical solutions that include engineering systems online simulations, or remote access to predesigned systems modules within physical laboratories.\nOne such technology is Virtual Network Computing (VNC) which is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol to remotely control another computer [13]. It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates over a network. VNC is platform-independent and supports all modern operating systems. It is commonly used for remote technical support and accessing files on one\u2019s work-computer from one\u2019s home computer, or vice versa [14]. VNC was originally developed as an open-source research project and many modern derivatives are open source under the GNU General Public License. Virtual networking shifts networking activities to software and enables communication between multiple computers, virtual machines (VMs), virtual servers, or other devices across different office and data center locations [15]. A software application, called a virtual switch\nor vSwitch, controls and directs communication between the existing physical network and virtual parts of the network.\nAn example system that can be utilized for online learning for engineering students would be the Raspberry PI, where it can be used to enhance students learning as they can improve students\u2019 understanding of learning materials through putting learnt concepts into practice [16]. Various Raspberry PI kits are available for learners at reasonable prices [17-18]. A pulse view project was developed in [19] to display pulses/signals on a device with the help of a raspberry PI system. A beginner robot project was implemented in [20]. An oscilloscope system using raspberry PI was developed in [21].\nVarious projects utilizing these technologies or/and additional software platforms such as LABVIEW were used to develop solutions for online remote labs. A solution was described in [22] for an online platform that can be used by leaners for collaboration. A remote network laboratory that allows remote access to real devices was discussed in [23]. In [24] a solution is proposed that involves developing lab client functionality for an available application which can results in an improved latency. A remote laboratory to provide a safe way to deal with hazardous substance in industry was described in [25]. A work that involves comparing physical and remote laboratory platforms is\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

An integration project for creating a network of remote experiment labs in engineering fields is described in [27]. A study in [28] concentrated on identify how a remote lab assignment based on active learning pedagogy in higher engineering education supports student engagement. Another study in [29] describes remote laboratories in general and shows an example of how remote laboratories can be utilized as an integral part of engineering education. An FPGA Case Study used in Remote Laboratory for online engineering education is presented in [30]. A project for virtual labs and remote labs is reported in [31], and shows an example of how remote laboratories can be utilized as an integral part of engineering education. In [32] virtual reality was examined for an existing engineering education remote lab. An open-source remote laboratory for practical learning that uses supervisory control and a data acquisition platform programmed with Python was reported in [33]. The work presented in [34] is related to a web-based system aimed at teaching logic design concepts and practices for computer science and engineering students implemented using LabVIEW. This work uses a hardware system called ELVIS as well. In addition, the paper includes several simulations for logic systems. In [35] a cloud-Based remote laboratory for electronic engineering experiments is discussed, and in [36] the VISIR circuits module of remote laboratory platform Labsland was used, together with the video conferencing platform Zoom, to simulate a real electrical circuits lab environment. This research studied the students\u2019 perception and academic performance in the online lab settings in comparison with previous physical labs. This study showed that while learners can work on the labs at a personal pace in an own remote environment, the software used has a high learning curve could be more user-friendly.\nOur paper is distinguished from the previous research by the fact that it concentrates on teaching the learner a step-by-step approach how to construct a real system, using real images, that is to be experimented. The images are selected and moved by learners to construct a full functioning system which would then be enabled to communicate with the real physical design in an on-campus laboratory. Our proposed remote lab method is simple with very low learning curve, and has low cost compared to other available systems.\nOur paper is organized as follows: Section II deals with problem hypothesis and research question. Section III concentrates on our research method and design. In Section IV we provide design results, and finally Section V is the conclusion."

            "text": "In this project we investigate the possibility of creating a generalized virtual laboratory model that can be used in online engineering courses to provide real time experiences to online engineering students. The model uses a simple methodology of learning which concentrates on constructing the system under experimentation virtually and verifying that the construction is done properly. The constructed system is then capable of communicating with a real system in an on-campus\nlab. The learner will be able to control the real system remotely through a virtual software application.\nOur proposed simple learning methodology consists of experiment components that are listed for the online learner, instructions that are shown to provide step by step information about conducting the online experiment, and the experiment space where the listed components would be moved to during the construction of the system under experimentation.\nTo implement our suggested simple learning methodology, we propose a generalized virtual laboratory model that consists of virtual lab components that are provided within a virtual software application. The virtual software is run over a specialized microprocessor/controller system. The controller system can be accessed and controlled via a VNC system from any desktop, laptop, or smart phone system. Any system running VNC can communicate with other learners using a VC tool. A remote learner would be able to access their VC application and request control of the virtual lab. A permission can be given by the administrator at the lab or automatically as specified by the administrator of the system running the VNC application.\nThe generalized model interacts with the actual lab system on ground. Once an online learner completes a required lab construction virtually, the model sends an activation signal to\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The online student would be then able to apply input to the actual on ground system and monitor the real time results through a proper technology. Figure 1 shows a diagram that illustrates the components of the generalized model of the virtual laboratory system.\nTo prove the concept of our generalized model utilizing our proposed simple method of learning, we have selected a lab of logic gates design. We used a Raspberry PI kit system as our specialized microprocessor/controller system. This goal was achieved through designing two virtual labs. One lab is for the construction of an AND logic gate and the other one is for the construction of an OR logic gate. The physical component of this project was realized through an actual implemented logic design for an AND gate and an OR gate within a lab that are activated by the virtual components of the design. Our VC technology consisted of a live web camera which is connected to the Raspberry PI system kit and is used to transfer the video of the physical logic design and deliver to an online web browser where it can be accessed and monitored.\nA windows-based system is used to run a VNC client (VNCviewer) to connect to the Raspberry PI system which has an installed VNC server. The Raspberry PI is interfaced to design boards that have the physical AND, and OR logic gate systems, and to a web camera capturing the live video of the logic gates. A web browser is run on the windows-based system to display the live real time video being transferred\nfrom the lab camera. Zoom is also run to share the system with any learner who receives the Zoom link. The learner can be given control through the Zoom application to be able to\ncontrol/ implement the needed logic gate design lab experiments remotely. Figure 2 shows the proposed design of the remote lab system.\nThe learner can access the virtual laboratory through a remote device with a VC application such as Zoom. The learner then would be constructing virtually and remotely the AND, and OR gates circuits by dragging components and placing them in their proper locations within the logic circuit design for each logic gate. When completed, the learner would be allowed to operate the corresponding circuits in real time while following the results of the operations through the video transferred by the lab webcam."

Figure 3 shows the virtual design components for an AND, and an OR logic gate systems respectively. Those components are clickable and can be dragged by a mouse. Once learners access the virtual lab, they will be able to start the Python files for the AND, and OR logic gate systems. The student would then follow the displayed instructions in each system to correctly construct the required logic circuit.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

A learner would be selecting virtual components and placing them in their proper locations in the logic design circuit. The software would be checking continuously the status of the logic circuit construction. When completed and tested by the learner, the system would send an activation signal to the corresponding physical logic gate system allowing it to be operated remotely. Inputs A and B are then enabled to be passed from the Raspberry PI to each logic gate with a \u201cready\u201d status.\nThe interfacing circuit is responsible for powering the AND, and the OR gates when the learner successfully connects the\ncircuit virtually using the virtual application of the design. It is also responsible for passing the inputs A and B from the raspberry PI to the logic gates. Not gates are used as buffers to bring up the powering voltage to 5V. They are also used to control Tristate switches to pass the input signals to the proper gates when any enable signal to power a logic gate is generated by the Raspberry PI. Figure 4 shows the interfacing circuit between the Raspberry PI kit system and the Logic Gates.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

For example, if the AND gate code changes the A and B input to a certain binary combination, then the code controlling the OR gate should detect that and update its inputs to be consistent with the AND gate inputs. This is achieved by monitoring the levels of input A and B by the Raspberry PI and detecting any changes and making sure that the inputs of the logic gate with the noninitiating code for that change are updated as well."

The codes were run on a Raspberry PI kit system that is connected to a physical design of an AND, and an OR gate systems. A webcam was placed above the physical design to transmit real time video of the logic gates circuits. VNC Server was installed on the Raspberry PI, and VNCviewer was installed on a windows-based system. The Raspberry PI system was accessed successfully from the windows-based system to run the two logic gate codes.\nZoom was also used to invite remote learners to participate in the learning experiment. A Zoom link was sent to 15 learners for the purpose of testing and operating the innovative design. The learners started Zoom successfully, each at a different time slot, and were able to request remote control of the host application (VNCviewer running on the windows-based system). The host was able to successfully grant permission to the learners. The learners then followed the step-by-step instructions provided by the virtual software to construct the logic gates remotely. The instructions were as follows:\n Click on input A image to select\n Click on PIN 1 image to add input A\n Click on input B image to select\n Click on PIN 2 image to add input B\n Click on LED A image to select\n Click on PIN 1 image to add LED A\n Click on LED B image to select\n Click on PIN 2 image to add LED B\n Click on LED OUT image to select\n Click on PIN 3 image to add LED OUT\n Click on Test button\nOnce the learner finished these steps then the status \u201cReady\u201d was displayed indicating that circuit is ready to be operated. The logic symbol of each logic gate was then visible, as shown in Figure 5, through the virtual design software. The learner was able to apply various patterns of binary inputs to the virtual logic gates symbols. Light emitting diodes (LEDs)\nin the on-campus lab were monitored by the learner (as shown in Figure 6. The image is captured by a webcam connected to the Raspberry PI and is transferred through the network to the device hosting the VNCviewer and the Zoom applications) and were compared to the status of the virtual LEDS within the virtual application. The virtual LEDs within the virtual software application operated in consistency with the physical LEDs in the lab proving the correct operation of the logic gates.\nThe integrated circuit used for the AND gate had the PIN numbers displayed by the virtual application. The PIN numbers for the OR gate were removed to stimulate learners to memorize where they are located. After each learner finished the experimentation, a 5-question survey was provided to give feedback about their experiences. The surveys were collected and analyzed anonymously.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

With respect to the easiness of constructing the gates, about 86% of the learners were very satisfied, while about 14% had fair experience. When it comes to the time needed to construct the logic gates, 100% of the learners indicated that they were very satisfied.

Learners indicated that they were satisfied with the time needed to learn how to do the lab as about 87% indicated they were very satisfied, while 13% indicated they were satisfied. Figure 7 shows the results of the survey.\nResults, in general, indicate that most of the learners had a satisfactory experience with the lab. On average it took a learner about 15 minutes to learn about how to use the lab and to construct the logic gates and operate them. This proves the low learning curve for our proposed learning methodology.\nSome feedback notes were given that can explain the selection of \u201cfair\u201d by some learners, such as it would be easier to show PIN numbers for the OR gate integrated circuit as they were shown for the AND gate.
