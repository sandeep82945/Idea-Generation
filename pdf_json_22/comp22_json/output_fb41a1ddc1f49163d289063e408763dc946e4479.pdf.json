    "abstractText": "Rac Family Small GTPase 3 (Rac3) is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins which play critical roles in the occurrence, progression, and metastasis of various tumors. Nevertheless, previous studies have focused on a single type of human cancer, so that the roles of Rac3 in different cancer types have not been sufficiently clarified. With the progress of biological detection and bioinformatics technology, the emerging cancer genomics databases make it possible to perform a pancancer analysis. Therefore, for the first time, we performed multiple omics analysis to investigate the roles of Rac3 in differential expression, survival prognosis, mutative status, DNA methylation, functions, immune infiltration, and immunotherapy across 33 human cancer types. We found that Rac3 expression was abnormal in 17 cancer types and significantly different in both molecular and immune subtypes of 10 cancers (p<0.05). These Rac3 expression dysregulations in cancer tissues significantly affected their corresponding survival prognosis. Our results also indicated that genetic alterations of Rac3 occurred in 27 cancer types and were significantly associated with prognosis. Moreover, methylation of Rac3 was associated with dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes and affected the prognosis of the brain, melanoma, and breast tumors, and Rac3 Copy Number Alterations (CNA) might affect the infiltration levels of different immune cells in nine cancers. Rac3 and Rac3-related genes were enriched in the axon guidance, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and neurotrophin signaling pathway, and involved the regulation of cellular localization and actin cytoskeleton organization, and small GTPase mediated signal transduction. Then, we further explored the correlations between Rac3 expression and 25 immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts across 33 human cancers. Furthermore, we found that Rac3 achieved higher predictive power (AUC>0.5) than three standardized biomarkers of tumor immune responses and was associated with cytotoxic T-cell levels (CTLs) and the risk of immunotherapeutic responses in three cancer types. Collectively, our study contributes to a comprehensive and integrative understanding of the oncogenic roles of Rac3 across human cancers and offers a new clue for treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION An estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths will occur in 2020 from the Global Cancer Statistics 2020, resulting in cancer being the primary cause of death in the world [1]. Although diagnosis and treatment technology has been continuously developed, cancer is still a major health problem leading to the high cancer burden in China [2], [3]. Therefore, it is crucial and meaningful to identify novel cancer-related genes and investigate their potential molecular mechanisms from the pan-cancer perspective. Meanwhile, with the emerging\ncancer genomics databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we could perform pan-cancer analysis of cancer-related genes [4]-[6].\nRac3 protein, located at chr17:82,031,678-82,034,204 (GRCh38/hg38), is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins involving in the occurrence, progression, and metastasis of various human tumors [7]-[9]. Recent studies revealed that Rac3 was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues and could promote bladder cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Donnelly et al. found that Rac3 could control the balance of proteolytic and adhesive activity to affect the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer [12]. FBXL19 inhibited rac3 to mediate the E-cadherin expression of esophageal cancer cells [13]. Rac3 regulated the invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cells and might serve as a potential therapeutic target [14]. Nevertheless, these studies were limited to a single type of human cancer. To our knowledge, there is still no existing research to explore the potential role of Rac3 from a pancancer perspective [15]. However, pan-cancer analysis can provide a novel insight into biomarkers, targeted therapy, and the underlying molecular mechanisms of different human cancers based on the cancer genomics databases [16]-[18]. With the progress of biological detection and bioinformatics technology, more and more cancer databases can be easily obtained, making it possible to perform a pan-cancer analysis of Rac3 in different cancer types.\nIn this study, for the first time, we integrated various multi-omics databases to perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis of Rac3 across human cancers. Our study revealed the oncogenic roles of Rac3 in multiple human cancers, and Rac3 could serve as biomarkers for cancer detection, cancer immune therapy, and prognosis. II. MATERIALS AND METHODS As shown in Fig. 1, we first investigated the mRNA and protein expression levels of Rac3 in cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Then, we analyzed the correlation between Rac3 expression and immune and molecular subtypes, survival prognosis, mutative status, DNA methylation, and immune infiltrating. Finally, we explored\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

IMMUNE INFILTRATION ANALYSIS We used the 'Immune' part of GSCA to investigate the correlation between infiltration levels of different immune cells and Rac3 GSVA scores across TCGA cancers. The 'Mutation' module of TIMER 2.017 was used to analyze and visualize the correlation between Rac3 expression and infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts [34]. Furthermore, TISIDB was used to explore the correlation of Rac3 expression with immunomodulators and chemokines (or receptors). I. IMMUNOTHERAPY ANALYSIS To analyze the effect of Rac3 on therapeutic responses, the 'Biomarker Evaluation' module of TIDE was used to compare the Rac3 predictive power in therapeutic response outcomes with several standardized biomarkers of tumor immune responses. We used TISIDB to evaluate differences of Rac3 between responders and non-responders to Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB). In addition, the 'Query Gene' module of TIDE was utilized to assess the correlation between Rac3 expression with cytotoxic T-cell levels and survival prognosis of immunotherapeutic responses. 15 http://www. pantherdb.org/, accessed on 10 May 2022 16 http://metascape.org/, accessed on 10 May 2022 17 http://timer.cistrome.org/, accessed on 10 May 2022\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In contrast, the protein expression of Rac3 was obviously different. For instance, although the Rac3 mRNA level of endocrine tissues was the third-highest, the Rac3 protein was not expressed. Except for the eye, connective and soft tissues, pancreas, and endocrine tissues, the Rac3 protein was expressed in all human tissues and organs and consistent with the mRNA expression. We further used the GTEx and FANTOM5 datasets to verify the above conclusions. As shown in Fig. 2 (B), the top tissues of Rac3 mRNA level were the testis, pituitary gland, liver, salivary gland, and breast. Moreover, the mRNA levels of Rac3 were primarily expressed in the cerebral cortex, testis, cerebellum, pons, and breast (Fig. 2 (C)). The protein dataset verified that the Rac3 protein was highly expressed in most normal tissues, except for the eye, connective and soft tissues, pancreas, and endocrine tissues (Fig. 2 (D)). From the RNA single-cell-type specificity perspective, Rac3 was highly expressed in glandular epithelial cells, specialized epithelial cells, germ cells, blood and immune cells, and trophoblast cells, especially in extravillous trophoblasts, spermatogonia, breast myoepithelial cells (Fig. 2 (E)).\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

High expression levels of Rac3 indicated a poor prognosis of OS in ACC (P=0.0021), BLCA (P=0.0026), KIRC (P=7.7e-05), MESO (P=0.00093), SARC (P=0.0072),\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "Increasing research has reported that the occurrence and development of human cancers might be correlated with genetic alterations [35]-[37]. Thus, we firstly explored the mutative status of Rac3 in different cancers by cBioPortal and COSMIC. The results showed that UCS had the highest alteration frequency of Rac3 (>5%), followed by LIHC, MESO, ACC, and BRCA, and the 'Amplification' type was the primary type of Rac3 alterations (mutation, structural variant, amplification, deep deletion, and multiple alterations) across different TCGA cancers (Fig. 6 (A)). We found that A95V, D65N, P34L/T, and P185L, which were 'missense' types, were the most frequent mutation sites in pan-cancers (Fig. 6 (D)). 31 mutations (including 27 missense) were detected and their corresponding 3D structures were shown in Fig. 6 (E). The COSMIC database found that missense substitutions occurred in 48.62% of 109 Rac3 mutation samples (Fig. 6 (B)), which further confirmed our above conclusions. And the substitution mutations mainly occurred in C>T (39.73%) and G>A (24.66%) (Fig. 6 (C)). To investigate the relationships between alterations of Rac3 and the survival prognosis of various human cancers, we used cBioPortal to find that Rac3-altered patients indicated a statistically poor prognosis in PFS (P=0.0348) but not OS (P=0.741) and DSS (P=0.0972) (Fig. 6 (F)-(H)). Additionally, we analyzed the associations between CNV and Rac3 expression among the 33 human cancers (Fig. 6 (I)). As shown in Fig. 6 (J), positive correlations could be found between CNV and Rac3 expression of 16 human cancers (FDR<=0.05), including BRCA, LUAD, LUSC, OV, LIHC, CESC, KIRP, HNSC, PAAD, ESCA, UCEC, UCS, STAD, LGG, BLCA, and SKCM. Meanwhile, Rac3 CNV was significantly correlated with poor OS of ACC (P=0.046), COAD (P=0.0058), ESCA (P=0.019), KICH (P=0.0019), LAML (P=0.04), LIHC (P=0.046), PRAD (P=0.013), SARC (P=0.044), and UCEC (P=6.8e-07) (Fig. 6 (K)-(L)).\nFurthermore, we performed DNA methylation analysis about Rac3 in different human cancers. Hypermethylation of Rac3 occurred in various cancers, including BLCA, BRCA, CESC, CHOL, COAD, ESCA, KIRC, KIRP, LICH, and READ, while hypomethylation in HNSC, LUAD, LUSC, PRAD, and TGCT (Fig. 7 (A)). Interestingly, Rac3 methylation levels were positively correlated with dysfunctional T cell phenotypes (Fig. 7 (B)), and for patients with brain, melanoma, metastatic melanoma, and breast cancers, hypomethylation of Rac3 induced a poor OS prognosis (Fig. 7 (C)-(F)). These results suggested that methylation of Rac3 was related to dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes and affected the prognosis of the brain, melanoma, metastatic melanoma, and breast cancers.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Firstly, the 100 Rac3-binding and interacted proteins were obtained from the STRING and GeneMANIA databases, respectively (Fig. 8 (A)-(B)). Cross analysis of the above two groups manifested 18 common proteins: PARD6A, IQGAP3, RAC1, PAK1, ARHGEF4, DOCK2, WASF3, ARHGDIA, RALBP1, RAC2, PARD6B, RHOC, ARHGDIG, PARD6G, ABLIM3, WAS, IQGAP2, and ARHGDIB (Fig. 8 (C)). We found that the 18 common proteins were categorized into five protein classes by PANTHER, in which protein-binding activity modulator (57.9%, PC00095) and cell junction protein (15.8%, PC00070) were the two largest classes (Fig. 8 (D)). Then, we performed the biological process of GO analysis of these overlapped proteins by using both Metascape and PANTHER. The results of Metascape showed that most of these proteins were linked to regulation of cellular localization (GO: 0060341), regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization (GO: 0032956), actin filament polymerization (GO: 0030041), lamellipodium assembly (GO: 0030032), small GTPase mediated signal transduction (GO: 0007264), and positive regulation of protein phosphorylation (GO: 0001934) (Fig. 8 (E), (G)). As shown in Fig. 8 (F), the PANTHER analysis data further suggested that these proteins mostly participated in biological regulation (23.3%, GO: 0065007), cellular process (26.7%, GO: 0009987), and response to stimulus (13.3%, GO: 0050896). The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were primarily enriched in axon guidance (hsa04360), regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and neurotrophin signaling pathway (hsa04722) (Fig. 8 (H)-(I)). Furthermore, from the GSCA database, the activity of cell cycle pathway between high and low Rac3 expression groups was found in BLCA, BRCA, KIRC, LUAD, STAD, and UCES (Fig. 8 (J))."

The results showed that Rac3 had a markedly positive correlation with six types of immune infiltrating cells, including monocyte, Bcell, gamma_delta, CD8_naive, effector_memory, and neutrophil but a markedly negative correlation with central_memory, CD4_T, iTreg, Tfh, Tr1, and Cytotoxic in most human cancers (Fig. 10 (A)). Recent studies have reported that cancer-associated fibroblasts of the tumor microenvironment might participate in regulating functions of infiltrating immune cells. Thus, we applied four algorithms, including EPIC, MCPCOUNTER, XCELL, and TIDE, to analyze the correlation between Rac3 expression and infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts among various human cancers. Interestingly, Rac3 expression had a significant positive association with tumor infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts in BLCA, CESC, and PAAD but a significant negative association in BRCA, GBM, LIHC, and PRAD (Fig. 10 (B)). We used TIDE to compare the biomarker of Rac3 with existing biomarkers in ICB. It was found that Rac3 achieved higher predictive values (AUC>0.5) in 10 of the 25 ICB subcohorts. Compared with the standardized biomarkers, we revealed that Rac3 obtained more counts of the predictive score (AUC>0.5) than tumor mutational burden (TMB), T-cell clonality (T.Clonality), and B-cell clonality (B.Clonality), but fewer counts than microsatellite instability (MSI) score, cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), and so on (Fig. 10 (C)). Next, we observed that Rac3 expression had a significant difference between immunotherapy responders and nonresponders in urothelial cancer (P=0.0118) (Fig. 10 (D)). Furthermore, glioblastoma and melanoma patients with Rac3 low expression might obtain the clinical benefits from ICB therapy (PD-1), which was negatively correlated with dysfunctional T cell phenotypes and induced a favorable prognosis. However, bladder patients with Rac3 high expression might have the clinical benefits from ICB therapy (PDL-1) but were negatively associated with dysfunctional T cell phenotypes (Fig. 10 (E)). Finally, we investigated the correlation between Rac3 expression and various immune-related molecules across TCGA cancers. The results revealed that Rac3 expression was closely associated with different immune cells, including immunoinhibitors, immunostimulators, chemokines, and receptors (Fig. 10 (F)-(I)). The immunoinhibitors showed that Rac3 expression had the highest correlation with PVRL2 in VUM (Spearman: rho=0.561, P=1.09e-07) and the lowest correlation with TGFBR1 (Spearman: rho=-0.619, P<2.2e-16) in THCA, respectively. The immunostimulators showed that Rac3 expression had the highest correlation with CD276 (Spearman: rho=0.542, P=3.42e-07) in VUM and the lowest correlation with IL6R (Spearman: rho=-0.539, P=1.17e-07) in MESO, respectively. We found the most correlations with Rac3 expression for chemokines, including CCL26 (TGCT, rho=0.502, P=2.04e-11) and CCL2 (GBM, rho=-0.43, P=1.07e-08). We found the most correlations with Rac3 expression for receptors, including CCR10 (PAAD, rho=0.378502, P=2.23e-07) and CCR9 (PAAD, rho=-0.478, P=1.25e-11)."

            "heading": "IV. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this study, we first revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Rac3 were widely expressed in normal human tissues and tumor tissues. From the TCGA and CCLE databases, it was found that the Rac3 mRNA expression in the tumor tissues of prostate cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer was generally higher than in other cancers. Compared with normal tissues, Rac3 mRNA levels were significantly overexpressed in BLCA, CESC, DLBC, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, OV, PAAD, PRAD, SKCM, THCA, THYM, UCEC, and UCS, while it was underexpressed in KIRC and LAML. The results were further supported by previous studies involving in bladder cancer [10], [11], lung adenocarcinoma [14], [38], breast cancer [39], [40], prostate carcinomas [41], brain tumors [42], colitis-associated cancer [43], and acute myeloid leukemia [44]. Moreover, the protein expression of Rac3 was highly expressed in lung cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, urothelial cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, and skin cancer from the HPA database. Remarkably, compared with normal human tissues, we found that the Rac3 protein expression was higher in the primary tumor tissues of KIRC and LIHC but lower in the primary tumor tissues of GBM and OV. These findings indicated that Rac3 might be an oncogenic gene in most human cancers and involve tumorigenesis. Thus, Rac3 might be used as a biomarker for the early detection of these cancers. Furthermore, we found that Rac3 expression was meaningfully correlated with molecular subtypes of sixteen cancers, including ACC, BRCA, COAD, GBM, HNSC, KIRP, LGG, LIHC, LUSC, OV, PCPG, PRAD, READ, SKCM, STAD, and UCEC. There were significant associations between Rac3 expression and six immune subtypes in fifteen cancers. In particular, Rac3 expression was significantly correlated with both molecular subtypes and immune subtypes in ten cancer types, including BRCA, HNSC, KIRP, LGG, LIHC, LUSC, OV, PRAD, UCEC, and STAD, which implied that Rac3 might play a critical role in cancer immune therapy. Our study first revealed the significant correlations between Rac3 expression and molecular subtypes or immune subtypes in most cancer types. Thus, to investigate the functions of Rac3 in one of these cancers, we could obtain a new entry point by analyzing the remarkable molecular subtype or immune subtypes. The results of Rac3 survival analysis indicated distinct differences for various human cancers. High Rac3 expression could cause a worse OS, DSS, or PFS in some cancer types, but the opposite conclusions might occur in others. Recent studies revealed that Rac3 was overexpressed by confirmed with qRT-PCR and western blot results and indicated a poor prognosis in bladder cancer [10], [45]. Ramos et al. revealed that Rac3 levels were increased in AML compared with healthy donors [44]. Rac3 was overexpressed and associated with more prolonged survival in LUAD patients [38], [46]. RAC3 was overexpressed in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancers and implied poor recurrence free survival [39]. Therein, we need to point out that Rac3 expression was significantly correlated with OS, DSS, and PFS in five cancer types (ACC, LGG, KIRC, MESO, and SARC), in which high Rac3 expression suggested poor OS, DSS, and PFS of ACC, KIRC, MESO, and SARC except for LGG. Additionally, we found that there was a significant correlation between high Rac3 expression and poor OS (P=0.010387), DSS (P=0.002272) of BLCA from l65 BLCA cases of GSE13507 cohorts, and LGG patients with high Rac3 mRNA levels demonstrated good OS from 74 cases of GSE4412 cohorts (P=0.000373). These results further supported our above findings. Genomic alteration played an essential role in the occurrence and development of human cancers [36], [47]. Costain et al. showed that the missense variants of Rac3 might cause a novel brain disorder [48]. Rac3 was a hypomethylated gene in colorectal cancer and correlated with a worse prognosis [49]. We found that genetic alterations of Rac3 occurred in most types of human cancer, in which the 'Amplification' and 'mutation' types were the most types of Rac3 alterations, and the 'missense' types of A95V, D65N, P34L/T, and P185L were the most frequent mutation sites. Hwang et al. revealed that mutation of Rac3 occurred in human brain tumors [42], which further confirmed our findings. The specific gene mutation can be used to predict the prognosis of human cancers. Our results showed that Rac3 genetic alterations were statistically associated with poor prognosis in PFS (P=0.0348) but not OS and DSS. Furthermore, Rac3 expression was significantly correlated with CNV in 16 human cancers and significantly related to the prognosis of nine human cancers, including in ACC, COAD, ESCA, KICH, LAML, LIHC, PRAD, SARC, and UCEC. Somatic mutations might produce new antigens for activating T cells and leading to immune responses [50]. Thus, we further found significant correlations between Rac3 CNA and immune cell infiltration in BLCA, BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LUAD, LUSC, PRAD, SKCM, and UCEC. For instance, the 'arm-level gain' alteration status of Rac3 significantly changed the immune infiltration levels of B cell,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

DNA methylation was a critical epigenetic factor of human cancers and used to diagnose human cancers [51], [52]. Compared with normal human tissues, we found that methylation of Rac3 had a statistical difference across TCGA cancers and negatively correlated with mRNA Rac3 expression levels. Hypomethylation of Rac3 was correlated with dysfunctional T cell phenotypes and induced a worse prognosis of the brain, melanoma, metastatic melanoma, and breast cancers. These results suggested that genomic alteration of Rac3 could affect Rac3 expression in TCGA cancers and immuno-invasive phenotypes and the prognosis of various types of cancers. These findings implied that Rac3 might serve as a diagnostic predictor of different cancers and a target of cancer therapies. Previous research showed that overexpression of RAC3 could activate Janus kinases (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway by PYCR1 to promote proliferation and invasion of BLCA cells [11] and regulate the ERK signaling pathway to promote proliferation and migration of LUAD cells [38]. It controlled the proliferation of breast cancer cells by the Rac3\u2013Pak pathway [53]. A single gene can not regulate the entire process of cancer development and progression, and usually conjoins with other related genes [13], [54], [55]. In this study, we firstly obtained 18 Rac3-related proteins intersecting from the STRING and GeneMANIA databases, including PARD6A, IQGAP3, RAC1, PAK1, ARHGEF4, DOCK2, WASF3, ARHGDIA, RALBP1, RAC2, PARD6B, RHOC, ARHGDIG, PARD6G, ABLIM3, WAS, IQGAP2, and ARHGDIB, which were mainly categorized into the 'proteinbinding activity modulator' and 'cell junction protein' protein classes. Then we used these intersected genes to perform KEGG and GO enrichment analysis. It was found that they were linked to regulation of cellular localization, regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, actin filament polymerization, and small GTPase mediated signal transduction. Rho family GTPases could regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton [56], which was further supported our findings. The pathways were primarily enriched in axon guidance, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and neurotrophin signaling pathway. Additionally, the activity of the cell cycle pathway between high and low Rac3 expression groups was found in six types of human cancers, including BLCA, BRCA, KIRC, LUAD, STAD, and UCES. Wang et al. found that Rac3 regulated the proliferation of LUAD cells by cell cycle pathway [46], which was consistent with our results. Infiltrating immune cells played a crucial role in the occurrence, progression, and metastasis of various human cancers [57]-[59]. Cancer-associated fibroblasts were essential for cancer progression and regulated functions of various infiltrating immune cells [60], [61]. We found that Rac3 was expressed in immune and blood cells at the single cell types perspective and closely associated with various immune-related molecules. Rac3 was a markedly positive correlation with six types of immune infiltrating cells but a markedly negative correlation with central_memory, CD4_T, iTreg, Tfh, Tr1, and cytotoxic across most human cancers. Moreover, we found that Rac3 expression was positively associated with tumor infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts in BLCA, CESC, and PAAD but had a negative association in BRCA, GBM, LIHC, and PRAD (Pvalue<=0.05). We showed a significant difference in Rac3 expression between immunotherapy responders and nonresponders in Urothelial cancer. Guo et al. revealed that macrophage and myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration was prevented by downregulation of Rac family protein expression in mice colon tissues [43]. Qu et al. structured a prognostic index based on nine immune-related genes (including Rac3) to assess the immune status and prognosis of BLCA patients [62], which further verified our findings. Upregulation of Rac3 might increase tumor immune response in BLCA [63]. Our results suggested that Rac3 might interact with various immune cells and be an immunotherapy target for human cancers. More public datasets could help to validate the efficacy of immunotherapy associated with Rac3 mutation. Radiomic analysis in coclinical studies could help to assess response to therapy [64], [65]. Compared with the existing works, our study not only expanded the understanding of the Rac3 roles in pan cancers but also obtained new meaningful findings. Previous research that investigated differential expression of Rac3 focused on a single type of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukemia [44], bladder cancer [10], colitis-associated cancer [43], and lung Adenocarcinoma [38]. However, Pan-cancer analysis can provide a comprehensive insight into the Rac3 roles. Our findings showed that Rac3 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in fifteen types of human cancer but downregulated in two cancer types. Meanwhile, Rac3 expression was significantly correlated with both molecular subtypes and immune subtypes in ten cancer types, which provided a new entry point for the understanding of the potential functions of Rac3 by analyzing the molecular subtype or immune subtypes. Engers et al. found that increased Rac protein expression was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival in prostate carcinomas [41]. With the CPTAC database, we also found statistical differences in the protein expression of Rac3 between primary KIRC, GBM, LIHC, and OV and paired normal tissues. Costain et al. revealed that the missense variants of Rac3 might cause a novel brain disorder [48]. Our results showed that the missense substitution of Rac3 was the primary mutation type in pan cancers and mainly occurred in C>T and G>A. Moreover, Rac3 genetic alterations significantly shortened the survival time of PFS. Wang et al. found that Rac3 used the cell cycle pathway to regulate the proliferation of LUAD cells [46]. We also revealed that the activity of the cell cycle pathway between high and low Rac3\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "Taken together, we first performed a pan-cancer analysis to reveal the Rac3 roles in different human cancers. Our results showed that the mRNA and protein of Rac3 were widely expressed in various normal human tissues and cancer tissues, and Rac3 was remarkably overexpressed in different types of cancers. Rac3 expression was statistically correlated with immune and molecular subtypes, survival prognosis, mutative status, DNA methylation, immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapy in various cancers, which could contribute to understanding the Rac3 roles in the occurrence and development of human cancers, and explore new cancer treatment strategies. However, further studies (e.g., clinical experiment [11], [49], mechanism research [66], and algorithm verification [67], [68]) are required to validate our findings before clinical application in various cancers. Our study workflow can be easily used for multiple omics analysis of other genes, even gene families, from different perspectives, revealing the potential functions of these interesting genes in various cancers."
