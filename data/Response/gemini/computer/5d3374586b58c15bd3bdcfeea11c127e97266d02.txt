1. **Investigate the effectiveness of unlikelihood training objectives for non-exact repetition suppression and content moderation in different language models and domains.** The current study focuses on a specific language model (BART) and a particular domain (text rewriting). Future research could explore the generalizability of the proposed methods to other language models and domains, such as dialogue generation, machine translation, and summarization.


2. **Explore the use of different negative candidate selection strategies for unlikelihood training objectives.** The current study uses a simple strategy for selecting negative candidates (i.e., previous tokens or n-grams). Future research could investigate more sophisticated strategies, such as using a language model to generate negative candidates or using a reinforcement learning approach to learn the optimal negative candidate selection strategy.


3. **Develop new methods for evaluating the effectiveness of non-exact repetition suppression and content moderation techniques.** The current study uses a variety of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Future research could develop new metrics that are more sensitive to the specific types of repetition and offensive content that are being suppressed.


4. **Investigate the impact of non-exact repetition suppression and content moderation techniques on the overall performance of language models.** The current study shows that the proposed methods can reduce repetition and offensive content while maintaining minimum impact on model performance. Future research could investigate the impact of these methods on other aspects of language model performance, such as fluency, coherence, and informativeness.


5. **Explore the use of non-exact repetition suppression and content moderation techniques in real-world applications.** The current study focuses on evaluating the proposed methods in a controlled experimental setting. Future research could explore the use of these methods in real-world applications, such as writing assistance tools, chatbots, and social media platforms.
