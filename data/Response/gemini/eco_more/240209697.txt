1. **Investigate the impact of different noise models on the equilibrium outcomes.** The paper assumes that the noise added by the platforms is Gaussian, but other noise models could be more appropriate in different settings. For example, one could consider a model where the noise is uniformly distributed or a model where the noise is correlated across platforms.
2. **Extend the model to consider more complex user preferences.** The paper assumes that the user's preferences are linear, but in reality, user preferences are often more complex. For example, one could consider a model where the user's preferences are non-linear or a model where the user's preferences are influenced by the actions of other users.
3. **Analyze the impact of competition on the equilibrium outcomes.** The paper assumes that the platforms compete in a Bertrand duopoly, but other competition models could be more appropriate in different settings. For example, one could consider a model where the platforms compete in a Cournot duopoly or a model where the platforms compete in a more complex oligopoly.
4. **Examine the impact of regulation on the equilibrium outcomes.** The paper considers a few specific regulations, but there are many other regulations that could be considered. For example, one could consider a regulation that limits the amount of data that platforms can collect or a regulation that requires platforms to obtain explicit consent from users before sharing their data.
5. **Develop a more general model that can be applied to a wider range of settings.** The paper's model is tailored to a specific setting, but it could be generalized to apply to a wider range of settings. For example, one could consider a model that can be applied to the market for online advertising or a model that can be applied to the market for social media data.
