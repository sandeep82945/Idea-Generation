1. **Investigate the effectiveness of VR in treating specific symptoms of schizophrenia.** For example, one study could examine the effectiveness of VR in reducing hallucinations, while another could investigate its impact on social cognition.


2. **Develop new VR scenarios that are tailored to the individual needs of patients with schizophrenia.** This could involve creating scenarios that are specific to the patient's symptoms, interests, and cultural background.


3. **Explore the use of VR in combination with other treatments for schizophrenia.** For example, one study could examine the effectiveness of VR in combination with medication, while another could investigate its use in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of VR treatment for schizophrenia.** This could involve following patients for a period of time after they have completed VR treatment to see if the benefits of treatment are maintained.


5. **Develop VR-based tools to help patients with schizophrenia manage their symptoms in everyday life.** This could include tools that help patients to identify and cope with triggers, or tools that help them to practice social skills.
