Here, we investigate magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), magnetic and electronic properties of VSi2P4 by using the generalized gradient approximation plus U (GGA+U) approach. For large U , the magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA) energy has a more pronounced contribution to the MAE, which can overcome the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy to evince an easy-plane. For fixed out-of-plane MA, monolayer VSi2P4 undergoes ferrovalley (FV), half-valley-metal (HVM), valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall insulator (VQAHI), HVM and FV states with increasing U . However, for assumptive in-plane MA, there is no special quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state and spontaneous valley polarization within considered U range. According to the MAE and electronic structure with fixed out-of-plane or in-plane MA, the intrinsic phase diagram shows common magnetic semiconductor (CMS), FV and VQAHI in monolayer VSi2P4. At representative U=3 eV widely used in references, VSi2P4 can be regarded as a 2D-XY magnet, not Ising-like 2D long-range order magnets predicted in previous works with only considering MCA energy. Our findings shed light on importance of MSA in determining magnetic and electronic properties of monolayer VSi2P4.\nKeywords: Magnetic anisotropy, 2D ferromagnets, Phase transition Email:sandongyuwang@163.com\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThere has been a tremendous interest in searching 2D magnetic materials, which can interplay with other important properties of materials such as FV, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity and QAH effects. According to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, the long-range magnetic order at finite temperature for the 2D isotropic Heisenberg spin systems is prohibited1. Experimentally, both the CrI3 monolayer and Cr2Ge2Te6 bilayer show an easy out-ofplane magnetization2,3, while the 2D magnet CrCl3 has an easy in-plane magnetization4,5. The underlying mechanism is that MA is responsible for the stable 2D magnetic order. With the presence of out-of-plane magnetization, the long-range FM order can sustain at finite temperature by opening a magnon gap to resist thermal agitations6. An easy-plane anisotropy can realize the quasi-ordered topological vortex/antivortex pairs, which can be described by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory based on the 2D XY model7. Moreover, MA can affect the symmetry of 2D systems, and then produce important influence on their topological and valley properties8\u201311, when the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) is included. For these 2D systems, the FV and QAH states can exist with fixed out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, but these special states disappear for in-plane case9\u201311. The magnetization direction can be determined by MAE, which mainly include MCA and MSA energies. Compared with SOC-induced MCA, the MSA due to the magnetic dipole-dipole (D-D) interaction is often relatively weak and is neglected. But for a 2D system with weak MCA, the MSA may have an important con-\ntribution. The representative example is 2D magnet CrCl3, which has been confirmed to have an easy in-plane magnetization in experiment4,5. When only considering MCA energy, the CrCl3 shows an easy out-of-plane magnetization, which is contrary to experimental results12. When including MSA energy, the theoretical results agree well with experimental in-plane magnetization12. Another case is CrSBr monolayer13. The MCA energy shows that the b axis is the easy one, and the a axis would be hard. When including MSA energy, the MAE gives the easy magnetization b axis and hard c axis.\nRecently, the septuple-atomic-layer 2D MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 have been successfully synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method14. Subsequently, 2D MA2Z4 family with a septuple-atomic-layer structure has been established, which possess emerging topological, magnetic, valley and superconducting properties15. The VA2Z4 of them possess magnetic properties, which have been widely investigated9,16\u201321 due to their FV properties. The monolayer VSi2P4 is a typical example, which is predicted to have out-of-plane magnetization with only considering MCA energy (6.38 \u00b5eV)17. In recent works, the Janus monolayer VSiGeN4 is predicted to be in-plane magnetization with only considering MCA energy, and the in-plane magnetization is enhanced, when including MSA energy (about -17 \u00b5eV)18,21. This implies that VSi2P4 may be an in-plane 2D XY magnet without the long-range FM order. In this work, we investigate MCA energy, MSA energy, MAE and electronic structures of VSi2P4 as a function of U , and reveal the importance of MSA in determining its magnetic, topological and valley properties. At representative U=3 eV9,15\u201321, VSi2P4\n2\ncan be regarded as a 2D-XY magnet, which is different from previous conclusion that the Ising-like 2D longrange order magnet is predicted with only considering MCA energy9,17. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we shall give our computational details and methods. In the next few sections, we shall present structure and MAE, and electronic structures of VSi2P4 monolayer. Finally, we shall give our conclusion."

            "text": "The crystal structures of monolayer VSi2P4 are plotted in Figure 1, along with the first BZ with high-symmetry points. The primitive cell contains one V, two Si, and four P atoms, which is stacked by seven atomic layers of P-Si-P-V-P-Si-P. Each V atom is coordinated with six P atoms, which forms a trigonal prismatic configuration. In other words, this VP2 layer is sandwiched by two Si-P bilayers, and the crystal symmetry of VSi2P4 is P 6\u0304m2 (No.187) with broken inversion symmetry. The optimized lattice constants a of VSi2P4 monolayer is 3.486 A\u030a, agreeing well with previous theoretical value9.\nBased on Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules33,34, the superexchange coupling between two V atoms is FM, because the V-P-V bonding angle is 91.68\u25e6, which is close to 90\u25e6. To confirm this, the energy differences (per formula unit) between AFM and FM ordering as a function of U are also plotted in FIG.1 of electronic supplementary information (ESI). Calculated results show that the FM state is always the magnetic ground state of VSi2P4 within considered U range. It is found that energy difference between AFM and FM ordering around U=1.45 eV has a sudden jump, which is due to abrupt change of magnetic moment of V atom for AFM ordering (The magnetic moment of V atom changes from 0.74 \u00b5B to 0 \u00b5B to 0.079 \u00b5B to 0.81 \u00b5B , when U varies from 1.3 eV to 1.4 eV to 1.5 eV to 1.6 eV), and the small magnetic moment of V atom reduces the magnetic interaction energy. Similar phenomenon can be observed, when energy difference between AFM and FM ordering is as a function of strain for VSiGeN4 and VSi2P4 17,21.\nThe orientation of magnetization plays an important role on magnetic and electronic states of some 2D materials8\u201311. The MAE can be used to measure the dependence of the energy on the orientation of magnetization. The MAE originates mainly from two parts: (1) MCA energy EMCA, which is an intrinsic property of the material caused by the SOC; (2) MSA energy EMSA),\n3 0 1 2 3 4 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 (a) out-of-plane In-plane M C A ( eV )\nU (eV)\n0 1 2 3 4\n-14\n-13\n-12\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n(b)\nU (eV)\nM SA\n( eV\n)\n0 1 2 3 4\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\nIn-plane\nout-of-plane\nU (eV)\nM AE\n( eV\n)\n(c)\nFIG. 2.

For the monolayer with a collinear FM, when the spins lie in the\nplane, the Equation 1 can be written as:\nE || D\u2212D =\n1\n2\n\u00b50M 2\n4\u03c0\n\u2211\ni6=j\n1\nr3ij [1\u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8ij ] (2)\nwhere \u03b8ij is the angle between the ~M and ~rij . When the spins are out of plane (\u03b8ij=90\n\u25e6), the Equation 1 can further be simplified as:\nE\u22a5D\u2212D = 1\n2\n\u00b50M 2\n4\u03c0\n\u2211\ni6=j\n1\nr3ij (3)\nThe EMSA (E || D\u2212D \u2212 E \u22a5 D\u2212D)can be expressed as:\nEMSA = 3\n2\n\u00b50M 2\n4\u03c0\n\u2211\ni6=j\n1\nr3ij cos2 \u03b8ij (4)\nThe MSA tends to make magnetic moments of magnetic elements directed parallel to the surfaces, which can minimize magnetostatic energy. Usually, the MCA energy dominates the MAE, and MSA energy can be ignored. However, MSA becomes significant to MAE for materials with weak SOC. Firstly, we calculate MCA energy by EMCA = E || SOC\u2212 E\u22a5SOC , which is obtained from GGA+U+SOC calculations. The EMCA as a function of U is plotted in Figure 2 (a). Calculated results show multiple transitions in the MCA. With increasing U , the EMCA changes from negative value to positive value, which means a transition from in-plane to out-of-plane. At U=3.0 eV, the calculated EMCA (about 6 \u00b5eV) is consistent with available result (6.38 \u00b5eV)17. Secondly, we calculate MCA energy by Equation 4, which depends on the crystal structure and local magnetic moment of V (MV ). The MV as a function of U is shown in FIG.2 of ESI. It is found that MV increases (0.89 \u00b5B-1.15 \u00b5B) with increasing U . The EMSA as a function of U is shown in Figure 2 (b), and the EMSA changes from -8 \u00b5eV to -14 \u00b5eV, when U varies from 0 eV to 4 eV. Calculated results show that the MSA is in favour of in-plane anisotropy. Finally, the MAE can be obtained by EMAE=EMCA+EMSA, which is plotted in Figure 2 (c). When U is between 2.03 eV and 2.31 eV, the positive MAE means a preferred out-of-plane polarization. When U>2.31 eV and U<2.03 eV, the in-plane anisotropy can be observed due to negative MAE. For VA2Z4, the U=3 eV has been adopted in previous calculations9,15\u201321. The VSi2P4 is predicted to be an out-of-plane ferromagnet (Ising-like 2D magnets) due to only considering MCA energy17. However, our calculated results show that VSi2P4 can be regarded as a 2D-XY magnet like the CrCl3 monolayer\n4,5,12. The in-plane easy magnetization means that there is no energetic barrier to the rotation of magnetization in the xy plane, and a BKT magnetic transition to a quasi-long-range phase can be observed at a critical temperature35,36. The critical temperature TBKT = 1.335\nJ KB is obtained from the results of the Monte Carlo simulation for 2D-XY magnets on a\n4 triangular lattice37,38, where J is the nearest-neighboring exchange parameter and KB is the Boltzmann constant. In a FM configuration, each V has six neighbors with the same spin, while, for AFM configuration, V has four neighbors with the opposite spin, and has two with the same spin. Based on the Heisenberg spin model, the FM (EFM ) and AFM (EAFM ) energy can be written as:\nEFM = E0 \u2212 (6J + 2A)S 2 (5)\nEAFM = E0 + (2J \u2212 2A)S 2 (6)\nwhere E0 is the total energy of systems without magnetic coupling, and A means the easy-axis single-ion anisotropy. Hence, J can be obtained directly from the energy difference:\nJ = EAFM \u2212 EFM\n8S2 (7)\nThe calculated J is 16.07 meV (S = 1 2 ) at U=3 eV, and the TBKT is predicted to be 249 K."

            "text": "The magnetization is a pseudovector, which will lead to that the out-of-plane FM breaks all possible vertical mirror symmetry of the system, while preserves the horizontal mirror symmetry. The spontaneous valley polarization and a nonvanishing Chern number of 2D system can exist with the preserved horizontal mirror symmetry8. Thus, the MA of 2D system is very important to decide its electronic state. Firstly, the out-of-plane MA is fixed within considered U range. The energy band structures of VSi2P4 at some representative U values are plotted in FIG.3 of ESI. The evolutions of total energy band gap along with those at -K/K point and the valley splitting for both valence and condition bands as a function of U are shown in Figure 3. Around about U=2.20 eV and 2.40 eV, the total energy band gap of VSi2P4 is closed, and the HVM state can be achieved39, whose conduction electrons are intrinsically 100% valley polarized. At about U=2.20 eV (2.40 eV), the band gap of K (-K) valley gets closed, while a band gap at -K (K) valley is kept. In a trigonal prismatic crystal field environment, the V-d orbitals split into low-lying d2z orbital, dxy+dx2\u2212y2 and dxz+dyz orbitals. Calculated results show that dx2\u2212y2+dxy or dz2 orbitals of V atoms dominate K and -K valleys of both valence and conduction bands, and the V-d orbital characters energy band structures at representative U=1.50 eV, 2.25 eV and 3.00 eV are plotted in FIG.4 of ESI. For U<2.20 eV, the dx2\u2212y2+dxy/dz2 orbitals dominate K and -K valleys of valence/conduction bands (For example U=1.50 eV). With increasing U between 2.20 eV and 2.40 eV, the band inversion between dxy+dx2\u2212y2 and dz2 orbitals at K valley can be observed (For example U=2.25 eV), which is accompanied by the first HVM state.

The A and C regions mean in-plane, while the B region for out-of-plane.\nband inversion between dxy+dx2\u2212y2 and dz2 orbitals occurs at -K valley (For example U=3.00 eV), along with the second HVM state. These lead to that the distributions of dx2\u2212y2+dxy and dz2 orbitals of 0 eV<U<2.20 eV are opposite to those of 2.40 eV<U<4 eV.\nThe distributions of Berry curvature are calculated, and they are plotted in FIG.5 at representative U=1.50 eV, 2.25 eV and 3.00 eV. For 0 eV<U<2.20 eV and 2.40\n5\neV<U<4 eV, the opposite signs and different magnitudes for Berry curvatures can be observed around -K and K valleys. However, for 2.20 eV<U<2.40 eV, the Berry curvatures around -K and K valleys show the same signs and different magnitudes. These indicate that the flipping of the sign of Berry curvature will occur at K or -K valley. The positive Berry curvature (For example U=1.50 eV) changes into negative one (For example U=2.25 eV) at K valley, and then the negative Berry curvature (For example U=2.25 eV) changes into positive one (For example U=3.00 eV) at -K valley. The twice flipping of the sign of Berry curvature is related with twice band inversion between dxy+dx2\u2212y2 and dz2 orbitals. With increasing U , twice gap close, band inversion and flipping of the sign of Berry curvature suggest twice topological phase transition, and the QAH state may exist. To confirm this, the edge states and Chern number are calculated. Calculated results show that there are no nontrivial chiral edge states for 0 eV<U<2.20 eV and 2.40 eV<U<4 eV. When U is between 2.20 eV and 2.40 eV, the VSi2P4 is a QAH phase. The edge states at representative U=2.25 eV are plotted in Figure 4, which shows a nontrivial chiral edge state connecting the conduction bands and valence bands, implying a QAH phase. The predicted Chern number C=-1 by integrating the Berry curvature within the first BZ. For 0 eV<U<2.20 eV, the valley splitting of valence band is observable, while the valley splitting of conduction band can be ignored. However, for 2.40 eV<U<4 eV, the opposite situation can be observed with respect to the case of 0 eV<U<2.20 eV. For 2.20 eV<U<2.40 eV, the valley splitting of valence/condition bands decreases/increases from observable/ignored value to ignored/observable one with increasing U . In this region, VSi2P4 is a VQAHI with spontaneous valley splitting and chiral edge states. These can be understood by the distributions of dx2\u2212y2+dxy and dz2 orbitals. If\ndx2\u2212y2+dxy/dz2 orbitals dominate -K and K valleys, the valley splitting will be observable/ignored. The SOC Hamiltonian only involving the interaction of the same spin states mainly contributes to valley polarization, which with out-of-plane magnetization can be simplified as40\u201342:\nH\u03020SOC = \u03b1L\u0302z (8)\n6\nwhere L\u0302z/\u03b1 is to the z component of orbital angular momenta/coupling strength. For dx2\u2212y2+dxy and dz2 orbitals and the wave vector symmetry at the K and -K valleys, the basis functions are chosen as:\n|\u03c6\u03c4 >= \u221a\n1 2 (|dx2\u2212y2 > +i\u03c4 |dxy >)\nor |\u03c6\u03c4 >= |dz2 >\n(9)\nThe resulting energy level at K or -K valley can be defined as:\nE\u03c4 =< \u03c6\u03c4 |H\u03020SOC |\u03c6 \u03c4 > (10)\nwhere the subscript \u03c4 = \u00b11 refers to valley index. If dx2\u2212y2+dxy orbitals dominate -K and K valleys, the valley splitting |\u2206E| is given by:\n|\u2206E| = |EK \u2212 E\u2212K | = 4\u03b1 (11)\nIf the -K and K valleys are mainly from dz2 orbitals, the valley splitting |\u2206E| is expressed as:\n|\u2206E| = |EK \u2212 E\u2212K | = 0 (12)\nClearly, these results agree with the difference of the valley polarizations in the conduction and valence bands with different U from DFT calculations.\nSubsequently, the in-plane MA is assumed to investigate electronic properties of VSi2P4 monolayer as a function of U . The total energy band gap along with those at -K/K point and the valley splitting for both valence and condition bands as a function of U are plotted in Figure 5, and the representative energy band structures are shown in FIG.6 of ESI. With increasing U , the gap decreases, and then increases. In considered U range, the gaps at -K and K points coincide completely, and the valley splitting is always zero. These mean that no spontaneous valley polarization and QAH phase can appear in VSi2P4. For dx2\u2212y2+dxy-dominated -K and K valley, \u2206E = 4\u03b1cos\u03b842 with general magnetization orientation, where \u03b8=0/90\u25e6 means out-of-plane/in-plane direction. For in-plane one, the valley splitting of VSi2P4 become zero. Thus, VSiGeN4 monolayer is a common magnetic semiconductor (CMS). According to the MAE and electronic structure discussed above, the intrinsic phase diagram of VSi2P4 monolayer is shown in Figure 6, and the electronic state includes CMS, FV and VQAHI. For VA2Z4, the U=3 eV has been widely used in previous calculations9,15\u201321. The phase diagram shows that VSi2P4 intrinsically is not a FV material. However, the FV states can be easily achieved by external magnetic field due to small MAE. The external magnetic field to overcome energy barrier from in-plane to out-of-plane as a function of U is plotted in Figure 7. At U=3 eV, the energy barrier is equivalent to applying a external magnetic field of around 0.03- 0.06 T. Although the U can not be directly tuned in experiment, it can be regulated equivalently by strain, which has been confirmed in monolayer RuBr2\n11. For a given material, the correlation strength should be fixed. Even though VSi2P4 dose not belong to special QAH phase in the phase diagram, the QAH state can be realized by strain or external magnetic field and strain. Strain-induce QAH states have been predicted in many 2D systems11,19,21,43."
