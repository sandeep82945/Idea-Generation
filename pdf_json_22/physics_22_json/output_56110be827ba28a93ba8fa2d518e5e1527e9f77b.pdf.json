    "abstractText": "Free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on atmospheric laser communications is expected to play an important role in the global continuous-variable quantum key distribution network. The practical homodyne detector model is applied in free-space continuousvariable quantum key distribution which models the imperfect characteristics including the detection efficiency and the electronic noise. In the conventional model, we must calibrate them simultaneously. In the modified model, only one of the imperfections needs to be calibrated to simplify the calibration process of the practical experiments, also known as one-time calibration. The feasibility of the modified detector model against the fast-fading channel is proved. The results of the symmetry operations are considered when presenting detailed security analysis. Some remarkable features of the uniform fast-fading channel were found from the simulation results. The performances of the conventional model and the modified model are similar but the modified model has the advantage of achieving one-time calibration.",

            "text": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) [1] provides an effective way to withstand the threat of quantum computing on today\u2019s cryptosystems [2,3]. Based on the quantum mechanics principles, QKD allows both legal users, normally called Alice and Bob, to generate a secure key through an untrusted quantum channel. Due to development over the last three decades, QKD can be divided into discrete-variable QKD based on single photon detection, and continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) based on coherent detection [4\u20137]. Due to the simpler detection method, CV-QKD has higher compatibility with the existing optical communication systems [8], and the transmission distance achieved recently can support the requirement in metropolitan distances [9,10], which facilitates the large-scale application of QKD [11\u201319]. Beyond the metropolitan distance, the question of how to connect two remote parties with few repeaters is one of the key factors restricting the CV-QKD. The transmissivity will decay exponentially with the distance in a ground-based fiber link, which limits the secret key rate. However, if two remote parties on the ground are connected by a satellite, the loss introduced by the channel may be far less than the ground-based fiber connection. In addition, as satellites rapidly move around the Earth, the secret keys physically travel between two locations, making it a reality to distribute quantum keys over long distances and even across oceans [20\u201322]. Therefore, the study of free space CV-QKD is of great practical significance [23]. Channel parameter estimation is an important part of CV-QKD protocol because it enables both communication parties to evaluate the upper limit of leaked information [6,7].\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1271. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14061271 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nIn free-space, the channel fading [24\u201326], whose transmissivity changes because of air turbulence, makes the problem more complex [27\u201331]. The analysis of the channel fading is a core problem of any free-space CV-QKD protocol that does not depend on fiber facilities, especially the long-distance QKD implementations via a satellite [32\u201335]. In previous studies, the analysis of the channel fading is carried out under the condition of the ideal detector [24,26,36]. However, it is impossible to use the ideal detector in practical experiments, and the imperfect characteristics [37] of the practical detector need to be considered in the security analysis. In this paper, we introduce two trusted detector models and the modified one is applied to achieve one-time calibration. Next is the theory of the fast-fading channel. To simplify this problem, we assume the fast-fading channel is uniform and with transmissivity that follows the uniform probability distribution. Previous studies [38] have analyzed that both the user and the eavesdropper suffer the channel fading simultaneously and their channel parameters are given by averaging all the possibilities of the fading channel. However, we will consider the worst-case scenario in which the transmissivity over the uniform fast-fading channel will be completely controlled by the eavesdropper. Based on this, we investigate practical CV-QKD with an imperfect detector over a uniform fastfading channel. Then, we present detailed security analysis and make some simulations to compare the performance of the two trusted models over a uniform fast-fading channel in free-space. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the practical detector modeling in free-space CV-QKD; Section 3 presents detailed security analysis through giving the deduction for the secret key rate; Section 4 makes some simulations and discusses the results, and in Section 5 we provide our conclusions."

            "heading": "2.1. Imperfections and Trusted Model of the Practical Homodyne Detector",
            "text": "From Figure 1, the imperfections of the homodyne detector mainly include detection efficiency and electronic noise. The certain shortage of detection efficiency mainly comes from three aspects. Firstly, the splitting ratio of the 3 dB coupler is not as accurate as 50:50. Furthermore, it is necessary to use a pair of PDs with symmetrical performance in practical detectors, but it is very difficult to select electronic components with symmetrical performance. Besides, the detection efficiency of each PD is not ideal, resulting in loss. The noise leads to another imperfect characteristic of the practical detector, electronic noise. The output contains a certain proportion of noise at the presence of four parts: current noise of the amplifier, voltage noise of the amplifier, thermal noise of resistance and dark current noise of PDs. Next, we will rely on these imperfect characteristics to model the practical homodyne detector. We have to establish the trusted models for the practical detector because the ideal detector without imperfections in Figure 2a is impossible in practical experiments. Figure 2b presents the conventional modeling of the detection efficiency and the electronic noise [39]. The extra deficiency can be represented using a BS in front of the ideal homodyne detector, where its transmissivity \u03b7 indicates the detection efficiency. The presence of the electronic noise can be described as coupling a thermal noise vel into the ideal detector from another input of the BS. Specifically, it is modeled as an EPR state with variance VN , in which one mode is coupled into the system. Here VN = 1 + vel/(1\u2212 \u03b7).\nAs a premise, the security of CV-QKD protocols depends on the equivalence of the prepare-and-measure (PM) model and the entanglement-based (EB) model. In practical experiments, the PM model will use the shot-noise unit (SNU) to normalize the output. In order to realize the equivalence between the two models, the normalized output of the PM model has to be the same as the output of the EB model.\nConsidering the output of the corresponding PM model,\nXout = AXLO( \u221a \u03b7d x\u0302B + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7d x\u0302v1) + Xele, (1)\nwhere A represents the amplification within a practical homodyne detector, XLO describes the variable of the local oscillator (LO), Xele describes a Gaussian variable and its variance is Vele. x\u0302v1 has a variance of 1. The SNU is defined as uS = A\n2X2LO. Therefore, the output normalized by the SNU is given by\nxout = Xout\u221a uS = ( \u221a\n\u03b7d x\u0302B + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7d x\u0302v1) + Xele\nAXLO . (2)\nFrom the EB scheme in Figure 2b, the output of the conventional EB model is the same as Equation (2). However, the trusted conventional practical detector model needs all imperfections to be calibrated. For example, if only the detection efficiency is calibrated without the electronic noise having been calibrated, the model will be invalid. This means both sides of the communication still have to regard the practical detector as completely untrustworthy even though the detection efficiency has been calibrated. A modified detector model has been proposed to settle the issue. The purpose of the modified detector model is to acheive one-time calibration and flexibly model the practical detector according to its own situation (calibrating the electronic noise individually or calibrating the detection efficiency individually). As shown in the first EB model in Figure 2c, \u03b7d describes the detection efficiency while \u03b7e describes the electronic noise. The output of the EB model can be obtained directly,\nx\u0302hom = \u221a \u03b7e( \u221a \u03b7d x\u0302B + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7d x\u0302v1) + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7e x\u0302v2 , (3)\nwhere both x\u0302v1 and x\u0302v2 have a variance of 1. In the modified detector model, a new SNU which is not the same as the conventional detector model is defined as umodi f iedS = A\n2X2LO + Vele [37,40\u201342], where Vele represents the variance of Xele, so the output normalized by the new SNU is given by\nxmodi f iedout = Xout\u221a\numodi f iedS\n= AXLO\u221a\nA2X2LO + Vele ( \u221a\n\u03b7d x\u0302B + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7d x\u0302v1) + Xele\u221a\nA2X2LO + Vele . (4)\nHere, Xele will be substituted using \u221a Vele x\u0302v2 , and x\u0302v2 has a variance of 1. Then,\nxmodi f iedout = AXLO\u221a\nA2X2LO + Vele ( \u221a\n\u03b7d x\u0302B + \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7d x\u0302v1) + \u221a\nVele\u221a A2X2LO + Vele x\u0302v2 . (5)\nCompare Equations (3) and (5), if we assume\n\u03b7e = A2X2LO\nA2X2LO + Vele , (6)\nthe output of the PM model normalized by the new SNU can be the same as the output of the modified EB model. That means if only the detection efficiency is calibrated without the electronic noise having been calibrated, the modified detector model is still valid. Furthermore, we would then also want to obtain the relationship of the conventional model and the modified model. vel , which describes the electronic noise within the conventional model, results after the normalization of Vele by us. Therefore, by dividing us on both the numerator and the denominator in Equation (6),\n\u03b7e = 1\n1 + vel . (7)\nThis is the relationship between two parameters vel and \u03b7e, both of which are used to describe electronic noise in different models. Another case presented in Figure 2c is a variation to describe the practical detector. The difference from the last one is the positions of two beam splitters. When the PM model only calibrates the detection efficiency, the modified model is still valid. That means it can model the practical detector only by calibrating one of the imperfect characteristics, also known as one-time calibration, instead of calibrating all the imperfect characteristics at the same time as the conventional detector model. Therefore, the modified model can greatly improve the flexibility of detector modeling. In practical experiments, the second model in Figure 2c is more widely used because the detection\nefficiency is relatively stable while the noise is easily affected by temperature, time and so on. In this paper, we will also adopt this model."

            "text": "In this work, we will study a fast-fading communication scheme to implement the practical CV-QKD between two remote parties. There exists a direct communication channel eavesdropped by eavesdroppers between communication users. In fixed-type channels (e.g., fiber-optical links), the channel parameter transmissivity can be perfectly aligned between Alice and Bob at each time instant. In free-space, however, such alignment is not maintained and we need to consider a process of instantaneous transmissivity wandering which comes from the atmospheric turbulence. Thus, changes caused by atmospheric turbulence and other factors in the communication line of the two remote parties can be modeled as a fading channel with a nature that is radically different from the fixed-attenuation channel. An important criterion for evaluating channel simulations is accuracy, which is usually evaluated by the statistical characteristics of the channel parameters, given the randomness of the channel output. The fading channel parameters will be affected under conditions of air turbulence. For example, the atmospheric visibility and the size distribution of the scatting particles will influence the transmissivity while the phase fluctuation will influence the excess noise. Then, the transmissivity T within the channel between the communication sides is variable and follows the probability distribution [24,43]. To simplify this problem, we will assume the most random scenario where transmissivity follows a uniform probability distribution PT which has extreme value Tmax and Tmin = Tmax \u2212 \u2206T and the excess noise is a fixed value. In free-space, fading channels can be divided into fast-fading channels and slow-fading channels according to the changing rate of the channel transmissivity. For the slow-fading channel, the eavesdroppers\u2019s attack is slow, which means transmissivity can be almost considered as a fixed value over a considerable distance. This permits the two parties to perform the estimation of transmissivity to be used in the extraction of part of the key [36]. When atmospheric turbulence has a large influence, the transmissivity will change rapidly and the honest users cannot estimate its instantaneous value. This kind of channel is the so-called \u201cfast-fading channel\u201d. In atmospheric channels, fluctuations of the transmissivity T can be the result of several effects. In the paper, we will choose the worst-case scenario in which channel fading is absolutely determined by the eavesdropper. This means the transmissivity T is determined by the eavesdropper individually. Figure 3 presents the EB scheme of a practical CV-QKD against a fast-fading channel. Alice first prepared two-mode squeezed vacuum (EPR) states with variance V, and symmetrizes her states. That means Alice preserves one of her modes and sends another mode A through a fast-fading channel with the transmissivity T to Bob. Bob\u2019s homodyne detects the received mode which is measured randomly x or p quadrature, with outcome xB or pB. Finally, communication users perform post-processing, data coordination, and private key amplification. In a fast-fading channel, the excess noise \u03b5 can be described through Eve distributing an EPR state with a thermal noise with a variance of VE \u2265 1, where one mode E1 inputs the system via a BS whose transmissivity is T. The relationship between \u03b5 and VE is VE = 1 + T \u2217 \u03b5/(1\u2212 T). Eve then receives and stores the mode E\u20321."

The key rate is given by\nK = \u03b2IAB \u2212 SBE, (8)\nwhere \u03b2 is the reconciliation efficiency [44\u201346]. In the slow-fading channel, it is averaged during the transmissivity\u2019s distribution. In the fast-fading channel, however, the parties consider the worst-case value. In particular, for a uniform distribution, this means to pick the minimum value Tmin in the interval and the range of it is (0,1). Therefore, the second part of Equation (8) can be still average S\u0303BE while the first part needs to choose lower transmissivity Tmin, that is I Tmin AB . Then, Equation (8) can be rewritten as\nK f ast = \u03b2I Tmin AB \u2212 S\u0303BE. (9)\nHere, S\u0303BE is determined by average Holevo bound \u03c7BE,\nS\u0303BE = \u222b PT\u03c7BEdT. (10)\nFor the conventional detector model, \u03c7BE and IAB can be derived from the covariance matrix \u03b3A1 A2B1B2 which describes the mode Alice sent through the fast-fading channel, and the mode Bob received after the measurements. Here, IAB is given by the variance of Bob VB2 = \u03b7T(V + \u03c7tot) and the conditional variance VB2|A1 = \u03b7T(1 + \u03c7tot),\nIAB = 0.5log2(VA1 /VA1|B2) = 0.5log2((V + \u03c7tot)/(1 + \u03c7tot)) (11)\nwhere \u03c7tot can described as \u03c7tot = 1/T \u2212 1 + e + ((1\u2212 \u03b7 + VE)/\u03b7)/T.

Then, the calculation of the above two matrices is presented. First, \u03b3A1 A2 is given by\n\u03b3A1 A2 =\n( V \u00b7 I2 \u221a V2 \u2212 1 \u00b7 \u03c3z\u221a\nV2 \u2212 1 \u00b7 \u03c3z V \u00b7 I2\n) , (13)\nhere I2 = (\n1 0 0 1\n) , \u03c3z = ( 1 0 0 \u22121 ) , V represents the variance of Alice\u2019s EPR states. The\nfree-space fast-fading channel is modeled as an EPR state with a thermal noise variance VE where one mode inputs the system via a BS whose transmissivity is T. The covariance matrix \u03b3E1E2 which describes thermal noise is given by\n\u03b3E1E2 =  VE \u00b7 I2 \u221aV2E \u2212 1 \u00b7 \u03c3z\u221a V2E \u2212 1 \u00b7 \u03c3z VE \u00b7 I2 . (14) The matrix YBST which describes the operation of BS can be derived as: Y BS T =\nI2 \u2297 YT \u2297 I2.

(15)\nThen, after A2 goes through the fast-fading channal with transmissivity T, the covariance matrix \u03b3A1B1 which describes the states A1 and B1 can be obtained from \u03b3A1B1E\u20321E2\n\u03b3A1B1 = \u03b3A1B1E\u20321E2 (1 : 4, 1 : 4).

            "text": "In this part, the performances of the conventional detector and the modified detector against the uniform fast-fading channel with different channel parameters will be presented, respectively. Then, the simulations of the maximal tolerable excess noise of the two models are presented to make a more complete analysis. Besides this, we try to find the best modulation variance(VA = V \u2212 1) of Alice over the uniform fast-fading channel. It is worth mentioning that the transmissivity will become smaller and smaller in the practical system with the increase in distance, so that Tmax is considered as x coordinate variable in the simulation. As shown in Figure 4, we compare the performance of the two detector models over the fading channels. The ideal situation in Figure 4a indicates that the key rate over the fast-fading attack is slightly lower than the slow-fading attack in a small scale of attenuation. Even the detector with the ideal efficiency over a fast-fading channel demonstrates a better secret key rate than the practical detector with imperfect efficiency over a slow-fading channel. However, the high secret key rate within the modeled detector is achieved with losses of about 4 dB against a fast-fading attack, where the rate starts to rapidly decrease and will fall to a very low value when suffering the attenuation of 5 dB. In the practical situation in Figure 4b, the attenuation point that the secret key rate begins to decrease sharply will move left to 3 dB for the modeled detector. In both the ideal case and the practical case, the secret key rate decreases smoothly, not sharply, against a slow-fading channel, hinting at the different effects on both sides of the communication between the fast-fading channel and the slow-fading channel. Besides, within the simulations, the performance of the modified\nmodel is almost similar to that of the conventional model. In other words, the conventional one is slightly better than the modified one in the small attenuation.\nFigure 5 presents the influence of the fast-fading channel parameter \u2206T and the secret key rate is simulated in two different situations where \u2206T = 0.3 and \u2206T = 0.4, respectively. With the increase in \u2206T, the secret key rate is smaller and the rate in the fast-fading channel will start decreasing rapidly earlier. This is because the system will suffer more losses with the increase in \u2206T for Tmin = Tmax \u2212 \u2206T which means the effect of the fast-fading is more strong. Therefore, we can conclude that the main difference in performance over the two kinds of fading channels is that the fast-fading channel will contribute to a sharper and earlier decrease, with the increase in \u2206T (when Tmax is fixed).\nFigure 6 presents the maximal tolerable excess noise in a fast-fading channel. As can be seen, when the transmission attention is less than 2 dB, the detector with the ideal efficiency tolerates less excess noises than the practical detector while as the transmission attention increases, the detector with the ideal efficiency can resist more excess noises than others. Besides, the modified detector model can tolerate similar excess noises to the conventional one.\nFigure 7 concerns the influence of the modulation variance over a fast-fading channel. The secret key rate will first increase and then decrease with the increase in modulation variance. The results also suggest the best modulation variance for Tmax = 0.35 is lowest while the best modulation variance for Tmax = 0.45 is highest (the best modulation variance is the value which maximizes the key rate). This means the best modulation variance will increase with the increase in Tmax.\nFigure 8 presents the secret key rate at the best modulation variance versus transmission attenuation Tmax in the ideal situation (\u03b2 = 1). The best modulation variances for each transmission attenuation are different. We can compare it with Figure 4a and then conclude that the secret key rate is slightly better after using the best modulation variance. Furthermore, the attenuation point where the secret key rate begins to decrease sharply will move right to 5 dB for the modeled detector."

            "text": "This paper mainly investigates a practical CV-QKD with an imperfect detector over a uniform fast-fading channel in free-space. The research focuses on considering the imperfect characteristics of the detector in free-space CV-QKD, which leads to the need for trusted detector modeling: the conventional model and the modified model. Within the conventional detector model, a BS with transmissivity \u03b7 describes the detection efficiency and an EPR state with variance VN describes electronic noise. Within the modified detector model, two BS with transmissivities \u03b7e and \u03b7d describe the electronic noise and the detection efficiency, respectively. This model can achieve one-time calibration which means we can model the practical detector according its own situation. Then, the actions of the fast-fading channel on quantum states are analyzed briefly where Bob does not obtain the transient value of the channel parameter T, but can know its probability distribution. The secret key rate of the conventional model and the modified model over a fast-fading channel is derived for security analysis, and some simulations and results are presented. From the comparison, the secret key rate of the practical detector will drop sharply in advance against a uniform fast-fading channel. The key rate and the point where it starts to decrease rapidly might be affected by some channel parameters and detector parameters such as \u2206T, the detection efficiency and so on. Besides, we have found that the performances of two trusted models of the practical detector over the fast-fading channel are similar. More precisely, the conventional detector model is slightly better than the modified detector model in a short distance. This means that the modified model can model the practical detector according to its own situation (only calibrating detection efficiency or only calibrating electronic noise) without much reduction in performance. Such a model is helpful in simplifying the calibration of practical experiments. As we have discussed in this paper, a CV-QKD with an imperfect detector over a uniform fast-fading channel performs differently from a slow-fading channel because of the air turbulence in free-space. The imperfections will greatly affect the results of the CV-QKD against uniform fast-fading channels and these imperfections can also be considered to\nverified in practical free-space experiments. Besides, the analysis of the practical detector against uniform fast-fading channels can be applied to other QKD schemes in the future. Better performances might be obtained using other QKD schemes. Considering the practical CV-QKD with the imperfect detector over a fast-fading channel with other probability distributions could also be of interest in future works.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.Y. and Y.Z.; methodology, S.Y. and Y.Z.; software, L.F. and Y.B.; validation, L.F.; formal analysis, L.F. and Y.B.; investigation, L.F., Y.B., Y.Z. and S.Y.; resources, S.Y. and Y.Z.; data curation, L.F. and Y.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.F.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.F., Y.B., Y.Z. and S.Y.; visualization, L.F.; supervision, Y.Z.; project administration, Y.Z.; funding acquisition, Y.Z.
