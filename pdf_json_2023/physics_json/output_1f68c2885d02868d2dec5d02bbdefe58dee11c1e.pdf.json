    "abstractText": "Liver cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the development of systemic therapies, but there is still the need for new drugs and technologies that can increase the survival and quality of life of patients. The present investigation reports the development of a liposomal formulation of a carbamate molecule, reported as ANP0903, previously tested as an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease and now evaluated for its ability to induce cytotoxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. PEGylated liposomes were prepared and characterized. Small, oligolamellar vesicles were produced, as demonstrated by light scattering results and TEM images. The physical stability of the vesicles in biological fluids was demonstrated in vitro, alongside the stability during storage. An enhanced cellular uptake was verified in HepG2 cells treated with liposomal ANP0903, resulting in a greater cytotoxicity. Several biological assays were performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms explaining the proapoptotic effect of ANP0903. Our results allow us to hypothesize that the cytotoxic action in tumor cells is probably due to the inhibition of the proteasome, resulting in an increase in the amount of ubiquitinated proteins within the cells, which in turn triggers activation of autophagy and apoptosis processes, resulting in cell death. The proposed liposomal formulation represents a promising approach to deliver a novel antitumor agent to cancer cells and enhance its activity.",

Chemical structures of ANP0903 and darunavir.\nFurthermore, with the aim of improving the bioavailability and bioactivity of ANP0903, we considered that one approach to increase the pharmacological treatment efficacy could be represented by the use of nanoparticles, which were also proposed in the HCC management [9,10]. Liposomes, vesicles composed of one or more phospholipid bilayers, represent a promising carrier for drug delivery, with many liposome-based drug formulations commercially available. They are among the most commonly used carriers in the targeted treatment of cancers, with some examples proposed for the treatment of HCC [11,12]. Some of the shortcomings of liposomes, such as uptake by immune cells, can be overcome by modifying their surface with polymers, such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG), which is a flexible, non-fouling, hydrophilic polymer used to passivate nanoparticles to extend the half-life in blood circulation [13]. Furthermore, to increase the selectivity of liposomes for disease targets and control the delivery timing or dosage, several engineering strategies have been adopted. The surface of liposomes has been functionalized with specific ligands in order to allow targeted delivery and further enhance the efficacy of the incorporated drug [14]. In this study, PEG-liposomes were prepared to load and deliver ANP0903 to hepatocarcinoma cells.

In parallel to ANP0903 PEG-liposomes, empty PEG-liposomes and non-PEGylated liposomes were prepared to assess the effect of the drug and the PEGylation, respectively. The light scattering results, as reported in Table 1, showed that the empty PEG-liposomes were approximately 87 nm in diameter, monodispersed (PI 0.24), and negatively charged (ZP \u221219 mV).\nTable 1.

The effect of the PEGylation on the vesicles was evaluated by preparing non-PEGylated liposomes, both empty and loaded with ANP0903. As shown by the results reported in Table 1, the non-PEGylated liposomes, irrespective of the presence of the drug, were slightly smaller than PEG-liposomes, but not in a statistically significant manner. On the contrary, the effect of the PEGylation on the zeta potential was statistically significant. The values were less negative, which suggests that the PEG-phospholipid is arranged in a way that exposes the positively charged amine groups. The entrapment efficiency of the PEG-liposomes was high (78% \u00b1 7.8), and the amount of the loaded ANP0903 did not diminish significantly after a two-month storage period (75% \u00b1 5.7; p > 0.05). TEM observation of ANP0903 PEG-liposomes confirmed the formation of the vesicles, which were characterized by irregularly spherical shape, oligolamellarity, and small size (Figure 2), in alignment with the light scattering data.

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 80% of all cases, making it the most relevant to focus on [23]. The commonly established methods for the diagnosis of HCC are imaging techniques (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) and the quantification of circulating overexpressed biomarkers, such as alphafetoprotein (AFP) [2]. Multiple approaches are currently available for the treatment of HCC, depending on the tumor stage and underlying conditions [4]. Surgical resection and transplant are the first-line treatments. The second-line options include locoregional treatments (ablation, embolization, and radiation) and systemic drug therapies. The latter include immunotherapy, which involves the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors; chemotherapy, which involves the use of traditional drugs, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil, that are often more effective in destroying cancer cells if combined; and targeted therapy, which involves the use of kinase inhibitors that block tyrosine kinases and thus stop the growth of the cancer, or monoclonal antibodies that target vascular endothelial growth factor, affecting a tumor\u2019s ability to form new blood vessels and thus to grow [24]. Although significant progress has been made in early diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer over the last two decades, the prognosis remains poor [2]. There are multiple reasons that can explain these insufficient outcomes, which are low drug bioavailability and non-specificity, and which can determine the high risk of side effects with low drug concentration in the target tissue. The development of new systemic drug therapies is a slow process, so there is the growing need for new effective treatment options to be developed in shorter times that can improve the survival and quality of life of patients [3]. HIV-1 protease inhibitors (HIV-PIs) are peptidomimetic drugs that contain an analogue of the phenylalanine-proline sequence targeted by the HIV-1 aspartyl protease [19]. Several lines of evidence suggest that, in addition to the antiretroviral properties, HIV-PIs exert pleiotropic pharmacological effects, including anticancer activities [5]. Apart from a direct anti-proliferative effect, HIV-PIs have also been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers by blocking angiogenesis [25], affecting the cell cycle [26], and promoting apoptosis and ER stress [19] and autophagy and proteasome inhibition [22]. Moreover, several reports have shown that HIV-PIs can be used as chemo- and radio-sensitizers [27,28]. The recognition of HIV-PIs as potential anticancer agents has intensified the effort to understand their mechanism of action and, if possible, to develop more potent and effective derivatives with wider availability and less toxicity than the anticancer drugs in use, which can improve the survival and quality of life of patients. In this scenario, nanotechnologies can contribute to expanding the armamentarium against tumors. Both inorganic and organic nanoparticles have been proposed for cancer therapy [29]. Among organic nanoparticles, liposomes are the very first nanosystem approved for the treatment of cancer, and still are the best-investigated platform in clinical trials and academic research [30\u201333]. They offer numerous advantages over therapies with free drugs: increased solubility and bioavailability of the loaded drug, controlled/constant rate of drug released over the desired timescale, protection of the loaded drug, selectivity against cancer targets, thus increased efficacy, and reduced dose of the administered drug, thus lower systemic toxicity [34\u201336]. For liposomes to be an efficient carrier system, they need to be properly formulated by tailoring their characteristics as a function of the drug and the therapeutic purpose. In this study, we developed a liposomal formulation by a simple and rapid procedure that involves the dispersion of the components in aqueous medium and the sonication to allow the formation of vesicles in the nanoscale range. Since the formulation was intended for parenteral administration, the liposomes were prepared with PEGylated phospholipids to prolong circulation time in the blood stream. PEGylated liposomes were used for loading and administering a synthetic drug, in this study called ANP0903, a carbamate molecule previously investigated (indicated as compound 10c in [8]) as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor. We wanted to ascertain the potential antitumor activity of ANP0903, due to the pleiotropic effects demonstrated by many HIV-PIs, comparing the biological\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4552 10 of 17\neffects of both the free and the nanoformulated molecule. We preliminarily tested the putative cytotoxic effects of the ANP0903 free molecule towards three pathological liver cell lines, HepG2, HuH7, and JHH6, characterized by high, medium, and low hepatocytic differentiation, respectively, compared to an immortalized non-pathological liver cell line IHH. Our results showed a lower cytotoxicity in the healthy cell line and similar cytotoxic effects in the pathological cell lines, with a slightly higher IC50 in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we chose the HepG2 cell line for the subsequent assays, considering the characterization of the dysregulated molecular mechanisms carried out on a more differentiated tumor line more effective. Liposomal ANP0903 exhibited a slightly greater efficacy (i.e., lower IC50) compared to the free molecule. With both treatments, a dose-dependent mechanism of death by apoptosis was triggered, as evidenced by the FACS analysis. However, the analysis of apoptosis markers, such as c-PARP and CHOP, justified, in subsequent assays, the use of only liposomal ANP0903, which proved to be more effective. The explanation of this greater cytotoxicity could lie in the more efficient internalization of PEG-liposomes by the cells. As of yet, the mechanism of liposome\u2013cell interaction is not fully elucidated, and more than one may occur at the same time. Endocytosis is regarded as the primary mechanism of entry, but micropinocytosis and membrane fusion can also be involved. Our results showed that the incorporation of ANP0903 into PEG-liposomes facilitated the transport of the molecule across the cell membrane and its accumulation into the cytoplasm, as demonstrated by a double amount of ANP0903 detected within the cells after the exposure to liposomal ANP0903 in comparison with free ANP0903 (Figure 6). It is known that several HIV-PIs (or their analogues) exert their cytotoxic activity through the induction of ER stress, sometimes triggered by proteasome inhibition [17,22], justifying their use as possible anticancer agents [37]. Therefore, we wanted to verify this possibility by treating the HepG2 cells with different concentrations of liposomal ANP0903 and assessing, by Western blotting, the levels of expression of some markers connected to these processes. Our results suggest that liposomal ANP0903 was able to activate the IRE1\u03b1 branch of the UPR (as confirmed by the upregulation also of sXBP1) because of a strong ER stress state, proven by the increased expression level of the representative ER-resident chaperone GRP78/BiP (Figure 7). The other two branches of the UPR (ATF6 and PERK) were not significantly activated. sXBP1 is responsible for the expression of chaperones and genes involved in the ERAD system, which is capable of providing the disposal of unfolded and misfolded proteins from the ER. The level of protein ubiquitination is considered as a surrogate marker of proteasome inhibition [38]: given the high amount of ubiquitinated proteins in the cells after treatment with liposomal ANP0903 (Figure 9), we hypothesized a direct or indirect inhibition of the proteasome that will justify further investigations to better understand its mechanism of action. Liposomal ANP0903 was found to hinder the regular disposal of the proteins coming from the ER and thus determining a proteotoxic state responsible for ER stress. Finally, several studies reported that the use of proteasome inhibitors, routinely used in clinical settings, determines an increased expression level of LC3-II, a classic marker of autophagosome formation, as a cellular attempt to reduce stress and restore normal proteostasis. We detected an increased level of LC3-II expression (Figure 8), which further suggests a possible inhibition of the proteasome as a mechanism of action of liposomal ANP0903. Overall, these results make plausible the idea that this molecule can determine an inhibition of the proteasome and that the accumulated unfolded proteins eventually result in ER stress, also triggering the autophagic process in the cells. Moreover, they point to the fact that the prepared PEG-liposomes could efficiently carry ANP0903 and potentiate its antitumor activity in hepatocarcinoma cells. This confirms previous findings concluding that lipid-based nanoparticles hold great promise in improving the treatment outcomes of antitumor agents for HCC. Indeed, liposomes were demonstrated to significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin) [39\u201341] or phytochemicals (e.g., catechin and resveratrol) [42,43], alone or in combination with microwave ablation or radiotherapy [44,45]. Nevertheless, despite\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4552 11 of 17\nthe intensive research efforts, clinically significant results have not been achieved yet, and further improvements are required. Mahmoud et al. recently highlighted that a focus should be put on the methods of preparation of the nanoparticle delivery systems in order to increase bench to bedside translation [9]. They suggested that novel, green, and ecofriendly methods that do not depend on organic solvents would improve the scalability of production and decrease production costs, while eliminating the risk of the presence of toxic residuals. This perfectly aligns with the formulation approach adopted in our investigation, which was based on an easy, organic, solvent-free, and efficient procedure leading to nanosized, stable, biocompatible vesicles."
