After segmentation, measurements of the angles at the cells junction allow to have estimates of the cell surface tensions (up to a common scaling factor). Second, instead of measuring the different quantities after segmentation, one can use an adjoint method where using an iterative scheme, the cell doublet is segmented while imposing the physical equation verified by the cells, this method allows to get more precise estimates of the tensions. For these practical applications, exact formulae or at least as precise as possible are needed. Finally, the cell doublet can also be used as a toy model to test more general force inference algorithms by using quasi exact data coming from the cell doublet. In this framework, it is important to be able to compute the solution(s) to the cell doublet very precisely, these data can then be pertubated with artificial noise in order to estimate which level of error makes the general force inference algorithms fail. Changing the parameters of the toy model can also allow to exhibit problematic configurations for the force inference algorithm. For a cell doublet with surface tensions only, it is well-known that simple considerations of geometry give the angles between forces [2, 4, 7, 10, 14]. Thus, no hard work is required to test some force inference algorithms on exact data. Things are diferent if one is now also interested in the height of the cells junction for instance, since it depends on the tensions and the model constraints (e.g. volume contraints); the same holds for the cell centre positions. Hence, it is quite interesting to get an anlytical formula for these other configuration parameters. The first part of this work is dedicated to this problem. Although almost the different results for a cell doublet with surface tensions are known, we choose to present them in this document. It allows us to introduce the polynomial way to formulate the problem, which appears particularly useful in the third part of this work when a line tension is introduced. Thus, for a better understanding, we prove the different results by starting from scratch. More precisely,",

More precisely,\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n03 09\n8v 2\n[ m\nat h.\nN A\n] 1\n6 Se\np 20\n22\nconsidering a cell doublet defined by its geometrical parameters, we derive the Young-Laplace and Young-Dupre\u0301 laws by minimizing its surface energy under volume constraints, the angles between forces are then uniquely defined. The other geometrical parameters of the configuration (height of the cell junction and position of the centres) can then be found using the volume equations. Finally, obtaining precisely the parameters of the cell doublet configuration is not such a hard task since it only sums up to solve a small optimization problems with four parameters and two volume constraints which can be done very efficently and very precisely in a numerical way. Moreover, since the energy of the constrained system has a unique minimum, optimization algorithms converge to it even the initial guess is slightly changed. As previously mentioned though, anaytical formulae can be convenient to get extremely precise data, specially close the limit cases where optimization algorithms may be slow to converge.\nIn a second part, we show how to compute the geometrical parameters of a cell doublet with surface tensions when the pressures instead of the volumes are known. This case does not present any difficulty since the Young-Laplace and Young-Dupre\u0301 laws immmediately give simple relations between the geometrical parameters and the tensions and pressures.\nIn the third part of this document, we consider a cell doublet with surface tensions and a line tension. At first sight, it is not obvious if the system has only one or several energy minima. Hence, if there are several, an optimization algorithm would end at only one of them and the computed minimum would highly depends on the initial guess. Moreover, if no information on the number of local minima is known, it makes difficult the task to find the global minimum. Somewhat in between the case of a unique minimum and the case of several minima, we study in a quantitative way, a cell doublet with line tension and volume constraints, which has the property to have three obvious local minima (when the cell junction disappears) and apparently a unique other local minimum (if the tensions allow it) which is a critical point of the energy."

The cell surfaces are modelized as three spherical caps S1, S2, S3 with respective centers C1, C2, C3, where S3 defines the interface 3 and where the surface of cell k = 1, 2 is given by Sk \u222aS3. We consider the oriented (Ox) axis whose origin O is the center of the base circle of S3 and whose direction is given by the vector ex = (C2\u2212C1)/|C2\u2212C1|. We denote by C0 (respectively D0), the unit circle (respectively unit disk) of center O orthogonal to ex.\nFor x \u2208 R\u2217 and h \u2208 R, we denote by Sx,h the spherical cap with base circle hC0 and apex xex. S0,h is defined as the disk hD0. The surfaces 1, 2, 3 are\nthen given by Sx1,h, Sx2,h, Sx3,h for x1, x2, x3, h \u2208 R with x1 < x3 < x2.\nRemark 2.1. For h \u2208 R, \u00b1h define the same spherical caps, hence the same configuration of the cell doublet, but it is more convenient to keep it this way than restraining h \u2208 R+.\nOne might want to introduce the radii of the spherical caps as well as their aperture in order to express in a more common way the force balance. Hence, we define for k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\nzk = xk |h| , \u03b1k = 2 arctan zk , rk = |h| sin\u03b1k (signed radius). (1)\nFor sake of simplicity, the cosines and sines are abbreviated for k \u2208 {1, 2, 3} as\nck = cos\u03b1k , sk = sin\u03b1k.

            "text": "Since the problem of finding the critical points of the energy is purely algebraic (all the equations are given by polynomials), although not mandatory, it is interesting to describe it in an algebraic way. You can refer to [5, 12, 15, 16], but\nas a quick reminder, and rougly speaking, an affine variety is an implicit manifold whose defining equations are polynomials. It can happen that the affine variety has singularities (it is not a manifold at these points), the dimension of an affine variety is however defined as its maximal dimension at regular points when viewed as a manifold. To end this very short, incomplete and non exhaustive presentation, an ideal is a set of polynomials which is a group for the sum and such that the multiplication of a polynomial in the ideal by any other polynomial (not necessary in the ideal) is sill in the ideal. Hence, zeros of a polynomial system can also be characterized as the zeros of the ideal generated by the polynomials of the system (smallest ideal containing the polynomials).\nWe consider the problem of finding the minimizer of the energy E (or equivalently E/\u03c0) under volume constraints V1(x1, x2, x3, h) = v1 and V2(x1, x2, x3, h) = v2, where v1, v2 \u2208 R\u2217+, that is, we want to find the minimizer of the polynomial E(X1, X2, X3, Y ) on the affine variety M of dimension 2 of R4 defined by the ideal IM = \u3008Q1, Q2\u3009 where Q1, Q2 \u2208 R[X1, X2, X3, Y ] are given by\nQ1 = \u2212X1(3Y 2 +X21 ) +X3(3Y 2 +X23 )\u2212 w1, (17) Q2 = X2(3Y 2 +X22 )\u2212X3(3Y 2 +X23 )\u2212 w2, (18)\nWhere for k \u2208 {1, 2}, wk = 6vk/\u03c0. We also denote v3 = v1+v2 and w3 = 6v3/\u03c0. Note that x1 < x2 < x3 is implicitely imposed by the volume constraints.\nRemark 3.1. An homothety of the surface tensions does not change the configuration of the system at minimum energy. Similarly, an homothety of factor \u03bb3 of the volumes v1, v2 simply scales the spatial coordinates of the system at minimum energy by a factor \u03bb, thus, the angles \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 remain unchanged.\nRemark 3.2. It is an easy task to solve numerically the problem and find the configuration of the double cell. However, we would like to have explicit formulae that could be used directly. Since the problem has been written in terms of a minimization of a polynomial on an affine variety, the solution will hence be given as the solution to polynomial system. Using a Gro\u0308bner basis [15] (computed for instance with a Computer Algebra System like Singular [8]), the solution is then simply given by taking the successive roots of polynomials whose coefficients depend on the previous parameters given by the previous polynomials. However, note that although semi-explicit, this way of solving the system is not the most appropriate for numerical applications since Gro\u0308bner basis often give large polynomial coefficients which can dramatically destroy the precision. Nonetheless, in our simple case of a double cell, we can easily find an univariate polynomial whose only real root is one of the parameter z1, z2, z3. The other z parameters are then given by Mo\u0308bius transformations depending on the surface tensions t1, t2, t3 and h can be computed using the volumes and the z parameters.\nRemark 3.3. For q \u2208 R, the polynomial X(X2 + 3)\u2212 2q has a unique real root\nz given by\nz = 3 \u221a q + \u221a 1 + q2 \u2212 1\n3 \u221a q + \u221a 1 + q2 = 3\n\u221a q + \u221a 1 + q2 + 3 \u221a q \u2212 \u221a 1 + q2, (19)\nWhich can also be written z = Z(q), (20)\nWhere\nZ(q) = 2 sinh ( 1\n3 arcsinh(q)\n) . (21)\nHence,M can be easily paramaterized using h and one of the other three variabes x1, x2, x3, indeed, M is any of the set of points x respectively defined by\nx = ( x1, hZ ( x1(3h\n2 + x21) + w3 2h3\n) , hZ ( x1(3h\n2 + x21) + w1 2h3\n) , h ) , (22a)\nx = ( hZ ( x2(3h\n2 + x22)\u2212 w3 2h3\n) , x2, hZ ( x2(3h\n2 + x22)\u2212 w2 2h3\n) , h ) , (22b)\nx = ( hZ ( x3(3h\n2 + x23)\u2212 w1 2h3\n) , hZ ( x3(3h\n2 + x23) + w2 2h3\n) , x3, h ) . (22c)\nThe limit is well-defined as h\u2192 0, giving in fact parameterizations of the closed subvariety M0 of M of points with h = 0 (algebraic curve of the hyperplane R3 \u00d7 {0}), that is, the points (x1, x2, x3, 0) \u2208 R4 such that\n\u2212x31 + x33 = w1, x32 \u2212 x33 = w2.\nThe respective parameterizations are given by M0 = {( x1, 3 \u221a x31 + w3, 3 \u221a x31 + w1, 0 ) : x1 \u2208 R } , (23)\nM0 = {( 3 \u221a x32 \u2212 w3, x2, 3 \u221a x32 \u2212 w2, 0 ) : x2 \u2208 R } , (24)\nM0 = {( 3 \u221a x33 \u2212 w1, 3 \u221a x33 + w2, x3, 0 ) : x3 \u2208 R } , (25)\nRemark that E is a positive definite quadratic form of R4 and M is closed, hence the minimum E on M is reached at some point. Moreover, it can be easily checked that the singular locus Msing of M is empty, thus the minimum of E on M is a critical point. The singular locus of M is the set points of M which are singular, that is points such that M is not a differentiable manifold at these locations, the tangent plane has not dimension 2 anymore, that is, if\nwe denote by Q = ( Q1 Q2 ) and by JQ the Jacobian of Q (basis of the orthogonal to the tangent plane), these points vanish the 2\u00d7 2 minors of JQ and of course\nthe polymomials of IM since the points have to be on the variety. The ideal IMsing generated by these polynomials can then be written\nIMsing = IM + \u30082\u00d7 2 minors of JQ\u3009, (26)\nThat is IMsing = IM + \u2329 Y (X2 \u2212X3)(Y 2 +X21 ), Y (X3 \u2212X1)(Y 2 +X22 )\n(X1 \u2212X2)(Y 2 +X23 ), (Y 2 +X21 )(Y 2 +X22 ), (Y 2 +X22 )(Y 2 +X23 ), (Y 2 +X23 )(Y 2 +X21 ) \u232a .\n(27)\nWe can see that the zeros of \u30082\u00d72 minors of JQ\u3009 are quadruples (x1, x2, x3, h) \u2208 C4 such that xk = x` = \u00b1ih for a couple (k, `) \u2208 {1, 2, 3}2, k 6= `, hence Msing = \u2205.\nWe now want to find the critical points of the constrained energy. These points are characterized as those such that the gradient of the energy is orthogonal to tangent plane toM, that is, the gradient of the energy lies in the space generated by \u2207Q1,\u2207Q2. This is exactly what is done when working with the Lagrangian L = E\u2212P1Q1\u2212P2Q2. Deriving it, we search for the points and the coefficients P1, P2 (pressures) such that \u2207E can be written as a combination of the vectors in the orthogonal of the tangent place, that is \u2207E = P1\u2207Q1 + P2\u2207Q2.\nWe can also proceed by searching for the points of M vanishing the 3 \u00d7 3\nminors of the gradient JEQ of EQ = ( E Q ) , the critical ideal IcritE,Q of the volume constrained energy (polynomials whose zeros are the critical points of the constrained energy) is then given by\nIcritE,Q = IM + \u30083\u00d7 3 minors of JEQ\u3009 (28)\nThat is IcritE,Q =IM + \u2329 t1X1(Y 2 +X22 )(Y 2 +X23 ) + t2X2(Y 2 +X23 )(Y 2 +X21 )+\nt3X3(Y 2 +X21 )(Y 2 +X22 ), 2t1X1Y (X1 \u2212X3)(Y 2 +X22 )+ 2t2X2Y (X2 \u2212X3)(Y 2 +X21 )\u2212 tsY (Y 2 +X22 )(Y 2 +X23 ), 2t2X2Y (X2 \u2212X1)(Y 2 +X23 ) + 2t3X3Y (X3 \u2212X1)(Y 2 +X22 )\u2212 tsY (Y 2 +X23 )(Y 2 +X21 ), 2t3X3Y (X3 \u2212X2)(Y 2 +X21 )+\n2t1X1Y (X1 \u2212X2)(Y 2 +X23 )\u2212 tsY (Y 2 +X21 )(Y 2 +X22 ) \u232a .\n(29)\nHence, the algebraic degree of the problem is 75 (number of zeros of the critical ideal in C4), however, most of critical points are without interest for our considerations since they are either complex or do not correspond to a minimum of the constrained energy but to a maximum or a saddle point. But we can already see that for h 6= 0, any critical point of the constrained energy has to\nverify the volume constraints Q1, Q2 and\nt1 h2 \u2212 x21 h2 + x21 + t2 h2 \u2212 x22 h2 + x22 + t3 h2 \u2212 x23 h2 + x23 = 0, (30) t1 x1\nh2 + x21 + t2 x2 h2 + x22 + t3 x3 h2 + x23 = 0, (31)\nThat is\nt1c1 + t2c2 + t3c3 = 0, (32)\nt1s1 + t2s2 + t3s3 = 0, (33)\nWhich is the force balance on the junction circle (Young-Dupre\u0301 law) [2,4,7,10, 14]. It shows in particular that x1, x2, x3 can not have the same sign (no nonphysical moon-shape configuration for the system). Geometrically speaking, since the sum of tension forces is 0, they form a triangle whose lengths are (t1, t2, t3). This implies that (\u03d51, \u03d52, \u03d53) is uniquely determined up to a minus sign. In addition, since we have x1 < x3 < x2 because of volume constraints (cell 1 on the left and cell 2 on the right), we then have x1 < 0 and x2 > 0 which determines the sign of (\u03d51, \u03d52, \u03d53). Moreover, as we will detail later, the tensions have to fulfill the triangle inequalities.\nStill considering a possible critical point with h 6= 0, the triangle formed by the tension forces has angles \u03c0 \u2212 \u03d5k, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3} and the law of cosines (dot\nproduct of each couple of forces) gives for k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\ncos\u03d5k = \u2212 t2k+1 + t 2 k\u22121 \u2212 t2k\n2tk+1tk\u22121 , (34)\n= 1\u2212 (tk+1 + tk\u22121 + tk)(tk+1 + tk\u22121 \u2212 tk) 2tk+1tk\u22121 , = \u22121 + (tk + tk+1 \u2212 tk\u22121)(tk + tk\u22121 \u2212 tk+1) 2tk+1tk\u22121 ,\ncos (\u03d5k\n2\n) = \u221a (tk + tk+1 \u2212 tk\u22121)(tk + tk\u22121 \u2212 tk+1)\n4tk+1tk\u22121 .

(38)\nRemark 3.4. For t1 = t2 = t3, we have \u03d51 = \u03d52 = \u03d53 = 2\u03c0\n3 , so that we\nrecover the well-known property asserting that the tension forces at the junction circle form 120\u25e6 angles.\nRemark 3.5. For h = 0, the condition of criticality is given by\nx1x2x3(t1x2x3 + t2x3x1 + t3x1x2),\nThat is\nx1 = 0 or x2 = 0 or x3 = 0 or t1 x1 + t2 x2 + t3 x3 = 0.\nAs intuitively expected, we will see that only one of the first three conditions correspond to a configuration of minimum energy, namely exclusion or inclusion which happens when one of the surface tension is greater than the sum of the two others."

            "text": "Consider a critical point (x1, x2, x3, h) of the constrained energy and assume that h 6= 0. Then the force balance at the cells junction (41a,41b) implies that the three tension forces form a triangle whose lengths are t1, t2, t3, which can only occur if these lengths fulfill the triangle inequalities tk \u2264 tk+1 + tk\u22121 for all k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. In fact, the inequalities are strict, indeed, if tk = tk+1 + tk\u22121 for a k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, then the force balance implies xk\u22121 = xk+1 which is forbidden by the volume constraints.\nHence, if for a given k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, the tension tk satisfies tk \u2265 tk+1 + tk\u22121,\nthen the constrained energy has no critical point in M \\M0 and the global minimum, as well as any local minimum, is reached on M0. In fact, we can intuitively guess that the tension k pulls until surface k completely disappears, which leads to internalization of cell 1 in cell 2 if k = 1, to internalization of cell 2 in cell 1 if k = 2 and to externalization if k = 3. Mathematically speaking, we will prove that the constrained energy has no other minimizer than the externalized/internalized configuration corresponding to the triangle inequality which is violated (mutually exclusive cases). We will also prove that these configurations are not local minimizers of the constrained energy on M when the triangle inequalities are fulfilled.\nRemark 3.6. The three triangle inequalities tk < tk+1+tk\u22121 for all k \u2208 {1, 2, 3} can be written more concisely as\n2 max(t1, t2, t3) < ts,\nWhere we recall that ts = t1 + t2 + t3. It can also be written in the following way, for a chosen k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\n|tk+1 \u2212 tk\u22121| < tk < tk+1 + tk\u22121,\nIn this case, the similar inequalities fulfilled by the other ` \u2208 {1, 2, 3} \\ {k} are a consequence of the previous one.\nKeep on considering general t1, t2, t3. First, on M0, the only minimizers of the energy are the points given by x1 = 0 or x2 = 0 or x3 = 0, that is, the points u1, u2, u3 defined by\nu1 = (0, 3 \u221a w3, 3 \u221a w1, 0) , (42a) u2 = (\u2212 3 \u221a w3, 0,\u2212 3 \u221a w2, 0) , (42b) u3 = (\u2212 3 \u221a w1, 3 \u221a w2, 0, 0) . (42c)\nIndeed, on M0, considering for instance the parameterization in x3 given in (23), we have E = \u03c0\u03c8(x33) with \u03c8 : R\u2192 R+ defined for x \u2208 R by\n\u03c8(x) = t1 3 \u221a (x\u2212 w1)2 + t2 3 \u221a (x+ w2)2 + t3 3 \u221a x2. (43)\nFor x \u2208 R \\ {\u2212w2, 0, w1}, we have \u03c8\u2032\u2032(x) < 0 (\u03c8 is concave on each interval) and for y \u2208 {\u2212w2, 0, w1}, limx\u2192y\u00b1 \u03c8\u2032(x) = \u2213\u221e. Hence, onM0, the energy has local minima only at the points u1, u2, u3. Since lim\nx\u2192\u00b1\u221e \u03c8(x) = +\u221e, at least one\nof these points is a global minimizer of the energy on M0, hence also on M if 2 max(t1, t2, t3) \u2265 ts.\nSecond, using the Hessian of the constrained energy, one can see which points are possible minimizers. Using the parameterizations of E given in (22a), we\nhave\n\u2207(x1,h)2E(0, 0) = 2\u03c0 ( t1 0 0 t1 \u2212 t2 \u2212 t3 ) ,\n\u2207(x2,h)2E(0, 0) = 2\u03c0 ( t2 0 0 t2 \u2212 t3 \u2212 t1 ) ,\n\u2207(x2,h)2E(0, 0) = 2\u03c0 ( t3 0 0 t3 \u2212 t1 \u2212 t2 ) .\nHence, for k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, uk can be a local minimizer onM only if tk \u2265 tk+1+tk\u22121 and is for sure one if inequality is strict. Thus, if 2 max(t1, t2, t3) < ts, none of the points u1, u2, u3 can be a local minimizer of the energy onM, hence neither a global one. Moreover, for 2 max(t1, t2, t3) \u2265 ts, since the energy has its global minimizer among u1, u2, u3 and since the conditions on the tensions t1, t2, t3 are mutually exclusive, it has only one local minimizer on M which is also the global one.\nRemark 3.7. The latter holds if for k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, tk = tk+1+tk\u22121. In this case, the Hessian matrix at uk is positive but not definite, however, since the Hessian matrices at uk\u22121 and uk+1 are not positive and since the global minimizer of the energy is among u1, u2, u3, it is necessarily uk.\nTo summarize, we have\n\u2022 If 2 max(t1, t2, t3) < ts, the energy on M has no local minimizer located on M0.\n\u2022 If t1 \u2265 t2 + t3, then E reaches its global minimum at u1 (which is also the unique minimizer), corresponding to the configuration of cell 1 internalized in cell 2. We then have x1 = 0,\nx2 = 3 \u221a 6v3 \u03c0 , x3 = 3 \u221a 6v1 \u03c0 .\n\u2022 If t2 \u2265 t1 + t3, then E reaches its global minimum at u2 (which is also the unique minimizer), corresponding to the configuration of cell 2 internalized in cell 1. We then have\nx1 = \u2212 3 \u221a\n6v3 \u03c0\n, x2 = 0, x3 = \u2212 3 \u221a\n6v2 \u03c0 .\n\u2022 If t3 \u2265 t1 + t2, then E reaches its global minimum at u3 (which is also the unique minimizer), corresponding to the configuration of separated cells\n1 and 2. We then have x1 = \u2212 3 \u221a\n6v1 \u03c0 ,\nx2 = 3 \u221a 6v2 \u03c0 , x3 = 0.\nRemark 3.8. For all k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, if the point xk = 0 is not the global minimizer of the constrained energy, then it is a saddle point. The energy has two other critical points for h = 0 that we did not take into account since they are not minimizers. As it can be seen with the function \u03c8 defined in (43), one of these critical point is such that x3 \u2208 (\u2212 3 \u221a w2, 0) and the other one is such that x3 \u2208 (0, 3 \u221a w1). In can be easily checked that these points are local maxima of the energy."

Indeed, the only possible roots having multiplicity larger than 1 are {\u22121, 0}. Since y+ + y\u2212 > 0, z 7\u2192\ny+ \u2212 z y\u2212 + z is a proper Mo\u0308bius transform (not constant) and the\nunique respective preimages of \u22121 and 0 are \u221e and y+ which are not roots of U(z)/T (z) = \u2212g\u2212/g+.\nWe can summarize the different cases which can appear in a double cell with constrained volumes by the fact that there always exists a unique local minimum of the energy, which is then the global minimum of the system. When the tensions fulfill the triangle inequality, the configuration of the system can be found by solving a degree 5 equation which has a unique real root. For the cases where the tensions do not fulfill the triange inequality, one of the surfaces disappear depending on which tension is larger than the sum of the two others. These results can be visualized on the following graph.\nRemark 3.11. We cannot expect a closed fomula in terms of radicals giving the roots of F defined in (45) (in particular the real one). Indeed, it is well-known that there is no solution in radicals to general polynomial equations of degree 5 [6]. To check that F is not a special polynomial which can be solved by radicals, consider d, y\u2212, y+ as indeterminates and F as an element of Q(d, y\u2212, y+)[X]. T and U are coprime in C[d, y\u2212, y+, X], hence also T\u2212U and T+U are. Moreover, F = (T \u2212U)d/2 + (T +U)/2 hence F is irreducible in C[d, y\u2212, y+, X]. Since F is monic in X, from Gauss lemma, F is irreducible in C(d, y\u2212, y+)[X], hence in\nQ(d, y\u2212, y+)[X]. Thus the Galois G group of F is a transitive subgroup of S5. G can be computed with a computer algebra system and we have exactly G = S5 so that F is not solvable by radicals. Hence, from Hilbert irreducibility theorem, polynomials obtained by specializing d, y\u2212, y+ in Q for F are \u201calmost always\u201d irreducible. In fact, a consequence of this theorem is that the Galois group of the specialized polynomial is \u201calmost always\u201d isomorphic to the Galois group of F over Q(d, y\u2212, y+) which is S5 so that the specialization is not solvable by radicals. Consider the simple case where t1 = t2 = t3, in this case we specialize the polynomial F in y\u2212, y+ = 1/ \u221a 3 /\u2208 Q. Then denote F\u0303 = 9 \u221a 3F (X/ \u221a 3), that is\nF\u0303 = X5 + 10dX2 + 15X + 6d = 2(5X2 + 3)d+X(X4 + 15).\nReasoning as previously shows that F\u0303 is irreducible in Q(d)[X] and that its Galois group is S5 as well, so that the polynomials obtained by specializing d in Q for F\u0303 are \u201calmost always\u201d irreducible and that the Galois group of the specialized polynomial is \u201calmost always\u201d isomorphic to the Galois group of F\u0303 over Q(d) which is S5, so that the specialization is not solvable by radicals. In fact, in this particular case, all specializations d such that F\u0303 (d,X) is irreducible in Q[X] produce S5 as Galois group. Moreover, the values of d \u2208 Q for which F\u0303 (d,X) is reducible can be explicitely determined, they are the values of d \u2208 Q for which F\u0303 (d,X) has a rational root. Indeed, if for d \u2208 Q, F\u0303 (d,X) factorizes as polynomials of respective degree 1 and 4, F\u0303 (d,X) has obviously a rational root. Now , if for d \u2208 Q, F\u0303 (d,X) factorizes as polynomials of respective degree 2 and 3 in Q[X], one can check that we have necessarily d = \u00b11 (it corresponds to w\u2212 = 0 or w+ = 0) and\nF\u0303 = (X \u00b1 1)3(X2 \u2213 3X + 6).\nIn particular, F\u0303 (\u00b11, X) has a rational root.\nThe values of d \u2208 Q such that F\u0303 (d,X) has a root in Q can be easily expressed since F (d,X) is linear in d, they are\nd = m(m4 + 15n4)\n2n3(5m2 + 3n2) , m, n \u2208 Z,\nAnd in this case F\u0303 = ( X + m\nn\n)( X4 \u2212 m\nn X3 +\nm2\nn2 X2 \u2212 3m(m 2 \u2212 25n2) n(5m2 + 3n2) X + 3m(m4 + 15n4) n2(5m2 + 3n2)\n) .\nIt is in fact possible to get closed formulae for the roots of a general polynomial of degree 5, one has however to use a Tschirnhaus transformation [17] to write the quintic in its principal form or in its Bring-Jerrard form [3, 9]. In the first case, one has to solve the associated icosahedral equation [11,13] whose roots can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions [1]. In the second case, the roots can be written in terms of Jacobi theta functions or hypergeometric functions [1]. However, although theoretically interesting, these formulae are quite\ncumbersome and are often not the most appropriate way to solve the problem for numerical applications."

Before tackling the local extrema of the energy such that h 6= 0, consider first the case of points such that h = 0 (points inM0). Points which are local minima of the energy on M0 are of course the same as in the problem 3.3 without line tension and they are those corresponding to internalization or externalization. In the presence of line tension, the three points are local minima of the energy, indeed, using the parameterizations of E given in (22a), we have\nE(x1, h) = x1,h\u21920\n\u03c0 ( t3w 2/3 1 + t2w 2/3 3 + t1x 2 1 + 2\u03bah ) + o(t1x 2 1 + 2\u03bah), (79)\nE(x2, h) = x2,h\u21920\n\u03c0 ( t3w 2/3 2 + t1w 2/3 3 + t2x 2 2 + 2\u03bah ) + o(t2x 2 2 + 2\u03bah), (80)\nE(x3, h) = x3,h\u21920\n\u03c0 ( t1w 2/3 1 + t2w 2/3 2 + t3x 2 3 + 2\u03bah ) + o(t3x 2 3 + 2\u03bah).

As previously explained, we want to be sure to find the global minimum of the energy and the local minima as well, so the system can not be solved with Newton method.

To this end, we use the Hessian of the Lagrangian L with respect to (x1, x2, x3, h). Indeed, consider a critical point (x1, x2, x3, h), its associated Lagrange multipliers P1, P2 and H the Hessian of L with respect to the geometry taken at (x1, x2, x3, h, P1, P2).

Similarly, if the Hessian is positive but not definite on the tangent space T , more analysis is required to know if (x1, x2, x3, h) is a local minimum or a saddle point.\nComparing the energy at the local minima and at the points h = 0, xk = 0, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, one can find the global minimum of the constrained energy. To test the extremality of the critical points, we need the tangent space T and the Hessian matrix H. We recall that\n\u2207V1 = \u03c0\n2\n 0\nh2 + x22 \u2212(h2 + x23) 2h(x2 \u2212 x3)\n , \u2207V2 = \u03c02  \u2212(h2 + x21) 0 h2 + x23\n2h(x3 \u2212 x1)  . (90) Hence the following vectors form a basis of T .\nU =  1 + c1 1 + c2 1 + c3\n0\n , W =  \u2212s1 \u2212s2 \u2212s3\n1  . (91) The Hessian matrix H is simply given by\nH = 2\u03c0  t1c1 0 0 \u2212t1s1 0 t2c2 0 \u2212t2s2 0 0 t3c3 \u2212t3s3\n\u2212t1s1 \u2212t2s2 \u2212t3s3 t1c1 + t2c2 + t3c3  . (92) Hence, the Hessian matrix HT in the basis (U,W ) writes\nHT = 2\u03c0 [ MH \u2212 \u03bay ( 1 0 0 1 )] , (93)\nWhere\nMH =  3\u2211 k=1 tkc 2 k(2 + ck) 3\u2211 k=1 tkcksk(2 + ck)\n3\u2211 k=1 tkcksk(2 + ck) 3\u2211 k=1 tks 2 k(2 + ck)\n . (94)\nThus, the 2\u00d72 matrix HT is positive if and only if its trace and its determinant are positive. The trace Tr(HT ) of HT is given by\nTr(HT ) = 2\u03c0(2ts \u2212 3\u03bay), (95)\nAnd its determinant det(HT ) by\ndet(HT ) = 4\u03c0 2(det(MH)\u2212 2\u03bay(ts \u2212 \u03bay)), (96)\nWhere the determinant det(MH) of MH is given by\ndet(MH) = ( 3\u2211 k=1 tkc 2 k(2 + ck) )( 3\u2211 k=1 tks 2 k(2 + ck) ) \u2212 ( 3\u2211 k=1 tkcksk(2 + ck) )2 .\n(97) We recall that the three local minima u1, u2, u3 of E for h = 0 are given by (42a), (42b), (42c)\nu1 = (0, 3 \u221a w3, 3 \u221a w1, 0) , (98) u2 = (\u2212 3 \u221a w3, 0,\u2212 3 \u221a w2, 0) , (99) u3 = (\u2212 3 \u221a w1, 3 \u221a w2, 0, 0) , (100)\nThe energy at these points is\nE(u1) = \u03c0 ( t2 3 \u221a w23 + t3 3 \u221a w21 ) , (101)\nE(u2) = \u03c0 ( t1 3 \u221a w23 + t3 3 \u221a w22 ) , (102)\nE(u3) = \u03c0 ( t1 3 \u221a w22 + t2 3 \u221a w22 ) .

Consequently, since when exists, the interior minimum is unique, a minimization algorithm could fit to search for the latter. However, there could be some difficulties to avoid the algorithm to converge to one of the three minima on the boundary of the domain (h = 0). This could probably be avoided by an appropriate choice of the initial guess. One can also remark that even when the energy has an interior minimum, this one is not mandatorily the global minimum of the system.

For sake of simplicity, considering the reduced system (89), one can choose one of the parameters as being a new unknown (for instance w) and add the equation of vanishing Jacobian determinant to the system. Solving this new system for chosen tensions \u03c41, \u03c42, \u03c43 gives the singular points (z1, z2, z3, \u03c1) for these parameters as well as the corresponding volumes w. However, not all singularities are of interest in our problem since they might occur for parameters which are not located at the boundary of the region where local minima are possible. Moreover, once computed, it is not convenient to check if a singularity is of interest or not.\nHence, for our numerical study, we proceed differently. Consider some parameters as fixed, for instance, like in the following, t3, \u03ba, w1, w2. Then, each couple of angles (\u03b11, \u03b12) \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, 0)\u00d7 (0, \u03c0) (that is (z1, z2) \u2208 R\u2217\u2212\u00d7R\u2217+) uniquely determines t1, t2, z3, y such that the system (86) is fulfilled and the computation of\nthese parameters is straightforward, indeed\ny = 3\n\u221a z2(z22 + 3)\u2212 z1(z21 + 3)\nw1 + w2 , (112)\nz3 = 2 sinh\n( 1\n3 arcsinh\n( w2z1(z 2 1 + 3) + w1(z 2 2 + 3)\n2(w1 + w2)\n)) , (113)\nt1 = t3 sin\u03d51 + \u03bays2\nsin\u03d53 , (114)\nt2 = t3 sin\u03d52 \u2212 \u03bays1\nsin\u03d53 . (115)\nWe have of course y > 0 and z1 < z3 < z2. Then, if t1 > 0 and t2 > 0 and if the configuration is a local minimum, the couple (t1, t2) can be recorded as being in the domain of existence of local minima for the energy. Processing a lot of couples of angles allow to have a fairly precise knowledge of the set of couples (t1, t2) such that the energy has a local minimum.\nAs a first example, we consider a surface tension t3 = 1 and for different line tensions \u03ba, we observe which surface tensions t1, t2 give rise to an interior minimum.\nFron sections 3.4 and 3.4.1, we already knew that for a doublet with only surface tensions, the domain of existence of a configuration does not depend on the volumes but only on the tensions (they have to fulfill the triangle inequalities). As expected, we can see that this is not true anymore for a doublet with line tension. Increasing the line tension also shrinks this domain. First unbounded, the domain becomes bounded when the line tension increases too much and then disappears when it is too high. When the cell volumes are not equal, we can\nalso see that increasing the line tension slightly rotates the domain of existence of a configuration. We can observe these behaviours more into details and look at the value of the energy at the local minima. We still consider t3 = 1 and we first consider equal volumes. For different values of the line tension \u03ba, we again observe which surface tensions t1, t2 give rise to an interior minimum. For these local minima, we compare their energy to those of the three minima on the boundary. We denote by E0k, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3} the energy at xk = 0.\nBoth on the domain of existence of a local minimum, the figure on the right shows the order of E01 , E 0 2 , E 0 3 and the figure on the left compares the energy at the local minima to E01 , E 0 2 , E 0 3 . For comparison with a doublet without line tension, the black solid line represents the location of tensions where the triangle inequalities are violated. As a reminder, this is the same plot as in figure\n6. Inside the domain {(t1, t2) \u2208 ( R\u2217+ )2\n; |t1 \u2212 t2| < t3 < t1 + t2}, a cell doublet without line tension has a unique configuration of minimum energy with junction height different than 0. Otherwise we either have internalization or externalization.\nHence, in this case, we can see that most of local minima are also global ones. However, things might be different, increasing the line tension \u03ba makes the grey area become bounded and then decrease its size.\nIt finally disappears so that in these cases, despite the existence of a local minimum such that x1, x2, x3 6= 0, the global minimum of the energy is always one of E01 , E 0 2 , E 0 3 .\nOn the previous figures, the domain of tensions (t1, t2) where a local minimum exists is in fact unbounded so that t1, t2 can be chosen arbitrarily large if they do not differ too much. The same holds true for a cell doublet without line tension. However, in the presence of line tension, the domain becomes bounded if \u03ba increases too much. Precisely, in the case we are considering now (w1 = w2), it happens when\n\u03ba 3 \u221a w1 + w2 > 3t3 2\n(116)\nIf \u03ba increases more, then the energy of any local minimum is higher than the three energies for h = 0.\nAs \u03ba increases, the set of couples (t1, t2) such that the energy of a cell doublet has a local minimum is getting smaller and there is no more local minimum when \u03ba is too large, more precisely when\n\u03ba 3 \u221a w1 + w2 > t3 4 6 \u221a 14\n( 43 + 5 \u221a 65 ) 6 \u221a 25 \u221a 65\u2212 201, (117)\nWhere we still consider the case w1 = w2. The common value t of t1, t2 at the singularity (when equality holds in (117)) is given by\nt = 5t3 8\n( 25 + 3 \u221a 65 ) . (118)\nIn all previous cases, the existence of a local minimum is implying that the surface tensions fulfill the triangle inequalities. However, there is a priori no reason for this fact to be true in general since we now have four forces (~t1,~t2,~t3, ~\u03ba). Precisely, as already mentioned and seen on figure 4.2.3, contrary to the case of a doublet without line tension where singularities are independent of the volumes, they play a role if a line tension exists. Hence, to illustrate what happens in this case, consider for instance w1 = 0.75, w2 = 0.25 and, as previously, a constant surface tension t3 = 1 and the same values of the line tension \u03ba. We then get the following plots (the scales are different and have been chosen to fit the region of local minima in the best way).\nWe can already remark that for some local minima, the surface tensions do not fulfill the triangle inequalities (the region of local minima is slightly \u201crotated\u201d). This fact is even more obvious as the line tension increases.\nFor the two previous figures (\u201clow\u201d line tension \u03ba), besides the \u201crotation\u201d, we can also remark that the region of local minima is slightly narrower compared to the previous case of equal volumes. This fact becomes more visible when \u03ba increases. For \u03ba = 2.6, we get\nNow the surface tensions in the region of local minima never fulfill the triangle inequalities. Moreoever, the line tension for which the region becomes bounded has decreased compared to the equal volumes case. This value of \u03ba can be expressed as the root of a polynomial but it is probably not possible to express it in terms of radicals though. Now, considering \u03ba = 5, we can again remark that the region of local minima is much smaller.\nAs in the equal volumes case, when \u03ba increases enough, there is no more region of local minima. However, it happens for a lower line tension \u03ba than in the equal volumes case. As previously mentionned, it may not be possible to express the location of this singularity in terms of radicals but it can be written as a root of a polynomial."

For larger \u03ba there is no more possible bulging. Since the region of bulging is very small and located close to the singularities, one can wonder if the previous results are not due to numerical errors. In order to be sure that this is not the case, one can check that the region of local minima can contain solutions such that sin\u03d51 = 0 or sin\u03d52 = 0 so that a slight modification of the tensions can lead to sin\u03d51 < 0 or sin\u03d52 < 0.

(126)\nFor equal volumes, \u03ba = 0.1, t3 = 1 and t2 = 5/4 (where bulging seems to happen), t1 is then the largest real positive root of P where\nP = X10 \u2212 1 8 X8 \u2212 3 64 X7 +\n( 1\n256 +\n3 3 \u221a 2\n10000 +\n3 \u221a\n4\n100\n) X6 + ( 3\n512 +\n27 3 \u221a 2\n40000 ) X5+(\n15881\n32000000 +\n3 3 \u221a 2\n40000\n) X4 + ( \u2212 3\n16384 +\n27 3 \u221a 2\n640000 \u2212 3\n3 \u221a\n4\n6400 ) X3+(\n\u2212 15497 256000000\n\u2212 33 3 \u221a 2\n2560000\n) X2 +\n15881 8192000000 \u2212 9\n3 \u221a\n2\n10240000 +\n15629 3 \u221a 4\n3200000000 .\n(127) Using a Computer Algebra System, the different quantities can then be evaluated with arbitrary high precision. We get t1 = 0.271244499897851, z1 = \u22122.031331771464625, z2 = 1.756721787151541, z3 = \u22120.569242100436099, y = 2.930530863266979. The trace of the Hessian matrix is given by 26.158972256436426 and it determinant by 4.615158111925040. The configuration is then a local minimizer. By slightly decreasing t1 (\u22120.003 maximum) or\nslightly increasing t2 (+0.002 maximum), one then obtains a configuration such that \u03d51 > \u03c0 which is a local minimizer. If we now look at what happens for different volumes (w1 = 0.75, w2 = 0.25), we have similar results.\nFor larger \u03ba, the area \u03d52 > \u03c0 disappears first (it has almost disappeared for \u03ba = 0.55), then the area \u03d51 > \u03c0 disappears as well.\nRunning several computations with a large number of parameters, it seems that bulging is limited to about 2.6\u25e6 above flat angle. More important bulging which can be observed during some experiments may fit with the model though. Indeed, the case studied here is only a double cell and some things way differ when observing an early embryo for instance. We can also remark that the constaints (volume constraints here) play an important role in the configurations which can be observed. Different constraints may possibly lead to more important bulging. To end up with these remarks, bulging remarked in experiments can be due to other physical phenomenoms and/or combined effects of line tension studied here with something else. On the next figure, we can see how a double cell with maximum bulging appears. Precisely, we have \u03d51 = 182.58857 \u25e6."

            "text": "As we have seen in section 3.4.2, for a doublet with only surface tensions, it is possible to infer the tensions (up to a common scaling factor). Moreover, from the previous section 4.2.4, line tensions have effects which make a configuration possibly differ from one without line tension. Thus, one can wonder if infering the tensions is possible in this more general case. In fact it seems to be an impossible task in general. Indeed, consider a doublet with parameters t1, t2, t3, \u03ba, w1, w2 at local minimum. Of course, as in the case of double cells with only surface tensions, common scaling of the tensions does not change the configuration, but we have more since we have now four tensions and still only two equations involving the tensions which have to be fulfilled by the configuration parameters, namely, for a given configuration at local minimum, we have\nt1c1 + t2c2 + t3c3 + \u03bay = 0,\nt1s1 + t2s2 + t3s3 = 0.\nThis means that we have a vector plane (space of dimension 2 in the space of dimension 4) of tensions (t\u03021, t\u03022, t\u03023, \u03ba\u0302) fulfilling these two equations. More precisely, we have\nt\u03021 = \u03bbt1 + \u00b5 sin\u03d51,\nt\u03022 = \u03bbt2 + \u00b5 sin\u03d52,\nt\u03023 = \u03bbt3 + \u00b5 sin\u03d53,\n\u03ba\u0302 = \u03bb\u03ba,\nWith \u00b5 \u2208 R and \u03bb \u2208 R\u2217+ such that \u03bb > \u2212\u00b5 min k\u2208{1,2,3} sin\u03d5k/tk. \u03bb, \u00b5 have also to be such that the configuration is not only a critical point but also a local minimum, a necessary condition being that (95) and (96) are non positive. If the inequalities are strict for t1, t2, t3, then there always exists a neighborhood of V of 0 such that t\u03021 > 0, t\u03022 > 0, t\u03023 > 0, \u03ba\u0302 > 0 and the corresponding configuration is a local minimum for \u03bb \u2208 R\u2217+ and \u00b5 \u2208 \u03bbV.\nThe specially interesting case of this non uniqueness is when we take \u03ba\u0302 = 0 (that is \u03bb = 0), then the solutions (t\u03021, t\u03022, t\u03023) are simply the tensions verifying the Lame\u0301 law (50)\nt\u03021 sin\u03d51 = t\u03022 sin\u03d52 = t\u03023 sin\u03d53 . (128)\nConsider for instance the following example\nThen the double cell with surface tensions t1 = 4.2, t2 = 8.5, t3 = 8.9 and with the same volumes w1 = 0.75, w2 = 0.25 has exactly the same configuration as the previous doublet with line tension.\nSo, though line tensions can produce typical bulginf configurations, they mainly produce classical configurations which are geometrically indistinguishable from a doublet without line tension (the pressures differ though)."
