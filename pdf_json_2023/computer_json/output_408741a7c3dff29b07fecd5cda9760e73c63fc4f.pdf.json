    "abstractText": "Intelligence reconfigurable surfaces (IRS) have attracted attention due to their ability to create an intelligent and controllable wireless propagation environment for supporting an efficient, and secure design. Security and privacy protection are fundamental requirements based on the eavesdropping attacks in wireless networks. Physical layer security (PLS) is an important technique that guarantees informationtheoretic security regardless of the computational capability of eavesdropping. In addition, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as a transmission technique supports higher spectral efficiency. With the aim of increasing the secrecy rate (SR), we propose a practical scenario equipped with IRS-assisted NOMA, containing obstacles that cause no existing direct link between the base station (BS), users, and an eavesdropper. Despite the presence of obstacles between the IRS to the second user, the first user acts as an amplifier and forwarder (AF) relay for device-to-device (D2D) communication. An eavesdropper tracks the transmitting signals in two phases: IRS to the first user, and the first user to the second user. Therefore, the second user broadcast a cooperative jamming signal which is known for the first user. To analyze the proposed system model, we obtain a closed form for the ergodic secrecy rate that numerical results reveal that increasing the elements of the IRS can enhance it. Finally, we compare the performance of the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA in the proposed system model, which that shows the NOMA can provide a 50% more ergodic secrecy rate compared to the OMA.

INTRODUCTION\nDue to the broadcast nature of wireless communications, the signal sent by the transmitter to the main receiver will also be received by surrounding users, including unauthorized ones, which means that this signal can be eavesdropped on by other users. Therefore, this communication is vulnerable. It is especially challenging in the fifth-generation wireless network (5G) with many connected devices, so establishing security in such systems is of particular importance. To tackle these problems, physical layer security (PLS) techniques have emerged as a promising solution for complementing or even replacing cryptographic approaches [1].\nIn recent years, NOMA schemes have received significant attention to meet the challenging requirements for 5G wireless communications, such as high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. Moreover, by using NOMA technology, the source will transmit signals to different users\nwith different transmission power. That would lead to increasing the system's capacity. Since the non-orthogonal power range is selected in this work, there is an interference between users, causing multiple access interference problems. Therefore, NOMA employs successive interference cancellation (SIC) technology to solve multiple access interference on the receiver. When a receiver uses the SIC method, it can obtain its signal by removing the others signals from the received signal, which is based on the difference between the power level of the different users\u2019 signals [3], [4].\nAnother important technology that is proposed for the next generation of cellular telecommunications is the intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). IRS provides various features and benefits have has received much attention for the fifth and sixth-generation mobile networks such as controlling, transmitting, and directing the signal to the desired directions, cost-effectiveness, increasing the acceptable\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The design, construction, and physical implementation of IRS can be in the form of a fuzzy array or an antenna array that works as passive elements and can change the phase of the received signal. Employing these elements can improve the quality of the user's signal and at the same time weaken the quality of the signal that the eavesdropper receives. IRSs can reflect or detect the signals that an adjustable phase change has distorted. Signals reflected by the IRS to the receiver increase the strength of the received signal and can also cause the signal to propagate only in the direction of the main receiver. Therefore, they significantly increase the wireless network's performance without deploying additional active transmitters/relays.\nIn [8], the authors propose an IRS-aided NOMA network, where a BS supports a cell-center user as well as a cell-edge user with an eavesdropper which is close to the cell-edge users. It is assumed there isn't a direct link between BS and cell-edge user. Hence, the IRS establishes the communication link between BS and cell-edge user, for evaluating both the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the average secrecy capacity (ASC). The authors in [9], propose an overview of NOMA, the advantages of IRS, and promising realizations of PLS in IRS-NOMA networks. Additionally, they illustrate two security scenarios in IRSNOMA networks: 1) the artificial jamming-aided joint beamforming scheme for the external eavesdropping, and 2) the joint precoding and reflecting beamforming scheme for the internal untrusted user. Deploying the IRS to enhance the physical layer security in NOMA is proposed in [10]. In addition, the maximization of the secrecy sum rate of IRSassisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) NOMA has been covered in the presence of an eavesdropper. The problem formulation has a non-convex constraint, which is solved by rotating matrices and applying the particle swarm algorithm for global optimization.\nOne of the important notes about IRSs is that they allow the signal to be fully formed and controlled, hence, this technique can prevent the signal from being distorted by environmental objects that are distributed throughout the network. Another advantage of using an IRS is to prevent eavesdroppers from accessing the transmitted signal.\nHowever, even with IRS, due to the high mobility of users in the network and the presence of obstacles such as buildings, trees, and machines, it is possible that the received signal is not recognizable for some users. To tackle this problem, a common solution is adding new paths to protect the communication channel. For example, in areas with very many obstacles, the amplify and forward relay (AF) or legitimate network users can be utilized to send weak signals to the destination after amplification [11], [12]. The authors in [13], propose the two-hop relaying PLS system combined with an untrusted full-duplex relay. With the aim of preventing the untrusted relay from decoding the source information, it's assumed the receiver generates artificial noise. Also, the lower bound of the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) is expressed.\nIn [14], the authors have evaluated the secrecy capacity when the source is equipped with multiple antennas and it the channel state information (CSI) of the user channel is known at the jammer. In [15], the authors studied optimal power allocation between data signals and artificial noise. They obtained a relationship for confidential capacity in environments with fast fading. The authors in [16] showed that when the eavesdroppers are not collaborating to extract messages, the uniform distribution of power between the information signal and artificial noise will have a nearoptimal solution. They also showed that when the number of eavesdroppers increases, the jammer should injects artificial noise with high power. The security of users' data are important issues in the next generation of mobile telecommunication, hence, the utilization of IRS to create physical layer security has been highly considered by researchers and has been studied and evaluated in various fields. In [17], the authors study the security performance of a SISO network that uses an IRS-assisted UAV scheme derived where the outage probability, average bit error rate (BER), and average capacity. To solve the problem of optimization and convexity in [18], the authors divided the problem into two sub-problems and proposed an iterative algorithm.\nThe study of maximizing secrecy rates in IRS-based MIMO and multiple-input single-output (MISO) networks has been studied in [19]-[21], respectively. For example, in [21] maximizing secrecy rates are performed for both the known and unknown CSI. In [22], the authors examined the security of the physical layer of massive MIMO systems in the presence of eavesdroppers. In [23], the authors have compared the network efficiency in the case of using IRS with the mode of using DF relay mode and checked the number of IRS reflective elements in a single-input singleoutput (SISO) network. The authors' goal in [24] is to increase the total ESR in large-scale MIMO systems, and it is assumed that the eavesdroppers are equipped with multiple antennas and are randomly distributed around the transmitter. It is also assumed that all channels have Rician distribution. In this paper [24], the authors designed the jamming signal in a network that is equipped with a large number of antennas. As well as, they studied two directional and uniform jammers and the secure message is transmitted to a legitimate destination by employing the beamforming technique. At the same time, by using artificial noise in other directions, the secrecy rate (SR) increase. The authors also evaluated the SOP by defining the suspicious area (where eavesdroppers are likely to be present). They also introduced the concept of Secrecy Outage Region (SOR). The SOR area is the area where the outage of confidentiality of information transmission occurs.\nAs mentioned above the advantages of using IRS-assisted NOMA to improve the secrecy rate, our main contributions to this paper are summarized as follows:\n We propose a system consisting of a multipleantenna BS and two single-antenna users with no\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

IRS-assisted NOMA which is composed of N reflecting elements is utilized to establish communication links between BS and the first user. Since the second user hasn't direct links due to an obstacle with BS and IRS, the first user plays the role of AF relay to transmit the second user\u2019s data, while ensuring the security of the second user's information, too.\n In addition, to improve the significant secrecy rate, the second user broadcasts the jamming signal\nwhich is known for the first user [12] and causes degrading the eavesdropping rate.\n We obtain a closed-form for ergodic secrecy rate, to analyze the proposed system model. Also, we\ninvestigate the performance of our proposed system model on some different scenarios jointly: variation of the level of transmitter SNR and the number of IRS elements, variation of the level of transmitter SNR, and the eavesdropper's movement.\n We evaluate the performance of OMA compared to NOMA in the proposed system model. We show\nthat the NOMA can provide a 50% more ergodic secrecy rate compared to the OMA technique.\n Finally, in the numerical results, we demonstrate that increasing the number of reflective elements of\nthe IRS can increase the ergodic secrecy rate, due to the properties of adjusting the beam elements.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system and signal models are presented. In Section III, solutions of problems are investigated used to improve the ESR presents the simulation results in Section IV. Finally, the concluding remarks are expressed in Section V.\nNotation: scalars, vectors, and matrices are denoted by lower case letters, bold face lower case letter, and bold face upper case letters, respectively.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nWe consider a system consisting of a base station (BS or gNB) with M antennas, an IRS with N reflective elements, two users namely \ud835\udc481 and \ud835\udc482, and an eavesdropper namely \ud835\udc48Eve. all users and eavesdropper are equipped with one antenna and act as half-duplex, as shown in Fig. 1.\nIn this scheme, \ud835\udc481 and \ud835\udc482 are near and far users, respectively. Due to the obstacles between users and the BS, there is no direct link between them. Hence, communication is possible by employing the IRS-assisted NOMA.\nIn addition, as shown in Fig. 1, \ud835\udc482 cannot communicate with an IRS due to an obstacle. To tackle this issue, we employ a new auxiliary path to keep communication. In other words, \ud835\udc481 is used as an AF relay to transmit \ud835\udc482\u2019s signals. In the following, we analyze the proposed system model and calculate a closed form for ESR.\nIII. CLOSED-FORM SOLUTIONS\nA. SIGNAL REPRESENTATION According to the proposed system model, the transmission is done in three phases. In phase 1, BS transmits the data signal x with \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60 power transmission. Note x is combined \ud835\udc651 and \ud835\udc652, where \ud835\udc651 and \ud835\udc652 are data signals for \ud835\udc481 and \ud835\udc482, respectively, and \ud835\udc38{|\ud835\udc651| 2} = \ud835\udc38{|\ud835\udc652| 2} = 1. \ud835\udc38{. } denotes the expectation operator. Introducing power splitting factor \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], since \ud835\udc482 is further away from BS than \ud835\udc481 and has worse channel conditions than \ud835\udc481. As a result, the transmit signal in BS is:\n\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc87(\u221a\u03b1\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc651 +\u221a(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc652), (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc87 \u2208 \u2102\ud835\udc40\u00d71 is the beamforming vector which satisfies \u2016\ud835\udc87\u20162 = 1. The received signal in the IRS in the first phase is expressed as follows:\n\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46 (1) = \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc99, (2)\nwhere \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \u2102 \ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc40 is the channel between BS and the IRS, and \u2102\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc40 denotes the \ud835\udc41 \u00d7\ud835\udc40 complex-valued matrices space. In the second phase, the IRS sends the received signal to \ud835\udc481. To prevent eavesdropping, \ud835\udc482 simultaneously injects a jamming signal \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57 with power \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc57. It is assumed that the jamming signal is known at \ud835\udc481 and can remove it [12]. In this phase, \ud835\udc481 detects its signal after performing SIC. Accordingly, the received signal in \ud835\udc481 in the second phase is expressed as follows:\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc481 (2) = (\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc561 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf31\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc99 + \u221a\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\u210e21 + \ud835\udc5b1 (2) , (3)\nwhere \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc561 \u2208 \u2102 \ud835\udc41\u00d71, \u210e21 \u2208 \u2102 1\u00d71 are the channel between the IRS to \ud835\udc481, and \ud835\udc482 to \ud835\udc481, respectively. Also, \ud835\udf31 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54{\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udf111 , \u2026 , \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udf11\ud835\udc5b} is the diagonal matrix, where \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc5b \u2208 [0,1] and \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc5b \u2208 [0, 2\ud835\udf0b) are the amplitude reflection coefficient and the phase shift of the n-th element of the IRS. \ud835\udc5b1 (2) is complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc481 2 . The received signal at the eavesdropper in the second phase is expressed as follows:\n\ud835\udc66E (2) = (\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf31\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc99 + \u221a\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\u210e2\ud835\udc52 + \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc38 (2) , (4)\nwhere \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52 \u2208 \u2102 \ud835\udc41\u00d71, \u210e2\ud835\udc52 \u2208 \u2102 1\u00d71 are the channel between the IRS to \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52, and \ud835\udc482 to the \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52. \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc38 (2) is the complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc38 2 at the \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 in phase 2.

Therefore, the received signal at \ud835\udc482 in the third phase is equal to:\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc482 (3) = \ud835\udc3a\u210e12\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc481 (2) + \ud835\udc5b2 (3) , (5)\nwhere \u210e12 \u2208 \u2102 1\u00d71 is the channel between \ud835\udc481 and \ud835\udc482 and \ud835\udc3a = \u221a \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60|(\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc561 \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf31\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc87| 2 +\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc57|\u210e21| 2+\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc481 2\nis gain of the relay, with relay\npower \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f. \ud835\udc5b2 (3) is the complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc482 2 at \ud835\udc482 in the third phase of communication.

Accordingly, the instantaneous sum secrecy rate (SSR) is obtained as follows [12]:\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60 = 2\n3 [\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3f \u2212 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38]\n+, (11)\nwhich \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3f is the total legitimate rate and the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38 is the total eavesdropping rate. Also, [\ud835\udc65]+ = \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65{0, \ud835\udc65}. The total legitimate rate is the SSR in \ud835\udc481 and \ud835\udc482, which is expressed as follows:\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3f = log2 (1 + \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc481 (2) ) + log2 (1 + \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc482 (3) ) .

Also, we assume that altitude of each communication link has Rayleigh fading distribution.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, IRS plates and BS because of problem assumptions and location of users (\ud835\udc481, \ud835\udc482, \ud835\udc48Eve), the value \u03b1 = 0.7 calculate to simulate results for the safe ratio at 23 Ghz central frequency and two legal users' channel conditions. Fig 3, shows ESR versus \u03c1 for three different locations of the \ud835\udc48Eve, case 1) near to IRS (ie) location (-2, 2, 1.5), case 2) close to the first user (1e) location (0, 0.6, 1.5), case 3) second \ud835\udc48Eve (2e) location (1.5, 0.6, 1.5) for three different states Exa, Hig, and Asy which are defined respectively, as follows: case 1) Exa: refers to the exact results obtained from inserting relations (7) to (10) in relation (15). case 2) Hig: presents the simulation results at high SNR, which is obtained by inserting relations (16) to (19) in relation (15). case 3) Asy: is the simulation results in the asymptotic state, that is, when \u03c1\u2192\u221e, and it is obtained by inserting the relations (16) to (19) in the relation (15), in the asymptotic state. In this figure, the number of BS antennas is 20, the number of IRS arrays is 64, and the BS power is 10 Watts. The \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 close to the IRS has the lowest secrecy rate compared to the other two cases, because the \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 receives the message with high power leading to a decrease in the ESR. Note that when the first user sends a data to the second user, if the \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 is closer to the first user, he receives \ud835\udc482\u2019s information with more SNR i.e, it decreases secrecy rate. When \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\u2019s position is close to the second user, the ESR is more than other situation. The reason is that, in this situation the \ud835\udc48Eve is farthest from the data transmitter and near to jamming transmitter which leads to increase ESR.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

ESR versus transmit SNR (\u03c1), \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e is near to IRS, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfcf or \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfd0\nFIGURE 6. Comparison performance between two orthogonal multiple access techniques, OMA and NOMA.\nFig. 4 illustrates the ESR versus \u03c1 and analyze different values of elements of IRS when the \ud835\udc48Eve is close to the second user, in the cases of exact (Exa) and high SNR (Hig). By increasing IRS elements, the main beam of data signal can be focused on the \ud835\udc481 which increase secrecy rate. As seen, the optimal and exact curves are perfectly matched which highlines our calculated equations are correct. Fig. 5 shows ESR increases by increasing the number of BS antennas. The reason is that by increasing of number of antennas at BS, the main beam of data signal can be focused on IRS which increase secrecy rate. As seen in this figure, in high number of BS antennas the curves are saturated, because in this case increases of antennas it does not lead to a further increase in the main beam of data signal. Moreover, in high BS transmit power, the ESR changes very negligible. Hence, employing of very high antenna and transmit power at BS are not necessary in the proposed network. Fig 6 compared the performance of the OMA and NOMA techniques in the proposed system model. As shown in this figure, the NOMA technique provides 50% more ESR\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

As seen, high number of antennas at BS saturates the ESR, because in this case the \ud835\udc48Eve can benefits from high number of antennas. Consequently, in the proposed system model, 100 antenna is economical, because more than its ESR does not change.\nV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we analyzed a network consists a BS, two users, an IRS and an eavesdropper in an environment full of obstacles. In this network, due to the obstacles between users and BS there is not direct link between them. Hence, the communication is possible by employing the IRS. In addition, second user cannot communicate with an IRS due to an obstacle. To tackle this issue, we employed a new auxiliary path to keep the communication. In other words, first user is used as an amplify and forward relay to transmit second user\u2019s data. Moreover, to deceive eavesdropper, the second user which is idle in the second phase transmits jamming signal. To analyze the proposed system model, we obtained a closed-form for ESR. The numerical results reveals that increasing IRS elements can enhance the ESR, the reason is that increasing of IRS elements can focus the main beam of data signal on the first user which increase secrecy rate. Finally, we compared the performance of the OMA and NOMA techniques in the proposed system model. We showed that the NOMA technique provides 50% more ESR compared to the OMA technique.\nAPPENDIX A CALCULATION OF \ud835\udc70\ud835\udfd0\n\ud835\udc3c2(1) = \ud835\udc38 {ln (1 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc41\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc561 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefe12\n\ud835\udefe21 )}\n= \ud835\udc38 {\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b(1 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc41\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc561\u23df \ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefe12 \ud835\udefe21\u23df \ud835\udc4d )}\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc4d(\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f{\ud835\udc4d \u2264 \ud835\udc67} = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f { \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefe12\n\ud835\udefe21 \u2264 \ud835\udc67}\n= \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f { \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udefe21 \u2264 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udefe12 } = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udf17 {\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f {\ud835\udf17 \u2264 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udefe12 |\ud835\udf17 = \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udefe21 }}\n= \ud835\udc38\ud835\udf17\n{\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f { \ud835\udefe12 \u2264 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf17 |\ud835\udf17 = \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udefe21 } \u23df\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udefe12( \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf17 ) }\n= \ud835\udc38\ud835\udf17 {\ud835\udc39\ud835\udefe12 ( \ud835\udc67\n\ud835\udf17 )}\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udefe12 ( \ud835\udc67\n\ud835\udf17 ) = \u222b \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefe12(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf17\n0\n= \u222b 1 ?\u0305?12 \ud835\udc52 \u2212 \ud835\udc65 ?\u0305?12\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf17\n0\n= 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc52 \u2212 \ud835\udc4d \ud835\udf17?\u0305?12\n(A.1)\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc4d(\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udf17 {1 \u2212 \ud835\udc52 \u2212 \ud835\udc4d \ud835\udf17?\u0305?12} = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udf17 {\ud835\udc52 \u2212 \ud835\udc4d \ud835\udf17?\u0305?12}\nAssuming \ud835\udf51 = \ud835\udf38\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc8a\n\ud835\udf38\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfcf , \ud835\udf38\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc8a and \ud835\udf38\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfcf have exponential\ndistributions.
