The scientific community changes its focus on different topics and applications. Technological developments can and will continue to expand the problem solving and innovative capabilities of AI. Researchers build on what has been done in the past, implement in the present and dream about what can happen in the future. Together, these developments over time lead to the state of the art of a technology like AI.\nThis paper presents a time-evolving Framework for AI (FAI) based on past and present adoptions and future expectations of technology uses. Triggers such as cost, speed, accuracy, customization, inclusivity/ diversity and cross discipline/collaboration are factors that push an organization to adopt and transform a new technology. When there are dramatic changes in the environment, what the customer needs, competitiveness in the industry and increased resources to implement a new technology, these become influencers in how rapidly technology becomes transformational as well. In this framework, the state of the art of AI is impacted by triggers, influencers and time. Three distinct industrial sectors including agriculture, education and healthcare illustrate the sector-dependent nature of AI application development over time,\nspanning the past, present and future. The authors conclude with an in-depth discussion of the six driving triggers of AI transformative technology adoption."

            "text": "This section briefly reports the most related work to examining the triggers and influencers of AI technology adoption over time based upon a variety of theories and research models. The first group of theories and models pertinent to the development of artificial intelligence include those related to technology acceptance and adoption. The 3 most used acceptance/adoption models are the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [1].\nTAM, the most widely tested empirical model, proposes three technology acceptance factors including 1) \u201cperceived usefulness\u201d, 2) \u201cperceived ease of use\u201d and 3) \u201cattitude towards use\u201d and focuses on the individual [2]. In contrast, DOI focuses on both individuals and organizations and four factors of time, channels of communication, social systems and innovation which impact technology diffusion and adoption [3]. Differences in adopter characteristics in the DOI model categorize firms and individuals within firms as early adopters, innovators, laggards, late majority and early majority leading credibility to industry sector differences discussed in this paper [3].\nLastly the UTAUT model is a compilation model built on 8 models (including TAM and DOI) emphasizing effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions [4]. \u201cFacilitating conditions\u201d mean removal of barriers impeding technology adoption. For example, using the UTAUT model in applying new technology in e-learning, \u201cfacilitating conditions\u201d included providing financial resources, new infrastructure, additional human resources and innovative educational content [5]. These \u201cfacilitating conditions\u2019 are included in this study under the \u201cinfluencer\u201d construct subcategory resources.\nBoth TAM and DOI models use the constructs of \u201cperceived usefulness\u201d and \u201crelative advantage\u201d [6]. A new construct of \u201cperceived benefits of technology adoption\u201d incorporated into the International Technology Adoption (ITA) model combined the previous constructs of technology utility to the individual with benefits to the company\u2019s well-being and corresponds closely to the \u201ctriggers\u201d of speed, accuracy, cost, and customization and the \u201cinfluencers\u201d of competitive advantage and customer needs presented in this paper.\nDigital transformation in industry is a compelling topic and focus of a framework called \u201cThe Digital Transformation Journey\u201d [7]. In their framework, the compelling construct of \u201cmounting challenges and drivers\u201d means finding ways to use technology to do business in new and better ways [7]. Coronavirus (Covid-19) in late 2019, for example, is considered a pressure point or \u201cdriver\u201d of technology transformation in a variety of industrial sectors [7].\nAn example in the healthcare sector of a \u201cdriver\u201d or \"influencer\" of AI technology is the coronavirus in Wuhan, China in 2019 which used AI tools to provide early detection of the coronavirus, isolating those areas with the virus [8]. It is likely the experience of a global pandemic will have a long-lasting and global impact on AI diffusion finding new ways of early detection which will help prevent future pandemics and influence health policies worldwide [8]. Increased competition is another \u201cchallenge\u201d creating market pressure that if not addressed, can lead to loss of market share and revenues [7]. The Framework of AI uses the construct of \u201cinfluencers\u201d of changing environments and competitive advantage which correspond to transformational \u201cchallenges and drivers\u201d.\nIn addition to building on previous model constructs of \u201cbenefits\u201d such as this research\u2019s \u201ctriggers\u201d which add value, usefulness and benefits to the individual (less time to do a task) and organization (reducing costs and mistakes) and \u201cinfluencers\u201d of changing environments, resources and competitive advantage, the authors enhance the existing theories and models by adding two new \u201ctriggers of AI technology adoption\u201d \u2013 diversity/inclusion and crossdiscipline/collaboration in their framework. Not addressing these essential issues could sabotage transformational adoption of AI.\nIn fact, the more leaders understand the biases in technology [8] and the need for collaboration across disciplines/fields, the better they can improve its usefulness and therefore, increase its transformational adoption [9]. Lastly, this research supports the idea that AI technology is a dynamic phenomenon which changes over time and a better understanding of technology changes through past, present and future developments can help increase individual and organizational ability to build their AI maturity [10]."

Factors that can prompt or influence adoption include changing environments such as climate change or a pandemic event like the 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) or evolving customer needs for a product or service [11][12][13].\nOften, organizations are searching for competitive advantage such as cost, quality, or better satisfying a particular niche of consumers. For example, a recent McKinsey study showed advanced AI adopter firms were 52% more likely to increase their market share by 52% and 27% had growth in their marketplace compared to those who were testing or moderately implementing AI [14]. Lastly, there are changing priorities in the allocation and budgeting of resources depending on societal expectations and organizational readiness [15].

The initial purpose of AI was to automate, through computers, non-analytical human knowledge, from symbolic computation processes, connectionist ones, or a combination of both. AI was initially considered a branch of computer science with limited application and restricted by the capabilities of the hardware of the time.\nTuring, a British mathematician, developed a code breaking computer called the Bombe in the early 1940\u2019s that successfully broke the Enigma code used by the Germans during World War II, a task thought impossible by most human mathematicians at the time. He also developed the Turing Test, that states \u201cif a human is interacting with another human and a machine and unable to distinguish the machine from the human, then the machine is said to be intelligent\u201d [16].\nIn 1956, John McCarthy offered one of the first and most influential definitions of AI: \u201cThe study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\u201d [17].\nOne of the most famous AI examples is IBM\u2019s Deep Blue chess playing program, which beat the world chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997. This expert system processed 200 million possible moves per second and determined the optimal next move looking 20 moves ahead [18]."

This discipline of computer science studies algorithms to develop computer solutions that copy the cognitive, physiological, or evolutionary phenomena of nature and human beings. The data, examples of solutions, or relationships between these facilitate the resolution of diverse problems [20]. AI exhibits, in certain aspects, \u201can intelligent behavior\u201d that can be confused with that of a human expert in the development of certain tasks [21].\nThe Deep Blue project inspired the development of Watson, a computer that was able to beat the two best Jeopardy Game players in the world in 2011. Its software could process and reason using natural language, and draw from a massive supply of information poured into it in the months before the competition [22].\nAt present, AI has been redirected towards the construction of solutions to problems analyzing large volumes of data which change over time. Currently, the systems for approaching functions using iterative techniques, and the neural network architectures interconnected with each other, make up most of the techniques, which are grouped under the terms \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cDeep Learning\u201d.\nAI is becoming a growing presence in our society. From the intelligent sensors that make a car drive autonomously to mobile assistants, we are already surrounded by AI in some way or the other at all times [23]. Alexa, Siri, Cortana, security surveillance, fitness/dieting apps and online\ncustomer service are all examples of AI [24].

However, sensor-based, quantitative, objective and easy-to-use systems for assessing many diseases has the potential to replace traditional qualitative and subjective ratings by human interpretation in the future [70].\nFuture AI in healthcare must be able to use machine learning to handle structured data such as images, data, genetic data, and natural language processing to mine unstructured texts. Then it must be trained through healthcare data before it can assist physicians with disease diagnosis and treatment options [71].\nAI in medicine will continue with informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. Also in the future, healthcare will increase its use of robots to assist elderly patients and targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system [72]."

AI can be used as a competitive strategy in all economic sectors particularly in cost/pricing advantages, customizing or personalizing products and services, and research using data mined from present and potential customers.\nIn addition, many AI advances have been accomplished by finding ways to increase the speed and accuracy of data resources and data research which can accelerate innovations while increasing the level of quality for consumers. Lastly, in our pursuit of the positive contributions of AI, we must be mindful of creating products and services that appeal to an inclusive and diverse group of people. Another way to increase the potential of AI is to use collaboration and reach across disciplines and sectors. Please see Figure 2 for the critical triggers impacting AI."

For example, in an educational classroom \u2013 AI can control time-consuming tasks like accounting processes, record keeping, filling out forms, producing documents and automatically grade assignments freeing up time for teachers to improve the quality of learning, increase active learning and help students when needed [73].\nIn a survey about the benefits of AI in the workforce, 61% of respondents said it helped them have a more efficient and productive workday [74]. Almost half (49%) felt it improved their decision-making and accelerated time to insights, while 51% said they believed AI enabled them to achieve a better work/life balance [75].\nThe three highest rated tasks to benefit from AI adoption were: 1) understanding trends and patterns; 2) moving data from one place to another and 3) accessing data residing in different places across the organization [74]."

Also, a \u201cbiproduct of the training identified and rank ordered the biomarkers from the most relevant to irrelevant. The glass box solution was explainable and repeatable\u201d.

Hyper personalization is the use of customer data to create and present customized contacts, information, or recommendations to customers. These customizations are created based on individual customer profiles. Profiles rely on data from browsing patterns, purchase histories, geographic location, demographic data, and behavioral data [82].\nFor example, Thread, a UK-based fashion retailer, offers customers AI-based product recommendations as a \u201cpersonal stylist\u201d, from information collected from style quizzes and ongoing reactions to product recommendations and they do this with minimal additional effort or staffing [82].\nHilton Hotels currently uses a robot concierge named Connie in its lobbies to greet guests, answer questions and provide concierge-like answers to guests using natural language processing capabilities to interact with guests and develop meaningful profiles [82].\nAlthough Under Armour is known for clothing, they reach customers through lifestyle activities of health and fitness, so they created the Record app, which collects user information on sleep, diet and physical activity. They then create personalized health goals and workout plans and after customers work out will provide feedback on the user\u2019s workout effectiveness to help maximize their future efforts [82]."

            "text": "While AI is quickly becoming a new tool in the CEO tool belt to drive revenues and profitability, it has also become clear that deploying AI requires careful management to prevent \u201cunintentional but significant damage, not only to brand reputation but, more importantly, to workers, individuals, and society as a whole\u201d [83, p1].\nRecent research shows that AI bots and voice assistants promoted unfair gender stereotypes by featuring gendered names, voices, or appearances. In the United States, Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant\u2014which collectively total an estimated 92.4% of U.S. market share for smartphone assistants\u2014have traditionally featured female-sounding voices due to the designers\u2019 innate biases that female voices are more helpful, pleasant and accommodating than male ones [84]. In addition, racial and cultural biases also make it difficult for many people to interact easily with AI assistants around the world [85].\nAI chatbots, recruitment software and risk assessment tools in the past caused harm by being racist, gender-biased or selecting the wrong people to put into jail [76]. People may not care how Facebook identifies who to tag in a given picture, but when AI systems are used to make diagnostic suggestions for skin cancer based on automatic picture analysis, understanding how such recommendations have been derived becomes a critical issue [63].\nExperts say that AI is still \u201cfragile, opaque, biased and not robust enough\u201d to provide trustworthiness [87]. Leaders need to take the necessary steps to ensure that AI is being used in an ethical manner by consistent reliance on organizational values.\nThree ways to accomplish this are: 1) Clarify how values translate into the selection of AI applications, 2) Provide guidance on definitions and metrics used to evaluate AI for bias and fairness, and 3) Prioritize organizational values [83]. Expanding the concept of AI to\n\u2018Responsible AI\u2019 is essential to ensure fairness, ethics, security/safety, privacy, transparency and accountability issues are considered [88].\n\u201cBusiness leaders may claim that diversity and inclusivity are core goals, but they then need to follow through in the people they hire and the products their companies develop\u201d [19]. Ensuring minorities are well represented among both users and evaluators of AI will make AI more accessible and inclusive [88].\nThe covid-19 pandemic first discovered in 2019 has accelerated the need for the adoption of digital tools in education, particularly in the science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) arena. A majority of software developers are still males with only 25% women in the U.S. and minority racial groups are totally underrepresented in technology fields [89].\nThe goal is to create a stronger foundation for STEM literacy, inclusion, and diversity of STEM students and preparing the STEM workforce of the future. With the growing demand for advanced skill sets, educators can provide creative and more targeted learning rather than focusing on the repetitive tasks of creating problem sets. The net result is better learning outcomes for a wider group of students and requires collegial partnering, ongoing development, and thorough testing to implement [84]."

An example of this is a paper [91] which shows that the structure and model of the scientific production of researchers worldwide and the relationships between quality, references, and synergies among authors increases as collaboration across disciplines is applied. Multi-disciplinary research is vital to effective and natural human-robot connections as well [92].\nInterdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence is a way to garner synergistic outcomes across industries from the AI field. To that end, researchers [93] recommend three strategies: 1) Collaborate on ways AI can impact other fields and look to new ideas from other fields to apply to AI; 2) Explain how decisions are made, be transparent about data biases, and use high level evaluators and regulators to evaluate processes; and 3) Scientific and educational experts should increase their AI educational levels.\nHuman-robot interaction challenges AI in many regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments not originally robot-friendly; a broad variety of situations with rich semantics to understand and interpret; human interactions requiring fine yet socially acceptable control strategies; natural and multi-modal communication requiring common-sense knowledge and divergent mental models. Collaboration of researchers and practitioners from across a variety of fields to integrate and share their data, knowledge, understandings and experiences is essential to meeting these challenges [58]. Cross-functional AI teams made up of diverse participants lead to greater innovations, more collaborations and better outcomes [94]."
