    "abstractText": "Magnetic fluid (MF) is a colloidal system consisting of ferromagnetic particles (magnetite) with a diameter of ~10 nm suspended in a dispersion medium of a carrier fluid (for example, kerosene). A distinctive feature of magnetic fluid is the fact that when an electric field is applied to it using two electrodes, thin layers consisting of close-packed particles of the dispersed phase are formed in the regions near the surface of both electrodes. These layers significantly affect the macroscopic properties of the colloidal system. In this work, the interpretation of the near-electrode layer is for the first time given as a new type of liquid membrane, in which the particles of the dispersed phase become charged with the opposite sign. On the basis of experimental studies, we propose a physicochemical mechanism of the autowave process in a cell with a magnetic fluid. It is based on the idea of oppositely recharging colloidal particles of magnetite in a liquid membrane. A mathematical model of an autowave process, which is described by a system of coupled partial differential equations of Nernst\u2013Planck\u2013Poisson and Navier\u2013Stokes with appropriate boundary conditions, is proposed for the first time. One-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional versions of the model are considered. The dependence of the frequency of concentration fluctuations on the stationary voltage between the electrodes was obtained, and the time of formation of a liquid membrane was estimated. Qualitative agreement between theoretical and experimental results has",

Colloidal particles of iron, cobalt, nickel, and ferromagnetic oxides are used as the dispersed phase [1]. To prevent the coagulation of a colloidal solution due to magnetic dipole\u2013dipole and Van der Waals interactions with the subsequent enlargement of particles, surfactants are used as stabilizers [2]. Being adsorbed on the surface of dispersed particles, surfactants form a protective shell, which works as a structural and mechanical barrier. As a result, MF does not delaminate and retains its homogeneity for an almost unlimited time (Figure 1). The aggregate stability of magnetic fluids, the high dispersion of the magnetic phase, a unique combination of fluidity, and the ability to interact with magnetic and electric fields allow the use of magnetic fluids in various fields.

For example, MF is used in magnetic fluid control elements in hydraulic systems. Moreover, it is used as an active medium in electrical devices and apparatuses, for example, in an induction neutralizer of static electricity. This method is non-sparking, which allows it to be used in oil refining, electronics, and other industries. Non-sparking potential equalization on isolated structures is an urgent problem in space technologies [7,10,11].\nThe most widespread and aggregately stable MFs are based on magnetite (Fe3O4) dispersed in hydrocarbon and organosilicon liquids and water. In this work, we investigate the liquid \u201cmagnetite in kerosene\u201d with oleic acid as a stabilizer, which is a weakly conducting dielectric with a conductivity of about 10\u22127 Ohm\u22121/m\u22121. The passage of the electric current is provided by impurity ions (with a concentration of about 1020 m\u22123) and low-mobile colloidal particles [12,13]. This process is accompanied by a disturbance in the equilibrium between the reactions of the dissociation\u2013recombination of impurity ions. As a result of this disturbance, the nonequilibrium regions of the space charge appear at the electrodes [12\u201314]. Charged electrodes attract colloidal particles of opposite charge sign to themselves and form near-electrode layers\u2014colloidal systems with a high concentration of magnetic particles.

For ex mple, when a cell with magnetic fluid is illuminated with light with a wide spectrum of wavelengths in an electric field,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1642 3 of 23\nwe see a change in the color of the electrode surface, which is explained by a shift in the spectrum maximum due to the formation of a near-electrode layer of particles and an increase in the optical thickness of the layer [18]. Labyrinth structures of ordered microdroplet aggregates are formed in a thin layer of a magnetic colloid [19]. In an electric field, the transparency of the magnetic colloid changes [20] and layers of closepacked particles of the dispersed phase are formed at the interface with the electrodes (the concentration of particles in the layer is ~27% vol., or 0.74\u00b710\u22122 mol\u00b7m\u22123) [21\u201324] (Figure 2).\nInt.

In turn, this \u201crecharging\u201d (here and after we call \u201crecharging\u201d the changing of the charge sign) of particles in the near-electrode layer is the basis of the physical mechanism for the development of self-sustained nonlinear waves (autowaves) [26]. Autowave processes are a vivid example of self-organization. The importance of studying these processes is due, among other things, to the fact that they are widespread in living organisms, for example, in the heart muscle, brain, nerve fiber, etc. Any autowave processes in physical, chemical, and biological objects have some common properties. Therefore, when studying the properties of autowaves in a magnetic fluid, new knowledge appears about this type of wave, for example, about the formation and reproduction of reverberators, the behavior of autowaves near an obstacle, etc. This knowledge can be applied in the study of processes occurring in excitable biological tissues: the myocardium of the heart, the retina of the eye, etc. Reverberators are of particular interest for research, since a number of their applications are known: in the sinoatrial node of the heart in atrial fibrillation. Although there is no direct analogy between autowave processes in a magnetic fluid and similar processes in living systems, the obtained regularities will be useful both in fundamental and applied aspects. Previously, autowaves were also experimentally studied: in the well-known Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, only a few tens of cycles can be observed, then the reaction stops [27]. Other examples of self-organization in heterogeneous systems that can be visually observed are described in [28]. The dynamics of self-organization processes in a thin layer of a magnetic fluid were studied in [29]. Brightly colored autowaves with all modes characteristic of autowave processes were observed in an electrochemical cell with a magnetic fluid [26]. The autowave process investigated in this paper is observed in a constant electric field. A magnetic field was also applied but did not have a significant effect on the process. Due to the electrical characteristics and optical properties of MF, the autowave process is easily reproduced in laboratory conditions and the number of observed cycles is not limited. Therefore, a cell with magnetic fluid is a good model environment for studying the autowave process.

Therefore, a cell with magnetic fluid is a\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1642 4 of 23\ngood model environment for studying the autowave process. The lack of a well-defined mechanism for the development of the autowave process in MF, confirmed by modeling and numerical experiments, is a gap in previous studies in this area, as well as the lack of a model based on real processes occurring in a cell with an MF. One of the first mathematical models of an autowave process in a magnetic fluid was the model proposed in [30]. This model consisted of a single partial differential equation of parabolic type, and the medium itself was considered as bistable. In [31], the basic FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo model [32,33], consisting of two differential equations of parabolic type, was applied to simulate the autowave process in a magnetic fluid. The near-electrode layer of a magnetic fluid was considered as an excitable medium, which can be in three states: rest, excitement, and refractoriness. The disadvantage of this model is that it describes the processes occurring in the equivalent electrical circuit of a cell with magnetic fluid, rather than real processes. A comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the autowave process in MF is carried out in the current paper. A necessary condition for the development of the autowave process is the formation of a dense near-electrode layer of dispersed phase particles, which was first interpreted by the authors as a magnetic-liquid membrane with special properties. Depending on the magnitude of the applied electric field, it can vary in thickness and be destroyed at a certain critical value of the field. The model is described by a system of coupled partial differential equations of Nernst\u2013 Planck\u2013Poisson and Navier\u2013Stokes with appropriate boundary conditions. The model takes into account the processes of particle recharge in a near-electrode dispersed layer. Thus, the described model is a first principle model of the autowave process in magnetic fluid, which is built on a fundamental understanding of the underlying physico-chemistry."

            "text": "According to reviews [12,34], the electrical conductivity in MF is due to several mechanisms, including the presence of impurity ions appearing in the MF during its synthesis. In addition, colloidal magnetic particles can also transfer charge [35,36]. In the synthesis of MF, Fe3O4 magnetite nanoparticles are most often obtained by the method of chemical coprecipitation or by the method of \u201cchemical condensation\u201d as a result of the reaction [37] and references in this work. The method of chemical coprecipitation usually involves the precipitation of Fe3+ and Fe2+ salts in a ratio of 2:1 in an aqueous medium using strong alkalis such as NaOH and KOH in an inert atmosphere and at a low temperature (so-called Massart\u2019s method):\nFeCl2 + 2FeCl3 + 8NaOH\u2192 Fe3O4 + 8NaCl + 4H2O.\nWater is removed during manufacture, but not completely. Peptization is carried out by the action of oleic acid on the sediment, then the stabilized particles are transferred into the carrier liquid. Thus, the MF can contain Na\u2013, Cl\u2013, etc. The amount of impurity ions depends on the quality of the dispersed magnetite washing. Usually, the concentration of all impurity ions does not exceed 1020 m\u22123. In our experiments, we use a liquid with a specific conductance \u03c3 = 10\u22127 Ohm\u22121\u00b7m\u22121. The contribution to the current transfer is made by impurity ions and colloidal particles of magnetite M+ and M\u2013, which, as a result of electrophoresis, move to the corresponding electrodes [36] (Figure 3). Colloidal particles become charged in the region of the spatial near-electrode charge and as a result of electrode processes, which are also called injective [12,34,38]. In medium high-voltage fields of the order of 105 V/m, electrochemical injection starts on the electrodes.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1642 5 of 23\nInt. J. Mol.

In medium high-voltage fields of the order of 105 V/m, electrochemical injection starts on the electrodes.\nOleic acid molecules surround a magnetite nanoparticle, thus forming a colloidal particle (micelle) [39]. The length of the oleic acid molecule is ~2 nm, so there is a layer of oleic acid molecules between the core of the colloidal particle and the electrode (Figure 1). In addition, there is always some free oleic acid in the liquid. The head of the oleic acid molecule is an electronegative group capable of attaching an electron, and in the electrochemical process a double bond is most likely broken, therefore, the electrochemical injection of charges at the cathode can be schematically represented as: \ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc45 \u2212 \ud835\udc4b + e \u23af X + \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 (1) where X is the electronegative group with an electron e\u2212, captured from the metal surface in the course of the electrochemical reaction, and \ud835\udc58 is the rate constant of the electrochemical reaction (1).\nIf initially positively charged colloidal particles appeared near the cathode surface as a result of the electrophoresis in an electric field, then when they come into contact with the cathode surface, these colloidal particles\u2019 charge sign is changed: the positive charge changes to negative due to the adsorption of negative ions X on the particles.\nSimilar processes, but in the opposite direction, take place at the surface of the anode, where colloidal particles of magnetite that come to this electrode, surrounded by oleic acid, change their charge to the opposite when electrons are transferred from the OA molecules to the surface of the anode. These processes take place in a dense surface layer of particles, where colloidal particles and injected ions have almost zero mobility.\n2.2. Mechanism of the Observed Autowave Process When the electrodes become charged and an electric field appears between them,\nspace charge regions, formed by impurity ions, appear in the near-electrode regions [12]. The equilibrium of dissociation\u2013recombination reactions of ion pairs, formed by liquid molecules as well as impurity ions and surfactant molecules, is disturbed in the region of inhomogeneity of the impurity ion propagation. Therefore, this region of inhomogeneity is called a nonequilibrium layer [12] (a zone of nonequilibrium), the thickness of which is designated as \u03bed. Outside the nonequilibrium layer, the dissociation\u2013recombination reaction is in equilibrium, that is, n1 = n2 = n0, while the electric field at the boundary of the nonequilibrium layer is E0. The thickness of the nonequilibrium region is determined by the formula [12]:\n0 0 1 2( ) d E b b\u03b5\u03b5\u03be \u03c3 +\u2248\n(2)\nFigure 3. Schematic of a cell with a magnetic fluid.

The head of the oleic acid molecule is an electronegative group capable of attaching an electron, and in the electrochemical process a double bond is most likely broken, therefore, the electrochemical injection of charges at the cathode can be schematically represented as:\nR1 = R2 \u2212 X + e\u2212 kOA\u2192 X\u2212 + products (1)\nwhere X\u2212 is the electronegative group with an electron e\u2212, captured from th metal surface in the course of the electrochemical reaction, and kOA is the rate constant of the electrochemical reaction (1). If initially positively charged colloidal particles appeared near the cathode surface as a result of the electrophoresis in an electric field, then when they come into contact with the cathode surface, these colloidal particles\u2019 charge sign is changed: the positive charge changes to negative due to the adsorption of negative ions X\u2212 on the particles. Similar processes, but in the opposite direction, take place at the surface of the anode, where colloidal particles of magnetite that come to this electrode, surrounded by oleic acid, change their charge to the opposite when electrons are transferred from the OA molecules to the surface of the anode. These processes take place in a dense surface layer of particles, where colloidal particles and injected ions have almost zero mobility."

            "text": "When the electrodes become charged and an electric field appears between them, space charge regions, formed by impurity ions, appear in the near-electrode regions [12]. The equilibrium of dissociation\u2013recombination reactions of ion pairs, formed by liquid molecules as well as impurity ions and surfactant molecules, is disturbed in the region of inhomogeneity of the impurity ion propagation. Therefore, this region of inhomogeneity is called a nonequilibrium layer [12] (a zone of nonequilibrium), the thickness of which is designated as \u03bed. Outside the nonequilibrium layer, the dissociation\u2013recombination reaction is in equilibrium, that is, n1 = n2 = n0, while the electric field at the boundary of the nonequilibrium layer is E0. The thickness of the nonequilibrium region is determined by the formula [12]:\n\u03bed \u2248 \u03b5\u03b50E0(b1 + b2)\n\u03c3 (2)\nInt. J. Mol.

The energy of attraction of the magnetic particle decreases while it goes further away from the electrode. Let us denote by \u03b4 the distance from the electrode at which the attraction energy Uim (\u03b4) is equal to the thermal energy kBT. The membrane thickness increases until the attraction energy (Uim ) is balanced by diffusion:\nUim(\u03b4) = kBT (3)\nThe total charge of particles in the membrane, per unit area of the membrane, induces the Coulomb repulsion energy of the membrane Uq , equal to:\nUq = Q\u03b4 (4)\nQ\u03b4 > 1 \u03b4 \u03b4\u222b 0 Uim(x)dx (5)\nWhen Uq exceeds the average attraction energy of Uim , the layer gets away from the electrode and the electrochemical process at the electrode stops. Thus, under the condition Uq > Uim , a concentration wave appears in the magnetic fluid (Figure 4). After the destruction of the layer particles, pushing off from one electrode, moving to the opposite electrode, becoming recharged in the near-electrode region of the space charge, and moving to the opposite electrode again, the process is repeated.

The structure of the layer is such that it \u201cretains\u201d the ions injected from the electrode, as a result of which the charge sign of the particles in the layer changes, and an autowave process is initiated.

The main idea of constructing such a model is to study the question of the possibility of the occurrence of autowave motion due to the recharging of MF particles near the electrodes or in the regions of localization of the space charge. The model is described by a boundary-value problem, which consists of a research area (Figure 6), a system of Equations (6)\u2013(12), and initial and boundary conditions (13\u201320).\nInt. J. Mol.

The same happens with the flow of negative particles at the anode.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1642 10 of 23\nLet us consider these conditions\u2014for example, (16), (17)\u2014in more detail. As noted above, the recharging of magnetic fluid particles occurs in a liquid membrane located at the cathode and with a small thickness, due to ions injected from the cathode, which cannot \u201cslip\u201d through the liquid membrane and recombine with heteroions. This allows one to abstract from the thickness of the membrane and its location and represent it by the plane x = H. Moreover, let us assume that this plane is equipotential and negatively charged, i.e., is simultaneously a cathode (18). Let a flow of positively charged MF particles with a concentration C1 approach the plane x = H at time t. In the x = H plane, the positively charged MF particles instantly change their charge (recharging occurs), become negative, and a flow of negatively charged MF particles instantly starts moving from the x = H plane (cathode) towards the x = 0 plane (anode). Let the concentration of positively charged MF particles with the concentration at time t in the plane x = H be C1, and negative ones C2. Fluxes are not known in advance and are not specified, but are determined in the process of calculating the concentration of MF particles. Note that when calculating the flux of negatively charged particles j2K at x = H, the concentration of positively charged particles C1 is used, which at time t instantly become negatively charged. Accordingly, when calculating the flux of positively charged particles j1K at x = H at time t, the concentration of negative particles C2 is used. As noted above, the model uses the equipotentiality of the cathode and anode surfaces as the boundary conditions for the potential:\n\u03d5(t, 0, y, z) = \u03b1 \u03d5(t, H, y, z) = 0.\n(18)\nImpermeability conditions are imposed on insulators:\n\u2212\u2192n \u00b7 \u2192 j i = 0, i = 1, 2 (19)\n\u2212\u2192n \u00b7 \u2207\u03d5 = 0. (20)\nWe set the initial conditions to be consistent with the boundary (21\u201323).

Then, they begin to move towards the opposite electrode, again passing through the region of charge of the opposite sign (Figure 7f). Figure 7d shows the space charge density distribution at the moment when positively charged MF particles approach the cathode (right) and negatively charged particles approach the anode (left). The movement of charge density waves after recharging is shown in Figure 7e, which is similar to Figure 7a. The moment of the superposition of the charge density waves is shown in Figure 7c,e,f. Note that in Figure 7, different scales are used along the ordinate axis due to the fact that the oscillation amplitude decreases due to energy dissipation during the interaction of opposite charges. Figure 8 shows the periodic change in the concentration of particles at different voltages on the electrodes. This figure shows that the higher the voltage across the electrodes, the shorter the period T of the concentration wave, which corresponds to the laboratory experiment. The distribution of concentrations of positively C1(t, x) and negatively C2(t, x) charged particles at time t was obtained as a result of numerical experiments of the one-dimensional model (Figure 9). At time t = 1 s (Figure 9a), the particles are charged. Positively charged particles MF begin to move towards x = H, and negatively charged magnetic particles towards x = 0 (Figure 9b,f). The green line (C2) shows the negatively charged MF particles that move towards the anode, and the blue line (C1) shows the positively charged MF particles that move towards the cathode. Initially, two concentration waves of different amplitudes move towards each other. After the concentration waves reach the corresponding electrodes, the particles become recharged. Then, the cycle is repeated. The one-dimensional AWP model allows one to take into account the interaction of diffusion and migration and describe the process of particle recharging; however, it does not take into account convection, which can only be taken in two- and three-dimensional models. The advantage of this model is the simplicity of the calculation and interpretation of the result. In the one-dimensional model, we obtained periodic oscillations, established the dependence of the period on the voltage, and also confirmed the hypothesis of the appearance of wave motion due to the recharging of particles at the electrodes. The model contains the most general physical equations, without artificial conditions that simulate oscillatory processes in systems, such as frequency, amplitude, period, etc. Thus, as a result of the implementation of the one-dimensional model, the autowave process was investigated and a qualitative agreement between the numerical and laboratory experiments was obtained. However, it is obvious that for a more detailed study of the process, it is necessary to make a two-dimensional model and also take into account the motion of particles under the action of convection."

In the course of the experimental studies, practically all types of known autowaves are observed: spirals, anti-spirals, concentric waves, packet w ves, and autowaves with r ctilinea propagation fronts (Figure 17). Video files with the movement of waves are available on https://disk.yandex.ru/d/GK7Y3uUaWujmuA (access date 29 January 2022).\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\nFigure 17.

A thin layer, consisting of particles of the dispersed phase, is formed in a constant electric field at the boundary with the electrode. The thickness of the layer changes in an electric field, which is fixed by the method of electrically contr lled interfer nce. The mechanism of the autowave process is based on the interaction between the near-electrode layer and ions, injected from the electrode as a result of electrochemical reactions. The layer of close-packed particles serves as a membrane that prevents ions of the same charge sign with the electrode from entering the volume of the c ll and recombining with ions of the opposite ign loca ed in the near- lectrode regions. A magnetofluid membrane has special properties: it forms in the field U1, collapses in the field U2, and its thickness depends on the magnitude of the external electric field. Due to the interaction of magnetic particles, the membrane does not mix with the other liquid in the cell. A hierarchical system of mathematical models AWP is proposed. It consists of one-, two- and three-dimensional models based on general conservation laws, in which the idea of recharging MF particles in a liquid membrane is realized. Despite the fact that the models do not take into account chemical reactions on electrodes and dissociation\u2013recombination reactions, it is possible to obtain results that qualitatively coincide with the experimental ones, as well as to investigate AWP parameters, such as frequency, amplitude, and others. An important result is that the characteristics of the wave process are not initially included\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 1642 19 of 23\nin the models, however, the models demonstrate wave motion. This is the novelty of the proposed approach to AWP modeling. The investigated models constitute the so-called hierarchy, since, on the one hand, they are self-sufficient for the modeling and analysis of AWP, and on the other hand, each previous one is an integral part of the next one and is a special case of the model of the next level. Therefore, first, the results of one-dimensional modeling are considered, the model is verified and analyzed, and then the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models are investigated. The results of each level are compared with each other in order to make sure they are adequate. As a result of the implementation of the one-dimensional model, it is possible to obtain concentration waves, which show the correctness of the idea of particle recharge in a liquid membrane incorporated in the model. As a result of the implementation of the two-dimensional model, a periodic change in concentration was obtained, which showed a qualitative agreement with the experiment. As a result of three-dimensional modeling, vortices (spiral waves) and pacemakers (leading centers) were obtained, and it became possible to visualize the development of spiral waves inside the cell, which is impossible in a laboratory experiment. Thus, we can conclude that the way to study such a complex phenomenon as the autowave process in a magnetic colloid was chosen correctly because, using only conservation laws, results were obtained that qualitatively correspond to laboratory experiments. The next step in the development of this study should be a quantitative agreement with the experiment by taking into account the influence of such phenomena as the electrical conductivity of a magnetic fluid, dissociation/recombination, and impurity and injected ions. This is the prospect of further research.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology V.C.; software, validation, A.K.; writing\u2014 review and editing V.C. and A.K.
