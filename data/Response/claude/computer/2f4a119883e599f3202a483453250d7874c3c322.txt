 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop automated tools to measure and provide robustness, explainability, and other important attributes for PTMs in model registries. This could help address the issue of missing attributes identified as a key challenge.

2. Design systems to automatically detect discrepancies between claimed and actual performance of models in registries. This could help tackle another major challenge mentioned. 

3. Build recommendation systems to suggest appropriate PTMs to engineers based on their task requirements and past usage data. This could simplify PTM selection.

4. Standardize training logs, checkpoints, and model formats (like ONNX) for PTMs to improve provenance, reproducibility and portability. 

5. Explore techniques to automatically detect adversarial attacks like data poisoning or weight tampering in model registries. This could improve security and trustworthiness.
