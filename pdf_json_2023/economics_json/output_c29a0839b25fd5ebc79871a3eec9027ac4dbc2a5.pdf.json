Concentrating research funding at a handful of institutions is one way to help universities achieve league-table positions, because some ranking methodologies give weight to funding for research, alongside staff numbers and publication data.\nJapan is embarking on a path that is likely to enrich a small number of universities and might well have positive results in areas including research outputs and rankings. But amid mounting evidence of rising levels of burnout and staff turnover \u2014 and low job satisfaction \u2014 in academia worldwide, the country\u2019s policymakers should consider both what might be gained and what might be lost by pursuing a strategy of concentrating funding in this way.\nJapan plans to share US$2 billion annually between a handful of top universities. Experience elsewhere suggests the negatives of this approach might outweigh the positives.\nJapan is an exemplar in global research funding. It is one of a small cluster of countries, including Israel, South Korea and Sweden, that consistently spend upwards of 3% of gross domestic product on research and development (R&D). The 2020 average for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comes in at just under 2.7%.\nBut investment alone doesn\u2019t guarantee R&D success, and the nation\u2019s policymakers worry that not enough of Japan\u2019s top universities have the kind of autonomy afforded to their counterparts in Western nations, as Nature Index reports in a Japan-focused issue this week (see page S86). Officials are also concerned about the fact that Japan\u2019s universities have been dropping in international rankings.\nThe government\u2019s response, announced in 2021, is to create a \u00a510-trillion (US$75-billion) national endowment fund for research. This will be invested, with the annual returns \u2014 expected to be around \u00a5300 billion \u2014 distributed between a select group of institutions. These will be called universities for international research excellence.\nJapan\u2019s move to separate a subset of its universities is not unprecedented. Indeed, it comes at a time when prominent institutions elsewhere, such as those of the US Ivy League, Australia\u2019s Group of Eight and the United Kingdom\u2019s Russell Group, are having to think harder about the consequences of their exclusivity, both positive and negative \u2014 particularly when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion.\nThe inspiration for Japan\u2019s fund comes, at least in part, from the endowment model of private institutions in the United States, but there are key differences that must be borne in mind. Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, has the world\u2019s largest endowment, totalling $50.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year 2022, and this delivers an annual payout to the university of around $2\u00a0billion. Some of this is used for research. But Harvard\u2019s endowment is made up of contributions from more than 14,000 individual donors, whereas Japan\u2019s fund is a public endowment. As Nature Index reports, this is fuelling concerns about possible political interference (see page S84), which risks undermining the ambition for more autonomy.\nEligible Japanese universities must apply by the end of\n\u2018Elite university\u2019 strategies might boost rankings \u2013 but at what cost?\n188 | Nature | Vol 615 | 9 March 2023\n\u00a9\nSpringer Nature Limited.
