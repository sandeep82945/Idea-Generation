    "abstractText": "COVID-19 has impacted and increased risks for healthcare providers, including orthodontists. There is no information regarding the potential transmission risks in the orthodontic community. This study aims to compare the positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in orthodontic patients at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) orthodontic clinic to the positivity rate of the local population in Chicago. All orthodontic patients who sought treatment at the UIC orthodontic clinic from June 16 to October 31, 2021, were invited to participate in the study. Three milliliters of saliva from the participants were collected in the sample collection tubes and subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay to detect SARCoV-2. All participants\u2019 age, sex, history of COVID-19 infection, and vaccination status were recorded. The COVID-19 positivity rates of Chicago, Cook County of Illinois, and the orthodontic clinic at UIC were compared. One thousand four hundred and thirty-seven orthodontic patients aged 6 to 70 years old (41.8% males and 58.2% females) participated in the study. Among all participants, nine participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (5 males and 4 females). During the study, the average COVID-19 positivity rate at the UIC orthodontic clinic was 0.626%. All of the positive participants were asymptomatic, and two of the participants had a history of COVID-19 infection. Among all positive participants, three participants had received complete COVID-19 vaccination. An increased frequency of positive cases at the orthodontic clinic was observed during the time of high positivity rate in Chicago and Cook County. A potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from patients to orthodontic providers remains, even with asymptomatic and vaccinated patients.",

In orthodontic practices, most patients are children and adolescents. Reports showed that children or adolescents frequently exhibited no symptoms despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 [3\u20135]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are similar to adults when they have symptoms related to COVID-19 at early stages [6\u20138]. As such, there is a potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients to orthodontic providers in orthodontic practices. Currently, there is no report or information on the positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the orthodontic patient population. Knowing the positivity rate may help initiate proper measures to mitigate the risk of transmission to orthodontic providers.\nSARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses [9]. SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in saliva [10\u201312]. The reported salivary SARS-CoV-2 load ranged 102\u2212106 copies/ mL [13,14]. Viral loads in saliva may also be higher than in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, increasing the risk of transmission by salivary droplets during coughing, sneezing, or even talking [10\u201312]. There are 3 approaches to test for SARS-CoV-2; (a) RT-PCR-based tests to detect viral nucleic acid, (b) rapid antigen tests to detect viral proteins, and (c) antibody tests to assess the body\u2019s immune response [15]. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard of COVID-19 testing. Besides the NP or OP specimens, the US FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for saliva as specimens for COVID-19 diagnosis [16\u201318]. RT-PCR tests are highly sensitive and specific to detecting SARS-CoV-2, with most tests performed on NP/OP swabs [19]. Alternative molecular methods to detect viral nucleic acids, such as RT-LAMP and transcriptionmediated amplification, have been reported [20\u201323].\nSARS-CoV-2 can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity in saliva [10\u201312,16,17,24]. As\na specimen type, saliva has many advantages over NP/OP swabs to detect SARS-CoV-2. Saliva can be self-collected, is non-invasive, and does not need a medium to transport to the laboratory [25]. In contrast, collecting NP/OP swabs requires trained personnel, swabs and viral transmitting media [26]. Being non-invasive, saliva can also be obtained multiple times for testing [25]. In addition, the self-collection of saliva reduces the risk of COVID-19 exposure to healthcare personnel during collection [27]. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the saliva is comparable to that of NP/OP swabs [18,26]. Several studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the saliva of asymptomatic persons and outpatients [16,17,28]. In May 2020, the US FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva [29]. In Aug 2020, the molecular pathology laboratory in the department of pathology at the University of Illinois Chicago, a CLIA/CAP-accredited laboratory, developed and validated a one-step RT-qPCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The lab-developed test was used to determine SARS-CoV-2 status in patients enrolled in this study. The test detects the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 with RNaseP as an internal control. The test is highly sensitive and specific and will detect all SARS-CoV-2 variants being monitored, variants of interest, and variants of concern as designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The objective of the study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the orthodontic patients visiting the orthodontic clinic at the University of Illinois Chicago using the test developed by the molecular pathology laboratory. Knowing the positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity may better help to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the orthodontic clinic."

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois (IRB# 2020\u20131465). The inclusion criteria included participants aged 7\u201350 years old who visited the orthodontic clinic for treatment. The participants did not exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms and reported no contact with any COVID-19 patients. The consent form was reviewed and obtained from the eligible participants and their parents/guardians, and the assent form. After initial screening with temperature checking, a set of questionnaires was used to evaluate the demographic information: age, sex, race, COVID-19 vaccination status, and COVID-19 infection history of the patients before the saliva collection. The participants were refrained from eating or drinking 30 mins before the saliva collection and instructed to spit their saliva (5 ml volume) in 50 ml Falcon1 tubes with the sample de-identification label, placed in a biohazard bag, and dropped into a storage container. The specimens were transported on the same day for the PCR-based test [30] to the Molecular Pathology laboratory for testing. The results were reported within 24\u201348 hours. Due to the surveillance purpose, the testing was performed on deidentified specimens, and thus, results are not linked to individual subject. The surveillance testing results cannot be used for individual decision-making or treatment [31]. The COVID-19 positivity rates of Chicago, Cook County, and the orthodontic clinic at UIC were compared on a daily basis during the period of the study."

Nucleic acids were eluted in a final volume of 60 \u03bcl. 5\u03bcl of the extract was analyzed in a one-step RT-qPCR reaction using primers and probes that amplify the S gene of SARS-CoV2 and the cellular RNaseP gene. RNaseP served as an internal control to ensure adequate specimen collection, nucleic acid extraction, and the absence of RT-PCR inhibition.

RT-qPCR was performed in Quantstudio 7 Flex realtime PCR machine (Thermofisher) in 96-well plates using the following program: 50o 30 mins (RT), 95o for 3 mins followed by 45 cycles of 95o for 10 secs and 56o for 30 secs. HEX and FAM signals were acquired in the 56o step. After completion, the data were analyzed by setting the thresholds to 0.1 for Sgene and 0.2 for RNaseP amplification curves, respectively. Any sample with an amplification curve for the Sgene that crossed the threshold was called \u201cDetected\u201d. If the Sgene did not amplify and the RNaseP amplified with a Ct value of< 32, the sample was called \u201cNot detected\u201d. If the Sgene did not amplify and the RNaseP also failed to amplify or if the RNaseP Ct value was >32, the sample was called \u201cInvalid\u201d. Protocols to prevent contamination were followed throughout the workflow. Positive and negative controls were included in each run. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is 480 copies/ml of SARS-CoV-2 (95% detection frequency). The assay amplifies only the Sgene of SARS-CoV-2. The specificity of amplification was determined by spiking other respiratory viruses into saliva and by sequencing specimens with positive results. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the patients in the orthodontic clinic was compared to the rate of positivity of the Chicago and Cook County databases on a daily basis.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270311 June 23, 2022 3 / 12\nPositivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Chicago and Cook County, Illinois\nThe positivity rates of COVID-19 in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, were reported on the webpage of Chicago: COVID-19 dashboard https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/ home/covid-dashboard.html and Cook County COVID-19 Surveillance Data webpage https:// ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/covid19/.

Literature reported COVID-19 breakthrough infection in many countries, including the United States [44\u201346]. In this study, we did not find a statistical correlation between the daily positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the orthodontic clinic at the University of Illinois Chicago and the city of Chicago or Cook County, IL. It is possible that the low numbers of positive cases were detected in the orthodontic patient population due to the prescreening process before the appointments. This prescreening process was implemented at the orthodontic clinic following the guidelines issued by the US CDC to implement COVID-19 mitigation for dental procedures to prevent in-office transmission [47]. Another speculation is that only asymptomatic\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270311.g005\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270311 June 23, 2022 8 / 12\npatients sought orthodontic treatment, while the symptomatic patients would isolate themselves at home until they recovered and came back for their orthodontic appointments according to the guidelines of the US CDC. More than half of the participants had received the COVID-19 vaccines, which would affect the positivity rate of the orthodontic patients as well. The high positivity rate of Chicago and Cook County, IL were most likely obtained from the individuals who were tested when they likely had symptoms related to COVID-19.\nWe chose saliva as the specimen type for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in this study. The analyti-\ncal sensitivity and specificity of viral detection in saliva has been reported to be equivalent or even better than NP swabs in many studies [18,48\u201351]. Saliva is very advantageous over NP swabs because it can be self-collected in a non-invasive manner and transported to the lab without any collection medium. Unlike NP swabs, there is no need for trained personnel to collect saliva, less painful and more subject-friendly. It is challenging to compare results from saliva and NP swabs directly because most RT-PCR tests that are performed on NP swabs are optimized to this specimen type only. Using the same test conditions for saliva may not be appropriate because unlike NP swabs, RNA extracts from saliva contain significant amounts of host cellular DNA, RNA and bacterial nucleic acids. Differences in the composition of the extracted nucleic acid may translate to differences in test performance if the test is not optimized and validated properly to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The test that we used in this study was appropriately validated in the clinical molecular pathology lab to detect SARS-CoV2 in saliva. Saliva has also been reported to be positive for longer periods of time with higher viral loads when compared to NP swabs [52]. Overall current evidence suggests that after appropriate validation, saliva is an excellent specimen type to detect SARS-CoV2 with high sensitivity and specificity by RT-PCR tests."

            "text": "The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who visited the orthodontic clinic at UIC was low compared to the positivity rate in the City of Chicago and Cook county. However, our study shows that the risk of transmission to providers exists even when the positivity rate is low from individuals who are asymptomatic and vaccinated yet infected. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 on the day of the appointment may help to reduce that risk. The absence of symptoms or illness cannot be relied upon to assess COVID-19 infection status. As such, universal precautions have to be followed to mitigate the risk of transmission to providers."
