Using the Tully-Fisher relation KL breaks the degeneracy between intrinsic and observed ellipticity and significantly reduces the impact of multiple systematics that are present in traditional WL. We explore the performance of KL given the instrument capabilities of the Roman Space Telescope, assuming overlap of the High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS), the High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey (HLSS) over 2,000 deg.

Compared to a traditional WL survey we find that KL significantly improves the constraining power on \u03a9m-S8 (FoMKL=1.70FoMWL) and wp-wa (FoMKL=3.65FoMWL).

            "text": "Weak lensing (WL) is one of the most promising cosmological probes since it directly traces the integrated gravitational potential along the line-of-sight (LoS) without any assumption on the relation between luminous matter and dark matter (see Mandelbaum 2018; Kilbinger 2015; Weinberg et al. 2013; Bartelmann & Schneider 2001, for reviews). It plays an essential role in ongoing surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES1), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS2), the Hyper Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC3), and future surveys such as the Rubin Observatory\u2019s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST4), the Roman Space Telescope5 and Euclid6.

Constraints on w0 range around a 40 per cent precision level using cosmic shear only (Secco et al. 2021; Amon et al. 2021; Hikage et al. 2019; Asgari et al. 2021; Joudaki et al. 2020). This precision has been improved by combining cosmic shear with other probes such as galaxy galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, CMB lensing, Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), redshift space distortion (RSD) etc (Abbott et al. 2018, 2019; Heymans et al. 2021). The near-future Stage-IV surveys are going to push this frontier to sub per cent level on S8 and per cent level on the equation-of-state (EoS) of dark energy (Spergel et al. 2015; The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration et al. 2018; Laureijs et al. 2011; Square Kilometre Array Cosmology Science Working Group et al. 2020).\nHowever, weak lensing analyses from next generation galaxy surveys face several challenges. Firstly, standard weak lensing measurements require a large galaxy sample that includes predominantly faint galaxies in order to overcome limitations from intrinsic ellipticity noise. Secondly,\n\u00a9 2021 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n00 73\n9v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n1 3\nD ec\nphotometric redshift (photo-z) estimation and shear calibration are inherently hard for faint galaxies and pose severe systematic uncertainties (e.g., Mandelbaum 2018) that must be modelled and controlled in future surveys. In order to overcome the first limitation the following novel methods have been proposed to directly infer the intrinsic galaxy shape:\ni) Radio polarization: Observations have revealed azimuthal magnetic fields across the disc in the Milky Way and nearby spiral galaxies (e.g. Han et al. 1999; Beck 2007). When the galaxy is not perfectly aligned face-on towards the observer, Faraday rotation caused by the LoS component of the galactic magnetic field and free electrons will change the position angle (PA) of polarized synchrotron radiation. This results in inclination-dependent integrated polarization when the galaxy is not spatially resolved (Stil et al. 2009; Sun & Reich 2012). Since gravitational lensing preserves the position angle, Brown & Battye (2011a) proposed to utilize polarization information to calibrate the intrinsic inclination of spiral galaxies. However, typically only few per cent of the radiation is polarized, thus \u00b5Jy sensitivity is required to ensure a large enough sample with meaningful SNR. The relation between inclination and polarization as a function of environments and redshifts are further uncertainties in this method. Potentially, SKA will enable these type of measurements (Brown & Battye 2011b; Whittaker et al. 2015; Camera et al. 2017).\nii) Galaxy rotation velocity field : This method was first proposed by Blain (2002) and Morales (2006). The idea is described as follows: weak lensing only linearly distorts the 2D position of photons, but keeps the frequency unchanged. By measuring the projected 2D rotation velocity field of latetype galaxies, we can partially constrain the shapes before lensing assuming a disc kinematics model (see Sect. 2 for detailed description). The rotation velocity could be measured both in optical/NIR bands traced by nebular emission lines, and in radio/submm wavelength traced by the CO rotational ladder or H i 21 cm emission. To fully break the degeneracy, one still needs information on either the direction of the shear field or the circular velocity of the disc. de Burgh-Day et al. (2015a,b) proposed to estimate the direction of the shear field from the orientation of lens galaxies or clusters, and Gurri et al. (2020) obtained the first measurement from low redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing systems, with an averaged measurement of tangential shear \u3008\u03b3t\u3009 = 0.020 \u00b1 0.008 over 18 low-z galaxies. While Gurri et al. (2020) primarily used the velocity map for their measurements, DiGiorgio et al. (2021) further improved this approach by modelling the major and minor axes in photometry images of source galaxies. Huff et al. (2013); R. S. et al. (2022) developed kinematic lensing in the context of cosmic shear rather than galaxygalaxy lensing. Specifically, they built estimators for both shear components taking advantage of scaling relation of galaxies, e.g. the Tully-Fisher relation(TFR, Tully & Fisher 1977), to infer the circular rotation velocity of spiral galaxies. This will not only suppress the shape noise, but also decrease other systematic uncertainties like redshift error, shear calibration bias, and intrinsic alignment (see Sect. 4.3). These improvements not only increase the cosmological constraining power of a tomographic WL survey, but also enable meaningful BAO detection from 2D tomography shear power spectra (Ding et al. 2019). We note that synthesis-\ning methods of radio/optical/NIR rotation curves and radio polarization can produce more robust and precise measurements (Camera et al. 2017; Bull et al. 2018).\nAmong the next generation telescopes the Roman Space Telescope (Spergel et al. 2015; Akeson et al. 2019) has the most promising instrument capabilities, specifically high resolution grism and wide-field imaging, to conduct a selfcontained KL survey. The ESA/NASA Euclid mission could in principle also perform a KL measurement, the only concern is the slightly lower grism resolution and related uncertainty in measuring kinematics.\nThe Roman Space Telescope has several primary science goals ranging from the search of habitable exoplanets to the origin and evolution of our universe. It will perform multiple surveys including a microlensing survey, exoplanets direct imaging, a type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) survey and, the main focus of this paper, a wide-field imaging and spectroscopic survey, the so-called High Latitude Survey (HLS). The HLS is designed to combine multiple cosmic probes, e.g. weak lensing, photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy clusters, BAO and RSD to optimize systematics control (c.f. Eifler et al. 2021b).\nIn the current 1.6 year HLS reference survey design the HLS is composed of the High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) and High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey (HLSS). The HLIS will map 2,000 deg2 of the sky in Y, J, H and F184 bands with a 5\u03c3 point-source depth of MAB,J=26.70. HLSS will measure slitless galaxy spectra in the same footprint with 7\u03c3 flux sensitivity down to 1.0 (1.8)\u00d710\u221216erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for a point source (extended source, respectively). This reference design will be updated and improved with input from the community in order to maximize the scientific return (e.g., see Eifler et al. 2021a, for a wide survey design that overlaps with the LSST footprint).\nThis work builds on the kinematic lensing idea as developed in Huff et al. (2013). We explore how well the combination of shape measurements from the HLIS and rotation curves extracted from the HLSS data allow for a KL analysis that self-calibrates the intrinsic galaxy shape, thereby significantly reducing the impact of shape noise. We further examine the improved constraining power of the KL measurement with respect to systematic uncertainties and compare our forecasts to the standard Roman WL reference survey. As a first step, this work predicts the constraining power on S8-\u2126m and w0-wp with shear-shear angular power spectra as the only observable, however we note that an extension to a multi-probe analysis is straightforward and a topic of future work.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2 we briefly review the KL theory. We then specify our scenario definitions and parameter settings in Sect. 3. Likelihood modelling, including data vector, covariance matrix and systematics, are described in Sect. 4. We present our results in Sect. 5, and conclude in Sect. 6. More details on cosmic shear estimation via KL and effective shape noise evaluation are derived in Appendices A and B."

The former implies that the shape of a galaxy, aka the photometric image, is distorted when it reaches the observer. The latter implies that the original position of photons can be tightly constrained by the velocity field of a disc galaxy, aka the spectroscopically measured frequency map.\nTo quantitatively study the distortion patterns of photometric and kinematic maps under cosmic shear, we firstly define the source plane XS-YS as the 2D comoving frame at the position of source galaxy, and the image or observed plane XO-YO as the 2D plane at the observer. We assume throughout the main sections in this paper that XO-YO are aligned with the major-minor axes of the observed galaxy image. The remapping of the 2D position of photons \u03b8 due to cosmic shear from the source plane to the image plane can be described as \u03b8S = A \u00b7\u03b8O, where the shear transformation matrix is defined as\nA \u2261 \u2202\u03b8S \u2202\u03b8O\n= (1\u2212 \u03ba) (\n1\u2212 g+ \u2212g\u00d7 \u2212g\u00d7 1 + g+\n) (1)\nand g = \u03b3/(1\u2212\u03ba) is the reduced shear that can be expressed as a complex number g = g+ + ig\u00d7 (please see Appendix A for a derivation in general coordinates).\nWe further illustrate the KL concept in Fig. 1:\n\u2022 Panel a: We show the shape and velocity distribution of the source galaxy without shear distortion. \u2022 Panel b: When shear is applied, the distortion pattern on the photometry shape is manifested as a rotation of the image and a change of ellipticity. \u2022 Panel c: The distortion pattern of the velocity field is described by a non-axisymmetric transformation. \u2022 Panel d: We generate a simulated Roman WFI/H-band image, with and without shear. The quadrupole structure in the difference map shows how photometry image responds to shear. \u2022 Panel e: We generate a simulated Roman WFI/Grism image with and without shear.

This additional information compared to traditional WL, where the intrinsic orientation is treated as an unconstrained noise source, leads to the significant signal-to-noise increase of KL over WL.\nIn the following we detail the methodology of KL shear inference structured into 3 parts: the photometric measurement of the galaxy shapes (Sect. 2.1), the spectroscopic measurement of the galaxy kinematics (Sect. 2.2), and the integrated modelling of shapes and kinematics (Sect. 2.3)."

(2013) because equation (2) has simpler transformation rule under shear and is an unbiased estimator of shape (Seitz & Schneider 1997)\nThe expression for vLoS(\u03b8S) in general coordinates is discussed in Appendix A. However, we can gain useful insight by considering the limiting case, where the intrinsic inclination angle i is reasonably large such that the change in PA induced by cosmic shear is much smaller than 18. The maximum v\u2032LoS along the XO-YO axis v\u2032major/minor in the image plane are given by (neglecting terms higher than or equal to O(g2))\nv\u2032major = \u2212vTF sin i,\nv\u2032minor = vTF sin i cos i (1 + 1 + e2obs\n2eint )g\u00d7 ,\n(7)\nwhere vTF is the asymptotic circular rotation velocity inferred from the TFR (see Sect. 2.3). Thus v\u2032major is a good proxy of sin i, and v\u2032minor is directly probing g\u00d7, which are also consistent with Fig. 2 (the solid and dashed bluered contours): The LoS velocity along XO axis is agnostic against g+ and g\u00d7, but the velocity along YO is sensitive to g\u00d7 due to its non-axisymmetric impact.\nWe note that Miller et al. (2013) suggest that for typical disc galaxies, the rotational velocity converges to the asymptotic rotational velocity at 2.2 times the galaxy scale radius (r2.2). Our method requires that we selected galaxies where velocity measurements beyond r2.2 can be made with sufficient SNR.\nKinematic measurements based on slitless spectroscopy, such as the Roman Space Telescope grism, are challenging. The Doppler shift information is entangled with the galaxy spectrum and the photometric profile as shown in panel e in Fig. 1.

For a combined z=0.5\u20133.0 [O III] and H\u03b1 sample with highredshift dust extinction model, the galaxy surface number density is around 4.14 arcmin\u22122 without any observational inefficiency considered.\nThis number is somewhat different compared to the estimation from the EL-COSMOS catalogue, especially given both of them are calibrated with the H\u03b1 luminosity functions from HiZELS (Sobral et al. 2013). However, we note that the H\u03b1 luminosity functions predictions in Saito et al. (2020) and Zhai et al. (2019) do not agree perfectly with each other, and H\u03b1 emitters at z \u2248 1, where our dN/d\u2126dz peaks, are not included in the HiZELS luminosity functions. Thus we think the difference in galaxy number density is a reasonable manifestation of the significant differences in these two methods. Our number (8 arcmin\u22122 without accounting for observational inefficiencies) falls somewhere between these two results. We note that the same trend is also found in Fonseca & Camera (2020), where the authors show that the number density of both the H\u03b1 and the [O III] samples in Zhai et al. (2019) are somewhat lower than the predictions from HiZELS (Khostovan et al. 2015).\nAnother estimate is obtained from table 2-2 in Spergel et al. (2015), which predicts a sample of 17.8 million emission line galaxies (H\u03b1 and [O III]) in a 2,200 deg2 survey, or 2.25 arcmin\u22122. This number however includes observational inefficiencies, and is based on the old HLSS design, where only emission line galaxies within 1.06 \u2264 z \u2264 2.77 are observable. Since in our reference HLSS sample, H\u03b1+[O III] emitters within 1.06 \u2264 z \u2264 2.77 take up 61.91 per cent of the total sample, an approximate scaling of the prediction in Spergel et al. (2015) gives 3.63 arcmin\u22122, which is very similar to the number assumed in this paper.\nWe conclude that our assumed number density of galaxies is in line with other estimates in the literature even though these are based on different techniques such as semianalytic modelling and analytic models based on an assumed luminosity function. We also consider the reduction of the number density estimate by a factor of 2 to account for observational inefficiencies as conservative.\n11 The EL-COSMOS catalogue does not have half-light radius attribute, so we neglect the criterion of hlr \u2265 0.1\u2032\u2032. However the resulting bias is negligible since almost all the galaxies satisfy this criterion."

            "heading": "3.3 Shape Noise",
            "text": "For our WL sample we assume a shape noise level of 0.26 per component and \u03c3WL = 0.37 in quadrature, which is standard across the community (see e.g., Chang et al. 2013). The shape noise of our KL sample is \u03c3KL = 0.035 in quadrature, which we explain further below.\nFrom the source selection criteria in Sect. 3.2 we know that the faintest sources in the KL sample have r-band magnitudes around 26, and 95.7 per cent of the sample has Mr < 25. The LSST Year 10 5\u03c3 r-band limit is 27.5, which means most of our KL sample have r-band SNR higher than 50. Also, according to the CMC catalogue, 97.1 (69.3) per cent of the sample have hlr larger than 1 (2) times the typical PSF hlr of Roman Space Telescope, and 39.3 per cent of the sources have hlr larger than the LSST r-band PSF.\nGiven the high S/N we expect the dominant contribution to KL shape noise to come from velocity measurement error and the intrinsic scatter of TFR. To estimate this effective shape noise per galaxy, we build an error model for the KL observables and numerically calculate the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).\nThe exact details of the procedure can be found in Appendix. B. In short, we create random samples of KL model parameters Xmodel=(eint, \u03c6, g, vTF) where \u03c6 is the intrinsic PA of the galaxy image in source plane. For each realization, we calculate the data vector of observables Y =(\u0302, v\u2032major, v\u2032minor,MB) according to equation (A4), (A13) and (8). Realistic measurement errors are then added to those observables. These errors determine the covariance matrix for the multivariate Gaussian log-likelihood function ln(p(Y |Xmodel)). We then call optimization routines to get MLE solution of gi for each realization. The shape noise is finally computed as the \u03c3\u22122(g+/\u00d7) weighted standard deviation among the random sample.\nWe show the shape noise as a function of velocity mea-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nsurement uncertainty \u03c3v in Fig. 4, with the blue and orange points for g+ and g\u00d7. As we can see, for \u03c3v > 10 km s\u22121, the shape noise is linearly increasing with \u03c3v. For \u03c3v < 10 km s\u22121, the shape noise is gradually being saturated by the intrinsic scatter of TFR.\nWe note that a similar galaxy kinematic measurement on grism data has already been carried out recently by Outini & Copin (2020), although without accounting for cosmic shear distortions. The authors built a forward modelling pipeline and applied it to the Hubble Space Telescope based datasets, 3D-HST and GLASS. Outini & Copin (2020) table 2 shows the kinematic measurements of 4 galaxies. The rotation velocity uncertainties are 30\u201340 km s\u22121 for single roll exposures and 15 km s\u22121 if more roll angles are available. The higher spectral resolution of Roman Space Telescope grism, its grism observing strategy, and the bright nature of our KL sample, should enable typical KL velocity measurement errors to be 15 km s\u22121 or better. Using Fig. 4, this translates to a shape noise of \u223c 0.025 per component, or 0.035 in quadrature.\nSimilar kinematic lensing measurements have also been conducted by Gurri et al. (2020, 2021); DiGiorgio et al. (2021). Those works are different from ours in both theoretical methodology and the instrument used for observations: they use the lens galaxies position rather than the TFR to provide extra information on g+, and use ground-based integral field units (IFU) rather than space-based grism. Thus their sample is focused on low-z bright and well-resolved disc galaxies in galaxy-galaxy lensing systems, where the tangential shear contributed by the lens galaxies dominate over the cosmic shear effect. The resulting sample contains 18 galaxies with an averaged tangential shear of \u3008\u03b3t\u3009 = 0.020\u00b10.008. The effective shape noise per galaxy originated from velocity measurement uncertainty (\u03c3\u03b3 in their table 3) is 0.013.\nDespite the very different nature between their sample and ours, the two samples have comparable photometric SNR and spatial resolution factor (R \u2248 0.8). The difference in shape noise could come from velocity resolving power\nRkin = c(1+z)R , the velocity dispersion per pixel. For the sample in Gurri et al. (2020), Rkin \u2248 90, while for Roman Space Telescope grism 170 < Rkin < 330. Assuming that shape noise scales as Rkin, then we expect the shape noise of our KL sample is 2\u20134 times larger, which is 0.025\u20130.051 and is consistent with our \u03c3KL .\nDiGiorgio et al. (2021) also studied shape noise as a function of inclination angle, image PA uncertainty and velocity error. For \u03c3v=10\u201320 km s\u22121, \u03c3PA=1\u20136 deg and i < 45 deg, the shape noise ranges from 0.015 to 0.08, which is of the same order as our result.\nA comprehensive kinematic lensing shape noise study, highly relevant to our work, is presented in Wittman & Self (2021), which considers TFR as an ingredient to break intrinsic shape-shear degeneracy. The authors utilized Fisher matrix analysis to map out shape noise as a function of various variables, including inclination angle, TFR scatter, orthogonal-slits measurement v.s. IFU velocity map, velocity measurement uncertainty, etc. Assuming that the shape noise measured at i = \u03c0/4 is a good representation of the ensemble average, we expect to see a shape noise of 0.036\u2013 0.054 for orthogonal-slit measurement with \u03c3v \u2248 20 km s\u22121 and a fiducial g \u2248 0.05.\nA detailed study of KL shape noise is presented in R. S. et al. (2022), where the authors build a slit-spectrumbased KL shear inference pipeline and study shape noise as a function of SNR, intrinsic ellipticity, spectral resolution, and TFR uncertainty using Keck/DEIMOS-like simulated data. Keck/DEIMOS has higher spectral resolution but worse PSF control compared to Roman grism. R. S. et al. (2022) find the average shape noise of a galaxy sample to be 0.02\u20130.06.\nGiven the differences between the KL implementation of this paper compared to the aforementioned, which range from instrumentation to sample selection to methodology, we note that these comparisons serve as sanity checks rather than direct comparisons. A more realistic shape noise calculation requires a more sophisticated pipeline and has to deal with complexities like non-axisymmetric disc structure, magnification-shear degeneration and other systematics, which are beyond the scope of this work. We conclude that \u03c3KL = 0.035 is a good assumption in order to explore the science outcome of a KL survey conducted with Roman Space Telescope, and to explore multi-probe and crosssurvey synergies using KL."

The related parameter settings are summarized in Table 1.\n\u2022 Redshift Uncertainty (PZ): We assume that redshift errors follow Gaussian distributions for both the WL and the KL scenarios. A galaxy in sample x and in the i-th redshift bin with redshift ztrue has a probability of pi(zobs| ztrue, x) to be mis-identified to zobs:\npi(zobs| ztrue, x) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3iz, x(1 + z) \u00d7\nexp [ \u2212 (ztrue \u2212 zobs \u2212\u2206iz, x)2\n2(\u03c3iz, x(1 + z))2\n] ,\n(19)\n\u2206iz, x and \u03c3iz, x are the bias and the standard deviation of the observed redshift of galaxy sample x in the i-th tomographic bin. Thus the photo-z (or spec-z for the KL sample) distribution for the i-th tomography bin is\nnix(zph) = \u222b zimax, x zimin, x nx(z)p i(zph| z, x)dz. (20)\nFor the WL scenario, we assume the optimistic dataset from LSST Y10 result and Roman Space Telescope HLIS full reference survey result, resulting to \u2206iz, WL = 0 and \u03c3iz, WL = 0.01 (Eifler et al. 2021a). We also add our knowledge of photo-z uncertainty in the likelihood simulation as a Gaussian prior,\nln(Lphoto-zprior ) = \u2212 1\n2 [ ( \u2206iz, x \u2212 \u2206\u0304iz, x \u03c3(\u2206iz, x) )2 + ( \u03c3iz, x \u2212 \u03c3\u0304iz, x \u03c3(\u03c3iz, x) )2 ] ,\n(21)\nwith \u2206iz, WL \u223c N (0, 0.001) and \u03c3iz, WL \u223c N (0.01, 0.002). We motivate the redshift error of KL sample by the grism resolution R\u22121 \u2248 0.002. We set (\u2206iz, KL, \u03c3iz, KL) = (0, 0.002) and Gaussian priors (N (0, 4e\u22124), N (0.002, 4e\u22124)) for them correspondingly. We note that while our WL redshift uncertainty is rather optimistic, our KL choice is very conservative, since with high SNR detection, the grism redshift uncertainty can be orders of magnitude smaller. \u2022 Multiplicative Shear Calibration Bias (M): Uncertainties in galaxy shape measurement come from a variety of sources: image noise, non-perfect galaxy flux profile model, non-linear effects in detector, atmospheric PSF, galaxy blending, etc. Those errors are summarized by the shear calibration bias parameters. We model the multiplicative shear calibration bias withmi (for the i-th redshift bin), which modifies the shear-shear angular power spectrum as\nCij\u03ba\u03ba(`) \u2212\u2192 (1 +mi)(1 +mj)Cij\u03ba\u03ba(`). (22)\nWe take the fiducial value mi = 0 and a Gaussian prior of N (0, 0.002) for the WL sample, which is the same as Eifler et al. (2021b,a). Since the KL sample is much more brighter and has higher SNR than the WL sample, we set mi = 0 in the data vector and the prior of mi to be N (0, 4e\u22124) for the KL sample. We note that existing work on multiplicative shear calibration bias found that m is a function of SNR and galaxy size, and galaxies of SNR \u2248 100 have about 2 times smaller m uncertainty than those of SNR \u2248 10 (Fenech Conti et al. 2017; Zuntz et al. 2018; Mandelbaum et al. 2018). Our KL sample approximately follows a log-normal distribution in r-band SNR\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nlog10(SNR) \u2248 N (2.62, 0.29), while the above papers are focused on galaxies with SNR \u2208 [10, 200]. This is significantly fainter than most objects in our galaxy sample, which motivates our choice of the KL sample to have 5 times lower m uncertainty in this pilot forecast. \u2022 Intrinsic Alignment (IA): The strength of intrinsic alignment of galaxies depends on the type of galaxy considered. A simple theoretical description is that elliptical galaxies are aligned by the tidal field caused by the host dark matter halo profile, while spiral galaxies are aligned by the tidal torquing generated by the host halo angular momentum, which is much weaker than the tidal alignment (Catelan et al. 2001). We model intrinsic alignment by including two extra shape correlation terms: The first term affects source galaxies at the same redshift bin CiiII(`), which models the shape correlation of background galaxies caused by their local tidal field, and the second affects galaxies in different redshift bins CijGI(`), where the foreground large-scale structure correlates the orientation a foreground galaxy though tidal alignment or tidal torquing with a background galaxy\u2019s shear distortion.\nCij\u03ba\u03ba(`) \u2212\u2192 Cij\u03ba\u03ba(`) +CijII (`) +C ij GI(`). (23)\nWe adopt the Non-Linear Alignment description of IA (NLA, see Hirata & Seljak 2004; Bridle & King 2007; Krause et al. 2016) for red elliptical galaxies, and ignore the contribution from spiral galaxies (see Eifler et al. 2021a, and reference therein for more details). We model uncertainties in the NLA model through four different parameters, which are AIA describing the amplitude of IA, \u03b2IA constraining\nthe luminosity dependence, and \u03b7IA, \u03b7high-zIA depicting redshift dependence. The fiducial values and priors are shown in Table 1. However, as we have seen in equation (10), the KL method is unaffected (to leading order) by the traditional IA contamination that plagues WL, since we can in principle isolate the intrinsic shape from the measured shape. Also, the KL sample is dominated by emission line galaxies which mostly have spiral morphology, thus the IA amplitude is expected to be order-of-magnitude smaller than that for the WL sample, which contains lots of elliptical galaxies. As a result, IA uncertainties are negligible for KL and we do not include IA in the KL scenarios.\n\u2022 Baryonic Feedback (BA): As we approach small scales in cosmic shear, baryonic feedback effects during the formation and evolution of galaxies start to impact our observable through the reduced clustering of matter. The resulting modification in the matter power spectrum is a mixture of two leading effects: the feedback distributes baryons to the outskirt of the halo thus suppresses the formation of structure, and the cooling of baryons causes more gravitational collapse towards the halo centre. We adopt the principal component analysis technique (PCA, Huang et al. 2019; Eifler et al. 2015) to mitigate the baryon feedback. The basic idea is to project the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum on to several principal components (PCs), utilizing a range of simulations that span a variety of baryon physics recipes. We assume the real baryon feedback in the universe could be approximated by a linear combination of those PCs, and fit the amplitude Qi of PCi. For a more detailed modelling description, see Eifler et al. (2021a).\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nThe simulations we select for the principal component space are Horizon-AGN (Dubois et al. 2016), Illustris/IllustrisTNG (Weinberger et al. 2018; Pillepich et al. 2018), Eagle simulation (Schaye et al. 2015), MassiveblackII (Khandai et al. 2015) and the OWLS AGN simulation (Schaye et al. 2010; van Daalen et al. 2011). We include the first three PCs in the modelling and set the fiducial value of Qi to 0, given that we use a dark-matter-only Cij\u03ba\u03ba(`) as our fiducial input data vector. The priors for our baryon mitigation scheme are listed in Table 1."

The idea of this chain is to study the impact of nuisance parameters in the KL context.\nWe show the posteriors of \u2126m-S8 and wp-wa inferred from those chains in Fig. 5. Compared with traditional weak lensing (the black dashed contours), the kinematic lensing (the blue solid contours, with systematics mitigation) shows noticeable improvement in constraining power on \u2126m-S8 and significant enhancement on wp-wa. The improvements quantified by the FoM are shown in Table 2, and FoMwp-wa has increased by 2.65 times by adopting KL method. Despite the decrease of effective galaxy number density, the excellent shape noise control benefits the dark energy science significantly.\nAnother important conclusion is that the constraining power of KL is not systematics-limited given the current configuration of Roman Space Telescope HLS. From Table 2, marginalization over spec-z uncertainty and shear calibration bias degrades the FoM by 19.7 per cent, while adding baryon feedback into marginalization brings another 15.7 per cent degradation (also see Fig. 6). We do not consider other systematics like galaxy blending in kinematic lensing but given the carefully selected high S/N sample, KL is likely\nmore robust against imperfect systematics modelling compared to WL."

            "text": "30 Tomography Bins\nWe compare the performance of 10 and 30 tomography bins KL methods assuming \u039bCDM as the fiducial cosmology. We run two chains with one assuming 10 tomography bins and the other one assuming 30. As we mentioned in Sect. 3.3, we increase the shape noise of the Ntomo = 30 chain to 0.056 to make the covariance matrix positive-definite. We adopt the same setting for the Ntomo = 10 chain for a fair comparison between the two tomography schemes. Both chains are sam-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\npling pco only. For each chain, 560 walkers are deployed and each walker makes 5,000 steps. We drop the first 0.5M steps as burn-in for each of those. The posterior distributions on wp-wa are shown in the left panel of Fig. 7, and the FoM of wp-wa are shown in Table 3.\nThe Ntomo = 30 scenario is marginally better than the Ntomo = 10 one (12.6 per cent increase). There could be two possible reasons for the in-sensitiveness. The first one is that the observables Cij\u03ba\u03ba(`) are featureless and smooth functions of redshift and scale, hence 10 tomography bins are sufficient to capture most of the information encoded in shear-shear angular power spectrum. Another possible reason is that in the fiducial \u039bCDM cosmology, dark energy is constant over all the redshift bins, and there is no room for more flexible tomography evolution given the allowed range of wp-wa. We conclude that 10 tomography bins are sufficient to capture the cosmological information in the case considered, but the same must not be true when stronger dark energy evolution across tomography bins is allowed.\nIn order to discriminate between the two scenarios we explore fiducial data vectors computed from a cosmology with time-evolving dark energy , i.e. wa 6= 0. According\nto the Planck 2018 result (fig. 30 in Planck Collaboration et al. 2020), we choose two sets of fiducial parameters: (w0, wa) = (\u22120.289, \u22122.21) (wCDM 1) and (w0, wa) = (\u22121.249, 0.59) (wCDM 2), which correspond to two opposite corners at the edge of 2\u03c3 contour inferred from TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO/RSD+WL. For each set of parameters, we run two chains as we do in the \u039bCDM cases. We show the results in the right panel in Fig. 7, with the dotted contours assuming fiducial (w0, wa) = (\u22120.289, \u22122.21) and the dashed contours assuming fiducial (w0, wa) = (\u22121.249, 0.59). From the posteriors we only see tiny differences between the 10 bins cases and the 30 bins cases (note that these assume the same shape noise level). Thus for scenarios with evolving dark energy within the 1\u03c3 region allowed by the Planck CMB experiment, we can not gain further constraining power by increasing the number of tomographic bins. The observables Cij\u03ba\u03ba(`) are smooth in nature and 10 tomography bins are enough to capture most of the information. We note however that more complex dark energy scenarios might benefit from this narrow tomography idea that is feasible with KL."

            "text": "In this work we study the performance of a kinematic lensing survey conducted with the Roman Space Telescope. In its reference design the High Latitude Survey covers 2,000 square degrees in the 5-year prime mission with imaging and spectroscopy. The HLIS will map objects in Y , J , H and F184 bands to a depth of MAB,J = 26.7, and the HLSS\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nis targeting emission line galaxies at redshift 0.524\u20132.855, with 7\u03c3 flux limit of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221216 (1.8 \u00d7 10\u221216) erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for point source (extended source), with grism resolution R = 461( \u03bb\n1\u00b5m ). Based on the CANDELS and CMC cata-\nlogue we have defined realistic galaxy samples and we get a source galaxy number density of 51 gal arcmin\u22122 for weak lensing and 4 gal arcmin\u22122 for kinematic lensing (assuming 50 per cent grism success rate). We note that the KL sample number density estimation is also supported by literature using multiple independent methods, like EL-COSMO mock catalogue, SAM-based mock catalogue and luminosity functions. To estimate the effective shape noise of the KL sample, we design a toy-model for the KL shear estimation process with the Roman Space Telescope and solve for the MLE shear estimator drawing from the said model. The resulting shape noise (\u03c3KL = 0.035) shows a significant improvement over the one in traditional weak lensing (\u03c3WL = 0.37).\nWe demonstrate KL\u2019s constraining power by simulating shear-shear only likelihood analyses and comparing to the traditional WL case. For WL, we model a full suite of systematic uncertainties such as photo-z uncertainty, multiplicative shear calibration bias, intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. For KL, IA mitigation is unnecessary since the contamination from IA can be calibrated and removed during the isolation the intrinsic shape information in the KL measurement process.\nOther prominent WL systematics also experience substantial improvement in the KL case, e.g. redshift uncertainties are insignificant given that we have spectroscopic information, and multiplicative shear calibration bias uncertainties are greatly diminished given the high S/N imaging sample.\nComparing to the standard WL strategy, we find significant improvement in constraining power on wp-wa (FoMKL=3.65 FoMWL) and noticeable enhancement on \u2126mS8 (FoMKL=1.70 FoMWL). We also quantify how the FoMKL degrades with different systematics. Compared with the fiducial KL case where no systematics are included, baryonic feedback causes a 15.68 per cent degradation. Redshift uncertainty and shear calibration bias in total contribute another 19.69 per cent degradation in the wp-wa FoM. Hence, with the current instrument capability of Roman Space Telescope, the shear calibration bias and redshift uncertainty are comparable with the baryon feedback.\nWe also explore how increasing the number of tomographic redshift bins, which is an interesting concept given the reduced shape noise, affects the constraining power on wp-wa. Specifically, we increase the number of tomographic bins from our default of 10 to 30, which significantly increases the size of the covariance matrix. As fiducial input scenarios we consider three dark energy EoS scenarios (w0,wa)=(0.0, 0.0)/(-0.289, -2.21)/(-1.249, 0.59), that are consistent (but at the limits) of the Planck 2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO/RSD+WL result. We find that no matter whether wDE is evolving or not, increasing the number of tomographic bins does not bring extra information about the EoS of dark energy. This can be explained by the smoothness nature of Cij\u03ba\u03ba(`) with regard to scale and redshift when assuming the standard wp-wa dark energy parameterization. We note however that more complex\ndark energy or modified gravity scenarios will likely benefit from the more fine binning in redshift space enabled by KL.\nGenerally speaking the decrease in shape noise using the KL method changes the intuition of how to optimize cosmological information as a function of survey and systematics mitigation strategy. As shown, intrinsic alignment, photo-z and shear calibration systematics are less worrisome for KL surveys. In contrast, accessing and modelling small scale information, which are already important for WL, will likely become more impactful in the KL case. Also, compared to WL, increasing the survey area will be more important for KL given that the dominant statistical uncertainty for KL is cosmic variance. In particular for Roman Space Telescope, where the current reference survey envisions 2,000 deg2, it will be important to explore a wide area KL survey (similar to Eifler et al. 2021a), which would also benefit from overlap with ground-based spectroscopic resources.\nIn summary, we consider KL with the Roman Space Telescope to be an extremely promising science avenue. It has different challenges than WL (rotation velocity modelling, Tully Fisher Relation uncertainties), but these are likely outweighed by the increase in statistical power and systematics robustness. In this context it is important to note that KL and WL data vectors can be combined in a likelihood analysis; the question is not to replace one with the other but to optimize the joint analysis. Similarly, the combination of KL with other probes such as galaxy clustering, peculiar velocities, CMB lensing, and SZ measurements are exciting opportunities. Lastly, we would like to point out that exploring KL in the context of galaxy cluster mass measurements is an important concept to explore in general and for Roman Space Telescope in particular."

            "text": "In this section, we detail the derivation of equations (5)&(7) under more general conditions. We assume a general coordinate system, which is shown in Fig. A1:\n\u2022 Galaxy frame (x\u0302-y\u0302-z\u0302): the frame aligned with the source galaxy, where the z\u0302-axis is aligned with the angular momentum of the disc. \u2022 Source plane (XS-YS): the observer frame at the redshift of source galaxy. Generally XS-YS can be arbitrary but a nature choice of XS-YS (and also XO-YO) are RA and DEC accordingly. For convenience, we define Z-axis as the inverse of LoS direction. The galaxy frame and source plane are connected by the Euler angles (\u03c6, i,\u03c8). We will also refer to i as the inclination angle and \u03c6 the position angle. Vectors in the source plane are denoted as \u03b8S. \u2022 Image plane (XO-YO): the observer frame at z = 0. Vectors in the image plane are denoted as \u03b8O.\nAccordingly, we define the distortion matrix as\nA \u2261 \u2202\u03b8S \u2202\u03b8O = ( 1\u2212 \u03ba\u2212 \u03b31 \u2212\u03b32 \u2212\u03b32 1\u2212 \u03ba+ \u03b31 ) , (A1)\nsuch that \u03b8S = A \u00b7 \u03b8O. We also define the following angles/axes:\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nFigure A1. Definition of coordinate systems. The galaxy intrinsic frame is denoted as galaxy frame in red. The z\u0302-axis is defined by the direction of the angular momentum of the disc. The galaxy frame and the comoving frame at the source galaxy, the source plane (XS-YS-Z), are connected by the Euler angles (\u03c6, i,\u03c8) defined in the plot. Here \u03c6 and i work as the position and inclination angles. The line of nodes is shown in green. The image plane (XO-YO-Z) is the observed frame after being lensed. The position angle \u03b2 of the shear field is defined as the direction along which the shear matrix is diagonal. In the presence of dispersing elements, the cross-dispersion direction, or the slit angle, is denoted as \u03b1.\n\u2022 Position angle (PA) of photometric major/minor axis: we refer to the major/minor axis of the photometric image of the source galaxy as photometric major/minor axis. The PA of the major axis is denoted as \u03c6 in the source plane and \u03c6\u2032 in the image plane. The PAs of minor axes are \u03c6+\u03c0/2 and \u03c6\u2032 + \u03c0/2 correspondingly. Note that under such convention, the g+/\u00d7 defined in Sect. 2 are g+ = g1 cos 2\u03c6\u2032 + g2 sin 2\u03c6\u2032 and g\u00d7 = g2 cos 2\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 g1 sin 2\u03c6\u2032. \u2022 PA of kinematic major/minor axis: we refer to the kinematic major/minor axis as the axis along which the LoS velocity has the maximum/minimum gradient. We also call the kinematic minor axis as the zero-LoS-velocity direction. In the source plane, the kinematic major/minor axis is aligned with the photometric major/minor axis. \u2022 PA of shear field: the PA of shear field, \u03b2, is defined such that, when rotating the XO-YO frame by \u03b2, \u03b32 = 0 in the new frame. Thus (\u03b31, \u03b32) could also be written as (\u03b3 cos 2\u03b2, \u03b3 sin 2\u03b2), where \u03b3 = \u221a \u03b321 + \u03b3 2 2 . Or expressed by complex number, \u03b3 = \u03b31 + i\u03b32 = \u03b3e2i\u03b2\n\u2022 Slit angle/dispersion direction: In slit spectroscopy, we refer to the PA of the slit as \u03b1 and to the PA of the dispersion direction as \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c0/2. In slitless spectroscopy, we keep the term dispersion direction, while using the slit angle and the PA of cross-dispersion direction interchangeably.\nThe 2nd moment defined in equation (3) plays an essential part in connecting the shape measurements in the image plane Iij and the source plane I intij :\nIij = \u222b d\u03b8OI(\u03b8O)\u03b8i,O\u03b8j,O = \u222b d\u03b8OI(\u03b8O)[\u03b8O \u2297 \u03b8TO]ij\n= \u222b d\u03b8S \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202\u03b8O\u2202\u03b8S \u2223\u2223\u2223 I(\u03b8S)[A\u22121 \u00b7 (\u03b8S \u2297 \u03b8TS ) \u00b7 (A\u22121)T]ij = [A\u22121 \u00b7 ( \u222b d\u03b8SI(\u03b8S)\u03b8S \u2297 \u03b8TS ) \u00b7 (A\u22121)T]ij/\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202\u03b8S\u2202\u03b8O \u2223\u2223\u2223 = [A\u22121 \u00b7 I int \u00b7 (A\u22121)T]ij/det(A), (A2)\nwhere we utilize the property that weak lensing conserves the specific intensity I(\u03b8O) = I(\u03b8S), and assume the shear matrix A is constant within the galaxy image. Switching Iij\nand I intij and replace A by A\u22121 gives the inverse relation\nI intij = [A \u00b7 I \u00b7 AT]ij det(A). (A3)\nSubstituting equation (A2) into equation (2) gives (Bartelmann & Schneider 2001)\n\u0302 = \u0302int + g\n1 + g\u2217\u0302int , (A4)\nwhere g is the complex reduced shear field and g\u2217 is its complex conjugate. Note that we only take the |g| < 1 part of the expression in Bartelmann & Schneider (2001).\nTo get the relation between eint and eobs, consider the inverse relation of equation (A4):\n\u0302int = \u0302\u2212 g\n1\u2212 g\u2217\u0302 , (A5)\nthe expanded version is\n\u0302int1 = \u03021 \u2212 (1 + e2obs)g1 + (g21 \u2212 g22)\u03021 + 2g1g2\u03022\n1\u2212 2(g1\u03021 + g2\u03022) + e2obsg2\n\u0302int2 = \u03022 \u2212 (1 + e2obs)g2 + 2g1g2\u03021 \u2212 (g21 \u2212 g22)\u03022\n1\u2212 2(g1\u03021 + g2\u03022) + e2obsg2\n(A6)\nmultiplying equation (A5) by (\u0302int)\u2217 gives\n|(\u0302int)2||1\u2212 g\u2217\u0302|2 = |\u0302\u2212 g|2 (A7)\nSimply substituting g and \u0302 would give equation (5). Next, let us consider the distortion on LoS velocity in the image plane v\u2032LoS(\u03b8O). As we discussed in equation (6), the observed LoS velocity is connected with the one in the source plane via the distortion matrix mapping. To model vLoS(\u03b8S), we first consider the velocity in the galaxy frame. Note that the galaxy disc is invariant under rotation around the z\u0302-axis, thus we can tune \u03c8 such that, in the galaxy frame, its position is r = (r, 0, 0)T. The velocity vector is v = (0, V (r), 0)T, where V (r) is the rotation curve model. A widely used one is\nV (r) = V0 + Vcirc \u03c0/2 tan\u22121( r \u2212 r0 rv-scale ), (A8)\nwhere V0 is the systemic velocity including both the Hubble flow and the peculiar velocity of the galaxy, r0 and rv-scale\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nare parameters controlling the turnover radius and the slope of the rotation curve, Vcirc is the asymptotic velocity when r is much larger than the scale radius, or the plateau velocity. In this work, Vcirc is equivalent to vTF.\nTo project r and v into the source plane, consider the rotation matrix R(\u03c6, i, \u03c8),\nR(\u03c6, i, \u03c8) \u2261 cos\u03c6 cos\u03c8 \u2212 cos i sin\u03c6 sin\u03c8 \u2212 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c8 \u2212 cos i sin\u03c6 cos\u03c8 sin i sin\u03c6sin\u03c6 cos\u03c8 + cos i cos\u03c6 sin\u03c8 \u2212 sin\u03c6 sin\u03c8 + cos i cos\u03c6 cos\u03c8 \u2212 sin i cos\u03c6 sin i sin\u03c8 sin i cos\u03c8 cos i  , (A9)\nas a function of the Euler angles shown in Fig. A1. In the source plane, the 3D position vector rS and velocity vector vS are given by\nrS = R(\u03c6, i, \u03c8) \u00b7 r\n= r cos\u03c6 cos\u03c8 \u2212 r cos i sin\u03c6 sin\u03c8r sin\u03c6 cos\u03c8 + r cos i cos\u03c6 sin\u03c8 r sin i sin\u03c8  , (A10)\nvS = R(\u03c6, i, \u03c8) \u00b7 v\n= \u2212V (r) cos\u03c6 sin\u03c8 \u2212 V (r) cos i sin\u03c6 cos\u03c8\u2212V (r) sin\u03c6 sin\u03c8 + V (r) cos i cos\u03c6 cos\u03c8 V (r) sin i cos\u03c8  . (A11) The projected position \u03b8S and LoS velocity vLoS are\nhence\n\u03b8S = ( r cos\u03c6 cos\u03c8 \u2212 r cos i sin\u03c6 sin\u03c8 r sin\u03c6 cos\u03c8 + r cos i cos\u03c6 sin\u03c8 ) = A \u00b7 \u03b8O, (A12)\nvLoS = \u2212V (r) sin i cos\u03c8 = vLoS(\u03b8S) = v\u2032LoS(\u03b8O). (A13)\nNote that the minus sign in equation (A13) is applied to change Z-axis outward along LoS.\nBesides i which can be inferred from the TFR, we still need \u03c8 and r to calculate vLoS from \u03b8S, given a rotation curve model. Using that \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6), both \u03c6\u2032 and \u2206\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6 can be calculated from observations: \u03c6\u2032 is directly estimated from the image plane photometry, while \u2206\u03c6 is a little bit cumbersome. Consider 3D vector cross product ( 1, 2, 0)\nT \u00d7 ( int1 , int2 , 0)T = \u2212eobseint sin 2\u2206\u03c6Z, where Z is the unit vector along Z-axis, substituting int with equation (A6), we have\nsin 2\u2206\u03c6 = (1 + e2obs)(g2\u03021 \u2212 g1\u03022)\neinteobs\n+ 2eobs eint [g1g2(\u0302 2 1 \u2212 \u030222)\u2212 (g21 \u2212 g22)\u03021\u03022] +O(g3).\n(A14)\nNote that the first term of sin 2\u2206\u03c6 \u221d g1e\u22121int , thus when eint \u2248 g, the change of PA is a finite quantity and arcsin function is needed to calculate \u2206\u03c6. The second term of sin 2\u2206\u03c6 \u221d g2e2obs, thus is safe to ignore. In case of eint g, \u2206\u03c6 can be further simplified to\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2248 (1 + e 2 obs)(g2\u03021 \u2212 g1\u03022) 2einteobs . (A15)\nHowever, as we see in Fig. B1, there is still non-negligible number of galaxies of which eint < 0.1 in a general galaxy\nsample, so this approximation should be used with caution. Generally, we can solve for \u03c6 and write down the rotation matrix\nR\u22121(\u03c6\u2032, \u2206\u03c6) = (\ncos (\u03c6\u2032 \u2212\u2206\u03c6) sin (\u03c6\u2032 \u2212\u2206\u03c6) \u2212 sin (\u03c6\u2032 \u2212\u2206\u03c6) cos (\u03c6\u2032 \u2212\u2206\u03c6)\n) , (A16)\nthus R\u22121(\u03c6\u2032, \u2206\u03c6) \u00b7 \u03b8S = (\nr cos\u03c8 r cos i sin\u03c8\n) . (A17)\nAs a result, r and cos\u03c8 can be written as\nr(\u03b8O) = [ \u03b8(\u03b8O) T \u00b7 (\n1 0 0 1/ cos 2i\n) \u00b7 \u03b8(\u03b8O) ]1/2 , (A18)\ncos\u03c8 = [(1, 0) \u00b7 \u03b8(\u03b8O)] /r(\u03b8O), (A19) where\n\u03b8(\u03b8O) = R\u22121(\u03c6\u2032, \u2206\u03c6) \u00b7 A \u00b7 \u03b8O. (A20) Substituting equation (A18)&(A19) into equation (A13), we get the general expression of the LoS velocity map in the image plane, which is a function of (\u03b8O, g, i, \u03c6, vTF).\nFor reference, we summarize some of the relevant relations given previously:\n\u0302 = einte\n2i\u03c6 + g\n1 + g\u2217einte2i\u03c6 ,\neint = 1\u2212\n\u221a 1\u2212 (1\u2212 q2z) sin 2i\n1 + \u221a 1\u2212 (1\u2212 q2z) sin 2i ,\nlog10(vTF) = a+ b (MB \u2212Mp), v\u20321 = v \u2032 LoS(\u03b81, g, i, \u03c6, vTF),\nv\u20322 = v \u2032 LoS(\u03b82, g, i, \u03c6, vTF),\n(A21)\nwhere v\u20321 and v\u20322 are LoS velocities measured along two arbitrary positions \u03b81 and \u03b82, and are known quantities. TFR parameters, a and b are self-calibrated or calibrated with external datasets. The unknown variables in equation (A21) are g1, g2, eint, \u03c6, vTF and i, thus equation (A21) forms a closed equation set with 6 parameters and 6 equations, and we can solve for g1/2 and int1,2 for general measurements.\nConsider two special positions, i.e. the photometric major and minor axis, \u03b8major = r(cos\u03c6\u2032, sin\u03c6\u2032)T and \u03b8minor = r(\u2212 sin\u03c6\u2032, cos\u03c6\u2032)T, substituting them into equation (A20), we have\n\u03b8(\u03b8major) = r\n( cos \u2206\u03c6\u2212<(ge\u2212i(2\u03c6 \u2032\u2212\u2206\u03c6))\nsin \u2206\u03c6\u2212=(ge\u2212i(2\u03c6 \u2032\u2212\u2206\u03c6))\n) ,\n\u03b8(\u03b8minor) = r\n( \u2212 sin \u2206\u03c6\u2212=(ge\u2212i(2\u03c6 \u2032\u2212\u2206\u03c6))\ncos \u2206\u03c6+ <(ge\u2212i(2\u03c6 \u2032\u2212\u2206\u03c6))\n) ,\n(A22)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)\nFigure B1.

            "text": "In this appendix, we elaborate on our toy model shape noise calculation. As briefly discussed in Sect. 3.3, the calculation is divided into following steps:\n(1) We generate a random ensemble of model parameand we take the fiducial parameters the same as their work (emax, a, e0)=(0.804, 0.2539, 0.0256), and the amplitude\nters Xmodel=(eint, \u03c6, g, vTF), with eint following the distribution in Miller et al. (2013). (see Fig. B1)\np(eint) = Ae(1\u2212 exp[(e\u2212 emax)/a]) (1 + e) \u221a e2 + e20 , (B1)\nA = 2.432. \u03c6 follows a uniform distribution among [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and vTF follows N (200, 20) km s\u22121. g is fixed to the fiducial value, in our case is 0.05\u00d7exp(i\u03c0/4). We fix qz = 0.1 such that the maximum intrinsic ellipticity is smaller than emax. We note that the distribution from equation B1 is biased towards low inclination angles or face-on galaxies. This likely due to the fact that edge-on galaxies are sampled by less pixels, which implies that it is harder to get robust shear measurements. Also, the H\u03b1 emissions are extincted by dust more severely in edge-on galaxies and are less likely to be included (Hirata 2009). These selection also effects pose an interesting optimization avenue for a suitable KL sample. We leave a more rigorous discussion on sample selection effects to future work.\n(2) For eachXmodel realization, we calculate a data vector of observables Y =(\u0302, v\u2032major, v\u2032minor, MB) out of equation (A4), (A13) and (8). Here we assume a constant galaxy rotation curve vcirc = vTF. Then we apply measurement noise. The noise is determined as follows: i) We assume shape measurement error \u03c3 =0.009 per \u0302 component, which is derived from equation (13) in Chang et al. (2013) according to the typical photometric SNR and angular size of our KL sample. ii) The fiducial velocity measurement error is \u03c3vmajor = \u03c3vminor = 15 km s\n\u22121. This velocity error is motivated by Outini & Copin (2020), as stated in Sect. 3.3. iii) We assume a photometric SNR of 40 according to the typical KL sample selected from CMC (see Sect. 3.2). The TFR intrinsic scatter is \u03c3TF=0.049 dex (Reyes et al. 2011), and is absorbed into photometric measurement noise \u03c3M = \u221a (1.0857/SNR)2 + (\u03c3TF/b)2.\n(3) A multivariate Gaussian likelihood function is constructed for the model, along with a prior on eint as equation (B1). We assume a diagonal covariance matrix for the data vector, with the variance determined in the previous step.\n(4) For each realization, we optimize the log-likelihood function using the scipy.optimize.minimize routine starting around the neighbourhood of the fiducial model parameter. We also calculate the Fisher matrix via five-point stencil finite difference, then invert the matrix to estimate \u03c32(g1/2) at this parameter point.\n(5) We evaluate the \u03c3\u22122(g1/2)-weighted ensemble mean and std, and take the weighted std as the shape noise, which is \u03c3(g) \u2248 0.025.\nIn the lower panel of Fig. B1, we show the shape noise as a function of eint. Source galaxies with smaller inclination angles have smaller shape noise and are more sensitive to the shear field than galaxies with larger inclination angles. Since our KL sample is biased towards low inclination galaxies, the weighting scheme is essential to suppress the effective shape noise per galaxy.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2021)"
