The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the detailed characterization, synthesis, and analysis of the new chalcogenide molybdenum clusters, along with the discussion on their properties and potential reversible transformations, suggest areas where future research could naturally extend. For instance, exploring further applications based on their paramagnetic and redox properties, or investigating the synthesis of similar clusters with different ligands or metal centers, could be inferred as potential future research directions. Without a direct statement on future research within the provided text, it's challenging to quote a specific section explicitly outlining future research directions.
