    "abstractText": "An amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PChM-PNIPAM), composed of poly(cholesteryl 6methacryloyloxy hexanoate) (PChM) and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) blocks, was prepared via reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer radical polymerization. The PChM and PNIPAM blocks exhibited liquid crystalline behavior and a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), respectively. PChM-PNIPAM formed water-soluble polymer micelles in water below the LCST because of hydrophobic interactions of the PChM blocks. The PChM and PNIPAM blocks formed the core and hydrophilic shell of the micelles, respectively. With increasing temperature, the molecular motion of the pendant cholesteryl groups increased, and a liquid crystalline phase transition occurred from an amorphous state in the core. With further increases in temperature, the PNIPAM block in the shell exhibited the LCST and dehydrated. Hydrophobic interactions of the PNIPAM shells resulted in inter-micellar aggregation above the LCST.",

            "text": "Cholesterol is a lipid sterol and a component of the eukaryotic cell membrane that plays a vital role in regulating the fluidity and permeability of the membrane [1,2]. Synthetic polymers containing cholesterol as a biological substance have attracted attention in biomedical fields, such as bioimaging and drug delivery systems (DDS) [3]. Additionally, cholesterol derivatives produce cholesteric liquid crystals [4]. Cholesteric liquid crystals have a spiral structure, in which the layers of oriented mesogens are twisted [5]. Generally, liquid crystals are classified into nematic, smectic, and cholesteric phases according to their orientation [6]. Additionally, liquid crystals are classified into thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals [7]. Thermotropic liquid crystals show a liquid crystalline phase induced by temperature, and lyotropic liquid crystals show a liquid crystalline phase in solution. Liquid crystals have attracted interest in biology and materials chemistry as dynamic functional soft materials [8]. Amphiphilic block copolymers have applications in water-based paints, coatings, cosmetics, foods, personal care products, DDS, and water treatment [9\u201311]. Generally, amphipathic diblock copolymers form interpolymer aggregates through the association of the hydrophobic blocks in water [12]. The shape of the polymer aggregate depends on the molecular weight balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, the chemical structures of each block, and the degree of polymerization (DP) [13\u201316]. The shape of polymer aggregates in water changes to spherical micelles, worm-like micelles, and vesicles with increasing DP of the hydrophobic block or decreasing DP of the hydrophilic\nPolymers 2023, 15, 770. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15030770 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 770 2 of 14\nblock [17]. Amphiphilic compounds containing highly hydrophobic cholesteryl groups can associate in water through hydrophobic interactions [18]. Polymers containing cholesteryl groups form hierarchically stable nanostructures by self-assembly upon heating [19\u201322]. Amphipathic block copolymers containing cholesteryl moieties adopt a liquid crystalline phase from disk-shaped micelles and a stacked-disk morphology in water [23,24]. Thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in water [25\u201328]. PNIPAM can dissolve in water below the LCST because the pendant amide groups are hydrated through hydrogen bonding interactions with water molecules. Above the LCST, the pendant amide groups are dehydrated because of the increased molecular motion to destroy the hydrogen bonding interactions with water molecules, and PNIPAM cannot dissolve in water. The thermoresponse behavior of PNIPAM has been applied in the fields of medicine, pharmacy, and engineering [29]. Boiss\u00e9 et al. [30]. reported the association behavior of amphipathic diblock copolymers composed of the hydrophobic cholesteryl groups-containing block exhibiting liquid crystallinity and the thermo-responsive poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEA) block. The amphipathic diblock copolymers form fibers with a smectic ordered structure because of the mesogenic cholesteryl groups in water. Above the LCST, PDEA on the fiber surface became hydrophobic and aggregated to form a precipitate. In this study, a diblock copolymer (PChM-PNIPAM) composed of the hydrophobic liquid crystalline poly(cholesteryl 6-methacryloyloxy hexanoate) (PChM) block and the thermo-responsive PNIPAM block was prepared via reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization (Figure 1). In water, PChM-PNIPAM formed polymer micelles with a hydrophobic PChM block core and hydrophilic PNIPMAM shells below the LCST. Increasing the temperature of the PChM-PNIPAM aqueous solution induced a liquid crystalline phase transition of the pendant cholesteryl groups in the core. Further increases in temperature above the LCST resulted in dehydration of the PNIPAM shells and agglomeration to form large inter-micellar aggregates. We have studied the self-association and the thermo-responsive behaviors of PChM-PNIPAM in water.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 14\npolymer aggregates in water changes to spherical micelles, worm-like micelles, and vesicles with increasing DP of the hydrophobic block or decreasing DP of the hydrophilic block [17].

The hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and light scattering intensity (LSI) of the aqueous polymer solutions were monitored in the range of 10\u201370 \u25e6C. Static light scattering (SLS, DLS-7000, Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan) was performed at 25 \u25e6C using a He\u2013Ne laser (632.8 nm, 10.0 mW) as the light source. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was calculated from the Zimm plot. The refractive index as a function of the polymer concentration (dn/dCp) at 633 nm was determined using an Otsuka Electronics (Osaka, Japan) DRM-3000 differential refractometer at 25 \u25e6C. The fluorescence measurements were performed using a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The polymer was dissolved in a saturated aqueous pyrene solution (6.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 M). The solution was excited at 334 nm, and the excitation and emission slit widths were measured at 20 and 2.5 nm, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Keyence (Osaka, Japan) VE9800 microscope. The sample was prepared by dropping aqueous sample solutions on Al stages at 25 and 70 \u25e6C on a hot plate. The sample was dried in air at 25 and 70 \u25e6C and sputtered with platinum.

Both GPC elution curves were similar, while the peak for PChM-PNIPAM was shifted to a higher molecular weight region compared with that for PChM. Conversely, the Mn(GPC) values were similar for each polymer, presumably because there were unexpected interactions between the polymer and the GPC column [35]. The Mn(GPC) values for PChM and PChM-PNIPAM were 2.34 \u00d7 104 g/mol and 2.42 \u00d7 104 g/mol, respectively. The Mn(NMR) values were close to the Mn(theo) values.

PChM showed a stretching band for an ester at 1720 cm\u22121. The FTIR spectrum of PChM-PNIPAM showed both peaks at 1650 and 1720 cm\u22121. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting point (Tm) were examined by second heating DSC cycles for PChM and PChM-PNIPAM (Table S1 and Figure S4). For PChM, the Tg was observed at 51 \u25e6C. An endothermic peak associated with Tm from the liquid crystalline to anisotropic phases was observed at 169 \u25e6C [36]. When PChM was observed using crossed Nicols of a polarizing optical microscope with heating, a bright field was noted above 51 \u25e6C, and a liquid crystalline texture was confirmed. The observation field became dark with further increases in temperature above 169 \u25e6C, and a transition from a liquid crystalline phase to an isotropic phase was observed. From PChMPNIPAM, the Tg of the PChM and PNIPAM blocks were 50 \u25e6C and 140 \u25e6C, respectively [37]. Furthermore, the Tm associated with the transition from liquid crystal to isotropic phases was observed as an endothermic peak. In the crossed Nicols observation for PChMPNIPAM, the bright field with a liquid crystalline texture was observed above 50 \u25e6C, and the observation field was dark above 171 \u25e6C because of a transition from liquid crystalline to isotropic phases.

The emission intensity ratio (I3/I1) of the first vibration peak at 373 nm (I1) and the third vibration peak at 385 nm (I3) in the pyrene fluorescence spectra depends on the microenvironmental polarity around the pyrene molecule [42].

All the TD permeated through the dialysis membrane regardless of the presence of PChMPNIPAM. PChM-PNIPAM aggregates cannot incorporate hydrophilic TD molecules. Therefore, the PChM-PNIPAM aggregates in water existed as a solid particle like a core\u2013 shell spherical polymer micelle.\nFigure 6.

RSEM and RTEM were 339 and 171 nm, respectively. Interparticle aggregates were formed because the temperature at 70 \u00b0C was higher than the LCST of the PNIPAM shells. Light scattering and %T were measured at 0.04 g/L because the solution became turbid at high concentrations. Conversely, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of the diluted sample with Cp = 0.04 g/L could not produce good data because of a poor S/N ratio. Therefore, the PChM-PNIPAM aqueous solution with Cp = 0.04 g/L was concentrated to 1.0 g/L and then measured by SAXS (Figure 8). At 20 \u00b0C, peaks attributed to the orientation of the pendant cholesteryl groups in the core were observed. The pendant cholesteryl groups in the core were ordered presumably because of heating to increase the Cp by evaporation. The ordered structure as a liquid crystal phase in the core was maintained as a crystalline phase, even when cooled to 20 \u00b0C. The ordered liquid crystalline structure was frozen as a crystalline ordered structure. The PChM-PNIPAM aqueous solution was prepared using a dialysis method from the THF solution against pure water to form aggregates caused by hydrophobic interactions. The pendant cholesteryl groups aggregated in an amorphous state when the hydrophobic PChM blocks formed the core. The core became a liquid crystalline state upon heating, and the order of the cholesteryl groups remained, even when the temperature was decreased to 20 \u00b0C. Two XRD peaks were observed from the SAXS data at all temperatures. The magnitude of the scattering vectors (q) of the primary (q*) and secondary order (2q*) peaks were 1.25 and 2.50 nm\u22121, respectively.

This suggests that the cholesteryl group forms a lamellar structure in the core [44]. The lattice spacing (d) was calculated from the following equation: d = 2\u03c0/q. The d obtained from the primary-order peak was 5.03 nm. This d value corresponded to the thickness of the lamellar structure when the cholesteryl groups in the PChM were oriented as a two-layer packing structure (Figure S8) [45].

The cholesteryl groups in the core of the polymer micelles formed from PChM-PNIPAM in water were tightly packed because of strong hydrophobic interactions of the PChM blocks.

Conclusions PChM-PNIPAM, composed of PChM exhibiting hydrophobic liquid crystalline behavior and PNIPAM with an LCST in water, was prepared via RAFT polymerization. In water at 25 \u00b0C, PChM-PNIPAM formed spherical polymer micelles with Rh = 152 nm because of hydrophobic interactions. The Nagg and \u03a6H were 2.84 \u00d7 105 and 0.873 g/cm3, respectively. These high values suggested that PChM-PNIPAM formed dense-packed aggregates. Furthermore, the Rg/Rh indicated a rigid sphere. SEM and TEM revealed spherical objects. The PChM-PNIPAM aqueous solution increased Rh in two steps by heating. Rh increased from 152 to 169 nm at temperatures above 34 \u00b0C, with further increases above 45 \u00b0C, reaching 192 nm at 70 \u00b0C. The first increase in Rh suggests an increase in the core size due to the phase transition of the cholesteryl groups in the core from the amorphous to the liquid crystalline phase. In the second stage, the increase in Rh indicated interparticle aggregation caused by dehydration of the PNIPAM shells.

Conversely, after cooling from the liquid crystalline state, the order of the liquid crystalline state in the core was kept as a frozen aggregate in the crystal state at room temperature. The thermo-responsive polymer micelles have potential applications as carriers that regulate guest molecule release in accordance with phase transition from the liquid crystalline to the amorphous phase.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 770 12 of 14\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15030770/s1, Table S1: Glass transition (Tg) and melting temperatures (Tm) of PChM and PChM-PNIPAM; Scheme S1: Synthesis of ChM; Scheme S2.
