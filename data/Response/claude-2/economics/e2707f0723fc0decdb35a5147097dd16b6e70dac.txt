 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar study evaluating EWP effectiveness and efficiency in other developing countries going through rapid urbanization, such as India or countries in Africa. This could reveal interesting comparative findings. 

2. Evaluate EWP at a more granular level, such as for individual cities rather than provinces. This could provide more specific insights to help guide urban planning policies.

3. Incorporate additional indicators into the EWP evaluation framework, such as measures of biodiversity, green space, or waste management. This could provide a more holistic assessment. 

4. Use more advanced statistical techniques like structural equation modeling to analyze the relationships between the different EWP indicators. This could provide insights into how the indicators influence each other.

5. Conduct surveys or interviews with urban residents and policymakers to supplement the quantitative EWP analysis with qualitative perspectives on ecological well-being. This could help validate and enrich the findings.
