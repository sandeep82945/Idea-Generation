    "abstractText": "The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) is currently the best infrastructure for long-baseline interferometry in particular in terms of sensitivity and accessibility to the general user. MATISSE, installed at the VLTI focus since end of 2017, belongs to the second generation instruments. MATISSE, the Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment, for the first time accesses high resolution imaging over a wide spectral domain of the mid-infrared. The instrument is a spectro-interferometric imager in the atmospheric transmission windows called L, M, and N, from 2.8 to 13.0 microns, and combines four optical beams from the VLTI\u2019s unit or auxiliary telescopes. The instrument utilises a multi-axial beam combination that delivers spectrally dispersed fringes. The signal provides the following quantities at several spectral resolutions: photometric flux, coherent flux, visibility, closure phase, wavelength differential visibility and phase, and aperture-synthesis imaging. MATISSE can operate as a stand alone instrument or with the GRA4MAT set-up employing the GRAVITY fringe tracking capabilities. The updated MATISSE performance are presented at the conference together with a selection of two front-line science topics explored since the start of the science operations in 2019. Finally we present \u2217* MATISSE was designed, funded, and built in close collaboration with ESO by a consortium composed of institutes in France (J.-L. Lagrange Laboratory \u2014 INSU-CNRS \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur Observatory \u2014 the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis), Germany (MPIA, MPIfR, and the University of Kiel), the Netherlands (NOVA and the University of Leiden), and Austria (the University of Vienna). The Konkoly Observatory and the University of Cologne have also provided support in manufacturing the instrument.",

            "text": "The Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment, MATISSE, is the mid-infrared spectrograph and imager of the VLTI. This second generation interferometric instrument was designed with prime science objectives focusing on the Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and on their associated stellar and planet formation processes, on the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and their active central engine, on the Stellar Physics, the surface structure and mass loss of stars at different evolutionary stages and in frequent binary interactions.\nIn particular, MATISSE is perfectly designed to observe the small spatial scales in YSO environments at wavelengths at which the dust material that represents the elementary bricks initiating the growth of the planet core embryos, emits efficiently. MATISSE will also be of importance to probe the inner dust structure in AGNs by testing the validity of the AGN unified model. That model is supposedly edge-on and is hiding the central source in type-II AGN and it is face-on and dominated by the inner dust sublimation radius in type-I AGN. Clumpy structures with important polar extensions are expected to trace the dust driven wind in the brightest AGNs.\nMATISSE gives access to the L (2.8\u20134.2) , M (4.5\u20135.0 m) and N bands (8.0\u201313.0 m) band, various spectral resolutions between R 30 and R 3500, which allow to study very specific gas and dust material spectral signatures (see Table 1). MATISSE combines four beams from the VLT\u2019s unit or auxiliary telescopes and can thus provide mid-infrared images (closure-phase aperture synthesis imaging) down to an angular resolution of about 3 mas in L band. Images are now routinely produced. Even in the case where image reconstruction are not performed through aperture synthesis and a good uv coverage approach, the access to closure phases is of considerable value since they bring new unexplored constraints in this specific wavelength domain.\nThrough the MATISSE project, ESO and our consortium are contributing to the new generation of midinfrared instrumentation becoming available to the astronomical community. MATISSE is an essential piece completing a worldwide ensemble of astronomical instruments. From spectral considerations and regarding the near-infrared domain (NIR), MATISSE extends the operating wavelength range of existing instruments such as PIONIER1 and GRAVITY,2 which are both also sensitive to IR radiation but at a shorter wavelength. Moreover MATISSE complements the (sub)millimetre domain in which high angular resolution observations are covered by the radio interferometer ALMA.3 MATISSE gives access to long baseline lengths compared to the midinfrared interferometric instrument of the Large Binocular Telescope.4 Note that MATISSE is thus a bridge in wavelengths as well as an exploratory path for high angular resolution in its spectral bands. That is of essential importance with the advent of the JWST5 and the installation of METIS, the ELT mid-infrared instrument,6 both of which will operate in the same wavelength domain as MATISSE. In terms of sensitivity, these instruments will have advantages over MATISSE. JWST will benefit from the absence of the atmosphere and low background observing conditions due to its location in space, while METIS will benefit from the large collecting area of the ELT. However, from an imaging point of view, MATISSE has a resolving power 20\u00d7 and 4-5\u00d7 greater than that of the JWST and METIS respectively."

            "heading": "2. OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN INSTRUMENT CHARACTERISTICS",
            "text": "MATISSE operates in three atmospheric transmission windows, the L, M, and N bands of the mid-infrared. It combines four beams coming from either the 4 UTs or the 4 ATs of the VLTI. The offered spectral bands and resolutions are presented in Tab. 1.\nThe MATISSE instrument (Fig. 1) consists of a warm optical system and two cold optical benches (COBs) housed in two separate cryostats, one for the L-M band, and one for the N band. The WOP operates at an ambient temperature. It is fed by four beams from the VLTI, which are propagated via dichroic beam splitters to the two COBs (Fig.2).\nThe MATISSE instrument contains several specific functions of importance :\n- the Beam Commuting Device(s): MATISSE features a specific module called Beam Commuting Device (BCD), to calibrate closure and differential phases. Two BCDs are installed at the entrance of MATISSE, one for each pair of beams. By commuting beams 1 and 2, and/or 3 and 4, we invert all the phase contributions before the instrument BCD (i.e., including the contributions of the astrophysical source, the atmosphere, and the VLTI beam trains) while keeping the instrumental contributions after the BCD device fixed. By commuting the beams, 2 differential phases and the 4 closure phases of the astrophysical object can be obtained independently of the phase produced by the instrument but not by the VLTI beam train or the atmosphere. On the closure phase, the BCDs allow a reduction of the phase residuals from several degrees to less than one degree.\n- the OPD modulator(s): The thermal background contribution is huge in the mid-infrared and dominates the astrophysical signal by several orders of magnitude in N-band. In principle, it only affects the low-frequency peak of the Fourier Transform of the interferogram. However, the finite detector window and spatial variations of the detector gain can induce a crosstalk between the different peaks. Therefore, the high-frequency peaks (i.e. the fringe peaks) may be contaminated by the thermal background emission. To reduce such a contamination , a temporal modulation is performed. This modulation consists in applying an artificial Optical Path Difference (OPD) to each fringe signal with a periodic sequence during the atmospheric coherence time. It is a generalisation of the natural 0-\u03c0 scheme existing with a co-axial combination. This function is provided by a set of piezo actuators. The modulation is made in ten steps of \u03bb /10 during the coherence time in which the background remains almost constant. The resulting 10 signals are then numerically re-phased and summed. The lower frequency peak, which is not affected by the OPD modulation, and its contamination to the adjacent fringe\npeaks is then eliminated and only the high frequency peaks remain.\n- the beam shaper and combiner: The MATISSE beam combination is multi-axial. All the telescope beams are mixed together to produce a common interference pattern. A non-redundant beam configuration arrangement with separations between beams, respectively equal to 3D, 9D, and 6D (where D is the beam diameter), allows the fringe peaks to be separated in the Fourier space. It produces dispersed fringes on two different detectors simultaneously, the HAWAII-2RG from Teledyne Technologies for the L&M bands, and the AQUARIUS from Raytheon Company for the N band.\nIn the L band, the detector integration time is driven by the seeing coherence time or by the fringe tracking time (if an external fringe tracker is used). In the N band, it is driven by the high thermal background level, which imposes the individual detector integration time to be short enough to avoid saturation. Indeed the maximum exposure time in N is less than 30 ms while in L, several seconds of integration time are allowed.\nThe instrument has been available in open time since April 2019. Its integration at Paranal took place from November 2017 to February 2018. A two-year commissioning period followed and allowed for the instrument performance to be assessed in all modes with ATs and UTs, and within an upgraded VLTI infrastructure7 involving the implementation of the ATs\u2019 adaptive optics, NAOMI,8 and of the fringe tracker mode, GRA4MAT (Woillez et al. in preparation)."

            "text": "MATISSE is a highly sensitive spectro-interferometer9 which benefits from the large telescope apertures of the VLT. The ATs and the UTs are large-sized telescopes when compared to other worldwide interferometric array. This is important for mid-infrared observations which requires strong source signal at the detector level to beat the photons and background fluctuation noise generated in this spectral domain by both the atmosphere and the optical train emission.\nThe different contributions to the errors, which affect the measurements, are:\n\u2022 The fundamental noise errors that affect the precision of all measurements.\n\u2022 The broad-band seeing errors that affect the absolute visibility and closure phase independently from the source brightness.\n\u2022 The broad-band photometric errors likely caused by imperfect thermal background subtraction, which produce a source flux dependent error in the absolute visibilities.\n\u2022 The group delay estimation error that introduces a bias on the coherent flux, in the case of coherent integration, for faint targets.\n\u2022 The chromatic OPD that has a strong impact on the differential phase\nTables 2 and 3 combine all these error sources and shows our updated estimates without fringe tracking recently reassessed considering the recent and final results of the commissioning.

            "heading": "4. A SELECTION OF RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESULTS",
            "text": "MATISSE was designed as a successor to MIDI, a prolific instrument which produced numerous results on protoplanetary disks, AGNs, and evolved stars. Beyond its huge success, MIDI was nevertheless limited to two telescopes. Going from a two-beam to a four-beam combiner increases the number of simultaneous visibility measurements by a factor 6 and gives access to closure phase measurements. Moreover, MATISSE also opens two new spectral windows at VLTI, the L and M bands, filling the gap of the first generation VLTI instruments. Its very extended spectral domain allows to probe dust, from the sublimation temperature down to about 200K, and free-free emission from hot gas. Moreover, by using its various spectral resolutions, solid-state features, molecular bands and atomic lines can be spectrally resolved, allowing to spatially disentangle gas and dust emissions, constrain their physics, infer the dust mineralogy and even probe the gas kinematics.\nIn Fig. 3 we present three of the first reconstructed images from MATISSE: the circumstellar disk around the unclassified B[e] star FS CMa,10 the dusty torus around the AGN NGC1068,11 and the spectro-imaging in the Br\u03b1 emission line of the wind collision zone around the massive binary star \u03b7 Car.12 These images not only demonstrate the capability of MATISSE to image environment at a few milli-arcseconds resolution, but also its ability to produce spectrally-resolved images either in a large spectral domain (from 3 to 13 \u00b5m) in the case of FS CMa and NGC1068 or at a resolution high enough to study kinematics in spectral lines in the case of \u03b7 Car (R\u22731000).\nThanks to it high spatial resolution MATISSE can access the decisive mas scale, which translates to the pc at the typical distance of the closest AGNs (\u223c Mpc). As shown by the image of NGC1068 presented in Fig 3 but also by the one on Circinus published in 13 , MATISSE can image the inner dust structure in AGNs and challenge the simple \u2019dust torus\u2019 model of the AGN unified model. That model is supposedly edge-on and hiding the central source in type-II AGNs while it is face-on and dominated by the inner dust sublimation radius in type-I AGNs. Clumpy structures with important polar extensions are expected to trace the dusty wind driven by radiation pressure in the brightest AGNs14 . The 2-telescope MIDI instrument was unable to make images and could only give angular sizes as a function of the position angle. It was limited to the N band where it is difficult to discriminate the effects of the temperature and composition of the emitting dust from the foreground absorbing medium. MATISSE solves these two problems by making images in the N band where dust emission dominates. The inner dust structure in AGN is the tracer of the exchanges between the central engine, its surrounding broad line region (BLR), and the host galaxy. Observing it down to the pc scale can reveal the mechanisms of co-evolution of the super massive black holes and galaxies. Moreover, understanding the geometry of the nuclei well can allow independent distance estimates in combination with infrared (IR) reverberation mapping15 . Finally, the recent breakthrough made by GRAVITY on the spectro-astrometry of BLRs16 makes this MATISSE information of an even higher value.\nIn the case of YSOs and protoplanetary disks, reaching the mas scale in the mid-infrared allows to probe au or even sub-au scale for the closest star-forming regions (\u223c 150 pc). Notably, accessing that spatial scale is required to resolve the water ice line in disks, which is thought to represent the outer boundary of the telluric planet forming region. In addition, mapping disks at such a spatial scale could allow to detect au-scale gaps or radial-inhomogeneties that could be linked to planet formation. A survey is being conducted by the MATISSE consortium and more than 60 young stars have been observed as of July 2022. one example of star observed in the frame of this survey is the Herbig Ae star HD16329617 . MATISSE obser-\nvations revealed a significant brightness asymmetry in the L-band emission at a very small scale, i.e., 0.33\u00b10.01 au. The authors proposed that this asymmetric structure, located in or near the inner rim of the dusty disk, orbits the star. To find the physical origin of the asymmetry, they tested the hypothesis of a vortex created by a Rossby wave instability. They found that a unique large-scale vortex is compatible with the MATISSE data. Such vortices are typically proposed as a mechanism to trap dust particles and facilitate planetesimal growth in proto-planetary discs. Another important matter regarding YSOs is to trace carbon in their protoplanetary disks. While detected in the outer disk regions, little is known about the solid carbon species in the inner disk regions and key questions are whether there is a significant reservoir of C-based solid species in the inner 10 au region of disks, in what form are those C-based species and how can solid carbon be incorporated into planetesimals and ultimately planets. Thanks to its large wavelength coverage (3-13\u00b5m) and using its medium spectral resolution mode (R>500) MATISSE can study various carbonaceous molecules and nanograins (PAHs, nano-diamonds, CO) down to the sub-au scale. In18 , MATISSE observations allowed to detect the presence of two separated carbonaceous dust populations in the disk around the Herbig star HD179218: very hot nano-grains that dominate the near-to mid-IR emission in the inner optically thin 10 au region and colder and larger grains that dominate the emission outward. The survival of nano-grains in the highly irradiated inner 10 au region brings new insights in the different photo-induced processes acting on such small grains, and their regeneration/replenishment: accretion could maintain a significant inflow of material to maintain a stable nano-grain population there as well as local photo-fragmentation of larger carbonaceous grains.\nIn parallel to the two main drivers that are YSOs and AGNs, MATISSE has started to produce many results in the field of evolved stars. MATISSE can image dusty and gaseous circumstellar environments around hot stars such as the ones presented in 3 but it can also probe the surface of giant and supergiants stars as shown in19 in the case of the enigmatic evolved star VX Sgr. In that case MATISSE observations allowed to reconstruct multi-band images of the stellar surface and compare them to outputs from radiative transfer models of both RSG and AGB star, showing that this object belong most likely to the later class of objects. Another example is the case of the AGB star R Scl. By modeling its extended atmosphere,20 managed to disentangle the emission from different chemical species (acetylene, Hydrogen cyanide, and amorphous carbon and silicon carbide dust). They showed that the molecules are located closer to the star than the dust, as shown in Fig 4, which presents the spectro-radial profiles of R Scl derived from the MATISSE data. Such pioneering work will help to improve our understanding of the chemical process aroung AGBs star and dust formation."

            "text": "The MATISSE instrument is now routinely operating at Paranal for science observations and will soon become officially property of ESO. Indeed, the PAC (Provisional Acceptance in Chile) phase, which represents the final delivery step of the Consortium, is being concluded. Beyond the PAC, the already engaged commissioning activity on GRA4MAT will be pursued during 2022 and future upgrades are foreseen. They concern the MATISSE-Wide mode, which is the use of GRAVITY as a wide field-of-view off-axis fringe tracker for MATISSE, and the proposition of a new generation fringe tracking of the HFT-type (Petrov et al. 2022, this conference). The MATISSE-wide upgrade consists in using the so-called beam B for MATISSE and IRIS while the set of beam A are used to feed GRA4MAT (see Figure 5). The proposition of a new generation fringe tracking of the HFT-type consists in developing a dedicated fringe tracker for MATISSE and the VLTI. This was foreseen years ago by ESO at the beginning of the MATISSE Phase A. Such a new development would be to take advantage of the state-of-Art knowledge in this field by using in particular several spectral bands in once to fringe sense with the highest performance the signal (Petrov et al. 2022, this conference).\nThese upgrades are science driven by a major case which is the access to a much larger number of AGNs and Quasars21 through a multispectral approach at the VLTI. The mid-infrared domain covered by MATISSE offers crucial constraints to determine temperature maps and morphologies, and will contribute in particular by this mean to better constraints on the distance estimates through reverberation mapping methods. It is the\ncombination of off-axis tracking through MATISSE-Wide and fringe sensing sensitivity that will deeply enlarge the studied AGN sample as demonstrated by Petrov (2022).\nThrough the MATISSE-wide upgrade, it is not only MATISSE perfomance which will be improved for faint object observations but it is globally the VLTI multi-spectral capability which will be increased to an homogeneous level allowing the community to continue to use the ensemble of instruments PIONIER, GRAVITY and MATISSE for the multi-spectral analysis of the individual sources."
