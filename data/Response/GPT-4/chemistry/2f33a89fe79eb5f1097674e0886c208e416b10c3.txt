Exploration of Bioactive Compounds in Underutilized Tissues: While the study primarily focused on the major tissues of LJT, identifying bioactive compounds in underutilized tissues could reveal new pharmacological potentials. Future research could investigate root, bark, or seed metabolites of LJT to discover unique compounds with medicinal properties, possibly expanding the utility of this plant in traditional and modern medicine.

Pharmacological Studies of Newly Identified Compounds: The discovery of four new secondary metabolites in the study opens avenues for detailed pharmacological research to understand their bioactivities. Investigating these compounds for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, or anticancer properties could contribute to the development of new drugs or supplements.

Genetic and Environmental Influences on Metabolite Profiles: Investigating how genetic variation among LJT strains and environmental factors (such as soil composition, climate, and cultivation practices) influence the metabolite profiles of different tissues could lead to optimized cultivation techniques for enhancing the production of specific beneficial metabolites.

Mechanistic Studies on Metabolite Biosynthesis: The study highlighted differential metabolite accumulation in various tissues of LJT. Future research could focus on the enzymatic pathways and genetic regulation involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of these metabolites. Understanding these mechanisms could enable targeted manipulation to enhance the production of specific compounds.

Development of Tissue-specific Extracts for Diverse Applications: Considering the unique metabolite profiles of flowers, flower buds, leaves, and stems, there is potential for developing tissue-specific extracts or formulations. These could be tailored for specific health benefits, such as skincare products from flavone-rich leaf extracts or anti-inflammatory supplements from iridoid-rich flower extracts. Further research could explore the efficacy, safety, and application methods of such formulations.
