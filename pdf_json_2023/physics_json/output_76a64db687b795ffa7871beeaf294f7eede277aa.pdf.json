    "abstractText": "Recent research on the use of physical mixtures In2O3-ZrO2 has raised interesting questions as to how their combination enhances catalytic activity and selectivity. Specifically, the relationship between oxygen diffusion and defect formation and the epitaxial tension in the mixture should be further investigated. In this study, we aim to clarify some of these relationships through a molecular dynamics approach. Various potentials for the two oxides are compared and selected to describe the physical mixture of In2O3 and ZrO2. Different configurations of each single crystal and their physical mixture are simulated, and oxygen defect formation and diffusion are measured and compared. Significant oxygen defect formation is found in both crystals. In2O3 seems to be stabilized by the mixture, while ZrO2 is destabilized. Similar results were found for the ZrO2 doping with In and ln2O3 doping with Zr. The results explain the high activity and selectivity catalyst activity of the mixture for the production of isobutylene from ethanol.",

            "text": "Indium oxide is a versatile material that arouses interest in several applications, such as optoelectronics [1] and catalysis [2,3]. Recent researches have shown that the interest in this material for catalysis is due partially to the strong capacity of the cubic phase of In2O3 to form oxygen vacancies, especially in the presence of monoclinic ZrO2 [4\u20137]. The causes of this phenomenon are still not well understood and have been the target of theoretical and experimental studies for its elucidation. These materials seem to form an epitaxial alignment that favor defects\u2019 formation, such as. oxygen vacancies, providing an interesting catalytic behavior [6,7]. Further, the oxygen dynamics of ZrO2 and In2O3 favor some reactions of industrial interest, like the syntheses of isobutene and acetone from ethanol [5,6] and also methanol and methane from CO2 [8,9]. These reactions depend on the oxygen lattice mobility, according to the Mars Van Krevelen mechanism [10]. The optimization and development of new In2O3 catalysts depend on understanding the phenomenon of point defects formation and mobility. In this sense, computer simulations help predict the behavior and properties of these materials. [11] Some authors have used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate the morphology and stability of different faces of cubic In2O3 [12,13]. Walsh et al. [14] found that the stability of In2O3 surfaces can be described in the following order: (111) > (110) > (100). In addition, Zhang et al. [13] verified that the face (111) of In2O3 presents greater stability under oxidizing conditions, while the face (100) is more stable under oxygen-lean conditions. Through theoretical and experimental study, Ziemba et al. [15] used DFT calculations to simulate experimental Raman results and investigate the oxygen dynamics for cubic In2O3 under oxidizing and reducing conditions. From the calculations, they determined that the energy of formation\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2426. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032426 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2426 2 of 18\nof an oxygen vacancy in the bulk of an In2O3 unit cell was 3.40 eV, consistent with the values found in the literature [1,16]. In this study, the authors found that, under reducing conditions at temperatures above 120 \u25e6C, oxygen migrates from the bulk to the surface until it reaches an equilibrium condition, which is more favorable than maintaining oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide [15]. N\u00f8rskov et al. [17] calculated the energy of formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface (111) of In2O3 considering a supported catalyst model represented by In2O3 (111) layers on ZrO2 (111). The thickness of the In2O3 layer was varied (from 5 to 2 layers) to simulate different conditions of dispersion of In2O3 on the support. They found that reducing the In2O3 layer thickness increased the formation energy for oxygen vacancies, suggesting that increasing this oxide dispersion makes defect formation more difficult. For the more dispersed model (2 layers), the vacancy formation energy was 0 eV, while for the 5-layer model, the calculated value was \u22120.1 eV. The small vacancy formation energies show a relative stabilization of the In2O3 lattice in the physical mixture, resulting in a minor defect formation and a higher oxygen diffusion activation energy. Molecular dynamics also contributed to the understanding and better description of materials but used empirical interatomic potentials to describe the structure of pure cubic In2O3 [1] or doped with elements as Sn [18,19]. Such potentials have often been used in molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the formation of defects as vacancies, Frenkel and Schottky [16,19,20], and to assess the stability of different faces of cubic In2O3 [14]. Warschkow et al. [18] proposed a Buckingham potential for In2O3, based on studies by Bush et al. [21]. Although this potential could provide adequate values for the structural properties of cubic In2O3, it barely fitted the dielectric parameters. Walsh et al. [1] reported a more accurate potential that simulates both the structural and physical properties of the material. Furthermore, such potential proved adequate for studies of intrinsic defects such as vacancies, Schottky, and Frenkel in this oxide. Recently, Hou et al. [19] developed a set of paired interatomic potentials, combining Buckingham, Lennard-Jones, Polynomial, Polynomial Harmonic Potentials, and Shell models. This new potential proved accurate to simulate structural and physical properties and understand the properties resulting from the formation of defects in the oxide. For ZrO2, most reported interatomic potentials are more appropriate for cubic or tetragonal phases and may present some deviations when used for simulations involving the monoclinic phase. Schelling et al. [22] developed a Buckingham potential to investigate the phenomenon of transition from cubic and tetragonal phases to cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Kilo et al. [23] investigated oxygen diffusion in the same material over a finite temperature range, modifying the literature\u2019s potentials. Lau & Dunlap [24] used diluted concentrations of Y2O3 in ZrO2 and described a suitable potential for the temperature range of 300\u20131400 K, using the rigid ion model approximation. Through a different line of study, Duin et al. [25] developed a ReaxFF reactive force field to search into the intergranular diffusion of perovskites like Y-doped BaZrO3 (BYZ). Despite these studies, there is not enough literature describing the interaction of In2O3 with ZrO2 based on molecular dynamics. Therefore, some questions are raised: would it be possible to use these potentials to describe the behavior of In2O3 and ZrO2 catalysts? Furthermore, how the presence of ZrO2 could affect the stability and oxygen mobility of In2O3? This work uses molecular dynamics and empirical potentials to evaluate the interaction between In2O3 and ZrO2 oxides in proximity, the defect formation in the In2O3 oxide, and the diffusion of ionic species in mixtures of these oxides. The present results are discussed considering the known catalytic properties of the In2O3/ZrO2 system and its effectiveness in catalyzing the isobutylene synthesis from ethanol.\nInt. J. Mol.

The input files with the atomic positions for the rigid ion framework were obtained through a Python code using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) library [28]. A simple Python algorithm produced the input files with the atomic positions for the core-shell framework from the rigid ion files. Preliminary experiments were conducted on two existing potentials to determine which better describes the crystal. Furthermore, for each potential, a rigid ion and a core-shell case were investigated to check for a significant variation. These experiments consisted of building a lattice parameter versus energy graph for each potential choice using a 4\u00d7 4\u00d7 4 In2O3 supercell. Runs for different lattice parameters were performed in NVT ensembles at room temperature for 4 ps using 0.2 fs time steps. The resultant medium potential energy per atom was registered (Figure S1). After that, a third-degree polynomial equation was fitted to the simulated points to help identify the local minimum which corresponds to the equilibrium lattice parameter.

For defective ZrO2 experiments, Schottky defects, Frenkel defects, oxygen vacancies, and substitutional defects with In atoms occupying Zr sites. For each defect, input files representing different initial conditions were prepared using the ASE library.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2426 5 of 18\nA 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 supercell was used to investigate defects in In2O3. 13 Schottky defects were created by adding 26 In vacancies and 39 O vacancies to the base supercell. For Frenkel defects, 65 oxygen Frenkel defects were added to the supercell. Sixty-five oxygen atoms were eliminated from the supercell for pure oxygen vacancy defects. So the total number of vacancies was always 65, which is 3% of the total number of atoms in the perfect crystal. The effect of Zr doping in the In2O3 crystal was investigated with two different files containing Zr doped In2O3. One had 78 Zr atoms, and another had 195 Zr atoms, substituted at random 8a In positions, as this is the indium atom site with the lowest vacancy formation energy. Vacancies for indium atoms were generated to equilibrate the crystals\u2019 charge. Thus, the files with 78 Zr atoms contained the same number of In vacancies of the Schottky defect file, 26; and the files with 195 Zr atoms contained the same number of total vacancies of the Schottky defect file 65. Similar files were generated to investigate defects on ZrO2 using a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 base supercell. So to create 15 Schottky defects, 15 Zr vacancies and 30 O vacancies were created in the base supercell. For Frenkel defects, 45 oxygen Frenkel defects were added to the supercell. For pure oxygen vacancies, 45 oxygen atoms were taken from the supercell. So for each defect type, the total number of vacancies was 45, that is, 3% of the total number of atoms in the perfect crystal. The effect of In doping in the ZrO2 crystal was investigated with two different files containing In using the 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 base supercell. One had 60 In atoms, and another had 90 In atoms, substituted at random Zr positions, as this crystal only possesses one type of site for Zr atoms. Vacancies for oxygen atoms were generated to equilibrate the crystals\u2019 charge. Thus, the files with 60 In atoms contained the same number of oxygen vacancies of the Schottky defect file, 30; and the files with 90 In atoms contained the same number of total vacancies of the Schottky defect file, 45. The defective crystals were built using the rigid model allowing an easier integration between different potentials.

For Frenkel defects, it was observed that interstitial atoms tended\nto recombine with vacancies during the equilibration run. This way, by the time the meas-\nurement was done, there were significantly fewer Frenkel defects, and the crystal was\nalmost perfect, thus making diffusion more difficult.\nTable 6.

            "text": "Table 6 shows the activation energy for oxygen diffusion considering different defects in both crystals. First, oxygen exhibits higher diffusion activation energy in ZrO2 for all intrinsic defects, probably due to the smaller interstitial size in this crystal. It is also observed that the diffusion activation energy increases following the same sequence of intrinsic defects for both the zirconia and indium oxide. Schottky has the lowest energy, followed by Frenkel and oxygen vacancies. To understand this phenomenon, OVITO was used. It was found that oxygen vacancies tended to distribut th mselves symmetrically due to their ffective repelling charges, which seem to stabilize the lattice and prevent diffusion to an extent. For Frenkel defects, it was observed that interstitial atoms tended to recombine with vacancies during the equilibration run. This way, by the time the measurement was done, there were significantly fewer Frenkel defects, and the crystal was almost perfect, thus making diffusion more difficult.\nTable 6.

            "text": "Table 8 shows the oxygen diffusion activation energy with positive values for all attempted combinations. The mean square displacement of cations was very low, and for this reason, their diffusion activation energies were not calculated (Figure S3). It should also be noted that some calculations have near-zero or even negative oxygen diffusion activation energies due to the very low diffusivity (Figures S4 and S5). It is believed that the computation time was too short or the temperature too low.\nTable 8 presents interesting trends. In all physical mixtures, the activation energy for oxygen diffusion in no-defects indium oxide was greater than the value observed for the 3% Schottky non-mixture In2O3 crystal (Table 6). The physical mixture shows the same qualitative effect on oxygen diffusion activation energy as the doping of these oxides with one another\u2014ZrO2 elevates oxygen activation energy in In2O3, and In2O3 lowers the oxygen activation energy in ZrO2. The activation energy for oxygen diffusion in no-defect zirconia in the physical mixture was lower than for all intrinsic defects in non-mixture ZrO2. However, the lowest energy for all ZrO2 oxygens was still found for the case of substitutional indium defects in a non-mixture ZrO2 crystal, which points to an important result. The mechanical, physical mixtures with the associate epitaxial piling of the ZrO2 and In2O3 nanocrystals affect oxygen diffusion equivalent to a doping process. It results from either small doping at the two materials interface or, most probably, the lattice tensions caused by the epitaxy between the two crystals. Yamamoto et al. [41] observed from DFT calculations that compressive stress caused a reduction in the oxygen diffusion coefficient in monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2. These lattice tensions are illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, which show how the interaction between crystals creates patterns of potential energies. For the In2O3 crystal, it seems these tensions stabilize oxygen atoms, inhibiting their diffusion even more than doping with zirconium, which agrees with the calculations from\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2426 14 of 18\nN\u00f8rskov et al. [17], that showed that oxygen vacancy formation energy is elevated in In2O3 by its contact with ZrO2. For ZrO2, the effect seems to be destabilization of the atom, although doping with indium still stimulates diffusion more significantly. Int. J. Mol.

It should also be noted that defect formation was disproportionately higher in ZrO2 in the cases where it was not the substrate crystal compared to In2O3 when it was not the substrate crystal. So, even if the stabilization effect of the periodic boundary is important, the interaction between ZrO2 and In2O3 plays a major role in promoting or limiting defect formation. More specifically, the interaction promotes more oxygen vacancies for the ZrO2 lattice more than for the In2O3. These results are in contrast to experimental evidence [5,7]. Nonetheless, the studies that yielded this experimental evidence used a much smaller weight ratio of indium to zirconium oxide when preparing their catalysts than the weight ratio of the simulated physical mixtures. Although the diffusion of cations was not high enough to allow calculation of its activation energies, it was high enough to be detected by a simple visual inspection in OVITO, as shown in Figure 9. So Zr atoms in In2O3 have been found to stabilize it, thus limiting excessive vacancy formation on its surface [13]. Furthermore, the diffused cations would form a very diluted solution in the other crystal, with a concentration of approximately one in thousands in the receiving crystal, but this could have important implications for catalysis. Catalysts of ZrO2 doped by Zn in similar concentrations have already been found effective in catalyzing isobutylene synthesis from ethanol [42].\nInt. J. Mol.

Besides that, the diffusion of indium atoms to the ZrO2 lattice is significant as the use of doped ZrO2 with another low valence dopant [42,44,45], Zn, has already been proved effective for the isobutylene synthesis from ethanol by acting on the rate-limiting step of the generation of acetone, intermediate of this olefin synthesis, from ethanol) [44,45]. Thus a complete understanding of this cascade reaction could involve both In2O3 and ZrO2 acting on different steps along its way. Nonetheless, the ZrO2-In2O3 system seems to follow the moderation principle suggested by McFarland [46] which states that the oxygen must not be easily removed from the catalyst surface since it would be difficult to have it back and close the Mars Van Krevelen mechanism."

            "text": "The results regarding oxygen diffusion pointed out a distinct pattern whereby the physical mixture of one oxide on another had the same qualitative effect as their doping\u2014 the activation energy for oxygen diffusion was lowered in ZrO2 and became higher in In2O3. This behavior is most likely due to the lattice tensions generated by the epitaxy between the crystals. Further, the modified physical mixture promotes oxygen Frenkel defect formation in both crystals at higher concentrations in the case of the ZrO2 crystal, which confirms the observations from past studies that oxygen vacancies formation is promoted in In2O3 by the presence of ZrO2. The present calculations also indicate the presence of very small cation diffusion between both crystals in the physical mixture, which will change the defect concentration in the indium and zirconium oxides. For the In2O3 crystal in the physical mixture, the present results matched well the vacancy formation, oxygen stabilization, and higher diffusion activation energy. In contrast, for the ZrO2 crystal in the modified physical mixture, higher overall oxygen vacancy formation, the lower activation energy for oxygen diffusion, and the diffusion of indium cations into its structure all pointed to a role not previously considered in the literature for this catalytic system. Furthermore, the changes observed for ZrO2 in our computational analyzes contrasted with some experimental data obtained previously. Indeed, published previous investigations show higher concentrations of ZrO2 than those of this work. Considering that the techniques usually employed in catalyst characterization do not show lateral resolution, it was not possible to observe these ZrO2 changes. Thus, the physical mixture\u2019s role as a catalyst is due to the role of two modified materials and the interactions resulting from the interdiffusion of In2O3 and ZrO2 crystals.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24032426/s1, Figure S1: \u2013 average potential energy per atom vs lattice parameter graph for In2O3 described by Walsh\u2019s rigid ion model; Figure S2: elongation vs difference in temperature for In2O3 described by Walsh\u2019s rigid ion model; Figure S3: MSD over time for indium atoms in the ZrO2(111) over In2O3(111) physical mixture with no initial defects; Figure S4: MSD over time for In2O3 oxygen atoms in the ZrO2(211) over In2O3(111) physical mixture with no initial defects; Figure S5: ln(D) over T-1 for In2O3 oxygen atoms in the ZrO2(211) over In2O3(111) physical mixture with no initial defects.\nAuthor Contributions: L.E.F.: methodology, investigation, validation, formal analysis, writing\u2014 original; B.J.d.S.B.: methodology, investigation, validation, formal analysis, visualization, writing\u2014 review & editing; L.G.A.: conceptualization, writing\u2014review & editing; R.R.d.A.: conceptualization, supervision, funding acquisition, methodology, writing-review & editing.
