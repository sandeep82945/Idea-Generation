1. **Developing LLMs that can understand and respond to medical queries in real-time.** This would allow LLMs to be used as virtual assistants for doctors and nurses, helping them to quickly and accurately answer patient questions.


2. **Training LLMs on large datasets of medical images and videos.** This would enable LLMs to be used for tasks such as diagnosing diseases, detecting abnormalities, and planning treatments.


3. **Developing LLMs that can generate personalized treatment plans for patients.** This would allow LLMs to be used to create tailored treatment plans that take into account a patient's individual needs and preferences.


4. **Exploring the use of LLMs to develop new drugs and therapies.** LLMs could be used to generate new molecules and compounds that could be tested for their potential to treat diseases.


5. **Investigating the use of LLMs to improve patient education and engagement.** LLMs could be used to create interactive and engaging educational materials that can help patients to better understand their conditions and treatments.
