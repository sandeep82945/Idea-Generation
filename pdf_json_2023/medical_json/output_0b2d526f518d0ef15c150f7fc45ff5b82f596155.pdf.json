    "abstractText": "To perform a bibliometric visualization in lipidomics-related research with 10 two decades. The primary data was retrieved from the Web of Science, three sotwares 11 (VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and R) provided an overview of this field. The countries, 12 institutions, authors, key terms, and keywords were tracked and corresponding 13 mapping was generated. From January 1st in 2001 to March 21th in 2022, 45,325 14 authors from 234 organizations in 101 countries published 7,338 publications in 382 15 journals were found. Journal of Lipid Research was the most productive (284 16 publications) and highly cited journal (18,293 citations). We clustered four keywords 17 themes. The niche theme were shotgun lipidomics, tandem mass-spectrometry, and 18 electrospray-ionization. The motor theme were expression, diseases, and 19 inflammation. The emerging or decling theme were identification, mass-spectrometry, 20 and fatty acids.The basic theme were metabolism, cell, and plasma. Though eight 21 All rights reserved.

The primary data was retrieved from the Web of Science, three sotwares 11 (VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and R) provided an overview of this field. The countries, 12 institutions, authors, key terms, and keywords were tracked and corresponding 13 mapping was generated.

Journal of Lipid Research was the most productive (284 16 publications) and highly cited journal (18,293 citations). We clustered four keywords 17 themes. The niche theme were shotgun lipidomics, tandem mass-spectrometry, and 18 electrospray-ionization. The motor theme were expression, diseases, and 19 inflammation. The emerging or decling theme were identification, mass-spectrometry, 20 and fatty acids.The basic theme were metabolism, cell, and plasma. Though eight 21\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction 32 Lipidomics aims to systematically analyze the alteration in lipid composition and 33 expression of various organisms, which can effectively reveal the changes and 34 functions of various biological processes, such as energy metabolism (Moellering and 35 Cravatt, 2013), inflammation, and immunity (Que et al., 2018). Though put forward 36 earlier, the concept of lipidomics was widely accepted because of Prof. Xian-Lin Han 37 (Han and Gross, 2003) until 2003, it has received increasing attention in numerous 38 fields in the past two decades. As a crucial branch of metabolomics, lipidomics was 39 certified to play an indispensable role to maintain the balance of the individual. 40 Especially in the health field, lipidomics has been widely applied in the study of 41 diverse diseases, such as kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2016), immunological diseases 42\nAll rights reserved.

Furthermore, with or without unsaturated hydrocarbon 52 chains, lipids can be divided into unsaturated or saturated lipids (Williams et al., 53 1966). Because of the multiple-type of structures and increasing publications of 54 lipidomics, it is hardly to generate a panoramic assessment of this field. A manual 55 compilation and systematic review of all the publications in this field would be, if not 56 impossible, time-consuming. With the surged research and complicated composition 57 of lipids during the past two decades, it is necessary to portray the character of these 58 articles to further summarize the trends at present and possible concerns in the future. 59 Bibliometric analysis has been used to process the above-mentioned problems in 60 other disciplines. Most bibliometric computational and visual analytic approaches are 61 automated and thus suitable for analyzing tremendous amounts of literature on broad 62 and various topics.

Unlike traditional citation counts, bibliometrics 65 considers connections among literatures, enabling the identification of intellectual 66 structures and emerging trends (Raghupathi and Nerur, 2008). Bibliometrics identifies 67 relevant nodes and extracts useful information from a large amount of information 68 (Zhang et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2021) and promotes researchers a better 69 understanding of the emerging trends and knowledge structure in the temporal cross-70 section of a research field (Dong et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020). 71 Although a lot of bibliometric software is used, including CiteSpace (Liang et al., 72 2017; Chen et al., 2019), VOSviewer (van Eck and Waltman, 2010), bibExcel 73 (Shamsi et al., 2020), Science of Science (Wu et al., 2022), and HistCite (Li et al., 74 2022), CiteSpace and VOSviewer are the most frequently applied software. CiteSpace 75 (Chen, 2020) is a freely available Java application designed by Professor Chao-Mei 76 Chen that aims to detect new trends and mutations in scientific literatures. VOSviewer 77 (van Eck and Waltman, 2010) was created by the Centre for Science and Technology 78 Studies of Leiden University and provided visually better pictures compared with 79 CiteSpace. Bibliometrics usually focuses not only on the current trends, but also on 80 the hotspots in the future (Lim et al., 2021). Therefore. bibliometrics is quite suitable 81 for objective academic evaluation that is conducive to evaluating the academic impact 82 of lipidomics. 83 This study aims to integrate bibliometric approaches to analyze the literatures on 84\nAll rights reserved.

To the best of our knowledge, 85 this is the first bibliometric analysis in this field. Our findings will offer a 86 comprehensive overview of this field and highlight its intellectual structures with 87 emerging trends. The revelation of journal preferences may help researchers choose 88 appropriate journals. Furthermore, highlighting the strengths of the institutions in this 89 field may help researchers make career-related decisions. Moreover, the discovery of 90 emerging trends may help the researchers determine the direction of their studies. 91 2. Materials and methods 92 2.1. Bibliographic records 93 Briefly, the publication data were performed on March 21th in 2022, and 94 downloaded as a \"Plain text file\" with full record and cited reference from the Web of 95 Science Core Collection (WOScc). The retrieval strategies and data collection process 96 need to meet the following criteria: 97 1) the search strategy was guided by the TS (\"topic\" including title, abstract, 98 author's keywords, and keywords Plus) as (((TS=(Lipidomics)) OR TS=(Lipidomic)) 99\nOR TS=(Lipidome)) OR TS=(Lipidomes); 100 2) the document type was \"article\"; 101 3) the publication deadline was March 21, 2022; 102 4) the following information was collected: publication, authors, Countries, 103 institutions, journals, keywords, and citations. 104 2.2.

In CiteSpace, the \"time-slicing\" was confined to 2001-107 2022 with the \"years per slice\" into \"1\". Furthermore, the node types were classified 108 into Country, institution, source, reference, author, and keywords. The \"top N per 109 slice\" was set as \"50\" which means the 50 documents with the highest cited frequency 110 were selected for each \"time slicing\". In addition, we chose \"pathfinder\" for the 111 network analysis. To better indicate the correlation of the above project, VOSviewer 112 (version1.6.17) was performed for visualization. Finally, R (version 4.1.2) was used to 113 summarize the frequency with the package tableone and portrayed the world 114 distribution of research with packages of ggplot2, ggmap, and maps. And R package 115 biblimotrix was applied into clusterd, thematic evalution, and trend topics analysis. 116 2.3. Research ethics 117 Bibliographic information was searched and downloaded from WOScc (publicly 118 available database). The extraction data of this research did not involve interaction 119 with human subjects or animals. Thus, our study is immune to ethical issues. No 120 approval from an ethics committee was required. 121 122 3. Result 123 3.1.

The workflow of the analysis steps. 129 130\nThe annual distribution (Fig. 2) indicated that lipidomics-related publications 131 were surging during the past two decades. Because of the deadline time constraints, 132 only 176 articles were calculated in 2022, the inclusion of articles in 2022 is not 133 complete and the time distribution did not consider 2022. Although the concept 134 \"lipidomics\" was widely recognized until 2003, still put forward a little earlier. The 135 total time distribution can be divided into two segments. One is the downturn period 136 from 2001 to 2004 with at most 11 articles. Another is the increasing period from 137 2005 to 2021with 44 articles to 1,437 articles, respectively. A trend line (Fig. 2), used 138 to evaluate the imitative effect, indicated that when excluding the incomplete 2022 139 publication, the trend was exponential from 2001 to 2021 and R2 is higher than 0.97. 140 141\nFig. 2.

In the first period (2001-2007), the USA (n = 113) 155 was the most productive Country in lipidomics with a great discrepancy compared 156 with followed England (n = 24) and Germany (n = 18). In the second period (2008-157 2012), the USA (n = 311) was still top 1, following Germany (n = 92) and Finland (n 158 = 55). In the third period (2013-2017), although the USA (n = 300) still was top 1, 159 China (n = 300) replaced Germany (n = 273) in second place. In the fourth period 160 (2018-2022), the USA (n = 1,368) and China (n = 1,162) were still the top 1 and 2, 161 however, the difference was quite small. The top 3 Countries (USA, China, and 162 Germany) contribute 43.99% of total. Although China had a late beginning on 163 lipidomics research, it displayed a surging trend during the four periods. As for the 164 citations, Chinese publications only ranked at fourth, which might be caused by the 165 late beginning. 166 167\nFig. 3. The distribution of Countries/regions and institutions.

The top 10 Countries/regions of distribution in four periods. 172\n173 A total of 234 institutions, which published more than 10 lipidomics-related 174 articles (Table S2), were dominantly derived from the USA, China, and Germany. 175 The articles of these institutions were mainly contributed by universities, followed by 176 hospitals and research laboratories. 177 In the top 20 institutions with the derived Countries (Fig. 3B), USA and China 178 were the majority Countries, followed by Australia, Singapore, Finland, and Portugal. 179 The citations of Harvard University (n = 10,952) were top 1, however the publications 180 (n = 100) were quite less, which emphasized the academic status and influence of 181 Harvard University. Conversely, the publications of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 182 (n = 321) ranked at 1st, while the citations (n = 5,699) were only at 7th, which might 183 be caused by the late beginning of this aera in China. 184 To optimally dynamic demonstrate the institutions with diverse periods, we 185 summarize the top 5 institutions in four periods (Table 2) respectively, including 186 2001-2007, 2008-2012, 2013-2017, and 2018-2022. In the first period (2001-2007), 187 the top 3 institutions were all from the USA, including University of Washington, 188 Harvard University, and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.

Lipidomics prefered categories 278 Although lipidomics was universally classified into eight types, the attention was 279 not received equally. According to LIPID MAPS, we classified the lipidomics-related 280 keywords of minimum 10 counts (Fig. 7A) into 5 categories, Fatty Acyls (n = 1,830), 281 Glycerophospholipids (n = 1,317), Sphingolipids (n = 596), Glycerolipids (n = 178), 282 and Sterol Lipids(n = 342). Fatty Acyls was the most studied batch of lipidomics, 283 followed by Glycerophospholipids. The polyunsaturated fatty (PUFA), arachidonic 284 acid (ARA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were dominant subsets of Fatty Acyls 285 which indicated a crucial focus in lipidomics. In the studies of Glycerophospholipids, 286 the composed cardinal members were phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 287 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The crucial studied members of Sphingolipids, 288 Glycerolipids, and Sterol Lipids were ceramide, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol, 289 respectively. 290 291\nFig. 7.

Lipidomics- favoured diseases 296 According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, 297 https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en), all of these disease-related keywords were 298 categorized into seven brief types (Fig. 7B). We revised several keywords with ICD. 299 For example, we took \u201cinsulin-resistance\u201d and \u201cinsulin resistance\u201d into a type. And 300 the majority of lipidomics-related diseases were insulin resistance (n = 406), followed 301 by obesity (n = 240), Alzheimer's disease (n = 200), and cancer (n = 169). Metabolic 302 diseases (n = 908) were the most frequent lipidomics-related disease, followed by 303 diseases of the circulatory system (n = 480). 304 3.5.3. Lipidomics- favoured tissues 305 Lipidomics-related researches mainly focus on 22 tissue (Fig. 7C). Plasma (n = 306 341) was the most conventional tissue for the extraction of lipid, followed by brain (n 307 = 229), adipose tissue (n = 200), serum (n = 153), and liver (n = 138). Plasma was the 308 pervasive tissue for lipidomics extraction, however specific tissue would be utilized in 309 a specific disease. For example, white matter in the brain is lipid-rich tissue which 310 was a target for lipid research (Smith et al., 2022), especially in Alzheimer's disease 311 (Xu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a). 312 3.5.4.

Furthermore, the most 319 strength burst keyword was the \u201cbiological sample\u201d with a strength of 47.53. In 320 addition, a dotted line box (Fig. 7A) embraced two keywords in recent times, \u201cwomen\u201d 321 and \u201cpregnancy\u201d. Both keywords burst in 2020 with the strength of 8.91 and 7.1, 322 which forecast the potential hot topics in the future. 323 324 4. Disccusion 325 4.1. Global trends in lipidomics 326 Since Kishimoto et, al. (Kishimoto et al., 2001) firstly reported lipidomics-327 related publication in 2001, which developed a nondestructive quantification of 328 neutral lipids with thin-layer chromatography, the lipidomics research had no waves 329 in the following 2 years. Until Han et, al. (Han and Gross, 2003) in 2003 processed 330 ESI mass spectrometry for the bridge of lipidomics, in which lipidomics cached the 331 increasing eyes of scholars. Different from other bibliometrics research (Contreras-332 Barraza et al., 2021) with acute fluctuations or step-down latency (Xu et al., 2017), 333 the lipidomics-related publications were sustainable surging annually. At present, 334 lipidomics-related research is exponential surging (Fig. 2) which indicated more and 335 more (Wenk, 2010) attention was paid. A total of 100 Countries were involved in 336 lipidomics-related publications, and 38 Countries with more than 20 published articles 337\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The top 3 Countries (USA, China, and Germany) contribute 43.99% of all 338 Countries. China had a late beginning of lipidomics compared with other Countries, 339 but a surprising increase during the 2 decades. Chinese Academy of Sciences was the 340 most productive Country. Among the 382 journals, Journal of Lipid Research was the 341 most productive (Table 3) and the most highly cited journal. Prof. Xian-Lin Han was 342 the most productive author with 146 publications. 343 4.2. The preferred categories of lipidomics 344 According to LIPID MAPS, lipidomics was universally classified into 8 345 categories, but only 5 types (fatty acyls, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, 346 glycerolipids, sterol lipids) often catch the studies of publications. Especially Fatty 347 Acyls and Glycerophospholipids seem to get a preference of records (Fig. 7A). 348 In deeply, the preferred studied subsets of fatty acyls was PUFA. Fatty acids are 349 the most abundant lipid in the body and the major endogenous energy source 350\n(Malaisse et al., 1983). The \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 PUFA are both major types of PUFA that 351 play an indispensable role in normal human health (Jump, 2002). DHA was a type of 352 PUFA, and PUFA was identified to prevent the incidence of cardiovascular and 353 cerebrovascular diseases (Iso et al., 2001; Str\u00f8m et al., 2012). Two system reviews 354\n(Enns et al., 2014; Abdelhamid et al., 2018) emphasized that \u03c9-3 PUFA has little or 355 no effect on the arterial disease with cardiovascular events and other serious clinical 356 outcomes. The above research just focused on the PUFA in plasma or serum. Ding D 357 et, al. (Ding et al., 2020) transform the attention to erythrocyte lipid indicated a 358\nAll rights reserved.

Anna LP et, al. (Petursdottir et al., 2008) identified that the absence of 361\n\u03c9-3 PUFA is highly associated with memory loss and diminished cognitive function 362 with tryptophan metabolism (Morgese et al., 2020), such as Alzheimer's disease 363 (Morgese et al., 2020), dementia (Wang et al., 2021), and sleep disorders (Decoeur et 364 al., 2020). The other type of fatty acid studied preferred was ARA which fulfills 365 several physiological functions: compose the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes, 366 perform a precursor for a crucial category of biologically such as eicosanoids, 367 regulate gene expression, mediate inflammation, and balance vasodilator or 368 vasoconstrictor (Imig, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Badimon et al., 2021). In a word, 369 Fatty Acyls was the current hot type, especially its subtypes PUFA, DHA, and ARA. 370 Glycerophospholipids were the second preferred category of lipidomics, 371 especially in PC and PE. Phospholipid, a generic term not a specific type of 372 Glycerophospholipids, compose an important component of the cell membrane and 373 plays an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis. In animals, lecithin or PC is 374 the most abundant, followed by PE (also called cerebral phospholipid). PC, as 80% 375 of major phospholipids, is the surfactant lipid of the lung to maintain alveolar surface 376 tension. The metabolism of PC is associated with cholesterol. Eleni AK et, al (Karavia 377 et al., 2013) indicated that PC/cholesterol acyltransferase activity is an important 378 modulator of processes associated with diet-induced hepatic lipid deposition.

And PC is the major phospholipid comprising 80% of surfactant lipids 381 (Middlekauff et al., 2020) and smoking may down-regulate the content of PC for the 382 progress of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Agudelo et al., 2020). PE is the 383 second composition of cell members in humans, enrich in brian or nervous tissue 384 (Karik\u00f3 et al., 2001). 385 Above all, fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids are the preferred categories of 386 lipidomics, compared with the other 6 types, which indicated a current trend, 387 especially in the subsets of PUFA, ARA, DHA, PC, and PE. Furthermore, ceramide 388 and cholesterol are also popular in research (Fig. 7A). 389 4.3. The lipidomics- favoured diseases 390 According to the ICD, the keywords of more than 10 frequencies were 391 summarized and the lipidomics-related diseases were categorized into 7 types (Fig. 392 7B). Insulin resistance, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease were the most representative 393 of endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases, diseases of the circulatory system, and 394 diseases of the nervous system. 395 Insulin resistance is a typical clinical manifestation and one of the criteria for 396 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes (Mojiminiyi et al., 2007) that most research focuses on 397 both diseases without discrimination. The insulin resistance-lipidome alterations had 398 been identified as the characterizing factors of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Guerra et 399 al., 2022). Insulin resistance is associated with obesity. Chloe W et, al. (Wilkin et al., 400\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In type 2 diabetes, RBC membrane lipidome with increased 403 cholesterol, total sphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and glycolipids, but decreased 404 phospholipids may trigger impairment of membrane fluidity and rigidity (Kostara et 405 al., 2021). Altered lipidomics in type 2 diabetes is comprehensive rather than single 406 type (higher triacylglycerols and diacyl-phospholipids but lower alkyl acyl 407 phosphatidylcholines) may be conducive to the forecast of the progress of type 2 408 diabetes (Suvitaival et al., 2018). Interestingly, the altered lipidomics in insulin 409 resistance may be associated with sex (Beyene et al., 2020a). In a word, lipidomics 410 can help diagnose insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and predict disease progression, 411 the timely intervention of lipidomics might reverse the disease (Zobel et al., 2021) 412 which might trigger the preference for research. 413 Previous research had reported obesity had potential progress of insulin 414 resistance, type 2 diabetes, and even pancreatic cancer (Bao et al., 2011). Obese 415 children had significantly altered phospholipidome compared with normal-weight 416 children (Anjos et al., 2019). The altered lipidomics may inherit by offspring (Le\u00f3n-417 Aguilar et al., 2019), obese mothers exhibited a significant reduction in the total 418 abundance of ceramides (Cer) in plasma, mainly of Cer (d18:1/20:0), Cer 419 (d18:1/22:0), Cer (d18:1/23:0), and Cer (d18:1/24:0) and the altered ceramides might 420 deliver to offspring even with a normal diet.

(Beyene et al., 2020b) emphasize that obesity altered lipidomics was 422 associated with sex and age. Specific classes of ether-phospholipids and 423 lysophospholipids (calculated as the sum composition of the species within the class) 424 were inversely associated with age in men only (Beyene et al., 2020b). The obese 425 postmenopausal women had higher triacylglycerol and lower lysoalkyl 426 phosphatidylcholine species compared with premenopausal women (Beyene et al., 427 2020b). In the erythrocyte membrane, the higher interfacial fluidity in obese patient 428\nerythrocyte might result from the switch from \u03c9-3 to \u03c9-6 lipids (Sot et al., 2022). In a 429 word, obesity maintains a status of altered lipidomics, the current research focused on 430 both the manifestation in macroscopic phenomena (such as sex and age) and 431 microcosmic characteristics such as erythrocyte membrane, the transformation of 432 lipidomics with medicine (Fern\u00e1ndez-Arroyo et al., 2019) may regulate 433 cardiovascular disease risk. 434 Alzheimer's disease was the third prefereed disease for lipidomics. The target for 435 Alzheimer's disease was brian which enriches the lipids, especially in PE and maybe 436 this is the reason for the popularity of lipidomics research in this disease. The plasma 437 lipids (sphingomyelins, cholesterol esters, PC, PE, phosphatidylinositols, and 438 triglycerides) are dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients which may help 439 discriminate them from healthy controls (Liu et al., 2021).

Other 447 diseases in our research such as cancer, and cardiovascular disease et, al were also 448 studied extensively. 449 4.4. The lipidomics- favoured tissue 450 Lipidomics-related researches mainly focus on 22 tissue (Fig. 7C). The plasma 451 was the top 1 tissue, followed by the brain, adipose tissue, serum et, al. Diverse tissue 452 was performed for different diseases or models. Plasma was widely applied for 453 clinical trials or animal experiments such as diabetes (Forouhi et al., 2014), coronary 454 heart disease (Si et al., 2021), pneumonia (Snider et al., 2021), and so on. 455 Interestingly, although serum and plasma were both derived from blood and serum 456 has both a convenient handle method and relatively high concentrations of lipidomics 457 (Rajan et al., 2019), the extraction of lipid was preferred to plasma. This phenomenon 458 might be attributed to serum having relatively low levels of the same amount of blood. 459 Brain-lipidomics were always specific diseases, such as alcoholic brain injury (Smith 460 et al., 2022), Alzheimer's disease (Lauer et al., 2021), and neuro inflammatory disease 461 (Derada Troletti et al., 2021). Adipose tissue contains abundant lipids and can be 462 classified into two subtypes, white and brown adipose tissue (Grzybek et al., 2019). 463\nAll rights reserved.

In a word, although plasma was the 465 majority selection for lipidomics extraction, other types of tissue may be specific for 466 models/diseases such as the brain for Alzheimer's disease, liver for nonalcoholic 467 hepatitis (Bissig-Choisat et al., 2021), exercise for skeletal muscle (Mitchell et al., 468 2010), and so on. 469 4.5. The potential hotspots for the future lipidomics 470 Among 50 lipidomics-related citation bursts, keywords (Fig. 7D) show the 471 longest duration citation burst keywords were \u201celectrospray ionization\u201d and 472 \u201cionization mass spectrometry\u201d. Furthermore, the most strength burst keyword was 473 the \u201cbiological sample\u201d which emphasizes the crucial choice of the sample. In 474 addition, a dotted line box (Figure 7d) embraced two keywords in recent times, 475 \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cpregnancy\u201d respectively. 476 Several studies reported specific lipidomics for women. For example, in insulin 477 resistance, the alkylphosphatidylcholine (10), alkenylphosphatidylcholine (23), and 478 alkylphosphatidylethanolamine (6) were associated with men only, but 479 phosphatidylcholine (7) and sphingomyelin (5) were associated in women 480 only(Beyene et al., 2020a). The obese postmenopausal women had higher 481 triacylglycerol and lower lysoalkyl phosphatidylcholine species compared with 482 premenopausal women (Beyene et al., 2020b).

So women have characteristic lipidomics 485 profiles and maybe a potential hotspot in the future. 486 Pregnancy is a special period that may incidence specific diseases such as 487 gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, postpartum depression, and so on. For 488 gestational diabetes, Samuel Furse et, al. (Furse et al., 2021) reported lipid 489 metabolism modulated in a healthy pregnancy, and the timing of these changes is 490 altered in gestational diabetes pregnancies. Both postpartum depression and dementia 491\nare prevalent mental disorders, \u03c9-3 PUFA can protect against both diseases (De 492 Vriese et al., 2003; Lim et al., 2006). In dementia, the medical treatment (Sun et al., 493 2021) may be related to the lipidomics profile. To our knowledge, postpartum 494 depression has no such study. In major antenatal depression, the cholesterol sulfate 495 and PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) may be effective and specific lipidic biomarkers for the 496 prediction of antenatal depression (Wu et al., 2019). The above studies for pregnancy 497 just for better biomarkers in lipidomics but no intervention of lipidomics which 498 indicated that pregnancy-related lipidomics has a giant potential hotspot in the future. 499 Bibliometric analysis was performed on the evolution and trends of lipidomics. 500 Though relatively comprehensive and objective the bibliometric analysis was, some 501 inevitable limitations similar to previous studies (Briganti et al., 2019; Zyoud, 2019; 502 Peng et al., 2022). Lipidomics-related publications in this study were only 503 downloaded from the WOScc database. Even the most commonly used and 504 authoritative comprehensive database the WOSCC is (Boudry et al., 2018; Zhang et 505\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Conclussions 512 To the best of our knowledge, this work provided comprehensive analysis of 513 lipidomics from a bibliometric analysis perspective for the first time. Our 514 bibliometrics portrayed a visualization of lipidomics by reviewing publication records 515 over the past two decades. This research summarizes the temporal trends and 516 evolution, global collaboration patterns, and potential hotspots in the future.
