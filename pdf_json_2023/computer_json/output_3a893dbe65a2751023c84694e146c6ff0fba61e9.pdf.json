Historical aflatoxin (AFL) and fumonisin (FUM) mycotoxin contamination data of corn, daily weather data, satellite data, dynamic geospatial soil properties, and land usage parameters were modeled to identify factors significantly contributing to the outbreaks of mycotoxin contamination of corn grown in Illinois (IL), AFL >20 ppb, and FUM >5 ppm. Two methods were used: a gradient boosting machine (GBM) and a neural network (NN). Both the GBM and NN models were dynamic at a state-county geospatial level because they used GPS coordinates of the counties linked to soil properties. GBM identified temperature and precipitation prior to sowing as significant influential factors contributing to high AFL and FUM contamination. AFL-GBM showed that a higher aflatoxin risk index (ARI) in January, March, July, and November led to higher AFL contamination in the southern regions of IL. Higher values of corn-specific normalized di erence vegetation index (NDVI) in July led to lower AFL contamination in Central and Southern IL, while higher wheat-specific NDVI values in February led to higher AFL. FUM-GBM showed that temperature in July and October, precipitation in February, and NDVI values in March are positively correlated with high contamination throughout IL. Furthermore, the dynamic geospatial models showed that soil characteristics were correlated with AFL and FUM contamination. Greater calcium carbonate content in soil was negatively correlated with AFL contamination, which was noticeable in Southern IL. Greater soil moisture and available water-holding capacity throughout Southern IL were positively correlated with high FUM contamination. The higher clay percentage in the northeastern areas of IL negatively correlated with FUM contamination. NN models showed high class-specific performance for 1-year predictive validation for AFL (73%) and FUM (85%), highlighting their accuracy for annual mycotoxin prediction. Our models revealed that soil, NDVI, year-specific weekly average precipitation, and temperature were the most important factors that correlated\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 01 frontiersin.org\nwith mycotoxin contamination. These findings serve as reliable guidelines for future modeling e orts to identify novel data inputs for the prediction of AFL and FUM outbreaks and potential farm-level management practices.\nKEYWORDS\nAspergillus, Fusarium, machine learning, gradient boosting, neural network, aflatoxin, fumonisin, soil"

            "text": "Mycotoxin contamination of food and feed crops, such as corn, in the United States (US) leads to annual losses estimated in the range of $418 million to $1.66 billion (Vardon et al., 2003; Wu, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2016; Johns et al., 2022). These toxins are produced by distinct fungal species of Aspergillus and Fusarium (Proctor et al., 2018; Munkvold et al., 2019) and are well characterized by their severe health impacts on humans, livestock, and animals (Vardon et al., 2003). In corn, aflatoxins (AFL) are primarily caused by A. flavus and A. parasiticus, and fumonisins (FUM) are produced by F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum (Woloshuk and Shim, 2013). The severity of disease epidemics and associated mycotoxin contamination is driven by environmental and agronomical conditions, with the former being the most relevant. Each fungal species has optimal conditions that favor inoculum formation and dispersal, disease development, and mycotoxin production. For example, for A. flavus, the optimal growth temperatures are 30 to 35\u25e6C (Abdel-Hadi et al., 2012), while for F. verticillioides, temperature ranges between 20 and 25\u25e6C (Medina et al., 2014) are ideal for growth. These temperature optima tend to favor the growth of aflatoxin-producing fungal species such as Aspergillus spp. in southern latitudes (Klich, 2002; Kerry et al., 2021), whereas these optima favor the growth of Fusarium spp. in northern latitudes (Zingales et al., 2022). The geographical distribution of these fungi in the US will most likely change due to climate change leading to an expansion of the temporal and latitudinal temperature growth optima of these mycotoxigenic fungi (Nnadi and Carter, 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Zingales et al., 2022). Additionally, in general, hot conditions favor A. flavus conidiation and dispersal and Fusarium infection of corn (McMillian et al., 1985; Payne et al., 1986, 1988; Diener et al., 1987; Widstrom et al., 1990; Payne and Widstrom, 1992; Guo et al., 1996; S\u00e9tamou et al., 1997; Scheidegger and Payne, 2003; Cotty and JaimeGarcia, 2007). Furthermore, kernel water activity (0.92\u20130.97 aw) and insect injury contribute to mycotoxin production (Warfield Colleen and Gilchrist David, 1999; Miller, 2001; Munkvold, 2003; Bush et al., 2004).\nThe agroecosystem and production of fungal mycotoxins involve soil biogeochemical characteristics that impact both crops and fungi. For example, carbonate content, saturated hydraulic\nAbbreviations: AFL, Aflatoxins; FUM, Fumonisins; ARI, Aflatoxin risk index;\nGBM, Gradient boosting machine; NN, Neural network; FHB, Fusarium head\nblight; BIC, Bayesian information criterion; NDVI, Normalized di erence\nvegetation index; Veg.

Soil property variability is related to factors such as geologic deposition, age of material, climate,\nduration of soil development, land use history, and other factors. Much of the soils in Northern IL were formed in glacial and periglacial deposits from the Wisconsin glacial episode of the late Pleistocene associated with various advances and retreats of the\ncontinental Laurentide ice sheet, while soils in the more southern portion of the state developed from older parent materials with a difference in soil age of approximately 100,000 years or more (Bergstrom et al., 1976). The soil in Northern IL is richer in clay and carbonate materials. Previous studies in IL have shown a north\u2013south difference in historical mycotoxin contamination (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). The 40\u25e6 latitude in IL marks a geographical and meteorological boundary in the state that leads to differences in weather from mixed humid to wintry conditions (K\u00f6ppen, 2011; Beck et al., 2018). Correspondingly, warmer, more humid conditions in Southern IL, provide relatively more favorable conditions for the fungi to infect corn and produce mycotoxins at lower latitudes compared to higher latitudes.\nIntegrated pest and disease management strategies that aim to minimize economic losses associated with mycotoxin contamination need to account for spatial and temporal-specific factors as well as weather, crop health and genetics, past agronomic practices, and soil characteristics. Mycotoxin contamination assessment tools are key for growers and stakeholders to be informed of the potential probabilities of mycotoxin outbreaks and facilitate the deployment of strategies aimed at controlling disease and grain contamination (Focker et al., 2020). Satelliteacquired databases, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been previously used in studies evaluating mycotoxins in European wheat and led to higher mycotoxin model accuracy (Wang et al., 2022). Several studies have shown significant correlations among climate, soil properties, NDVI, and agricultural management practices with AFL contamination in Africa, as reviewed by Keller et al. (2022). AFL studies conducted in Eastern and Western Kenya (Mutiga et al., 2014) support the utility of remote-sensing data such as NDVI, rainfall, and soil properties (such as organic carbon content, pH, total exchangeable bases, salinity, texture, and soil type) to accurately predict AFL contamination (Smith et al., 2016). Soils and their interactions with hydroclimate are highly variable (Smith et al., 2019; Vergopolan et al., 2022) and influence fungal andmicrobial populations in soils.\nPredicting mycotoxin contamination through models has benefited corn production in other countries, but US corn growers,\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 02 frontiersin.org\nwhich produce the most corn in the world, have yet to realize such benefits. Published models assess mycotoxin contamination of milk in Eastern Europe (Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2019) and mycotoxin risk in small grains, corn, and other cereal crops in Italy (Leggieri et al., 2021), Serbia (Liu et al., 2021), Europe (Wang et al., 2022), and Korea (Lee et al., 2018). Machine learning (ML) technologies such as artificial neural networks have been developed in Europe to identify mycotoxin contamination in corn kernels post-harvest using electronic nose technology in northern Italy (Leggieri et al., 2021). Mycotoxin contamination prediction modeling involves other factors, such as fungal development and dispersal. Spore dispersal modeling is an actively developing field of research worldwide, as reviewed by Gonz\u00e1lez-Dom\u00ednguez et al. (2023). Furthermore, the impact of AFL predictive risk models in sub-Saharan Africa has been reviewed by Keller et al. (2022), showing the economic impact of these technologies. The basis of these models served as a general roadmap to model the prediction of AFL and FUM contamination in IL-US. In the US, modeling of fungal diseases has been done by the Fusarium head blight (FHB) risk assessment tool from the US Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative (https://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/) that uses modeling approaches to alert wheat and barley growers of FHB risk (Shah et al., 2018). A US-based predictive model based on insurance claims used as a proxy for mycotoxin contamination values is available for corn (Yu et al., 2020, 2022). However, insurance claims are not necessarily equivalent to actual mycotoxin values. Previous US models targeted the prediction of multinomial levels of AFL and FUM contamination and showed that ML approaches can detect weather factors pre-harvest that significantly impact mycotoxin accumulation in IL (Castano-Duque et al., 2022).\nThe need for US-focused models is even more important when considering that mycotoxin contamination is predicted to increase in the years to come due to climate change (Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2016, 2019). Climate change models predict increased fungal growth and subsequent toxin production (Battilani et al., 2016) due to negative effects on crop host health and the interaction of multiple abiotic factors such as drought, leading to losses in corn production (Long Stephen et al., 2006; Battilani et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2020). Increasing temperatures, longer drought periods, and rising carbon dioxide levels (Vaughan et al., 2014, 2016) as the effects of climate change are expected to continue leading to increased crop vulnerability combined with favorable conditions for fungi such as Aspergillus spp. to grow and produce toxins. These conditions will lead to an increase in plant stress hormones that have been shown to alter plant defense responses (Guo et al., 2008), making the crop more vulnerable to fungal infection and mycotoxin contamination. Therefore, it is predicted that climate change has the potential to negatively impact northern corn-producing states (Corn Belt), as projected weather conditions will increase AFL-related risk (Wu et al., 2011). Risk assessment analysis using 16 climatic models from 2031 to 2040 in the US has shown that 89.5% of corn-growing counties will experience an increase in AFL prevalence, and this projection includes corn in the northern states, suggesting the spread of fungal infection and mycotoxin contamination from southern regions toward the northern Corn Belt (Yu et al., 2022), where it has the potential to be even more devastating to corn production. Models developed\nby using mycotoxin data from major US corn-growing states and trained using weather, satellite, and geographically dynamic features for US-focused areas are critically needed. They will benefit corn growers by mitigating losses projected to occur in extreme weather events associated with climate change.\nWe developed a mycotoxin model that is geospatial dynamic and IL-focused to identify novel risk factors correlated with mycotoxin contamination, we applied machine learning predictive models. We provided new information about the influence of soil properties and remote-sense data (NDVI) on the prediction of AFL and FUM contamination in corn. Understanding the correlations of these factors with mycotoxin contamination can lead to region time-specific targeted integrated pest management practices to prevent AFL and FUM outbreaks, thus serving as guidelines to identify factors that contribute to the contamination risk."

Feature engineering (Battilani et al., 2013; Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2019) was used in combination with gradient boosting models (GBMs) (Friedman, 2001) and neural networks (NNs) to predict (Torgo, 2016) AFL and FUM. In this study, we used 1,772 observations of mycotoxin concentrations, AFL, and FUM from IL-grown corn. Data on the response variable were obtained from historic yearly survey summaries for 2003\u20132004 and 2008\u20132021 (data for 2020 were not available due to the COVID-19 pandemic) published by the IL Department of Agriculture. The years used for model validation were selected from these data based on the percentage of incidence of high contamination events. AFL was measured in 2010 (960 data points, 4% incidence of high contamination levels) and FUM was measured in 2016 (960 data points, 8.1% incidence of high contamination levels). The sample collection was done as described by Castano-Duque et al. (2022); briefly, the kernel sample collection was performed at harvest by randomly collecting 2.3\u20134.5 kg of whole kernels from four corn producers from each county. While mycotoxin analyses were conducted as soon as possible after collection, to minimize post-harvest mycotoxin accumulation, the samples were dried and stored at 4\u25e6C. This mycotoxin data set was zero-inflated, with high contamination levels being rare events (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). This issue was considered during data preparation for ML analysis by using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (Torgo, 2016) that allowed us to generate a balanced data set of the high and low contamination events."

All the satellite data were extracted and summarized by the county after refining them to reflect only land uses for corn and wheat (Boryan et al., 2011). For the extraction of crop specificity of satellite data, a data mask layer was generated for corn acreage for each year of study from the National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data layer (NASS CDL\u2014https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/ CropScape/) data set (Boryan et al., 2011). NASS CDL provides 30- meter grid cell estimates of crop type grown for the Conterminous United States for each year starting in 2005 to the present. Each grid cell represents a best estimate of crop type for a 30-meter by 30-meter division of land. To make the data mask, in each year of study, for each grid cell classed as corn in Illinois, a value of 1 was assigned, while a value of 0 was assigned for all other land uses. Each time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) layer from the MODIS satellite data was multiplied by the mask so that only pixels of MODIS with their centroids falling within corn acreage were tabulated for the county-level NDVI averages (Didan, 2021). The same process was repeated for wheat, with a separate mask file produced from the NASS CDL and separate NDVI county-level averages produced.\nSoil properties were similarly aggregated to the county level by using the NASS CDL data mask. In this case, values of 1 were assigned to cropland, and values of 0 were assigned to other land uses such as forest or urban (Boryan et al., 2011). Soil properties were then queried for all pixels with a value >0 in the Soil Properties data layer from UC Davis and USDA NRCS (Walkinshaw et al., 2022). Mean values for all soil properties for cropland were tabulated to represent cropland soil properties by county. Climatological soil moisture estimates were obtained for the top 5 cm of the soil in IL from SMAP-HydroBlocks at 30m resolution, developed by combining microwave satellite remote sensing, radiative transfer modeling, machine learning, and a highresolution land surface model (Vergopolan et al., 2020, 2021).\nThe physical soil properties available for examination within the mycotoxin model context were water-holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, and soil texture (sand, silt, and clay content). Soil chemical properties include calcium carbonate content, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, pH, and\norganic matter content. Estimates were determined for the 800 \u00d7 800m pixels for various soil depth increments using measured values and interpolation techniques (Walkinshaw et al., 2022). The soil data were queried for soil properties by examining the intersection of each pixel with the cropland reported in the national cropland data layer of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the USDA (Boryan et al., 2011). This national cropland data layer (CropScape\u2014https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) provides estimates of cropping land use for 30m \u00d7 30m land units (pixels) throughout the contiguous continental US for a 5- year summary period prior to the publication date (the summary period used was 2017\u20132021). For each county, the cropland was characterized for the final 5 years of the study. Only the land area that was planted in crops for the period of study was summarized for its soil properties, which were aggregated to the county-wide level as mean soil property estimates. These estimates excluded urban, forested, and other land uses not pertaining to crop production.\nSoil moisture estimates (m3 H2O/m3-soil) were extracted from the SMAP-HydroBlocks (Vergopolan et al., 2021) 2015 to 2019 soil moisture average. SMAP-HydroBlocks is a satellitebased surface soil moisture product available at 30m resolution over the conterminous United States. SMAP-HydroBlocks is derived from NASA\u2019s Soil Moisture Active-Passive product and the HydroBlocks-Radiative Transfer Model using a \u201ccluster-based merging scheme\u201d (Vergopolan et al., 2020) that is parameterized using machine learning-guided refinements based on relations among other in situ, satellite-based observation, and land use-land cover characteristics (Vergopolan et al., 2020). The data product provides soil moisture estimates for the top 5 cm of the soil surface at 6-h intervals. In turn, SMAP-HydroBlocks is sensitive to rainfall, drought, and evapotranspiration dynamics relevant to the microenvironment of mycotoxin-producing fungi.\nHistorical daily average air temperature, precipitation, and general vegetation index data were obtained from GROIntelligence (https://gro-intelligence.com/). A non\u2013crop-specific vegetative index from GRO-intelligence was calculated from satellite data by taking into consideration multiple light spectra to enhance the presence of green vegetation by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and this NDVI will be called veg_index to differentiate it from crop-specific NDVI. Crop-specific NDVI was calculated for each pixel of reported corn production for each year studied and for each pixel of reported winter wheat production for each year studied. The NDVI values, which were identical to the pixels of soil property estimates, were also summarized with a county-wide mean to characterize NDVI for corn and wheat-cropped land over time. NDVI was calculated from the MODIS satellite data (Didan, 2021) by obtaining the difference between the near-infrared reflectance and the red reflectance divided by the sum of the near-infrared and the red reflectance given in the MODIS data set. Higher values of NDVI are given when vegetation is healthy and green, as it absorbs red light and reflects near-infrared light. These NDVI values are available every 16 days from the MODIS satellite from February 2000 to 2023 and are reported in a 250-m resolution. We extracted these time-series values from MODIS data for the pixels determined to be growing either corn or wheat for each 16-day\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 04 frontiersin.org\nperiod available using Google Earth Engine. The crop-specific NDVI and veg_index (general NDVI) data were then interpolated into weekly summaries for the periods of study.\nHistoric meteorological data, soil properties data, and NDVI data were linked to the county-level mycotoxin data by using the county and the year as common information. After linking toxin data with weather, NDVI, and soil data, there were 1,772 data points across 99 counties."

            "text": "Daily average precipitation (mm) and air temperature (\u25e6C) data, averaged per county for the 14 years of historical data, were acquired from GRO-Intelligence. Furthermore, we used the geographical centroids of each county (latitude and longitude) and the climate zones (Friedman, 2001). For AFL models, we engineered a weekly aflatoxin risk index (ARI) as the cumulative sum per week of daily ARI. The monthly ARI was previously described (Castano-Duque et al., 2022); herein, we modified it to calculate a daily ARI (Eq. 1). These ARI equations have been applied to data from Eastern Europe in particular from Ukraine, which has a climate equivalent to IL (Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2019).\nARI = growth or weighted_growth\u00d7 afla or weighted_afla\u00d7\ndispersal\u00d7 (1 + ECB_damage) (1)\nIn the daily ARI, fungal growth was calculated on a daily basis (Battilani et al., 2013) as described by Castano-Duque et al. (2022). Weighted fungal growth (10% of original growth) was generated for days of the month throughout the year when there was no corn in the field. The distribution of mycotoxin levels in relation to the thermal climate zone in IL (Friedman, 2001) has been examined and linked to differences in mycotoxin contamination distribution (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). In IL, there are two climate zones: a mixed-humid climate zone with a monthly outdoor temperature below 7\u25e6C during the winter and a cold climate zone with 5,900 heating degree days per year (18.3\u25e6C basis) (Baechler and Love, 2004). These climatological differences were considered in the model by assuming that the planting date in the mixed-humid zone started about 15th May and in the cold zone in April. This was assumed to be different in the cold and mixed-humid counties due to differences in no-corn in the field times in northern and southern states (January to April, 15th May, and December for cold and January to April and December for mixed-humid). These dates were included by calculating the ARI (Eq. 1). One of the assumptions in our model is that during days of the year when there is no corn in the field, the fungal growth was 90% less. The daily AFL production index was calculated (Battilani et al., 2013) as described by Castano-Duque and Vaughan (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). The spore dispersal was set as an ON/OFF switch (Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2019; Castano-Duque et al., 2022). The assumption in ourmodel is that if there is any daily precipitation, the dispersal is OFF, and if there is no daily precipitation, the dispersal is ON.Wind and other variables are involved in the spore dispersal ofAspergillus (Segers et al., 2023) and Fusarium (Hoffmann et al., 2021) species;\nnevertheless, only precipitation was used in this model due to the consistency of daily historical records throughout the geographical region studied in this case study. Insect damage was calculated for European corn borer damage by using growing degree days (Tbase = 6C and Tcut = 30\u25e6C) and the logistic equation (Maiorano et al., 2009) (Eq. 2).\nA= 7.3 Um= 0.013 Lambda= 1,236.913 R2 = 0.718 e= exp(1)\nECB_damage = A\u00d7 exp{\u2212exp[(\u00b5m x e/A)\u00d7\n(lambda \u2212 cumGDD + 1]} (2)\nwhere ECB (European corn borer) represents damage to the ear by insects, A represents the asymptotic maximum damage level observed in the field approximated to the higher first decimal, \u00b5m represents the maximum specific damage rate, \u03bb represents the intersection of the tangent in the inflection point with the x-axis, and accGDD represents the accumulated GDD. Both \u00b5m and \u03bb are estimated parameters in Maiorano and Reyneri (Maiorano et al., 2009).\nFor any missing values in the weekly ARI or vegetative index features, we performed imputation using multivariate imputation by chained equations; in specific, the predictive mean matching (PMM) method was used in R (van Buuren and GroothuisOudshoorn, 2011; Team, 2017). This imputation method allowed us to determine plausible data values by adding a data point from the original data whose regression-predicted values are closest to the regression-predicted value for the missing data point from the simulated regression model (van Buuren and GroothuisOudshoorn, 2011). Due to the high number of missing data for ARI in weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48, we decided to remove these input features from the model. Finally, we linked the AFL data to the feature data set to create a set of 1,772 data points and 153 features or predictors. The inputs for the AFL model were weekly ARI for each county (Supplementary Table 1). We also added to our input features an average bi-weekly NDVI per county during the weeks of the month when corn might not be in the field (below week 13 and above week 45); an average corn and wheat NDVI; soil properties, latitude, and longitude."

The GBM software package in R was used. This software provided extensions to Freund and Schapire\u2019s AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman\u2019s gradient boosting machine (Friedman, 2001). For performing GBM, we first removed the IL county identifier from the data set and the data for the year that was used for validation, as these would lead to overfitting the model. Next, data were balanced by using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) from the DMwr package in R (Team, 2017), which created a new balanced data set by oversampling observations from the high contamination level class. Finally, the balanced data were partitioned to generate training and testing sets by using a 70 to 30 ratio (Supplementary material 1). We performed GBM for AFL and FUM separately, using the following flags on the training data: a threshold of 500 trees, an interaction depth of 1, a shrinkage of 0.01, and 10 cross-validation folds with the distribution selected as multinomial (Supplementary material 1).\nThe GBM R package (Ridgeway, 2006) was used to perform prediction analysis using the testing data set and the best fit generated from the training data. GBM uses decision trees in an iterative process to determine the best number of trees leading to the lowest error based on the decline of the loss function. Finally, the GBM package was used to compute the effect values (variable relative influence) for each predictor in the model. The relative influence of each predictor from the tree ensemble is determined as the reduction in the sum of squared error due to the splits on that predictor, then averaging the improvement made by each variable across all the trees to determine the relative effect (Friedman, 2001). Thus, the variables with the largest average decrease in the sum of squared error are considered the most important, expressed as the percentage of the total reduction in the error given by all the predictors. A confusion matrix was developed using the caret package in R that computed the overall statistics, the specific statistics by class, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for the multi-class classification to measure the quality of the model\u2019s predictions.\nFor the FUMmodel, we used the following flags on the training data set: a threshold of 500 trees, interaction depth of 1, shrinkage of 0.01, 10 cross-validation folds, and the distribution was selected as multinomial (Supplementary material 1).

In the GBM-FUM, temperature in July (Week 31) and October (Week 44) had a positive relationship with FUM contamination levels (Figures 5A, B), similarly for PRCP in February (Week 7), higher precipitation led to higher FUM contamination levels (Figure 5C) at a geospatial historical level, and high PCRP in March throughout IL in 2008 was linked to the highest incidence of FUM (25.6%, Table 1). To summarize, weather patterns such as precipitation levels in week 7 (February)\nabove 2.5mm and week 11 (March) above 0.3mm can lead to higher FUM levels (Figure 5). Furthermore, temperatures in week 31 (July) above 24\u25e6C and week 44 (October) above 10\u25e6C correlated with high levels of FUM contamination in corn (Figure 5).\nGeneral vegetation index inMarch (Week 11) and corn-specific NDVI in February (week 5), May (week 19), and October (week 42) were positively linked to high FUM contamination, which tends to be observed in the southern parts of IL (Figure 6). While the wheat-specific NDVI showed a negative relationship with FUM contamination levels in June (week 26) (Figure 6D). Soil moisture and available water-holding capacity showed a positive correlation with FUM contamination levels, while clay at 0\u2013 5 and 25\u201350 cm showed a negative correlation (Figure 7). At a geospatial scale, both soil moisture and water-holding capacity tend to be higher in the southwest areas of IL, while the clay content tends to be higher in the northeast regions of the state (Figure 7). GBM-FUM showed that pre-planting precipitation and temperature influence the prediction of FUM contamination levels.

This study builds upon this initial model (Castano-Duque et al., 2022), which provided an IL state case study to account for daily changes in historical weather data (instead of monthly). We also added geospatial soil mineralogical chemical/physical properties and land usage parameters to the models for AFL and FUM. Similarly, predictive mycotoxin models have been developed for northern Italy, linking cropping system factors, and weather variables with deep neural network (DNN) models (Leggieri et al., 2021). Our NN models are unique because we included geospatial dynamic soil and land features linked to the GPS center coordinates of the IL counties. Land usage and soil mineralogical physical/chemical properties are variable for the specific geospatial locations in the US, at both state and county specificity levels (Smith et al., 2019). Using dynamic geospatial data in our models led to the identification of new insights into factors that influence mycotoxin contamination. These factors could be used for risk assessment and to implement timely and region-specific mycotoxin control management practices.\nGBM-AFL identified that higher ARI in January, March, July, and November corresponds to higher AFL contamination, meaning that pre-sowing and post-harvest environmental\nconditions have a strong influence on AFL levels at harvest time. Given that the harvest takes place prior to November, our model assumes that post-harvest input features will influence next year\u2019s mycotoxin contamination. Similar correlations were previously proposed by research conducted in the US (Castano-Duque et al., 2022), Africa (Keller et al., 2022), and Serbia (Liu et al., 2021). GBM-FUM showed that high precipitation events during February and March (pre-sowing time), as well as elevated temperatures in July (flowering time) and October (harvest time), influence FUM contamination. Consistently, previous model reports have shown that warmer temperatures early in the planting season (January\u2013April) lead to higher AFL contamination levels in the US (Yu et al., 2022). GBM-AFL showed that corn-specific NDVI at week 30 (July\u2014within flowering time) also influenced AFL contamination; this feature is linked to plant health as NDVI represents a composite satellite measurement of plant greenness. Lower NDVI translates into less green, unhealthy and/or lower density plants, and lower NDVI in week 30 would suggest that the plants were stressed possibly due to abiotic and/or biotic factors.\nPrevious studies have suggested that crop stress in general also correlates with mycotoxin contamination (Kebede et al., 2012). In 2012, when corn NDVI at week 30 was lower than in other years, the corn crops suffered from extreme drought conditions (NOAA,\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 14 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 7 Soil properties relationship with FUM contamination levels and their geospatial distribution in IL.

For color, legend of soil moisture, a linear ramp was used, and for available water-holding capacity, and clay content, and a non-linear ramp was used.\n2013), which were reflected in lower NDVI values and likely contributed to AFL (contamination levels at harvest time). Studies conducted in Kenya found that AFL contamination is positively associated with high rainfall and NDVI during pre-flowering time while negatively associated during post-flowering time and at harvest (Smith et al., 2016). Our findings agree with published logistic regression models that show that drought stress in corn during flowering time (prior to and beyond mid-silk) is critical for higher contamination at harvest (Damianidis et al., 2018). US-IL models have shown that weather and ARI between corngrowing seasons significantly influence the contamination at the end (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). It is possible that environmental conditions (weather conditions or other agricultural practices) during the spring favor fungal growth (Borr\u00e0s-Vallverd\u00fa et al., 2022), leading to higher corn contamination at the end of the growing season. The development of pest management strategies that take into consideration climate change, such as warmer and wetter spring seasons and drought during the flowering time, is relevant for the management of mycotoxins.\nAFL and FUM-GBMs showed that soil properties are also influential factors contributing to the mycotoxin contamination of corn across spatiotemporal scales. Higher calcium carbonate content patterns throughout IL soil were negatively correlated with historical AFL contamination levels. It has been demonstrated that the calcium carbonate content in soils influences soil pH (Weil and\nBrady, 2002), whereby greater dissolved calcium increases buffering capacity and generates more alkaline soils. Geospatial differences in calcium carbonate in IL soils are due to the advance and retreat of the Laurentide glacier which deposits carbonate-rich materials in the northern half of the state. The negative correlation between AFL levels and calcium carbonate suggests that regions with lower calcium carbonate are associated with higher AFL contamination (Chang and Lynd, 1970), and therefore, calcium carbonate is an important factor in AFL contamination risk.\nThe abundance of calcium is modulated by both abiotic and biotic factors. In terms of abiotic processes, soils with greater concentrations of CaCO3, such as Northern Illinois, typically exhibit greater Ca2+ concentrations through the dissolution of parent CaCO3 and other Ca-bearing mineralogy via infiltrating rainwater (Smith et al., 2019). In terms of biotic factors, such as soil bacteria, they can also modulate the calcium carbonate content of soil by dissolving calcium carbonate into Ca2+ ions and other carbonate species. Some of these \u201cCalcite Dissolving Bacteria\u201d are Serratia marcescens, Sphingomonas changbaiensis, or Novosphingobium panipatense (Peper et al., 2022). Furthermore, the soil microbiome can become dominated by microbial assemblages that suppress the growth of AFL-producing fungi with increasing Ca2+ (Zhang et al., 2021), FUM-producing fungi (Srinivasan et al., 2009), and suppression of mycotoxin-producing fungi strains by non-toxin-producing fungi (Mehl et al., 2012;\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 15 frontiersin.org\nEhrlich, 2014). The presence of both growth-suppressive bacteria and fungi that dissolve calcium carbonate would potentially lead to positive feedback in a calcium carbonate-rich soil. Fungi are involved in carbonate rock destruction, dissolution, precipitation (Verrecchia et al., 2003), and biomineralization (Bindschedler et al., 2016) in laboratory environments. Other environmental factors, such as wet and dry periods, affect the precipitation and accumulation of calcium carbonate in soil (Birkeland, 1974). It is possible that fungal communities and weather parameters coinfluence levels of calcium carbonate and calcium ions in the soil, and these compounds can act as a feedback loop that modulates the fungal communities present in the soil. Understanding the native microbial communities and mycotoxin fungi/contamination could aid in understanding the interaction of soil microbiome, calcium carbonate, and AFL contamination. This knowledge of microbiome diversity could be useful for the development of region-specific biocontrol strategies.\nThe addition of calcium carbonate in the form of limestone to soils is a major agricultural practice in humid climates worldwide, used to directly change the chemical makeup of the rooting zone and improve soil fertility (Weil and Brady, 2002). Greenhouse experiments with peanut plants (Arachis hypogaea L.) showed that adding calcium to the soil leads to a significant reduction in AFL contamination of seeds (Uppala, 2011). Calcium-deficient soils cause calcium deficiency in the corn plant, which can lead to the failure of the upper leaves to unwrap at tasseling time (Melsted, 1953), shorter roots, chlorosis, and necrosis of leaves (do Moraes Gatti et al., 2023). These calcium-deficient symptomsmight increase the propensity of fungal infections to thrive, as calcium is an important component of pathogen-associated moleculartriggered immunity (Fountain et al., 2016) and maize defense responses to pathogens (Jiang and Zhang, 2003; Hu et al., 2007; Ma and Berkowitz, 2011). We hypothesize that Northern IL soils, which are richer in CaCO3 and Ca, are conducive to healthier plants capable of greater resistance to fungal disease and supporting microbiomes that also suppress AFL growth. The characterization of IL native microbiome and fungi soil populations linked to their geospatial location in calcium carbonate-rich or poor zones is not known, although this could aid in understanding the interaction of soil microbiome, calcium carbonate, and AFL contamination. This knowledge of microbiome diversity could be useful for the development of region-specific biocontrol strategies andmycotoxin management alongside external limestone application in areas such as Southern IL or other areas with elevated AFL risks, e.g., a corngrowing season with a hot/wet spring followed by drought during flowering time.\nGBM-FUM showed that FUM contamination is correlated with soil moisture, available water-holding capacity, and a high percentage of clay. These soil hydropedology properties vary across IL (Smith et al., 2019). Southern IL tends to have higher soil moisture levels compared to the north, with the southern area of the state having historically higher percentages of FUM contamination (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). Correspondingly, a positive correlation was observed between soil moisture and FUM contamination. Other soil properties, such as the percentage of clay, tend to be higher in the northeastern areas of IL (Smith et al., 2019), which historically tend to have lower FUM contamination\n(Castano-Duque et al., 2022) as demonstrated by the negative correlation between these two variables.\nClay is the smallest mineral component of soil with the highest surface area per unit mass, in general, it has a high waterholding capacity and low hydraulic conductivity compared to other soil textures, making it prone to becoming waterlogged in moist conditions (Libohova et al., 2018), such as heavy rains. Clay\u2019s high water-holding capacity and poor permeability to water and gases (Weil and Brady, 2002) can lead to flood stress and waterlogging of plants during high precipitation events. While the relationship between flood-stressed corn and Fusarium spp. is not fully understood, it has been established that Fusarium is a strongly aerobic fungus (Stover, 1953), and it has been shown that among sandy loam, silt loam, or clay soil types, Fusarium solani and Fusarium tricinctum have higher disease severity on soybeans grown in sandy and silt loam soil (Yan and Nelson, 2022). Clay soils have high infiltration capacities as water moves into the shrinkage cracks, but when cracks are not present, their infiltration rate is characteristically slow. The small pores of clay solids when filled with water (saturated and under waterlogging conditions) could also influence Fusarium spp by limiting oxygen availability. It would be key to predict FUM outbreaks to understand the biological effect of clay-rich soils and high precipitation events on Fusarium growth and the diversity of species in different geospatial locations in the US.\nSoils in IL with prominent levels of clay, low soil moisture, and low water-holding capacity offer conditions that historically might lead to lower FUM contamination. Clay-rich soils bind strongly to organic matter, contributing to soil aggregation, soil fertility, and cation exchange. Therefore, clay influences soil fertility by modulating cation exchange capacity and soil physical properties (Weil and Brady, 2002). The capacity of clay to hold water and bind to organic matter affects water in the soil and nutrients available for crops. High precipitation events early in the year (February), when there is no corn in the field, could lead to higher FUM contamination. We hypothesize that there must be some biological and chemical interaction between clay-rich soils early in the season and snow and rain events that influence fungal growth in the fields.\nThe primary abiotic factors contributing to the presence of FUM are water activity and temperature (Sanchis et al., 2006; Picot et al., 2010), but the nature of this relation is complex in the context of soil, hydroclimate variability, and plant water use. In optimal temperatures, increased water activity promotes FUM production, but at temperatures above the thermal optimum of 25\u25e6C, decreased water activity also promotes greater FUM production (Marin et al., 2004; Samapundo et al., 2005; Sanchis et al., 2006; Picot et al., 2010). Furthermore, F. verticillioides growth has been shown to be limited by low water activity; however, the FUM1 gene expression was significantly greater with lower water activity (Jurado et al., 2008). Therefore, favorable conditions for FUM production may occur under two different hydroclimate conditions: (1) a wet, i.e., high water activity, period with temperatures in the thermal optimum range; and (2) temperatures above the thermal optimum but dry, i.e., low water activity. Some field-based evidence corroborates the latter, where Roucou et al. (2021) noted increased FUM risk with greater water stress, but only when temperatures were elevated. In this study, the greater historical occurrence of FUM in Southern\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 16 frontiersin.org\nIL, where soils have less water and a propensity for water stress, would support the second condition. Another biophysical feedback between crop and soil may also drive greater water stress as starches are produced during kernel ripening (Jurado et al., 2008; Picot et al., 2010). As such, positive feedback driving greater risk for FUM production into the latter part of a growing season may develop when: (1) temperatures are elevated; (2) kernel ripening begins and plant water use increases; (3) water stress is persistent, e.g., droughtlike conditions; and (4) crops are grown in soils that exasperate water-holding capacity.\nDepending on the soil type, complex plant\u2013water interactions can affect plant health positively or negatively. Soils conducive to drought or flooding stress can result in crops with a lower ability to fight fungal infections and increased susceptibility to AFL (Kebede et al., 2012) and FUM (Parsons and Munkvold, 2010; Vaughan et al., 2016) contamination. Furthermore, relative humidity affects fungal sporulation and growth (Foister, 1946); therefore, both soil\u2013 fungi\u2013water interactions and plant\u2013fungi\u2013water interactions will affect mycotoxin outbreaks. Further research that includes field trials from different regions of the US that have variable soil types and includes year-round time frames to account for the variation of precipitation and temperature would aid in understanding the causality that these spatial-temporal variables have on fungal load and mycotoxin contamination.\nThe AFL and FUM-GBMmodels showed better accuracy values than previously reported in the monthly-based models that did not include geospatial soil dynamic features (Castano-Duque et al., 2022). NN models showed high class-specific performance for 1- year predictive validation for AFL (73%) and FUM (85%), thus the NN models are recommended for annual mycotoxin prediction. The observed overall and specific accuracy levels are at par when compared to other mycotoxin non-US models that showed ranges from 90 to 99% general accuracy for wheat models in Europe (Wang et al., 2022), 75% general accuracy for corn using AFLmaize models in Italy (Battilani et al., 2013) and >75% general accuracy using machine learning models for toxin prediction in corn in northern Italy (Leggieri et al., 2021). Because GBM and NN models showed high-performance levels (Table 3), both can be used for annual mycotoxin prediction. To be implemented, these models would need to use input features for the months of October\u2013December from the previous year\u2019s post-harvest and projected weather and NDVI values for a maximum of a month prior to harvest.\nOur dynamic geospatial models offer additional information about soil properties and remote-sensed data (NDVI) that influence AFL and FUM contamination in corn. Aspergillus growth begins in the soil, which is the habitat for the fungus; thus, the production of AFL by fungi will be influenced by agricultural practices, environmental conditions, and fungal interaction with soil and plants (Winter and Pereg, 2019). Several studies have shown a significant correlation between climate, soil properties, NDVI, and agricultural management practices and AFL contamination in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya, Zambia, and others, as reviewed by Keller et al. (2022). AFL surveys and studies conducted in Eastern and Western Kenya (K\u00f6ppen, 2011) support the utility of remote-sensed data such as NDVI, rainfall, and soil properties to predict aflatoxin contamination (Smith et al., 2016). Satellite-generated databases have been previously used in wheat studies in Europe and led to higher model accuracy (Wang\net al., 2022). Previous studies in Africa found that soil organic carbon content, pH, total exchangeable bases, salinity, texture, and soil type were significantly associated with AFL (Smith et al., 2016). Soil data throughout IL embody important geographic variability related to geologic deposition, age of material, climate, duration of pedogenesis, natural history, and other factors. Soil conditions strongly influence which species of fungi dominate in a given soil environment (Weil and Brady, 2002). Our research shows that in the US, specific properties available from geospatial data such as calcium carbonate, pH, clay content, and soil moisture are key factors correlated with historical AFL and FUM outbreaks. Our dynamic geospatial models can guide research and identifymultiple factors contributing to the risk of AFL or FUM contamination in a geographical region and within weekly time frames.\nSome agronomic practices take place between corn-growing seasons, such as tilling and drilling (Borr\u00e0s-Vallverd\u00fa et al., 2022), while other factors are constant throughout the year, such as soil properties (Smith et al., 2016) and other socioeconomical parameters such as training farmers on the detection of contaminated crops in the field and mitigation strategies, and the involvement of the private sector to provide incentives for farmers to adopt aflatoxin management techniques (Titilayo, 2018) that influence mycotoxin contamination. Several of these factors, such as soil properties, were included in our models, although much information on other agronomic practices is not available at the historical geospatial scale needed for this mycotoxin data set. Nevertheless, our models were able to determine that input features linked to weekly temporal zones between corn-growing seasons have a significant influence on the end-of-year mycotoxin contamination. Among these input features, soil properties were a novel addition to the IL models. It remains to be evaluated if there are differences between the diverse fungi Aspergillus (AFL producer) and Fusarium (FUM producer) (Samapundo et al., 2005) in relation to growth, development, and toxin production associated with environmental factors in the field, such as crop rotation using winter wheat. For future applications, quarterly historical data should be used to create a quarterly predictivemodel. These models would be beneficial for farmers as they will be alerted by the prediction of impending contamination several months in advance before harvest, thus providing ample time to deploy mitigationmeasures such as biocontrol, irrigation, and/or fungicide application to avoid contamination of their crops."
