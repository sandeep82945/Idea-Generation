    "abstractText": "Objective To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of total flavonoids of Rhizoma Drynariae (TFRD) in conjunction with a calcium phosphate/collagen scaffold for the repair of cranial defects in rats. Methods The subjects, rats, were segregated into four groups: Control, TFRD, Scaffold, and TFRD + Scaffold. Cranial critical bone defects, 5 mm in diameter, were artificially induced through precise drilling. Post-surgery, at intervals of 2, 4, and 8 weeks, micro-CT scans were conducted to evaluate the progress of skull repair. Hematoxylin\u2013eosin and Masson staining techniques were applied to discern morphological disparities, and immunohistochemical staining was utilized to ascertain the expression levels of local osteogenic active factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and osteocalcin (OCN). Results Upon examination at the 8-week mark, cranial defects in the Scaffold and TFRD + Scaffold cohorts manifested significant repair, with the latter group displaying only negligible foramina. Micro-CT examination unveiled relative to its counterparts, and the TFRD + Scaffold groups exhibited marked bone regeneration at the 4and 8-week intervals. Notably, the TFRD + Scaffold group exhibited substantial bone defect repair compared to the TFRD and Scaffold groups throughout the entire observation period, while histomorphological assessment demonstrated a significantly higher collagen fiber content than the other groups after 2 weeks. Immunohistochemical analysis further substantiated that the TFRD + Scaffold had augmented expression of BMP-2 at 2, 4 weeks and OCN at 2 weeks relative to other groups. Conclusions The synergistic application of TFRD and calcium phosphate/collagen scaffold has been shown to enhance bone mineralization, bone plasticity, and bone histomorphology especially during initial osteogenesis",

Cranial critical bone defects, 5 mm in diameter, were artificially induced through precise drilling. Post-surgery, at intervals of 2, 4, and 8 weeks, micro-CT scans were conducted to evaluate the progress of skull repair. Hematoxylin\u2013eosin and Masson staining techniques were applied to discern morphological disparities, and immunohistochemical staining was utilized to ascertain the expression levels of local osteogenic active factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and osteocalcin (OCN).\nResults Upon examination at the 8-week mark, cranial defects in the Scaffold and TFRD + Scaffold cohorts manifested significant repair, with the latter group displaying only negligible foramina. Micro-CT examination unveiled relative to its counterparts, and the TFRD + Scaffold groups exhibited marked bone regeneration at the 4- and 8-week intervals. Notably, the TFRD + Scaffold group exhibited substantial bone defect repair compared to the TFRD and Scaffold groups throughout the entire observation period, while histomorphological assessment demonstrated a significantly higher collagen fiber content than the other groups after 2 weeks. Immunohistochemical analysis further substantiated that the TFRD + Scaffold had augmented expression of BMP-2 at 2, 4 weeks and OCN at 2 weeks relative to other groups.\nConclusions The synergistic application of TFRD and calcium phosphate/collagen scaffold has been shown to enhance bone mineralization, bone plasticity, and bone histomorphology especially during initial osteogenesis phases.\nKeywords Rhizoma Drynariae, Bone defect, Chinese medicine, Adjunctive therapy\n*Correspondence: Jun Lin linjun2@zju.edu.cn 1 Department of Stomatology, Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China 2 Department of Stomatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China 3 Department of Cytopathology, Ningbo Diagnostic Pathology Center, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China\nBone defect, a multifaceted pathology prevalent in medical science, can emanate from a multitude of sources such as trauma, inflammation of bone tissue, tumor excision, or congenital malformations [1, 2]. This condition profoundly affects patients\u2019 quality of life, necessitating comprehensive treatment approaches. Presently, bone grafting, which can be either autogenous or allogeneic (originating from a different individual), stands as the conventional method for addressing bone anomalies [3]. However, both techniques present unique challenges. Allograft transplantation may encounter rejection and obstacles in revascularization, while autogenous bone transplantation may give rise to pain at the donor site and complexities in achieving congruence with the recipient bone structure [4].\nCalcium phosphate (CP), as the primary inorganic constituent, along with collagen and water as the principal organic components, constitutes the structural matrix of bone tissue [5]. CP and collagen scaffolds, being the two most prominent components, have been shown exceptional biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity for bone critical-size defect repair [6, 7]. Critical-size defect (CSD) is the smallest in diameter bone defect that does not heal spontaneously [8]. The research conducted by Kim et\u00a0al. substantiates that hydroxyapatite demonstrates notable osteocompatibility, effectively facilitating new bone ingrowth [9]. Furthermore, the application of medical-grade polycaprolactone/tricalcium phosphate (mPCL-TCP) combined with collagen scaffold and rhBMP-2 has been observed to enhance bone quality significantly in the treatment of critical bone defects [10]. Additionally, the study by Chatzipetros E et\u00a0al. reveals that the incorporation of nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan scaffolds plays a pivotal role in new bone formation in rat calvarial CSD, as evidenced by histomorphometric analysis and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) measurements [8, 11].\nNevertheless, when bone defects reach critical-size, patients may be confronted with extended recovery durations, subsequently amplifying the risk of treatmentassociated complications such as infection and bone malformation [12, 13]. Future inquiries must concentrate on expediting bone regeneration, curtailing the temporal scope of treatment, and obviating the emergence of complications.\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers an expansive repository of therapeutic modalities, amenable to enhancement through integration with contemporary medical doctrines [14]. Such fusion may foster the inception of novel solutions and strategies for recalcitrant clinical conundrums. Additionally, this amalgamation aids in deciphering the underlying mechanisms by which TCM\nmanifests its therapeutic impact, thereby consolidating a scientific framework for its clinical translation [15\u201317].\nSeveral research endeavors have substantiated the therapeutic potential of the Chinese herb Total Flavonoids of Rhizoma Drynariae (TFRD), a compound routinely utilized in formulations for fracture recuperation and osteoporosis management [18]. Prevailing literature underscores TFRD\u2019s capacity to potentiate osteoblast differentiation and mineralization processes [19]. Furthermore, scholarly investigations have postulated TFRD\u2019s ability to curtail the bone resorption functions of osteoclasts, thereby forestalling bone depletion [20]. In\u00a0 vivo studies have corroborated that TFRD enhances trabecular bone count and bone mineral density (BMD), optimizes bone tissue architecture, and galvanizes novel bone synthesis [20, 21]. Moreover, extracts of TFRD have been shown to catalyze bone proliferation at the peripheries of lesions in New Zealand white rabbit parietal bones [22]. In a synergistic approach, the amalgamation of TFRD and calcium derivatives arrested the diminution of collagen fibers in the femur, thereby bolstering the resurgence of nascent bone or cartilage tissue in ovariectomized rats [23]. While its propensity to promote bone healing is recognized, the precise molecular pathways underlying its action remain nebulous. In the current study, we administered TFRD in conjunction with a calcium phosphate/ collagen scaffold to rats with cranial defects, monitoring the dynamic shifts in bone repair and correlated factors to scrutinize the influence of TFRD on the osteogenic differentiation of the calcium phosphate/collagen scaffold and its mechanistic principles. The insights gleaned from this investigation may contribute significantly to the evolving paradigm of \u201cintegrative medicine,\u201d a nexus that harmonizes traditional Chinese and Western medical philosophies."

After an 8-week period, the representative samples showed tactile assessment of the bone defect area in control revealed a soft texture, devoid of bony sensation; microvascular structures remained invisible. Contrarily, the defect in the bone within the Scaffold and TFRD + Scaffold groups had perceptibly diminished, exhibiting a hard, bony texture; especially TFRD + Scaffold group, bone defects substantial recovered, as graphically depicted in Fig.\u00a04A.\nMicro-CT quantitative assessments revealed a temporal elevation in BMD across all cohorts, with the TFRD-administered group evidencing an accelerated trajectory. At the bi-weekly checkpoint, the BMD quantification for the TFRD cohort surpassed that of the control group (1064 \u00b1 99.59 versus 865.1 \u00b1 38.82, p < 0.05). Intriguingly, the TFRD + Scaffold group\u2019s BMD was substantially elevated compared to the lone Scaffold group (2167 \u00b1 97.45 versus 1847 \u00b1 157.8, p < 0.05).

Micro-CT scans demonstrated an absence of marked osteogenesis within the control group\u2019s rat skulls post. A limited proliferation of new bone was detected at the defect\u2019s periphery in the TFRD group. However, in the Scaffold and Scaffold + TFRD groups, the bone defect underwent efficacious repair; particularly in the Scaffold + TFRD group, with the latter particularly evidencing a uniformity in the density of the emergent osseous tissue in juxtaposition with the neighboring cranial structures surrounding the defect. Anchored in these initial findings, our posited hypothesis suggests a symbiotic efficacy of TFRD and scaffold in facilitating osseous recuperation."

Within the TFRD contingent, a profusion of active osteoblasts was discernible at the peripheries of the osseous deficits. Conversely, both the Scaffold and the TFRD + Scaffold assemblies were characterized by the presence of extensive regions of neo-osteogenesis, typified by newly formed bone, bone marrow, and osteoid matrix (Fig.\u00a0 5A). By the culmination of the 8-week period, relative to its counterparts, TFRD + Scaffold group manifested significantly developed mature bone tissues at the defect site.\nThe maturity of bone tissue was evaluated via\u00a0 Masson\u00a0 staining. Masson staining identified trabecular bone and mature bone tissues in red, collagen fiber and juvenile bone tissues in blue, and the osteoid in pink. Initial results, two weeks post-intervention, depicted conspicuous fibrous and osteogenic regions across all\nexperimental groupings. By the 8-week marker, the TFRD cohort was typified by an expansive osteogenic region suffused with a prominent dark red tone. Meanwhile, Masson staining image analysis showed that TFRD + Scaffold group exhibited a significantly higher mineralized collagen fiber content after two weeks than that of the other groups, twice as much as Scaffold group in comparison (Fig.\u00a05c). Collagen fiber content and neonatal bone tissue decreased, and mature bone tissue increased as time progressed. Consequently, the Masson staining underscored the propitious role of TFRD in augmenting early bone regeneration, and concurrently highlighted that the TFRD + Scaffold conglomerate boasted more advanced bone tissues within the bone defect location."

            "text": "Despite the commendable success rate achieved with calcium phosphate/collagen scaffolds in clinical applications, the quest for expedited bone regeneration and abbreviated treatment durations persist as pivotal frontiers in osteogenesis research [24]. In this context, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a compelling adjunct to surgical interventions. Our present investigation elucidated that the bone healing proficiency of the TFRD cohort markedly surpassed that of the control group. Notably, this enhancement in bone regenerative capability was conspicuously amplified when TFRD was amalgamated with scaffolding substrates, especially during the incipient stages of osteogenesis.\nA plethora of empirical endeavors have underscored the salutary influences of both TFRD and calcium\nphosphate/collagen scaffold in bolstering bone reparative capabilities. To meticulously discern the potential synergistic ramifications of these two entities, we meticulously curated two-by-two comparative matrices within our experimental blueprint: juxtaposing the Control group against the TFRD cohort, and the Scaffold assembly against the TFRD + Scaffold ensemble. Subsequent evaluations spanned imaging diagnostics, histological analyses, and immunohistochemical assessments. Guo Ying et\u00a0 al. elucidated that TFRD facilitates the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), amplifying the expression of pivotal factors such as \u03b2-catenin, lymphoid enhancer factor I (LEFl), and cyclin D mRNA during the nascent phases of\ndifferentiation. Intriguingly, TFRD attenuates the expression of these factors as differentiation matures. This observation underscores the hypothesis that TFRD\u2019s primary contribution to osteoblast differentiation predominantly occurs during the early differentiation phases [25]. Jiang Ziwei et\u00a0 al. delved into the temporal effects of TFRD on osteogenesis efficacy, utilizing tibia distraction osteogenesis in rats as a model system. The empirical findings elucidated that the group treated with the flavonoids throughout the entire experimental period exhibited notably superior results in terms of X-ray scores and bone mineral density when juxtaposed with groups\nreceiving interventions during the distraction phase alone or both the distraction and mineralization phases. In summation, an early and consistent administration of TFRD can significantly augment the quality of bone formation in the distraction osteogenic region of rats [26]. Our results are in line with the literatures. The micro-CT BMD analysis showed that the TFRD + Scaffold assembly showcased a superior trajectory and velocity of bone density amplification in contrast to the sole scaffold group during the initial two and four-week periods, which demonstrated TFRD may have favorable consequences concerning precocious osteogenesis.\nCollagen fibers within the bone tissue matrix are crucial for osteoblast maturation and matrix mineralization. Type I collagen, a primary component of the bone matrix, facilitates the expression of osteoadhesins, osteocalcin, and bridging proteins, thereby enhancing matrix mineralization during the mineralization phase [27]. In\u00a0vivo studies at the 2-week mark revealed that the collagen content in the TFRD + Scaffold group was significantly higher than that in the Scaffold group alone. However, there was a gradual decrease in collagen content in the TFRD + Scaffold group at weeks 4 and 8. These observations indicate that TFRD integrated with calcium phosphate/collagen scaffolds may induce early osteogenesis and expedite matrix mineralization.\nThe principal exhibition of TCM\u2019s facilitation in osteogenic repair can be elucidated in the following dimensions: Initially, promoting blood circulation to dredge collaterals, thereby the prevention and elimination of blood clots mitigate aseptic inflammation and trauma to soft tissues [28]. Subsequently, the enhancement of blood circulation, vascular wall permeability, ion exchange, local deposition of trace elements such as zinc, iron, copper, manganese, and calcium salts occurs [29]. Further, there is stimulation of local collagen synthesis at the fracture terminus within the bone matrix, and the secretion and synthesis of bone growth factors such as BMPs, VEGF and OCN.\nThe therapeutic efficacy of TFRD in fracture recuperation and osteoporosis management is elucidated through its intricate modulation of two distinct molecular signaling pathways. Firstly, TFRD facilitates the activation of osteogenesis-associated signaling cascades within bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts [30]. Notably, pathways such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, MAPK, and Smad are intricately linked to bone synthesis [31]. Conversely, TFRD mitigates osteoporosis by impeding bone resorption and attenuating bone loss. The critical pathways orchestrating this inhibitory action on bone resorption encompass CTSK and OPG/ RANKL/RANK [18, 32]. It is noteworthy that while the majority of therapeutic agents typically target either\nbone resorption or synthesis singularly, TFRD exhibits a dual modulatory influence on both these processes [33, 34].\nAs an integral component of the BMPs family, BMP-2 assumes an osteogenic mantle by orchestrating the transcription of genes germane to osteogenesis and by catalyzing the Smads protein signaling mechanism. [35] BMP-2 exerts considerable osteoinductive activity, signifying its capability to directly increase cell augment cellular calcification and instigate new bone formation in conjunction with osteoblast maturation [15, 20]. Data from our investigation delineate that the expression of BMP-2 across all experimental cohorts reached zenithal levels two weeks post-gavage, subsequently waning thereafter. However, consistently across all evaluated intervals, the TFRD + Scaffold group exhibited superior BMP-2 expression compared to the Scaffold group, and the TFRD group surpassed the Control group. These findings are congruent with extant literature, illustrating that TFRD elevates BMP-2 expression, thus favoring bone production and differentiation.\nOsteoblasts proceed through four sequential stages during bone formation: proliferation, extracellular matrix maturation, extracellular matrix mineralization, and apoptosis. [36] Accordingly, the investigative approach to augment the pace of induced bone healing encompasses the stimulation of osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, mineralization, and the release of augmented osteogenic-related proteins. Osteocalcin (OCN), a ubiquitous non-collagenous protein in bone tissue synthesized by osteoblasts and marked by a swift turnover rate, functions as a precise and unerring indicator of osteoblast activity [37]. The results manifested that the group receiving scaffold combined with TFRD gavage displayed increased bone growth and mineralization in both the central and peripheral regions of the bone defect area, culminating in the upregulation of osteogenic-associated factors such as OCN. The escalated OCN positive expression in the TFRD-Scaffold group surpassed that achieved by scaffold alone, corroborating the enhancement of osteoblasts\u2019 bone formation functionality and the remodeling process facilitated by TFRD.\nThrough rigorous animal-based experimentation, our study culminates in the conclusive assertion that the confluence of TFRD and calcium phosphate/collagen scaffolds exudes a distinct synergistic efficacy. TFRD amplifies bone repair capabilities, primarily by galvanizing the expression of osteogenesis-associated proteins like BMP-2 and OCN, especially during the nascent stages of bone regeneration. This intricate tapestry of actions provides clarity on the synergistic potential when TFRD is integrated with calcium phosphate/collagen scaffolds. Such findings bolster the proposition for\nTFRD\u2019s incorporation as a potent herbal therapeutic for addressing bone defects.\nAbbreviations TFRD Total Flavonoids of Rhizoma Drynariae BMP-2 Bone morphogenetic protein 2 OCN Osteocalcin CP Calcium phosphate\nAuthor contributions LY contributed to study design, experimental research and manuscript draft.
