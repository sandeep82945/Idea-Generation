High-tech enterprises have obvious knowledge-intensive and technical dense characteristics, and human capital plays an important role in the process of corporate knowledge creation. High-tech enterprise manpower capital stock, flow, and investment three perspectives have built the simulation model of high -tech enterprises human capital of the human capital of high-tech enterprises, using system simulation methods, based on the VENSIM PLE simulation environment, revealing the innovative consortium, hightech enterprise manpower The impact of capital on innovation performance. The research found that the contribution of human capital stock to innovative performance is the greatest, of which technical human capital has the most impact on the output of innovative performance; and the flow of human capital flow and investment are positive to promote innovative performance output, and the level of contribution is basically the same. On the contrary, under PLAN8, high-tech enterprises' human capital Reduces the amount of decrease in a constant speed. It can be seen from Figure 15 that the level of innovative performance output under PLAN7 is the best. In the current value of (Current), the innovative performance output under PLAN8 is poor. Because the parameters of the three scheme changes have a direct impact on the reduction of high -tech enterprise's human capital, the number of high-tech enterprises with high-tech enterprises in the three schemes have significantly different from the amount of human capital, and it has a significant impact on innovative performance. It can be concluded that effective measures to reduce the reduction rate of general human capital, the reduction in technical human capital, and the reduction of the human capital of executive manpower, can reduce the reduction of general, technical, and executive human capital, and then reduce the human capital of high -tech enterprises' human capital reduces the amount, thereby affecting the existence of human capital of high -tech enterprises, and eventually positively affect innovative performance. v. conclusions and discussion This article has established a model of high-tech enterprise human capital on innovation performance through the theoretical basis of system dynamics, human capital, and innovative performance. The relevant factors of the human capital of high-tech enterprises are analyzed, and the model

built is used to simulate the simulation of the VENSIM PLE simulation analysis environment. From the results, the model better fits the high-tech enterprise in practice in practice The formation of human capital formation and its impact on innovative performance shows the feasibility of the research on the impact of the human capital of high-tech enterprises on innovation performance. Therefore, this article obtains the following research conclusions and revelations. a. theoretical contributions and practical implications The first is the impact of general human capital on
innovative performance. Ordinary employees occupy the largest proportion in one organization. Although the knowledge literacy and technical level of general employees have no core technical talents, general employees occupy an important position in the survival and development of hightech enterprises. Core technical personnel have developed and improved new technologies, and through the production labor of ordinary employees, these research and development and improved technologies are put into practice, and they are used to improve the innovative performance of high-tech enterprises. Therefore, although general human capital has not been very obvious in promoting the innovative performance of high-tech enterprises, general human capital is still very important for the survival and development of high-tech enterprises. Enterprises provide technical training for ordinary employees, improve their level of knowledge reserves and technological innovation, and lay a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the organization. The second is the impact of technical human capital on innovative performance. The basis of the survival and development of high-tech enterprises is core competition technology, and technical employees play an important role in it. Because most of the employees flowing out of high-tech enterprises are technical personnel, on the one hand, high-tech enterprises belong to the knowledge-intensive emerging
industries. Because their business technology is stronger, it will inevitably depend on technical employees to depend on higher level Employees who are the main targets for competitors in the same industry. To this end, competitors in the same industry may give higher treatment to attract the need for technical employees; on the other hand, knowledge absorption and high-quality employees with strong technical capabilities and high -quality employees Strong technical innovation ability, means that there are more choice rights in work opportunities, especially the core technical personnel and senior executives of the enterprise will choose more appropriate enterprises and jobs based on their career planning
and vision. The loss of these core technical employees will lead to the risk of technology leakage, weakening the core competitive advantage of enterprises in terms of technical level, and eventually, it will have a negative impact on the innovative performance of the enterprise. The third is the impact of executive human capital on innovative performance. The management of senior executives can master the direction of corporate survival and development, which can minimize the direction of technology research and development and innovation in the organization. High-tech enterprises' requirements for professional knowledge and innovation capabilities are stricter than other industries. Under the macro policy of the knowledge and economic environment and the national key support, the high-tech industry has a bright prospect, market demand is getting wider and wider, and competition is getting more and more. Fierce, high-tech enterprises are facing environmental backgrounds that coexist with opportunities and challenges. To gain competitive
advantages in such an environment, high-tech enterprises must pay attention to the conclusions and discussion This article has established a model of high-tech enterprise human capital on innovation performance through the theoretical basis of system dynamics, human capital, and innovative performance.

Fierce, high-tech enterprises are facing environmental backgrounds that coexist with opportunities and challenges. To gain competitive
advantages in such an environment, high-tech enterprises must pay attention to the introduction of three high-level technical talents. Strong and experienced R&D talents. The second is technical personnel who have advanced technologies and strong operating skills. The third is senior managers with composite backgrounds and management knowledge and practical experience. In general, high-tech enterprises generally exert their human capital stocks ideal and significantly promote the improvement of innovative performance. It has verified the theoretical analysis of the key factors that affect the key factors of innovation performance. The importance of increasing the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises and the positive impact on the output of innovative performance. Therefore, enterprises need to meet the interests of technical employees to the greatest extent through effective measures, stabilize the flow of technical employees in the enterprise, form the competitive advantage of the enterprise, and promote the innovative performance output of the enterprise. b. limitations and future research In summary, due to the complexity and abstraction of the system and the limited ability of the author, there are also some shortcomings in this article: First of all, the measurement of high-tech enterprises' human capital stock involves more impossible hidden indicators. This article is only from high -
tech The amount of corporate human capital increases and decrease in measurement, and the model is slightly simple.
