    "abstractText": "Magnetic materials with ingeniously designed structures may be utilized as highly efficient microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) working at ultralow matching thicknesses. However, it remains a challenge to decrease the matching thickness by synergistically tailoring the composition and structure of magnetic MAMs. In this work, a series of magnetic MAMs have been synthesized by sequentially annealing Fe-bdc nanorods in air and hydrogen. The results show that with the increase in hydrogen reduction temperature, the Fe2O3 nanorods would be gradually converted into Fe2O3/Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/FeO/Fe/C and Fe/C composites. In the meantime, obvious particle shrinkage would first occur and significant crystal growth would then happen, leading to the disappearance of pores, the decrease in axial length and the increase in particle size. In addition, a higher reduction temperature always leads to higher complex permittivity (\u03b5r) and permeability (\u03bcr), which should be related to the higher content of Fe3O4 and Fe. Nevertheless, one-dimensional structures and surface oxidation may cause abnormal \u03b5r and \u03bcr. As for HR-350, the one-dimensional structure results in strong conduction loss, the Fe3O4/C interfaces contribute to polarization loss, and semiconductive Fe3O4 and amorphous carbon favor superior impedance matching. Consequently, an RL peak value of \u221243.77 dB can be obtained with an effective absorption bandwidth of 3.52 GHz, when the thickness is only 1.2 mm. This work may provide novel insights into the design of MAMs with broadband absorption at ultralow matching thicknesses and provide a good reference for the synthesis of MOF-derived magnetic materials.",

However, it remains a challenge to\ndecrease the matching thickness by synergistically tailoring the composition and structure of magnetic\nMAMs. In this work, a series of magnetic MAMs have been synthesized by sequentially annealing Fe-bdc\nnanorods in air and hydrogen. The results show that with the increase in hydrogen reduction temperature,\nthe Fe2O3 nanorods would be gradually converted into Fe2O3/Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/FeO/Fe/C and Fe/C composites. In the meantime, obvious particle shrinkage would first occur and significant crystal\ngrowth would then happen, leading to the disappearance of pores, the decrease in axial length and the\nincrease in particle size. In addition, a higher reduction temperature always leads to higher complex per-\nmittivity (\u03b5r) and permeability (\u03bcr), which should be related to the higher content of Fe3O4 and Fe. Nevertheless, one-dimensional structures and surface oxidation may cause abnormal \u03b5r and \u03bcr. As for HR-350, the one-dimensional structure results in strong conduction loss, the Fe3O4/C interfaces contribute to polarization loss, and semiconductive Fe3O4 and amorphous carbon favor superior impedance matching. Consequently, an RL peak value of \u221243.77 dB can be obtained with an effective absorption bandwidth of 3.52 GHz, when the thickness is only 1.2 mm. This work may provide novel insights into the\ndesign of MAMs with broadband absorption at ultralow matching thicknesses and provide a good refer-\nence for the synthesis of MOF-derived magnetic materials."

            "text": "In recent years, the rapid development of 5G technology has not only improved the communication efficiency, but also resulted in electromagnetic interference issues and electromagnetic radiation pollution. Microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) that are capable of dissipating incident microwaves through dielectric, magnetic or other processes have therefore been regarded as effective tools to deal with harmful highfrequency microwaves.1,2 To adapt to the diverse application requirements, effective MAMs should be able to strongly absorb wideband microwaves with low areal density, matching thickness and application cost.3,4\nWith special emphasis on low matching thickness, high complex permittivity (\u03b5r) or high complex permeability (\u03bcr) and good impedance matching are required. Generally, there are basically two ways to obtain high enough \u03bcr or \u03b5r. On the one hand, the content of magnetic material should be improved.5 Among conventional MAMs, dielectric materials usually possess high \u03b5r but low \u03bcr. The lack of \u03bcr poses a negative effect on the decrease of matching thickness and the extension of effective absorption bandwidth. In contrast, magnetic materials may have high \u03b5r and high \u03bcr, which are in favor of reducing matching thickness. For example, Zhou et al. have \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: SEM images of O-550 and O-650; elemental mapping of reduced products; Raman spectra of the reduced products; attenuation constants of the reduced products; impedance matching ratios of the reduced products.

For instance, one- and two-dimensional structures are conducive to the formation of a percolation network, leading to the improvement of electrical conductivity.9 Introducing defects or constructing interfaces might enhance dipole polarization under an external electromagnetic field.10,11 As for the magnetic properties, natural resonance frequency can be increased by inducing shape anisotropy.12 Eddy current can be decreased by decreasing the particle size or by coating with an insulation layer.13 For example, two-dimensional sandwiched FeNi@SnO2 has been synthesized by Lv et al. and owing to the rich attenuation mechanisms, including dipole polarization, exchange resonance and interfacial polarization, an ultrawide EAB of 11.70 GHz can be obtained at a thickness of 1.75 mm.14 On the basis of the above discussions, magnetic materials with ingeniously designed structures may have a great chance to become highly efficient MAMs working at ultralow matching thickness.\nHowever, we should not neglect the vital role of impedance matching, which is a prerequisite for effective microwave absorption. On the one hand, \u03b5r is larger than \u03bcr for almost all MAMs and efforts should be devoted to decreasing \u03b5r, which could be realized by compositing nonconductive materials, introducing porous structures and decreasing the loading ratio.15 Liang et al. have hydrothermally prepared SCFs@Fe3O4 with excessively high \u03b5r and inferior impedance matching, and it is found that both calcinating in Ar to generate honey-comblike structures and coating with phenolic resin are favorable for optimizing impedance matching and promoting microwave absorption performance.16 On the other hand, decreasing \u03b5r always leads to decreasing \u03bcr, especially when high contents of nonmagnetic materials have been incorporated. Consequently, the content of nonmagnetic components in the MAMs should be strictly controlled. For instance, the \u03b5r of Fe-based composites can be effectively decreased by reducing the content of phenolic resin, which acts as a reducing agent for Fe2O3. In the meantime, owing to the generation of antiferromagnetic FeO, \u03bcr has also declined, which is averse to strong electromagnetic attenuation ability and excellent impedance matching.17 To sum up, the \u03b5r of magnetic MAMs should be effectively optimized without decreasing \u03bcr to realize excellent impedance matching at low matching thicknesses.\nWith all this in mind, novel one-dimensional magnetic MAMs, including Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/FeO/Fe/C and Fe/C, have been synthesized via combined oxidation and reduction techniques. In detail, porous Fe2O3 nanorods were firstly obtained by annealing Fe-bdc nanorods in air, and magnetic MAMs were subsequently gained by annealing Fe2O3 nanorods in H2.\nThe advantages of the as-prepared MAMs can be summarized as: (1) the interconnected chain-like structure facilitates the transport of charge carriers, thus increasing the \u03b5r; (2) the existence of the interface structure (among Fe3O4, FeO, Fe and carbon) and defects enhance the dipole polarization, thus increasing the \u03b5r; (3) the high content of crystalline magnetic materials ensures high \u03bcr; (4) the conduction loss, interfacial polarization loss, natural resonance and eddy current loss contribute to the attenuation of incident microwave; and (5) the reduction temperature has a significant influence on the composition and structure, laying the foundation for the synergistic optimization of dielectric loss tangents (tan \u03b4\u03b5), magnetic loss tangents (tan \u03b4\u03bc) and \u03bc\u2032/\u03b5\u2032. This work may pave the way for the design of MAMs working at low thickness and shed new light on the synthesis of MOF-derived magnetic composites."

Then, Fe2O3 nanorods were obtained by annealing Fe-bdc in high temperature air, and\nunexpectedly, there might be organic residues in the annealed powders. Finally, magnetic composites with unique onedimensional structures were obtained through hydrogen reduction.\nFig. 2a shows that the as-prepared Fe-bdc nanorods are quite uniform with a length of about 1000 nm and a diameter of about 100 nm. In order to select the optimal oxidation temperature, TG and DTG curves are given in Fig. 2b to display the pyrolysis process in air from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C. In detail, two obvious endothermic peaks can be observed near 160 \u00b0C and 377 \u00b0C in the DTG curve, revealing the occurrence of two thermodynamic processes. Thus, the entire TG curve can be divided into three parts. First, the weight percentage of Fe-bdc decreases to 58.34% due to the evaporation of the solvent DMF. In the second stage, 300\u2013450 \u00b0C, obvious weight loss takes place and the weight percentage decreases to 19.38%, indicating the decomposition of Fe-bdc.

View Article Online\nFig. 2c. Owing to the loss of organic components, the nanorod length decreases to \u223c500 nm and the diameter decreases to \u223c50 nm. Interestingly, some holes can be observed in the nanorods, which enlarge the surface area and reduce the difficulty of hydrogen reduction. In addition, the SEM images of O-550 and O-650 are shown in Fig. S1a\u2013d.\u2020 Similar interconnected chain-like structures can be found for the above samples, while for O-650, the length decreases to \u223c350 nm and the diameter increases to \u223c120 nm, indicating the crystal growth.21 To lower the reduction difficulty and reduce energy consumption, O-450 has been selected to complete the annealing process in H2. The SEM images of the reduced product are shown in Fig. 2d\u2013h. When the reduction temperature is low (250 and 350 \u00b0C), a typical one-dimensional structure was formed, which should originate from the rod-like structure of O-450. In addition, we can infer that high-temperature hydrogen reduction leads to the shrinkage of particles and the disappearance of pores. At higher temperatures (450 \u00b0C), the one-dimensional structure begins to collapse, accompanied by the increase in grain size and the appearance of a short dumbbell-like structure. When the temperature rises to 550 \u00b0C, the particle grows to be a long polyhedra with length larger than 1 \u03bcm. At an even higher temperature of 650 \u00b0C, only large irregular polyhedra of size larger than 2 \u03bcm can be seen. Besides, Fig. S2a\u2013e\u2020 shows the elemental distribution of the reduced products, from which we can see that the Fe element disperses uniformly in both rod-like, short dumbbell-like and polyhedron-like particles. In brief, with the increase in reduction temperature, obvious particle shrinkage would first occur and significant crystal growth would then happen, leading to the disappearance of pores, the decrease in axial length and the increase in particle size.\nThe composition of the reduced products depends on the reduction temperature too. The XRD patterns of the related samples are given in Fig. 2j. In detail, the diffraction peaks of O-450 can all be attributed to Fe2O3 (JCDPS-72-0469), indicating the successful oxidation of Fe-bdc. Owing to the insufficient reduction occurring at the lowest temperature, the characteristic peaks of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 can be simultaneously observed in the XRD pattern of HR-250. As for HR-350, the diffraction peaks should all be ascribed to Fe3O4, illustrating a higher reduction degree. While at temperatures higher than 550 \u00b0C, Fe2O3 can be completely converted to Fe according to the XRD pattern, revealing the highest reduction degree. In addition to the characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 and Fe, the peaks at 35.93\u00b0, 41.72\u00b0 and 60.48\u00b0, which can be attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of FeO (JCDPS-89-0687), can also be observed for HR-450.17 Namely, the medium temperature of 450 \u00b0C leads to a medium reduction degree. The elemental contents of the reduced products are provided in Fig. 2i as found from the EDS results. First of all, with the increase in reduction temperature (\u2264550 \u00b0C), the O contents constantly decrease from 41.92 wt%, 38.83 wt%, 35 wt% to 6.17 wt%, displaying a significant increase in reduction degree. Nevertheless,\nHR-650 has a higher O content of 15.83 wt%, which may be ascribed to the surface oxidation of Fe. Then, it is also worth mentioning that the changing trend of C contents is also consistent with that of O contents. On the one hand, carbon material may be incorporated in the reduced products, suggesting the existence of organic residues in O-450. On the other hand, the carbon material contributes to the reduction of iron oxides. Finally, the Fe contents are 28.01 wt%, 33.39 wt%, 45.2 wt%, 82.39 wt% and 64.74 wt% for HR-250, HR-350, HR-450, HR-550 and HR-650, respectively, which is in accordance with the gradual transformation from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO and Fe. In brief, HR-250, HR-350, HR-450, HR-550 and HR-650 should be Fe2O3/Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/FeO/Fe/ C, Fe/C and Fe/C composites, respectively. In order to estimate the graphitic degree of the existing carbon material, the Raman spectra have been recorded and are shown in Fig. S3.\u2020 An obvious D band can be observed for HR-250, revealing the existence of amorphous carbon. However, only a broad D band can be observed for HR-350 and HR-450, indicating more defects in amorphous carbon. While for HR-550 and HR-650, the signals of the D and G bands can seldom be received, resulting from the low content of carbon.\nThe TEM and HRTEM images of the typical reduced products are provided in Fig. 3.

As shown in Fig. 3d and e, the spacing of lattice fringes are 0.2537 nm and 0.2138 nm, corresponding to the (311) plane of Fe3O4 and the (200) plane of FeO, respectively, which further confirms the existence of Fe3O4 in HR-350 and FeO in HR-450. 22 Unfortunately, lattice fringes cannot be observed in HR-550, due to large particle size. Nevertheless, thin continuous layers of amorphous carbon can also be clearly observed on the particle surface.\nFull XPS spectra of the reduced products are shown in Fig. 4a. In detail, the signals of Fe 3p, Fe 3s, C 1s, O 1s, Fe 2p and Fe 2s can be captured for all samples, confirming the elemental composition of the reduced products. However, the other peaks may originate from impurities containing Na and Cl elements. Considering the reduction degree is highly associated with the chemical state of the Fe element, the Fe 2p highresolution XPS spectra of the reduced products are shown in Fig. 4b\u2013f and they can be deconvoluted into several characteristic peaks. According to Fig. 4b\u2013d, HR-250, HR-350 and HR-450 possess similar characteristic peaks, including the Fe2+ 2p3/2 peak at 711.9 eV, the Fe 2+ 2p1/2 peak at 725.9 eV, the Fe 3+ 2p3/2 peak at 710.1 eV, the Fe 3+ 2p3/2 peak at 723.6 eV and the corresponding satellite peaks at 715.6, 729.2, 718.8 and 732.4 eV.23 The existence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ coincides with the XRD patterns, illustrating the existence of Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and FeO in the composites. Within expectation, the characteristic peak of Fe0, located at 706.8 eV, can be clearly seen in the XPS spectra of HR-550 and HR-650.24 The appearance of Fe2+ and Fe3+ characteristic peaks should stem from the unavoidable surface oxidation. Overall, the reduction degree is basically improved\nwith reduction temperature, and it can be deduced that the content of Fe2+ and Fe0 may increase with the continuous loss of O element in Fe2O3.\nMagnetic hysteresis loops of reduced products are shown in Fig. 5. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of HR-250, HR-350, HR-450, HR-550 and HR-650 are approximately 50.14, 82.39, 104.96, 128.31 and 193.92 emu g\u22121, respectively. The corresponding coercivity (Hc) are 272.91, 353.93, 139.97, 54.18 and 30.61 Oe, respectively. It can be deduced that the saturation magnetization increases gradually with the increase in reduction temperature, which should be ascribed to the gradual transformation of nonmagnetic Fe2O3 into magnetic Fe3O4 and Fe with much higher Ms. While the coercivity first increases and then continuously decreases with the increase in reduction temperature. It is generally accepted that the larger crystal size (larger than critical size) would lead to a smaller Hc value.\n25 Increasing the reduction temperature could promote the growth of crystals. We should mention that the Hc of HR-350 is the largest, which may be attributed to the small crystal size and the existence of amorphous carbon and defects. Besides, the lower Ms values of HR-550 and HR-650 than pure Fe can also prove the existence of nonmagnetic carbon.\nThe complex permeability (\u03bcr) spectra of the reduced products are shown in Fig. 6a and b. The \u03bc\u2032 value of HR-250 goes down quickly from 1.42 at 2 GHz to 0.92 at 6 GHz and then\nFig. 4 (a) Full XPS spectra of the reduced products.

And the \u03bc\u2032 value of HR-350 quickly decreases from 1.65 at 2 GHz to 0.85 at 9 GHz and then rises to 1.09 at 18 GHz with a broad peak. As for HR-450, the \u03bc\u2032 value drops from 1.66 at 2 GHz to 1.04 at 10 GHz and slowly raises to 1.25 at 18 GHz. Howbeit, the \u03bc\u2032 value of HR-550 fluctuates from 1.70 at 2 GHz to 1.58 at 18 GHz, showing good frequency stability. Unexpectedly, the \u03bc\u2032 value of HR-650 shares a similar changing trend with that of HR-250, and HR-650 possesses the lowest \u03bc\u2032 in the testing frequency range. Obviously, HR-550 possesses the highest \u03bc\u2032 value, which is in good agreement with the second-highest Ms and second-lowest Hc values.\n26 The reason why HR-650 possesses the lowest \u03bc\u2032 value may be explained as: strong eddy current has decreased the magnetic field loaded on the testing sample and serious surface oxidation has caused the content decrease of Fe. Interestingly, HR-250 and HR-650 also possess similar \u03bc\u2033 values ranging between \u223c0.4 and \u223c\u22120.1, and it should be noted that negative \u03bc\u2033 can be obtained at high frequency. Similarly, the \u03bc\u2033 value of HR-350 decreases from 0.51 at 2 GHz to 0 at 8.9 GHz and becomes negative in the higher frequency range. According to previous research, the negative values may indicate the conversion of magnetic energy to electric energy.27 The magnetic loss tangents (tan \u03b4\u03bc) are further displayed in Fig. 6c. Owing to similar \u03bcr, HR-250 and HR-650 have similar tan \u03b4\u03bc, too. In the frequency range of 2\u20138 GHz, the tan \u03b4\u03bc values of HR-350 and HR-450 are similarly large, and the tan \u03b4\u03bc value of HR-550 is the smallest. In the X band, HR-450 possesses the highest tan \u03b4\u03bc values and HR-350 possesses the lowest tan \u03b4\u03bc values. In the Ku band, HR-450 and HR-550 share similar tan \u03b4\u03bc values, while the tan \u03b4\u03bc values of HR-250, HR-350 and HR-650 maintain a low level. As we know, magnetic loss in the microwave frequency range mainly includes natural resonance, exchange resonance and eddy current loss.28,29 The natural resonance frequencies ( fr) of HR-250, HR-350 and HR-450 are about 3\u20134 GHz, while the fr values of HR-550 and HR-650 are lower than 2 GHz, which is consistent with previous reports.30 To figure out the type of magnetic loss, C0 curves are shown in Fig. 6d, and if eddy current loss is the sole loss mechanism, C0 would remain constant with the variation of frequency.28\nC0 \u00bc \u03bc\u2033\u00f0\u03bc\u2032\u00de 2f 1 \u00bc 2\u03c0\u03bc0d 2\u03c3 \u00f03\u00de\nWe can see that in the Ku band, the C0 values of HR-250 and HR-650 change little with frequency, revealing that eddy current loss is the main magnetic loss mechanism. As for HR-550, the C0 value remains constant even in the wider frequency range of 6\u201318 GHz, resulting from the high content of conductive Fe with one-dimensional structural characteristics. Meanwhile, the C0 values of HR-350 and HR-450 also remain constant in the frequency range of 14\u201318 GHz, suggesting that eddy current loss occupies a major position in magnetic loss. To sum up, the \u03bcr values of HR-250, HR-350 and HR-450 drop quickly owing to natural resonance, but higher resistivity brings about multiple magnetic loss processes in the frequency range of 2\u201312 GHz. Owing to the high content of Fe,\nHR-550 has larger and steady \u03bcr, but strong eddy current loss dominates the magnetic loss from 6 to 18 GHz, which might be related to both high electrical conductivity and one-dimensional structure. HR-650 possesses the smallest \u03bcr, owing to serious surface oxidation and strong intra-particle eddy current.\nFig. 7a and b show the \u03b5\u2032 and \u03b5\u2033 spectra of the reduced products. In detail, the \u03b5\u2032 values of HR-250 decrease from 12.08 at 2 GHz to 8.76 at 18 GHz at a steady rate. The \u03b5\u2032 values of HR-350 decrease from 23.72 at 2 GHz to 11.26 at 12 GHz and then climb up to 14.20 at 18 GHz. The broad peak centered at 10 GHz can be observed in the corresponding \u03b5\u2033 spectra, which indicates a typical dielectric relaxation behavior. As for HR-450, the \u03b5\u2032 values remain steady except for the decrease from 14.68 at 6.30 GHz to 8.68 at 8.90 GHz. Similarly, a broad peak centered in 7.68 GHz can be observed, suggesting typical dielectric resonance behavior.31 The \u03b5\u2032 value of HR-550 is as high as 77.75 at 2 GHz and then it rapidly declines to 29.13 at 18 GHz. Corresponding \u03b5\u2033 values lie in the range of 30\u201340 and the dielectric relaxation peak can also be observed. Compared with HR-550, HR-650 has lower \u03b5\u2032 ranging from 33.74 to 12.47 and lower \u03b5\u2033 varying from 18.65 to 10.3, which should be ascribed to the disappearance of the one-dimensional structure and the possible surface oxidation. The dielectric loss constants (tan \u03b4\u03b5) of the reduced products are supplied in Fig. 7c. In detail, HR-350 exhibits higher tan \u03b4\u03b5 values than HR-250 in almost the whole frequency range, which should be attributed to the higher reduction degree. Moreover, HR-350 also owns higher tan \u03b4\u03b5 values than HR-450 in most"

Although HR-350 mainly contains Fe3O4 and amorphous carbon, its interconnected one-dimensional structure could promote the formation of percolation networks in the matrix and thus improve the electrical conductivity.32 As for HR-550, the highest tan \u03b4\u03b5 values can be achieved in almost the whole frequency range, when compared with samples obtained at lower reduction temperatures. Interestingly, HR-650 has the highest dielectric loss in the frequency range of 9.1\u201315.8 GHz, which may stem from high electrical conductivity and the limited storage capability of dielectric energy. In addition to conduction loss, polarization loss also comprises an important part of dielectric loss. Generally, polarization behavior can be estimated from the Cole\u2013Cole curves, in which one semicircle stands for one Debye relaxation process.33\n\u03b5\u2032 \u03b5s \u03b51 2 2 \u00fe\u00f0\u03b5\u2032\u2032\u00de2 \u00bc \u03b5s \u03b51 2 2 \u00f04\u00de As shown in Fig. 7d\u2013f, 4 semicircles can be seen in the Cole\u2013Cole plots of all the reduced products except HR-650, illustrating the existence of 4 kinds of polarization processes. While for HR-650, 5 kinds of polarization processes may occur under the influence of incident microwave. Generally, defects and interfaces can act as polarization centers and induce the dipole polarization behavior.34 It can be inferred that interfaces among Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, Fe and C would contribute to the multiple polarization. There may be more defects in HR-650, which may be related to the fast crystal growth, unavoidable surface oxidation and the existence of amorphous carbon. In a word, a higher reduction degree makes HR-350 own higher dielectric loss than HR-250 and a long one-dimensional structure ensures that HR-350 possesses higher electrical conductivity and dielectric loss than HR-450 at most of the frequencies. The highest electrical conductivity and complicated polarization processes should be the reason why HR-550 has a high dielectric loss, while more kinds of polarization processes might endow HR-650 with the highest dielectric loss in certain frequency ranges. Besides, the attenuation constants (\u03b1) of the reduced products are shown in Fig. S4\u2020 to comprehensively show the variation trend of electromagnetic attenuation ability. With the increase in frequency, the \u03b1 values would basically increase, revealing the enhanced attenuation ability at high frequency. In the whole frequency range, HR-250 has the lowest \u03b1, corresponding well with the low reduction degree. HR-350 and HR-450 own similar \u03b1, and the strong dielectric resonance behavior endows HR-450 with the stronger attenuation ability at around 8 GHz. Within expectation, HR-550 possesses the highest \u03b1 in the whole frequency range, resulting mainly from the highest \u03b5r. And majorly due to the second highest \u03b5r, HR-650 has the second highest \u03b1.\nIt is generally accepted that large \u03b5r and \u03bcr would help to decrease the matching thickness. The RL contour maps of the reduced products at matching thickness less than 2.0 mm are given as Fig. 8a\u2013e. It can be clearly seen that HR-250,\nHR-350 and HR-450 have good RL performance, while no effective absorption region can be found for HR-550 and HR-650. Obviously, the \u03b5r of HR-550 and HR-650 are much larger than \u03bcr, thereby causing the impedance mismatching and strong reflection. It should be noted that even at 1.0 mm, HR-350 and HR-450 are able to effectively weaken the reflected wave, which means that they have appropriate electromagnetic parameters in this situation. Fig. S5\u2020 provides the impedance matching ratios (Z, Z = |Zin/Z0|) of the reduced products at 1.2 mm. Excellent impedance matching would be realized if the Z value is near 1. Obviously, only HR-250, HR-350 and HR-450 show good impedance matching in the Ku band, which is the precondition of effective microwave absorption. Consequently, Fig. 8f summarizes the RL curves of the reduced products at an ultralow thickness of 1.2 mm. Although HR-250 has a suitable impedance, the weakest electromagnetic attenuation inevitably leads to the poor microwave absorption performance. Due to appropriate impedance and strong enough attenuation ability, the RL peak value of \u221243.77 dB can be obtained at 16.16 GHz for HR-350 and the corresponding EAB can reach 3.52 GHz. As for HR-450, an RL peak value of \u221226.16 dB can also be achieved at 17.36 GHz with an EAB of 2.32 GHz. On the basis of design theory for single-layer homogeneous absorber, RL curves, corresponding loss tangents and \u03bc\u2032/\u03b5\u2032 values in the frequency range of 2\u201318 GHz of HR-350 at 1.2 mm and HR-450 at 1.4 mm are summarized in Fig. 8g and h, respectively.35 First, under the premise of low matching thickness in the microwave range (namely low d/\u03bb values), tan \u03b4\u03bc is too low to meet the requirement of zero reflection. Then, the lower \u03bc\u2032/\u03b5\u2032 values and higher tan \u03b4\u03b5 would compensate for the low tan \u03b4\u03bc and the requirement of zero reflection can be approached. In detail, HR-350 owns a rather low \u03bc\u2032/\u03b5\u2032 value (\u223c0.09) and relatively high tan \u03b4\u03b5 (\u223c0.5), thus ensuring a broad EAB of 3.52 GHz at 1.20 mm. HR-450 possesses a higher \u03bc\u2032/\u03b5\u2032 value (\u223c0.11), lower tan \u03b4\u03b5 (\u223c0.35) but higher tan \u03b4\u03bc (\u223c0.1) and d/\u03bb value. As a consequence, a broader EAB of 3.72 GHz can be achieved at 1.40 mm, which directly exhibits the vital role of improving tan \u03b4\u03bc. When compared with similar MAMs, HR-350 shows superiority in both peak values and absorption bandwidths, which should be ascribed to the appropriate \u03b5r and \u03bcr in the high frequency range.36\u201340\nOn the basis of the above discussions, possible electromagnetic attenuation mechanisms of HR-350 are depicted as Fig. 9. First, the interconnected chain-like structure is in favor of electron transportation under an external electromagnetic field, thereby enhancing conduction loss. Second, the abundant interfaces and defects in Fe3O4/C composites would promote the accumulation of dipoles, which would consume the energy of the incident microwave through dipole orientation. Third, eddy current would be induced by incident microwave, and eddy current loss is the main magnetic loss mechanism in the frequency range of 14\u201318 GHz for HR-350. In addition, the semiconductive nature of Fe3O4 and the existence of amorphous carbon contribute to superior impedance matching."

The reduction temperature has a significant effect on the composition and structure, resulting in different electromagnetic properties. Upon increasing the reduction temperature, the samples were gradually converted\ninto Fe2O3/Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/C, Fe3O4/FeO/Fe/C and Fe/C composites. In the meantime, obvious particle shrinkage would first occur and significant crystal growth would then happen, leading to the disappearance of pores, a decrease in axial length and an increase in particle size. The results show that a higher reduction temperature leads to a higher reduction degree and higher \u03bcr, which should be related to the higher content of Fe. Nevertheless, unavoidable surface oxidation and strong intra-particle eddy current should be blamed for the smallest \u03bcr of HR-650. It is worth mentioning that eddy current loss dominates the magnetic loss in the frequency range of 14\u201318 GHz for all samples. A higher reduction temperature basically causes an increase in \u03b5r, which should mainly be ascribed to the increase in the content of conductive Fe. However, owing to the long one-dimensional structure, HR-350 possesses higher electrical conductivity and dielectric loss than HR-450. Similarly, HR-650 has a smaller \u03b5r than HR-550 due to surface oxidation and the collapse of the one-dimensional structure. With regard to the microwave absorption property of HR-350, the one-dimensional structure favors the construction of a conductive network.
