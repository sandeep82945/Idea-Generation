    "abstractText": "To reduce the inhibiting effects of polystyrene-based emulsion on the hydration process and strength development of cementitious materials, an amphiphilic diblock copolymer polystyrene-blockpoly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) was synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and demonstrated in cement paste system for improving the resistance to water absorption without significantly reducing 28-day compressive strength. Firstly, the dissolved PS-b-PAA was added into water, and it quickly self-assembled into amphiphilic 80 nm-sized micelles with hydrophobic polystyrene-based core and hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid)-based shell. The improved dispersion compared to that of polystyrene emulsion may minimize the inhibiting effects on strength development, as the effects of PS-b-PAA micelle as hydrophobic admixtures on rheological properties, compressive strength, water absorption, hydration process, and pore structure of 28-day cement pastes were subsequently investigated. In comparison with the control sample, the saturated water absorption amount of cement pastes with 0.4% PS-b-PAA was reduced by 20%, and the 28-day compressive strength was merely reduced by 2.5%. Besides, the significantly increased hydrophobicity instead of slightly decreased porosity of cement paste with PS-b-PAA may contribute more to the reduced water adsorption characteristics. The study based on prepared PS-b-PAA micelle suggested a promising alternative strategy for fabricating polystyrene-modified concrete with reduced water absorption and unaffected compressive strength.",

            "text": "Cement-based materials, as typical porous materials, contain a series of different pore structures, including capillary pores, gel pores, and C-S-H interlayer pores [1], of which connected capillary pores are the key transmission channels of invasive substances, leading to the deterioration of structures including freeze-thaw, carbonization, chemical erosion, steel corrosion and so on. In this process, erosive ions adsorbed to the surface cement-based materials will gradually diffuse and penetrate the matrix and cause damage. Meanwhile, the capillary water absorption phenomenon in pores will drive rapid transportation and cause the enrichment of aggressive ions [2]. To reduce the water adsorption of cementbased materials, a series of approaches, including the densification of hydrated products, optimization of pore structure, and hydrophobic modification, are proposed. In practical engineering applications, the reduced water adsorption of cement-based materials is generally achieved by tuning the water-binder ratio or using mineral admixtures. However, the reduced water-binder ratio may greatly affect the workability of fresh cement pastes, and the use of mineral admixtures such as silica fume or fly ash may reduce not only the early strength of hardened cement pastes but also increase the carbonization depth and the risk of shrinkage cracking [3\u20135]. Alternatively, much attention has been paid\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16062190 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 2 of 16\nto the introduction of inorganic nanomaterials or hydrophobic organic components with specific advantages. Although inorganic nanomaterials such as nano-SiO2 [6,7], TiO2 [8], Fe3O4 [9], and carbon nanomaterials [10] can fill the connecting pores and reduce the harmful pores, the serious aggregation of nanomaterials in cement slurries and required high dosage amount may cause limited effects, increased shrinkage and poor workability [11,12]. In contrast, the addition of hydrophobic organic components seems more efficient as the pore interfaces inside the cement-based materials could be easily modified by small amounts of organic components, including silanes [13\u201315], polymers [16\u201319], long-chain fatty acid/salts [20\u201322] and so on. However, as these water-insoluble components are inclined to float and aggregate on the surface of cement slurry during the mixing, a heterogeneous matrix with uneven hydrophobic and mechanical properties will be formed [23]. In addition, these components are easily adsorbed to the surface of cement particles, causing an insoluble calcium soap adsorption layer. This layer may significantly inhibit the hydration process and cause problems of the slow development of concrete strength and insufficient strength in the later stage [23\u201325]. To address the above-mentioned problem, recently, these hydrophobic organic components are usually designed as emulsified particle forms, as to improve the compatibility and stability of components in water [26\u201329]. The most common polymer particle in aqueous dispersions is latex [30], such as dispersed butadiene-styrene copolymer mediated by the use of surfactants. The addition of polymer particles results in decreased porosity, enhanced workability, and decreased water adsorption amount [31,32]. Besides, the hydration could also be retarded by the presence of the polymer, causing lower compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and hardness [31,33]. For instance, when butadiene styrene rubber (2.5\u20137.5% by weight of cement) was used as a cement modifier, improvements in properties contributing to the durability of concrete were discovered [30]. Liu investigated three types of polymer modifiers [18], including styrene-butadiene rubber latex, polyacrylic ester emulsion, and organic silicon waterproof agent (1\u20134% by weight of cement), and the incorporation of polymer modifier reduced the permeability of concrete and compressive strength. Despite the positive effects on impermeability, the preparation of emulsified polymer particles and control of the particle size both require massive efforts. And the emulsified particles may re-emulsify in humid alkaline conditions [29]. Besides, the applications based on dispersed polymer particles in core-shell structures are mostly limited to surface protection of cementitious materials [26\u201328], with barely any insights into the bulk water-repellent modification of cementitious materials. In this paper, amphiphilic micelles with core-shell nanostructure are innovatively applied as an organic admixture to enhance the water-repellency of cement pastes. Polystyrene, which is commonly used as a material replacement to enhance the water absorption properties of concrete [34], is selected as a representative hydrophobic component to demonstrate the viability of design on materials. Owing to the potential control on molecular weight/composition of amphiphilic diblock copolymer (BCP) polystyrene-blockpoly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) enabled by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT) [35], the micelle size and structure could be precisely tuned according to the specific demands. The satisfied compatibility with water is achieved by the self-assembled core-shell nanostructure of copolymers. The micro-morphology and microproperties of micelle were first characterized comprehensively. Meanwhile, the effects of different PS-b-PAA dosages (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4%) on the hydrophobicity, water resistance, compressive strength, and hydration process of cement paste were investigated. The gradual increased PS-b-PAA dosage significantly contributed to the decreased hydrophilicity of cement paste. For 0.4% wt dosage, the added micelles effectively reduced the water adsorption amount of cement paste by 20.1% at 56 h and successfully maintained 28-day compressive strength in comparison with the control sample. Besides, the governing factors for the increased water resistance were further analyzed. Herein, the study contributes to new references for the potential application of amphiphilic micelles consisting of block copolymers for bulk water-repellent modification of cement-based materials.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 3 of 16"

Characterization\nThe chemical structures of synthesized copolymers were analyzed with an instrument (1H NMR, Avance III HD 600 MHz, Bruker) using chloroform-d as the solvent. Size exclusion chromatography analysis was performed on an instrument (SEC, PL-GPC220, Agilent), and the number-average molecular weights (Mn) and molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn) were determined by SEC with polymer/tetrahydrofuran solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 40 \u25e6C and calibrated with polystyrene. The microstructure of the investigated PS-b-PAA micelle was conducted using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200X, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mineral compositions of cement paste were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TG, MDSC2910, American TG Company) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, SMARTLAB3KW, RIKEN Co., Ltd., Japan) with the range of 5\u201365\u25e6 and the step size of 0.02\u25e6. The XRD identification of hydration products was performed by calculating Bragg\u2019s relationship and automatically comparing it with Match software, making use of the PDF (Powder Diffraction File) database. For TG analysis, the CH content of the sample was estimated from Equation (1) [37].\nCH content = W400 \u2212W500 W800 \u00d7 mCH mH2O + W500 \u2212W800 W800 \u00d7 mCH mCaCO3\n(1)\nwhere W denotes the recorded weight at specific temperatures; 400 and 500 present the weight loss temperatures of CH at 400 \u25e6C and 500 \u25e6C, respectively, while 500 and 800 are weight loss temperatures of CaCO3 at 500 \u25e6C and 800 \u25e6C, respectively; mCH, mH2O, and mCaCO3 are the molecular mass of CH, H2O, and CaCO3, respectively. The dispersion test was performed to reveal the distinctive dispersion states of PSb-PAA and PS homo-polymer particles in water. The mean size and size distribution of PS-b-PAA micelle were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS, CGS-3, ALV Co.) using a wide-angle light scattering instrument, which can monitor particles in the size range 1 nm\u20135 \u00b5m. The PS-b-PAA micelle solution was treated in an ultrasonic bath for 2 min and then diluted to 1 mg/g using deionized water for DLS measurements. The zeta potentials of the PS-b-PAA micelle in water were measured with a DT310 zeta potential analyzer. The cement paste sample (the weight ratio of water to cement is 0.38) with PS-b-PAA micelle (0.2 wt% of cement paste) was stirred (low speed for 2 min and high speed for 2 min), and the rheological properties were tested by R/SP-SST stress-controlled cement rheometer containing a helix type geometry (Brookfield, WI, USA). Both the yield stress and plastic viscosity results of the cement paste were calculated through the Bingham model. Compressive strength and water absorption tests were carried out to measure the compressive strength and water absorption properties of control one and PS-b-PAA/cement paste at the age of 28 days, according to GB/T 50081-2019 [38]. The compressive strength of each cement sample was measured three times to obtain the averaged value, and the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 4 of 16\nwater absorption test used water as liquid to test the water absorption of each cement paste sample. The contact angle test was used to estimate the hydrophobicity of the matrix inside the cement paste at the age of 28 days. Water contact angles were recorded by a time-elapsed camera equipped with a drop-shape analysis system (JC2000D1, Powereach, Shanghai, China). Each value reported here was obtained by averaging values measured at five different spots on the same sample. The surfaces of hardened cement paste samples were polished before the measurements. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP, AutoporeV9605, Mike Instruments Co., Ltd., Hong Kong, China) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis (BET, Quadrasorb evo, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) with 2 MP gas adsorption analyzer at 77 K was adopted to investigate the pore distribution and specific area (estimated from BJH method) of cement paste samples. For XRD, TG, and BET analysis, crushed cement paste samples were all grounded manually through an 80 \u00b5m square-mesh sieve. The calorimetric test (micro-calorimeter, TAM Air, Tbilisi, Georgia) was applied to measure the hydration heat of the cement pastes. The cement powder was added into the calculated amount of PS-b-PAA micelle water solution and stirred for 2 min to form a paste, and then about 15 g of paste was weighed. The hydration heat test was started 10 min after the powder was contacted with water and recorded every 10 s. During the test, both the experimental temperature and the ambient temperature were maintained at 20 \u25e6C."

The SEC chromatography (Figure S1a) indicates a targeted molecular weight with narrow dispersity. The following step is the synthesis of the diblock copolymer. For the targeted copolymer, PS molar fraction (f PS) is approximately controlled, being 0.50, as the previous study suggested a relatively high PAA fraction for the well-dispersed spherical micelle. The SEC chromatography also indicates a nearly constant narrow dispersity of synthesized copolymer, and the chemical composition of synthesized copolymer could be further estimated by the shift towards a higher Mn regime. The estimated composition in the diblock copolymer is highly consistent with the feeding ratio of co-monomers, which indicates the potential of precise control on molecular weight and composition of PS-bPAA via RAFT polymerization. Besides, Figure S1b displays the 1H NMR spectrum of synthesized PS-b-PAA, and the characteristic peaks of protons from PS segments and the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 6 of 16\nbackbone of the copolymer are observed.

However, as the shear rate is gr dually increas , the hydrody amic effects may sta t to dominat all phenomena in the cement paste. Accordingly, a Newtonian plateau was observed in control and\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 8 of 16\nstudied cement paste samples, in which shear viscosity became less dependent on shear rate. Conclusively, the rheological curves of paste cement containing PS-b-PAA micelle are relatively similar to those of the control sample despite the differences at low shear rates. The fact indicates that the addition of prepared PS-b-PAA micelle as an admixture is applicable to fresh cement.\n3.2.2. Compressive Strength Test\nThe 28-day compressive strength of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 wt% PS-b-PAA micelle-doped cement paste samples are presented in Figure 5. For a relatively low dosage of 0.1% wt, no significant decrease in compressive strength was found. As the dosage is further increased to 0.4% wt, the change in compressive strength is still not significant, compared to that of the control sample. The results demonstrated that the added PS-b-PAA micelles minimize the negative effects on 28-day compressive strength, which is frequently reported in cement pastes containing polystyrene-based admixture. The improvements are possibly caused by the enhanced dispersity of polymer particles with hydrophilic shells, which may effectively reduce the retarding effects of hydrophobic polystyrene on the cement hydration process without forming any blocking layer preventing water diffusion.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 17\nThe 28-day compressive strength of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 wt% PS-b-PAA micelle-doped\ncement paste samples are presented in Figure 5.

Pore Structure Analysis\nBesides the hydrophobicity of the matrix, another factor governing the water resistance of paste cement is the pore structure inside the matrix. The pore size distributions of the control sample and 0.4 wt% doped one were characterized by MIP and BET, respectively. As presented in Figure 9 and Table 2, the cumulative pore volume of the control sample and 0.4 wt% doped one were relatively close, and the cumulative pore volume of 0.4 wt% doped sample was slightly lower than that of the control one, which is in response to the porosity of 23.2% slightly lower than 23.5% of control one. Besides, the estimated total pore area and median pore diameter of compared two samples were all similar, indicating an insignificant change in pore structure with the incorporation of PS-b-PAA micelle. According to the pore size distribution of cement paste, the pore size is generally categorized into the following four scopes: gel pores (3\u201310 nm), small capillary pores (10\u2013100 nm), big capillary pores (100 nm\u20131 \u00b5m) and macro pores (>1 \u00b5m). Since MIP characterization results revealed no obvious difference in capillary pores\u2019 structure, the potential change in the smallest gel pores became of great importance. Therefore, BET characterization was further carried out to reveal the gel pore structure. As shown in Figure S4 and Table S2, the estimated cumulative surface area of pores and volume of pores of 0.4 wt% doped sample within the tested scope were both 20% larger than those of the control one, which was possibly caused by the added averaged 80 nm-sized micelles with a high specific area. Thus, an increased pore volume was observed for pores larger than approximately 30 nm. Besides, the estimated average pore diameters of two compared samples corresponding to the observed peaks in Figure S4 were found both consistent with those estimated from MIP. In comparison with the control sample, the unchanged porosity and pore structure in the polymer doped sample indicated the unaffected hydration process of cement clinker, which further caused the insignificant compressive strength loss at 28 days.

(a) Cumulative pore volume and (b) incremental pore volume of control and BCP doped cement pastes samples collected from mercury i trusion porosimetry.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 13 of 16\nBased on the above comprehensive analysis of properties of cement paste, the main causes for the improved water resistance without any sacrificed compressive strength were concluded as follows:\n1. Improved dispersity of hydrophobic polystyrene. When nanometer-sized PS-b-PAA micelles are formed in the aqueous phase, an amphiphilic core-shell structure with hydrophobic PS segments surrounded by hydrophilic PAA is assembled. The surface of well-dispersed nanoparticles with rich charged carboxylic groups may avoid the commonly occurring aggregation of PS nanoparticles via the electrostatic repulsion. 2. Hydrophobic modification of the matrix. The added PS-b-PAA micelle significantly improves the hydrophobicity of the cement paste matrix compared with that of the control one. The carboxylic groups on micelle surfaces are possibly complex with the calcium ion from the hydration products, and the inner wall of the pore structure is thus covered by the hydrophobic PS segments. The bulk hydrophobic modification caused by PS segments further leads to the reduced water absorption of the cement paste matrix. 3. Unaffected hydration process and pore structure of cement paste. Although PAA segments in micelle may retard and inhibit the hydration process of cement clinker at an early stage, the adverse effects on hydration are considered less than those of polystyrene emulsion. For the control and doped samples, the hydration products and pore structure at late hydration time (7\u201328 days) are similar, and thus the compressive strength of cement paste is less affected by the added PS-b-PAA micelle."

The prepared PS-b-PAA self-assembled into an averaged 80-nm sized micelle with hydrophobic core/hydrophilic shell nanostructure in water, which was characterized by TEM, DLS, and zeta potential tests. The effects of micelles as admixture on cement paste were further investigated. The reduced water absorption, as well as unaffected compressive strength observed in macroscopic, were deeply investigated by the contact angle, calorimetry, XRD, TGA, MIP, BET, and other characterizations. The specific conclusions are drawn as follows:\n1. In the water phase, the hydrophilic core consisted of PS segments surrounded by the hydrophilic shell of PAA segments. The hydrophilic shell surface, along with the negatively charged carboxylic groups on the surface, may improve the dispersity of nanometer-sized PS particles, especially in a highly alkaline environment, compared to that of emulsified PS particles with micrometre size. 2. Compared with the control sample, the cement paste exhibited similar rheological behaviours, gradually reducing the water absorption amount and mostly unaffected compressive strength, as the dosage of PS-b-PAA micelle was increased from 0.1 wt% to 0.4 wt%. For a dosage of 0.4 wt%, the water absorption amount of cement paste at 56 h was reduced by 20.1% in comparison with the control sample. 3. The main contributor to enhanced water resistance was discovered to be the enhanced hydrophobicity of cement paste caused by the added copolymers, which were indicated by the measurements on initial contact angle and the time of macroscopic water absorption. Besides, the effects of added copolymers on the hydration process and pore structure of cement paste were not obvious, especially after 3\u201328 days of curing.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 2190 14 of 16\nThe less affected hydration degree and pore structure reasonably caused the mostly unchanged 28-day compressive strength of cement paste.\nIn summary, the advantages and application potential of amphiphilic PS-b-PAA micelle, as prospective substitutes for emulsified PS particles commonly used in cement/concrete, were demonstrated in this study. The water absorption resistance of cement paste could be effectively enhanced by a relatively low dosage of prepared PS-b-PAA micelle. Meanwhile, the strength loss caused by traditional PS emulsion was prevented. Therefore, the massive deterioration problems associated with water transportation, such as sulfate attack, chloride invasion, and freeze-thaw damage, could be addressed, and the service life of cement-based materials in harshly humid environments could be effectively extended with construction and cost convenience.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma16062190/s1, Figure S1: (a) SEC chromatography of PS-homopolymer with active RAFT groups and diblock copolymer PS-b-PAA following the sequential polymerization of acrylic acid monomers and (b) 1H NMR spectrum of synthesized PS-b-PAA in solvent chloroform -d.
