These materials have found a lot of applications in various industries from interior design and car paintings to cosmetics and fashion to packaging and print technologies. [1] At the same time, scientific works have been done to propose models to fully characterize the appearance of such materials. To this aim, bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) is an accepted model for homogenous surfaces that currently can be measured properly. Image-based methods exploit cameras to capture BRDF of all the adjacent points over a surface which is not homogenous in appearance, i.e., spatially varying BRDF (svBRDF). Although cameras provide high resolution and faster data recording, they lack spectral capabilities and enough dynamic range.\nIn metrological and specifically BRDF measurement setups, precision of data capture is significantly important. However, most of the materials show specularity and speckle properties and have a dynamic range higher than dynamic range of the cameras. Therefore, faithful data capture in image-based BRDF systems needs high dynamic range imaging (HDRI). In HDRI software methods, multiple images with different exposure times are merged into an image with a higher dynamic range. On the other hand, multispectral imaging (MSI) enhances spectral reconstruction and color accuracy by recording the reflected radiance in several spectral bands and improves spectral reflectance measurement consequently.\nThere are three main elements in HDRI: camera response\nfunction (CRF), weight function, and multiple images with different exposure times. Most HDRI methods differ in the way\nthey calculate CRF and therefore its assessment method affects the accuracy of the whole process. In this paper, the importance of CRF assessment method in multispectral HDRI is investigated in both radiance map reconstruction and reflectance measurements. In addition, the precision of results when CRF is measured/estimated for each filter separately is inquired, and results are evaluated by ground truth data captured by standard equipment."

From another point of view, CRFs can be divided into absolute and relative functions. In spite to relative CRFs, in absolute CRFs the scales and physical units are preserved, and the exact irradiance could be retrieved from digital counts (camera responses). Therefore, the output of both CRF measurement and estimation methods can be either absolute or relative CRF function depending on the method.\nWhile ISO 14524 describes a standard method for the measurement of absolute opto-electronic conversion functions of imaging systems including CRF by means of a specific test chart [2], in a similar approach Martinez et al. [3] used a classic ColorChecker (CC24) to measure absolute CRF. In another work, Guarnera et al. [4] exploited a projector to measure opto-electronic conversion transform. Brauers et al. [5] used an integrating sphere and a precise optical setup to measure relative CRF. On the other hand, many methods have been proposed to estimate CRF from a set of images taken from a scene with proper bracketing. The most successful works could be mentioned as methods proposed by Mann and Picard [6], Debevec and Malik [7], Mitsunaga and Nayar [8], and Robertson et al [9]."

This is because of the low dynamic range of the camera. Figure 1 shows the CRF of a same camera used in this project. This camera is able to capture around 2.5 orders of magnitude while the dynamic range of the real-world objects is beyond this amount. In order to solve this problem, HDRI has been proposed and addressed in a lot of works in the literature. [13] and [14] cover HDRI comprehensively.\nIn general, two approaches are proposed for HDRI: software methods and hardware methods. In this work, the focus is on software methods. The concept of HDRI software methods is illustrated in Figure 2. Although the dynamic range of a given camera cannot be changed but by changing some settings including exposure time and aperture size, the minimum and maximum values of its dynamic range could be controlled. Figure 2 shows that by capturing multiple images with different exposure times and merging them together, a higher dynamic range could be reached.\nFigure 2 illustrates the workflow of HDRI. Multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images are merged using Equation (2) and the HDR irradiance map is constructed.

These values give the total radiance reaching the camera for the given filters. These values are then multiplied by the corresponding camera exposure times and results are called pseudo-exposure. The camera filter transmittances and corresponding ideal bandpass filters are shown in Figure 4.\nAfterwards, TSR is replaced with the multispectral camera\nand the CC24 is captured under the same illumination and imaging geometry with multiple exposure times. Subsequently, camera responses of 24 patches are calculated using taking average from a number of pixels approximately corresponding to the same area seen by the TSR. Finally, CRF is reconstructed from plotting corresponding pseudo-exposures and digital counts calculated from camera responses of 24 patches.

[7] However, since this method is a relative CRF estimation, ground truth data capture by TSR is not required. Some sample images as inputs for this method are shown in Figure 6 for the 4th filter (570 nm).\nThe linear part of CRFs measured and estimated, after linear fitting and expanding to the whole digital counts range, are illustrated in Figure 7. In the measured CRF, (Figure 7-a), different channels have different behaviors because not only the corresponding filters have different transmittance shapes, but also spectral sensor responsivity has different characteristic in different channels. This is not the case for the estimation method as it mainly affects the slope and in relative measurement it does not matter too much.\nIS&T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging 2022 Color Imaging XXVII: Displaying, Processing, Hardcopy, and Applications 141-3\nRadiance map reconstruction and reflectance calculation\nA subset of images taken for absolute CRF measurement consist of six exposure times: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 ms are selected for radiance map reconstruction and reflectance calculation which are reasonable exposures avoiding too much under and over exposures. The same images are used as input data for both HDRI with relative CRF estimation and absolute CRF measurement methods. The reconstruction error analysis, error between HDRI output and ground truth, has been done using root mean square error (RMSE) metric defined as:\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38 = \u221a \u2211 (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\u2212 ?\u0302?\ud835\udc58)\n2\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc58=1\n\ud835\udc41 (4)\nthat \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 indicates measured radiance or reflectance in k th channel, N\nrepresents number of channels, and ?\u0302?\ud835\udc58 is the corresponding ground truth data."

Since ground truth data is a spot measurement, the same areas seen by the TSR are averaged from radiance map images corresponding to 24 patches of CC24 and used for data analysis. The spectral radiances, with six spectral channels, calculated from HDR images reconstructed using CRF measurement method are compared to ground truth data. Figure 8 shows the spectral radiance of the first 6 patches, and RMSEs are represented in Figure 9 for all the 24 patches.

Figure\n9 shows that the measurement error for patches with higher luminance is greater than darker patches and the 19th patch with the highest luminance has the largest error value among others. This analysis implies that the performance of HDRI with the CRF measurement method is acceptable with regards to radiance measurement and the outputs are in the same scale and physical units as standard measurement systems while HDRI with estimation method outputs relative radiances, and it does not have meaning to compare its results with the ground truth.\n141-4 IS&T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging 2022 Color Imaging XXVII: Displaying, Processing, Hardcopy, and Applications"

As an example, Figure 10 illustrates reflectance of the first patch measured by two methods as well as TSR. The RMSEs are calculated with two approaches: in the first approach, the spectral reflectances, 6 channels, are obtained for the 24 patches and compared to the ground truth data. Table 1 summarizes the accuracy of reflectance measurement by two methods. The error is reported 0.0185 and 0.0313 as average error and 0.0080 and 0.0130 as standard deviation for CRF measurement and CRF estimation methods respectively, and obviously the measurement outperformed the estimation method as its average error is almost half of the other method.\nIn the second approach, the RMSE error of each spectral band is analyzed separately to evaluate the efficiency of different methods in reflectance measurement in different spectral channels. Table 1 indicates that as expected, measurement method has a better performance in channel-wise analysis as well since it has half average RMSE of the other method. Figure 11 presents bar plot of reflectance measurement errors. It is obvious that the HDRI with measured absolute CRF has outperformed the other method in all the spectral channels and all the CC24 patches. In Figure 11-(a), the error for patch number 19 equals to zero because it had been used as the reference white in the experiment. Figure 12 represents the errors in boxplot to provide a better visualization of the distribution of reflectance measurement errors."

            "text": "In this paper, the evaluation of multispectral HDRI is addressed with regards to different CRF assessment methods. Two\ndifferent methods of CRF assessment have been implemented: in the first method absolute CRF is measured by means of reflective color charts and in the second method relative CRF is estimated through a well-known estimation method. HDRI is exploited to construct radiance map utilizing both CRFs and results are evaluated by comparing to the TSR measurements as ground truth. Radiances measured by camera using HDRI and measured absolute CRF matches with ground truth, but a significant mismatch is reported for HDRI using estimated relative CRF due to its relative behavior. However, reflectances are also calculated and results showed the reflectance measurement accuracy outperformed by the absolute CRF measurement method. This work is relevant since precision of HDRI is crucial in metrological measurements such as svBRDF devices. Although specularities in material are of higher dynamic range than the tested scene but there is little risk that the conclusion would differ. In addition, this comparison helps industries to opt a proper method between CRF estimation and cumbersome measurement methods in their products.\nAs for directions for further work, experiments with larger data capture, and including spectral reconstruction are suggested. Using HDR scenes in the final evaluation and cameras with different filter transmittances would show the importance of this investigation better than LDR scenes.\nIS&T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging 2022 Color Imaging XXVII: Displaying, Processing, Hardcopy, and Applications 141-5"
