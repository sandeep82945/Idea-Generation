1. **Investigate the mechanisms underlying the negative effects of certain functional groups in biochar on biogas production.** This could involve studying the interactions between biochar, microorganisms, and the environment in biogas production systems.
2. **Develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of biochar on biogas production.** This could involve modifying the surface properties of biochar or using alternative biochar additives.
3. **Investigate the long-term effects of biochar on biogas production.** This could involve studying the effects of biochar on microbial communities and the stability of anaerobic digestion systems over time.
4. **Develop models to predict the effects of biochar on biogas production.** This could involve using machine learning or other statistical techniques to develop models that can predict the effects of biochar on biogas production based on its molecular properties and the characteristics of the anaerobic digestion system.
5. **Conduct pilot-scale studies to evaluate the feasibility of using biochar in biogas production systems.** This could involve testing different types of biochar and different strategies for mitigating its negative effects in real-world conditions.
