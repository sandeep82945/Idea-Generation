    "abstractText": "The operation of near-term quantum technologies requires the development of feasible, implementable, and robust strategies of controlling complex many body systems. To this end, a variety of techniques, so-called \u201cshortcuts to adiabaticty\u201d, have been developed. Many of these shortcuts have already been demonstrated to be powerful and implementable in distinct scenarios. Yet, it is often also desirable to have additional, approximate strategies available, that are applicable to a large class of systems. In this work, we hence take inspiration from thermodynamics and propose to focus on the macrostate, rather than the microstate. Adiabatic dynamics can then be identified as such processes that preserve the equation of state, and systematic corrections are obtained from adiabatic perturbation theory. We demonstrate this approach by improving upon fast quasiadiabatic driving, and by applying the method to the quantum Ising chain in the transverse field.",

            "text": "Shortcuts to thermodynamic quasistaticity\nArtur Soriani,1, \u2217 Eduardo Miranda,1 Sebastian Deffner,2 and Marcus V. S. Bonanc\u0327a1 1Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sa\u0303o Paulo 13083\u2013950, Brazil 2Department of Physics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, USA\n(Dated: October 21, 2022)\nThe operation of near-term quantum technologies requires the development of feasible, implementable, and robust strategies of controlling complex many body systems. To this end, a variety of techniques, so-called \u201cshortcuts to adiabaticty\u201d, have been developed. Many of these shortcuts have already been demonstrated to be powerful and implementable in distinct scenarios. Yet, it is often also desirable to have additional, approximate strategies available, that are applicable to a large class of systems. In this work, we hence take inspiration from thermodynamics and propose to focus on the macrostate, rather than the microstate. Adiabatic dynamics can then be identified as such processes that preserve the equation of state, and systematic corrections are obtained from adiabatic perturbation theory. We demonstrate this approach by improving upon fast quasiadiabatic driving, and by applying the method to the quantum Ising chain in the transverse field.\nThe word \u201cadiabatic\u201d is derived from the Greek adiabatos, which means literally \u201cimpassable\u201d. In thermodynamics, an adiabatic constraint is a \u201cwall\u201d that is impassable to heat, and thus an adiabatic process is a thermodynamic state transformation during which no heat is exchanged [1]. However, the notion of adiabaticity has found a much broader application in Hamiltonian dynamics [2]. In classical mechanics, an \u201cadiabatic invariant\u201d is any quantity that remains constant under the Hamiltonian equations of motion, given infinitely slow variations of the Hamiltonian [2].\nThis insight led Born to the formulation of the quantum adiabatic theorem [3], which states that, during infinitely slow variation of the Hamiltonian, no transitions between energy levels occur. Obviously, such adiabatic processes are highly desirable in quantum technological applications. Recent years have seen tremendous research efforts in facilitating such excitation-free processes with finite time driving. Under the umbrella of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) [4, 5] a large variety of techniques has been developed, of which counterdiabatic driving [6\u201311], invariant based inverse engineering protocols [12\u201316], and the fast-forward technique [17\u201323] have arguably received the most attention, with applications in vastly different physical scenarios. For instance, counterdiabatic driving is particularly well-suited to optimally control the dynamics of cold ion traps [24, 25]. However, implementing STA in more complex quantum system can become rather involved [26\u201331]. Thus, it appears very desirable to find alternative and approximate schemes, that may provide more universally applicable control strategies. This has already led to the development of \u201cresource friendly\u201d control strategies [32\u201337], that provide alternative means to suppress excitations arising from populating energetically high-lying microstates.\nOne of the main causes for the complexity of finding realistically useful STA rests in the fact that, to a certain degree, all methods originate in circumventing the quantum adiabatic theorem [3]. Hence, the focus is on preserving\nthe occupation probabilities of the energy eigenstates, i.e., microstates [1]. However, in most experimental settings quantum states cannot be easily measured; rather, thermodynamic observables are monitored. Therefore, thermodynamic control has been suggested as a possible way to construct approximate STA [38], see Ref. [39] for a recent perspective. However, thermodynamic control methods are usually applied with a focus on lowering the energetic cost of a given thermodynamic process [40\u201344].\nIn the present letter, we change the paradigm of this approach by proposing genuine shortcuts to thermodynamic quasistaticity. To this end, we fully accept the thermodynamic mind set, namely, we seek STA that preserve the adiabatic macrostate and not the occupations of microscopic energy eigenstates of a quantum system. Hence, we demand that the macrostate of a driven system (approximately) fulfills an instantaneous equation of state. Such a control strategy is constructed by exploiting adiabatic perturbation theory [45], which has recently proven powerful in assessing nonequilibrium excitations in driven quantum Ising chains [46, 47]. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we benchmark our results against other STA, in particular, against fast quasiadiabatic driving [48\u201351], which is closest in spirit to our approach.\nPreliminaries We start by establishing notions and notations. Consider a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian H(\u03bb) = \u2211 nEn(\u03bb) |n(\u03bb)\u3009 \u3008n(\u03bb)|, where En(\u03bb) and |n(\u03bb)\u3009 are parametric, nondegenerate eigenvalues and eigenstates, respectively. Moreover, \u03bb is an external control parameter, such as the volume of a gas container or a magnetic field. In the following, we will be interested in thermodynamic state transformations that are driven by varying \u03bb = \u03bb(t) (also called a protocol), between times ti and tf , taking the external parameter from an initial value \u03bbi to a final value \u03bbf . Moreover, we assume that the quantum system is thermally insulated, and therefore, its time evolution is unitary. Note that unitary dynamics are necessarily thermodynamically adiabatic in the traditional sense, since no heat is exchanged. Thus, unless otherwise stated, ar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n12 44\n5v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 9\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2 \u201cadiabatic\u201d means \u201cquasistatic\u201d henceforth. We further assume that the system is initially prepared in a quantum state that is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, \u03c1i = \u2211 n pn |ni\u3009 \u3008ni|, where the subscript i means that a given quantity is evaluated at ti, and |ni\u3009 = |n(\u03bbi)\u3009. The time-dependent state is then determined by the von Neumann equation, i~ \u03c1\u0307(t) = [H(\u03bb), \u03c1(t)], and we denote derivatives with respect to time by a dot.\nIt is worth emphasizing that, even if the initial state, \u03c1i, is chosen to be an equilibrium state, \u03c1(t > ti) may be arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Given an initially canonical state [\u03c1i \u221d exp (\u2212\u03b2Hi)], even an infinitely slow process will generally not keep the system in canonical equilibrium. This is because the quasistatic evolution preserves the statistical weights in the initial Hamiltonian. However, in the present analysis, our main focus is also not the microstate, but rather the thermodynamic macrostate.\nIn (quantum) thermodynamics, a macrostate is fully characterized by its state variables [1, 52], which fulfill an equation of state (EOS). At any instant, the EOS can be obtained by calculating the equilibrium average of the generalized force, F (\u03bb), which is given by [1]\nF (\u03bb) = \u2212\u2202H(\u03bb) \u2202\u03bb , (1)\nand \u039b \u2261 tr {\u03c1F} is the state variable conjugate to \u03bb. For any driven process, and writing the time-dependent quantum state as \u03c1(t) = \u2211 n pn |\u03c8n(t)\u3009 \u3008\u03c8n(t)|, the corresponding average generalized force reads\n\u039b(t) = \u2211\nn\npn \u3008\u03c8n(t)|F (\u03bb)|\u03c8n(t)\u3009 . (2)\nHere, |\u03c8n(t)\u3009 is a solution of the corresponding Schro\u0308dinger equation.\nThermodynamic state transformations Before we analyze the more general out of equilibrium situation, we inspect Eq. (2) in the adiabatic limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. The adiabatic theorem dictates that, if the evolution is slow enough, the solution to Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s equation can be written as [53]\n|\u03c8(0)n (t)\u3009 = ei\u03c6n(t) |n(\u03bb)\u3009 , (3)\nwhere the superscript (0) denotes the adiabatic limit and \u03c6n(t) is the usual adiabatic phase (dynamic plus geometric). In this case, Eq. (2) simplifies to\n\u039b(0) = \u2211\nn\npnFnn(\u03bb), (4)\nwhere Fmn(\u03bb) = \u3008m(\u03bb)|F (\u03bb)|n(\u03bb)\u3009. Notice the lack of explicit time dependence in Eq. (4): this is the conventional EOS. For infinitely slow variations of \u03bb, Eq. (4) describes the evolution of the macroscopic state in any mechanically adiabatic (and thermodynamically adiabatic) process, i.e., for a thermodynamic state transformation.\nBeyond the adiabatic limit Using adiabatic perturbation theory (APT), whose details we leave for the Supplemental material [54], we can systematically compute finitetime corrections to the EOS (4). Using Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) of the Supplemental Material [54] in Eq. (2) and keeping terms up to O(\u03c4\u22121), the first-order correction becomes \u039b(1)(t) = \u2211\nm,n m 6=n\npn< { 2C(1)mn(t)F \u2217 mn(\u03bb) }\n= 2~\u03bb\u0307i \u2211\nm,n m 6=n\npn= { Fmn,i ei\u03c6mn(t)\nE2mn,i F \u2217mn(\u03bb)\n} , (5)\nwhere we used the fact that the product of F \u2217mn(\u03bb) and the first term of Eq. (2) of the Supplemental Material [54] is purely imaginary. We immediately observe that the firstorder correction to the EOS is directly proportional to the time derivative of the external parameter at the beginning of the process. Hence, for all protocols with \u03bb\u0307i = 0, the EOS is preserved up toO(\u03c4\u22122) in any sufficiently slow process. We stress that this conclusion is independent of the Hamiltonian considered, only depending on the validity of APT. Thus, we have unveiled a universal design principle for optimal control strategies applicable in any gapped quantum system, simple as well as complex.\nStrategies where the time derivatives of the protocols vanish at the end points of the evolution have already been discussed as ways to guarantee adiabaticity in the microstate [55\u201358]. However, we emphasize that the firstorder result for the macrostate only depends on the initial derivative, and not the final derivative. This still leaves a lot of freedom in finding \u201coptimal\u201d and experimentally implementable protocols. Thus, it should be obvious that even better results can be achieved by complementing our macroscopic strategy with microscopic methods.\nFast quasiadiabatic driving One strategy to ensure APT convergence is the application of fast quasiadiabatic (FQA) protocols [48\u201351] and related approaches [5]. If there is only one relevant energy gap Emn(\u03bb) in the quantum system, FQA provides a protocol \u03bb(t) for which firstorder APT transitions between eigenstates m and n are equally likely at any instant. This protocol is the solution to a first order differential equation [48\u201351]\n~ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03bb\u0307(t)Fmn(\u03bb)\nE2mn(\u03bb)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = c1, (6)\nwhere c1 is a constant that, together with the integration constant, is uniquely defined by the boundary conditions \u03bb(ti) = \u03bbi and \u03bb(tf ) = \u03bbf . For a generic protocol, microscopic adiabaticity is secured if the left-hand side of Eq. (6) is much smaller than unity for any t, the quantitative adiabatic condition [59, 60] [Eq. (4) of the Supplemental Material [54]].

FQA\u2019s advantage is that it naturally slows down whereEmn(\u03bb) is small [see Eq. (6)], and thus, it may reach the adiabatic condition and make APT converge for a smaller \u03c4 , when compared to a generic protocol.\nCuriously, FQA is limited to suppressing first-order transitions. The authors of Ref. [51] remark that considering transitions of higher-than-one order APT is not possible, since the associated differential equation would not have enough constants to satisfy the boundary conditions on \u03bb and its derivatives. For example, demanding the secondorder APT transition probabilities to be uniform along the process gives a second-order differential equation,\n~2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n1\nEmn(\u03bb)\nd\ndt\n( \u03bb\u0307(t)Fmn(\u03bb)\nE2mn(\u03bb)\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = c2, (7)\nwhich was obtained from Eq. (6) with the proper substitution to second order coefficients, discussed in the Supplemental Material [54]. The three available constants (c2 plus two integration constants) in the solution of Eq. (7) are insufficient to satisfy the four boundary conditions \u2014 two on \u03bb (same as FQA) and two on \u03bb\u0307, which are necessary to make the second-order APT correction be the relevant correction.\nAbove, we have seen that, from the macroscopic dynamics, Eq. (5), optimal driving protocols obey \u03bb\u0307 = 0 at the beginning (and not at the end). This additional condition permits us to uniquely solve Eq. (7), if we impose the same boundary conditions as the FQA method plus \u03bb\u0307(ti) = 0, which leads to c2 \u221d \u03c4\u22122. We will be referring to this strategy as FQ2, and as we will see shortly, FQ2 clearly outperforms FQA. We once again bring attention to the fact that making \u03bb\u0307(ti) = 0 gives null first order APT correction for the EOS of any gapped system. Equations (6) and (7),\nwhich do depend on the system through its eigenspectrum, are primarily used to guarantee early APT validity and can be applied even when the Hamiltonian is only numerically diagonalizable. In fact, at low temperature, knowledge of only a few eigenlevels may be necessary, since only transitions between the lowest energy eigenstates are relevant (see Fig. 2 of the Supplemental Material [54]).\nIllustrative example: quantum Ising chain We now apply the above developed strategy to control a thermodynamically relevant, exactly solvable system: the transverse field Ising model (TI) [61, 62]. The Hamiltonian reads\nHTI(\u0393) = \u2212 1\n2\n( J N\u2211\nj=1\n\u03c3zj\u03c3 z j+1 + \u0393\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u03c3xj\n) , (8)\nwhere J is the coupling constant, \u0393 is the external magnetic field and \u03c3x,zj are standard Pauli matrices for each spin j (with periodic boundary conditions). In the thermodynamic limit N \u2192\u221e, this system displays a quantum critical point (QCP) at \u0393 = J , where the energy gap between ground and first excited states vanishes. For simplicity, we assume N to be even and that the system is initially prepared in its ground state. The force is FTI = \u2211N j=1 \u03c3 x j /2, while the nonequilibrium magnetization per spin reads\n\u00b5(t) = 1\n2N\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u2329 \u03c3xj \u232a (t). (9)\nIn any finite time process, the magnetization can be separated into an adiabatic contribution \u00b5(0) and an excess contribution \u00b5ex. Details for how to calculate the nonequilibrium average in Eq. (9) can be found in the Supplemental Material [54].\n4 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 EOS LIN UQA UQ2\n(a)\n10 20 50 100\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8 LIN UQA UQ2\n(b)\nFIG. 2. Magnetization of the TI chain in the QCP crossing process starting at zero temperature with N = 100. The results of both panels were numerically obtained from the exact time-dependent dynamics. (a) State diagram of the TI chain for an adiabatic (quasistatic) evolution (EOS), the LIN, the UQA, and the UQ2 protocols for J\u03c4 = 50, starting from the top right corner. The inset shows the time dependence of each protocol. (b) Excess magnetization \u00b5ex = \u00b5\u2212 \u00b5(0) at the end of the process vs process duration.\nFirst, we consider a process keeping the chain entirely in its paramagnetic phase (\u0393 > J ) and starting at zero temperature, i.e., with the chain initially prepared in its ground state. We solve FQA and FQ2 for the smallest gap of the system and compare them to a naive linear protocol (LIN) \u2014 the results for a chain of finite size are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1a, we show \u00b5 of Eq. (9) vs \u0393 in a process that approaches, but does not cross, the QCP. The inset contains the time-dependence of each protocol, where it can be seen that both FQA and FQ2 adapt to the system\u2019s spectrum, but FQ2 does so while still keeping null first derivative at the start. FQA has a very high first derivative at the initial time, and this ultimately makes its evolution have notable oscillations around the EOS. On the other hand, LIN follows the EOS closely, up until a point where the gap gets too small, and it ends up breaking adiabaticity. Finally, FQ2 follows the EOS right until the end, which is a consequence of its compromise to attain adiabaticity while zeroing the first order correction to the EOS. In Fig. 1b, we depict the excess magnetization \u00b5ex at tf as a function of \u03c4 . It is clear that FQ2 outperforms FQA for a generic \u03c4 , even if FQ2 first crosses the \u201cadiabatic\u201d \u00b5ex = 0 line for a marginally bigger \u03c4 than FQA.\nAs a second case, we consider the crossing of the QCP, from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase. In a finite size chain, the gap at the QCP is small but nonzero, which makes adiabaticity difficult but possible to achieve. In this scenario, the smallness of the energy gap forces the FQA protocol to slow down dramatically around the QCP and, consequently, to speed up around the end points. This speed-up is detrimental in the ferromagnetic phase of the TI chain, where the gap of many other sublevels are comparable to the gap of the lowest sub-level\n(see Fig. 1 of the Supplemental Material [54]). Other energy differences can be taken into account when building FQA protocols (see Ref. [63]), but the associated differential equation is not exactly solvable and hardly numerically solvable when traversing the QCP. Thus, to circumvent this issue, we apply a similar strategy known as uniform quasi-adiabatic (UQA) [64] to the lowest sub-level of the TI chain. It is the solution to Eq. (6) with the substitution Fmn(\u03bb) \u2192 \u2202\u03bbEmn(\u03bb) [5], motivated by the KibbleZurek mechanism of second-order quantum phase transitions. Thus, we define a UQ2 protocol as the solution of Eq. (7) with the aforementioned substitution, and we compare it to LIN and UQA in Fig. 2. Figure 2a is the equivalent of Fig. 1a, but with a considerably larger process duration, which evidences the difficulty of crossing the QCP while maintaining adiabaticity (in the mechanical sense). The inset once again shows the time-dependence of each strategy, and it is clear that both UQA and UQ2 slow down around the QCP. The conclusion is the same as in the paramagnetic process: UQ2 follows the EOS more closely. Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 2b, UQ2 gives final \u00b5ex = 0 for a significantly smaller \u03c4 than the other two protocols, which is a consequence of its final first derivative also being null at the end point (see inset of Fig. 2a).\nConcluding remarks Controlling complex many body quantum systems is an involved task. While some strategies have been successfully employed in platforms with great technological promise, such as counterdiabatic driving in ion traps [24, 25], more universally applicable paradigms appear desirable. To this end, we have proposed to take inspiration from the mother of all control theories \u2014 thermodynamics. Rather than aiming to control the microstate, we have suggested controlling the macrostate and\n5 identifying protocols that preserve the equation of state. This approach is somewhat akin to invariant based strategies [5, 13], on which we comment in the Supplemental Material [54], where we study thermodynamic shortcuts for the driven harmonic oscillator [65\u201367]. However, our approach significantly goes beyond existing methods, since using adiabatic perturbation theory, finite-time corrections can be systematically computed, which gives systematic conditions for the optimal driving protocols. The utility of the approach has been demonstrated by improving upon fast quasiadiabatic driving, and its applicability has been demonstrated for the driven Ising chain.\nThe analyses of state diagrams demonstrate the difference between microscopic adiabaticity and macroscopic adiabaticity. More specifically, strategies that are better suited for parametric following of microstates (eigenstates) are not necessarily better for parametric following of macrostates (state variables). It is also worth noting that a notion of relaxation time seems to be absent, which is perhaps expected in isolated systems where relaxation to some sort of equilibrium is not guaranteed. Nonetheless, there is still the notion of a timescale with which the driving rate must be compared, related to the energy gap between eigenstates. Last, it is interesting to see that, even though it is possible to stay close to the equation of state in finite time driving, such possibility a does not lead to thermodynamic reversibility. In other words, applying the same \u201coptimal\u201d protocol in the reverse process does not give the same curve in the state diagram as in the forward process and, in fact, the FQ2 strategy we devised to better follow the equation of state does not provide protocols with time-reversal symmetry.\nFinally, we note that the present paper fills the gap in a hierarchy of strategies developed for securing adiabaticity in finite time. First, there are standard shortcuts to adiabaticity, where one seeks to follow the parametric eigenstates of the system. Second, we have the thermodynamic shortcuts introduced in the present letter, which follow the equation of state. Third, we have the methods from thermodynamic control, where the focus is on making sure that the energetic cost of a certain manipulation of the system is as close as possible to the cost in a quasistatic process. It is expected that the further down you go in the hierarchy, the less information is needed to determine the associated optimal driving protocol.\nA. S. and M. V. S.

An exact solution of the Schro\u0308dinger equation can be written as\n|\u03c8n(t)\u3009 = ei\u03c6n(t) \u221e\u2211\np=0\n\u2211\nm\nC(p)mn(t) |m(\u03bb)\u3009 , (1)\nwhere \u03c6n(t) is the adiabatic phase and the coefficients C(p)mn(t) represent the pth order corrections to the adiabatic solution, which is Eq. (3) of the main text. For p = 0, we simply have C(0)mn(t) = \u03b4mn, and Eq. (1) truncated at this order reproduces the adiabatic approximation.\nFor p > 0, the coefficientsC(p)mn(t) can be systematically calculated [1]. For instance, for p = 1 andm 6= n we have\nC(1)mn(t) = i~ ( Mmn(\u03bb)\nEmn(\u03bb) \u2212 ei\u03c6mn(t)Mmn,i Emn,i\n) , (2)\nwhere\nMmn(t) = \u03bb\u0307(t) Fmn(\u03bb)\nEmn(\u03bb) , (3)\nFmn are the matrix elements of the generalized force [Eq. (1) of the main text] and we introduced Emn(\u03bb) \u2261 Em(\u03bb)\u2212 En(\u03bb) and \u03c6mn(t) \u2261 \u03c6m(t)\u2212 \u03c6n(t).\nFor the purposes discussed here, higher order coefficients can be obtained from the first order coefficient with iterative substitutions. For example, C(2)mn with m 6= n is given by Eq. (2) with the change Mmn(t) \u2192 i~ ddt Mmn(t) Emn(\u03bb) . We can gauge how accurate the theory is by using the socalled quantitative adiabatic condition [2, 3]\n~ Mmn(t)\nEmn(\u03bb) 1, (4)\nwhich can be evaluated at any point in time t of a given process.\nTransverse field Ising chain The Hamiltonian of the system is given in Eq. (8) of the main text. We assume an even number of spins and periodic boundary conditions, while taking ~ = 1. After a Jordan-Wigner transform, a Fourier transform and a Boguliobov transform [4], this Hamiltonian is brought to diagonal form, represented by non-interacting fermions with dispersion\nk(\u0393) =\n\u221a (\u0393\u2212 J cos k)2 + J2 sin2 k, (5)\nfor N allowed values of momentum\nkn = (2n+ 1) \u03c0\nN , (6)\ngiven integer n between \u2212N/2 and N/2 \u2212 1. Figure 1 shows the energies of Eq. (5) as a function of \u0393 for N = 20, where the energy gap between the two lowest energy levels is seen to shrink at \u0393 = J , the quantum critical point (QCP) of the system.\nIf the system starts the process in its initial ground state, its dynamics can be simplified into the dynamics of N/2 two-level systems (known as Landau-Zener systems), one for each positive value of k [5]. The evolved ground state can be written as\n|\u03c8(t)\u3009 = \u2297\nk>0\n( uk(t) |\u2193k\u3009 \u2212 vk(t) |\u2191k\u3009 ) , (7)\nwhere |\u2191k\u3009 and |\u2193k\u3009 form a basis of the two-level system labeled by k. Placing Eq. (7) into Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s equation leads to (omitting the time-dependences of uk, vk and \u0393)\ni u\u0307k = \u2212 (\u0393\u2212 J cos k)uk \u2212 J sin k vk, i v\u0307k = \u2212J sin k uk + (\u0393\u2212 J cos k) vk.\n(8)\nThe numerical results of presented here and in the main text were obtained from the standard fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method applied to Eq. (8). The magnetization per spin can be expressed as\n\u00b5(t) = 1\nN\n\u2211\nk>0\n( |uk|2 \u2212 |vk|2 ) .

Transition probabilities between the ground state and an excited state with a single pair of fermions with momenta kn [Eq. (6)], as a function of n, in a process that crosses the QCP of the TI chain with N = 100 and J\u03c4 = 50. The red squares represent the result from numerical integration of Eq. (8), while the blue circles represent the analytical result from first-order APT.\nwhere uk and vk are calculated from Eq. (8).\nFigure 2 shows the transition probabilities in a process starting in the ground state of the paramagnetic phase and ending in the ferromagnetic phase of the TI chain, the same QCP-crossing process considered in the main text. In it, we display only transitions to states reached by the creation of a single pair of fermions with momenta kn [given in Eq. (6)], which means that the relevant energy gap in-\ncreases as n (the variable in the horizontal axis) increases. There is a clear downward trend, which confirms the notion that transition probabilities are higher for pairs of neighbouring energy levels. For small n, the probabilities decrease exponentially with n, which means that only the lowest energy eigenstates contribute meaningfully to the dynamics, while the rest of the eigenstates can be ignored in the determination of protocols such as FQA.\nIn any process, the linear protocol (LIN) is\n\u0393LIN(t) = \u0393i + (\u0393f \u2212 \u0393i) t\u2212 ti \u03c4 . (10)\nThe FQA protocol [6] is obtained by solving Eq. (6) of the main text for the two lowest energy states,\n\u0393FQA(t) = J cos k0 + J sin k0 \u03b1(t)\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b12(t) , (11)\nwhere k0 = \u03c0/N ,\n\u03b1(t) = cos \u03b8k0,i + (cos \u03b8k0,f \u2212 cos \u03b8k0,i) t\u2212 ti \u03c4 (12)\nand\n\u03b8k(\u0393) = arctan\n( J sin k\n\u0393\u2212 J cos k\n) . (13)\nEquation (7) of the main text cannot be solved analytically in this case, so we solved it numerically to obtain FQ2.\nThe UQA [7] and UQ2 protocols are obtained, respectively, by solving Eqs. (6) and (7) of the main text with the substitution Fmn(\u03bb) \u2192 \u2202\u03bbEmn(\u03bb). For \u0393f < \u0393i, their explicit forms are\n\u0393UQA(t) = J    cos k0 + sin k0 \u221a( sin \u03b8k0,i + (1\u2212 sin \u03b8k0,i) t\u2212 ti t1 \u2212 ti )\u22121 \u2212 1, t < t1; cos k0 \u2212 sin k0 \u221a(\nsin \u03b8k0,f + (1\u2212 sin \u03b8k0,f ) tf \u2212 t tf \u2212 t1\n)\u22121 \u2212 1, t > t1;\n(14)\nand\n\u0393UQ2(t) = J    cos k0 + sin k0 \u221a csc2 \u03b8k0,i exp (\u221a 2 erf\u22121 [ t\u2212ti t2\u2212ti erf (\u221a log sin \u03b8k0,i )])2 \u2212 1, t < t2; cos k0 \u2212 sin k0 \u221a csc2 \u03b8k0,f exp (\u221a 2 erf\u22121 [ k0,f k0,i tf\u2212t tf\u2212t2 erf (\u221a log sin \u03b8k0,i )])2 \u2212 1, t > t2;\n(15)\nIn Eq. (15), erf(z) = 2\u221a \u03c0 \u222b z 0 e\u2212x 2 dx is the error function and erf\u22121 is its inverse. The times when UQA and UQ2 cross the QCP are t1 and t2 respectively, and they are given by weighted arithmetic mean values of ti and tf . For UQA, the weights are 1/(1\u2212sin \u03b8k0), while for UQ2, they are k0/erf (\u221a log sin \u03b8k0 ) .\nFigure 3 shows the state diagrams of the reverse processes starting in the ground state. In the entirely paramagnetic process of Fig. 3a, we can see that FQA outperforms\nFQ2, because it naturally has a small time derivative at ti. Accordingly, it has a small first-order APT correction to the magnetization while still doing better than FQ2 at assuring APT, which makes it follow the EOS closely. This shows that FQA and FQ2 are complementary strategies: if the initial derivative of FQA is small, use it; otherwise, use FQ2. Conversely, Fig. 3b shows that FQA-like strategies will always have large \u03bb\u0307i when crossing a critical point, which makes FQ2-like strategies desirable for closely following\n3 2 4 6 8 10 12 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 2 7 12 EOS LIN FQA FQ2\n(a)\n0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n0.0 0.5 1.0 0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nEOS LIN UQA UQ2\n(b)\nFIG. 3.

Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants: the parametric harmonic oscillator The harmonic oscillator (HO) Hamiltonian, with mass m and varying frequency \u03c9, is\nHHO(\u03c9) = p2 2m + k(\u03c9)q2 2 , k(\u03c9) = m\u03c92. (16) The generalized force reads FHO = \u2202kHHO = q2/2, defined without the minus sign for convenience. The (nonequilibrium) state variable K, conjugate to k, can be calculated exactly from\nK(t) = Y 2(t) + \u03c92iX 2(t)\n2m\u03c9i\u03c9(t) \u3008HHO(\u03c9(t))\u3009(0) , (17)\nwhere \u3008HHO(\u03c9(t))\u3009(0) is the average energy calculated in the adiabatic limit, whileX and Y are solutions to the classical equation of motion, Z\u0308 + \u03c92Z = 0, with initial conditions Xi = 0 = Y\u0307i and X\u0307i = 1 = Yi [8\u201310].\nThe energetic cost of a given process, quantified as extra work above the quasistatic work, is\nWex(t) = (Q \u2217(t)\u2212 1) \u3008HHO(\u03c9(t))\u3009(0) , (18)\nwhere (omitting the time-dependences of X , Y and \u03c9)\nQ\u2217(t) = Y\u0307 2 + \u03c92Y 2 + \u03c92i\n( X\u03072 + \u03c92X2 )\n2\u03c9i\u03c9 (19)\nis an adiabatic measure of the harmonic oscillator: whenever Q\u2217(t) = 1, the system is in the same state as an adiabatic process at time t.\nThe invariant-based inverse engineering (IIE) approach exploits the fact that the system\u2019s Hamiltonian admits a Lewis-Riesenfield invariant [11] of the form\nI(t) =\n( b(t)p\u2212mb\u0307(t)q )2\n2m + m\u03c920q 2 2b2(t) , (20)\nas long as b(t) solves the Ermakov equation\nb\u0308(t) + \u03c92(t)b(t) = \u03c920 b3(t)\n(21)\nand \u03c90 is an arbitrary constant. Thus, the eigenstates of I(t) are solutions to Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s equation. One then sets \u03c90 = \u03c9i and chooses b(t) such that the eigenstates of I(t) and of HHO(\u03c9) coincide at ti and tf (up to irrelevant phases) [12]. The corresponding protocol \u03c9IIE(t) is obtained from Eq. (21), and it guarantees, for any process duration \u03c4 , the same final state as an adiabatic process. There is freedom in choosing the exact form for b(t) \u2014 we chose the simplest polynomial in t/\u03c4 that satisfies the required boundary conditions. Note that, while b(t) is a strict function of t/\u03c4 , \u03c9IIE(t) obtained from Eq. (21) is not. We shall see later on that the IIE protocol has some unique properties on the state diagram, owning to its invariant-based design.\nSolving Eq. (6) of the main text for the HO with the proper boundary conditions gives us the FQA protocol [6]\n\u03c9FQA(t) =\n( 1\n\u03c9i +\n( 1\n\u03c9f \u2212 1 \u03c9i ) t\u2212 ti \u03c4 )\u22121 . (22)\nOn the other hand, solving Eq. (7) of the main text with \u03c9\u0307i = 0 gives us the FQ2 protocol\n\u03c9FQ2(t) = \u03c9i exp\n{ erf\u22121 [ t\u2212 ti \u03c4 erf (\u221a log \u03c9f \u03c9i )]}2 .\n(23) Figure 4 shows forward and backward processes for the same \u03c4 and an initial canonical distribution of inverse temperature \u03b2i. Note in the insets that the forms of IIE and FQA in the backward process are simply their timereversed forms of the forward process, but this is not the case for FQ2, given its requirement to set \u03c9\u0307i = 0 while not\n4 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.5 2.0 EOS IIE FQA FQ2\n(a)\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nEOS IIE FQA FQ2\n(b)\nFIG. 4. State diagrams of the HO for an adiabatic (quasistatic) evolution (EOS), the IIE, the FQA and the FQ2 protocols for \u03c9i\u03c4 = 3 and \u03b2i~\u03c9i = 1. The inset shows the form of the protocols. (a) forward process, starting in the top left corner; (b) backward process, starting in the the bottom right corner.\nsetting \u03c9\u0307f . We can clearly see that, out of the three protocols, FQ2 does the best job of keeping the evolution closer to the EOS at all times. Of course, FQA and FQ2 do not have the same exact final state predicted by the EOS, unlike IIE, which requires more information about the system and is, therefore, inaccessible in most cases. Peculiarly, IIE traces the exact same curve of the state diagram in the forward process (FIG. 4a) and in the backward process (FIG. 4b), which is a consequence of its invariant-based nature.\nFigure 5 shows, at tf , the excess state variable and excess work vs. \u03c4 in the forward process. We see, from Fig. 5a, that FQA achieves Kex = 0 for a specific small time in the range 1 < \u03c9i\u03c4 < 2, while FQ2 gives an overall smaller Kex for an arbitrary \u03c9i\u03c4 > 2. This is consistent with their definitions: the FQA protocol of Eq. (22) does a better job at securing an accurate description of the microscopic dynamics by means of APT, but it does not necessarily give the smallest deviations from the adiabatic theorem. On the other hand, the FQ2 protocol of Eq. (23) gives up some (but not much) of its ability to attain early (for small \u03c4 ) adiabaticity in order to allow better following of the EOS. Of course, the IIE protocol is built to give the same final state as an adiabatic evolution, and thus gives Kex = 0 for any \u03c4 .\nFigure 5b clearly shows that, when it comes to the energetic cost of the forward process, FQA beats FQ2 for any \u03c4 . Thus, in order to closely follow the EOS, one might have to spend more energy throughout the process. Interestingly, IIE gives also Wex = 0 for any \u03c4 and, in fact, this can be inferred from the state diagram given in Fig. 4a. The total excess work of a process for a given protocol is the area between its state variable curve and the EOS curve in a state diagram, and we can see that IIE crosses the EOS\nexactly one time (at t = (tf + ti)/2). Thus, any excess energy given to the system in the first half of the process (area above the EOS) is retrieved in the second half (area below the EOS), netting zero excess work. This must be the case for any \u03c4 , even if the evolution is far from being adiabatic at all times. To illustrate this, we have included Fig. 6, where the effects just described are naturally exacerbated. All in all, IIE accomplishes \u201cfinite-time reversibility\u201d when the whole process is taken into account, re-treading its thermodynamic path when time is reversed and dissipating zero energy.\n\u2217 asorianialves@gmail.com [1] G.
