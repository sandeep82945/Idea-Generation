            "text": "Real-time imaging of living cells is a very powerful and versatile tool to study the\ndynamics of biological processes.[1] Ectopic expression of chosen cellular proteins, fused to appropriate fluorescent tags, is an invaluable tool for tracking a range of intracellular events on a single cell basis.[1,2] For instance, key events of mitosis, such as chromosome segregation, have been studied using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy on mammalian\n2\ncells stably expressing mCherry-tagged histone H2B.[3] However, fluorescent tags directly fused to the protein of interest can interfere with specific localization signals, disrupt proper protein folding or oligomerization, or cause steric hindrance, preventing interactions with protein partners and subcellular structures.[2] In addition, ectopic overexpression of tagged protein may not reflect the distribution or the dynamic process of the endogenous protein, as it has been observed for vimentin.[4] It is therefore crucial to accurately identify and validate the spatial and temporal dynamics of endogenous proteins. To date, only few monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or antibody fragments (Fab and scFv) have been successfully expressed or directly delivered as proteins to target intracellular antigens in living cells,[5\u201311] but in most cases, their application has been hampered by inefficient folding and disulfide bond formation in the reducing environment of the cytosol, leading to aggregate formation in living cells.[12]\nRecently, nanobodies or VHHs (variable heavy chain of a heavy chain antibody) have\nemerged as valuable and powerful tools for tracking intracellular proteins, due to their small size (around 15 kDa), robustness and ability to fold in a reducing environment.[13] VHHs genetically fused to fluorescent proteins, called chromobodies, are now well established for monitoring the fate of endogenous proteins in living cells, by transient transfection of plasmids encoding chromobodies.[13\u201315] However, transient expression of chromobodies displays a large intercellular heterogeneity and produces an excess of VHH versus the endogenous antigen,[14,15] so that the generation of cell lines stably expressing low levels of chromobody is generally more reliable. Stable cell lines expressing an actin-chromobody and a vimentin-chromobody were successfully generated to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of both endogenous proteins using live cell imaging.[14,15] Another approach to avoid an excess of nanobody over endogenous antigen is to transduce purified nanobodies into living cells. This technique was successfully applied for the visualization of H2AX phosphorylation at the Serine 139, specifically \u03b3-H2AX, through the direct delivery of the purified chromobody C6B-tagged-dTomato.[16] Nevertheless, this process required production and purification of the chromobody from E.coli, which may be laborious and time consuming.\nRecently, we successfully detected endogenous proteins using electrotransfer of in\nvitro transcribed (IVT) mRNAs encoding chromobodies.[17] We have shown that mRNA is ideal for delivering genetic information into various cell lines with extremely high efficiency,\n3\nup to 95%. Furthermore, by monitoring the amount of transfected mRNA, we were able to adjust the amount of nanobody expressed to the amount of target antigen inside the cell, eliminating the need to remove the excess of unbound nanobody.[17] In the present work, we describe the huge potential of mRNA encoding chromobody delivery for detecting and tracing intracellular targets with extremely high accuracy by live cell imaging. As a proof of concept, we tested three chromobodies to visualize the dynamic behavior of endogenous proteins present in different abundance and in distinct subcellular compartments, by realtime microscopy; the lamin A/C components of the nuclear lamina[13], the \u03b2-actin, highly conserved protein and involved in various types of cell mobility[18] and the DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) that methylates CpG residues and is associated with DNA replication sites during in S phase.[19] Because the mRNAs are directly delivered into the cytoplasm, expression occurs in almost all cells as early as 3 hours after transfection without cell division and lasts for at least for 48 h. In principle, this approach is not limited to chromobodies, but can be applied to any other specific intracellular protein binders."

            "text": "We first evaluated the anti-nuclear lamin VHH binding to lamin A/C.[13] The nanobody\ncoding sequence was cloned in frame with either the mScarlet,[20] the mScarlet fused to E3 peptide originated from the tetramerization domain of p53 [17] or the dTomato coding sequences[21], the last two both forming dimers (Figure 1A). The DNA constructs were then used for IVT mRNA synthesis. Different amounts of mRNAs coding for the three chromobodies were electrotransfected into the HeLa H2B-GFP cell line. The endogenous lamina was clearly detected by all three chromobodies in almost 95% of the cells, although with different efficiencies (Figure 1B). Both dimeric chromobodies gave a strong and specific signal at 100 ng of transfected mRNA, while the signal of the monomeric lamin-chromobody tagged mScarlet was very weak at 200 ng and partly unspecific. The fact that both dimer formats were significantly better at detecting the nuclear lamina than the monomeric laminchromobody resulting in a higher signal-to-background ratio is not surprising. Indeed, bivalent VHHs have been shown to display a better functional affinity compared to their monovalent counterparts through avidity effect.[16,22] However, the lamin-chromobody\n4\ntagged dTomato gave a stronger signal than the lamin-chromobody mScarlet-E3 with equivalent amounts of transfected mRNA (figure 2B). This observation was surprising as the mScarlet and dTomato have an equivalent brightness signals in cellula.[23] Nevertheless, aggregates were clearly detected for the lamina-chromobody tagged dTomato (Figure 1B and C). This phenomenon was not observed with the lamina-chromobody tagged mScarletE3. Therefore, we decided to use with lamina-chromobody tagged mScarlet-E3 construct.\nThus, 100 ng of lamin-chromobody mScarlet-E3 encoding mRNA was electroporated\nin HeLa-H2B-GFP cells. Forty-eight hours later, the dynamics of the lamina was observed at different stages of the cell cycle (Figure 2A). In G1 and S phases, the lamin-chromobody mScarlet-E3 signal was specifically distributed at the periphery of the nucleus. During the mitosis, it was homogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the dividing cells (Figure 2A and Movie 1). As the mRNA is delivered in the cytoplasm, we tested whether the IVT mRNA was rapidly translated. A time point expression of the lamin-chromobody was performed following transfection of 100 ng of mRNA. As shown in figure 2B and Movie 2, the lamin-chromobody expression took place 4 h after mRNA delivery and peaked at around 16 hours after transfection (two cells are shown in figure 2B)."

            "text": "We next evaluated the nanobody targeting the human DNA methyltransferase 1\n(hDnmt1).[24,25] In the nucleus, Dnmt1 associates with the replication factories, a mechanism that links the maintenance of the genomic methylation patterns to the process of DNA replication.[26,27] Dmnt1 transfers methyl groups to hemimethylated substrate CpG sites generated during DNA synthesis in S phase.[28] In early and mid S phase, Dnmt1 transiently interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), whereas in late S phase, Dnmt1 concentrates at chromocenters, which are composed of the pericentric heterochromatin of individual chromosomes.[27,29,30] Consequently, the distribution pattern of Dnmt1 is highly variable throughout the cell cycle.\nThe nanobody anti-Dmnt1 coding sequence was cloned in frame with the mScarlet\nand the E3 peptide to obtain a dimer (Figure 3A) and the DNA construct was used for mRNA IVT. Then, various amounts of mRNA encoding the Dnmt1-chromobody mScarlet-E3 were electro-transfered into two different cell lines, MRC5 and HeLa-H2B-GFP. Twenty-four hours\n5\nafter transfection, the cells were fixed and observed by direct immunofluorescence. At levels of 200 and 100 ng transfected mRNA, the Dnmt1-chromobody mScarlet-E3 was diffusely present in all compartments of the cell, whereas at 50 ng the Dnmt1 signal was predominantly localized in the nucleus in both cell lines (Figure 3B). To obtain a specific signal with minimal background, the optimal quantity of mRNA was 50 ng for HeLa H2B-GFP and 25 ng for the MRC5 (Figure 3B and C and Figure S1). Importantly, with 50 ng of mRNA transfected, almost 95% of the cells were expressing the Dnmt1-chromobody mScarlet-E3 (Figure 3B and C, and Figure S2).\nNext, MRC5 cells electrotransfected with the optimal amount of mRNA, were\nmonitored for Dnmt1 dynamics distribution using live-cell imaging. As shown previously,[24,29] the signals are characteristic of Dnmt1 dynamics during the cell cycle, corresponding to the spatial and temporal coupling of Dnmt1 with sites of active DNA replication during early and late S-phase, when DNA of percentromeric heterochromatin is replicated (Figure 4A, Movie 3). The co-localization of Dnmt1 and PCNA during S-phase was demonstrated by immunofluorescence on fixed cells expressing Dnmt1-chromobody using a mAb anti-PCNA (PC10) (Figure 4B). Thus, in S-phase, Dnmt1 transiently co-localizes with PCNA foci and then concentrates at chromocenters.\nWe evaluated the expression level of the Dnmt1-chromobody at different time points\nwith either 50, 100 or 1000 ng of transfected mRNA in MRC5 cell line. The Dnmt1chromobody was expressed as early as 3 h post-transfection, respectively (Figure 5A and Figure S3). The fluorescence intensity was clearly proportional to the amount of transfected mRNA and the time point measurement after transfection. Interestingly, 20 h after transfection, the majority of the Dnmt1-chromobody signal was localized in the nucleus, whereas 6 h after transfection Dnmt1-chromobody signal was detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The dimeric Dnmt1-chromobody with a size of around 100 kDa can not diffused freely through the nuclear pore complex, and since it lacks a nuclear localization signal (NLS), Dnmt1-chromobody is likely to enter the nucleus via a piggybacking mechanism.[31,32] Indeed, Dnmt1-chromobody might piggyback indirectly via its physical interaction to de novo synthetized Dnmt1 protein encompassing three NLS that directly binds the nuclear transport apparatus.[33] Thus, we hypothesized that the mRNA might be degraded rapidly and the produced Dnmt1-chromobody excess, which has accumulated in\n6\nthe cytoplasm, is then gradually transported in the nucleus by binding to the newly synthetized Dnmt1 protein. The amount of the mRNA encoding Dnmt1-chromobody was quantified by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay in electrotransfected mRC5 cells. The level of mRNA encoding Dnmt1-chromobody peaked at 2 hours posttransfection, decreased rapidly at 6 hours and was nearly undetectable at 20 hours posttransfection (Figure 5B). It then decreased two-fold 3 hours later and became undetectable 20 hours after transfection. This observation supports our hypothesis that the translated mRNA leads to some accumulation of the Dnmt1-chromobody in the cytoplasm and then, as the mRNA is degraded, the Dnmt1-chromobody is gradually transported to the nucleus by binding to newly synthesized Dnmt1 (Figure 5C)."

Actins represent the most\nabundant proteins present in most eukaryotic cells, which participate in multiple important cellular processes including cell mobility, cell division and organelle dynamics.[18] First, the amount of mRNA to be transfected was determined. A specific and accurate signal of the actin network was detected when 200 ng of mRNAs encoding actin-chromobody were transfected in MRC5 cells (Figure 6A). Live cell imaging was performed on MRC5 and U2OS cell lines transfected with 200 ng of mRNAs encoding actin-chromobody (Figure 6 B-C and Movies 4 and 5). Clear detection of actin filaments during cell division or cell mobility were observed by live-cell imaging validating the transfection of mRNA encoding actinchromobody to trace actin dynamic in living cell."

            "text": "Chromobodies offer a tremendous advantage for the direct detection and\nvisualization of almost any endogenous protein within living cells by real-time microscopy. Transient transfection of plasmid encoding the chromobodies has been used.[14\u201316] However, transfection of expression plasmids almost always results in an excess of nanobody compared to the native antigen. For instance, the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of the endogenous vimentin have been studied by time-lapse imaging using transient transfection of a vimentin chromobody.[15] However, as the transient chromobody expression showed a large intercellular heterogeneity, a stable chromobody cell line was established and selected\n7\nfor low chromobody expression to minimize background fluorescence due to an excess of unbound chromobody.[15] Likewise, the endogenous nuclear actin was visualized using the actin-Chromobody targeted to the nucleus.[14] Stable nuclear actin-chromobody expressing cells were generated to better monitor nuclear actin assembly more accurately than with transient transfection.[14] The actin-chromobody was also used to visualize the sub-organelle actin spatiotemporal dynamics with high resolution,[34] but over-expression artifacts were observed due to the strong CMV promoter driven transient expression of the nanobody. To overcome this problem, the authors expressed the actin-chromobody using a weaker promoter.[34] A second strategy consists of directly transducing purified chromobodies as proteins in living cells.[16] In such case, the levels of nanobodies are generally lower than those of the target antigen. Nonetheless, aside from being a laborious and time consuming methodology, expression levels, folding and solubility of the chromobody may turn out to be challenging.[16]\nHere, we establish a simple and straightforward alternative to detect and track\nendogenous proteins in real time using mRNAs encoding chromobodies. The mRNAs are synthetized in vitro and delivered into living cells by electroporation.[17] The possibility to precisely control the level of chromobody expressed by adjusting the amount of mRNAs transfected ensures the ability to fine-tune the level of chromobody with its cellular target. This was demonstrated by targeting three endogenous proteins of different abundance,\nnamely \u03b2-actin, lamin A/C and Dnmt1. Indeed, the \u03b2-actin is approximately 5-fold more abundant than lamin A/C, which is itself 30-fold more abundant than Dnmt1.[35,36]\nWe strongly believe that the delivery of mRNA encoding chromobodies opens up\nmany possibilities for the specific generation of probes to accurately unravel the spatiotemporal distribution of intracellular components in living cells.\nMaterials and Methods\nCell lines. HeLa-H2B-eGFP and MRC5 (ATCC CCL-171) were maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (1 g/L glucose) (Gibco, Billings, MT, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and Pen\u2013Strep.\n8\nPlasmids. The coding sequence of the Dnmt1-chromobody targeting the human Dnmt1 protein [37] (Uniprot : P26358 \u00b7 DNMT1_HUMAN) and lamin-chromobody (ChromoTek) targeting the lamin D0 from Drosophila monogaster (Uniprot : P08928 \u00b7 LAM0_DROME), were amplified by PCR with primers NaBo Foward CGTCAGCCATGGGGTCCCAGGTTCAGC and NaBo Reverse-STOP CCACAGGAATTCACAATGGTGATGATGGTGATGTGCG and subcloned into the NcoI-EcoRI digested pETOM to obtain the pETOM-nano-Dnmt1 and the pETOMnano-Lamina.[38] The mScarlet-E3 was amplified from the pET-mScarlet-E3 described elsewhere[39] with primers mScarlet-SpeI-For GGGCCCACTAGTGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGCAGTGATC and E3/K3-EcoRI-Rev CATGACGAATTCTTAACCCCCTGGCTCTTCCC, and subcloned into SpeI-EcoRI restriction sites of the pETOM-nano-Lamin giving rise to the pETOM-nano-Lamin-mScarlet-E3. The dTomato DNA sequence was amplified from pET-C6B-dTomato with primer dTo-For-SpeI CATGATACTAGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGG and a reverse primer dTo-Rev-EcoRI GTGCTCGAATTCTTATTAATGG, and subcloned into the SpeI-EcoRI digested pETOM-nanoLamina to obtain the pETOM-nano-Lamin-dTo. The plasmid encoding the actin-chromobody (ChromoTek) was used to amplify the coding sequence of the chromobody under the control of the T7 promoter with actin-chromobody-for AATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAGGAGATATCCATGGCTCAGGTGCAGCTGGTGG and chromobody-RFP/GFP-rev TTATGATCTAGAGTCGCGGCCGC.\nmRNA synthesis and transfection. The mRNAs were transcribed from the T7 promoter of a linearized pETOM vector with EcoRI restriction enzyme containing the gene of interest. Linearized plasmids were purified and used as a template for in vitro transcription (IVT) as previously described.[17] The transfection experiments with mRNAs were conducted with the NeonTM transfection system (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described.[17] The cells were transferred into 24-well plates containing glass coverslips or in Ibidi for time-lapse imaging.\nImmunofluorescence. The cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G containing 4\u02b9,6\u02b9-diamidino-2 phenyleindole (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, UK) and cells were observed by direct immunofluorescence. For indirect fluorescence, cells were prior\n9\nincubated with 100% cold-methanol for 5 min prior to be incubate with an anti-PCNA mouse mAb (PC10) in PBS containing 0.2 % Triton X100 and 6% FCS followed with a secondary antimouse-Alexa 488 (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The treated cells were analyzed using conventional fluorescence microscopy with a Leica DM5500 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). For time-lapse, Images were processed with Image J2.0.0.\nTime-lapse microscopy. Time-lapse movies were recorded using inverted microscopes either DMIRE2, Leica, equipped with a 40X NA 0.75 objective (HCX PL APO, Leica), a solid-state light source (SOLA III, Lumencor), a sCMOS camera (Prime, Photometrics) or Olympus IX83 with in both cases an environmental control system (Life Imaging Service). Cells were grown on \u00b5Dish 35mm (Ibidi) and maintained at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Images were acquired at different intervals, depending on the experiment procedure for a maximum of 24 h using Metamorph (7.8.13.0, Molecular Device) or Olympus camera. Acquisition parameters were chosen to optimize signal to noise ratio and were fixed throughout the time-lapse acquisition. The resulting image stacks were processed using Fiji (ImageJ, NIH). No filtering procedure was used to visualize the dynamics of the lamina, the actin and the movement of Dnmt1 during the cell cycle.\nqRT PCR. Electrotransfected MRC5 cells were harvested and total mRNAs were purified with Nucleo Spin RNA kit (Macherey Nagel) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was generated from 1 \u00b5g of RNA with High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transfection kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time qPCR was performed with Syber Green I Master kit (Roche) on a Light Cycler LC480 instrument (Roche). For the human GAPDH gene, forward primer 5\u2019- GCACAAGAGGAAGAGAGAGACC and reverse primer 5\u2019-AGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGTG were used. For the Dnmt1-chromobody, the forward primer 5\u2019-CAGCGGTAACAACACCAGCTCC and reverse primer 5\u2019-GGCATCCTCGAGTTCCAAGGCC were used to amplify a sequence within E3 sequence (from the tetramerization domain of p53). The Dnmt1 chromobody mRNA levels were normalized to the GAPDH mRNA levels. Changes in mRNA level were calculated by the threshold cycle (2-\u2206\u2206CT) method. A one-way ANOVA tailed Student\u2019s t test was performed on \u2206CT values to determine the p-value.\nStatistics. The quantification was performed using Image J, and the statistic analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0. The number of replicates is indicated in the figure\n10\nlegends. In the boxplots, the bars indicate the median and interquartile range of the recorded fluorescence. The statistical significance of the data was determined with one-way ANOVA tailed Student\u2019s t test and indicated as ns; not significant, * p-value <0.1, ** p-value <0.01, *** p-value <0.001 and **** p-value < 0.0001.\nSupplementary Materials:\nAuthor Contributions: \u201cConceptualization, M.D.; methodology, M.D.; validation M.D.; investigation, T.J, L.R, M.M and M.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.D.; writing\u2014 review and editing, M.M, B.C. and M.D.; supervision, M.D.; project administration, B.C.; funding acquisition, M.D. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\u201d\nFunding: This work was supported by funds and/or fellowships from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the University of Strasbourg, the French Ministry of Research, the Ligue R\u00e9gionale contre le Cancer (CCIR-GE), the Fondation ARC pour la recherche sur le cancer, the ITI Innovec (IdEx) (ANR-10-IDEX-0002) and the SFRI (ANR-20-SFRI-0012).\nAcknowledgments: We thank G.
