    "abstractText": "Change detection (CD) is the process of detecting changes from multi-temporal satellite images that have undergone spatial changes due to natural phenomena and/or human-induced activities. Mango is a major fruit crop in India, but detection of changes in mango crops remains a challenging task because the reason that many perennial crops have similar reflectance profiles. Therefore, a potent change detection technique is required for different applications such as the rate of deforestation, urban developments, damage evaluation, and resource monitoring. Compared to annual and seasonal crops, relatively few studies have been conducted on change detection in perennial fruit crops. In this study, a novel change detection technique (i.e., LR-PCA) is developed using the fusion of log-ratio (LR) and principal component analysis (PCA) images derived from bi-temporal soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) images to extract meaningful information and detect temporal changes in the mango fruit crop areas with high change detection accuracy. The proposed approach comprised two steps: (1) SAVI images from 2015 and 2019 were used to retrieve the log-ratio (LR) and principal component (PC) images, respectively, and both the images were fused by applying the pixel-by-pixel fusion approach. (2) Fused images were classified into three classes: \u201cpositive change\u201d, \u201cno change\u201d, and \u201cnegative change\u201d using a derived threshold value. The results show that the LR-PCA method of change detection yields a high change detection accuracy of 92% in comparison with the other change detection methods viz. vegetation image differencing, image ratioing, PCA, and log-ratio. To validate the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, experiments with two sets of bi-temporal SAVI indices images belonging to the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh State determine that the proposed change detection method performs well as compared to the existing individual methods for detection of changes in mango fruit crop. The proposed method is expected to be useful for detecting changes in the area of perennial crops. In the future, an accurate and efficient change detection analysis may be helpful for developing a real-time mango fruit crop monitoring system at the national level.

Mango is a major fruit crop in India, but detection of changes in mango crops remains a challenging task because the reason that many perennial crops have similar reflectance profiles. Therefore, a potent change detection technique is required for different applications such as the rate of deforestation, urban developments, damage evaluation, and resource monitoring. Compared to annual and seasonal crops, relatively few studies have been conducted on change detection in perennial fruit crops. In this study, a novel change detection technique (i.e., LR-PCA) is developed using the fusion of log-ratio (LR) and principal component analysis (PCA) images derived from bi-temporal soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) images to extract meaningful information and detect temporal changes in the mango fruit crop areas with high change detection accuracy. The proposed approach comprised two steps: (1) SAVI images from 2015 and 2019 were used to retrieve the log-ratio (LR) and principal component (PC) images, respectively, and both the images were fused by applying the pixel-by-pixel fusion approach. (2) Fused images were classified into three classes: \u201cpositive change\u201d, \u201cno change\u201d, and \u201cnegative change\u201d using a derived threshold value. The results show that the LR-PCA method of change detection yields a high change detection accuracy of 92% in comparison with the other change detection methods viz. vegetation image differencing, image ratioing, PCA, and log-ratio. To validate the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, experiments with two sets of bi-temporal SAVI indices images belonging to the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh State determine that the proposed change detection method performs well as compared to the existing individual methods for detection of changes in mango fruit crop. The proposed method is expected to be useful for detecting changes in the area of perennial crops. In the future, an accurate and efficient change detection analysis may be helpful for developing a real-time mango fruit crop monitoring system at the national level.\nINDEX TERMS Landsat 8 OLI, change detection, log ratio, principal component analysis, mango crop.\nI. INTRODUCTION India is the second largest fruit producer in the world and mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a major fruit crop grown in India. Fruit crops are crucial for improving land productivity,\neconomic condition of farmers by increasing income, employment generation, and providing nutritional security. To better manage crops and bring more area under fruit crops, information on the current status of change in crop\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Presently, there is a great concern for changes to the Earth\u00b4s environment; therefore, there is a real need to develop an improved change detection technique to identify where and when these changes occur [2]. The changes that occur on the earth\u2019s surface can be either natural or man-made, where natural changes are caused by changes in seasonal and/or annual climatic conditions, and these changes are commonly reflected by changes in land cover. Change detection is the process of identifying differences in the state of an object or phenomenon by observing them at different times [3]. Normally, change detection involves the use of multi-temporal images to quantitatively analyze the temporal effects of a particular phenomenon [4]. To better manage land use by discerning human interactions with natural phenomena, timely and accurate change detection needs to be employed. Among changes, the trend of land-use change caused by humans is regarded as one of the most significant factors affecting global changes in the environment [5]. Timely and accurate change detection of Earth\u2019s surface features provides a basis for a better understanding of the interactions between human and natural phenomena to better manage land cover.\nMany satellites images-based change detection methods have been proposed to detect the changed information, and these methods can be divided into two components: supervised and unsupervised algorithms [8], [9]. In a study, Landsat satellite time series data were used for the automatic mapping of the planting year for tree crops in California [10]. Landsat-5 TM images are used for the detection of changes in the area of coconut in the Klang, located in Selangor, Malaysia [11]. Due to the benefits of repetitive data acquisition in form of a digital format suitable for computer processing, satellite images, such as Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Radar and Advanced Very HighResolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite Pour I\u2019Observation de la Terre (SPOT), etc., have become the major data sources for different change detection applications [4]. Landsat 8 OLI, MODIS, AVHRR, SPOT, LISS, and Cartosat are some of the important optical satellite images, which generate images of the Earth over relatively large areas and images are useful in the production of vegetation maps or to estimate vegetation parameters. The advantage is that these satellites provide long time-series data, while the disadvantage is that optical images get easily affected by cloud cover. Many change detection techniques have been developed recently; the most used change detection methods are image differencing (ID), principal component analysis (PCA), and post-classification comparison [4], while other methods are image ratioing (IR), log ratio (LR), image regression (IR), and change vector analysis (CVA). The important usage of different change detection methods is monitoring environmental changes and land use \u2013land cover change detection.\nPCA based change detection methods have been mostly used for multi-temporal, multispectral or panchromatic images [2], [3], [6]. Then, a classification step is necessary to decide whether the pixels are \u2018change\u2019 pixels or \u2018no change\u2019 pixels. In order to take this decision, many techniques are proposed, the simplest and the more used among them is the application of the thresholding method. Good performances are obtained in separating the changed pixels from the unchanged ones using principal component 2 (PC2). It is reported that the application of PCA results in two or more principal components, the first principal component i.e. principal component1 (PC1) contains most of the information that is common in both images. This way, the first principal component is almost similar to both input images while the second principal component i.e., PC2 provides information that is not shared by the pair of images [2]. Specifically, the change amount is related to the intensity distribution in PC2 and for that PC2 intensity is used to quantify the degree of change. It means that the difference between both input images is rather in the second component than in the first one [2]. Based on these facts, PC2 is considered for change detection in the present study. Other lower-order principal components i.e., PC1 generally do not contain useful information. It does not lead to any information loss and provides more clarity as a signal\u2013to\u2013noise (S/N) ratio improved [7].\nIn a study, researchers had evaluated the performance of four change detection algorithms viz., image regression, mean ratio, image differencing, and log ratio, and concluded that the output of the log ratio method has been affected less by speckle noise [12]. This is because of its ability to convert multiplicative speckle noise into additive. Further, they found that the log ratio method offers the highest accuracy and kappa coefficient value. Reference [13] has developed a remote sensing image change detection method based on a multi-scale geometric analysis fusion and fuzzy local information C-means clustering (FLICM) model. They used difference image (DI) calculated by the log-ratio operator (LR) and mean ratio operator (MR), respectively; the fused difference image generated by non-sub sampled contourlet transform (NSCT) fusion, and the final change detection map computed by (FLICM) model. In one of our previous studies, four change detection methods viz., vegetation index differencing, PCA, LR, and image ratioing are evaluated for changes in mango fruit crop areas. It is found that both PCA and vegetation index differencing performed best, and log ratio also performed reasonably well [14]. The goal of the present work is to propose a method that can automatically detect a real change and improve the quality of change detection in multi-date images."

Radiometric calibrations convert digital numbers to surface reflectance or radiance values and also correct the pixel value errors. It improves the quality of satellite images by reducing the noise and is much required for quantitative analysis of multitemporal images.\nLandsat images are already geo-referenced at the Universal Transverse Mercator projection system (Zone: 44\u00b0 N, Datum: WGS\u201384), these images cover the Lucknow district and are pre-processed by performing the Radiometric Calibration [16]. The atmospheric conditions, such as Sun zenith angle, solar radiance, cloud, haze, ice and atmospheric scattering, at different acquisition dates of the images, influence spectral signatures for the same invariant objects. Therefore, it is required to process the raw data into surface reflectance using a proper atmospheric calibration method [15], [17]. There are several methods such as relative calibration, dark-object subtraction to complex model-based calibration have been developed for radiometric and atmospheric correction [18-20]. The dark-object subtraction approach is commonly used in practice because it is strictly an image-based procedure and corrected for the effects caused by sun zenith angle, solar radiance, and atmospheric scattering [16], [20], [21],[36],[37]. The atmospheric conditions at the different acquisition dates influence spectral signatures for the same invariant objects. Therefore, conversion from raw data to surface reflectance using a proper atmospheric calibration method is needed [17], [18], [22], [38]. Pre-processed Red and NIR bands images are shown in Fig. 4, where multi-temporal images covering the Lucknow region are atmospherically corrected to remove the atmospheric effect from it to determine the true surface reflectance values. From Fig. 4, it is observed that individual NIR and Red bands images are not capable to detect the changes in mango areas. Hence, NIR and Red images are used to calculate the SAVI image."

This multivariate analysis technique is used to reduce the number of spectral components to fewer principal components accounting for the most variance in the original multispectral images by projecting the images along with new noncorrelated axes [3], [7], [38]. This method reduces data redundancy by transforming multivariate data into a new set of components with the assumption that areas of change are not highly correlated [30]. PCA can be computed in two ways viz. standardized and unstandardized PCA. If a PCA is computed using a correlation matrix, then it is called standardized PCA. Furthermore, if a PCA is computed using a covariance matrix then it is called an unstandardized PCA. For multi-spectral satellite images, the standardized PCA is reported to be better than the unstandardized PCA because in the former case, it has an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as compared to the latter one for the same data set [31], [32].\nIn the present study, standardized PCA is used to enhance the features of the Mango crop fruit areas. For transferring data to an uncorrelated set, a Covariance or Correlation matrix is used. Then sort the resulting matrices consisting of Eigenvectors in descending order. Most of the data variation is expressed by the first principal component. The next largest amount of variation is defined by the succeeding principal component, and this is orthogonal/ independent to the principal component that precedes it. The main advantage of PCA is that it reduces the redundancy of data [33], [40- 45]. However, the disadvantage of PCA-based change detection is that it cannot provide complete change information but requires the threshold of the image to identify the changes that occurred in the area."

The image pixel values that are in between T0 and T1 represent the \u2018no change\u2019 area, and pixel values less than T0 represent \u2018-ve\u2019 change\u2019. Similarly, the pixel values greater than T1 represent \u2018+ve change\u2019. It can easily be understood by plotting the histogram of the fused raster image i.e. LR-PC2 as shown in Fig. 2. A histogram provides a method for the determination of the threshold. In general, a good threshold can be selected if the histogram peaks are tall, narrow, symmetric, and separated by deep valleys. Image regions with uniform intensity give rise to strong peaks in the histogram. The histogram in Fig. 2 is depicting a method to select \u2018no change\u2019, \u2018Positive change\u2019 and \u2018Negative change\u2019 pixels for thresholding the raster image as shown in Fig. 2.\nFIGURE 2.

The threshold value border of \"change\" and \"no change\" pixels is often chosen from the histogram of the ratio image [34].

But the important part of the histogram-based thresholding approach is the definition of thresholds indicating change [35]. Once the values of both thresholds are determined, the decision rules for three different classes\n\u2018positive change\u2019, \u2018no change\u2019, and \u2018negative change\u2019 can easily be framed as follows:\nIf pixel value <= T0 then pixel class = Negative change If T0 <= pixel value <= T1 then pixel class= No change If pixel value >=T1 then pixel class = Positive change\nBy using the above decision rules, the LR-PC2 image can easily be classified in Negative change, No change, and Positive change classes."

Once the image is classified, the pixel value of the mango crop class is set to one to make this area transparent and for other areas, pixel values are set to zero. When the mask image is overlaid on the thresholded image, the final image will show only the mango crop area and all other areas become background/unclassified with the color black. This process creates a mask image with the mango area transparent and other areas turned off.\nAfter the raster image is thresholded to determine the \u2018Positive change\u2019, \u2018Negative change\u2019 and \u2018No change\u2019 areas, to obtain the final change map, a mask with pixel value \u20180\u2019 is applied to mask out the non-mango area, and thereafter change detection accuracies are calculated by using ground truth data."

The complete flowchart of the proposed change detection technique is shown in Fig. 3.\nIn this paper, Landsat 8 OLI images of two different dates (i.e. 14 Feb, 2015 and 25 Feb, 2019) have been taken for the development of the LR-PCA fusion based change detection algorithm. Both the images are pre-processed by applying\nradiometric normalization, and atmospheric correction. Preprocessed images are used to compute the SAVI images, which are further used to retrieve the PCA and LR images. Firstly, the PCA method has been used to test the quality and limitations of this approach. Secondly, the LR method has been applied for enhancing the quality of the change detection. Finally, to get more accurate information, a change detection method by fusing LR and PC2 of PCA images has been proposed that is better performing than applying just one of the classical PCA or LR techniques."

VALIDATION OF PROPOSED ALGORITHM For validation of the proposed LR-PCA based change detection algorithm, the steps discussed in previous sections are applied to the images of the Sitapur district, which are subsets of Image-1 and Image-2 to detect the changes in Mango crop areas only. The steps used to validate the proposed LR-PCA fusion-based technique are as follows:\n(1) Landsat 8 OLI images of the years 2015 and 2019 are cropped for the Sitapur district. (2) The above images are pre-processed and atmospherically corrected. (3) After that, SAVI images are computed for the years 2015 and 2019, which are further used to\ncompute the Log Ratio and PCA images.\n(4) LR and PC2 images are fused and the LR-PC2 fused image is used for change detection purposes\nand it is thresholded using N =0.60 to obtain the\u201c\u2013 ve change\u201d, \u201c+ve change\u201d, \u201cno change\u201d pixels. (5) In classified image non-mango areas are masked, image is smoothened, and a final change map is\ngenerated.\nLR-PCA fused image of Sitapur district is shown in Fig.17, which is further used to detect the changes in mango crop areas.\nFor change detection using LR-PCA image, threshold values are calculated using N =0.60 in \u201c6\u201d and \u201c7\u201d. Mean (\u00b5) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of the pixel values of this image are determined as 0.066872 and 0.529180, respectively.\nT0= \u00b5-N*\u03c3 = 0.066872-0.60*0.529180 = -0.2506 T1= \u00b5+N*\u03c3 =0.066872+0.60*0.529180\n=0.38438\nSitapur district image is thresholded by using the values of T0 andT1. The pixels of the image with a value less than the value of T0, are classified as \u2018negative change\u2019. The pixels with a value between T0 and T1 are classified as \u2018no change\u2019 pixels. Similarly, the pixels with a value greater than the value of T1 are classified as \u2018positive change\u2019 pixels. Further,\nmasking is performed to mask out the non-mango areas. In the last step, the Shape file of the Sitapur district is used to remove the outside boundary area. The change image of the Sitapur mango crop area is shown in Fig. 18.\nFrom the final change map of the Sitapur district shown in Fig. 18, it is observed that the total positive change area is 3417.84 ha and the negative change area is 2538.0 ha. The positive change in mango crop area derived from the LRPCA method agreed with the difference in mango areas in the years 2015 and 2019, which suggests that the proposed LR-PCA based change detection technique works quite effectively and efficiently. In future, LR-PCA based change detection algorithm may be used on other optical sensor images for effective Mango crop monitoring."
