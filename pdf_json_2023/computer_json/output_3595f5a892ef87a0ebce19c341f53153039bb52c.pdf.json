To maintain viewership, many of these Russian outlets began to heavily promote their content on messaging services like Telegram. In this work, we study how 16 Russian media outlets interacted with and utilized 732 Telegram channels throughout 2022. Leveraging the foundational model MPNet, DP-means clustering, and Hawkes Processes, we trace how narratives spread between news sites and Telegram channels. We show that news outlets not only propagate existing narratives through Telegram, but that they source material from the messaging platform. Across the sites in our study, between 2.3% (ura.news) and 26.7% (ukraina.ru) of articles discuss content that originated/resulted from activity on Telegram. Finally, tracking the spread of individual topics, we measure the rate at which news websites and their Telegram channels disseminate content within the Russian media ecosystem.",

            "text": "On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine. In the buildup to and following the initial invasion, Russian state media conducted massive information campaigns online justifying the Russian state\u2019s invasion as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to \u201cliberate\u201d the people of Ukraine (Wong 2022). In response, the EU and the UK among others banned or otherwise censored Russian news media. To circumvent this censorship, Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik News began to redirect users to and promote their content on the messaging app Telegram; ultimately Telegram became one of the main platforms for Russian propaganda (Bergengruen 2022). When Telegram eventually succumbed to pressure to de-platform prominent Russian outlets (e.g., rtnews), several Russian state media outlets created new Telegram channels (e.g., swentr [rtnews backward])1 or otherwise circumvented the bans. However, while there has been extensive reporting on the Russian state media\u2019s usage of Telegram (Bergengruen 2022), there has been\nCopyright \u00a9 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

To do this, we crawl and gather content published between January 1 and September 25, 2022, from 16 Russiabased news sites (215K articles) and the 732 Telegram channels hyperlinked by these Russian news sites (2.48M Telegram messages). Leveraging a multilingual version of the large foundational model MPNet (Song et al. 2020), finetuned on semantic search, we perform semantic similarity analyses of the content spread between and amongst these news platforms and English language, Russian language, and Ukrainian-language Telegram channels. Further, improving upon an online and parallelizable non-parametric version of the K-Means algorithm, we cluster our dataset into fine-grained topic clusters to understand the topics discussed. We find that much of the content shared between Telegram and Russian websites concerns the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions on Russia. By performing this same clustering on semantic content specific to only Russian news websites or to only Telegram channels, we find an emphasis on the day-to-day machinations (e.g., bombings of particular bridges) of the Russo-Ukrainian War on Telegram that contrasts a focus on US politics specific to Russian news.\nNext, we track the spread of topics amongst and between Telegram and Russian news media. We find that 33.2% of distinct topics discussed on our set of Telegram channels, making up 24.3% of all Telegram messages in our dataset, was first published in Russian news articles. In contrast, 13.9% of topics on Russian news websites, comprising 18.39% of all the text (all messages from Telegram and paragraphs from Russian state media) on our set of Russian websites, were posted first on Telegram. Telegram-originated messages comprise a particularly large amount of content on news websites like waronfakes.com (28.2% of text), ukraina.ru (27.9%), and ura.news (25.6%) that all maintain large Telegram presences. Applying time-series analysis with the Hawkes process on our topic clusters, we estimate the percentage of content on each platform that was influenced by activity on other platform. While some websites like ura.news have relatively low amounts of content (2.4%)\nflowing from Telegram, others such as ukraina.ru have much large (27.2%) of their content possibly influenced by activity on Telegram. Finally, we analyze how quickly topics spread amongst our set of news websites and onto Telegram channels, finding that websites like ura.news, ukraina.ru, newsfront.info, katehon.com, and the Telegram channel @gensham\u2019s topics flow most quickly to other platforms.\nOur work presents one of the first in-depth analyses of semantic content and semantic similarity among and between Russian state media websites and Telegram channels. We show that by leveraging multilingual models, we can programmatically track the spread of topics and ideas across platforms. As misinformation and propaganda increasingly spread on messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp, we hope that our work can serve as the basis for future studies about the spread of misinformation online."

            "text": "Telegram. Telegram, started in 2013, is a messaging platform (Baumgartner et al. 2020) with 700 million monthly users (Singh 2022) as of June 2022. Similar to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, users on Telegram can share messages, images, and videos. However, in addition to private conversations, Telegram users can create one-to-many public channels (where only channel creators and administrators can post content) to which other users can subscribe (La Morgia et al. 2021). Within this work, we focus on these administrator-run channels. With a free-speech ethos, Telegram is a platform where extremist content, misinformation, and propaganda can thrive (Walther and McCoy 2021). Both Ho\u0308hn et al. and Baumgartner et al. for instance, develop public datasets for analyzing the spread of misinformation on Telegram (Ho\u0308hn, Mauw, and Asher 2022; Baumgartner et al. 2020). Urman and Katz examine far-right Telegram networks (Urman and Katz 2022). Following the ban of many Russian news outlets throughout Europe, many of these same outlets have turned to Telegram to spread their content, with Russia Today and Sputnik News even having pages dedicated to showing users how to download Telegram and access their pages (Bovet and Grindrod 2022; Bergengruen 2022). Types of Unreliable Information. Unreliable information can take the form of misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda, among others (Jack 2017). Misinformation is any information that is false or inaccurate regardless of the intention of the author. Disinformation, in contrast, is false and inaccurate information spread with the express and deliberate purpose to mislead (Jack 2017). Similar to disinformation, propaganda refers to \u201cdeliberate, systematic information campaigns, usually conducted through mass media forms\u201d regardless of whether the information is true or false (Jack 2017). Within this work, we do not make distinctions between different types of topics flowing from Russian propaganda outlets, instead focusing on their overall use of Telegram and their relationships with one another. Russian Propaganda. While we do not examine specific Russian propaganda stories, instead focusing on the different Russian platforms\u2019 use of Telegram, several other works\nhave shown the widespread influence of Russian topics. For instance, following the 2016 US election, Badawy et al. found that Russian bots propagated US pro-conservative and divisive messages, especially towards users in the US South (Badawy, Ferrara, and Lerman 2018). A similar study from the RAND corporation identified two communities of over 40,000 users on Twitter that promote anti- and proRussian stories throughout eastern Europe (Helmus et al. 2018). Most closely related to our work, Hanley et al. (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b,a) examine the spread of Russian propaganda to US and Chinese social media."

Russian Propaganda and State Media. Our study examines 11 Russian propaganda and state media websites previously analyzed by the US State Department and prior work (Rus 2020; Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b,a) (Table 1). In addition, we extend our set of websites to include five additional Russian-language news websites that have been documented to spread Russian propaganda (Park et al. 2022; Aleksejeva 2022; von Twickel 2017): lug-info.com, govoritmoskva.ru, ura.news, rbc.ru, and ukraina.ru.\nFor each website, between August 20 and September 25 2022, utilizing the Go library colly and the Python library Selenium, we collected the articles published between January 1 and September 25, 2022. Specifically, for each website, we scrape 10 hops from the root page, collecting the article content published on each page (i.e., we collect all URLs linked from the homepage [1st hop], then all URLs linked from those pages [2nd hop], and so forth).\nTo extract article content and associated metadata, we use the Python libraries newspaper3k and htmldate. For our Russian-language websites, newspaper3k was largely unable to collect article content. As a result, for each of these websites, we built a custom Python script to parse out article text from the scraped HTML. Altogether, we collect the content for 215,359 articles across 16 websites (Table 1). Telegram Channels. To understand Russian platforms\u2019 use of Telegram, we curated the set of Telegram channels hyperlinked to by our set of Russian news media websites throughout 2022. Specifically, from the pages of our Russian websites, we identified 802 Telegram channels. Removing private Telegram channels and those that were censored by Telegram or deleted (i.e., @rtnews), we were left with a total 732 Telegram channels. Then, as in prior work (Hoseini et al. 2021), we scraped the public content of these channels from www.t.me/channel name/s/. For each channel, we scrape all messages that were published between January 1 and September 25, 2022. Across the 732 channels, we collect a total 2.59M Telegram messages (Table 1)."

We then segment each article into its constituent paragraphs based on where newline (\\n) or tab (\\t) characters appear within the text. We note that this segmenting approach was successful for every website except sputniknews.com and govoritmoskva.ru. For both of these websites, we built custom scripts to segment their articles based on the text block elements specified in the HTML of their websites."

The specific model version we use is fine-tuned to the semantic search task and trained to handle over 50 languages including English, Russian, and Ukrainian (the primary languages within our dataset).2 This version of MPNet was trained so\n2https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrasemultilingual-mpnet-base-v2\nthat texts with similar semantic content have higher cosine similarity. We utilize the intuition, as in Hanley et al. (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b), that when embedding text and performing subsequent analyses such as topic analysis, each embedding vector represents only one topic or idea. Any given article can contain multiple topics or ideas; thus we embed each paragraph of each article. Embedding paragraphs rather than sentences as in Hanley et al. (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b) enables us to obtain additional context while also obtaining an embedding for the (often) one topic/idea present within the paragraph. Altogether we embed 1.62M paragraphs and 2.48M Telegram messages (57 minutes utilizing an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU).\nWe emphasize that many of the articles and messages are not in English. Using the Python library langdetect, we find that 73.2% of article paragraphs are in Russian, 22.3% in English, and 2.1% in Ukrainian. The remaining belong to an assortment of other languages. Similarly, 81.3% of our Telegram dataset is in Russian, 6.0% in English, and 5.3% is in Ukrainian."

            "heading": "Comparing Semantic Content",
            "text": "We compare the semantic content of our embedded messages and paragraphs utilizing cosine similarity (Song et al. 2020). As found in previous works (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b; Vetter et al. 2022; Song et al. 2020; Bernard et al. 2022), a cosine similarity threshold between 0.60 and 0.80 can be utilized to determine whether two pieces of text are about the same topic. For instance, the same model, Phan et al. (Phan et al. 2022), found that a threshold near 0.715 achieved the best results. However, in order to further verify these past results, we perform our own evaluation to determine a threshold at which two messages/paragraphs can reliably be said to be about the same topic.\nWe take two approaches to determine the appropriate threshold for considering two paragraphs to be about the same topic. First, we take 250 random paragraph pairs with similarities at various thresholds (i.e, for 0.60, messages/paragraphs with similarities between 0.59 and 0.61) and have an expert determine whether they are about the same topic as outlined in (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b; Soper et al. 2021). We perform this evaluation in monolingual settings for English and Russian (the two most prominent languages in our dataset) and in a multilingual setting with English and Russian. Given that our expert could not speak Russian, we utilized Google Translate to translate our set of Russian paragraphs into English. As seen in Table 2, our selected pre-trained model achieves a near 85.2% topic-similarity precision at a threshold of 0.7 only for English. For Russian, and in a multilingual setting of English and Russian, our model only achieves this precision at a threshold of 0.8. This is largely in line with prior work (Verma et al. 2022) that has found that multilingual models often over-perform on English while underperforming on rarer languages.\nSecond, to confirm our manual evaluation, we utilize Chen et al.\u2019s dataset of 10K multilingual article text paragraph pairs across 18 languages (including Russian and English) annotated for whether they were about the same news\nstory (Chen et al. 2022). Analyzed across 7 criteria dimensions, this dataset labeled each paragraph pair on a scale of 1 (not about the same news story) to 4 (about the same news story). Embedding each pair with our multilingual model, we find that 93.6% of paragraph pairs with similarity above that at our selected threshold of 0.80 had very high similarity (a labeled score of 3.0 or higher). Similarly, 83.6% of pairs below this threshold had lower similarity (lower than 3.0). Benchmarking our approach with this dataset, we confirm that our cosine similarity threshold of 0.80 is a strong indication that two paragraphs are about the same story. Throughout the rest of this work, when comparing two embeddings, we utilize a threshold of 0.8. This new evaluation matches previous works\u2019 evaluation of this particular model (Huertas-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2021; Phan et al. 2022). When two messages/paragraphs reach this threshold, we consider them to be similar or to correspond with one another. Computing Similarity Scores Between Platforms. Utilizing our threshold of 0.8, we compute the percentage of different platforms\u2019 messages/paragraphs that convey the same topic. This is such that we calculate the percentage of messages/paragraphs from one website whose topic/idea appears on another website (i.e., what percentage of rt.com\u2019s paragraphs also appear on sputniknews.com and conversely what percentage of sputniknews.com\u2019s paragraphs appear on rt.com). In order to consolidate the two similarity values into one average to approximate platform similarity, we take the geometric average of two returned percentages (We take the geometric average rather than arithmetic as the two numbers are largely non-independent (Huntington 1927)). More formally, this is such that we compute two platforms/websites/channels X and Y similarity as:\nSim (X,Y ) = GMean (% of X messages onY,% of Y messages onX)\nIsolating Individual Topics In addition to identifying the similarity between individual messages/paragraphs and amongst websites, we further seek to identify individual topics/units of information within the Russian news ecosystem and track their spread. As in Hanley et al. (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b), we utilize clustering to identify topics present within our dataset. However, finding that the BERTopic-based approach utilized by Hanley et al. could not scale to our dataset, we switch to utilizing a DPMeans approach for identifying topic clusters.\nDP-Means (Dinari and Freifeld 2022) is a non-parametric extension of the K-means algorithm that does not require the specification of the number of clusters a priori. Within DP-Means, when a given datapoint is a chosen parameter \u03bb away from the closest cluster, a new cluster is formed, and that datapoint is assigned to it. As such, this enables\nus to specify how similar individual items must be to one another to be part of the same cluster. Similarly, because DPMeans is non-parametric, we do not need to know a priori how many topics are present within our dataset.\nWe note that we make three key changes to the released version of parallelizable DP-Means:3 (1) We cluster embeddings based on their cosine similarity with one another rather than Euclidean distances (also altering the cost function to consider cosine similarities); (2) We set new clusters to be formed whenever the message/paragraph is less than \u03bb = 0.8 similar to its nearest cluster; (3) We remove the random reinitialization of clusters in the released algorithm (Dinari and Freifeld 2022); we find that this step often led to over-clustering given that many website paragraphs are slight variations of each other. These changes enable us to form highly fine-grained and semantically specific topic clusters both in monolingual and multilingual settings."

            "text": "We utilize Hawkes processes to estimate the influence of the content on one platform on the content published on another. Hawkes Processes are statistical models of event frequencies that account for the effect of other processes (Linderman and Adams 2015). This is such that a Hawkes process of one set of event frequencies can model the influence of another set of frequencies of its own frequency (e.g., rt.com mentioning a story may have an effect on when and how much sputniknews.com reports on that same story). In this work, we fit the time series frequencies of particular events utilizing Gibbs sampling with settings as specified in past works (Linderman and Adams 2015).\nUpon fitting a Hawkes process model, we note that the following weights are returned: (1) backgrounds rates from each process (also captures the influence of other processes not modeled [i.e., websites not included in our dataset]), (2) influence weights of weights from each process to each other, and finally (3) shapes of the impulses of one process on another process and itself. The background rate returned models the expected rate at which events will occur without influence from past events or from processes (i.e., the rate at which a given platform writes about a given story or topic without influences from other websites or from its previous set of articles on the given topic). The influence weights model how one event on one process (i.e., one mention of a given topic) influences the frequency of events on another process. For example, a weight of two from rt.com to sputniknews.com for a given topic means that each mention of that topic results in an expected two more mentions by sputniknews.com. Finally, the shape of impulses from one process to another process models the probability that the expected events caused by the first process will occur at a given point of time on the second process (e.g., one day after, two days after, etc...)\nUtilizing these values and the steps laid out in past work (Zannettou et al. 2018), we calculate the influence of one platform on another (the percentage of a platform\u2019s messages or paragraphs that may have been caused by another\n3https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/pdc-dp-means\nplatform) as well as the efficiency of different platforms in getting their content posted elsewhere (the amount of influence each platform has on another relative to the number of messages it itself posted). Ethical Considerations We utilize only public data and follow ethical guidelines as outlined by others for scraping data (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022c). We recognize that the Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing conflict and that sensitivity about the topic is paramount. We hope that our work provides objective insight into the behavior of Russian media outlets throughout the conflict."

To do so, we first determine whether Russian state media websites promoted Telegram more often than before the onset of the war. Then, we utilize our topic clustering methodology to determine the topics that were (1) shared, (2) specific to Russian media websites, and (3) specific to Telegram.\nThe Increased Use of Telegram and the Decline of Western Platforms As seen in Figure 1a, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, activity within our set of 732 Telegram channels spiked heavily, growing from an average 6,500 messages per day to nearly 27,500. While by September 2022 posting decreased, the average remained near 11,000 messages/day, illustrating a dramatic increase in activity compared to early 2022. Plotting the top 10 external domains linked to by our set of Russian websites\u2019 articles in Figure 1b between January and September 2022, we observe an increase in the promotion of Telegram (t.me domain) by these outlets. While at the beginning of 2022, only 4.0% of links to external domains were to Telegram, this soon spiked to nearly 10.5%, remaining above 6.0% throughout the period measured. This confirms that across Russian media sites, there has been a dramatic increase in the use and promotion of Telegram since the beginning of the conflict.\nMirroring the increase in the use of Telegram, in Figure 1b, we observe a sharp decline in the use of Western social media platforms like Twitter. Consistent with both the banning of many Russian media firms by Western social media sites and the corresponding banning of Western social media platforms by the Russian government (Chee 2022; Bergengruen 2022), we observe a steady decrease in hyperlinks to Twitter from Russian state media sites. Extracting the external hyperlinks from our set of 732 Telegram channels, we similarly observe a steady decrease in the use of YouTube. Many of the most hyperlinked YouTube channels (Table 3) were pro-Russian channels that were later restricted (Wong 2022), portending the decreased use of YouTube including several different versions of Russia Today/RT. We note the presence of several conservative news websites within the top-linked youtube channels. As noted elsewhere (Stone 2022), US-based conservatives have sometimes adopted Russian state narratives surrounding the war. This is largely reflected in the number of Telegram channels linking to YouTube channels like Fox News and Metamerica. We thus see a decline in the use of Twitter and YouTube by Russian state media organizations following the invasion of Ukraine."

We thus observe a generally high degree but not complete similarity in terms of messages presented in Russian media articles compared to Telegram."

            "text": "further examine the correspondence between Telegram and our set of Russian media outlets, we determine the most similar sets of Telegram channels to each website. As seen in Table 4, several Telegram channels individually post many of the same topics present on Russian websites. Unsurprisingly, across our set of websites, the most similar telegram channels to each of our websites are the official telegram channels utilized by these online newspapers.\nBesides official channels, the channel most similar to our Russian websites is @rossiyaneevropa (14.6K subscribers), a pro-Russian channel, ostensibly run by \u201cAlexander Burenkov, director of the Institute of Russian-Slavonic Studies.\u201d As shown in Figure 3, this channel often amplifies Russian propaganda. We further observe that several other similar Telegram channels are run by Russian state-controlled media (@vzglyad ru, 88.1k subscribers) or by Russianbacked Ukrainian-separatists (@nm dnr, 85.5K subscribers; @lic lpr 31.3K subscribers; @gtrklnr lugansk24 7,361; @dnr sckk 17.2K). In addition, to these channels, we further find two of the other most similar Telegrams (not shown in Table 4) @rentv news (49,731 subscribers) and @killnet reservs (93,919 subscribers) are pro-Russian chan-\nnels that often repeat or rebroadcast videos, official documents from the Russian government, disinformation, and anti-American and anti-Ukrainian messages. For example on October 10, 2022, @killnet reservs posted a message advocating for their subscribers to disrupt US infrastructure: We invite everyone to commit DDOS on the civilian network infrastructure of the United States of America! Subject to DDOS attacks are:- All Airports - Marine terminals and logistics facilities - Monitoring weather centers - Health care system - Metro (buying tickets, registering the route) - Exchanges and online trading systems.4\nWe note that while we utilize this methodology to identify the messages that bear the closest resemblance to specific Russian websites, and thus to content sponsored by Russian=-state media, among our set of 732 Telegram channels, this methodology can be easily extended to identify suspect Telegram channels that repeat or mention propaganda on a much wider scale, which we leave to future work. Most Prominent Topics in Shared Ecosystems. Next, to understand the most prominent topics present among all shared texts between Telegram and Russian websites, we utilize our cluster algorithm outlined in Section 4. Specifically, we cluster only the set of paragraphs from Russian websites that had a corresponding Telegram message together with all Telegram messages that had a corresponding paragraph on a Russian website; altogether this consists of 2,712,237 messages/paragraphs (66.24% of all texts [from both Telegram and Russian articles]). We note, as previously discussed, that due to the intrinsic guarantees of our clustering algorithms, each embedding has a high cosine similarity with the center. After clustering with \u03bb = 0.8, our embeddings had an average of 0.882 cosine similarity with their respective cluster centers. Each cluster had an average cosine similarity of 0.0292 with the remaining cluster centers. This illustrates the degree of semantic cohesiveness within each cluster and that each cluster is distinct. For each cluster, in order to build an intuition for the topic, we extract the most representative paragraph/message from the cluster by cosine similarity to\n4https://web.archive.org/web/20221011223806/https: //t.me/s/killnet reservs\nthe cluster center. Determining the top topics by the number of articles, the most shared topic within our datasets concerned the destruction of buildings following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, specifically, the operations in the Luhansk region (Table 5). This was largely anticipated given how pivotal the Donbas region became to the war and propaganda surrounding it (Larys\u030c and Souleimanov 2022); 19,647 separate articles and Telegram messages mention the topic. The second most popular topic with 9,929 messages/articles was about the actual invasion of Ukraine by Russian units. Within Vladimir Putin\u2019s declaration indicating Russia\u2019s intention to invade Ukraine, he called for a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to \u201cdenazify\u201d and \u201cdemilitarize\u201d Ukraine. We see this particular language repeated by both Russian propaganda outlets and Telegram channels. The third topic (again a specific aspect of the war) concerns the Russian bombing of the Khmelnytsky region of Ukraine on April 28, 2022."

We cluster only the set of paragraphs from Russian sites that did not have a corresponding Telegram message in our dataset (17,357 paragraphs from 120,198 articles). Across this clustering, each paragraph had an average 0.926 cosine similarity with their respective cluster center. Each cluster has an average similarity of 0.0674 with other clusters in the dataset, illustrating the semantic cohesiveness of our clusters.\nAs seen in Table 5, the most common topic specific to Russian news websites concerned the extraction of gas from Ukraine to Europe; an estimated 635 articles across our 16 news websites were associated with this topic. As noted by others, following the Russian invasion, the sanctions on Russian gas and oil to Europe have caused enormous major economic fallout (Soldatkin, Donovan, and Faulconbridge 2022) and we see mentions of this topic repeated across our Russian media ecosystem. Besides content concerning the shipment of gas from Ukraine to Europe, we further see content about protests in Iran that followed the death of Mahsa\nAmini on September 16, 2022 (436 articles) and calls for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine (197 articles)."

Each cluster center has an average cosine similarity of -0.0708 with the other clusters.\nAs seen in Table 5, many of the most prominent messages concern specific day-to-day updates on the war in Ukraine (Topic 2 and 3). For example, the topic cluster with the second most Telegram messages concerns updates on the rocket launches of a Ukrainian city (Holder, Hernandez, and Huang 2022). The Telegram topic with the most corresponding messages however concerns an interview with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on the possibility of peace in the Donbas region in Ukraine. We thus see within many of these Telegram-specific content clusters highly specific updates about news and individual interviews rather than larger news stories."

            "heading": "6 The Spread of Topics",
            "text": "Having analyzed the static behavior of the topics shared among our Telegram and Russian news ecosystems, in this section, we examine the speed at which topics spread amongst and between Russian websites and Telegram channels. To estimate the spread of topics amongst and between different Russian websites and Telegram channels, we first cluster all 4,094,510 texts (Telegram messages and paragraphs from articles) as specified in Section 4. Across this new clustering, with 29,875 unique centers, each message/paragraph had an average cosine similarity of 0.883, with its respective cluster center. Clusters have an average cosine similarity of 0.0321 with the remaining clusters. We note that when performing our analysis using the timestamps of our article and Telegram messages that because we managed determined the publish date and not exact timing information (i.e., the hour and second of publication), we perform our analysis on the scale of days. This is such that we consider a Telegram message to precede an article only if it was published at least a day before an article (e.g., 04-05-2022 before 04-06-2022). Content First Published on Telegram and Russian Websites. To understand the interchange of topics between our Russian website and Telegram datasets, we first determine the percentage of each website\u2019s topics that began on Telegram and vice versa. We note that for this analysis, we remove the set of Telegram channels that operate in coordination with each of our news websites. This enables us to determine how much each website\u2019s content begins on ostensibly \u201cindependent\u201d (i.e., not controlled by same Rusianstate media entities) Telegram channels.5 Determining the\n5We remove the following Telegram channels: tass agency, tassagency en, uranews, radiogovoritmsk, ukraina ru, rbc news,\namount of a website\u2019s content that each cluster contains (i.e., the number of paragraphs), we thus determine the percentage of each platform\u2019s content that was first posted on Telegram (Table 6).\nAs seen in Table 6, even after removing official Russian Telegram channels, most of our websites had a noticeable portion of their content that was first posted on Telegram. This is particularly true of websites like waronfakes.com (28.2%), ura.news (25.6%), and ukraina.ru (27.9%). Across all websites, 13.9% of their topics began on Telegram, accounting for 18.4% of all paragraphs in our dataset. We further see that as a whole 33.2% of Telegram\u2019s topics began on Russian websites, accounting that 24.3% of all Telegram content. Thus while several of our news websites like waronfakes.com, ura.news, ukraina.ru, rbc.ru, indeed publish content after it first appears (at least a day later) on Telegram, Telegram channels themselves also utilize topics from Russian news sources for nearly a third of their topics.\nExamining the set of Telegram channels that most often posted each website\u2019s content first in Table 7, we see the Telegram channels @kalaruny (159K subscribers), @new militarycolumnist (213K), and @bbbreaking (1.38M) often post content first across nearly all of our websites. As reported elsewhere, @karaulny (screen name Karaulny-Z) is a pro-Russian government channel that\nsouthfronteng, strategic culture, waronfakesen, warfakeres, warfakes, warfakebelgorod, warfakeskrm, warfakeszo, and warfakers.\nabides by a \u201cstop list\u201d of prohibited topics and that was purchased by supporters of the Kremlin in 2017 (Rothrock 2018). @new militarycolumnist, another pro-Russian channel, gives continuous updates on the Russian military (Sabah 2020). Finally, @bbbreaking, another pro-Russian Russianlanguage channel, with the motto \u201cEarlier than others. Almost\u201d appears to also in several cases give updates on the news before many of our Russian news websites. Influence Estimation through Hawkes Process. As just seen, a substantial portion of the content on websites like waronfakes.com, ura.news, and rbc.ru first appears on Telegram. Despite this and even given the close relationship that many of these websites have with our set of Telegram channels, it is largely infeasible to know definitively if these topics\u2019 appearance on Telegram caused their later appearance on our set of websites. However, in this section, we utilize Hawkes Processes, in order to estimate the probability that a message first appearing on a given Telegram influenced a given website to write about similar content. Utilizing this approach, we give the estimated percentage of content that appears on one platform that may have been caused by another platform as well as the efficiency of this influence.\nAs previously specified, to estimate the influence of one platform on another (Section 2), we fit 17 Hawkes interacting processes (one for each platform) using Gibbs sampling for our 28.9K topic clusters and utilizing the daily frequencies of each website reporting on each of these topics (Linderman and Adams 2015; Zannettou et al. 2018). We report the estimated percentage of each platform\u2019s paragraph/messages that may have been caused by the other platforms in our dataset (Figure 4). We note that because we limited our study to our set of 16 websites and 732 Telegram other platforms\u2019 influence would be included within\neach website\u2019s estimated influence on itself. Plotting the estimated influence of each website on each other and on Telegram, we see in Figure 4, that Telegram typically has a moderate estimated influence on the content published on each of the websites. Specifically, Telegram has a possible influence on the 25.2% of content on katehon.com, 28.4% on news-front.info, 23.% on rbc.ru, and 31.7% on ukrain.ru. Conversely, it has the weakest influence on the website ura.news (despite often writing about its topics prior to ura.news [Table 6]). Conversely, with the smallest amount of articles, we see that geopolitika.ru also smallest estimated influence on Telegram. Conversely, as largely expected, we see in the estimated topic spread efficiency in Figure 5 that many of our websites are fairly efficient at seeing their content migrate to Telegram, with waronfakes.com being the best at 18.8% efficiency. This indicates across our websites, many of them do not have to post many articles before that article\u2019s topic appears on Telegram.\nIn addition, to estimating the influence of each website on our set of Telegram channels, we further estimate the relationships that each website has with one another. As largely expected prominent websites like rt.com and sputniknews.com have the largest estimated possible influence on the content of one another relative to other websites (around 6% [Figure 4]). Looking at the efficiency of these influence relationships, we see again a stronger relationship between many of the large English-language Russian news sites (tass.com, sputniknews.com, and rt.com) at 7%. Similarly, we see again that news-front.info, which has been previously documented as heavily influencing conversations within Russian propaganda ecosystems (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b) has a marked estimated influence on other websites, playing a possible role in nearly 3% of the\ncontent on each of other websites. Speed of Spread of Topics From Russian Websites. Having estimated the influence of each website, we now model and determine how quickly, on average, original content from each of our websites and Telegram channels travel to other websites and Telegram channels. As in Section 5, we perform this analysis on the scale of days. As seen in Figure 6a, on average, katehon.com and ura.news\u2019s topics tend to spread the fastest among the other websites in our dataset. Across all topics, we further observe that after initially spiking in popularity on the first day it is published, it often takes a longer period of time for it spread throughout the entire ecosystem. Examining each story individually, we find one of the fastest to spread was a story that originated on sputniknews.com, rt.com, and tass.com. This story, which reached every website within six days, was about Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy potentially meeting sometime in the future with the help of the United Nations.6\nExamining the spread of each website\u2019s content to our set of 732 Telegram channels in Figure 6b, we see that on average, stories do not typically spread to more than approximately 20 Telegram channels within the first 100 days. Furthermore, we see that the websites whose content spreads\n6https://web.archive.org/web/20220919021146/https: //sputniknews.com/20220919/putin-zelensky-meeting-farfrom-possible-but-un-ready-to-help-facilitate-guterres-says1100939551.html\nthe fastest katehon.com and ura.news, are again the websites whose content spreads the quickest on Telegram. Indeed, we see among our websites, katehon.com, ura.news, ukraina.ru, and news-front.info, are the best progenitors of content across both other websites as well as Telegram. This adheres to results in prior work that show newsfront.info and katehon.com as two of the key creators of Russian propaganda on the Internet (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022b; Rus 2020). Again examining one of the most prolific stories, we find that one from katehon.com about the military results of the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine spread to 613 different Telegram channels.7\nSpread of Topics From Telegram Channels. We now examine the rate at which topics spread from some Telegram channels amongst themselves and to Russian websites. We display the set of 16 Telegram channels whose content spreads the furthest (i.e., have the topic clusters where their channel posted about a topic first that spread far). As seen in Figure 7, the Telegram channel most effective at originating content/topics that are then reposted elsewhere both on Telegram and within the Russian website ecosystem is @gensab (86.9K subscribers). A pro-Russian propaganda channel, the channel continuously comments on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, writing on August 29th: \u201cKyiv launched a widely\n7https://web.archive.org/web/20220510150650/ttps: //katehon.com//ru/news/igor-strelkov-itogi-pervogo-dnyaboevyh-deystviy-i-ih-kratkiy-analiz\npublicized \u201coffensive\u201d on Kherson. Due to the clumsy, on the verge of debility fake propaganda, the offensive is developing so far only in the minds of propagandists and those who believe them.\u201d8 Finally again, examining the individual topics from Telegram channels that spread the furthest, we see a message from @uranews about the Donbas regions of Ukraine ostensibly wanting to declare independence and join Russia that spread to over 557 channels.9 We further see a message from the pro-Russian Telegram channel @optimisticus007 (35,511 subscribers) that spread to all our websites echoing the desire for Russia to win in Ukraine.10"

            "text": "In this work, we explored the usage of Telegram by Russian news websites. We find that, unexpectedly, Russian media organizations have not only dramatically increased their usage of Telegram, but are regularly sourcing news topics from the messaging platform. To do this we introduced a new, scalable methodology for tracking news narratives across multiple languages and platforms. Our approach, unlike past work, does not depend on dimensionality reduction across all articles at once nor a complete pair-wise similarity calculation, which allows us to scale to several orders of magnitude more articles and to track topics across 215K news articles and 2.5M Telegram messages. We discuss several implications and future directions of this work here. Identifying Propaganda Channels. As briefly discussed in Section 5, our approach can also be used to identify new telegram channels that align with Russian state-promoted narratives. As seen in Table 4, the method identified Telegram channels that supported anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russianseparatist sentiments in an automated fashion (e.g., @lic lpr, @gtrklnr lugansk24, @dnr sckk) as well as several channels that largely repeated Russian state-media topics (e.g., @rossiyaneevropa, @pintofmind, @russtrat) (Afroz and Sehgal 2022). We note that this method can further be utilized beyond Russian and Ukrainian-focused topics to identify websites that are similar to disinformation, hyperpartisan, or other types of malicious websites. Content Spreading From Different Platforms. In utilizing MPNet, DP-Means clustering, and Hawkes Process, we estimated the role of Telegram and identified the most influential Russian websites within our ecosystem. Unlike past work that has relied on the presence of hyperlinks (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2022c; La Morgia et al. 2021), our approach approximates influence by directly measuring topics themselves. This approach can be extended to understand how larger platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter interact with Russian propaganda. While we limited ourselves to analyzing the semantic correspondence of Russian websites, the approach can be used to estimate the influence of and on news websites more generally (e.g., cnn.com,\n8https://web.archive.org/web/20220829120625/https: //t.me/genshab/846\n9https://web.archive.org/web/20220515075654/https: //t.me/uranews/41595\n10https://web.archive.org/web/20220515083452/https: //t.me/optimisticus007/155\nfoxnews.com). Responding to Propaganda. As seen in this work, for websites like waronfakes.com, over 30% of their content appears on Telegram at least a day before appearing on the website. By monitoring and understanding the Telegram ecosystem, researchers and fact-checkers can more quickly respond to topics that start on Telegram and make their way to other news sites. We argue that by ignoring Telegram, the research community has discounted a large and influential aspect of Russian propaganda pathways."
