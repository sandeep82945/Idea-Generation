    "abstractText": "In this paper, the gentlest ascent dynamics (GAD) developed in W. E and X. Zhou (2011) [21] is extended to a constrained gentlest ascent dynamics (CGAD) to find constrained saddle points with any specified Morse indices. It is proved that the linearly stable steady state of the proposed CGAD is exactly a nondegenerate constrained saddle point with a corresponding Morse index. Meanwhile, the locally exponential convergence of an idealized CGAD near nondegenerate constrained saddle points with corresponding indices is also verified. The CGAD is then applied to find excited states of single-component Bose\u2013Einstein condensates (BECs) in the order of their Morse indices via computing constrained saddle points of the corresponding Gross\u2013Pitaevskii energy functional under the normalization constraint. In addition, properties of the excited states of BECs in the linear/nonlinear cases are mathematically/numerically studied. Extensive numerical results are reported to show the effectiveness and robustness of our method and demonstrate some interesting physics.",

            "text": "Saddle points appear widely in various scientific fields as, for example, excited states in atomic, molecular and optical systems or transition states in chemical reactions. Particularly, the index-1 saddle point is a central concept in the study of rare events, which corresponds to the transition state between metastable states in randomly perturbed system [20, 21]. In practice, excited states in some scenarios only occur instantaneously. And, transition states usually occur with very low probability. Owning to these difficulties in direct experimental observation, the effective numerical search of saddle points has attracted more and more attentions. Different numerical algorithms for finding saddle points have been carried out in the literature in recent decades, most of which are related to unconstrained saddle points. However, many physical/chemical/biological systems in practical scientific problems are constrained by one or more physical constraints, e.g., the wave function of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC) is constrained by one or more normalization conditions [15, 3]. And, the volume and surface area of a biological vesicle membrane are fixed to be prescribed constants in the phase field model [18, 13]. This motivates us to concern finding constrained saddle points.\n\u2217Corresponding author. Email addresses: wliu@m.scnu.edu.cn (Wei Liu), ziqingxie@hunnu.edu.cn (Ziqing Xie),\nyuanyongjun0301@163.com (Yongjun Yuan)\nIn terms of numerical methods for finding unconstrained saddle points of given nonconvex energy functionals or multiple unstable solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, we refer to the mountain-pass algorithm [14], the high-linking algorithm [17], the local minimax method (LMM) [30], the search extension method [11], the bifurcation method [37], the string method [20], the gentlest ascent dynamics (GAD) [21], the dimer method [26] and the shrinking dimer dynamics (SDD) [44], etc. Typically, the GAD developed by E and Zhou [21] is a continuous dynamical system that describes the escape from the attractive basins of stable invariant sets. It is proved that the linearly stable steady state of the GAD proposed in [21] is exactly an index-1 saddle point. And, due to its simplicity and effectiveness, the GAD has been applied to compute index-1 saddle points in many problems [29, 28, 45]. Several variants of the GAD such as the iterative minimization algorithm [22] and the multiscale GAD [24], were presented in literature. In [35], Quapp and Bofill proposed a generalized GAD algorithm that can compute unconstrained high-index saddle points. In addition, the SDD proposed by Zhang and Du [43] is closely related to the GAD. In fact, the SDD can be obtained by approximating the Hessian in the formulation of the GAD with first-order derivatives and introducing an additional dynamics for shrinking the length of the so-called dimer. Recently, Yin, Zhang and Zhang [41] extended the SDD to find unconstrained high-index saddle points, and proposed a high-index optimization-based shrinking dimer (HiOSD) method.\nThere have existed several effective numerical methods in the literature to find constrained saddle points. In [19], Zhang and Du proposed a constrained string method to compute the minimum energy path (MEP) with given constraints. In this way, the index-1 constrained saddle point given by the local maximizer of the energy functional on the MEP can be obtained accordingly. In a subsequent work of [44], Zhang and Du also proposed a constrained SDD (CSDD) [43] to search index-1 constrained saddle points. In [28], Li, Lu and Yang modified the GAD to find index-1 saddle points of the Kohn\u2013Sham density functional under the orthonormality constraints. Other numerical methods for finding constrained saddle points include the LMM based on the Rayleigh quotient or the active Lagrangian [39, 40], the LMM using virtual geometric objects [31], and the Ljusternik\u2013 Schnirelman minimax algorithm [38]. These methods can be regarded as the variants of the original LMM developed by Li and Zhou in [30] and corresponding two-level optimization problems have to be solved. In summary, the above mentioned methods are mainly used to compute index-1 constrained saddle points or their efficiency are needed to be further improved. Thus, efficient numerical methods as well as the corresponding theoretical analysis are still called for to compute the general high-index constrained saddle points.\nOne of the important applications of computing constrained saddle points is to find the excited states of BECs. The BEC was first realized experimentally in dilute weakly interacting gases in 1995 [1, 8, 16]. As is known, one of the basic problems in numerical studies of BEC is to determine the stationary states, i.e., the critical points of the energy functional under certain normalization constraints, by the mean field Gross\u2013Pitaevskii (GP) theory. In the physics literatures, the stationary state with the lowest energy is called the ground state of BEC, whereas the stationary states with higher energies are usually called excited states. In the past two decades, based on the Gross\u2013 Pitaevskii equations (GPEs), many effective numerical methods for computing the ground states of BECs have been developed, as reviewed in, e.g., [3]. However, the numerical methods for finding excited states of BECs are still relatively limited. The normalized gradient flow or the imaginary time evolution method [5], as one of the most popular techniques for computing the ground states of BECs, has been extended to compute the \u2018first\u2019 excited states of single-component BECs with symmetries, see, e.g., [5, 2]. In addition, some continuation algorithms [10, 12] and Newton-based iterative algorithm [36] are also designed to compute excited states of BECs. However, the convergence of these methods depend on the choice of initial data, and more efficient and accurate methods to compute excited states of BECs are still worthwhile explored.\nIn this paper, we are interested in developing a continuous dynamical system to stably search for constrained saddle points with any specified Morse indices. Due to the difficulties caused by\nconstraints, instability, nonlinearity and nonconvexity, it is quite challenging to find constrained saddle points with general constraints in a stable way, especially for high-index ones. Inspired by the works of the original GAD [21] for index-1 unconstrained saddle points and the CSDD [43] for index-1 constrained saddle points, we are aimed to propose a constrained gentlest ascent dynamics (CGAD) to compute general constrained saddle points with any specified indices and analyze its linear stability and local convergence. Further, we apply the CGAD to simulate excited states of BECs to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness and then illustrate an interesting problem, i.e., the relation among the GP energies, chemical potentials and Morse indices of the excited states (as constrained saddle points) of BECs. In fact, it was found numerically that both the GP energy and chemical potential of the excited state increase with the increase of its Morse index, whereas the excited states with the same index may be at different energy levels.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the definitions of constrained saddle points and their Morse indices. In section 3, we briefly review the original GAD and construct the CGAD to search for index-k constrained saddle points. In section 4, the mathematical justifications of the CGAD, including the linear stability and the local convergence of an idealized CGAD, are analyzed. In section 5, the CGAD is implemented to find some excited states of single-component BECs. Several interesting mathematical properties of excited states and the detailed numerical results in 1D and 2D are presented. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in section 6."

The constrained critical point that is not local extremizer (i.e., maximizer or minimizer) is called a constrained saddle point.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the constraints (2.1) are regular, i.e., their gradients G\u2032i(u), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, are linearly independent for all u \u2208 M. Then M is a C2 differential manifold, and its tangent space at u \u2208 M is given by TuM = {v \u2208 X : \u3008G\u2032i(u), v\u3009 = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m}. A direct computation shows that the orthogonal projection operator from X onto the tangent space TuM at u \u2208 M takes\nPu = I \u2212 m \u2211\ni=1\nm \u2211\nj=1\ngij(u) [ G\u2032i(u)\u2297G\u2032j(u) ] , (2.3)\nwhere I is the identity operator, gij(u) are the (i, j)-elements of the inverse to the (positive definite) Gram matrix [\u3008G\u2032i(u), G\u2032j(u)\u3009]i,j=1,2,...,m, and \u2297 denotes the tensor product operator defined as (v \u2297 w)\u03be = \u3008w, \u03be\u3009v, \u2200v,w, \u03be \u2208 X. The projected gradient of E at u \u2208 M can be written as\nF (u) := PuE \u2032(u) = E\u2032(u)\u2212\nm \u2211\ni=1\n\u00b5i(u)G \u2032 i(u), (2.4)\nwith \u00b5i(u) = \u2211m j=1 gij(u) \u2329 G\u2032j(u), E \u2032(u) \u232a , i = 1, 2, . . . ,m. Clearly, u\u2217 \u2208 X is a constrained critical point of E on M if and only if Gi(u\u2217) = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and F (u\u2217) = 0.\nFor u \u2208 M, denoting H(u) := E\u2032\u2032(u)\u2212 \u2211m i=1 \u00b5i(u)G \u2032\u2032 i (u) the effective Hessian operator [34], we\ndefine the projected Hessian operator\nH\u0302(u) = PuH(u)Pu : TuM \u2192 TuM, (2.5)\nwhich is a self-adjoint linear operator on the tangent space TuM. Similar to the concept of Morse indices for unconstrained critical points [9], the stability/instability of a constrained critical point u \u2208 M can be depicted by examining the spectrum of the linear operator H\u0302(u). More precisely, we introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 2.2. Assume that u\u2217 is a constrained critical point of E on the manifold M. Let Tu\u2217M = T\u2212 \u2295 T 0 \u2295 T+, dim(T 0) < \u221e, where T\u2212, T 0 and T+ are, respectively, the maximum negative, null, and maximum positive subspaces according to the spectral decomposition of the linear operator H\u0302(u\u2217) : Tu\u2217M \u2192 Tu\u2217M. The Morse index of u\u2217 is defined as index(u\u2217) = dim(T\u2212). u\u2217 is nondegenerate if T 0 = {0}. Otherwise, u\u2217 is degenerate and dim(T 0) is called its nullity. When index(u\u2217) = k (k = 1, 2, . . .), u\u2217 is called an index-k constrained saddle point, T\u2212 is called its unstable (tangent) subspace and each nonzero vector in T\u2212 is called an unstable (tangent) direction at u\u2217."

The first equation in (3.1) can be obtained by performing the Householder transformation for the gradient flow with respect to the auxiliary unit vector v, where the last term in it makes v a stable direction. The second equation in (3.1), evolving the vector v, is constructed by solving the Rayleigh quotient minimization problem min\u2016v\u2016=1\u3008E\u2032\u2032(u)v, v\u3009, which makes v approximate the unstable direction of the target index-1 saddle point. It was proved in [21] that, for an appropriately smooth energy function E defined on an Euclidean space, the linearly stable steady state of the GAD (3.1) is exactly an index-1 saddle point of E.\n3.2. CGAD for index-1 constrained saddle points\nThe aim of this section is to propose the CGAD for finding constrained saddle points with any specified indices. To clarify the idea, we first construct the formulation of the CGAD to search for index-1 constrained saddle points.\nLet u \u2208 M be an approximation of an index-1 constrained saddle point of E on the constraint manifold M = {u \u2208 X : Gi(u) = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m}, and the unit vector v \u2208 TuM be an approximation of the corresponding unstable tangent direction, see Fig. 1 (left). We discuss below how to construct the evolution equations of u and v.\nv TuM u\nM\nTuM\nu\nv\nFCGAD \u2212F (u)\nwith the initial data (u(0), v(0)) = (u0, v0) satisfying u0 \u2208 M, v0 \u2208 Tu0M and \u2016v0\u20162 = 1. The Lagrange multipliers \u03bb and \u03bb\u0304i (i = 1, 2, . . . ,m) in (3.7) are chosen such that the flow preserves the constraints \u2016v\u20162 = 1 and \u3008G\u2032i(u), v\u3009 = 0 (i = 1, 2, . . . ,m), respectively. Therefore, \u3008v, v\u0307\u3009 = 0 and \u3008G\u2032i(u), v\u0307\u3009+ \u3008G\u2032\u2032i (u)u\u0307, v\u3009 = 0, which lead to\n\u03bb = \u3008H\u0302(u)v, v\u3009, \u03bb\u0304i = m \u2211\nj=1\ngij(u) \u2329 G\u2032\u2032j (u)v, F (u)\u2212 2\u3008F (u), v\u3009v \u232a , i = 1, 2, . . . ,m.\n3.3. CGAD for high-index constrained saddle points\nNow, we extend the index-1 CGAD (3.7) to general high-index cases. To construct the CGAD for finding an index-k (k = 1, 2, 3, . . .) constrained saddle point of the energy functional E \u2208 C2(X,R) on the constraint manifoldM, we need to consider k linearly independent unstable tangent directions v1, v2, . . . , vk \u2208 TuM (see Fig. 2). Let u \u2208 M be an approximation of an index-k constrained saddle point and V = span{v1, v2, . . . , vk} the approximation of corresponding unstable subspace. Denote W by the orthogonal complement of V in TuM.\nIn order to make u move towards an index-k constrained saddle point, the force that evolves u needs to be in the tangent space TuM with its components in V and W increasing and decreasing the energy, respectively. It is natural to evolve u by the steepest ascent dynamics in V and the steepest descent dynamics in W , i.e., the dynamics for u is as\nu\u0307 = FV (u)\u2212 FW (u), (3.8)\nwhere FV (u) and FW (u) = F (u) \u2212 FV (u) are the orthogonal projections of the projected gradient F (u) = PuE\n\u2032(u) on V and W , respectively. If v1, v2, . . . , vk \u2208 TuM satisfy the orthonormal conditions: \u3008vi, vj\u3009 = \u03b4ij , then FV (u) = \u2211k j=1\u3008F (u), vj\u3009vj , and (3.8) becomes\nu\u0307 = \u2212F (u) + 2FV (u) = \u2212F (u) + 2 k \u2211\nj=1\n\u3008F (u), vj\u3009vj . (3.9)\nIt is worthwhile to point out that, if u is an index-k constrained saddle point, its unstable directions v1, v2, . . . , vk can be taken as the orthonormal eigenvectors of the projected Hessian H\u0302(u) corresponding to the k smallest and negative eigenvalues. By the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle [42], the eigenvector v1 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue can be obtained by minimizing \u3008H\u0302(u)v1, v1\u3009 under the constraints v1 \u2208 TuM and \u2016v1\u20162 = 1. And, when eigenvectors v1, v2, . . . , vi\u22121 of H\u0302(u) corresponding to the first i \u2212 1 smallest eigenvalues are known, the eigenvector vi corresponding to the i-th smallest eigenvalue can be obtained by solving the following Rayleigh-Ritz minimization problem [42]\nmin vi\n\u3008H\u0302(u)vi, vi\u3009 s.t. vi \u2208 TuM, \u3008vi, vj\u3009 = \u03b4ij , j = 1, 2, . . . , i.

The following lemma will play important role in the subsequent analysis, with its proof detailed in Appendix B.\nLemma 4.1. Assume that E,Gi \u2208 C2, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and the constraints (2.1) are regular.

Linear stability of the CGAD\nWe now show that the linearly stable steady state of the CGAD (3.11) is exactly a nondegenerate index-k constrained saddle point of E on the manifold M. Similar results of the GAD for unconstrained saddle points and the CSDD for index-1 constrained saddle point can be found in [21, 41] and [43], respectively.\nTheorem 4.2. Assume that E,Gl \u2208 C3, l = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and the constraints (2.1) are regular. Let u\u2217 \u2208 M and v\u2217i \u2208 Tu\u2217M, i = 1, 2, . . . , k, satisfy \u3008v\u2217i , v\u2217j \u3009 = \u03b4ij .\n(a) (u\u2217, v\u22171 , . . . , v \u2217 k) is a steady state of (3.11) if and only if u \u2217 is a constrained critical point of E\non the manifold M and v\u2217i , i = 1, 2, . . . , k, are eigenvectors of H\u0302(u\u2217).\n(b) (u\u2217, v\u22171 , . . . , v \u2217 k) is a linearly stable steady state of (3.11) if and only if the following hold:\n(i) u\u2217 is a nondegenerate index-k constrained saddle point of E on the manifold M; (ii) all the eigenvalues of H\u0302(u\u2217), say {\u03bb\u2217i }, satisfy \u03bb\u22171 < \u03bb\u22172 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03bb\u2217k < 0 < \u03bb\u2217k+1 \u2264 \u03bb\u2217k+2 \u2264\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; (iii) for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, v\u2217i is the eigenvector of H\u0302(u \u2217) corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb\u2217i .\nProof. (a) Necessity. Suppose that (u\u2217, v\u22171 , . . . , v \u2217 k) is a steady state of (3.11), i.e.,\n\u2212F (u\u2217) + 2 k \u2211\ni=1\n\u3008F (u\u2217), v\u2217i \u3009v\u2217i = 0, (4.2)\n\u2212H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217i + i \u2211\nj=1\n\u03bb\u2217ijv \u2217 j +\nm \u2211\nl=1\n\u03bb\u0304\u2217ilG \u2032 l(u \u2217) = 0, i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k, (4.3)\nwhere \u03bb\u2217ij and \u03bb\u0304 \u2217 il are given in (3.12)-(3.13) with (u, v1, . . . , vk) replaced by (u \u2217, v\u22171 , . . . , v \u2217 k). Noting that \u3008v\u2217i , v\u2217j \u3009 = \u03b4ij , taking the inner product in both sides of (4.2) with v\u2217j yields \u3008F (u\u2217), v\u2217j \u3009 = 0,\nj = 1, 2, . . . , k. Therefore, F (u\u2217) = 0, i.e., u\u2217 is a constrained critical point. Moreover, by (3.13), we have \u03bb\u0304\u2217il = 0, thus (4.3) becomes\nH\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217i = i \u2211\nj=1\n\u03bb\u2217ijv \u2217 j , i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k. (4.4)\nTaking the inner product in both side of (4.4) with v\u2217l (\u2200l < i) implies that \u3008H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217i , v\u2217l \u3009 = \u2211i\nj=1 \u03bb \u2217 ij\u3008v\u2217j , v\u2217l \u3009 = \u03bb\u2217il, which states \u03bb\u2217il = 0 (otherwise, one gets a contradiction with (3.12)).\nConsequently, H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217i = \u03bb \u2217 iiv \u2217 i , i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k, i.e., {(\u03bb\u2217ii, v\u2217i )}ki=1 are eigenpairs of H\u0302(u\u2217).\nSufficiency. Suppose that u\u2217 is a constrained critical point of E on the manifold M and v\u2217i (i = 1, 2, . . . , k) are eigenvectors of H\u0302(u\u2217). Then F (u\u2217) = 0, (4.2) is satisfied, and \u03bb\u0304\u2217il = 0. On the other hand, for each i = 1, 2, . . . , k, since v\u2217i is an eigenvector of H\u0302(u \u2217), there exists an \u03c9\u2217i \u2208 R such that H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217i = \u03c9 \u2217 i v \u2217 i . We have\n\u03bb\u2217ij = (1 + \u03b3i/\u03b3j \u2212 \u03b4ij)\u3008H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217i , v\u2217j \u3009 = (1 + \u03b3i/\u03b3j \u2212 \u03b4ij)\u03c9\u2217i \u03b4ij = \u03c9\u2217i \u03b4ij .\nThus, (4.3) holds. Consequently, (u\u2217, v\u22171 , . . . , v \u2217 k) is a steady state of (3.11).\n(b) Consider the Jacobian operator of the right-hand-side of (3.11), denoted by J .

Let \u03bb \u2217 k+1 \u2264 \u03bb\u2217k+2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 be all other eigenvalues of H\u0302(u\u2217) and v\u2217k+1, v \u2217 k+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2208 Tu\u2217M be the corresponding eigenvectors. Due to H\u0302(u\u2217) is self-adjoint and {v\u2217j }kj=1 is orthonormal, one may assume that {v\u2217j }j\u22651 is an orthonormal system. It is calculated that\nJ00v \u2217 l =\n1\n\u03b30\n(\n2\nk \u2211\nj=1\n\u03bb\u2217j\u3008v\u2217j , v\u2217l \u3009v\u2217j \u2212 H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217l ) =\n{\n(\u03bb\u2217l /\u03b30)v \u2217 l , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 k, \u2212(\u03bb\u2217l /\u03b30)v\u2217l , l > k,\nJiiv \u2217 l =\n\u03bb\u2217i v \u2217 l \u2212 H\u0302(u\u2217)v\u2217l\n\u03b3i +\ni \u2211\nj=1\n(\n1 \u03b3i + 1 \u03b3j\n) \u03bb\u2217j\u3008v\u2217j , v\u2217l \u3009v\u2217j = { (\u03bb\u2217i /\u03b3i + \u03bb \u2217 l /\u03b3l)v \u2217 l , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 i,\n((\u03bb\u2217i \u2212 \u03bb\u2217l )/\u03b3i)v\u2217l , l > i.\nHence all eigenvalues of J are given as\n{\u03bb\u2217i /\u03b30, \u2212\u03bb\u2217l /\u03b30, \u03bb\u2217i /\u03b3i + \u03bb\u2217r/\u03b3r, (\u03bb\u2217i \u2212 \u03bb\u2217s)/\u03b3i, \u2200 1 \u2264 r \u2264 i \u2264 k < l, s > i} .\nThus, (u\u2217, v\u22171 , . . . , v \u2217 k) is a linearly stable steady state of (3.11) if and only if all eigenvalues of J are negative, i.e., \u03bb\u22171 < \u03bb \u2217 2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03bb\u2217k < 0 < \u03bb\u2217k+1 \u2264 \u03bb\u2217k+2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . Equivalently, (i) u\u2217 is a nondegenerate index-k constrained saddle point; (ii) all eigenvalues of H\u0302(u\u2217) satisfy \u03bb\u22171 < \u03bb \u2217 2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03bb\u2217k < 0 < \u03bb\u2217k+1 \u2264 \u03bb\u2217k+2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; and (iii) v\u2217i is the eigenvector of H\u0302(u\u2217) corresponding to \u03bb\u2217i , i = 1, 2, . . . , k.\nRemark 4.3. For the index-1 case, the condition/conclusion (ii) in part (b) of Theorem 4.2 does not need to appear in the theorem since it is implied by the nondegeneracy in (i).\n4.2. Locally exponential convergence of an idealized CGAD\nDue to the complexity of constraints and nonlinearities, there are some potential difficulties in directly analyzing the global convergence of the CGAD (3.11). For simplicity, based on a similar idea to the study on an idealized version of the original GAD in [27], we consider the following idealized CGAD:\nu\u0307 = \u2212F (u) + 2 k \u2211\ni=1\n\u3008F (u), vi(u)\u3009vi(u), u(0) = u0 \u2208 M, (4.5)\nwhere vi(u) \u2208 TuM, satisfying \u3008vi(u), vj(u)\u3009 = \u03b4ij , are exact eigenvectors of the linear operator H\u0302(u) : TuM \u2192 TuM corresponding to the smallest k eigenvalues \u03bb1(u) \u2264 \u03bb2(u) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbk(u).\nSince u\u0307 \u2208 TuM by (4.5), we have\nd dt Gl(u) = \u3008G\u2032l(u), u\u0307\u3009 = 0, l = 1, 2, . . . ,m.\nThe initial condition u(0) = u0 \u2208 M implies Gl(u(t)) \u2261 0, l = 1, 2, . . . ,m, i.e., u(t) \u2208 M. Thus, the dynamics (4.5) preserves the constraints (2.1). Moreover, we have the following locally exponential convergence result of the dynamics (4.5) around a nondegenerate index-k constrained saddle point.\nTheorem 4.4. Assume that E,Gl \u2208 C3, l = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and the constraints (2.1) are regular. Let u = u(t) be the solution of the dynamics (4.5). Then\nd\ndt \u2016F (u)\u20162 \u2264 \u22122min{\u2212\u03bbk(u), \u03bbk+1(u)}\u2016F (u)\u20162, \u2200t \u2265 0, (4.6)\nwhere \u03bbk+1(u) is the (k+1)-th smallest eigenvalue of H\u0302(u). Further, if there exists a constant c > 0 such that \u03bbk(u) \u2264 \u2212c and \u03bbk+1(u) \u2265 c for all t \u2265 0, then\n\u2016F (u(t))\u2016 \u2264 e\u2212ct\u2016F (u0)\u2016. (4.7)\nProof. Applying Lemma 4.1, and noting that F (u), vi(u) \u2208 TuM, H\u0302(u)vi(u) = \u03bbi(u)vi(u), i = 1, 2, . . . , k, we have\nd dt \u2016F (u)\u20162 = 2 \u2329 F \u2032(u)u\u0307, F (u) \u232a\n= 2 \u2329 H\u0302(u)u\u0307, F (u) \u232a \u2212 2 m \u2211\ni=1\nm \u2211\nj=1\ngij(u) \u2329 G\u2032\u2032j (u)F (u), u\u0307 \u232a\u2329 G\u2032i(u), F (u) \u232a\n= 2\n\u2329\nH\u0302(u)\n( \u2212 F (u) + 2 k \u2211\ni=1\n\u3008F (u), vi(u)\u3009vi(u) ) , F (u) \u232a\n= \u22122 \u2329( H\u0302(u)\u2212 2 k \u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi(u) [ vi(u)\u2297 vi(u) ]\n)\nF (u), F (u)\n\u232a\n.\nClearly, the smallest eigenvalue of the linear operator A(u) : TuM \u2192 TuM, with\nA(u) := H\u0302(u)\u2212 2 k \u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi(u) [ vi(u)\u2297 vi(u) ] ,\nis cu := min{\u2212\u03bbk(u), \u03bbk+1(u)}. Thus, \u3008A(u)\u03d5,\u03d5\u3009 \u2265 cu\u2016\u03d5\u20162 for all \u03d5 \u2208 TuM, and\nd\ndt \u2016F (u)\u20162 = \u22122\u3008A(u)F (u), F (u)\u3009 \u2264 \u22122cu\u2016F (u)\u20162.\nThis is (4.6). Further, when cu \u2265 c for some constant c > 0 and for all t \u2265 0, (4.6) becomes d dt\u2016F (u)\u20162 \u2264 \u22122c\u2016F (u)\u20162. Then the conclusion (4.7) follows from the Gro\u0308nwall\u2019s inequality.\nRemark 4.5. Under all assumptions of Theorem 4.4, if some additional assumptions on compactness (e.g., the constrained Palais\u2013Smale condition [31]) are made, one can establish the existence of a nondegenerate index-k constrained saddle point u\u2217 \u2208 M such that, for any initial data u0 \u2208 M near u\u2217, the solution u = u(t) of the dynamics (4.5) converges to u\u2217 as t \u2192 +\u221e with exponential convergence rate:\n\u2016u(t)\u2212 u\u2217\u2016 \u2264 \u222b \u221e\nt \u2016u\u0307(s)\u2016ds\n=\n\u222b \u221e\nt\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 F (u(s)) \u2212 2 k \u2211\ni=1\n\u3008F (u(s)), vi(u(s))\u3009vi(u(s)) \u2225 \u2225 \u2225\n\u2225\nds\n=\n\u222b \u221e\nt \u2016F (u(s))\u2016ds\n\u2264 e\u2212ct\u2016F (u0)\u2016/c."

            "text": "The CGAD can be applied to solve many scientific problems. In this section, we apply the CGAD (3.11) to find real-valued excited states of single-component BECs.\nWithin the mean-field theory, the GP energy functional of the wave function \u03c6 = \u03c6(x) of a single-component BEC in d (d = 1, 2, 3) dimension is given as [15, 3]\nE(\u03c6) =\n\u222b\nU\n(\n1 2 |\u2207\u03c6|2 + V (x)|\u03c6|2 + \u03b2 2 |\u03c6|4\n)\ndx, (5.1)\nwhere U \u2282 Rd is the spatial domain, V (x) \u2265 0 is the real-valued trapping potential and the parameter \u03b2 \u2208 R characterizes the strength of the interaction. When U is bounded, the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e., \u03c6|\u2202U = 0) can be imposed. In the following, we assume that all wave functions involved below are real-valued functions for simplicity.\nThe stationary state of a BEC is usually defined as the eigenfunction \u03c6 to the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation (or time-independent GPE) [3]\n\u22121 2 \u2206\u03c6+ V (x)\u03c6+ \u03b2|\u03c6|2\u03c6 = \u00b5\u03c6, (5.2)\nunder the normalization constraint\n\u2016\u03c6\u20162 := \u222b\nU |\u03c6(x)|2dx = 1, (5.3)\nwith \u00b5 the corresponding eigenvalue or chemical potential. When \u03c6 is an eigenfunction of (5.2)-(5.3), the corresponding chemical potential is given as\n\u00b5(\u03c6) =\n\u222b\nU\n(\n1 2 |\u2207\u03c6|2 + V (x)|\u03c6|2 + \u03b2|\u03c6|4\n)\ndx = E(\u03c6) + \u03b2\n2\n\u222b\nU |\u03c6|4dx. (5.4)\nThe ground state is a stationary state with the lowest value of GP energy functional E, while stationary states with higher energies are called excited states [3]. Noticing that E\u2032(\u03c6) = \u2212\u2206\u03c6 + 2V (x)\u03c6+ 2\u03b2|\u03c6|2\u03c6 and setting G(\u03c6) = \u2016\u03c6\u20162 \u2212 1, we have G\u2032(\u03c6) = 2\u03c6, and (5.2)-(5.3) turns to be\nE\u2032(\u03c6) = \u00b5G\u2032(\u03c6), G(\u03c6) = 0. (5.5)\nThus, all eigenfunctions of (5.2)-(5.3) are exactly the constrained critical points of the GP energy functional E (5.1) on the unit spherical manifold S = {\u03c6 \u2208 L2(U) : \u03c6|\u2202U = 0, G(\u03c6) = \u2016\u03c6\u20162 \u2212 1 = 0, E(\u03c6) < \u221e}. The ground state is the constrained minimizer of E (5.1) on S. Since constrained saddle points possess higher energy than that of the ground state, they are sure to be excited states. Although there may be excited states that are not constrained saddle points, such as constrained local minima with higher energies than that of the ground state, here we only consider the excited states corresponding to constrained saddle points of the GP energy functional E.\nTaking \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 as the real L2 inner product (or duality pairing), the tangent space of the constraint manifold S at \u03c6 \u2208 S is T\u03c6S = {v \u2208 L2(U) : \u3008G\u2032(\u03c6), v\u3009 = 0} = span{\u03c6}\u22a5. For \u03c6 \u2208 S, the orthogonal projection operator from L2(U) onto T\u03c6S is P\u03c6 = I \u2212 (\u03c6\u2297 \u03c6). Then, the projected gradient of the energy functional E at \u03c6 reads as\nF (\u03c6) := P\u03c6E \u2032(\u03c6) = E\u2032(\u03c6)\u2212 \u00b5(\u03c6)G\u2032(\u03c6) = \u2212\u2206\u03c6+ 2V (x)\u03c6+ 2\u03b2|\u03c6|2\u03c6\u2212 2\u00b5(\u03c6)\u03c6, (5.6)\nwith \u00b5(\u03c6) = 12\u3008E\u2032(\u03c6), \u03c6\u3009 given in (5.4). The effective and projected Hessian operators at \u03c6 \u2208 S are, respectively, given as H(\u03c6) = E\u2032\u2032(\u03c6) \u2212 \u00b5(\u03c6)G\u2032\u2032(\u03c6) and H\u0302(\u03c6) = P\u03c6H(\u03c6)P\u03c6 where E\u2032\u2032(\u03c6) = \u2212\u2206+ 2 ( V (x) + 3\u03b2|\u03c6|2 )\nI and G\u2032\u2032(\u03c6) = 2I with I the identity operator. We remark that any constrained saddle point must be an excited state, thus we call an indexk constrained saddle point \u03c6k an index-k excited state. Now one can distinguish the ground state \u03c6g \u2208 S and different excited states according to their energies, chemical potentials (i.e., eigenvalues), and Morse indices. A very interesting question is whether the index-k excited state \u03c6k is precisely the k-th excited state in the sense that\nE(\u03c6g) < E(\u03c61) < E(\u03c62) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < E(\u03c6k) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (5.7)\nand/or whether it is the k-th eigenstate such that\n\u00b5(\u03c6g) < \u00b5(\u03c61) < \u00b5(\u03c62) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u00b5(\u03c6k) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (5.8)\n5.1. Properties of excited states in linear case\nFor the linear case (i.e., \u03b2 = 0), the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (5.2)-(5.3) reduces to\n\u2212 1 2 \u2206\u03c6+ V (x)\u03c6 = \u00b5\u03c6, G(\u03c6) = \u2016\u03c6\u20162 \u2212 1 = 0, x \u2208 U (5.9)\nwith homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions \u03c6|\u2202U = 0, and the energy (5.1) and the chemical potential (5.4) are identical. As a result, (5.7) and (5.8) are completely equivalent.\nThe following result provides an exact characterization for all excited states in linear case.\nTheorem 5.1. Assume that U is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, 0 \u2264 V (x) \u2208 L\u221e(U), \u03b2 = 0, and \u03c6\u2217 \u2208 S is an eigenfunction of the linear eigenproblem (5.9) with \u00b5\u2217 = \u00b5(\u03c6\u2217) = E(\u03c6\u2217) the corresponding eigenvalue. Let 0 < \u00b50 < \u00b51 \u2264 \u00b52 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 be all the eigenvalues with \u03c60, \u03c61, \u03c62, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 the corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions of the linear eigenproblem (5.9). Then \u03c6\u2217 is an index-k (k = 1, 2, . . .) excited state if and only if \u00b5k\u22121 < \u00b5\u2217 = \u00b5k. Moreover, the unstable tangent subspace of an index-k excited state \u03c6\u2217 is T \u2212(\u03c6\u2217) = span{\u03c60, \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6k\u22121}.\nProof. Denote A := \u221212\u2206+V (x)I. According to the spectral theory of uniformly elliptic operators [23], the set of all eigenfunctions of A forms a complete basis of L2(U). Since A\u03c6\u2217 = \u00b5\u2217\u03c6\u2217, we have H(\u03c6\u2217) = \u2212\u2206+ 2(V (x) \u2212 \u00b5\u2217)I = 2(A \u2212 \u00b5\u2217I), and therefore, H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03c6\u2217 = 2(A\u03c6\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5\u2217\u03c6\u2217) = 0. Then, for any \u03be \u2208 T\u03c6\u2217S, noting that P\u03c6\u2217\u03be = \u03be, we have\nH\u0302(\u03c6\u2217)\u03be = P\u03c6\u2217H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03be = H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03be \u2212 \u3008\u03c6\u2217,H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03be\u3009\u03c6\u2217 = H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03be \u2212 \u3008H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03c6\u2217, \u03be\u3009\u03c6\u2217 = H(\u03c6\u2217)\u03be = 2(A\u2212 \u00b5\u2217I)\u03be,\nThus, H\u0302(\u03c6\u2217) = 2(A\u2212 \u00b5\u2217I) : T\u03c6\u2217S \u2192 T\u03c6\u2217S. Necessity. Suppose that \u03c6\u2217 is an index-k excited state. Then the linear operator H\u0302(\u03c6\u2217) has exactly k negative eigenvalues. Let \u03bb0 \u2264 \u03bb1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbk\u22121 < 0 \u2264 \u03bbk \u2264 \u03bbk+1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 be all eigenvalues of H\u0302(\u03c6\u2217) with {\u03b7j}\u221ej=0 \u2282 T\u03c6\u2217S the corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions. Then L2(U) = span{\u03c6\u2217} \u2295 T\u03c6\u2217S = span{\u03c6\u2217, \u03b7j , j = 0, 1, . . .}. Noting that A\u03c6\u2217 = \u00b5\u2217\u03c6\u2217 and\nA\u03b7j =\n(\n\u00b5\u2217I + 1\n2 H\u0302(\u03c6\u2217)\n)\n\u03b7j =\n(\n\u00b5\u2217 + \u03bbj 2\n)\n\u03b7j , j = 0, 1, . . . ,\none obtains that all eigenvalues of A are\n\u00b5\u2217 + \u03bb0 2 \u2264 \u00b5\u2217 + \u03bb1 2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u00b5\u2217 + \u03bbk\u22121 2 < \u00b5\u2217 \u2264 \u00b5\u2217 + \u03bbk 2 \u2264 \u00b5\u2217 + \u03bbk+1 2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nTherefore, \u00b5k\u22121 = \u00b5\u2217 + \u03bbk\u22121 2 < \u00b5\u2217 = \u00b5k.\nSufficiency. Suppose that \u00b5k\u22121 < \u00b5\u2217 = \u00b5k. Without loss of generality, assume \u03c6\u2217 = \u03c6k. Then T\u03c6\u2217S = span{\u03c6\u2217}\u22a5 = span{\u03c60, \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6k\u22121, \u03c6k+1, . . .}. Note that\nH\u0302(\u03c6\u2217)\u03c6i = 2(A\u2212 \u00b5kI)\u03c6i = 2(\u00b5i \u2212 \u00b5k)\u03c6i, i = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, . . . , k + 1, . . . .\nThe maximum negative definite subspace of the linear operator H\u0302(\u03c6\u2217) : T\u03c6\u2217S \u2192 T\u03c6\u2217S is given as T\u2212 = span{\u03c60, \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6k\u22121}. Thus, the Morse index of \u03c6\u2217 is dim(T\u2212) = k, i.e., \u03c6\u2217 is an index-k excited state.\nRemark 5.2. The result of Theorem 5.1 can be extended to the cases when U = Rd and the potential V (x) satisfies: V (x) is continuous in Rd, V (x) \u2265 0 and lim|x|\u2192\u221e V (x) = \u221e. In addition, Theorem 5.1 can also be proved by applying the generalized Courant-Fischer formula or min-max principle for self-adjoint operators (see, e.g., [32]).\nNoting that, when \u03b2 = 0, E(\u03c6) = \u00b5(\u03c6), we have the following corollaries.\nCorollary 5.3. Under assumptions of Theorem 5.1, if further \u00b50 < \u00b51 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u00b5k, i.e., \u00b50, \u00b51, . . . , \u00b5k\u22121 are single-fold eigenvalues, then \u03c6\u2217 is an index-k excited state if and only if it is the k-th eigenstate defined in (5.8) (equivalently, it is the k-th excited state defined in (5.7)). In particular, since \u00b50 is single-fold, the index-1 excited state is exactly the first excited state and the first eigenstate.\nCorollary 5.4. Under assumptions of Theorem 5.1, all excited states are constrained saddle points, and the ground state \u03c6g (up to the sign) is the only possible constrained local minimizer and thus the constrained global minimizer.\nExample 5.5. Assume \u03b2 = 0. Take V (x) as the box potential:\nVbox,L(x) =\n{\n0, x \u2208 U := [0, L]d, \u221e, x /\u2208 U, x = (x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd)T\nwith L > 0 the width of the box. The eigenpairs of the linear eigenproblem (5.9) are\n\u03c6boxj (x) =\n(\n2\nL\n)d/2 d \u220f\n\u03b1=1\nsin (j\u03b1 + 1)\u03c0x\u03b1\nL , x \u2208 U, \u00b5boxj =\n\u03c02\n2L2\nd \u2211\n\u03b1=1\n(j\u03b1 + 1) 2, (5.10)\nfor all j = (j1, j2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , jd) \u2208 Nd. From Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.3, we have the following conclusions:\nj (0, 0) (1, 0), (0, 1) (1, 1) (2, 0), (0, 2) (2, 1), (1, 2) (3, 0), (0, 3) (2, 2)\n(2L2/\u03c02)\u00b5boxj 2 5 8 10 13 17 18 energy levels 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nindices 0 1 3 4 6 8 10\nExample 5.6. Assume \u03b2 = 0. Take V (x) as the harmonic oscillator potential:\nVho(x) = 1 2 |x|2 = 1 2\nd \u2211\n\u03b1=1\nx2\u03b1, x = (x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd)T \u2208 U = Rd.\nThen the eigenpairs of the linear eigenproblem (5.9) are given as\n\u03c6hoj (x) = d \u220f\n\u03b1=1\nh\u0302j\u03b1(x\u03b1), \u00b5 ho j = |j|+\nd 2 , j = (j1, j2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , jd) \u2208 Nd, (5.11)\nwhere |j| := \u2211d\u03b1=1 j\u03b1, h\u0302j(x) are the Hermite functions:\nh\u0302j(x) = 1\n\u03c01/4 \u221a 2jj! e\u2212x 2/2hj(x), j = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (5.12)\nwith hj(x) = (\u22121)jex 2 dj dxj (e\u2212x 2 ) the Hermite polynomials. Obviously, \u03c6ho0 is the ground state. From Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.3, any function \u03c6 \u2208 S \u2229 span{\u03c6hoj : j \u2208 Nd, |j| = k} is the k-th excited state and an index-id(k) excited state with its unstable tangent subspace T\n\u2212(\u03c6) = span{\u03c6hoj : j \u2208 N d, |j| \u2264 k \u2212 1}, where\nid(k) = #{j \u2208 Nd : |j| \u2264 k \u2212 1} =\n\n \n  k, d = 1, 1 2k(k + 1), d = 2, 1 6k(k + 1)(k + 2), d = 3.\nIt is observed that, id(k) = k if either d = 1 or k = 0, 1; Otherwise, id(k) > k.\n5.2. CGAD for single-component BECs and its time discretization\nWe now propose the formulation of the CGAD for computing excited states of a single-component BEC and its efficient time discretization scheme.\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 S be an approximation of an index-k excited state and {vi}ki=1 \u2282 T\u03c6S be the approximations of corresponding unstable tangent directions. Noting that G\u2032(\u03c6) = 2\u03c6 and G\u2032\u2032(\u03c6) = 2I, by applying the CGAD (3.11) to the single-component BEC model, we obtain\n\n     \n     \n\u03b30\u2202t\u03c6(x, t) = \u2212F (\u03c6) + 2 k \u2211\nj=1\n\u3008F (\u03c6), vj\u3009vj ,\n\u03b3i\u2202tvi(x, t) = \u2212H\u0302(\u03c6)vi + i \u2211\nj=1\n\u03bbijvj + 2\u03bb\u0304i\u03c6, i = 1, 2, . . . , k,\n(5.13)\nwhere \u03b3i > 0 (i = 0, 1, . . . , k) are relaxation parameters, Lagrange multipliers \u03bbij and \u03bb\u0304i are given as\n\u03bbij =\n(\n1 + \u03b3i \u03b3j \u2212 \u03b4ij ) \u2329 H\u0302(\u03c6)vi, vj \u232a , \u03bb\u0304i = \u03b3i 2\u03b30\u2016\u03c6\u20162 \u2329 vi, F (\u03c6)\u2212 2 k \u2211\nj=1\n\u3008F (\u03c6), vj\u3009vj \u232a , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nLemma 3.2 states that (5.13) preserves constraints \u03c6 \u2208 S, vi \u2208 T\u03c6S, \u3008vi, vj\u3009 = \u03b4ij , i.e.,\n\u2016\u03c6\u20162 = 1, \u3008\u03c6, vi\u3009 = 0, \u3008vi, vj\u3009 = \u03b4ij , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i \u2264 k.

(5.18)\nVarious suitable numerical schemes could be used to solve (5.15). For simplicity and efficiency, we use the prediction-correction strategy to discretize (5.15) in time with a (semi-implicit) backwardforward Euler scheme followed by the Gram\u2013Schmidt orthonormalization process to preserve the constraints (5.14) in the discretized level.\nThe initial data (\u03c60, v01 , . . . , v 0 k) is chosen satisfying the constraints (5.14). Set tn = n\u03c4 , n = 0, 1, . . ., with \u03c4 > 0 a selected time step length. Let (\u03c6n, vn1 , . . . , v n k ) be the numerical approximation of the solution of (5.15) at t = tn. We adopt the following iterative scheme to compute (\u03c6n+1, vn+11 , . . . , v n+1 k ) from (\u03c6 n, vn1 , . . . , v n k ):\n\n         \n         \n\u03c6\u0303n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n \u03c4 = 1 2 \u2206\u03c6\u0303n+1 \u2212 V (x)\u03c6n \u2212 \u03b2|\u03c6n|2\u03c6n + \u00b5n\u03c6n + 2\nk \u2211\nj=1\n\u03benj v n j ,\nv\u0303n+1i \u2212 vni \u03c4 = 1 2 \u2206v\u0303n+1i \u2212 V (x)vni \u2212 3\u03b2|\u03c6n|2vni + \u03c3ni \u03c6n +\ni \u2211\nj=1\n\u03bdnijv n j , i = 1, 2, . . . , k,\n[\n\u03c6n+1, vn+11 , . . . , v n+1 k\n] = GSON ( [\n\u03c6\u0303n+1, v\u0303n+11 , . . . , v\u0303 n+1 k\n]\n)\n,\n(5.19)\nwhere \u00b5n = \u00b5(\u03c6n) (5.4), \u03beni = \u03bei(\u03c6 n, vni ) (5.16), \u03bd n ij = \u03bdij(\u03c6 n, vni , v n j ) (5.17), \u03c3 n i = \u03c3i(\u03c6 n, vni ) (5.18), and GSON denotes the standard Gram\u2013Schmidt orthonormalization procedure to preserve that (\u03c6n+1, vn+11 , . . . , v n+1 k ) satisfies the constraints (5.14). We remark that GSON in (5.19) can also be implemented with its variants (e.g., the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm or the Gram-Schmidt with re-orthogonalization) to overcome the numerical instability (of round-off errors) that may occur in some extreme and ill-conditioned cases. We choose the current version of GSON (i.e., the standard Gram\u2013Schmidt procedure) in our numerical experiments for simplicity since it works well for all cases of this paper.\nClearly, the main computational cost of the scheme (5.19) at each time step is to solve a completely decoupled system of k + 1 linear elliptic equations with constant coefficients. All equations in the system take the same form: \u2212 \u03c42\u2206u + u = f , only with different right-hand-side terms f . Thus, they can be solved very efficiently, especially when a fast Poisson solver (e.g., fast Fourier transform) and parallel algorithms are available.\nIn our numerical computation, the iterative scheme (5.19) for computing index-k excited states of a single-component BEC is stopped when the following stopping criteria are satisfied:\n\u2016Fn\u2016\u221e < \u03b5, \u2016\u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n\u2016\u221e\n\u03c4 < \u03b5, \u2016vn+1i \u2212 vni \u2016\u221e \u03c4 < \u03b5, i = 1, 2, . . . , k, (5.20)\nwhere Fn := \u221212\u2206\u03c6n + V (x)\u03c6n + \u03b2|\u03c6n|2\u03c6n \u2212 \u00b5n\u03c6n is the residual of the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation (5.2) at (\u00b5n, \u03c6n), and \u03b5 > 0 is a given tolerance.\nRemark 5.7. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the scheme (5.19), one can introduce a suitable stabilization term [5, 4, 3] with constant coefficient for each equation in (5.19) so that the larger step length can be chosen in practice. Our numerical experiments show that such a stabilized version of (5.19) is efficient. However, due to the limit of page, we leave the rigorous\nstability analysis for the scheme (5.19) to future work. It is worthwhile to mention that, on the stability at large step size for index-1 saddle points of functionals, one existing approach is to use the iterative minimization formulation (IMF) [22] to have a sequence of minimization problems and to design a convex splitting method [25] to minimize the auxiliary functional at each cycle of the IMF.\nRemark 5.8. If one takes k = 0 (i.e., remove all approximations of the unstable directions vi) in (5.15), then the CGAD (5.15) reduces to the continuous normalized gradient flow (CNGF) [5] for computing the ground state of single-component BECs, and the corresponding time discretization scheme (5.19) becomes the backward-forward Euler scheme (followed by a normalization step) for the CNGF (see [33]).\n5.3. Numerical results\nWe now report the numerical results of the excited states of single-component BECs in 1D and 2D computed by the numerical scheme (5.19) of the CGAD. In particular, the asymptotic properties of the energies and chemical potentials of excited states corresponding to different parameters \u03b2 are investigated. Meanwhile, the energies and chemical potentials of the ground state and excited states with different Morse indices are compared.\nIn our experiments, the following three types of potentials are considered [3]:\n(i) the box potential\nVbox(x) =\n{\n0, x \u2208 U = [0, 1]d, \u221e, x /\u2208 U,\nd = 1, 2, (5.21)\n(ii) the harmonic oscillator potential\nVho(x) =\n{\nx2/2, d = 1, (x2 + y2)/2, d = 2, (5.22)\n(iii) the harmonic oscillator plus optical lattice potential\nVhol(x) = Vho(x) +\n{\n\u03ba sin2(\u03c0x/4), d = 1, \u03ba ( sin2(\u03c0x/4) + sin2(\u03c0y/4) ) , d = 2, (5.23)\nwith \u03ba > 0 the depth of the optical lattice.\nWe compute excited states by the numerical scheme (5.19) of CGAD with time step \u03c4 = 0.01. The stopping criterion (5.20) with \u03b5 = 10\u221212 is applied. For numerical comparison, we also use the normalized gradient flow [5, 33] to compute the ground state. All algorithms are implemented on a bounded domain U \u2282 Rd (d = 1, 2) with the spatial sine-pseudospectral discretization (see, e.g., [4]) with mesh size h = 132 .\n5.3.1. Numerical results in 1D\nExample 5.9. In this example, the first few excited states with the box potential V (x) = Vbox(x) (5.21) in 1D and various interaction coefficient \u03b2 are computed. Then, the asymptotic properties of their energies and chemical potentials are studied.\nLet \u03c6\u03b2k be the numerical index-k excited state for specified \u03b2 computed with the initial data: \u03c60(x) = \u03c6boxk (x) = \u221a 2 sin((k + 1)\u03c0x) and v0i (x) = \u03c6 box i\u22121(x) = \u221a 2 sin(i\u03c0x), x \u2208 [0, 1], i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Fig. 3 plots the profiles of \u03c6\u03b2k(x), k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9, with different \u03b2 = 100, 3200, 102400. The energies and chemical potentials of \u03c6\u03b2g and \u03c6 \u03b2 k (k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9) for various \u03b2 are listed in Table 2 (the initial\nguess for the ground state \u03c6\u03b2g is taken as \u03c60(x) = \u03c6box0 (x) = \u221a 2 sin(\u03c0x)). Moreover, the asymptotic behaviors of the energies of excited states in the weakly repulsive interaction regime, i.e., 0 < \u03b2 \u226a 1, and the strongly repulsive interaction regime, i.e., \u03b2 \u226b 1, are shown in Fig. 4.\nFrom the experimental results that are partially shown in Figs. 3-4 and Table 2, we have the\nfollowing numerical observations:\n(i) Fig. 3 shows that the index-k excited state \u03c6\u03b2k is oddly symmetric for k = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (i.e., k is odd) and evenly symmetric for k = 2, 4, 6, 8 (i.e., k is even) with respect to the line x = 1/2. For\nrelatively small \u03b2, the profile of \u03c6\u03b2k(x) is similar to that of \u03c6 0 k(x) = \u03c6 box k (x) =\n\u221a 2 sin((k+1)\u03c0x).\nWhen \u03b2 is large, \u03c6\u03b2k (x) has precisely two boundary layers and k interior layers distributed equidistantly. It looks like a piecewise two-valued function that evenly takes +1 and \u22121.\n(ii) Table 2 shows that, for any \u03b2 \u2265 0, the excited state with higher Morse index possesses higher energy and larger chemical potential, namely,\nE(\u03c6\u03b2g ) < E(\u03c6 \u03b2 1 ) < E(\u03c6 \u03b2 2 ) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u21d0\u21d2 \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2g ) < \u00b5(\u03c6 \u03b2 1 ) < \u00b5(\u03c6 \u03b2 2 ) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nFurthermore, for fixed k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , we observe that\nlim \u03b2\u2192+\u221e\nE(\u03c6\u03b2k ) E(\u03c6\u03b2g ) = 1, lim \u03b2\u2192+\u221e \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2k) \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2g ) = 1 and lim \u03b2\u2192+\u221e \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2k) E(\u03c6\u03b2k ) = 2.\n(iii) From Fig. 4, one observes that for the weakly repulsive interaction regime,\nE(\u03c6\u03b2k ) = (k + 1)2\u03c02\n2 +\n3 4 \u03b2 + o(\u03b2) = E(\u03c6boxk ) + o(\u03b2),\nwhere \u03c6boxk (x) = \u221a 2 sin((k+1)x), while for the strongly repulsive interaction regime, E(\u03c6\u03b2k ) \u2248 \u03b2/2.\nThese observations are consistent with the results in [6, 7].\nExample 5.10. We now compute the first few excited states for the harmonic oscillator potential V (x) = Vho(x) (5.22) in 1D with various interaction coefficient \u03b2 and study the asymptotics of their energies and chemical potentials.\nThe computational domain is taken as U = [\u221216, 16]. Let \u03c6\u03b2k and \u03c6 \u03b2 g be the numerical index-k excited state and ground state, respectively, for specified \u03b2. The initial data for \u03c6\u03b2k and \u03c6 \u03b2 g are, respectively, chosen as \u03c60(x) = \u03c6hok (x), v 0 i (x) = \u03c6 ho i\u22121(x), i = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1, and \u03c60(x) = \u03c6ho0 (x). Fig. 5 plots the profiles of \u03c6\u03b2k (x), k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9, with different \u03b2 = 100, 400, 1600. The energies\nand chemical potentials of \u03c6\u03b2g and \u03c6 \u03b2 k (k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9) for various \u03b2 are listed in Table 2. Fig. 6 shows that the asymptotics of the energies of \u03c6\u03b2k (k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9) in both the weakly and strongly repulsive interaction regime.\nFrom the experimental results that are partially shown in Figs. 5-6 and Table 3, we have the following numerical observations:\n(i) Fig. 5 shows that the index-k excited state \u03c6\u03b2k is precisely an odd function when k is odd and\nan even function when k is even. For relatively small \u03b2, the profile of \u03c6\u03b2k(x) is similar to that of \u03c60k(x) = \u03c6 ho k (x). When \u03b2 is large, \u03c6 \u03b2 k(x) has exactly k interior layers or oscillations distributed densely near the center of domain, i.e., x = 0, thus the multiscale structures are observed.\n(ii) Table 3 shows that, for any \u03b2 \u2265 0, all of the excited states we obtain have higher energies than that of the ground state. Moreover, the higher Morse indices the excited states have, the higher energy levels they possess. This observation is also available for the relationship between the Morse indices and the chemical potentials of excited states. That is\nE(\u03c6\u03b2g ) < E(\u03c6 \u03b2 1 ) < E(\u03c6 \u03b2 2 ) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u21d0\u21d2 \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2g ) < \u00b5(\u03c6 \u03b2 1 ) < \u00b5(\u03c6 \u03b2 2 ) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nMeanwhile, for fixed k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , we observe that\nlim \u03b2\u2192\u221e\nE(\u03c6\u03b2k ) E(\u03c6\u03b2g ) = 1, lim \u03b2\u2192\u221e \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2k ) \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2g ) = 1, lim \u03b2\u2192+\u221e \u00b5(\u03c6\u03b2k) E(\u03c6\u03b2k ) = 5 3 .\n(iii) Fig. 6 shows that, for the weakly repulsive interaction regime,\nE(\u03c6\u03b2k ) = k + 1\n2 + Ck\u03b2 + o(\u03b2) = E(\u03c6\nho k ) + o(\u03b2),\nwith Ck = 1 2\n\u222b\nR |\u03c6hok (x)|4dx, whereas for the strongly interaction regime, E(\u03c6 \u03b2 k ) \u2248 25\u03b22/3.\nThese observations are consistent with the results in [6, 7].\n5.3.2. Numerical results in 2D\nExample 5.11. In this example, we compute excited states in 2D BECs for the following four cases with various \u03b2. Case I. V (x, y) = Vbox(x, y) (5.21), U = [0, 1]\n2; Case II. V (x, y) = Vho(x, y) (5.22), U = [\u221210, 10]2; Case III. V (x, y) = Vhol(x, y) (5.23) with \u03ba = 25, U = [\u221210, 10]2; Case IV. V (x, y) = Vhol(x, y) (5.23) with \u03ba = 50, U = [\u221210, 10]2.\nAs suggested by subsection 5.1, the information of initial guesses is given in Table 4. We compute the ground state (by the normalized gradient flow [5, 33]) and a few excited states for four cases\nwith various \u03b2 = 0, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000. Tables 5-8 list the energies and chemical potentials of these solutions. Fig. 7 plots the pseudo-color images of excited states with \u03b2 = 1000.\nFrom the numerical results shown in Fig. 7, Tables 5-8, and additional experimental results not shown here, we have the following numerical observations:\n(i) From Tables 5-8, we observe that for each case, E(\u03c610) = E(\u03c601), \u00b5(\u03c610) = \u00b5(\u03c601), E(\u03c610+01) = E(\u03c610\u221201), and \u00b5(\u03c610+01) = \u00b5(\u03c610\u221201). From Fig. 7, the profiles of \u03c601 and \u03c610\u221201 can be obtained from that of \u03c610 and \u03c610+01, respectively, by a 90\n\u25e6 rotation. Moreover, some boundary/interior layers and multiscale structures are observed. It is worthwhile to point out that, the shape and symmetry of excited states are independent of the shape of domain if V (x) is a harmonic or optical lattice potential and the computational domain is large enough so that the error of domain truncation can be ignored, whereas they are affected by the shape of domain if V (x) is a box potential.\n(ii) Tables 5-8 show the following facts:\nThese numerical results indicate that the Morse index of the excited state has a certain monotonous dependence on energy and chemical potential (i.e., the higher the index, the larger the energy and chemical potential), but generally there is no strict one-to-one correspondence."

            "text": "In this paper, a constrained gentlest ascent dynamics (CGAD) for finding general constrained saddle points with any specified Morse index was proposed. The linearly stable steady state of the CGAD was proved to be exactly a nondegenerate constrained saddle point with the corresponding index. The locally exponential convergence of an idealized CGAD around a nondegenerate constrained saddle point with the corresponding Morse index was also provided. Moreover, the CGAD was applied to compute some excited states of single-component Bose\u2013Einstein condensates by finding constrained saddle points of the corresponding Gross\u2013Pitaevskii energy functional under the normalization constraint. The properties of excited states were studied both mathematically and numerically. Extensive numerical results were reported to show the effectiveness and robustness of our method and demonstrate some interesting physics. It is worthwhile to point out that the CGAD can be applied to solve many other scientific problems. And, many optimization and preconditioning techniques can be used to further improve the computational efficiency of the CGAD. Some related works are ongoing."

The initial condition y(0) = 0 (3.14) leads to y(t) \u2261 0. That is (3.15c). The proof is completed."
