    "abstractText": "Objective: To present the Brazilian Psychiatric Association's Consensus for the Management of Acute Intoxication. Methods: A group of experts selected by the Brazilian Psychiatric Association searched for articles in the MEDLINE (by PubMed) and Cochrane Database, limited to human studies and acute intoxication. Groups reviewed these materials for appropriateness to the topic and the quality of the work. To perform a table of agreed recommendations at the end of the systematic review, a survey using the Delphi method was conducted. Three survey rounds were conducted to develop a consensus. Results: Support for intoxication may start with Initial Management: Resuscitation/Life Support/Differential Diagnosis. For that, the group proposed these orders of assessment: A (airway), B (breathing), C (circulation), D.1. (disability), D.2. (differential diagnos is), D.3. (decontamination), D.4. (drug antidotes), E (enhanced elimination). Then, the group of experts presented specific interventions for the main drugs of abuse. Trends Psychiatry Psychother Journal Article Pre-Proof (as accepted) Page 5 of 30 Trends Psychiatry Psychother Pre-Proof http://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0571 Conclusions: The approach to intoxication with drugs of abuse is complex and requires systematic protocols. The group of experts suggested the adoption of the classic use in welcoming the patient of the A-B-C-D-E technique with constant investigation of this patient until reaching a specific conduct and with the support to remit the picture. The group of experts believes that this document, at this time, can help psychiatric, general, and emergency doctors deal with psychiatric emergency episodes due to acute intoxication.",

Groups reviewed these materials for appropriateness to the\ntopic and the quality of the work. To perform a table of agreed recommendations at the end of the systematic review, a survey using the Delphi method was conducted. Three\nsurvey rounds were conducted to develop a consensus.\nResults: Support for intoxication may start with Initial Management: Resuscitation/Life\nSupport/Differential Diagnosis. For that, the group proposed these orders of assessment:\nA (airway), B (breathing), C (circulation), D.1. (disability), D.2. (differential diagnos is), D.3. (decontamination), D.4. (drug antidotes), E (enhanced elimination). Then, the group\nof experts presented specific interventions for the main drugs of abuse.\nTrends Psychiatry Psychother - Pre-Proof - http://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0571\nConclusions: The approach to intoxication with drugs of abuse is complex and requires\nsystematic protocols. The group of experts suggested the adoption of the classic use in\nwelcoming the patient of the A-B-C-D-E technique with constant investigation of this patient until reaching a specific conduct and with the support to remit the picture. The\ngroup of experts believes that this document, at this time, can help psychiatric, general, and emergency doctors deal with psychiatric emergency episodes due to acute\nintoxication.\nKeywords: poisoning, emergencies, drug abuse, detoxification, acute intoxication"

            "text": "Acute intoxication is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during, or shortly after, the consumption of a drug that is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior or coordination1,2. These\nalterations are caused by known pharmacological effects of substances in the brain, and their intensity is closely related to the amount consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the drug is cleared from the body1,2. Presenting features may vary for each substance and can evolve into several complications, from physical damage (toxic hepatitis,\nseizures, cardiac arrhythmias) to cardiorespiratory arrest, agitation with aggression, car accidents, and suicidal behavior.1,2\nPoisoning is probably one of the leading causes of admission to emergency departments and intensive care units. The death frequency ranges from 0.05% (USA) to 4% (South Africa).3 Data from WHO report mortality by unintentional poisoning ranges from 0.001 to 5.45 per 100,000 habitants in the world.4 About suicide, suicide attempt, and self-harm, poisoning is the preferred method.5 In England it represents 5%\u201310% of an ED\u2019s workload.6\nIn Brazil, between 2010 and 2014, there were registered 376,506 suspected cases of\npoisoning in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN), although the dimension is not yet fully known. Notification of Exogenous Intoxications became\nmandatory as of 2011, which included exogenous intoxica tion (IE) in the list of compulsory notification diseases7. Another study analyzed compulsory notifications for\nexogenous intoxication in Brazil between 2007 and 2017 conducted at SINAN. Of\nTrends Psychiatry Psychother - Pre-Proof - http://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0571\n833,282 cases of exogenous intoxication, 54.25% were women, and 54.47% were\nbetween 15 and 39 years old. The injuries were recorded mainly in the urban area (86.3%) of the Southeast region (47.65%).8\nIn 2018, an estimated 269 million (range: 166\u2013373 million) people had used a drug at\nleast once in the previous year, equivalent to 5.4 percent (range: 3.3\u20137.5 percent) of the global population aged 15\u201364.2 Assuming no change in the global prevalence of drug\nuse, considering solely the projected increase in the global population would result in the global number of people who use drugs rising by an estimated 11 percent, to 299 million\npeople by 2030. The health consequences of drug use can include a range of negative\noutcomes such as drug use disorders, mental health disorders, HIV infection, hepatitis - related liver cancer and cirrhosis, overdose, and premature death.9\nDespite being a frequent situation in emergencies, it is still a reason for great difficulty on the part of doctors10,11. The literature is extensive, but with little evidence. Lack of\ntraining and stigma related to mental illness are factors that further hinder the care of these patients12. Therefore, documents that standardize the care of such cases can help health\nprofessionals act more effectively and help in the planning of public prevention policies.\nThis work aims to standardize and supply information for doctors, especially\npsychiatrists, to manage patients in acute intoxication from drugs of abuse."

Editorials, narrative reviews, small naturalistic studies, case reports, animal or in vitro studies, and letters to the editor\nwere excluded. However, other manuscripts outside the inclusion criteria were assessed,\nwhen needed, such as association guidelines, government documents and articles outside the search period.\nSearch strategy: Searched for articles in the MEDLINE (by PubMed), Scielo, and Cochrane Database, limited to human studies and acute intoxication. Keywords used were\npoisoning OR emergencies OR drug abuse OR detoxification OR acute intoxication AND\nmanagement.\nSelection process: At first, two members, LB and AGP, searched for abstracts and\nselected the most relevant. Secondly, LB, AGP, CPM, and RAF analyzed full manuscr ipts aiming to select the most important and with the best quality.\nData collection: This process was done by LB, AGP, CPM, and RAF.\nData items: LB, AGP, CPM, and RAF wrote an outline of the manuscript.

The first survey included open-ended questions at the end of each section, inviting participants to add comments and suggestions by email. Later, rounds\nwere conducted online. The survey was sent to the members of the agitation task force for anonymous responses.

Survey items were classified as endorsed, re-rated, or rejected. The method used to conduct this survey is the same one used to develop clinical recommendations by the Assessment and management of agitation in psychiatry: Expert consensus.14\nEndorsed items: Items rated by the panel of experts as \"essential\" or \"important\"\nwere included in the recommendations.\nRe-rated items: Items rated as \"essential\" or \"important'' by 65\u201379% of panel\nexperts, were included in the next survey for re-rating after considering feedback from first-round results. Panel members could decide whether they wanted to support or change\ntheir earlier rating on these relatively controversial items. Items were re-rated only once; if they did not achieve the criterion for endorsement, they were rejected.\nRejected items: Items that were not included by at least 65% of panelists on the\nfirst round were rejected and excluded. The first survey included 102 items. The second\nsurvey included 57 items. The briefer third survey consisted of eight items that needed re-rating.

The manifestations of intoxication are heterogeneous, affecting neurological, cardiac,\ngastrointestinal, pulmonary, and metabolic functions. Among the many alcohol-related problems referred to emergency units, acute intoxication is the most common, mainly in adults and adolescents10,11.\nSigns and symptoms: Ethyl breath, conjunctival hyperemia, altered speech, altered motor\ncoordination, impaired attention, altered ability to discern, altered affect (euphoria, joy, sadness, irritation), behavior change, ability to cooperate, and presence of nystagmus1,28 - 30 can be seen.\nAn alcoholic drink is considered to have 14 grams of alcohol.

On physical examination, it's possible to observe mydriasis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypertension, tremors, or\nconvulsions. Paranoid delusions, associated with anxiety and psychomotor agitation, are also common. Special attention should be paid to clinical symptoms, especially chest\npain, dyspnea, decreased level of consciousness, seizures and hyperthermia, due to the risk of life to the patient11,17,41.\nComplications: The main cardiovascular complications of acute cocaine poisoning are Acute Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac arrhythmias, coronary aortic dissection, aortic\nrupture, and myocarditis. Neurological complications are seizures, hemorrhage, intracranial infarction, altered mental status, and spinal cord infarction10,11,40,41. Other\nTrends Psychiatry Psychother - Pre-Proof - http://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0571\ncommon complications we should keep our attention on are severe hypertension, acute renal failure, hyperthermia, pneumothorax, and deep vein thrombosis10,11,40,41.\nManagement of cocaine and other stimulants intoxication:\nThe treatment for cocaine intoxication must be of vital and symptomatic support\naccording to the patient's symptoms. Antidotes are not yet known. Screening tests for\npsychoactive substances are also poorly available in emergency units in Brazil. In addition to careful physical examination, if possible, a detailed anamnesis is\nrecommended, and it's also important to obtain more information about the condition\nfrom family members, friends, the removal team who brought the patient to the hospital, or the police authority who accompanied the patient. The first action is to diagnose and\ntreat any eventual organic changes that could put the patient's life at risk. Special attention should be given to the cardiovascular and neurological systems due to the specific fatal\nharms.\nIn case of mild cocaine intoxication, in which the patient does not have any alarm\nsigns such as chest pain, severe hypertension, great increase in heart rate, or signs of\nneurological impairment, one should only see the patient's evolution, keeping the same in a safe place, with regular evaluation, and without environmental stimuli. In patients with\nsevere intoxication, the initial priority involves clinical support to the patient, mainly protecting the airways, maintaining oxygenation and ventilation, in addition to venous access39,41. For cases with moderate psychomotor agitation, collaborative, without an\nalarm signal indicating immediate risk, and without significant changes in vital signs, benzodiazepines such as Diazepam orally in a dose of 5-10mg are recommended, which\ncan be repeated according to the patient's evolution. In patients with intense psychomotor agitation and/or aggressiveness, the recommendation is to use benzodiazep ine\nintravenously (diazepam) or intramuscularly (midazolam). The most available in Brazil\nis Diazepam 0.2-0.3mg/kg/dose, by slow infusion, without dilution. In case of lack of intravenous access, the choice is Midazolam 0.2-0.7mg/kg administered intramuscula r ly.\nIn some cases of severe agitation, to protect the patient, a shortest time mechanica l restraint may be necessary39,41.\nHaloperidol can also be used in cases of intense psychomotor agitation and\nparanoid delusions; however, special attention should be paid to its cardiovascular effects, the decrease in the seizure threshold, in addition to a possible increase in heart\nTrends Psychiatry Psychother - Pre-Proof - http://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0571\ntemperature. This medication should be avoided in people who have seizures,\nhyperthermia, severe hypertension, or cardiac arrhythmias, in these cases, the use of benzodiazepines should be prioritized11,17,34. Phenothiazine antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine should be avoided due to the significant reduction in the seizure threshold\nand the potential to trigger cardiac arrhythmias. The use of beta-blockers should be avoided in patients who have used cocaine in the past 24 hours, due to its potential to trigger a reduction in blood flow and increase severe coronary events10,11,35.\nThe challenge for the physician in the ED is to find patients at risk who would\nreceive help from a specific intervention. All patients with acute coronary syndrome,\nespecially young men, without other risk factors than smoking, should be asked about cocaine usage39. First-line treatment of a patient with cocaine-related chest pain\ncompatible with myocardial ischemia and ST-segment elevation consists of administration of oxygen, and sublingual nitroglycerin or verapamil. If there is no\nresponse, immediate coronary angiography should be performed. Both nitroglycerin and\nverapamil have been shown to reverse cocaine-induced hypertension, coronary arterial vasoconstriction, and tachycardia39. Beta-blockers (especially non-selective \u03b2-blockers)\nare relatively contraindicated in cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome. Betareceptor blockade causes unopposed \u03b1-receptor stimulation which may lead to\naggravation of coronary arterial vasoconstriction and systemic hypertension. Some authors recommend labetalol, a joint \u03b1- and \u03b2-blocker. However, labetalol is a nonselective \u03b2-blocker with only modest \u03b1-blocking properties39. Thrombolysis should only\nbe given when a thrombus has been shown on angiography or if pharmacologica l treatment has failed and angiography is not possible. Administration of naloxone and flumazenil should be avoided since they may lead to severe complications39.\nIn severe and resistant cases, there may be a need for patient intubation for better\nclinical stabilization, and protection of the airway, in which case benzodiazepines or propofol should be prioritized. The use of succinylcholine in intubation is contraindicated\nin these cases."

The ECS consists of two\nmain cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2 receptors), endogenous cannabinoids (termed endocannabinoids, with two of the most well-studied being anandamide [AEA] and 2-\nAG [2-arachidonoylglycerol]) that act as natural ligands at the cannabinoid receptors, and enzymes that participate in their synthesis, uptake, or metabolism (e.g., FAAH [fatty acid amide hydrolase] and MAGL [monoacylglycerollipase]).46,47 CB1 receptors are,\npredominantly, widely distributed in the central nervous system but also are found across peripheral neurons in the cardiovascular, reproductive, and gastrointestinal systems.46-48\nWithin the central nervous system, their relative densities vary across brain regions. Early autoradiography studies in rodents and humans showed a high concentration of CB1 receptors in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.48 46 They are also densely\nexpressed across the cortex, particularly in the frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices). 46 Meanwhile, CB2 receptors are predominantly found in immune cells across the body. 46,47 While cannabinoids (both endogenous and exogenous) have distinct chemica l structures, they all interact with different affinities with the ECS. The widespread\ndistribution of cannabinoid receptors reflects their diverse function within the brain and\nbody. The endocannabinoids themselves are important signaling molecules that take part in a variety of functions including motor behavior, appetite, emotion, cognition, memory, sensory, autonomic, and immune function. 46-48 Despite some contentious discussions about the addictiveness of cannabis, the evidence shows that long-term use can lead to\naddiction.

We believe that this document at this\ntime can help psychiatric, general, and emergency doctors deal with psychiatr ic emergency episodes due to acute poisoning, and it also presents some main doubts that\ncould be a picture of new research soon."
