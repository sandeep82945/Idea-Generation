    "abstractText": "Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) is a novel therapeutic platform for targeted cancer therapy. Previously, we have demonstrated that miR-146b-5p plays an important role in colorectal cancer progression. However, a safe and effective strategy for delivery of an ASO to its targeted RNA remains as a major hurdle in translational advances. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal cell (hUC-MSC)\u2013derived exosomes were used as vehicles to deliver an anti-miR-146b-5p ASO (PMO-146b). PMO-146b was assembled onto the surface of exosomes (e) through covalent conjugation to an anchor peptide CP05 (P) that recognized an exosomal surface marker, CD63, forming a complex named ePPMO-146b. After ePPMO-146b treatment, cell proliferation, uptake ability, and migration assays were performed, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression was evaluated in vitro. A mouse xenograft model was used to determine the antitumor effect and distribution of ePPMO-146b in vivo. ePPMO-146b was taken up by SW620 cells and effectively inhibited cell proliferation and migration. The conjugate also exerted antitumor efficacy in a xenograft mouse model of colon cancer by systematic administration, where PPMO-146b was enriched in tumor tissue. Our study highlights the potential of hUC-MSC-derived exosomes anchored with PPMO-146b as a novel safe and effective approach for PMO backboned ASO delivery.",

Nanosized vesicles have the capacity to carry a wide variety of cargoes such as nanodrugs, functional proteins, and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), like miRNAs, anti-miRNAs, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [4]. Due to their low immunogenicity, low toxicity, good biocompatibility, ability to be biodistributed to specific cells and tissue, and ability to transfer their contents into recipient cells via endocytosis, exosomes are leveraged on these characteristics to be ideal delivery strategies of therapeutic molecules as cell-free therapeutics [5, 6].\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are easily accessible and can be derived from different sources such as bone marrow, placenta, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord; therefore, MSCs are believed to be the most prolific producers of exosomes [7, 8]. MSC-derived exosomes as vehicles that can carry therapeutic molecules such as miRNA and siRNA have been widely explored. Lou et\u00a0al. observed that miR-199a-modified exosomes from adipose tissue-derived MSCs effectively sensitized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to chemotherapies by targeting the mTOR pathway [9]. Another group reported that siGRP78-modified bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC)-derived exosomes could reverse the drug resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib [10]. The first engineered MSC-derived exosomal therapy that carried KRAS G12D siRNA has entered clinical trials to treat pancreatic cancer (NCT03608631) [11]. In addition, this engineered exosomal platform that carried STAT3 siRNA or an ASO showed potential to ameliorate liver fibrosis [12]. Despite the therapeutic value of modified MSC-derived exosomes, their translation to clinical practice is still hindered by the search for a feasible approach that enhances the in\u00a0vivo delivery efficacy and supports convenient and sustainable production.\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide [13, 14]. Even after chemotherapy, the prognosis of metastatic CRC is still poor, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 20% because of the toxicity and poor tolerance of patients to chemotherapy [14]. Hundreds of studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in CRC cell invasion and metastasis by facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [15\u201317]. Epithelialmesenchymal transition is essential for promoting tumor invasion and metastasis in CRC [18]. We previously reported that miR-146b-5p (miR-146b) significantly promoted epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition phenotypes through Smad4 in CRC cells [19]. An in\u00a0vivo study has demonstrated that miR-146b may play a tumor-promoting role in establishment of CRC [20, 21]. To therapeutically modulate miR146b expression, we employed a synthetic anti-miR-146b ASO (PMO-146b) that is complementary to the mature miR146b. Synthetic anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (PMOs) are believed as a new class of therapeutic agents specifically\ninhibiting individual miRNAs. However, the major challenge in applying PMO for clinical use is its insufficient cellular uptake [22, 23].\nHerein, we evaluated whether the hUC-MSC-derived exosome carrying PMO-146b could inhibit CRC progression. PMO-146b is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) [1, 24]. Quality-controllable exosomes that were sustainably generated by hUC-MSCs were verified by performing nanoflow cytometry (nanoFCM). We then loaded the PMO-146b conjugated to the CP05 peptide (CRHSQMTVTSRL) on the surface of exosome. CP05 peptide has been shown to bind to tetraspanin CD63 enriched on the exosomal membrane [25\u201327]. Systemic administration of exosomes loaded the CP05 and PMO-146b conjugate (ePPMO-146b) was evaluated for safety and efficacy both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and demonstrated a therapeutic effect in a CRC mouse model. The present study indicates that MSC-derived exosome anchored with an ASO may serve as a promising strategy for CRC therapy."

MSCs are known to express cell surface markers like cluster of differentiation CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105, but to lack CD14, CD34, CD45, or human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) [32]. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that our isolated hUC-MSCs were positive for CD73, CD90, CD105, and the stemness marker CD146, but negative for CD34, CD45, or HLA-DR indicating that the cultured cells exhibited MSClike features (Fig.\u00a01C).\nTo prepare exosomes, 500-mL MSC conditioned medium was centrifuged, and 1010\u20131011of exosomes were purified.

To deliver antimiR-146b into cells effectively and safely, exosomes were turned into viable nanocarriers for transferring the PPMO146b conjugate. As illustrated by our Graphical Abstract, the PMO or CP05 peptide-PMO (PPMO) conjugates anchored onto the exosome surface. To determine the optimal ratio of exosomes and PPMO (PPMO-146b conjugates), conventional flow cytometry was used. We successfully stained nanosized exosomal drug delivery vehicles that were loaded with PMO (PMO-146b cargo) or PPMO and measured the MFI and SI of the oligonucleotides carried by exosomes. The optimal ratio of the exosomes/PMO was determined by titrations as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. Increasing moles of biotinylated PMO or PPMO were co-incubated with 1.32 \u00d7 1010 beads/exosomes complexed with streptavidin-PE. The fluorescence intensity is a result of (1) the positive level of PMO-biotin and (2) its density on exosomes. This result is best described by the ratio of MFI of stained PPMO to MFI of stained PMO, the significance of which is determined by the SI. MFI of exosomes treated with 10 nmol PPMO was 2.3-fold higher than that of PMO. Meanwhile, 10 nmol PMO/PPMO showed the highest SI value 0.9, reflecting a significant separation between PPMO and PMO peaks (Fig.\u00a02A). The optimal ratio was also demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy (Fig.\u00a02B, C). These results indicated the potential of CP05 peptide-conjugated exosomes to be appropriate delivery vehicles for various types of therapeutic oligonucleotide agents including but not limited to PMO-146b.\nePPMO\u2011146b inhibited the\u00a0proliferation of\u00a0CRC cells\nTo investigate whether host cells could take up exosomes and whether CP05 affects the cellular internalization of exosomes, SW620 cells were incubated with PKH67-labeled (green fluorescence) native exosomes or biotinylated PMO146b-loaded PKH67-labeled exosomes. After 12 h of cytoplasmic green staining, it was observed that a great number of exosomes were taken up by the SW620 cells (Fig.\u00a03A, upper line). Compared with native exosomes, ePMO-146b and ePPMO-146b achieved significantly higher cellular uptakes of PMO in SW620 cells, suggesting that MSCderived exosomes were able to efficiently deliver PMO to recipient cells (Fig.\u00a03A, middle line and bottom line). In the SW620 cells treated with ePPMO-146b (Fig.\u00a03A, bottom line; Fig.\u00a03B), significantly stronger streptavidin-PE signals (red fluorescence) were dispersed with a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm compared with those of the ePMO-146b group (Fig.\u00a03A, middle line), indicating that using CP05 to\nanchor cargo to exosomes could facilitate the cellular internalization of oligonucleotides.\nTo determine whether exosomes that are loaded with CP05-modified PMO-based anti-miR-146b oligonucleotides exert their inhibitory function in CRC, appropriate cell lines were screened, and the cellular viabilities of these lines were assessed. Zhu et\u00a0al. and Shi et\u00a0al. reported that an aberrant upregulation of miR-146b-5p was observed in CRC tissue of 49 patients; high miR-146b-5p expression was associated with advanced stage of CRC [20, 21]. Our qRT-PCR also verified that a higher expression level of miR146b occurred in the six CRC cell lines than in the colonic epithelial NCM460 cells (Fig.\u00a03C). The results showed that the two highest groups were SW620 and Caco2 cells, with fold changes of 3.36 \u00b1 1.12 and 5.13 \u00b1 0.71, respectively. As a result, SW620 and Caco2 cells were selected to investigate the therapeutic effect of ePPMO-146b. Native exosomes that are derived from MSCs may promote the proliferation of parental cells [33, 34]. Therefore, a dose-titration study of MSC-derived exosomes was performed using a CCK8 assay. Among the six CRC lines, Lovo cells had the strongest protumorigenic properties in xenograft nude mice in our laboratory; thus, the viability of Lovo cells was also examined. We then optimized the dose of native exosomes in\u00a0vitro under various conditions and 5-FU (3 mM) was used as a positive control. MSC-derived exosomes at a concentration of ~ 1011 particles/mL accelerated cellular proliferation at 48 h, while up to ~ 1010 particles/mL MSC-derived exosomes did not have this effect (Fig.\u00a03D).\nWe then investigated the role of ePPMO-146b in the proliferation of SW620, Caco2, and Lovo cells (Fig.\u00a03E). Cellular viability was significantly decreased following a treatment with various concentrations of ePPMO-146b for 48 h in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a03E). The robust inhibitory effect of ePPMO-146b was in a concentration of 2.6 \u00d7 1010 particles/mL (viability rate, 61.28% for SW620, 71.00% for Caco2 and 57.69% for Lovo) (Fig.\u00a03E). On the other hand, ePNC had no significant effect on cellular proliferation, which was probably due to the minimal cytotoxicity of this exosomal delivery system. According to the calculations and the results above, the optimal exosome concentration for the in\u00a0vitro study was 2.6 \u00d7 1010 particles/mL.\nePPMO\u2011146b inhibits CRC cell migration by\u00a0hampering epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition\nA decrease in the migratory and invasive abilities of the CRC cells treated with AMO (anti-miRNA oligonucleotides)miR-146b was observed in previous study [19\u201321], but whether ePPMO-146b exerted equal or even stronger effects remained unclear. Hence, wound healing and transwell assays were performed. As depicted in Fig.\u00a04A, B, and E, ePPMO-146b at an exosome concentration of 2.6 \u00d7 1010\n1 3\nparticles/mL reduced the migration of SW620 and Caco2 cells by 90.05% and 85.27%, respectively.

Likewise, transwell assays revealed\nthat ePPMO-146b-treated CRC cells resulted in a significant decrease in migration of 44.01% for SW620 cells and 62.37% for Caco2 cells (Fig.\u00a04C, D, and F), and the inhibitory potencies were gradually alleviated when intensity of ePPMO-146b treatment decreased (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01C, G, and H; P < 0.05).\nWe previously reported that miR-146b can stimulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition promoting CRC cell\nFig. 2 Establishment of the exosome/PMO-146b (PMO and PPMO) ratio via detection with streptavidin-PE.

Therefore, whether ePPMO-146b could influence the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process of SW620 and Caco2 cells is a relevant question in the current work.

These results suggested that ePPMO-146b impeded epithelial-mesenchymal transition by increasing E-cadherin and decreasing N-cadherin and vimentin.\nPrevious studies including ours demonstrated that expression of Smad4 is directly modulated by miR-146b [35]; we therefore hypothesized that ePPMO-146b might increase Smad4 via the miR-146b-Smad4 cascade. To test\nFig. 3 ePPMO-146b could be internalized by recipient cells and inhibited CRC cell viability. A MSC-derived exosomes labeled with PKH67 were co-incubated with biotin-labeled PMO-146b with or without CP05 and were subsequently added to SW620 cells, followed by incubation with streptavidin-PE and visualization under fluorescence microscopy. Note the intracellular localization of the labeled exosomes. The control involved the uptake of exosomes by SW620 cells in the absence of PMO-146b. Scale bar, 100 \u00b5m.

            "text": "Considering that ePPMO-146b resulted in tumor suppression in\u00a0vitro and was efficiently taken up by CRC cells, ePPMO-146b or ePNC at a dosage of 5.0 \u00d7 1010 particles/ kg were intraperitoneally administrated into Lovo tumorbearing mice twice a week for 24\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a05A). Compared with the ePNC group, ePPMO-146b significantly impeded tumor growth (tumor weight inhibitory rate % = 64.71% and tumor volume inhibitory rate % = 71.12%; Fig.\u00a05B\u2013E). The antitumor activities of ePPMO-146b are summarized in Table\u00a02. We then detected the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin expression for epithelial-mesenchymal transition using IHC in the mouse tumor samples. The result revealed that the epithelial marker E-cadherin was found to be upregulated while the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin downregulated by ePPMO-146b treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02A). Of note, this exosome-mediated delivery complex did not exert systemic toxicity to tumor-bearing mice, as evidenced by stable the body weight and no deaths observed after the ePNC or ePPMO-146b treatment (Fig.\u00a05D). In addition, there were no obvious tissue lesions in other visceral tissues upon H&E staining by examining the liver, spleen,\nkidney, lung, and heart of mice, indicating the indistinct toxicity of ePPMO-146b to other organs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02B).\nIt has been demonstrated that the intraperitoneal injection of exosomes resulted in a stronger accumulation of drugs in tumors than that of intravenous injection [11]. Thus, vesicles were labeled with the lipophilic fluorescent tracer DiR. The fluorescence intensity of free-DiR, DiR-exosomes, DiR-ePNC, and DiR-ePPMO-146b was evaluated in nontumor-bearing mice. DiR-ePNC, DiR-ePPMO-146b, and DiR-exosomes were mainly distributed in the liver in\u00a0vivo by i.p. after 3\u00a0h and ex\u00a0vivo at 6 h post-inoculation, which is consistent with a previous study on the biodistribution of exosomes [31] (Fig.\u00a05G\u2013H), indicating that the exosomemediated delivery complex (ePNC and ePPMO-146b) resulted in a stronger accumulation in the liver than that of the unloaded exosome group (Fig.\u00a05H).\nAdditionally, an ideal anticancer drug delivery system following systemic administration should be characterized by tumor accumulation; therefore, the in\u00a0vivo biodistribution of ePPMO-146b was investigated in tumor-bearing mice. Similar to non-tumor-bearing mice, fluorescent signal was still detected in the liver while some were found dramatical accumulation in tumor sites, suggesting a specific retention of exosomes in tumors (Fig.\u00a05I\u2013K). All these data revealed that ePPMO-146b efficiently targeted PMO to the tumor sites while reserving its more robust accumulation in the liver compared to that of unloaded exosome."

            "text": "In the present study, we developed a hUC-MSC-derived exosome-based drug delivery strategy by loading CP05PMO-146b onto the surface of exosomes. ePPMO-146b successfully induced a therapeutic effect on CRC progression by inhibiting epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, which was in accordance with our previous work [19]. Of particular importance, this MSC-derived exosome system did not induce any cellular and systemic toxicity and was able to deliver the payload safely and effectively with excellent ability to target the tumors. The resulting hepatic accumulation also suggested that an inhibitory effect occurred on the liver metastasis of CRC. To our knowledge, ePPMO-146b represents the first potential practice of exosomes in the application of PMO-146b-based anticancer therapy to overcome the translational limitation of oligonucleotides in CRC.\nBecause anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs cause severe side effects, a new drug pipeline needs to minimize the toxicity of a drug while ensuring that it accumulates in target tissue. For example, to date, fluoropyrimidines are still the first-line conventional chemotherapy for metastatic CRC\nFig. 5 In vivo antitumor effect and the biodistribution of ePPMO146b in mice.

However, fluoropyrimidines indiscriminately destroy normal cells and cause toxic side effects, and a gradually developed multidrug resistance introduces clinical challenges to physicians [36]. Due to the lack of specific targets of chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors, are sought out. In the manufacturing scale of biomedicines, the process of developing monoclonal antibodies is unsustainable and has emerged as an industrial bottleneck [37]. In addition, conventional small-molecule pharmaceuticals entail much larger, and often iterative, screening efforts, which are followed by extensive steps of optimizing medicinal chemistry parameters [1]. miRNA-based therapy appears to be a very ingenious and promising approach for gene therapy with CRC. Recently, some miRNA drugs have been approved to enter clinical trials on indications other than solid tumors, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and Alport syndrome [38, 39]. Many data have demonstrated a definitive protumorigenic role of miR-146b in CRC, suggesting that ASO-miR146b is feasible for developing a targeted drug [19\u201321]. To overcome the poor cellular uptake of oligonucleotide drugs, nanotechnology has been developed for miRNA or ASO delivery. miRNA delivery is optimized using either viral or nonviral methods. Viral delivery of synthetic miRNA has been demonstrated to be very efficient; however, immunogenicity remains a bottleneck for clinical application. In the context of nonviral methods, exosomes, as \u201cnatural\u201d delivery vehicles that are nontoxic and are produced in an autologous manner, are capable of transferring therapeutic molecules (such as nucleic acids and recombinant proteins) into cancer cells. The following strategies have been developed to optimize the \u201ccargo\u201d loading of exosomes: (1) transfect therapeutic miRNAs or miRNA expression vectors into parental cells; then, miRNAs are subsequently enclosed in exosomes endogenously. For example, lenti-miR-128-3p was transfected into normal intestinal FHC cells, and exosomes were isolated and resensitized CRC to oxaliplatin [40]. (2) Exosomes were isolated from donor cells followed by the application of artificial internalization methods (such as electroporation, sonication, and surface functionalization\nwith lipophilicity conjugation) to exogenously introduce therapeutic miRNAs into vesicles. For example, ASOmiRNA-221 was loaded into exosomes from MSCs by electroporation to treat CRC [41]. (3) The external membrane of isolated exosomes was chemically modified. Chemical modification does not involve tedious gene engineering and the low efficiency of internalizing; thus, the technique is deemed as an easily attainable alternative that is highly efficient in loading exosomes with therapeutics. Regarding the in\u00a0vivo digestive circumstance, the ASO synthesized with PMO is an ideal resolution. PMOs are a charge-neutral class of antisense agents that interfere with target transcripts either by binding or by sterically blocking the assembly of translation machinery, resulting in enhanced oligonucleotide drug delivery [42]. Although PMOs are a new generation of antisense oligomers with a relatively high specificity and efficacy, the transportation of PMOs into cells can only be implemented via physical methods with low bioavailability rather than with transfection reagent s[24]. Importantly, Gao et\u00a0al. reported that the CP05 peptide (CRHSQMTVTSRL) enabled PMOs to conjugate exosomes by anchoring to CD63. In this study, we addressed the most relevant challenges in applying exosomes as vehicles to load PMO-146b for directed colon cancer therapy (Figs.\u00a04 and 5), and the process from cellular uptake (Fig.\u00a03A, B) to biodistribution and safe systemic delivery was included (Fig.\u00a05). Despite the remarkable advances and successes of exosomes in the field of drug delivery, there are increasing concerns about cellular production and reliable sources of EVs [8]. MSCs are the only human cell type amenable to scalable production of exosomes and have been exploited to clinical grade [11]. Since it is vital to perform repeatable measurement of EV concentration for further application in drug delivery, critical quality attributes (CQAs), such as particle size distribution (PSD), particle concentration (quantification of particle number per unit of volume), and phenotype, are indispensable [43]. Different techniques have been applied to measure physical EV properties, and these techniques include multiangle dynamic light scattering (MADLS), asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled with multiangle light\n1 3\nscattering (AF4-MALS), centrifugal liquid sedimentation (CLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), and high-sensitivity nanoflow cytometry (nanoFCM) [43]. NTA is the most frequently used approach, but Vogel et\u00a0al. reported that NTA had to be averaged over three independent runs with CVs (CV = standard deviation/mean, 19%), while nanoFCM was performed just once [44]. Additionally, nanoFCM reached a nominal resolution below 100 nm through a combined implementation of fluorescence triggering, narrow laser beam, sensitive detectors, and instrument configuration [44]. Accordingly, in this study, nanoFCM was applied to verify the order of magnitude of exosomes (Fig.\u00a01B).\nExosomal cargoes have been found to correlate with the physiological state of donor cells. Isolated tonsil-derived MSC-secreted EVs possessed a tumor suppressive effect on the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 [45]. Due to their multipotency, MSC-derived exosomes could also be tumorigenic [46]. Bone marrow MSC\u2013derived exosomes favored tumor growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo [47]. Compared to other MSC origins, hUC-MSCs are preferred for cellfree therapies because they have the lowest tumorigenic ability, do not have ethical concerns, and utilize a noninvasive isolation procedure; in addition, hUC-MSCs exhibit a lower immunogenicity, faster self-renewal ability, more stable doubling time, and higher proliferation potency [48]. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of whether hUC-MSCderived exosomes promote CRC development. Therefore, the appropriate concentration of hUC-MSC exosomes was ascertained in this study by CCK8 assays (Fig.\u00a03E). hUCMSCs are well suited for the mass production of exosomes at 1010 particles/mL, which is ideal for drug delivery in\u00a0vitro.\nWe confirmed the tumorigenic role of miR-146b in CRC, whereas the antitumor effect of hUC-MSC-derived exosome-based delivery of PMO-146b is still unknown. Based on this issue, the CP05 peptide acted as a bridge to link PMOs and exosomes to facilitate the systemic delivery of PMO-146b. Unfortunately, we could not directly quantify the delivery efficiencies of PMO-146b loading exosomes before or after the drug delivery complex incorporating into colorectal cells by qRT-PCR because of the charge-neutral phosphoramidate linkages and blocked 3\u2032-end of PMO [24, 49, 50]. The disclosure of PMO\u2019s dissociation rate or release time profile deserves further study and is currently under investigation in our laboratory. On the other hand, due to the application of unmodified PMO which is greatly limited by inefficient in vivo delivery unless a relatively high dose was administrated, the naked PMO-146b alone is not expected as a qualified control [51]. In this study, the PKH67-labeled MSC exosomes that were co-incubated with biotin-conjugated PMO146b and detection by streptavidin-conjugated PE via flow cytometry indirectly verified that the MSC exosomes\nwere efficiently loaded with PMO (Fig.\u00a02) and delivered into SW620 cells (Fig.\u00a03A). When cellular ePPMO-146b reached the definite concentration, CRC cell viability was obviously inhibited (Fig.\u00a03E), and consistent with antimiR-146b, ePPMO-146b resulted in an inhibitory effect on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotypes of CRC cells (Fig.\u00a04). Simultaneously, ePPMO-146b inhibited the growth of transplanted tumors to a certain extent compared to ePNC (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013F). Determined in tumor tissues, expression profiles of E-cadherin and vimentin agreed with the in\u00a0vitro experimental findings, indicating that ePPMO146b possibly inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition in\u00a0vivo (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02A).\nThe major advantages of the exosome delivery system include its minimal toxicity and the resulting hepatic accumulation in\u00a0vivo. Regarding the exosome, previous studies revealed that no significant histological tissue damage or cytotoxicity to organs was observed in exosome-treated animals [52]. As CP05 peptide targets CD63 and CD63 well expressed in different cells, this may lead the CP05 binding with the membrane aimlessly, resulting in a weak selectivity of CP05 for cells. Actually, this concern is a reason for us choosing exosome to in\u00a0vitro prepare CP05-ASO-exosome complex. We can load the exosomes with CP05-ASOs by virtue of the CD63 specific binding nature, make sure all of the CP05-ASOs have been bound to exosomes and no redundant CP05-ASOs exist in the system before treating the animals, and circumvent the universal binding of CP05 to somatic cells. Importantly, many studies have in depth investigated the in\u00a0vivo safety of CP05 and PMO molecule. For example, Gao et\u00a0al. reported that treatment of CP05PMO-exosome complexes (EXOPMO) elicited undetectable toxicity to mdx mice, evidenced by no changes in blood alkaline phosphatase, urea nitrogen, and creatinine and no evidence of liver or renal toxicity. Systematic administration of CP05-PMO or CP05-engineered exosomes also induced no significant inflammatory response in\u00a0vivo [25]. To date, excellent safety profile of PMOs has been achieved in preclinical studies using nonhuman primates and rodents when long-term and high doses of PMOs were delivered. No drug-related effects were noted on survival, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopic and electrocardiographic evaluations, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weights, and macroscopic evaluations in cynomolgus monkeys or mice [53, 54]. In our study, the anti-miR-146b ASO was also synthesized as PMO. The exosome-mediated delivery complex did not exert systemic toxicity to tumor-bearing mice, as evidenced by the stable body weight and no deaths observed after the ePNC (control) or ePPMO-146b treatment (Fig.\u00a05D). We also verified that ePPMO-146b has no obvious toxicity to normal organs by H&E staining (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02B). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CP05-PMO\n1 3\nconjugates enable safe delivery of therapeutic cargos, like miR-146b via exosomes.\nOur preliminary experiments determined the systemic distribution of exosomes in non-tumor and tumor-bearing mice, revealing exosomes mainly located in the liver and the tumor (Fig.\u00a05H, J). Wiklander et\u00a0al. reported that biodistribution profile of dye-labeled exosomes remained largely unchanged during the first 24 h and significantly declined at 48 h post-administration [31]. However, dyes yielded inaccurate spatiotemporal information regarding the fate of the exosomes in\u00a0vivo because of the long half-life and recyclability, resulting in intact and visible presence in organs over time [55]. Monitoring exosomal signal in organs and biofluids by a membrane reporter, Lai et\u00a0al. revealed that exosomes first underwent a rapid distribution phase with a short half-life of < 30 min in most tissues, following a longer elimination phase within 6 h, which were much faster than using dye-labeled exosomes [55]. Due to the inconsistency and possible delayed tissue accumulation of dyes, we chose to determine exosomal biodistribution at earlier time points (3 h and 6 h post-injection, respectively). Consistent with our results, previous studies reported that following systemic administration, DiR-labeled exosomes localized predominantly in the liver and spleen with the highest fluorescence intensity, but low signal in the lungs and negligible signal in other organs [56], mainly due to the presence of abundant macrophages [57]. Of particular importance, in our study, the exosomal enrichment in the liver was enhanced when exosomes were loaded with PPMO-146b or ePNC compared to unloaded exosomes, indicating that exosome-mediated delivery complex is a precise delivery platform for ASO (Fig.\u00a05G\u2013J) and the therapeutic potential of the complex to inhibit hepatic metastasis of CRC because the liver is the major target organ of metastatic CRC."
