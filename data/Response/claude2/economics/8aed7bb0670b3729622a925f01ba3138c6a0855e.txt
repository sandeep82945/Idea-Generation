 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing early versus late surfactant administration in infants with RDS across multiple countries to validate the cost-effectiveness findings. 

2. Perform a study evaluating long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants treated with early surfactant administration versus late administration to assess if early treatment confers lifelong benefits.

3. Conduct a study comparing less invasive surfactant administration techniques (e.g. LISA) to standard endotracheal intubation for surfactant delivery in preterm infants to further analyze costs and outcomes. 

4. Perform a randomized trial directly comparing the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different surfactant preparations (poractant alfa, beractant, calfactant) in infants with RDS.

5. Develop a global economic model evaluating the budget impact of implementing an early surfactant rescue approach with poractant alfa versus late surfactant treatment or CPAP alone for RDS management.
