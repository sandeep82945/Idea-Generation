    "abstractText": "Background Cylindroma of the breast is a rare benign neoplasm. Since its first description in 2001, 20 cases have been reported in the literature. Methods and results We report another case of this rare tumor in a 60-year-old woman with demonstration of the underlying molecular alteration. Histologically, the tumor showed the typical \u201cjigsaw\u201d pattern of a dual population of cells with a triplenegative phenotype. The pathognomonic mutation of the CYLD gene mutation was detected by whole exome sequencing. Cylindromas show morphological overlap with the solid-basaloid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma, which renders this differential diagnosis difficult. However, distinction of these two lesions is of outmost importance, since cylindromas, in contrast to solid-basaloid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma, behave in an entirely benign fashion. Conclusions Careful evaluation of morphological features such as mitotic figures and cellular atypia is crucial in the diagnostic work-up of triple-negative breast lesions. It is important to keep cylindroma in mind as a pitfall and possible differential diagnosis for the solid-basaloid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Molecular detection of CYLD gene mutation is helpful in cases with ambiguous histology. With this case report, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of mammary cylindroma and facilitate the diagnosis of this rare entity.",

The histogenesis of cylindromas is subject to debate including a possible follicular, apocrine, sebaceous, and eccrine origin [2]. Hair follicle stem cells are thought to give rise to cutaneous cylindroma [3]. Multiple cylindromas may arise in patients with CYLD cutaneous syndrome, including familial cylindromatosis, multiple familial trichoepithelioma and Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, which is characterized by a germline mutation within the tumor suppressor gene CYLD [3]. Several case reports describe cylindromas in unusual locations, including lung, kidney, salivary gland, and breast [4]. * Tatjana Vlajnic Tatjana.Vlajnic@usb.ch 1 Institute of\u00a0Medical Genetics and\u00a0Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Schoenbeinstrasse 40, 4031\u00a0Basel, Switzerland 2 Visceral Surgery and\u00a0Precision Medicine Research Laboratory, Department of\u00a0Biomedicine, University of\u00a0Basel, Basel, Switzerland\n3 Breast Center, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland\n1 3\nCylindroma of the breast was first described by Gokaslan et\u00a0al. in 2001 [5]. To the best of our knowledge, a total of twenty cases of cylindroma of the breast have been reported in the literature so far (Table\u00a01) [4-16]. Only two of these cases occurred in patients with known CYLD cutaneous syndrome. [6, 7].\nHere, we report another case of mammary cylindroma in a 60-year-old patient. For better understanding of this rare tumor entity, we conducted immunohistochemical (IHC), whole exome sequencing (WES), and fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. With this case report and the conducted review of the existing literature, we aim to highlight the importance of clinical findings, microscopic examination and molecular analysis to correctly distinguish between mammary cylindroma and solid-basaloid variant of adenoid-cystic carcinoma of the breast, its main differential diagnosis."

There were neither skin nor nipple changes, and there was no sign of an axillary lymphadenopathy. Her personal history included an invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) with lymph node metastasis 9 years earlier in the contralateral breast, which had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by mastectomy and axillary dissection as well as adjuvant radiotherapy. Two years later, she had undergone reconstructive surgery on the right breast. Otherwise, the personal history was unremarkable, with several benign naevi, seborrheic keratosis, and a histiocytoma of the skin.\nCore needle biopsy specimen\nTo rule out a second malignancy, sonographically guided core needle biopsy (CNB) of the nodule was performed. Histologically, a non-encapsulated tumor composed of cell nests arranged in a distinct \u201cjigsaw\u201d pattern was visible on all four cores (Fig.\u00a01A). The lesion seemed to have an irregular border, with cell nests infiltrating the adjacent adipose tissue, mimicking an infiltrative growth.

Each nest of cells was surrounded by a strongly periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) positive basement membrane. Importantly, no cellular atypia or increased mitoses were identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor showed expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in very few (< 1%) cells while being negative (1+) for Her2/neu. The proliferation index (Ki-67) was around 5\u201310% (Fig.\u00a01C). C-kit (CD117) as well as CK7 were positive in the central epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a01B), while the myoepithelial marker p63 showed diffuse and strong positivity in all tumor cells (Fig.\u00a01D). To exclude the differential diagnosis of solid-basaloid variant of AdCC, a FISH for detection of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene t(6;\u00a09) (q22:p23) was performed and showed no break apart of the MYB gene (Fig.\u00a02). However, a distinct mutation of the tumor suppressor gene CYLD (missense mutation c.2273G > A, p.Arg758Gln) was found by WES (Suppl. 1). In addition, there was loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 16q, with the CYLD locus wild type allele (Fig.\u00a03). In view of all these results, the diagnosis of cylindroma of the breast was made, and the breast biopsy was classified as B3."

In the excision specimen, the cylindroma showed a total size of 8\u00a0mm and the same morphology as in the CNB, with irregular margins and cell nests pushing into the adipose tissue, thereby mimicking an infiltrative growth. The tumor was clearly located within breast tissue, not attached to the skin.\n24 months after surgery, the patient remains free of disease."

            "text": "Adnexal tumors arising within the breast are very rare. In our literature search, we found 20 reported cases of cylindroma of the breast, all described in female patients (Table\u00a01). Two of these cases occurred in the context of familial cylindromatosis, one in context of Lynch syndrome and the remaining 17 patients presented with isolated breast lesions. So far, no recurrences or distant metastases have been reported in the literature, confirming the notion that cylindroma of the breast is a benign lesion. Thus, there seems to be no necessity for wide local excision or axillary lymph node excision. However, a correct diagnosis of the lesion is essential for the choice of adequate therapy.\nHistologically, cylindroma of the breast typically consists of inner epithelial and outer myoepithelial cells arranged in a N\nA no\nt a va\nila bl\ne; b\nN ST\nof n\no sp\nec ia\nl t yp\ne; c\nC as\nes A\na nd\nC w\ner e\nal so\nd es\ncr ib\ned a\ns \u201c lo\nw -g\nra de\nsa liv\nar y\ngl an\nd lik\ne ca\nrc in\nom a\nw ith\np re\ndo m\nin an\nt c yl\nin dr\nom at\nou s d\niff er\nen tia\ntio n\u201d\n[1 2]\nTa bl\ne 1\n(c on\ntin ue\nd)\nRe fe\nre nc\ne n\nA ge\nD ia\nm et\ner (m\nm )\nSy nc\nhr on\nou s c\nar ci\nno m\na C\nYL D\ncu\nta ne\nou s\nsy nd\nro m\ne\nC lin\nic al\nfe at\nur es\nM ol\nec ul\nar a\nna ly\nsi s\nTh er\nap y\nFo llo\nw -u\np\nC ur\nre nt\nc as\ne 1\n60 8\nN o\nN o\nSc re\nen in\ng m\nam m\nog ra - ph yM\nis se\nns e\nm ut\nat io\nn of\nC\nYL D\n: c .2\n27 3G\n> A\n(p\n.A rg\n75 8G\nln )\nab se\nnc e\nof M\nYB -N\nFI B\nfu si\non\nLo ca\nl e xc\nis io\nn N\no re\ncu rr\nen ce\na fte\nr 2 4\nm on\nth s\n1 3\ntightly packed cell islands to form the typical \u201cjigsaw\u201d or \u201cmosaic\u201d pattern. Each island is surrounded by a dense band of hyaline tissue, which is strongly PAS positive. Molecular analysis typically shows a distinct mutation of the CYLD gene [13] (in our case missense mutation p.Arg758Gln).\nThe main histological differential diagnosis of cylindroma of the breast is the solid-basaloid variant of AdCC. This entity shows a more aggressive behavior with local recurrences and the possibility of distant metastases, requiring a more intensive treatment [21]. Differentiation between these two lesions can be challenging, since they are both triplenegative, and consist of a dual population of cells, including\nCK7 and C-kit (CD117) positive central epithelial and p63 positive peripheral myoepithelial cells. Important morphological differences between mammary cylindroma and solidbasaloid variant of AdCC of the breast include marked cellular atypia and mitotic figures in the latter. Moreover, almost all cases of AdCC show the distinct MYB-NFIB gene fusion, which has never been shown in mammary cylindroma, to the best of our knowledge. Peculiarly, recurrent MYB-NFIB gene fusion has been reported in a subset of dermal cylindromas [22]. From the data presented, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of these cylindromas may actually represent AdCC. As histological and immunohistochemical features\n1 3\ncan be overlapping, distinction between these differential diagnoses requires special attention to subtle differences such as mitotic figures and cytological atypia, which was not specifically addressed in this study.\nThe low incidence of mammary cylindroma is possibly because in the past some cylindromas may have been misclassified as other basaloid tumors, such as AdCC, syringoma or other salivary gland type tumors due to overlapping morphological and immunohistochemical features. An interesting theory by Senger et\u00a0al. suggests that a common pluripotent progressor cell might give rise to breast neoplasms with the ability to differentiate into epithelial and myoepithelial cells, such as breast adenomyoepithelioma and breast cylindroma or malignant lesions, including low-grade adeno-squamous carcinoma, squamous carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, AdCC and the solid-basaloid variant of AdCC [23].\nOn the other hand, a distinct somatic or germline mutation in CYLD is typical for cylindroma. CYLD is a tumor\nsuppressor gene located on the 16q12.1 locus [13]. It plays a role in the post-translational modification of proteins, which is important for DNA repair, endocytosis, proteosomal degradation and the regulation of several cellsignalling pathways, such as NF-kB, Wnt, Notch, and TGFB1 signaling pathway [3]. To date, over 100 mutations of this tumor suppressor gene have been reported, most frequently occurring in cylindromas [3]. Somatic CYLD mutation and LOH of the CYLD locus wild type allele was associated with a sporadic mammary cylindroma [13], while a germline mutation typically results in familial cylindromatosis, multiple familial trichoepitheliomas and Brooke-Spiegler syndrome [3]. So far, only one specific CYLD mutation, a somatic CYLD splice site mutation (c.1890 + 2T > C), has been reported by Fusco et\u00a0al. in breast cylindroma [13]. In our case, we found a missense mutation of CYLD p.Arg758Gln, which represents a new CYLD mutation in this tumor. Importantly, a malignant transformation to cylindrocarcinoma has only been described for dermal cylindroma in the context of CYLD cutaneous syndrome, but there have been no reports of malignant transformation in breast cylindroma [3]."

            "text": "In summary, our case shows the typical histological and immunohistochemical features of a rare mammary cylindroma, which was confirmed by molecular analysis. When dealing with triple-negative breast tumors in daily diagnostic practice, it is important to keep cylindroma in mind as a pitfall and a possible differential diagnosis for the solidbasaloid variant of AdCC in order to avoid overtreatment. Careful evaluation of morphological features such as mitotic figures and cellular atypia is crucial in the diagnostic workup of triple-negative breast lesions, and molecular detection of CYLD gene mutation is an important diagnostic adjunct in cases with ambiguous histology.\n1 3\nSupplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11033- 023- 08606-y.\nAuthor contributions MH and WPW provided clinical information and specimens.
