Based on the upshift of the d-band centre and exposure to more Pt active sites, Pt3PdTe0.2 catalysts with significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for the methanol oxidation reaction\n(MOR) were designed in this study. A series of different Pt3PdTex (x = 0.2, 0.35, and 0.4) alloy nanocages with hollow and hierarchical structures were synthesized using cubic Pd nanoparticles as sacrificial templates and PtCl6 2\u2212 and TeO3 2\u2212 metal precursors as oxidative etching agents. The Pd nanocubes were oxidized into an ionic complex, which was further co-reduced with Pt and Te precursors by reducing\nagents to form the hollow Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages with a face-centred cubic lattice. The sizes of the nanocages were around 30\u201340 nm, which were larger than the Pd templates (18 nm) and the\nthicknesses of the walls were 7\u20139 nm. The Pt3PdTe0.2 alloy nanocages exhibited the highest catalytic activities and stabilities toward the MOR after electrochemical activation in sulfuric acid solution. CO-\nstripping tests suggested the enhanced CO-tolerant ability due to the doping of Te. The specific activity of Pt3PdTe0.2 for the MOR reached 2.71 mA cm \u22122 in acidic conditions, which was higher than those of Pd@Pt core\u2013shell and PtPd1.5 alloy nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. A DMFC with Pt3PdTe0.2 as the anodic catalyst output a higher power density by 2.6 times than that of commercial Pt/C, demonstrating\nits practicable application in clean energy conversions. Density functional theory (DFT) confirmed that\nthe alloyed Te atoms altered the electron distributions of Pt3PdTe0.2, which could lower the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining methanol dehydrogenation step and greatly improve the MOR catalytic\nactivity and durability."

Therefore, strategies to improve the catalytic activity and CO* antipoisoning ability of Pt to reduce the usage are urgently needed. Various studies have shown that the MOR catalytic performance of Pt catalysts can be signicantly improved by alloying a second or third foreign metal and non-metal elements (e.g., Au, Pd, Rh, Ni, Co, Cu, Sn, Te, P, N) and through adopting unique structures.11\u201326\nThe use of special defective structures and alloying of oxophilic atoms (Rh, Ir, Pt, Cu, Te, etc.) can dramatically weaken the CO* intermediates from methanol and enhance the OH* adsorptions from water molecules, thus beneting the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

For example, disordered Pt3Sn nanocubes,8 Cu-incorporated PtBi intermetallic nanober bundles,11 defect-rich PtTeCo nanorods,13 ultrathin PtNiRh nanowires,15 and Pt\u2013Ni\u2013P mesoporous nanocages with high surface porosity18 have been synthesized with the typical solvothermal, hydrothermal, and templatesacrice methods. All these nanocomposites showed much higher electrocatalytic activities and stabilities towards the MOR than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts due to the optimized electronic structures of the Pt sites from the strain and ligand effects of the defective and alloying structures.18\nNanocages are considered among the most highly efficient structures and can greatly improve the utilization of the costly noble metal catalysts.18,19,29 Their ultrathin walls, rich surface porosities, and hollow structures endow nanocages with large surface areas, short charge-transport distances, and fast masstransport processes. Up to now, Pt-based nanocage catalysts have been achieved by template-sacrice,18 acidic etchings,19,29,30 and galvanic replacement reactions.31,32 Te nanowires and nanosheets are usually as the templates to obtain Pt- and Pd-based alloy hollow and porous nanostructures or ultrathin nanowires through galvanic replacement reactions.21,33,34 The nal PtTe relevant alloy nanostructures exhibited unique electrocatalytic activities towards the MOR, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (OER). Moreover, it was demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations that Te could help to activate OH\u2212 and promote Pt to more easily oxidize the CO* intermediates to CO2 during the formic acid electrooxidation.35 Thus, developing Te-alloyed Ptbased electrocatalysts with high surface areas and porosity would greatly promote their MOR electrocatalytic activities and durability.\nIn this regard, we developed a new strategy to obtain Pt3PdTex (x = 0.2, 0.35, and 0.4) trimetallic cubic alloy nanocages with porous and hollow structures by the self-diffusion of Pd atoms. As a test, H2PtCl6 and Na2TeO3 were reduced by ascorbic acid in the presence of the as-prepared 18 nm Pd cubes and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at 60 \u00b0C. The Pd cubes were oxidatively etched in this condition and face-centred cubic (fcc) Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages sized around 30\u201340 nm were automatically formed. The thicknesses of the nanocages were in the range of 7\u20139 nm, depending on the components of Te in the alloy nanocages. The reported synthetic method avoids the traditional need for harsh reaction conditions, e.g., high pressure, high temperature, and toxic reagents.10,33,36 Thanks to the alloy, and porous and hollow structures, the obtained Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages showed much higher MOR electrocatalytic activities, durability, and anti-fouling ability than those of Pd@Pt, PtPd1.5, and the commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations demonstrated that the rate-limiting step of the Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages in the MOR process was breaking the C\u2013H bond of methanol to form *CH2OH, for which the reaction free energy was much lower than those for Pt and Pt3Pd.

Both H2PtCl6 and Na2TeO3 etched Pd cubes into PdBr4 2\u2212 complex anions. Meanwhile, all the PtCl6 2\u2212, TeO3 2\u2212, and PdBr4\n2\u2212 complexes were reduced by ascorbic acid, so that Pt3PdTex alloy nanoparticles with hollow structures and porous surfaces were produced. The as-produced compounds all exhibited cubic shapes the same as the Pd templates (Fig. 1a and S2\u2013S4\u2020). The atomic ratios of Pt and Pd and Te elements in the products were calculated from the ICP-OES results (Table S1\u2020). The sizes of the Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages were measured to be 29.2\u00b1 4.7 nm and the thickness of the nanocages was estimated to be 7.3 nm (Fig. 1b). Apparently hollow structures were observed from the TEM analysis (Fig. 1) From the local amplied area, the lattice spacing of the Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages was measured to be 0.209 nm, which was close to those of the (100) facets of the face-centred cubic (fcc) Pt and Pd (Fig. 1c and d). The hollow structures of Pt3PdTe0.2 were also conrmed by EDS and line-scanning elemental analysis (Fig. 1e and f). There were little elemental signals for Pt, Pd, and Te in the middle parts in the EDS images, and the signals in the middle were smaller than those at the edges of Pt3PdTe0.2 in the line-scanning proles.\nThe content of elemental Te in the as-produced compounds was affected by the amount of Na2TeO3 introduced into the growth solution. With the volume of 10 mM Na2TeO3 aliquots added increasing from 20 mL to 40 and 100 mL, the ratio of Te in the as-produced compounds increased. The as-produced compounds were Pt3PdTe0.35 and Pt3PdTe0.4, respectively (Fig. S3 and S4\u2020). The same hollow structures were formed. The sizes of the nanocages were 42.5 \u00b1 8.6 and 28.4 \u00b1 4.5 nm, and the thicknesses were 8.5 and 6.7 nm for Pt3PdTe0.35 and Pt3PdTe0.4, respectively. The alloying of low contents of Te (4.1\u2013 6.4 wt%, Table S1\u2020) did not alter the crystal structures or lattice\nScheme 1 Synthetic process diagram of Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages and Pd@Pt core\u2013shell nanoparticles.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Without TeO3\n2\u2212, the products were cubic core\u2013shell nanoparticles composed of cubic Pd cores and Pt shells (Fig. S5\u2020). The Pd cubes could not be etched in the absence of TeO3\n2\u2212. The lattice spacing of the Pt shell was measured to be 0.226 nm, which could be tted to Pt(111) (Fig. S5d\u2020). Cubic Pd centres were clearly exhibited in the EDS images (Fig. S5e\u2020). Pt shells were formed around Pd, exhibiting strong EDS signals in the outer part. Also, the Pd signals were stronger than those of Pt in the middle part of the nanoparticles in the line-scanning proles, further conrming the core\u2013shell structures (Fig. S5f\u2020). The sizes of the Pd@Pt core\u2013shell nanoparticles were 36.8 \u00b1 6.8 nm, while the thickness of the Pt shells was estimated to be 9.5 nm according to the TEM results. These results indicated that TeO3\n2\u2212 was important to induce the etching process of the Pd cubes and the formations of Pt3PdTex alloy nanoparticles with hollow structures. This may be due to the oxidative properties of Te, which probably vulcanized Pd and Pt somehow, resulting in the etching process of the Pd cubes.\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 2804\u20132812 | 2807\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Typical peaks for the (111), (200), (220), and (311) facets of fcc noble metal nanocrystals were clearly exhibited (Pt pdf #04-0802, Pd JCPDS no. 05-0681).44,45 The incorporation of Te into PtPd alloy crystals induced small negative offsets in the peak positions due to the lower diffraction angles of Te with a trigonal phase (JCPDS no. 85-0554) than those of Pt and Pd.46 This indicated that Pt3PdTex alloyed nanostructures were formed successfully by the self-diffusion of Pd atoms.\nTo analyze the structures and valences of the surface chemical elements of the catalysts, XPS characterizations were conducted (Fig. 3). The main peaks at 73.9 and 70.5 eV could be tted to Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 energy levels, respectively (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, shoulder peaks at 74.9 and 71.6 eV were found for all the Pt3PdTex alloy and Pd@Pt core\u2013shell nanoparticles, which were attributed to Pt(II) 4f5/2 and Pt(II) 4f7/2 valence states, respectively. Such XPS peaks for the Pt(II) valence states were also reportedly observed for PtPdCu particles previously, whichmay be due to the formation of micro PtO and Pt(OH)2.22 Compared with Pd@Pt core\u2013shell nanoparticles, the binding energies of Pt 4f for the three kinds of Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages were all shied positively, for which Pt3PdTe0.2 exhibited the greatest positive change (about 0.25 eV). Additionally, trace charge transfer occurred when Te was incorporated into the PtPd bimetallic alloy nanostructures, thus leading to the enhanced peak area ratios of Pt(II)/Pt(0) and the transitions from Pt(0) to Pt(II).47 Regarding the XPS of the surface Te composites of Pt3PdTex (Fig. 3b), the Te(IV) valence states predominated. Also, the main peaks at 586.3 and 575.9 eV could be tted to Te(IV) 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 energy levels, while the shoulder peaks at 583.6 and 573.1 eV belonged to Te(0) 3d5/2 and 3d5/2, respectively.13 The observation of peaks for Pd(0) 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 clearly indicated Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages, while there were no XPS signals suggesting Pd@Pt core\u2013shell nanoparticles. The XPS results suggested the vulcanizations of Pt and Pd by Te and the presence of tellurides in the noble metal-based alloy nanocrystals.\n3.2 Reconstitutions of Pt3PdTex by electrochemical activation\nBefore the electrocatalytic studies for the MOR, PtxPdTey alloy nanocages, Pd@Pt core\u2013shell, PtPd1.5 alloy (55.4 \u00b1 9.6 nm,\n2808 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 2804\u20132812\nFig. S6\u2020), and commercial Pt/C catalysts were electrochemically activated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution to obtain clean surfaces (Fig. 4a and S7\u2020). The hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks located in 0.05\u20130.35 V vs. RHE for the Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages started to form in the second CV cycle, which became larger with activation and became stable up to the 50th CV cycle (Fig. S7a\u2013c\u2020). Regarding Pd@Pt, PtPd1.5, and Pt/C, there were obvious hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks in the rst CV cycle, which differed from those in PtxPdTey (Fig. S7d\u2013f\u2020). This difference may be due to some Te atoms blocking the active sites of Pt, which were then dissolved in the electrolyte solutions\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "The electrocatalytic performances of Pt3PdTex, Pd@Pt, PtPd1.5, and Pt/C catalysts towards the MOR were investigated in 0.1 M HClO4 medium. Stronger specic activities and mass activities of the three kinds of Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages were observed than those for Pd@Pt, PtPd1.5, and Pt/C (Fig. 4b and c). The catalytic activity and Pt and Pd utilization efficiencies of Pt3PdTe0.2 were the best. The specic activities of Pt3PdTe0.2, Pt3PdTe0.35, Pt3PdTe0.4, Pd@Pt, PtPd1.5, and Pt/C at 0.76 V vs. RHE were 2.71, 2.36, 1.65, 1.11, 0.58, and 0.24 mA cm\u22122 in the backward scan, respectively (Fig. 4d and Table S3\u2020), and the mass activities were 2.14, 1.85, 0.98, 0.91, 0.16 and 0.18 A mgPt+Pd\n\u22121, respectively (Fig. 4d and Table S3\u2020). It can be inferred that the alloying of Te into PtPd and the formation of a hollow structure with a porous surface greatly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity towards the MOR. More importantly, Pt3PdTex alloy nanocages had higher ratios of the backward peak currents to the forward peak currents (Ib/If), indicating the good anti-poisoning ability towards CO intermediates during the MOR (Table S3\u2020). The CO-stripping experiments indicated the better CO-tolerance properties of the Te-doped Pt nanocages (Fig. 5).\nRegarding Pt3PdTex, there were two CO oxidation peaks, and the peaks located around 0.86\u20130.88 V vs. RHE were induced by the presence of Te (Fig. 5a). The relative amounts of adsorbed CO on Pt3PdTex were lower than those of Pd@Pt and Pt/C (eqn (2), Fig. 5b and S8\u2020). Compared to the previous reports, the Pt3PdTe0.2 alloy nanocages showed better specic catalytic activity and mass activity than those of most PtTe-based alloy nanowires/nanotubes and PtPd-based alloy nanowires/ dendrites (Table S4\u2020).10,21,48\u201351 It was demonstrated that both the alloyed Te composites and hollowed structures of Pt3PdTe0.2 developed in this work were important to improve the MOR catalytic activity.\nMoreover, the Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages exhibited the best durability among the Pt, PtPd, and Pt3PdTex related catalysts. Aer 3600 s at 0.76 V, the MOR specic activity was the highest\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nand could be maintained at 23% of the initial activity (Fig. 4e and S9a\u2020). Aer 1000 cycles in 1 M methanol, Pt3PdTe0.2 maintained 14% specic activity and mass activity. These activities were higher than those of Pd@Pt core\u2013shell, PtPd1.5 alloy, and commercial Pt/C catalysts by 1.27, 7.67, and 20.94 times, respectively (Fig. 4f and S9b\u2020). The Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages had stable structures aer the durability tests in acidic medium (Table S2\u2020). The mass percentage of Te in Pt3PdTe0.2 was not decreased, and the hollowed nanocage structures were well maintained (Fig. 6). To demonstrate the practicability of the Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages for producing clean energy, DMFCs were fabricated with Pt3PdTe0.2 as the anodic catalyst. The output voltage for the DMFC with Pt3PdTe0.2 was 0.2 V, which was larger than that of commercial Pt/C by 50 mV. The maximum output power density for Pt3PdTe0.2 were 17.8 mW cm\n\u22122, which were higher than those of Pt/C by 2.6 times (Fig. 7).\nFurthermore, the stabilities of the DMFCs with Pt3PdTe0.2 catalysts were better than those of Pt/C, whereby the output current densities could be maintained at 80 and 40% in 2 h at 0.1 V, respectively."

We constructed a complete reaction network, including the activation energies and all the optimized structures of the intermediates to investigate the preferred pathway for the process from methanol to CO2. Gibbs free energy curves of the preferred reaction paths were drawn according to the calculated data (Fig. 8). The interacting atoms of the \u2013OH*-containing intermediates (CH2OH*, CHOH*, COH*) with sites in the three catalysts were the C atoms, rather than the O atoms for the \u2013O*-containing intermediates (CO*, CH3O*, CH2O*, CHO*), as shown in Fig. 9 and S10\u2013S12.\u2020 It was found that on the sites of Pt, Pt3Pd, and Pt3PdTe0.2, methanol wasmore inclined to break the C\u2013Hbonds producing CH2OH* than the O\u2013H bonds producing CH3O* rst (Fig. 8 and 9).

            "text": "To summarize, a new method for preparing Pt3PdTex hollow nanocages was proposed. Differing from the previous reports, it employed a Pd nanocubes template instead of Te nanowires template, avoiding the need for harsh synthetic conditions. The obtained Pt3PdTe0.2 nanocages displayed much higher electrocatalytic specic and mass activities and stabilities than those of Pt and PtPd reference electrocatalysts towards the MOR in acidic medium aer electrochemical activation. Thanks to the hollow structures and porous surfaces and the alloying effect of oxophilic Te atoms, the Pt3PdTe0.2 alloy nanocages exhibited much better catalytic performance. DFT studies conrmed that the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step of the MOR catalyzed by Pt3PdTe0.2 was lowered and the d-band centre of Pt3PdTe0.2 was shied to EF, leading to the great catalytic activity and durability. Thus, the study is important to improve the Pt utilization in DMFCs and shows the importance of optimizing the shapes and performance of hollow PtPdTe electrocatalysts.\nAuthor contributions\nYuhe Shi undertook the experiments and processed the data.
