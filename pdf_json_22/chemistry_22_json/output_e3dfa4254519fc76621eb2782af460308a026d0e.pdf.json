    "abstractText": "Currently, all researchers are concentrating their efforts on countering the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of patients are managed at home, according to recent statistics. An OTC triple action combination comprising paracetamol (PAR), aspirin (ASP), and diphenhydramine (DIPH) is commonly given for pain relief, fever control, and as a nighttime sleep aid. This combination is currently recommended for COVID-19 patients as part of symptomatic treatment and management. In this work, three smart, simple, accurate, eco-friendly, and cost-effective spectrophotometric methods are developed for simultaneous determination of PAR, ASP, and DIPH in their combined over-the-counter caplet dosage form without any prior separation steps. The first method is the first derivative spectrophotometry (D) which determined PAR at 259.7 nm. The second one is the dual-wavelength in ratio spectra (DWRS) for determination of ASP at 214.1 and 220.1 nm after using 10.0 \u03bcg/mL of PAR as a divisor, where PAR was a constant, and the wavelengths difference equal to zero for DIPH. The third method is the double divisor-ratio difference spectrophotometric one (DD-RD) which was based on using the sum of 15.0 \u03bcg/mL of each of PAR and ASP as a double divisor, and the difference in amplitudes was measured at two wavelengths \u2206P(214.5\u2013226.0) for determination of DIPH. The developed methods have been validated as per ICH guidelines. Furthermore, the three suggested methods were employed successfully to assay marketed pharmaceutical formulation and to investigate the content uniformity of the dosage units in accordance with the United States Pharmacopeia\u2019s guidelines. Finally, the greenness profile of the proposed methods was assessed and compared with the reported method using the analytical eco-scale system, national environmental method index (NEMI), green analytical procedure index (GAPI), and analytical greenness (AGREE) metric. The results from the proposed methods statistically agreed with those obtained by the reported one, with no significant differences in accuracy and precision. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Chemistry (2022) 16:73 Introduction Spectrophotometric technique has perceived a significant progress in developing rapid and effective resolution procedures for spectrally overlapping signals of drug combinations. It provides comparable reliability and accuracy to different hyphenated chromatographic techniques without the requirement for complex computer systems, highly skilled analysts, tedious analytical process, or costly instrument set up. Accordingly, spectrophotometry has drawn the attention as a time saving, cost-effective and eco-friendly potential candidate where minimal energy and harmful solvents are used with decreased waste generation [1, 2]. Regulatory guidance and pharmacopeia provide a series of routine quality control procedures to guarantee that finished pharmaceutical formulations meet the required specifications. One of these procedures is content uniformity testing, which involves selecting different dosage units at random and analyzing each one separately using a relevant analytical method [3]. It represents the active drug\u2019s uniform distribution within a production batch and sheds light on the magnitude of variations between dose units. Moreover, it is also regarded as an important requirement before performing a bioequivalence study to ensure that study subjects get the active component at a dosage that does not deviate from the labelled quantity by more than the defined value [4, 5]. However, employing chromatographic methods for such testing, on regular basis, consumes a lot of resources and time. Hence, when it comes to the launch of new pharmaceutical formulations, a simple, rapid, and reliable analytical method is always preferred, while environmental, health and safety considerations shall always be taken into account. Oral pharmaceutical formulation containing paracetamol (PAR), aspirin (ASP) and diphenyhyramine (DIPH) is commonly available as over-the-counter (OTC) to tackle night-time headache pain. PAR, N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) acetamide, acts as an antipyretic and analgesic agent [6]. ASP, 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic acid, is a non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor; antipyretic; analgesic; and anti-inflammatory. DIPH, 2-(Diphenylmethoxy)-N,Ndimethylethylamine hydrochloride, is a first-generation antihistamine [6]. The relevance of the listed medications arises from recent studies on the possibility of using",

However, employing chromatographic methods for such testing, on regular basis, consumes a lot of resources and time. Hence, when it comes to the launch of new pharmaceutical formulations, a simple, rapid, and reliable analytical method is always preferred, while environmental, health and safety considerations shall always be taken into account.\nOral pharmaceutical formulation containing paracetamol (PAR), aspirin (ASP) and diphenyhyramine (DIPH) is commonly available as over-the-counter (OTC) to tackle night-time headache pain. PAR, N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) acetamide, acts as an antipyretic and analgesic agent [6]. ASP, 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic acid, is a non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor; antipyretic; analgesic; and anti-inflammatory. DIPH, 2-(Diphenylmethoxy)-N,Ndimethylethylamine hydrochloride, is a first-generation antihistamine [6]. The relevance of the listed medications arises from recent studies on the possibility of using\nKeywords: Aspirin, Content uniformity testing, Diphenhydramine, D1 method, DWRS method, DD-RD method, Greenness assessment, Paracetamol, Spectrophotometry\nGraphical Abstract\nthem as an add-on treatment for COVID-19 patients, particularly those who are home-treated and have moderate cases [7\u20139]. The chemical structures of PAR, ASP and DIPH are shown in Fig.\u00a01. According to the literature in hands, only HPLC\u2013DAD and HPTLC-densitometric methods have been recently reported to determine the cited drugs in the pharmaceutical formulation [10]. However, it requires costly instrumentation, expert operators, lengthy analysis time and consume more hazardous solvents.\nAnalysts recently tried to use a competent methodological approach that is more eco-friendly and sustainable in order to protect our environment from chemical hazards [11\u201315]. Accordingly, this research aims to establish simple, reliable, fast, eco-friendly, and low-cost analytical methodology for determination of PAR, ASP, and DIPH in their new co-formulated ternary mixture. This was accomplished through applying smart and simple spectrophotometric methods, for the first time, namely; first derivative spectrophotometric method (D1), dual wavelength in ratio spectra spectrophotometric method (DWRS), and double divisor-ratio difference spectrophotometric method (DD-RD) for resolving the spectrally overlapping mixture. The developed validated methods were exploited for assaying the cited drugs in their commercial combined pharmaceutical formulation as well as assessing their content uniformity. The presented spectrophotometric approach offered simple, cost-effective and reliable platform for routine quality control assessment, without\u00a0preliminary separation, in pharmaceutical industry."

            "text": "For routine drug analysis, spectrophotometry is a wellestablished and commonly used technique in quality control laboratories all over the world. Although spectrophotometry seems fair to develop a reasonable, simple, and selective analytical approach compared to the high running cost of the chromatographic techniques, the interferences and overlapping of spectral data from coformulated pharmaceutical drugs and excipients make direct determination difficult. Consequently, an effective mathematical resolution process is required. Furthermore, spectrophotometry has made major contributions to green analytical chemistry by reducing energy consumption and waste generation.\nAfter scanning the absorption spectra of the cited drugs against methanol in the wavelength range 200.0\u2013 400.0\u00a0nm, DIPH shows undefined spectral band at 200.0\u2013 235.0\u00a0nm, while ASP displays two peaks at 226.0\u00a0nm and 276.0\u00a0nm. On the other hand, PAR is characterized with \u03bbmax at 248.0\u00a0 nm with spectral extension over ASP and DIPH spectra, Fig.\u00a0 2. The low absorptivity and hence sensitivity stood against direct assessment of PAR at its expanded region. Furthermore, considerable spectral overlap was observed in the 200.0\u2013300.0\u00a0 nm region, which could not be resolved by direct spectrophotometry, as shown in Fig.\u00a02. As a result, the major objective was to utilize such spectral characteristics in resolving the overlapped spectral signals of the ternary mixture via developing simple, and smart resolution methods.\nFirst derivative spectrophotometric method (D1) By enhancing the resolution of overlapping bands, first derivative spectrophotometry is a well-established approach for determining components with overlapped spectra in mixtures [17]. The obtained D1 spectra of PAR, ASP, and DIPH revealed that PAR could be determined at 259.7\u00a0 nm, without any interference from ASP or DIPH. As ASP and DIPH showed zero crossing point and zero contribution at this wavelength, respectively, Fig.\u00a03. Calibration curve was constructed and showed a linear relationship between the D1 peak amplitude at 259.7\u00a0nm and PAR corresponding concentrations.\nDual wavelength in\u00a0ratio spectra spectrophotometric method (DWRS) By combining the resolving power of two well-known spectrophotometric methods; namely the ratio difference method and dual wavelength, a simple and selective spectrophotometric approach for determining compounds with overlapped spectra in ternary mixtures was\ndeveloped [18]. The suggested approach can determine compounds in ternary mixtures, where each component may be detected selectively once the other two components\u2019 influence has been removed. By using a divisor of the interfering component, the ratio difference method can be used to determine one of two components in a binary mixture at any two wavelengths throughout their linear range in ratio spectra [19, 20]. Whereas, the dualwavelength method will determine component in the binary mixture, when the two chosen wavelengths have the same absorptivities for the interfering component. The zero-order spectra of the cited drugs were divided by 10.0\u00a0\u00b5g/mL PAR, producing ratio spectra of the three components, Fig.\u00a04. Two wavelengths were chosen 214.1 and 220.1\u00a0 nm, where PAR exhibits a straight line with constant standard spectrum amplitudes, while DIPH shows equal amplitudes. Accordingly, the difference of amplitudes at the specified wavelengths \u0394A(214.1\u2013220.1\u00a0nm) will relate selectively to ASP concentrations."

The only prerequisite in evaluating the concentration of the component of interest using the DD-RD\napproach is the contribution of the three components at the two selected wavelengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, where the amplitudes of the interfering components are the same \u201cconstant\u201d in the ratio spectrum, while the component of interest exhibits a considerable difference in these two amplitude values at the two specified wavelengths in respect to concentration [22]. The DD-RD was the most suitable method for determination of DIPH in presence of PAR and ASP. For determination of DIPH, the absorption spectra were divided by a binary mixture spectrum of PAR and ASP, at concentration 15.0\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, each, generating new ratio spectra. The amplitude at 214.5 and 226.0\u00a0nm were chosen and subtracted, so the \u201cconstant\u201d for both PAR and ASP will be cancelled, Fig.\u00a05."

Small intercept values and the correlation coefficients approaches unity, all indicated acceptable linearity.

Because of the importance of environmental protection, there is a growing need to replace traditional pharmaceutical analytical procedures that rely on the usage of dangerous chemicals with more eco-friendly green ones that do not affect performance [26]. Four approaches were introduced to evaluate and grade the eco-friendliness of the proposed methods. We also supplied a detailed benchmark for comparing their environmental impacts. These approaches include the analytical eco-scale, national environmental methods index (NEMI), green analytical procedure index (GAPI), and analytical greenness (AGREE) metric.\nThe analytical eco-scale approach was used to do a semi-quantitative evaluation by awarding penalty points depending on the influence of various method parameters such as the chemicals used, instrumental energy consumption, generation of waste, and occupational hazards [27]. By subtracting the total parameters penalty points from 100, the ideal green method base value, the analytical eco-score is calculated. The higher the score, the eco-friendlier and more cost-effective the analytical technique. Table\u00a0 5 shows the eco-scores of the proposed methods and the reported HPLC method [10].

Accordingly, this work aimed at developing smart, fast,\nrobust and sustainable spectrophotometric methods to resolve the completely overlapped spectra of an over-thecounter ternary mixture of PAR, ASP and DIPH, for the first time. The distinctive spectral features of the studied mixture boosts the development of three univariate spectrophotometric methods, namely; first derivative spectrophotometry for determination of PAR, dual-wavelength in ratio spectra for determination of ASP using PAR as a divisor and double divisor-ratio difference spectrophotometric one based on using the sum of PAR and ASP as a double divisor for determination of DIPH. The proposed methodologies\u2019 greenness profile was thoroughly examined through the most prevalent and advanced indexes; analytical eco-scale system, NEMI, GAPI, and AGREE and compared with the reported conventional chromatographic one. The suggested methods exhibit pronounced eco-friendly, simplicity, reliability, accuracy, and selectivity for assaying the studied drugs in pure form and their co-formulated pharmaceutical dosage form. They can be regarded as useful and favourable for routine pharmaceutical quality control studies without preliminary separation. Furthermore, they do not require any sophisticated instruments, lengthy sample preparation steps promoting their applicability in content uniformity testing of the commercially available products.
