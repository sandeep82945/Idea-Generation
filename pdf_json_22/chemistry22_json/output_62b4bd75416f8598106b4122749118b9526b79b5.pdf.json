            "text": "The usage of fossil fuels and many non-renewable energy resources are diminishing the\nenvironment due to carbon emissions in the atmosphere. To control the pollution in the atmosphere, alternate energy storage devices like alkali-ion batteries, super capacitors, metal-air batteries, porous materials such as PCPs, COFs, MOFs, etc. have shown excellent performance due to their high power density, energy density, etc.1\u20137 It is important to find out alternative pollution free energy resources. Hydrogen is a desirable renewable energy resource to replace existing fossil fuels since it contains high energy density in its molecular form.8 In general, H2 is generated by using steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal reforming with the help of hydrocarbon-based fuels, but it also produces carbon emissions as a byproduct, which hinders the concept of clean and renewable energy technology.9 So, to avoid the emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO, CO2, etc. there are other sustainable technologies to generate hydrogen via electrolysis, thermolysis, and photoelectrolysis.10,11\nRecently, it has been studied that the electrolysis of water is one of the useful methods to\nproduce H2 with the reasonable production cost, and it is non-pollution process, cost effective,\nhighly efficient and environment friendly.12,13 Modern research has been focused on the development of earth-abundant, cost-effective, and highly efficient electrocatalysts for the effective H2 evolution reaction (HER: 2H + + 2e- = H2). The main key to explore the efficiency of H2O splitting is the electrocatalytic cathode materials which are required in the electrolysis of H2O. There are a few noble metals like palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), etc., shown excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER mechanism.14,15 Till to date, it is considered that the Ptbased cathode materials are the best electrocatalysts for effective HER due to near-zero overpotential. Due to its high cost and scarce resource, it hinders the practical applications in industries which limit their commercial applications. It is a challenging task to find out an excellent cost-effective and earth-abundant electrocatalyst to obtain hydrogen from the electrolysis of water at a faster rate.16,17 Therefore, it is an inspirational mission to develop an alternative Pt-free highly efficient electrocatalyst for effective HER which can be applicable for H2-based energy technology. For the development of such kind of electrocatalyst, four conditions must be considered: stability should be high, cost should be low with good electrical conductivity and large specific surface area and multiple active sites, and remarkable activity without creating defects. In this direction, 2D materials could be the most promising candidates for the electrocatalyst as they have large surface areas, which provides more active sites for the reactions, and they are of low cost and have environmentally friendly nature.18\nVery recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted tremendously in\nmaterials chemistry and they have been considerably explored as a potential electrocatalyst for effective H2 evolution due to its exceptional materials structures, hexagonal symmetry, and unique electronic properties.12 Among all the TMDs, the pure 2D monolayer MoS2 has emerged as an auspicious material for effective H2 evolution in acidic conditions and the electrocatalytic performance of this material is very close to the Pt-based materials.19 It has been computationally reported that the 2D single layer MoS2 TMD can catalyze electrochemical H2 evolution at a moderate overpotential of 0.1-0.2 V due to its approximately thermoneutral H2 adsorption energy.20 Huang et al. computationally explored the H2 evolution reaction pathways, mechanism and reaction barriers for the HER on the surfaces of 2D monolayer MoS2 materials by employing first principles-based Density Functional Theory (DFT) method.21 Recently, Lei et al. synthesized hybrid WxMo1-XS2/rGO (rGO = reduced graphene oxide) heterostructure films by using a simple wet chemical approach.12 They found that these TMD alloy (i.e., WxMo1-XS2) materials are\neffective electrocatalysts for H2 evolution. Among all the TMD alloys, the heterostructure made by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and W0.4Mo0.6S2 alloy material has shown better electrocatalytic efficiency for HER than the pristine 2D monolayer WS2 and MoS2 materials. 12 They carried out a computational investigation by applying M06-L DFT method to analyze their experimental observation by investigating the detailed HER mechanism.\nDue to several constraints of TMDs, their overall electrocatalytic performance is limited\nand the pristine TMDs have inert basal planes and it contains a smaller number of active edge sites which are the main drawbacks for excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER. The key challenge is the phase engineering technique to activate the inert basal planes of the TMDs by introducing more number and electrocatalytic activity of basal plane sites.22 To overcome the limitations of the pristine TMDs for excellent HER, a new technology is required which can potentially enhance the electrochemical performance of H2 evolution reactions by tuning the electrocatalytic properties of the pristine one. Recently, 2D Janus TMDs have invited extensive interest for the further advancement of nanomaterials science, electrolysis of water, fuel cell and renewable energy technology. In this context, Janus TMDs have shown better electrocatalytic performance for HER mechanism with less application of strain and chalcogen anion vacancy in the structure.23 It has been studied that the Janus TMDs layers (MXY, where M = transition metal atoms, W; X/Y= VI A group elements) have shown intensification of inactive sites at basal planes as well as edge in contrast to the pristine ordinary TMD (like MX2) layers which helps to increase the evolution of hydrogen.24,25 Due to the different electronegativity of the X and Y layer of chalcogen atoms in the Janus MXY structure, an inherent dipole moment exists. This property distributes holes and electrons present in its structure resourcefully on its surface for upgrading electrocatalytic activity.26 It should be mentioned here that the 2D Janus TMD material exhibits an inherent outof-plane electric field owing to the mirror asymmetry in the z-axis and thus shows large Rashba band splitting and piezoelectricity. The single-layer structures of the pristine 2D Janus TMDs are a direct electronic band gap semiconductor and they are thermodynamically stable.27,28 A recent computational study reported that the 2D monolayer In2SSe Janus TMD is a pure direct band gap semiconductor and it has hexagonal geometry with P3m1 symmetry such as 2D monolayer MoS2, WS2, InS, MoSe2 and InSe single layers, and they are all energetically and thermodynamically stable materials.28 It was found that the polarized 2D Janus MoSSe have exceptional novel properties such as semiconducting, an out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization, direct band gap and\nrobust Rashba effects which make them more attractive in modern nanomaterials science, engineering, renewable energy technology, high-end electronics and optoelectronic devices.27,29,30 Lately, 2D Janus MoSSe material has been extensively studied providing great promise for their application in sensors, actuators, electrochemistry, photocatalysis, and other electromechanical devices.27\nRecently, Lu et al. experimentally synthesized 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe TMD using\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique from MoS2 monolayers by substituting the top one S atom layers by Se atom layers.25 It was experimentally observed that the Janus TMDs have shown hexagonal lattice structures but they differ in their electronic properties in comparison to symmetrically grown ordinary TMDs with their shattered out of plane structural symmetry.31 This property indicates that the Janus TMDs may be an exceptional catalyst for the evolution of hydrogen. 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe TMD is a hexagonal 2D layer structure with six-fold Mo atoms and three-fold S and Se atoms by breaking the plane of symmetry.32 Later on, Konkena et al. synthesized MoSSe nanosheets with a chemical vapor transport (CVT) technique using Mo, S, and Se precursor powders in precise proportions in a quartz tube at 800oC temperature and normal atmospheric conditions.33 This MoSSe was exfoliated into nanosheets and assembled with graphene oxide to construct a hybrid electrocatalyst for HER mechanism with the Tafel slope (m) about 51.0 mV.dec-1 at 5.0 mA.cm-2 current density.33 Very recently, Pang et. al. theoretically studied that the Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers can provide as a suitable substrate for silicene which might be applicable for nanodevices and optoelectronic devices.34 It was experimentally observed that the electronic band gap (Eg) changes according to the direction of the applied external electric field. Li et al. computationally investigated the optical and electronic properties of the 2D Janus MoSSe material, and they reported that the electronic bandgap of the 2D Janus MoSSe was 1.47 \u2013 2.69 eV computed by the PBE+SOC and G0W0+SOC methods.27 Er et al. theoretically and computationally studied the properties of various 2D Janus TMDs and they found that the 2D Janus TMDs (monolayer) are promising candidates for HER catalysts.24 However, they did not explore the detailed reaction mechanism and H2 evolution pathways by investigating the materials/electronic properties, HER mechanism, activation barriers, pathways, and reaction kinetics with thermodynamics in detailed. We hypothesized that the 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe TMD could be used as an excellent electrocatalyst for HER due to a reasonable design to trigger the \u201cinert\u201d in-plane Se-Mo-S.\nHere, we computationally developed 2D Janus MoSSe monolayer structure material, and\nstudied the electronic band structure, total density of states (DOS), position of the Fermi energy level (EF) and electronic band gap (Eg) with a potential application in electrochemical water splitting reactions via HER. In this work, we employed first principles-based hybrid periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT)35,36 and van der Waals (vdW) corrections (i.e., Grimmes\u2019 -D3 dispersion corrections) to calculate the equilibrium geometries, structures, band structure, electronic band gap (Eg) and total DOS to predict the electronic/material properties of the 2D monolayer Janus TMD MoSSe. We found that the 2D Janus MoSSe single layer is an excellent material for H2 evolution with high catalytic performance. It was found that the exposed S-/Seedge (1\u0305010) and Mo-edge (101\u03050) edges of the 2D monolayer Janus TMD MoSSe are catalytic active for HER, and the (001) basal planes of the S\u2212Mo\u2212Se tri-layer of the MoSSe JTMD are exposed surfaces. It has more active sites for the hydrogen adsorption on the catalytic surface due to the presence of more surface to volume ratio compared to pristine 2D TMDs. To develop the 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe, we took a hexagonal symmetric 2D monolayer MoS2 structure with ABA layered stacking (where A is Sulphur and B is Molybdenum) and replaced the top layer of S in the MoS2 by the Se atoms layer to form 2D MoSSe structure with ABC layered stacking (ASelenium, B-Molybdenum, and C-Sulphur) as shown in Fig. 1. The 2D layer structure was used to explore the electronic properties, and a molecular cluster model system Mo10S12Se9 (noted by [MoSSe]) of the 2D MoSSe JTMD has been considered to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism, reaction barriers, kinetics and thermodynamics with reaction pathways by using first-principle based M06-L DFT35,36 calculations as depicted in Fig. 1. The molecular cluster Mo10S12Se9 describes the Mo-edge and S-/Se-edge of the 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe which is essential to investigate the HER mechanism. It has shown that the DFT calculation is the workhorse to compute the electronic properties, thermochemistry, reaction kinetics, reaction barriers, and the activation energy barriers at various active sites of TMD\u2019s to investigate HER activity.12,27,34,37\u201342 We computationally found that the Janus 2D MoSSe has exceptional electrochemical performance and electrochemical parameters like the lower value of the Tafel\nslope (59.16 mV/dec), lower activation energy barriers (both the H\u02d9-migration and Heyrovsky reactions: 3.93 \u2013 7.10 kcal.mol-1) and a larger value of turn over frequency (TOF: 3.87 x 107 \u2013 8.16 x 109 sec-1)."

            "text": "a) Periodic DFT Calculations of the 2D Monolayer MoSSe:\nThe equilibrium structures, geometries, and electronic properties of the 2D Janus MoSSe\nTMD material were calculated by the periodic hybrid HSE06 DFT method47 as shown in Fig. 2a\nand Fig. 3. All these calculations (i.e. periodic 2D slab and electronic properties calculations) have been performed by using ab initio-based CRYSTAL17 suite code.48,49 It should be noted here that the Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) were used in the CRYSTAL17 code instead of the plane wave function which is implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.50 The present method differs from the plane-wave based suite codes such as VASP, Wien2K, CP2K, CASTEP, Quantum Espresso, etc., however both the approaches reach to the comparable findings and outcomes i.e. both the VASP and CRYSTAL17 codes reach to the similar results.36,37,41 It has been studied that the localized Gaussian basis set (GTO) codes are more intuitively appropriate for solving the Hartree\u2212Fock (HF) part of the Schr\u00f6dinger equations implemented in the hybrid density functionals menthods.37,41,51\u201354 The periodic HSE06 DFT method has been implemented in the ab initio-based CRYSTAL17 suite program,48 which effectively executes hybrid functional methods and facilitates standard application of the new methods to large-scale calculations of such materials with excellent performance, even with small-scale computing resources. The HSE06 method provides more accurate electronic band gap compared to the other DFT methods.55 For prolonged van der Waals (vdW) interactions, Grimme's semi-empirical dispersion corrections (- D3) are implemented in the periodic HSE06 DFT calculations (in short DFT-D method). The quantum DFT-D (here HSE06-D3) method has been used for understanding the weak vdW interactions between the layers in 2D materials to obtain the accurate geometry, energy, electronic structure, electronic properties, etc. Triple-\u03b6 valence with polarization (TZVP) quality Gaussian type basis sets have been applied for both the S and Se atoms for representing GTOs for all the layer structure calculations56, and HAYWSC-311(d31)G Gaussian type basis sets with the HayWadt type effective core potentials (ECPs) have been employed for the Mo atoms57. In general, the DFT-D methods offers a very good quality geometry of the 2D layered structure material after reducing the spin contamination effects such that it will not show any effect on the electronic structure and properties computations (i.e., electronic band gap, band structure and the total DOS).2,5,58\u201360 The threshold employed for assessing the convergence of the energy, forces and electron density has been set to 10-7 a. u. for all the cases. The height of the unit cell is kept at 500 \u00c5 (which considers that there is no periodicity in the z-direction in the 2D layer structure model in the ab initio-based CRYSTAL17 code), i.e., the vacuum region in the z-axis was kept ~ 500 \u00c5 in these computations to accommodate the vacuum environment.36,61\nThe exposed surfaces of the (001) basal planes and the exposed edges of the (1\u0305010) (S-/Se-\nedge) and (101\u03050) (Mo-edge) boundaries of the 2D single layer Janus MoSSe TMD material are constructed here. The monolayer 2D MoSSe is terminated on these aforementioned edges boundaries during the 2D layer structure calculations as depicted in Fig. 2. It should be mentioned here that the (001) basal plane of the 2D MoSSe JTMD material with the Se-Mo-S configuration has exposed surface area at the edges of (1\u0305010) S-/Se-edge and Mo-edge (101\u03050) which are highlighted by two horizontal dashed lines shown in Fig. 2a. These two horizontal dashed lines imply the ends along the Se-/S-edge (1\u0305010) and the Mo-edge (101\u03050) as displayed in Fig. 2a. A recent experimental study on 2D TMDs materials proves this examination by evaluating the activities between the basal plane and edges.12,62 It is expected that the electrochemistry of the edges of 3D bulk structure MoSSe to be analogous to that of a 2D monolayer MoSSe material. The Mo-/Se-/S-edges in the 2D Janus MoSSe layer show the activities for electrochemical HER, therefore, the 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe material is adequate to comprehend the electrochemistry of H2 evolution reaction at the edges of this JTMD. It has been shown that the edges of the TMDs are active sites in the basal planes which are solely responsible for the electrochemical HER.12,21 The optimized 2D MoSSe JTMD was visualized in VESTA, a visualization software that is used for its illustrations and analysis.63\nMonkhorst k-mesh grids were used for computing the 2D electronic layer structure,\ngeometry, total density of states (DOS), and electronic band structures calculations as shown in\nFig. 3.64 20 x 20 x 1 k-mesh grids with a resolution 2\ud835\udf0b \u00d7 1 60 \u00c5-1 were taken account to obtain both the electronic structure and properties computations of the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD, and the shrinking factor was about 65 during all the calculations. The total eight numbers of electronic bands were calculated around the Fermi energy level (EF) in the first Brillouin zone along a high symmetric \u0393-M-K-\u0393 direction which is consistent with the symmetry of the 2D MoSSe material as depicted in Fig. 3b. Both the electronic band structures and DOS were calculated with respect to the vacuum i.e., the electrostatic potential effects were added in the present calculations. All the atomic orbitals of the Mo, S, and Se atoms were employed to calculate and draw the entire orbitals electron density of states of the pristine 2D MoSSe JTMD as shown in Fig. 3c. DFT-D3 method with the Gaussian type basis sets provides comparable results to the highest-level GoWo calculations (which are laborious and computationally extremely high-cost) available for\nsignificantly less cost.36,61 Thus, the spin-orbit coupling effects have not taken into consideration while determining these band structure and total DOS (i.e., electronic properties) of the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material.\nb) Molecular Cluster Modelling and Non-periodic DFT Calculations:\nA finite cluster model system has been constructed by considering the periodic structure of\nthe 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material which is highlighted by a triangle as shown in Fig. 2. Two horizontal dashed lines indicate terminations along the (101\u03050) Mo-edges and (1\u0305010) S/Seedges. The triangle represents the terminations for Mo-edge and S/Se-edge clusters and the dangling bonds in the finite cluster have been set by considering the same tringle as shown in Fig. 2. Each Mo atom in the basal plane (001) of the finite molecular cluster model has oxidation state of +4 and is bonded with the three numbers of the Se atoms at the upper plane and three numbers of the S atoms at the lower plane of Mo which gives a contribution of 4/6 = 2/3 electrons towards each Mo-Se and Mo-S bonding resulting a stabilized structure. The same can be understood with the oxidation state of the Se atoms in the basal plane. Selenium (Se) has -2 oxidation state and\nbonding with 3 Mo atoms results a contribution of 2/3 electrons towards each Mo-Se bond. Similarly, the edges of the periodic molecular cluster (001\u03050) is being stabilized with the 2 local electron Mo-Se bonds (as well as Mo-S bonds) having a single electron contribution towards 4 Mo-Se bonding in the basal plane as shown in the Fig. 2. This 14/3 {i.e., (2\u00d71) + [4\u00d7 (2/3)]} contribution of electrons towards the Mo-Se bonding of the edge Mo atom is satisfied with the d2 configuration of one Mo atom and d1 configuration of two Mo atoms at the edges. This configuration leads the molecular system with the periodicity of 3 which results the achievement of a stabilized molecular cluster model having three edges without any unsatisfied valency. Thus, we considered a molecular cluster Mo10S12Se9 model system (noted by [MoSSe]) to represent both the S- and Se-terminated Mo-edges on the surfaces of 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD and this molecular model system is good enough to explain the HER process.\nFig. 2a demonstrates how the finite non-periodic molecular cluster model system has been\nconstructed from the 2D periodic Janus MoSSe material to explain the exposed edges. Fig. 2b shows the equilibrium geometry of the molecular cluster model Mo10S12Se9 (noted by [MoSSe] in the reaction) obtained by the M06-L DFT method. To investigate the performance of the 2D Janus MoSSe material for HER, the non-periodic finite molecular cluster model Mo10S12Se9 system (as shown in Fig. 2b) has been considered here, and the M06-L65,66 DFT method has been applied to investigate the reaction pathways, kinetics, barriers, and mechanism. This M06-L DFT method is a technique used for energetics, equilibrium structures, thermochemistry, and frequency calculations of the molecular cluster structures, and it has been found that the M06-L method provides excellent structures, geometries, reliable reaction energies and activation barriers for organometallic chemical reaction systems.12,65,66 The 6-31+G** Gaussian types of atomic basis sets have been used for the light elements (such as O, H, as well as S atoms),67 and the LANL2DZ Gaussian atomic basis sets with the relativistic effective core potentials (ECPs) have been applied\nfor both the Se and Mo atoms. The transition structures or saddle points (both the H\u02d9-migration\nand Heyrovsky reaction steps) were computed to find the reaction barriers by confirming one imaginary frequency, modes of vibration and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations.59,68 A transition state (TS) is a first order saddle point on a potential energy surface (PES) and it is a very short-lived configuration of atoms at a local energy maximum in a reaction-energy diagram also known as reaction coordinate. The transition state of a chemical reaction is a particular configuration (i.e. short-lived structure or geometrical configuration) along the reaction\ncoordinate. A TS has partial bonds, an extremely short lifetime (measured in femtoseconds), and cannot be isolated. It is defined as the state corresponding to the highest potential energy along this reaction coordinate in PES. In other words, TS is an imaginary state between reactant and product. The vibrational spectrum of a transition state is characterized by one imaginary frequency (implying a negative force constant), which means that in one direction in nuclear configuration space the energy has a maximum, while in all other (orthogonal) directions the energy is a minimum. In order to verify if a stationary point is a transition state, a vibrational frequency calculation is performed at the same computational level as it has done in the geometry optimization. The normal mode corresponding to the imaginary frequency in the transition state usually reflects the change in geometry in going from reactants to products.69 IRC can be defined as the minimum energy reaction pathway (MERP) in mass-weighted cartesian coordinates between the transition state of a reaction and its reactants and products. It can be thought of as the path that the molecule takes moving down the product and reactant valleys with zero kinetic energy.59,68 IRC can be defined as the MERP in mass-weighted cartesian coordinates between the transition state of a reaction and its reactants and products. It can be thought of as the path that the molecule takes moving down the product and reactant valleys with zero kinetic energy. IRC approach has been used extensively in quantum chemical analysis and prediction of the mechanism of chemical reactions. The IRC gives a unique connection from a given transition structure to local minima of the reactant and product sides. This allows for easy understanding of complicated multistep mechanisms as a set of simple elementary reaction steps.21,59,68\nThermodynamic calculations and harmonic vibrational analysis were performed to obtain\nthe thermodynamic potentials such as relative Gibb\u2019s free energy (\u2206G) and enthalpy (\u2206H). The imaginary frequencies obtained during frequency optimization were carefully eliminated to confirm the stable structure indicating local minima in the potential energy surfaces (PESs). To compute the solvation effects on the reaction barriers, polarizable continuum model (PCM) calculations have been performed by using water as a solvent with dielectric constant of 80.13. The PCM was employed for all the theoretical calculations to describe the solvation effects in the M06-L DFT computations, and three H2O molecules with one H3O + have been combined unambiguously for the Heyrovsky reaction step. PCM is one of the best model to consider the solvation effects, and it is a commonly used method in computational quantum chemistry to model solvation effects.12,40,51 The PCM represents one of the most successful examples among\ncontinuum solvation models, and it has been used to explain the solvation effects in various chemical reactions.12,40,51 All the non-periodic molecular structure calculations, intermediates, transition states in the HER pathways and reaction barriers have been accomplished by using abinitio based Gaussian 16 suite code.70\nc) Validation of the Cluster Model: For the validation of the molecular cluster model system Mo10S12Se9 which has the same chemical properties as the 2D monolayer periodic slab Mo-edges of the MoSSe JTMD, we have calculated the hydrogen adsorption energies for both molecular cluster model and periodic 2D monolayer slab both under the vacuum conditions. The calculated values of hydrogen adsorption energies for both the systems are almost equal. Figure 4 shows that the hydrogen binding energies calculated by using cluster and periodic 2D slab only differ by 0.2 eV and 0.1 eV for the two stoichiometries. Thus, it can be mentioned here that the molecular cluster model has the same chemical properties compared with the periodic 2D Janus MoSSe."

            "text": "The electrocatalytic performances of the 2D monolayer MoSSe Janus have been\ncharacterized by the computations of the changes of Gibbs free energy (\u2206G) for H2 adsorption on the (1\u0305010) S-/Se-edges and (101\u03050) Mo-edges of the MoSSe JTMD. The changes of free energy (\u2206G), enthalpy (\u2206H), and electronic energy (\u2206E) in both the gas phase and solvent phase of the HER have been calculated by the following equations.\nThe value of relative Gibbs free energy (\u2206G) (i.e., free energy changes) of [MoSSe]\u2212 is\ncalculated by the subsequent equation below:\n\u2206\ud835\udc3a = \ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52]\u2212 \u2212 \ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52] \u2212 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc52 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(1)\nWhere \ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52]\u2212, G[MoSSe] and G\ud835\udc52 are the free energy of [MoSSe] \u2212, [MoSSe] and free electron (e\u2212), respectively, calculated by the M06-L DFT method. The Gibbs\u2019s free energy (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc52) of an e \u2212 has been calculated at the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) conditions where the H+ and e\u2212 are in equilibrium with 1 atm H2 at pH = 0. It is the difference between the free energies of 1/2H2 and H+ followed by previous works.12,21\nThe change of hydrogen adsorbed Gibbs free energy (\u2206GH) is calculated using the equation\nbelow\n\u2206GH = \u2206EH + \u2206EZPE \u2212 T\u2206S \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(2)\nWhere \u2206EH is the change of electronic energy of hydrogen adsorbed, \u2206EZPE is a change of zeropoint vibrational energy (ZPE) during hydrogen adsorbed, \u2206S is the change in entropy.\n\u2206EH = EJanus+H \u2212 EJanus \u2212 E1/2H2\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (3)\nwhere EJanus+H is the one H atom adsorbed electronic energy of the JTMD (here 2D MoSSe), EJanus is the electronic energy of the pristine JTMD, and E1/2H2 is the energy of half of the molecular hydrogen (H2).\n\u2206HH = HJanus+H \u2212 HJanus \u2212 H1/2H2\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (4)\nwhere HJanus+H is the enthalpy of the JTMD with one H atom adsorbed on its surface, HJanus is the enthalpy of the pristine TMD and H1/2H2 is the enthalpy of half of the H2. We have used a similar formula to calculate the reaction barriers and relative energies in the HER. In the present computations, we have considered the SHE conditions. The change of Gibbs free energy of an electron at SHE condition was computed by considering the difference between the free energies of a H+ (proton) as well as half of the H2 molecule when pH = 0.\nThe calculation of the Gibbs free energy (G) of one hydrogen (H2) molecule at 1 atm and\n298.15 K was shown in the above section followed by Huang et al.21 and Lie et al.12 The Gibbs free energy (G) of a proton at 1 M in the solvent (here water) is about -270.3 kcal.mol-1.12 The absolute value of Gibbs free energy (G) of a H+ in water solvent phase has been computed by considering its gas-phase value \u22126.3 kcal.mol-1 plus the empirical hydration energy \u2212264.0 kcal.mol-1 followed by previous work Huang et al.12 and Tissandier et. al.71 The chemical potential (\u03bce) of e \u2212 and H+ away from the SHE conditions are then calculated as:12\n\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc3b(pH) = \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc3b(pH = 0) \u2212 1.36 \u00d7 pH\nAnd\n\u03bce(E) = \u03bce(SHE) \u2212 23.06 \u00d7 E and the unit of both the cases are expressed in kcal.mol -1.12 The changes of free energies of all the non-periodic finite molecular clusters involved in the subject reaction with various numbers of e\u2212 and H+ could be examined and estimated for the rest of the calculations by using the same M06-L DFT method by considering these reference values. The\nenergies of all the systems such as [MoSSe], [MoSSeHSe] +, [MoSSe]\u2212, etc. considered in the molecular cluster model systems with the appropriate charge and multiplicity involved in the HER were computed by employing the equations 1-4.\nThe Turnover Frequency (TOF) at a specified temperature (T) can be obtained by applying\nthe energetic span approximation i.e., transition state theory (TST); \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\n\u210e \u00d7 exp (\u2212\n\u2206\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 );\nwhere kB, R, h, and T are the Boltzmann constant, Universal gas constant, Plank\u2019s constant, and absolute temperature, respectively. \u2206G is the change of free energy during the transition states formation in HER. The Tafel slope (m) has been computed by using the formula m = 2.3RT/nF; where F is Faraday constant, and n is number of electrons involved in the subject reaction. Tafel slope is an inverse measure of how strongly the reaction rate responds to changes in potential.

            "text": "The equilibrium electronic structure of the 2D Janus MoSSe monolayer material (one-unit\ncell) calculated by the HSE06-D3 DFT technique is displayed in Fig. 3a with the electronic properties i.e., band structure and total DOS as shown in Fig. 3b-c, respectively. It should be noted here that the 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe material shows in-plane asymmetry with two trigonal prismatic lattices. The 2D MoSSe JTMD presents mirror symmetry with respect to the Mo plane breaks. The hexagonal Mo plane is squeezed in between Se and S layers with unequal distance.27 It was computationally found that the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material has hexagonal P3m1 layer symmetry (2D plane layer group no. 69) with the lattice constants a = b = 3.256 \u00c5, and interfacial angles \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 90o and \u03b3 = 120o obtained by the DFT-D (HSE06-D3) method as reported in Table 1 which reproduce the earlier experimental observation and data.72 The lattice constants are also in accord with the previous computed results within 0.004 \u00c5.39 These parameters lie in between the values of the lattice constants and interfacial angles of both the pristine 2D monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 TMDs, and it was found that the MoSSe has the structural phase 2H which is reasonable accord in previous studies.27,39,71 The equilibrium Mo-Se and Mo-S bond lengths are about 2.489 \u00c5 and 2.380 \u00c5, respectively, computed by the DFT-D method reported in Table 1,\nand these values agree with earlier reported experiment and theory.27,72 Weak vdW interactions between atomic layers of 2D MoSSe structure show a significant effect on the average bond distances between the atoms present in each layer. These interactions increase the bond distances after taken into consideration in the structure calculations. The larger value of the bond distance between Mo and Se atoms compared to the Mo-S bond length is due to the large ionic radius value of the Se atom.32 This variation in the bond distances and electronegativity of chalcogen anions (Se and S) present in the structure depicts that MoSSe is asymmetric (out of planar symmetry) i.e., because in the 2D MoSSe monolayer structure, Se and S atoms are placed in the top and bottom layers in between Mo atomic layer. This dissimilarity of the electronegativity of the chalcogens (here Se and S atoms) in the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD can help the electron transfer from the solvent to the reacting system which might have a potential application in HER.\nsymmetric \u0393-M-K-\u0393 direction with respect to vacuum (w.r.t. vac.) as depicted in Fig. 3b. It was found that the Fermi energy level (EF) is at -6.48 eV and the number of four conduction bands (CB) and valance bands (VB) around the EF level have been shown in the band structure calculations, and a direct electronic band gap is found at the K-point about 2.35 eV as displayed in Fig. 3b which agrees with the previous reported findings.27,71 The direct electronic band gap (Eg) of the monolayer MoSSe JTMD is about 0.50 eV lower than the pristine 2D monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 materials which illustrates that electron density is high in the case of asymmetrical TMDs like 2D Janus TMDs. This result agrees well with the previous computational results within 0.34 eV.27 This lower value of electronic band gap (the energy gap between the valence bands\n(VB) and conduction bands (CB)) of the MoSSe JTMD helps to increase the conductivity of the structure and make it easy to transmit the electrons from the VB to the CB. The total density of states (DOS) is classified as the total number of the number of allowed electrons or holes states per volume at a given value of energy. In other words, DOS describes the number of states that are available in a system which is very essential for determining the carrier concentrations and energy distributions of carriers. The total density of states has been computed w.r.t. vac. and there are no energy band states in between -6.48 eV and -4.13 eV energy levels, and the density of states is higher at -3.0 eV energy level i.e., many energy states are accessible to be occupied as displayed in Fig. 3c. So, it means that the electron cloud is absent in the region where there is no energy band as shown in Fig. 3c.\nThe out of plane symmetry of the Janus MoSSe TMD structure causes charge imbalance\ndue to the occurrence of different chalcogen atoms (here S and Se) which results in a potential in the vertical direction of the plane. This potential shows significant alterations in the electronic structures and properties of the Janus MoSSe TMD. Therefore, the coexistence of S and Se in the MoSSe introduces exposed edges and alters the atomic environment of the chalcogens and metals in this JTMD. It should be mentioned here that the electrocatalytic performance of the MoSSe for H2 evolution matches up linearly with the total length of the exposed edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe which can be found also in the case of 2D monolayer MoS2 material. 21 The way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of the 2D Janus MoSSe material for the HER is by maximally exposing Se-, Mo- and S-edge sites using 2D monolayer MoSSe nanostructured material and the catalytically inert Se-/S-edge sites with additional exposure of active edge sites are also introduced by reducing the size of the material. In this case, the chalcogen atoms S and Se are completely responsible for changing the atomic atmosphere of the metal sites (here Mo) and chalcogen sites (here Se and S) of the 2D Janus MoSSe affecting the H2 assimilation/absorption inside the (001) basal plane. However, these 2D electronic structure and properties computations and the results do not illuminate the exceptional performance of the 2D monolayer MoSSe Janus TMD material across the ordinary pristine 2D TMDs like MoS2, MoSe2, etc. for HER. To investigate the HER performance of the 2D Janus MoSSe material, a concrete study is required to examine and explain the electrochemical activities of the catalyst by investigating the detailed reactions mechanism, complete reaction pathways, kinetics, thermodynamics, and reaction barriers.\nBy employing the finite molecular model Mo10S12Se9 system of the 2D monolayer MoSSe\nJTMD, we computed the changes of free energies (\u2206G) of the most likely intermediates with the transition states (TSs) to serve as a basis for describing the thermodynamics of HER which are relevant to the reaction process. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (\u2206GH) has been computed by using the finite cluster molecular model Mo10S12Se9 system with the M06-L DFT method. Estimating the hydrogen adsorption energy (\u2206GH) on the surface of electrocatalyst is a useful descriptor to know its activity towards HER.21,51,73 For an electrocatalyst to be efficiently active towards HER, it is necessary that the fast reactant supply and fast product delivery are required to be satisfied simultaneously. This requires the strong adsorption and strong desorption capabilities of hydrogen on the surface of catalyst which is hard to achieve at the same time. So, it is better to achieve a moderate hydrogen adsorption/desorption behavior balancing which offers an alternative way to enhance the HER performance of the catalysts. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (\u2206GH) is regarded as a theoretical description of the HER activity. A positive value indicates low kinetics of adsorption of hydrogen molecules, whereas a negative value is low kinetics of release of hydrogen molecules. The (\u2206GH) value should be close to thermo-neutral for the desired catalyst which should bind H neither too strongly nor too weakly.21,51,73 The present DFT calculation reveals that the first H energetically prefers to make a bond to the Se atom by an amount of energy \u2206GH = 0.42 eV (which is equivalent to 9.65 kcal.mol -1), whereas the value of \u2206GH is positive (+17.99 kcal.mol-1 i.e. equivalent to +0.78 eV) when the H makes a bond with the Mo atom in the 2D MoSSe JTMD. In other words, the value of hydrogen adsorption energy \u2206GH at the metal side (here Mo) of the 2D MoSSe is about 0.78 eV (i.e. 17.99 kcal.mol-1 i.e. the change of free energy or relative free energy) computed by the M06-L DFT method considering the Mo10S12Se9 cluster model system. The value of \u2206GH is about 0.81 eV when the hydrogen adsorption happens at the S site in the 2D MoSSe cluster model system computed at the same level of theory. These results indicate that the first H energetically prefers to make a bond to the Se atom by an amount of energy 0.42 eV. The present computed results agree with the reported theoretical values of the 2D monolayer MoS2 material wherever available. 21 Therefore, we can say that the direct hydrogen adsorption on the Mo-edge side is not thermodynamically favorable at the initial stage of the HER i.e., H would like to prefer to create the first bond with the Se atom in the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD.\nIn order to illustrate the H2 evolution reaction mechanisms and the electrochemical\ncatalytic activities as well as the performance of the 2D Janus MoSSe monolayer TMD material, we computationally explored the H2 evolution reaction pathways considering two reaction steps; (i) Volmer reaction step where protons (H+) interact with the electrons, and the hydrogen atoms get adsorbed on the active region of the catalyst (in short; * + H+ + e- H*ads; where * represents the active sites of the catalyst), and after the Volmer reaction, the H\u2022-migrates from the\nS or Se (chalcogen site) to the Mo (metal site); and (ii) Heyrovsky reaction step where the H2 has been formed by absorbing one solvated proton (H+) from the solvent (here water) interacting with the absorbed H in the MoSSe. It has been considered here that the HER happens at the Seterminated Mo-edges on the surfaces of 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD, and the HER process at the S-terminated Mo-edges of the MoSSe JTMD has been also considered for comparing the performance of electrocatalytic activities. The detailed reaction pathway is shown in Fig. 5, and the thermodynamic computations have been performed at T = 298.15 K temperature. In addition, Volmer\u2212Tafel mechanism has been also considered in the present study. The same molecular\ncluster model system Mo10S12Se9 (noted by [MoSSe]) of the 2D Janus MoSSe has been considered for investigating the HER mechanism, reaction paths, reaction thermodynamics, kinetics, and\nreaction energy barriers of the H\u02d9-migration, Volmer\u2212Tafel as well as Heyrovsky reaction steps.\nThe equilibrium geometries, intermediates, and transition states (TSs) also known as 1st order saddle points have been computed by the same M06-L DFT method and they are displayed in Fig. 6a-i and 7. Various equilibrium bond lengths (average) of the pristine MoSSe, reactants, products, reaction intermediates, and transition states (TSs) appeared during the HER process are reported in Table 2. In order to investigate the HER in detailed, all the possible reaction steps have been considered. To proceed the HER, it is required to add protons (H+) and electrons (e\u035e ) simultaneously to the finite non-periodic molecular cluster model systems considered in the present study as depicted in Fig. 6-7. It should be mentioned here that it is beneficial to investigate all the equilibrium structures and stable geometries of the molecular clusters appeared during the HER process with the addition of extra electrons and protons to realize the changes of electronic energies and thermodynamical potentials i.e., \u2206G and \u2206H. These calculations will help us to find out the most thermodynamically favorable reaction pathways with the lowest reaction energy barriers in the H2 evolution reaction process. In the HER steps, two exchange barriers (i.e., the\nlargest and second-largest barriers) are important to assess the performance of the Janus MoSSe as an electrocatalyst.\n(noted by [MoSSe]) at the SHE conditions leading to a negatively charged cluster [MoSSe] \u0336, and in the next step, hydride ion is absorbed on an energetically favorable Se site. This accompanies a hydride (H\u035e ) shift to the reactive site of the catalyst, here it is the next adjoining metal atom (more specifically Mo) site. At first, one electron is transferred to the MoSSe formed [MoSSe]  \u0336 with a change of favorable Gibbs free energy (\u2206G) about -3.63 kcal mol-1 at the SHE condition with E = 0 V and pH = 0 reported in Table 3. Therefore, the first reduction potential to form the [MoSSe]  \u0336 was about -157 mV which indicates that a negatively charged [MoSSe]  \u0336 cluster is thermodynamically stable in the solvated in water. In other words, the present DFT calculation\nindicates that the first reduction potential is -157 mV which leads to form the [MoSSe] \u0336 solvated in the water. It should be mentioned here that the equilibrium Mo-Se bond length has been slightly elongated by an amount 0.03 \u00c5 and the Mo-S bond length has been reduced by an amount 0.06 \u00c5 after the first electron reduction in the [MoSSe] \u0336 . In the next step, one proton (H+) is absorbed by the [MoSSe] \u0336 to form the [MoSSe]HSe and the proton is attached to the Se-edge side. The value of \u2206G to adsorb the proton on the surface of the electrocatalyst [MoSSe] \u0336 is about -16.08 kcal mol1 with the change of enthalpy (\u2206H) about -13.56 kcal mol-1 as reported in Table 3. The equilibrium Mo-Se bond length remains the same in the [MoSSe]HSe system as the [MoSSe] \u0336 , however, the equilibrium Mo-S bond length has been elongated by an amount 0.04 \u00c5 after the protonation. The equilibrium Se-H bond length Mo-Se is about 1.48 \u00c5 in the [MoSSe]HSe system computed at M06L DFT method. The [MoSSe]HSe \u0336 is formed due to the second electron transfer to the 2D Janus MoSSe material (i.e., [MoSSe]HSe), and thus this HER is a two-electron transfer reaction. Both the equilibrium bond lengths Mo-Se and Mo-S have been found to be 2.56 \u00c5 and 2.40 \u00c5, respectively, in the [MoSSe]HSe \u0336 after second electron reduction, and the equilibrium Se-H bond length remains the same as [MoSSe]HSe. In the next step of the reaction, the H \u2022 migrates from the\nSe side to the Mo side which is called as the H\u02d9-migration step which occurs after the Volmer reaction. The Volmer reaction in the HER process at the (101\u03050) Mo-edges occurs between the hydrogens on neighboring Molybdenum and Selenium atoms at the active sites of the 2D MoSSe JTMD material, and the adjacent H atom at the Se site moves towards the Mo site via a transition state (TS) which is called as H\u02d9-migration TS noted by (TS1). This TS1 has an imaginary frequency (~ -146 cm-1) with mode of vibration towards the Se to Mo direction. The equilibrium structure of the TS1 is shown in Fig. 6e and the present DFT study reveals that the TS1 has equilibrium bond lengths about 1.64 \u00c5 for the Se-H (contrasted to a normal Se\u2212H bond of 1.48 \u00c5 in the [MoSe]HSe \u0336 ) and 2.00 \u00c5 for the Mo\u2212H (contrasted to the equilibrium Mo\u2212H bond of 1.72 \u00c5 in the [MoSe]HMo  \u0336\n) as shown in Table . In other words, the Se-H bond length has been increased by an amount 0.16\n\u00c5 during the H\u02d9-migration reaction (i.e., the H\u02d9 migrates from the Se site to Mo site in the HER\nprocess). The value of the change of enthalpy (\u2206H) of the TS1 during the H\u2022\u0336 migration reaction was found to be about 1.90 kcal mol-1 and the reaction barrier (\u2206G) is about 3.93 kcal mol-1 computed in gas phase by DFT method as reported in Table 3. Therefore, it can be noted here that the reaction rate-determining step is the absorption of a proton and the formation of adsorbed\nhydrogen atom in the Volmer reaction mechanism during the reactions in gas phase. The present DFT computations reveal that this is the lowest H\u2022\u0336 migration reaction barrier 3.93 kcal mol-1 for\nthe HER indicating that the 2D Janus MoSSe monolayer material is an excellent electrocatalyst to evolve H2. It should be mentioned here that the present M06-L DFT calculations found that the first hydrogen strongly favors to create a bond to the Se atoms at the edges of selenium rather than the Mo atoms by an amount of 9.65 kcal mol-1 energy (the change of free energy, \u2206G) and leads to a net binding energy relative to H2 of 2.5 kcal mol -1. After including the solvation effects (i.e., PCM calculations in water as a solvent), the corrections of entropy and zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE), the value of the \u2206G due to the addition of hydrogen atom to the Se-edge is energetically favorable by an amount about 7.8 kcal mol-1 computed by the M06-L DFT method. After the addition of one electron (e-) to the cluster [MoSSe]HSe, it reduces to [MoSSe]HSe \u0336 . When the system is negatively charged, H\u2022 - migration occurs with a very small activation barrier of 3.93 kcal mol-1 at a potential of 0.17 V. The direct hydrogen absorption or protonation in the metal side (here Mo) is energetically not favorable due to its high energy barrier of protonation. This study found that the reaction barrier energy \u2206G is very high about 27.5 kcal mol-1 when the direct protonation occurs at the Mo-edges, nevertheless, the value of \u2206G at the Se-edges is reduced to - 16.08 kcal mol-1 with the change of enthalpy (\u2206H) about -13.56 kcal mol-1 which is more thermodynamically favorable compared to the first case. Thus, the hydrogen absorbs at the Se site first, then, the H-atom migrates from the Se sites to the metal sites (here Mo atoms) with a very small reaction barrier (\u2206G) about 3.93 kcal mol-1 known as H\u2022\u0336 migration reaction barrier, and\nfinally reacts with a proton from solution to form H2. These multiple steps lower the reaction barrier for the whole process and make it energetically more favorable and suitable for further reaction.\nIn the next step of HER, H2 has been formed due to the Heyrovsky reaction where three\nexplicit water molecules with one hydronium (H3O +) cluster model system have been considered in the reaction to explain the H2 formation as depicted in Fig. 6h. In other words, the last step of the HER is the H2 formation which is known as Heyrovsky reaction mechanism as depicted in Fig. 5. In this step, the hydride H \u0336 (which has been migrated to the Mo-edges) reacts with a solvated proton (H+) nearby explicit one H3O + and three water molecules as shown in Fig. 6h. The optimized Heyrovsky transition state (TS2) obtained in the Heyrovsky reaction step is shown in Fig. 6h, and\nthis TS2 corresponds to the formation of H2 in the presence of four explicit water molecules (3H2O + H3O + molecules) by two-electron (2e-) transfer mechanism of HER. The average equilibrium OH bond length in the water cluster of the Heyrovsky TS2 is about 0.97 \u00c5, and the equilibrium MoSe and Mo-S bond lengths during the TS2 formation are about 2.56 \u00c5 and 2.41 \u00c5, respectively, computed by the M06-L DFT method. The equilibrium Mo-H bond length was about 1.85 \u00c5 and the H-H bond length was about 0.93 \u00c5 during the formation of the Heyrovsky TS2 as depicted in Fig. 6h. This H-H bond length (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b \u2032 ) in the TS2 is about 0.17 \u00c5 higher than the equilibrium H-H bond length (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b) of a pure H2 molecule computed at the same level of DFT method. The equilibrium O-H+ (where the H+ is creating a bond with the H-Mo in the [MoSSe]HMoHSe of the TS2) bond distance in the Heyrovsky TS is about 1.28 \u00c5. The source of a proton (H+) is the solvation of hydronium (H3O +) in this reaction step, and the rate-determining step of this mechanism requires (in the gas phase reaction) the proton which is used to react with the adsorbed H \u0336 to form H2. The present DFT computation found that the Heyrovsky reaction barrier is about 5.61 kcal.mol-1 in the gas phase as tabulated in Table 3, and these two barriers, H\u2022\u0336 migration and\nHeyrovsky reaction barriers, are indicated by blue and red dotted circles in Fig. 5 (i.e. largest, and second-largest barriers). The position of H\u2022 in the TS1 during the H\u2022\u0336 migration reaction step and\nH2 formation in the Heyrovsky step (TS2) was highlighted by a red dotted color in Fig. 6e and 6h. These two reaction barriers are the lowest compared to the other pristine 2D monolayer WS2 or MoS2 materials and their alloys as reported in Table 4. 12 Therefore, the present DFT calculations reveal that the electrochemical H2 evolution performance of the 2D monolayer MoSSe Janus TMD material is better than other kinds of TMD materials such as pristine TMDs, i.e., WS2 or MoS2 materials and their hybrid alloys as both the reactions barriers (H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky reaction steps) for the H\u2022-migration and H2 formation are the lowest among the other materials and electrocatalysts. This reaction mechanism provides intuitions on why 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD is a very good electrocatalyst for effective H2 evolution reaction.\nThere is another possibility to form H2 by Volmer\u2212Tafel reaction mechanism, where two\nhydrogens, which are already absorbed at the Mo- and Se-edges next each other in the molecular cluster [MoSSe]HMoHSe, chemically react to produce a H2 molecule. As the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material has Se, Mo and S atoms in a tri-layer form Se-Mo-S, the types Se\u2212H + H\u2212Se and Mo\u2212H + H\u2212Se have been considered in the present calculations to explain the Volmer\u2212Tafel\nreaction mechanism. This transition state geometry i.e. Tafel TS (TS3) was found to have bond distances of 1.74 \u00c5 for Mo\u2212H (compared to the equilibrium Mo\u2212H bond of 1.67 \u00c5), 1.57 \u00c5 for H\n\u2212H (compared to a final H\u2212H bond of 0.76 \u00c5), and 1.51 \u00c5 for Se\u2212H (compared to a normal S\u2212H\nbond of 1.48 \u00c5) obtained by the M06-L DFT method. The Tafel TS geometry is depicted in Fig. 7 (at the right-hand side), and this H-H bond length (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b \u2032 ) in the TS3 is about 0.81 \u00c5 higher than the equilibrium H-H bond length (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b) of a natural H2 calculated at the same level of theory. It should be mentioned here that we considered both the Se and Mo atoms edges as the reaction occurs on the Se-/Mo-edges. However, impeding the H atoms on two neighboring Se and Mo atoms to move toward a possible transition state (TS3) known as Volmer\u2212Tafel TS shown in Fig. 7. In other words, the absorbed two H-atoms in the [MoSSe]HMoHSe, reacts each other via a possible transition state TS3 which is called Volmer-Tafel TS. Consequently, the Volmer\u2212Tafel reaction on the Mo-edge occurs between the hydrogens on the adjacent Se and Mo atoms in the MoSSe JTMD during HER. The harmonic vibrational calculations and eigen vector analysis have shown that the TS3 has a single imaginary frequency about -322 cm-1 before going to form H2 during the HER. The reaction barrier (\u2206G) was found to be 8.52 kcal.mol-1 above the preceding intermediate [MoSSe]HSeHMo computed by the M06-L DFT method. The changes of electronic energy (\u2206E) and enthalpy (\u2206H) of the TS3 in this Volmer\u2212Tafel step were about 8.68 and 8.49 kcal.mol-1 with respect to [MoSSe]HSeHMo, respectively, as depicted in Table 2. Therefore, these calculations indicate that the Volmer\u2212Tafel reaction step is thermodynamically less favorable compared to the VolmerHeyrovsky step for the H2 evolution.\nA further examination has been carried out to investigate the electrocatalytic activities of\nthe S-terminated Mo-edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe material for HER considering the same cluster model system. The same H2 evolution reaction path (as depicted in Fig. 5) has been considered by taking account the S-terminated Mo-edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe material i.e., the HER takes place at the S-terminated Mo-edges of the [\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52] considering the same finite cluster model system Mo10S12Se9. Equilibrium geometries of the important intermediates and transition states involved in the subject reaction; [\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52]\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc60 \u2212, [\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52]\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c, TS4 (H\u02d9migration) and TS5 (Heyrovsky) are shown in Fig. 8 as they are playing a significant role to determine the performance of electrocatalytic activities for effective HER. The present DFT-D\ncalculations found that the H\u02d9-migration reaction barrier (\u2206G) is about 10.08 kcal.mol-1, and the\nchanges of electronic energy (\u2206E) and enthalpy (\u2206H) are about 10.10 and 9.70 kcal.mol-1, respectively, when the reaction occurs at the S-terminated Mo-edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe material. In this case, the reaction barrier (i.e., the change of Gibbs free energy \u2206G) of TS4 is about 6.15 kcal.mol-1 higher than the previous case TS1 when the reaction happens at the Se-terminated Mo-edges of this 2D MoSSe JTMD material. Similarly, the Heyrovsky transition barrier has been computed at the same level of DFT theory at the S-terminated Mo-edges as depicted in Fig. 7d, and the values of TS5 barrier (\u2206G) is about 14.05 kcal.mol-1, and the values of \u2206E and \u2206H are about 13.22 and 12.58 kcal.mol-1, respectively. The Heyrovsky\u2019s reaction barrier is about 8.44 kcal.mol-1 higher than the same barrier of the TS2 when the HER happens at the Se-terminated Mo-edges. These calculations indicate that the HER process at the S-terminated Mo-edges of the 2D MoSSe JTMD is thermodynamically less favorable than the Se-terminated Mo-edges.\nMoSP 12.90-14.0 9.2-12.90 34 2.2x103** [49] MoSSe* 3.93-7.10 4.72-5.61 59.16 3.87 x 107 This work. *The HER happens at the Se-terminated Mo-edges on the surfaces of 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD.\n** Computed using the previous reported experimental results.\nThe reaction barrier energy and pathways have been computed in the solvent phase\nstudying polarization continuum model (PCM) analysis, and the solvent phase computations have been performed by considering water as a solvent. It should be noted here that a dielectric constant value of 80.13 was used in the PCM calculations, which helps to explore the solvation effects in HER mechanism of the MoSSe JTMD. The H\u2022 \u0336 migration activation energy barrier (here \u2206E) for HER in the solvent phase is about 7.10 kcal mol-1 which is the lowest compared to the pristine MoS2 and WS2 materials and their alloys (11.9 \u2013 18.1 kcal mol -1).12 The activation energy barrier (here \u2206E) for the H2 formation by the Heyrovsky mechanism on the surfaces of the 2D MoSSe is about 4.72 kcal mol-1 in the solvent phase as shown in Table 5, which is also the lowest barrier compared to the pristine TMDs and their alloys as depicted in Table 4.12 These lower values of both the activation energy barriers lead to the establishment of a sophisticated number of active sites by shrinking the value of electrochemical properties like Tafel slope (m) and increasing the turnover frequency (TOF) for an excellent catalytic activity to generate molecular hydrogen. A comparison has been drawn to predict the electrocatalytic HER efficiency of the pristine 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material with the other TMDs, their hybris alloys, and transition metal phosphide (TMP) MoP and S-doped MoP. The present study illustrates that the pristine 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material has shown the lowest reaction barriers (both the H\u2022\u0336 migration\nand Heyrovsky) and the highest value of TOF compared to the pristine TMDs, their hybrid alloys, MoP and S-doped MoP (i.e. MoSP) as shown in Table 4. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) calculations on both the TS1 and TS2 have been performed to get a scientific insight into the electronic role in the HER mechanism. An explanation can be given from the HOMO-LUMO structures of both the TS1 and TS2 to support the lower activation barriers in the HER. The equilibrium HOMO-LUMO structures of both the TS1 (H\u2022\u0336 migration TS) and TS2 (Heyrovsky TS) are depicted in Fig. 9. Accordingly, the\nHeyrovsky mechanism, in which the H atom bound to Mo site recombines to form H2 is the one\npresent on the Janus MoSSe. The electrochemical parameters Tafel slope and turn over frequency (TOF) were computed by the DFT method, and the values are 59.16 mV/dec and 2.15 x 109 sec-1. The computed TOF of the MoSSe JTMD is the highest compared to the ordinary TMDs and their alloys.12 The DFT-D estimated Tafel slope (m) of this 2D MoSSe material is comparable to the TMDs alloys WxMo1-xS2. 12 The formation of the H2 molecule is confirmed by the overlapping of s-orbitals of the H-atoms connected to the Mo atoms in the MoSSe JTMD and s-orbitals of the hydrogen atoms in the water cluster.\nThe present DFT computations revealed that both the reaction barriers (H\u2022\u0336 migration and\nHeyrovsky) for HER are the lowest among the ordinary 2D TMDs (such as MoS2, WS2, etc.) and these values are very close to the Pt(111) catalyst when the HER takes places at the Se-terminated Mo-edges on the surfaces of 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD. To support our computational results and\nexplain the HER activity of the 2D Janus MoSSe, we further extended the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO), the HOMO and the LUMO calculations of both the H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky transition\nstate (noted by TS1 and TS2) which can explain the HER mechanism from the electronic charge as well as overlapping of the atomic/molecular orbitals. The HOMO and LUMO were obtained from the optimized transition states of both the H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky reaction step as shown\nin Fig. 9a-d, and the charge clouds were indicated by a red dotted circle between two hydrogen atoms in which H-migrates from the Se to Mo (in TS1) and the H2 is formed (in TS2) due to the overlapping of the molecular orbitals. The NBO study delivers the most probable \u2018natural Lewis structure\u2019 picture of the wave function (\u03c6), such that total information related to orbitals is selected mathematically to consider the maximum possible energy of electron density.74 An advantage of this orbital is that it gives information about the intra-molecular and inter-molecular interactions (i.e. connections between bonds of atoms of the molecule). Donor acceptor interactions in NBO calculations are known from second order fock-matrix.75 Chemical stability and reactivity of molecules can be understood from the HOMO and LUMO energies with the wave functions. The structural stability of a molecule is known from the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energies.76, 77 Electron donor unit and electron acceptor unit capabilities are known from HOMO and LUMO energies, respectively.\nThe total wave function of the HOMO and LUMO appeared at the equilibrium Heyrovsky\ntransition structure TS2 is the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) of the Mo, S, H, O, and Se atoms obtained by the NBO calculations. Similarly, the total wave function of the HOMOLUMO structure of the TS1 is the LACO of the Mo, S, Se and H atoms as shown in Fig. 9a-b. It should be mentioned here that the rate-determining step of the H2 evolution reaction in gas phase is Heyrovsky reaction step as the barrier is 5.61 kcal.mol-1. Whereas the H\u2022\u0336 migration reaction step\nis the rate-determining step of HER in the solvent phase (i.e., water) as the reaction barrier during the H\u2022\u0336 migration reaction is about 7.10 kcal.mol-1 computed by the M06L DFT method. The\nHOMO structures of both the transition states TS1 and TS2 provide an intuition of the electronic role in both the H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky steps during the H2 evolution. This study found that\nthe TS1 are alleviated by the overlap of the s-orbital of the H2, and the d-orbitals of the Mo metal atoms as displayed in Fig. 9a-d. The present computations shows that the Tafel slope is lower for the 2D Janus MoSSe due to the presence of this overlap of s-orbital of the hydrogen and the d-\norbitals of Molybdenum atoms appeared in the HOMO and LUMO structure the transition states TS1 during H\u02d9-migration reaction step. A better atomic orbital overlap of the s-orbitals of the hydrogen atom attached with the Mo in the MoSSe JTMD and the water cluster (3H2O + H3O +) seemed in the HOMO-LUMO Heyrovsky\u2019s transition state TS2 during H2 formation has been observed in Fig. 9c-d. This better overlap of the atomic orbitals during the H2 creation in the Heyrovsky\u2019s TS2 reduces the reaction barrier. Therefore, it can say that this better stabilization (compared to the pristine MoS2 and WS2) 12 of the orbitals in the reaction limiting step TS1 for H\u2022 \u0336\nmigration (solvent phase) and TS2 for H2-formation (in the gas phase) is a key for reducing the Heyrovsky\u2019s reaction barrier, thus the overall catalysis indicating a better electrocatalytic performance for H2 evolution. The electronic charged cloud represents the positive and negative part of the wave functions with the violet and pink color transparent cloud around Mo, S, Se, O, and H atoms as shown in Fig. 9. The electron cloud (noted by pink color) in between two H atoms in the Heyrovsky transition state structure highlighted by the red dotted circle is more in the case of pristine 2D MoSSe JTMD in comparison to the pristine 2D MoS2 TMD structure in presence of four explicit water molecules in Heyrovsky step of H2 evolution. Therefore, the Heyrovsky transition state TS2 of the rate-limiting reaction step in the gas phase calculation i.e., the Heyrovsky reaction step has been sustained by overlapping the atomic s-orbitals of the H atoms attached with the Mo atom and the adjacent hydronium (H3O +) in the explicit water cluster to form the H2 molecules during HER. Similarly, the TS1 of the rate-limiting reaction step of the H \u2022\u0336\nmigration step (in the solvent phase calculation) was prolonged by the d-orbitals of the Mo atoms and the s-orbital of the H atom during the HER process as depicted in Fig. 9a-b. It should be noted here that these overlapping with better stabilization (compared to the pristine 2D monolayer MoS2 and WS2) 12 determines the reaction barriers and electrocatalytic performance of the 2D MoSSe JTMD for effective HER. This is the reason behind the 2D Janus MoSSe material which has shown an excellent catalytic activity for effective HER, and the electron transfer from the solvent to the catalysts is faster than ordinary pristine 2D TMDs due to different electronegativity of the chalcogen Se and S atoms in the 2D Janus MoSSe TMD.\nIn the Janus structure of the 2D MoSSe material, the breaking of structural symmetry\nprovides a large inherent lattice stress and has substantial impacts in modifying the electronic band structures for characteristic physical, electronic, materials and chemical properties. The advent of\nthe in-gap states and the change in the Fermi energy (EF) level of the Janus structure of this 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material due to the structural asymmetry largely effect the hydrogen adsorption on the surfaces of it. It should be mentioned here that both the chalcogen atomic edges (Se and S) and metal edges (i.e., Mo-edge) of the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material are catalytically active for the H2 evolution reactions (as shown in our present computed results) leading to an excellent electrocatalytic performance compared to the pristine 2D MoS2 TMD. The present study furnishes a unique computational technique to enhance the H2 creation through the development of novel 2D MoSSe JTMD and electrochemical HER process on the edges of the Janus monolayer MoSSe material. It has been studied that the Janus structure's intrinsic dipole lead to considerable bending of bands for obtaining band edge positions comparable to redox potentials of water, which renders the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD as an auspicious electrocatalyst for gaining the maximum amount of hydrogen adsorption on its surface.72 It should be mentioned here that the Janus asymmetry in the 2D monolayer MoSSe material is the origin of enhanced HER activity and it is minimizing both the H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky reaction barriers due to the atomic orbitals overlap (s-orbital of the hydrogen and d-orbitals of Mo atoms in H\u2022\u0336 migration TS\ns-orbital of the hydrogen atoms in the case of Heyrovsky TS) during the TS formation in HER. Therefore, the present DFT results have shown the way of pavement to develop a highperformance and earth abundant asymmetric 2D Janus monolayer TMD materials for an efficient HER electrocatalysts. This study has shown an improved catalytic property of the JTMD toward highly efficient production of H2 by providing a minimum energy reaction pathway forward for sustainable H2 evolution from the 2D monolayer MoSSe Janus TMD driven catalysis."

            "text": "In summary, we computationally developed 2D Janus MoSSe material by employing\nhybrid periodic HSE06-D3 DFT method and studied their electronic properties i.e., band structure and total density of states. The electronic property calculations showed that the asymmetric 2D monolayer MoSSe Janus TMD is a semi-conductor with a direct electronic band gap about 2.35 eV, which is lower than the pristine TMDs, and the total density of states calculations depict that electronic density has been increased in asymmetrical 2D Janus MoSSe. It has been found that the\nexposed surfaces with the Se-/S-edges (1\u0305010) and Mo-edges (101\u03050) of the 2D monolayer Janus TMD material are electrocatalytic active for HER. Modeling these active-edges of a monolayer 2D Janus MoSSe TMD material with a non-periodic finite Mo10S12Se9 molecular cluster system, the present DFT study showed that the H2 evolution occurs through the Volmer\u2212Heyrovsky reaction mechanism including a H3O + and an e- rich molybdenum hydride. In other words, the\nHER process on the exposed surfaces of the 2D MoSSe JTMD follows the most thermodynamically favorable Volmer\u2212Heyrovsky reaction mechanism instead of Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanism. It was computationally found that the 2D Janus MoSSe monolayer material is an outstanding electrocatalyst for HER. It was observed that the overall chemical reaction of HER has followed two-electron (2e - ) transfer mechanism steps (i.e., Volmer and Heyrovsky). The\nelectrochemical performance for the HER and electrochemical catalytic activity of the 2D monolayer Janus MoSSe have been described by calculating the change of Gibb\u2019s free energy (\u2206G) during HER in the Volmer reaction, H\u2022\u0336 migration step and H2 formation energy in the Heyrovsky reaction step. The values of the H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky reaction barriers (\u2206G) are 3.93 kcal.mol-1 and 5.61 kcal.mol-1, respectively, (computed in gas phase), and the values of \u2206G of both the reaction barriers are about 7.10 kcal.mol-1 and 4.72 kcal.mol-1, respectively, found in the solvent phase (i.e., water solution) calculations. Activation energy values are decreased due to the steadiness of rate determinant H2 formation Heyrovsky step\u2019s transition state in the gas phase reaction and different electronegativity of the chalcogens (S and Se) in the asymmetric JTMD MoSSe. These lower values of activation energies, Tafel slope (59.16 mV/dec) and larger value of TOF facilitated the increase of the adsorption of hydrogen on the MoSSe catalytic surface. The transition state TS1 is alleviated by the better overlap (compared to the pristine 2D TMDs, such as MoS2, WS2, etc.) of atomic s-orbital of the H2 molecules and the d-orbitals of the Mo atoms during the HER process. The overlap of the s-orbitals of the hydrogen atom attached with the Mo in the MoSSe JTMD and the water cluster (3H2O + H3O +) seemed in the HOMO-LUMO Heyrovsky\u2019s transition state TS2 during H2 formation has been found in the present study, and this better overlap of the atomic orbitals during the H2 creation in the Heyrovsky\u2019s TS2 reduces the reaction barrier. This stabilization of the reaction limiting step in both the gas and solvent phases is a key for reducing both the H\u2022\u0336 migration and Heyrovsky\u2019s reaction energy barriers, which results in a better\nelectrocatalytic performance for HER compared to the ordinary TMDs. This mechanism offers a\nkey intuition on why the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD material is an effective electrocatalyst for HER, i.e., the tuning of the d-orbital of the JTMDs overlaps with the s-orbital H2 is of the most importance during the reactions and formation of the transition state. We can say that the Janus 2D monolayer MoSSe material has the potential for applications in renewable energy technology and hydrogen fuel cell that can be stored, transported, and used in a zero-emission fuel cell of combustion engine in near future. In conclusion, 2D layer asymmetric structures have been proven to be excellent materials as catalysts for the evolution of hydrogen. To design a more reactive, efficient, and high performance electrocatalyst for HER from exposed surfaces and edges of the 2D monolayer Janus TMD material, the researchers must concentrate on reducing both the H\u2022\u0336\nmigration and Heyrovsky reaction barriers."
