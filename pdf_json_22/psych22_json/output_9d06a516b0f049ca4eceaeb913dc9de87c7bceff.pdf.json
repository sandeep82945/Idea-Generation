    "abstractText": "Background Long-term cocaine exposure leads to dysregulation of the reward system and initiates processes that ultimately weaken its rewarding effects. Here, we studied the influence of an escalating-dose cocaine regimen on drug-associated appetitive behavior after a withdrawal period, along with corresponding molecular changes in plasma and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methods We applied a 5 day escalating-dose cocaine regimen in rats. We assessed anxiety-like behavior at the beginning of the withdrawal period in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. The reinforcement properties of cocaine were evaluated in the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) test along with ultrasonic vocalization (USV) in the appetitive range in a drugassociated context. We assessed corticosterone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), \u03b2-endorphin, CART 55\u2013102 levels in plasma (by ELISA), along with mRNA levels for D2 dopaminergic receptor (D2R), \u03ba-receptor (KOR), orexin 1 receptor (OX1R), CART 55\u2013102, and potential markers of cocaine abuse: miRNA-124 and miRNA-137 levels in the PFC (by PCR). Results Rats subjected to the escalating-dose cocaine binge regimen spent less time in the cocaine-paired compartment, and presented a lower number of appetitive USV episodes. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in corticosterone and CART levels, an increase in POMC and \u03b2-endorphin levels in plasma, and an increase in the mRNA for D2R and miRNA124 levels, but a decrease in the mRNA levels for KOR, OX1R, and CART 55\u2013102 in the PFC. Conclusions The presented data reflect a part of a bigger picture of a multilevel interplay between neurotransmitter systems and neuromodulators underlying processes associated with cocaine abuse.",

            "text": "A common symptom in cocaine addicts is impairment of reward anticipation. We know so far that long-term doseescalating psychostimulant (cocaine) administration leads to dysregulation of the reward system and initiates processes that ultimately result in the weakening of the dopaminergic signal reflected by a decrease in the rewarding effect of a drug [1\u20137]. This phenomenon may lead to increased drug consumption, compulsive drug-seeking, and loss of control over drug use despite its adverse consequences [8, 9].\nCortical regions are implicated in the control of rewardseeking behavior and reinforcement mechanisms associated with cue-potentiated behavior [10\u201316]. The bidirectional regulation occurs between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons and its target, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), playing an essential role in control over reward system activity [9, 17, 18].\nDysregulation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis is also supposed to contribute to craving and early relapse-associated processes [19, 20]. A lot of research points to the role of neuromodulators related to the HPA axis and hypothalamic peptides, the cocaine and amphetamineregulated transcript (CART 55\u2013102), and orexins, which are highly expressed in structures composing the HPA axis, as modulators of dopaminergic neurotransmission [12\u201314, 16, 21\u201323]. Orexin neurons co-express the inhibitory opioid dynorphin, and those two peptides are characterized by opposing actions on motivated behavior, namely, orexin is implicated in states of arousal and reward, whereas dynorphin is implicated in depressive-like states [24]. Orexin signaling in the PFC is implicated in the reinstatement of reward seeking [25\u201328].\nIn the current study, we were looking for a molecular pattern associated with an altered appetitive response to cocaine after the withdrawal period following dose-escalating administration. In humans, cocaine is usually consumed in recurrent cycles, which occur over 1\u20137\u00a0days with a period of abstinence accompanied by depressive symptoms and anxiety [29\u201335]. In the current study, we applied an escalating-dose cocaine regimen in rats, which was modeled to mimic the human pattern of cocaine abuse. In the study, we assessed anxiety-like behavior in the early withdrawal\nperiod in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test, as anxiety and depression-related behavior prevails typically during the initial period of abstinence [36]. The reinforcement properties of cocaine were evaluated in the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) test [37, 38] along with ultrasonic vocalization (USV) in the appetitive range (30\u2013120\u00a0kHz, mainly referred to as 50\u00a0kHz) in the drug-associated context, often used to measure appetitive response to the context of various rewarding stimuli [39].\nIn search for a molecular pattern associated with altered response to cocaine we measured neuromodulators related to the HPA axis and hypothalamic peptides, namely corticosterone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), \u03b2-endorphin, along with CART 55\u2013102 levels in plasma, and mRNA levels for D2 dopaminergic receptor, \u03ba-opioid receptor (KOR), orexin 1 receptor (OX1R), CART 55\u2013102, and previously suggested markers of cocaine abuse: microRNA-124 (miRNA124) and microRNA-137 (miRNA-137) levels, in the PFC [40\u201342]."

The apparatus and procedure were previously described by Taracha et\u00a0al., 2014 [44]. Two CPP apparatuses were used simultaneously, thoroughly cleaned after each rat. The apparatuses were separated with a 1.1 \u00d7 0.7\u00a0m (L \u00d7 H) sound-attenuating wall made of a 2-cm thick particle board with a black veneer on both sides. Rats\u2019 behaviors in non-preferred and preferred areas were recorded with a ceiling-mounted EV-650CG video camera (Sony, Japan) and analyzed by the computerised system EthoVision XT VideoTracking System v.7 (Noldus Information Technology B.V., Wageningen, The Netherlands). Natural place preference was determined in a 15\u00a0min pre-test at the beginning of the experiment. The CCP training was carried out for 4 consecutive days. On the first day, the rats were given an i.p. saline injection and were instantly confined to the preferred section of the apparatus for 40\u00a0min. On the next day, designated rats received a cocaine injection and were immediately confined to the non-preferred section of the apparatus for 40\u00a0min. The 10\u00a0mg/kg cocaine (an adjusted volume 2\u00a0ml/kg) dose was used in all CPP training sessions. The training procedure was repeated over the next two days. The cocaine injections were performed between 7:45 am and 11:45 am. On the 5th day, all the rats were given access to the open CPP apparatus for 20\u00a0min (of which the first 15\u00a0min were for CPP analysis) to examine place preference and USVs response. The training sessions (conditioning) and the testing were performed at the same time of day. The CPP was calculated as the difference between the times spent in the drug-paired compartment during the test and pre-test [44, 45].\n1 3\n50\u2011kHz USV recording\nThe USVs were recorded during the CPP test session. The USVs were recorded with a single CM16 condenser microphone (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) placed face down 35\u00a0cm above the testing box floor and centrally above the rat-accessible area. The microphone was sensitive to frequencies of 15\u2013180\u00a0kHz, had a flat response characteristic (\u00b1 6\u00a0dB) within the 25\u2013140\u00a0kHz frequency range and was connected to a custom-made amplifier of 600 \u03a9 input impedance, 16 v/v (12\u00a0dB) voltage gain, and \u00b1 0.1\u00a0dB (30\u00a0Hz\u2013100\u00a0kHz) frequency response. The amplified signal was passed to an adjacent (observer-occupied) room, processed with a custom-made antialiasing filter, and then sent to a PC equipped with a model PCI-703-16A (Eagle Technology, Eagle River, WI, USA) acquisition board (14-bit, 400\u00a0kHz) and custom-written software (Rat-Rec Pro 5.0), as previously described [45]. The sound proofing method was validated [45, 46]. The recorded data were processed using the RAT-REC PRO 5.0 software (custom-made, Warsaw, Poland) and displayed as colour spectrograms. We did not observe the 22-kHz calls. Frequency-modulated (FM) and non-FM (\u2018flat\u2019) 50-kHz calls were identified using the characteristics specified in earlier studies by an independent observer. Each 50-kHz signal was manually marked by the section label to be included in the automatic calls\u2019 counting [44\u201346]."

Specifically, we observed a decrease in corticosterone and CART 55\u2013102 levels, and an increase in \u03b2-endorphin and POMC levels in the plasma of the CB rats, along with an increase in the mRNA for D2R, but a decrease in the mRNA levels for OX1R, KOR, and CART55-102 in the PFC. We also found an increase in the miRNA-124 level in the PFC of the CB rats.\nAt the beginning of the withdrawal period that followed cocaine binge, we observed enhanced anxiety-like behavior\nin the CB rats, similarly to other studies [49, 50]. Also in human cocaine abusers, discontinuation of drug intake usually produces a variety of adverse withdrawal symptoms among which anxiety and depression-related behaviors are prevailing during the initial period of abstinence [36]. Moreover, the CB rats showed a weaker place preference following cocaine\u2019s 7\u00a0day withdrawal period, most possibly because of an increase in reward threshold [51]. In other studies, the rewarding effect of cocaine was reported to have been restored 14\u00a0days after cocaine withdrawal [38]. The sensitization process is observed in the early period of cocaine use, while tolerance appears over time\n1 3\nof administration, phenomena established in both rodents and humans [52, 53]. Although it is a passive paradigm of cocaine administration compared to self-administration, the escalating dose regimen seems to at least partly mimic the cocaine binge, namely, the increase in cocaine intake. The studies of Calipari et\u00a0al. [54, 55] regarding differences in dopamine signaling in different patterns of cocaine selfadministration, suggest that tolerance depends not on the pattern of administration, but on the total cocaine intake within sessions. Similar patterns of behavior were demonstrated in our previous study regarding amphetamine selfadministration [56].\nIn our study, we observed lower corticosterone concentration accompanied by an increase in POMC and \u03b2-endorphin levels in the plasma of the CB rats. The escalating-dose cocaine administration has been proved to lead to dysregulation of the HPA axis [57\u201359]. An increase in plasma corticosterone level was observed at the beginning of the chronic binge cocaine administration, while it was reduced on the 14th day of the applied regimen followed by a return to its basal level after 10\u00a0days of the withdrawal period [57]. In the study by Garc\u00eda-Fuster et\u00a0al. [59] corticosterone levels progressively decreased during the course of withdrawal from extended daily access of cocaine\nA B\n1 3\nself-administration, and normalized following 28\u00a0days of withdrawal. An enhanced secretion of corticotropinreleasing factor (CRF) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and decreased cortisol levels were observed during the withdrawal period in humans and linked to depression and anxiety symptoms [60, 61]. Here, we can assume that lower corticosterone level may be the result of dysregulation of the HPA axis activity in response to cocaine binge and be related to the diminished cocaine-associated appetitive response after the withdrawal period.\nPOMC is synthesized in the pituitary gland in the brain and in several peripheral tissues. During posttranslational processing, it can be tissue-specifically cleaved to hormones and neuropeptides with very different biological activities [62]. In the anterior pituitary, POMC is processed predominantly to ACTH, \u03b2-lipotropin (\u03b2-LPH), and to \u03b2-endorphin to a lesser extent [62]. In the study by Zhou and Kreek [63], the increased hypothalamic POMC expression was persistent during the withdrawal period along with an increase in \u03b2-endorphin biosynthesis and release, which authors associated with enhanced cocaine seeking. However, continuously increased levels of \u03b2-endorphin in plasma were reported not only in abstinent human cocaine addicts, but also during cocaine binges [64]. Except for the postulated role of \u03b2-endorphin in mediating the rewarding or reinforcing effects of cocaine, it is also known to be released in response to physical stress [65, 66]. In normal human subjects a decline in ACTH and cortisol plasma levels was associated with elevated \u03b2-endorphin, which suggests feedback loop inhibition of pituitary ACTH\nrelease or suppression of hypothalamic CRF release by \u03b2-endorphin [67]. This observation may also partially explain our results, namely lower corticosterone concentrations along with an increase in \u03b2-endorphin and POMC levels in the plasma of the CB rats. However, in the current experimental design, it is difficult to assess to what extent effects of these two processes, namely cocaine withdrawal and cocaine re-exposure, may somehow overlap.\nCART 55\u2013102 is known for its properties to modulate the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway and to affect reward-seeking behavior [68, 69]. Furthermore, compelling evidence has shown that CART 55\u2013102 is involved in the HPA axis regulation associated with stress response [70\u201375]. CART 55\u2013102 stimulates CRF and glucocorticoid secretion, whereas CRF and glucocorticoids increase the transcriptional activity of the CART gene [76\u201378]. The administration of CART 55\u2013102 upregulates ACTH and corticosterone levels through a CRF-dependent mechanism [73, 74]. In light of these data, decreased CART 55\u2013102 levels in plasma and corresponding decreased CART 55\u2013102 mRNA levels in the PFC may be linked to the HPA axis dysregulation and diminished cocaine-associated appetitive response. In the study of Rakovska et\u00a0al. [69], CART 55\u2013102 administration was associated with a decrease in dopamine in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) and attenuation of cocaine-induced effects on dopamine release.\nDrug-withdrawal after chronic cocaine administration decreases dopamine signaling, in contrast to the positive reinforcement induced by the substance [51]. Diminished dopaminergic signaling after repeated cocaine intake may\nA B\n1 3\nincrease the risk of anxiety and dysphoria and lead to depressive-like behavior [79\u201381]. In our experiment, we detected a rise in the D2R mRNA in the PFC of the CB rats, similar to the study by Frankowska et\u00a0al. [82], which presents an increased D2R expression in the PFC in the withdrawal period after cocaine self-administration. These phenomena may reflect adaptive changes in D2R expression in the cortex (probably following lower dopamine levels in the corticallimbic system after exposure to the binge cocaine paradigm and withdrawal), and can be associated with lower appetitive response to cocaine [31].\nThe modulatory control of the dynorphin/KOR system over dopamine signaling in mesolimbic areas contributes to the development of negative affective states and changes in the perception of reinforcing and aversive stimuli [83]. Chronic cocaine exposure elevates the neuropeptide dynorphin levels, an endogenous ligand at KOR that suppresses dopamine release in the NAc and elicits negative affective states upon drug withdrawal [84\u201387]. Infusion of a KOR agonist into the PFC decreased dopamine levels in wildtype mice but not in KOR-knock-out mice (a model of a specific deletion of KOR in dopaminergic neurons), confirming KOR-mediated control of dopaminergic transmission in the PFC [88].\nIn our study, we observed a decrease in the KOR mRNA in the PFC of the CB rats. Although we are aware of some limitations of this study, namely changes in the level of transcripts were not confirmed at the protein level, we suggest that the reduced KOR mRNA may be associated with the lower appetitive response to cocaine-associated context. This speculation is supported by the study by Wee et\u00a0al. [89] on the effects of KOR blockade on cocaine seeking and consumption in different animal models of cocaine exposure. The KOR blockade selectively reduced cocaine seeking but not cocaine consumption in animals with a history of extended cocaine administration, but not in animals that self-administered it on a short access procedure [89]. These data link the decreased KOR function with lower appetitive response upon withdrawal from chronic cocaine exposure.\nIn the current study, we also observed a decrease in the OX1R mRNA in the PFC of the CB rats. Orexin neurons, localized mainly in the lateral hypothalamus and projecting through the cortex and limbic system, initiate arousal states and modulate reward system activity [90]. Much evidence supports the important role of OX1R in the prelimbic cortex in addiction-related states [10, 14, 22, 24, 91\u201393], specifically, the significance of signaling at OX1R in relapse to cocaine-seeking [94]. The OX1R gene was induced in the PFC by cocaine exposure [95]. Systemic administration of OX1R antagonist attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking [96], but did not attenuate reinstatement of responding induced by a priming injection of cocaine [97]. In animals that underwent abstinence from\nchronic self-administration, the OX1R antagonism reduced the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking [98]. Based on those data, we can assume that lower OX1R mRNA levels in the PFC may be related to lower appetitive response to cocaineassociated context and decreased cortical activity following the withdrawal period.\nRepeated intake of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, promotes alterations in gene expression that underlie addictionrelated processes [99\u2013101]. Several studies have shown that cocaine can influence the activity of small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, known to regulate gene expression on posttranscriptional level [102\u2013104]. Among them, miRNA-124 is considered as a promising biomarker of cocaine abuse as it was down-regulated in a dopaminergic neuron-like model after acute cocaine exposure [105], and found elevated in the blood of cocaine-addicted women during the withdrawal period [106]. In our study, the CB rats that presented lower appetitive vocalization in the cocaine-associated context after the withdrawal period showed also an increased miRNA-124 level in the PFC. Chandrasekar et\u00a0al. [107] found that lentiviral vector (LV)-miRNA-124 expression in the NAc attenuated cocaine CPP, whereas silencing miRNAs by corresponding LV-miRNA silencers inversed this effect. We are aware of the pleiotropic effects of miRNAs as they can target many different molecular pathways in cell- and tissue-specific manner, thus further research is needed to confirm the targets of these miRNAs in this context. So far, other studies identified PARP-1 [108] and BDNF [109] as plausible direct targets of miRNA-124 in neuronal cells.\nAnother promising marker of diseases associated with dopaminergic dysfunction is miRNA-137, which regulates DAT expression at the post-transcriptional level [40]. Addiction-prone rats showed elevated miRNA-137 expression in the CNS after extinction and relapse testing following cocaine self-administration [41]. However, we observed no differences in miRNA-137 between the CB and control rats in our study."

This behavioral pattern was accompanied by dysregulation of the HPA axis activity followed by changes in related neuromodulators in the plasma, and alterations in mRNA levels for D2, KOR, OX1R, CART 55\u2013120, and miRNA-124, a postulated marker of cocaine abuse, in the PFC. Our observations are in line to a large extent with results of other studies, thereby confirming the impact of cocaine on the HPA axis activity and systems that mediate\n1 3\nreinforcing effects of the drug and related affective states. To conclude, the obtained data reflect a part of a bigger picture of a multilevel interplay between neurotransmitter systems and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression underlying processes associated with cocaine abuse. However, indepth characteristics of molecular processes in this model require more detailed \u201ccause-and-effect\u201d exploration."
