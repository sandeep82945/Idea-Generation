    "abstractText": "Pancreatic cancer is a common malignancy of the digestive system. With a high degree of malignancy and poor prognosis, it is called the \u201cking of cancers.\u201d Currently, Western medicine treats pancreatic cancer mainly by surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, the curative effect is not satisfactory. The application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the treatment of pancreatic cancer has many advantages and is becoming an important facet of comprehensive clinical treatment. In this paper, we review current therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer. We also review the protective effects shown by TCM in different models and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms of these.",

With a high degree of malignancy and poor prognosis, it is called the \u201cking of cancers.\u201d Currently, Western medicine treats pancreatic cancer mainly by surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, the curative effect is not satisfactory. The application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the treatment of pancreatic cancer has many advantages and is becoming an important facet of comprehensive clinical treatment. In this paper, we review current therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer. We also review the protective effects shown by TCM in different models and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms of these.\nKEYWORDS\npancreatic cancer, traditional Chinese medicine, apoptosis, metastasis, therapy\n1 Introduction\nPancreatic cancer is a common malignancy of the digestive system. About 90% of pancreatic cancers are adenocarcinomas. This cancer occurs mainly in older men, aged between 40 and 85 years. Both the incidence rate and mortality of pancreatic cancer are increasing and it estimated that by 2030, it will become the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths (Dhasmana et al., 2023). The cancer always starts insidiously; as a result, patients are often in advanced stages when they are diagnosed, leading to poor 5-year survival rates of 2\u20139% (McGuigan et al., 2018). In China, the incidence of pancreatic cancer has increased approximately six-fold in the past 20 years (Shen and Liu, 2009). The development of pancreatic cancer is associated with many factors, including diet and environmental factors, such as vitamin D exposure (Altieri et al., 2017). Chronic pancreatitis resulting from alcohol consumption is also a probable risk factor. Long-term diabetes can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer while also being an early sign of the disease (Klein, 2021). Age and smoking have been recognized as consistent risk factors (Sellam et al., 2015). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has regarded pancreatic cancer as \u201cfu liang,\u201d \u201cwan tong,\u201d \u201cjaundice,\u201d and \u201caccumulation,\u201d amongst other classifications. Pancreatic cancer is known as the \u201cking of cancers\u201d due to its high degree of malignancy, high rate of recurrence, metastasis, and poor prognosis. The mortality of pancreatic cancer is thus almost equal to its incidence (Zhang et al., 2020).\nThe specific mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer are poorly understood. Several mutations are reported to be involved, including mutations in Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS), Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A"

According to TCM, Qi stagnation and depression of spleen dampness are the main pathogenic factors, with an excess of \u201cdampness, heat, and toxicity\u201d playing a critical role in the onset of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer has also been associated with liver and gallbladder dysfunction, leading to fluctuations in the functional activity of Qi, and an imbalance between Yin and Yang. This is followed by specific pathological changes in the zang-fu organs, leading to the abnormal secretion and excretion of pancreatic juice, resulting in stagnation and poor eating habits, and ultimately leading to cancer (Deng et al., 2014; Li and Fan, 2016; Wang, L.J., et al., 2016).Westernmedicine believes that mutations in multiple proto-oncogenes and either the inactivation or deletion of tumor suppressor genes are responsible for cancer development, causing faulty signal transduction and uncontrolled division and proliferation of cells, finally resulting in the formation of a tumor. At the same time, disorders of the internal environment and immune dysfunction contribute to cancer development.\nIn this review, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the keywords \u201cTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), pancreatic cancer, mechanism, therapy\u201d using Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) and searching the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).

            "text": "Currently, Western medicine treats pancreatic cancer mainly by surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. At present, surgical resection is the only possible cure but, as most patients are diagnosed in the middle and late stages, the best time for radical resection is usually missed. Even after surgery, the prognosis may be poor and postoperative recurrence and metastasis are common (Maisonneuve, 2019). Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment and is the most frequently used therapy for middle and advanced pancreatic cancer. However, although cancer cells scattered within tissues or organs can be killed to some extent, the effects of chemotherapy on pancreatic cancer are relatively poor and many researchers believe that pancreatic cancer is resistant to many chemotherapy drugs. In addition, chemotherapy drugs tend to have serious side effects. These factors can render chemotherapy relatively ineffective in treating this cancer. Pancreatic cancer is insensitive to radiotherapy, and, as it is a localized therapy, radiotherapy is not able to effectively control the spread and metastasis of the tumor and improve the patients\u2019 quality of life, so it is rarely used in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (Miller et al., 2020). The efficacy of immunotherapy and endocrine therapy is also uncertain (Zhang B et al., 2023). Drugs targeting molecular pathways are one of the research hotspots of tumor therapy, but the\ncombination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib and the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine, which has been recommended for treating pancreatic cancer, has not been found to significantly improve the quality of life of patients and increases the incidence of side effects such as rash and diarrhea (Schizas et al., 2020). Currently, more attention is being paid to methods of reducing the toxic side-effects of drugs, improving the patients\u2019 quality of life, and prolonging their survival. Many researchers have begun to study the effects of TCM on pancreatic cancer and have made great progress (He et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). TCM has many advantages and is being recognized as an indispensable and important facet of comprehensive clinical treatment (Li, B., et al., 2015).\nTCM is a medicinal system that has been used for over 2000 years in China, as well as having broad use in other Asian countries. There is currently widespread research into TCM and it has inspired many new discoveries in drug development. One of the basic theories in TCM is that of Yin-Yang balance, which is also applied as a philosophical term. Therein, Yin represents repressive and inhibitory factors while Yang stands for active and aggressive factors. The confrontation, homeostatic balance, and transformation between Yin and Yang comprise the Yin-Yang balance (Yan et al., 2020). Another basic tenet of TCM is the theory of Qi-blood balance. Qi describes the life-force energy and is carried throughout the body via meridians, acting as the conduits of the body energy. Blood represents the source of body energy (Wang et al., 2018). In TCM theory, disturbances in the Yin-Yang balance or Qi deficiency and blood stasis are the underlying causes of disease.\nThe unique concepts and theoretical foundations of TCM, combined with Western medicine, consider both the whole and the local, host and cancer, and symptoms and disease, with each drawing on the other\u2019s strengths to make up for shortcomings. TCM can not only control tumor development and prolong patient survival but can also improve the immunosuppressant status of the tumor host and reduce the toxic side effects of radiation and chemotherapy, as well as having synergistic effects on other therapies, relieving patients\u2019 pain, and improving their quality of life. Therefore, the study of the treatment of pancreatic cancer with TCM has the potential to provide broader ideas and methods for clinical practice (Li, B., et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010). Some researchers have suggested that Traditional Chinese and Western medicine should be integrated in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed surgically (Yang et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2019). At the beginning of treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, supplemented by TCM, should be the main treatment methods, acting as the \u201cfirst attack\u201d on the tumor cells, followed by long-term maintenance treatment with TCM, which can delay the progression of the tumor and improve the long-term survival rate of the patients (Schizas et al., 2020)."

The QYHJ herbal decoction reduces heat and resolves toxicity, regulating the Qi and dispelling dampness, and can stabilize the focus and inhibit the spread of the tumor. Song LB et al. reviewed 232 cases of postoperative pancreatic cancer patients treated with QYHJ combined withWesternmedicine and found that taking QYHJ for more than 3 months could prolong postoperative survival and improve long-term survival (Song et al., 2018). It was found the levels of cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8), were significantly increased in the sera of pancreatic cancer patients. One of the mechanisms responsible for the effects of QYHJ in the treatment of pancreatic cancer may be to downregulate the levels of\nTNF-\u03b1, sVCAM-1, TGF-\u03b21, IL\u20136, and IL-8 in the serum, together with inhibiting several signal transduction pathways, thus improving the immunity of patients and inhibiting the growth and metastasis of tumor cells (Ouyang et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that QYHJ can downregulate the expression of the Ski gene, restore the functions of Notch-4 and Jagged-1, and prolong the survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (Wang P et al., 2010; Xu Y L et al., 2015; Song et al., 2017). QYHJ can also reverse the drug resistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine, possibly through inhibiting the differentiation of pancreatic cancer stem cells through the lncRNA AB209630/miR-373/ EphB2 NANOG signaling pathway (Chen et al., 2019). Using network pharmacology and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found that CDK1, PLD1, MET, F2RL1, XDH, NEK2, TOP2A, NQO1, CCND1, PTK6, CTSE, and ERBB2 may be reliable immune-related biomarkers for the prediction of pancreatic cancer prognosis, and may be important immunotherapeutic targets of QYHJ (Qian et al., 2020)."

This method is based on \u201cZhao\u2019s fine-tuning balance theory\u201d established by the oncologist Zhao Jingfang who believes that the development of cancer is due to dysregulation of the body\u2019s internal environment, and dysfunction of the viscera, Yin and Yang, Qi, and blood disorders. To treat tumors, the key point of the imbalance should be determined, specifically, whether the spleen and stomach in the middle-jiao are dysfunctional, and make adjustments to restore the balance of the body to restore immune function, allowing control of the disease and improvement of the quality of life and long-term survival of patients.

This can not only inhibit tumor development but can also increase the efficacy of chemotherapy, reduce toxic side effects, improve the quality of life of patients, and prolong their lives. From the perspective of modern pharmacological mechanisms, WD-3 mainly regulates the functioning of the immune system and homeostasis in the body, inhibiting the growth and metastasis of the tumor by increasing the levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3 in the body and enhancing the function of immune cells. In addition, some components such as semen coicis can halt the cancer cell cycle in the G2/M phase, inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis of cancer cells (Ni et al., 2006; Ni et al., 2013a; Ni et al., 2013b; Xue et al., 2016).\n3.1.3 Phenolic alkaloids ofMenispermum dauricum (PAMD)\nPAMD is a mixture extracted from Menispermum dauricum, containing a variety of fat-soluble alkaloids and is mainly composed of dauricine (Dau) and daurisoline (DS) (Su et al., 2007). PAMD can inhibit tumor angiogenesis by downregulating the expression of VEGF and bFGF in tumor tissues of xenografts of the BxPC-3 human pancreatic cell line in nude mice, causing tumor cell necrosis, inhibiting tumor growth, and inducing a corresponding inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that PAMD can significantly inhibit the growth of tumors in BxPC-3 mice and enhance apoptosis of BxPC-3 cells by promoting the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 (Meng et al., 2010; Zhou Z.G et al., 2015). Relevant studies have shown that imbalances in or abnormal activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway are closely related to the occurrence of pancreatic cancer and its biological characteristics. PAMD may influence the expression of Gli1mRNA, a key molecule in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, inhibiting the proliferation of the BxPC-3 cells (Wei et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2019). PAMD can also regulate the body\u2019s immune function, improve the biological activity of cytokines, downregulate the expression of K-Ras mRNA, upregulate the expression of DPC4 mRNA, and activate the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and proliferation (Feng et al., 2010; Wang J M et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016)."

Emodin significantly inhibits the proliferation of pancreatic cancer SW1990 cells and induces apoptosis. Studies have found that emodin induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer through inhibiting the activity of NF-\u03baB, downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and survivin, and upregulating the expression of BAX, thus reducing the Bcl-2/ BAX ratio (Tong et al., 2020). In addition, emodin treatment resulted in the downregulation of NF-\u03baB, together with its regulatory factors VEGF and MMPs, as well as Survivin, inhibiting angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer, and thus inhibiting the growth and metastasis of the cancer. Emodin can also enhance the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine on SW1990 transplantation tumors, possibly by preventing the activation of Akt and NF-\u03baB in pancreatic cancer tissue, reducing the expression of Bcl-2, and upregulating the expression of BAX. The resultant decrease in the Bcl-2/BAX ratio reduced mitochondrial damage and increased the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane.

Pan et al. found that emodin combined with 5-Aza-CdR enhanced the demethylation of the tumor suppressor gene p16, RASSF1A, and ppENK by reducing the expression of the methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3a (Pan et al., 2016).

Its chemical properties are stable in vivo, and its titer is 100\u2013200 times higher than that of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. (TWHF). Triptolide has many biological activities, and its antitumor effect has been widely investigated in recent years (Mu et al., 2022). Triptolide shows broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity. Triptolide is known to inhibit the growth and proliferation of more than 60 types of tumor cells. This inhibitory effect may be achieved by blocking the cell cycle, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Triptolide is also effective for tumor cells that have already developed drug resistance and has a synergistic effect when combined with chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, and radiotherapy. It can not only reduce the occurrence of drug resistance but can also significantly enhance tumor cell apoptosis induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy and inhibit tumor cell proliferation (Zhang et al., 2017). Some of the anti-pancreatic cancer mechanisms of triptolide may be: \u2460Increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus damaging the cell\u2019s DNA and mitochondria and upregulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX and NF-\u03baB, which, in turn, downregulate the expression of Bcl-2, and increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane to induce apoptosis (Ma J X et al., 2019). \u2461HSP70 is a heat shock protein and chaperone, which can protect cells from oxidative stress and other damage.

In addition, Bufalin was found to enhance the killing efficacy of NK cells and to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response by driving tumor-infiltrating macrophage toward the M1 phenotype (Fu et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022)."

It has extensive pharmacological effects, including antiviral, antiinflammatory, anti-fibrosis, and anti-tumor activities (Xu et al., 2022). Matrine can play an anti-pancreatic cancer effect through various mechanisms: \u2460Inducing apoptosis by reducing the Bcl-2/ BAX ratio, upregulating Fas, and increasing activation of caspases8, -3 and -9, inhibiting mitochondrial energy production (Liu, T.Y., et al., 2010; Cho et al., 2018); \u2461Inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion through the ROS/NF-\u03baB/MMPs pathway (Huang and Xin, 2018); \u2462 Inhibiting HPAC cellular migration and invasion through down-regulating the expression of MT1MMP via the Wnt signaling pathway (Ma, Y.C., et al., 2015). Matine suppresses macrophage-mediated immunosuppression and subsequently upregulates CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activities (Zhuang et al., 2020).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08"

            "text": "In recent years, great progress has beenmade in the investigation of TCMs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. TCM shows unique advantages in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, not only by controlling tumor progression and prolonging the survival of patients, but also enhancing immunity, reducing the toxic side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, relieving pain, and improving the patient\u2019s quality of life. A review of the actions of TCM (Table 2) shows that these formulations act via different signaling mechanisms (Figure 2), leading to the inhibition of migration and metastasis and the promotion of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. However, TCM formulations function holistically, as each contains a number of ingredients, which presents a challenge for the establishment of quality control standards for the raw materials and the standardization of the final herbal drugs as no single component is directly responsible for the total\nFIGURE 2 TCM inhibition of signaling pathways involved in the EMT, migration, metastasis, and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. The schematic diagram shows the various TCM formulations involved in the inhibition of the nine key signaling processes as follows: \u2460 Via Hippo-YAP signaling, involving Scutellarin and Res;\u2461 Via JAK/STAT signaling, involving EMO, Curcumin, and Bufalin;\u2462 Via tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, involving EMO, Curcumin, and Res; \u2463 Via TGF -\u03b2 signaling, involving EMO and Curcumin; \u2464 Via Wnt/\u03b2 catenin signaling, involving Curcumin and matrine; \u2465 Via NF-\u03baB signaling, involving TPL, Curcumin, Ori, Res,DHA, Bufalin, and HCPT; \u2466 Via Notch signaling, involving EMO; \u2467 Via sonic hedgehog signaling, involving TPL, Curcumin, Res, and Bufalin; \u2468 Via Fas/Fasl signaling, involving EMO,TPL, Curcumin, Cinnamaldehyde, Ori, DHA, Bufalin, matrine, and HPCT.

The concept of TCM chemical fingerprints aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of these complex chemical matrices is one of the most convincing tools for the quality assessment of TCM. (Li, Y., et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022). Therefore, adequate clinical studies are required to confirm their clinical safety and efficacies."
