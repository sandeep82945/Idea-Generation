    "abstractText": "Geneticmodification of non\u2013b-cells to produce insulin is a promising therapeutic strategy for type 1 diabetes; however, it is associated with issues, including biosafety and precise regulation of insulin supply. In this study, a glucose-activated single-strand insulin analog (SIA) switch (GAIS) was constructed to achieve repeatable pulse activation of SIA secretion in response to hyperglycemia. In the GAIS system, the conditional aggregation domain\u2013 furin cleavage sequence\u2013SIA fusion protein was encoded by the intramuscularly delivered plasmid and temporarily kept in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) because it binds to the GRP78 protein; then, upon hyperglycemia, the SIAwas released and secreted into the blood. In vitro and in vivo experiments systematically demonstrated the effects of the GAIS system, including glucose-activated and repeatable SIA secretion, long-term precise blood glucose control, recovered HbA1c levels, improved glucose tolerance, and ameliorated oxidative stress. Additionally, this system offers sufficient biosafety, as evidenced by the assays of immunological and inflammatory safety, ER stress, and histological evaluation. Compared with the viral delivery/ expression system, the ex vivo implantation of engineered cells, and the exogenous inducer system, theGAIS system combines the advantages of biosafety, effectiveness, persistence, precision, and convenience, providing therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

In this study, a glucose-activated single-strand insulin analog (SIA) switch (GAIS) was constructed to achieve repeatable pulse activation of SIA secretion in response to hyperglycemia. In the GAIS system, the conditional aggregation domain\u2013 furin cleavage sequence\u2013SIA fusion protein was encoded by the intramuscularly delivered plasmid and temporarily kept in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) because it binds to the GRP78 protein; then, upon hyperglycemia, the SIAwas released and secreted into the blood. In vitro and in vivo experiments systematically demonstrated the effects of the GAIS system, including glucose-activated and repeatable SIA secretion, long-term precise blood glucose control, recovered HbA1c levels, improved glucose tolerance, and ameliorated oxidative stress. Additionally, this system offers sufficient biosafety, as evidenced by the assays of immunological and inflammatory safety, ER stress, and histological evaluation. Compared with the viral delivery/ expression system, the ex vivo implantation of engineered cells, and the exogenous inducer system, theGAIS system combines the advantages of biosafety, effectiveness, persistence, precision, and convenience, providing therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease characterized by the immune system\u2019s destruction of insulin producing pancreatic b-cells, resulting in insulin deficiency (1,2). Currently, 537 million people have diabetes globally. According to the International Diabetes Federation, this number will reach 783 million by 2045, an increase of 46% (3). Generally, T1D is managed via multiple daily injections, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or an insulin pump (4\u20136). However, because of fluctuations, it\nARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS\n\u2022 Weundertook this study to establish a glucose-responsive single-strand insulin analog (SIA) self-supply system in vivo. \u2022 We sought to determine whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can serve as a safe and temporary repository to store designed fusion proteins and release SIAs under hyperglycemic conditions for efficient blood glucose regulation. \u2022 The intramuscularly expressed plasmid-encoded conditional aggregation domain\u2013furin cleavage sequence\u2013SIA fusion protein can be temporarily stored in the ER, and the SIA can be released under the stimulation of hyperglycemia, resulting in efficient and long-term regulation of stable blood glucose in mice with type 1 diabetes (T1D). \u2022 The glucose-activated SIA switch system provides applicable potential for T1D therapy, integrating regulation and monitoring of blood glucose levels.\n1National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, College of Biomedical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China 2West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China 3Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Regulating Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Hospital of Chengdu University of TCM, Chengdu, Sichuan, China\nCorresponding author: Gang Wang, wgang@scu.edu.cn\nReceived 20 October 2022 and accepted 6 March 2023\nThis article contains supplementary material online at https://doi.org/10.2337/ figshare.22242679.\n\u00a9 2023 by the American Diabetes Association.

However, most exogenous signal-induced therapeutic systems have focus on transcriptional regulation in target cells, which usually causes a certain time lag between signal reception and insulin expression/secretion. Therefore, these systems have a risk of inducing postprandial hyperglycemia and subsequent hypoglycemia in the treatment of T1D. Compared with transcriptional regulation, direct regulation of insulin secretion can provide faster blood glucose regulation. Inducible secretion has been previously achieved by the accumulation (14) or conditional storage of insulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (15). These studies prove that gene therapy is an alternative way to supply exogenous insulin for the long-term precise control of T1D. However, these methods still have some limitations in clinical application, such as viral vector application, additional exogenous signal stimulation or bioelectronic device requirements, implantation and maintenance of engineered exogenous cells, and so on. Additionally, the integration of therapy and monitoring should be reasonably designed withminimal potential biosafety risks.\nIntramuscular plasmid-encoded functional protein expression has shown potential for the treatment of some diseases, such as cancers and diabetes; however, the gene delivery efficiency and the expression of plasmid-encoded protein were too low to generate efficient therapeutic results. In previous studies, we established high-efficiency intramuscular gene delivery/expression techniques with muscle specificity. On the basis of the aforementioned techniques, prolonged control of T1D was acquired by single intramuscular injection of the plasmid-encoding mouse single-strand insulin analog (SIA). However, the sustained and uncontrolled expression of the SIA can induce hypoglycemia and is unable to treat clinical T1D cases. In this study, to obtain SIAs with high and improved efficiency to synthesize insulin, we introduced a series of flexible peptides to replace proinsulin C-peptide. The biological function of this system was verified by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. On the basis of intramuscular gene delivery and expression techniques, this study aimed to establish a glucose-activated SIA switch (GAIS) supply, achieving safety and efficiency in T1D treatment."

Competitive binding assays were performed to assess the binding affinities of the SIAs to the human IR. Notably, SIA-A1, -A2, and -B2 were as effective as natural insulin in receptor binding, suggesting the SIAs had biological functions similar to those of insulin (Fig. 1B). SIA-A2 was equipotent to native insulin, and SIA-A1, -B1, and -B2 were five- to 10-fold more potent in promoting glucose uptake at 10 nmol/L, despite their equal affinity to IR (Fig. 1C). Additionally, these four SIAs and insulin showed no difference in cell proliferation assays, suggesting that malignant proliferation by SIAs could be ignored (Fig. 1D).\nIn Vivo Assays To investigate the therapeutic effects of SIAs on STZinduced T1D, we divided mice into six groups based on the plasmid they received (100 mg per mouse). Fasting blood glucose levels of mice receiving pSC-SIA-A1, -A2, or -B2 were significantly decreased during 9\u201333 days, whereas blood SIA expression persisted for 30 days (Fig. 1E and F). However, pSC-SIA-A1\u2013 and -B2\u2013treated mice did show hypoglycemia and even death (data not shown), suggesting that a sustained supply of an SIA was not safe enough. On the 14th day after gene therapy, mice were fasted for 16 h, after which an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed. Because mice with diabetes did not clear blood glucose, pSC-SIA-A1\u2013,-A2\u2013, and -B2\u2013injected mice with diabetes displayed improved glucose tolerance, especially those treated with pSC-SIA-A1 or -B2 (Fig. 1G and H). From the 15th day, body weights of pSC-SIA-A1\u2013 and -A2\u2013 and especially -B2\u2013treated mice were heavier than those of pSC-treated mice and mice with diabetes (Fig. 1I). Collectively, these results demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of pSC-SIA, especially pSC-SIA-B2, in reducing blood glucose levels and improving blood glucose metabolism. SIA-B2 was used in the subsequent studies and abbreviated as SIA. However, hypoglycemia caused by persistent strong expression of SIA needs to be further solved."

The CAD can interact with GRP78 (20,21), an ER protein with ATPase activity (3,22), in a ligand-reversiblemanner. The fusion protein CADFCS-SIAs were transiently retained in the ER via CAD-GRP78 interaction. The affinity between GRP78 and the CADmay be changed under different ATP-to-ADP ratios, resulting in the retention of CAD-FCS-SIAs within the ER during hypoglycemia (low ATP-to-ADP ratio) and dissociation of CAD-FCSSIAs from GRP78 under hyperglycemic conditions (increased ATP-to-ADP ratio). Subsequently, CAD-FCS-SIAs were transferred to the Golgi apparatus; there, the CAD was removed by the furin protease at the FCS site, generating the SIAwith biological activity. Therefore, in the GAIS system, the ER served\nas the storage depot for CAD-FCS-SIAs, which were then cleaved by the furin protease in the Golgi apparatus and released and secreted into the blood (Fig. 2A)."

Meanwhile, the SIA signals (in the CAD-FCS-SIA fusion protein) were extremely strong in the ER during the hypoglycemic state and were significantly reduced during the hyperglycemic state (Fig. 2B). The results showed that the CAD-FCS-SIA fusion proteins expressed by the GAIS system were temporarily kept in the ER in low glucose conditions but were released and secreted from the ER in high glucose conditions. In comparison, the signal intensity of the pSCSIA\u2013encoded SIA did not show any change during increased glucose concentrations. In addition to the colocalization analysis, the immunoprecipitation (IP) assay further proved the binding of CAD-FCS-SIA to GRP78 (Fig. 2C). In the IP products precipitated by the anti-GRP78 antibody from the lysates of pLVX-GAIS\u2013infected C2C12 cells, GRP78-CAD-FCS-SIA was detected. This band was also detected in the cell lysates. The results confirmed the binding of CAD-FCS-SIA to GRP78. The hypothesis that the ER acted as a storage depot for proteins was confirmed after C2C12 cells expressing the fusion protein were treated with 2.5 mmol/L glucose for 24 h, and the fusion protein was precipitated by co-IP using antibodies against GRP78. Collectively, these results confirmed that the ER can serve as a temporary repository for the CAD-FCS-SIA fusion protein because of its binding to GRP78 and that it is released fromGRP78 upon high glucose stimulation.\nGlucose-Activated Expression of the Reporter Gene in the GAIS System In GAIS-transfected C2C12 cells, glucose treatment resulted in a dose-dependent response across the concentration range from 0 to 15mmol/L (Fig. 2D). The SEAP reporter gene level reached its peak within 150 min after glucose stimulation (Fig. 2E). Because the transcription-based SEAP expression peak usually appears at 7 h (13), the secretory regulationbased GAIS system had a faster response to blood glucose. In addition, the SEAP expression induced by hyperglycemia in vivo also showed a significant increase at 2.5 h in mice with T1D (Fig. 2F)."

In comparison, the GAIS system significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels from the 6th day and kept them in the normal range from the 12th to the 60th day. pSC-SIA also significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels from the 9th day; however, it caused fluctuations in blood glucose levels within the following days (Fig. 4C). We also detected the random blood glucose of mice. Due to variations in feeding patterns among individual mice, nonfasting glucose levels demonstrated significant fluctuations. However, mice treated with GAIS and pSC-SIA exhibited significantly lower nonfasting glucose levels compared with those in the T1D group (data not shown). In this study, both the GAIS and pSC-SIA treatments successfully restored HbA1c levels to normal, suggesting the successful control of serum glucose in the 2-month treatment period with two injections administered on days 0 and 30 (Fig. 4D). GTTs performed on days 18, 30, 57 (Fig. 4E\u2013J), 39, and 48 (Supplementary Fig. 4) further indicated the partially recovered ability to metabolize postprandial blood glucose after gene therapy. Although both the GAIS and pSC-SIA treatments reduced blood glucose levels in the IPGTT assays, the GAIS system more effectively dealt with postprandial blood glucose on days 18, 39, and 48 compared with WT mice and mice with T1D (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. 4A and C). On the day-18 IPGTT assay, the blood glucose values in the GAIS-treated mice at 90- and 120-min test points were similar to those in WT mice (P > 0.05) (Fig. 4E). Even on the 57th day, GAIS treatment in mice with T1D was able to stimulate the serum SIA by glucose administration (Fig. 4K). The IPGTTs on days 18, 39, and 48 were more effective than those on days 30 and 57 (Fig. 4E\u2013J and Supplementary Fig. 4), which may have been due to the gradual degradation of the plasmid, resulting in a diminished therapeutic effect, and therefore, in\nD ow nloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article-pdf/72/6/703/703503/db220860.pdf by guest on 13 January 2024\norder to maintain the long-term therapeutic effect, plasmids should be administered at appropriate intervals. Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss are the typical manifestations of T1D (17). Mice with STZ-induced diabetes continued to lose weight, whereas GAIS and pSC-SIA administrations prevented the continuous loss of body weight from the 12th day (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Polydipsia and polyphagia were ameliorated in the treatment groups compared with in the diabetes group, but these results were still inferior to those in the WT group (Supplementary Fig. 3B and C). Collectively, in vivo studies demonstrated that the GAIS system could imitate the natural and physiological response to glucose stimuli and secrete the SIA in time."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Regulating therapeutic protein expression can provide a new perspective on control of hormone release, tumor immunotherapy, and homeostasis regulation (26,27). Currently, treatments are focused on regulating transcriptional levels, a relatively slow method for producing therapeutic proteins. To bypass gene transcription, we designed a system to regulate the secretion of proteins. The GAIS system has a faster response than transcriptional switches and has the characteristics of high sensitivity, dose dependence, and reversibility. In the mice with T1D, the treated group showed faster blood glucose clearance. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the GAIS system realized the integration of therapy and monitoring, overcoming poor compliance with insulin injection and thereby achieving long-term blood glucose control. This study also revealed that the GAIS system can achieve rapid coupling of glucose sensing with the release of therapeutic proteins.\nT1D is associated with the loss of b-cells expressing insulin; however, as an alternative, other cells can be used as a new source of insulin (15,28\u201331). The liver is a target organ of insulin and has glucose sensors (32\u201334), but it lacks prohormone invertase and regulatory secretion pathways. Neuroendocrine cells have a regulatory secretory pathway but lack a glucose-sensing mechanism (35). Intestinal epithelial cells express GK, GLUT2, and prohormone invertase, but considering the rapid renewal and complex operation, the potential of K cells as targeted cells is still limited (36\u201339). Skeletal muscles are widely distributed, have slow turnover and extensive vascularization, can secrete therapeutic proteins into the systemic circulation to treat multiple human diseases (40\u201343), and are easy to operate with lower risk. Moreover, as nonislet b-cells, they are not attacked by the immune system (44,45). The precursor of\ninsulin consists of A, B, and C chains, and the C-peptide is cut off by the prohormone invertase in the Golgi to form mature insulin (46). However, prohormone invertase is mainly expressed in b-cells. In this study, the first step was to design and screen appropriate linkers to substitute for C-peptide. Meanwhile, insulin gene therapy requires an effective gene delivery method to the skeletal muscle cells. Both viral and nonviral vectors have been tested for the treatment of diabetes, and viral vectors undoubtedly have superior delivery efficiency (47). Adeno-associated viral vectors have been considered the most promising vectors for gene therapy; however, it has been reported that some of the therapeutic gene fragments they carry can integrate into a dog\u2019s chromosomes, potentially causing cancer (48). Plasmids can overcome this shortcoming but have lower transfection efficiency. To develop an efficient and safe skeletal muscle delivery system, we used the L/E/G technique to transfer the GAIS system to skeletal muscle (18).\nInducible trafficking was previously achieved by oral administration, biotin release ER-resident hook (49), and light-triggered release (50), but these require additional external signal stimulations. Unfortunately, it is difficult to adjust signal strength to control hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The release of SIAs in this study was slightly delayed compared with that observed in the physiological state, and the glucose tolerance was lower than that of normal mice. The reason may be that SIAs need to be transported from the ER to the Golgi, where they are treated by furin, and then further transported to the plasma membrane. To further shorten the time from stimulation to release, an SIA can be selectively stored near the cell membrane. In summary, in this investigation, we designed a GAIS system to enable spontaneous blood glucose regulation of SIA release expressed in\nD ow nloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article-pdf/72/6/703/703503/db220860.pdf by guest on 13 January 2024\nskeletal muscle cells. Using a reversible combination of CAD motif and GRP78 can effectively and rapidly control blood glucose in mice with diabetes for a long time. Subsequent studies may combine the secretory regulatory GAIS system with current widely used transcriptional switches to form a compatible system and then integrate this system into genomic safe sites using CRISPR-Cas9 to achieve permanent treatment of diabetes. The integration of the GAIS system and compatible transcription system can also achieve a variety of signals and levels to regulate the expression of therapeutic proteins and design complex biological gate circuits. This system can be beneficial for controlling molecular mechanisms, drug expression, and synthetic biology in the future. In addition to being used for diabetes, the GAIS system\u2013mediated smart production factory platform can be used to express and secrete a variety of therapeutic proteins/peptides for the treatment of different diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, severe osteoporosis, and immunotherapy of tumors, thus achieving long-term, accurate, and controlled protein/peptide drug delivery.\nFunding.
