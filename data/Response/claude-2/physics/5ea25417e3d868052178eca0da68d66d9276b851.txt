 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate the exact mechanism of how changing the P1' site to phenylalanine (F) enhances the expression level of the antimicrobial peptide NZ2114 in Pichia pastoris. This could involve structural studies on the mutant pro-signal peptide and how it impacts secretion. 

2. Further optimize the P1' site by testing additional amino acid substitutions beyond the 20 already tested to see if the expression yield can be improved even more. Rational design based on the mechanism from idea 1 could help select promising candidates.

3. Explore combining the optimized P1' site with other strategies like codon optimization, promoter engineering, etc. to maximize the expression level of NZ2114 and related antimicrobial peptides.

4. Study the impact of the P1' site change on the antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of NZ2114. While activity was reduced somewhat, there may be ways to counteract this through additional modifications. 

5. Test the clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics of lead candidate FNZ in animal models of bacterial infection compared to the parental peptide. This could provide support for eventual human clinical trials.
