 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop methods to couple geometry, dynamics, and energetics calculations to get a more holistic understanding of viral structures. For example, use normal mode analysis to generate multiple conformations of a viral protein, then analyze binding sites and energetics on each conformation. 

2. Apply the methods discussed to other virus families beyond flaviviruses, such as coronaviruses, to see if they provide useful insights. Expand the structural database analyzed.

3. Incorporate machine learning techniques like AlphaFold to predict structures of viral proteins with unknown experimental structures, then analyze using these methods. Could help expand targets for drug design.

4. Develop computational methods to identify cryptic binding sites that are only revealed upon conformational changes in viral proteins. Requires going beyond static structure analysis. 

5. Build multiscale models that couple coarse-grained normal mode analysis with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to enable analyzing dynamics of even larger viral assemblies like whole virions.
