    "abstractText": "Creating new insecticide lead compounds based on the design and modification of natural products is a novel process, of which chlorfenapyr is a typical successful example. Chlorfenapyr is an arylpyrrole derivative that has high biological activity, a wide insecticidal spectrum, and a unique mode of action. For decades, a series of chlorfenapyr derivatives were designed and synthesized continuously, of which many highly active insecticidal compounds were discovered sequentially. However, due to the widespread application of chlorfenapyr and its degradation properties, some adverse effects, including pest resistance and environmental toxicity, occurred. In this review, a brief history of the discovery and development of chlorfenapyr is first introduced. Then, the synthesis, structural modification, structure activity relationship, and action mechanism of arylpyrroles are summarized. However, challenges and limitations still exist, especially in regard to the connection with pest resistance and environmental toxicology, which is discussed at the end of this review. This comprehensive summary of chlorfenapyr further promotes its progress and sensible application for pest management.",

Introduction\nFor centuries, there has been a critical need for the discovery of new insecticides to control pests and protect the expanding global food population [1\u20137]. Resource-rich plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. from the earth provide abundant natural products that could be potential insecticidal candidates. Over the past 60 years, natural products have played a central role in the development of new active ingredients for crop protection [8\u201312]. Among these numerous instances, chlorfenapyr, which was ultimately commercially produced, is a typical successful case [12]. In the early 1980s, the American Cyanamid Company (ACC) discovered that the antibiotic dioxopyrrolamycin had broad-spectrum insecticidal and acaricidal activity. But it also had the disadvantages of poor stability and high toxicity. Hence, the researchers further modified the structure of dioxopyrrolamycin and obtained a series of analogs, of which the 2-arylpyrrole analogs were found to have excellent activity. Additionally, through further structure activity relationship research, the widely used commercial insecticide and acaricide, chlorfenapyr, was developed [2]. Chlorfenapyr (4-bromo-2-(4chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1h-pyrrol-3-carbonitrile) belongs to the group of heterocyclic compounds. Epoch-making heterocyclic drugs, such as pyrazoles, pyridines, imidazoles, and pyrroles, have emerged and gradually attracted the attention of researchers, and they also have become hot spots in the field of insecticide research. Recently, heterocyclic pesticides of natural origin, represented by nicotine [13],\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227673 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 2 of 18\nrotenone [14,15], saxitoxin [16], and physostigmine, and chemically synthesized heterocyclic pesticides, such as fipronil, fenpyroximate, tebufenpyrad, pyrazinone, etoxazole, and chlorfenapyr, have been discovered and developed one after another [17]. Because of their novel structure, unique mechanism of action, high biological activity, and low resistance, these pesticides have gradually replaced the traditional, highly toxic organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides and have become important insecticides and acaricides. Chlorfenapyr is highly efficient and possesses broad-spectrum activity. It was found that chlorfenapyr can effectively control Plutella xylostella, Spodoptera exigua, Mamestra brassicoe, Pieris rapae, Hellula undalis Fabricius, Lipaphis erysimi, Tetranychid mites, Frankliniella occidentalis, and other major vegetable, fruit tree, and cotton pests [18\u201321]. Meanwhile, it is effectively against horticultural plant pests, such as Aleyrodiae, Liriomyza, and Altica Goeffroy as well. In particular, chlorfenapyr shows low interactive resistance to carbamate, organophosphorus, and pyrethroid insecticides. Chlorfenapyr is thought to act as an uncoupler in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It obstructs the conversion of ADP to ATP, leading to an energy metabolism disorder that ultimately causes insect death [22]. Thus, chlorfenapyr is considered an efficient, low-toxicity, target-specific, and environmentally friendly pesticide. In the quest to find more efficient and broad-spectrum compounds, numerous chlorfenapyr backbone-based compounds have been designed and synthesized, and many promising compounds have been obtained [23]. However, due to the widespread application of chlorfenapyr and its degradation properties, some adverse effects, including pest resistance and environmental toxicity, occurred [24]. Chlorfenapyr residues in the environment and their toxic effects on non-target organisms have also raised concerns regarding the need for the development of its hazard evaluation. In this review, a brief history of the discovery and development of chlorfenapyr is first introduced. Then, the synthesis, structural modification, structure activity relationship, and action mechanism of chlorfenapyr derivatives are summarized. The connection to pest resistance and environmental toxicology is discussed at the end. This comprehensive summary of chlorfenapyr further promotes its progress and sensible application for pest management."

In the 1960s, pyrrolnitrin (1), which contains a pyrrole ring and which originated from Pseudomonas pyrrocinia, was detected as possessing good antibacterial activity [25]. With pyrrolnitrin acting as the lead compound, the arylpyrrolic fungicides fenpicloni (2) and fludioxonil (3) were consequently discovered [26]. After that, a series of arylpyrrole antibiotics from a variety of microbial metabolites, namely pyrolomycin A, B, C, D, E, F (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and pyoluteorin (10) [2,26,27], were detected. In 1987, researchers at the ACC isolated a strain of Streptomyces fumanus from soil collected in Oklahoma, USA. From the multitudinous metabolites of the microorganism, dioxapyrrolomycin was isolated and detected to have insecticidal activity [28]. Almost at the same time, two research groups from Meiji Seika and the SS Pharmaceutical company found the same metabolites from S. fumanus to have good bactericidal activity [29]. Dioxapyrrolomycin (11) was found to have good acaricidal activity and moderate insecticidal activity (Table 1). However, it showed extremely high toxicity in mice, as the oral toxicity LD50 value of dioxapyrrolomycin in mice was 14 mg/kg (body weight). In spite of this, the simple structure and insecticidal potential of dioxapyrrolomycin still attracted much attention from researchers [29]. Hence, a large number of derivatives of dioxapyrrolomycin were synthesized and tested to determine their activity. Among them, 12 and 13 were found to have excellent insecticidal activity, while 13 causes intolerable plant phytotoxicity due to it acting as the blocker of oxidative phosphorylation. It not only damages the mitochondria of insects but also affects plant chloroplasts. Through further research by the ACC, the precursor compound 14 was synthetized, which could turn into\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 3 of 18\n13 after insect metabolism. The toxicity of 14 is far lower than the mouse oral toxicity LD50 (662 mg/kg) of dioxapyrrolomycin, and 14 has better physical and chemical properties. Ultimately, compound 14 was developed and commercialized as chlorfenapyr, the famous insecticide and acaricide. Since the 1990s, chlorfenapyr has been registered and listed in more than 30 countries worldwide. Its sales volume has exceeded USD 100 million in the global pesticide market [27,28,30].

Chlorfenapyr\nCompared to dioxypyrrolomycin, chlorfenapyr shows significant changes in its backbone [31]. Firstly, there is one carbon atom between the benzene ring and the pyrrole ring in dioxypyrrolomycin, while the benzene ring and pyrrole ring in chlorfenapyr are directly connected. Secondly, both compounds show significant differences in the substituents located on the benzene and pyrrole rings. Thirdly, chlorfenapyr has an ethoxymethyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen atom, which is a necessary structural modification to address the issue of the phytotoxicity of chlorfenapyr\u2019s parent compound (13). There are two main routes for chlorfenapyr synthesis (Figure 2). The first route is to use 4-bromopyrrole (4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile) and chloromethyl ethyl ether as raw materials with an inorganic base or organic base, which are then catalyzed to synthesize chlorfenapyr. For example, researchers use sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate as a de-acid reagent and carry out a condensation reaction with 4-bromopyrrole and chloromethyl ether to prepare chlorfenapyr, which has a high yield and purity [32]. This route has the advantages of being a simple process and producing a high synthesis yield. Thus, it is suitable for industrial production and has been widely used. However, it is difficult to purchase commercial products of chloromethyl ether, which increases production costs. In addition, chloromethyl ether is a carcinogen that has a negative impact on staff health.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 20 Table 1.

Synthesis of Chlorfenapyr and Its Derivatives 3.1. Chlorfenapyr Compared to dioxypyrrolomycin, chlorfenapyr shows significant changes in its backbone [31].

Thirdly, chlorfenapyr has an ethoxymethyl\ngroup on the pyrrole nitrogen atom, which is a necessary structural modification to ad-\ndress the issue of the phytotoxicity of chlorfenapyr\u2019s parent compound (13).\nThere are two main routes for chlorfenapyr synthesis (Figure 2). The first route is to\nuse 4-bromopyrrole (4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-car-\nbonitrile) and chloromethyl ethyl ether as raw materials with an inorganic base or organic\nbase, which are then catalyzed to synthesize chlorfenapyr. For example, researchers use\nsodium carbonate or potassium carbonate as a de-acid reagent and carry out a condensa-\ntion reaction with 4-bromopyrrole and chloromethyl ether to prepare chlorfenapyr, which\nhas a high yield and purity [32]. This route has the advantages of being a simple process\nand producing a high synthesis yield. Thus, it is suitable for industrial production and has\nbeen widely used. However, it is difficult to purchase commercial products of chlorome-\nthyl ether, which increases production costs. In addition, chloromethyl ether is a carcino-\ngen that has a negative impact on staff health.\nThe second process route is to use 4-bromopyrrole to react with diethyloxymethane,\nphosphoryl chloride, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under the condition of an or-\nganic base, which acts as the acid binding accelerator to synthesize chlorfenapyr. For in-\nstance, Cyanamid reported using phosphoryl chloride and DMF to prepare a Vilsmeier\nreagent. At the same time, they used chlorinate diethyloxymethane to prepare chlorome-\nthyl ether. Finally, all of the above materials were subjected to a condensation reaction\nunder the catalysis of triethylamine to obtain chlorfenapyr [33]. BASF revealed their pa-\ntent application for a production method of the arylpyrrole compound. In the presence of\nN-ethyl-N,N-diisopropylamine, diethyloxymethane, phosphoryl chloride, and DMF are\nused to prepare chlorfenapyr, producing a high yield [34]. This route reduces the cost of\nraw materials and avoids the use the strong carcinogens, such as chlorodimethyl et er.\nNevertheless, the reaction wastewater co t ins a large amount of DMF and phosphate,\nmaking the wastewater ostly to treat and environmentally unfriendly.\nFigure 2.

This route reduces the cost of raw materials and avoids the use the strong carcinogens, such as chlorodimethyl ether. Nevertheless, the reaction wastewater contains a large amount of DMF and phosphate, making the wastewater costly to treat and environmentally unfriendly. In these two synthetic routes, 4-bromopyrrole (tralopyril) plays the most important role in the synthesis of chlorfenapyr. Tralopyril is a molluscicide reported by the BASF company to kill oncomelania and is widely used as an antifoulant for shipping [35]. Tralopyril is the brominated compound that originates from arylpyrrolonitrile (2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile). The synthesis of arylpyrrolonitriles also has been widely studied. Recently, most researchers have begun to use p-chlorophenylglycine as the starting material, which is methylated with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA), ethyl trifluoroacetate (TFAE), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1,1,1-trifluoroacetic, or other trifluoroacetic reagents to obtain these arylpyrrolonitriles. Xu changed the reaction solvent system and used an acid binding agent, which led the bromination reaction rate to improve greatly, and the product yield reached above 90% [36]. On this basis, Fu found that using TFA and diethoxymethane instead of TFAA and dibromomethane could reduce the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 5 of 18\nreaction cost remarkably. The price of the former is about a quarter of that of TFAA and dibromomethane. Meanwhile, this modified route also avoids the use of methylethyl, a strong carcinogen, which greatly improves the economic benefits and production safety [37]. Overall, the synthesis of arylpyrrolonitriles in recent decades has been developed in the direction of producing a high yield and being low-cost, eco-friendly, and healthy.

Chlorfenapyr Derivatives\nIn view of the excellent effect of chlorfenapyr, many agricultural chemical companies, such as the ACC, Bayer, Rhone Poulenc, and Ciba-Geigy continued their commitment to creating new aromatic pyrrole compounds, publishing a large number of patents and discovering many new highly active compounds. These representative high-activity compounds are summarized below, and mainly include pyrrole-ring- and benzene-ring-modified compounds, N-bridged compounds, and amino acid\u2013compound conjugates that are designed based on the \u201cphloem-mobile insecticides\u201d theory.\n3.2.1. N-Substituted Derivatives\nArylpyrrole compounds, as oxidative phosphorylation blockers, tend to damage plant chloroplasts [50]. However, N-derivatization in the pyrrole ring turns aryl-pyrroles into precursor pesticides, thereby reducing the amount of plant damage. Thus, a large number of aryl-pyrrole N-derivatives have been synthesized, in which several highly active compounds have been discovered (Figure 3) [2]. As previously mentioned, in compounds 13 and 14 (chlorfenapyr), the N-derivatization of aryl-pyrroles reduced the toxicity to mammals and plant phytotoxicity. In addition, with the introduction of different groups in the N position, the derivatives could obtain larger insecticidal spectra. For example, N-derivatization of the compounds 15a, 15b, and 15c at 10 mg/L showed 100% lethality against the third-instar larvae of Heliothis virescens, Spodoptera eridania, and Empoasca abrupta and the organophosphorus-resistant leaf mite Tetranychus urticae. Meanwhile, these compounds have good activity against Diabrotic undecimpunctata howawdi and Blattella germanica [26]. N-carboxylic acid ester derivatives 16a, 16b, and 16c showed 90\u2013100% lethality against H. virescens, S. eridania, and E. abrupta (at 10 mg/L), and against the organophosphorus-resistant leaf mite T. urticae (at 100 mg/L) [12]. N-cyclopropyl carboxylate derivatives 17a and 17b also have good efficacy against the above pests [51]. N-aminoalkyl carboxylate ester derivatives, such as glycine ester-substituted 18a, 18b, and 19 at 10 mg/L could completely kill the southern armyworm, western potato leafhopper, and tobacco budworm [52]. N-alkylcarbonylaminomethyl and N-arylaminomethyl derivatives 20a and 20b, as well as N-thiomethyl 21, 22, and 23, also have good insecticidal activity against the soybean aphid and leaf beetle [52]. N-oxyaryl derivatives 24 and 25 not only\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 7 of 18\nretain their insecticidal and acaricidal activity, but also have excellent nematocidal activities. The N-oxyaryl derivative 25a at 150 mg/L completely controlled Caenorhabditis elegans adults and larvae [31]. A study of the field efficiency of N-methylcarbamate derivative 26 indicated that at 100 mg/L, after 7 days, it had a value of 98% against organophosphorusresistant leaf mites, which is better than that of chlorfenapyr [35]. Compound 27, with two ester groups substituted on the nitrogen atom, had better insecticidal activity against Mythimna separate, especially when R was a short-chain alkyl group. The mortality of 28 against Culex pipiens pallens reached 100% at 0.10 mg/kg. Compound 29 had very good insecticidal activity against the vermilion mite, with an LD50 of 0.43 mg/L, which was 2.65 times higher than that of chlorfenapyr [52].

Aryl-Substituted Derivatives\nResearchers reported that they replaced the benzene ring of chlorfenapyr with polyfluorinated benzo-1,4-dioxane to obtain new arylpyrrolenes (Figure 4). These compounds displayed biological activity, as 30 and 31 demonstrated insecticidal activities against the corn weevil, leaf mites, and diamondback moth [53,54]. Using a thiophene or furan ring substitute for the benzene ring could improve the new arylpyrrolenes\u2019 insecticidal and acaricidal activities. Compound 32 showed 100% lethality against the southern armyworm and leaf beetles at 300 \u00b5g/mL and 50 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. It displayed nearly 100% lethality against resistant leaf mites and the tobacco budworm at 300 \u00b5g/mL and 100 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, the thiophene-substituted arylpyrrolenes were found to possess an anti-fungal effect against Venturia inaegualis, Plasmopara viticola, Puccinia recondite, Erysiphe graminis, and other plant pathogens [55].

Ciba-Geigy dis-\ncovered that by using polyfluoroalkyl to replace trifluoromethyl, they could obtain a series\nof broadly active arylpyrrolenes (Figure 5) [56]. The indoor activity tests showed that these\ncompounds had good effects against Nilaparvata lugens, H. virescens, bean aphid, leaf mite,\nLucilia cuprina, Plutella xylostella, and Blattella germanica. Compounds 33a, 33b, and 33c also\nhad excellent fungicidal activity [56,57]. Bayer reported 5-haloalkane sulfur or sulfinyl\nsubstitute arylpyrrolenes to be extremely active against lepidopteran pests. Compound 34\nat 10 \u03bcg/mL showed 100% lethality against P. xylostella [58,59]. Cyanamid tried something\nsimilar and developed compound 35 with a similar structure and effect [60,61].

Compound 36 and 37 at 100\n\u03bcg/mL showed insecticidal activity against the southern armyworm, western potato leaf-\nhopper, and tobacco budworm [63]. Similarly, introducing one or more trifluoromethyl\ngroups into the pyrrole ring led to the formation of high-activity bis-trifluoromethyl or\ntri-trifluoromethyl arylpyrrolenes, such as 38 [64]. For position 3 of the pyrrole ring, re-\nsearchers attempted to introduce thioamide, haloalkane, sulfur, or sulfinyl one after an-\nother, and they obtained several new arylpyrrolenes, including 39, which has good activ-\nity for pests, mites, and fungi [65].\nFigure 4.

Amino Acid Chlorfenapyr Conjugate\nThe introduction of an endogenous nutrient, such as a monosaccharide or amino acid\nto the parent insecticide, can enhance plasma membrane permeation and improve the\nphloem mobility of the conjugate. Based on this, \u201cphloem-mobile insecticides\u201d are de-\nsigned and synthesized, which are efficient for pest control. For example, a glycosyl\nfipronil conjugate was synthesized and demonstrated to be involved in the active\ntransport system. An amino acid-herbicide conjugate, 2,4 D-Lys, showed a distinctive dis-\ntribution in plants due to mediation by the amino acid carrier system [66].\nYang reported that the introduction of glutamic acid or theanine onto pyrrolonitrile\nobtained several amino acid pyrrolonitrile conjugates [67] (Figure 7). Among them, the\nglutamic acid pyrrolonitrile conjugate showed good insecticidal activity, while the\ntheanine-pyrrolonitrile conjugate did not. It is noteworthy that the glutamic acid pyrrolo-\nnitrile conjugate exhibited insecticidal activity only in the presence of methoxy on a linker\narm [68]. Han designed a series of amino acid methyl ester chlorfenapyr conjugates using\namide bonds as linker arms. Compound 41a displayed optimal transport properties in\nrice.

But 42 and 44, at the same dose, only led to half the mortality of chlorfenapyr or no activity, respectively [70].\n3.3. Structure Activity Relationship\nExtensive research on the structure activity relationship of arylpyrrolenes has been conducted (Figure 9). As shown for 45, different substitutions on the pyrrole ring are listed in Figure 9. Based on a large number of indoor and field experimental studies, it was found that when positions 2- and 3 of the pyrrole ring are replaced by an aryl group and electron-withdrawing group (EWG), respectively, and another position is also substituted once, the pyrrolenes show good insecticidal and acaricidal activity. Therefore, the general structure of arylpyrrole is represented by 46 [27,28]. On this basis, further research has certified the following: (1) When both X and Y are Cl or Br, the compounds have almost the same insecticidal activity. However, when X is replaced by Cl or Br and Y is substituted by CF3, the obtained compounds have the strongest activity. (2) When EWG is NO2, CN or SO2CF3, the compounds have no significant difference in activity. (3) When R1 is the electron-donating group, alkyl or alkoxy substitution weakens the compound\u2019s activity. Meanwhile, if R1 is changed to an EWG or lipophilic group, such as Cl, Br, or CF3, then substitution on position 4 of the benzene ring is preferred, which could strengthen the insecticidal and acaricidal activity. (4) As a precursor pesticide, alkyl or alkoxy substitution is the most suitable for position N. In addition, weakly acidic NH2 groups are required for the uncoupling action. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between compound acidity (pKa), lipophilicity (lgP), and insecticidal activity. The compounds exhibit high insecticidal activity only in the appropriate parameter range [71,72].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 11 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20 Figure 7.

Structure Activity Relationship\ntivity only in the appropriate parameter range [71,72].\nArylpyrroles are mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncouplers in insects.\nThey can damage mitochondria by disturbing the proton gradient in the mitochondrial\nmembrane and inhibiting the conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) (Figure 10) [73]. This further causes cell death and ultimately kills\npests. As an oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, the compound should possess appro-\npriate acidity and lipophilicity. Chlorfenapyr is a lipophilic compound with an lgP value\nof 4.6 at a pH range of 2.4 to 11.0. However, chlorfenapyr does not demonstrate acidity\nbefore removing N-substituent group. The lgP and pKa values of proton type N-H ar-\nylpyrrole are 5 and 7.6, respectively [23,74].

The research indicates that the microsomal monooxygenase inhibitor piperonyl butoxide significantly reduced the toxicity of chlorfenapyr against the potato leaf beetle, but it had no effect on CL303268 (the successor of chlorfenapyr). Additionally, the respiratory rate is a key physiological effect phenomenon induced by uncoupling agents. CL303268 at 20 nmol/L doubled the respiratory rate in rats and inhibited it as the concentration increased [23].

CL303268 at 20 nmol/L doubled the respiratory rate in rats and inhibited it as the concentration increased [23].\nChlorfenapyr, as a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, has no spe-\ncific gene or protein target resistance in theory. But this not means it does not have any\nresistance risk. For example, T. urticae is a well-known pest with a wide range of hosts\nworldwide. Herron reported that in Australian nectarine orchards, T. urticae developed a\n2.9-fold resistance to chlorfenapyr compared to other pesticides, and this value will in-\ncrease to 8.7-fold in future [75,76]. It was found that chlorfenapyr may have cross-re-\nsistance when combined with other insecticides. Citing another case, in Pakistan, Earias\nvittella and bollworm were found to have 7.7- and 74-fold resistance to chlorfenapyr, re-\nspectively. As chlorfenapyr was not commercially available in Pakistan at the time of the\nstudy, the researchers attributed the high resistance to chlorfenapyr to its cross-resistance\nwith permethrin [57,59]. Another study showed that in Belgium, T. urticae (MR-VL), a\nstrain with extremely high resistance to bifenthrin, dicofol, and dimethoate, had a 154-\nfold cross-resistance after the use of chlorfenapyr [60]. According to these reports, the re-\nsistance of pests and mites to chlorfenapyr is mostly due to cross-resistance with conven-\ntional insecticides. However, there was no target-insensitive cross-resistance found be-\ntween chlorfenapyr and conventional insecticides. Guessan found that an Anopheles gam-\nbiae multi-resistant strain with kdr genes (for resistance to pyrethroids and DDT), Rdl\ngenes (for resistance to dieldrin), and Ace-lR genes (for acetylcholinesterase insensitivity)\nhas no cross-resistance to chlorfenapyr [61].\nThe resistance of pests or mites to chlorfenapyr is closely related to detoxification\nmetabolizing enzymes. Insect detoxification enzymes are a kind of heterogeneous enzyme\nthat metabolizes large amounts of endogenous or exogenous substrates, allowing insects\nto survive by rapidly responding to drug stresses.

The MFO of Choristoneura rosaceana and T. urticae are correlated to the resistance to chlorfenapyr [78]. Treated with an MFO or glutathione-S-transferase inhibitor improves these pests\u2019 sensitiveness to cypermethrin and chlorfenapyr.\n6. Environmental Toxicology of Chlorfenapyr\nStudies have shown that chlorfenapyr has a strong binding force with soil particles, as well as low water solubility and volatility. Chlorfenapyr degrades slowly in soil, sediment, and water, with an average half-life of 1.0 year, 1.1 years, and 0.8 years, respectively [79]. In the past few years, chlorfenapyr was recommended for use on rice to control resistant insects. Accordingly, chlorfenapyr might be released into aquatic environments more easily through spray drift or surface runoff after rainfalls. Chlorfenapyr was detected in northwest Mississippi, with sediment concentrations of up to 2.03 \u00b5g/L [80]. In light of the popularity of chlorfenapyr, the potential risks it causes to the environment and non-target organisms have attracted researchers\u2019 attention. The toxic effects of chlorfenapyr have been reported in ducks, fish, silkworm, and mice. It has moderate oral toxicity (LD50 = 662 mg/kg bw for mouse by mouth) and low transdermal toxicity in mammals (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg bw for rabbit by skin). However, aquatic organisms, birds, and bees are sensitive to chlorfenapyr [81]. For explanatory purposes, the chlorfenapyr used against Japanese carp resulted in an LC50 = 0.5 \u00b5g/L; in rainbow trout, LC50 = 7.4 \u00b5g/L; in earthworm, LD50 = 22 mg/kg; in quail, LD50 = 34 mg/kg; in wild duck, LD50 = 10 mg/kg; in honey bee, LD50 = 0.2 \u00b5g each [82] (Figure 11). Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 20\nChlorfenapyr and its derivatives, due to their excellent activity, wide insecticidal\nspectrum, and unique mode of action, have become commonly used as insecticides world-\nwide. The discovery and development of chlorfenapyr is a typical successful example of\ncreating new insecticide lead compounds based on the design and modification of natural\nproducts. It can also act as a reference for the development of more new insecticides in the\nfuture. However, challenges and limits still exist, such as the resistance, residual toxicity\nto non-target organisms and in-depth mechanism exploration. Nevertheless, recent ad-\nvances will lead to a solution for these issues, and will promote the development and rea-\nsonable application of chlorfenapyr for pest management.\nAuthor Contributions: P.H. and X.Y.: investigation, conceptualization and writing.

As seen in Table 3, Chen found that chlorfenapyr has high bioaccumulation in zebrafish, with bioaccumulation factors of 864.6 and 1321.9 after 21 days of exposure to 1.0 and 10 \u00b5g/L of chlorfenapyr, respectively. Furthermore, chlorfenapyr chronic exposure caused oxidative damage, apoptosis, and immune disorders in zebrafish liver [80]. It also altered the levels of endogenous metabolites in the liver and brain. As for humans, a few fatal toxicity cases of chlorfenapyr have been reported.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 14 of 18\nThe characteristic features of chlorfenapyr intoxication are high fever and rhabdomyolysis, which gradually worsen until death [83]. Studies have shown that chlorfenapyr ingestion causes damage to high-energy organs, such as the brain, kidney, muscles, and heart. Chlorfenapyr also induces delayed injury, such as Leigh\u2019s disease or mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy, and ultimately results in death [84,85]. Considering the widespread use of chlorfenapyr, non-target organisms, particularly humans, may face potential threats to their health. Ren reported that chlorfenapyr induced toxicity in human hepatocytes (HepG2) and induced cellular mitochondrial damage associated with reactive oxygen species accumulation and calcium overload. In addition, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest were detected in cells treated with chlorfenapyr [67]. Although chlorfenapyr is a promising insecticide, due to its high environmental persistence and potential toxic effects on non-target organisms, chlorfenapyr has been banned or its use has been limited in some countries, such as Europe and the United States [25].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7673 15 of 18\n7.
