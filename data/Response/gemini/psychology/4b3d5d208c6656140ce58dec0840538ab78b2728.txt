1. **Investigate the effectiveness of CAPP in removing antibiotic residues from other environmental matrices:** 
This study focused on the removal of antibiotic residues from water and milk, but it would be valuable to investigate the effectiveness of CAPP in removing antibiotic residues from other environmental matrices, such as soil, sediment, and wastewater. This would help to determine the broader applicability of CAPP as an antibiotic residue mitigation strategy.


2. **Evaluate the long-term effects of CAPP treatment on the microbial community:** 
This study assessed the short-term effects of CAPP treatment on the microbial community in water and milk, but it would be valuable to evaluate the long-term effects of CAPP treatment on the microbial community. This would help to determine if CAPP treatment has any negative impacts on the microbial community, such as the development of antibiotic resistance.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms of CAPP-induced antibiotic degradation:** 
This study identified peroxidation as the main mechanism of CAPP-induced antibiotic degradation, but it would be valuable to investigate the mechanisms of CAPP-induced antibiotic degradation in more detail. This would help to identify the specific reactive species that are responsible for antibiotic degradation and to develop more effective CAPP treatment strategies.


4. **Develop CAPP-based technologies for the removal of antibiotic residues from environmental and food matrices:** 
The results of this study suggest that CAPP has the potential to be used to develop technologies for the removal of antibiotic residues from environmental and food matrices. This could include the development of CAPP-based water treatment systems, soil remediation technologies, and food decontamination methods.


5. **Investigate the potential of CAPP to mitigate the development of antibiotic resistance:** 
This study found that CAPP treatment of antibiotic solutions did not contribute to the evolution of bacterial resistance, but it would be valuable to investigate the potential of CAPP to mitigate the development of antibiotic resistance in more detail. This could include studies to investigate the effects of CAPP treatment on the expression of antibiotic resistance genes and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in environmental and clinical settings.
