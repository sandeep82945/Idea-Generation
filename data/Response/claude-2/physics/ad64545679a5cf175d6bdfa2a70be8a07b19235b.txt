 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop a continuous flow process for the industrial scale synthesis of ALA. This could improve efficiency and reduce costs compared to traditional batch synthesis.

2. Engineer enzymes like ketoreductases or Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases to improve their activity, selectivity and stability for ALA synthesis. This could enable greener biocatalytic routes. 

3. Design new chiral catalysts or ligands for enantioselective synthesis of R-ALA. This could give higher yields and stereoselectivity than current catalysts.

4. Utilize new technologies like photoredox catalysis, electrosynthesis or 3D printing for ALA synthesis. This could enable new reaction pathways or improved process intensification.

5. Develop a "one-pot" cascade reaction sequence for ALA synthesis. This could simplify the route and avoid isolating intermediates.
