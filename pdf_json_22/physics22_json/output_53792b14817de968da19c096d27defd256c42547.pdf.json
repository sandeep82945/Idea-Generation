    "abstractText": "The aim of paper is to determine experimentally and numerically the strength characteristics related to the paraglider wing with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of applied materials. The applied method consists in theoretical modeling supplemented by the tests of material parameters. First, the set of 10 lightweight fabrics was selected for the tests; the samples are representative for these structures. The materials were tested using the spectroscopy to determine the FTIR spectra. The samples differ in the content of certain characteristic groups. Air permeability change of the materials was determined for the different pressure drops. The air permeability of almost all the analyzed samples was close to zero with the exception of only one material. The tensile strength and elongation at the break of samples were determined on the testing machine. The paraglider samples were characterized by slightly decreased mechanical properties compared to the parachute fabrics. The material characteristics determined during the tests are the input data for the theoretical analysis. The numerical model of the paraglider wing is based on a 3D geometry from previous research, but the stress, strain, and deformation were determined using the ANSYS Structural program and the finite elements method. To determine the strength correctly, we introduce two basic values: the absolute maximal and the representative values that are the biggest repetitive values of stress, strain, and deformation. The stress value was determined by the main factors: (i) the thinner the material, the bigger the stresses that were accumulated; (ii) the stronger the material, the bigger the stresses that were accumulated. The results are similar for all materials and differ mainly by the values. The biggest stresses were observed inside the material contacting the ribs, whereas the biggest deformation and strain were in the regions between ribs, and the smallest were in the contact areas with the fixed supports. Their highest intensity was observed on the leading edge of the paraglider. We conclude that the obtained stresses were far from the breaking level for the wing.",

            "text": "The analysis of state variables related to the lightweight paraglider wing in variable environmental conditions is relatively rare in the available scientific literature. The problem is difficult in respect to the complex structural geometry and variable flight conditions. The authors analyze the selected problems of paraglider aerodynamics and the obtained results focus on the particular solutions of dynamic problems; the references to the specific are compiled below.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7291. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15207291 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nThe paraglider was first numerically analyzed in a sense of computational fluid dynamics by Zhu, Cao [1,2] in 2012. Then, the problem was consequently developed by other authors [3]. The research considered mainly geometric parameters, deflation of the wing, and pressure gradient along a paraglider wing. Following this, authors started examining the purpose of quantifying the amount of aerodynamic drag related to the flexible nature of a paraglider wing. The drag of a pilot in a harness was estimated by means of wind tunnel testing, and a computational fluid dynamics solver was used to estimate smooth wing lift and drag characteristics [4]. An instrumentation system for in situ measurement of the pressure differential at the upper and lower surfaces of dynamically inflatable wings were designed and tested by Benedetti, Gurgel Veras [5]. The experimental data confirms the occurrence of a bottom leading-edge recirculation bubble, linked to the low Reynolds regime and the presence of an air intake. Double-membrane gliding parachutes were analyzed by Ovchinnikov, Petrov, and Ganiev [6] in respect to the wide variety of application, including the solution of cargo transportation problems. An inflatable cell model of paragrlider\u2019s wing was investigated by Md. Nizam Uddin, Mohammad Mashud in wind tunnel experiments, which are designed to represent the dynamic behaviors of each cell comprising the canopy [7]. The article presented is a continuation of these previous works [8,9]. In paper [8] we defined two PA-fabrics covering a paraglider wing, with the comparative object being the permeable clothing material. The material parameters of textile materials are applied in numerical simulations of aerodynamic characteristics. The space model of the paraglider wing and the plane model of its cross-section in the symmetry plane are analyzed. The visualization of the stream filaments shows that it is advisable to cover the wing with the impermeable fabric. Maslanka and Korycki [9] analyzed the sensitivity of aerodynamic characteristics to the properties of the material used for the paraglider wing. The covering material yields adequate pressure distribution between the external and internal parts of the wing. The finite volume mesh is defined using the ANSYS Meshing program. Numerical analysis uses different covering materials, ranging from the air-impermeable covering to the covering subjected to hydrolytic\u2013mechanical degradation. Optimization of properties of the covering material improves the lift force and the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. Generally, the shape of the paraglider and material properties of the covering materials should be optimized [10,11]. The main difficulty is the proper formulation of optimization that is functional. The parameters that allow us to compare the materials covering the paraglider wing are the pressure (determination of lift force and stability problems), as well as the stresses in the materials created during the flight. The other problem is the connection of wing components by seams [12,13]. The alternative is the formulation of the micro-scale model [14] or the numerical optimization using the set of subsequent solutions [15]. The main idea of the paper presented is to analyze the selected lightweight paraglider and parachute fabrics made of polyamide 6.6 and coated with polyurethane resins or silicone, to determine their air permeability and strength characteristics. The laboratory testing on scaled models is difficult because of problems in the elastic similitude of compared structures. On the other hand, tests of full-scale models in a large facility with a large full-scale test section are expensive. The state variables are now the pressure in case of flight characteristics and the strength parameters during the analysis of material effort; that is, the stress, strain, and displacement. When analyzing the obtained results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it can be concluded that samples differ in the content of certain characteristic groups. The determination of the functional groups present in the samples was crucial for the selection of four samples, the parameters of which were later entered into the simulation. Moreover, the analysis of the peaks obtained during the FTIR spectroscopy analysis could give an overview of the expected strength properties of the considered samples.\nAir permeability change of the analyzed samples was determined according to the standards EN ISO 9237:1995 [16] and PIA-C-44378 [17]. The pressure drops equal to: 100 Pa, 125 Pa, 1500 Pa, 2000 Pa, and 2500 Pa were used to compare the air permeability change of the samples. According to the analyzed overloads during the flight, the materials are subjected to the maximal pressure drop equal to 1036 Pa. Therefore, the test results of air permeability for a pressure drop equal to 1500 Pa were chosen to be the most proper for the further analysis. Next, the tensile properties (represented by the tensile strength and elongation at break [18]) were determined using the testing machine. The tests were performed in the normal climate conditions; that is T = 20 \u25e6C; p = 1013.25 hPa; and RH = 65%. Finally, the anisotropic characteristics of the woven materials that were achieved and analyzed in the course of physical testing were the input data in the ANSYS Structural program. The geometrical model is approximated by the dimensionless coordinates of crucial points inside the wing and smoothed by spline curves. The finite element mesh is defined using the ANSYS Meshing program. The obtained distribution of stress, strain, and displacement are comparable but the values are completely different. Numerical tests and simulations are essential to determine the distributions of pressure and stresses inside the paraglider wing. These parameters affect the flight stability and consequently the user\u2019s safety The novelty elements can be formulated as follows: (i) The analysis of a lightweight paraglider wing is still innovative, particularly in respect to different state variables, i.e., the pressure in flight characteristics problems; such as the stress, strain, and displacement during investigation of the material properties. (ii) The selected lightweight paraglider and parachute fabrics made of polyamide 6.6 coated with polyurethane resins or silicone are analyzed to determine their air permeability and strength characteristics with the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The infrared spectroscopy is infrequently investigated in case of coated textile materials, particularly the lightweight textiles specific for a paraglider. (iii) The air permeability is difficult to determine because almost all the analyzed samples are impermeable. Thus, the materials should be tested for different pressure drops to determine correctly the relationship between the permeability and the pressure. (iv) The article can provide reference for further studies on optimal material parameters and their coincidence with the flight parameters of a paraglider wing."

The fabrics were received thanks to manufacturers from RPA and Poland. However, due to their confidential character, the authors were asked not to give names of the manufacturers, nor the trade names of the samples.\nThe exact characteristic functional groups were studied in Sections 3.1.1 and 4.1. They are all manufactured using a standard ripstop weave (creating visible squares).\nOnly one of the analyzed fabrics (no. 9) has a special hexagonal ripstop weave, which causes increased dimensional stability when stretched in different directions. Obtained mass of the fabrics are of a range of 26\u201342 g/m2 and their thickness is of a range of 0.05\u20130.09 mm (Table 1).

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFTIR spectra were recorded by a Nicolet 8700 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA), with a diamond adapter equipped (Smart Orbit ATR sampling accessory), and for better accuracy of the analysis of modified samples, 128 scans were taken in the range of 3800\u2013800 cm\u22121.\n3.1.2. Air Permeability\nAir permeability change of the analyzed samples was determined by the FX 3300 digital device and based on the EN ISO 9237:1995 standard [16]. The standard pressure drop between the two sides of a textile fabric is 100 Pa. However, according to the literature and product characteristics given by the paraglider fabric manufacturers, the air permeability for this kind of material is usually determined with a pressure drop equal to 2000 Pa. On the other hand, according to the PIA-C-44378 standard (parachute cloth specification) [17], the pressure drop should be equal to 125 Pa. Therefore, the pressure drops are equal to 100 Pa, 125 Pa, 1500 Pa, 2000 Pa, and 2500 Pa were used to compare the air permeability change of the analyzed samples. According to the standard, the surface area of 20 cm2 was applied. The results are defined in mm/s.

According to the ISO 13934-1:2013 [18], the width of the sample was equal to 50 mm, the distance between clamps was 200 mm, and the speed rate of the clamps equal to 100 mm/min was applied. The tests were performed in the warp and the weft direction in the normal climate conditions, i.e., T = 20 \u25e6C; p = 1013.25 hPa; and RH = 65%."

The solution was based on the Newton\u2013Raphson method, which is used for calculation of the force displacement curve for a nonlinear system. It is done by assuming a zero displacement system and then implementing iterations of forces and displacements until there is a convergence (which is assumed according to convergence criteria). Based on the literature [19], when simplified, the Newton\u2013Raphson method is described by the following equations, where (1) is the displacement increment and (2) is the residual force:\n\u2206un = (Fext \u2212 Fnint)/Kn (1)\nFnres = Fext \u2212 Fnint (2)\nwhere: N\u2014iteration Fext\u2014applied force Fint\u2014computed internal force\nFres\u2014residual force \u2206u\u2014displacement increment K\u2014stiffness matrix The convergence is achieved when Fnres \u2264 convergence criteria. The model is based on a 3D geometry from previous research [9]. However, it differs\nbecause of the type of calculation (the previous was a Computational Fluid Dynamics, further CFD type). The ANSYS Structural program uses input data for pre-processing. The input data can be, for example, material properties, geometry, supports, or forces acting on a considered material. Some of them (mainly the material parameters) are provided thanks to the previously described testing methods, i.e., density, thickness, Young\u2019s modulus, and tensile strength. The air permeability parameter is not directly implemented into the ANSYS Structural; however, based on this property, definition of pressure distribution over the paraglider (which certainly is the input data for the considered case) is possible. Properties of materials obtained in the course of the experimental testing described below were a basis for the theoretical analysis and obtaining the distributions of stress, strain, and deformation considered in the following sections. Tensile forces acting on the covering materials of a paraglider are created by the pressure difference between air inside a paraglider wing and around it. The pressure distribution over a paraglider covered with impermeable and permeable materials were determined using the ANSYS Fluent program during the previous analysis mentioned above [8,9] and the maximal overload that can be achieved."

            "heading": "4.1. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)",
            "text": "The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is widely discussed in available literature in respect to different applications. The main problem is the external coating of the paraglider fabrics, which can influence the test methodology, as well as the strength properties of the material. The problem is discussed in [20\u201325] for different coatings and base materials. The infrared spectroscopy is infrequently investigated in case of coated textile materials [21]. The FTIR spectra of the samples are presented in Figures 1 and 2 and the absorption ranges corresponding to the characteristic bonds are presented in Table 2. When analyzing the obtained FTIR spectra, it can be concluded that samples differ in the content of certain characteristic groups [22]. The sample no. 1 is distinguished from other samples due to the presence of some characteristic peaks, which were not registered for any other tested material. A broad band at 1183\u20131153 cm\u22121 with a peak at 1169 cm\u22121 and 1153\u20131123 cm\u22121 with a peak of 1138 cm\u22121 are related to the presence of C\u2013O stretching vibrations and to the axial stretching of the C\u2013N\u2013C bond, which is characteristic for polyamide 66 [23]. A recorded peak at 1735\u20131690 cm\u22121 corresponding to the C=O group, indicates its higher content in material compared to the remaining samples [21]. In the case of the samples 9 and 10, the maximum intensity of peaks, and as a result the highest content of assigned bonds, were recorded for the following groups: \u2013CH3, tensile of Si\u2013C in Si\u2013CH3 at 796\u2013789 cm\u22121, tensile of Si\u2013O\u2013Si at 1074\u20131005 cm\u22121 and CH3 strain in Si\u2013CH3 at 1260\u20131250 cm\u22121. It should also be noticed that the vibrations characteristic for the CH, CH2, and CH3 groups occurred within the range of 3100\u20132852 cm\u22121, and the characteristic N\u2013H group at 3300\u20133330 cm\u22121 [24,25]. Analysis of the peaks obtained during the FTIR spectroscopy test could give an overview of the expected strength parameters of the samples. Higher peaks often indicate functional groups that give the material greater mechanical strength. In the case of sample numbers 9 and 10, these are the Si\u2013C, \u2013Si\u2013CH3 groups; therefore, these samples are characterized by the higher strength parameters. Another example can be sample no. 5, which is characterized by the lowest number of O\u2013C\u2013O, C\u2013O\u2013C, C\u2013OH,\nand C\u2013H groups. Sample no. 1 is the only described by the largest recognizable peak near the group C=O and C\u2013O. Simultaneously, the present groups are caused by chemical bondings, which affect the strength of the considered materials. When single bonding is considered, it is too weak to have any influence. However, when a composite is considered, their overall impact can be significant to the strength characteristics. Materials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 20\nFigure 1.

Therefore, the pressure distribution over a paraglider covered with an impermeable material obtained by the ANSYS Fluent program during the above mentioned previous analysis [8,9] was considered, Figure 8. Materials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 20\nThe case [9] considered undisturbed flight conditions, where the velocity of a paraglider v = 45 km/h, the angle of attack \u03b1 = 6\u25e6, the air temperature T = 300 K, and pressure p = 101,325 Pa. The air was considered as ideal gas. The pressure distribution in Figure 8 is the most advantageous due to the paraglider\u2019s principle of flight. A suitable lifting force is only created when the internal pressure is a constant of the maximal value. The lower pressure or the disturbed distribution inside the wing causes a rapid reduction in lift force and the unpredictable instability during the flight. According to [4], the maximal pressure difference between air inside the wing and the upper surface was equal to 185 Pa. However, the presented pressure distribution is applied to undisturbed flight conditions. Increased overload can be caused, for example, by a wind blowing or an operation of a pilot, and has a noticeable impact on pressure distribution and tensile forces acting inside the paraglider material. Thus, the pressure difference should be multiplied by a maximal overload during the flight. Based on a plot created during an actual parachute wing-type drop recorded with an electromechanical flight data recorder, the average overload during the opening of a wing-type parachute is around 5.6 g (the name of a parachute manufacturer and a model of the parachute were not allowed to be published due to a business secret). Overloads during parachute drops are the highest that can be achieved during a usage of the analyzed type of a flying objects. In normal flight conditions, a paraglider is not subjected to such high overloads. However, for safety, it was decided to assume higher overload values than can be achieved. According to the above conclusions, the analyzed materials were subjected to the maximal pressure drop during the flight equal to 1036 Pa. Therefore, the test results of air permeability for a pressure drop equal to 1500 Pa were chosen to be the most proper for the further analysis. In the paper were considered the pressure distributions over a paraglider made of the impermeable material (based on Figure 8 referring to samples: 1\u20138 and 10), and material of air permeability equal to 1.74 m/s under 1500 Pa (based on Figure 9, referring to the sample 9).

The considered sample is one of the strongest among the compiled results (only the sample number 10 achieved higher breaking force result, cf. Section 4.2). However, the main reason for the obtained values is that the material was subjected to the lowest pressure difference, which is caused by an increased air-permeability value. When a bigger pressure acting on a material was considered (samples 4, 6, and 10), the deformation and strain decreased with increasing of the tensile strength of a material.\nHowever, the stress value was determined by the following main factors:\n\u2022 The thinner the material, the bigger the stresses that were accumulated.

            "text": "The aim of this paper was to determine experimentally and numerically the strength characteristics concerning the lightweight paraglider wing with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of applied materials. The samples define the wide range of materials covering the wing, as well as the parachute fabrics, and are representative for these structures. The materials were tested using the spectroscopy technique to determine the FTIR spectra. The samples differ in the content of certain characteristic groups. The data obtained based on the FTIR spectroscopy analysis were not implemented directly to the ANSYS program. However, FTIR spectroscopy results, when compared to the tensile results, give a full overview of the material characteristics. Therefore, it had a significant impact on the consideration of this research. The air permeability of almost all the analyzed samples was close to zero with the exception of only one material. The permeability of this sample is greater than in other cases, but it is still very low. To secure the repeatability of results, the samples were subjected to different pressure drops between 100 Pa and 1500 Pa. The obtained results are very advantageous because the impermeable fabrics secure the high and stable pressure inside the paraglider wing. The only problem was determining the sufficient strength characteristics of the material applied. The representative and determinable material parameter is the Young\u2019s modulus E. Summarizing the test results, the paraglider samples were characterized by the slightly decreased mechanical properties compared to the parachute samples. Based on the FTIR Spectra and following laboratory tests, two fabrics coated with polyurethane (i.e., samples 4 and 6) and two fabrics coated with silicone (samples 9 and 10) were chosen to be considered in the further ANSYS Structural analysis. The material characteristics determined during the tests are the input data for the subsequent theoretical analysis. The numerical model of paraglider wing is based on a 3D geometry from a previous research, but the type of calculation is different. Stress, strain, and deformation distributions over the 3D model were determined using the ANSYS Structural program and the finite elements method. The tensile forces in the covering material are created by the pressure difference between the air inside and surrounding the wing. The pressure distribution over a paraglider structure covered with impermeable and permeable materials was determined using the ANSYS Fluent program. To determine the strength correctly, we introduced two basic parameters: the absolute maximal values and the representative values that are the biggest repetitive val-\nues of stress, strain, and deformation. Introducing the safety factors of stresses for the paraglider (around 3) and the parachute fabrics (around 6), and analyzing the distributions of strength parameters, we conclude that the values were far from the breaking level for the paraglider wing. Thus, the materials covering the wing secure the strength adequate for the expected requirements. The method applied is an advanced composition of experimental investigations and numerical modeling; that is, the theoretical model is supplemented by the tests of material parameters. Its advantage is the multiparametric and precise determination of strength characteristics. It follows that the proposed procedure is a promising tool to determine and evaluate the strength characteristics of fabrics covering the paraglider wing. The shape and material properties can be optimized using two alternative methods: the theoretical minimization of an objective functional or the multistage tests of different structural parameters. The first procedure consists in the formulation of the proper objective functional, which is difficult with respect to the complex analysis of the wing. We introduce the different state variables, that is, the pressure in flight dynamics and the stress/strain/displacement in problems concerning the strength of materials. The comprehensive testing of material properties connected with the numerical modeling seems to be the only applicable method.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.M., R.K. and H.S.; methodology, P.M., A.A., R.K. and H.S.; validation, P.M., A.A., R.K. and H.S.; formal analysis, P.M., A.A., R.K. and H.S.; investigation, P.M., A.A., R.K., H.S. and A.D.; resources, P.M., A.A., R.K., H.S. and A.D.; data curation, P.M., A.A., R.K. and H.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.M., A.A. and R.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.M. and R.K.; visualization, P.M., A.A., R.K. and H.S.; supervision, P.M., A.A., R.K. and H.S.
