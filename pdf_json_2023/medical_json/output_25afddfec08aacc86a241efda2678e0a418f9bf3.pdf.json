    "abstractText": "Background Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) can be considered as nanofertilizer providing zinc as an essential micronutrient for plant growth and production at specific safe dose, however, above this dose; ZnO NPs induce oxida\u2010 tive stress. The present research aimed to evaluate some physiological and molecular effects of ZnO NPs on Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) plant. Results The ZnO NPs were applied at five different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/l) via soaking fenugreek seeds for 24 h. Fenugreek seedlings were harvested after 14 days for biomass and biochemical analyses. The results revealed that increasing ZnO NPs concentration led to a significant increase in all measured parameters until peaked at 30 mg/l; after that, a decline trend was detected. However, malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly just at higher concentrations of ZnO NPs (40 and 50 mg/l). In addition, genetic variation measure using start codon targeted (SCoT) markers revealed that ZnO NP treatments exhibited limited genetic variation. Conclusion Results showed that treatment with ZnO NPs at 30 mg/l can improve biomass, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of fenugreek seedlings, besides being safe for DNA. So, this concentration could be a decent nanofertilizer for fenugreek plant.",

Fenugreek seedlings were harvested after 14 days for biomass and biochemical analyses. The results revealed that increasing ZnO NPs concentration led to a significant increase in all measured parameters until peaked at 30 mg/l; after that, a decline trend was detected. However, malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly just at higher concentrations of ZnO NPs (40 and 50 mg/l). In addition, genetic variation measure using start codon targeted (SCoT) markers revealed that ZnO NP treatments exhibited limited genetic variation.\nConclusion Results showed that treatment with ZnO NPs at 30 mg/l can improve biomass, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of fenugreek seedlings, besides being safe for DNA. So, this concentration could be a decent nanofertilizer for fenugreek plant.\nKeywords Fenugreek, Nanoparticles, MDA, DNA, SCoT analysis"

            "text": "Application of micronutrients in the form of nanoparticles has attracted a lot of attention because of their distinctive characteristics and promising applications in many agricultural sectors [1]. Nanoparticle fertilization is an important method to release required nutrients in a controlled manner gradually, which is vital to alleviate the consequences of soil contamination generated by the excessive use of chemical fertilizers [2]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most important nanoparticles due to its interesting and unique properties, biocompatibility, and low toxicity [3]. Many research articles studied the key role of ZnO NPs in crop growth and productivity, including nitrogen uptake, respiration, and photosynthesis, in addition to the activation of other physiological processes such as enzyme activation, synthesis of protein, and metabolism of nucleic acid and carbohydrate [4\u20137]. Plant response to ZnO NPs is controlled by many factors such as NPs concentration, size, exposure duration, and type of plant [8].\nIn contrast to the beneficial role of NPs in the aforementioned biochemical processes, the most common negative effect of NP exposure is the development of a cascade of reactions causing plants\u2019 oxidative stress. This is due to the synthesis of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion (O2\u2212), *Correspondence: Doaa E. Elsherif doaa.elsherif@science.tanta.edu.eg 1 Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta 31527, Egypt 2 Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Al\u2011Azhar University (Girls Branch), Cairo, Egypt\nhydrogen superoxide (OH\u00b7), peroxide oxygen (H2O2), and singlet oxygen (\u201cO2\u201d). ROS induced-oxidative stress is triggered by activating various biochemical reactions in the plant such as lipid peroxidation (LPO) [9]. The main product of LPO is malondialdehyde (MDA) that results from the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids on the cell membrane [10]. Moreover, NP-induced ROS may cause DNA damage via affecting cross-linking, DNA-strand breakage, and sugar or base adducts [11, 12].\nRecently, many new promising marker techniques, such as targeted start codon (SCoT) polymorphism, have been used to evaluate the molecular changes in plants exposed to NPs. SCoT is reproducible marker that originates from the short-conserved region in plant genes surrounding the initiation codon of ATG translation [13]. SCoT markers have been widely used for investigation of genetic diversity and structure, identification of cultivar, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, and DNA fingerprinting in plants [14]. In addition, SCoT is preferable than RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP in being more stable, providing more repeatable and reliable bands and could be used well for genetic mapping in numerous plants and marker-assisted selection programs [15].\nFenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is herbaceous plant whose seeds and leaves are of widespread use in food preparations and traditional medicine [16]. It is a rich source of iron, zinc, calcium, carotene, vitamin C, and many vitamins [17]. In addition, extracts of the fenugreek seeds are characterized by high phenolic acids and flavonoid contents exhibiting antioxidant activity [18]. Moreover, fenugreek seeds contain vital bioactive ingredients such as coumarin, folic acid, nicotinic acid, phytic acid, scopoletin, saponin, and trigonelline which have various therapeutic and medicinal properties [19].\nThis study aims to assess positive or negative influences of different concentrations of ZnO NPs on biomass, some biochemical and molecular characteristics of fenugreek plant."

            "text": "Nanoparticles can be used as plant fertilizers to make nutrients bioavailability in a controlled manner so that they are only absorbed by the plant and are not lost to the surrounding environment including soil, water, and associated microorganisms [32]. Zinc oxide nanofertilizers exhibited preferable and promising results in enhancing seed germination and promoting healthy seedlings [33].\nOur findings showed that the soaking of fenugreek seeds in different ZnO NPs concentrations was considerably effective and promoted the growth, and this was dose dependent. Both fresh and dry weights were increased in all plants treated with different ZnO NPs concentrations, except at 50\u00a0mg/l which revealed a nonsignificant decrease in dry weight, compared to the control. This increase can be certified with the tendency of ZnO NPs to penetrate seed testa and improve the Zn use efficiency as an essential micronutrient leading to increase seedling growth [34, 35]. In agreement with our obtained results, Atteya et\u00a0 al. [36] and Gheith et\u00a0 al. [37] stated that zinc\ntreatment promoted growth and yield parameters of jojoba and maize plants. They also observed the enhancing effect of nanoparticles for plant growth and yield in peanut at lower doses. In addition, Zn NPs were found to improve the length, leaf protein, and dry mass of Pearl Millet (Pennisetum americanum) plant [38, 39]. On the other hand, Liu et\u00a0al. [40] stated that high concentrations of ZnO NPs can inhibit germination, biomass, and photosynthesis of plants. This may explain the decrease of dry weight at 50\u00a0mg/l Zno NPs.\nThe application of ZnO NPs significantly affected the assessed total proteins and total carbohydrate of fenugreek seedlings. The total soluble protein and carbohydrate contents increased simultaneously with increasing the nanoparticle dose and reached the maximum at 30\u00a0mg/l while dropped slightly following treatment with 40 and 50\u00a0mg/l ZnO NP. These findings agree with Rao et\u00a0 al. [41] and Zhao et\u00a0 al. [42] who declared that nanofertilizers have a pronounced influence on carbohydrates biosynthesis in leaves and can modify protein content of plants. In addition, the ZnO NPs at lower concentrations increased the total soluble protein and carbohydrate contents in various plant species such as cluster bean [11], green pea [43],\nmaize [44], and bell peppers [45]. These findings are compatible with the fact that zinc at definite concentrations is vital for structural and catalytic constituents of proteins and enzymes as cofactors which are essential for normal plant growth and development [46].\nExposure of fenugreek seeds to ZnO NPs at different concentrations affected positively on the seedling contents of flavonoids and phenols, with a highest increase at 30\u00a0 mg/l. Also, Uresti-Porras et\u00a0 al. [45] found that bell peppers treated with ZnO NPs at concentrations of 30\u00a0mg/l revealed a significant increase in total phenolic compounds over the control. In addition, Mohammadghasemi et\u00a0 al. [47] concluded that nanofertilizers improved total phenolic and total flavonoid contents in Lallemantia iberica when compared with the control. Moreover, Zn nanofertilizer was found to increase the polyphenols content in cotton and soybean crops [48, 49]. These improvements may be in line for the\nessential role of zinc in the carbon allocation to biosynthesize phenolic compounds in shikimic acid and acetate pathways [50].\nThe DPPH has been widely used to estimate the antioxidant activity of plant extracts via testing the ability of compounds to scavenge free radical or donate hydrogen [51]. In the present study, all tested ZnO NP concentrations increased the yield of total DPPH over the untreated control plants. No significant differences were observed between 10, 20, 40, and 50\u00a0 mg/l Zno NPs treatments, while 30\u00a0 mg/l revealed the highest DPPH activity. This agrees with Salachna et\u00a0al. [52] who found that exposure to ZnO NPs at low concentration improved the total polyphenols content, antioxidant activity, and DPPH activity with respective to the control in Perilla (Perilla frutescens (L.)) plant. In addition, Thapa et\u00a0al. [53] stated that the total antioxidant activity (TAA), DPPH, and flavonoid contents increased in\nmung bean (Vigna radiata) plants treated with zinc sulfide nanoparticle. Moreover, Weisany et\u00a0al. [48] concluded that nanofertilizers improve the antioxidant capacity and DPPH scavenging in rice.\nGlutathione content increased in all treatments of ZnO NPs and peaked at 30\u00a0 mg/l compared with the control. This agrees with Riaz et\u00a0al. [54] who found that SiNPs increased glutathione content in wheat. In addition, Jurkow et\u00a0 al. [55] found that foliar application of Au-NPs and Pt-NPs on oakleaf lettuce seedlings leads to an increase in glutathione (GSH) content. Moreover, the genes involved in glutathione biosynthetic were upregulated in Arabidopsis thaliana plants treated with 0.2\u20131\u00a0mg/l Ag-NPs [56].\nLipid peroxidation acts as a symptom of membrane degradation under stress conditions and is positively related with MDA content [57]. In this study, the content of MDA, as an oxidative stress index, in plants treated with 10, 20, or 30\u00a0mg/l of ZnO NPs did not significantly differ from the control. However, the higher\nconcentrations of ZnO NPs, 40 and 50\u00a0 mg/l, significantly increased MDA content. Also, Singh et\u00a0 al. [58] stated that ZnO NPs at higher concentration provoked the ROS production causing oxidative damage that increases MDA content in chickpea plants. In spite of the vital role of zinc in protection and stabilization of the biological membranes against integrity loss and permeability alteration and oxidative stress, the higher doses of ZnO NPs may damage this membrane via enhancing ROS mechanism that produces oxidative stress [59].\nSCoT markers were implemented to detect the genomic changes that occurred in the fenugreek seedling upon exposure to different doses of ZnO NPs. The SCoT banding patterns pertaining to the impact of ZnO NPs show limited genetic variations between the ZnO NPs treatments and the control plants. A possible reason for these limited genomic changes in ZnO NPs-treated plants could be attributed to lower levels of ZnO NPs that had been tested."
