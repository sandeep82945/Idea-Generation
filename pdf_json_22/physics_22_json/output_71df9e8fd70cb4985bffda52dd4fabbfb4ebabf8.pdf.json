INTRODUCTION\nRecent trends in condensed matter research revolves a lot around topology1\u20133 and at the heart of this topological condensed matter field lies the recently developed Weyl semimetal (WSM)4\u201310 - the materials that feature Weyl fermions in momentum space in the form of Berry curvatures with monopoles11. These materials show high electron mobility and magnetoresistances12. But similarly interesting is its response to electromagnetic fields. With electric and magnetic field in three dimension, such materials display the exotic phenomena called Adler-BellJackiw chiral anomaly4\u201310,13\u201315. It refers to the nonconservation of chiral charges in individual Weyl nodes of the Weyl semimetals when non-orthogonal electric and magnetic fields are applied in such systems. This causes a positive longitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC) that goes as B2 for small magnetic field B14,16,17. It also results in planar Hall effect (PHE) if there are in-planar non-parallel electric and magnetic fields16,17. Even with a magnetic field alone, such systems can show chiral magnetic effect4,18,19 where simple derivation using Boltzmann transport equation16\u201321 (BTE) shows a chiral current proportional to the chemical potential difference at the opposite-chirality Weyl nodes.\nIt has been found that it is due to the Berry curvature that the semiclassical equations of motion gets modified incorporating additional terms amounting to anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnetic effect and chiral anomaly. Considering a simple time reversal breaking (TRB) two-node WSM and applying BTE around each of those nodes, one can get the equation of continuity involving number density for charge carriers N\u00b1 and current j\u00b1 as18,19\n\u2202N\u00b1/\u2202t+\u2207r.j\u00b1 = c\u00b1 e2\n4\u03c02 E.B (1)\nwhere N\u00b1 = \u222b\u221e \u2212\u221e d \u03c1 \u00b1( )f\u00b1( , r, t) and j\u00b1 = \u222b d3p (2\u03c0)3 [v+ eE \u00d7 \u2126\u00b1 + ec\u2126 \u00b1.vB]f\u00b1(p, r, t). Here denotes dispersion energy and E and B denote the electric and\nmagnetic fields respectively. Also \u03c1\u00b1( ) = \u222b\nd3p (2\u03c0)3 (1 +\ne cB.\u2126 \u00b1)\u03b4( p \u2212 ) denote the density of states, f\u00b1 the Fermi distribution function, \u2126 the Berry curvature and c\u00b1 = 12\u03c0 \u222b dS.\u2126\u00b1 denote the Chern numbers at the \u00b1 Weyl nodes. This leads to\n\u2202(N+ \u2212N\u2212)/\u2202t+\u2207r.(j+ \u2212 j\u2212) = e2\n2\u03c02 E.B (2)\nwhich is essentially the chiral current nonconservation due to chiral anomaly. We consider chemical potential to be away from Weyl nodes, i.e., \u00b5 >> kBT, h\u0304\u03c9c (\u03c9c = eB/m). The scattering is considered to be elastic and the collision integral Icoll depends on elastic relaxation times \u03c4intr and \u03c4inter (for intra and inter node scattering respectively). For \u03c4intr << \u03c4inter, the electron distribution function around WP\u2019s depend on alone18 and considering homogeneity of the system a relaxation time approximation is adopted in the scattering integral involving \u03c4inter (= \u03c4 , say) alone\n18. In presence of small/weak fields, Landau quantization gets wiped out16,17 and the Boltzmann formalism remains sufficient to describe the magneto-transport. This results in negative magnetoresistances in the WSMs due to the chiral anomaly which has been widely reported from experiments as well26,27. The longitudinal magnetoresistance LMR = \u03c1xx(B)\u2212\u03c1xx(0)\u03c1xx(0) \u00d7 100% becomes negative when resistivity \u03c1xx(B) (or conductivity \u03c3\nxx) decreases (increases) with B, where x denotes the longitudinal direction (i.e., along E). The anomaly related longitudinal magnetoconductance shows positive B2 dependence in a two node WSM when B||E and normal to the Weyl node directions16. The corresponding contribution to the anomaly related LMR remains negative in presence of Berry curvature \u2126p and does not cancel out even when opposite chirality nodes are enclosed in a single Fermi surface20. However, LMC shows a linear B dependence if E, B are directed along the nodes or tilt direction16,17. It thus needs thorough investigation on the exact behavior of LMC in terms of B at an arbitrary longitudinal orientation. ar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n03 73\n1v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 8\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2 In light irradiated systems, the fields can change orientation as well as strengths with time. And it\u2019s important to analyze the magnetoconductivities in those situations. In this paper, we consider a periodic variation of fields and study their effect on the magneto-transport. Notice that the LMC in an untilted WSM with x\u0302 being the longitudinal direction can be expressed17 as\n\u03c3xx = \u03c3 + \u2206\u03c3cos2\u03b8eb (3)\n\u03c3yxphe = \u2206\u03c3sin\u03b8ebcos\u03b8eb\nwhere \u03b8eb is the angle between E and B field and \u2206\u03c3 \u221d B2. Thus if we have a B \u223c cos(\u03c9t) dependence, the LMC shows temporal fluctuations but it never becomes negative. But for \u2206\u03c3 \u221d B, one can certainly have a negative LMC. One can also have oppositely directed PHE depending on the field orientations. With tilting such simple relations get modified and a negative LMC can be observed at small fields depending on the values of tilt parameter and Fermi energy. There the magneto-transport also shows nontrivial features if \u03b8eb possess time dependence in addition. This paper deals with various of such possibilities and investigate closely the features of chiral anomaly induced conductivities in WSM systems in presence of time periodic fields.\nIn section II, we formulate the continuum Hamiltonian for a two-node WSM and the general expressions for LMC and PHE. In section III, we consider irradiation via circularly polarized laser onto such systems in addition to a dc electric field and we discuss the results on magnetoconductivities in detail. Finally in section IV, we summarize our findings and discuss their utilities and drawbacks and possible future directions."

We only consider a type I WSM for which |C| < 1. Once we introduce electric field E and small magnetic field B in this system, chiral flow (and hence anomaly) develops. We keep our E and B fields in the x\u2212z plane to study LMC and PHE. First of all we need to probe whether low B LMC shows a linear B dependence due to tilt in the system. Using relaxation time approximation one can write \u03c3L (L stands for longitudinal and indicates direction parallel to current, which will be along the nodal axes) as17\n\u03c3L = e 2\u03c4 \u2211 s \u222b d3k (2\u03c0)3 {D[vL + eB cos\u03b8eb h\u0304 v.\u2126]2(\u2212\u2202feq \u2202 )(5)\nHere \u2126 = \u2212s kk3 is the Berry curvature, D = [1+ e h\u0304B.\u2126]\n\u22121\nis the phase space factor, feq is the equilibrium distribution function and vL = \u2202 /\u2202kL with dispersion\nm(E ,B )m\n(a)\nWP at k =\u2212Q WP at k =+Q\nk\nz z\nz\nE0\n\u00b1 = \u00b1h\u0304v \u221a k2x + k 2 y + (k s z) 2 + h\u0304vsCksz for conduction (+)\nand valence (-) bands respectively. We focus only on the conduction band and call = +. We see the vL does not depend on C if the direction of E is normal to the nodal axes or z\u0302 direction. Additionally if B has nonzero component along E (i.e., \u03b8eb 6= \u03c0/2), \u03c3L grows quadratically with B. But if E = Ez\u0302 and \u03b8eb 6= \u03c0/2, it is only at nonzero tilting, the linear in B term survives and dominates for small B values.\nNow let\u2019s take a look at the planar Hall conductivity \u03c3phe (with both E and B in the xz plane). This is given as \u03c3phe = e2\u03c4 \u2211 s \u222b d3k (2\u03c0)3 D[vLv\u22a5 + eB h\u0304 (vLsin\u03b8eb + v\u22a5cos\u03b8eb)\n\u2217 v.\u2126 + e 2B2\nh\u03042 sin\u03b8ebcos\u03b8eb(v.\u2126) 2](\u2212\u2202feq \u2202 ). (6)\nIt implies a B2 dependence unless \u03b8eb = 0, \u03c0/2 when a linear B dependence is observed in \u03c3phe.\nIII. IRRADIATION VIA EM WAVE WITH CIRCULAR POLARIZATION\nWe find that a combination of dc and ac electric field can produce interesting time dependent magnetoconductivity phenomena in simple two-node WSM systems. The longitudinal direction being the electric field direction, it changes periodically and the chiral anomaly effect causes conductivities to change accordingly with tilting being another major tuning parameter.\nIn our set up, we first consider a large static electric field E = E\u03020 = E0x\u0302. Then the such system is exposed to irradiation via a circularly polarized light with\n3 an electric field E = Em(sin\u03c9t, 0, cos\u03c9t) and a magnetic field Bm(cos\u03c9t, 0,\u2212sin\u03c9t) which are interrelated via Maxwell\u2019s equations as Em = cBm (see Fig.1). When Em/E0 << 1, we can call x\u0302 direction to be the longitudinal direction and accordingly the temporal variation of \u03c3L and \u03c3phe can be shown to be a periodic function. But in general we call \u03b8L = tan \u22121 Emcos(\u03c9t)\nE0+Emsin(\u03c9t) to de-\nnote the longitudinal direction (i.e., the direction of E from x\u0302 axis) and study the periodic variation of LMC with time, particularly for C 6= 0. We take E0 to be 10 gigavolt/m and usually vary Bm from 0-5 T. Such alternating fields can be provided by irradiation via intense lasers (with intensity upto \u223c 1019 W/cm2)22 and are often used for comparison with Floquet theory based calculations23\u201325. In this paper, the fields Bm and conductivities \u03c3L and \u03c3\nphe are obtained in units of Tesla and Siemens/meter respectively. With tilting, the dispersion becomes = h\u0304vk(1 + sCcos\u03b8). Thus the velocity components become vk = v(1 + sCcos\u03b8) and v\u03b8 = \u2212vsCsin\u03b8 with v = vkk\u0302 + v\u03b8 \u03b8\u0302 where k\u0302 = sin\u03b8cos\u03c6x\u0302+ sin\u03b8sin\u03c6y\u0302 + cos\u03b8z\u0302 and \u03b8\u0302 = cos\u03b8cos\u03c6x\u0302 + cos\u03b8sin\u03c6y\u0302 \u2212 sin\u03b8z\u0302 in a spherical coordinate system. The Longitudinal direction can be given as L\u0302 = cos\u03b8Lx\u0302 + sin\u03b8Lz\u0302 (and the transverse direction \u22a5\u0302 = \u2212sin\u03b8Lx\u0302 + cos\u03b8Lz\u0302). This makes vL = v.L\u0302 = v[cos\u03b8Lsin\u03b8cos\u03c6 + sin\u03b8L(cos\u03b8 + sC)] and similarly v\u22a5 = v[\u2212sin\u03b8Lsin\u03b8cos\u03c6 + cos\u03b8L(cos\u03b8 + sC)]. The magnetic field direction is given by \u03b8B = \u2212\u03c9t and \u03b8eb = \u03b8L \u2212 \u03b8B = \u03b8L + \u03c9t. With C, the x and z components of velocity becomes vx = v.x\u0302 = vsin(\u03b8)cos(\u03c6) and similarly vz = v(cos\u03b8 + sC). In addition, we get v.\u2126 = \u2212(1 + sCcos\u03b8)sv/k2.\nNow these are the expressions when the static field E\u03020 = E0x\u0302. We also consider the case where the static field orients along nodal direction, i.e., E = E0z\u0302. This alters the longitudinal orientation causing \u03b8L = tan\u22121E0+Emcos(\u03c9t)Emsin(\u03c9t) . The other expressions for conductivities, however, remain the same functions of \u03b8L."

Note that the large field Bm = 10 T is shown here only for demonstration purpose and not used henceforth in the paper. \u03b8eb being time dependent, the response on conductivities often become nontrivial.\nIn the following we show and describe the variations of \u03c3L with Bm (Fig.3), C (Fig.4) and \u03c9t (Fig.5). The results depend on the Fermi energy \u00b5. With \u00b5=1 eV, and for the large E0 considered, \u03c3L increases with B at C = 0 but as tilting is turned on and increased, we see that even for very small nonzero tilting, \u03c3L reverses the trend and start decreasing with B implying a positive magnetoresistance, though all these changes are marginal compared to the magnitude of \u03c3L (see Fig.3).

This is because the spectrum depends on C and so does the integral in Eq.5. We find that \u03c3L increases with tilting with a higher rate as one reaches C \u2192 1 (see Fig.4). Also for C 6= 0, its dependence on \u03c9t diminishes more and more with large E0/Em considered (see Fig.5).\nA follow up with dispersion results from WSM materials like TaAs, TaP , NbAs or NbP 6,28,29 reveal that 1 eV is large enough for a linear \u2212k relation. So we check our results for a smaller \u00b5 = 0.1 eV as well. And our results shows similar behavior though the magnetoconductance become negative only for C \u223c 1 (see Fig.6).\nNext we consider E\u03020 to be along the z\u0302 direction. There the variation of \u03c3L with Bm does not show negative magnetoconductance anymore. We find linear increase in \u03c3L with Bm for small fields at \u00b5 = 1 eV. But it actually depends on the relative strength of linear and quadratic terms of Eq.5. For \u00b5 = 0.1 eV, we see the the quadratic term dominates over the linear term and the linear variation of \u03c3L is not discernible within the window of 1T - 5T for Bm that is shown in Fig.7.

That way one can observe the variations of magnetoconductivities with time or the time dependent field B(t) and this can be easily designed in labs for comparison purpose. In Fig.10, we have shown such variations for \u00b5 = 1 and 0.1 eV where we took \u03b1 = \u03c9 numerically. Notice that in absence of magnetic field at t = 0, there is no chiral anomaly. In this linear response theory, \u03c3L doesn\u2019t depend on the strength of E0 but depends on its direction. We see that \u03c3L increases if the orientation of the static field changes from nodal direction z\u0302 (with \u03b8L = \u03c0/2) to the normal direction x\u0302 (with \u03b8L = 0). Then for t 6= 0, the system witnesses fluctuating behavior in \u03c3L. In Fig.10 bottom-panels, we show how LMC (which is \u03c3L(B)\u2212\u03c3L(B=0)\u03c3L(B=0) \u00d7100%) can become positive and negative (for E0 6= 0) depending on the strength of B(t). Particularly for small energies, for example with \u00b5 = 0.1 eV, negative LMC can be clearly observed only when the static field acts along z\u0302 (or, has nonzero components along it). Thus we can easily tune the system from the nontrivial positive LMC regime to trivial negative LMC regime and vice versa."

We consider \u00b5 = 1 eV (top-left) and \u00b5 = 0.1 eV (top-right) respectively. Corresponding LMCs are shown in bottom-left (\u00b5 = 1 eV) and bottom-right (\u00b5 = 0.1 eV) panels respectively.\nities. Our field set up causes continuous change in \u03b8eb with time that leads to nontrivial changes in the conductivities. Unlike in metals, LMC in WSM usually take positive values. But here we find negative LMCs as well for few finite tilting parameter regime within the typeI tilting limit. Longitudinal conductivity variation with field shows linear or quadratic dependences depending on C or Bm values as well as on Fermi level \u00b5. Similar results are reported for planar Hall conductivities as well. In this paper we also propose a temporal variations in ac field amplitudes where the field strengths are gradually turned on with time. This can be easily designed in experimental labs and its nontrivial outcomes of magnetoconductivities can be tested and then utilized to serve many purposes. In Fig.10, one witnesses the fluctuating behavior of \u03c3L when the time dependent field strength is turned on gradually. Though there are many studies of magneto-transport in Weyl systems under periodic driving23,30,31, the present study uses a combination of dc and ac fields which is first of its kind, as per the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge. Based on this preliminary results and discussions, one can always build up further understanding incorporating additional complexities like using fully anisotropic BTE for considering anisotropy due to coupling between B and \u212632,33, considering the effect of intra-node scattering34 or incorporating the orbital magnetic moments34,35 etc. Dynamics of our periodically driven problem can be analyzed using adiabaticimpulse approximation or Floquet formalisms for small and high frequency quenches respectively23,30,36. One can also probe the thermal and Nernst conductivities un-\n6 der the same field set up23,37 or investigate the response from multi-Weyl systems23,30,37,38. We should mention here that the tendency of \u03c3L to become singular as C \u2192 1 is an artifact of using the continuum model and we have plans to later use a more realistic lattice model possibly incorporating beyond nearest-neighbor electron hoppings and reinvestigate this problem. This will also enable us the study the response from a type-II WSM system17."
