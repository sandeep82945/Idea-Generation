 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate recovery rates and detection limits for smaller microplastics (<20 μm) using more advanced microscopy techniques like SEM or TEM. The current methods are limited to particles >20 μm.

2. Apply the developed extraction protocol and QA/QC measures to other complex sample matrices like soils, sediments, or biological tissues to expand capabilities.

3. Conduct a more in-depth characterization of microplastics extracted from sewage sludge using additional analytical techniques like pyrolysis-GC/MS or Raman spectroscopy. 

4. Evaluate the impact of different wastewater and sludge treatment processes on microplastic retention and composition in sludge. This could help optimize removal.

5. Conduct fate and transport studies tracking microplastics from wastewater through sludge treatment into the environment when sludge is applied on land. This could identify key transfer points.
