 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper on insurance demand against low-probability risks:

1. Examine how different ways of presenting and framing probability information influences insurance demand. The paper found providing explicit probability information increased willingness-to-pay, but more research could be done on optimal ways to communicate small probabilities.

2. Investigate the impact of past disaster experiences on insurance demand over time. The paper found demand decreasing over time, so studying how direct or indirect disaster experiences shape risk perceptions and insurance demand could provide insight. 

3. Test the effectiveness of different educational interventions for improving insurance literacy and willingness-to-pay. The paper concludes outreach is needed, so testing tools like simulations, videos, or virtual reality on insurance comprehension could be useful.

4. Analyze cultural and socioeconomic differences in demand across more countries beyond those studied. The paper found interesting differences across China, Germany and Netherlands, so expanding the cultural analysis to other regions could further knowledge.

5. Develop and validate a theoretical model integrating both economic and psychological factors driving insurance demand. The paper uses meta-analysis, but a conceptual model combining risk aversion, probability weighting, loss aversion and other factors could advance understanding.
