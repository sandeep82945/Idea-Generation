Pavlov, Faculty Of Clinical Psychology, Ryazan, Russian Federation *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1256\nIntroduction: Dysfunctional breathing is a breathing patterns that do not correspond to the physiological needs of the body, provoke many poly-systemic symptoms. Dysfunctional breathing is experienced as a feeling of \u201cdifficulty in breathing\u201d, which in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic may be similar to the symptoms of coronavirus infection (Taverne et al., 2021). Objectives: To examine the role of socio-demographic predictors in the prevalence of dysfunctional breathing in the Russian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The author\u2019s socio-demographic questionnaire, the Naimigen Questionnaire (Van Dixhoorn, Duivenvoordent, 1985), the STAI (Spielberger et al., 1983) and the \u201cPerceived Stress Scale-10\u201d (Cohen,Kamarck,Mermelstein,1983) were used. The study was conducted online fromApril 27 toDecember 28, 2020. Itwas attended by 1,362 people from all regions of Russia (38.3 11.4 y.o.). Results: In men, the average values for NQ (11.19 7.74) are lower than among women (18.73 9.96, p=0.000). Persons with incomplete higher education have a higher score on NQ (N=103,NQ=20.44 11.8) than persons with higher education (N=1051,NQ= 17.40 9.63,p=0.048) and candidates/doctors of sciences (N=97,NQ= 15.34 11.20,p=0.005). There was also a connection between the severity of dysfunctional breathing and the level of income, which is associated with a negative correlation between income level and perception of stress (r=-0.215,p=0.000), state (r=-0.165,p=0.000) and trait anxiety (r=-0.127,p=0.000). Conclusions: The severity of dysfunctional breathing is associated with gender, income levels and education, what can be used to identify a group of people who are most susceptible to the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing during the pandemic COVID-19.

Prouzou1, E. Aslani2, V. Spinaris3 and G. Lyrakos1,3* 1City Unity College, Psychology, Athens, Greece; 2General Hospital Nikaia Ag. Panteleimon, 2nd Covid Clinic, Nikaia, Greece and 3General Hospital of Nikaia, Psychiatric, Nikaia, Greece *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1257\nIntroduction: All pandemic outbreaks because of their rapid spread and highmortality rate cause to everyone considerable stress and anxiety. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to investigate how news media exposure moderates the relationship between stress, anxiety, depression and self-efficacy, social support, knowledge of the coronavirus and coronavirus perception. Methods: 223 healthcare providers, men 46 (20.6%) and women 177 (79.4%), working in hospitals in Greece participated in the study. independent t-test, one-way ANOVAs, Pearson\u2019s correlation, multiple-linear regression and moderator\u2019s analysis were analyzed with SPSS23. Results: Organization support, friends support, covid-19 knowledge and covid-19 perception are most significant predictors to stress, F (4,218) = 11.47, p < .001 and Adjusted R2- .159. Friends support, covid-19 knowledge and self-efficacy, working with covid19 patients and gender are most significant predictors to anxiety, F (5,217) = 11.16, p < .001 Adjusted R2- .186. Friends support, covid-19 knowledge and self-efficacy and organization support are most significant predictors to depression, F (4,218) = 16.37, p < .001 Adjusted R2-squared: .217. News media exposure did moderate the predictive power of almost all predictors for stress, anxiety and depression, at p<.05. Conclusions: Therefore, the study verifies previous findings arguing that stress, anxiety and depression are strongly associated with numerous factors. These associations seem to be moderated by news media exposure. It is recommended to further explore the impact news media exposure has during crucial periods, such as covid-19 outbreak.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

V.Serbsky Russian Federation Ministry of Health, Head Of Department Of Preventive Care In Narcology, Moscow, Russian Federation *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1258\nIntroduction: Excessive alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for various mental health disorders and can exacerbate the already high burden of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic itself can adversely affect alcohol consumption and thus contribute to alcohol-related problems, including mental health problems. Objectives: This study was aimed to assess changes in alcohol consumption that may have occurred as a result of the COVID19pandemic and determine associated factors among population of Russian Federation. Methods: By distributing a link to take part in an anonymous online survey,changes in volume and frequency of alcohol use,and frequency of heavy episodic drinking(6 or more servings of alcohol at a time)in the first months of COVID-19pandemic were assessed. 819respondents from Russia:321 men and 498women, submitted their responses duringMay-July,2020. Associations between changes in alcohol use were assessed in a univariate analysis with socio-demographic factors,alcohol use over the previous 12months,stress, individual perceptions of changes in daily and social life and other negative consequences of pandemic. The statistical significance of associations was assessed using the Pearson\u2019s\u03c72 test. Results: Individuals with initially higher alcohol consumption increased their alcohol use, while those who drank less, decreased alcohol use even more during pandemic (p<0.05). Severe restrictions of social/everyday life were associated with more frequent alcohol use and in larger volumes (p<0.001). Negative professional/ financial consequences of pandemic and stress were associated with increase of typical drinking volume (p<0.001), more frequent alcohol use (p<0.001)and heavy episodic drinking (p<0.05). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic could have increased health inequalities in Russia through changes in alcohol consumption.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Here, an asymptomatic adolescent female developed acute onset catatonia and psychosis manifesting during the resolution of Covid-19 infection. Objectives: Discuss differential diagnosis, medical workup, and initial treatment optimization for acute stabilization. Methods: This 15-year-old female with no previous psychiatric history nor prodromal symptomatology was hospitalized secondary to Covid -19. During the immediate three-month recovery phase following resolution of Covid-19, the patient exhibited gradually increasing anxiety, paranoia, delusions, disorganized behavior, and weight loss leading to re-hospitalization secondary to catatonia. Negative workup included rapid strep test, urinalysis, chest and abdominal x-ray, EEG, and brainMRI. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated WBC of 18 but was unremarkable for NDMA receptor antibodies, CSF HSV, and encephalitis panel. IV steroids, IVIG, and Anakinra were all given without benefit. Inadequate response to olanzapine, clonidine, and lorazepam led to an Index Series of bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Results: The provisional diagnosis of psychotic disorder secondary to COVID-19 infection responded robustly regarding sleep, behavior, and affect by session #6, yet positive symptoms of psychosis persist. Ongoing ECT, psychopharmacology, and narrowing of the differential diagnosis continue. Conclusions: As more COVID-19 cases evolve during the pandemic, potential post-infectious neuropsychiatric complications should be considered as potentially contributory and kept in a thoughtful differential diagnosis. Regardless of ultimate causation, the acute symptom profile responded robustly to an initial Index Series of ECT.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
