    "abstractText": "Introduction: Single-delay Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)-based spatial coefficient of variation (CoVCBF) has been suggested as a measure of hemodynamic disturbance in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. However, spatial CoVCBF and other histogram-based parameters such as skewness and kurtosis and the volume of the arterial transit time artefact (ATAvol), has not been evaluated in patients with MMD nor against cerebrovascular reserve (CVR). The aim of this study was to assess whether any associations between spatial CoVCBF, skewness, kurtosis, and ATAvol are present and to analyze any potential associations with CVR, derived from single-delay ASL in patients with MMD.",

However, spatial CoVCBF and other histogram-based parameters such as skewness and kurtosis and the volume of the arterial transit time artefact (ATAvol), has not been evaluated in patients with MMD nor against cerebrovascular reserve (CVR). The aim of this study was to assess whether any associations between spatial CoVCBF, skewness, kurtosis, and ATAvol are present and to analyze any potential associations with CVR, derived from single-delay ASL in patients with MMD.\nMethods: Fifteen MMD patients were included before or after revascularization surgery. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were acquired using pseudo-continuous ASL before, and 5, 15, and 25 min after an intravenous acetazolamide injection. CVRmax was defined as the highest percentual increase in CBF at any of the three post-injection time points. A vascular territory template was spatially normalized to each patient, including the bilateral anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries. All affected anterior and middle cerebral artery regions and all unaffected posterior cerebral artery regions were included, based on Suzuki grading by digital subtraction angiography.\nResults: Significant differences between affected and unaffected regions were found for CBF, CVRmax, and ATAvol. No association was found between CVRmax and any other parameter. High correlations were found between spatial CoVCBF, skewness and ATAvol.\nConclusion: Spatial CoVCBF derived from single-delay ASL does not correlate with CVR in patients with MMD. Moreover, skewness and kurtosis did not provide additional information of clinical value.\nKEYWORDS\nMoyamoya, arterial spin label (ASL) MRI, spatial coefficient of variation, cerebrovascular reserve, arterial transit time artefact (ATA)"

            "text": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disease characterized by steno-occlusion at the arteries centered on the terminal portion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (1). The steno-occlusive lesion will cause a progressive decline in cerebral perfusion pressure affecting regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). To compensate, the brain will increase the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and dilate resistance arteries to increase CBF and meet the cerebral metabolic demand. Cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) reflects the remaining possible vasodilation and is an important predictor of ischaemic events and prognostic factor for patients with MMD, and can be\u00a0assessed by measuring CBF before and after administration of acetazolamide (ACZ) (2, 3). In parallel, collaterals from, e.g., the circle of Willis, the ophthalmic artery and leptomeningeal vessels are developed, including the so-called basal Moyamoya vessels (4).\nArterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR)-based method to acquire perfusion-weighted data that can be\u00a0computed into parametric images of CBF with known clinical potential in several cerebral disorders (5). The spatial coefficient of variation (CoVCBF) of CBF images (i.e., standard deviation divided by the average CBF for a given region-of-interest) derived from single post-label delay (PLD) ASL acquisition has been evaluated as a measure of hemodynamic disturbance in patients with different cerebrovascular diseases (6\u201311). This was first proposed by Mutsaerts et\u00a0al. in 2017 building on the inherent dependency of single PLD ASL on the arterial transit time (ATT) and demonstrated a high correlation between spatial CoVCBF and ATT measured with FEAST (9), a relationship that was further confirmed by Ibaraki et\u00a0al. (7). When ATT exceeds PLD for a given ASL acquisition, the incomplete arrival of the ASL signal will lead to artefacts characterized by reduced ASL signal in tissue in combination with high intravascular ASL signal (arterial transit time artefact, ATA) (9, 12).\nHence, in a region-of-interest with long ATT, the distribution of CBF values is broadened and consequently the standard deviation of the average CBF in the region-of-interest will increase (see Figure\u00a01). Thus, spatial CoVCBF will be\u00a0 higher in regions with longer ATT compared to regions with normal ATT.\nAnother approach is to analyse the distribution of CBF values in the vascular territory using histogram analysis. Skewness is a measure of lack of symmetry of a given distribution and is zero for a normally distributed dataset, whereas kurtosis is a measure of whether the distribution is heavy-tailed or light-tailed and is 3 for a normally distributed dataset. Visually and theoretically, it is clear that in regions with long ATT the histogram is positively skewed towards low CBF values with the right tail corresponding to abnormally high CBF values due to intravascular ATA as shown in Figure\u00a01 (7, 13). The presence of intravascular ATA has been used as a visual collateral grading scale in patients with MMD thus indicating clinical potential (12). Furthermore, subregions of intravascular ATAs can be\u00a0defined by carefully selecting a cut-off value of the right tail and can be\u00a0quantified as a volume (denoted ATAvol) (13). Considering the apparent relationship between spatial CoVCBF, ATAvol, and histogrambased parameters skewness and kurtosis, these parameters may show further potential as a measure of hemodynamic disturbance in comparison to spatial CoVCBF.\nIn light of the clinical potential of spatial CoVCBF, Hara et\u00a0al. (6) concluded that spatial CoVCBF may help identify increased OEF in affected regions in patients with MMD. Furthermore, associations\nbetween increased OEF and decreased CVR have been demonstrated (14, 15). As such, there may exist a relationship between spatial CoVCBF and CVR which, if confirmed, suggests that spatial CoVCBF could replace CVR as a biomarker for hemodynamic disturbance in patients with MMD and no ACZ injection would be\u00a0necessary.\nThe aim of this study was to assess any potential associations between spatial CoVCBF and CVR in patients with MMD, and to assess whether histogram-based parameters show equal or higher potential as measures of hemodynamic disturbance in comparison to spatial CoVCBF."

Grading was based on MRA in two patients. Vascular regions of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were included as affected vascular regions if Suzuki grading was higher than 0 and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was included as unaffected vascular region if Suzuki grading was 0.

In short, CE-T1WI images were segmented into grey matter probability maps (pGM). The deformation field defining the transformation from patient-space to MNI space was derived based on each patient\u2019s CE-T1WI image using SPM12\u2019s Normalise routine. A vascular template defined in MNI space was transformed to patient-specific space using the inverse deformation field including vascular regions of ACA, MCA, and PCA. All vascular regions were up-sampled to match the resolution of the CE-T1WI image applying nearest neighbour interpolation and masked with the corresponding pGM map.\nAll ASL control/label pairs were corrected for possible motion. Perfusion-weighted and M0 images were then rigid-body registered to the patient\u2019s pGM map. Quantification of CBF was performed using a single compartment model (5). Partial volume correction was performed by the method described by Asllani et\u00a0al. (18). CBF images were up-sampled to match the resolution of the CE-T1WI image applying trilinear interpolation.\nAn in-house developed Matlab script imported CBF images and extracted masked vascular regional values of mean CBF, standard deviation (SD), kurtosis and skewness and calculated CVR (as defined by Eq.

The cut-off was calculated as median CBF + 3 times the median absolute difference (17). The volume, given in cm3, was calculated as the total number of pixels above the cut-off multiplied by the CBF image resolution (see Figure\u00a01).

            "text": "The current study demonstrates that associations between CVR and spatial CoVCBF, histogram-based parameters and ATAvol are negligible in vascular regions in patients with MMD. Moreover, CBF, CVRmax, and ATAvol demonstrated significant differences between affected and unaffected vascular regions.\nPoorer CVR is expected in affected regions compared to unaffected regions. The difference was higher between MCA and PCA, compared to between ACA and PCA, which can be\u00a0attributed to MCA being the more affected territory by steno-occlusions.\nIbaraki et\u00a0 al. (7) and Mutsaerts et\u00a0 al. (8) found significant differences in spatial CoVCBF between contralateral and ipsilateral MCA/ICA regions in patients with unilateral steno-occlusive disorder. Only two out of 15 included patients in the present study had unilateral disease, and hence, a similar comparison was not performed because of few data points. However, we\u00a0did not find any significant difference between affected (MCA or ACA) and unaffected regions\nFIGURE\u00a03 Scatter dot plots for all parameters included in the statistical analysis with average and standard deviation for each vascular region. p-value style: <0.05 (*), <0.01 (**), <0.001 (***), and <0.0001 (****). Exact p-values are presented in Supplementary Table S4.\nFrontiers in Neurology 06 frontiersin.org\n(PCA). Of note, the posterior circulation is known to be\u00a0slower than the anterior, (19) which in theory could add to the heterogenization of the ASL tracer arrival in PCA regions, thus contributing to a higher spatial CoVCBF compared to healthy MCA/ICA regions. Still, we\u00a0used a PLD of 2,500 ms, which should reduce this effect as shown by Hara et\u00a0al. (6). Neither Tortora et\u00a0al. (10) and Hara et\u00a0al. (6) included spatial CoVCBF from unaffected regions or similar in their analysis of patients with MMD, making comparisons to the present study difficult.\nLarge differences between ATAvol in affected and unaffected regions were found. ATAvol was not zero within PCA which can be\u00a0attributed to a slower posterior CBF circulation, i.e., prolonged ATT which can contribute to pixels being defined as intravascular ATAs. Of note, stratification between affected and unaffected regions was easy. Further studies into presence and location of ATAvol are warranted to further investigate possible clinical implications. The calculated values of skewness are in general positive \u2013 indicating a right skewed histogram with the tail higher at higher CBF values which is in line with the demonstrated association between skewness and ATAvol (see Figure\u00a01).\nFew studies have included spatial CoVCBF on patients with MMD. Tortora et\u00a0al. (10) concluded that spatial CoVCBF may contribute to predict surgical outcomes in paediatric patients with MMD by demonstrating a significantly decreasing spatial CoVCBF 6, 12, and 24 months after encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis compared to baseline. Likewise, Liang et\u00a0al. (11) reported significantly decreasing spatial CoVCBF after MCA-superficial temporal artery anastomosis in adult MMD patients. Tortora et\u00a0al. (10) found no changes in average CBF pointing towards the standard deviation of CBF being the driving mechanism, which is further verified by the significant decrease in time to peak calculated from a dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI acquisition, thus indicating a homogenization in ASL tracer arrival. On the contrary, Liang et\u00a0al. (11) found significantly increasing average CBF values in several sub-divisions of the MCA, but not in the total MCA. Between Tortora et\u00a0al. (10) and Liang et\u00a0al. (11) there are several methodological differences presents; pediatric vs. adult patient populations, different revascularization procedures, the ASL acquisitions are performed with different PLDs and CBF values are extracted from different regions-of-interests. Hence, any comparisons should be\u00a0done with caution and the possible clinical implications of using spatial CoVCBF for post-operative assessment should be\u00a0further investigated. The current study was not designed for longitudinal assessment and this is therefore beyond the scope of this study.\nHara et\u00a0 al. (6) found that spatial CoVCBF may help identify increased OEF in patients with MMD by comparing ASL-based spatial CoVCBF with OEF. However, this finding is not supported by a study by Ibaraki et\u00a0 al. (7) on patients with steno-occlusion, both estimating OEF from 15O-gas PET. 15O-gas PET data was not acquired simultaneously in either study, which may compromise comparisons between PET and ASL data (20). Moreover, Ibaraki et\u00a0al. used a PLD of 2000 ms whereas Hara et\u00a0al. (6) acquired ASL data using a PLD of 1,525 ms and 2,525 ms, respectively. In the latter case, a PLD of 1,525 ms was found to have better diagnostic capabilities. Differences in how regions-of-interest are defined are also present, which may affect the comparison between the studies. Although, there are differences in the applied methodology between both studies, other explanations may also be\u00a0put forward.\nSpatial CoVCBF, and histogram-based parameters are related to delayed CBF (increased ATT) through collateral pathways (8, 9, 12, 21). Furthermore, the presence of collateral pathways has been found to be\u00a0 associated with reduced CVR and increased OEF (22\u201325).\nHence, there may be\u00a0an indirect link between spatial CoVCBF and OEF and CVR owing to differences in collateral pathways. Thus, correlations between spatial CoVCBF and OEF and CVR could depend on the collaterals present, which may explain the ambiguous results reported by Hara et\u00a0al. (6) and Ibaraki et\u00a0al. (7). In the current study we\u00a0investigated whether CVR was associated with spatial CoVCBF and concluded no relationship. However, Ibaraki et\u00a0al. (7), on the other hand, found a significant correlation between spatial CoVCBF and CVR (r = \u22120.373, p = 0.030); however, CVR measurement was performed using induced hypercapnia and the correlation coefficient was calculated on pooled data (contralateral and ipsilateral values). Although, several studies support the correlation between spatial CoV and ATT, extrapolating this known relationship to other measures of hemodynamic compromise should be\u00a0done with caution."
