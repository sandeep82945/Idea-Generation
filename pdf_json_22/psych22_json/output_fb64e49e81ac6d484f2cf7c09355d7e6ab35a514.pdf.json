    "abstractText": "Purpose Interventions to support work participation in cancer survivors (CSs) have shown limited effectiveness. Applying a behavioral change framework (e.g., stages of change) could make work participation interventions for CSs more timely and tailored. We aimed to explore the application of the stages of change framework to work participation support for CSs and to generate stage-specific intervention content. Methods Eighteen experts (e.g., occupational physicians, reintegration consultants) were individually interviewed, and three focus groups with CSs (n = 6, n = 5, n = 4) were conducted. Data were analyzed along the six work-related behavioral change stages purported by the readiness for return to work framework, which is based on the stages of change. Results The following themes were identified: (1) pre-contemplation: emotional support and staying connected\u2014encourage contact with the employer/colleagues; (2) contemplation: considering return to work is stressful\u2014facilitate the deliberation process; (3) preparation self-evaluative: assess current capabilities\u2014seek guidance from, e.g., occupational physicians; (4) preparation behavioral: planning return to work\u2014allow for personalized solutions and encourage supervised return to work; (5) uncertain maintenance: guard against overload\u2014train self-efficacy strategies and communication tactics; and (6) proactive maintenance: accept and prepare for the long term. Conclusions Our results support the potential utility of tailoring CSs\u2019 work participation support along the stages of change. Implications for Cancer Survivors We provided recommendations for intervention content and developed a stage-specific work participation intervention for CSs, the effectiveness of which will be evaluated in an upcoming randomized controlled trial.",

            "text": "While cancer incidence continues to rise, improvements in screening, treatment, and survivorship care allow cancer survivors (CSs) to live longer, with better quality of life [1, 2]. Due to these advancements, CSs are often able to look beyond the burden of the disease and its treatment, towards reconstructing daily life. As approximately 40\u201350% of CSs are of working age at diagnosis [3], many will have to consider working with, or after, cancer. From a personal perspective, being able to work largely contributes to CSs\u2019 rehabilitation and supports a sense of normalcy, identity, purpose, and financial independence [4\u20136]. From a societal perspective, the financial burden of cancer due to, for instance, productivity loss [7] necessitates that CSs who are able and wish to participate in work should be supported to * Pieter Coenen p.coenen@amsterdamumc.nl 1 Department of\u00a0Public and\u00a0Occupational Health, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, van der Boechorststraat 7, 1081\u00a0BT\u00a0Amsterdam, The\u00a0Netherlands 2 Department of\u00a0Health Sciences, Community and\u00a0Occupational Medicine, University of\u00a0Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The\u00a0Netherlands 3 Re-turn, Cancer-Related Return-To-Work Consultancy and\u00a0Guidance, Utrecht, The\u00a0Netherlands 4 Department of\u00a0Research & Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization, Utrecht, The\u00a0Netherlands\n1 3\ndo so. However, return to work (RTW) is a complex and multifaceted process that is influenced by, among others, disease and treatment-related, personal, occupational, and legislative factors [8\u201310]. Hence, CSs are 1.37 times more likely to be unemployed compared to healthy (non-cancer) control participants [11].\nVarious (health care) professionals are involved in the RTW process, e.g., medical specialists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, general practitioners, occupational physicians, insurance physicians, and supervisors/employers. However, central to the RTW process are CSs themselves, who often wish to receive guidance throughout this complex trajectory [12, 13]. Although it is known which factors hinder and facilitate RTW in CSs [14\u201316], interventions to support RTW have not been proven sufficiently effective to be implemented on a wider scale [17, 18]. In a Cochrane review, de Boer and colleagues showed that there was no support for the effectiveness of single-component interventions (e.g., psychoeducational, exercise, or medical interventions), and only weak support for the effectiveness of multi-component interventions (i.e., interventions combining psychoeducational, exercise, and/or vocational components), to improve RTW in CSs [17]. A more recent systematic review showed that interventions to support RTW in CSs\u00a0did not improve RTW compared to usual care [18]. In addition, interventions to support work retention after initial RTW are scarce.\nRecently, researchers have started to apply concepts from behavioral psychology to the RTW/work retention process of CSs. Duijts and colleagues [19] suggested the application of the TransTheoretical Model of health behavior change (TTM) [20], and its core component, i.e., the stages of change, to the development of interventions to support CSs\u2019 RTW. The readiness for return to work (RRTW) scale [21] measures the TTM\u2019s stages of change in the context of work resumption and work retention. Originally developed for lost-time claimants1 with musculoskeletal disorders, the RRTW scale has been translated into Dutch and adapted for CSs [22]. The adapted scale indexes information related to six behavioral change stages that CSs may go through in the RTW and work retention process: pre-contemplation (not thinking about work resumption), contemplation (starting to think about work resumption), preparation self-evaluative (starting to conceptualize and prepare for RTW), preparation behavioral (planning RTW and actually going back to work), uncertain maintenance (being back at work but feeling uncertain about being able to retain work), and proactive maintenance (being back at work and feeling able to retain\nwork) [21]. Similar to the TTM [20], the theory behind the RRTW scale [21, 23] purports that individuals move through the stages of change non-linearly (i.e., they can skip stages and lapse back to prior stages).\nBy identifying CSs\u2019 behavioral change stages related to RTW, interventions to support work participation are assumed to be better able to tap into CSs\u2019 stage-specific circumstances and support needs [18, 19]. In the current study, we qualitatively explored the application of the stages of change [20], using RRTW stage terminology [21, 22] (hereafter \u201cbehavioral change stages\u201d), to work participation support for CSs. We conducted this exploration through interviews with various (health care) professionals (hereafter: experts) and focus groups with CSs. Our aims were to (1) explore whether experts and CSs recognized the behavioral change stages in their experiences regarding RTW and work retention, (2) identify CSs\u2019 stage-specific needs and common stage-specific barriers and facilitators for RTW/ work retention, and (3) generate stage-specific intervention content to support work participation in CSs."

Hence, a professional relationship between most authors and experts existed prior to study commencement. Upon response to the invitation, experts received an information letter, informed consent form, and a brief questionnaire indexing sociodemographic information and relevant work experience. After signing the informed consent form and completing the questionnaire, an interview was scheduled to take place at the expert\u2019s workplace, at Amsterdam UMC, or via telephone. 1 In Ontario, Canada, a work injury is filed as \u201clost-time\u201d if, after the day of injury, the worker is unable to go into work, or is able to go into work but is earning less (e.g., because of reduced work hours).\n1 3\nCSs were eligible to participate in a focus group if they were between 18 and 65\u00a0years of age at the time of inclusion, had been diagnosed with cancer a maximum of 2\u00a0years ago, had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy, were currently employed, and had been on sick leave at least some time during the past 2\u00a0years. Convenience sampling was applied, as CSs were recruited via various (social media) platforms, including those of the Dutch Federation of Cancer Patient Organizations (Dutch acronym: NFK), and patient panels of \u201ckanker.nl\u201d and the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital. Using a recruitment flyer, CSs were invited to contact the research team, whereupon they received the digital information letter and a link to a digital informed consent form and screening questionnaire, indexing sociodemographic and disease-related information. Eligible CSs were contacted by telephone to schedule a focus group at Amsterdam UMC. Due to this recruitment strategy, no information on nonresponse is available. No relationship was established with CSs prior to study commencement, excepting two: one participant who was a family member of author PC and one participant who was known to the research team due to her participation in previous psychosocial oncology research projects conducted by the team."

Expert interview data were not analyzed thematically as expert interviews were held to inform the focus groups with CSs. Main points from expert interviews were collated per behavioral change stage and were presented as a preamble to stage-specific focus group results. Grounded in realist epistemology (i.e., the notion that participants\u2019 perspective and description of the world is identical to reality as they perceive it [32]), focus group data were analyzed using a semantic approach, i.e., themes were identified within the explicit meanings of the data. Thematic analysis was then performed according to the six-step framework of Braun and Clark [33] (i.e., familiarizing oneself with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the report), using ATLAS.ti 8 for Windows (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH). Main themes were based on the theoretical framework underlying the suggested intervention content, i.e., the six behavioral change stages used to structure the expert interviews and focus groups with CSs [21, 22], whereas subthemes were derived from the data.\nTo assess inter-coder reliability, one focus group transcript was independently coded by two authors (A.Z., P.C.). Afterwards, codes were discussed to reach consensus and to build the final coding tree (Supplementary File 3). A.Z. coded the remaining focus group transcripts, using this coding tree.

Thus, excluding the three missing cases from the descriptive analysis, the mean age was 49\u00a0years (SD 11), and the mean years of experience with work-related guidance of CSs were 15\u00a0years (SD 10). Experts had a wide variety of, and sometimes multiple, occupations. Primary occupations were occupational physician, some of which specialized in oncology (n = 4), reintegration coach specialized in oncology (n = 3), psychologist specialized in oncology (n = 1), rehabilitation physician (n = 1), oncological surgeon (n = 1), occupational therapist specialized in oncology (n = 1), cancer patient advocate (n = 1), national policy advisor (n = 1), scientific researcher (n = 2), and AYA 2 representative (n = 3).\nFifteen CSs (87% female) with a mean age of 47\u00a0years (SD 9; range 34\u201359\u00a0years) participated in the focus groups (Table\u00a01). Participants were diagnosed with various cancer types (i.e., breast, ovarian, colon, rectal, testicular, or head/neck cancer), of which breast cancer was most prevalent (53%). Participants received their diagnosis on average 12\u00a0months ago (at the time of the interview, SD 6\u00a0months). At time of diagnosis, CSs had a part-time (n = 9, 60%) or full-time (n = 6, 40%) employment contract, while at time of the focus groups, most participants were on sick leave (n = 12, 80%). Although information on job type was not collected via questionnaires, focus group data showed that most participants had white or pink-collar jobs.\nPerceived utility of\u00a0behavioral change stages\nExperts and CSs were able to relate their experiences to, and organize their experience along, the behavioral change stages.\na Outcome categories were not mutually exclusive. b One CS was diagnosed with breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma.\n2 This foundation is focused on Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) aged 18\u201339\u00a0years, who are diagnosed with cancer.\n1 3\nYou see very clearly that this [RTW/work retention] process is made up of stages, and all of us here are in different stages.

            "text": "Experts stated that CSs often appeared to be in Pre-contemplation when they were still undergoing treatment. As for stage-specific intervention strategies and tools, experts advised to focus on the emotional needs of CSs and to gently raise awareness of the RTW trajectory and related laws and regulations. Experts suggested that the first professional point of contact in this stage could be e.g., an oncology nurse or a clinical occupational physician.3 Experts further recommended encouraging CSs to initiate and maintain contact with their occupational physician, direct supervisor, and colleagues, and to elicit CSs\u2019 natural curiosity about their work. If CSs stay in pre-contemplation long or show particular reluctance to RTW, experts suggested to discuss pre-existent work-related problems, explore CSs\u2019 own expectations regarding their RTW, and explore whether the CS\u2019s social network (e.g., partner or family members) inhibits RTW. According to experts, members of the CS\u2019s social network can express concern about, and disapproval of, RTW.\nCSs emphasized that in Pre-contemplation, the physical and mental burden of cancer treatment precluded any thoughts about work. CSs stated that the treatment trajectory and its related effects were often unclear and unpredictable, preventing them from thinking beyond the present moment.\nI think it really depends on your circumstances in this stage. I was in this stage when I was literally sick to death of chemo. [\u2026] I think if someone initiated a con-\nversation about work, the only thing I could\u2019ve done was cry. [female patient, aged 47\u00a0years].\nAccording to CSs, if work was to be mentioned in this stage, it would have to be done with great delicacy, informally, and without pressure to RTW. CSs reported that as work had faded into the background of cancer and its treatment, informal contact with colleagues and employers was considered helpful for emotional processing and gently reigniting an interest in work. This informal contact helped CSs to slowly progress to another behavioral change stage. Not being contacted by a supervisor or colleagues was considered hurtful and confusing: CSs expressed that during this time, they needed to feel part of the team, but not be pressured in any way to RTW within a certain timeframe.\nThey [colleagues] came over for a cup of coffee. [\u2026] When you\u2019re still in the [treatment] stage, you\u2019re like: \u2018Work is over there. Let it be. This is my world now.\u2019 But that changes when \u2013 without talking about work \u2013 colleagues come over. Then you start thinking about work and how you had a good time with your colleagues. [male patient, aged 34\u00a0years]. Keep in contact a bit. Because at a certain point you\u2019re back at work, and I notice now that because of my hair, people don\u2019t recognize me. And that\u2019s of course because my appearance has changed. But I don\u2019t recognize people anymore either, because so much has changed over time. [female patient, aged 38\u00a0years].\nIn both the pre-contemplation and contemplation stage, a need for early information provision concerning relevant legislation was mentioned by CSs.\nI\u2019d suggest discussing legislation about work, because I always felt that the law was breathing down my neck. [\u2026] I had to go to the occupational physician and he told me about the law and that I had to go to work now, because I was nearing two years of sickness absence.4 So actually, I went to work even though at the time, I wasn\u2019t ready for it at all. [female patient, aged 59\u00a0years]. After a year [of sickness absence] I started to look into it [sick leave legislation], because I [\u2026] heard stories about reintegration at a different employer5 and I thought: \u2018Ah! I don\u2019t want that at all! That\u2019s not possible!\u2019 [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\n3 A clinical occupational physician (klinisch arbeidsgeneeskundige in Dutch) is a registered occupational physician who has specific knowledge of a certain medical speciality, such as cancer. The clinical occupational physician advises patients, their practitioners, and employers, about questions or problems related to illness and work.\n4 According to Dutch legislation, an employee who has been absent from work for 2\u00a0years is required to undergo a formal work disability assessment. 5 According to Dutch legislation, the employer and employee are required to assess whether reintegration at the current employer is still attainable. If not, the employer is required to assist the employee in his/her reintegration at a different employer.\n1 3"

            "text": "Experts characterized the contemplation stage by feelings of confusion, anxiety, and overwhelm in CSs. According to experts, these feelings could be caused by an internal deliberation process related to RTW, e.g., considerations regarding whether the CS ought to RTW, needs to RTW, wants to RTW, can RTW, and what is needed to RTW. Experts mentioned that, to facilitate this deliberation process in this stage, various intervention strategies could be applied. First, experts advised using motivational interviewing techniques to elicit CSs\u2019 natural curiosity about RTW, their colleagues and workplace. Furthermore, experts suggested encouraging CSs to talk through their expectations regarding RTW and to address anticipated practical and emotional barriers that might hinder RTW. This would also allow CSs to divide RTW into manageable steps and provide an opportunity to address barriers collaboratively with the intervention provider. Furthermore, experts advised that relevant information should be provided and misconceptions should be gently corrected, e.g., information concerning the independent role of the occupational physician and his/her duty of confidentiality, CSs\u2019 and employers\u2019 legal rights and obligations, and the effects of cancer and its treatment on (long term) work ability. According to experts, this information could be provided by, e.g., a reintegration consultant or a (clinical) occupational physician.6\nCSs described that thoughts and questions about RTW emerged when they started to physically recover from cancer and its treatment, leading to feelings of confusion, worry, and anxiety.\nFor me, it [chemotherapy] was four to five months of hell and I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d get out of it. And how I would get out of it. And what would happen after the last one [round of chemotherapy]. [\u2026] When the last one was injected, that was the worst one. But after that, I felt like: \u2018Okay, I\u2019m starting to feel better and better, and I can think about the next steps.\u2019 [male patient, aged 39\u00a0years].\nI thought, you know: \u2018I\u2019m done [with treatment] now. Everything\u2019s done and I need to be well again.\u2019 But you\u2019re not [well], at all. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re capable of at all, really. Because not only does your work continue, but the rest [of your life] continues too. [\u2026] I panicked. I thought \u2018How?! How am I ever going to be able to function at work for a whole day again?\u2019 [female patient, aged 46\u00a0years].\nIf important questions regarding RTW remained unanswered, CSs described that they could potentially stay in\ncontemplation for a long time. According to CSs, guidance from (health care) professionals would help them in making informed decisions about RTW, and progressing to another behavioral change stage.\nI think the occupational therapist can \u2013 in this Contemplation stage \u2013 help you weigh the pros and cons [of RTW]. [female patient, aged 50\u00a0years].\nIt\u2019d be good if someone said that to you, like \u2018No, you\u2019re not going to work. You\u2019re first going to think about these questions. And when you\u2019ve thought about them, and you\u2019ve come up with some of your own answers, then we\u2019re going to talk about that [RTW]. [female patient, aged 52\u00a0years].\nNot all CSs recognized themselves in the contemplation stage. Some reported to have skipped this stage altogether, which could be due to personality (i.e., being more of a \u201cdoer\u201d than a \u201cthinker\u201d) and/or coping strategies (i.e., action-focused coping).\nI think I skipped this stage. I\u2019m not much of a contemplator. [female patient, aged 52\u00a0years].\nIn my mind, I was already between stage four [Preparation Behavioral] and five [Uncertain Maintenance]: we\u2019re just going to do it [RTW]. [male patient, aged 39\u00a0years].\nPreparation\u2014self\u2011evaluative: assessing current capabilities requires guidance\nIn Preparation\u2014self-evaluative, experts explained that CSs appeared to have made a favorable decision regarding RTW and to have focused their attention on gaining information on how to RTW. Regarding intervention content, experts suggested using worksheets and diary exercises to gain insight into CSs\u2019 current daily schedule, energy levels, and work-related capabilities and to compare those to (proximal and distal) RTW goals. According to experts, RTW goal setting should be done in line with the occupational physician\u2019s advice and input from the direct supervisor where applicable. Work tasks should be discussed with the aim of subdividing these tasks into more manageable, buildable ones that could be prepared for, for instance, occupational therapy. Next, experts mentioned that CSs should be encouraged to build on their current capabilities, instead of focusing on capabilities that might have been lost or (temporarily) diminished due to cancer treatment. To be able to RTW over time, experts advised that CSs\u2019 capabilities, such as physical fitness and emotional resilience, should be expanded progressively at home (e.g., by expanding household tasks, learning to take\n6 See footnote 2.\n1 3\nrestorative breaks, engaging in physical therapy or fitness, and/or working on emotional processing of the disease and its impact with, e.g., a psychologist). Other recommended strategies included information provision (e.g., on energy management), verbal encouragement, and emotional validation. Experts emphasized the effort and energy it takes for CSs to (plan) RTW and the feelings of frustration and grief that this can bring about.\nIn preparation\u2014self-evaluative, CSs described seeking information to evaluate whether they were able to RTW and what RTW would look like (e.g., in terms of working hours and work tasks). This evaluative process was often hindered by a lack of input from (health care) professionals regarding the work-related impact of cancer treatment, confusion about where to find guidance, and fluctuating energy levels.\nAm I still able to [work] \u2013 am I still the same? Do I still have the same amount of energy to do that in the same way as before? It\u2019s quite nerve-wracking to do it [work] again. Like: \u2018Can I still do it?\u2019 And, of course, I still can [\u2026] But can I still do it in terms of energy? Can I gather the courage? Can I still deal with all of that input? [\u2026] I\u2019ll have to experience that myself. No one can predict this for me. [female patient, aged 38\u00a0years].\nCSs discussed the importance, in this stage, of gaining insight into their current activities, energy levels, and moments of rest, and to adjust their habits and schedule slowly, at home, to make space for future RTW.\nBecause work does fit [in your daily/weekly schedule], but then the rest [of daily life] doesn\u2019t fit anymore. [female patient, aged 46\u00a0years]. Work on that very consciously: your energy levels. Not at work, but just at home. Like, what are you doing? Take a moment of rest. Then do something again. [\u2026] You have some instability, at least I do. Like on one day it\u2019s okay, and then the other day it\u2019s crap. [\u2026] That\u2019s hard too. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nGuidance from supervisors, occupational physicians, and occupational therapists was thought to be helpful in gaining insight into the abovementioned aspects and in planning future RTW:\nUnravel the tasks that make up your job. Which elements are in that? [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\n[In response] And also mirror that to where you\u2019re at right now. [\u2026] If I can\u2019t read at home, it\u2019s realistic to assume that I can\u2019t read at work either. [\u2026] But I am able to do other things. So [\u2026] you have to dissect and filter: I can do this, but I can\u2019t do that yet. [\u2026] I think you mainly have to look at the possibilities, if\nyou even get this far. Otherwise, you get completely discouraged. [female patient, aged 47\u00a0years].\nWith your supervisor, look at what\u2019s possible regarding the tasks that you are able to do. [\u2026] What you\u2019re aiming to take on [in terms of tasks]: are you able to do that? For that, I think you definitely need an occupational therapist. Because he can give you a bit more insight into your [energy] balance. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nPreparation\u2014behavioral: RTW planning should be concrete, flexible, and\u00a0personalized\nAccording to experts, CSs in preparation\u2014behavioral sought practical guidance to plan and try out RTW. Experts noted that CSs had a tendency to aim for RTW too quickly in this stage (e.g., due to feelings of responsibility towards the employer, or guilt towards colleagues), which was identified as a risk factor for sickness absence recurrence. Regarding intervention content, experts suggested collaboratively developing a concrete, yet flexible, RTW plan in this stage. This RTW plan should consider the needs and suggestions of the CSs, and, if applicable, the occupational physician\u2019s and supervisor\u2019s input. According to experts, CSs should be encouraged to plan their RTW in detail: how to prepare for their first day/week back at work, how to respond to colleagues, how (often) to communicate with their supervisor, which tasks to take up, for how many hours per week, and so on. Experts warned that trying out the RTW plan might lead to CSs encountering obstacles and setbacks. Therefore, experts suggested that RTW planning should be flexible that employers should be made aware of the necessity of this flexibility, that CSs need to be coached throughout the obstacles and setbacks, and that CSs\u2019 successes should be celebrated. Finally, experts proposed that CSs get help or support to build their work-related self-efficacy, by learning and practicing various skills (e.g., time management, self-discipline, cognitive aids, or communication strategies) that could be taught by, e.g., occupational therapists.\nCSs described preparation\u2014behavioral as a turbulent and energy-consuming stage in which they often RTW without the appropriate guidance. CSs described that employers and colleagues often had a well-intended \u201canything goes\u201d attitude towards their RTW: CSs were welcome to determine their own working hours and work tasks. Although this was experienced as welcome freedom when initially returning to work, CSs mentioned that the continuance of this attitude led to stagnation in their RTW process,\n1 3\nconfusion about expectations, and frustrations due to the performance of menial tasks.\nEven though I had a very good relationship with my direct supervisor, well [he said]: \u2018Look around a bit, have some coffee.\u2019 Um, yeah, after a month of having coffee and looking around I thought \u2018And now?\u2019 [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nI told him [occupational physician] that I thought it was time for me to get back to work, or that I thought it\u2019d be good for me. But for months now, we\u2019ve been looking for things that I\u2019d be able to do. [\u2026] I think he [supervisor] keeps looking for tasks that are similar to the work that I did before. And I\u2019m thinking it\u2019d be nice if that\u2019s the end goal, but the first steps can be different. [\u2026] I just notice it\u2019s so hard to explain how complex it actually is. [female patient, aged 47\u00a0years].\nI didn\u2019t want any stupid little tasks. No. I did everything I could to get back to work and then to come back and do menial tasks like copying? [Indignant] Well, yeah, no. Absolutely not. [\u2026] I need a challenge to recover. [female patient, aged 41\u00a0years].\nCSs expressed the need for concrete and personalized RTW planning. CSs experienced that (health care) professionals involved in the RTW process often assumed to know what was best for them. CSs\u2019 own perceptions of the situation, however, could differ greatly.\nHe [occupational health expert7] said to me: \u2018Maybe it\u2019s too ambitious to go back to work now, but apply for volunteer work, have coffee with the elderly for one or two hours a week.\u2019 With all due respect \u2013 because there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2013 but we [supervisor and CS] walked out of there and my supervisor said: \u2018I saw your face in there: we\u2019re not going to do that. We\u2019ll find another solution, because this way you\u2019re actually taking another step back.\u2019 [female patient, aged 47\u00a0years].\nYou notice it [work-related support] is very dependent on the person. I was also offered support from an occupational psychologist because I wanted to go [back to work] too fast. But I also think there are plenty of people who maybe need that little push. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nThe question is the same for everyone: \u2018How do I develop a realistic [RTW] plan?\u2019 That\u2019s similar. The answer to that is just different for everyone. [female patient, aged 49\u00a0years].\nUncertain maintenance: taking it slow\u2014 guarding against\u00a0overload\nExperts noted that CSs had a tendency of wanting to do too much, too quickly when they were recently back at work, e.g., working too many hours at once and taking on too many tasks. According to experts, this can lead to CSs getting frustrated, burnt-out, and relapsing into sickness absence. When CSs were recently back at work, experts explained that both CSs and their employers could struggle, because (1) a structured RTW plan might have been missing, (2) the plan needed continuous assessment and adjustment, and (3) the instability of the CS required open and strategic communication. Experts said that the \u201canything goes\u201d approach mentioned in the previous stage is noticeable in uncertain maintenance too, as employers might be careful not to exert any pressure on the CS. In uncertain maintenance, experts recommended various intervention strategies to prevent sickness absence relapse: first, as in the previous stage: acknowledging and validating CSs\u2019 efforts in RTW and being back at work and, next, allowing CSs to trial their RTW plan and assess and adjust it periodically. Related to this, experts mentioned educating the employer on the importance of their flexibility in the RTW and work retention process, and maintaining awareness of CSs\u2019 energy expenditure and work/life balance, for instance with the help of an occupational therapist or reintegration consultant. Finally, teaching communication strategies to CSs and their employers to communicate expectations, needs, and support during this fluctuating time.\nIn uncertain maintenance, CSs described a turbulent state of getting to terms with their \u201cnew normal\u201d regarding reduced work ability and also wanting to do too much at once. CSs often wanted to prove that they were still a valuable employee that they could still do the work and contribute to the organization and their team. According to CSs, this could result in feelings of insecurity, guilt towards colleagues, work/life imbalances, fatigue, burnout symptoms, and sickness absence relapses.\nYou want this [being able to work] so much. But of course, you\u2019re limited in what you can do. But you don\u2019t want to admit that, at all, right? [\u2026] I really thought like, \u2018Yeah, I can\u2019t do anything anymore. I don\u2019t know anything anymore.\u2019 [\u2026] And that makes you very insecure. [\u2026] I thought I just had to be able to do and know it all immediately again. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nI thought I was ready to start doing things again physically, but cognitively I wasn\u2019t feeling quite right yet. I was dealing with a lot of stress. [\u2026] The moment I\n1 3\nfelt a bit better physically, I thought I was on top of the world. [\u2026] I just wanted to do something. [\u2026] Someone should have said to me: \u2018Slow down for now, you have to process some things and deal with that stress\u2019. [male patient, aged 39\u00a0years].\nDuring chemotherapy [\u2026] I worked on therapeutic basis.8 [\u2026] As per January 1st, I\u2019m fully back at work. And it\u2019s harder than I thought. A lot harder. [female patient, aged 56\u00a0years].\nCSs suggested celebrating small successes to stay motivated during this turbulent time. They often felt they lost sight of how far they had come regarding RTW and needed an external party to remind them of their successes.\nSmall wins, you know, your confidence builds through that and then you get into a more positive flow. At least that\u2019s what you want. And that takes time. For me, that took a year before I was fully back at work. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\n[Your supervisor can say to you] \u2018I\u2019m so happy you were able to come today, you did well and I\u2019ll see you the day after tomorrow.\u2019 Like that. Clarity. [female patient, aged 41\u00a0years].\nCSs also suggested utilizing collegial supervision to ensure they maintained their RTW and work retention plan, including limitations set on working hours and work tasks.\nMy colleagues know that I always work overtime and at one point I said to them \u2018Guys, it\u2019s half past one, tell me to go home\u2019. [\u2026] And they do. [\u2026] Before I relapsed [into sickness absence] I didn\u2019t do that [listen to colleagues]. After I relapsed, [\u2026] I do listen to it. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nAccording to CSs, informing colleagues of their current abilities, limitations, instability, and work-related needs was seen as necessary to align mutual expectations. However, CSs also noted that colleagues could feel anxious and uncomfortable around them. CSs suggested that by clearly communicating about (the consequences of) cancer, this discomfort could be alleviated. Both the CS and the employer could play a role in this communication.\nThey [colleagues] didn\u2019t have all the information and yeah, then I felt a certain resistance [from them] or something, like: \u2018She\u2019s there [at work], but actually we can\u2019t count on her [to do the work].\u2019 [\u2026] They [colleagues] often feel it\u2019s [cancer] scary as well. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nProactive maintenance: accept and\u00a0prepare for\u00a0the\u00a0long term\nExperts described that CSs in proactive maintenance seemed to have found their foothold at work, though work retention could still be hindered by continued instability, changing energy levels, and long-term consequences and late effects of cancer treatment. For intervention content, experts suggested supporting CSs and their employers by providing information about the long-term consequences and late effects of cancer treatment on work ability (e.g., by utilizing the expertise of reintegration consultants or occupational physicians specialized in oncology), strategizing for when CSs might recognize these consequences and effects (e.g., knowing where to find relevant support), maintaining awareness of energy expenditure and work/life balance (e.g., by utilizing tools provided by an occupational therapist or reintegration consultant), and maintaining periodic work assessments and long-term employer flexibility.\nCSs mentioned that they often felt unstable at work for a long time and that they often struggled to maintain a healthy work/life balance. According to CSs, learning to accept cancer-related changes in their lives, including changes in their work ability, characterized the shift from uncertain to proactive maintenance.\nWith regards to cancer, how long does a process like that take? To feel like you can turn the page, instead of being in the middle of the chapter? I think that takes years. It\u2019s a mourning process that isn\u2019t just finished within a year. And your fear isn\u2019t gone within a year. And your family also deals with cancer. That\u2019ll all last for a while. [female patient, aged 41\u00a0years].\nIt\u2019s only now [being back at work long-term] that you realize: \u2018Oh right, I can\u2019t do that anymore. Or, I do things differently. [female patient, aged 49\u00a0years].\n[In response to above] Yeah, that\u2019s part of the \u2018old me\u2019. [female patient, aged 57\u00a0years].\nAccepting cancer survivorship as part of one\u2019s identity was not important for every CS.\nIt\u2019s not for everyone. For instance, I\u2019m still aiming to become my old self again. That\u2019s just my goal. [male patient, aged 34\u00a0years].\nLast, when CSs were back at work long term, they said lasting instability and changeable work ability needed to be evaluated and discussed periodically. According to CSs, aspects that should be discussed during these evaluations included, for instance, working hours, work tasks, energy levels, work/life balance, work satisfaction, and collegial communication.\n1 3\nPeriodic evaluations, I think, with the occupational physician. Just to ask how you\u2019re doing along the way. [\u2026] You need room to still be instable. And boundaries [\u2026] when you want to go too fast, other people will [have to] hit the brakes for you. [female patient, aged 41\u00a0years].\n[Interviewer in response to above]: How long do you think you\u2019ll need that [kind of support]?\n[In response to the interviewer] My whole life, I think. [female patient, aged 41\u00a0years].\nWhen you\u2019re back at work a little longer, [let] employers know that you can experience concentration problems and lack of energy in the long term too. [female patient, aged 50\u00a0years]. [In response to above] Lack of sleep. [female patient, aged 38\u00a0years]. [In response to above] Acknowledge the late effects. [female patient, aged 59\u00a0years]."

            "text": "In exploring experts\u2019 and CSs\u2019 perspectives on the application of the behavioral change stages [21, 22] to work participation support for CSs, we found that both experts and CSs were able to recognize and describe their experiences along these stages. Experts and CSs confirmed the non-linearity of stage progression, i.e., they described stage regression and skipping of stages. Finally, stage-specific needs and suggestions for work participation support were amply provided by experts and CSs.\nAlthough RTW and work retention of CSs have long been referred to as a complex process, only recently have researchers started to look deeper into and describe CSs\u2019 progression through this process. It has become clear that this progression is stage specific [10, 18, 34] and looks similar to the stages of change. Furthermore, there are common needs, barriers, and facilitators that characterize the stages. For instance, we learned that in the first stage of the RTW process (i.e., pre-contemplation), CSs used emotion-focused and social coping to endure cancer treatment and recovery. In later stages (i.e., the preparation and maintenance stages), CSs became progressively more open to action-focused, instrumental guidance from, for instance, occupational therapists and reintegration consultants. These results are in line with prior research into the application of the transactional theory of stress and coping to the RTW/work retention process of CSs [10, 34], and with qualitative findings relating\nto active vs. passive coping strategies of CSs in this process [26]. Brusletto and colleagues have described that, when immediate danger to life is averted and treatment-related side effects ease, CSs tentatively broaden their vision to life with or after cancer. In detaching from the patient role, CSs become open to practical support to reconstruct their daily life, including paid work [34].\nAnother example concerns the managing of anxiety, overwhelm, and ambiguity towards RTW in the contemplation stage. Prior research has shown the complexity of making decisions regarding RTW [12, 13, 35]. On the one hand, making a weakly informed decision regarding RTW could lead some CSs to RTW too quickly [12], putting them at risk for sickness absence recurrence. On the other hand, CSs could put off the decision to RTW for too long, thereby increasing their risk of financial toxicity [36]. Experts suggested using motivational interviewing techniques to prevent stage stagnation and elicit CSs natural curiosity about their work. Motivational interviewing has often been linked to the TTM [20]. For instance, one could focus on responding to \u2018sustain talk\u2019 in earlier behavioral change stages and focus on eliciting \u2018mobilizing change talk\u2019 and \u2018commitment talk\u2019 in later stages [37]. Motivational interviewing has been successfully used in other behavioral change research among CSs [38].\nAlthough there are common factors characterizing each stage, in the current study, we highlighted the importance of personalized guidance. Within the TTM [20], there are three dimensions of behavioral change that influence and explain the behavioral change stage one is in decisional balance, self-efficacy, and change processes. Franche and colleagues [23] have stated that, in the context of RTW and work retention, these three dimensions are impacted by employee interactions with the workplace, as well as health care and social security systems. In short, the biopsychosocial context of CSs influences their decision to RTW/retain work (decisional balance), the extent to which they feel able to RTW/retain work (self-efficacy), and which actions they engage in or are motivated by to RTW/retain work (change processes). It is therefore crucial to not only consider the behavioral change stage the CS is in, but also the biopsychosocial factors contributing to that stage assignment at that particular moment in the RTW/work retention process.\nTwo stage-overarching difficulties emerged from our results: timeliness of the intervention and employer involvement. While CSs indicated that they often lacked information on relevant legislation, they also indicated that it might be burdensome to discuss work early on (i.e., just after diagnosis or during treatment), depending on the side effects of cancer treatment. For others, the side\n1 3\neffects of cancer treatment are relatively mild and manageable, which can contribute to these CSs feeling more ready to talk about work early on. The importance of discussing work early on in the hospital setting is becoming increasingly recognized [39], especially when considering CSs\u2019 higher risk of becoming unemployed [11] and risks related to financial toxicity [40]. Being able to accurately gauge CSs\u2019 behavioral change stage by using the RRTW scale [22] could provide a framework for when and how to approach a CS about the topic of work.\nMoreover, we learned that employers, occupational physicians, and colleagues play a crucial role in various stages of the RTW/work retention process. However, both experts and CSs indicated that supervisors often lack the know-how to guide CSs through this process confidently and appropriately. This is in line with prior research showing the impacts of supervisor support on successful RTW [14, 35, 41, 42], the difficulties that supervisors experience in this process [15], and the development of interventions to support them in this process [43]."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study explicitly applying behavioral change theory to the creation of concrete, stage-specific, intervention content for CSs seeking support in the RTW, and work retention process. Results from expert interviews and focus groups with CSs showed high content overlap with each other (i.e., needs, barriers, facilitators, and suggestions for intervention content) per behavioral change stage, further supporting the potential utility of providing tailored, stage-specific support.\nOur results should however be viewed in light of the following limitations. First, although data saturation was reached, our results are based on a limited number of interviews with experts and focus groups with CSs. Focus group participant diversity was limited, possibly due to volunteer bias, as most participants were highly educated female breast CSs. Second, expert interviews were not transcribed verbatim, nor were they thematically analyzed based on the same principles as focus group data [33]. Nevertheless, a research assistant transcribed expert interviews as fully as possible during the interviews themselves, based upon which the authors summarized content per behavioral change stage. Expert interview data were used explicitly to gain initial insights and recommendations per stage, based upon which the interview guide for focus groups with CSs was constructed.\nThird, as occupational therapists and reintegration consultants have been chosen as intervention providers within the STEPS intervention program, our results may\nhave been biased towards the role of these professionals in the RTW and work retention process of CSs. However, in all interviews and focus groups, the authors asked openended questions and encouraged participants to think of any (health care) professional that might be suitable as an intervention provider."

Results of the current study underline the importance of involving and educating the employer (e.g., direct supervisor, HR, or occupational physician) on the impacts of cancer and its treatment on workers\u2019 (sustained) employability. An accessible online toolbox for employers could be useful for this purpose [43].\nThe behavioral change stages provide a flexible framework along which to organize RTW and work retention support for CSs and allow room to further tailor intervention content to, e.g., cancer diagnoses, treatment modalities, prognoses, risk factors for unsuccessful RTW, and personal circumstances of CSs. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs that offer stagespecific support for CSs aiming to RTW or retain work. Our research team will do this in an upcoming randomized controlled trial: STEPS [24]."
