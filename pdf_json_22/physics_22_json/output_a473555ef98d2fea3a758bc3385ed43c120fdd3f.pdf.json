    "abstractText": "We classify the allowed structures of the discrete 1-form gauge sector in six-dimensional supergravity theories realized as F-theory compactifications. This provides upper bounds on the 1-form gauge factors Zm and in particular demands each cyclic factor obey m \u2264 6. Our bounds correspond to the universal geometric constraints on the torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. For any F-theory vacua with at least one tensor multiplet, we derive the constraints from the P fibration structure of the base twofold and identify their physical origin in terms of the worldsheet symmetry of the associated effective heterotic string. The bounds are also extended to the F-theory vacua with no tensor multiplets via a specific deformation of the theory followed by a small instanton transition, along which the 1-form gauge sector is not reduced. We envision that our geometric bounds can be promoted to a swampland constraint on any sixdimensional gravitational theories with minimal supersymmetry and also extend them to fourdimensional F-theory vacua.",

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\nThe notion of symmetries has been significantly generalized in recent years. In particular, ordinary symmetries acting on local operators have been generalized to p-form symmetries with p \u2265 1, under which nonlocal operators extended along p spatial dimensions are charged [1]. As various interesting field-theoretic constructions involve gauging of symmetries, it is of utmost importance to understand the gauging of generalized symmetries to reveal the full symmetry structure of a theory. Perhaps the simplest such generalization is the 1-form gauge symmetries. A prototypical example arises from the discrete 1-form symmetry,\n\u0393 \u2286 Z\u00f0G\u0302\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nof a simply-connected non-Abelian1 0-form gauge group G\u0302, where Z\u00f0G\u0302\u00de denotes the center of G\u0302. Gauging of this 1-form symmetry \u0393 is responsible for the global structure of the 0-form gauge sector, resulting in the nonsimplyconnected quotient,\nG \u00bc G\u0302=\u0393; \u00f02\u00de\nfor the actual gauge group. If the gauge theory in scrutiny is coupled to gravity, such gauging of the 1-form symmetry \u0393, or equivalently, taking the quotient (2) by \u0393 of the 0-form gauge sector, is not an option but a must unless the symmetry is broken. This follows from the absence of global symmetries [2,3], which is one of the conjectured properties that any consistent quantum theories of gravity are subject to. In the swampland program initiated in [4], many general criteria of this kind have been proposed as universal features of quantum gravity, dubbed swampland constraints, leading to invaluable inspirations as well as explicit guiding principles for a variety of recent research activities in high energy physics.\n*seungjoolee@ibs.re.kr \u2020p.oehlmann@northeastern.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In the presence of the latter, the quotient action \u0393 may receive additional contributions from mixing of the center U\u00f01\u00des, which we hope to address in future work.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 108, 086021 (2023)\n2470-0010=2023=108(8)=086021(16) 086021-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nThe aim of this paper is to propose general bounds on the discrete 1-form gauge symmetry \u0393 of the form (2) in sixdimensional gravitational theories with minimal supersymmetry, going beyond the necessity for its gauging. Mostly focusing for concreteness on F-theory vacua, we will constrain the structure of the 1-form gauge sector in 6d N \u00bc \u00f01; 0\u00de supergravity theories as\n\u0393 \u00bc Zn \u00d7 Zm; \u00f03\u00de where the allowed values of \u00f0n;m\u00de with n \u2264 m are restricted as\nn 1 2 3 m 1;\u2026; 6 2; 4 3 : \u00f04\u00de\nThis in particular imposes a definite upper bound,\nm \u2264 6; \u00f05\u00de\non every cyclic factor Zm. As will be reviewed in Sec. II, similar constraints were studied in [5] for the 8d N \u00bc 1 supergravity theories with 0-form gauge sector of rank 18, where a few more cases with the following values of \u00f0n;m\u00de are also allowed:\nn 1 2 4 m 7; 8 6 4 ; \u00f06\u00de\nin addition to those in (4). This restriction can be understood in F-theory as an immediate consequence of the classification results on the elliptic K3 surfaces, whose field-theoretic derivation can also be given from the anomaly consideration alone.2 It is thus intriguing to note that the constraints persist, even in an enhanced form, in lower dimensional theories with less supersymmetry. Also from the geometric point of view, the set of elliptic CalabiYau threefolds available for 6d F-theory vacua is much wilder than that of the elliptic K3 surfaces for 8d vacua, and hence, the extension of the geometric constraints on surfaces to those on threefolds naively looks surprising. In this regard, the connection between the 6d and the 8d vacua will be clarified in Sec. III, where we will constrain the 1-form gauge sector of 6d N \u00bc \u00f01; 0\u00de supergravity theories in the framework of geometric F-theory compactifications to six dimensions. We will find that the generic P1 fibration structure of the base twofold will play a pivotal role. The only exceptional base lacking such a fibration is P2, which leads to F-theory vacua with T \u00bc 0 tensor multiplets. However, we will be able to deform those\nmodels and to make a transition to the models with T > 0 tensor multiplets, without reducing the 1-form gauge sector along the way, thereby validating the derivation of the generic constraints even to the theories without tensor multiplets. In principle, it still remains a logical possibility that the geometric bounds derived as such may not serve as a general swampland constraint. However, the validity of our proposal is bolstered as follows. First, in Sec. IV we will provide a rationale behind the bound (5) from the dual heterotic perspective. Our main message is that the \u0393 quotient (2) must act nontrivially on the perturbative 0-form gauge sector of the dual heterotic string, whether or not it affects the nonperturbative sector.3 One can already infer from this perturbative nature of \u0393 that the definite upper bound of 6 arises for each 1-form factor, which follows from the simple group theoretical fact that Z6 is the maximal cyclic subgroup of E8.\n4 Such a perturbative nature of the 1-form gauge sector is reminiscent of that of the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form gauge sector [8]; we will emphasize this resemblance in Sec. IV. Furthermore, inspired by how the F-theoretic geometry and the heterotic physics constrain the 1-form gauge sector, we will be naturally led in Sec. V to envision a concrete route for extending the bounds to general effective theories via decompactification to eight dimensions. In Sec. V we will in fact provide a number of applications and extensions of our findings. Upon addressing the aforementioned possibility of enhancing our string-theoretic bounds to swampland ones, we will connect the putative 6d F-theory vacua violating the bounds to certain infinite distance limits in the moduli space, which will also be argued to result in decompactification. Another natural extension to be discussed concerns the discrete 0-form gauge sector. We will argue that a cyclic 0-form gauge factor with order beyond 6 cannot arise in 6d F-theory models with T \u2265 1 tensor multiplets. We will then also conjecture that no matter states in those models can have a U\u00f01\u00de charge larger than 6. Moreover, our derivation of the six-dimensional bounds will also be extended to the geometric part of the 1-form gauge sector in 4d F-theory models, with a systematic analysis of the flux-induced sector left for future work."

In D \u2265 6\n2The one-to-one correspondence between the elliptic K3 surfaces and the fully consistent supergravity theories can be further sharpened by considering the worldvolume theories of probe 3-branes [6].\n3The nonperturbative sector will also be affected in general by the quotient; see Ref. [7].\n4To be precise, this intuition is valid under the assumption that the perturbative sector in six dimension is embeddable into the worldsheet symmetry of the 10d heterotic string, as will be emphasized later.\n086021-2\ndimensions, i.e., with d \u2264 3, this allows us to define the effective theories in terms of algebraic properties of the fibration alone, which can always be brought into a Weierstrass form,\ny2 \u00bc x3 \u00fe fxz4 \u00fe gz6: \u00f07\u00de\nHere, z, x, y are the coordinates of the weighted projective space P2\u00bd1\u22362\u22363 and \u00f0f; g\u00de a pair of sections,\nf\u2208H0\u00f0Bd\u22121; K\u0304\u22974Bd\u22121\u00de; g\u2208H0\u00f0Bd\u22121; K\u0304\u22976Bd\u22121\u00de; \u00f08\u00de\nwith K\u0304Bd\u22121 denoting the anticanonical bundle of the F-theory base Bd\u22121. As is well known, the \u00bdp; q 7-brane stacks are located in the codimension-one loci in the base where the discriminant \u0394 \u2254 4f3 \u00fe 27g2 vanishes, and the worldvolume gauge algebra gi carried by each brane stack is read off from the vanishing orders of f, g and \u0394 via the classification of singular fibers by Kodaira and Ne\u0301ron. On the other hand, the refined information as to which gauge group Gi arises from each stack is encoded in the torsional sections that generate the finite subgroup MW\u00f0Yd\u00deTors of the Mordell-Weil group. In particular, it is known that the global structure of the total gauge group,\nG \u00bc Y\ni\nGi; \u00f09\u00de\nis determined as [9,10]\n\u03c01\u00f0G\u00de \u00bc MW\u00f0Yd\u00deTors; \u00f010\u00de\nwhich embeds into the total center of the simply-connected cover G\u0302,\nZ\u00f0G\u0302\u00de \u00bc Y\ni\nZni ; \u00f011\u00de\nvia the embedding factors\nki \u2208Zni : \u00f012\u00de\nGeometrically, the allowed torsional structures, as well as the generic forms of the associated Weierstrass modes, have been systematically studied in [9], leading to the realization of\nMW\u00f0Yd\u00deTors \u00bc Zn \u00d7 Zm; \u00f013\u00de\nwith the possibilities given in (4). Furthermore, it is known [11] that there are additional outliers with the values of \u00f0n;m\u00de given in (6), which only apply to the cases with d \u00bc 2, i.e., to K3 surfaces.\nOne of the goals of this paper is to derive these geometric constraints for Calabi-Yau threefolds in an explicit and constructive manner, and to understand them physically from the perspective of the dual heterotic string. In particular we will see, under a certain simplifying assumption, that the global gauge group structure must always embed into the perturbative E8 \u00d7 E8 [or SO\u00f032\u00de] current of the heterotic worldsheet, from which the constraints immediately follow. This is to be contrasted with the following independent, but less constructive, route to the geometric bounds [11,12]: In type IIB string theory the axiodilaton \u03c4 in general takes any values in the upper half-plane H modulo SL\u00f02;Z\u00de. Upon adding the point at infinity, the moduli space of \u03c4 is represented by the modular curve,\nX\u00f01\u00de \u00bc H =SL\u00f02;Z\u00de: \u00f014\u00de\nThe full SL\u00f02;Z\u00de group, however, does not preserve the Zn \u00d7 Zm torsion points but only the congruence subgroup 5 \u0393\u00f0n\u00de \u2229 \u03931\u00f0m\u00de \u2282 SL\u00f02;Z\u00de does. The associated moduli space of \u03c4, i.e., its respective compactified modular curve, is given as\nX\u00f0n;m\u00de \u00bc H =\u0393\u00f0n\u00de \u2229 \u03931\u00f0m\u00de: \u00f017\u00de\nThose curves admit an intricate structure of cusps, of which \u03c4 values correspond to the singular fibers of Kodaira type Is, in perfect match with those found in the generic Weierstrass models [9]. This structure is not unlike that of the gauging of an SL\u00f02;Z\u00de subgroup, i.e., taking an orbifold which leads to additional fixed points. Those fixed points are loci where D7 brane stacks reside as required by the discrete 1-form gauge symmetry [12]. For the torsion with large orders \u00f0n;m\u00de, the modular curve X\u00f0n;m\u00de is sufficient to fix the full gauge group of the 8d F-theory vacuum. While it was not claimed in [9] that (4) is the full list, the proof of its completeness has later been provided in [11]. In this paper, we will find another, more constructive route to this classification result, manifesting the connection in geometry between elliptic K3 surfaces and elliptic CalabiYau threefolds.\n5The relevant congruence subgroups are defined as\n\u03931\u00f0n\u00de \u00bc \u03b3 \u2208SL\u00f02;Z\u00de\u2236 \u03b3 \u2261 1 0 1\nmod n ; \u00f015\u00de\n\u0393\u00f0n\u00de \u00bc \u03b3 \u2208SL\u00f02;Z\u00de\u2236 \u03b3 \u2261\n1 0\n0 1\nmod n : \u00f016\u00de\n086021-3\nA. 8d EFTs\n8d N \u00bc 1 supergravity theories with rk\u00f0G\u00de \u00bc 18 have been characterized via F-theory in terms of elliptic K3 surfaces Y2 over the base onefold B1 \u00bc P1. In particular, the inequivalent fiber structures of Y2, including the torsion subgroups of the Mordell-Weil groups, have been classified [13]. Moreover, as pointed out in [14], MWTors\u00f0Y2\u00de is equally well understood in terms of the nonprimitive embedding of the ADE singularities into the \u039b2;18 lattice of the elliptic K3 surfaces. All in all, the torsion subgroup, and hence, the 1-form gauge sector, takes the form\n\u0393 \u00bc Zn \u00d7 Zm; \u00f018\u00de\nwith the allowed values of \u00f0n;m\u00de given by (4) and (6). As emphasized in [11], the outliers (6) do not apply to higherdimensional fibrations Yd>2, and the K3 surfaces realizing them are necessarily rigid, i.e., extremal, as the associated F-theory compactifications turn out to have the nonAbelian groups of ranks rk\u00f0G\u00de \u00bc 18. In the meantime, as pointed out in [5] via a purely fieldtheoretic consideration, the 1-form symmetry might in general lead to a global anomaly (see also [15]). Absence of such an anomaly for the 1-form gauge sector thus imposes field-theoretic constraints on the embedding factors ki (12) in terms of the cyclic orders ni of the center (11), leading in turn to constraints on the 1-form gauge sector \u0393. In particular, for each of the extremal outliers (6), the 0-form gauge sector, including its global structure, turns out to be uniquely determined by such constraints: e.g., for the 1-form gauge sector \u0393 \u00bc Z7 with \u00f0n;m\u00de \u00bc \u00f01; 7\u00de in (6), the unique consistent 0-form gauge group is G \u00bc SU\u00f07\u00de3=Z7, where the global structure is realized by the embedding factors,\n\u00f0k1; k2; k3\u00de \u00bc \u00f01; 2; 3\u00de; \u00f019\u00de\ninto the total center Z\u00f0G\u0302\u00de \u00bc Z37. Given such a concrete classification of consistent gauge groups, a natural question arises as to what would go wrong e.g. if \u0393 acquired a cyclic factorZm withm \u2265 9. One way to address this is to invoke the orbifold picture of the fundamental domain of the axiodilaton discussed before. The modular curve X\u00f01; m\u00de for m \u2265 9 introduces cusps corresponding to the singular fibers of Kodaira type Isi , which must thus be included in the geometry, leading to gauge groups with\nrk\u00f0G\u00de \u00bc X\ni\n\u00f0si \u2212 1\u00de \u2265 24; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere the inequality saturates for m \u00bc 9. However, this exceeds the geometric upper bound of 18, which follows\nfrom the Tate-Shioda-Wazir thoerem [16\u201318], and hence, m \u2265 9 cannot be realized in 8d F-theory vacua.\nB. 6d EFTs\nF-theory has proven to be an invaluable geometric tool6 also for systematically exploring 6d N \u00bc \u00f01; 0\u00de supergravity theories in terms of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds Y3 over a base twofold B2. Compactness of the base B2 is crucial as its finite volume relates to the Planck mass,\nM4Pl \u221d Vol\u00f0B2\u00de; \u00f021\u00de\nkeeping the effective theory gravitational. Moreover, the gravitational and the gauge anomalies are beautifully reflected in the topological intersection structure of the base [19]. To begin with, the anomaly coefficient of each gauge algebra factor gi is identified with the respective curve class bi of the discriminantal component, with gauge coupling given as\ng\u22122i \u221d Vol\u00f0bi\u00de: \u00f022\u00de\nFurthermore, the anomaly cancellation via the GreenSchwarz-Sagnotti-West mechanism [20,21] follows from the geometry of the elliptic fibration Y3: for instance, the matter spectrum of the fields charged under gi \u00bc su\u00f0N\u00de carried by the curve of class bi with self-intersection n and genus g is fixed purely in terms of these topological data as7\n\u00bd\u00f08 \u2212 N\u00den\u00fe 16\u00f01 \u2212 g\u00de F\u00fe \u00f0n\u00fe 1 \u2212 g\u00de\u039b\u00fe gAdj; \u00f023\u00de\nwhose contribution to the anomalies can be shown to cancel with the intersection pairings between the anomaly coefficients. As it turns out, not every six-dimensional supergravity theory fulfilling the anomaly criteria has an F-theoretic realization. This can be easily inferred from the fact that the set of distinct elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds is finite [23,24], while infinite classes of such apparently consistent supergravity theories arise (see, e.g., [25]). It has recently been found [26,27], however, that some of those infinite classes can be ruled out by the consistency requirement on certain Bogomol\u2019nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) strings, whose existence is addressed by one of the swampland constraints known as the completeness hypothesis (see Ref. [3] for a recent account). In much the same way, the analog of the field-theoretic 8d global anomalies by itself does not lead to as strong constraints on the 1-form gauge sector as the geometric\n6In this paper we focus on the geometric, i.e., unfrozen, phase of F-theory.\n7Symmetric representations can be obtained through singular divisors [22]: an adjoint representation there is anomaly equivalent to a symmetric and an antisymmetric representation.\n086021-4\nones (4). The latter was first addressed in [11] in terms of the torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group of Y3 via modular curves. The precise argument there was based on the structure of the modular curves X\u00f0n;m\u00de: the latter indicated that the generic Weierstrass models with MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors \u00bc Zn \u00d7 Zm involve collisions of singularities which effectively result in nonminimal codimension-one fibers with vanishing orders,\n\u00f0ord\u00f0f\u00de; ord\u00f0g\u00de\u00de \u2265 \u00f04; 6\u00de; \u00f024\u00de\nand hence, should be ruled out. In the ensuing section, a constructive derivation will be given of the same geometric constraints. Furthermore, we will also provide in Sec. IV a heterotic worldsheet perspective on those geometric constraints, thereby interpreting them physically, still in a string-theoretic context. In fact, as will be envisioned in Sec. V, it is our belief that the purely effective-fieldtheoretic constraints will eventually enhance, possibly to the geometric ones, once again by applying appropriate swampland constraints if necessary."

However, all 1-form gauge symmetries viable in eight dimensions are not necessarily realizable also in six dimensions. Indeed the 6d bounds turn out to be stronger due to the outliers (6) that are known not to be realized as the structure of the Mordell-Weil torsion of Y3 [11]. In particular, Z7 and Z8 are not a viable 1-form gauge sector, which we will also support by switching to the dual heterotic frame in Sec. IV.10\nOne may also attempt to rule out those outliers by combining field-theoretic and geometric constraints, independently of the rationale based on modular curves. In the following we will illustrate how this works with the example Z7; only the key ideas will be presented here, with the full details relegated to Appendix A. As reviewed in Sec. II A, the anomaly consideration leaves\nG \u00bc SU\u00f07\u00de3=Z7 \u00f035\u00de\nas a viable gauge group configuration in 8d supergravity theories. This still survives the analogous constraints in the dimensionally reduced 6d theories.11 However, additional constraints arise in six dimensions: In order for the 1-form symmetry \u0393 \u00bc Z7 to be gauged, the matter spectrum should lack certain representations that transform under the \u0393 action. To be concrete, the fundamental, the antisymmetric and the adjoint representations under each SU\u00f0N\u00de factor naturally appear in the spectrum as (23) and, respectively, have the center charges,\nqZN \u00f0Rr\u00de \u00bc 1 N ; 2 N ; 0 \u00f0mod 1\u00de: \u00f036\u00de\nOne thus requires that the following \u0393 charge of the representation R \u00bc \u00f0Rri\u00de3i\u00bc1 under G,\nX\ni\nqZni \u00f0Rri\u00de \u00b7 ki; \u00f037\u00de\nshould vanish modulo 1, if matter states in R are to be present in the spectrum at all. Here, the embedding factors ki are fixed as (19) either via the same anomaly consideration as in eight dimensions [5] or via the geometric classification results on the K3 surface fiber Y2 [13]. Note that ri can take the values 0 through 3, where the trivial representation R0 \u00bc 1 with vanishing center charge is included to systematically express the \u0393 charge of R. The vanishing of (37) turns out to restrict the topology of the curve classes bi severely; one can in particular show that the genus gi of each 7-brane locus is strictly positive,\ngi \u2265 1; \u00f038\u00de\nwhich in the end leads to the violation of the Calabi-Yau condition, in that the residual discriminant \u03940 turns out to have its class,\n\u00bd\u03940 \u00bc \u00bd\u0394 \u2212 7\u00f0b1 \u00fe b2 \u00fe b3\u00de \u00bc K\u0304\u229712B2 \u2212 7\u00f0b1 \u00fe b2 \u00fe b3\u00de; \u00f039\u00de\nlie outside of the Mori cone (see Appendix A for the proof). We therefore conclude that Z7 is ruled out as a 1-form gauge sector. As it turns out, we can use the arguments along precisely the same line to also rule out Z8, thereby establishing in particular the definite upper bound of 6 for every cyclic 1-form gauge factor as in (5). The geometric classification results on K3 surfaces [13] also fix the embedding factors for the two double-factor outliers in (6), eventually ruling the latter out in a similar fashion.

II A, its elliptic K3 fiber with the torsional orders (6) is extremal and hence rigid, rendering the elliptic fibration within the K3 almost trivial in that \u03c4 is constant. One might naively think that extremal K3 surfaces can only be fibered over T2. It is known [28], however, that nontrivial smooth fibrations with su\u00f03\u00de holonomy are realizable in certain rigid threefolds, where the K3 fibers may become reducible over points in the P1 base.\n11Unlike in eight dimensions, field-theoretic consideration in six dimensions does not by itself guarantee that G of the form (35) is the only allowed 0-form gauge symmetry with a Z7 quotient. However, thanks to the geometric constraints [13] for the generic K3 fiber Y2, we know that the Z7 quotient leads precisely to (35) for the perturbative 0-form gauge sector even in six dimensions. It thus suffices to rule this unique choice out to show that Z7 is not a viable 6d 1-form gauge factor.\n086021-6\nIn particular, we have\nMW\u00f0Y\u03023\u00deTors \u2243MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors; \u00f042\u00de\nindicating that the 1-form gauge sector of the effective theories with no tensor multiplets should also be subject to the constraints that apply to the theories with tensor multiplets, as long as conformal matter is present. In the rest of this section we will thus focus on the theories without conformal matter. Let us suppose that the fibration (25) has a nontrivial Mordell-Weil torsion MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors with an m-torsional generator. The generic Weierstrass models for such a torsional geometry have the sections f\u2208H0\u00f0P2;OP2\u00f012\u00de\u00de and g\u2208H0\u00f0P2;OP2\u00f018\u00de\u00de naturally constrained to take a particular polynomial form in terms of a collection of sections,\nai;\u03b1i \u2208H 0\u00f0B2; K\u0304\u2297iB2 \u00de\n\u00bc H0\u00f0P2;OP2\u00f03i\u00de\u00de; i \u00bc 1; 2;\u2026; 6; \u00f043\u00de as worked out in [9] for a list of torsion subgroups.12 Here, the second index \u03b1i for each i runs from 1 to Pi \u2208Z\u22650 with Pi representing the number of degree-3i sections, which can be 0, 1 or beyond. As an illustration, the ansatz derived for MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors \u00bc Z2 takes the following form:\nf \u00bc a4;1 \u2212 1\n3 a22;1;\ng \u00bc 1 27 a2;1\u00f02a22;1 \u2212 9a4;1\u00de; \u0394 \u00bc a24;1\u00f04a4;1 \u2212 a22;1\u00de; \u00f044\u00de\nwhere the discriminant \u0394 follows from the expressions for f and g. In our notation, the values of Pi in this example are\nPi \u00bc 1 if i \u00bc 2 or 4 0 otherwise;\n\u00f045\u00de\nand the generic Weierstrass models (44) are described by a total of two sections a2;1 and a4;1 of the line bundles K\u0304 \u22972 B2 and K\u0304\u22974B2 , respectively. Let us denote by P\u00f0\u2265 1\u00de the total number of sections (43) that appear in the polynomial ansatz for f and g, i.e.,\nP \u2254 X6\ni\u00bc1 Pi: \u00f046\u00de\nIf P \u2265 2, we can split the set of ai;\u03b1i into a pair of complementary proper subsets and tune the sections by demanding common linear factors, e.g., zI\u00bc0;1, raised to appropriate powers as\nai;\u03b1i \u00bc ziIbi;\u03b1i for I \u00bc 0; 1; \u00f047\u00de\ndepending on which of the two subsets they belong to.

For instance, in the above example (44), we have P \u00bc 2 so that the tuning (47) goes as\na2;1 \u00bc z20b2;1; \u00f049\u00de\na4;1 \u00bc z41b4;1; \u00f050\u00de\nwhich in turn leads to\nf \u00bc z41b4;1 \u2212 1\n3 z40b 2 2;1; \u00f051\u00de\ng \u00bc 1 27 z20\u00f02z40b22;1 \u2212 9z41b4;1\u00de; \u00f052\u00de\nexhibiting the codimension-two nonminimality at \u00bd0\u22360\u22361 as expected by (48). If P \u00bc 1 on the other hand, f and g are expressible as a power of a unique section,\nai0 \u2208H 0\u00f0P2;OP2\u00f03i0\u00de\u00de; \u00f053\u00de\nwhere i0 divides gcd\u00f04; 6\u00de \u00bc 2, implying that i0 \u00bc 1 or 2. In the former case we have\nf \u221d a41 and g \u221d a61; \u00f054\u00de\nleading to codimension-one nonminimal fibers along the cubic locus a1 \u00bc 0, which we may thus discard. In the latter case we do not have such nonminimal singularities as\nf \u221d a22 and g \u221d a32: \u00f055\u00de\nWe may then tune the section a2 to take the form\na2 \u00bc z0z1b2; b2 \u2208H0\u00f0P2;OP2\u00f04\u00de\u00de; \u00f056\u00de\n12Similar constraints arise even when MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors has two generators, as also exemplified in the same reference.\n13Note that the generic choice of bi;\u03b1i in (47) could in principle result in a partial Higgsing of the non-Abelian 0-form symmetries in case the sections ai;\u03b1i had not been generic to begin with before the tuning. However, this does not affect our discussions about the bounds on the 1-form gauge sector.\n086021-7\nso that the theory develops a conformal matter sector at the point \u00bd0\u22360\u22361 . Therefore, whether P \u2265 2 or P \u00bc 1, the geometry can be tuned within the given m-torsional ansatz to develop an isolated codimension-two nonminimal fiber, allowing us to blow it up in the same fashion as in (40). The resulting effective theory thus acquires a tensor multiplet while the 1-form gauge sector remains intact under the blowup operation at least. Even though the prerequisite tuning operation might possibly have enhanced the 1-form gauge sector, the upper bounds obtained for theories with T \u2265 1 would still apply to those with T \u00bc 0."

            "heading": "IV. HETEROTIC VIEWS ON THE BOUNDS",
            "text": "The F-theoretic bounds obtained in the previous section hinge on the special geometric role played by the rational fiber f, which is a 0-curve in B2.\n14 From the perspective of the effective theory as well, such a rational fiber f in B2 plays a distinguished physical role since the D3 brane wrapped on it leads to an effective heterotic string. In fact such a realization of the heterotic string in F-theory has already played an important role in studying various swampland constraints such as the weak gravity conjectures [30\u201333] and the swampland distance conjecture [33\u201335], and also in constraining the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form gauge sector [8]. In this section we will provide a clean physical intuition for the derived geometric bounds on the 1-form gauge sector in view of this heterotic string. The gauge sector of the 6d supergravity theory then naturally splits into the perturbative sector that is \u201cvisible\u201d to the heterotic string, hence leading to worldsheet global symmetries, and the nonperturbative sector that is invisible on the string worldsheet. Geometrically, the former arises from the 7-brane loci that intersect with f and the latter from the loci that do not, i.e., they are either a fibral or an exceptional P1 in B2. The inclusion relation (33) of the Mordell-Weil torsion then implies the effective theory cannot have (a proper subset of) the center 1-form symmetry of such a nonperturbative sector gauged by itself. In other words, every center gauging must involve the perturbative sector. The perturbative nature of the 1-form gauge symmetries is reminiscent of what is known about the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form gauge symmetries. It was addressed in [8] that the latter should embed into the current algebra of the perturbative heterotic string, based on which the number of U\u00f01\u00de gauge factors was bounded. In geometric terms, this led to the bold proposal for a definite upper bound of 16 for rank\u00f0MW\u00f0Y3\u00de\u00de, which concerns the free part of the MW\u00f0Y3\u00de. The current proposal about the 1-form gauge symmetries on the other hand concerns the torsion part of\nMW\u00f0Y3\u00de and demands in particular that each cyclic factor of MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors be a finite cyclic subgroup of E8 \u00d7 E8 or SO\u00f032\u00de. Interestingly, the maximal such cyclic subgroup occurs for E8 and is known to be Z6 (see, e.g., [36]), agreeing with the constraints derived in III. At this point one may wonder how Z7 and Z8 could be realized as a 1-form gauge factor in 8d supergravity theories even if they are not a subgroup of E8. This naively seems to contradict the developed heterotic perspective. However, a simple explanation comes from the fact that the internal space for the 8d heterotic string theory is simply a two-torus T2. The latter leads to a pair of Kaluza-Klein U\u00f01\u00de s that can in principle enhance to a non-Abelian gauge group in a nongeometric background and also mix with the 10d-induced perturbative sector of maximal rank 16. The perturbative 0-form gauge sector may thus enhance in eight dimensions to a rank-18 non-Abelian group. Motivated by this eight-dimensional phenomenon, we must thus revisit the potential intricate enhancement of the 10d-induced perturbative sector to the 6d N \u00bc \u00f01; 0\u00de supergravity theories. While imposing only the minimal supersymmetry sets the heterotic internal space as a K3 surface, there may still arise a pair of Kaluza-Klein U\u00f01\u00de s, e.g., for a singular geometry. Nevertheless, the indirect observation in [11] via modular curves that Z7 and Z8 cannot serve as a Mordell-Weil torsion informs us that such an enhanced 0-form sector cannot be quotiented by those cyclic groups. We are currently not aware of a simple reasoning based on heterotic worldsheet symmetry that can rule out Z\u22657 even when the mixing of the 10d-induced perturbative sector mixes with Kaluza-Klein U\u00f01\u00de s. In Sec. V, however, we will envision the possibility of having the 6d bulk supergravity theory decompactify to an 8d one at an appropriate limiting regime in the moduli space, where the field-theoretic consideration in [5] would eventually rule those high-order cyclic 1-form sector. Going back to the simple situation where no such intricate mixing arises in the perturbative sector, the derived bound of 6 for each cyclic 1-form gauge factor is also consistent with the worldsheet current generated by the small instanton transitions. We exploited the latter in Sec. III B to address the geometric bounds for F-theory vacua with T \u00bc 0. The codimension-two nonminimal singularities with vanishing orders (48) are well known to correspond to the tensionless E-string, which exhibits an E8 flavor symmetry. Depending on the way this string couples to the bulk gravitational theory, parts of the flavor symmetry are typically gauged. This gauging naturally constrains the representations, U\u00f01\u00de charges and the dimension of the residual Higgs branch (see Ref. [37]). Thus, when performing such an E-string transition, we expect the string to couple to the global 1-form gauge group \u0393 as well. However, such a (partial) gauging is only possible if \u0393 is a subgroup of E8, and hence j\u0393j cannot exceed 6 in the same vein as the heterotic case. 14Recall that for B2 \u00bc P2, we have even enforced a codimension-two nonminimal fiber to be able to blow B2 up so that a 0-curve f may be present in the blown-up base.\n086021-8"

            "text": "In this paper, the general upper bounds on the 1-form gauge sector of 8d supergravity theories have proven to apply also to F-theory compactifications to six dimensions. By focusing on the 6d F-theory vacua conserving precisely eight real supercharges, we have in fact ruled out some of the high-order symmetries that are realizable in 8d supergravity, thereby proposing the following reduced set of viable 1-form gauge symmetries for 6d F-theory vacua:\nZm for 2 \u2264 m \u2264 6 \u00f057\u00de\nZn \u00d7 Zm for \u00f0n;m\u00de \u00bc \u00f02; 2\u00de; \u00f02; 4\u00de; \u00f03; 3\u00de: \u00f058\u00de\nThe geometric derivation of this result has hinged upon the distinguished role played by the ubiquitous rational fibration within the base twofold B2 other than P2. As a key step we have identified the elliptic K3 surface Y2 with the following property:\nMW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors \u2286 MW\u00f0Y2\u00deTors; \u00f059\u00de\nby restricting the elliptic fibration Y3 over B2 to the generic rational fiber of B2. For F-theory vacua with T \u2265 1 tensor multiplets, definite upper bounds on the 6d 1-form gauge sector have thus been established as the known geometric bounds onMW\u00f0Y2\u00deTors. Of the allowed set of Mordell-Weil torsions for K3 surfaces, the following four,\nZm for m \u00bc 7; 8; \u00f060\u00de\nZn \u00d7 Zm for \u00f0n;m\u00de \u00bc \u00f02; 6\u00de; \u00f04; 4\u00de; \u00f061\u00de\nhave been argued not to be viable for MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors by also requiring absence of field-theoretic anomaly, while it is still possible to fiber the relevant rigid K3 surfaces nontrivially over P1. With the 1-form gauge sector of the 6d F-theory vacua identified as MW\u00f0Y3\u00deTors, this leads to the candidates (57) and (58) for 1-form gauge symmetries. On the other hand, for F-theory on elliptic Y3 over B2 \u00bc P2, it has been shown that the theory can be deformed to develop a conformal matter without reducing the 1-form gauge sector; since the tensor transition keeps the latter intact, the same upper bounds apply also to F-theory vacua without tensor multiplets. While the bounds (57) and (58) originate from the geometric constraints on the internal space of F-theory, we have also provided a worldsheet interpretation of this result. That a central role is played by the rational fiber within B2 strongly suggests that the physical object governing the geometric bounds must be the effective heterotic string; the latter can be identified, e.g., as in [8,30\u201333], as a solitonic string arising from the D3 brane wrapped on the rational fiber. Indeed, we have been able to\nrederive the upper bound 6 for the cyclic orders in (57) and (58) from the fact that Z6 is the maximal cyclic Abelian subgroup of E8, at least when the perturbative sector of the six-dimensional bulk theory does not acquire any intricate mixing with the Kaluza-Klein U\u00f01\u00de s. In such a simple situation, the validity of this heterotic interpretation has been addressed by showing that every discrete quotient action on the 0-form gauge sector necessarily invokes the perturbative sector. Interestingly, such a desired perturbative nature of the 1-form gauge sector has immediately followed from the inclusion relation (59) derived in F-theory. We have also observed as an aside that the upper bound of 6 is also consistent with the E-string transitions, where the relevant \u0393 quotient needs to embed into the E8 flavor group. To some extent the advocated perturbative nature of the 1-form gauge sector nicely parallels that of theU\u00f01\u00de 0-form gauge sector of 6d F-theory vacua with T \u2265 1. It was proven in [8] that every U\u00f01\u00de gauge factor, if present in the 0-form gauge sector of such theories, must embed into the perturbative current algebra of the effective heterotic string. Interestingly, the geometric origins of the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form and the 1-form gauge sectors are, respectively, the free and the torsional sectors of the Mordell-Weil group. The heterotic interpretation of the Abelian 0-form gauge sector led in [8] to the geometric conjecture that\nrank\u00f0MW\u00f0Y3\u00de\u00de \u2264 16; \u00f062\u00de\nfor an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold. In fact, already from the purely geometric perspective, the inclusion (59) leads to a milder bound of 18 since any elliptic K3 surface Y2 obeys\nrank\u00f0MW\u00f0Y2\u00de\u00de \u2264 18; \u00f063\u00de\nwhich follows from the Tate-Shioda-Wazir thoerem, so that\nrank\u00f0MW\u00f0Y3\u00de\u00de \u2264 rank\u00f0MW\u00f0Y2\u00de\u00de \u2264 18: \u00f064\u00de\nThere is a chance that the bound (62) might possibly be violated since the rank-16 current algebra of the 10d heterotic string can in principle enhance in a compactified theory, for instance, by mixing with a pair of Kaluza-Klein U\u00f01\u00de s. Whether the milder upper bound (64) could indeed be realized in an explicit 6d F-theory vacuum is yet to be clarified. While both the 1-form and the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form gauge sectors are perturbatively realized from the heterotic perspective, the addressed extension of the constraints (57) and (58) on the former to F-theory models with T \u00bc 0 does not have a natural counterpart on the latter. Those T \u00bc 0 models can always be deformed to develop a conformal matter sector, which then lead to T \u2265 1 models through a tensor transition. It was thus crucial that the deformation of our choice does not reduce the 1-form\n086021-9\ngauge sector, in arguing that the upper bounds on the 1-form sector of the latter models also bound that of the former. However, without generic ansatz available for U\u00f01\u00de models in F-theory for a given positive rank, it is not clear how to find a systematic way to deform the models in a similar fashion, not reducing the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form sector along the way. The rank bound (64) thus remains conjectural for T \u00bc 0 models. Let us end with several extensions and applications of the current work, organized by the dimension D of the spacetime in which the physics phenomena of interest take place.\nA.

            "text": "Our geometric bounds on the 1-form gauge sector in 6d F-theory have been built upon the analogous 8d bounds. However, there is a notable difference between the 6d and the 8d constraints: the latter can be derived by the absence of gauge anomalies, which provides a purely effective field theoretic perspective. One may then naturally attempt to also promote the geometric bounds in 6d to a general swampland constraint. The geometric arguments in this paper suggest that one could achieve this by decompactifying the starting 6d N \u00bc \u00f01; 0\u00de supergravity theory to an 8d supergravity endowed with the defect sector of a particular kind. Such a decompactification, if viewed as an F-theoretic deformation, corresponds to taking an infinitedistance limit in the K\u00e4hler moduli space, where the base P1 of (28) expands while the fibral P1 remains finite. One could thus analyze the obvious counterpart limit in supergravity to show that the resulting theory indeed decompactifies to begin with. Since this supergravity limit itself lies at infinite distance, it is natural to expect decompactification to occur, in line with the emergent string conjecture [38]. Importantly, the 1-form gauge sector needs to be in good control along the way, as is the case for the prescribed 8d decompactification in F-theory. We leave it to future work to develop a general effective-theoretic picture for the desired, controlled decompactification."

In these infinite-distance complex structure limits, several 7-brane stacks each carrying a 0-form Lie-type gauge algebra collide to enhance the symmetry to an emergent affine algebra. Geometrically, such an affine enhancement of the 0-form gauge algebra is realized by the nonminimal singularities in codimension-one fibers of the elliptic Calabi-Yau manifold.\nIn view of this, it is intriguing that the geometric bounds (4) and (6) for elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds were understood in [11] as the orders of the cyclic groups beyond which codimension-two nonminimal singularities at infinite distance arise. In other words, demanding that the 1-form gauge sector violate the bounds enforces the brane moduli to sit at infinite distance, resulting in a decompactification [39]. We leave a thorough investigation of this intriguing connection with infinite distance limits to future work.\nB. Mirror (D= 6)"

In view of the torsional bounds (5), it is therefore conjectured that the n-section geometry Z3 should also obey\nn \u2264 6: \u00f065\u00de\nExplicit geometric constructions known to date of the multisection geometry are consistent with the bound (65). The highest n that has so far been achieved is 5, which is realized via non-Abelian gauged linear sigma models [45] and attempts are made to construct explicit examples with a 6-section. While the bound (65) for multisection geometry arises from the mirror conjecture, which is purely geometric and construction dependent in nature, the heterotic interpretation in Sec. IV leads to an interesting string-theoretic intuition as follows. We first recall that compactifications of F-theory on Y3 and Z3 result in effective theories withZn 1-form and 0-form gauge symmetries, respectively. In particular, the constraint (65) is understood as the upper bound for the discrete 0-form gauge symmetry Zn. From the heterotic perspective, one can naturally obtain the latter by embedding16 into E8 a gauge bundle with structure group G of the form\nG \u00bc G\u0302=Zn \u2282 E8; \u00f066\u00de\n15The mirror conjecture for fibrations is based on the mirror duality established for the elliptic curves and their generic structures. Strong evidence of the conjecture arises from explicit toric constructions [40,41] and more generally in the context of gauged linear sigma models [42]. Also see Refs. [43,44] for the heterotic/F-theory duality perspective.\n16To be most general, we should consider embeddings of a gauge bundle into the full 10d heterotic current algebra potentially mixed with a pair of Kaluza-Klein U(1)s and rearranged afterwards. Here, we assume embeddings into E8 only for simplicity of presentation; the physical intuition behind the mirror conjecture works in full generality.\n086021-10\nwhere G\u0302 is a simply-connected Lie group (or a product of such factors). This results in the 0-form gauge symmetry with a discrete Zn factor,\nH \u00bc Zn \u00d7 H\u0302 \u2282 E8; \u00f067\u00de\nwhere H\u0302 is the commutant of G\u0302 in E8. To turn the tables around, one can consider a gauge bundle with structure group H\u0302 endowed with an Zn-holonomy instanton to obtain G as the effective gauge group, so that a discrete Zn 1-form symmetry is realized instead. The heterotic string thus provides us with the physical intuition behind the geometric mirror conjecture, pairing an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold Y3 with a genus-one fibered Z3. In particular, we conclude from this dual heterotic perspective that the upper bound 6 must apply not only to the 1-form but also to the 0-form factors, conforming with the geometric conjecture (65). Strictly speaking, however, the physical argument above is clear only for F-theory models with T \u2265 1. It would be worth clarifying if this heterotic perspective extends to the models with T \u00bc 0."

            "heading": "2. Bounds on U\u00f01\u00de charges",
            "text": "We emphasize that the aforementioned heterotic intuition behind the mirror conjecture relies heavily on the perturbative nature of the 1-form gauge sector as addressed in Sec. IV, as well as that of the discrete 0-form gauge sector. The latter follows from the observation in [8] that U\u00f01\u00de 0-form gauge factors of 6d F-theory vacua should lie entirely in the perturbative sector. Presuming that a Zn 0-form gauge factor arises from the Higgsing of U\u00f01\u00de, the former should also be perturbative in nature. In view of this Higgsing phenomenon, we are naturally lead to the closely related conjecture that the U\u00f01\u00de charges q of the matter states must be subject to\nq \u2264 6; \u00f068\u00de\nfor any F-theory models with T \u2265 1. This conjecture is particularly interesting in view of recent attempts of classifying possible U\u00f01\u00de charges in 6d F-theory (see e.g. [46\u201351]). While the conjectured charge bound (68) does not necessarily apply to the models on B2 \u00bc P2, it is particularly interesting to note that models on Hirzebruch surfaces were proposed in [50] to have matter states with a U\u00f01\u00de charge as large as 21. The apparent conflict between the conjectured bound (68) and the proposed models with such a large U\u00f01\u00de charge would in principle be resolved by carefully analyzing the specific Higgsing processes assumed. On the one hand, particular chains of Higgsings are required in [50], both for non-Abelian and for (intermediate) multiple-U\u00f01\u00de gauge theories; if any of them fail to be realized in F-theory the proposed models\nwill not exist. On the other hand, our bound (68) assumes that any matter state with a U\u00f01\u00de charge q could acquire a vacuum expectation value (VEV) to break U\u00f01\u00de to a Zq 0-form gauge factor. It will be interesting to clarify which Higgsing assumptions are invalid and also find the rationale behind such an obstruction, from the perspectives of both the geometry and the effective theory.17\nC. Compactification (D= 4)\nAs already emphasized, the key to our geometric derivation of the bounds (4) is the presence of a P1 fibration within the F-theory base B2, with the exception of B2 \u00bc P2, which, nevertheless, can be blown up without reducing the 1-form gauge sector. In order to extend our results to 4d F-theory models, we must argue that B3 also admits a P1 fibration. Interestingly, a birational characterization of the F-theory base threefolds has recently been accomplished in terms of the so-called Fano towers of fibrations [53,54]. This suggests that the following two exceptions to a P1 fibration should be analyzed: (1) B3 \u00bc P3. (2) B3 \u00bc a P2 fibration over P1. In the former case, the same tuning used for B2 \u00bc P2 in Sec. III B enables us to develop codimension-two nonminimal fibers along a line, which, once blown up, will turn B3 \u00bc P3 into a P2 fibration over P1, which falls into the latter type. Similarly, the base B3 of this latter type can be tuned within the torsional ansatz in a similar fashion, this time by choosing two toric coordinates of theP2 fiber as the analog of the linear factors in (47). The common zero locus of these two toric divisors is a section of the P2 fibration. Blowing up the threefold B3 along this section results in B\u03023, which is a fibration of the Hirzebruch surfaces F1, which may as well be interpreted as a P1 fibration over yet another Hirzebruch surface. This assures that the torsional constraints (4) persist in the elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds Y4 \u2192 B3, thereby establishing the same bounds also on the 1-form gauge sector of 4d N \u00bc 1 F-theory vacua. Note, however, that this only constrains the 1-form gauge sector realized by the geometry alone. Unlike in 6d F-theory models, the 0-form gauge group of a 7-brane stack may be broken by gauge fluxes, which may in principle serve as an independent source of a 1-form gauge symmetry even for the nonperturbative sector, to which our heterotic argument based on E8 embedding does not apply.\n17For instance, for the U\u00f01\u00de Higgsing to be realizable in the effective theory, it is necessary that more than one Higgs field exists and acquires a VEV, so that D-flatness is satisfied. From this effective theory consideration alone, our conjectured bound (65) on discrete 0-form gauge factor does not rule out any potential models in which precisely one massless field is charged under U\u00f01\u00de with a large charge q > 6. It is not clear, however, if such models can exist at all to begin with (see, e.g., [52]).\n086021-11\nRelatedly, it has recently been proposed [55] that flux breaking of a non-Abelian group may possibly lead to the Cartan U\u00f01\u00de s, a particular linear combination of which may admit a charged matter with charge as large as 657, far beyond the torsional bound of 6. Unless the matter fields with such a large U\u00f01\u00de charge q \u226b 6 face a fundamental obstruction in acquiring a VEV, the U\u00f01\u00de 0-form symmetry of the theory can be Higgsed to Zq. In view of the mirror conjecture, this may serve as an indication for the existence of a 4d F-theory model with a Zq 1-form gauge factor, where q violates the torsional bound. It would be interesting to extend our constraints on the perturbative 1-form gauge symmetry to such a nonperturbative sector.\nD. Decomposition (D= 2)\nAnother interesting direction worth pursuing further arises from the worldsheet theories of the BPS noncritical strings that couple to bulk tensor fields. As was briefly mentioned in Sec. II, many of the seemingly consistent configurations for the 0-form gauge sector can be successfully ruled out [26] by requiring the unitarity of the 2d superconformal field theories (SCFTs), to which the worldsheet theories of such BPS strings flow in the infrared. However, this approach has not been strong enough to rule out all configurations known so far, which are believed to eventually be ruled out. Also, the consistency of the exceptional configurations such as G \u00bc SU\u00f07\u00de3=Z7, which arise from the choices of the 1-form gauge sector with \u00f0n;m\u00de from (6), remain agnostic from the unitarity consideration of such string probes alone. On the other hand, one might expect that the 1-form gauge sector descends to the 2d SCFTs as a global symmetry, as is the case for the 0-form sector [56]. It is therefore worth questioning if any other world-sheettheoretic notions, e.g., that of decomposition [57], which addresses the equivalence between two-dimensional quantum field theories with 1-form global symmetries and disjoint unions of other theories, might possibly lead us to novel consistency constraints on the 6d bulk supergravity theories. It would be very interesting to clarify if and how the string worldsheet theories reflect the nonsimplyconnected nature of the 1-form global symmetry in a nontrivial fashion."

Let us first recall from Sec. III A that the choice (A1) made for the 1-form gauge sector uniquely fixes the 0-form gauge group G as\nG \u00bc SU\u00f07\u00de3=Z7; \u00f0A2\u00de\nwhich follows from the geometric classification of elliptic K3 surfaces [13]. Here, each simply-connected factor, G\u0302i \u00bc SU\u00f07\u00de for i \u00bc 1, 2, 3, arises, in the language of the CalabiYau threefold Y3, from the singular fibers of Kodaira type I7 along the curve in B2 of class bi. We denote the genus and self-intersection number of each such curve by gi and ni, respectively. As explained around (37), the embedding factors ki are given as\n\u00f0k1; k2; k3\u00de \u00bc \u00f01; 2; 3\u00de; \u00f0A3\u00de\nso that the four representations \u00f0Rr\u00de4r\u00bc0 under each SU\u00f07\u00dei contribute to the \u0393 charge, q\u0393\u00f0R\u00de, of R \u00bc \u00f0Rri\u00de3i\u00bc1 as\nqZn1 \u00f0Rr\u00de \u00b7 k1 \u00bc 0; 1 7 ; 2 7 ; 0;\nqZn2 \u00f0Rr\u00de \u00b7 k2 \u00bc 0; 2 7 ; 4 7 ; 0;\nqZn3 \u00f0Rr\u00de \u00b7 k3 \u00bc 0; 3 7 ; 6 7 ; 0; \u00f0A4\u00de\nif they occur in R.

Suppose now that a given representationR appears in the spectrum. Then, its \u0393 charge q\u0393\u00f0R\u00de in (37) necessarily vanishes modulo 1. In view of (A4), we thus observe for a fixed ith simple factor that if R transforms as R1 under Gi then it should transform as R2 under some other Gi0. In other words, if ri \u00bc 1, then ri0 \u00bc 2 for some i0 \u2260 i. Similarly, it also follows that if ri \u00bc 2, then ri0 \u00bc 1 for some i0 \u2260 i. This simple observation then leads to the following constraints on the total multiplicities \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 for the given ith sector:\n\u03bc1 \u00bc ni \u00fe 16\u00f01 \u2212 gi\u00de\u00bc! 21m1; \u00f0A5\u00de\n\u03bc2 \u00bc ni \u00fe 1 \u2212 gi\u00bc! 7m2; \u00f0A6\u00de\n086021-12\nfor m1; m2 \u2208Z\u22650, where we have used (23) for the multiplicities.

This way, we will have concluded that Z7 cannot be realized as a 1-form gauge sector. In the rest of this Appendix, we thus prove this inconsistency by considering in turn the following three types of the base twofold:\nB2 \u00bc P2; Fa and BlkFa with k > 0: \u00f0A13\u00de\n1.

Invoking the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem (A24), we once again learn that gi \u00bc 0 for si \u00bc 0 and 1, and hence that si \u2265 2, contradicting (A22)."

            "text": "In this Appendix we show that the 1-form gauge sector of the form\n\u0393 \u00bc Z4 \u00d7 Z4 or Z2 \u00d7 Z6 \u00f0B1\u00de\nleads to inconsistency in geometry. The arguments will largely parallel those in Appendix Awhere the \u0393 \u00bc Z7 case was analyzed in detail. As in the latter case, demanding the 1-form gauge sector to take either of the two cases (B1) highly constrains the geometry of K3 surfaces so that the 0-form gauge group G, as well as the embedding factors of the \u0393 action on its simply-connected cover G\u0302, is uniquely fixed. Specifically, for \u0393 \u00bc Z4 \u00d7 Z4, the global gauge group is determined as\nG \u00bc SU\u00f04\u00de6=\u00f0Z4 \u00d7 Z4\u00de \u00f0B2\u00de\nwith the embedding factors of the order-4 generators given by [58]\nk\u00f04;1\u00de \u00bc \u00f00; 2; 1; 1; 1; 1\u00de; k\u00f04;2\u00de \u00bc\u00f01; 1; 0; 2; 3; 1\u00de: \u00f0B3\u00de\nOn the other hand, for \u0393 \u00bc Z2 \u00d7 Z6 we have the gauge group\nG \u00bc \u00f0SU\u00f02\u00de3 \u00d7 SU\u00f06\u00de3\u00de=\u00f0Z2 \u00d7 Z6\u00de; \u00f0B4\u00de\nwhere the Z2 and Z6 quotients act with the embedding factors,\nk\u00f02\u00de \u00bc \u00f00; 1; 1; 0; 3; 3\u00de; k\u00f06\u00de \u00bc \u00f01; 1; 0; 5; 5; 2\u00de: \u00f0B5\u00de\nSimilarly to the \u0393 \u00bc Z7 case in Appendix A, the embedding structures (B3) and (B5) for the double-factor \u0393 do not allow for \u0393-neutral representations, except possibly for high-rank tensor representations, unless the adjoint representations are involved.18 Then, a contradiction arises once again as the six nonrational discriminantal components result in a noneffective residual discriminant \u03940. We will close this Appendix by sketching the latter. First, for the base twofold B2 \u00bc P2, the six simple factors of both gauge groups, (B2) and (B4), are associated with the curve classes,\nbi \u00bc liH; i \u00bc 1;\u2026; 6; \u00f0B6\u00de\nof the non-Abelian loci, each supporting singular fibers of Kodaira type Ini with ni \u00bc 2, 4, or 6. Here, H is the hyperplane class and the individual degrees li must obey li \u2265 3 so that the genus of each curve may be strictly positive. Therefore, for each 1-form gauge group \u0393 in (B1), the combined class,\nb \u2254 X6\ni\u00bc1 nibi; \u00f0B7\u00de\nof the collective locus of the Ini loci, weighted with the individual vanishing orders ni, is subject to\n\u0393 \u00bc Z4 \u00d7 Z4\u2236 b \u00bc 4 X6\ni\u00bc1 li\nH \u2265 72H; \u00f0B8\u00de\n\u0393 \u00bc Z2 \u00d7 Z6\u2236 b \u00bc 2 X3\ni\u00bc1 li\nH \u00fe 6\nX6 i\u00bc4 li H \u2265 72H:\n\u00f0B9\u00de\nThe residual discriminant thus receives an upper bound,\n\u00bd\u03940 \u00bc K\u0304\u229712 P2 \u2212 b \u2264 \u221236H; \u00f0B10\u00de\nwhich contradicts its effectiveness.\n18In the \u0393 \u00bc Z2 \u00d7 Z6 case, given the embedding factors (B5), lower-rank tensors of SU\u00f06\u00de3, e.g., \u00f06; 6; 6\u00de, can be used to form \u0393-neutral representations. However, we believe that no brane configurations can realize such neutral representations at finite distance.\n086021-14\nEssentially the same line of arguments can be applied to the base twofolds B2 \u00bc Fa or their blowups; we will present the analysis of the former type, which straightforwardly generalizes to the latter as in Appendix A. Denoting the curve classes of the Ini loci as\nbi \u00bc siS\u00fe fiF; i \u00bc 1;\u2026; 6; \u00f0B11\u00de\nin terms of the section and the fiber classes, S and F, of Fa, we require that the sectional degrees si obey si \u2265 2 so that each curve may have a strictly positive genus. Next we turn to the combined class,\nb \u2254 X6\ni\u00bc1 nibi; \u00f0B12\u00de\nof the collective locus, especially to its sectional degree,\ns \u2254 X6\ni\u00bc1 nisi: \u00f0B13\u00de\nFor each 1-form gauge group \u0393 in (B1), the aforementioned constraints si \u2265 2 on the individual degrees lead to\n\u0393 \u00bc Z4 \u00d7 Z4\u2236 s \u00bc 4 X6\ni\u00bc1 si \u2265 48; \u00f0B14\u00de\n\u0393 \u00bc Z2 \u00d7 Z6\u2236 s \u00bc 2 X3\ni\u00bc1 si \u00fe 6\nX6 i\u00bc4 si \u2265 48: \u00f0B15\u00de\nAccordingly, the residual discriminant,\n\u00bd\u03940 \u00bc K\u0304\u229712 P2 \u2212 b; \u00f0B16\u00de\nreceives an upper bound on its sectional degree,\n24 \u2212 s \u2264 \u221224; \u00f0B17\u00de\ncontradicting the effectiveness of \u00bd\u03940 .\n[1] D.
