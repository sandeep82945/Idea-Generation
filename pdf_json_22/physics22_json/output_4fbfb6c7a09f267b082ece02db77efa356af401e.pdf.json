It is conjectured that the bulk dense matter may be composed of strangeons, which are quark clusters with nearly equal numbers of u, d, and s quarks. To characterize the strong-repulsive interaction at short distance and the nonrelativistic nature of strangeons, a phenomenological Lennard-Jones model with two parameters is used to describe the EOS of strangeon stars (SSs). For the first time, we investigate the oscillation modes of non-rotating SSs and obtain their frequencies for various parameterizations of the EOS. We find that the properties of radial oscillations of SSs are different from those of NSs, especially for stars with relatively low central energy densities. Moreover, we calculate the f -mode frequency of nonradial oscillations of SSs within the relativistic Cowling approximation. The frequencies of the f -mode of SSs are found to be in the range from 6.7 kHz to 8.7 kHz. Finally, we study the universal relations between the f -mode frequency and global properties of SSs, such as the compactness and the tidal deformability. The results we obtained are relevant to pulsar timing and gravitational waves, and will help to probe NSs\u2019 EOSs and infer nonperturbative behaviours in quantum chromodynamics.",

            "text": "The equation of state (EOS) of nuclear dense matter plays a crucial role in many astrophysical phenomena associated with neutron stars (NSs; Ozel et al. 2010; Lattimer & Prakash 2007; Abbott et al. 2018). Owing to the non-perturbative properties of the strong interaction at low energy, the EOS of dense matters at several nuclear densities still remains unknown. Witten (1984) conjectured that the true ground state of the dense matter is quark matter composed of almost free \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc51, and \ud835\udc60 quarks. The pulsar-like compact objects should be quark stars (QSs) rather than conventional NSs. The MIT bag model with almost free quarks (Alcock et al. 1986) and the colorsuperconductivity state model (Alford et al. 2008) have been used in literature to study QSs. In 2003, Xu (2003) proposed that the constituting units of the supranuclear matter could be strange quark clusters, since the non-perturbative strong interaction may render quarks grouped in clusters. Each quark cluster is composed of several quarks (including \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc51, and \ud835\udc60 flavors) condensing in position space rather than in momentum space. A name \u201cstrangeon\u201d is coined to these strange \u201cnucleons\u201d (Xu &Guo 2017; Lai & Xu 2017). In this sense, compressed baryonic matter could be in a state of strangeons, and pulsar-like compact stars could thus be strangeon stars (SSs). Strangeon matter, similar to strange quark matter, is composed of nearly equal numbers of \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc51, and \ud835\udc60 quarks. However, different from strange quark matter, quarks in strangeon matter are localized inside\n\u2605 gaoyong.physics@pku.edu.cn \u2020 lshao@pku.edu.cn \u2021 r.x.xu@pku.edu.cn\nstrangeons due to the strong coupling between quarks. There are differences and similarities among NSs, QSs, and SSs. On the one hand, quarks are thought to be localized in strangeons in SSs, like neutrons in NSs. On the other hand, a strangeon , with light-flavour symmetry restoration of quark, may contain more than three valence quarks. In addition, the matter at the surface of SSs is strangeon matter, i.e., SSs are self-bound by the strong force, like QSs (Xu 2003). These properties are fundamental to a few important astrophysical observables. A sophisticated study on various global parameters of rotating SSs, including mass, radius, moment of inertia, tidal deformability, quadrupole moments, and shape parameters, was carried out by Gao et al. (2022).\nSSs can account for many current observational facts in astrophysics. The EOS of SSs could be very stiff to explain the observed massive pulsars (Demorest et al. 2010; Antoniadis et al. 2013). The magnetospheric activity of SSs was discussed in Xu et al. (1999). Lu et al. (2019) explained the sub-pulse drifting of radio pulsars using the properties at the surface of SSs. Also, pulsar glitches could be the result of star-quakes (Peng & Xu 2008; Zhou et al. 2004, 2014), and a detailed modeling of the glitch behaviours confronted with observations was discussed in Lai et al. (2018b). The model of SSs can be extended to explain the glitch activity of normal radio pulsars (Wang et al. 2020). Recent studies (Lai et al. 2019, 2018a, 2021) have investigated the tidal deformability as well as the ejecta and light curve of merging binary SSs, showing consistency with the observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2017) and itsmultiwavelength electromagnetic counterparts (Kasliwal et al. 2017; Kasen et al. 2017).\nOwing to the difficulties in determining the EOS of pulsar-like\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n09 40\n7v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 2\nSe p\n20 22\ncompact stars from first principles, observations from different channels become important avenues in studying the EOS at high density, which can in turn be used to constrain microscopic laws (Ozel et al. 2010). In this respect, GW asteroseismology that deals with oscillation modes offers a promising channel in the new era of GWs (Andersson & Kokkotas 1998; Benhar et al. 2004; Doneva et al. 2013; Andersson 2019). It is the focus of this study. Radial oscillations of stellar models were studied in the pioneering works of Chandrasekhar (1964a,b). Notably, the properties of radial oscillations can give information about the stability and the EOS of compact stars. The first exhaustive compilation of radial oscillations for different zero-temperature EOSs was presented by Glass & Lindblom (1983). In Vaeth & Chanmugam (1992), the properties of radial modes of quark stars (QSs) were investigated. Furthermore, the study of radial oscillations of zero-temperature NSs can be extended to proto-NSs (Gondek et al. 1997). Because the EOS of proto-NSs is significantly softer than that of zero-temperature NSs, their spectra of the radial oscillation modes are very different. It is worth noting that Kokkotas & Ruoff (2001) presented a useful survey on the radial oscillation modes of NSs for various EOSs. Based on the equations presented by Misner et al. (1973), they showed that the derivatives in the linear differential equation can be written in the form of a self-adjoint differential operator. In this work, we calculate the frequencies of the first three radial modes of SSs using the method of the self-adjoint differential operator (Kokkotas & Ruoff 2001). By that we can investigate the properties of radial oscillations of SSs in detail and study the stability of SSs rigorously. Nonradial oscillations of relativistic stars were studied in the pioneering work of Thorne & Campolattaro (1967). The oscillation modes are damped out due to the emission of GWs, so these oscillation modes are called quasinormal modes (QNMs). For typical nonrotating relativistic fluid stars, QNMs are classified in polar and axial categories. The polar modes include the fundamental ( \ud835\udc53 ) modes, pressure (\ud835\udc5d) modes, and gravity (\ud835\udc54) modes. The axial modes only have the spacetime (\ud835\udc64) modes, which are directly associated with the spacetime metric and have no analogy in the Newtonian theory of stellar pulsations (Kokkotas & Schutz 1992). A detailed discussion about the relativistic perturbation equations was given in many works (see e.g., Lindblom&Detweiler 1983; Detweiler & Lindblom 1985; Chandrasekhar & Ferrari 1991; Allen et al. 1998; Kokkotas & Schmidt 1999). Using the Cowling approximation (Cowling 1941), Sotani et al. (2011) calculated nonradial oscillations of NSs with hadron-quark mixed phase transition. Besides, Doneva & Yazadjiev (2012) investigated nonradial oscillations of anisotropic NSs with polytropic EOSs. In Das et al. (2021), the impact of the dark matter on the f-mode was also studied. The \ud835\udc53 -mode of NSs, QSs, and SSs is important for several reasons: (i) it depends on the EOS of compact stars; (ii) it is expected to be excited in many astrophysical scenarios and leads to efficient GW emission; (iii) its frequency is lower than other QNMs such as that of the \ud835\udc5d-modes and the \ud835\udc64-modes, hence the \ud835\udc53 -mode oscillation is most likely to be detectable with a third-generation detector like the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer (Punturo et al. 2010; Sathyaprakash et al. 2019; Kalogera et al. 2021), or even in an optimal case by the current generation LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors (Abbott et al. 2019b, 2022; Abe et al. 2022). In this work, we calculate the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency of SSs in the Cowling approximation and compare the results with those of NSs and QSs. GW observation will be a powerful tool to study the EOS of compact stars in particular in the case that we have good empirical formulas for the QNMs as functions of stellar parameters. Indeed, universal empirical formulas relating the dynamical responses of\na compact star under external perturbations\u2014such as the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency, the tidal and rotational deformations\u2014to its global physical parameters\u2014such as the mass, the radius, and the moment of inertia\u2014have been discovered for NSs and QSs. For example, the I-Love-Q relations, discovered by Yagi & Yunes (2013a,b), relate the moment of inertia \ud835\udc3c, the tidal deformability \ud835\udf06, and the spin induced quadrupole moment\ud835\udc44. Another example is the relation for the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency, the moment of inertia, and the tidal deformability (see e.g., Chan et al. 2014). Sotani & Kumar (2021) have investigated various universal relations between several oscillation modes and the tidal deformability. Inspired by works on the universal relations for single NSs (Andersson & Kokkotas 1998; Benhar et al. 2004; Doneva et al. 2013; Yagi&Yunes 2013a,b), recent studies have investigated various universal relations between the binary tidal deformability and the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency of the post-merger remnant of a binary NS system using numerical relativity simulations (Bernuzzi et al. 2015b; Rezzolla & Takami 2016; Kiuchi et al. 2020). It is worth noting that, Kr\u00fcger &Kokkotas (2020b) andManoharan et al. (2021) calculated the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency for fast rotating NSs without using the Cowling approximation, and discovered a relation between the pre-merger tidal deformability and the dominant oscillation frequency (i.e., \ud835\udc53 -mode) of the post-merger remnant of a binary NS system. Meanwhile, using the universal relation of \ud835\udc53 -mode (Kr\u00fcger & Kokkotas 2020b; Manoharan et al. 2021), V\u00f6lkel et al. (2021) and V\u00f6lkel & Kr\u00fcger (2022) studied the Bayesian inverse problem of rotating NSs. In this work, we will study the universal relation between the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency and the tidal deformability of SSs, which will be a useful input for comparisons among NSs, QSs, and SSs. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce the EOS of SSs and obtain the structure of non-rotating SSs. Based on the background solutions, in Sec. 3, we integrate the equations of relativistic radial oscillations to determine the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency for different EOSs of SSs. In Sec. 4, we calculate the frequency of nonradial \ud835\udc53 -mode and the tidal deformability of SSs. New fits of universal relation between them are discussed. Finally, we summarize our work in Sec. 5. Throughout the paper, we adopt geometric units with \ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc3a = 1, where \ud835\udc50 and\ud835\udc3a denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant respectively. The metric signature is (\u2212 , + , + , +)."

            "text": "We assume that the interaction potential between two strangeons is described by the Lennard-Jones potential (Jones 1924; Lai & Xu 2009; Gao et al. 2022),\n\ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc5f) = 4\ud835\udf16 [(\ud835\udf0e\n\ud835\udc5f )12 \u2212 (\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc5f )6] , (1)\nwhere \ud835\udf16 is the depth of the potential, \ud835\udc5f is the distance between two strangeons, and \ud835\udf0e is the distance when \ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc5f) = 0. We note that this potential has the property of short-distance repulsion and longdistance attraction. According to the results of early studies (Xu 2003; Lai & Xu 2009; Gao et al. 2022), the potential energy density is given by\n\ud835\udf0cp = 2\ud835\udf16 ( \ud835\udc3412\ud835\udf0e 12\ud835\udc5b5 \u2212 \ud835\udc346\ud835\udf0e6\ud835\udc5b3 ) , (2)\nwhere \ud835\udc3412 = 6.2, \ud835\udc346 = 8.4, and \ud835\udc5b is the number density of strangeons. The total energy density of zero-temperature dense matter composed of strangeons reads\n\ud835\udf0c = 2\ud835\udf16 ( \ud835\udc3412\ud835\udf0e 12\ud835\udc5b5 \u2212 \ud835\udc346\ud835\udf0e6\ud835\udc5b3 ) + \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc41q\ud835\udc5aq , (3)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20138 (2022)\nwhere \ud835\udc41q\ud835\udc5aq is the mass of a strangeon with \ud835\udc41q being the number of quarks in a strangeon and \ud835\udc5aq being the quark mass. In the above equation the contributions from degenerate electrons and vibrations of the lattice are neglected. From the first law of thermodynamics, one derives the pressure\n\ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc5b2 d(\ud835\udf0c/\ud835\udc5b) d\ud835\udc5b\n= 4\ud835\udf16 ( 2\ud835\udc3412\ud835\udf0e12\ud835\udc5b5 \u2212 \ud835\udc346\ud835\udf0e6\ud835\udc5b3 ) . (4)\nAt the surface of SSs, the pressure becomes zero and we obtain the surface number density of strangeons as [ \ud835\udc346/(2\ud835\udc3412\ud835\udf0e6) ]1/2. For convenience, we transform it to the number density of baryons\n\ud835\udc5bs = ( \ud835\udc346 2\ud835\udc3412 )1/2 \ud835\udc41q 3\ud835\udf0e3 . (5)\nFor a given number of quarks \ud835\udc41q in a strangeon, the EOS of SSs is completely determined by the depth of the potential \ud835\udf16 and the number density of baryons \ud835\udc5bs at the surface of the star. An 18-quark cluster, called quark-alpha (Michel 1991), can be completely symmetric in spin, flavor, and color spaces. Therefore, we set \ud835\udc41q = 18 in our calculation as a reasonable example. Besides the EOS of SSs, we also consider six EOSs of NSs and QSs for comparison, including four popular nuclear matter EOSs for NSs, AP4 (Akmal & Pandharipande 1997), SLy4 (Douchin & Haensel 2001), MS0, and MS2 (Mueller & Serot 1996), as well as two QS models, the MIT bag model with a bag constant \ud835\udc35 = 60MeV fm\u22123 (Alcock et al. 1986) and SQM3 (Lattimer & Prakash 2001).1 The corresponding density-pressure relations for these EOSs are depicted in Fig. 1. We denote the EOSs of SSs using their values of \ud835\udc5bs and \ud835\udf16 . For example, \u201cLX2430\u201d means a surface baryon number density \ud835\udc5bs = 0.24 fm\u22123 and a potential depth \ud835\udf16 = 30MeV. We consider the unperturbed relativistic star to be described by a perfect fluid. The energy-momentum tensor is \ud835\udc47\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08 = (\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc43)\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf08 + \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc54\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08 . The static and spherically symmetric metric, which describes an equilibrium relativistic star, is given by the line element,\nd\ud835\udc602 = \u2212\ud835\udc522\u03a6d\ud835\udc612 + \ud835\udc522\u039bd\ud835\udc5f2 + \ud835\udc5f2 (d\ud835\udf032 + sin2 \ud835\udf03d\ud835\udf192) , (6)\nwhere \u03a6 and \u039b are metric functions of \ud835\udc5f. A mass function \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5f) is\n1 Notice that, the nucleonic EOSs, MS0 and MS2, have similar properties as SSs of higher maximum masses.\ndefined as \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc5f (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc52\u22122\u039b)/2, which satisfies d\ud835\udc5a d\ud835\udc5f = 4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f2\ud835\udf0c , (7)\nwhere \ud835\udf0c is the energy density. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that determine the pressure \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5f) and the metric function \u03a6(\ud835\udc5f) are expressed as d\ud835\udc43 d\ud835\udc5f = \u2212(\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc43) d\u03a6 d\ud835\udc5f , (8)\nd\u03a6 d\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc5a + 4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f3\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc5f \u2212 2\ud835\udc5a) . (9)\nIntegrating Eqs. (7), (8) and (9) combined with the EOS, one obtains the stellar structure of spherical stars and the spacetime geometry. In Fig. 2, we show themass-radius relations for NSs, QSs, and SSs using the aforementioned EOSs. The EOSs of SSs are very stiff because the strangeons are nonrelativistic and there is a very strong repulsion at a short inter-cluster distance (Gao et al. 2022), which leads to the maximal masses over 3\ud835\udc40 . In contrast, the quarks are relativistic and nearly free for QSs, so the EOSs are soft and the maximal masses only reach 2\ud835\udc40 marginally. The observations of themassive pulsars, PSRs J0348+0432 (Antoniadis et al. 2013) and J0740+6620 (Fonseca et al. 2021), at \u223c 2\ud835\udc40 via pulsar timing support the stiff properties of the EOS. More massive ones (e.g., \u2265 2.5\ud835\udc40 ) are expected in our model for future discovery. The GWs from the binary NS inspiral, GW170817, gave constraints on the tidal deformability for the first time (Abbott et al. 2017, 2018, 2019a), which rules out several stiff EOSs (e.g., EOSs MS0 and MS2) and models of SSs with very low surface baryonic densities (say, LX2430 and LX2450) at a 90% credible level (see Fig. 18 in Gao et al. (2022))."

We denote the radial displacement of a fluid element as \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc61) and its harmonic oscillation mode with circular frequency \ud835\udf14 as \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc4b (\ud835\udc5f)\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc61 . To obtain the discrete set of oscillation frequencies of SSs, we adopt the perturbation equations in Kokkotas & Ruoff (2001).

(13)\nAt the center of the star, the boundary condition is 3\ud835\udf010 = \ud835\udf020/P0, where \ud835\udf010 and \ud835\udf020 are the values of \ud835\udf01 and \ud835\udf02 at \ud835\udc5f = 0 respectively (Kokkotas & Ruoff 2001). By setting \ud835\udf020 = 1, we have \ud835\udf010 = 1/3P0, where P0 = \u0393\ud835\udc43(0)\ud835\udc52 (\u039b(0)+3\u03a6(0)) . At the star surface \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc45, the pressure perturbation must vanish, namely \u0394\ud835\udc43 = 0, which provides another boundary condition, \u0393\ud835\udc43\ud835\udf01 \u2032 = 0. Equations (12) and (13) with the above two boundary conditions form a two-point boundary value problem of the Sturm-Liouville type with eigenvalues \ud835\udf1420 < \ud835\udf1421 < \ud835\udf14 2 2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983), where \ud835\udf140 is the eigenfrequency of the \ud835\udc53 -mode. If \ud835\udf1420 > 0, all the eigenfrequencies of the oscillation modes are real, which indicates that the equilibrium stellar model is dynamically stable (Chandrasekhar 1964a,b; Misner et al. 1973). The period of the \ud835\udc53 -mode is given by \ud835\udf0f0 = 1/\ud835\udf080 = 2\ud835\udf0b/\ud835\udf140, where \ud835\udf080 is the ordinary or temporal frequency. Inversely, \ud835\udf1420 < 0 corresponds to an exponentially growing unstable radial oscillation. For adiabatic oscillations, the adiabatic index governing the perturbations is defined by (Kokkotas & Ruoff 2001)\n\u0393 = \ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc43 d\ud835\udc43 d\ud835\udf0c , (14)\nwhich is equal to the adiabatic index governing the equilibrium pressure-energy density relation. The relation between the adiabatic index \u0393 and the mass-energy density \ud835\udf0c is shown in Fig. 3. We note that the adiabatic indices for QSs and SSs are qualitatively different from that of NSs at low density. Moreover, SSs generally have a larger adiabatic index than NSs and QSs, indicating that the EOSs of SSs are stiffer (Gao et al. 2022). In Fig. 4, we present the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency \ud835\udf080 and the frequencies of the first two excited modes, \ud835\udf081 and \ud835\udf082, for SLy4, AP4, and theMIT bag model. Our results for NSs reproduce the results of Kokkotas & Ruoff (2001). We observe that \ud835\udc53 -mode becomes unstable (i.e., \ud835\udf1420 becoming negative) for central densities above 2.83 \u00d7 1015g cm\u22123, 2.70 \u00d7 1015g cm\u22123, and 2.05 \u00d7 1015g cm\u22123 for three EOSs. The instability point corresponds to maximal masses 2.04\ud835\udc40 , 2.21\ud835\udc40 , and 1.96\ud835\udc40 for SLy4, AP4, and the MIT bag model respectively. It is worth noting that the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency of the MIT bag model behaves very different from that of NSs at low central density, rooting in the self-bound and gravity-bound nature ofQSs andNSs respectively. To further explore the results for QSs, SSs, and NSs, we note that with a low central density, the star can be approximated as a homogeneous nonrelativistic star (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983), so that the angular frequency \ud835\udf140 of the \ud835\udc53 -mode reads \ud835\udf1420 = 4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0c(4\u0393 \u2212\n3)/3. Using the relations between the density and the adiabatic index shown in Fig. 3, we do expect the frequency \ud835\udf140 to diverge as the density approaches a minimal value for QSs and SSs. For NSs, the adiabatic index does not change significantly as the density decreases. Therefore for NSs, \ud835\udf140 tends to zero mildly when the central density of the star is sufficiently low. Indeed, these points are confirmed in Fig. 4. In Fig. 5, we show the ordinary frequency \ud835\udf080 of the \ud835\udc53 -mode versus the mass of the stars for SSs and one EOS of QSs. The curves of SSs have the same trend as that of QSs, with \ud835\udf080 going to zero at their maximal masses. However, \ud835\udf080 for SSs is larger than that of QSs for a given mass, which arises from the fact that SSs\u2019 EOSs are much stiffer than that of QSs.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20138 (2022)"

It can be obtained by examining the behavior of\ud835\udc4a and\ud835\udc49 in the vicinity of \ud835\udc5f = 0. At the surface of the star, the perturbed pressure must vanish, which provides\n\ud835\udf142\ud835\udc52\u039b(\ud835\udc45)\u22122\u03a6(\ud835\udc45)\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc45) + 1 \ud835\udc452 d\u03a6 d\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5f=\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc45) = 0 . (19)\nIn full general relativity, each QNM is characterized by a complex eigenfrequency \ud835\udf14 = \ud835\udf14r + i\ud835\udf14i (Thorne & Campolattaro 1967). The real part \ud835\udf14r corresponds to the mode frequency, and the imaginary part \ud835\udf14i gives the damping time \ud835\udf0f \u2261 1/\ud835\udf14i due to GW emission. However, in the Cowling approximation, we obtain normal modes of oscillation and there is no emission of GWs. For a non-rotating stellar model, the Cowling approximation leads to a relative error \u223c 10%\u201330% for the \ud835\udc53 -mode (Chirenti et al. 2015; Sotani & Dohi 2022). For higher modes, the relative error is smaller (Yoshida & Kojima 1997)."

The frequency \ud835\udf080 versus mass \ud835\udc40 for NSs and QSs is shown in the top panel of Fig. 6. By increasing the mass of the star, the frequency \ud835\udf080 increases significantly for NSs, while it does not change much for QSs. This can be understood by noticing that QSs are self-bound by strong interaction and the density in the interior of the star does not change too much as the mass increases. This is in contrast to NSs which are gravitationally bound. From the figure, we can see that the values of \ud835\udf080 at the maximal masses of NSs and QSs are 2.907 kHz, 2.823 kHz, 2.562 kHz, and 2.597 kHz for SLy4, AP4, SQM3, and the MIT bag model with B = 60MeV fm\u22123 respectively. Additionally, the frequency \ud835\udf080 versus mass \ud835\udc40 for SSs is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6. We find that the curves of SSs are similar to those of QSs only that the frequency \ud835\udf080 for SSs extends a much wider range. The values of \ud835\udf080 at the maximal masses of SSs are 6.676 kHz, 6.832 kHz, 7.977 kHz, and 8.684 kHz for the EOSs of SSs with different values of \ud835\udc5bs and \ud835\udf16 that we use in the figure. Compared with QSs and NSs, these values are much larger, and it could be an indicator to distinguish EOSs via GW observations. We show in Fig. 7 the relation between the frequency \ud835\udf080 and the compactness of the stars. It might be useful to note that the values of the maximal compactness, \ud835\udc36max, are 0.21, 0.23, 0.19, and 0.19 for SLy4, AP4, SQM3, and the MIT bag model with B = 60MeV fm\u22123, respectively. In contrast, the value of \ud835\udc36max for SSs with different values of \ud835\udc5bs and \ud835\udf16 is about the same, \ud835\udc36max ' 0.27. This maximal value of the compactness represents the limit of how stiff EOSs of SSs can be due to the repulsive hardcore and the nonrelativistic nature of strangeons."

Motivated by possible observations of the moment of inertia \ud835\udc3c of NSs, Lau et al. (2010) used the moment of inertia to replace the compactness and discovered EOS-independent relations in QNMs of NSs and QSs. Similar results were shown inChirenti et al. (2015). These relations can be used to infer the stellar parameters\u2014mass, radius, and possibly the EOS\u2014from QNM data with future GW detectors. Using the Cowling approximation, Sotani et al. (2011) calculated nonradial oscillations of NSs with hadron-quark mixed phase transition, and discovered an approximate formula. Inspired by the universal relation between the \ud835\udc53 -mode and the compactness \ud835\udc36 (Sotani et al. 2011), we show the scaled frequency of the \ud835\udc53 -mode versus the compactness \ud835\udc36 for NSs, QSs, and SSs in Fig. 8. In particular, as shown by the solid lines in the figure, the universal relation for NSs can be represented by the following empirical formula,\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udf080 = \ud835\udc4eI + \ud835\udc4fI (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 ) + \ud835\udc50I (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 )2 + \ud835\udc51I (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 )3 , (20)\nwith \ud835\udc4eI = \u22120.012, \ud835\udc4fI = 19.48, \ud835\udc50I = 71.3, and \ud835\udc51I = \u2212125, while for SSs, we found a new universal relation,\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udf080 = \ud835\udc4eII + \ud835\udc4fII (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 ) + \ud835\udc50II (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 )2 + \ud835\udc51II (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 )3 + \ud835\udc52II (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 )4 + \ud835\udc58II (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc45 )5 ,\n(21)\nwith \ud835\udc4eII = \u22122.795, \ud835\udc4fII = 1.941 \u00d7 102, \ud835\udc50II = \u22123.834 \u00d7 103, \ud835\udc51II = 3.789 \u00d7 104, \ud835\udc52II = \u22121.601 \u00d7 105, and \ud835\udc58II = 2.531 \u00d7 105. We can observe that the behavior of the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequencies for the SSs is very different from the NSs and QSs, especially when the compactness is larger than\u223c 0.15, where the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency from SSs is much larger than that of QSs and NSs. It can be an important \u201csmoking gun\u201d signal for SSs. For tidally deformed relativistic stars, the quadrupole tidal deformability gives important information about the stellar structure. To characterize the deformation of the star, one usually defines the tidal deformability via \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 \u2261 \u2212\ud835\udf06E\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 , where E\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 is the external tidal field and \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 is the induced traceless quadrupole moment tensor of stars (Hinderer 2008; Hinderer et al. 2010). The parameter \ud835\udf06 is related to the \ud835\udc59 = 2 Love number \ud835\udc582 via \ud835\udc582 = 3\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc45\u22125/2. Besides, the dimensionless tidal deformability \u039b, defined as \u039b = 2\ud835\udc582\ud835\udc36\u22125/3, is also commonly used. We note that the tidal deformability is proportional to the fifth power of the radius \ud835\udc45. Therefore, constraining or measuring tidal deformability can provide important information on the EOS (Abbott et al. 2018, 2019a), as well as test gravity theories (Hu et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2022). The influence of tidal on the phase of GW in the inspiral stage is predominantly dependent on the Love number \ud835\udc582, and the effect enters at the fifth PN order (Flanagan & Hinderer 2008). In Fig. 9, we display the relation between the frequency of the \ud835\udc53 - mode and the dimensionless tidal deformability,\u039b, for NSs, QSs, and SSs. It is seen that the frequency decreases with \u039b. It is understood that themore compact the star becomes the harder it can be deformed. For SSs, as the potential depth \ud835\udf16 increases and the surface baryonic density \ud835\udc5bs decreases, the EOS becomes stiffer, which leads to larger tidal deformability and \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency. For binary NSs of masses \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4f , the dimensionless tidal coupling constant is defined as (Bernuzzi et al. 2014, 2015a,b),\n\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc612 = 2\n[ \ud835\udc5e ( \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\n)5 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e2 + 1 \ud835\udc5e ( \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4f\n)5 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4f2 ] , (22)\nwhere \ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4f/\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e \u2264 1, \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e/(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4f), and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc562 (\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f) are the compactness and the quadrupole Love number of\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20138 (2022)\neach star. Ifwe consider a binary systemwith non-rotating equal-mass configuration, the dimensionless tidal coupling constant is given by \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc612 = \ud835\udc582/8\ud835\udc36\n5 = 3\u039b/16. Inspired by the universal relation between the dimensionless tidal coupling constant and the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency (Chakravarti & Andersson 2020), the relation between \ud835\udc40\ud835\udf080 and \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc612 for NSs, QSs, and SSs are shown in Fig. 10. For NSs and QSs, we find the scaled frequency of the \ud835\udc53 -mode approximately satisfies the following relation,\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udf080 = 0.184(\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc612) \u22120.016 \u2212 0.154 . (23)\nFor SSs, the universal relation is\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udf080 = 0.071(\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc612) \u22120.266 .

            "text": "In this paper, we use the Lennard-Jones model to describe the EOS of SSs with two parameters, the number density at the surface of the star \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 and the potential depth \ud835\udf16 . Compared to the MIT bag model of QSs, the EOS of SSs is much stiff due to the nonrelativistic nature of the particles and the compressed repulsive hardcore at a small intercluster distance. Following earlier work (Lai & Xu 2009; Gao et al. 2022), we calculate the mass and radius relation for SSs for different values of \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udf16 , and find that the maximal mass of SSs is higher than that of NSs and QSs. This serves as background solutions for perturbation studies of various oscillation modes. To study radial oscillations of SSs, for the first timewe calculate the frequency of the radial modes for SSs with different combinations of \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udf16 . The results are compared with that of NSs and QSs. We discover that radial oscillations of SSs are similar to those of QSs but behave very differently from those of NSs, especially for stars with low central energy densities or small masses. For QSs and SSs, the frequencies of radial oscillations tend to infinity when the central energy density approaches the minimal value \ud835\udf0cmin, which corresponds to the pressure being zero. This can be understood by approximating the stars in the nonrelativistic regime and noticing that the adiabatic index \u0393 for SSs and QSs goes to infinity as the density decreases to its minimal value. For nonradial oscillations of SSs, we calculate the frequency of\nthe \ud835\udc53 -mode for \ud835\udc59 = 2 component using the Cowling approximation, and obtain the universal relations between the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency and other global parameters of the spherical SSs. As recently proposed in Gao et al. (2022), where the I-Love-Q universal relations for SSs were studied, the universal relation of the \ud835\udc53 -mode frequency for SSs is also ready to be used for various purposes in GW astrophysics involving compact stars.With application to data in the future, possible constraints can be set on the parameter space of the Lennard-Jones model, namely the \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60-\ud835\udf16 plane, using GW observations of the QNMs from compact stars. There can be several interesting extensions of our work. First, our study of nonradial oscillations uses the Cowling approximation (Cowling 1941), which considers only the fluid perturbation. In principle, one should also allow the spacetime metric to be perturbed, and thus one can obtain QNMs instead of normal modes. Next, we would like to further investigate how dynamical tides affect the frequency of the \ud835\udc53 -mode in compact binary systems. NSs have certain spins and the rotation rate may reach extreme values, especially for nascent or remnant objects following a binary merger. From the perspective of detecting oscillation modes with GWs, the most relevant scenarios are likely to involve rapidly rotating NSs. An important step in this direction has been carried out using perturbation theory in general relativity with the Cowling approximation (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2010; Gaertig & Kokkotas 2011; Doneva et al. 2013). In the next step, we can study the oscillationmodes of rapidly rotating SSs in the Cowling approximation based on existing work. Recently, Kr\u00fcger & Kokkotas (2020b,a) managed to calculate the oscillations and instabilities of relativistic stars using perturbation theory without the Cowling approximation. The oscillation spectrum, universal relations involving \ud835\udc53 -mode, and the critical values for the onset of the secular Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability are studied in great detail. Further, Manoharan et al. (2021) investigated universal relations for binary NS mergers with long-lived remnants. By considering the oscillations of the rapidly rotating merger remnant, they proposed an approach to relate the pre-merger tidal deformability to the effective compactness of the post-merger remnant. Those studies are important to probe the EOS of NSs with GW asteroseismology. Therefore, to study the oscillations of rapidly rotating SSs without the Cowling approximation is an important goal worth pursuing."
