    "abstractText": "Schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune system may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, with changes occurring in both the peripheral blood and brain tissue.1\u20133 Multiple recent studies have observed dysregulation of inflammatory markers in the prefrontal cortex4\u20136 and blood of people with schizophrenia,7\u20139 which may converge to (and propagate through) microglia-dependent neuroinflammation in association with other neuropatho logical hallmarks in the brains of people with schizophrenia.10 Most cytokines are synthesized and secreted by astrocytes and microglia in the brain. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is one such brain cytokine.11,12 The expression of TGF-\u03b21 is regulated by neurons in an activity-dependent manner,13 and its receptors are expressed on multiple brain cell types.14 TGF-\u03b21 signalling is critical for a range of biological processes during brain development and regeneration via the regulation of neurotransmission, synaptic remodelling",

Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune system may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, with changes occurring in both the peripheral blood and brain tissue.1\u20133 Multiple recent studies have observed dysregulation of inflammatory markers in the prefrontal cortex4\u20136 and blood of people with schizophrenia,7\u20139 which may converge to (and propagate through) microglia-dependent neuro-\ninflammation in association with other neuropatho logical hallmarks in the brains of people with schizophrenia.10 Most cytokines are synthesized and secreted by astrocytes and microglia in the brain. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is one such brain cytokine.11,12 The expression of TGF-\u03b21 is regulated by neurons in an activity-dependent manner,13 and its receptors are expressed on multiple brain cell types.14 TGF-\u03b21 signalling is critical for a range of biological processes during brain development and regeneration via the regulation of neurotransmission, synaptic remodelling\nCorrespondence to: Y.

Tian, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, li.tian@ut.ee\nSubmitted Jul. 19, 2021; Revised Oct. 4, 2021; Accepted Nov. 23, 2021\nCite as: J Psychiatry Neurosci 2022 March 17;47(2). doi: 10.1503/jpn.210121\nBackground: Evidence indicates that cytokines are associated with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia; however, the underlying brain\u2013 behaviour mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that aberrations in brain structural connectivity mediate the cytokine effect in schizophrenia. Methods: In this study, we recruited patients with first-episode schizophrenia (n = 75, average illness duration 12.3\u00a0months, average medication period 0.6 days) and healthy controls (n = 44) of both sexes. We first conducted whole-blood RNA sequencing to detect differentially expressed genes. We also explored transcriptomic data on the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC) retrieved from the CommonMind Consortium for gene functional clustering; we measured plasma transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; we acquired high-resolution T1-weighted MRI data on cortical thickness MRI; and we assessed cognitive function using the validated Chinese version of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery. We compared these parameters in patients with schizophrenia and controls, and analyzed their associations. Results: Patients with schizophrenia had higher TGF-\u03b21 at both the mRNA level (log2 fold change = 0.24; adjusted p = 0.026) and the protein level (12.85 \u00b1 6.01 \u00b5g/mL v. 8.46 \u00b1 5.15 \u00b5g/mL, adjusted p < 0.001) compared to controls. Genes coexpressed with TGFB1 in the dlPFC were less abundant in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. In patients with schizophrenia, TGF-\u03b21 protein levels were inversely correlated with cortical thickness, especially of the lateral occipital cortex (r = \u20130.47, adjusted p = 0.001), and with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery visual learning and memory domain (r = \u20130.50, adjusted p < 0.001). We found a complete mediation effect of the thickness of the lateral occipital cortex on the negative relationship between TGF-\u03b21 and visual cognition (p < 0.05). Limitations: We did not explore the effect of other blood cytokines on neurocognitive performance and cortical thickness. Participants from the CommonMind Consortium did not all have firstepisode schizophrenia and they were not all antipsychotic-naive, so we could not exclude an effect of antipsychotics on TGF-\u03b21 signalling in the dlPFC. The sample size and cross-sectional design of our study were additional limitations. Conclusion: These findings highlighted an association between upregulated blood levels of TGF-\u03b21 and impairments in brain structure and function in schizophrenia.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2) E87\nand brain connectivity.11,15\u201318 Accumulated evidence suggests that TGF-\u03b21 may also be involved in disease onset and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.11,19 Notably, in a previous genetic study by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, TGF-\u03b2 signalling was included among the enriched biological pathways for schizophrenia.20\nAlthough immune genes including TGFB1 have been implicated in schizophrenia, how they cause cerebral abnormalities and behavioural deficits in schizophrenia remains elusive.21,22 We have recently observed that immune-related factors negatively affect cognition in association with brain structural deficits in patients with first-episode23\u201325 and treatment-resistant schizophrenia.26 In the present study, we hypothesized that changes in blood immune genes may be linked to alterations in cerebral cortical structures (such as cortical thinning) and their connectivity, which in turn may lead to cognitive decline in schizophrenia. We used RNA sequencing to examine the blood transcriptomes of patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls, and to identify differentially expressed genes from which TGF-\u03b21 family members were surfaced during pathway analysis (Appendix 1, Tables S1 and S2, available at www. jpn.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/jpn.210121/tab-related-content). We further explored cortical transcriptomic data from the CommonMind Consortium to identify biological pathways associated with TGF-\u03b21 the brains of people with schizophrenia. Moreover, we measured participants\u2019 plasma TGF-\u03b21 and cerebral cortical thickness and evaluated the relationships between TGF-\u03b21, cognition and cerebral cortical thickness."

            "text": "Participants\u2019 demographic and clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. Patients and controls were not statistically different in terms of age, sex or years of education, but patients had a lower mean body mass index than controls (20.90 \u00b1 2.91 kg/m2 v. 23.35 \u00b1 3.67 kg/m2; p = 0.001). We used these variables as covariates in subsequent analyses. Whole blood cell counts did not differ between patients and controls (data not shown).\nThe MCCB total and domain index scores are summarized in Table 2. Compared with controls, patients with schizophrenia had worse cognitive performance on all MCCB indices (all adjusted p < 0.001).\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2) E89\nTGFB1 mRNA higher in the whole blood of patients than controls\nA total of 1332 differentially expressed genes were detected by the RNA sequencing of blood samples from patients with schizophrenia and controls; of those, 567 were downregulated and 755 were upregulated (adjusted p < 0.05; Figure 1A and Appendix 1, Table S1). Panther pathway analysis of molecular function showed that these differentially expressed genes mainly regulated molecular binding (32.50% hit) and catalytic activity (22.50% hit; Figure 1B). The top 3 rankings for Panther biological process were cellular process (GO:0009987, 53.8% hit), metabolic process (GO:0008152, 34.3% hit) and biological regulation (GO:0065007, 33.8% hit). Gene clusters enriched in the GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses done in DAVID are listed in Appendix 1, Table S2. Notably, functional clustering analysis of these differentially expressed genes by DAVID molecular function highlighted the top-ranking genes involved in TGF-\u03b2 receptor binding (Appendix 1, Table S2). Of these, TGFB1 was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in con-\ntrols (log2FC = 0.24, adjusted p = 0.026), and its receptors TGFBR1 (log2FC= \u22120.24, adjusted p = 0.019) and TGFBR3 (log2FC = \u22120.45, adjusted p = 0.004) were both lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls (Figure 1C and Appendix 1, Table S3 and S4).\nTGFB1-coexpressed genes in the dlPFC involved in different biological pathways in patients than controls\nTo better understand the function of TGF-\u03b21 in the human brain, we further explored RNA sequencing data from the dlPFC of deceased people with schizophrenia (n = 258) and control participants (n = 279) provided by the CommonMind Consortium.30 We retrieved a weighted gene coexpression network analysis list containing TGFB1-coexpressed genes and conducted gene functional clustering and protein\u2013protein interaction analyses to compare the characteristics of TGF-\u03b21associated gene networks between patients with schizophrenia and controls. The analyses showed that TGFB1 was coexpressed with a different and smaller number of genes in patients with schizophrenia than in controls (Appendix 2, Table S5), constituting a less prominent interaction network\nTable 2: MCCB scores and TGF-\u03b21 levels\nCharacteristic Patients with schizophrenia* Healthy controls* t or \u03c72 p value\nMCCB domain score\nSpeed of processing 42.86 \u00b1 13.06 59.00 \u00b1 6.93 \u20138.36 <\u00a00.001\nAttention/vigilance 39.19 \u00b1 13.33 58.05 \u00b1 11.58 \u20137.33 <\u00a00.001\nWorking memory 46.65 \u00b1 10.94 58.62 \u00b1 5.48 \u20137.50 <\u00a00.001\nVerbal learning and memory 46.74 \u00b1 14.06 55.76 \u00b1 7.36 \u20134.36 <\u00a00.001\nVisual learning and memory 44.20 \u00b1 12.47 56.21 \u00b1 6.17 \u20136.66 <\u00a00.001\nReasoning and problem solving 46.14 \u00b1 12.92 57.84 \u00b1 5.04 \u20136.66 <\u00a00.001\nSocial cognition 44.55 \u00b1 13.44 54.47 \u00b1 9.73 \u20134.01 <\u00a00.001\nComposite score 44.83 \u00b1 9.86 59.83 \u00b1 4.40 \u201310.52 <\u00a00.001\nTGF-\u03b21, \u00b5g/mL 12.85 \u00b1 6.01 8.46 \u00b1 5.15 3.94 <\u00a00.001\nMCCB = MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery; TGF-\u03b21 = transforming growth factor-\u03b21. *Data are mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nTable 1: Demographic characteristics of patients with early-stage schizophrenia and healthy controls\nCharacteristic Patients with schizophrenia (n = 75)* Healthy controls (n = 44)* t or \u03c72 p value\nSex, M/F 34/41 24/20 1.20 0.27\nAge, yr 28.61 \u00b1 6.90 30.07 \u00b1 7.49 \u20131.07 0.29\nEducation, yr 13.01 \u00b1 3.77 14.28 \u00b1 2.18 \u20132.02 0.05\nBMI, kg/m2 20.90 \u00b1 2.91 23.35 \u00b1 3.67 \u20133.92 0.001\nIllness duration, mo 12.25 \u00b1 17.85 NA NA NA\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale\nPositive symptom score 21.79 \u00b1 4.91 NA NA NA\nNegative symptom score 17.56 \u00b1 6.00 NA NA NA\nGeneral psychopathological symptom score\n36.92 \u00b1 6.98 NA NA NA\nTotal score 76.26 \u00b1 12.81 NA NA NA\nNA = not applicable. *Data are mean \u00b1 standard deviation unless otherwise indicated.\nE90 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2)\n(Figure 2). These TGF-\u03b21-associated genes were also enriched in different biological pathways, showing that the topranked GOs in the control group were involved in the regulation of receptor signalling and developmental process (Appendix 1, Tables S6 and S8), but the top-ranked GO in patients with schizophrenia was for extracellular matrix organization (Appendix 1, Tables S7 and S8).\nTGF-\u03b21 plasma levels higher in patients versus controls\nAs shown in Table 2, TGF-\u03b21 levels were significantly upregulated in the plasma of patients with schizophrenia relative to controls (12.85 \u00b1 6.01 \u00b5g/mL v. 8.46 \u00b1 5.15 \u00b5g/mL; p < 0.001). We found no significant difference in TGF-\u03b21 levels between women and men with schizophrenia. To evaluate the potential effect of antipsychotic medication on TGF-\u03b21 levels, we analyzed the regression between chlorpromazine dosages and TGF-\u03b21 levels and found no significant correlation. We also compared TGF-\u03b21 levels between drug-naive and medicated patients, as well as between patients with fewer than 3 days of\nantipsychotic medication and those with a longer period of treatment, but we found no group differences in these separate analyses (data not shown).\nWe also explored dlPFC transcriptomic data from the CommonMind Consortium,30 but brain mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21 did not differ between the schizophrenia and control groups this cohort (adjusted p > 0.05; Appendix 1, Figure S1).\nReduced thickness of the lateral occipital cortex and positive association with visual cognition in schizophrenia\nWe next compared cerebral cortical structures in 34 brain regions measured by MRI, including the visual cortex and associated areas (Brodmann areas 17 to 19) of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. As summarized in Table 3 and Figure 3A, multiple cortical regions showed significantly reduced thickness in patients with schizophrenia compared with controls. The reduction was most striking in the mean thickness of the lateral occipital cortex (LOC; adjusted p < 0.001, Table 3 and Figure 3B). Both the\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2) E91\nE92 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2)\nleft and right LOC were thinner in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls (Appendix 1, Table S9). Other cortical regions related to visual cognition and working memory, such as the inferior parietal cortex and the supramarginal gyrus, were also decreased in patients versus controls (Table 3 and Appendix 1, Table S9). However, we found no change in cortical thickness of the dlPFC (adjusted p > 0.05).\nWe also studied the relationship between visual cognition and brain cortical structures and found that it was positively correlated with multiple cortical regions in patients with schizophrenia, but not in healthy controls (Figure 3C). Specifically, the mean thickness of the LOC (r = 0.42, adjusted p = 0.001; Figure 3D), as well as the thickness of the left LOC (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.39, unadjusted p = 0.007; Figure 3E) and the right LOC (r = 0.42, unadjusted p = 0.003; Figure 3F) were most significantly related to visual learning and memory scores in patients with schizophrenia. These relationships were nonsignificant in healthy controls.\nScores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were not significantly correlated with MCCB scores, TGF-\u03b21 levels or LOC thickness in patients with schizophrenia.\nNegative association between TGF-\u03b21 and visual cognition in schizophrenia\nWe further observed associations between plasma TGF-\u03b21 levels and MCCB total score and subscores. TGF-\u03b21 plasma levels were negatively associated with MCCB total scores (r = \u22120.48, adjusted p = 0.001) in the schizophrenia group alone and in the schizophrenia and healthy control groups combined (r = \u22120.40, adjusted p < 0.001). After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the most impressive correlations were for visual learning and memory (r = \u22120.50, adjusted p < 0.001; Figure 4A) and for social cognition (r = \u22120.41, adjusted p = 0.004) in patients with schizophrenia (Appendix 1, Figure S2). These correlations remained significant when we evaluated the subgroup of patients with fewer than 3\u00a0 days of antipsychotic treatment for visual learning and memory (r = \u22120.45, adjusted p = 0.002, other data not shown). Other measurements of cognition, including speed of processing, attention and vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, reasoning and problem solving were nonsignificant in patients with schizophrenia. In the control group, TGF-\u03b21 levels were not correlated with MCCB total or subscale scores.\nNegative association between TGF-\u03b21 and LOC thickness in schizophrenia\nWhen we explored the associations between plasma TGF-\u03b21 levels and brain cortical structures, we found multiple negative associations in patients with schizophrenia, but healthy controls showed only trends of positive correlations in most cases (Figure 4B). In particular, TGF-\u03b21 levels showed the strongest negative correlations with the mean thickness of the LOC (r = \u22120.47, adjusted p = 0.001; Figure 4C), as well as the thickness of the left LOC (r = \u22120.35, unadjusted p < 0.01; Figure 4D) and the right LOC (r\u00a0 = \u22120.49, adjusted p < 0.001; Figure 4E). These findings remained significant when we analyzed a subgroup of patients with fewer than 3 days of antipsychotic treatment (r = \u22120.45, adjusted p = 0.002; r = \u22120.34, adjusted p = 0.02; r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.46, adjusted p = 0.001).\nEffect of TGF-\u03b21 on visual cognition mediated via LOC thickness\nWe assessed whether the LOC mediated the association between TGF-\u03b21 and MCCB visual cognition score. The negative effect of TGF-\u03b21 on the visual learning and memory score was fully mediated by mean LOC thickness in patients with schizophrenia (path AB: \u03b2 = \u22120.29 [95% confidence interval \u22120.74 to \u22120.06], p < 0.05; Figure 5). In healthy controls, none of the mediation analyses showed significance."

            "text": "The present study showed the following main findings for patients with first-episode schizophrenia: increases in blood TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels and plasma TGF-\u03b21 protein levels; decreases in the thicknesses of multiple cortical regions, particularly the LOC, and reduced neurocognitive performance; negative association between plasma TGF-\u03b21 levels and both visual cognition and LOC thickness, as well as a positive association between LOC thickness and visual cognition; a full mediation effect of the LOC on the relationship between TGF-\u03b21 and visual cognition.\nCortical thinning or grey matter loss in schizophrenia may be caused by multiple mechanisms, including neuronal maldevelopment and neurodegeneration. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the correlations between the thickness of the LOC and other associated cortical regions and TGF-\u03b21 levels in patients with schizophrenia and\nTable 3: Average thickness of the visual cortex and associated cortical areas\nRegion\nThickness, mm*\nt Adjusted p valuePatients with schizophrenia Healthy controls\nLateral occipital cortex 2.20 \u00b1 0.13 2.31 \u00b1 0.11 \u20134.12 <\u00a00.001\nInferior parietal cortex 2.49 \u00b1 0.15 2.62 \u00b1 0.10 \u20134.64 <\u00a00.001\nSupramarginal gyrus 2.57 \u00b1 0.13 2.69 \u00b1 0.11 \u20134.74 <\u00a00.001\n*Data are mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2) E93\nE94 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2)\nhealthy controls. We showed that increased TGF-\u03b21 levels in patients with schizophrenia were associated with significant LOC thinning, leading to worsened performance on a visual learning and memory scale.\nOur finding of higher blood cell mRNA and plasma protein levels of TGF-\u03b21 in patients with schizophrenia was in line with most previous studies.19,35\u201337 A meta-analysis by Miller and colleagues has also confirmed a significant increase in TGF-\u03b21 in the blood during acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, which were normalized with antipsychotic treatment.38 Upregulation of TGF-\u03b21 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also correlated with positive symptoms in drug-free patients.39 However, some other studies have found no change or a reduction in TGF-\u03b21 in the cerebrospinal fluid21 or blood of patients with schizophrenia.22,40,41 The inconsistency in these results is likely influenced by sample\nsize, illness process, antipsychotic medications or a combination of these.\nThe upregulation of blood TGF-\u03b21 may imply a biased immune function in patients with schizophrenia. Interestingly, we observed opposite changes in TGFB1 (upregulation) and its receptors TGFBR1 and TGFBR3 (downregulation) in our blood RNA sequencing data. The cause of such an opposite relationship is intriguing but may reflect a compensational feedback mechanism to balance pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production via TGF-\u03b21-receptor-mediated signalling in target cells. However, we did not observe a broad change in pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines in blood RNA sequencing, except for a minor population (2.3% hit) representing the immune system process (GO_BP:0002376) that involved some chemokine and TNF superfamily members (Appendix 1, Table S1 and S2), the significance of which warrants further investigation.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2) E95\nTGF-\u03b21 levels in the peripheral blood and brain may be aligned, because it has been reported that TGF-\u03b21 can pass the blood\u2013brain barrier via P-glycoprotein efflux transporters expressed on brain capillary endothelial cells,42,43 and TGF-\u03b21 concentrations in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid were parallel with each other.21 Furthermore, studies have shown that TGF-\u03b21 plays a very important role in blood\u2013brain barrier function and angiogenesis. For instance, the formation and maturation of the blood\u2013brain barrier relies on interactions between endothelial cells and astrocytes via TGF-\u03b2\u2013 mediated activation of integrin av\u03b28.44 Given that changes in blood\u2013brain barrier structure and permeability have been identified in psychiatric disorders, allowing peripheral inflammatory effects on the brain,45 this may also explain the influence of peripheral TGF-\u03b21 in schizophrenia.\nIn the brain, aberrant TGF-\u03b21 expression affects the formation of cellular and subcellular structures as well as their remodelling. TGF-\u03b2 is a potent inducer of astrocytes derived from radial glia and is one of the principal factors for microglial development. Astrocytes may sustain a noninflammatory microglial phenotype through TGF-\u03b2, and astrocytic TGF-\u03b2 overdrive pushes microglia to dysfunctional synaptic pruning.11 At the embryonic stage, inactivation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling impairs neuronal development as well.15\u201317\nTo further investigate the underlying mechanisms of TGF-\u03b21 function in the brains of people with schizophrenia, we analyzed TGF-\u03b21 coexpressed genes in postmortem dlPFC samples of people with schizophrenia using the CommonMind Consortium data resource.30 The frontal cortex \u2014 particularly the prefrontal cortex \u2014 is known to orchestrate the hierarchical\nprocessing of visual and spatial working memory, including visual recognition memory and scene-specific memory for objects, as well as the associated emotional memory.46,47 We observed that although TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels in the dlPFC did not differ between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, coexpressed genes that mainly regulate cell surface receptor signalling and developmental processes were compromised in patients with schizophrenia. The schizophreniaspecific biological process was driven instead toward extracellular matrix remodelling, which may be related to changes in neuropil and synaptic remodelling in schizophrenia, as described below. Nevertheless, the overlapping coexpressed genes AXL and CSF1, conserved in both healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia, are inflammatory response regulators, implying that brain developmental or metabolic processes could intercalate with glia-mediated inflammatory processes, and these may all involve TGF-\u03b21. However, the dlPFC gene expression data from the CommonMind Consortium may have been affected by antipsychotic treatment or other medications.\nWe have also provided evidence that peripheral TGF-\u03b21 may negatively affect cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia, particularly visual learning and memory, implying that increased circulating levels of TGF-\u03b21 may affect synaptic connectivity and cognition in the brains of patients with schizophrenia via the aforementioned biological pathways. Indeed, evidence has shown that increased TGF-\u03b21\u2013 modulated glutamate receptor expression in the hippocampus15 and neuronal C1q expression and synaptic pruning in the developing visual system18 promoted radial glia\u2013astrocyte differentiation in the cerebral cortex in mice.48 Mice lacking\nE96 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(2)\nTGF-\u03b2 signalling in dopaminergic neurons were hyperactive and exhibited deficits in reversal learning and memory formation.16,17 However, other studies have revealed that overexpressed TGF-\u03b21 can cause aberrant synaptic function49\u201351 and reduced neurogenesis,48 likely detrimental for cognition. A study also showed that people with schizophrenia who displayed poor verbal fluency and decreased volumes in the Broca area had elevated peripheral cytokine levels, including TGF-\u03b21.52\nThe above evidence indicates plural potencies of TGF-\u03b21 in steering the cognitive impairment that is a core component of the symptomatology of schizophrenia and accounts for related poor functional outcomes. Cytokines, either synthesized locally by brain cells or infiltrated from the blood, affect cognition depending on their type, concentration and spatiotemporal expression patterns.53 On one hand, our findings reinforce the hypothesis of inflammatory influence on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. On the other hand, they reveal the complicated functions of pleiotropic cytokines (in this case anti-inflammatory TGF-\u03b21) in regulating synaptic function and cognition.11\nOur results also suggest that TGF-\u03b21 levels in the peripheral blood may be a useful biomarker for detecting cortical or cognitive impairment in patients with early-stage schizophrenia. We observed a significant decrease in the thickness of the LOC, along with several other related regions, and this decrease had a significant positive association with visual learning and memory scores, indicating that these regions are probably the substrate of deficits in early visual processing. Consistent with this finding, altered structure and function of the occipital cortex has been implicated in schizophrenia by several other imaging studies.54\u201356 For instance, an MRI study55 suggested that patients with schizophrenia had relatively intact grey matter volume in the primary visual area but reduced bilateral grey matter volume in vision-associated areas. Excessive grey matter loss in the occipital lobe, accompanied by severe perceptual impairments after visual stimulus in some patients with schizophrenia, has also been reported.56 Earlier studies of postmortem tissues in the primary visual cortex in schizophrenia found reduced cortical thickness but an abnormally high density of small neurons, implicating reduced neuropils (axonal and dendritic tissues) as a likely cause of cortical thinning.57\u201359 Such reduction in neuropils could be related to a decrease in synaptic density, long thought to be a contributor to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.60 However, another study has suggested decreased thickness in the occipital cortex was less consistent in people with schizophrenia, and that the temporal and frontal cortices were more consistently different.61"

            "text": "There were 4 major limitations in our study that should be acknowledged. First, although TGF-\u03b21 levels were associated with LOC thickness and visual cognition, these observations were only correlational, not causative. Second, we did not explore the effect of other cytokines on neurocognitive performance and cortical thickness. The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia requires better elucidation in\nfuture studies. Third, participants from the CommonMind Consortium did not all have first-episode psychosis, and they were not all antipsychotic-naive; therefore, we cannot exclude the possible effect of antipsychotics on TGF-\u03b21 signalling in the dlPFC data. Finally, the heterogeneity of regionspecific cortical thinning in patients with schizophrenia may have caused wide confidence intervals as a result of our small sample size and decreased the precision of results."
