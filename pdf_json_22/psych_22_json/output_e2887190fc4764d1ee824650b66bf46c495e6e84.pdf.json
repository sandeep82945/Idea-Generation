    "abstractText": "There is a growing interest the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate unsafe spaces, scenarios, and behaviours. Environments that might be difficult, costly, dangerous, or ethically contentious to achieve in real life can be created in virtual environments designed to give participants a convincing experience of \u201cbeing there.\u201d There is little consensus in the academic community about the impact of simulating risky content in virtual reality, and a scarcity of evidence to support the various hypotheses which range from VR being a safe place to rehearse challenging scenarios to calls for such content creation to be halted for fear of irreversible harm to users. Perspectives split along disciplinary lines, with competing ideas emerging from cultural studies and games studies, from psychology and neuroscience, and with industry reports championing the efficacy of these tools for information retention, time efficiency and cost, with little equivalence in information available regarding impact on the wellbeing of participants. In this study we use thematic analysis and close reading language analysis to investigate the way in which participants in a VR training scenario respond to, encode and relay their own experiences. We find that participants overall demonstrate high levels of \u201cperceptual proximity\u201d to the experience, recounting it as something that happened to them directly and personally. We discuss the impact of particular affordances of VR, as well as a participant\u2019s prior experience on the impact of high-stress simulations. Finally, we consider the ethical mandate for training providers to mitigate the risk of traumatizing or re-traumatizing participants when creating high-risk virtual scenarios.",

Environments that might be difficult, costly, dangerous, or ethically contentious to achieve in real life can be created in virtual environments designed to give participants a convincing experience of \u201cbeing there.\u201d There is little consensus in the academic community about the impact of simulating risky content in virtual reality, and a scarcity of evidence to support the various hypotheses which range from VR being a safe place to rehearse challenging scenarios to calls for such content creation to be halted for fear of irreversible harm to users. Perspectives split along disciplinary lines, with competing ideas emerging from cultural studies and games studies, from psychology and neuroscience, and with industry reports championing the efficacy of these tools for information retention, time efficiency and cost, with little equivalence in information available regarding impact on the wellbeing of participants. In this study we use thematic analysis and close reading language analysis to investigate the way in which participants in a VR training scenario respond to, encode and relay their own experiences. We find that participants overall demonstrate high levels of \u201cperceptual proximity\u201d to the experience, recounting it as something that happened to them directly and personally. We discuss the impact of particular affordances of VR, as well as a participant\u2019s prior experience on the impact of high-stress simulations. Finally, we consider the ethical mandate for training providers to mitigate the risk of traumatizing or re-traumatizing participants when creating high-risk virtual scenarios.\nKEYWORDS\nvirtual reality, risk, simulation, training, journalism, presence, ethics\nIntroduction\nIndustry partnership\nOur industry partners in this study, Head Set are an immersive learning company, founded by journalists Aela Callan and Kate Parkinson who have a combined experience of over 30 years covering war, natural disasters and high risk assignments around the world.

Lack of training on gender-based violence as well as other gender- and culture-related topics are major gaps, as is gender equity among trainers. Trauma-awareness and digital security trainings also remain significantly limited.\u201d (Slaughter et al., 2017).\nIn response, Head Set have developed a half-day learning module entitled \u201cStress Management and Civil Unrest\u201d These sessions are designed to support journalists who might be expected to report from high risk scenarios such as protest, riot and revolution. Each session includes a 20-min virtual reality experience and a range of wraparound workshop activities, group discussion and one-to-one support sessions.\nOur researchers conducted a series of interviews with participants immediately after they had completed Head Set\u2019s \u201cStress Management and Civil Unrest\u201d sessions.\nThe virtual reality experience is of a scenario in which the participant and a virtual colleague are deployed to report on a protest. Protesters have gathered in a Central London park in the United Kingdom to signal their opposition to coronavirus restrictions. The reporters are singled out and accused of\nbeing proponents of \u201cfake news\u201d and the crowd becomes hostile. The experience unfolds to include a series of high risk and violent encounters involving the participant, police and protesters. It has been designed to \u201cdial up the danger,\u201d evoking a visceral \u201cfight, flight or freeze\u201d impulse which is later discussed and examined within the wider training session.\nThe visual style is semi-abstract, using high-contrast colours and with figures and environmental features rendered as meshlike structures against a black background (see Figures 1, 2). Use of scale, movement, and sound are hyper-realistic, using high quality motion capture and spatial audio techniques to enhance the perceived authenticity of the scene.\nThe experience is intended to heighten participant\u2019s sense of presence, danger and powerlessness, and provides a common point of reference that is used to teach strategies to protect physical and emotional safety in future deployments.\nAs this use case is still novel, we chose to take an inductive approach to the research, allowing the process of enquiry to inform the outcomes. However, our overarching research questions, developed with our industry partners were as following:\nRQ1: How do participants experience and communicate their own sense of presence, safety and agency in relation to this particular virtual reality experience?\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org02\nRQ2: What are the ethical dimensions and questions that should be considered when producing virtual reality simulations of unsafe environments?"

            "text": "Virtual reality has long been considered an attractive proposition for the purposes of simulation and training. In 2005, before the latest wave of head mounted displays emerged, Sanchez-Vives and Slater theorised about the potential of Virtual Environments (VEs):\n\u201cIt allows the creation of sensory environments that can be replicated almost identically and that are under the full control of the experimenter, including the creation of scenarios and conditions that are too expensive or dangerous, or even impossible to create in physical reality\u201d (Sanchez-Vives and Slater, 2005).\nSince then, virtual reality simulation for training has become big business, moving out of research labs and firmly into the private sector with PwC estimating the value to the UK economy alone at $294.2 billion by 2030 (PwC, 2019) The same report suggests that:\n\u201cThe use of VR and AR in training boosts engagement and knowledge retention and enables organisations to enforce consistent, measurable standards at scale. The technology also provides a way to train employees where it is not always\npractical\u2014or safe\u2014to do so in the real world. For example, to simulate emergency situations or asset maintenance in dangerous environments.\u201d (PwC, 2019).\nCurrent use cases for virtual reality as a site of training cover a broad spectrum. These include procedural training using specific instruments or techniques e.g., decontamination procedures for healthcare workers (Make Real, 2021), or flight simulations allowing pilot to rehearse risky manoeuvres (EASA, 2021). VR can also be used to simulate disaster scenarios, enabling emergency response training such in areas such as fire safety (Rossler, Sankaranarayanan and Duvall, 2019).\nVirtual reality simulation is also increasingly being used for more \u201csoft skills\u201d training such as leadership (Mursion, 2020), customer service (Bellos, 2021) as well as in anti-bias and EDI training (Bodyswaps, 2022).\nIn \u201cReality Check: How Immersive Technologies can Transform your Business\u201d Dalton (also the author of the PwC report) suggests that \u201cVR gives us the best of all worlds: the ability to create a believable, engaging and repeatable emergency but without the associated danger of the real thing\u201d (Dalton, 2021).\nIn the past 20 + years there has been extensive research into virtual reality as a site of learning that can be utilised in both educational and professional contexts. Some suggest that the more immersive something is, the more information trainees retain (Alhalabi, 2016; Krokos, Plaisant and Varshney, 2019) although others suggest the reverse (Ochs and Sonderegger, 2022). Another study suggested that the emotion elicited by\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org03\nthe experience had the greatest impact on memory, whereas the impact of presence on memory was weak (Cadet and Chainay, 2020). Dalton cautions against ascribing umbrella value judgements to a medium when there is so much potential for variation in content design:\n\u201cLike all tools, VR is only as effective as the person that wields it. Poorly designed experiences or ineffective applications of the technology can be damaging to a learning objective. Knowing when to adopt immersive learning is as valuable as knowing when not to.\u201d (Dalton, 2021).\nSuffice to say, perspectives and results regarding the efficacy of VR training vary significantly, however a recent meta-analysis concluded that training delivered using a virtual reality headset \u201ccan improve both knowledge and skill development, and maintain the learning effect over time.\u201d (Wu et al., 2020). Makransky and Peterson (2021) also attempt to synthesise a large corpus of study in order to identify the contributing factors that can combine to maximise the apparent benefits of using virtual reality for training and education. They propose that \u201c(h) eightened levels of situational interest, intrinsic motivation, selfefficacy, embodiment, and self-regulation and lower levels of cognitive load can have positive effects on learning outcomes\u201d (Makransky and Petersen, 2021).\nAs is so often the case in fast-moving industrial practices, some of the most influential data regarding the efficacy of immersive training practices has not come from peer reviewed study, but from influential corporate players who have published results of their own studies. A 2020 report by management consultancy firm, PwC entitled \u201cThe Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Soft Skills Training in the Enterprise\u201d (PwC, 2020) is routinely quoted by training providers as \u201cevidence\u201d of the effectiveness of immersive training provision at a corporate level. The PwC report suggests that relative to in-person or online counterparts, those training in virtual reality (v-learners) are:\n- \u201cUp to 275%\u201d more confident in what they have learned; - 4x more focused during learning; - Able to complete training 4x faster; - 3.75x more emotionally connected to learning; - And that \u201cv-learning\u201d is more cost effective at scale than\nother forms of training. (PwC, 2020).\nPwC do not publish their source data or methods therefore it is difficult to comment on the accuracy of their findings, however the influence of such firms on global investment and public policy is well established (Kipping, 2003; Morgan et al., 2019). Such strong advocacy is likely to have an impact on market confidence and the subsequent growth of the sector.\nWhilst there has been a significant amount of research into virtual reality training, the emphasis thus far has been on the most commercially salient factors such as information retention, cost and scalability. Less is currently known about the experience of individual participants. In this paper we aim to offer a more\nparticipant-centred lens through which to consider ethics and impact of this medium."

Rather than observing at a distance from a rectangular screen as with film, tv, games and mobile experiences, the user now finds themselves at the centre of an unfolding circumstance, a circumstance that occurs all around them, and that they are now a part of. This sensation is often referred to as \u201cpresence\u201d \u201cthat peculiar sense of \u201cbeing there\u201d unique to virtual reality\u201d (Bailenson, 2018).\nUnlike it is more quantifiable cousin, \u201cimmersion\u201d (SanchezVives and Slater, 2005), a participant\u2019s subjective experience of presence can be difficult to pin down. In recent years, psychologists and neuroscientists have offered various approaches to support better understanding of this elusive notion of \u201cpresence.\u201d Some recommend segmenting according to:\n\u2022 Environmental presence, the feeling of being present in a\nspace\n\u2022 Social presence, feeling present with other people \u2022 Self-presence, the sensation of being a physically present\nentity. (Lee, 2004; Ratan, 2012; Won et al., 2015).\nMaintaining a persistent sense of presence in VR may have similarities to the perennial notion of \u201cflow\u201d in games design (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Chen, 2007). Chen describes designing for \u201cflow\u201d as a way to \u201cmaintain and extend an interactive experience before it is interrupted.\u201d Breaks to flow such as extra-diegetic menu screens, ludo-narrative dissonance, or anything that might call attention to the non-game circumstances of the player might be considered to work against seemingly desirable state of \u201cflow.\u201d The same philosophy is frequently encountered in VR design, where \u201ctotal immersion\u201d is presumed to be the optimum state.\nIncreasingly powerful chipsets and publicly available immersive toolsets such as Metahuman Creator for Unreal Engine (Epic Games, 2021) and D-ID (D-ID, 2022) demonstrate the capacity of converging artificial intelligence (AI) and generative adversarial network (GAN) technologies to rapidly create \u201chigh fidelity digital humans.\u201d There appears to be a corresponding trend in HCI research focussed on the delivery of \u201cvirtual information that is indistinguishable from reality\u201d (Cuervo et al., 2018; Itoh et al., 2021).\nWhilst increased \u201crealism\u201d in VR has not always been shown to correlate with heightened user presence (Nunez, 2004), this sectoral tendency is likely to further narrow the \u201cperceptual gap\u201d between virtual and physical experience (Thomas and Glowacki,\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org04\n2018) in the years ahead. Slater et al. (2020) refer to this as \u201csuperrealism\u201d a near-future condition in which \u201c(v)ery high quality visual and behavioral realism of virtual humans is becoming increasingly likely and available\u201d.\nSlater offers the following model for understanding presence:\n- Place Illusion (PI)\u2014the sensation of being in a real place - Plausibility Illusion (Psi)\u2014the illusion that a scenario being\ndepicted is actually occurring (Slater, 2009).\nThe latter provides useful nuance, allowing for the possibility of an immersed participant reporting a strong sense of presence, even eliciting \u201cresponse as if real\u201d behaviours known as RAIR (Slater, 2009), whilst retaining firm grasp of the artifice of their experience. Slater offers the above model with the qualifier that \u201cIn the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not \u201cthere\u201d and that the events are not occurring\u201d.\nFor the simulation of risk, this dual consciousness, giving cognitive priority to the virtual environment whilst retaining awareness of the physical circumstances, might be a welcome dynamic, enabling participants to feel present in a simulated scenario whilst retaining a sense of personal safety as suggested by PwC. The extent to which this dual understanding is consistent, or insulating against potential harm, however, is hotly contested.\nMadary and Metzinger (2016) call attention the way that those who use VR tend to recall their experiences by giving \u201cautophenomenological reports of the type \u201cI am this!.\u201d\u201d This is a response that seems quite different to other media experiences such as film, television and games, where users might refer to something they have \u201cwatched\u201d or \u201cplayed,\u201d rather than something they themselves have done. Madary and Metzinger suggest that VR dissolves boundaries between a user\u2019s standard phenomenal self-model (PSM) and that of the virtual persona they are embodying. They express concern that \u201cnot only that there may be unexpected psychological risks if illusions of embodiment are misused, or used recklessly, but that, if we are interested in minimizing potential damage and future psychosocial costs, these risks are themselves ethically relevant.\u201d (Madary and Metzinger, 2016).\nA recent study indicates that, whilst participants generally do understand that the virtual environment is not the same as the real environment in the moment, the spatial and relational qualities of virtual reality can make it difficult to reliably distinguish between memories of \u201creal\u201d and virtual experiences over time. They refer to this as a blurring of \u201cperceptual proximity\u201d (Rubo et al., 2021) between virtual reality and lived experience. It has been suggested that this blurring may be even more pronounced in younger participants (Liao et al., 2019) who are still forming their phenomenological self-models and sense of objective reality."

            "heading": "Embodiment",
            "text": "In virtual reality, the illusion of presence, particularly selfpresence is intrinsically linked to the concept of \u201cembodiment.\u201d This partly relates to the presence or absence of an avatar, giving the user a sense of their physicality in the virtual world. Embodiment is also intrinsically connected to the participant\u2019s ability to take action within the virtual scene. At a basic level, the embodied participant can choose where to look and for how long in a virtual reality experience. If available, the participant in VR may also choose to move around within a scene, to touch and interact with objects in the environment, to make choices that impact of the progression of the experience, to use their voice to interact with non-playable characters, AI informed characters or other participants in multi-person environments who have their own agency and embodied reality to explore within the virtual space.\nSanchez-Vives and Slater suggest that \u201cPresence is tantamount to successfully supported action in the environment...reality is formed through actions, rather than through mental filters.\u201d They go on to suggest that \u201cThe key to this approach is that the sense of \u201cbeing there\u201d in a VE is grounded on the ability to \u201cdo\u201d there\u201d (Sanchez-Vives and Slater, 2005). This is an approach that has caused some within the immersive sector to suggest replacing the term \u201cstorytelling\u201dwith more experiential, user-centric language such as \u201cstory doing\u201d (Allen, 2017), \u201cstory living\u201d (Connect4Climate, 2017; Robinson, 2016) or \u201cstory finding\u201d (Uricchio, 2020) as terms that are more indicative of the active role played by a participant within a virtual reality story world.\nTheories of embodied cognition suggest that we explore and make sense of the world (VR or otherwise) through our bodies, using senses like touch, taste, proprioception and kinaesthesia in order to map and reinforce the experiential reality of our experiences (Merleau-Ponty, 1962). Users have been shown to demonstrate high levels of \u201chomuncular flexibility\u201d adapting to unfamiliar bodies in virtual reality, rapidly accepting their own re-embodiment, for example as a frog or a dragonfly or in \u201cThe Eyes of the Animals\u201d by Marshmallow Laser Feast, a ghost-like entity without fixed corporal form \u201cBodyless\u201d by Hsin-Chien Huang. In a research context, participants have shown remarkable aptitude for accommodating additional limbs in VR simulations, rapidly remapping their standard body control systems to accommodate new kinaesthetic capabilities (Won et al., 2015).\nThe sensorial nature of presence and embodiment in VR has profound consequences for users experiencing simulations of hazardous or unsafe environments. In the infamous \u201cRubber Hand Illusion\u201d (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998) test subjects consistently experience a rubber hand as their own and seek to protect it when threatened. This illusion appears transferable into virtual reality experiences, in which \u201cVR technology directly targets the mechanism by which human beings\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org05\nphenomenologically identify with the content of their selfmodel.\u201d (Madary and Metzinger, 2016) Even without the tactile stimuli of the rubber hand illusion, some users report sensations of physical touch, colloquially termed \u201cphantom touch,\u201d in response to collisions with virtual elements or avatar-to-avatar contact in social VR spaces.\nIn a virtual reality recreation of Milgram\u2019s infamous obedience tests, Slater suggests that the perception of threat and harm in virtual reality extends beyond consequences for the subject\u2019s own body. Participants in Slater\u2019s study express concern for the safety of a virtual character, frequently refusing to deliver electrical shocks as instructed when the virtual character exhibits signs of distress. Slater et al. (2006) conclude that \u201chumans tend to respond realistically at subjective, physiological, and behavioural levels in interaction with virtual characters notwithstanding their cognitive certainty that they are not real\u201d (Slater et al., 2006). More recently the Stanford \u201cempty chair experiment\u201d has demonstrated that people will avoid sitting in a physical chair if they have previously seen it occupied by an augmented reality character, even after removing the headset that would allow them to regard it as such. These experiments suggesting a tendency for immersed participants to incorporate a virtual character\u2019s corporeality into their perceptual models (Miller et al., 2019)."

Claims about the potential of virtual reality non-fiction experiences to encourage \u201cpro-social\u201d behaviours (Milk, 2015; Slater and Sanchez-Vives, 2016) have been influential in the development of the sector, with significant support from Oculus (now Meta Quest) through their \u201cVR for Good\u201d program, providing investment for content designed to\n\u201cexpand our understanding of people and cultures around the world\u2014all through the power of virtual reality.\u201d (Oculus, 2021).\nIn response to such claims, several scholars have called into question the \u201cpro-social\u201d impact by challenging the replicability of the findings (Farmer, 2019), questioning validity and appropriateness of the claims (Nash, 2018; Rose, 2018) and the cultural assumptions and colonial lens through which notions of empathy and pro-sociality are being considered (Nakamura, 2020)."

            "text": "As alluded to above, many of the seemingly positive affordances of virtual reality simulation contain within them the potential for negative impact. In their proposed \u201ccode of ethical conduct,\u201d Madary and Metzinger (2016) offer a comprehensive appraisal of potentially problematic issues and offer some practicable guidance for the mitigation of risk. In several cases, the risks identified are the inverse of elsewhere identified positive affordances, such as eliciting empathetic responses and inducing participants to make pro-social choices. They reason \u201c(j)ust as VR can be used to increase empathy, it can conceivably be used to decrease empathy. Doing so would have obvious military applications in training soldiers to have less empathy for enemy combatants, to feel no remorse about doing violence.\u201d They also signal the risks associated with mood induction \u201cthe power of VR to induce particular kinds of emotions could be used deliberately to cause suffering.\u201d They go so far as to suggest that \u201cTorture in a virtual environment is still torture. The fact that one\u2019s suffering occurs while one is immersed in a virtual environment does not mitigate the suffering itself.\u201d\nPerhaps anticipating a \u201cbut it is not real\u201d response from their\nreadership, Madary and Metzinger assert:\n\u201cBecause of the transparency of the emotional layers in the human self-model, it will be experienced as real, even if it is accompanied by cognitive-level insight into the nature of the overall situation. Powerful emotional responses occur even when subjects are aware of the fact that they are in a virtual environment\u201d (Madary and Metzinger, 2016).\nIn \u201cMaking a New Reality,\u201d Sinclair suggests that \u201cvirtual reality pieces that hack the user\u2019s brain into feeling present in a virtual space and embodied in a virtual body require a higher level of ethical interrogation\u201d (Sinclair and Clark, 2020) calling for new standards and accountability protocols to be established for this new medium.\nMadary and Metzinger (2016) suggest that there are certain \u201cred lines not to be crossed in reality\u201d offering \u201c(o)bvious candidates for such content would be sex (virtual paedophilia, virtual rape) and violence.\u201d These red lines cover broad terrain and, if enacted, would shut down many of the most popular VR titles of the moment which, at the time of writing include Gun\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org06\nRaiders, a \u201cVR shooter for all ages\u201d (Gun Raiders Entertainment Inc., 2021) and Blade and Sorcery (Warpfrog, 2021), a medieval melee fighting game in which \u201cthe combat is limited only by your own creativity\u201d The red lines of sex and violence would also presumably apply to the VR porn industry, valued at $716 million in 2021 and projected to grow to $19 billion by 2026 (Woodford, 2021), although it may be reasonably inferred that Madary and Metzinger were referring to specific categories of sexual content in their recommendations.\nFor immersive journalism pioneer, Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a, the visceral, emotional and potentially upsetting nature of VR as a storytelling device is entirely the point. She acknowledges the risk of creating traumatic experiences and looks for approaches in her work that prioritize \u201ctelling the truth without traumatizing people\u201d (Bye, 2022). De la Pe\u00f1a recommends the existing journalistic practice of foreshadowing graphic content and offering specific content warnings in advance to give people the opportunity not to engage if they so choose. She also speaks about the responsibility of makers to consider the ethics of audience experience in what they choose to show and not show, particularly in nonfiction VR.\nFor Bailenson too, the potential to heighten emotions and simulate specific, high-stress scenarios is a strength of the medium. Referencing research working with US veterans he suggests \u201c(i)n people with PTSD, we can use VR to bring them closer to reality, to heighten their emotions by programming real-seeming environments and put them in touch with their memories\u201d (Bailenson, 2018).\nThe question of what constitutes \u201charm\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d is complex and highly subjective, with contrasting viewpoints in evidence across disciplines. We do not try to resolve this complexity in this paper, but aim to contribute to an evidence base that will support informed and responsible practice within the sector. In recent interviews with VR industry professionals, Lavoie et al. (2021) \u201chighlighted a desire for and lack of knowledge about the psychological consequences of VR.\u201d They shared that makers frequently expressed \u201cconcern for the well-being of VR users\u201d but found a vacuum of information \u201climiting their ability to take steps to mitigate any negative outcomes.\u201d With this case study we hope to offer some first steps towards better information in this regard and would welcome further evidence-based study of this topic."

IDFA DocLab is a festival of non-fiction immersive and interactive experiences and a key feature of the immersive industry calendar. The study was designed by Uricchio who was himself inspired by\nthe writings of psychologist Jerome Bruner (1986). In contemporary studies, Bruner invited subjects to give \u201cretellings\u201d of recent experiences, encouraging them to \u201ctell us back the story in their own words\u201d and (something of a linguistic red herring for our purposes), to create \u201ca virtual text.\u201d Researchers would then apply close reading techniques to explore the effect and subjectivity of each individual\u2019s experience.\nIn 2019, Uricchio and team similarly invited participants to \u201cre-tell\u201d their experiences of works in the public exhibition programme, either in verbal interviews or by completing a written questionnaire immediately following their experience. Uricchio explains; \u201cFactors such as person (\u201cI\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d or \u201che/ she\u201d), agency, and voice were as important to Bruner\u2019s analysis as the world depicted and the manner of its depiction. Did the subject \u201cwitness\u201d a scene, or were they involved as an element of or an actant in the scene? We adopted this close-reading approach in order to understand how users experienced particular immersive projects.\u201d (Uricchio, 2020).\nFollowing close analysis, Uricchio\u2019s preliminary findings suggest that a participants\u2019 demography can influence their use of first/second/third person. The study found that novice users of VR were \u201cmost effusive\u201d and frequently \u201creferred to themselves in action mode\u201d using the first person \u201cI/we\u201d forms, whereas those more familiar with the form \u201ctended to describe the projects\u2019 effect in the second and third person but rarely first\u201d (Uricchio, 2020). He also notes gender-based variations, reporting that male interviewees \u201ctended to be evaluative rather than experiential,\u201d and that female respondents were more likely to report dizziness and nausea.\nRefined research questions\nBased on the literature we created a series of research subquestions (SQ) or exploratory statements that could be further investigated in relation to our study:\nSQ1 Participants will retell their experience of the VR module as though it were something that had happened to them directly, engaging the PSM as predicted by Madary and Metzinger, and evidenced by primary use of the first person (I/we). SQ2 Participants with prior experience of VR will be more likely to use second or third person personal pronouns (you/ he/she/they) as predicted by Uricchio, indicating higher levels of detachment from the subject matter. SQ3 Participants will experience a persistent sense of presence and embodiment, reporting RAIR (Response as if real) as described by Slater in relation to the VR training materials. SQ4 The simulation of risk will be reported as emotionally impactful as predicted by Bernando, Chirico etc.\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org07\nSQ5 The simulation of risk may be reported as traumatic, as hypothesized by Madary and Metzinger."

As above (Figure 4) this predicted behaviour was not borne out in our findings. In this study the first person \u201cI/we\u201d was dominant across the spectrum of novice and familiar users, with a proportionally higher instances of second rather than first person usage in those with no prior experience of VR, inverting our expectations.\nOne interesting discovery in the data was derived from a LIWC2015 paper offering comparative baselines for how personal pronouns are commonly used in different literary contexts (Pennebaker et al., 2015). In our study, the frequency and weighting of participant\u2019s use of personal pronouns most closely resembled language used on social media platform, twitter (see Figure 5).\nTo take an evenmore granular view, zooming in on use of the first person, our participant\u2019s use of \u201cI\u201d (4.58) is almost equivalent to instances found on twitter (4.75), but approximately half that of natural speech (7.03). Instances of \u201cwe\u201d in our participant\u2019s re-tellings (1.56) were higher than any other baseline, more than twice that of twitter (0.74), and most closely resembling blog entries (0.91).\nAlthough not a defined research sub-question, we did test our data against indications from the Uricchio study that gender would contribute to the use of effusive, evaluative and experiential language. We did not find any significant correlations related to gender although it may be helpful to conduct more detailed analysis in future investigations."

Multiple people spoke about the sensation of being there and the curiousness of how quickly they were convinced of being in another place. One participant commented \u201cI was really aware of everything happening and I was reacting it like it was a real scenario.\u201d Another described the experience as something that \u201cdidn\u2019t go through my rational filter\u201d.\nAs predicted by Slater (Slater, 2009), participants retained an awareness that the events were not actually occurring, but that they still felt present, exhibiting \u201cresponse-as-if-real,\u201d cognitively prioritising the virtual reality experience over their physical surroundings.\n\u201cIt felt real, or something. I mean it is unreal but you feel emotionally connected to the experience even though you know that it is not real\u201d.\n\u201cI thought I had that very clear in my head but there were moments where I obviously reacted it like it was real life because I jumped at something.\u201d\nSome spoke about their sense of themselves in relation to the scenario, and the implications of \u201cbeing there\u201d for them personally.\n\u201ceven though I was not in the VR experience as (anon), I was aware of the fact that I was (anon), a female journalist, but also a Muslim journalist, but also a Black journalist . . . So, I was also aware of these things that I was thinking about in the back of my head, as to how people are going to respond to that.\u201d\nMany spoke about how visceral the experience was for them. One participant shared \u201cit really gives you that very physical sense of going through something, which you can\u2019t get from just going, \u201cWell, yes, there was this time when I went and did this and it was stressful and this is why.\u201d But you can\u2019t really remember how it physically felt.\u201d Several suggested that this more embodied mode of experience was a positive feature of the training, giving them a\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org11\nstrong sense of how they might now act were they to find themselves in a similar situation in real life.\nAs strong sense of presence was in evidence in the way that many of the participants spoke about their own safety e.g., \u201cthe dog could bite me,\u201d \u201cmy colleague was being assaulted very violently, and it felt like I might be next\u201d and \u201cI felt very unsafe\u201d.\nAlthough many reported feeling personally threatened or at risk, it is important to note that this was frequently referred to as a strength of the virtual reality training module, as inferred by de la Pe\u00f1a (Bye, 2022) and Bailenson (2018). One participant commented on the sense of scale she experienced. \u201cIt was really good to feel like that person behind me was someone who could intimidate me, a lot taller, a lot bigger. That was really good.\u201d This in her view, enhanced the believability and thus the efficacy of the training. Another referenced the utility of VR identified by Dalton (2021) and others to simulate danger without physical consequences \u201cIt was really useful to go beyond that and into an actual violent experience without being in any danger, that was a really helpful thing to experience.\u201d\nOne participant spoke of the compounding effect of the intensity of the content and the experience of being in a headset, a new experience for him \u201cthat feeling of being surrounded is very- Like the claustrophobia of that. Especially because you are inside this funny headset thing, which you\u2019re not used to being, so you are a bit unsure of yourself anyway.\u201d\nSome also spoke of an awareness of their safety outside of the headset. \u201cI was so worried I was going to run into the fridge or something.\u201d One spoke of a break in presence when they inadvertently stepped outside of the boundaries of the experience and gained a view of their home environment via the headset\u2019s pass-through cameras, prompting temporary confusion and disorientation.\nBeyond concerns for their own safety, in or out of the virtual world, multiple participants described a strong connection to other virtual characters, particularly \u201cRavi\u201d who is introduced as the participant\u2019s colleague, and is the victim of physical violence at the conclusion of the narrative. One participant related \u201cthese big men set upon the colleague and they beat him up, and that is very mean. And you can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d"

Beyond that, the piece has been designed\nwith limited agency and does not contain \u201cdecision points\u201d or complex interactivity.\nSeveral of the participants spoke about the frustration of not being able to take more action. One recounted that \u201cin this experience we didn\u2019t have much choices (sic) I feel very unprotected. (. . .)

Some found it particularly disconcerting that circumstances ran contrary to decisions they might have taken, \u201cthat really stressed me out, actually, because I would not have done that in real life\u201d.\nSome participants expressed a desire for more agency to enable more role playing within the scene, for example \u201cI would have liked to have the opportunity to test in a safe environment what my decision-making ability would have been.\u201d Others, however, noted the congruence to the subject matter, suggesting \u201c(i)t created that feeling of powerlessness that you might have actually while working or even some of it, even in daydreaming, it was quite effective and quite emotional.\u201d This maps to Head Set\u2019s approach in the design of the experience, choosing to simulate the \u201cfreeze response\u201d journalists might experience when faced with high stress environments.

            "text": "Based on the IDFA study by Uricchio (2020) we explored the potential of demographic factors such as gender, age and prior experience to influence participant\u2019s emotive responses. The most significant modifier seems to have been the journalist\u2019s level experience \u201cin the field\u201d prior to participating in the session. Interestingly, those responding in the most emotive terms seem to be those with either the least or the most directly related experience.\nJournalists with little experience of high-risk deployments discussed being confronted by the potential of future risks e.g., \u201cThe reality has really been forced on me that situations really can turn nasty\u201d with several confirming that they not considered the risks shown, or what their responses to them might be prior to the training.\nWe found that those with several years\u2019 experience as a journalist, but with low or no experience of high-risk situations tended to describe their experience in less emotive terms. One person reflected \u201cI saw a simulation of a public disorder covering gone wrong and it didn\u2019t really make me feel anything, to be honest.\u201d Some in this category also suggested that even stronger content might be desirable. \u201cIf it was somewhere else, where maybe gun fire was used, I would want more sessions basically. To deal with more escalated situations.\u201d\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org12\nMany of those with significant experience in high-risk deployments described their experience in VR in highly emotive, visceral terms e.g., \u201cthis feeling of stress and this feeling of helplessness. It was a very physical thing. My heartbeat went up and I was hiding away and I felt like I froze and I felt frustrated and all these are very real feelings that you will not have over a Zoom session\u201d.\nFor one experienced interviewee, the VR module gave them an opportunity to reflect on their previous experience, and how their attitudes may be changing in relation to their career trajectory:\n\u201cAnd today in the protest, because it has been a long since I\u2019ve been in a situation like that I felt like, more scared that I would feel before. We were talking about adrenalin. Before I would run towards the fire, I would run towards the protest and if someone was fighting, I would go closer to see what is going on. And maybe, lately, which is something that I don\u2019t really like to recognise, because it means that I am becoming weaker in a way, for myself. I ammaybe feeling a bit, erm, trying to keep more distance from bad situations.\u201d\nIn this instance the virtual reality experience, coupled with the workshop activities that followed appears to have given them an opportunity to rehearse challenging scenarios and consider their own personal and professional response.\nWhilst the overall curve seems to suggest that those with low or high experience will retell their experiences in more emotive terms than those with moderate levels of experience, it is notable that the outlier in this was the most experienced journalist we spoke to who was comparatively dispassionate in his response to the VR content. This individual had 25 years as a journalist and had been involved in 50 + high risk deployments. He shared, \u201cI sort of saw it as a representation that was not within my actual space\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a real connection with the kicking on the floor. I was still watching it as a game.\u201d\nAs an additional caveat, although prior experience appears to have played a crucial role, several people spoke about the value of the virtual reality module as providing a common point of reference across the cohort \u201cthe VR experience all put us on a level field, so we had all gone through something even if we hadn\u2019t experienced it in real life for years and years like other people had\u201d.\nGiven the range of responses, research sub-question 4 (SQ4) which predicted that \u201cthe simulation of risk will be reported as emotionally impactful\u201d has proved too general of a statement to adequately interrogate here. It would be useful for future studies to explore the hypothesis that close perceptual proximity experienced in VR can result in the same simulated scenario eliciting a range of subjective emotive responses among participants. These responses we identified appear strongly linked to the participant\u2019s prior experience and personal context. A larger sample size in future studies might offer greater insight into the influence of direct subject-matter contact and autobiographical experience in responses to VR and the simulation of risk."

The full Head Set curriculum gives participants an opportunity to explore their own responses in a professionally guided setting and encourages them to gradually re-establish boundaries between real and virtual threat.\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org13\nThis layer of expertise and support does not always connect well with the commercial models being recommended in industry, particularly those suggesting that VR is cost effective because it can remove the need for specialist training providers (PwC, 2019).

            "text": "Returning to our initial research questions:\nRQ1: How do participants experience and communicate their own sense of presence, safety and agency in relation to this particular virtual reality experience? RQ2: What are the ethical dimensions and questions that should be considered when producing virtual reality simulations of unsafe environments?\nOur findings seem to suggest that participants in this virtual reality simulation experienced the scenario in a direct and active form. Encounters are primarily recalled and framed as though the VR was something that the participants experienced for themselves, rather than witnessed at a mediated distance.\nWe noted the connected dynamics of presence, safety, agency and external association in this particular case study. Each factor impacting on the participant\u2019s personal relationship to the content and affecting the visceral and emotive nature of their reporting. We observed particularly strong connections between a participant\u2019s sense of personal safety and their experience of presence as well as their agency, or capacity to take action within the scenario.\nIn the retelling of their experiences, participants in this study exhibited strong emotional and visceral connections to their own, virtually present character, and to those of the wider cast of virtual beings. Reports of feeling physically intimidated by some and deeply concerned for the safety of others permeate the transcripts. This seems to support claims (Slater et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2019) that the sense of physicality, risk and threat in VR is not constrained to the user\u2019s own phenomenal self-model (PSM), and should be carefully considered in the design of highrisk scenario simulations.\nWe noted the positive linkage made by many participants between heightened emotional experience and the effectiveness of the training. This supports ideas that the enhanced sense of presence and embodiment available to designers of VR experiences can be leveraged for the production of impactful training materials.\nWe identified that prior experience, at least within this sample was a strong indicator of how an immersive work would be received. In this case participants with the most and the least direct experience of the subject matter using more\nemotive language in recalling of their own experience. Whilst these responses were generally regarded as positive and constructive by participants, a way to rehearse one\u2019s own response to risk in a controlled setting, a small grouping found that the experience triggered unwelcome or upsetting memories related to their own histories.\nOur industry partner Head Set were aware of the potential impact of their work prior to engagement with this study. In addition to the VR simulation under scrutiny, it should be kept in mind that they have developed a range of \u201cemotional scaffolding\u201d tools that wrap around the VR experience e.g., pre-engagement survey, discussion forums, signposted mental health resources and expert guidance in order to hold in balance that which de la Pe\u00f1a might describe as \u201ctelling the truth without traumatizing people\u201d (Bye, 2022).\nOne such example is the way that they capture information about each participant\u2019s prior experience before they begin the course. Part of their internal company language is to classify participants on a scale:\n\u2022 green, having never covered high risk; \u2022 orange, having covered high risk but never been in a\n\u201cscrape\u201d;\n\u2022 red; having covered a lot of high risk and potentially been\nin some life threatening \u201cscrapes\u201d.\nSuch pre-classification and flexibility allows Head Set to plan and subtly adapt each session to the anticipated needs of the participants. Based on the literature around responsible approaches when deploying \u201crisky content\u201d in VR (Madary and Metzinger, 2016; Slater et al., 2020) such safeguarding seems entirely appropriate and may well be indicative of best practice at this stage in the evolution of the sector.\nFor the purposes of this study, the adaptation may also have partially limited our ability to gain insight into what would have happened, were such preparation and adaptability not factored in. It is difficult to assess whether instances of rumination or reminiscence around prior trauma, for example, would have been more or less pronounced were such accommodations not in place.\nFrom an ethical perspective, our results seem to suggest that simulation of high-risk content should be developed, if at all, by those with an informed understanding of the interconnected affordances of presence and embodiment, social dynamics and agency, as well as the impact of each on a participant\u2019s perception of their own safety. How that might be implemented in an industrial context is challenging and may require some level of legislative intervention, the creation of a recognised qualification, kitemark or approved provider status to support user safety. Again, further research and collaboration with additional industry partners and policymakers would be highly valuable in this space.\nFrontiers in Virtual Reality frontiersin.org14\nEarly findings from this study provide a challenge to the prevailing notion of VR training as a cost-effective business model, imagined to replace in-person training or e-learning modules, or to render expert supervision obsolete.\nOverall, we have illustrated that the simulation of risk in virtual reality for training purposes can offer providers and participants a potent, impactful and distinctive platform for experiential learning. We would suggest that training providers simulating risk and danger have a duty of care to those who might experience their work. This may include a responsibility to give content warnings and to provide targeted emotional support. Although difficult to explore in this small study, it seems likely that the auxiliary resources provided by Head Set made a positive contribution to the experience of their participants, and we would welcome further study to better understand the implications of differing approaches."
