            "text": "Cognitive impairment, which was an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia, is an important health problem in China (Petersen et al., 1999, 2001, 2014; Xue et al., 2018). The prevalence of cognitive impairment was reported to be 14.7% in the old Chinese (Xue et al., 2018). Considering the large aging population in China, many people might suffer from cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment could increase the risk of dementia, disability, and mortality, which highlight the importance of identifying potential risk factors for cognitive impairment (Shimada et al., 2016; van Rossum and Koek, 2016; Bae et al., 2018).\nPhysical function was reported to be closely related to cognitive impairment (Tangen et al., 2014). The physiological connection between physical function and cognitive impairment might be that physical function depends on the signals and feedback from the vestibular system and brain (Massion, 1998; van der Kooij et al., 1999; Cullen, 2012). Previous studies found that the occurrence of physical function impairment precedes the occurrence of cognitive impairment, which suggested that measurement of physical function might be a useful tool in screening future cognitive impairment (Camicioli et al., 1998; Buracchio et al., 2010).\nStanding balance is an important component of physical function. Several studies have examined the associations between standing balance and cognitive performance (Leandri et al., 2009; Wilkins et al., 2013; Bolandzadeh et al., 2015; Bahureksa et al., 2017; Goto et al., 2018). The Cardiovascular Health Study found a positive correlation between standing balance and cognition in older adults (Meunier et al., 2021). However, this study was conducted in elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases, and the findings were not validated in a large cohort of middle-aged and old adults. In addition, it is also unclear whether this association also existed in the middle-aged and old Chinese, and whether the decline rate of cognition differed in people with different ability of standing balance.\nThis prospective study examined the association between standing balance and cognitive function in a large cohort of middle-aged and older Chinese adults from the Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The CHARLS was chosen because the cohort underwent several cognitive tests (Zhao et al., 2014)."

The CHARLS is a national longitudinal survey conducted by the National School of Development at\nPeking University involving a large cohort of individuals aged \u226545 years in China. The survey had a multi-wave design and included several cognitive tests. Researchers can access the data by providing basic information online and signing a data use agreement. The survey protocol and implementation were described in a previous study (Zhao et al., 2014).\nFigure 1 shows the flowchart of patients selection. The 2011 baseline survey (wave 1) recruited 17,708 participants from 28 Chinese provinces, 150 counties/districts, and 450 areas, and the overall response rate was 80.5%. In this cohort, 13,965 (78.9%) participants underwent physical tests, and 203 participants were excluded because of memory-related diseases, resulting in a sample size of 13,762 participants at baseline. Follow-up interviews were conducted in 2013 (wave 2) and 2015 (wave 3). Among the enrollees, 3,742 were lost to follow-up, and 10,020 were re-interviewed in wave 3. Of these, 314 had missing data on the balance test in the wave 1 survey, and 1,207 did not undergo the cognitive test. Thus, 8,499 people were included in the analysis.\nThis research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Peking University. All participants gave written informed consent.

Mental status was assessed using the Cognitive Status test (Meng et al., 2019). Participants were asked to do a serial subtraction from 100 by 7 (up to five times) and date recall. The scores of TICS-10 ranges from 0 to 10 (Folstein et al., 1975). Episodic memory and visuospatial working memory were evaluated using a modified questionnaire based on American Health and Retirement Study. In assessing episodic memory, 10 unrelated Chinese words were read to each participant, and then each participant was asked to recall these words immediately (immediate word recall) and 4 min later (delayed word recall) as much as possible. The ability of episodic memory was evaluated based on the average number of words recalled correctly by participants in immediate recall and delayed recall (Lei et al., 2012). The score of episodic memory ranged from 0 to 10 (McArdle et al., 2007). Visuospatial working memory was assessed by asking participants to redraw a picture of overlapping pentagons on the paper, and participants who were able and unable to redraw were given a score of 1 and 0, respectively (Mathuranath et al., 2000). The total score of cognitive functioning (global cognition) was calculated as the sum of the scores of mental status, episodic memory, and visuospatial working memory,\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Flowchart of patient selection.\nranging from 0 to 21.

In addition, poor balance was associated with a faster decline in mental function and global cognition.\nThese results demonstrate that poor balance is associated with lower cognitive performance in the Chinese population, consistent with other studies (Goto et al., 2018; Meunier et al., 2021). For instance, a population-based longitudinal study assessed the association between physical performance (4 m walk, five-chair stand, handgrip, and standing balance) and dementia and found that balance was strongly associated with new-onset dementia (hazard ratio = 1.9\u20132.5, p = 0.02) (Bullain et al., 2016). In addition, the Cardiovascular Health Study involving 4,811 participants aged \u226567 years and followed for 6 years found that individuals with poor balance had a faster rate of cognitive decline after adjusting for confounders (\u03b2 = \u22120.21, 95% CI = \u22120.37, \u22120.05) compared with the control group (Meunier et al., 2021). Our results demonstrated that balance test scores were an independent predictor of changes in cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults in China. Our findings suggested that interventions in preventing cognitive impairment should be adopted at the same time if participants had limitation in physical function.\nThe mechanisms underlying the association between standing balance and cognitive decline remain unclear. Static balance depends on the cooperation between sensory (vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual), musculoskeletal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems (Hausdorff et al., 2003; Sturnieks et al., 2008; Abate et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2021). Impairments in brain structures and functions may explain the connection between cognitive function and static balance (Kido et al., 2010; Makizako et al., 2013). In addition, this association may be mediated by the vestibular system (Cullen, 2012). The vestibulo-ocular reflex and musculoskeletal system control posture by integrating information from the vestibular cortex, visual cortex, and somatosensory system (Massion, 1998; van der Kooij et al., 1999). Vestibular deterioration and dysfunction are related to poor balance and cognitive decline (Smith and Zheng, 2013; Bigelow and Agrawal, 2015; D\u2019Silva et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying this association and strategies to prevent cognitive impairment should be further studied.\nThis study has strengths. First, participants were from a large national prospective study conducted in China, and standardized protocols and rigid quality control\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nprocedures were adopted in the surveys. Second, a longitudinal methodology was used to assess whether standing balance predicted changes in cognition over a long follow-up period.\nThis study has limitations. First, although the regression models adjusted for demographics, health behaviors, and chronic diseases, other covariates, including genetic factors, were not considered in the analyses. Second, some participants were excluded because of missing data, potentially leading to selection bias. Third, the cognitive function test did not measure the level of cognitive impairment. Therefore, additional studies are needed to investigate the relationship between standing balance and the level of cognitive function."
