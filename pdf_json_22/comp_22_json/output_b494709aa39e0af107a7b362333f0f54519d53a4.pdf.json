    "abstractText": "The emerging K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides with unique hydride ions (H ) and O coexisting in the anion sublattice offer superior functionalities for numerous applications. However, the exploration and innovations of the oxyhydrides are challenged by their rarity as a limited number of compounds reported in experiments, owing to the stringent laboratory conditions. Herein, we employed a suite of computations involving ab initio methods, informatics and machine learning to investigate the stability relationship of the K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides. The comprehensive stability map of the oxyhydrides chemical space was constructed to identify 76 new compounds with good thermodynamic stabilities using the high-throughput computations. Based on the established database, we reveal geometric constraints and electronegativities of cationic elements as significant factors governing the oxyhydrides stabilities via informatics tools. Besides fixed stoichiometry compounds, mixed-cation oxyhydrides can provide promising properties due to the enhancement of compositional tunability. However, the exploration of the mixed compounds is hindered by their huge quantity and the rarity of stable oxyhydrides. Therefore, we propose a two-step machine learning workflow consisting of a simple transfer learning to discover 114 formable oxyhydrides from thousands of unknown mixed compositions. The predicted high H conductivities of the representative oxyhydrides indicate their suitability as energy conversion materials. Our study provides an insight into the oxyhydrides chemistry which is applicable to other mixed-anion systems, and demonstrates an efficient computational paradigm for other materials design applications, which are challenged by the unavailable and highly unbalanced materials database.",

However, the exploration and innovations of the oxyhydrides are challenged by their rarity as a limited number of compounds reported in experiments, owing to the stringent laboratory conditions. Herein, we employed a suite of computations involving ab initio methods, informatics and machine learning to investigate the stability relationship of the K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides. The comprehensive stability map of the oxyhydrides chemical space was constructed to identify 76 new compounds with good thermodynamic stabilities using the high-throughput computations. Based on the established database, we reveal geometric constraints and electronegativities of cationic elements as significant factors governing the oxyhydrides stabilities via informatics tools. Besides fixed stoichiometry compounds, mixed-cation oxyhydrides can provide promising properties due to the enhancement of compositional tunability. However, the exploration of the mixed compounds is hindered by their huge quantity and the rarity of stable oxyhydrides. Therefore, we propose a two-step machine learning workflow consisting of a simple transfer learning to discover 114 formable oxyhydrides from thousands of unknown mixed compositions. The predicted high H\u2212 conductivities of the representative oxyhydrides indicate their suitability as energy conversion materials. Our study provides an insight into the oxyhydrides chemistry which is applicable to other mixed-anion systems, and demonstrates an efficient computational paradigm for other materials design applications, which are challenged by the unavailable and highly unbalanced materials database.\nKEYWORDS\nhydrogen energy materials, oxyhydrides, hydride ion, thermodynamic stability, first principles calculations, machine learning"

            "text": "Mixed-anion compounds beyond homoanionic materials impart intriguing properties by the virtual of the anionic diversity in ionic radius, electronegativities and polarizability (Kageyama et al., 2018; Kobayashi et al., 2018; Zapp et al., 2021; Maeda et al., 2022). In particular, oxyhydrides with the coexistence O2- and H\u2212 in the anion sublattice offer a superior functionality for materials design, as exemplified in electrolytes (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Takeiri et al., 2019; Matsui et al., 2020; Nawaz et al., 2020; Takeiri et al., 2022), catalysts (Kobayashi et al., 2017) and precursors for topochemical reaction (Masuda et al., 2015; Yajima et al., 2015; Mikita et al., 2016). The lightest mass, large polarizability and high redox potential (-2.3 V) of hydride ions enable the oxyhydrides as novel energy storage and conversion materials (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Takeiri et al., 2019; Matsui et al., 2020; Nawaz et al., 2020; Lav\u00e9n et al., 2021; Maeda et al., 2022; Takeiri et al., 2022), and the complex interplay between H\u2212 with unique electronic configurations and O2- qualifies the oxyhydrides as magnetic devices (Hayward et al., 2002; Bridges et al., 2005; Yajima et al., 2022). Thanks to the unique characteristics of hydride ions, the discovery of oxyhydrides standing for the frontier of chemistry will open an exciting chemical space serving various applications.\nIn contrast to massive single-anion compounds, the stable oxyhydrides necessitate robust structural frameworks to accommodate distinctive H\u2212 and O2-, resulting in the scarcity\nof the materials (Yamaguchi, 2016; Bai et al., 2018; Kageyama et al., 2018; Kobayashi et al., 2018). Recently, a series of oxyhydrides in the K2NiF4-type structure with an A2BH1+xO3x (x = 0, 1, 2) formula were synthesized in experiments and drew a broad interest with promising properties (Figure 1A) (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Fjellv\u00e5g et al., 2019; Takeiri et al., 2019; Matsui et al., 2020; Nawaz et al., 2020; Takeiri et al., 2022). The K2NiF4-type structure belongs to a member of Ruddlesden-Popper family consisting of a rock salt and perovskite layer stacked along the c direction (Figure 1A) (Kobayashi et al., 2018). A breakthrough study successfully utilized La2LiHO3 as solid-state electrolytes with hydride ions as charge carriers, and demonstrated the exceptionally high H\u2212 conductivities in its A-mixed LaSrLiH2O2 analogs as 0.12 mS/cm at 573 K (Kobayashi et al., 2016). In addition to ionic conductors, Hayward et al. discovered La2CoH0.7O3 as magnetic devices arising from its anionic ordering (Hayward et al., 2002; Bridges et al., 2005). Thus, a perovskites-related structural framework provides a tunable sublattice to stabilize the oxyhydrides with excellent functionalities (Bai et al., 2018).\nDespite of the rigid framework and attractive properties, the innovations and developments of the K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides are still in their infancy as only tens of materials (<20) reported in laboratories (Takeiri et al., 2022). The rarity of oxyhydrides is aggravated by the stringent experimental conditions (Tassel et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2018; Kageyama et al., 2018). While the reducing nature of H\u2212 demands the strict air/water-free\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org02\nenvironments (Kageyama et al., 2018), the versatility of anion sublattice to adopt distinctive ions consequently requests the high temperature and pressure conditions (Tassel et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2018). The paucity of the oxyhydrides hinders the progression of applications, and therefore highlights the necessity of expanding their chemistry with high efficiency. Highthroughput density functional theory (HT-DFT) computations are demonstrated as efficient tools to explore the uncharted chemical space (Emery et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019; He et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), helping to guide the laboratory synthesis. In light of the stabilities data generated by the HT-DFT, the stability trend as a function of compound chemistry and their physical origin can be uncovered via the informatics tools (Sun et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2021).\nApart from the unmixed crystals (e.g., La2LiHO3), mixedcation compounds (e.g., LaSrLiH2O2) constitute a large portion of compositional space and offer a new dimensionality for targeted properties (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2018; Matsui et al., 2020). The highest conductivity of a series of the oxyhydrides can be achieved in the A-mixed compounds LaSrLiH2O2 with 0.21 mS/cm at 590 K (Kobayashi et al., 2016). However, the survey of the mixed materials is challenged by an enormous quantity of their configurations, and therefore calls for more robust search methods such as machine learning (ML) algorithm (Ye et al., 2018; Chenebuah et al., 2021; Talapatra et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2021). While using the ML model to survey materials with promising properties can be extremely powerful, a key roadblock in our task and many similar studies (Cubuk et al., 2019; Jha et al., 2019; Hashimoto et al., 2020; Chen and Ong, 2021; Hanaoka, 2022) to utilize ML approach often points to the unavailability of the database due to their huge quantity. Even though the HT-DFT can be applied to generate the small size database by randomly selecting compounds, the paucity of stable-labeled compounds may disable its usability owing to the highly unbalanced data distribution, which calls for an optimized method that creates the valid database. Since mixed materials share similarity with unmixed compounds in many aspects, it is reasonable to transfer the stability rules learned from the calculated unmixed compounds to preliminarily screen the mixed compounds. Then, the shortlist mixed compounds with high possibility to be stable can be accurately calculated to generate the valid database with a reasonable data distribution for the further ML survey.\nIn this study, we employed a suite of materials design tools involving HT-DFT, informatics and the ML algorithm to discover and explain the stability relationship of the K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides (Figure 1B). First, we investigated the stability landscape of the unmixed A2BH1+xO3-x oxyhydrides covering 1856 compounds by HT-DFT computations, and identified hundreds of new meta/stable compounds. Then, the genuine materials\ndatabase inspired us to reveal geometric constraints and electronegativities of cationic elements as significant factors governing the oxyhydrides stabilities via informatics tools. Finally, the mixed-cation oxyhydrides were explored by the two-step ML screening, consisting of a simple transfer learning trained by the unmixed compounds to generate reasonable database and a sequential voting classifier survey. Then, the high hydride conductivities of the selected mixed oxyhydrides indicate their promising applications as energy conversion materials. Our study enhances the understanding of the oxyhydrides chemistry applicable to other mixed-anion systems, and formulates the simple and effective computational workflow for other materials design applications, where a large volume of data is unavailable and the data distribution is highly unbalanced."

The parameters used in spin-polarized calculations were consistent with the Materials Project (Jain et al., 2011), ensuring the total energies converged to 1 meV per atom. The reciprocal k-mesh density was set as 200 per number of atoms to balance the computational cost and accuracy. The valence states of hydrogen in materials were investigated by the Bader (Henkelman et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2009) and Mulliken population analysis implemented in the LOBSTER program (Maintz et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2020). With reference to the Bader charge of H\u2212 in synthesized La2LiHO3 as -0.64 e \u2212 (Bai et al., 2018), we relax the criterion of the hydrogen Bader charge < -0.5 e\u2212 to ensure the valence states of H\u2212 in all compounds.\nAb initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed in the representative A-mixed oxyhydrides to investigate H\u2212 conduction.

Relaxed structures were assigned an initial temperature of 100 K in line with the Boltzmann distribution, and then heated to multiple target temperatures by velocity scaling during 2 ps. The total time of AIMD simulations was at least 50 ps until the diffusivity achieved converged (He et al., 2018). Diffusivities, activation energies and ionic conductivities of hydride ions in the oxyhydrides were obtained based on the established methods (Mo et al., 2011; Bai et al., 2018; He et al., 2018).\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org03"

An orthorhombic unit cell of La2LiHO3 was used as a prototype structure for A2BHO3, while a tetragonal unit cell of Sr2LiH3O served for A2BH2O2 and A2BH3O compositions following experimental characterizations (Kobayashi et al., 2016). Possible cationic configurations of A2BH1+xO3-x were prepared by enumerating elements from the periodic table excluding H, O, S, Se, Te, F, Cl, Br, I, radioactive and noble gas elements. In terms of the common oxidation states for constituting elements (Talapatra et al., 2021), 1856 chargebalanced compounds were selected to be fully optimized via DFT computations. Considering the site selectivity of anions in oxyhydrides (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material) (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2018), two configurations with the preference of H\u2212 over apical and equatorial sites were constructed for each compound, respectively. Thermodynamic stability of the material with the lowest energy was evaluated by the energy above the hull \u0394Ehull (Ong et al., 2008) with respect to competing phases in Materials Project containing 144595 available compounds (Jain et al., 2013). A-mixed A1A2BH2O2 compounds with cation mixing were calculated based on the structural model of LaSrLiH2O2 adopting the La/ Sr order with the lowest energies obtained as previous studies (Bai et al., 2018)."

The dA-X and dB-X were estimated based on the bond valence theory as previous studies (Zhang et al., 2007; Balachandran et al., 2018). The permutation-based feature importance (K\u00f6nig et al., 2021) used in calculations can reduce the bias from high cardinality and correlated features, ensuring the accuracy of our analysis.\nDue to the complexity of the mixed-cation oxyhydrides, we constructed a dataset of 70 descriptors (Table S2) by applying mathematical operations (e.g., subtract, average, standard deviation) to the original descriptors to identify the stable materials. In order to use the ML model trained by the unmixed compounds to screen the mixed compounds, the feature dimension of the mixed compounds was kept as the unmixed ones. The A-site elemental properties (fA) were estimated by the arithmetic mean of the two mixed ions (i.e., fA = (fA1 + fA2)/2) following previous studies (Bartel et al., 2019; Chenebuah et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022)."

Regarding Ba2YHO3 exhibiting the highest \u0394Ehull as 65 meV/atom in all synthesized oxyhydrides (Table S8) (Nawaz et al., 2020), we relax this criterion and consider a oxyhydride with \u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/atom exhibiting a high likelihood of experimental synthesizability. We observe a gaussian-like distribution (Figure 2) of the oxyhydrides as a function of \u0394Ehull, with a median \u0394Ehull as 395 meV per atom and a small portion of compounds at the left and right extreme. Only 4.5% oxyhydrides exhibit \u0394Ehull less than 100 meV/atom (Figure 2) awaiting the future experimental realization. The shape of the oxyhydrides distribution with \u0394Ehull is similar to those of oxynitrides and oxyfluorides reported in other studies (Wang et al., 2021), suggesting a similar formation trend in mixed anion systems. The paucity of synthesizable compounds confirmed by our study highlights the necessity of efficient HT computations for materials discovery.\nThe effect of chemical compositions on the oxyhydrides stability was investigated by constructing stability map (Figure 3) in terms of elements at A and B sites, respectively. While 67 considered elements for the A2BH1+xO3-x composition can yield ~4400 configurations, many compounds fail to satisfy the charge balance criterion (gray blocks in Figure 3) due to the high oxidation states of constituent elements. For example, the elements (e.g., rare earth, B, Al, Ga, In, N, P, As, Sb, Bi, Y and Sc) with +3 oxidation state at A sites can hardly form chargeneutral compositions in the A2BH1+xO3-x formula (Figure 3) except for +1 cations (e.g., alkali metals and Ag) at B sites. We excluded those charge-unbalanced compounds from further computations owing to their inherently Coulombic instabilities.\nAs for other 1856 charge-balanced oxyhydrides, 7 and 77 compounds are found to be thermodynamically stable (\u0394Ehull = 0 meV/atom) and metastable (0 < \u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/ atom), respectively (Table 1 and S8). The valence states of H\u2212 in those newly predicted compounds are confirmed by the Bader analysis (Table S8). All synthesized compounds, i.e., Ln2LiHO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm) (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Iwasaki et al., 2018), Ba2MHO3 (M = Y and Sc) (Takeiri et al., 2019; Nawaz et al., 2020) and M2LiH3O (M = Sr and Ba) (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Takeiri et al., 2022), were identified as meta/stable materials by our compositional screening (Figure 3 and Table 1), confirming the validity of our computations. We note ~60% synthesized oxyhydrides exhibiting metastability with \u0394Ehull less than 100 meV/atom (Figure 3; Table 1 and\nFIGURE 2 Distribution (left y-axis) and the cumulative fraction (right y-axis) of the A2BH1+xO3-x (x = 0, 1, 2) oxyhydrides as a function of \u0394Ehull.

Apart from eight synthesized compounds, 76 oxyhydrides are predicted to be meta/stable with a high likelihood of experimental synthesizability, greatly enlarging a library of the oxyhydrides.\nThe preference of elements occupying A and B sites was visualized by constructing the periodic table in terms of the element\u2019s occurrence in meta/stable A2BH1+xO3-x (Figure 4). We observe a high frequency of alkali and alkaline earth metals on the A site with transition metals and p-block elements (e.g., Mg, Al and Ga) on the B site (Figures 3, 4 and Table S8), such as Na2AlH3O, K2ScH3O, Sr2MgH2O2 and\nNa2NbHO3. Such pattern of the constituting elements in the oxyhydrides in the K2NiF4 framework is similar to that of perovskites reported by multiple experimental and computational studies due to their structural similarity (Figure 1A) (Emery et al., 2016; Talapatra et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2021).\nWe note the preference of Li over B sites with lanthanides at A sites in meta/stable compounds (Figures 3, 4), which is consistent with multiple Ln2LiHO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm) oxyhydrides reported in experiments (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Takeiri et al., 2022). However, other alkali metals except Li cannot form meta/stable oxyhydrides with lanthanides.

In addition to the explored oxyhydrides, various meta/stable compounds containing novel cations (e.g., Cr, Al, Ga and Mn) at B site are recognized by our computations (Figures 3, 4), with most of those unexplored in experiments. The HT-DFT calculations expand the chemistry of K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides by providing formable materials with new compositions, and allow us to obtain a complete stability picture in the uncharted chemical space."

While some stable perovskites still have smaller ions at A sites (Emery et al., 2016), all meta/stable oxyhydrides appear in the lower-right region with rA > rB\n(Figure 6A), and demonstrate a tendency of clustering within the rectangular box (0.55 \u00c5 < rB < 1.05 \u00c5, 1.20 \u00c5 < rA < 1.95 \u00c5), implicating the strictly geometric requirement to form the stable K2NiF4 structures. The preference of ionic radius results from the difference between the coordination number of A and B sites and the corresponding space to accommodate the cations, where A-site cations are coordinated by nine anions in comparison with six anions surrounding B sites (Figure 1A). We also utilize the decision tree algorithm to analyze the influence of rA and rB on the oxyhydrides stabilities (Figure S3). Most stable oxyhydrides (74 out of 93) belong to the node with rB < 1.005 \u00c5 and rA > 1.314 \u00c5 (Figure S3). The decision tree analysis indicates stable oxyhydrides tend to have rA > rB, which is consistent with our analysis based on the structure map (Figure 6A).\nIn addition to ionic radius, tolerance factors tbv of the oxyhydrides were investigated, in reference to tbv of an ideal K2NiF4 structure as 1. Most oxyhydrides tend to be meta/stable within the range of 0.8 \u2264 tbv \u2264 1.2 (Figure 6B), which is consistent with the experimental observation (Matsui et al., 2020).

            "text": "Apart from geometric constraints, the electronic origin of the oxyhydrides stability can be rationalized by analyzing the charge transfer between cations and hydride ions. To ensure the negative charge of hydride ions, electron density should be donated by cations to hydrogen, as schematically illustrated in Figure 7A. The opposite direction of charge transfer causes the oxidation of hydrogen, and destabilizes the compounds (Figure 7A). Since electronegativities of elements are crucial factors influencing the charge distribution in chemical bonding, we plotted the structure map of the oxyhydrides (Figure 7B) as a function of electronegativity of an element at A site (\u03c7A) vs that at B site (\u03c7B). In all meta/stable oxyhydrides (\u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/atom), electronegativities of cationic elements at A/B sites are smaller than the electronegativity of H as 2.20 (Figure 7B). Smaller electronegativities of A/B-site elements can prevent the charge transferring from hydrogen to cations and the consequent hydrogen oxidation, contributing to stabilizing the oxyhydrides.\nIn addition to the inhibition of hydrogen oxidation as a requisite to stabilize the materials, there should be extremely\nelectropositive cations contributing electrons to hydrogen. A large electronegativity between the cationic element and H can facilitate the charge transfer. We find 98% meta/stable oxyhydrides possess at least one extremely electropositive element with \u03c7 < 1.25 (Figure 7C) to mainly supply electron density. To better visualize the stability trend as a function of electronegativities, compounds are classified into four categories with respective to \u03c7A/\u03c7B \u2212 1.25, and 82 out of 84 meta/stable oxyhydrides fall into the category I and II (Figure 7C). Meta/stable compounds belonging to category I with \u03c7A < 1.25 and \u03c7B > 1.25 have A-site cations mainly acting as electron donors to ensure the valence states of hydride ions and to stabilize materials. Those materials (e.g., Ba2ScHO3 and Sr2GaHO3) correspond to the high frequency of alkali and alkaline earth metals on the A site with transition metals and p-block elements on the B site as observed in the periodic table (Figure 4). Compounds in category II benefit from two potential electron donors with small \u03c7 < 1.25, which correspond to multiple Ln2LiHO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd and Sm) oxyhydrides already explored in experiments (Figure 3 and La2LiHO3 in Table 2). Although the materials in category III possess B-site cations with \u03c7 < 1.25, the lack of formable oxyhydrides in this group originates from the geometric perspective. tbv of compounds in this category exhibit the obvious deviation from the optimal range as 0.8\u20131.2 (Figure 7D), because the electropositive B-site cations always have large ionic radius to distort the layerperovskite structures. Few meta/stable oxyhydrides are found in category IV due to the absence of electropositive cations. The exception of Tl2PHO3 and Hg2PH3O as\nFIGURE 6 (A) Structure map of A2BH1+xO3-x (x = 0, 1, 2) oxyhydrides with the Shannon ionic radius of ion at A site (rA) vs that at B site (rB).

Five representative oxyhydrides are highlighted, i.e., (A) Ba2ScHO3 (\u0394Ehull = 0 meV/atom), A1: Hg2ScHO3 (\u0394Ehull = 366 meV/atom), (B) Sr2GaHO3 (\u0394Ehull = 22 meV/atom), B1: Tl2GaH3O (\u0394Ehull = 199 meV/atom) and (C) La2LiHO3 (\u0394Ehull = 20 meV/atom).

(D) Distribution of tbv for the oxyhydrides belonging to category I and III in Figure 7C, respectively.\nmetastable compounds in this category might result from the lack of competing phases in the materials database, which underestimates their decomposition energies.\nTwo groups of representative materials (i.e., A: Ba2ScHO3, A1: Hg2ScHO3 and B: Sr2GaHO3, B1: Tl2GaH3O) are highlighted to illustrate the strong correlation among electronegativity, charge transfer and phase stability (Figure 7C and Table 2). In contrast to Ba2ScHO3 (A) and Sr2GaHO3 (B), the absence of extreme electropositive cations in Hg2ScHO3 (A1) and Tl2GaH3O (B1) impedes the charge transfer to anions, which can be manifested by the decreased negative charge of hydrogen from the Bader charge and Mulliken population analysis (Table 2). The failure of the electronic stabilization leads to the increase of \u0394Ehull for those materials (Table 2). Such trend can also be confirmed by the decision tree analysis (Figure S5), where stable oxyhydrides (81 out of 93) belongs to the node with \u03c7B < 1.82 and \u03c7A < 1.225. Thus, the electronic stabilization of the\noxyhydrides demands the constituting elements with \u03c7 < \u03c7H and at least one extremely electropositive cation.\nBy applying the aforementioned geometric and electronegativity constraints, 228 compounds were selected from 1856 hypothetical compositions, with 74 of those candidates predicted to be meta/stable. The high ratio (32%) of formable oxyhydrides in shortlisted compounds in comparison with 5% by the random guess demonstrates the geometric constraints and elemental electronegativity as significant factors affecting the oxyhydrides stabilities."

For example, A-mixed LaSrLiH2O2 demonstrated the highest H\u2212 conductivity as 0.21 mS/cm at 590 K in experiments (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Matsui et al., 2020). However, an enormous number of possible configurations cause mixed oxyhydrides relatively untapped, placing computational materials discovery as an efficient tool. Taking the A1A2BH2O2 oxyhydrides as an example, the quantity of 17618 charge-neutral compounds disables the enumerated DFT calculations due to great expanse, calling for a more robust survey tool. An obvious tendency of the materials stability with respect to elemental and structural features (Section 3.2) reminds us of employing the ML algorithm to differentiate stable mixed-cation compounds.\nSince LaSrLiH2O2 of the A1A2BH2O2 composition exhibits the best conduction properties, we choose the A1A2BH2O2 oxyhydrides as a model to illustrate our workflow handling the enormous compositional possibilities. Initially, seven candidate classifiers were trained based on the unmixed oxyhydrides dataset and 70 descriptors (Table S2) to differentiate meta/stable compounds (\u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/atom). While their classification performance can be evaluated by multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, f1 score and precision), the highly imbalanced database containing fewer meta/stable oxyhydrides imposes f1 score as a major index for model assessment (Note S2). Among all classifiers, the voting classifier demonstrates the highest cross-validated f1 score as 0.88 with fewer descriptors utilized (Figure 8A; Figure S6; Table 3 and Table S3). Its excellent performance is also proved by the high precision (0.93) and recall rate (0.84) in the precision-recall curve (Figure 8B), with good accuracy (0.99) and separability indicated by the confusion matrix\n(Figure 8C) and the ROC curve (Figure 8D). Outstanding metrics of the voting model to identify meta/stable compounds indicate its capability of capturing overarching factors impacting oxyhydrides stabilities.\nWe then transfer the trained classification model to search A-mixed A1A2BH2O2 oxyhydrides with good formability (Figure 9A). Among all 17618 electrically neutral configurations, the voting classifier predicts 527 compounds to be meta/stable with a probability larger than 50%. We further performed DFT calculations on those 527 shortlisted materials to determine their thermodynamic stabilities, yielding 110 formable compounds with \u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/atom. The simple transfer learning not only accelerates the discovery of stable mixed oxyhydrides, but provides the valid database of the A-mixed oxyhydrides with a reasonable number of stable-labeled compounds for the further ML. Then, a new voting classifier was trained based on those calculated mixed ones to learn the stability rules of the A-mixed oxyhydrides.

The new model was used to screen the unstable-labeled materials identified by the initial ML model to retrieve possibly formable compounds for further DFT calculations.\nAfter the two-round ML and DFT screening, 114 A-mixed oxyhydrides are finally found to have \u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/atom with a high likelihood of synthesizability (Figure 9A and Table S9). All experimentally synthesized materials (i.e., LnSrLiH2O2, Ln = La, Nd, Pr, Sm, Gd) (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Matsui et al., 2020) were recognized as formable materials, validating our computation scheme. In addition, the occurrence of new cations (e.g., Zr4+, Ce4+ at A sites) in the A-mixed oxyhydrides highlights the compositional tunability in mixed compounds (Table S9).\nSince ionic conductivity is a key parameter for energy storage materials, we performed AIMD simulations in five randomly selected A-mixed compounds to study their H\u2212 diffusivities (Table 4 and Figure S7). Four out of five compounds were predicted to exhibit the facile H\u2212 diffusion with \u03c3\u0397\u2212 larger than 0.1 mS/cm at 573 K, except for the \u03c3\u0397\u2212 of KCeMgH2O2 merely smaller as 0.07 mS/cm. High H\u2212 conductivities in those materials demonstrate the potential of the K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides for a wide range of energy conversion applications, e.g., hydride conductors and fuel cells. Since a library of promising oxyhydrides explored by our data-driven tools constitutes a valuable resource for further discovery, we look forward to a comprehensive investigation on properties of the oxyhydrides to explore their multifunctionality."

            "text": "Despite of the emerging functionality, the stringent experimental condition causes the oxyhydrides relatively undiscovered, with up to 20 compounds realized in laboratory. Using HT-DFT computations and ML algorithms, we constructed a large stability map of A2BH1+xO3-x oxyhydrides. Besides all synthesized compounds identified by our calculations, 185 new compositions with good intrinsic thermodynamic stabilities were discovered to expand the\nchemical space of the oxyhydrides by ten times. Our prediction of novel oxyhydrides provides a guidance for experimental synthesis, which serves as a first step awaiting future researches that detail their properties.\nBased on the established database, underlying features dominating the oxyhydrides stabilities and their physical origin were revealed via informatic tools. Since the meta/stable K2NiF4-type oxyhydrides exhibit a similar range of tbv as 0.8\u20131.2 with that in perovskite oxides (Li et al., 2013; Emery et al., 2016), we speculate the similar constraint of tbv in other stable mixed-anion systems sharing perovskite-related frameworks, such as oxynitrides and oxyfluorides (e.g., ABNxO3-x and A2BF1+xO3-x) (Li et al., 2013). The criterion of tolerance factor from our analysis can serve as a screening threshold to promote the discovery of other mixed-anion materials from geometric aspect.\nIn addition to the structural distortion, the bonding between cations and anions plays a crucial role in stabilizing mixed-anion materials. While the upper limit of electronegativities for cationic elements is determined by the anion with a smaller electronegativity in the mixed-anion compounds, the extremely reducing nature of H\u2212 further demands a highly electropositive cation to contribute electron density, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals. The trend of cationic electronegativity to stabilize materials may remain valid in other mixed-anion systems due to the similar bonding environment. Taking oxynitrides and oxyfluorides as an example, their requirements of cations in electropositive aspect is more tolerant than that of the oxyhydrides due to their electronegative anions (i.e., N3- and F\u2212). Such trend is proved by many compounds (e.g., PbReNO2, AgCuF2O, TlBiF2O) (Wang et al., 2021) containing less electropositive ions realized in experiments. Thus, the rarity of the A2BH1+xO3-x oxyhydrides can be attributed to the stringent constraint of cations with far small electronegativity ascribed to the reducing nature of hydride ions.\nIn order to evaluate the necessity of using the complex voting classifier, we also utilized the widely-used random forest method to search the stable A-mixed oxyhydrides following the two-step ML workflow (Table 5, Table S10 and Figure S8). While the training time of random forest is shorter than of the voting classifier, the hitting rate of the random forest (109/917) is smaller than that of the voting classifier (114/620), leading to calculating additional"

The higher precision of the voting classifier may originate from its better performance (e.g., higher f1 score) to identify stable compounds than that of the random forest (Table 3, 5 and Figure S9). Given the computation time of a A-mixed compound by DFT as ~ 5 hours, calculating 300 more compounds would consume thousands of hours, which is far longer than the difference between the twomodels\u2019 training time. Thus, it is reasonable to use the voting classifier with the best performance in all classifiers for screeningwith an acceptable cost. In order to use the ML model trained by the unmixed compounds to screen the mixed compounds, we keep the feature dimension of the mixed compounds as same as the unmixed ones by designating the A-site properties as the arithmetic averages of the mixed ions. Such approximation of the properties for the mixed components is widely used inmultiple ML studies (Bartel et al., 2019; Chenebuah et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022).While theML algorithm is challenged to learn the complicated effect of the cation mixing on materials\u2019 stabilities (e.g., site miscibility) by averaging site properties (Ouyang et al., 2021) and including those effects by further feature engineering may improve its performance (Talapatra et al., 2021), the ML model still shortlists candidate compounds containing all known materials from thousands of possible configurations, and increases the success rate of finding the formable A-mixed oxyhydrides from ~0.5% (114/17618) of the random guess to ~20% (114/620). Thus, estimating the siterelated properties of the mixed component by their average is viable in our study.\nIn addition to the oxyhydrides chemistry explored by the informatics, we propose a simple and effective computational workflow targeting the discovery of mixed compounds with huge quantity. Unlike many applications of ML to identify stable materials such as single or double perovskites, a roadblock of our task to identify mixed oxyhydrides mainly lie on two aspects, i.e., the lack of detected database and the rarity of stable oxyhydrides. Even though the HT-DFT methods used to deal with unmixed compounds can generate the small size dataset of the mixed materials by randomly selecting materials, the paucity of stable ones (<5%) can lead to the highly unbalanced data distribution and disable the validity of the database. To handle the issue of insufficient labeled data and unbalanced data\ndistribution, we demonstrate a simple two-step ML and HTDFT paradigm to identify stable mixed oxyhydrides. The firstround selection based on the ML model transferred from the unmixed ones can provide the valid database of the A-mixed oxyhydrides with a reasonable number of stable labeled compounds. Then, the validated model (f1 score as 0.80) retrained from the mixed materials database can minimize the misclassification of the previous screening. Our workflow demonstrates its efficiency by successfully identifying hundreds of stable mixed oxyhydrides with reasonable cost, which includes all experimentally synthesized materials. In addition to the specific scenario demonstrated in our research, our method consisting of a simple transfer leaning can be applied to many materials design applications, where a large volumes data is unavailable and the data distribution is highly unbalanced."

The large stability map of the A2BH1+xO3-x (x = 0, 1, 2) oxyhydrides was constructed by the HT-DFT calculations covering 1856 charge-neutral compositions, with only 5% of the total compounds exhibiting \u0394Ehull \u2264 100 meV/atom. In addition to all laboratory synthesized compounds, our works identified new 76 compositions with good intrinsic thermodynamic stabilities to guide the experimental synthesis. Geometric factors standing for structural distortion and electronegativities accounting for the charge transfer in hydride bonding were unveiled to dominate the oxyhydrides stabilities, and to explain the scarcity of the materials. In addition to the unmixed compounds, we demonstrated an efficient two-step ML workflow consisting of a simple transfer learning to survey the cation-mixed compounds. 114 meta/stable A-mixed oxyhydrides were identified out of total 17618 possible configurations. Facile H\u2212 diffusion in the selected compounds indicates the suitability of the oxyhydrides as energy storage and conversion materials. Our study facilitates the discovery of the oxyhydrides, and formulates the computational paradigm for the exploration of other uninvestigated compositional spaces.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org14"
