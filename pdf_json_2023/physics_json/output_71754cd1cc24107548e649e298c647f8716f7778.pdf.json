    "abstractText": "The present study was aimed at the synthesis and evaluation of a new series of benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine having a methylsulfonyl group as COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitor pharmacophore. Molecular modeling studies were performed using the Autodock program, and the results demonstrated that methylsulfonyl pharmacophore was adequately placed into the COX-2 active site. The in vitro and in vivo COX-2 inhibitory effects were also evaluated. In the in vitro assay, all newly synthesized compounds showed moderate to good selectivity for the inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. However, compound 2-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-4-phenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine (5a) showed the highest COX-2 inhibitory effect (IC50: 0.05 \u03bcM) even more than celecoxib as the reference drug (IC50: 0.06 \u03bcM). For the in vivo study, the writing reflex test was used, and the results indicated that all synthesized compounds had well dose-dependent anti-nociceptive activity. The in vivo evaluation also showed that compound 2-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(p-tolyl)benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2a]pyrimidine (5d) had the highest activity in the writing reflex test (ED50: 5.75 mg/kg). In addition, the cytotoxicity effects of the synthesized compounds were tested on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and all compounds showed considerable inhibitory results.",

The pain and tissue blood flow principally increase in the presence of\nPGs, especially PGE2 [1]. PGs are biosynthesized by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, so COX enzyme inhibitors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease inflammation. The COX isoforms that have been discovered are COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 [2]. COX-1 and COX-2 are more important than COX-3, and NSAIDs effects are attributed to the inhibition of these isoforms [3]. The COX-1 isoform has a constitutive role and expresses PGs responsible for maintaining physiological functions such as gastric mucosa protection and vascular homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 is an inducible enzyme and over-expressed in response to the release of several pro-inflammatory mediators. The COX-2 isoform is over-expressing in the inflammatory sites and introduces the PGs produced in pathologic conditions [4]. However, NSAIDs as anti-inflammatory drugs not only inhibit COX-2 but also these drugs inhibit COX-1 isoform and cause many side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems associated with the inhibition of COX-1 as a protector of the gastric mucosa. To prevent the side effects * Afshin Zarghi zarghi@sbmu.ac.ir 1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran 2 Department of Food Technology Research, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran 3 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran 4 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n12 34\n56 78\n90 () ;,: 12 34 56 78 90 (); ,:\nof NSAIDs, the difference between COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms should be identified to design the compounds with high selectivity for inhibition COX-2 enzyme [5, 6]. In general, the active site of these isoforms are very similar, but the significant difference between these isoforms is a second pocket in the binding site of the COX-2 isoform due to the replacement of the bulk isoluesin523 amino acid in COX-1 by valine at the binding site of COX-2. So, the large compounds place properly into the COX-2 active site while they do not in the COX-1 active site [7]. Therefore, compounds can be designed that are more desirable to COX-2 than COX-1 and do not show the side effects of this isoform inhibition. The COX2 role is investigated in diverse diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [8\u201310], several types of cancer [11\u201315], and Parkinson\u2019s disease [16]. Also, the upregulation of COX-2 in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been studied [17]. Some wellknown COX-2 inhibitors, like Rofecoxib, have been withdrawn from the market due to cardiovascular effects [18]. Therefore, the introduction of new COX-2 inhibitors with high potency and low side effects is desirable. Diarylheterocycles are abundantly present in the structure of selective COX-2 inhibitors. The hetero or carbocyclic ring systems or acylic structures constitute the central core of this group and consist of two aryl substitutions. One of the two phenyl rings carries a pharmacophore group that replaces the secondary hydrophobic pocket at the COX-2 active site and is responsible for selectivity. According to recent studies, the COX-2 inhibitors with tricyclic rings as central skeletons are introduced [19\u201321]. Benzimidazole rings have been appeared as the prominent scaffold in medicinal chemistry and also used as the central core in COX-2 inhibitors [22\u201328]. Our previous work introduced a new potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors class with tricyclic benzimidazole central core (A, Fig. 1) [21]. In this regard, we designed a new series of imidazo[1,2-a] pyrimidine compounds with a tricyclic central core. To design these compounds, we hybrid molecules comprising benzimidazole and pyrimidine ring as new COX-2 inhibitors. Pyrimidine rings are interesting structures widely used in the design of COX-2 inhibitors and have been shown anti-cancer effects (B, Fig. 1) [29\u201334]. Based upon this, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of novel 2,4-diphenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives with high potency and selectivity. The newly synthesized compounds were employed to assess their ability to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Also, the anti-cancer effects of these series were assayed on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. In addition, an in vivo assay of these compounds has also been performed and showed promising results."

Accordingly, the synthesis of this series was carried out by reaction of two main precursors: substituted chalcones and 2-aminobenzimidazole. To synthesize related chalcones, at first, 4\u2019-(methylsulfonyl) acetophenone (1) was synthesized from thioanisole as starting substance in two steps reaction as explained in our previous work [35]. Accordingly, first 4\u2019-(methylthio)acetophenone was obtained from the reaction of thioanisole with acetyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3 and acetyl chloride in chloroform at room temperature. Then, oxidation step was performed in THF/water as the solvent, and 4\u2019-(methylsulfonyl)acetophenone was produced using Oxone reagent. The 4\u2019-(methylsulfonyl)acetophenone was treated with different aldehyde derivatives at room temperature in an alcoholic NaOH solution to give desired chalcones (3) [36]. Finally, 2-aminobenzimidazole (4) reacted with substituted chalcones (3) in DMF as solvent under microwave irradiation and the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine to produce 2,4-diphenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2a]pyrimidine derivatives [37] (5a-o)."

This study shows the interaction of compounds and active site, and partly explains the reasons for the existence of different derivatives in potency and selectivity. Generally, the SO2Me group of all derivatives was inserted in the secondary pocket of the COX-2 enzyme that is responsible for the selectivity. Also, the superimposition of compound 5a with celecoxib confirmed the correct\nplacement of the pharmacophore group in this hydrophobic pocket. The oxygen atoms of the SO2Me group in compound 5a have formed hydrogen bonds with NH of His-90 (distance: 2.30 \u00c5) and NH of Arg-513 (distance: 5.53 \u00c5).

COX-2 inhibition assay was performed accordingly to our previously reported method using a fluorescent enzyme kit (Table 1) [38]. The COX-2 inhibition results indicated that compound 5a had the highest potency, even more than celecoxib as a known drug, and also showed the highest selectivity among all compounds. These results demonstrated that the presence of any substitution, especially on the para- and meta- position of the C-1 phenyl ring, reduces the efficiency and selectivity of COX-2 inhibitory activity. This effect may be attributed to the presence of steric hindrance around these positions. According to these results, compounds with ortho- methoxy or fluoro substituents showed considerable in vitro activities, apparently due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the COX-2 active site. The higher potency and selectivity of compound 5e compared with compound 5j may be explained by the presence of a hydrogen acceptor area at this position."

The biological evaluation results, including COX-2 inhibition activities, in vivo anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, indicated that the majority of the synthesized compounds had selectivity for COX-2 inhibitory activity and demonstrated considerable anti-proliferative activities against the MCF-7 cell line. These results indicated that 2,4-diphenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine possessing SO2Me pharmacophore group is a suitable structure having a tricyclic central core for designing new selective COX-2 inhibitors."

The MicroSYNTH (Milestone company) was used for the synthesis of final derivatives. Through Thomas\u2013Hoover capillary instrument, melting points were\nmeasured. Using a Perkin Elmer Model 1420 spectrometer on the \u028bmax (cm\u22121) scale, all IR spectra were recorded in a KBr disk. All the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker FT-500 MHz instrument (Bruker Biosciences, USA) with internal reference trimethylsilane (TMS). High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a 6410 Agilent LC-MS triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-MS) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. The absorbance was determined using a spectrophotometer ELISA reader (Infinite\u00ae M200, TECAN Austria GmbH, Grodig, Austria).\nGeneral procedure for the synthesis of chalcones (3)\nThe synthesis of target compounds begins with the production of substituted chalcone. Synthesis of related chalcones was accomplished by the treatment of 4\u2019- (methylsulfonyl)acetophenone 1 (1 mmol) with aryl aldehyde 2 (1 mmol) and 10 wt % sodium hydroxide solution (3 mL) in ethanol; and for 30 min, continue stirring at room temperature. With TLC, the completion progress of the reaction was monitored, and after finishing starting substances, the precipitates were filtered and rinsed with cold ethanol; finally, the pure products were obtained.\nGeneral synthesis procedure of 2,4- diphenylbenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives (5a-o)\n2-Aminobenzimidazole (1.5 mmol) was added to DMF (3 ml) as a solvent, and then a catalytic amount of piperidine (10% mmol) was added to this mixture. Then, substituted chalcone was added (1 mmol), and the reaction was accomplished under microwave irradiation at power 450W for 10 min. For the purity process, methanol (2 ml) was added to the mixture, and after 10 min, the precipitate was filtered and washed with cold methanol. The product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with dichloromethane:methanol (respectively 8:1).\n2-(4-(Methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-phenylbenzo[4,5] imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine (5a)\nYellow solid, 80%; M.

To prepare the enzyme for ducking, the SC-588 molecule as internal ligand and water molecules were first removed from this protein. The next steps were adding Kollman charges and, in the following, merging non-polar hydrogens. Finally, AutoDock 4 was used to gain the PDBQT format of the enzyme. To achieve the conformation with minimized energy, HyperChem 8.0 program through the MM+method was used, and then with AutoDock tools, the PDBQT format of ligands was obtained. A grid box with dimensions 40*40*40 around the active site of protein was built. Docking run was put to 100, and the Lamarckian genetic search algorithm was used. For more efficiency, the ligandsenzyme interactions with distances greater than 7.0 \u00c5 were removed. At last, for each compound, the structure with lower energy was chosen as the best conformation [41, 42]."

This assay is based on the generation of resorufin as a fluorescent compound in the reaction PGG2 with ADHP (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine). High potency compounds are determined due to the less intensity of fluorescence arising from resorufin [43]."

This experiment, based on a protocol approved by the \u201cAnimal Experimentation Ethics Committee\u201d of the University of Shahid Beheshti Medical Sciences, was performed, and each animal only once was used. For investigation of the nociceptive responses in mice, the acetic acid-induced writhing test was used. Thirty minutes after administration of different doses of the novel compounds, an acetic acid solution of 1% to each animal was injected to cause abdominal constriction, a typical writhing response, and used celecoxib and vehicle as a positive and negative control, respectively. The number of writhing responses during a 30 min period by observation was counted. The mean \u00b1 SEM of eight mice for each group was represented. The estimated ED50 values were calculated with a 95% confidence interval by using Graph Pad Prism software by nonlinear regression analysis of the log dose-response curve."
