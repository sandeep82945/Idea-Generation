    "abstractText": "The Noether symmetry analysis is applied for the study of a multifield cosmological model in a spatially flat FLRW background geometry. The gravitational Action Integral consists of two scalar fields, the Brans\u2013Dicke field and a second scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. However, the two scalar fields interact in kinetic terms. This multifield has been found to describe the equivalent of hyperbolic inflation in the Jordan frame. The application of Noether\u2019s theorems constrains the free parameters of the model so that conservation laws exist. We find that the field equations form an integrable dynamical system, and the analytic solution is derived.",

            "text": "Scalar fields play an important role in the description of cosmological evolution [1]. With the introduction of scalar fields in the Einstein\u2013Hilbert Action, the new degrees of freedom drive the dynamics of the cosmological parameters such that they explain the cosmological observations [2,3]. The quintessence scalar field model is a very simple model that describes the so-called dark energy and is responsible for the late-time acceleration phase of the universe [4,5]. On the one hand, inflation [6] has been proposed to solve the flatness, the horizon and the isotropization problems. Inflation describes a very rapid acceleration phase during the early stage of the universe, and it is attributed to the inflation field [7\u20139]. There are a plethora of proposed scalar field models in the literature; see, for instance [10\u201317], and references therein. In the middle of the previous century, Brans and Dicke [18] proposed a gravitational model with a scalar field that satisfies Mach\u2019s principle. Indeed, the existence of the scalar field is essential for the physical space, and the scalar field interacts with the gravity in the Action Integral; that is, the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to gravity. Generalizations of the Brans\u2013Dicke model are known as scalar-tensor theories [19]. In [20], Hordenski derived the most general Action Integral for the scalar-tensor theory. The Brans\u2013Dicke theory is defined on the Jordan frame [21], while the gravitational model depends upon a free parameter known as the Brans\u2013Dicke parameter. The Brans\u2013Dicke model has been used as a model for the description of dark energy [22] and the inflationary epoch [23\u201325]. A two-scalar field model that has drawn the attention of cosmologists in recent years is the Chiral model [26\u201328]. In the Chiral model, the two scalar fields are minimally coupled to gravity; that is, they are defined in the Jordan frame. However, the two scalar field interact in the kinetic term. Specifically, from the kinetic components of the scalar fields, we can define a second-rank tensor, which for the Chiral model is a two-dimensional hyperbolic sphere. Thus, there is no \u201ccoordinate\u201d system where there is no interaction between the two fields. This is in contrast to the quintom model in which the kinetic components define the two-dimensional flat space [29]. This specific two-scalar field model has been widely studied in the literature [30\u201333], and various extensions for which the scalar fields may have negative energy density have been proposed before [34,35].\nUniverse 2022, 8, 325. https://doi.org/10.3390/universe8060325 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe\nFor a specific potential function, the Chiral model provides a very interesting scaling solution in which the two scalar fields contribute to the cosmological fluid [36,37]. The scaling solution describes acceleration, and the solution is described as hyperbolic inflation or hyperinflation. Because of the existence of the second scalar field in the hyperinflation, the curvature perturbations depend upon the number of e-folds [38], while the initial conditions at the start and at the end of the inflation can be different [38], and the non-Gaussianities in the power spectrum are supported by this model [39]. Recently, in [40], a multiscalar field model was proposed consisting of two-scalar fields, the Brans\u2013Dicke field and a second field, which is coupled to the Brans\u2013Dicke field in kinetic terms, but it is minimally coupled to gravity. The latter model is defined in the Jordan frame. However, under a conformal map, the equivalent Action Integral in the Einstein frame is that of the Chiral theory. The extended Brans\u2013Dicke theory admits an asymptotic scaling solution, which has similar dynamical properties to the hyperbolic inflationary solution for the Chiral model. Indeed, the asymptotic solution describes inflation, in which the two scalar fields contribute to the cosmological solution, while this specific solution corresponds to a spiral attractor. This dynamical property remains invariant for the two models under the conformal transformation, which relates the two theories. In this study, we investigate the conservation laws and the integrability properties of the hyperbolic inflationary model in the Jordan frame. For the purposes of this study, we make use of the property that the gravitational field equations admit a minisuperspace description so that the Noether symmetry analysis [41] can be applied. Noether\u2019s theorems provide a systematic approach for the determination of infinitesimal transformations, which leave the variational principle invariant. Moreover, the generators of the infinitesimal invariant transformations can be used in a simple way to construct conservation laws. Because of the simplicity of the applications of Noether\u2019s theorems and of the importance of the given results, Noether symmetries have been the subject of study in various gravitational systems [42\u201346]. The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the cosmological model of our consideration, and we derive the minisuperspace and the point-like Lagrangian which describes the field equations. The basic properties and definitions for the theories of point transformations are given in Section 3. Moreover, we find the Noether symmetries, and we construct the corresponding conservation laws for the field equations. In Section 4, we determine the analytic solution for the cosmological model of our analysis. We define canonical variables and derive the analytic solution. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our results."

Consequently, according to Liouville\u2019s theorem, the field equations of this two-dimensional system are integrable. Specifically, because they admit additional conservation laws, they are super-integrable [47]. For these two cases, we proceed with the derivation of the analytic solutions."

(44) For H0 = 0, it is easy to observe that the de Sitter Universe,\nln a(t) = \u2213 \u221a 1 + V0(1 + \u03c9BD)\u221a (3 + 2\u03c9BD)(4 + 3\u03c9BD) t , (45)\nis recovered. However, for H0 6= 0 and for large values of t, the de Sitter universe is the asymptotic solution.\nIn general, for \u03a61\u03a62 6= 0, the Hubble function is derived to be\nH(t) = \u221a 1 + V0\u221a (3 + 2\u03c9BD)(4 + 3\u03c9BD) 1 (\u03a61e2\u2126t + \u03a62) + H0 \u03a61e2\u2126t + \u03a62 exp(\u2126t). (46)\nEasily, we observe that the we f f (t) for the latter solution for large values of t asymptotically reaches the value we f f (t) \u2192 \u22121; thus, the de Sitter Universe is an asymptotic solution for the dynamical system.\n4.2. Model B\nFor the second model of our analysis, that is, for (\u03ba, \u03bb) = (\u03ba, 2\u03ba), \u03ba = \u221a\n3(3+2\u03c9BD) 2 + 3 4 ,\nthe normal coordinates are (a, \u039e, \u03c8), in which\n\u039e = \u03c6a 6\u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD)+3 . (47)\nIn the new variables, the point-like Lagrangian is\nL ( a, a\u0307, \u039e, \u039e\u0307, \u03c8, \u03c8\u0307 ) = a 2\u2212 6 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) (\u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD)a\u0307\u039e\u0307\u2212\n\u03c9BD 2 a \u039e\n\u039e\u03072 )\n\u2212 1 2\nF20 \u039e 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) 2 \u03c8\u03072 + V0\u039e 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) 2 . (48)\nHence, the field equations are\na 2\u2212 6 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) (\u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD)a\u0307\u039e\u0307\u2212\n\u03c9BD 2 a \u039e\n\u039e\u03072 ) \u2212 1\n2 F20 \u039e\n3+ \u221a\n3(3+2\u03c9BD) 2 \u03c8\u03072 + V0\u039e\n3+ \u221a\n3(3+2\u03c9BD) 2 = 0, (49)\n\u039e\u0308 =\n\u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD)\u2212 3 + \u03c9BD (\u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD)\u2212 2 ) 2(3 + 2\u03c9BD) \u039e\u03072 \u039e , (50)\na\u0308 = V0( \u221a 3+ \u221a\n3+2\u03c9BD)\u221a 3+2\u03c9BD\na \u22122+ 6 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) \u039e 1+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) 2 \u2212 2 \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD)\n3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) a\u03072 a\n\u2212 27 (\u221a (3+2\u03c9BD)\u2212 \u221a 3+\u03c9BD (\u221a 3(33+\u03c9BD)+18 \u221a (3+2\u03c9BD) ))\n(3+2\u03c9BD) 3 2 ( 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) ) a\u0307 \u039e\u0307\u039e\n+ \u03c9BD\n(\u221a 3(3+\u03c9BD)+ \u221a (3+2\u03c9BD) ) 4(3+2\u03c9BD) 3 2 a ( \u039e\u0307 \u039e )2 .\n(51)\nFrom the second-order differential Equation (50), we derive the conservation law\n\u039e\n\u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD)\u22123+\u03c9BD (\u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD)\u22122 ) 2(3+2\u03c9BD) \u039e\u0307 = I\u03031 (52)\nwhich is a Noetherian conservation law related to the vector field X\u03043, that is, I\u03031 ' I(X\u03043) . Thus, for the scalar field \u039e, it follows that the closed-form solution is given by\n\u039e(t) = \u039e0\n( 3 + \u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD) + \u03c9BD ( 2 + \u221a (3 + 2\u03c9BD) ) t ) 2(3+2\u03c9BD) 3+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD)+\u03c9BD ( 2+ \u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD) ) . (53)\nFinally, for the scalar factor, we determine the exact solution\na(t) = t 5+4\u03c9BD+\n\u221a 3(3+2\u03c9BD)\n(4+3\u03c9BD) .

(55) Consequently, the Hubble function and the effective equation of state parameter\nare derived\nH(t) = 5 + 4\u03c9BD +\n\u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD)\n(4 + 3\u03c9BD) 1 t , (56)\nwe f f (t) = \u22121 + 22(4 + 3\u03c9BD) 3 ( 5 + 4\u03c9BD + \u221a 3(3 + 2\u03c9BD) ) . (57)\nTherefore, the exact solution describes an accelerated Universe when\n\u2212 1 16\n(\u221a 33 + 17 ) < \u03c9BD <\n6 841\n(\u221a 22\u2212 188 ) . (58)"

            "text": "The Noether symmetry analysis is a powerful method for the study of nonlinear dynamical systems with a variational principle. The symmetry analysis has been widely applied in gravitational systems for the construction of conservation laws and the study of various cosmological models. In this study, we applied the Noether symmetry analysis in order to study the nonlinear field equations for a two-scalar field cosmological model in a spatially flat FLRW geometry. The gravitational theory is defined in the Jordan frame, where one of the scalar fields is the Brans\u2013Dicke field, and the second scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity but non-minimally to the Brans\u2013Dicke field. This specific model has been proposed before as the analog in the Jordan frame for the Chiral model, which generates the hyperinflation. The cosmological model possesses three arbitrary parameters, namely the (\u03c9BD, \u03ba, \u03bb). From the application of Noether\u2019s theorem, it was found that for specific sets of the variables (\u03ba(\u03c9BD), \u03bb(\u03c9BD)), the field equations admit additional conservation laws such that the field equations constitute a super-integrable dynamical system. For these cases, with the use of the normal coordinates, we were able to simplify the field equations and write the closed-form and exact solutions. The analysis of the solutions gives constraints for the free parameter, \u03c9BD, such that the hyperbolic inflationary solution is recovered. In future work, we plan to investigate further these super-integrable models, and in particular, we plan to solve the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation of quantum cosmology and compare the semiclassical limit in the Jordan and Einstein frames.\nFunding: AP was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Numbers 131604).\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nConflicts of Interest: The author declare no conflict of interest."
