1. **Investigate the effect of different metal oxides on the performance of PANI-based electrochemical sensors.** The present study focused on CeO2 and WO3, but other metal oxides, such as TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3, could also be used to create nanocomposites with PANI. It would be interesting to see how the different metal oxides affect the sensitivity, linearity, and stability of the sensors.


2. **Explore the use of PANI-based nanocomposites in other types of electrochemical sensors.** The present study focused on pH sensors, but PANI-based nanocomposites could also be used in sensors for other analytes, such as heavy metals, organic pollutants, and biomolecules. It would be interesting to see how the nanocomposites perform in these different applications.


3. **Investigate the use of PANI-based nanocomposites in other types of sensing platforms.** The present study used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy as the sensing platforms. However, PANI-based nanocomposites could also be used in other sensing platforms, such as optical sensors, gravimetric sensors, and calorimetric sensors. It would be interesting to see how the nanocomposites perform in these different platforms.


4. **Develop theoretical models to explain the sensing mechanism of PANI-based nanocomposites.** The present study provided some insights into the sensing mechanism of PANI-based nanocomposites, but a more detailed understanding is needed. Theoretical models could be developed to help explain the relationship between the structure and properties of the nanocomposites and their sensing performance.


5. **Investigate the long-term stability and reliability of PANI-based nanocomposites in sensing applications.** The present study did not investigate the long-term stability and reliability of PANI-based nanocomposites. This is an important consideration for any sensor, as it needs to be able to perform reliably over a long period of time. Studies could be conducted to evaluate the stability of the nanocomposites under different environmental conditions and over extended periods of time.
