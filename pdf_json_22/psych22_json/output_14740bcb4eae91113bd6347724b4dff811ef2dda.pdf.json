The present study aimed at assessing the effects of psychoeducational lecture and group intervention on self-esteem and self-acceptance in Chinese college students.\nMethods: A total of 149 Chinese college students who participated in a mental health course were randomly class-based assigned into the psychoeducational lecture group (n = 62) and the self-focused intervention group (n = 87). The lecture group received 6-session psychoeducational lectures on overview of mental health, campus adaptation, stress adjustment, self-understanding, emotion management, and interpersonal relationships. The self-focused intervention group was treated with self-related group activities involving aspects of self-knowledge, self-feeling, and self-regulation for six sessions. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were taken with Rosenberg SelfEsteem Scale and Self-Acceptance Questionnaire for both groups.\nResults: Self-esteem significantly increased in both groups after six sessions. However, the enhancement of self-acceptance was more robust for the self-focused intervention group than the psychoeducational lecture group.\nConclusion: The psychoeducational lecture and self-focused intervention were effective approaches to improve self-esteem for Chinese college students. With respect to selfacceptance, self-focused group intervention might have a more prominent effect.\nKeywords: mental health, psychoeducation, self-esteem, self-acceptance, group intervention\nINTRODUCTION\nThe college years represent a developmentally challenging transition to adulthood, during which college students are exposed to stress due to both developmental period and academic environment. Mental health has a significant influence on academic success, productivity, and social relationships in this period (Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010), because most lifetime mental disorders have the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 877737\nfirst onset by age 24 years (Kessler et\u00a0 al., 2005). The college mental health service should combine psychiatry, primary care, health promotion, and counseling so as to provide unique opportunities for interventions in transition-age youth that affect the life course and impact of mental illness (Downs et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nThe Influence of Self-Esteem and Self-Acceptance on Mental Health Self-concept could be\u00a0 treated as an entry point for mental health promotion in college. Numerous researches show a positive, stable, and healthy self-concept to be\u00a0 one of the major indicators of the development of mental health (Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, 1990; Pillow et\u00a0al., 1991; R\u00e4ty et\u00a0al., 2005; Grum, 2006; Ybrandt, 2008; Van Dijk et\u00a0al., 2014; Busch et\u00a0 al., 2021). As the evaluative and affective dimension of the self-concept (Harter, 1999), the role of self-esteem in mental health was also been evidenced. Selfesteem refers to a person\u2019s global appraisal of his/her positive or negative value, based on the scores a person gives him/ herself in different roles and domains of life (Markus and Nurius, 1986; Mann et\u00a0 al., 2004). The vulnerability model states that low self-esteem is a risk factor for depression (Orth et\u00a0 al., 2016; Sakellari et\u00a0 al., 2020). Low self-esteem was also linked with anxiety (Du et\u00a0 al., 2013; Sowislo and Orth, 2013; Sakellari et\u00a0 al., 2020), dejection (Zeigler-Hill and Wallace, 2012), loneliness (Creemers et\u00a0 al., 2013; Vanhalst et\u00a0 al., 2013) and presence of psychological distress (Becerra et\u00a0 al., 2021), while high self-esteem was associated with life satisfaction (Halvorsen and Heyerdahl, 2006; Joshanloo and Afshari, 2011; Coffey and Warren, 2020) and subjective wellbeing (Karatzias et\u00a0 al., 2006; Yamaguchi et\u00a0 al., 2017; Yang et\u00a0 al., 2019). Self-esteem might be\u00a0 protective against psychosomatic symptoms for adolescents (ages 14\u201319 years; Piko et\u00a0 al., 2016).\nSelf-acceptance was the basis of self-esteem (Nathaniel, 1998), which was integrated into the multidimensional model of selfconcept (Purdie and McCrindle, 2004) and was adopted to measure the level of self-concept (Green et\u00a0 al., 1994). Selfacceptance refers to people taking a positive attitude toward themselves and all their characteristics and reflects the degree of individual acceptance of oneself (Cai et\u00a0 al., 2021). Selfacceptance is crucial to mental health (Carson and Langer, 2006). Psychological well-being theory pointed out that selfacceptance was a central characteristic of positive psychological functioning and an indicator of individual psychological wellbeing (Ryff and Singer, 1996). A higher level of self-acceptance was associated with a lower level of anxiety, depression, negative affect, and psychological distress (Xu et\u00a0 al., 2016; Jibeen, 2017; Popov, 2019). A 20-year prospective cohort study found that self-acceptance decreased mortality risk by 19% and added 3 years of life even after controlling for other psychological components and potential confounders, suggesting the influence of self-acceptance on physical health as well as mental health (Ng et\u00a0 al., 2020). Hence, self-acceptance played a protective role in overall health development (Popov, 2019).\nThe Intervention to Improve Self-Esteem and Self-Acceptance Researchers conducted intervention studies to improve selfesteem and self-acceptance on account of their importance on mental health. High school students significantly enhanced self-esteem after entering a school-based social cognitive training group than their counterparts participating in a training group in a lecture format (Barrett et\u00a0 al., 1999). A four-lesson selfesteem enhancement program in school improved the self-esteem level of children in fifth and sixth grade children (Dalgas-Pelish, 2006). Researchers found that art therapy groups were effective strategies to raise the self-esteem of female juvenile offenders (Hartz and Thick, 2005). A cognitive-behavioral training program resulted in significant and long-lasting improvements in employees\u2019 self-esteem (Proudfoot et\u00a0 al., 2009). The studies on college students found similar effects. College students improved self-esteem after the resistance exercise program (Moore et\u00a0 al., 2011), an online self-esteem and awareness training program (Sungur, 2015), and an esteem development program including practices based on music therapy, poetry therapy, and creative drama method (Y\u00fccesan and \u015eendurur, 2018).\nWith respect to self-acceptance intervention, many studies focused on special cohorts. For example, a self-acceptance group therapy based on cognitive-behavioral framework ameliorated self-acceptance, quality of life, and relevant psychological problems (e.g., depression, social anxiety) of outpatients (Schoenleber and Gratz, 2018). Forgiveness therapy increased the self-acceptance of Indonesian adult inmates (Praptomojati and Subandi, 2020). The intervention had positive effects on participants with psychological problems and even severe psychiatric conditions. For instance, the mindfulnessbased stress reduction program increased the highly sensitive participants\u2019 scores of self-acceptance, mindfulness, and emotional empathy (Soons et\u00a0 al., 2010). On completion of a positive psychology group therapy, participants with severe psychiatric conditions reported a significant improvement in self-acceptance and significant decreases in interpersonal sensitivity and depression (Valiente et\u00a0al., 2021). Following an online intervention program, participants with elevated levels of perfectionism increased self-acceptance (Tulbure et\u00a0al., 2021). However, there were few studies to explore the self-acceptance intervention effect on healthy college students.\nResearchers indicated that making liberal use of psychoeducation was one of the effective strategies to reach the goal of student-centered mental health care in college setting (Downs et\u00a0al., 2018). Psychoeducation could help students in less clinical distress to increase their awareness and information about mental health problems (Li et\u00a0 al., 2014). A brief psychoeducation course significantly improved the self-esteem levels of college students, supporting the opinion that psychoeducation was effective early intervention strategy in college (Cartwright and Hooper, 2017)."

However, with the substantial change of Chinese society in the past decades, self-concept and self-esteem become more and more central to youth\u2019s development of mental health in China. Adolescents in middle school with high self-esteem experienced better mental health (Xu et\u00a0 al., 2020). Self-concept in Chinese college students not only influenced mental health directly, but also affected mental health indirectly through social adaptation (Zhu et\u00a0 al., 2016). Inconsistent with the partial mediating effect found in western and Hong Kong college students, self-concept fully mediating the role of social support on mental health was obtained in Mainland China (Xu et\u00a0 al., 2019). Chinese college students with high self-esteem and high self-concept reported lower interpersonal difficulties (Luo et\u00a0al., 2021). Thus, researchers pointed out that Chinese students should be\u00a0encouraged to evaluate their performance and worth in terms of their levels of mastery of particular tasks rather than relying on external evaluation criteria, such as social comparisons with peers (Zhou et\u00a0 al., 2020). It was accordingly worth enhancing self-esteem and self-acceptance of Chinese college students to prevent mental illness.\nLiu et\u00a0 al. (2017) found that 6.24% of Chinese freshmen on average had at least one positive factor in the measurement of SCL-90 from 2005 to 2011, i.e., might have psychological problems. A recent survey study reported that more than 10% of university students in China suffered from different levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and the mean scores of depression, anxiety, and stress all experienced downward trends during college (Gao et\u00a0 al., 2020). Compared to students in higher grades, freshmen\u2019s mental health should be\u00a0 paid more attention to. The current study therefore particularly focused on freshmen in college and aimed to enhance their self-esteem and self-acceptance. Universities are unique places of learning where the setting has a strong focus on teaching and learning. Intervention in college improved the mental health of students through academic-based strategies (Fernandez et\u00a0 al., 2016). Hence, the current psychoeducational treatments were conducted within a mental health course for freshmen.\nTwo different psychoeducational approaches were adopted. One was a 6-session psychoeducational lecture treatment. Previous studies found lecture-based courses had positive effects on increasing mental health knowledge, hope, psychological quality, and mental health (Becker et\u00a0 al., 2008; Hassed et\u00a0 al., 2009; Shek, 2012). Through brief psychoeducation lectures about depression and knowledge of neuroscience, college students in Taiwan elevated the biological knowledge and reduced the stigma of depression (Han and Chen, 2014). However, the effects of psychoeducational lectures on self-esteem and selfacceptance have not been reported in Chinese college students.\nThe other psychoeducational approach was a 6-session selffocused group intervention. A prior study used group psychoeducation in which stress coping styles are taught to reduce symptoms of stress and manage the symptoms of anxiety and depression levels in Turkish nursing students (G\u00fcnaydin, 2021). A paint therapy group counseling intervention significantly\nimproved self-acceptance level in Chinese college students. The effect was still robust even in the follow-up test conducted 2 months after the intervention (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2021). Nevertheless, will group intervention have similar effects on self-esteem of Chinese college students? It remained unclear.\nIn summary, Chinese freshmen might suffer from different levels of psychological distress. Previous studies revealed that self-esteem and self-acceptance were important indicators of mental health, which could be\u00a0 improved by psychoeducational treatments. Therefore, the current study adopted two psychoeducational approaches to enhance self-esteem and selfacceptance in Chinese college students, and compared the effects of psychoeducational lecture and group intervention."

This finding was consistent with previous studies, which obtained significant enhancement of self-esteem by means of psychoeducational lectures (Cartwright and Hooper, 2017), art therapy (Y\u00fccesan and \u015eendurur, 2018), or online training (Sungur, 2015). In addition, the present study found that the level of self-evaluation dimension of SAQ was also improved regardless of psychoeducational approaches. Self-esteem was regarded as the evaluative dimension of the self-concept and referred to total evaluations towards oneself (Harter, 1999). In the present study, the items in the self-evaluation dimension of SAQ resembled those in SES. For example, \u201cI have many strengths and few faults.\u201d (the second item in SAQ) and \u201cI feel that I\u00a0 have a number of good qualities\u201d (the second item in SES) had similar meanings. The close association between self-evaluation and self-esteem might lead to the same effect pattern.\nThe treatment of psychoeducational lecture played a role in enhancing self-esteem and self-evaluation, which might be\u00a0related to the reduce of stigma. The lectures in the present study delivered information about causes, factors, and coping strategies of psychological distress and mental illness. Han and Chen (2014) indicated that a 30-min neurobiology-based psychoeducational lecture significantly reduced the social distance from depressed individuals. A meta-analysis study\nsupported the positive effects of psychoeducation on reducing stigma for mental illness (Corrigan et\u00a0 al., 2012). Meanwhile, self-stigma of mental illness and self-stigma of seeking psychological help predicted decreased self-esteem (Lannin et\u00a0 al., 2015). It was accordingly speculated that the current psychoeducational lectures might reduce stigma for psychological distress, and further increase self-esteem and self-evaluation of college students.\nConsistent with an online self-esteem and awareness training study (Sungur, 2015), self-focused group intervention in the present study improved self-esteem and self-evaluation of college students. The intervention highlighted the awareness of selfknowledge, self-feeling, and self-regulation. Individuals who were self-aware gained insight into their feelings and thoughts, instead of focusing their attention on their negative aspects, accepted their positive and negative sides. Thus, they were open to criticism and increased their tolerance to adverse experiences (Sungur, 2015). Self-regulation facilitated identity achievement which further increased self-esteem (Hofer et\u00a0 al., 2011). Increasing self-awareness was beneficial to identifying personal preferences, values, and life purpose and creating a realistic appreciation of personal strengths and weaknesses (Hartz and Thick, 2005). Students were encouraged to set realistic goals and take steps to achieve them, and finally improved self-esteem.\nIn comparison with psychoeducational lectures, self-focused group intervention had a more robust effect on the improvement of self-acceptance. There were similarities between self-acceptance and self-esteem, but there were also differences between the two concepts (Macinnes, 2006).\nFIGURE\u00a01 | The intervention effect for total score of SAQ. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 877737\nSelf-acceptance was tapping into a general level of psychological well-being while self-esteem is more associated with the issues surrounding the development and maintenance of depressive thoughts (Macinnes, 2006). Popov (2019) found self-acceptance was a better predictor of mental health than self-esteem. These previous findings suggested self-acceptance influenced mental health in a more fundamental and extensive way. Combined with the results in the present study, it seemed harder to improve self-acceptance than self-esteem. Self-acceptance enhancement might rely more on interpersonal interaction rather than didactic psychoeducation. Interaction experienced within the group helped students to share all their emotions and thoughts freely and confidently. This experience brought along the acquisition of the skill to listen and understand first themselves, then each other without judging (Y\u00fccesan and \u015eendurur, 2018). In-group interaction and sharing processes might set the basis for the development of self-acceptance.\nIn summary, the present study explored the effects of psychoeducational approaches on self-esteem and selfacceptance in college setting. The results manifested both psychoeducational lecture and self-focused group intervention significantly improved self-esteem for Chinese college students. However, self-acceptance increased more obviously after group intervention. The findings might provide insights for mental health promotion for college students. Nonetheless, there were some limitations. Firstly, the two groups were not equivalently matched due to that sample selection was randomly class-based among all the freshmen. Participants\nin IG had higher scores in pre-SES measurement than LG. ANCOVA with the pre-score in SES as covariate showed that IG had significantly higher post-score in SES than LG [F(1,146) = 8.88, p < 0.01, partial \u03b72 = 0.057] after controlling the baseline difference, but the better effect of group intervention on self-esteem should be\u00a0 further examined by strictly matching baselines. Secondly, the current study lacked measurements directly towards mental health, so it was unclear whether the enhancement of self-esteem and selfacceptance could be\u00a0 transferred to general mental health. Thirdly, follow-up measurement was not conducted in months after intervention, so the sustainability of intervention effect remained unclear. Fourthly, the current sample was drawn from one college in China and was insufficient to represent all the Chinese college students. Future studies should recruit larger samples from colleges in different areas and different levels in China to examine the intervention effects. Due to the limitations, caution was needed in drawing conclusions of psychoeducation effects. Further studies were required to confirm the current conclusion by strictly matching participants, enlarging sample size, adding mental health measurements and follow-up tests."
