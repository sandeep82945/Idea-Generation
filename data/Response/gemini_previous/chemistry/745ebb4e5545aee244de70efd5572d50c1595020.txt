1. **Investigate the potential of using lysozyme biopeptides as natural preservatives in food products.** Given the high antibacterial and antioxidative properties of lysozyme biopeptides, they could be explored as potential natural preservatives in food products. Research could focus on determining the optimal concentration of biopeptides needed to inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms and maintain the quality of food products.


2. **Evaluate the efficacy of lysozyme biopeptides in enhancing the bioavailability and stability of bioactive compounds.** Bioactive compounds often have poor bioavailability and stability, limiting their potential health benefits. Research could investigate whether lysozyme biopeptides can improve the bioavailability and stability of bioactive compounds by encapsulating them or forming complexes with them.


3. **Explore the use of lysozyme biopeptides in the development of novel drug delivery systems.** The ability of lysozyme biopeptides to interact with cell membranes and penetrate tissues makes them promising candidates for use in drug delivery systems. Research could focus on designing biopeptide-based nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery, controlled drug release, and improved drug efficacy.


4. **Investigate the potential of lysozyme biopeptides in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.** Lysozyme biopeptides have been shown to possess cell-proliferation and wound-healing properties. Research could explore the use of biopeptides in tissue engineering scaffolds, wound dressings, and other biomedical applications to promote tissue regeneration and repair.


5. **Study the effects of lysozyme biopeptides on the gut microbiome and overall health.** The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health. Research could investigate the impact of lysozyme biopeptides on the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, and assess their potential role in promoting gut health, preventing dysbiosis, and improving overall well-being.
