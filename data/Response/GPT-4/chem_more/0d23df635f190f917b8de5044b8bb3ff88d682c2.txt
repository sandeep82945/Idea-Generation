Expansion of In Silico Drug Repurposing: Building on the successful identification of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone as potential therapies for H7N9 influenza, future research could expand the in silico drug repurposing approach to other subtypes of influenza viruses. This could involve screening a broader library of FDA-approved drugs against different influenza strains, utilizing advanced algorithms for increased prediction accuracy.

Experimental Validation and Clinical Trials: The next logical step would be to conduct experimental validation of the computational findings. This includes in vitro testing of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone against the H7N9 virus to confirm their efficacy and safety. Following successful in vitro results, in vivo studies in animal models and eventually clinical trials in humans would be crucial to assess the drugs' effectiveness and safety profiles in real-world scenarios.

Structural Modification for Enhanced Efficacy: Based on the molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis, research could focus on modifying the chemical structures of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone to enhance their binding affinity to the neuraminidase enzyme of H7N9. Structural modification could also aim at improving drug properties such as solubility, stability, and reduced side effects.

Mechanistic Studies on Drug-Virus Interaction: To better understand how these repurposed drugs inhibit the H7N9 virus, detailed mechanistic studies could be conducted. This would involve analyzing the interaction between the drug molecules and the neuraminidase enzyme, focusing on the changes in enzyme conformation, activity, and its effect on viral replication and lifecycle.

Investigation into Combination Therapies: Considering the complexity of viral resistance mechanisms, future research could explore the efficacy of combination therapies involving Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone with existing antiviral drugs. This research would aim to discover synergistic effects that could enhance antiviral potency, reduce the required dosage of each drug, and minimize the likelihood of developing drug resistance.
