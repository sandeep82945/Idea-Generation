"Moreover, our experiments led to new observations and possible directions for future research. First, we noticed that algorithms could differ significantly in their ability to capture users’ tastes based on the domain. For instance, the NMF algorithm suffers from the unfairness of popularity bias in the music domain [14] while offering an entirely fair recommendation in Book-Crossing dataset. A future research direction that would be interesting is identifying the underlying reason for the variance, in particular, which feature of the data (e.g., sparsity, average user interaction) plays the primary role in propagating the popularity bias. Additionally, our results suggest that an underlying tradeoff exists between personalization and fairness of popularity bias in Diverse and Bestseller-focused groups, that is, algorithms with high personalization abilities tend to experience fairness issues. Thus, further research could be worthwhile into implementing a recommendation algorithm that can find the optimal tradeoff between personalization and the unfairness of popularity biases to enhance the system’s overall effectiveness."
