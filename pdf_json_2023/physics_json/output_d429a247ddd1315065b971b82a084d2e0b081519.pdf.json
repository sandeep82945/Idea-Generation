            "text": "The unique ability of fluorescence techniques to study biomolecules, such as oligonucleotides, under physiological conditions, with excellent sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, has made them indispensable tools in various fields of biochemical and biophysical research. To enable efficient detection, however, oligonucleotides require fluorescence labelling, as the canonical nucleobases are virtually non-emissive.1 An interesting alternative to the established labelling method of grafting bulky amphiphilic fluorophores such as ATTO-, AlexaFluor-, or cyanine dyes to the oligonucleotide, is to substitute one or several canonical nucleobases in the sequence for fluorescent nucleobase analogues (FBAs). FBAs are structural and functional mimics of the canonical nucleobases, and therefore act as an integral part of the oligonucleotide by maintaining its native base-pairing pattern\nand secondary structure.2\u20134 FBAs have been successfully employed as in-sequence fluorescent reporters in various oligonucleotide investigations, providing information on for instance base pairing dynamics,5 rotational dynamics,6 ligandand protein binding,7,8 duplex- and triplex formations,9,10 and duplex form transitions.11,12 FBAs have also been used to label and track oligonucleotides with therapeutic potential, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and mRNA, in live cells.13,14\nA recognized drawback of FBAs, however, is that they typically absorb light primarily in the UV region, with comparably low molar absorptivity (e o 20 000 M 1 cm 1).15 This means that researchers looking to image FBAs in a biological matrix are left with the options of either exposing the sample to potentially harmful doses of UV light, or settling for suboptimal excitation in the blue end of the visible spectrum. One way to overcome this is by using multiphoton excitation, in which two or more low energy photons can combine to access high-energy excited states.16 In addition to better matching with the FBA absorption, multiphoton excitation through the so-called therapeutic optical window may also allow for deep tissue- and in vivo fluorescence imaging with improved capabilities for optical sectioning by avoiding outof-focus bleaching.17 The propensity of a molecule to be excited via a two-photon (2P) process is characterized by its 2P absorption cross section (s2PA, unit: 1 GM = 10\n50 cm4 s photon 1), which for strong 2P absorbers that are comparable in size to FBAs is in the\na Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chalmers University of\nTechnology, Gothenburg SE-412 96, Sweden.\nE-mail: marcus.wilhelmsson@chalmers.se; Tel: +46-31-772 3051 b School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, University Avenue, Glasgow, G12\n8QQ, UK c Oligonucleotide Discovery, Discovery Sciences, R&D, AstraZeneca, Gothenburg,\nSweden\n\u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

A further challenge with FBAs is that their fluorescence quantum yield (FF) generally decreases upon incorporation into oligonucleotides, meaning that the 2P brightness (B2P = FF s2PA), which ultimately dictates the fluorophore\u2019s detectability, decreases proportionally. For these reasons, designing FBAs that are suitable for imaging nucleic acids using 2P excitation is a complex task and successful examples are rare. The uridine-inspired DMAthaU, reported by Nobis et al., was shown to have a brightness (B2PA = 18 GM) which was sufficient for single-molecule detection as a monomer; it was not, however, evaluated inside an oligonucleotide.19 Samaan et al. recently reported the highly fluorescent ABN, with a structure inspired by the pyrimidine nucleobase scaffold and push\u2013pull motif of rhodamine B.20 Although detectable at a singlemolecule level inside DNA using one-photon total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and thus constituting an excellent example of a bright, in-sequence fluorophore, ABN\u2019s ability to mimic the interactions of a specific nucleobase remains to be investigated. An interesting 2P-absorbing FBA that recently emerged from our lab is the pentacyclic adenine analogue pA, which has been characterized both as a monomer and inside DNA, where it replaces adenine with high fidelity.21,22 Its high 2P brightness inside single- and doublestranded DNA (1.3 GM and 0.35 GM, respectively) makes it useful as a base mimicking fluorescent reporter.22\nIn this work, we continue our exploration of FBAs with multiphoton bioimaging potential by investigating the quadracyclic adenine 2CNqA (Fig. 1), which was previously established as an excellent adenine analogue that is highly emissive as a monomer23 as well as inside DNA,24 RNA,24 and antisense\noligonucleotides (ASOs).13 Herein, the multiphoton absorption properties and detectability of 2CNqA as a ribonucleoside triphosphate (2CNqATP, Fig. 1), and incorporated at one or two positions in an ASO (2CNqA-1 and 2CNqA-2, respectively, Fig. 1) are investigated. We also explore the usefulness of multiphoton excitation for visualizing the FBA-labelled oligonucleotides inside live cells using non-linear fluorescence microscopy. ASOs are an emerging class of therapeutic oligonucleotides that induce their therapeutic effect by binding to RNA via Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing and several drugs based on this modality have achieved regulatory approval.25 The motivation for using the ASO design (Fig. 1) in this work is that (1) it internalizes spontaneously into cells, thereby avoiding potentially emission-perturbing formulation protocols such as lipoplexation, (2) the constrained ethyl and phosphorothioate chemistries in the oligonucleotide backbone, which are common ASO modifications, make the oligonucleotide resistant to degradation,26,27 i.e., intracellular fluorescence is likely to emanate from intact oligonucleotides rather than degradation products, and (3) it is nontoxic to cells up to at least 3 mM.13\nThis work contributes to the sparse catalogue of FBA studies carried out in a living environment and specifically explores, for the first time, the feasibility of multiphoton imaging of FBAlabelled oligonucleotides inside live cells."

The pulse duration at the objective focus was 7 fs using a 145 nm bandwidth centered on 790 nm. The beam passed through a pulse shaper (MIIPS Box 640, Biophotonic Solutions Inc.) and was guided into an inverted microscope (IX-71, Olympus) and focused on to the sample by a 1.2 NA, 60 water immersion objective (UPlanSApo, Olympus). Samples were placed on a borosilicate glass coverslip (#1.5 thickness Menzel Gla\u0308ser, Fisher Scientific). To minimise sample evaporation the temperature was maintained at 22 1 1C by an incubator (CU-501, Live Cell Instrument). The fluorescence was captured by the same objective, transmitted through a dichroic (675dcspxr, Chroma), and the emission signal was split into its parallel and perpendicular components which were detected by two avalanche photodiodes (APDs) (PDM50c and $PD-050-CT, Micro Photon Devices). The signal from the APDs was detected by a hardware correlator (ALV-7002, ALV GmbH). All measurements were conducted at a concentration of 100 nM in aqueous buffer, containing 20 mM tris, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.8. To remove fluorescent impurities the buffer was filtered through activated charcoal before use.\nSample preparation for live cell microscopy\nWild-type Huh-7 cells were kindly provided by Prof. Samir ElAndaloussi at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and verified to be mycoplasma free. The cells were cultured at 37 1C and 5% CO2 in complete medium composed of DMEM GlutaMax low glucose (Gibco, 21885025), with an addition of 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 10270106). For sub-cultivation and seeding, the cells were washed twice with calcium/magnesiumfree DPBS (Gibco, 14190250) and exposed to trypsin-0.25% EDTA to detach. For microscopy experiments, 500 mL cells in\nsuspension (0.18 106 cells per mL, counted after trypsin neutralization), were seeded on sterile circular glass cover slips (16 mm in diameter, 0.16 mm thickness; Fischer Scientific No. 1 1/2) 24 h prior to compound exposure. The cells were then exposed to the ASOs at a final concentration of 3.0 mM in complete medium for 24 h at 37 1C and 5% CO2 prior to imaging. To facilitate imaging in the upright microscope setup, a cover slip sandwich was constructed using a custom-made cover slip holder, maintaining the glass-adhered cells in 160 mL ASO-containing complete medium, at 37 1C but without a CO2 atmosphere, for the duration of the imaging experiment (ca. 3\u20134 h).\nMultiphoton photophysical characterization and live cell fluorescence microscopy\nExperiments were carried out on a Zeiss LSM 710 epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with an upright Axio Examiner.Z1 stage setup. For 1P excitation, the instrument-integrated 405 nm diode laser was used, while for 2P excitation, an InSight DeepSee (Spectra-Physics) tunable wavelength laser system, delivering sub-ps pulses at 80 MHz was used. Excitation and emission light were transmitted through a Plan-Apochromat 10 /0.45, N/0.17 objective with a working distance of 2.0 mm for the multiphoton absorption cross section and multiplicity determination, and a Plan-Apochromat 20 /1.0 DIC 75 mm, N/0.17 water immersion objective with a working distance of 1.9 mm for the cell imaging. The procedure for determining multiphoton absorption cross section and multiplicity is described in ESI\u2020 Section 4. For live cell microscopy, a stage with temperature control was used, maintaining 37 1C at the sample. Sample emission travelled through a 405 nm notch dichroic mirror (for 1P) or a 690 nm short pass dichroic mirror (for 2P), both of which transmit essentially all light in the selected emission range (410\u2013680 nm). A pinhole of 1 airy unit was used for the 1P mode, so as to achieve a comparable spatial resolution as for the 2P mode, for which no pinhole was used. To allow for a comparison of 1P vs. 2P emission intensities under these conditions, identical detector gain was applied for both imaging modes. Images were acquired at 16-bit depth and the brightness\u2019 were adjusted evenly across all images."

The fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime of 2CNqATP were herein determined to 0.48 and 9.9 ns, respectively (see ESI\u2020 Section 3), which is in line with reported values for a similar 2CNqA monomer.23 The 2-photon excitation maxima were observed at 700 nm for all compounds, with a pronounced shoulder for the ASOs appearing at ca. 780 nm (Fig. 2a, bottom panel). As expected, excitation into the 2P band using 700 nm pulsed excitation produces the same emission spectra as the corresponding 1P process (compare 1P vs. 2P dashed lines in Fig. 2a); note that the lower signal-to-noise ratio observed in the 2P emission spectra reflects the less-than-optimal performance of the acoustooptic filter monochromator applied in the microscope. The absorption cross sections at 700 nm were determined to be 6.9 GM, 13 GM, and 5.8 GM for 2CNqA-1, 2CNqA-2, and 2CNqATP, respectively, which among reported FBAs is exceptionally high, and the doubled absorption cross section of 2CNqA-2 compared to 2CNqA-1 agrees with the number of 2CNqA molecules in the oligonucleotides. The multiplicities of the absorption events were evaluated by recording the emission at various excitation intensities, which in a log\u2013log plot results in a linear dependency with slopes of 1.9, 1.8, and 1.9 for 2CNqA-1, 2CNqA-2, and 2CNqATP, respectively (Fig. 2b), confirming a two-photon process. Since the therapeutic mechanism\nof ASOs inside cells involves the ASO binding to its complementary target RNA,29 we decided to also characterize the photophysical properties of 2CNqA-1 and 2CNqA-2 as RNAbound duplexes and found that the absorption cross sections and multiplicities were largely retained (ESI\u2020 Fig S8). This, along with the nearly unchanged fluorescent quantum yield for these ASOs upon RNA binding,13 could make 2CNqA a useful probe for multiphoton techniques aimed at quantifying oligonucleotide concentration via fluorescence readout.\nTo further explore the non-linear photophysics of the 2CNqA fluorophore as a monomer compared to in an oligonucleotide, we measured fluorescence correlation spectra of the 2CNqATP and 2CNqA-1 using broadband multiphoton excitation (Fig. 3).\nThe 2P brightness, expressed as count rate per molecule (CPM), of 2CNqA-1 is 1.0 kHz, which is twice that of the previously reported pA when incorporated into a similar length oligomer.21 The 2CNqATP monomer, with a CPM of 2.7 kHz, is also one of the brightest FBAs yet measured, approaching that of ABN at 7 kHz.20"

The poor colocalization in the control samples is likely due to different chemical species in the cells contributing to 1P vs. 2P autofluorescence.\nFluorophore detectability in biological samples depends on the intensity ratio of fluorophore emission to cell autofluorescence. To investigate this for the 2CNqA-labeled ASOs using 1P vs. 2P excitation, we imaged the cells by optical sectioning (z-stacks). Basing the analysis on z-stacks, rather than on single images, cancels out potential perturbing effects caused by small misalignments of the 1P and 2P beam paths in the microscope. Scanning through the cell monolayer and masking out extracellular regions in the ensuing image analysis (see ESI\u2020 Section 7 for details), allowed for quantification of the total intracellular emission per area unit for the different compound exposures and imaging modes (Fig. S11, ESI\u2020). The ratio of the total intracellular emission from the 2CNqA ASO-exposed cells to that from the corresponding control cells gives a measure of detectability (Fig. 5).\nFig. 3 Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of 100 nM samples of 2CNqA as a monomer (2CNqATP, left) and oligomer (2CNqA-1, right) in aqueous buffer with 11.6 mW excitation power (the dashed lines show the fits; see ESI\u2020 Table S2 for details on fitting).

Phys., 2023, 25, 20218\u201320224 | 20223\nAlthough the excitation intensity dependence for the two imaging modes is different (Iem p Iexc for 1P and Iem p Iexc\n2 for 2P), the detectability ratios in Fig. 5 are independent of the applied laser powers, as they are divided by the control emission acquired with the same settings. In addition to fluorophore brightness, this ratio also depends on experimental parameters such as compound concentration, uptake efficiency, and autofluorescence levels. A plausible explanation for the modest detectability ratios observed here (for both excitation modes) could be elevated autofluorescence levels caused by a lack of CO2 during image acquisition. Nevertheless, since these factors are identical for 1P and 2P excitation, the relative detectability for the two imaging modes can be compared directly. Here, it is seen that 2P excitation performs better (ca. 40% higher for 2CNqA-2) compared to 1P (Fig. 5). Knowing that prolonged imaging can result in fluorophore bleaching, we also included a comparison of the 1P vs. 2P photobleaching kinetics of 2CNqATP using the microscope setup. It was seen that at excitation powers that result in similar 1P and 2P emission intensities, the 2P emission remains stable over time, while the 1P signal decreases significantly (Fig. S12, ESI\u2020). This illustrates the benefit of the 2P imaging mode\u2019s ability to avoid outof-focus excitation. Finally, it deserves mentioning that a so-called descanned type detection was used for the imaging in this work, which produces representative images for samples that exhibit low scattering (e.g. the herein used cell monolayer) using either 1P or 2P excitation. For samples with higher optical density, however, the option of non-descanned detection \u2013 uniquely available to 2P operation, will further improve the FBA\u2019s detection."

            "text": "In this work, the quadracyclic adenine analogue 2CNqA was characterized as a multiphoton fluorescent probe and applied\nas an antisense oligonucleotide-incorporated fluorescent reporter for live cell imaging. We conclude that 2CNqA absorbs via a twophoton process with absorption cross section maxima at 700 nm of 5.8 GM, 6.9 GM, and 13 GM for the monomer 2CNqATP, singly, and doubly labelled ASOs, respectively, which for an FBA are among the highest values reported. These values are also largely retained in the corresponding ASO:RNA duplex. An excellent 2P brightness of 2CNqA was further demonstrated using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, where it exhibits a CPM of 2.7 kHz as a monomer and 1.0 kHz when incorporated inside the ASO. Regarding imaging applicability, we show that the in-cell detectability increases by up to 40%, and that excessive 2CNqA photobleaching can be avoided by using 2P excitation instead of 1P, thus improving on a major drawback typically associated with FBA bioimaging. We anticipate that 2CNqA will be an attractive option for researchers looking to study oligonucleotides with maintained native behavior in optically dense biological matrices, such as in tissue or in vivo. Having herein established the multiphoton characteristics of 2CNqA, current efforts in our lab focus on investigating 2P imaging of this base analogue inside other types of oligonucleotides in combination with more challenging sample matrices."
