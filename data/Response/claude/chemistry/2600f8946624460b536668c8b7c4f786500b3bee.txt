 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Optimize expression of kstD2NS in Mycolicibacterium strains by trying different promoters, plasmid copy numbers, culture conditions etc. to increase 3-KSD activity.

2. Engineer Mycolicibacterium strains to increase permeability of hydrophobic steroids, for example by modifying cell wall/membrane composition. This could help improve substrate uptake and product release. 

3. Explore coexpression of kstD2NS with redox partner proteins in Mycolicibacterium to provide optimal electron transfer for 3-KSD activity.

4. Use directed evolution approaches on kstD2NS to improve activity, selectivity or stability of the enzyme for industrial biocatalysis applications.

5. Expand biotransformations to additional steroid substrates of pharmaceutical interest using the engineered Mycolicibacterium strains expressing kstD2NS.
