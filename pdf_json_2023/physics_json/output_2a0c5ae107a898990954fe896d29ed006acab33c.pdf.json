    "abstractText": "The current race for space exploration has hastened the development of electrochemical technologies for the in-situ utilisation of planetary resources for the synthesis of vital chemicals such as O2 and fuels. Understanding the physicochemical properties, such as the density and kinematic viscosity, of aqueous solutions is essential for the design of electrochemical devices for the electrolysis of water and CO2, particularly at low temperatures. The density and kinematic viscosity of highly concentrated Mg(ClO4)2 and KOH solutions have been determined, both at low temperatures and in the presence of CO2 gas. It was found that, for all of the solutions, independent of the concentration or nature of the electrolyte, as the temperature was decreased to 255 K, the density and the viscosity of the solutions increased. Upon saturation with CO2, no significant change to the density and viscosity of Mg(ClO4)2, at all of the temperatures measured, was observed. Conversely, the CO2 saturated solutions of KOH showed significant changes in density and viscosity at all temperatures, likely due to the formation of carbonates. The effects of these changes on the diffusion coefficient for dissolved CO2 is also discussed.",

            "text": "The current exploration of extra-terrestrial surfaces relies on unmanned probes, such as Curiosity on the surface of Mars, Rosetta and its associated lander, Philae, which landed on the comet Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko, and the Voyager probes. However, human exploration and colonisation to the farthest reaches of our solar system face many challenges, which need to be overcome. To explore and colonise other planets for extended periods of time, human astronauts will need essential supplies, such as oxygen and chemicals that can be used as fuels. However, there are prohibitive weight limits to space travel; therefore, the practice of in-situ resource utilisation to generate products with local materials is essential in this endeavour. For example, future plans for the exploration of the Martian surface by humans involve refueling the ascent vehicles on the surface using in-situ resources. Transporting the necessary fuel from Earth would require almost 40 Mt of oxygen and methane, which clearly poses a significant challenge in weight transport [1,2] However, the first experiments to generate oxygen on the surface have already taken place. By December 2021, the Mars Oxygen In Situ Resource Utilisation experiment (MOXIE) had generated around 50 g of O2 via a solid oxide fuel cell at 800 \u25e6C from the compressed Martian atmosphere [1]. Other electrocatalytic processes could be carried out to produce the necessary chemicals, such as hydrogen or methane, through the electrolysis of CO2 dissolved in water [3,4]. The Phoenix lander observed gulley formations on the surface of Mars, likely caused by the flow of liquid over the surface, which, coupled with soil analysis, led to the conclusion that perchlorate brines exist under certain conditions on the surface of Mars [5\u201311]. Previous\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5641. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155641 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nresearch has shown that lowering the temperature below 0 \u25e6C increases the production of CH4 and CO and decreases the production of H2 when CO2 is electrocatalytically reduced in brines of Mg(ClO4)2 [3]. The non-standard temperature and pressure conditions of extra-terrestrial regions need to be considered when designing catalytic processes, and they can sometimes be advantageous. Parameters such as the pressure, temperature and electrolyte salinity are a rich area of research for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 on Earth [12\u201314] The ever-increasing concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere is causing climate change at an alarming rate. One avenue to mitigate the excessive accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere is to capture CO2 at major production sites and either store it underground as CO2 clathrates or convert it to value-added products [15\u201320]. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is one of many potential methods of CO2 conversion. Using concentrated electrolytes and low temperatures for a CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is another avenue to increase CO2 solubility. Up to a point, the addition of salts to water lowers the freezing point, which means that electrocatalytic reactions can be carried out in the liquid phase at sub-zero temperatures [21\u201325]. It has been demonstrated that electrochemical processes can be carried out in solid aqueous electrolytes [26,27]; however, by increasing the electrolyte concentration, the freezing point of the solution can be depressed to maintain a liquid phase, which is more technologically advantageous. Blagden\u2019s Law, Equation (1), can be used to estimate the depression in the freezing point of the electrolyte, \u2206T, where K is the cryoscopic constant of the solvent, m is the molality (moles solute per kg solvent) and i is the Van\u2019t Hoff factor, which describes the number of ions a species forms when fully dissociated.\n\u2206T = K \u00d7 m \u00d7 i (1)\nCare should be taken when using Equation (1) as it does not account for the chemical activity of the ions and is only applicable for ideal solutions. Equation (1) can be used for general approximations, such as for the freezing point of sea water; however, at high concentrations, non-linear behaviour occurs and the freezing point begins to rise again [28,29]. Using brines as electrolytes enables the depression of the freezing point whilst, in theory, also favouring the increase in the solubility of certain gases, such as CO2, methane and O2 [30]. As such, the increase in the reactants might also increase the rate of the electrochemical reaction involving these gases. For example, in Mg(ClO4)2 brines, as the temperature is lowered to \u221235 \u25e6C, the solubility of O2 increases to around 1.1 mM and the current, due to O2 reduction, increases [31]. In previous works, we have also reported an increase in the reaction rate of the electrochemical conversion of CO2 and methane at sub-zero temperatures in aqueous brines of Mg(ClO4)2 and KOH [3]. At high pressures or low temperatures, gas clathrates are formed, where cages of water molecules encapsulate gas molecules [32]. These phases are well-known as, in the mining industry, they can form in gas pipelines, causing costly blockages, and because CH4 versions are found in permafrost or in the deep ocean. The CH4 hydrates found in the ocean and permafrost are a double-edged sword; they could be a huge reservoir of energy if electrocatalytic technology can be developed to exploit them, but there is a small possibility that if oceanic temperatures continue to rise, the hydrates may become unstable, releasing CH4 into the atmosphere and leading to runaway warming [33,34]. Several groups have explored the opportunity recovery of energy from CH4 clathrates and simultaneously sequestrated CO2 as clathrates through the direct swapping of CH4 by CO2 in one clathrate cavity. Changes in temperature not only have an effect on the solubility of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes, but they also have a marked effect on the dynamic viscosity, \u03b7, and the density, \u03c1. These factors are not only important in the engineering of future technology, but also for fundamental processes such as the mass transport of ions. The Nernst-Plank Equation (2) is\nused to describe the mass transfer to an electrode, encompassing the processes of diffusion, convection and migration.\nJi(x) = \u2212Di \u2202Ci(x) \u2202x \u2212 ziF RT DiCi \u2202\u03c6(x) \u2202x + Civ(x) (2)\nwhere at a distance x from an electrode for a species i, J is the flux (mol s\u22121 cm\u22122), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s\u22121), C is the concentration (mol cm\u22123), z is the charge, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (K), \u03d5 is the electrostatic potential (V) and v is the velocity (cm s\u22121). The diffusion coefficient, D, can be derived from the Einstein-Stokes Equation (3),\nD = kBT\n4\u03c0\u03b7re f f (3)\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, reff is the effective radius of the species (m) and \u03b7 is the dynamic viscosity of the solution (Pa s). The dynamic viscosity is derived from the kinematic viscosity, \u03bd (m2 s\u22121), and the density via Equation (4).\n\u03b7 (Pa s) = \u03bd ( m2 s\u22121 ) \u00d7 \u03c1 ( kg m\u22123 ) (4)\nwhen designing electrolysers for any catalytic process involving a liquid reaction media, the viscosity of the media is important for the physical design aspects as the viscosity will affect the flow-through components. However, as Equation (2) shows, the flux of any reactants or products of the reaction is heavily influenced by the diffusion coefficient, which is, in-turn, heavily affected by the viscosity. Given the importance of the viscosity for mass transport during electrochemical reactions, such as CO2 conversion [35\u201338] and water splitting [39], herein we report the values of the density and dynamic viscosity at sub-zero temperatures down to 255 K for Mg(ClO4)2 and KOH brines in the absence of, and upon saturation with, CO2 gas. These results can then be used to better understand the anti-Arrhenius behaviour seen during the electrochemical conversion of CO2 and the oxidation of methane at temperatures below \u22125 \u25e6C reported in our previous work [3]. A more complete understanding of the electrochemical conversion of CO2 at low temperatures will further promote the design of electrochemical devices for space exploration and colonisation."

            "text": "Figure 1 shows the densities of the Mg(ClO4)2 and KOH solutions as a function of the temperature. As expected, the density of all the solutions increases linearly with the decreasing temperature. At 255 K, 3.8 mol kg\u22121 is close to the saturation of the Mg(ClO4)2 solution, and below this temperature, precipitation of 6H2O\u00b7Mg(ClO4)2 occurs [28], which is the most stable form under Martian conditions [40]. Upon CO2 saturation, the solution of 3.8 m Mg(ClO4)2 showed no significant change in the density at any T measured, suggesting little absorption of CO2 in the solution. These results are in agreement with the poor solubility of CO2 at the pH of the Mg(ClO4)2 solutions (pH = 8). The previous work by our group using mass spectroscopy found that, in the same electrolyte, the concentration of CO2 increased from 1.12 mM at 293.15 K to 5.08 mM at 253 K [3]. However, such small changes in the concentration of CO2 in the solution are below the detection limit and within the standard deviation of the measurements using the methodology used in this work. Upon saturation with CO2, the density of 8.5 m KOH increases by 0.04 g cm\u22123 across all the measured temperatures (Table 1). This indicates that the amount of CO2 absorbed is constant over all temperatures in this range. Alternatively, as in the case of the Mg(ClO4)2, the variation in the concentration of CO2 is, again, too small to be seen via this methodology. In this regard, previous works have shown that, at room temperature, the concentration\nof absorbed CO2 increases with the concentration of KOH [41] due to the formation of (bi)carbonates, but at very high concentrations of the electrolyte, the CO2 solubility is limited due to the so-called \u201csalting out\u201d effect [42,43]. The balance between these factors\u2014 that is, (bi) carbonate formation and the salting out effect\u2014and the expected increase in the CO2 solubility due to the lower temperature may account for the observed constant CO2 concentration across the temperatures measured.

When the CO2 dissolves, it reacts with the available water and sets up an equilibrium between CO32\u2212, HCO3\u2212 and H2CO3. In concentrated KOH, the most abundant ion is HCO3\u2212, which causes an associated lowering of the pH [41]. The carbonate ions can form hydrogen bonds and interact with the wider water network, which increases the intermolecular forces of attraction, and therefore the viscosity. In order to obtain the activation energy of the system, Figure 2C,D show the Arrhenius linear representation of the measured values of the viscosity as a function of the temperature using Equation (6).\nln \u03b7 = ln \u03b7\u221e + Ea R \u00b7 1 T\n(6)\n\u03b7\u221e can be interpreted as the viscosity of the solution at infinite temperature (Pa s) and Ea is the energy input needed for molecules in the solution to flow past each other. These parameters are derived for each of the solutions, as shown in Table 3. There is a small increase in Ea when KOH is saturated with CO2, which supports the idea that there is an increase in the strength of the interactions between the ions."

            "text": "Using the values for \u03b7 determined in the previous section and Equation (3), the values for D were calculated, and the results are shown in Table 4. The hydrodynamic radius of the CO2 was assumed to be the same as in pure water [45], but loosely dependent on the temperature [46] As T decreases, the diffusion coefficient also decreases in both solutions. The larger \u03b7 values for 8.5 m KOH correspond with lower D values compared to 3.8 m Mg(ClO4)2. According to Equation (2), the lower values of the diffusion coefficient indicate a lower flux and a decrease in the mass transport of CO2 through the solutions. The results obtained using pulsed-field gradient 13C NMR showed a trend of a decrease in D with increasing salinity of the brines; for example, 2.06 10\u22129 m2 s\u22121 in 1.0 m NaCl decreasing to 1.29 10\u22129 m2 s\u22121 in 5.0 m NaCl [45]. The results obtained using a Taylor dispersion method show that D also decreases with the temperature in pure water [46]; therefore, the results presented in Table 4 fit with the trends presented in the literature.\nStandard uncertainties for D reported in table.

Therefore, even though the physicochemical properties of the solution, such as the density and viscosity, influence the diffusion of the gaseous reactant species, other intrinsic parameters promote Anti-Arrhenius behaviour so that, at low temperatures, the catalytic activity increases."

As can be seen in Table 6, in the case of water, both the density and the dynamic viscosity are within 1% of the literature results [47]. For 8.5 m KOH, the density value reported in this work is within 1% of the literature value; however, the dynamic viscosity has a 4% deviation [48]. Such an error can be associated with the hygroscopic nature of KOH solutions causing a decrease in the concentration of the solutions during measurement of the viscosity.\nStandard uncertainty for T = 0.5 K. Standard uncertainty for \u03c1 and \u03b7 are given in the table. Expanded uncertainty for water, U(\u03c1) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 g cm\u22123, U(\u03b7) = 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 mPa s.

Herein, we record \u03c1 = 1.4006 g cm\u22123 at the same temperature for the lower concentration of 3.8 m. Similarly, for 8.21 m KOH at 273 K, Kelly et al. recorded \u03c1 = 1.4373 g cm\u22123 and \u03b7 = 4.409 mPa s [50]. In comparison, the values recorded herein for 8.5 m KOH at 273 K are 1.3300 g cm\u22123 and 4.44 mPa s. Again, we ascribe deviations to the hygroscopic nature of concentrated KOH solutions."

            "text": "The density and dynamic viscosity of the highly concentrated KOH and Mg(ClO4)2 solutions were measured and reported at temperatures below 273 K. The high electrolyte concentration results in the depression of the freezing point of the aqueous solution down to 255 K. It was found that as the temperature decreased, the \u03b7 and \u03c1 for all the solutions increased. The \u03c1 increased linearly and the \u03b7 followed an Arrhenius relationship. Given the importance of these solutions for the development of electrolysers on other planetary objects, the density and dynamic viscosity of the same KOH and Mg(ClO4)2 solutions saturated with CO2 are also reported. The 3.8 m Mg(ClO4)2 showed no significant differences in \u03b7 or \u03c1 at any measured temperature after saturation with CO2. The results are associated with the poor solubility of CO2 at the pH of the Mg(ClO4)2. Conversely, the 8.5 m KOH solutions showed marked changes in their physicochemical behaviour upon saturation with CO2. A constant increase in the \u03c1 was observed; at the same time, a much greater increase was observed in the \u03b7 at lower temperatures. We conclude that the formation of (bi) carbonate species due to the reaction between the CO2 and KOH increased the strength of the interactions between the ions, resulting in a larger change in the viscosity at lower temperatures. At low temperatures, the diffusion coefficient of CO2 is significantly reduced in these solutions, which will result in less mass transport through the electrolyte. This indicates that the increase in the CO2 reduction current at low temperatures seen in our previous work is due to an increase in the kinetics of the reaction, not an increase in the transport of CO2 to the electrode surface [3]. However, the benefit of the increased activity at low temperatures is finely balanced with the disadvantageous increase in the viscosity of the solutions and the decrease in the diffusion of CO2. On the basis of these results, we believe that the increase in the electrochemical activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, and possibly the oxidation of CH4 at low temperatures [3], could be related to the large DC electric field near the surface due to changes in the double layer (DL) associated with the high concentration of the electrolyte and the low temperature. The electric field from the solvated cations in the DL can substantially favour the formation of key intermediates of the reactions, thus increasing the kinetics of the reaction [51]. These insights are crucial for the further investigation of catalytic reactions at low temperatures in brines.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.S. and P.R.; Validation, E.S.; Formal analysis, E.S.; Investigation, E.S.; Data curation, P.R.; Writing\u2014original draft, E.S.; Writing\u2014review & editing, E.S. and P.R.; Supervision, P.R.; Project administration, P.R.; Funding acquisition, P.R.
