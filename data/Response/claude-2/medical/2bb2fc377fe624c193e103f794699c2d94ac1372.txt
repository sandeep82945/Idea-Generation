 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in participants of different ages, such as children, adolescents, and older adults. The current study only looked at young adults. Comparing different age groups could reveal developmental differences. 

2. Investigate the impacts of gender-matched versus mismatched in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning. For example, compare learning in females receiving female versus male in-group feedback. This could elucidate effects of gender identity.

3. Explore the influences of varying degrees of racial prototypicality of in-group and out-group faces on implicit learning. Using faces ranging from very prototypical to ambiguous could clarify the roles of salience and familiarity. 

4. Study how factors like learners' prior contact experiences with out-groups affect how out-group facial feedback impacts their implicit learning. Individual differences in intergroup attitudes may moderate effects.

5. Examine the neural correlates of implicit learning differences based on in-group versus out-group facial feedback using neuroimaging methods. This could reveal the underlying brain mechanisms and processes involved.
