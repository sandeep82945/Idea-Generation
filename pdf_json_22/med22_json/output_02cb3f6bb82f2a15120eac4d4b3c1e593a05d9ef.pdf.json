    "abstractText": "Large genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (PrCa), and many of these risk loci is presumed to confer regulatory effects on gene expression. While eQTL studies of long RNAs has yielded many potential risk genes, the relationship between PrCa risk genetics and microRNA expression dysregulation is understudied. We performed an microRNA transcriptome-wide association study of PrCa risk using small RNA sequencing and genome-wide genotyping data from N = 441 normal prostate epithelium tissue samples along with N = 411 prostate adenocarcinoma tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Genetically regulated expression prediction models were trained for all expressed microRNAs using the FUSION TWAS software. TWAS for PrCa risk was performed with both sets of models using single-SNP summary statistics from the recent PRACTICAL consortium PrCa case-control OncoArray GWAS metaanalysis. A total of 613 and 571 distinct expressedmicroRNAswere identified in the normal and tumor tissue datasets, respectively (overlap: 480). Among these, 79 (13%) normal tissue microRNAs demonstrated significant cis-heritability (median cis-h2 = 0.15, range: 0.03\u20130.79) for model training. Similar results were obtained from TCGA tumor samples, with 48 (9%) microRNA expression models successfully trained (median cis-h2 = 0.14, range: 0.06\u20130.60). Using normal tissue models, we identified two significant TWAS microRNA associations with PrCa risk: over-expression of mir-941 family microRNAs (PTWAS = 2.9E-04) and reduced expression of miR-3617-5p (PTWAS = 1.0E-03). The TCGA tumor TWAS also identified a significant association with miR-941 overexpression (PTWAS = 9.7E-04). Subsequent finemapping of the TWAS results using a multi-tissue database indicated limited evidence of causal status for each microRNA with PrCa risk (posterior inclusion probabilities <0.05). Future work will examine downstream regulatory effects of microRNA dysregulation as well as microRNA-mediated risk mechanisms via competing endogenous RNA relationships.",

LeeMoffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, United States\nLarge genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (PrCa), and many of these risk loci is presumed to confer regulatory effects on gene expression. While eQTL studies of long RNAs has yielded many potential risk genes, the relationship between PrCa risk genetics and microRNA expression dysregulation is understudied. We performed an microRNA transcriptome-wide association study of PrCa risk using small RNA sequencing and genome-wide genotyping data from N = 441 normal prostate epithelium tissue samples along with N = 411 prostate adenocarcinoma tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Genetically regulated expression prediction models were trained for all expressed microRNAs using the FUSION TWAS software. TWAS for PrCa risk was performed with both sets of models using single-SNP summary statistics from the recent PRACTICAL consortium PrCa case-control OncoArray GWAS metaanalysis. A total of 613 and 571 distinct expressedmicroRNAswere identified in the normal and tumor tissue datasets, respectively (overlap: 480). Among these, 79 (13%) normal tissue microRNAs demonstrated significant cis-heritability (median cis-h2 = 0.15, range: 0.03\u20130.79) for model training. Similar results were obtained from TCGA tumor samples, with 48 (9%) microRNA expression models successfully trained (median cis-h2 = 0.14, range: 0.06\u20130.60). Using normal tissue models, we identified two significant TWAS microRNA associations with PrCa risk: over-expression of mir-941 family microRNAs (PTWAS = 2.9E-04) and reduced expression of miR-3617-5p (PTWAS = 1.0E-03). The TCGA tumor TWAS also identified a significant association with miR-941 overexpression (PTWAS = 9.7E-04). Subsequent finemapping of the TWAS results using a multi-tissue database indicated limited evidence of causal status for each microRNA with PrCa risk (posterior inclusion probabilities <0.05). Future work will examine downstream regulatory effects of microRNA dysregulation as well as microRNA-mediated risk mechanisms via competing endogenous RNA relationships.\nKeywords: prostate cancer, eQTL, microRNA, expression, TWAS\nEdited by: Robert Klein,\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, United States\nReviewed by: Benjamin Rybicki,\nHenry Ford Health System, United States\nXia Jiang, Karolinska Institutet (KI), Sweden\n*Correspondence: Nicholas B.

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PrCa) is a highly heritable complex disease, and large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses have identified hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased risk of PrCa (Gudmundsson et al., 2007; Yeager et al., 2007; Salinas et al., 2008; Schaid et al., 2010; Kote-Jarai et al., 2011; Akamatsu et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012; Al Olama et al., 2013; Kote-Jarai et al., 2013; Al Olama et al., 2014; Hazelett et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014; Amin Al Olama et al., 2015; Hoffmann et al., 2015; Teerlink et al., 2016). However, the majority of these risk loci are intergenic and few causal genes for PrCa have been explicitly identified (Eeles et al., 2014). For many identified loci, the underlying causal variants are presumed to confer regulatory effects on expression of nearby genes. Follow-up expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have begun to explore putative regulatory targets of PrCa risk SNPs (Thibodeau et al., 2015; DeRycke et al., 2019). Recent methodological advancements in colocalization of disease-associated SNPs and eQTLs have yielded powerful transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) approaches to disease-gene discovery, which have been highly successfully in translating single-SNP GWAS hits into gene-level associations with PrCa risk (Mancuso et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022).\nMost eQTL-based functional studies of PrCa risk loci have focused primarily on protein-coding genes, and classes of noncoding RNA transcripts remain understudied. An important class of small non-coding RNAs is microRNAs (miRNAs), which contribute to transcriptome regulation via post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms of translational repression, and RNA degradation. MiRNAs are initially expressed as long precursor primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts before multiple postprocessing steps yield short mature miRNAs typically 20\u201322 nucleotides in length. These mature miRNAs in turn bind to miRNA response elements (MREs) located primarily in the 3- prime untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target RNA transcripts. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating the roles of miRNAs in cancer (Peng and Croce, 2016). Specific to PrCa, upregulation of miR-124 has been shown to repress PrCa growth and inhibit invasion of PrCa tumor cells (Kang et al., 2014), and circulating miRNA expression profiles demonstrate diagnostic value for aggressive PrCa (Alhasan et al., 2016). Previous multiomic analyses in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) samples also identified associations of unsupervised miRNA expression clusters and tumor Gleason score (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2015).\nRecent eQTL studies have also shown pri-miRNA transcripts are subject to the same cis-acting SNP regulatory effects as other long RNAs (Huan et al., 2015), and PrCa risk SNPs may confer systemic impacts on the prostate transcriptome through miRNA expression dysregulation. However, large miRNA expression datasets in relevant tissue types are necessary for eQTL-based disease gene discovery, and such data for normal prostate tissue are lacking. In this study, we present data from a large miRNA sequencing dataset in normal prostate tissue, explore cis-based predictive modeling of miRNA expression, and evaluate potential associations between PrCa risk genetics and expression dysregulation of miRNAs by performing a miRNA-based\nTWAS (miTWAS) of expressed miRNAs in normal and tumor prostate tissue, which may respectively reveal key risk gene associations relevant to various stages of tumorigenesis."

To reduce underlying technical differences between our normal tissue miRNA expression dataset and the TCGA small RNA sequencing results, TCGA PRAD small RNASeq BAM files were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), of which N = 411 were identified to correspond to tumor tissue.

First, the absolute expression levels were generally much lower in our normal tissue miRNA\nTABLE 1 | Summary of miRNA GReX model training for tumor and normal expression datasets.\nTWAS results\nDataset Mature miRNA\nMiRNA Gene\nChr Start (hg19)\ncis-h2 Best GWAS SNP Z p-value Q-value\nNormal hsa-miR-3617-5p MIR3617 20 44333789 0.323 rs432448 chr20:44332298.G.T \u22123.80 1.47E-04 0.0103 hsa-miR-941 MIR941 20 62551155 0.793 rs1058319 chr20.62374389.C.T 3.62 2.92E-04 0.0103\nTumor hsa-miR-941 MIR941 20 62551155 0.267 rs1058319 chr20.62374389.C.T 3.28 1.04E-03 0.0406\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8368415\nexpression dataset than our much deeper sequenced long RNASeq data, which may reduce heritability testing power and predictive modeling performance. Moreover, there is evidence that the cis-regulatory contributions to overall heritability for miRNAs may be relatively modest compared to mRNAs. In the large multi-generational miRNA expression analysis of N = 5,239 Framingham Heart Study participants by Huan et al. (Huan et al., 2015), only 9/247 (3.6%) of expressed miRNAs corresponded to a narrow-sense h2 estimate >0.3, of which the mean single cis-eQTL contribution to explained variation was 0.08. As miRNAs are also regulatory noncoding RNAs, they are subject to sponging effects of target mRNAs and may be more susceptible to overall transcriptomic variability. Finally, as similarly speculated in Huan et al., it is likely that evolutionary pressures may constrain cis-regulatory effects on pri-miRNAs, given the roles of miRNAs on critical biological processes.\nWe also noted a sizable difference in number of trained models by dataset (77 for normal vs. 47 for tumor). We believe this may be again driven by both biological and technical differences between datasets. Firstly, the microRNA transcriptome can be heavily dysregulated in the tumor environment, which substantially increases the variance of expression and reduces the relative contribution of cis-acting genetic effects. Second, the relative density of the respective genotyping platforms could yield differential imputation efficiency for key eQTL SNPs, potentially yielding more accurate GReX models derived from the normal tissue samples. Despite these caveats, we did observe consistent results across the independent tumor and normal tissue miRNA expression datasets, both with respect to identified expressed miRNAs and miTWAS test statistics.\nOur top miTWAS finding was miR-3617-5p, encoded by MIR3617, identified in the normal prostate tissue analysis. This miRNA was only identified as expressed in normal prostate tissue, with reduced levels corresponding to increased PrCa risk. Upon literature review, little is currently known regarding the biology of miR-3617-5p and its potential involvement to tumorigenic processes. A previous study of small-cell lung cancer identified downregulation of miR-3617-5p to be associated with chemoresitance (Kuang et al., 2020).\nThe miR-941 gene family consists of a cluster of five miRNA sequences spanning approximately 500 bp on chr20 (bp: 62550778\u201362551292), and hsa-miR-941 upregulation was identified to be associated with increased PrCa risk in both tumor and normal datasets. Hsa-miR-941 is a human-specific miRNA that is expressed in a wide variety of tissue types, and has demonstrated higher expression levels in cancer-derived cell lines (Hu et al., 2012). Hu et al. identified tumor suppressor lncRNA TP73-AS1 as a sponge transcript for hsa-miR-941, showing that over-expression of TP73-AS1 attenuated cell migration and led to increased expression of hsa-miR-941 targets (Hu et al., 2018). Zhao et al. (2020) investigated serum exosomal miR-941 levels in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, identifying increased expression as a diagnostic biomarker. The authors further demonstrated miR-941 overexpression promoted cell\nproliferation and invasion via cell-line studies. These findings are commensurate with the observed positive association with PrCa risk in our study.\nThe relatively modest miTWAS associations along with our finemapping results raise questions regarding the potential causal relationship of PrCa genetic risk mediated by direct expression dysregulation of these two miRNAs and, to a larger extent, the prostate miRNA transcriptome in general. Similarly, while both identified miRNAs have previously reported associations with cancer in the literature, this is true of many miRNAs and thus such connections should be interpreted with caution. Consequently, follow-up functional studies that can study the direct effects of up/down-regulation of these miRNAs in prostate cell-lines are warranted.\nThere are limitations to our study that warrant mention. Firstly, no true replication dataset was available to verify discoveries, as the two datasets we analyzed were from normal, and tumor prostate tissue, respectively. Thus, further validation of these findings is warranted in independent and comparable datasets. Additionally, the high degree of sample multi-plexing in the normal tissue small RNA sequencing may have reduced sensitivity for association analysis with lower expressed mature miRNAs. However, we observed a high degree of overlap in identified miRNAs, and the individual miTWAS results across datasets were comparable. Our analyses were also restricted to subjects of European ancestry, which limits the generalizability of our results to other racial/ethnic groups. Finally, TWAS methods focus solely on cis-regulatory effects of trait-associated SNPs on expression. As miRNAs are themselves regulatory in nature, trans-effects of PrCa risk variants may be more relevant via competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks.\nIn conclusion, our exploration of prostate miRNA expression and PrCa risk genetics revealed two moderate miTWAS associations, including an association in one region with no previously reported TWAS associations. Future efforts studying the role of miRNAs in the genetic risk of PrCa will focus on more sophisticated examination of ceRNA-based transeffects and multi-tissue analyses."
