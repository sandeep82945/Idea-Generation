    "abstractText": "The global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact on thousands of small businesses. Many businesspeople, especially those who own and run micro-businesses, have been hampered by the unprecedented scale of the lockdown of social activities and the restrictions placed on their freedom of movement. The reciprocity process between small rural businesses and residents is ultimately in the interest of improving agrotourism performance. Integrating the nonzero-sum games theory and the social exchange theory, this study aims to achieve the following: (1) testing the relationship between family micro-businesses resources and agritourism performance; (2) examining the impact of two mediating variables (resident\u2013micro-business interaction and support for agritourism development); and (3) testing the intervention of one moderating variable (personal resident benefit) on the tested relationships. Dyads data was collected from 293 residents/family small businesses operators. Partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with the SmartPLS program was employed to analyze the collected data. Family micro-business resources were found to have a positive and significant impact on agritourism performance, moreover, resident\u2013micro-business interaction and support for agritourism development were found to partially mediate the relationship between family micro-business resources and agritourism performance, and the personal resident benefit significantly moderated the relationship between family microbusiness resources and resident\u2013micro-business interaction. Several implications for academics and policymakers were elaborated. The limitations and further study opportunities were also discussed.",

Research has indicated that rural residents might participate in resistance actions that can significantly prevent rural tourism development if they believe that they are responsible for the majority of the rural core tourism attractions while having the least access to\nMathematics 2023, 11, 359. https://doi.org/10.3390/math11020359 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics\nMathematics 2023, 11, 359 2 of 15\nthose that are useful to tourists [2,3]. They believe tourism developments that do not use local businesses will not provide clear economic benefits such as jobs and higher family incomes [2]; as agritourism\u2019s main players, they will defend their rights and interests. In developing countries, agritourism micro-businesses are frequently associated with family-related enterprises, such as farming or tourist-related activities on farms [4]. Familyowned agritourism small businesses often do not aim to become large entities and the owners often see themselves as emotionally attached to their communities and businesses [5]. However, micro-business success is predicated not just on the individual ventures\u2019 success but also on the overall contributions each makes to its local community [6]. In the same vein, drawing on the social exchange theory, [7] it can be argued that \u201clocal residents are prepared to participate in an exchange with tourists if they believe that it is likely they will obtain benefits without incurring unacceptable costs\u201d. The reciprocity process between family micro-businesses and local residents is ultimately in the interest of improving agrotourism performance. According to the social exchange theory (SET), economic and socio-emotional resources are exchanged. Economic resources include everything of monetary value that might meet financial needs. Socio-emotional resources include supportiveness, helpfulness, and friendliness [8]. On examination, micro-businesses are frequently perceived as non-\u2018mainstream\u2019, boosted by the owners\u2019 interests rather than by commercial motivations, offering little opportunity for growth and greater value in promoting social inclusion. Hence, the economic activities of the micro-business are embedded within the broader social and economic relationships of the household [9]. Local residents\u2019 ownership of family micro-businesses is expected to increase resident\u2013micro-business interaction (or client interaction) due to high-quality social exchanges (i.e., economic and socio-emotional relationships) [8]. Furthermore, personal benefits play a significant role in the exchange process for residents\u2019 favorable attitudes toward tourism [10]. Thus, maximizing the residents\u2019 personal benefits will reflect positively on resident\u2013micro-business interaction [11]. Overall, local residents\u2019 involvement in tourism development strengthens their perceptions of tourism\u2019s benefits, increasing their willingness to support agritourism development in their community [12,13]. Based on the arguments mentioned earlier, the current study uses game theory (GT) as a theoretical background to explain the intercorrelations in our study. According to Friedenberg and Keisler [14], the application of the game theory to economic behavior and alliances is extensive. The theory is instrumental in gaining insights into how market players behave and interact in certain situations [15] and provides a way of analyzing both competitor and partner behavior, as well as what is likely to happen if the rules are changed. Game theorists have suggested the notion of a non-zero-sum game (see Figure 1). This is one of the considerable critical assumptions of game theory. The idea proposes that players\u2014i.e., in our study are (player 1) family micro-businesses and (player 2) local residents\u2014may profit from collaboration by revealing their approach beforehand and making an \u201cirrevocable commitment\u201d to it [16]. Mathematics 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16\nFigure 1. Non-zero game theory.\nZhang et al. described this notion as \u201cthe realization of maximizing the interests of both sides, which is a harmonious development with mutual benefits\u201d [17]. Accordingly, this study, depending on the game theory along with the social exchange theory (SET), aims to (1) test the associations between family micro-business resources (FM) and agritourism performance (AP), (2) explore the mediating role of resident\u2013micro-business interaction (RMI) and support for agritourism development (SAD), and finally, (3) test the moderating role of personal resident benefit (PRB) on the proposed relationships. Previous studies on agritourism were found to have focused on the social, ecological, cultural, authenticity variables [18], and agritourism marketing endeavors [19]. Still, they have not addressed the micro-business as a tool for the success of agritourism enterprises in local rural communities [20]. Furthermore, most agritourism research has been conducted in Western nations, resulting in a need for more awareness of the sector\u2019s condition in less developed countries [21]. Consequently, this study attempts to fill this gap by (1) exploring the role of establishing family micro-businesses in improving agritourism performance and (2) conducting a field study in one of the developing countries (i.e., KSA). To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, this study is one of the first that explores all these direct, moderating, and mediating relationships in one model and in one context using partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) as the main data analysis technique.\n2. Literature Review and Development of Hypotheses 2.1. The Mediating Role of Resident\u2013Micro-Business Interaction (RMI) and Support for Agritourism Development (SAD)\nTraditional agricultural production methods are becoming less feasible, especially in developing countries, and farming residents have faced economic and social problems due to lower farming revenues. Hence, farmers have resorted to agritourism activities [22]. Agritourism promotes local economic development by revitalizing traditional industries, farming-related tourist activities, and older styles of life that react to the post-modern customers\u2019 pursuit of authenticity [23]. Thus, it generates services and employment chances and provides additional foreign sources of income. Therefore, agritourism is increasingly regarded as a tool for enhancing the economic and social circumstances for local residents [24,25]. Agritourism operators (agritourism practices include on-farm direct sales, accommodation/lodging, leisure/special events, open-air recreation, and educational activities) are often smaller, family-owned businesses originating in the host community and frequently showcase host agricultural goods and cultural practices [26]. These micro-businesses employ 10 or fewer employees and have progressively more significant roles in local economic growth [27] by creating entrepreneurship chances for women [28], and family groups [29]. Employing the resource-based view (RBV) approach [30], family micro-business resources (FM) can be categorized as business-based resources and structural resources, where \u201cbusiness resources are those created and possessed by individual business owners\u201d. While structural resources are considered externally based in nature \u201c\u2026\nFigure 1.

Hence, farmers have resorted to agritourism activities [22]. Agritourism promotes local economic development by revitalizing traditional industries, farming-related tourist activities, and older styles of life that react to the post-modern customers\u2019 pursuit of authenticity [23]. Thus, it generates services and employment chances and provides additional foreign sources of income. Therefore, agritourism is increasingly regarded as a tool for enhancing the economic and social circumstances for local residents [24,25]. Agritourism operators (agritourism practices include on-farm direct sales, accommodation/lodging, leisure/special events, open-air recreation, and educational activities) are often smaller, family-owned businesses originating in the host community and frequently showcase host agricultural goods and cultural practices [26]. These micro-businesses employ 10 or fewer employees and have progressively more significant roles in local economic growth [27] by creating entrepreneurship chances for women [28], and family groups [29]. Employing the resource-based view (RBV) approach [30], family micro-business resources (FM) can be categorized as business-based resources and structural resources, where \u201cbusiness resources are those created and possessed by individual business owners\u201d. While structural resources are considered externally based in nature \u201c. . . that owners may benefit from or contribute to but do not possess individually\u201d. Business-based resources\u2014that include small business orientation, social capital, and social networking links\u2014for family micro-businesses are critical strategic resources for competitive advantage. These resources are valuable, rare, hard to imitate, and hard to substitute [31] as they are based on culture, community environment, and family-entrepreneurship processes [32]. Family micro-businesses that operate a small business orientation are \u201cany business that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field, and does not engage in any new marketing or innovative practices\u201d [33]. The limited size of agritourism markets may be unattractive to large businesses. Thus, small family agritourism firms may be more stable and prosperous in niches with less competition [34]. Social capital as a business resource is a core resource or group of social assets that performers utilize to track their interests through the membership of social networks/structures [35], which can facilitate mutual collaboration between individuals [36]. Based on the social capital theory, family\nMathematics 2023, 11, 359 4 of 15\nmicro-businesses can benefit from social capital in sharing information, working toward joint goals with the community, and creating trust among group members [20]. On the other hand, as the third business resource, social network ties may be a precursor to forming possible social capital, yet \u201cthey are not equivalent or interchangeable terms\u201d [37]. These social network ties are more significant to micro-businesses and those in the difficult conditions seen in rural areas [38]. Based on SET, we argue that the business-based resources of family micro-businesses (social network ties, small business orientation, and social capital) involve many economic and socio-emotional resource exchanges between microbusinesses and the community. Therefore, they are vital to boosting these micro-businesses\u2019 success in particular, and the agritourism performance in general [39]. Thus, we can propose the below hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1 (H1). Family micro-business resources have a relationship with agritourism performance.\nContact in tourism occurs between tourists and hosts, other guests, service providers, and fellow tourists [40]. Positive communication between service providers and their guests or residents is the most important of these contacts and can boost friendly attitudes and good behaviors, which are essential for the success of any tourism business [41,42]. In the agritourism sector, farm owners themselves are the owners of agritourism businesses in many cases [43]. Thus, the residents feel psychological ownership of these businesses. According to the affective events theory (AET), when locals experience psychological ownership of the family micro-businesses, they support them and express their loyalty. This is because of their psychological connection with the businesses [44,45]. Given the nature of the resources on which family micro-businesses depend and which require a lot of exchanges of interests between these businesses and the residents, resident\u2013micro-business interaction has become significant [40]. Therefore, we introduce the below hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2 (H2). Family micro-business resources have a relationship with resident\u2013microbusiness interaction.\nThe positive social contact and interactions inherent in agritourism between agritourism operators and local residents associate strongly and positively with profitability and successful agritourism endeavors [46]. In the same vein, such interactions can succeed in the mutual objectives of exchanging economic and socio-emotional resources among agritourism entrepreneurs and local communities and reinforce collaborative dual partnerships between agritourism companies [47]. Aiming to assess the contribution of resident\u2013microbusiness interaction to enhancing agritourism performance, we hypothesize that:\nHypothesis 3 (H3). Resident\u2013micro-business interactions have a relationship with agritourism performance.\nLocal communities\u2019 perceptions of tourism benefits affect their support for tourism development [48]. Furthermore, locals dependent on the tourist business or perceiving a more significant economic benefit have a more favorable impression of tourism\u2019s economic influence than other residents [49]. Although economic benefits were a crucial indicator, social and emotional factors better predicted local residents\u2019 support for tourism development [50]. Hence, we argue that resident\u2013micro-business interaction, besides the participation of the residents in tourism development, demonstrates the economic, social, and emotional benefits of agritourism development, thus increasing societal support for agritourism and improving its performance. On this basis, the following two hypotheses were derived (as seen in Figure 2).\nMathematics 2023, 11, 359 5 of 15\nMathematics 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 16 Hypothesis 3 (H3): Resident\u2013micro-business interactions have a relationship with agritourism performance.\nLocal communities\u2019 perceptions of tourism benefits affect their support for tourism development [48].

Thus, the host\u2019s perception of the unique personal benefits from tourism is also essential in the context of residents\u2019 interaction with agritourism operators [7]. Therefore, personal resident benefits significantly affect the link between family micro-business resources and resident\u2013microbusiness interaction. Thus, we developed the hypothesis:\nHypothesis 8 (H8).

Finally, the PRB (personal resident benefit) was measured using the eight-item scale proposed by Vukovic et al. [7]. A Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was employed.

Furthermore, the average variance extracted (AVE) values exceeded the value of 0.50, which approves convergent validity [54]. Finally, three main indices were checked to test discriminant validity: (1) cross-loading, (2) the Fronell-Larcker index, and (3) the heterotrait-monotrait value (HTMT).

The Mediating Effect of RMI and SAD in the Tested Model One of the paper\u2019s basic purposes was to evaluate the mediating effects of RMI and SAD on the link between FM and AP. Concerning H7, the results prove that the impact of RMI as a single mediating variable in the link between FM and AP is significant and positive. Finally, the empirical evidence obtained allows us to confirm that the sequential mediation exerted by the RMI and SAD variables indirectly influences the relationship between FM and AP (H8). Based on the SET and the non-zero-sum games theory, the significance of mediation can be justified, whether single or sequential. Given the residents\u2019 sense of psychological ownership of family micro-businesses in rural destinations, we assert that the resident\u2013micro-business interaction is effective and supports the development and performance of agritourism (single mediation) [45]. Regarding sequential mediation, with the positive interaction and mutual interaction between residents and family micro-businesses, the individual's perception of the personal and societal benefits resulting from the development of tourism in rural destinations increases, and thus their support for agritourism increases, reflected in improving the agritourism performance [7,50]. By comparing the single and sequential mediations, we find that the indirect impact of the sequential mediation of RMI and SAD variables between FM and AP (\u03b2 = 0.205, p < 0.000) was more significant than the single mediation effect of RMI (\u03b2 = 0.095, p < 0.023) in the same relationship. In both cases, the mediation was partial. Hence, the resident\u2013microbusiness interaction must generate outcomes (economic and socio-emotional) that motivate the residents and communities to support tourism development to boost agritourism performance.

After ensuring that the study scale possesses adequate convergent and discriminant validity, the proposed hypotheses were tested. The results supported the direct association\nMathematics 2023, 11, 359 13 of 15\nbetween family micro-business resources (small business orientation, social capital, and social network ties) and agritourism performance. Additionally, the results highlighted the critical mediating roles of resident\u2013micro-business interaction and support for agritourism development in improving the tested direct relationships. Furthermore, the PLS-SEM result supported the moderating role of personal resident benefit in strengthening the tested interrelationships. These results are consistent with different previous study results, but the main contribution of our study is that it tested all of these relationships (direct, mediating, and moderating), for the first time, in one model employing a sophisticated data analysis technique (PLS-SEM), in one context (family micro-businesses in KSA), post COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies could employ a qualitative research design to improve and extend our understanding of how to enhance agritourism performance. Moreover, in future studies, other mediating dimensions (i.e., tourist satisfaction, resident satisfaction) can be explored to decide whether they can act as mediators in the relationship between FM and AP. In conclusion, it should be noted that this research was only conducted using a cross-sectional research strategy, and the results do not allow for the inference of a causal relationship. It would be beneficial to undertake longitudinal research in order to support or disprove the outcomes of the study.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, S.F. and A.M.S.A.; Software, A.M.A.; Writing\u2014original draft, I.A.E.; Writing\u2014review & editing, I.A.E., S.F. and A.M.S.A.; Supervision, I.A.E.; Funding acquisition, I.A.E. and A.M.S.A.
