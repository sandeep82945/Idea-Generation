 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct more clinical studies to obtain accurate urinary and fecal excretion rates for THC and its metabolites. This data is needed to better understand the distribution of the biomarkers between liquid and solid phases in wastewater. 

2. Perform sorption experiments with THC-COOH-D9 to study the behavior and distribution of THC-COOH between liquid and solid phases in wastewater under controlled conditions. This could provide insights into possible adsorption/desorption processes.

3. Analyze wastewater samples from diverse locations and times to evaluate spatial and temporal variations in the correction factor needed when measuring only the liquid phase. This could lead to a more robust correction factor.

4. Develop quick, simple, and inexpensive methods to quantify total suspended solids in wastewater samples. This could help normalize biomarker measurements and account for sample variability.

5. Conduct stability studies by spiking samples individually with THC, THC-OH, and THC-COOH to clarify whether interconversion of the compounds occurs during storage. This could optimize storage conditions.
