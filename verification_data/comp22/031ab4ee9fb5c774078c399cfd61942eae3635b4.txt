"Future works will focus on extending the proposed sensor taxonomy to include emerging sensor technologies and their data pre-processing needs. Additionally, we aim to refine the filter selection process by incorporating machine learning techniques to automatically determine the most suitable filter based on the sensor data characteristics. This will further enhance the efficiency of data pre-processing on IoT devices, reducing computational costs and improving the accuracy of the ML models developed from this data."
