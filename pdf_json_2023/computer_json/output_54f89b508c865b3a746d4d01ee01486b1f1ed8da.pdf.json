University College London Hospital\u2019s (UCLH) successful implementation of a digital maternity app, MyCare, gives women access to test results, information about appointments, and enables communication with healthcare professionals (HCPs). Yet, little is known about access and engagement among vulnerable pregnant women. Methodology: Research was conducted over a 3-month period (April\u2013June 2022) in the Maternity Department at UCLH, UK. MyCare datasets were analysed, and anonymised surveys completed by vulnerable pregnant women and HCPs. Results: Lower rates of utilisation and engagement with MyCare were seen in vulnerable pregnant women especially among refugee/asylum seekers, those with mental health issues, and those facing domestic violence. Non-users were also more likely to be individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with a lower average social-deprivation-index decile, whose first language was not English, and with a significant history of non-attendance to appointments. Patient and HCP surveys highlighted various barriers to MyCare engagement, including a lack of motivation, limited language options, low e-literacy levels, and complex app interfaces. Conclusion: The use of a single digital tool, without a formulated pathway to identify and assist those not accessing or engaging with it, risks unequal care provision which may exacerbate health inequalities. This research advances the idea that digital exclusion is not necessarily a matter of access to technology, but an issue of a lack of engagement with these tools. Therefore, vulnerable women and HCPs must be integral to the implementation of digital strategies, to ensure no one is left behind.\nKEYWORDS\nelectronic health records systems, pregnancy, e-health, technology, vulnerable pregnant women, digital divide\nAbbreviations App, Application; BMI, Body Mass Index; DNA, Did Not Attend; EPIC, Electronic Health Records System; HCP, Healthcare Professional; SDI, Social Deprivation Index; UCLH, University College London Hospital.\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "To improve health outcomes and support national targets in the Long-Term Plan (1), the NHS has transitioned towards harnessing digital technology. The Maternity Transformation Programme (2) advocates for this as the main driving force in achieving the visions outlined in the Better Births Report (3), such as patient-centred care and tailored support for healthcare workers. The adoption of digital services has helped to streamline healthcare data, prioritise patient autonomy, encourage patient engagement, and empower both patients and healthcare providers (4). However, those who have most to gain from these provisions may often not be the people accessing them (5), and it is important to consider whether the digitalisation of healthcare may inadvertently perpetuate health inequalities for those at risk of poor health outcomes.\nResearch from Birth Companions revealed that pregnant women experiencing severe and multiple disadvantages are at a heightened risk for poor maternal and fetal health outcomes (6). Findings from the 2021 MBRRACE Maternal Report revealed that 8% of maternal deaths, documented in the UK between the years 2016\u2013 18, were of women facing ensuing social complexities, such as mental health diagnoses, substance misuse, and domestic violence (7). Vulnerability in pregnancy has been widely attributed to socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities (8), and as a result, the poorest maternal health outcomes are primarily seen among Black and South Asian women living in the most socially deprived areas (9). Social vulnerability is also correlated with higher rates of missed antenatal appointments (10, 11). Suboptimal antenatal care, alongside a myriad of other factors contributing to vulnerability, can lead to adverse outcomes such as the high rates of stillbirth seen in vulnerable women (12).\nPregnancy app usage has become routine in most women\u2019s maternity experience (13), emerging as primary tools for the provision of pregnancy information (14). Globally, pregnancy apps far outnumber other medical apps in the public domain (15), attesting to their appeal and popularity. While there is currently limited research to show the implications of pregnancy apps on maternal and fetal outcomes, in other medical contexts patient portal apps have been shown to \u201cenhance the doctorpatient relationship, improve health status awareness, and increase adherence to healthcare in general\u201d (16). It is still unclear, however, as to what extent patient portal apps address the needs of vulnerable women.\nThe most apparent barrier to the use of digital apps is the reliance on physical access to the internet and a smartphone. Furthermore, disparities in access and usage are compounded if individuals are then faced with language barriers or e-literacy difficulties. Existing research reveals that these barriers are notably more present among lower-socioeconomic and marginalised groups (17), alongside itinerant populations such as refugees, asylum seekers, and those experiencing homelessness (18). There is also robust evidence to show disabled people being significantly more at risk of digital exclusion (19). Additionally, there may be less engagement with apps from those who are\nFrontiers in Digital Health 02\ngenerally less likely to engage with healthcare services, specifically those with mental health issues (20). Furthermore, studies show that those with lower education attainment levels, and those who are socially isolated and/or disabled, also express a lack of interest and negative attitudes towards the adoption of digital technology (19, 21).\nThis research sought to investigate the impact of digital health on vulnerable pregnant women in University College London Hospital (UCLH), a university-affiliated tertiary centre with a large and diverse patient population and approximately 6,000 births annually (22). In 2019, UCLH introduced an electronic health records system (EPIC), streamlining clinical health information. The maternity department became one of the first in the Trust to go entirely paperless when it piloted MyCare, the patient portal app tethered to EPIC. The intended rationale was to fulfil the needs of an already very engaged patient group, giving women access to test results, information about appointments and health-related updates, and enabling communication with healthcare professionals (HCPs). Attesting to its popularity, a recent audit revealed 97% of pregnant women had downloaded the app, but engagement levels or information about those who had not downloaded it was difficult to identify from routine reporting metrics."

            "text": "This mixed-methods research was conducted over a 3-month period (April- June 2022) in the Maternity Department at UCLH, London, UK.\nThe overarching aims of this research were to quantify the use of MyCare, an electronic patient portal, among pregnant women, and to investigate whether any disparities existed relating to patients\u2019 socio-demographics or characteristics. This was evaluated through collection and analysis of datasets examining pregnant women\u2019s access to, and engagement with, MyCare.\nIn addition, this work aimed to gain insight into vulnerable pregnant women\u2019s views about using MyCare, and to identify the perceived utility of portal features alongside any potential barriers to adoption and engagement. The study also aimed to gain a broad overview of the HCP response to its implementation, noting any proposed improvements for the app. These insights were obtained through anonymised surveys completed by vulnerable pregnant women and HCPs.\nTo identify vulnerable pregnant women across all datasets, \u201cvulnerability\u201d was identified using the \u201cComplex Social Factors in the Perinatal Period (Version 3)\u201d UCLH guideline (23), adapted from the 2010 NICE guidelines on \u201cPregnancy and Social Factors\u201d (24). The list of factors which would identify an individual as being vulnerable (vulnerability markers) includes women experiencing domestic violence; women with an existing enduring mental health illness; young women under the age of 19 years or with a history of having been in local authority care as a child; women who are currently involved with social services or have previously had children removed from their care; women who misuse substances\nfrontiersin.org\n(both alcohol and drugs); women with a learning disability; women with a physical disability; women who are homeless; women whose status is unclear, such as failed asylum seekers, recent migrants or women who have no recourse to public funds; women who have been trafficked or face abuse such as Modern Slavery; women who have difficulty reading or speaking English; and women involved with the criminal justice system.\nDataset 1\u2014engagement with MyCare\nThis dataset included all pregnant women booked into UCLH for their initial antenatal appointment in February 2022, identified through the EPIC platform. Age, parity, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and postcode data were collected from the patient\u2019s profile. Ethnicity was classified based on the ethnic groups identified in the 2021 Government Census (25). Postcodes were used to calculate the corresponding social deprivation index (SDI) deciles (26). These range from the most deprived 10% (Decile 1), to the least deprived 10% (Decile 10). Additional variables collected from the patient\u2019s profile were vulnerability (Y/N), with reasons for identified vulnerability (vulnerability markers); whether English was a first language, with \u201cthe need for an interpreter\u201d used as a proxy for this; and whether MyCare had been downloaded, and corresponding engagement levels. Information regarding MyCare was established from the MyCare icon on the patient\u2019s profile. MyCare engagement was calculated by accessing an individual\u2019s MyCare usage data on their EPIC profile, and counting the number of messages read on the app. This was divided by the number of messages sent to the patient and recorded as a percentage. 50% was used as the arbitrary margin for categorising the level of engagement, high engagement being \u226550%, and low engagement being <50%. This metric was chosen as a measure of patient engagement, as messages sent to patients on MyCare are the main mechanism for receiving direct messages sent by HCPs but also for notifying patients about other information available to view on the app. This includes upcoming appointments, test results ready to be viewed, general information, health advice, and upcoming changes to service delivery. In addition to this metric, the number of messages sent by patients to HCPs was also determined.\nDataset 2\u2014MyCare not downloaded\nThis dataset included the medical record numbers of all women who received maternity care at UCLH after the implementation of MyCare in 2019, but who had never downloaded it during their pregnancy. The same variables were collected as in dataset 1, in addition to the number of nonattendances to appointments (DNAs), if any.\nIndividuals were excluded from further analysis if they had had an early miscarriage or termination of pregnancy, were transferred to another hospital, or if the patient had only attended one tertiary fetal medicine appointment and received their main antenatal care elsewhere.\nFrontiers in Digital Health 03"

The items (i.e., questions) in the survey asked general questions about English competency, access to technology, regular use of technology, and any previous usage of pregnancy apps/patient portals. Furthermore, specific questions about MyCare were asked such as: how they learnt about it; whether they had downloaded it; whether they received any support to download it; whether they would have liked more training on how to use it; what their interest levels towards it are and why; what their frequency of usage is; what their reason for usage based on app features; and if they had any suggestions for improvements, which would indirectly introduce any perceived barriers to usage.\nA sample size was not predetermined. The intention was to cease recruitment of participants when data saturation was achieved. This was defined as no new sub-themes emerging from thematic analysis of the two open questions pertaining to interest levels and ways to improve the app. After completion of 22 surveys, it transpired that significant repetition of concepts was occurring; hence it was proposed that further sampling would not yield new insights addressing the primary aim of the patient surveys in identifying interest levels and any barriers.\nSurvey completion took place at UCLH on the maternity wards and within antenatal clinics. Purposive sampling was undertaken by selecting potential participants based on acquired knowledge of their characteristics and background. HCPs were asked to identify willing participants based on the following inclusion criteria:\ni. Pregnant women currently booked into the UCLH Maternity\nService and\nii. Older than 18 years and iii. Vulnerable (defined using the \u201cComplex Social Factors in the\nPerinatal Period (Version 3)\u201d UCLH guideline (23).\nDataset 4\u2014HCP surveys\nThis survey aimed to assess HCPs\u2019 views towards the implementation of EPIC and MyCare, and to explore their involvement with MyCare development, noting any suggestions for optimising the utility of the app. It included 10 questions, with a mixed-style approach similar to that of the patient surveys\nfrontiersin.org\nabove. The questions in the survey gathered information on their job title; the usability and usefulness of EPIC; whether they had seen MyCare from a patient\u2019s perspective; whether they ask for patient feedback, and how they process this information; how they think it can be improved to help vulnerable pregnant women; how they think it can be improved to help them deliver care; and how interested they are in the ongoing development of EPIC and MyCare within maternity care.\nOpportunity sampling was employed by approaching all HCPs working within the Maternity Department who were willing and able to take part. Recruitment of participants was terminated when no new sub-themes emerged from qualitative analysis of the two open questions. These questions included the suggestions for improvement of MyCare for both vulnerable pregnant women and HCPs delivering care to this population.\nFor both HCPs and vulnerable pregnant women, paper-based surveys were distributed. Information about the research was verbally explained to participants, and this information was also available to read on the survey. For patients who required an interpreter, face-to-face translators were arranged. Participants were given time to read both the information about the research and the specific survey questions. They were then re-approached at a later point to obtain informed verbal consent and subsequently complete the survey.\nData analysis of patient and HCP surveys\nThe variety of question types allowed for a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data to be obtained. Ordinal and nominal data were analysed using frequency statistics, through the Sort and Filter function on Microsoft Excel. The responses to the open questions were analysed using an inductive thematic approach to establish commonly communicated answers. Researchers read responses and made notes independently before defining preliminary codes. These codes were then developed and applied to the open-question text. This content analysis encompassed Braun and Clarke\u2019s 6-step framework (27)."

Prior\nFrontiers in Digital Health 04\nto data analysis, 14 individuals were excluded (8 miscarried early, 3 had a termination of pregnancy, and 3 had transferred care to another hospital). The remaining population group (N = 636) were divided into 3 categories dependent on their MyCare status and activity: (1) \u226550% engagement, (2) <50% engagement, and (3) MyCare not downloaded. For those with MyCare downloaded, the average number of messages sent to patients was 40, with the average number of messages sent from patients to HCPs being 0.48. Engagement with MyCare was assessed through the percentage of messages read by the patient out of the total number of messages received. Participants were notified on their phone, or other specified device, if they received a message on MyCare.\nTable 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics and\nvulnerability markers for Categories 1, 2, and 3.\nAcross Categories 1 and 2 the average age was similar (33 and 34 respectively), whereas Category 3 had a lower average age (30).\nThere was a link between a higher average parity and lower engagement or non-use of MyCare, with the average parity being 0.94, 1.47, and 1.78 in categories 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\nThere was no clear relationship between MyCare engagement and average BMI across the 3 categories, with BMI being 24.8, 25.8, and 25.5 in categories 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\nThere was an association between higher rates of vulnerability and lower engagement or non-use of MyCare, with the percentage of vulnerable individuals being 19.7%, 26%, and 48.7% in categories 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\nMental health issues, alongside physical and learning disabilities, were the most prevalent vulnerabilities within the low engagement category (Category 2). Mental health issues, domestic violence, and refugee/asylum seeker status were the most prevalent vulnerabilities in the group who did not have MyCare (Category 3).\nThe percentages of women whose first language was not English were similar across the high and low engagement categories (24.4% and 23.3% respectively), however, the percentage was considerably higher for those without MyCare (48.7%).\nThe average SDI deciles were similar across the high and low engagement categories (4.75 and 4.76 respectively), however, for those without MyCare, the average SDI decile was lower (3.72).\nIn terms of ethnicity, white women made up the greatest proportion of the high engagement category (58.2% of Category 1), whereas all ethnic groups combined (Asian, Black, Mixed, or other ethnic background) made up most of the low engagement category (57.5% of Category 2). In those who did not have MyCare (Category 3), the majority were White Jewish (46.2%), warranting a distinction from those of a white background (7.6%). The remainder were predominantly those from an ethnic background (Asian, Black, or other ethnic background) (46.2%).\nDataset 2\u2014MyCare not downloaded\nIn dataset 2 there were 499 women in the cohort, of which 249 were excluded for the following reasons: 169 attended only one\nfrontiersin.org\nfetal medicine appointment, 10 were identified as having since downloaded MyCare, 33 miscarried early, 27 had transferred care to another hospital, and 10 had a termination of pregnancy.\nOf the 250 women who were included in the dataset, 51.2% were White Jewish, with the remainder being predominantly from an ethnic background (Asian, Black, Mixed, or other ethnic background) (40%). The average age was 30.6, the average parity was 2.49, and the average BMI was 26.7.\nOut of the 250 women, 151 (60.4%) had a history of DNAs, from anywhere between 2 and 22 DNAs to antenatal appointments.\nFor the proportion of those who were White Jewish (n = 128), HCPs explicitly outlined in patient notes that they did not have MyCare due non-ownership of a smartphone for religious reasons. Further analysis excluded this cohort and only included those who did not have a clearly documented reason for non-use of MyCare (N = 122).\nTABLE 2 The sociodemographic characteristics and vulnerability markers for those without a documented reason for MyCare non-use.\nTotal (N) Percentage of total (%) 122 \u2013\nAverage Age (years) 30.9 \u2013 Average Parity (n) 2.32 \u2013 Average BMI (kg/m2) 26.9 \u2013 Vulnerable 98 80.3 English not first language 81 66.4 DNA (High non-attendance rate) 88 72.1 Ethnic Minority 99 81.1 Average SDI decile 3.85 \u2013\nFrontiers in Digital Health 05\nFurther analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and vulnerability markers was carried out on this remaining cohort (N = 122), as seen in Table 2.\nThe average age was 30.9, the average parity was 2.32, and the\naverage BMI was 26.9.\nVulnerability, English not being a first language, and being from an ethnic minority background were all factors associated with non-use of MyCare. Refugee/asylum seeker status, mental health issues, and domestic violence were identified as the most common vulnerabilities. For the 88 women with a history of DNAs, 38% had patient notes outlining that they were unaware of their appointments.

Midwives made up 58.1% of the cohort, with doctors 27.4%, and nurses, student midwives, pharmacists, and administration staff making up the remainder.\n91.9% of HCPs said that EPIC is easy to use, with all respondents finding EPIC and MyCare to be helpful in the delivery of their care. 30 HCPs answered the follow-up question as to why, with 46.7% stating that it allowed them to have\nhat represent participants\u2019 reasoning behind their interest levels towards\ngreater engagement with their patients, and 53.3% stating that it enabled better distribution of information to patients.\nDespite this, 87.1% of HCPs had never seen MyCare from the patient perspective. Furthermore, 6 HCPs said they asked patients for feedback, with 5 of these stating that they did not know who to report this information back to. Of those who did not ask patients for feedback regarding MyCare, 7 said this was not necessary given that they worked on a labour ward, 3 said this was not a requirement of their role (1 pharmacist, 1 hospital administrator, and 1 nurse), and 2 said it was redundant, given that there is an in-app function for obtaining feedback from patients. The remaining 44 did not give a reason as to why they did not ask patients for feedback about MyCare.\nHCPs were asked to what extent they thought MyCare was suitable as a platform for vulnerable pregnant women to use. 10 HCPs expressed that MyCare was not suitable at all (16.1%), alongside 32 stating it was suitable some of the time (51.6%). In contrast, 11 expressed that MyCare was suitable most of the time (17.7%), yet 0 stated that it was suitable all the time. 9 were impartial (14.5%).\nTwo open questions were merged and thematically analysed. One related to suggestions for improvement of MyCare for vulnerable pregnant women, and the other related to suggestions to help make MyCare more suitable for HCPs to deliver care to this population. Table 4 shows the themes identified from the text."

            "text": "MyCare has rapidly become the primary channel through which women can access antenatal services in a busy tertiary London maternity hospital. However, data shows some poor engagement and lack of access in vulnerable groups. It can be inferred from our findings that MyCare gives an additional advantage to those who are already able to engage with maternity care. Exclusive digitisation risks overlooking vulnerable women, who are more likely to be in greater need. Steps must be taken to ensure that digital interventions are inclusive of all women and truly fit for purpose.\nt represent participants\u2019 suggestions for MyCare improvement.\nPrincipal findings from datasets 1 and 2\nThe datasets illustrated a strong association between vulnerable pregnant women and lower rates of utilisation and engagement with MyCare, with the most prominent vulnerabilities emerging as those with refugee/asylum seeker status, those with mental health issues, and those facing domestic violence. Poor engagement with MyCare was also linked to those with disabilities, corroborating findings from studies that show this group to be at risk for digital exclusion (19). In addition, nonusers of MyCare were more likely to be from ethnic minority backgrounds, with a lower average SDI decile, whose first language was not English, and with a significant history of nonattendance to antenatal appointments. These factors have all been robustly linked to adverse health outcomes and inequalities (8, 28, 29).\nAcross both datasets, White Jewish women made up a large proportion of individuals not using or engaging with MyCare. Studies show that the Orthodox Jewish community has less exposure to technology as their culture can impose restrictions on the possession of smartphones (30). This was a recognised barrier and documented by HCPs, but also demonstrates the need to pay closer attention to the needs of different communities when creating digital tools.\nInterestingly, there was no documentation of the reason for any other population that did not have MyCare. As a result, HCPs were sending information and appointment details through the app to those who did not even have it downloaded. Correspondingly, patients reported not knowing they had appointments booked. Notably, a strong link between MyCare non-use and DNAs emerged in the data, consistent with studies showing higher rates of missed appointments among non-patient portal users (31). In addition, studies show non-attendance to antenatal appointments as an indicator of vulnerability (10, 11) and have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (32).\nIn addition, whilst vulnerability and digital exclusion were shown to be intrinsically linked, they were not mutually exclusive. Individuals who are not engaging with digital tools, irrespective of whether they are vulnerable or not, may experience disruptions in care, as seen in the high nonattendance rates shown in the results. As a result, they may be at greater risk of poorer health outcomes (33). This will become more pertinent if digital tools begin to replace, instead of complement, current services, particularly if there are not sufficient alternatives in place for those who are not accessing them. Such criticisms validate arguments for digital technology heightening existing social inequalities for those who are already vulnerable (34), but it may also create further disparities of its own."

            "text": "Levels of interest in MyCare were polarised among vulnerable pregnant women. In practice, higher levels of interest did not translate to high engagement levels.\nFrontiers in Digital Health 08\nWhen considering the reasons why people did not engage with MyCare, physical barriers, such as ownership of a smartphone, appeared to have an even smaller impact than speculated in previous research (35). The primary barriers to use pertained to patients\u2019 lack of willingness and motivation. These barriers may be mitigated by evaluating the usability of the app (36).\nFindings have corroborated existing research that shows complex app interfaces and limited language options to be significant barriers to use of digital tools (17, 37). Findings revealed that some husbands were using and monitoring MyCare on the woman\u2019s behalf because they were the only ones who could understand English. By not satisfying language requirements, confidentiality is compromised, which has been linked to negative health outcomes (38). Although the manufacturer of MyCare states that other languages are available, this is not a recognised function in the current set-up and HCPs feel unqualified to offer it, as evidenced in survey responses.\nSome negative perceptions towards MyCare due to privacy concerns were revealed. Notably, fears regarding data sharing have been shown to be more prevalent among ethnic minorities (39) and have been shown to influence engagement with healthcare (40). HCP communication skills may be pivotal in addressing these concerns, by facilitating patient use of MyCare alongside enhancing patient trust in providers.\nIn addition, participants expressed criticism of the app\u2019s complex interface. Promoting engagement relies on providing training to women. However, a lack of engagement may also relate to the usability of the MyCare platform, in that the diverse needs of vulnerable women have not been considered in app design and delivery of information about how to use it (41). Despite MyCare having an extensive range of functionality, in practice vulnerable groups are only accessing a small percentage of this.\nHCPs play an important role in the implementation of MyCare, however, the findings suggest that they may not realise how significant their influence can be on patient engagement. Most HCPs had never seen the app from the patient perspective, nor had they ever asked patients about their experiences and concerns regarding it. This is a very strong indicator that the promotion for engagement should start with HCPs. HCP advocacy can influence patient behaviour by increasing their \u201cknowledge, confidence, and self-determination\u201d (42). This can provide patients with the tools to feel empowered to take an active role in their own care. HCPs need to spend more time promoting the benefits of MyCare to patients, anticipating issues that might arise, and emphasising confidentiality of data and autonomy. Clear communication with patients, alongside listening to their concerns, has the potential to reduce disparities in patient usage of these digital tools (43).\nGiving women the physical tools to access digital tools is ineffective as a standalone solution if barriers such as a lack of motivation; limited knowledge of, or confidence in, digital tools; limited language options; low e-literacy skills; complex app interface, and usability are not considered. This research advances the idea that digital exclusion is not necessarily a matter of access to technology, but an issue of a lack of engagement with these tools (44).\nfrontiersin.org"

            "text": "The views expressed in the patient surveys may not be generalisable, as the small sample is unlikely to reflect the full spectrum of vulnerable patients. However, these findings do not necessarily need to be statistically generalisable for researchers to draw inferences that can advance and improve MyCare in ways that support vulnerable pregnant women. Furthermore, as the research was based at UCLH, the findings may not be applicable to other health care settings. Additionally, the use of SDI as an indicator for deprivation was not an absolute measure. It does not capture whether a specific individual is deprived. For example, in datasets 1 and 2, several pregnant refugees had an SDI of 7+, as they had been placed in temporary hotels in less deprived areas. SDI was therefore used as a general measure of social deprivation and results should be interpreted with this knowledge in mind. Lastly, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between the observed associations as there is a potential for unmeasured confounding variables. Factors such as the duration of UK residence, health literacy, and education attainment were not collected, all of which may influence MyCare engagement."

Furthermore, the tangible impact of MyCare and how it relates to targeted health behaviours and patient-centred outcomes should be evaluated. In addition, further reviews should be conducted on patient portals used in other hospitals and any emerging trends and findings should be compared."

Therefore, it might be relevant to facilitate training that encompasses learning about MyCare from the patients\u2019 perspective, alongside incorporating information on how to solicit feedback from patients and who to report this to. The findings also demonstrate an interest among vulnerable pregnant women for the implementation of digital tools within maternity care. An adapted version of MyCare, considering all the pragmatic and culturally sensitive suggestions highlighted in the surveys, has the potential to foster uptake and engagement. In addition, further strategies to engage vulnerable women could include training sessions early in antenatal care that clearly clarify the role of MyCare in maternity care, how best to utilise it, and to identify and address any potential issues that may dissuade patients from engaging. Overall, the success of MyCare\nFrontiers in Digital Health 09\nand digital health requires synergy between HCPs and patients as empowering both groups is critical in realising any benefits associated with patient portals."

            "text": "Digital tools, such as the MyCare patient portal, offer opportunities to reduce exclusion through wider provision of information, greater interactive contact with HCPs, and the opportunity for self-management of care. Yet the use of a single digital tool, without a formulated pathway to identify and assist those not accessing or engaging with it, risks unequal care provision which may exacerbate health inequalities. The results of this research demonstrate that giving women the physical tools to download the app is ineffective as a standalone solution if other barriers limit their ability to use and engage with it. Therefore, vulnerable women and HCPs must be integral to the implementation of digital strategies, to ensure no one is left behind."
