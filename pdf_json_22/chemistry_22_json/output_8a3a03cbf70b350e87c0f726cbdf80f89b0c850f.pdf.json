While the machinery involved in mitophagy 15 induction is well known, the regulation of the components is less clear. For example, it is still 16 unknown how the ULK1 complex is dissociated prior to closing of the autophagosome. Here, 17 using Chemically Inducible Dimerization (CID) and mitophagy assays with the fluorescent probe 18 mtKeima, we reveal that the ubiquitin binding domain-containing protein TNIP1 is able to 19 induce mitophagy when ectopically targeted to mitochondria. Conversely, we demonstrate that 20 TNIP1 knock down accelerates mitophagy rates, and that ectopic TNIP1 negatively regulates the 21 rate of mitophagy. These functions of TNIP1 depend on a previously unrecognized, 22 evolutionarily conserved LIR motif as well as its AHD3 domain, which are required for binding 23 to the ULK1 complex member FIP200 and the autophagy receptor TAX1BP1, respectively. 24 Taken together, our findings identify a novel negative regulator of mitophagy that acts at the 25 early steps of autophagosome biogenesis and provide a molecular rationale for how the ULK1 26 complex might be dissociated from the closing autophagosome. 27 28\nIntro 29 Macroautophagy, one of the main cellular degradation pathways, sequesters cytosolic 30 components inside a double membrane structure called an autophagosome, that matures, closes 31 and catabolizes its content by fusing to lysosomes. The molecular mechanisms of the formation 32 and maturation processes are well described and revolve around a set of proteins called the ATG 33 conjugation system1. Initially described as a non-selective degradation process triggered when 34 cells face starvation, more recent work shows autophagy can selectively eliminate certain 35 proteins, protein aggregates and organelles2,3. Selective autophagy is the specific sequestration of 36 cytosolic structures mediated via autophagy receptors. The main feature of these autophagy 37 receptors is their capacity to bind to mATG8 (mammalian ATG8 proteins) as well as FIP200 and 38 to ubiquitin in most cases4. One of the best characterized selective autophagy processes is the 39\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The PINK1/Parkin axis of mitophagy participates 40 in a feed-forward loop involving stabilization of the kinase PINK1, phosphorylation of resident 41 ubiquitinated proteins at the surface of the mitochondria prior to recruitment of the E3 ligase 42 Parkin, followed by activation of Parkin by its phosphorylation by PINK1. Autophagy receptors 43 such as NDP52 or OPTN are subsequently recruited to ubiquitinated mitochondria via their 44 ubiquitin-binding domains, allowing the autophagy machinery to assemble and degrade the 45 mitochondria in a wholesale fashion6,7. 46 TNIP1 (TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1), also called ABIN1 (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-\u03baB 47 activation 1) participates in the NF-\u03baB pathway, where it negatively regulates NF-\u03baB activation, 48 acting as a security check to maintain immune homeostasis8,9. Structurally, TNIP1 possesses a 49 Ub-binding domain (UBAN domain \u2013 Ubiquitin binding of ABIN and NEMO) common among 50 ABIN proteins, 3 Abin homology domains (AHD) and a NEMO binding domain (NBD)8,10. 51 Although the AHD3 domain function is currently not described, AHD1 mediates binding with 52 the ubiquitin editing enzyme Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, A20) 53 and AHD4 mediates the interaction with OPTN11. TNIP1 also interacts with TAX1BP1, together 54 with A20 to restrict antiviral signaling12. Being involved in immune responses, dysregulation of 55 TNIP1 was shown to be implicated in various human diseases in a number of genome-wide 56 associated studies (GWAS)13. TNIP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been strongly 57 associated with autoimmune diseases14. Furthermore, cross ethnic genetic studies identified the 58 GPX3-TNIP1 locus to associate with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)15. A later study 59 concluded that this locus was less likely to contribute to ALS risk16. In addition, a recent GWAS 60 study identified TNIP1 at the locus as a newly identified risk allele for Alzheimer\u2019s disease 61 (AD)17. 62 To date, a role of TNIP1 in regulating mitophagy has not been described. Here we define the 63 implication of TNIP1 as an LC3-interacting protein, that is able to trigger mitophagy when 64 synthetically targeted to mitochondria, and that normally negatively inhibits early stages of 65 mitophagy. Usp30 also inhibits mitophagy and is a promising drug targtet to increase 66 mitochondrial quality control18. Furthermore, we show that physical interaction of TNIP1 with 67 the ULK1 complex member FIP200, as well as with TAX1BP1, drives mitophagy inhibition. 68 Our study suggests that the autophagy protein TAX1BP1 and FIP200 are not only involved in 69 promoting mitophagy, but are also crucial targets for autophagy inhibition. 70 71\nResults 72 Ectopic localization of TNIP1 to the mitochondria induces mitophagy. 73 TNIP1 possesses a UBAN domain similar to that in OPTN19,20 and was suggested to be an 74 autophagy substrate21. In addition, TNIP1 was previously shown to form a complex with 75 TAX1BP1 in a non-autophagy context12. Thus, we investigated whether TNIP1 is involved in 76 mitophagy by interaction with TAX1BP1. However, HeLa cells express TNIP1 and knockout of 77 all five mitophagy receptors (OPTN, p62, TAX1BP1, NBR1 and NDP52) completely blocks 78 mitophagy, indicating that TNIP1 is unlikely to act alone in mitophagy induction or its function 79\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Therefore, we took advantage of the chemically induced 80 dimerization (CID) assay in cells expressing mtKeima22 (Figure 1A). We fused the protein FRB 81 to the C-terminus tail of the outer mitochondrial protein FIS1 and TNIP1 to the soluble protein 82 FKBP. Adding the small molecule RAPALOG induces dimerization of FRB and FKBP, 83 artificially localizing TNIP1 to the mitochondria. Interestingly, localizing TNIP1 to mitochondria 84 for 24 Hrs induced robust mitophagy (Figure 1B). TNIP1 with the UBAN loss of function 85 mutation (D472N) was able to trigger mitophagy to levels similar to WT TNIP1, indicating that 86 the ubiquitin binding domain of TNIP1 is not necessary for inducing mitophagy when TNIP1 is 87 artificially targeted to mitochondria. 88 Mammalian cells possess 3 TNIP homologs, TNIP1, TNIP2 and TNIP3, sharing certain ABIN 89 homology domains (AHDs) that characterize them (Figure 1C). The AHD1 domain has been 90 shown to be essential for interacting with A20/TNFAIP3, a central gatekeeper in inflammation 91 and immunity. CID and FACS analysis with TNIP2 and TNIP3 revealed that they were not able 92 to induce mitophagy as substantially as TNIP1, indicating the singular role of TNIP1 in 93 mitophagy. To further characterize the important domains of TNIP1, we carried out CID with 94 versions of TNIP1 missing individual AHD domains. AHD1 deletion had no effect on 95 mitophagy, suggesting that binding to A20 is not necessary for its role in mitophagy. TNIP1 with 96 the AHD3 deletion showed a strong reduction in its ability to induce mitophagy, while deletion 97 of AHD4 domain in TNIP1 showed moderate inhibitory effect on mitophagy (Figure 1D). Both 98 N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of TNIP1 (Figure 1E) proved incapable of inducing 99 mitophagy, indicating that bipartite domains are involved in mitophagy and AHD3 domain is 100 essential. 101 To determine the molecular mechanisms of TNIP1 in mitophagy, we carried CID-induced 102 mitophagy in different cellular backgrounds: FIP200 KO, WIPI2 KO, A20 KO and pentaKO22 103 cells (NDP52, OPTN, TAX1BP1, SQSTM1 and NBR1). PentaKO (5KO) cells were previously 104 described to be deficient in mitophagy, owing to the dependence on recruitment of autophagy 105 receptors to recruit the autophagy machinery. To our surprise, TNIP1 was able to mediate 106 mitophagy in 5KO cells at a level similar to that in WT cells (Supp Figure 1A). This implies 107 that TNIP1 is able to recruit an essential effector of the autophagy machinery on its own and 108 does not depend on further recruitment of autophagy receptors previously deemed critical for 109 mitophagy response, including TAX1BP1. In FIP200 KO and WIPI2 KO cells, no mitophagy 110 was observed (Supp Figure 1A), consistent with their essential roles in general autophagy 111 machineries. Because of the tight role TNIP1 plays with A20 in the NF-\u03baB pathway, we 112 explored mitophagy activation in an A20 KO background (Supp Figure 1A). Consistent with the 113 results seen with the AHD1 deletion mutant, A20 KO did not alter the mitophagy response, 114 supporting the idea that TNIP1\u2019s role in CID induced mitophagy does not depend on A20, and 115 revealing a new activity of TNIP1 distinct from prior work on its role in inflammation. 116 Mitophagy independent of autophagy receptors (5KO) indicates that TNIP1 likely acts 117 downstream of or in parallel with autophagy receptor recruitment and can recruit mATG8 and 118\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Unfortunately, owing to the size of FIP200, we could not produce a 122 functioning FKBP-GFP-FIP200 construct. Consequently, we assessed whether other autophagy 123 machinery proteins (i.e. WIPI2 and ATG16L1), as well as A20 were able to trigger mitophagy 124 when placed on mitochondria in WT or TNIP1 KO cells. As previously reported, CID with 125 ATG16L1 showed a strong mitophagy response in control cells7. TNIP1 KO did not impair that 126 response, and even slightly enhanced this response (Supp Figure 1B). Similarly, CID with 127 WIPI2 displayed a robust mitophagy response and this response was stronger in TNIP1 KO cells 128 (Supp Figure 1B). Finally, CID with A20 displayed a weak mitophagy response that was 129 abolished in TNIP1 KO cells (Supp Figure 1B). This could be explained by a weak recruitment 130 of TNIP1 mediated by A20 to the mitochondria, and the subsequent recruitment of the autophagy 131 machinery. In light of these results, we conclude that TNIP1 can induce mitophagy 132 independently of autophagy receptors, but is dependent on early autophagy machinery and is 133 dispensable for these autophagy machinery proteins to induce mitophagy. 134 135\nTNIP1 is a negative regulator of mitophagy 136 The CID results showed that TNIP1 has the potential to trigger mitophagy and allowed us to 137 identify the domains of TNIP1 required for this function. Since TNIP1 possesses a ubiquitin-138 binding domain, we speculated that it could act as an autophagy receptor working in concert with 139 TAX1BP1. To test this hypothesis, we compared TNIP1 to known autophagy receptors in 140 mitophagy flux assays. When subjected to mitophagy induced by mitochondrial depolarization, 141 receptors are degraded in an autophagy-specific manner, together with their cargo. Blocking 142 autophagosomal degradation with the V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) is a common 143 way to estimate substrates specifically degraded in lysosomes. Combining the mitochondrial 144 ATP synthase and complex III inhibitors Oligomycin A and AntimycinA1 (OA), respectively, is 145 an established treatment for triggering mitophagy. Autophagy receptors are selectively degraded 146 during mitophagy, as can be seen with TAX1BP1, NDP52 and OPTN (Figure 2A). Double 147 treatment of cells with BafA1 and OA promotes mitophagy, but prevents lysosomal degradation 148 of the encapsulated proteins (Figure 2A). However, similar to the ULK1 complex protein 149 FIP200, TNIP1 levels were not influenced by Bafilomycin or OA treatment. Interestingly, 150 TNIP1 was recently found to be an autophagy substrate in an autophagosome profiling content 151 screening21, and thus would appear to be an autophagy substrate. Consequently, its apparent lack 152 of degradation upon mitophagy or absence of accumulation upon Bafilomycin A1 treatment may 153 be due to a fast turnover rate. Therefore, we performed OA treatments combined with 154 cycloheximide (CHX) to investigate TNIP1 degradation (Supp Figure 2A). Remarkably, TNIP1 155 seems to be a long-lived protein, as no degradation of TNIP1 was seen after 4 hours of CHX 156 treatment, indicating that TNIP1 does not seem to be rapidly turned over. Interestingly, under 157 steady state condition, FIP200 is degraded rapidly but counterintuitively is stabilized during 158\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Consequently, TNIP1 is very likely not degraded en masse via autophagy, 159 as is the case for FIP200. Immunocytochemistry allowed observation of TNIP1 localization 160 under steady state condition as well as upon mitophagy. To trigger mitophagy, HeLa cells stably 161 expressing HA-Parkin were treated for 4Hrs with OA (Figure 2B+Supp Figure 2B). Under 162 steady state condition, TNIP1 appeared as puncta, in the vicinity of the mitochondria, with some 163 colocalization events at the periphery of mitochondria, in a manner reminiscent of autophagy 164 receptors. However, upon OA treatment, TNIP1 was found to coalesce in the perinuclear region 165 and not to substantially relocate to mitochondria, contrary to what is seen with the autophagy 166 receptor TAX1BP1, prompting us to reconsider the role of TNIP1 as an autophay receptor. 167 Because TNIP1 was able to induce mitophagy when artificially placed onto mitochondria, we 168 next asked if TNIP1 KO cells show any alteration in PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. HeLa 169 cells expressing mtKeima and HA-Parkin were treated for 6Hrs with OA and analyzed by FACS. 170 This treatment induced a strong mitophagy response in WT cells and showed the same response 171 in TNIP1 KO cells (Figure 3A). In contrast, reexpression of TNIP1 in TNIP1 KO cells using the 172 same construct used for the CID experiments (FKBP-GFP-TNIP1) showed a substantial defect in 173 mitophagy. These results indicate that TNIP1 may be a negative regulator of mitophagy and 174 prompting us to investigate earlier time points in mitophagy. Indeed, at 2Hrs of OA treatment, 175 when mitophagy was lower in WT cells, we saw a stronger mitophagy induction in TNIP1 KO 176 cells. A response that could be reversed by re-expression of TNIP1 (Figure 3B). To further 177 validate TNIP1\u2019s role in inhibiting mitophagy, we overexpressed TNIP1 in HeLa cells and 178 monitored mitophagy using mtKeima and FACS. Similar to results seen with rescue experiments 179 in the TNIP1 KO background, over-expression of TNIP1 in WT HeLa cells induced a robust 180 inhibition of mitophagy (Figure 3C). Overexpression of AHD domain deletion mutants in WT 181 cells was then used to compare to the full length TNIP1 and assess their abilities to inhibit 182 mitophagy. While the \u2206AHD1 construct showed a mitophagy response similar to WT TNIP1, in 183 accordance with a lack of function in previous CID experiments, \u2206AHD3 displayed higher 184 mitophagy, while \u2206AHD4 showed an intermediate response compared to \u2206AHD3 and WT 185 TNIP1. These results are consistent with the results obtained with CID, where we identified the 186 AHD3 domain as being important for TNIP1 function. 187 To further confirm the specificity of TNIP1 in inhibiting mitophagy, we performed the same 188 over-expression experiments with TNIP2 and TNIP3 (Supp Figure 3A). While TNIP2 189 overexpression had no effect, TNIP3 overexpression showed a mild inhibition of mitophagy, but 190 much less than seen with TNIP1 over-expression. This may be explained by the presence of an 191 AHD3 domain in TNIP3 but not in TNIP2. 192 Another rigorous mitophagy assay is to monitor the degradation of the mitochondrial matrix 193 protein COXII upon longer OA treatment. In WT cells, COXII showed a robust degradation after 194 18Hrs, progressing further after 21Hrs or 24Hrs of mitochondrial depolarization (Figure 3D). 195 When TNIP1 is overexpressed, we observed a block in COXII degradation starting at 21Hrs of 196 treatment, confirming that TNIP1 overexpression reduces the rate of mitophagy. Ectopic 197 expression of TNIP1 however did not seem to influence canonical autophagy upon starvation as 198\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

This indicates that TNIP1 appears specific for mitophagy and potentially other 200 selective autophagy pathways. 201\n202 Binding of TAX1BP1 to the AHD3 domain is required for TNIP1\u2019s inhibition of mitophagy 203 To obtain mechanistic insights into the function of TNIP1 as a negative regulator of autophagy, 204 we next performed an unbiased mass spectrometry (MS) screen to identify specific interactors of 205 the AHD3 domain. We immuno-precipitated (IP) HA-TNIP1 full length, TNIP1 \u2206AHD3 and 206 TNIP1 \u2206AHD4 and determined high confidence interaction partners (HCIPs) by MS followed by 207 Comparative Proteomics Analysis Software Suite (compPASS) analysis as previously 208 described23,24 (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table). While TNIP1 co-immunoprecipitated with 209 many cell surface receptors and secreted proteins, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed 210 autophagy components as the only significantly enriched class of proteins. In particular, 211 RAB11FIP5, the autophagy receptors TAX1BP1 and OPTN as well as the ULK1 complex 212 component RB1CC1 (FIP200) were the most abundant HCIPs. 213 Consistent with previous reports11, we observed that the TNIP1-OPTN interaction occurs via the 214 \u2206AHD4 domain by IP/MS and IP/immunoblotting (Figure 4 A,B). Interestingly, we also 215 confirmed binding of TNIP1 to TAX1BP112, which we found to require the AHD3 domain, 216 suggesting that TNIP1\u2019s function in mitophagy might depend on TAX1BP1. To test this 217 possibility, we further characterized the interaction between TNIP1 and TAX1BP1. We 218 overexpressed HA-tagged TAX1BP1 full length, coiled-coil (CC), \u2206SKICH or \u2206Zinc-Finger 219 (ZF) constructs in 293T cells stably expressing GFP-TNIP1 followed by anti-GFP IPs (Figure 220 4C). these experiments revealed that TNIP1 is able to interact with full length TAX1BP1 and 221 \u2206SKICH TAX1BP1, but not with TAX1BP1 CC and \u2206ZF constructs. These results indicate that 222 TNIP1 binds via the TAX1BP1 ubiquitin binding domain ZF. We next performed FACS 223 experiments to assess the involvement of TAX1BP1 in TNIP1\u2019s role in mitophagy inhibition 224 (Figure 4D). No reduction in mitophagy was observed in TAX1BP1 KO cells compared to WT 225 cells, in accordance to previously published data22. Furthermore, when we overexpressed TNIP1 226 in TAX1BP1 KO cells, we observed that TNIP1 did not inhibit mitophagy to levels similar to 227 those in WT cells. These results indicate that TAX1BP1 is essential for TNIP1 inhibition of 228 mitophagy. Overall, these results indicate that TNIP1 binds the ZF domain of TAX1BP1 via its 229 AHD3 domain, and this binding is critical for its inhibitory action. 230 TANK-Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates several autophagy receptors in the autophagy 231 pathway7. Furthermore, TBK1 was previously shown to be recruited to the TNIP1-TAX1BP1 232 complex12. We thus investigated whether TBK1 was involved in TNIP1 autophagy machinery 233 recruitment. We performed CID experiments by targeting TNIP1 to mitochondria, coupled with 234 immunocytochemistry and observed the recruitment of FIP200 and TAX1BP1 to the 235 mitochondria in TBK1 KO cells (Supp Figure 4A). Furthermore, we examined whether the 236 absence of TBK1 prevented mitophagy inhibition seen with TNIP1 overexpression. (Supp 237 Figure 4B).

These combined results 239 imply that TBK1 is likely not regulating TNIP1\u2019s action. Perhaps these results are not surprising 240 as TNIP1 does not seem to rely extensively on its UBAN domain for its function, while TBK1\u2019s 241 mode of action is principally to promote the association of UB chains to UB-binding domains 242 through phosphorylation. 243 244 Binding of FIP200 to an evolutionarily conserved LIR motif is required for TNIP1\u2019s 245 inhibition of mitophagy 246 The paradigm for selective autophagy initiation recently shifted, from the previous models that 247 autophagy receptors role was to recruit mATG8 proteins, which in turn recruit the autophagy 248 machinery, with the recent discovery that autophagy receptors can directly recruit the ULK1 249 complex for autophagosome formation7,25,26. Because the CID data using TNIP1 showed that 250 mitophagy in 5KO cells still functioned (Supp Figure 1A) and because of the co-IP Mass Spec 251 data (Fig. 4A), we reasoned that TNIP1 may interact with components of the autophagy 252 machineries other than TAX1BP1. While the main role of TNIP1 seems to be to inhibit 253 mitophagy by preventing certain autophagy components to function, the synthetic placement of 254 TNIP1 to the mitochondria in CID experiments seems to be enough to recruit these components 255 and drive a robust mitophagy response. Other high confidence IPs in our MS data were FIP200 256 and other members of the ULK1 complex (ATG13 and ATG101). This binding was still 257 observed with the \u2206AHD3 and \u2206AHD4 mutants. FIP200 binding to TNIP1 potentially explains 258 how CID with TNIP1 induced mitophagy, as it was previously demonstrated that CID with a 259 FIP200-binding peptide was sufficient to induce mitophagy7. We thus performed 260 immunoprecipitation experiments to validate the binding of TNIP1 with FIP200 (Figure 4B). 261 Full length TNIP1 was able to bind endogenous FIP200, as did \u2206AHD1, \u2206AHD3 and \u2206AHD4 262 domain deletion mutants. SQSTM1/p62 was recently demonstrated to bind to FIP200 through its 263 LIR motif 25. We thus investigated if TNIP1 contained an LIR motif that would also encompass a 264 FIP200 binding region. In silico searches of LC3 interacting region (LIR)27 motif using the 265 bioinformatic tool iLIR28 website revealed two potential canonical LIR domains in TNIP1 266 (Figure 5A). A Blast alignment with 4 other higher eukaryote TNIP1 proteins showed that LIR2 267 is conserved but not LIR1 (Supp Figure 5A). In order to determine whether TNIP1 LIR2 is a 268 functional LIR domain, we mutated LIR1 F83 and L86 to alanine and LIR2 F125 and V128 to 269 alanine (Supp Figure 5B). Lysates of HeLa cells transfected with TNIP1 WT, LIR1 mutant or 270 LIR2 mutant were subjected to GST pull down experiments, an assay previously used to assess 271 binding to mATG8 proteins (mammalian ATG8 i.e. LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, 272 GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2)29,30. As a positive control, SQSTM1/p62 was demonstrated to 273 bind strongly to all mATG8 proteins (Supp Figure 5C). TNIP1, on the other hand, was able to 274 bind only some of the mATG8 proteins, with a preference for GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and 275 GABARAPL2 (Figure 5B). LIR2 mutation abolished all binding to mATG8 proteins, while 276 LIR1 mutations had no effect on binding, indicating that TNIP1 possess an ATG8 binding motif, 277 characterized by the residues FEVV. 278\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Reflecting the MS data that showed the \u2206AHD4 mutant seemed to bind 280 more strongly to FIP200 (Figure 4A), the \u2206AHD4 mutant displayed a much stronger IP 281 interaction with FIP200. Interestingly, we could not detect any FIP200 binding with the LIR 282 mutant TNIP1. Reflecting the MS data where we did not detect a co-immunoprecipitation of 283 TNIP1 with WIPI2, binding with WIPI2 was not detected. Similar to observations made with 284 CID, where N-Terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs were nonfunctional (Figure 1E), 285 neither of these truncation constructs was able to bind FIP200 (Supp Figure 5D). This is 286 somewhat surprising as we expected the C-terminal deletion mutant to still bind FIP200. We 287 suspect that truncating TNIP1 disturbs its folding and thus its ability to bind FIP200. In order to 288 exclude the possibility that TNIP1 could pull down FIP200 via a secondary interaction with 289 mATG8 binding, we performed CID experiments coupled with immunocytochemistry in a 290 hATG8 6KO background (Supp Figure 5E). TNIP1 was able to recruit FIP200 upon 291 RAPALOG treatment, indicating that the binding between TNIP1 and FIP200 is not mediated by 292 hATG8 proteins. The LIR mutant TNIP1, however, was not able to recruit FIP200, confirming 293 that this region is necessary for FIP200 binding (Supp Figure 5F). To further characterize the 294 interaction between TNIP1 and FIP200, we looked to identify the binding region of TNIP1 295 within FIP200 (Figure 5D). While TNIP1 was able to bind full length and the C-terminal region 296 of FIP200, it was not able to bind the N-terminal part of FIP200 (Figure 5E), prompting us to 297 further map the C-terminal region interaction with FIP200. NDP52 was previously shown to 298 interact with the Leucine Zipper domain of FIP200, while the CLAW domain of FIP200 was 299 recently identified as responsible for binding with p6225. Consequently, we investigated binding 300 to TNIP1 of these two domains of FIP200. TNIP1 was able to pull-down only the Claw domain 301 of FIP200, indicating that the CLAW domain is the minimal necessary region for binding to 302 TNIP1 (Figure 5E). 303 We next investigated whether this LIR motif was important for TNIP1\u2019s mitophagy function 304 using CID experiments. The LIR mutant TNIP1 was able to trigger mitophagy with an 305 approximately 60% defect compared to WT TNIP1, indicating the importance of the LIR domain 306 in mitophagy (Figure 6A). Immunocytochemistry confirmed the FACS data, with the LIR 307 mutant construct recruiting LC3B to the mitochondria to a much lesser extent than WT TNIP1 308 (Supp Figure 6A, B). Since we discovered that the LIR mutant and AHD3 deletion mutant 309 TNIP1 were deficient in mitophagy, we combined both and made an AHD3 deletion and LIR 310 mutant construct. This construct completely abolished TNIP1\u2019s ability to induce mitophagy 311 (Figure 6A). We conclude that the LIR motif and AHD3 domain of TNIP1 are both involved 312 with distinct roles in mitophagy. We next carried out rescue experiments with the LIR mutant 313 construct in PINK1-Parkin dependent mitophagy. Similarly to the observations with the AHD3 314 deletion construct, the inhibition of mitophagy was abolished with the LIR mutant construct 315 (Figure 6B). Therefore, we conclude that the LIR motif and the AHD3 domain of TNIP1 are 316 both contributing to its role in inhibiting mitophagy. 317 318\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

TNIP1-mediated mitophagy 321 inhibition relies on binding to both TAX1BP1 (via its AHD3 domain) and FIP200 (via a 322 previously unrecognized LIR motif). Our findings have potentially important implications for 323 our understanding of early events of mitophagy induction, ULK1 complex recycling at the 324 forming autophagosome, and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 325 Because TNIP1 decreases the rate of mitophagy, and binds to FIP200, we hypothesize that it acts 326 by sequestering FIP200, and thereby slowing down the mitophagy response. We anticipate this 327 sequestration can happen in two main places during mitophagy (Supp Figure 6C). (1) TNIP1 328 binds FIP200 at all times, regulating its availability, preventing its recruitment to autophagy 329 receptors in non-mitophagy conditions. (2) TNIP1 is recruited to the forming autophagosome via 330 TAX1BP1 binding and competes with the autophagy receptors for FIP200 binding, releasing the 331 ULK1 complex from the mitochondria. This hypothesis is supported by the data showing that 332 FIP200 and TNIP1 are not degraded during mitophagy, hence it is most probably removed from 333 the autophagosome before closure, in a mechanism that is still elusive. In this model, the data 334 showing that overexpressing TNIP1 slows down mitophagy is hypothesized to be due to an 335 excess of TNIP1 located to the autophagosome, subsequently releasing the ULK1 complex 336 before it can recruit downstream autophagy components. The findings that ectopic TNIP1 337 doesn\u2019t inhibit bulk autophagy during starvation is an indication that hypothesis (1), where 338 TNIP1 binds FIP200 at all times, is probably not likely, otherwise an inhibition upon starvation 339 would occur as well. One of the key findings of this report is the identification of a LIR motif in 340 TNIP1. However, similarly to a recent publication describing the FIP200 binding region of 341 SQSTM1/p62 encompassing the LIR motif25, it is very likely that a longer sequence than the LIR 342 is responsible for binding to FIP200 and could potentially outcompete LIR binding to mATG8. 343 In this instance, TNIP1 could be driven to the forming autophagosome by binding to the 344 GABARAP proteins, and then compete with the autophagy receptors (i.e., TAX1BP1) for 345 FIP200 binding. The MS data with the \u2206AHD3 and \u2206AHD4 mutants showing a stronger binding 346 to FIP200 could reflect this binding competition between TNIP1, TAX1BP1 (or OPTN) and 347 FIP200, as it seems that losing the domains responsible for binding to the autophagy receptors 348 enhance FIP200 binding. The tighter binding of \u2206AHD3 and \u2206AHD4 mutants to FIP200 could 349 also indicate that conformational changes in TNIP1 may regulate mitophagy inhibition. Further 350 work will be necessary to fully understand how TNIP1 is regulated to perform its negative action 351 on mitophagy. Furthermore, future studies on TNIP1 should investigate other types of selective 352 autophagy involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as aggrephagy. 353 Interestingly, this inhibition of mitophagy mediated by TNIP1 is reminiscent of its role in the 354 negative regulation of the NF-kB pathway or interferon response as well as apoptosis8,12,20,31, 355 although for mitophagy it seems that TNIP1 is acting independently of ubiquitin signaling as its 356 UBAN domain is largely not required. To date, very few proteins have been characterized as 357 inhibitors of autophagy. The Deubiquitin enzyme (DUB) USP30 was shown to oppose Parkin by 358 removing ubiquitin molecules from mitochondria18. Most other proteins identified negatively 359\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This is exemplified by the negative 360 regulation via the production of PI3P, where several proteins were shown to act. The 361 antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was shown to interact and inhibit Beclin-1\u2019s function in autophagy32. 362 The PI3P phosphatase Jumpy was shown to control autophagy initiation by acting at the 363 autophagic isolation membrane stage33. Autophagy is also inhibited at the LC3 level, with FLIP 364 altering the interaction between ATG3 and LC334. Also acting at the LC3 level, UBA6-BIRC6 365 was shown to ubiquitinate LC3, regulating it\u2019s availability for autophagy and resulting in an 366 inhibition35. Finally, further down the pathway, the Beclin-1 interacting protein Rubicon was 367 shown to negatively regulate autophagosome maturation36,37. TNIP1 thus is another addition to 368 these handful described negative regulator of autophagy, albeit TNIP1, like Usp30, seems to be 369 downregulating mitophagy and not bulk autophagy. 370 Although to our knowledge this is the first time that a negative function of mitophagy is 371 described for TNIP1, it was previously found in proteomics papers as being autophagy 372 substrate21,38. TNIP1 was also identified as an autophagy substrate in senescent cells11 as well as 373 upon stimulation by Toll-like receptor ligands39. It should be noted that we do not see TNIP1 374 degradation by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway upon mitophagy induction, so its turn-over 375 during autophagy is likely negligible. Furthermore, although we confirmed that A20 was not 376 involved in the negative regulation of mitophagy, A20 was previously shown to interact with 377 ATG16L1, together controlling intestinal homeostasis40. However, TNIP1 was not investigated 378 in that study, thus its involvement there is unknown. 379 Recent findings implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease (ND), and 380 more particularly in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and AD. Although most reports show that a defect 381 in mitophagy is deleterious for ND, and that TNIP1 negatively regulates mitophagy rates, one 382 can hypothesize that loss of TNIP1\u2019s function in mitophagy regulation could be a factor leading 383 to ND such as AD. For these reasons, efforts will be necessary to investigate whether and how 384 TNIP1 could be involved in mitochondrial dysfunction. It will be particularly interesting to see if 385 TNIP1\u2019s locus associated with AD is due to it\u2019s loss of function in mitophagy or any of the other 386 pathways it is involved in. On the other hand, for PD, efforts are being made to activate 387 mitophagy. One strategy seen as amenable to pharmacologic manipulation is to inhibit the 388 proteins that inhibit mitophagy such as USP30. One could consider pharmacologic inhibition of 389 TNIP1 as an alternate approach. 390 391\nAcknowledgement 392 The authors would like to thank the laboratory of Michael Lazarou (Monash Biomedicine 393 Discovery Institute) for sharing the LC3/GABARAP KO cells.

HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured 755 in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) 756 (Sigma), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX. All media and supplements were from 757 Thermo Fisher. All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination every two weeks with 758 PlasmoTest kit (InvivoGen). Reagents used for transfections were, X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche) for 759 sgRNA transfection, or Polyethylenimine (PEI) (PolySciences) for all other transfections. The 760 full list of antibodies and reagents are found in Key Resources Table. 761 762 Method Detail 763 Knockout line generation using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing 764 CRISPR gRNAs were generated to target exon 3 of TNIP1, exon 2 of TNFAIP3 and exon 3 of 765 TAX1BP1. gRNAs were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 (Addgene plasmid 766 #62988). To Make KO, HeLa cells were transfected with the gRNA plasmid and treated with 1 767 ug/ml puromycin for 2 days to enrich transfected cells, which were then diluted and placed into 768 96-well plates for single colonies. Primer set (ggtggaccagcatggagttt and accagggagcttccaactca) 769 were used for PCR screening of TNIP1 KO clones. Primer set (tcagtacccactctctgccttc and 770 ctccaagcctcaatgtgctct) were used for PCR screening of TNFAIP3 KO clones. Primer set 771 (ttatccttgagaaattggatagca and tagtacctaaaaagaaacccactcttc) were used for PCR screening of 772 TAX1BP1 KO clones. 773 774 Cloning and stable cell line generation 775 For lentiviral constructs, inserts were either amplified by PCR and cloned into pHAGE vector, 776 respectively by Gibson assembly (New England Labs) or Gateway cloning (Thermo 777 Fisher).

The next day, media was exchanged with fresh media. 783 Viruses were harvested 48 hrs and 72 hrs after transfection and transduced in HeLa or HEK293T 784 cells with 8 \u03bcg/mL polybrene (Sigma). Cells were then directly used in experiments or optimized 785 for expression by FACS. 786 787 Immunoblot Analyses 788 Cells seeded into 6-well plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 789 RIPA buffer. The protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit. Samples were boiled at 790 99\u00b0C for 10 min. 20-50 \u03bcg of protein lysate of each sample was loaded and separated on 4-12% 791 Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher or GenScript) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Gels were 792 transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes and immunostained using specific antibodies. 793 For mitophagy measurements by immunoblotting, cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM Oligomycin 794 (Calbiochem), 10 \u03bcM Antimycin A (Sigma) and 10 \u03bcM QVD (ApexBio) in growth medium at 795 different timepoints indicated in figure legends, prior to western blot analysis. For starvation-796 induced autophagy, by immunoblotting, cells were washed 2 times with PBS and incubated for 797 the indicated time with HBSS containing calcium and magnesium. 798 799 Recombinant protein production and protein purification 800 mATG8 proteins (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2) and GFP 801 were first cloned into pENTR vector using GATEWAY cloning. They were cloned into 802 pDEST60 GST vector using LR clonase. GST expression vector were expressed into DL21 803 (DE3) bacteria. 50ml LB broth was inoculated with 2ml pre-culture of the GST constructs. 804 Bacteria were incubated for \u02dc1 Hr at 37\u02daC with agitation until an optical density of \u02dc0.6 was 805 reach. 400\u00b5M IPTG was used to induce protein production for 4 Hrs. Bacteria were collected 806 and the pellet was lysed with lysis buffer (20mM TRIS-HCl pH7.5, 10mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 807 150mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 1% Triton X-100, Benzonase, 1mM DTT, protease inhibitor, 2mg/ml 808 lysozyme). The lysate was shockfreezed with liquid nitrogen before thawing and sonication. The 809 samples were centrifuged and cleared lysate was incubated with 100\u00b5l of slurry GST beads, 810 followed by an overnight incubation at 4\u02daC on a rotating shaker. Beads were subsequently 811 washed (20mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 150mM NaCl, 1mM DTT) 812 before exchanging the buffer for the storage buffer (20mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA, 813 5mM EGTA, 150mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 5% glycerol, proteinase inhibitor). 814 815 Immunoprecipitation, GST-pull down, GFP-TRAP and HA beads precipitation 816 For GFP-TRAP (Chromotek), HA-beads (Pierce), precipitation experiments, HEK293T cells 817 seeded in 10cm plates were co-transfected with specific constructs to overexpress proteins of 818 interest for 24 to 48 h. IPs were performed following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, for 819 HA-IP, cells were then lysed using ice cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 820 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) supplemented with EDTA-free cOmplete protease 821\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Samples were incubated on ice with intermittent agitation by pipetting for 822 10 min. Beads were equilibrated using bead resuspension buffer (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-823 20 Detergent (TBS-T)). Protein lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 824 15,000 g. 1% INPUT was collected and clarified lysate was incubated with equilibrated beads for 825 1-2 Hrs at 4\u00b0C. Beads were then washed with ice cold TBST Wash buffer 3 to 5 times. Bound 826 proteins were eluted with 2x LDS lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) in boiling conditions. 827 For GFP-Trap, cells were then lysed using ice cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM 828 NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 % NonidetTM P40 Substitute) supplemented with EDTA-free 829 cOmplete protease inhibitor (Roche). Samples were incubated on ice with intermittent agitation 830 by pipetting for 30 min. Beads were equilibrated using bead dilution buffer (10 mM Tris/Cl pH 831 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA). Protein lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 832 10 min at 15,000 g. Clarified lysates were diluted using dilution buffer, 1% INPUT was collected 833 and lysate was incubated with equilibrated beads for 1-2 Hrs at 4\u00b0C. Beads were then washed 834 with ice cold Wash buffer (10 mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % NonidetTM P40 835 Substitute, 0.5 mM EDTA ) 3 to 5 times. Bound proteins were eluted with 2x LDS lysis buffer 836 (Thermo Fisher) in boiling conditions. 837 For GST pull down, cells were lysed (50mM TRIS-HCl 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, protease 838 inhibitor). Samples were incubated at 4\u02daC with constant agitation for 30 min. Protein lysates 839 were precleared by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 15,000 g. 1% INPUT was collected and 840 clarified lysate was incubated with equilibrated beads overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation. Beads 841 were washed 5 times with wash buffer (20mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 842 150mM NaCl, 1mM DTT). Bound proteins were eluted with 2x LDS lysis buffer (Thermo 843 Fisher) in boiling conditions. 844 845 Immunofluorescence microscopy 846 Cells seeded in 12 well plates with a 1.5mm pre-treated coverslip (neuVitro) were treated as 847 indicated in figure legends. After treatment, cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed with 4% 848 paraformaldehyde at RT for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS. For immunostaining, cells 849 were then permeabilzed and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% goat serum in PBS for 15 min 850 at RT. After, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% goat serum in PBS supplemented 851 with antibodies (1:1000) 1-2 Hrs at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBST (PBS 852 + 0.1% Triton X-100) 3 times and incubated with Alexa 505, 488 or 594-conjugated secondary 853 antibodies (Thermo Fisher). For cells expressing fluorescent tagged proteins, cells were seeded 854 as above. After treatments, cells were fixed as above and washed 3 times with PBS prior to 855 image analysis. Images were taken using 63x oil, DIC objective on an LSM 880 Airyscan 856 microscope (Zeiss). 857 858 Mass spectrometry 859 After samples were bound to magnetic HA-beads, samples were eluted with elution buffer 860 (2mg/ml HA peptide in TBS) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, followed by TCA 861 precipitation.

Precipitated peptides were washed with 10% 863 ice cold TCA, followed by 4 washes with ice cold acetone. The tubes were left to air dry before 864 trypsin digestion. Briefly, peptides were re-suspended with solubilizing buffer (5% SDS, 8M 865 urea, 50mM TEAB, pH7.6). DTT was added for f.c. 5mM before incubating at 50\u02daC for 30min. 866 MMTS was added for 45min before adding an aqueous phosphoric acid solution. Meanwhile, S-867 Trap columns (Protifi) were conditioned with binding buffer (90% methanol, 100mM TEAB, 868 pH7.1). 1\u00b5g of trypsin was added to the acidified protein mixture and immediately added into the 869 column containing binding buffer. Centrifugation and washing steps were performed before 870 adding digestion buffer (Trypsin in 50mM TEAB) and incubation at 37\u02daC overnight. Rehydrate 871 the column with 50mM TEAB before elution using 0.2% formic acid and another elution using 872 50% acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid. 873 Tryptic digests were analyzed using an orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid mass spectrometer 874 interfaced to an UltiMate3000 RSLC nano HPLC system (Thermo Scientific) using data 875 dependent acquisition. Initial protein identification was carried out using Proteome Discoverer 876 (V2.4) software (Thermo Scientific). Search results from Proteome Discoverer were incorporated 877 into Scaffold4 for relative quantification using spectral counting. Samples were compared to 878 ~100 reference IPs using a Java script programmed according to the CompPASS software 879 suite as previously described23,24 and also compared to the CRAPome41. For determination of the 880 TNIP1 interaction network, thresholds for high confidence interaction partners (HCIPs) were top 881 5% of interactors with highest Z-score and lowest abundance in the CRAPome. Cytoscape was 882 used to visualize the TNIP1 interaction network. To compare WT TNIP1 with TNIP1\u0394AHD3 883 and TNIP1\u0394AHD4, total spectral counts for each interactor were first normalized to 1000 and 884 then expressed relative to WT/controls in fold-change (log2) and plotted as heatmap using 885 GraphPad. 886 887 Mitophagy assay with mito-mKeima via fluorescence activated cytometer 888 Stable cell lines were generated to express mito-mKeima, HA-Parkin, FRB-Fis1 and FKBP-889 GFP-tagged target genes with lentivirus system. 100K cells were seeded in 12-well plates and 890 treated with Rapalog for 24h or by OA at various time points before FACS analysis. FACS 891 analysis were performed as previously described22,42. 892 893 Quantification and Statistical Analysis 894 All statistical analyses for FACS were calculated in GraphPad Prism 9.
