1. **Investigate the effects of humic product application on the biochemical composition of other crops.** The current study focused on maize, but it is possible that humic products could have different effects on other crops. For example, humic products might promote carbohydrate production in crops that are harvested for their carbohydrates, such as sugar beet, potato, and sugarcane.


2. **Examine the effects of humic product application on plant responses to other environmental stresses.** The current study focused on drought stress, but humic products might also affect plant responses to other environmental stresses, such as heat stress, cold stress, and salinity stress.


3. **Determine the mechanisms by which humic products affect plant biochemical composition.** The current study did not investigate the mechanisms by which humic products affect plant biochemical composition. Future studies could use techniques such as gene expression analysis and metabolomics to identify the specific genes and pathways that are affected by humic product application.


4. **Develop new humic products that are specifically designed to enhance plant tolerance to environmental stresses.** The current study used a commercially available humic product. Future studies could develop new humic products that are specifically designed to enhance plant tolerance to environmental stresses. These products could be tailored to specific crops and environmental conditions.


5. **Conduct field trials to evaluate the agronomic benefits of humic product application under different environmental conditions.** The current study was conducted at a single location in central Iowa. Future studies could conduct field trials at multiple locations and under different environmental conditions to evaluate the agronomic benefits of humic product application. These studies could help to determine the conditions under which humic products are most effective.
