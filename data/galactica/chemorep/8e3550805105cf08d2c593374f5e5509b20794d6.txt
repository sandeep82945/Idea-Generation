As outlined in Figure 9, we demonstrated that C18 can damage the cell wall and alter cell membrane permeability,
attenuating virulence in C. albicans. Furthermore, the peptide triggers dysfunction mitochondria with the feature of 49m collapse and ATP depletion induced by ROS generation and intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, leading to cell death. Our data has shown considerable promising antifungal possibility of C18 and is valuable to draw attention for further pharmacodynamic investigations in animal models. Our findings highlight new strategies for the treatment of candidiasis and reveals the possible molecular mechanisms of inhibitory C. albicans.
