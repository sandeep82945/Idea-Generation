    "abstractText": "We study the interaction of the doubly bottom systems BB, B\u2217B, BsB, B \u2217 sB, B \u2217B\u2217, BBs, B\u2217B\u2217 s , BsBs, BsB \u2217 s , B \u2217 sB \u2217 s by means of vector meson exchange with Lagrangians from an extension of the local hidden gauge approach. The full s-wave scattering matrix is obtained implementing unitarity in coupled channels by means of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We find poles below the channel thresholds for the attractively interacting channels B\u2217B in I = 0, B\u2217 sB \u2212 BBs in I = 12 , B\u2217B\u2217 in I = 0, and B\u2217 sB \u2217 in I = 1 2 , all of them with J P = 1+. For these cases the widths are evaluated identifyng the dominant source of imaginary part. We find binding energies of the order of 10 \u2212 20 MeV, and the widths vary much from one system to the other: of the order of 10-100 eV for the B\u2217B system and B\u2217 sB \u2212 BBs, about 6 MeV for the B\u2217B\u2217 system and of the order of 0.5 MeV for the B\u2217 sB \u2217 system. \u2217 dailianrong@zjhu.edu.cn \u2020 oset@ific.uv.es \u2021 edfeijoo@ific.uv.es \u00a7 Raquel.Molina@ific.uv.es \u00b6 luisroca@um.es \u2217\u2217 amartine@if.usp.br \u2020\u2020 kanchan.khemchandani@unifesp.br 1 ar X iv :2 20 1. 04 84 0v 1 [ he pph ] 1 3 Ja n 20 22",

INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of the Tcc state by the LHCb collaboration [1, 2] is a turning point for our understanding of meson spectroscopy. While many studies had been done on doubly heavy meson states (see recent review in [3] and references in [4]) the small binding of around 360 keV and small width of about 48 keV were not anticipated, although a small binding energy had been predicted in [5, 6]. The discovery has triggered many theoretical works, tuning parameters of the theory to obtain the right mass and in some cases the width also [4, 7\u201321]. The proximity of the Tcc state to the D \u2217+D0 threshold and the results of the works mentioned above, leave little doubt that one has a molecular state of components D\u2217+D0 and D\u22170D+ and very close to I = 0 [4, 20]. The experimental analysis in [2] shows indeed no signal in the D+D0\u03c0+ mass distribution which corresponds to an I = 1 D\u2217D state. The smallness of the width finds a natural interpretation within the molecular picture [4, 7, 8, 19, 20] and is tied to the D\u2217 \u2192 \u03c0D decay width. With this background it is obviously tempting to make accurate predictions for states of B (\u2217) (s)B (\u2217) (s) nature, which might be experimentally observed in the near future. Yet, it is interesting to look into predictions of such states made before the Tcc discovery.\nThe history of possible B(\u2217)B(\u2217) bound systems is long. In Ref. [22] its possible existence driven by pion exchange was already investigated. Pion exchange supplemented by vector exchange was also considered in [23] and bound states were found. A similar study was conducted in [24] where, using a boson exchange model, bound states were found for the cases B(\u2217)B(\u2217) with I(JP ) = 0(1+), 1(1+), (B(\u2217)B(\u2217))s[J P = 1+, 2+] and (B(\u2217)B(\u2217))ss[J P = 1+, 2+]. One boson exchange together with arguments of heavy quark symmetry are used in [25, 26] to obtain bound states for some of these systems. In the same line, in [27, 28] isoscalar bound states of BB\u2217 nature are found while an isovector appears for B\u2217B\u2217 in [28]. A different perspective is taken in [29\u201331] using the constituent quark model where also the potential is compared with lattice QCD calculations [30, 31]. Again, a bound state is found for BB\u2217 in the I = 0 sector. Other lattice QCD calculations also provide BB potentials that could lead to binding for some configurations [32\u201335]. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation in the MIT bag model [36], or with lattice QCD results [37], is used to get the BB interaction. Possible formation of BBs0 and B \u2217B\u2217s1 molecules is also investigated by means of kaon exchange [38]. Contact terms and pion exchange are considered in [39] and bound states\nare obtained in the BB\u2217 and B\u2217B\u2217 in I = 0, JP = 1+, with binding energies ranging from 12 to 24 MeV, with large uncertainties. Similar results are obtained using quark model interactions in [40]. The boson exchange model is again used in [41] with the result that no bound state is found for BB, a I(JP ) = 0(1+) bound state is found for BB\u2217 and bound states in 0(1+), 0(2+) and 1(2+) are obtained for the B\u2217B\u2217 system. An extension of the model to incorporate strange quarks is also done in [42]. Using again a quark model, a compact very bound tetraquark state and a shallow BB\u2217 molecular state are also reported in [43]. Further details and discussion of compact tetraquarks predictions can be found in the review of [3].\nWhile there seems to be a common ground in all these models that some exotic double bottom meson states should exists, the predictions are quite different. The recent experimental finding of the Tcc state, with small binding and width, provides an extremely useful information to constrain the freedom in the models and come with more accurate predictions before these states are hopefully found in the near future. On the other hand, none of these works evaluate the width of these states. The aim of the present work is to use the information obtained from the Tcc state and, using tools proved accurate in former studies, make predictions for possible B (\u2217) (s) B (\u2217) (s) states, evaluating also the decays widths. For this purpose we shall use the extension of the local hidden gauge approach [44\u201347] to the bottom sector. The interaction is obtained from the exchange of vector mesons, and only the exchange of the light vectors will be considered, since other terms are negligible. The b quarks are then spectators in the interaction and the rules of heavy quark symmetry are automatically fulfilled. The approach has been often used, but concretely concerning exotic states with two open quarks, the approach was used in [48] to study an exotic D\u2217K\u0304\u2217 bound state that could be identified with the recently discovered X(3866) meson [49] (see update in [50]), and also the D\u2217D\u2217 system, where the D\u2217D\u2217 state with I = 0, JP = 1+ and the D\u2217sD \u2217 with I = 1 2 , JP = 1+ were found slightly bound (see update in [21]). The same approach has been used in the description of the Tcc state in [4], where the width was predicted to be small, much smaller than the experimental one claimed in [4] before the analysis of [23], correcting for the experimental resolution, gave a width of the order of 40 keV. The theoretical approach has only one degree of freedom, the cutoff used to regulate the meson meson loops. We shall follow the same approach here and, considering the findings of [51, 52] which advise the use of the same cutoff in the different heavy sectors to respect heavy quark\nsymmetry, we shall do this to obtain the masses of the possible B (\u2217) (s)B (\u2217) (s) from the Tcc states [4]. Furthermore, we shall also evaluate the widths of the states, which should be helpful to identify the nature of these states when they are hopefully discovered in the near future."

            "text": "The basic dynamics in the extended local hidden gauge approach is the exchange of vector mesons, as shown in Fig. 1 and a contact term in the case of V V \u2192 V V (V is vertex). There are two basic vertices, the vector-pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar (V PP ) vertex\nand the vector-vector-vector (V V V ) vertex, given by the Lagrangians\nLV PP = \u2212ig \u3008[P, \u2202\u00b5P ]V \u00b5\u3009 , (1)\nLV V V = ig \u3008(V \u00b5\u2202\u03bdV\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202\u03bdV \u00b5V\u00b5)V \u03bd\u3009 , (2)\nwith g = MV 2 f (MV = 800 MeV, f = 93 MeV) where P, V are the qq\u0304 matrices written in terms of the pseudoscalar or vector meson fields. We consider u, d, s, b quarks and no charm here, (BD and related states are studied in [53]). Then, the pseudoscalar and vector matrices are\nP =  \u03b7\u221a 3 + \u03b7 \u2032 \u221a 6 + \u03c0 0 \u221a 2 \u03c0+ K+ B+ \u03c0\u2212 \u03b7\u221a 3 + \u03b7 \u2032 \u221a 6 \u2212 \u03c00\u221a 2 K0 B0 K\u2212 K\u03040 \u2212 \u03b7\u221a 3 + \u221a 2 3 \u03b7\u2032 B0s\nB\u2212 B\u03040 B\u03040s \u03b7b\n , (3)\nwhere we have taken the standard \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 mixing of [54] and\nV =  \u03c9\u221a 2 + \u03c1 0 \u221a 2 \u03c1+ K\u2217+ B\u2217+ \u03c1\u2212 \u03c9\u221a 2 \u2212 \u03c10\u221a 2 K\u22170 B\u22170 K\u2217\u2212 K\u0304\u22170 \u03c6 B\u22170s\nB\u2217\u2212 B\u0304\u22170 B\u0304\u22170s \u03a5  . (4) Since we work close to the threshold of the B,B\u2217 states, we neglect the three momentum of the external vectors compared to their mass, which allows us to take 0 = 0 in the polarization vector \u00b5 of the external vector states, by virtue of the Lorenz condition of the free massive vector meson field, k\u00b5 \u00b5 = 0. Then, in Eq. (2) V\u03bd cannot correspond to an external vector in Fig. 1 because \u2202\u03bd will be \u2202i and produces a three momentum which is taken zero. Then V\u03bd in Eq. (2) corresponds to the V exchanged vector in Fig. 1 and V \u00b5V\u00b5 gives rise to \u00b5 \u00b5 = \u2212 \u2032 of the external vectors in the vertex. Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) are formally identical except for the extra factor \u2032 in the vector-vector interaction. The evaluation of the amplitude stemming from Fig. 1 is straightforward, but some caution must be taken. We show below how it proceeds.\nA. BB system\nWe only consider the interaction in s-wave. The BB is a system of identical particles,\nwith the isospin doublet (B+, B0). Hence\n|BB, I = 0\u3009 = 1 2\n( B+(p)B0(\u2212p)\u2212B0(p)B+(\u2212p) ) ,\nwhere the extra factor 1\u221a 2 in the normalization is taken to work in the unitary normalization, convenient for identical particle [55]. Similarly, with the same normalization\n|BB, I = 1, I3 = 1\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( B+(p)B+(\u2212p) ) .\nWe can see that the I = 0 state is antisymmetric under the exchange of the two mesons and must be discarded. Only I = 1 exists and to get the interaction we must evaluate the diagrams of Fig. 2.\nThe interaction stemming from the diagrams of Fig. 2 comes from the exchange of \u03c10, \u03c9\nand gives a potential function\nVB+B+,B+B+ = 1\n4 ( 1 m2\u03c1 + 1 m2\u03c9 ) [(p1 + p3)(p2 + p4) + (p1 + p4)(p2 + p3)] . (5)\nWe must project this in s-wave and we have\n(p1 + p3)(p2 + p4) = 1\n2\n[ 3s\u2212 (M2 +m2 +M \u20322 +m\u20322)\u2212 1\ns (M2 \u2212m2)(M \u20322 \u2212m\u20322)\n] , (6)\nwith \u221a s being the rest frame energy of the initial two mesons, and M,m,M \u2032,m\u2032 corresponding to upper, lower (initial), upper, lower (final) masses in general. Once the potential is obtained we construct the scattering matrix via the coupled-channel BetheSalpeter equation\nT = [1\u2212 V G]\u22121V (7)\nwhere G is the diagonal loop function for intermediate mesons, that we choose to regularize with the cutoff method [55], integrating over three momenta smaller than a certain qmax.\nIn Eq. (5) we see that the interaction is repulsive and hence the T matrix of Eq. (6) does not produce any bound state. We thus conclude that there are no bound states for the BB system. Using the same formalism we conclude that the interaction in the BsB and BsBs channels is also repulsive.\nB. B\u2217B system\nIn this case the particles are not identical. Despite the fact that one can express the states in isospin (I = 0, 1) basis, it is convenient to treat the problem with coupled channels as it was done in [4] for the Tcc state since it was made from D \u2217+D0 and D\u22170D+ with different thresholds, and it is closer to the D\u2217+D0 one.\nThe channels in the present case are B\u2217+B0 (1), B\u22170B+ (2) with masses\nmB+ = 5279.34 MeV , mB0 = 5279.65 MeV , mB\u2217 = 5324.70 MeV . (8)\nWe also give the masses of Bs and B \u2217 s for later purposes:\nmBs = 5366.88 MeV , mB\u2217s = 5415.4 MeV. (9)\nThe elementary interaction is obtained with the diagrams of Fig. 3.\nOne can see that at the quark level one cannot exchange qq\u0304 in the diagram of Fig. 3 (a) because the upper light quark in B\u2217+ is a u quark and in B0 is a d quark. In the picture that we have, this translates into a cancellation of \u03c10, \u03c9 exchange when we take a common mass for the two. The same happens with the diagram of Fig. 3 (b). However, in the non diagonal term of Fig. 3 (c) one can exchange a \u03c1+, for which we obtain the following matrix interaction potential:\nVij = Cij g 2 (p1 + p3)(p2 + p4) \u2032 . (10)\nwith the matrix Cij given by\nCij =  0 1m2\u03c1 1 m2\u03c1 0  . (11) Now the G matrix containing the B\u2217B loops entering the Bethe-Salpeter equation (7) is\nG =  GB\u2217+B0 0 0 GB\u22170B+  . (12)\nIf we take the isospin states\n|B\u2217B, I = 0\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( B\u2217+B0 \u2212B\u22170B+ ) ,\n|B\u2217B, I = 1, I3 = 0\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( B\u2217+B0 +B\u22170B+ ) , (13)\nwe can see that we would get an attraction with C(I = 0) = \u2212 1 m2\u03c1 for I = 0 and a repulsion with C(I = 1) = 1 m2\u03c1 for I = 1, indicating that we can get a bound state for I = 0 but not for I = 1. The spin in the present case is JP = 1+. Should the binding of the states be small, like in the case of the Tcc, there could be a small violation of isospin, as found in [4], and thus we work in coupled channels. The interaction is formally the same as found for the Tcc in [4] and we follow then the same procedure as there, changing the masses, and using the same cut off around qmax = 420 MeV to regularize the B \u2217B loop functions.\nAnticipating some results, the pole of the T matrix that we will find in the result section associated with the doubly bottom state thus generated is in principle located on the real axis about 20 MeV below the B\u2217B threshold and hence has no width since the only decay channels considered (B\u2217+B0 and B\u22170B+) are closed. The only possible meson-meson double bottom decay channel with lower threshold could be BB, but it is forbidden for the strong interaction since, to get JP = 1+, we need L = 1 in the BB system and then parity is violated. Therefore, the only way to obtain a width for the doubly bottom state is from the decay of the B\u2217 into B\u03b3, which has not been measured but has been evaluated theoretically. We shall take from [56\u201359] the average value of\n\u0393B\u2217 ' 0.40 keV. (14)\nIn order to take into account this effect we include the B\u2217 \u2192 B\u03b3 decay width into the B\u2217 propagators in the loop functions of Eq. (12) (see Fig. 4):\nG(s) = i\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 1 q2 \u2212m2B + i 1 (P \u2212 q)2 \u2212m2B\u2217 + i \u221a (P \u2212 q)2\u0393B\u2217((P \u2212 q)2) , (15)\nwhere for the masses of B\u2217 and B we distinguish between B\u2217+, B0, and B\u22170, B+ correspondingly. Given the offshell-ness of the B\u2217 in the loop, we have to consider an energy dependent B\u2217 \u2192 B\u03b3 decay width:\n\u0393B\u2217(s \u2032) = \u0393B\u2217(m 2 B\u2217)\nm2B\u2217\ns\u2032\n( p\u03b3(s \u2032)\np\u03b3(m2B\u2217)\n)3 \u0398( \u221a s\u2032 \u2212mB) , (16)\nwhere \u0393B\u2217(m 2 B\u2217) ' 0.4 keV is the on-shell width mentioned above; \u0398 is the step function and p\u03b3 is the photon decay momentum, p\u03b3(s) = \u03bb 1/2(s,m2B, 0)/(2 \u221a s), with \u03bb standing for the Ka\u0308llen function.\nAfter performing the q0 integration in Eq. (15) we get\nG(s) ' \u222b qmax\n0\ndq q2 4\u03c02 \u03c9B + \u03c9B\u2217\n\u03c9B\u03c9B\u2217 1\u221a s+ \u03c9B + \u03c9B\u2217 1 \u221a s\u2212 \u03c9B \u2212 \u03c9B\u2217 + i \u221a s\u2032\n2\u03c9B\u2217 \u0393B\u2217(s\u2032)\n, (17)\nwhere \u03c9B(B\u2217) = \u221a ~q 2 +m2B(B\u2217) and s \u2032 = ( \u221a s\u2212 \u03c9B)2 \u2212 ~q 2.\nNote that now Eq. (17) provides a small but finite imaginary part for the T matrix\ncorresponding to the cut depicted in Fig. 4.\nC. B\u2217sB,B \u2217Bs system\nIt is straightforward to extend the previous B\u2217B formalism to the B\u2217sB,B \u2217Bs system.\nWe now work with the couple channels B\u2217+B0s and B \u22170 s B +. The interaction potential is now identical to the one of Eqs. (10), (11) changing the masses accordingly, and exchanging a K\u2217 instead of a \u03c1 meson, which implies substituting 1 m2\u03c1 by 1 m2 K\u2217 in Eq. (11). We can anticipate that the combination 1\u221a 2 (B\u22170s B\n+ \u2212 B\u2217+B0s ) is the one that gets bound, or in other words, that when calculating the couplings of the state that we obtain to B\u22170s B + and B\u2217+B0s we will obtain results with about the same strength and opposite sign. Now the width of the state comes from the only possible sources of imaginary part, which in this case are the B\u2217 \u2192 B\u03b3 and B\u2217s \u2192 Bs\u03b3 decays in the corresponding loops. For the B\u2217s \u2192 Bs\u03b3 decay in the B\u22170s B+\nloop we use an analogous expression to Eq. (16) but changing the masses correspondingly and using for the on shell B\u2217s \u2192 Bs\u03b3 the theoretical value \u0393B\u2217s ' 0.22 keV, obtained from QCD sum rules [59].\nOn the other hand, the B\u2217sBs system contains only one channel and the interaction is mediated by \u03c6 exchange and it is repulsive, thus preventing the existence of any bound states for that system.\nD. B\u2217B\u2217 system\nThe vector-vector interaction in a unitarized form was addressed in [60, 61]. It is particularized to the D\u2217D\u2217 systems in [48]. We can sketch how the potentials are obtained. We work here in the isospin basis anticipating that the widths from BB and B\u2217B will be of the order of a few MeV, as found in [21] for the D\u2217D\u2217 system. In the unitary normalization suited for identical particles the states are\n|B\u2217B\u2217, I = 0\u3009 = 1 2\n( B\u2217+B\u22170 \u2212B\u22170B\u2217+ ) ,\n|B\u2217B\u2217, I = 1, I3 = 0\u3009 = 1\n2\n( B\u2217+B\u22170 +B\u22170B\u2217+ ) ,\n|B\u2217B, I = 1, I3 = 1\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( B\u2217+B\u2217+ ) . (18)\nThe interaction is obtained in the same way as in the case of BB, except that now we\nhave the extra factors\ni(1) i(3) j(2) j(4) for the diagonal terms [Figs. 3 (a), 3 (b)] , (19)\nand\ni(1) i(4) j(2) j(3) for the crossed terms [Fig. 3 (c)] . (20)\nThe apparent complexity due to the presence of the four polarization vectors is trivially solved by means of the spin projection operators [60], P(0), P(1), P(2), and the combinations of Eqs. (19), (20) are decomposed into\ni i j j = 3P(0) , i j i j = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) , i j j i = P(0) \u2212 P(1) + P(2) , (21)\nwhere we have assumed that the polarization vectors appear in the order of the particles 1, 2, 3, 4 as in Fig. 2(a). One can then obtain the interaction in all spin channels J = 0, 1, 2 (recall we have L = 0, J comes from spin combinations). The symmetry rules are automatically fulfilled and B\u2217B\u2217 in I = 0 (antisymmetric) can only appear in J = 1 (antisymmetric) and in I = 1 (symmetric) can only appear in J = 0, 2 (symmetric). The results obtained for B\u2217B\u2217, B\u2217sB \u2217, B\u2217sB \u2217 s , are identical to those obtained for the D \u2217D\u2217, D\u2217sD \u2217, D\u2217sD \u2217 s in Tables XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX of [48] which we reproduce below, omitting the contact term and the exchange of J/\u03c8 (here \u03a5) which are negligible.\nWe can see that the B\u2217B\u2217 in I = 0 and JP = 1+ is attractive, B\u2217B\u2217 in I = 1 is repulsive in the two J = 0, 2 allowed channels. The B\u2217sB \u2217 channel is attractive in JP = 1+ and the\nB\u2217sB \u2217 s is repulsive in the two J = 0, 2 allowed channels. We thus expect only bound states for B\u2217B\u2217, I = 0, JP = 1+ and B\u2217sB \u2217, I = 1 2 , JP = 1+."

            "text": "The evaluation of the width of the states follows exactly the same steps as the one of the D\u2217D\u2217 states done in [21], simply changing D\u2217 by B\u2217, and the results are identical, simply changing the masses. The decay of the B\u2217B\u2217 channels to BB is not allowed because all the B\u2217B\u2217 states have parity positive and spin S = 1. One needs L = 1 for BB to match the angular momentum but then parity is violated. Thus, the only allowed decay channel is the B\u2217B which involves an anomalous coupling. The V V decay into V P was addressed in [50] in the evaluation of the width of the D\u2217K\u0304\u2217 X0(3866) state. To give a width to the state the box diagrams including all possible B\u2217B intermediate states are evaluated and the imaginary part is obtained and added to the real potential evaluated in the former subsections. Then the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved with the complex potential. We plot |T |2 for the bound state, from where we obtain the mass and the width.

            "heading": "IV. RESULTS",
            "text": "A. B\u2217B states\nIn the first place we show the results that we obtain for the I = 0, JP = 1+ B\u2217B system. As we pointed out, the only source of imaginary part comes from the B\u2217 \u2192 B\u03b3 decay, with a very small width, as shown in Eq. (14). We thus should expect bound states with a\nvery narrow width. Indeed, in Fig.5 we plot the modulus squared of the B\u2217+B0 \u2192 B\u2217+B0 amplitude. The results are shown for three different values of qmax ranging from 400 MeV to 450 MeV, in line with the 420 MeV used in [4] to obtain the binding of the Tcc state. The plots peak at positions 10587, 10583 and 10577 MeV for qmax = 400, 420 and 450 MeV respectively, which give an idea of the uncertainty in the mass of the generated double bottom state. The vertical lines represent the thresholds of the B\u2217+B0 and B\u22170B+ channels.\nIt is worth noting that we get bindings bigger than those for the Tcc case [4], of the order of 20 MeV with respect to the B\u2217B threshold. This is in contrast with the 360 keV binding found in [2] for the Tcc.\nIt could be surprising at a first sight the fact that, using the same cut off, the binding obtained is bigger than for the Tcc case. We would like to note that this finding is common to observations done in quark model studies of tetraquarks, indicating a stronger attraction as the mass of the heavy quark increases [62]. Similar conclusions are reached in [28, 36, 63].\nWe can also evaluate the couplings of the generated states to the different channels. In the real axis and close to the pole position we can define the couplings gi to the i-th channels\nas\ntij ' gigj s\u2212 sR , i = 1, 2 for B\u2217+B0, B\u22170B+ , (25)\nwith sR \u2261M2R the square of the energy of the bound state. Therefore\ngigj = lim s\u2192sR\n(s\u2212 sR) tij(s), (26)\nwhich is nothing but the residue at the pole.\nWe find, for qmax = 420 MeV,\ng1 = 35954 MeV , g2 = \u221235798 MeV , (27)\nwhere g1, g2, have opposite sign as we anticipated. According to Eq. (13) this indicates a very neat I = 0 state, as we anticipated that only the I = 0 component could lead to a bound state.\nThe larger distance to the thresholds of the B\u2217+B0, B\u22170B+ states has as a consequence a smaller isospin breaking than the one found in the Tcc state, as can be seen by the proximity of g2 to \u2212g1. The width of the states can be obtained directly from the width of the peak zooming in the plots in Fig.5 or alternatively using that, at the peak,\nT11 = g21\ns\u2212 sR + iMR\u0393R \u21d2 \u0393R = \u2212 g21Im{T11} MR|T11|2 . (28)\nEither way gives the width of the doubly bottom generated state: 25, 14 and 4 eV for qmax = 400, 420 and 450 MeV respectively. These quantities are indeed extremely small, in line with the estimated 0.4 keV of the B\u2217 \u2192 B\u03b3 decay width, and have a large uncertainty. The smaller values of the width compared to the 400 eV of Eq. (14) stem from the use of the energy dependence of Eq. (16). If one uses a constant width for B\u2217 \u2192 B\u03b3, the widths obtained for the states are more in line with that latter number 1. This smallness could then make difficult to determine the width of this doubly bottom state experimentally. Yet the mode to observe it would be looking at the BB\u03b3 invariant mass distribution.\n1 We take advantage to mention that the present formalism is different, but related to the one used in [4],\nwhere a convolution of the G function was made. If we use the present method we obtain a width of\n39 keV for the Tcc state using the mass of the LHCb analysis of ref. [2].\nB. B\u2217sB,B \u2217Bs states\nIn Fig.6 we show the position of the peaks for the B\u2217sB,B \u2217Bs system as described in section II C. The positions are obtained at 10683, 10681 and 10677 MeV for qmax = 400, 420 and 450 MeV respectively, which are about 10 \u223c 15 MeV below the thresholds (10691.6 MeV for B\u2217+B0s and 10694.74 MeV for B \u22170 s B +).\nThe couplings of the generated state to B\u2217+B0s (1) and B \u22170 s B +(2), for qmax = 420 MeV,\nare\ng1 = 25240 MeV , g2 = \u221226845 MeV , (29)\nand, as anticipated in subsection II C, the couplings have opposite sign.\nThe widths obtained for the doubly bottom state are 60, 45 and 25 eV for qmax = 400,\n420 and 450 MeV respectively.\nThe results are qualitatively analogous to those found for the B\u2217B states and then similar\nconclusions as in section IV A can be deduced.\nC. B\u2217B\u2217 states\nIn this subsection we show the results obtained for the B\u2217B\u2217 system. Once again we obtain bound states for the same range of the qmax values in the line of those used for the Tcc. As shown in Fig. 7, we get bindings of the order of 20 MeV with respect to the B \u2217B\u2217 threshold. Changing qmax from 400 MeV to 450 MeV causes an increase of the binding by about 9 MeV. These bindings, although small, are considerably bigger than those found for the analogous D\u2217D\u2217 system in [21], of the order of 1\u2212 2 MeV. The width of the state is of the order of 8 MeV and the state becomes narrower as it approaches threshold, something already observed in [21], resulting from the general rule that the couplings of a bound state to its components go to zero as the binding goes to zero [64], which is generalized to coupled channels in [65, 66].\nThe width is modulated by the form factor of Eq. (23), but its dependence on the \u039b\nparameter is smooth as one can see in Fig. 8.\nD. B\u2217sB \u2217 states\nIn this subsection we show the results for the I = 1 2 , JP = 1+ B\u2217sB \u2217 system. In Fig. 9 we show the results of |T |2 for the B\u2217sB\u2217 amplitude. Depending on the choice of qmax we obtain again peaks corresponding to bound states of that system, more bound as qmax increases. The binding is of the order of 12 MeV and changing qmax from 400 MeV to 450 MeV increases the binding by about 6 MeV. The width is of the order of 0.5 MeV. The smaller width of the state, similar to the case of the D\u2217sD \u2217 versus D\u2217D\u2217 found in [21], is due to the fact that in the decay diagrams of B\u2217sB \u2217 \u2192 B\u2217sB or BsB\u2217 one is exchanging kaons rather than pions (see detailed related figures replacing D\u2217, D,D\u2217s , Ds by B \u2217, B,B\u2217s , Bs in Figs. 2,3,4,6 of [21]).\nOnce again, in Fig. 10 we show how the width changes with a change of the parameter\n\u039b and we observe that the changes are minor for a reasonable change of \u039b.\nWe summarise our results in Table V taking qmax = 420 MeV and \u039b = 1200 MeV."

            "text": "We have studied the interaction of the BB, B\u2217B, BsB, B \u2217 sB, B \u2217B\u2217, B\u2217Bs, B \u2217B\u2217s , BsBs,\nBsB \u2217 s , B \u2217 sB \u2217 s systems with an extension of the local hidden gauge approach, where one\nexchanges vector mesons between the bottom mesons. Only the exchange of the light vectors is taken into account, the exchange of the heavy ones being irrelevant. This picture, having the heavy quarks as spectators, automatically fulfills the rules of heavy quark symmetry.\nThe picture shows that we only have four systems bound, the B\u2217B in I = 0, B\u2217sB \u2212 B\u2217Bs in I = 1\n2 , B\u2217B\u2217 in I = 0 and B\u2217sB \u2217 in I = 1/2, all of them with JP = 1+. We have also\nconsidered the decay channels of theses systems: the BB\u03b3 for the B\u2217B system, BsB\u03b3 and BB\u03b3 for the B\u2217sB \u2212 B\u2217Bs system, B\u2217B for the B\u2217B\u2217 system, and B\u2217sB or B\u2217Bs for the B\u2217sB \u2217 system. The binding energy of these states is tied to the regulator of the loops in the intermediate states in the Bethe-Salpeter equation, but for that we use a cut off in the range of the one needed to obtain the binding energy of the Tcc state. With this input we can make predictions and find bound states in the four cases varying from 10 \u2212 20 MeV binding. The widths vary much, from the order of 10\u2212 50 eV for the B\u2217B and B\u2217sB\u2212B\u2217Bs systems to about 8 MeV in the case of the B\u2217B\u2217 system, or 0.5 MeV for the B\u2217sB \u2217 system. The accuracy of former predictions using the present framework make us confident on the predictions made here and should encourage the experimental search for these states with LHCb or other facilities.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants Nos. 11975009, 12175066, 12147219.
