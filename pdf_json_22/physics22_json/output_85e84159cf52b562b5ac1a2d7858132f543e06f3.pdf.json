    "abstractText": "We are developing a positron-electron plasma trap based on a dipole magnetic field generated by a levitated superconducting magnet to investigate the physics of magnetized plasmas with mass symmetry as well as antimatter components. Such laboratory magnetosphere is deemed essential for the understanding of pair plasmas in astrophysical environments, such as magnetars and blackholes, and represents a novel technology with potential applications in antimatter confinement and development of coherent gammaray lasers. The design of the device requires a preemptive analysis of the achievable self-organized steady states. In this study, we construct a theoretical model describing maximum entropy states of a collisionless positron-electron plasma confined by a dipole magnetic field, and demonstrate efficient confinement of both species under a wide range of physical parameters by analysing the effect of the three adiabatic invariants on the phase space distribution function. The theory is verified by numerical evaluation of spatial density, electrostatic potential, and toroidal rotation velocity for each species in correspondence of the maximum entropy state.",

            "text": "Pair plasmas consist of two species of charged particles having the same mass, but opposite electric charge. Such mass symmetry is in stark contrast with usual plasmas, where ions exhibit a significantly larger mass than the electron component, and it is the reason why pair plasmas are expected to possess peculiar turbulence, stability, and fluctuation properties [1]. Positron-electron plasmas are one example of naturally occurring pair plasmas, and can be found in astrophysical jets and magnetospheres of quasars [2, 3, 4], pulsars [5], and magnetars [6, 7, 8], where positrons and electrons are formed by pair production. More exotic pair plasmas, such as proton-antiproton plasmas, could occur as well in suitable astrophysical environments.\nPositron-electron plasma experiments based on magnetic mirrors have been considered in the past [9] and efforts are underway for their realization [10], while pair plasmas involving oppositely charged fullerene ions have been produced in the laboratory [11, 12]. Furthermore, positron-electron pair production is expected to occur during the disruptive phase of tokamaks [13]. At present, positron-electron plasma confinement schemes based on dipole magnetic fields represent an active area of research due to recent technological advancement in trap design [14, 15, 16, 17], positron accumulation [18, 19], and positron injection [20, 21]. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of a dipole magnetic field makes these magnetic configurations suitable to confine both neutral and nonnetutral plasmas, in contrast with magnetic traps relying on a straight homogeneous magnetic field, which are appropriate for nonneutral plasmas [22, 23, 24].\nIf realized, a positron-electron plasma based on a dipole magnetic field has several potential applications ranging from the experimental study of astrophysical systems such as astrophysical jets, quasars, and pulsars, to matter and antimatter confinement, potentially providing confinement to a large amount of charged particles (mainly depending on the properties of the matter/antimatter source) for a long time (300 seconds and\nbeyond [25]) without requiring external electric fields, and to development of coherent gamma-ray sources (gamma-ray lasers) that exploit the annihilation of positron-electron pairs.\nThe target parameters for a laboratory positron-electron plasma are expected to ensure a high-degree of stability not seen in standard ion-electron plasmas [26, 27]. In such confinement regime, the gyroradius rc = mv\u22a5/ |q|B is smaller than the Debye length \u03bbD = ( \u01eb0kBT/2ne 2 )1/2\n, which is smaller than the system size R, i.e. rc << \u03bbD << R. Here, m denotes the particle mass, v\u22a5 the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field B, q the electric charge, B the modulus of the magnetic field, \u01eb0 the vacuum permittivity, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, n the spatial density, and e = |q|. For a positron-electron plasma with B \u223c 1T , n \u223c 1012m\u22123, kBT \u223c 10 eV , and R \u223c 1m, one obtains rc \u223c 10\u22125m and \u03bbD \u223c 2 10\u22122m. Furthermore, the plasma parameter \u039b = 4\u03c0n\u03bb3D = (1/4 \u221a 2\u03c0) (rd/rC)\n3/2 \u223c 108 >> 1 is large, implying that the typical distance among particles rd = n\n\u22121/3 \u223c 10\u22124m is much larger than the distance rC = e2/4\u03c0\u01eb0kBT \u223c 10\u221210 m at which the Coulomb energy becomes comparable with the average kinetic energy. This makes the system weakly coupled, and diffusive (entropy maximizing) processes are dominated by collective electromagnetic fluctuations rather than localized Coulomb collisions.\nAt present, we are developing a positron-electron plasma trap based on a dipole magnetic field generated by a levitated superconducting coil operating in the plasma regime described above. This requires a preemptive analysis of the achievable plasma confinement. The aim of this study is thus to explore the nature of maximum entropy states that are self-organized by the plasma, and to assess the degree of confinement of both species. In this context, a maximum entropy state is defined as the distribution function of largest entropy that is compatible with the macroscopic constraints affecting the system, such as conservation of total particle number, total energy, or total magnetic moment. Since a positron-electron system is formally analogous to any two-species plasma, such as an ion-electron plasma, thermal equilibria in a positron-electron plasma can be inferred from those of a two-species plasma. It is therefore important to stress that the core issue examined in the present paper is not the study of two-species thermal equilibria, which is an established matter, but the elucidation of the effect of the conservation of adiabatic invariants on self-organized maximum entropy states in two-species plasmas, a problem that is not discussed in the literature.\nOnce built, the positron-electron plasma trap will be used to study both waves and transport phenomena, which are expected to be in the 1 kHz and 1Hz frequency range respectively based on previous experimental data from the RT-1 device [25]. Hence, we aim at achieving confinement on time scales \u03c4c of the order of 1 s. Since in the present setting the Coulomb scattering frequency is of the order \u03bdC \u223c 1Hz, the plasma is expected to be quite collisionless, while the main mechanism increasing the entropy of the system is given by collective electromagnetic fluctuations. Hence, we shall develop the theory by assuming that Coulomb collisions can be neglected.\nIt should be emphasized that accumulating 1011-1012 positrons in a volume \u2126 \u223c 1m3 requires the development of positron accumulation and injection technologies. In the present trap design, positrons will be produced by a 10 eV pulsed positron source located at The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science [18], and progressively accumulated into a buffer-gas trap until a total positron number Np \u223c 1011 is reached. The positrons will then be released into the dipole trap over a time interval of 10\u00b5s, reaching a particle density in the target range 1011-1012m\u22123. Efficient injection schemes are also being developed to minimize losses at the injection phase.\nIn addition to the technological hurdles listed above, other factors, such as particle loss associated with turbulent transport and plasma instability, may affect the quality of confinement. These aspects, which have been investigated in dipole geometry within the frameworks of MHD and gyrokinetics (see e.g. [28, 29, 30]), will not be addressed in the present paper, since its scope is limited at establishing the existence of stable maximum entropy equilibria toward which the positron-electron plasma is expected to converge under ideal conditions.\nIn an inhomogeneous magnetic field such as a dipole magnetic field, the properties of the equilibrium states are strongly dependent on the presence of adiabatic invariants [31]. When the time scale of collective electromagnetic fluctuations within the plasma are longer than the period of cyclotron gyration, bounce motion, or toroidal drift, the corresponding adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment \u00b5, bounce action J\u2016, or magnetic flux \u03a8) is conserved by the dynamics of a single charged particle. Indeed, the essential feature\nof adiabatic invariants is that they remain approximately constant as long as perturbations acting on a dynamical system are slow compared with the period of adiabatic motion. This results in a set of constraints on the equilibrium distribution function of the system, which departs from a standard Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution [32, 33, 34]. To understand how this occurs, it is useful to consider the limiting case in which the value of one adiabatic invariant, say \u00b5, is preserved exactly. Then, on each phase space submanifold corresponding to a level set of \u00b5 (a \u00b5-leaf) the effective phase space measure is reduced to Bdxdydzdv\u2016, where (x, y, z) are Cartesian coordinates and v\u2016 denotes the velocity along the magnetic field. If f\u00b5 ( x, y, z, v\u2016 )\nis the distribution function on a \u00b5-leaf, entropy maximizing processes such as cross-field diffusion lead to a flattening of f\u00b5, with a corresponding relaxed spatial density n = B \u222b\nf\u00b5dv\u2016d\u00b5 \u223c B, which is inhomogeneous for an inhomogeneousB (for further details see [34, 35, 36]). Therefore, a statistical description of maximum entropy states must take into account the nontrivial role played by adiabatic invariants in shaping the distribution function of each particle species.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we derive the maximum entropy distribution functions of positrons and electrons by taking into account the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant, and obtain the corresponding form of the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential. In sections 3 and 4, we study the effect of the second and third adiabatic invariants on positron-electron plasma maximum entropy states. In section 5, we report spatial densities and electrostatic potential obtained by numerical solution of the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential, and demonstrate efficient confinement of both species. In section 6, we study the toroidal rotation velocity profile of the positron-electron plasma, and find that it departs from the rigid rotation occurring in magnetic traps relying on a straight homogeneous magnetic field. Concluding remarks are given in section 7.\nWe remark that the theory developed in the present paper holds provided that the macroscopic constraints defining each statistical ensemble (total particle number, total energy, total magnetic moment, and so on) are preserved throughout the relaxation of the system. In particular, the period of the slowest adiabatic motion must be considerably smaller than the typical time scale of the fastest turbulent fluctuations in the system. However, in real experiments particles and energy will be lost via different mechanisms, such as by interaction with the vessel boundary, and the degree of conservation of adiabatic invariants will not be perfect. Therefore, the theory will be quantitatively accurate only if such losses are not too large. Nevertheless, we expect the theory to remain qualitatively consistent even in the presence of large losses since the surviving (trapped component) of the plasma should eventually converge toward the derived maximum entropy states.\nFinally, notice that the present theory does not make any predictions on the nature of electromagnetic fluctuations. It only provides information on the maximum entropy state that results from the action of these fluctuations, which act to increase the entropy of the system. Hence, although the model cannot describe transient phenomena such as waves, transport, or diffusion, it is sufficient to describe the \u2018final\u2019 state of the system, i.e. the equilibrium toward which the plasma tends to settle over a sufficiently long time interval."

            "text": "electron plasma\nIn the following lower indexes p and e will be used to specify positrons and electrons respectively. In a static equilibrium, the electrostatic potential \u03a6 is determined by the Poisson equation\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u2212 \u03c1 \u01eb0 . (1)\nHere, \u03c1 is the electric charge density and \u01eb0 the vacuum permittivity. In a positron-electron plasma, the charge density can be expressed as \u03c1 = e (np \u2212 ne) , (2) where e is the positron charge, \u2212e the electron charge, np the positron number density, and ne the electron number density. Denoting with fp the probability distribution function of positrons, with fe the probability\ndistribution function of electrons, with Np the total number of positrons , and with Ne the total number of electrons, the number densities np and ne can be evaluated as\nnp = Np\n\u222b\nR3\nfp d 3p, ne = Ne\n\u222b\nR3\nfe d 3p. (3)\nIn this notation d3p denotes the volume element in momentum space. Let \u2126 \u2282 R3 denote the spatial volume occupied by the positron-electron plasma, \u03a0 = R3 \u00d7 \u2126 the phase space of the system, and d\u03a0 = d3pd3x the phase space measure. Notice that the phase space measure d\u03a0 is invariant due to Liouville\u2019s theorem arising from the underlying Hamiltonian structure, and therefore serves as the natural measure with respect to which the ergodic hypothesis of statistical mechanics is enforced. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the measure d\u03a0 remains invariant for any reduced subsystem of charged particle dynamics, such as guiding center dynamics. Next, we consider a guiding center plasma such that the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 is a constant of motion of (isolated) charged particle dynamics. Here, the magnetic moment \u00b5 [37, 38, 39] is defined as\n\u00b5 = m |v\u22a5 \u2212 vd|2\n2B = mv2c 2B , (4)\nwhere v\u22a5 is the particle velocity across the magnetic field, vd the component of v independent of the cyclotron phase \u03d1c and comprising the guiding center drifts, vc = v\u22a5 \u2212 vd the cyclotron velocity with modulus vc, B the modulus of the magnetic field B, and m the particle mass (which is the same for both positrons and electrons).\nFor the first adiabatic invariant to be preserved, the time scale Tf of fluctuations in particle energy caused by electromagnetic turbulence must be longer than the time scale of cyclotron motion Tc, i.e.\nTf >> Tc = 2\u03c0\n\u03c9c =\n2\u03c0m\neB , (5)\nwhere \u03c9c denotes the cyclotron frequency. In the following, we shall therefore assume that the condition (5) holds. We also recall that the conservation of the quantity (4), usually referred to as lowest order magnetic moment, rests on the additional requirement that the wavelength \u03bb of any fluctuation is longer than the Larmor radius \u03c1c, i.e. \u03c1c << \u03bb. In this setting, the guiding center Hamiltonian functions for positron and electrons have expressions\nHp = 1\n2 mv2\u2016 + \u00b5B + e\u03a6, He =\n1 2 mv2\u2016 + \u00b5B \u2212 e\u03a6. (6)\nHere v\u2016 is the velocity component along the magnetic field. Observe that the drift velocity vd does not contribute to the energies (6) under the assumption that the corresponding kinetic energy is small compared to the other terms. This is true, for example, when the potential energy e\u03a6/kBT \u223c \u01eb, with \u01eb = \u03c1c/L, L the characteristic scale lenght of the magnetic field, and kBT a characteristic plasma temperature, represents a small perturbation of the particle energy (for additional details on this point see discussion at the end of section 4 or [38]). Then, the Shannon entropies Sp and Se, the total probabilities Pp and Pe, the total energies Ep and Ee, and the total magnetic moments Mp and Me of the system can be written as\nSp =\u2212 \u222b\n\u03a0\nNpfp log (Npfp) d\u03a0, Se = \u2212 \u222b\n\u03a0\nNefe log (Nefe) d\u03a0, (7a)\nPp =\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nfpd\u03a0, Pe =\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nfed\u03a0, (7b)\nEp =Np\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nfpHp d\u03a0, Ee = Ne\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nfeHe d\u03a0 (7c)\nMp =Np\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nfp\u00b5 d\u03a0, Me = Ne\n\u222b\n\u03a0\nfe\u00b5 d\u03a0. (7d)\nUnder the ansatz (7a) for the entropy measure associated with each particle species, the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system can be obtained by maximization of entropy under the constraint imposed by the constancy of Pp, Pe, Ep, Ee, Mp, and Me (for further details on this approach see [33, 34]). Introducing Lagrange multipliers \u03b1p, \u03b1e, \u03b2p, \u03b2e, \u03b3p, and \u03b3e, we therefore define the target functional\nF [fp, fe] = Sp + Se \u2212 \u03b1pNpPp \u2212 \u03b1eNePe \u2212 \u03b2pEp \u2212 \u03b2eEe \u2212 \u03b3pMp \u2212 \u03b3eMe. (8)\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations obtained by variation of (8) with respect to fp and fe are:\nfp =Ap exp {\u2212\u03b2pHp \u2212 \u03b3p\u00b5} , (9a) fe =Ae exp {\u2212\u03b2eHe \u2212 \u03b3e\u00b5} , (9b)\nwhere Ap = N \u22121 p exp {\u22121\u2212 \u03b1p} and Ae = N\u22121e exp {\u22121\u2212 \u03b1e} are normalization factors such that\n\u222b\n\u03a0 fp d\u03a0 =\n\u222b\n\u03a0 fe d\u03a0 = 1. In the same way \u03b2p and \u03b2e represent the characteristic inverse temperatures of the two particle species, the Lagrange multipliers \u03b3p and \u03b3e can be interpreted as chemical potentials describing the macroscopic energy changes \u03b2pdEp = \u03b3pdMp and \u03b2edEe = \u03b3edMe occurring when magnetic moments dMp, dMe are added to the system.\nNext, it is useful to explain why Coulomb collisions have been neglected in the derivation of the collisionless equilibria (9). First, recall that in the present setting the (collective) electric potential \u03a6 changes over a time scale Tf that is much longer than the cyclotron time scale Tc. This ensures that the individual magnetic moments of the particles remain constant, unless local Coulomb collisions occur. For the plasma regime under consideration, the frequency \u03bdC of such collisions can be estimated [40] as \u03bdC \u223c 5 10\u221211nT\u22123/2 \u223c 1Hz, where n = 1012m\u22123 is the particle density and T = 10 eV the temperature. Hence, over the confinement time scales \u03c4c \u223c 1/\u03bdC \u223c 1 s considered in the model they are negligible, their effect being felt only over longer time intervals where particles undergo mostly small deflections with small changes in their kinetic energies. Indeed, recall that the distance rC \u223c 10\u221210m at which Coulomb interactions are dominant is smaller than the typical particle distance rd \u223c 10\u22124m.\nWe also remark that if a net transfer of total energy or total magnetic moment occurs between positrons and electrons, only the sums Ep + Ee and Mp +Me are preserved. Such scenario can be taken into account by setting \u03b2 = \u03b2e = \u03b2p and \u03b3 = \u03b3p = \u03b3e.\nThe expressions (9) for the distribution functions fp and fe can now be used to determine the spatial number densities np and ne according to (3). To evaluate the integral in (3), the phase space measure d\u03a0 must be expressed in a more convenient set of magnetic coordinates. To this end, we restrict our attention to magnetic fields of the type B = \u2207\u03a8 \u00d7\u2207\u03d5, (10) where \u03a8 denotes the flux function and \u03d5 the toroidal angle. Introducing a length coordinate \u2113 along magnetic field lines with tangent vector \u2202\u2113 = B/B, the functions (\u2113,\u03a8, \u03d5) define a set of curvilinear coordinates with Jacobian \u2207\u2113 \u00b7 \u2207\u03a8\u00d7\u2207\u03d5 = B\u2207\u2113 \u00b7 \u2202\u2113 = B. (11) Next, decompose the particle velocity as\nv = v\u2016 + vc + vd, (12)\nwhere v\u2016 = v\u2016B/B is the velocity component along B, vc the cyclotron velocity such that mv 2 c = 2\u00b5B (recall (4)), and vd = vd (x) the particle drift velocity across B. Notice that (12) represents the velocity of a charged particle, and not the guiding center velocity. Furthermore, the drift velocity vd comprising E \u00d7B, gradient, and curvature drifts is treated as a spatial function, which is expected to be a valid approximation in a time-independent setting since in a vacuum field gradient and curvature drifts can be expressed as 2kBTB \u00d7 \u03ba/qB2, with \u03ba the field curvature, kBT the temperature, and q = \u00b1e the relevant electric charge. Let r denote the cylindrical radius, \u03d1c the phase of the cyclotron gyration, and A = \u03a8\u2207\u03d5 the vector potential associated with the magnetic field (10). Then, the particle momentum p = mv + qA can be decomposed on the orthonormal set of basis vectors\n(\n\u2202\u2113, \u2207\u03a8 |\u2207\u03a8| , r\u2207\u03d5\n)\n, (13)\nas\np = p\u2016\u2202\u2113 + p\u03a8 \u2207\u03a8 |\u2207\u03a8| + p\u03d5 r r\u2207\u03d5, (14)\nwith\np\u2016 =mv\u2016, (15a)\np\u03a8 =m\n(\nvc sin\u03d1c + vd \u00b7 \u2207\u03a8 |\u2207\u03a8|\n)\n, (15b)\np\u03d5 =mr (vc cos\u03d1c + rvd \u00b7 \u2207\u03d5) + q\u03a8.

(20)\ngoverning the spatial behavior of the electrostatic potential \u03a6 within the magnetized positron-electron plasma under the effect of the magnetic field (10).\nIt is useful to consider equation (20) in the following limits. First, if Ne >> Np the system approaches a pure electron plasma. In such case equation (20) reduces to\n\u2206\u03a6 = e (2\u03c0m)\n3 2 AeNe\n\u01eb0 \u221a \u03b2e\nB exp {\u03b2ee\u03a6} \u03b3e + \u03b2eB . (21)\nSecondly, if Np = Ne = N , the inverse temperature of the positron plasma equals that of the electron plasma \u03b2p = \u03b2e = \u03b2, and the Lagrange multipliers associated with conservation of magnetic moment satisfy \u03b3p = \u03b3e = \u03b3 as well, equation (20) becomes\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u2212e (2\u03c0m) 3 2 N\n\u01eb0 \u221a \u03b2\nB\n\u03b3 + \u03b2B (Ap exp {\u2212\u03b2e\u03a6} \u2212Ae exp {\u03b2e\u03a6}) . (22)\nFinally, if sufficiently long time scales are considered, the conservation of the total magnetic moments Mp and Me is expected to break down. This scenario corresponds to the limit \u03b3p = \u03b3e = 0, which gives\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u2212e (2\u03c0m) 3 2\n\u01eb0\n(\nApNp\n\u03b2 3 2 p\nexp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6} \u2212 AeNe\n\u03b2 3 2 e\nexp {\u03b2ee\u03a6} ) . (23)\nBy further demanding Ne >> Np, one recovers the Liouville equation\n\u2206\u03a6 = eAeNe\n\u01eb0\n(\n2\u03c0m\n\u03b2e\n) 3 2\nexp {\u03b2ee\u03a6} . (24)\nWe conclude this section by observing that the departure from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics occurring in equilibria such as (9) implies that the physical plasma temperatures (which differ from the temperatures Tp and Te associated with the Lagrange multipliers \u03b2p = (kBTp) \u22121 and \u03b2e = (kBTe) \u22121\n) are not spatially uniform. Indeed, integrals of the type\nkBTp\u22a5 (x) =\n\u222b\nR3 \u00b5Bfp d 3p \u222b\nR3 fp d3p\n, kBTp\u2016 (x) =\n\u222b\nR3 m 2 v 2 \u2016fp d 3p \u222b\nR3 fp d3p\n, (25)\nwill generally exhibit a spatial dependence caused by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. Here, Tp\u22a5 and Tp\u2016 are the perpendicular and parallel temperatures of the positron plasma. For example, using equations (9a) and (16), one obtains\nkBTp\u22a5 (x) = B (x)\n\u03b2pB (x) + \u03b3p . (26)"

            "text": "In this section, we consider a regime of plasma such that charged particles preserve both the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 and the second adiabatic invariant (bounce action) J\u2016, which is defined by\nJ\u2016 = m\n2\u03c0\n\u222b b\na\nv\u2217\u2016 ds. (27)\nHere, a and b denote the bouncing points along a field line with line element ds, while\nv\u2217\u2016 (E, \u00b5, \u2113,\u03a8, \u03d5) =\n\u221a\n2 m (E \u2212 \u00b5B \u2212 q\u03a6), (28)\nrepresents the parallel velocity as a function of particle energy E, magnetic moment \u00b5, and spatial position (\u2113,\u03a8, \u03d5). The conservation of the second adiabatic invariant (27) requires that time scale Tf of energy fluctuations caused by electromagnetic turbulence is longer than the time scale of bounce motion Tb, i.e.\nTf >> Tb = 2\u03c0\n\u03c9b , (29)\nwhere \u03c9b denotes the bounce frequency. The (half) period Tb of the bounce oscillation can be written as\nTb =\n\u222b b\na\nds v\u2217\u2016 . (30)\nIn the following we shall therefore assume that both (5) and (29) hold. Next, observe that the bounce averaged kinetic energy \u3008K\u2016\u3009b along the magnetic field can be evaluated as\n\u3008K\u2016\u3009b = m\n2Tb\n\u222b tb\nta\nv\u22172\u2016 dt = m\u03c9b 4\u03c0\n\u222b b\na\nv\u2217\u2016ds = 1\n2 \u03c9bJ\u2016, (31)\nwhere ta and tb are the instants at which the particle position reaches the bounce points a and b, while \u3008 \u3009b denotes averaging over a bounce oscillation.\nThe actual magnetic field strength within the planned positron-electron trap will not be symmetric under vertical reflections z \u2192 \u2212z due to a support coil placed at the top of the device to keep the main superconducting coil generating the dipole magnetic field levitated. Therefore, an accurate model of the trap would need to take into account such asymmetry. This problem will not be considered here to simplify the analysis, and a pure dipole mangnetic field will be assumed. Due to the axial symmetry and reflection symmetry of the dipole magnetic field strength B, one has a = \u2212b as well as \u2202v\u2217\u2016/\u2202\u03d5 = 0. Next, suppose that the number of positrons equals the number of electrons, Np = Ne. Then, we may assume the electric potential energy q\u03a6 to be small compared to the energy stored in the cyclotron gyration, \u00b5B >> |q\u03a6|. In this case, equations (27) and (30) can be simplified to\nJ\u2016 =\n\u221a 2m\n\u03c0\n\u222b b(E,\u00b5,\u03a8)\n0\n\u221a E \u2212 \u00b5B (s,\u03a8) ds, Tb = \u221a 2m \u222b b(E,\u00b5,\u03a8)\n0\nds \u221a\nE \u2212 \u00b5B (s,\u03a8) , (32)\nwhere the bouncing point b (E, \u00b5,\u03a8) > 0 is given as the positive solution of the equation E = \u00b5B (b,\u03a8), provided that such solution exists. Notice that both bounce action J\u2016 and bounce frequency \u03c9b = 2\u03c0/Tb are independent of particle charge q according to (32), and therefore they have the same expression for both positrons and electrons. Now observe that, using the identity (31) for the kinetic energy along the magnetic field, the positron energy and the electron energy can be approximated as\nH\u0303p = 1\n2 \u03c9bJ\u2016 + \u00b5B + e\u03a6, H\u0303e =\n1 2 \u03c9bJ\u2016 + \u00b5B \u2212 e\u03a6. (33)\nThe errors Hp \u2212 H\u0303p and He \u2212 H\u0303e committed in replacing the energies Hp, He with H\u0303p, H\u0303e evidently goes to zero when averaged over a bounce oscillation, \u3008Hp \u2212 H\u0303p\u3009b = \u3008He \u2212 H\u0303e\u3009b = 0. In the following we shall be concerned with relaxation time scales \u03c4 longer than the bounce period, \u03c4 >> Tb, and use the approximate expressions (33) for the particles energies. As it will be shown later, this approach simplifies calculations involving the particles distribution functions.\nThe conservation of the second adiabatic invariant gives rise to a macroscopic constraint on the statistical behavior of the system, which can be represented by adding the total bounce actions Jp and Je given by\nJp = Np \u222b\n\u03a0\nfpJ\u2016 d\u03a0, Je = Ne \u222b\n\u03a0\nfeJ\u2016 d\u03a0, (34)\nin the target functional (8) for the entropy principle. Introducing Lagrange multipliers \u03b6p and \u03b6e, the resulting expressions for the distribution functions fp and fe are\nfp =Ap exp { \u2212\u03b2pH\u0303p \u2212 \u03b3p\u00b5\u2212 \u03b6pJ\u2016 } , (35a)\nfe =Ae exp { \u2212\u03b2eH\u0303e \u2212 \u03b3e\u00b5\u2212 \u03b6eJ\u2016 } . (35b)\nObserve that Hp and He have been replaced with the approximated values H\u0303p and H\u0303e. Our next goal is to evaluate the spatial particle densities (3), so that Poisson\u2019s equation (1) can be applied to compute \u03a6. To this end, the phase space measure d\u03a0 must be expressed in a new set of coordinates that is appropriate to carry out integrals in momentum space. First, consider the change of variables ( \u2113, v\u2016, \u03d5,\u03a8, \u03b8c, \u00b5 )\n\u2192 (\u2113, E, \u03d5,\u03a8, \u03b8c, \u00b5) with E = mv2\u2016/2 + \u00b5B + q\u03a6. Recalling (17), we thus have\nd\u03a0 = m2d\u2113dv\u2016d\u03d5d\u03a8d\u03d1cd\u00b5 = m\nv\u2217\u2016 d\u2113dEd\u03d5d\u03a8d\u03d1cd\u00b5. (36)\nNext, perform the transformation (\u2113, E, \u03d5,\u03a8, \u03b8c, \u00b5) \u2192 ( \u2113, J\u2016, \u03d5,\u03a8, \u03b8c, \u00b5 ) . In order to express the phase space\nmeasure in terms of the new coordinates, we must compute the partial derivative\n\u2202J\u2016 \u2202E = lim dE\u21920 m \u03c0dE\n[\n\u222b b(E+dE,\u00b5,\u03a8)\n0\nv\u2217\u2016 (E + dE, \u00b5, s,\u03a8) ds\u2212 \u222b b(E,\u00b5,\u03a8)\n0\nv\u2217\u2016 (E, \u00b5, s,\u03a8) ds\n]\n= lim dE\u21920\nm\n\u03c0dE\n[\ndE\n\u222b b\n0\n\u2202v\u2217\u2016 \u2202E (E, \u00b5, s,\u03a8) ds+ dE \u2202b \u2202E (E, \u00b5,\u03a8) v\u2217\u2016 (E, \u00b5, b,\u03a8)\n]\n= 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b b\n0\nds\nv\u2217\u2016 (E, \u00b5, s,\u03a8) =\nTb 2\u03c0 = 1 \u03c9b .\n(37)\nObserve that here we used the fact that v\u2217\u2016 (E, \u00b5, b,\u03a8) = 0. It follows that\nd\u03a0 = m2d\u2113dv\u2016d\u03d5d\u03a8d\u03d1cd\u00b5 = m\u03c9b v\u2217\u2016 d\u2113dJ\u2016d\u03d5d\u03a8d\u03d1cd\u00b5. (38)\nTo proceed, it is convenient to approximate the Jacobian v\u2217\u2016/m\u03c9b with its bounce average,\n\u2329 v\u2217\u2016 m\u03c9b \u232a\nb\n= 2\nm\u03c9bTb\n\u222b tb\n0\nv\u2217\u2016 dt = b\nm\u03c0 , (39)\nwhere we used the fact that by definition \u03c9b = \u03c9b (E, \u00b5,\u03a8) and therefore \u2202\u03c9b/\u2202\u2113 = 0. The bounce averaged phase space measure thus reads as\nd\u03a0\u0303 = m\u03c0\nb d\u2113dJ\u2016d\u03d5d\u03a8d\u03d1cd\u00b5 = m\u03c0\nB b dJ\u2016d\u03d1cd\u00b5d 3x. (40)\nThe spatial densities np and ne can now be computed as follows. For the positron component we have\nnp =m\u03c0ApNpB\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u00b5\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndJ\u2016\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03d1cb \u22121 exp\n{ \u2212\u03b2p ( 1\n2 \u03c9bJ\u2016 + \u00b5B + e\u03a6\n) \u2212 \u03b3p\u00b5\u2212 \u03b6pJ\u2016 }\n=2m\u03c02ApNpB\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u00b5\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndJ\u2016b \u22121 exp\n{ \u2212\u03b2p ( 1\n2 \u03c9bJ\u2016 + \u00b5B + e\u03a6\n) \u2212 \u03b3p\u00b5\u2212 \u03b6pJ\u2016 } .\n(41)\nTo simplify (41) we now follow the approach developed in [34]. In general, the expression of the bounce frequency \u03c9b is a function of J\u2016, \u00b5, and \u03a8. However, the dependence on the bounce action J\u2016 disappears in the limit b/L << 1 in which the bounce orbit size b is shorter than the characteristic magnetic field line length L. Indeed, in this limit we may expand the magnetic field in powers of \u2113 around the equatorial point \u2113 = 0 of the dipole to obtain a second order equation for the bounce position,\nE = \u00b5B (0,\u03a8) + 1 2 \u00b5 \u22022B \u2202\u21132 (0,\u03a8) b2. (42)\nHere, we used the fact that \u2202B/\u2202\u2113 = 0 at \u2113 = 0. It is also worth observing that in a dipole field \u22022B/\u2202\u21132 (0,\u03a8) > 0 since B has a minimum at \u2113 = 0 for each magnetic surface \u03a8. Setting B0 = B (0,\u03a8) and B\u2032\u20320 = ( \u22022B/\u2202\u21132 ) (0,\u03a8), the positive bounce point b can therefore be approximated as\nb =\n\u221a\n2 (E \u2212 \u00b5B0) \u00b5B\u2032\u20320 . (43)\nFor a typical particle at \u2113 = 0, the energy E can be decomposed into a perpendicular component E\u22a50 = \u00b5B0 and a parallel component E\u20160 = \u03b10pE\u22a50 = \u03b10p\u00b5B0, where \u03b10p (\u03a8) > 0 is the local positron temperature anisotropy at the equator. We may therefore estimate\n1 b \u2248 \u221a B\u2032\u20320 2\u03b10pB0 . (44)\nSimilarly, at second order the bounce frequency becomes\n1\n\u03c9b =\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b b\n0\nds \u221a\n2 m\n( E \u2212 \u00b5B0 \u2212 12\u00b5B\u2032\u20320 s2 )\n=\n\u221a m\n\u03c0 \u221a\n\u00b5B\u2032\u20320\n\u222b b\n\u221a\n\u00b5B\u2032\u2032 0\n2(E\u2212\u00b5B0)\n0\ndy \u221a\n1\u2212 y2 =\n\u221a m\n2 \u221a \u00b5B\u2032\u20320 . (45)\nNotice that in the last passage equation (43) was used. Observe that the bounce frequency is now a function of \u00b5 and \u03a8 only. Recalling equation (41), we thus arrive at the following expression for the positron density\nnp =2m\u03c0 2ApNpB\n\u221a\nB\u2032\u20320 2\u03b10pB0 exp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6} \u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u00b5\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndJ\u2016 exp\n{ \u2212 (\u03b2pB + \u03b3p)\u00b5\u2212 ( \u03b2p \u221a \u00b5B\u2032\u20320 m + \u03b6p ) J\u2016 } ,\n=2m\u03c02ApNpB\n\u221a\nB\u2032\u20320 2\u03b10pB0 exp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6} \u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u00b5 exp {\u2212 (\u03b2pB + \u03b3p)\u00b5}\n\u03b2p\n\u221a\n\u00b5B\u2032\u20320 m + \u03b6p\n=2m\u03c02ApNp B \u221a\n2\u03b10pB0 exp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6} \u03b2pB + \u03b3p \u222b \u221e 0\ne\u2212y dy\n\u03b2p \u221a\ny m(\u03b2pB+\u03b3p) + \u03b6p\u221a B\u2032\u20320\n.\n(46)\nA similar expression can be obtained for the electron density ne by flipping the sign of the electric charge, and the Poisson equation (1) for the electrostatic potential \u03a6 becomes\n\u2206\u03a6 =\u2212 2em\u03c0 2\n\u01eb0 B\u221a 2B0\n\n  ApNp exp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6}\u221a \u03b10p (\u03b2pB + \u03b3p) \u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212y dy\n\u03b2p \u221a\ny m(\u03b2pB+\u03b3p) + \u03b6p\u221a B\u2032\u20320\n\u2212 AeNe exp {\u03b2ee\u03a6}\u221a \u03b10e (\u03b2eB + \u03b3e) \u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212y dy\n\u03b2e \u221a\ny m(\u03b2eB+\u03b3e) + \u03b6e\u221a B\u2032\u20320\n\n \n(47)\nThe last integral in equation (46) can be written in terms of special functions. Furthermore, it gives a simple result in the limit \u03b6p/\u03b2p\u03c9b << 1. Indeed, one obtains\nnp = 2\u03c0 (m\u03c0)3/2 ApNp\n\u03b2p\nB exp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6} \u221a\n2\u03b10pB0 (\u03b2pB + \u03b3p) . (48)\nHere, it should be noted that although the Lagrange multiplier \u03b6p has been neglected, and thus the conservation of the total bounce action Jp is not felt by the ensemble, the effect of bounce motion on the particle distribution does not disappear. This is because bounce dynamics is encapsulated in the term \u03c9bJ\u2016/2 of the Hamiltonian H\u0303p appearing in the distribution function fp. Observing that in the same limit \u03b6e/\u03b2e\u03c9b << 1 the electron density becomes\nne = 2\u03c0 (m\u03c0)3/2 AeNe\n\u03b2e\nB exp {\u03b2ee\u03a6} \u221a\n2\u03b10eB0 (\u03b2eB + \u03b3e) , (49)\nthe corresponding form of the Poisson equation (1) for the electrostatic potential \u03a6 therefore reads\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u22122\u03c0e (m\u03c0) 3/2\n\u01eb0\nB\u221a 2B0\n[\nApNp exp {\u2212\u03b2pe\u03a6} \u03b2p \u221a \u03b10p (\u03b2pB + \u03b3p) \u2212 AeNe exp {\u03b2ee\u03a6} \u03b2e \u221a \u03b10e (\u03b2eB + \u03b3e)\n]\n.

Since \u03c9d is mainly determined by the E \u00d7B, curvature, and gradient drift velocities, this frequency is usually smaller than the cyclotron and bounce frequencies, and (53) poses a rather stringent condition on the allowed turbulent spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations.\nFinally, we remark that the contributions to the particle energy coming from the guiding center drifts are neglected in the guiding center energies H\u0303p, H\u0303e under the assumption that the corresponding kinetic energy is smaller than the other terms. In particular, this is true if the kinetic energy associated with the E \u00d7 B drift vE = E \u00d7 B/B2 satisfies the ordering m |vE |2 /2 << H\u0303p, H\u0303e. Such configuration can be achieved for example when the electric potential \u03a6 is a first order contribution in the ratio \u01eb \u223c \u03c1c/L, where \u03c1c is the Larmor radius and L the characteristic scale length of the magnetic field.

In particular, we choose R = 1m and r0 = 0.1m, which are values of the same order of the length parameters of the planned positron-electron trap. The dipole magnetic field used to confine the plasma is generated by a current loop of infinitesimal section and radius rl = 0.25m enclosed in an axially symmetric toroidal box (coil) with squared cross section whose left size is located at rbox = 0.2m (see [41] for the expression of the magnetic field). The typical magnetic field generated by the current loop is around B \u223c 0.1T and reaches B \u223c 2T in close proximity of the bounding\nbox. It is also convenient to introduce the characteristic magnetic field B\u2217 = \u00b50I/2rl = 1.25T where \u00b50 is the vacuum permeability and I the electric current flowing within the current loop. The setting described above is shown in figure 1.\nWe will now examine the plasma equilibria corresponding to the statistical ensembles constructed in sections 2, 3, and 4 separately."

            "text": "Consider the positron-electron plasma equilibrium (9) arising from conservation of total magnetic moments Mp,Me. We shall refer to such equilibrium as a \u00b5 equilibrium. The condition for a \u00b5 equilibrium to hold is that the time scale of the electromagnetic fluctuations driving the system toward the relaxed state is longer than the time scale of cyclotron dynamics as described by equation (5). In practice, this means that the term q\u03a6 occurring within the Hamiltonians Hp, He evolves over long time scales compared to the cyclotron time scale. This ensures that the constancy of the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 is not broken.\nFor the system under consideration, the cyclotron frequency \u03c9c is\n\u03c9c = eB\nm \u2248 1010Hz, (54)\nwhere the typical value B \u223c 0.1T has been used. Denoting with \u03c9f = 2\u03c0/Tf the frequency of electromagnetic fluctuations, the condition (5) can therefore be written as\n\u03c9f << \u03c9c \u2248 1010Hz. (55)\nIt is worth observing that for a comparable trap such as the RT-1 device [25], the spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations is well below the 105Hz range. We therefore expect the condition (55) to be easily fulfilled by the system under examination. We shall therefore assume that (55) holds, and apply the equilibrium model developed in section 2.\nIn order to evaluate the densities (18), the Poisson equation (20) must be solved for the electrostatic potential \u03a6. The physical parameters Ap, Ae, Np, Ne, \u03b2p, \u03b2e, \u03b3p, and \u03b3e appearing on the right-hand side of equation (20) are determined as follows. First, the target temperature T for the positron-electron plasma is T \u2248 Tp \u2248 Te \u2248 10 eV , where Tp and Te denote the temperatures of positrons and electrons respectively. This fixes the inverse temperatures \u03b2\u22121p = kBTp and \u03b2 \u22121 e = kBTe, with kB the Boltzmann constant. The target spatial density n is n \u2248 np \u2248 ne \u2248 1011m\u22123 up to 1012m\u22123. Since the volume of the positron-electron plasma trap is of the order \u2126 \u2248 1m3, we consider a total particle number of the order N \u2248 Np \u2248 Ne \u2248 1011.\nNext, an estimate of the chemical potentials \u03b3p and \u03b3e can be obtained by observing that the changes in the total energies Ep, Ee caused by the addition of magnetic moments dMp, dMe to the system are given by \u03b2pdEp = \u03b3pdMp and \u03b2edEe = \u03b3edMe. The order of magnitude of \u03b3p, \u03b3e is therefore expected to be \u03b3p \u2248 \u03b2pHp/\u00b5 \u2248 \u03b2pB and \u03b3e \u2248 \u03b2eHe/\u00b5 \u2248 \u03b2eB. Finally, the parameters Ap, Ae, which represent measures of the volume \u03a0 occupied by the plasma in the phase space, can be estimated by observing that for a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution\nfB (x,p) = A exp\n{\n\u2212\u03b2 p 2\n2m\n}\n, (56)\none has\nA = 1\n\u222b\n\u03a0 exp\n{ \u2212\u03b2 p22m }\nd3xd3p =\n1\n\u2126\n(\n\u03b2\n2\u03c0m\n) 3 2\n. (57)\nWe therefore expect that Ap \u2248 \u2126\u22121 (\u03b2p/2\u03c0m)3/2 and Ae \u2248 \u2126\u22121 (\u03b2e/2\u03c0m)3/2. The last ingredient needed to numerically solve equation (20) is the value of the potential \u03a6 on the boundary \u2202\u2126. Note that the boundary \u2202\u2126 consists of the vessel boundary \u2202\u2126v and the coil surface \u2202\u2126c. At the vessel boundary \u2202\u2126v the electrostatic potential \u03a6 is grounded, i.e. \u03a6 = 0 on \u2202\u2126v. The coil generating the dipole magnetic field is levitated without mechanical contact through a secondary magnet located in the upper region of the trap. Therefore, the value \u03a6c of the electrostatic potential on the coil surface \u2202\u2126c is determined by the amount of charged particles that hit it. In particular, electrons penetrating the coil surface push \u03a6c toward negative values, while positrons tend to increase \u03a6c (note that even if positrons annihilate with electrons after reaching the coil surface, this results in a positive increase of the coil charge). An upper bound to \u03a6c can be obtained from the Poisson equation (1) through the scaling\n\u03a6 \u2248 enR 2\n\u01eb0 \u2248 103 V, (58)\nwhere R is the radial size of the device and the value n \u2248 1011 m\u22123 has been used. In practice \u03a6c is expected to be much smaller than (58) since the charge separation e (np \u2212 ne) will be sensibly smaller than the characteristic charge density en \u2248 10\u22128Cm\u22123 of each individual species. In summary, the boundary conditions that will be used to evaluate the Poisson equation (20) are\n\u03a6 = 0 on \u2202\u2126v, \u03a6 = \u03a6c on \u2202\u2126c, (59)\nwith |\u03a6c| < 103 V . Figure 2 shows the modification of spatial densities np, ne and electrostatic potential \u03a6 obtained from numerical solution of (20) when varying the coil potential \u03a6c while keeping the other physical parameters fixed. As one may expect, a negatively charged coil attracts the positron component while repelling electrons. The converse occurs for a positively charged coil. The other essential feature of figure 2 is the effect of the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 on the macroscopic equilibrium state of the system: both positrons and electrons tend to accumulate in regions of higher magnetic field strength. This feature combined with the dependence with respect to the coil potential implies that when \u03a6c > 0 positrons preferentially populate the interior region close to the center stack and enclosed by the coil, r < rbox, while electrons surround the coil surface (first row in figure 2). The opposite occurs when \u03a6c > 0 (third and fourth rows in figure 2). Inspection of (20) also suggests that if the thermodynamic parameters of the two species are equal, i.e. Ap = Ae, Np = Ne, \u03b2p = \u03b2e, and \u03b3p = \u03b3e, and \u03a6c = 0 on \u2202\u2126c, then \u03a6 vanishes throughout \u2126 while the spatial densities are identical, np = ne. This case is shown in the second row of figure 2.\nTaking the third row in figure 2 as reference case, figure 3 summarizes how spatial densities np, ne and electrostatic potential \u03a6 change when physical parameters are modified. While equilibrium profiles are not too sensitive to changes in the chemical potentials \u03b3p, \u03b3e and in the inverse temperatures \u03b2p, \u03b2e, abrupt changes occur when there is asymmetry in the number of protons and electrons. The bottom row of figure 3 shows the case Ne = 2 \u00b7 1011 >> Np = 109. Note that positrons are almost completely expelled from the interior region r < rbox and form a radiation belt like structure on the exterior side of the coil, while electrons are mostly found in proximity of the center stack located at r = r0."

            "text": "We now consider the case in which individual particles preserve the second adiabatic invariant J\u2016. For the bounce action to be constant, the time scale Tf of electromagnetic fluctuations must be longer than the period Tb of a bounce oscillation as described by equation (29). An estimate of the bounce frequency \u03c9b (and thus of Tb) can be obtained with the aid of equation (45), which rests on the hypothesis \u00b5B >> e |\u03a6|\nor \u03b2\u22121p , \u03b2 \u22121 e >> e |\u03a6|. Therefore, assuming these conditions to hold, the typical bounce frequency is\n\u03c9b = 2\n\u221a\n\u00b5B\u2032\u20320 m \u2248 2 \u221a \u03b2\u22121 R \u221a m \u2248 106 Hz. (60)\nHere, the values \u03b2\u22121 = kBT with T = 10 eV and the trap scale length R = 1m have been used. Hence, the condition (29) now reads \u03c9f << \u03c9b \u2248 106Hz. (61) Notice that since \u03c9b << \u03c9c (recall equation (55)) if the condition (61) is satisfied then the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 is also preserved. Again, experimental evidence from the RT-1 device suggests that the requirement (61) is usually fulfilled since \u03c9f < 10\n5Hz there [25]. In addition to the physical parameters Ap, Ae, Np, Ne, \u03b2p, \u03b2e, \u03b3p, and \u03b3e already encountered for the \u00b5 equilibrium, the \u00b5-J\u2016 equilibrium described by the Poisson equation (47) includes the temperature anisotropies \u03b10p and \u03b10e and the Lagrange multipliers \u03b6p and \u03b6e associated with conservation of the total bounce actions Jp and Je. In the following, we study a plasma with \u03b10p = \u03b10e = 1. Notice that if the plasma is isotropic \u03b10p = \u03b10e = 1/2 since perpendicular motion carries twice the degrees of freedom of parallel dynamics. Nevertheless, as long as \u03b10p and \u03b10e are constant, the spatial densities profiles remain unchanged, but they are only scaled by factors 1/ \u221a \u03b10p and 1/ \u221a \u03b10e respectively (recall equation (46)). We shall also consider the limiting case \u03b6p/\u03b2p\u03c9b << 1 and \u03b6e/\u03b2e\u03c9b << 1 to simplify the evaluation of the integrals on the right-hand side of (47). Then, the relevant Poisson equation is given by (50) where \u03b6p, \u03b6e do not appear explicitly. Notice that physically this implies that the total bounce actions Jp,Je are not preserved during the relaxation of the system. However, the effect of bounce dynamics is still felt by the ensemble through the term \u03c9bJ\u2016/2 appearing in the energies H\u0303p, H\u0303e and the bounce averaged phase space measure d\u03a0\u0303 of (40). Figure 4 shows \u00b5-J\u2016 equilibria obtained by numerical solution of the Poisson equation (50) for different values of the coil potential \u03a6c when the other physical parameters are kept constant. As in the case of \u00b5 equilibria, a charged coil tends to push the species with charge of the same sign in the internal region r < rbox while attracting the species with opposite charge. Next, observe that as in the previous case the conservation of the magnetic moment \u00b5 results in the tendency of particles to accumulate in regions of high magnetic field strength. However, there is a peculiar feature of \u00b5-J\u2016 equilibria : bounce dynamics squeezes spatial density profiles along the equatorial line z = 0. As a result, radiation belt like structures are formed on both sides of the coil. This behavior is a consequence of the term 1/ \u221a B0 appearing in the expression of the spatial densities np, ne (recall equation (48)), which is related to the characteristic bounce velocity vb given by\nvb = 2b\nTb =\n1 \u03c0 b\u03c9b =\n\u221a\n2\u03b1pB0\u00b5\nm , (62)\nwhere equations (44) and (45) were used. Since np, ne \u221d 1/ \u221a B0, and the characteristic bounce velocity\nvb \u221d \u221a B0 is higher in regions of stronger magnetic field strength B0 = B (r, 0), the spatial densities have a minimum in correspondence of the maximum of B0, which is located at the radial position of the current loop r = rl. Physically, the formation of radiation belt like structures can be understood as follows. Particles with a high characteristic bounce velocity are statistically less likely to occur, and the net result is balance between the tendency of particles to populate regions of high magnetic field strength B as a result of the first adiabatic invariant, and the depletion effect caused by the second adiabatic invariant at those radial positions where B0, and thus vb, are higher.\nThe dependence of spatial densities np, ne and electrostatic potential \u03a6 on the various physical parameters is shown in figure 5. Each row corresponds to a variation of one of the parameters used in the example plotted in the second row of figure 4."

In deriving (64) we used the fact that in a vacuum magnetic field the term \u2202\u2113 \u00d7\u2207B and the curvature \u22022\u2113 are related by \u2202\u2113 \u00d7 (\u2207\u00d7B) = \u2202\u2113 \u00d7 (\u2207B \u00d7 \u2202\u2113)\u2212B\u22022\u2113 = 0, which implies \u2202\u2113 \u00d7\u2207B = B\u2202\u2113 \u00d7 \u22022\u2113 . When the plasma temperature \u03b2\u22121 and the magnetic field curvature \u22022\u2113 are sufficiently small, the E\u00d7B drift velocity becomes the dominant contribution to vd.

Unfortunately, experimental evidence [25] suggests that the frequency of electromagnetic fluctuations within the trap will be comparable to (65), implying that the criterion for the existence of a third adiabatic invariant \u03a8,\n\u03c9f << \u03c9d, (66)\nwill not be satisfied. Nevertheless, it is instructive to explore how the presence of the third adiabatic invariant \u03a8 modifies the spatial density profiles and the electrostatic potential at equilibrium.\nFigure 6 shows the spatial densities np, ne and the electrostatic potential \u03a6 obtained by numerical solution of (52) for different values of the chemical potentials \u03b7p, \u03b7e associated with the third adiabatic invariant \u03a8. The effect of the preservation of total magnetic fluxes \u03a8p,\u03a8e is felt by the system only for large values of \u03b7p, \u03b7e, corresponding to large changes in energy \u03b2pdEp = \u03b7pd\u03a8p \u2248 10, \u03b2edEe = \u03b7ed\u03a8e \u2248 10 when magnetic fluxes d\u03a8p, d\u03a8e \u2248 R2B\u2217 \u2248 1m2T are added to the system. The spatial densities are initially flattened at the equator (compare the spatial densities of first and second rows in figure 6), eventually splitting into upper and lower lobes separated by the equatorial line z = 0 (compare the spatial densities of first and third rows in figure 6). Physically, this behavior can be understood as follows. The kinetic energy associated with toroidal drift motion can be written as\nK\u03d5 = 1\n2 mv2\u03d5 =\n1\n2mr2 (p\u03d5 \u2212 q\u03a8)2 . (67)\nThis term does not appear in the guiding center Hamiltonians (6) because it is usually smaller than the kinetic energies associated with parallel and cyclotron dynamics. In particular, this implies that p\u03d5 \u2248 q\u03a8, with p\u03d5 the canonical momentum of a charged particle in the \u03d5 direction and where we used the fact that in a dipole magnetic field the vector potential is A = \u03a8\u2207\u03d5. Since states with large deviations in the canonical momentum p\u03d5 \u2248 q\u03a8 would break the conservation of the total magnetic flux \u03a8tot, regions with large \u03a8 are penalized in the distribution functions through the factors e\u2212\u03b7p\u03a8 and e\u2212\u03b7e\u03a8. If the chemical potentials \u03b7p, \u03b7e are sufficiently large, this effect prevails on the tendency caused by the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 to concentrate particles in regions with strong magnetic field strength B, resulting in a preferential depletion of the equatorial region outside the coil (recall that along magnetic field lines, which correspond to level sets of \u03a8, the magnetic field strength increases when approaching the coil from the outside)."

This result can be recovered from (68) as follows. First, observe that a straight magnetic field can be expressed as B = \u2207\u03a8 \u00d7 \u2207\u03d5 with \u03a8 = Bzr2/2 + c\u03a8 and c\u03a8 \u2208 R.

(69)\nIn addition, the homogeneity of the magnetic field implies that bounce motion is absent, while the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5 does not affect the profile of the spatial density (recall equation (18)). The only relevant constraint is thus that given by the third adiabatic invariant \u03a8. Indeed, denoting with v = v\u2016+vE the velocity of a charged particle (other drifts are absent due to the homogeneity of the magnetic field) one has\nd\u03a8 dt = v \u00b7 \u2207\u03a8 = \u2212\u2202\u03a6 \u2202\u03d5 = 0, (70)\nwhere we used the fact that the electrostatic potential is expected to be axisymmetric, \u2202\u03a6/\u2202\u03d5 = 0. The conservation of the total magnetic flux \u03a8tot = N \u222b\n\u03a0 \u03a8f d\u03a0, with f the particle distribution function and N\nthe particle number, then leads to a spatial density distribution\nn = A exp {\u2212\u03b2q\u03a6\u2212 \u03b7\u03a8} , (71)\nwhere A is a positive real constant and \u03b7 a Lagrange multiplier associated with preservation of total magnetic flux. The Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential \u03a6 in an infinite vertically symmetric \u2202\u03a6/\u2202z = 0 plasma column now reads\n1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n(\nr \u2202\u03a6\n\u2202r\n)\n= \u2212qA \u01eb0 exp\n{\n\u2212\u03b2q\u03a6\u2212 1 2 \u03b7Bzr 2 \u2212 \u03b7c\u03a8 } . (72)\nThis equation admits the solution\n\u03a6 = \u2212\u03b7Bz 2\u03b2q r2 + c\u03a6 = \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b2q \u03a8+ \u03b7c\u03a8 \u03b2q + c\u03a6, (73)\nsuch that \u03a6 (0) = c\u03a6 \u2208 R and \u03a6\u2032 (0) = 0 with \u03a6\u2032 = \u2202\u03a6/\u2202r, while the constant c\u03a8 is determined by the equation\nexp {\u2212\u03b7c\u03a8} = 2\u03b7Bz\u01eb0 \u03b2q2A exp {\u03b2qc\u03a6} . (74)\nNotice that the corresponding spatial density is constant, n = A exp {\u2212\u03b2qc\u03a6 \u2212 \u03b7c\u03a8}. From (69) and (73) it therefore follows that the plasma rigidly rotates around the z-axis with velocity\nv\u03d5 = \u2212 \u03b7\n\u03b2q r. (75)\nThis result also implies that the frequency of the rotation is \u03c9z = \u2212\u03b7/\u03b2q, and that the magnetic field generated by the rotating plasma works to cancel the external magnetic field. Furthermore, the conservation of the total magnetic flux, which amounts to the conservation of the ensemble average of the squared radial position\nof charged particles, \u3008r2\u3009, provides radial confinement to a system with particles initially contained within a given radius. It is also worth noticing that this same confinement principle works even for a neutral plasma as long as the third adiabatic invariant holds. To see this, consider the simple case Ap = Ae = A, \u03b2p = \u03b2e = \u03b2 and \u03b7p = \u03b7e = \u03b7. Then, the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential admits the trivial solution \u03a6 = 0 such that np = ne \u221d exp {\u2212\u03b7\u03a8} = exp { \u2212\u03b7Bzr2 \u2212 \u03b7c\u03a8 }\n, which results in radial confinement of the plasma. Unfortunately, it is known that standard neutral plasmas are poorly confined by a straight magnetic field due to the inherent fragility of the third adiabatic invariant, which is rapidly destroyed by symmetry breaking electromagnetic perturbations, and the impossibility of containing the plasma at the vertical ends of the trap via electric fields [23, 42]. We remark that, however, we are not aware of positron-electron experiments in this context.\nIn a dipole magnetic field the situation is essentially different because the confining mechanism is provided by the first adiabatic invariant \u00b5, which forces particles in regions of high magnetic field strength, and not by the magnetic flux \u03a8 as in a straight magnetic field. As shown in section 2 this also implies that, in contrast with a straight magnetic field, a dipole magnetic field is suitable to trap both neutral and nonneutral plasmas. Notice also that the toroidal rotation velocity (68) now depends both on the electrostatic potential \u03a6 and the underlying magnetic field geometry through \u2207\u03a8, \u2207\u2113, and \u22022\u2113 . Figure (7) shows the toroidal rotation velocity obtained by numerical evaluation of (68) for the case reported in the second row of figure (4). Both the positron toroidal velocity v\u03d5p and the electron toroidal velocity v\u03d5e increase with r, but have opposite directions. This implies that, for the case considered, the charge dependent drift vk is dominant with respect to vE . Furthermore, there is a net toroidal current density J\u03d5 = e (npv\u03d5p \u2212 nev\u03d5e). Nevertheless, the resulting magnetic field B\u2032 is negligible with respect to the dipole magnetic field. Indeed,\nB\u2032 \u2248 \u00b50eRnv\u03d5 \u2248 10\u22129 T, (76)\nwhere \u00b50 is the vacuum permeability and the characteristic values R = 1m, n \u2248 1011m\u22123, and v\u03d5 \u2248 105 ms\u22121 were used."

            "text": "In this work, we studied the maximum entropy states of a collisionless positron-electron plasma trapped by a dipole magnetic field with the aim of elucidating the confinement properties of the system for different ranges of physical parameters. Such dipole magnetic field trap has several potential applications, including containment of pair and antimatter plasmas, experimental investigation of exotic and astrophysical plasmas, as well as technology development such as realization of coherent gamma ray lasers.\nIn a dipole magnetic field, the nature of plasma equilibria depends on the presence of adiabatic invariants. For such conserved quantities to hold, the time scale of electromagnetic fluctuations affecting the energy of a charged particle must be longer than the time scale of the periodic motion associated with each adiabatic invariant. Each adiabatic invariant constrains the maximum entropy state, resulting in a departure from standard Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics of an ideal gas.\nCompared to a plasma trap with a straight magnetic field (such as a Penning-Malmberg trap) where radial confinement is provided by the conservation of the fragile third adiabatic invariant (the canonical momentum p\u03d5 \u2248 q\u03a8), in a dipole magnetic field containment is realized through the first adiabatic invariant (the magnetic moment \u00b5), which results in a tendency of each charged species to move toward regions of high magnetic field strength B. For this reason, a dipole magnetic field is suitable to confine both neutral and nonneutral plasmas. The effect of the second adiabatic invariant (the bounce action J\u2016) is to squeeze the spatial densities of both positrons and electrons along the equatorial line, with the formation of characteristic radiation belt like structures around the coil.\nBy solving Poisson\u2019s equation for the electrostatic potential with the charge density obtained from the maximum entropy states as source term, we put the theoretical model to the test, and showed efficient confinement of both species for a wide range of physical parameters. The equilibrium profiles appear to be mostly sensible to asymmetries in the number densities of the two species, and to significant changes in the\ncoil potential. This latter fact suggests that the capability to control the coil potential would be a desirable property of any experimental dipole magnetic field trap design."
