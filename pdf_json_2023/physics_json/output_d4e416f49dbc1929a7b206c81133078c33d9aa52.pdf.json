Introduction\nBeer is one of the most widely consumed alcoholic beverages worldwide; water, malt, hops, and yeast are the four main ingredients used in the production of beer (1). Beer production comprises several stages, namely, mashing, boiling, fermentation, maturation and solid liquid separations (wort separation, wort clarification, and rough beer clarification) (2). In recent years, consumer preference has increasingly emphasized the flavor and nutritional qualities of beer, which has increased interest and demand for craft beers (3). The main differences between craft and mass-produced beer are a more concentrated raw wort, the addition of a greater variety and quantity of hops, or the addition of other auxiliary flavor/nutritional ingredients, such as fruits, tea and natural plant extracts. The flavor of beer is influenced by the ingredients, particularly by auxiliary ingredients, the yeast, the brewing process and the fermentation conditions (4\u20137).\nHops (Humulus lupulus L.) are an essential ingredient in beer manufacturing, providing the characteristic bitter taste and attractive aroma of the final beverage (8). The main volatile component of hops is its essential oil, 80% of which is composed of myrcene, \u03b1humulene, and \u03b2-caryophyllene (9), however, these volatiles contribute little to the beer aroma, because of their low water solubility and their tendency to oxidize and evaporate during heating and fermentation (10). Hops contain numerous bicyclic and tricyclic minor terpene hydrocarbons, the most important of which are the monoterpene alcohols, linalool and geraniol, as well as their isomers nerol and \u03b1-terpineol (11, 12), which impart floral, geranium-like, fresh, and citrus notes to beer (13), contribute to inhibiting beer spoilage bacteria, and improving taste and foam stability (11). There are three main ways of adding\nFrontiers inNutrition 01 frontiersin.org\nhops (i.e., kettle, late, or dry hopping), late hopping and dry hopping have become key tools for brewers to impart beer with an intense hoppy aroma (12, 13). Late hopped beers have more pronounced hoppy and herbal aromas than early hopped ones, and late hopping increases the content of linalool and geraniol (14\u201316); delaying the addition of hops increases the geraniol content of the finished beer while avoiding conversion of geraniol to \u03b2-citronellol by the yeast (17).\nCraft beer brewers often enrich the flavor of their beers by adding accessory ingredients, such as fruit, tea, and stevia to enhance consumer appeal. Addition of persimmon juice enhanced the antioxidant properties and consumer preference for the beer (18). The addition of white grape pomace increased the concentration ofmany volatile compounds in the beer, such as ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate, as well as increasing the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity (19). Addition of three types of tea (green, black, and oolong tea) increased the concentrations of tea volatile components, such as methyl salicylate, indole, and geraniol and its derivatives (20). Olive leaves have also been used in place of hops, to provide bitterness (21). Tea therefore has the potential to replace hops and provide the beer with a desirable, but unusual flavor.\nThe main objectives of this study were to enrich the flavor of beer by replacing hops with Jasmine tea extract (JTE) during late hopping and to investigate the effects of this on the quality of beer. This process modification has the potential to develop a novel application for tea and compensate for the scarcity of aromatic hops in China."

The wort was boiled for 110min with the addition of hops pellet (100 g, alfa-acid proportion: 13%) after 30min and jasmine tea extract (360 g) after 100min. The coarse break was separated through settling and the wort was cooled to about 40\u25e6C and transferred to the fermentation tank where the brewing yeast (150 g/L, activated for 30min in sterile water) was added. After 7 days of primary fermentation at 20\u25e6C, the yeast slurry is drained from the bottom of the fermenter, followed by a temperature adjustment to 4\u25e6C and a closed venting valve for post-fermentation and maturation for 60 days, promptly sampling, storage (\u221280\u25e6C) and analysis. The control samples were brewed in the same way except for the addition of different ingredients at the late hopping stage. For the control sample, 150 g (alfa-acid proportion: 13%) of hops were added after 100min of boiling."

A heat-map of the 75 key volatiles was plotted to visualize the differences between the beers (Figure 3B; red: content > mean, blue: content < mean) and a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed to analyze clustering in the flavor profiles. As can be seen from the Figure 3B, the content of most volatiles in JTB is higher than that in HOPB. Cluster analysis enables a good classification of the same type of beer into one category.\nFrontiers inNutrition 06 frontiersin.org"

The major contributors to the overall flavor of HOPB were linalool, ethyl 9-decenoate, 1-decanol, hexanoic acid ethyl ester and octanoic acid ethyl ester (ROAV 82.35, 76.23, 67.95, 32.19, and 21.12, respectively). The major contributors to the overall flavor of JTB were linalool, methyl anthranilate, 3-methyl-1-butyl acetate, 1- decanol, and hexanoic acid ethyl ester (ROAV 368.52, 73.85, 45.76, 44.77, and 43.61, respectively). Linalool, 1-decanol, and hexanoic acid ethyl ester were all relatively high in JTB and HOPB and contributed strongly to their aromas.\nMethyl anthranilate and ethyl 9-decenoate were the components with the second highest ROAV values in JTB and HOPB, respectively, and both these compounds differed markedly between the two beers. This appears to be related to the different ingredients; methyl anthranilate is a key aroma component of jasmine tea (42, 43), and ethyl 9-decenoate is a key aroma component of hops (44). Linalool is the main contributor to the overall flavor of both beers (largest ROAV) and is a key flavor component of late hopped beers and teas; it provides a floral flavor to beer (45). Hexanoic acid ethyl ester and 1-decanol are volatile compounds produced during fermentation, which can provide floral and fruity aromas, respectively (20, 46)."

The QC samples were closely grouped in the PCA scores plot, indicating that the metabolomic analysis was reliable (Figure 4A). The JTB and HOPB samples were both closely grouped, but the two beer type groups were well separated, i.e., LC-MS analysis\ncould clearly distinguish the two beer types. The criterion of PLSDA VIP value \u22651.2 (Figure 4B) was used to screen for compounds that significantly differed between the two beers, and identified 123 differential compounds (Figure 4B, purple).\nThe 123 compounds were initially identified on the basis of their exact molecular masses and fragmentation spectra. Thirtynine differential compounds were identified by comparing with the HMDB database (http://www.hmdb.ca/), laboratory standard libraries and previous reports (Table 4), namely, six bitter acids and derivatives, three amino acids, five phenolic acids, five organic acids, seven dimeric catechins, nine flavone/flavonol glycosides, and four others. Overall, JTE addition resulted in significant changes in metabolic profile.\nA heatmap was plotted to visualize the differential metabolites resulting from JTE addition (Figure 5). The content of phenolic acids, amino acids, dimeric catechins and flavone/flavonol glycosides in JTB was significantly higher than that in HOPB, whereas bitter acid and some organic acids were less abundant in JTB. These differences are consistent with the substitution of late hopping with the addition of JTE, as amino acids, dimeric catechins, flavone/flavonol glycosides and phenolic acids are abundant in tea, whereas bitter acids are only found in hops (47\u2013 50). Dimeric catechins, amino acids and flavone/flavonol glycosides from the JTE would give the beer a tea-like flavor, especially the theanine, which has an umami taste (51). The high content of isoalpha-acids is the main reason for the bitterness of beer (52), which is consistent with the sensory evaluation results (see below). HOPB had a higher bitterness intensity."

The aroma differences are consistent with the relative volatile profiles of the beers (section 3.2), i.e., JTB contained higher concentrations of linalool, \u03b1-terpineol and citronellol. The score for taste of JTB was 7.8, 32.5% higher than that of HOPB, whereas HOPB scored higher for bitterness. JTB had a richer, whiter and finer foam, with a score of 7.7, compared with 7.0 for HOPB. However, JTB scored lower for appearance than HOPB, because JTB was a little more turbid than HOPB. Overall, JTB had a higher organoleptic rating than HOPB. The taste of JTB was mellower, softer and with a pleasing tea flavor (Figure 6B). JTB had a higher aroma score than HOPB (p < 0.05), apparently because of the abundant floral and fresh fragrances released from JTE (54, 55). HOPB had a lower taste score and higher bitterness score than JTB, probably resulting from the late hopping of HOPB; late hopping enhances the bitterness of beer (56). The study of Oladokun et al. (57) showed a significant effect of polyphenol content on the perceived intensity and characteristics of bitterness, with higher polyphenol content resulting in stronger bitterness and poorer bitterness characteristics expression in beer. It is noteworthy that although the beer with tea extract added in this study had higher polyphenol content, the bitterness intensity of JTB did not become stronger."

Similarly, addition of fresh fruits during beer fermentation significantly enriched the content of phenolic compounds and increased the antioxidant capacity of the beer (60). Increased antioxidant capacity improves the storage stability of beer (36)."

(A) Sensory evaluation of beer flavor. (B) Rating evaluation of flavor intensity of beer characteristics.\nthan that of HOPB and JTB had higher antioxidant capacity and polyphenol content.\nThe flavor volatiles in JTB and HOPB were distinctive; HOPB contained more abundant floral and fresh aroma compounds (e.g., nerol and methyl salicylate), whereas JTB contained more abundant green/grassy aroma compounds (e.g., hexanal). The differential compounds that distinguished the two beers were dimeric catechins, flavone/flavonol glycosides, and bitter acids and derivatives, which account for differences in sensory attributes and antioxidant capacity.\nThe overall sensory acceptability of JTB was higher than that of HOPB; JTB had a pleasant floral and fresh-scent aroma and softer taste, with a pleasant tea\nflavor and a taste. JTB had higher DPPH, ABTS and FRAP antioxidant capacities, which should result in better storage stability.\nJTB has a stronger inhibitory effect on \u03b1-amylase activity than HOPB and is better able to regulate blood sugar levels. The consumption of this type of beermay therefore have a slowing effect on obesity.\nOverall, adding jasmine tea extract instead of hops improved the overall sensory acceptability, foam stability and antioxidant capacity of the beer, as well as conferring a unique taste and flavor. This process modification has the potential to develop a novel application for tea in craft beer and compensate for the scarcity of aromatic hops in China.\nFrontiers inNutrition 11 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 8 \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitory e ects by the two beers. \u201ca, b, c, and I, II\u201d Di erent letters in the same indexes indicate significant di erences between mean values (p < 0.05).\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Zhejiang Gongshang University Human Ethics Committee.
