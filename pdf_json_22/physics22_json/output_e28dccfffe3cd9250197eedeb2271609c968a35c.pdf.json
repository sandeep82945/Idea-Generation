Hyperchaos appears with a sudden expansion of the attractor of the system at a critical parameter for each case and it coincides with triggering of occasional and recurrent large-intensity pulses. The transition to hyperchaos from a periodic orbit via Pomeau-Manneville intermittency shows hysteresis at the critical point, while no hysteresis is recorded during the other two processes. The recurrent large-intensity pulses show characteristic features of extremes by their height larger than a threshold and probability of rare occurrence. The phenomenon is robust to weak noise although the critical parameter of transition to hyperchaos shifts with noise strength. This phenomenon appears as common in many low dimensional systems as reported earlier1, there the emergent large-intensity events or extreme events dynamics have been recognized simply as chaotic in nature although the temporal dynamics shows occasional large deviations from the original chaotic state in many examples. We need a new metric, in the future, that would be able to classify such significantly different dynamics and distinguish from chaos.\nA Zeeman laser model has been investigated here, which shows a variety of instabilities that are usu-\nally found in other systems. However, we report the origin of extremely large-intensity pulses via quasiperiodic breakdown to chaos, quasiperiodic\nintermittency, Pomeau-Manneville intermittency, and their intrinsic relation with the hyperchaotic\ndynamics. Intriguingly, the transition to largeintensity pulses and the hyperchaotic dynamics\nappear concurrently, which is confirmed by the existence of two positive Lyapunov exponents in\nthe system. Distinct transitions to large-intensity pulses in the Zeeman laser model are robust with\nweak noise.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nHaken2 first reported chaos in Maxwell-Bloch equations similar to what was found in the atmospheric circulation model proposed by Lorenz3. This encourages the optical community to explore various intriguing nonlinear phenomena including chaos in deterministic and stochastic laser systems4\u20139. Chaos is characterized by directional exponential stretching of the trajectory of a nonlinear dynamical system, which is detected by one positive Lyapunov exponent10 of the system. Existence of two positive Lyapunov exponents was first identified in a four-dimensional system by Ro\u0308ssler11 and defined as hyperchaos. Hyperchaos was later observed in a variety of systems, electronic circuits12\u201314,\na)kingston.cnld@gmail.com\ncoupled oscillators15\u201317, finance systems18, radiophysical generator19, interacting gas bubbles in a liquid20, and two element nonlinear chimney model21. It has also been reported in lasers22\u201325. Control of hyperchaos was implemented in experiments using occasional proportional feedback in multimode Nd:YAG laser24. Synchronization of hyperchaotic systems was investigated in semiconductor lasers22.\nIn recent time, another class of complex dynamics such as the rare extremely large-intensity events (LIE) has been investigated in laser systems, CO2 lasers\n26, semiconductor laser27,28 and microcavity laser29. In particular, studies on rouge waves in lasers30\u201333 made important inroads in extreme events\u2019 research1,34. Extreme events have characteristic features more complex than the classical chaotic motion in their dynamical as well as statistical properties. Localized dynamical instabilities1,34, namely, interior-crisisinduced intermittency35? \u201337, Pomeau-Manneville (PM) intermittency35,38\u201340, torus breakdown of quasiperiodic motion34,41, and quasiperiodic intermittency41, are involved in the triggering of extreme events in a wide variety of nonlinear systems. Noise-induced attractor hopping in multistable system33, and instability of in-phase42 and antiphase synchronization40,43 in coupled systems can also originate extreme events. In the process, rare and recurrent large amplitude events show up in dynamical systems, in general, when the trajectory of the system leaves its bounded phase space, on rare occasions, to travel far away distance, but returns to the original location after a while. The short-lived occasional journey to far away location have been triggered by the local instabilities in phase space of the system and originate large amplitude events that are called as extremes when they are larger than a threshold height and rare in occurrence.\nExtreme events26 and hyperchaos23 have been studied\n2 in lasers, separately, in search of complexity of dynamics, however, any link between the two phenomena has been unnoticed. Indeed, they represent two sides of the same coin that we reveal here in our numerical study of the seven-dimensional Zeeman laser model44,45. In particular, we consider this laser model, for our study, because it shows three different sources of instabilities that lead to recurrent and rare large-intensity pulses as reported earlier41. There it was shown that rare large-intensity events appear at two different critical parameters in the Zeeman laser model mainly via two nonlinear processes, quasiperiodic breakdown to chaos followed by interior crisis, and quasiperiodic intermittency. In addition, we report here triggering of LIE via PM intermittency in the laser model as found in our recent search for other sources of instabilities that may exist in the broad parameter space of the system. The typical PM intermittency46 is found at another critical parameter when the turbulent phase (chaotic bursting) occasionally intercepts the laminar phase (almost periodic state). In the turbulent phase, the height of the chaotic bursts may be larger than a threshold height. All the three sources of nonlinear instabilities trigger a discontinuous large expansion of the attractor as manifested in the bifurcation diagrams of the system at discrete critical parameters along with the emergence of hyperchaos. In reality, the expansion of the attractor is not permanent, but intermittent when the trajectory of the system occasionally visits far away location of state space of the system originating short-lived LIE, which are recurrent and rare in occurrence.\nHyperchaos was observed earlier23 in a free-running laser diode with a variety of possible statistical distribution of light-polarized dynamics. Very recently, hyperchaos is reported in semiconductor superlattice47 that is smaller in size and equally fast compared to optical devices. It was clearly shown there that a sudden transition to large amplitude oscillation occurs at a critical parameter via PM intermittency. The temporal dynamics shows intermittent large amplitude events, however, the specific characteristic features of the temporal dynamics was not discussed there. We present here two more sources of instabilities, besides the PM intermittency, that originate hyperchaos with concurrent appearance of LIE in the Zeeman laser. Interestingly, we observe a common scenario for all the three sources of instabilities (quasiperiodic breakdown to chaos followed by crisis, PM intermittency and quasiperiodic intermittency) that lead to a discontinuous large expansion of the attractor of the system at discretely different critical parameters with the origin of hyperchaos and rare LIE. In fact, such processes of simultaneous origin of hyperchaos and LIE are common as reported earlier48 in other paradigmatic models.\nIn many low dimensional models, including lasers, a sudden large expansion of the attractor of the system was shown with the origin of extreme events. However, such extreme events were recognized as simple chaos although they were more complex in nature. It has not\nbeen explored so far, to the best of our knowledge, how complex really they are in comparison to chaos? Possibly, we need a different metric to classify them from simple chaos. For higher dimensional systems, it becomes easier to classify extreme events as hyperchaotic. To prove the statement, we consider the 7-dimensional Zeeman that shows three varieties of dynamical mechanisms leading to extreme events denoted here as LIE. The sources of instabilities are first located in parameter space of the laser model and then the origin of hyperchaos is identified in response to a change in a system parameter. The Lyapunov exponents of the system are estimated using a perturbation method41,49 to identify the emergence of hyperchaos. We draw bifurcation diagrams of the system to locate the critical parameter point of large expansion of the attractor and the appearance of LIE and then confirm the statistical properties of extreme heights and rare occurrence. We have also checked whether the discontinuous transition to hyperchaos against the parameter is hysteresis free or not by doing forward and backward integration. This phenomenon of the origin of hyperchaos with a discontinuous expansion of the attractor at a critical parameter and the emergence of rare LIE is robust to weak noise, although the critical parameter for transition to hyperchaos shifts against the noise strength. We like to mention that this article is presented here in recognition of the fundamental contributions made by Prof. Ju\u0308rgen Kurths in the field of nonlinear dynamics, synchronization of chaos and dynamical networks including climate networks, geophysical sciences, and as a tribute to commemorate his 70th birthday which falls in March 2023."

Intermittent large size chaotic bursts intercept the quasiperiodic motion in response to changes in the pumping parameter. It is similar, in some sense, yet different from the PM intermittency, since it originates from quasiperiodic motion instead of a periodic motion. We provide evidence here that quasiperi-\n5 odic intermittency also leads to hyperchaos when LIE starts appearing in the time evolution of laser intensity I. The bifurcation diagrams of Imax and \u03bb1,2 are plotted along the solid black line in Fig. 1(a), which are demonstrated in Fig. 4. The bifurcation of Imax in Fig. 4(a) reveals quasiperiodic motion for r < 45.5956 when two largest Lyapunov exponents (\u03bb1,2) are zero as shown in Fig. 4(b). For increasing r values, the system reveals a sudden large expansion in Imax at a critical r \u2248 45.5956 when \u03bb1,2 becomes both positive simultaneously from zero. Figures 4(a)-(b) are drawn for both forward and backward integrations against r as marked by two different colors showing no shift in the transition point.

The time evolution of laser intensity (I) and the phase portrait of E2x against E 2 y at the origin of LIE or the hyperchaotic state (r = 45.5956) are plotted in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b).\nThe time evolution shows longer laminar phases of low intensity quasiperiodic motion (not discussed in detail) occasionally intercepted by large-intensity pulses (turbulent phase). The phase portrait shows occasional journey of the trajectory far away from the dense region. The large-intensity spikes are much larger that the hs line (horizontal red dashed line). The probability distribution function (PDF) plot of all the intensity pulses in a long time series of I during hyperchaos shows a heavy-tail thereby confirming rare appearance of LIE in Fig. 5(c).

Three bifurcation diagrams are placed on top of each other using different colors for different strength of noise, D = 0.0 (gray dots), D = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 (cyan circles), and D = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 (magenta squares), respectively. The critical point of transition to hyperchaos clearly shifts with noise strength, however, the characteristic feature of the discontinuous transition with a large expansion of the attractor still persists. We do not present the temporal dynamics, however, the PDF of (In = Imax) for different noise strength is depicted in Fig. 8(b). Different r values are chosen for the plot since the transition point shifts with noise strength. The statistics of non-Gaussian distribution with a tail remains unchanged (cyan and magenta) when compared with the distribution (D = 0.0, gray color) in absence of noise. A little shift in the values of PDF is only reflected for increasing noise. This confirms rare occurrences of LIE that continues to appear even in the presence of noise.\nWe observe a similar noise effect during the quasiperiodic intermittency. The bifurcation diagram for Imax against the pumping parameter r \u2208 (45.5925, 45.5995) is portrayed in Fig. 9(a). A clear view of the shift in the transition point is obtained against noise strength. PDF of (Imax) for different noise strength are shown in Fig. 9(b), where it shifts to lower values (cyan and magenta colors) from the noise-free condition (gray color). The heavy-tail characteristics of the distribution of Imax remains.\nDuring the PM intermittency route to hyperchaos, the bifurcation diagrams are shown in Fig. 10(a) as plotted for D = 0.0 (gray), D = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 (cyan), and\n7 20 40 60 80 10 -7 10 -5 10 -3 10 -1\nFIG. 9.

Once again, it confirms that the critical parameter point shifts in response to the noise strength. PDF of (Imax) shows a shift to higher probabilities under the influence of noise as illustrated in Fig. 10(b), however, the basic character of the distribution remains unchanged and confirms rare occurrences of LIE."

            "text": "We have explored the Zeeman laser model and found three sources of instabilities, breakdown of quasiperiodicity to chaos followed by interior crisis, quasiperiodic intermittency, and PM intermittency. The prescribed instabilities originate extreme events at discrete critical parameters in the laser model, for all three cases, in response to a change in the pumping parameter. We have now recognized the dynamic nature of extreme events denoted here as LIEs as hyperchaotic. Hyperchaos has been recognized by estimating the Lyapunov exponents of the system when two of them become positive. The temporal\ndynamics of hyperchaos in all three cases show LIE with characteristic features of extreme events, in the sense, that intermittent large events are larger than a threshold height and they appear on rare occasions, which has been confirmed by the non-Gaussian distribution with a tail (light or heavy) of all the intensity pulses. On the other hand, the IEI distribution manifest a Poisson-like process. A common scenario of a discontinuous large expansion of the attractor of the laser model is noted during the appearance of hyperchaos for all the three cases. The transition to hyperchaos and the appearance of LIE are concurrent and discontinuous for all the three cases, and hysteresis-free except in the case of PM intermittency when the transition shows a shift in the critical point with forward and backward integrations. We have noticed a shift in the transition points to hyperchaos against the parameter shifts in the presence of weak noise for all the three cases, however, the fundamental feature of a discontinuous large expansion of the attractor with the origin of LIE remains unchanged. Extreme events-like LIE added more complexity in the dynamics of the laser model than typical chaos by occasionally deviating from it and producing recurrent largeintensity events and are now identified as hyperchaotic. Besides the laser model, this phenomenon of the origin of hyperchaos and LIE is common as usually found48 in other paradigmatic models. This observation raises a question about the true dynamical character of extreme events as observed in low dimensional systems. Extreme events, in general, in dynamical systems, low or high dimensional, are more complex than simple chaos. We need a new metric to define the complexity of extreme events in any model systems."
