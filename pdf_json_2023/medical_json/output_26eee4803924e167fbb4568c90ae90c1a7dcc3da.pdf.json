            "text": "Functional dyspepsia (FD) is among the most common gastrointestinal disorders that affect more than 20% of the population [1]. According to Rome IV criteria, FD is defined as any combination of the following four specific symptoms: postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning symptoms with plenty of interference with the patient\u2019s normal activities and occurring with a frequency of at least three days per week over three months, with an onset of at least six months previously [1].\nThe prevalence of FD varies worldwide, with a higher occurrence in Western countries (10-40%) [2]. According to a recent study, the percentages of FD symptoms were as follows: postprandial fullness (80%), epigastric distention (80%), early satiety (60-70%), epigastric discomfort and burning (60-70%), nausea (60- 40%), and vomiting (80%) [3]. FD is an intermittent condition. According to population surveys, 15% to 20% of individuals experience chronic symptoms over an extended period of time, whereas 50% achieve full symptom relief. There is no evidence linking it to a lower survival rate. Patients with FD have a low quality of life and incur high social and medical expenses. This is in part because conventional FD treatments, which focus mostly on symptom alleviation, are ineffectual [2,4].\nThe etiology of FD is likely multifactorial; however, the exact cause is not clear. Numerous risk factors can be associated with FD [1]; for instance, enteric infections, being overweight, smoking, antibiotic use, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and psychological dysfunction are some of the risk factors. It is\nHow to cite this article Aregawi L, Shokrolahi M, Gebremeskel T, et al. (September 27, 2023) The Effect of Ginger Supplementation on the Improvement of Dyspeptic Symptoms in Patients With Functional Dyspepsia. Cureus 15(9): e46061. DOI 10.7759/cureus.46061\ndifficult to manage/treat FD because the primary approach is based on symptom control [5]. Overall, 40% of FD patients worldwide seek medical attention for medication due to severe discomfort and negative consequences on daily activities and productivity [6]. Unfortunately, conventional medications are ineffective in treating FD, and up to 50% of patients turn to alternative therapies such as herbal remedies [7]. As the impact of FD on people\u2019s lives is too great to ignore, it is imperative that scientists investigate and develop new improvements for this condition. Over the previous years, there has been a significant increase in the usage of natural or alternative treatments [8].\nGinger constituents for the management of functional dyspepsia symptoms Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is one of the most consumed herbs and is used both as a spice and dietary supplement worldwide. It has also been used in traditional medicine for its benefit. Chinese and Indians have been using it as a traditional medicine for many years to treat gastrointestinal issues such as indigestion, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, and fever [9]. Studies have indicated that ginger contains a wide variety of chemical constituents of volatile and non-volatile compounds. Some of the stated biological effects are monoterpenes (limonene, citral) and phenolics (gingerols, 6-shogaol, 6-paradol, and zingerone). Limonene, a component of the oil, is used in anticancer and gastroesophageal reflux relief [10], as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and gastroprotective agents [11]. The rhizomes are the most important part, and zingerone, paradols, and shogaols render pungency to ginger [12,13].\nGinger has gained acceptance for its potential to treat various aspects of gastrointestinal symptoms, with in vitro and animal data supporting the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic, and hypotensive effects [14,15]. Numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of ginger in treating and improving FD symptoms [16-18]. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study reported that ginger reduced symptoms of dyspepsia, including epigastric discomfort, compared to placebo. The study involved 70 participants with FD who were randomized to receive either ginger or a placebo for 28 days. The ginger group experienced a significant reduction in symptoms compared to the placebo group [18]. Another study compared the effects of ginger and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on dyspepsia symptoms in patients with FD. The study included 60 patients who were randomized to receive either ginger or a PPI for four weeks. Both treatments were effective in reducing symptoms of dyspepsia, including epigastric discomfort, with no significant difference between the two groups [19]. A report from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that ginger was more effective than a placebo in reducing symptoms of dyspepsia, including epigastric discomfort. The review included 12 studies involving 1,278 participants [20].\nGinger has also been studied for its effects as an anti-emetic agent on other digestive complaints, including nausea and vomiting [21-27]. A meta-analysis of RCTs found that ginger was effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in various clinical settings, including postoperative nausea and vomiting, chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting, and pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting [22]. One randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study involving 80 naval cadets found that ginger significantly reduced the severity of motion sickness compared to placebo. The cadets received either ginger or a placebo for four days and were exposed to a motion sickness simulator. The ginger group experienced a significant reduction in the severity of motion sickness compared to the placebo group [23]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs on the use of ginger for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting found that ginger was more effective than a placebo in reducing the severity of nausea and vomiting [24]. Even though ginger was found to be effective in most studies in preventing nausea, some clinical studies have been found contradictory [28,29]. It has been indicated that ginger shows no beneficial effects in reducing acute or delayed nausea and vomiting when combined with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists [29].\nSeveral studies have investigated the benefits of ginger supplementation on FD symptoms of bloating and cramps. An RCT published in 2015 found that ginger supplementation significantly reduced FD symptoms, such as upper abdominal cramps and bloating, compared to a placebo. Another randomized controlled trial published in 2016 found that ginger supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in FD symptoms compared to a placebo [30]. A systematic review of six RCTs published in 2018 found that ginger supplementation showed a statistically significant reduction in FD symptoms compared to a placebo. The pooled mean difference in symptom scores was -1.26 (95% CI = -1.89 to -0.62). A metaanalysis of five RCTs published in 2020 found that ginger supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in FD symptoms compared to a placebo. The pooled standard mean difference in symptom scores was -0.65 (95% CI = -1.19 to -0.11). Another human study showed that eating ginger improves digestion by helping the stomach empty faster [31], and a study published in the Journal of Digestive Diseases found that ginger was effective in reducing symptoms of dyspepsia, including stomach pain and bloating [32]. On the other hand, studies have reported that the use of ginger supplementation can affect the improvement of FD [14,18]. The ginger dosage, form, and duration of supplementation were different between studies which might affect the results, and it is also unclear whether ginger is effective for all types of dyspepsia or if it is more effective for certain subtypes. Therefore, further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and understand the ideal amount, form, and duration of ginger supplementation for FD symptoms. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effect of ginger supplementation on the improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in patients with FD.\n2023 Aregawi et al. Cureus 15(9): e46061.

            "text": "The results from this study indicated that ginger supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in most FD symptoms. Postprandial fullness (p = 0.033, 95% CI = 0.01-0.26), early satiety (p = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.10-0.37), epigastric pain (p = 0.000, 95% CI = 0.16-0.42), epigastric burning (p = 0.003, 95% CI = 0.10-0.45, and heartburn (p = 0.209, 95% CI = -0.04-0.20) showed highly statistically significant findings while for heartburn smaller decreases were seen in comparison to baseline (Table 3), which was consistent with previously conducted studies [34,35]. A randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study found that ginger supplementation reduced symptoms of dyspepsia, such as belching, bloating, and fullness [34]. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in the European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hematology found that ginger supplementation reduced symptoms of FD, including postprandial fullness and early satiation [35]. According to a study done on FD patients, eating 1.2 g of ginger powder significantly enhanced antral contractions and stomach emptying compared to taking a placebo [18]. Ginger may accelerate gastrointestinal peristalsis and shorten the time it takes for food to move through the digestive tract via modulating intestinal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) receptors [36,37].\nFD symptoms Baseline 28 days of ginger supplementation P-value (95% CI)\nPostprandial fullness 0.70 (0.46) 0.57 (0.05) 0.033* (0.01-0.26)\nEarly satiety 0.78 (0.42) 0.55 (0.50) 0.001* (0.10-0.37)\nEpigastric pain 0.67 (0.48) 0.37 (0.49) 0.000* (0.16-0.42)\nEpigastric burning 0.59 (0.50) 0.31 (0.47) 0.003* (0.10-0.45)\nNausea 0.86 (0.35) 0.49 (0.50) 0.000* (0.21-0.53)\nHeartburn 0.65 (0.48) 0.57 (0.50) 0.209 (-0.04-0.20)\n* = statistically significant evidences (p < 0.05).\nAs the causes of FD are multifaceted [6], various pathophysiological mechanisms may account for the etiology of FD, such as impaired meal-induced relaxation of the proximal stomach, visceral hypersensitivity to distension, gastric motor abnormalities, and disturbed central nervous function [38]. This multifactorial and poorly defined pathogenesis has hampered efforts to develop effective treatments in most FD cases [39], and its optimal clinical management remains a subject of considerable debate [40]. The typical method for\n2023 Aregawi et al. Cureus 15(9): e46061. DOI 10.7759/cureus.46061 5 of 8\ntreating patients with suspected FD considers a test-and-try approach to reduce symptoms as a potential starting strategy. The first possibilities in such a strategy are PPIs and/or prokinetics [41,42]. Motivated FD sufferers may take into account herbal remedies as alternatives. Recently, a number of supplements with a focus on ginger extracts have been suggested to physicians and gastrointestinal experts. The nutritional supplement industry offers these extracts in specific quantities made from herbal or spice ingredients [43].\nMost animal studies have shown that ginger root extract increases gastric ulceration and gastrointestinal transit [44], which may contribute to our results. Ginger has been suggested to promote gastric emptying and improve gastrointestinal motility [45]. A clinical study showed the effects of ginger on indigestion in 12 healthy volunteers. The study found that ginger significantly accelerated gastric emptying compared to a placebo [46]. In another study, 24 patients with FD were randomized to receive either ginger or a placebo for 14 days. The study found that ginger significantly improved gastric emptying compared to a placebo [19]. However, a study involving 14 healthy adults found no significant effect of ginger on gastric emptying. The study used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design and found that ginger did not significantly affect gastric emptying than a placebo [47].\nIn this study, we observed an association between ginger supplementation and nausea. Vomiting, nausea, and hypomotility involve a transient dysfunction of the complex integrated web of cholinergic M3 and serotonergic 5-HT3/HT4 receptors. The main constituents of ginger root extracts such as gingerol-6, 8, 10, and 6-school have been reported in many experimental models to modulate these receptors. On the other hand, 5-HT4 receptors, which also play a role in gastroduodenal motility, do not seem to be involved in the effects of these compounds [23,48]. This discrepancy may stem from variations in supplementation amount, form, and duration between studies, which could have an impact on findings. Overall, the data indicate that ginger supplementation may be effective in improving dyspepsia symptoms. However, more well-designed studies are needed to approve these findings and determine the appropriate dosage and duration of supplementation."
