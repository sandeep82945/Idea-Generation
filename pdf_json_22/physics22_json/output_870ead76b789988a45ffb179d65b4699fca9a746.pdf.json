    "abstractText": "Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics and in particular superstring and superbrane theories predict the existence of axion-like particles (ALPs). ALPs are very elusive, extremely light and interact primarily with photons. In the presence of an external magnetic field two effects show up: (i) photon-ALP oscillations and (ii) a change of the photon polarization state. The astrophysical context represents the best opportunity to get indirect evidence for the ALP existence thanks to various effects that the photon-ALP interaction produces in the sky. Great attention has been paid so far to photon-ALP oscillations, since they modify the transparency of the crossed media at very high energies and so the final spectra of faraway sources exhibit a flux excess and a characteristic oscillatory behavior. Two hints at the ALP existence have hitherto been discovered. But less interest has been attracted by the modification of the photon polarization. In this paper we address it in the X-ray and in the high energy (HE) bands. Specifically, we analyze the photon degree of linear polarization and the polarization angle induced by the photon-ALP interaction for photons generated in the central region of two galaxy clusters: Perseus and Coma. We find a substantial departure from conventional physics in both considered bands. We conclude that the ALP-induced polarization effects are more likely detectable with the proposed missions like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO in the HE range. Still, possible ALPinduced effects on photon polarization could also be detected by IXPE (already operative) and by the proposed eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP and XPP in the X-ray band.",

ALPs are very elusive, extremely light and interact primarily with photons. In the presence of an external magnetic field two effects show up: (i) photon-ALP oscillations and (ii) a change of the photon polarization state. The astrophysical context represents the best opportunity to get indirect evidence for the ALP existence thanks to various effects that the photon-ALP interaction produces in the sky. Great attention has been paid so far to photon-ALP oscillations, since they modify the transparency of the crossed media at very high energies and so the final spectra of faraway sources exhibit a flux excess and a characteristic oscillatory behavior. Two hints at the ALP existence have hitherto been discovered. But less interest has been attracted by the modification of the photon polarization. In this paper we address it in the X-ray and in the high energy (HE) bands. Specifically, we analyze the photon degree of linear polarization and the polarization angle induced by the photon-ALP interaction for photons generated in the central region of two galaxy clusters: Perseus and Coma. We find a substantial departure from conventional physics in both considered bands. We conclude that the ALP-induced polarization effects are more likely detectable with the proposed missions like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO in the HE range. Still, possible ALPinduced effects on photon polarization could also be detected by IXPE (already operative) and by the proposed eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP and XPP in the X-ray band.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAstroparticle physics is nowadays a very exciting and promising research field. Just to quote two keyachievements, think of the detection of the right neutrinos flux from the Sun [1] and more recently the discovery of very-high-energy (VHE) neutrinos from blazars (a class of active galactic nuclei, AGN) [2].\nMore specifically, axion-like particles (ALPs, see e.g. [3, 4]) are nowadays in the limelight since they are a generic prediction of many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics including superstring and su-\n\u2217Electronic address: gam.galanti@gmail.com \u2020Electronic address: marcoroncadelli@gmail.com \u2021Electronic address: fabrizio.tavecchio@inaf.it \u00a7Electronic address: enrico.costa@inaf.it\nperbrane theories [5\u201314]. Besides, they are among the best candidates for the dark matter [15\u201320]. Actually, ALPs are very similar to the axion \u2013 the pseudo-Goldsone boson arising from the breakdown of the global PecceiQuinn symmetry U(1)PQ \u2013 proposed to solve the strong CP problem (for a review, see [21\u201324]). But while axion mass and two-photon coupling are tightly related and axions couple to fermions and gluons, the ALP mass ma and the ALP two-photon coupling ga\u03b3\u03b3 are independent parameters, and other possible ALP interactions are subdominant. In the presence of an external magnetic field two effects arise (for a review, see [25\u201327]).\n(i) Photon-ALP oscillations [28, 29] \u2013 which are analogous to the oscillations of massive neutrinos of different flavors.\n(ii) The change of the polarization state of a photon beam [28, 29].\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n12 28\n6v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nE ]\n1 7\nM ay\n2 02\n3\n2 Effect (i) has in turn two main implications. One consists of an enhanced photon transparency of the sky at VHE, say above 100\u22121000 GeV (see [30, 31]). The other amounts to an oscillatory behavior in the observed spectra of VHE blazars [32\u201337]. Very remarkably, two hints at the existence of an ALP have been found. The first one is that ALPs naturally explain why flat spectrum radio quasars (a class of blazars) can emit photons with energies up to 400 GeV as observed \u2013 without invoking ad hoc solutions \u2013 while conventional physics prevents any photon emission above 30 GeV [38]. The second is that ALPs solve the anomalous redshift-dependence of the spectra of BL Lacs (another class of blazars) [39]. The gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A detected at 18 TeV by LHAASO [40] or even at 251 TeV by Carpet-2 [41] would represent a firm indication for the ALP existence with the properties employed in the previous two hints [42].\nEffect (ii) has been already studied but with less interest: ALP-induced implications for the polarization of photons from gamma-ray bursts have been analyzed in [43] and the polarization of photons produced in the central region of a galaxy cluster or in the blazar jet in the presence of ALPs has been considered in [44]. PhotonALP conversion effects on photon polarization from other astrophysical sources have been addressed in [45\u201350]. In addition, photon-ALP interaction has recently been discovered as a means to measure emitted photon polarization [51]. All these studies are quite instrumental to find new hints at the ALP existence and they are timely, since new observatories measuring photon polarization have been launched or proposed in the X-ray band like IXPE [52], eXTP [53], XL-Calibur [54], NGXP [55] and XPP [56], and in the high-energy (HE) band such as COSI [57], e-ASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60].\nIn this paper we compute the photon survival probability in the presence of ALPs P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 , the related degree of linear polarization \u03a0L and the polarization angle \u03c7 of a photon-ALP beam produced in the central region of two iconic galaxy clusters: Perseus and Coma. We follow the analysis developed in [44]. We use parameters within physically consistent bounds concerning both the astrophysical context and the photon-ALP system. Moreover, we investigate the propagation of the photon-ALP beam in all the crossed regions (galaxy cluster, extragalactic space, Milky Way) by using the state-of-the-art knowledge. In the considered scenarios ALPs manifestly induce photon polarization effects that are expected to be detectable by current and planned satellite missions [52\u2013 60]. We conclude that the HE range is the most promising window to search for ALP-induced polarization effects in galaxy clusters, but we cannot exclude the X-ray band.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we recall the main properties of ALPs and of the photon-ALP system, stressing polarization effects. In Sec. III we review the main properties of the astrophysical environments crossed by the photon-ALP beam, in Sec. IV we present our results about the Perseus and Coma clusters, while\nin Sec. V we draw our conclusions."

While many limits on the photon-ALP coupling ga\u03b3\u03b3 and ALP mass ma are present in the literature [61\u2013 72], the only firm bound is represented by ga\u03b3\u03b3 < 0.66\u00d7 10\u221210 GeV\u22121 for ma < 0.02 eV at the 2\u03c3 level from no detection of ALPs from the Sun by CAST [61].\nIn the VHE range we should consider also the Heisenberg-Euler-Weisskopf (HEW) effective Lagrangian\nLHEW = 2\u03b12\n45m4e\n[( E2 \u2212B2 )2 + 7 (E \u00b7B)2 ] , (2)\nwhich takes into account the photon one-loop vacuum polarization effects with \u03b1 and me denoting the fine-structure constant and the electron mass, respectively [73\u201375]. However, the effects of LHEW turn out to be totally irrelevant in the X-ray and HE band for the systems we are dealing with [35, 76]. The same conclusion remains true concerning the photon dispersion on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [77] (see also [35, 76]).\nWe consider in the following a photon-ALP beam (E in Eq. (1) pertains to a propagating photon) of energy E, propagating from a galaxy cluster towards us along the ydirection and crossing several magnetized media (galaxy cluster, extragalactic space, Milky Way, see Sec. III for more details). Note that the presence of an external magnetic field is crucial in order for photon-ALP oscillations to take place so as to compensate the spin mismatch between photons and ALPs. Photon-ALP oscillations can show up since the propagation eigenstates differ from the interaction eigenstates for the off-diagonality of the mass matrix of the \u03b3 \u2212 a system. Because of the structure of the interaction term in LALP, only the transverse component of B and denoted by BT couples to a.\nBy successfully employing the short-wavelength approximation [29] \u2013 since we have E ma \u2013 the propagation equation along the y-direction of a non-polarized photon-ALP beam arising from LALP reads\ni d\u03c1(y)\ndy = \u03c1(y)M\u2020(E, y)\u2212M(E, y) \u03c1(y) , (3)\nwhere M(E, y) is the mixing matrix of the photon-ALP system and accounts for the photon-ALP interaction\n3 strength, the ALP and effective photon mass, the magnetization and absorption properties of the crossed medium (for more details see [76]). In Eq. (3) \u03c1(y) represents the polarization density matrix of the photon-ALP system, which reads\n\u03c1(y) =  Ax(y)Az(y) a(y) \u2297 ( Ax(y) Az(y) a(y) )\u2217 , (4) where Ax(y) and Az(y) are the photon linear polarization amplitudes along the x and z axis, respectively and a(y) is the ALP amplitude. The solutions of Eq. (3) can be expressed in terms of the transfer matrix of the photonALP system U ( E; y, y0 ) as\n\u03c1(y) = U ( E; y, y0 ) \u03c10 U\u2020 ( E; y, y0 ) , (5)\nwhere \u03c10 is the density matrix at position y0. Now, the probability that a photon-ALP beam initially in the state \u03c10 at position y0 will be found at position y in the state \u03c1 reads\nP\u03c10\u2192\u03c1(E, y) = Tr [ \u03c1U(E; y, y0) \u03c10 U\u2020(E; y, y0) ] , (6)\nwith Tr \u03c10 = Tr \u03c1 = 1 [31]. Equation (4) can be specialized to describe pure photon states in the x and z direction as\n\u03c1x =  1 0 00 0 0 0 0 0  , \u03c1z =  0 0 00 1 0 0 0 0  , (7) respectively, and the ALP state as\n\u03c1a =  0 0 00 0 0 0 0 1  , (8) while unpolarized photons are represented by\n\u03c1unpol = 1\n2  1 0 00 1 0 0 0 0  . (9) Partially polarized photons can be described by a polarization density matrix with an intermediate functional expression between Eqs. (7) and Eq. (9).\nWe can now write down the photonic part of the polarization density matrix in Eq. (4) in terms of the Stokes parameters as [78]\n\u03c1\u03b3 = 1\n2\n( I +Q U \u2212 iV U + iV I \u2212Q ) , (10)\nwhile the definition of the photon degree of linear polarization \u03a0L and of the polarization angle \u03c7 read [79]\n\u03a0L \u2261 (Q2 + U2)1/2\nI , (11)\n\u03c7 \u2261 1 2 atan\n( U\nQ\n) , (12)\nwhich in terms of the photon polarizaton density matrix elements \u03c1ij with i, j = 1, 2 can be expressed as\n\u03a0L =\n[ (\u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122)2 + (\u03c112 + \u03c121)2 ]1/2 \u03c111 + \u03c122 , (13)\nand\n\u03c7 = 1\n2 atan ( \u03c112 + \u03c121 \u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122 ) , (14)\nrespectively. In the absence of photon absorption, there exists a strict relationship between the emitted photon degree of linear polarization \u03a0L,0 and the photon survival probability P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 as the theorems stated and demonstrated in [51] show. For the specific physical cases in question, since \u03a0L,0 = 0 (more about this in Sec. III), the theorems in [51] ensure that P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 \u2265 1/2, as the following figures show."

Clusters can be divided into three main classes: (i) regular clusters, (ii) intermediate clusters, and (iii) irregular clusters. Many properties are associated with the class to which the cluster belongs, such as shape, symmetry, concentration, density profile, galactic content [80]. We will concentrate in this paper on regular clusters since their approximate spherical symmetry and density profile provide us the possibility to model them in a rather accurate way. In particular, we are concerned with the strength and morphology of the cluster magnetic field Bclu, which is linked to the cluster electron number density nclue . And a precise modeling of Bclu is crucial in order to estimate\n4 in an accurate fashion the photon-ALP conversion in the cluster.\nIt is nowadays well established from Faraday rotation measurements and synchrotron radio emission that Bclu = O(1 \u2212 10)\u00b5G [81, 82] and that it possesses an isotropic Gaussian turbulent nature with a Kolmogorovtype turbulence power spectrum M(k) \u221d kq, with k as the wave number in the range [kL, kH ] and index q = \u221211/3 [83]. The lower and upper limits of the latter interval kL = 2\u03c0/\u039bmax and kH = 2\u03c0/\u039bmin are the minimal and maximal turbulence scales, respectively. Thus, the behavior of Bclu is modeled as [83, 84]\nBclu(y) = B ( Bclu0 , k, q, y )(nclue (y) nclue,0 )\u03b7clu , (15)\nwhere B is the spectral function describing the Kolmogorov-type turbulence of the cluster magnetic field (for more details, see e.g. [85]), Bclu0 and n clu e,0 are the central cluster magnetic field strength and the central electron number density, respectively, while \u03b7clu is a cluster parameter.\nConcerning the profile of nclue , various models exist in the literature, such as the single \u03b2 model, the double \u03b2 model or a modified version of them [86]. Usually, the single \u03b2 model is used to describe non-cool-core (nCC) clusters, while the double \u03b2 model fits better cool-core (CC) clusters. However, this distinction is not sharp and the single \u03b2 model is often employed for both CC and nCC clusters [86]. Yet, we do not need to choose a theoretical model in the following as we will consider two specific clusters \u2013 Perseus and Coma \u2013 for which specific models exist in the literature. We describe the employed models of nclue for Perseus and Coma in the dedicated subsections of Sec. IV below.\nPhotons are produced in the cluster central region via different processes, such as thermal Bremsstrahlung showing up in the X-ray band [87], and likely synchrotron radiation in the cluster turbulent magnetic field of electrons produced by the cascade of VHE photons, inverse Compton scattering and neutral pion decay generated in several ways in the HE band (see e.g. [88\u201391]). In all these cases the emitted photons are effectively unpolarized [92, 93] \u2013 in the case of synchrotron radiation because of the turbulent nature of Bclu (see also note [94]). We shall keep in mind that, while cluster emission in the Xray band is corroborated by many observations, photon production in the HE range is less solid from an observational point of view for the lack of substantial detection.\nBy studying the propagation of the photon-ALP beam starting from the cluster central region out to its virial radius we compute the transfer matrix Uclu of the photonALP system in the cluster."

The shape of Bext is modeled by means of a domain-like structure: in each domain of size Lextdom which is equal to the magnetic field coherence length, Bext possesses a constant strength and the same orientation, which changes randomly and discontinuously from one domain to the next [101, 102]. Concerning the strength and coherence of Bext, quite high values are predicted by outflows from primeval galaxies with Bext = O(1) nG for Lextdom = O(1) Mpc [103\u2013106]. Thus, we take Bext = 1 nG and Lextdom randomly varying with a power-law distribution function \u221d (Lextdom)\u22121.2 in the range (0.2 \u2212 10) Mpc and with \u3008Lextdom\u3009 = 2 Mpc.\nWe want to stress that the simple above-described domain-like model is not always appropriate to describe Bext: when the oscillation length losc of the photon-ALP beam turns out to be smaller than Lextdom, the system becomes sensitive to the Bext substructure, so that the standard discontinuous model produces unphysical results. Therefore, we employ a new model developed in [76] that preserves the features of the domain-like model but continuously connects the Bext components crossing the boundary between any two adjacent domains. As a consequence, the photon-ALP beam propagation can still be analytically computed, leading to physically consistent results despite an increase of computational complexity (for more details see [76]).\nBy means of the procedure developed in [35, 76], we can calculate the transfer matrix of the photon-ALP system in the extragalactic space Uext."

The regular component of BMW with strength of O(1)\u00b5G is responsible for the dominant effect on the photonALP beam propagation. Instead, the effect produced by the turbulent part is negligible, since the photon-ALP beam oscillation length is much larger than the coherence length of the turbulent component of BMW.\nYet, we accurately model both the regular and the turbulent part of BMW by employing the model by Jansson and Farrar [108\u2013110], which includes a disk and a\n5 halo component, both parallel to the Galactic plane, and poloidal \u2018X-shaped\u2019 component at the galactic center. In the literature there exists also the BMW model of Pshirkov et al. [111], but it fails to accurately account for the Galactic halo component. Therefore, since we have checked that our results are not qualitatively modified by employing the model by Pshirkov et al.

III (galaxy cluster, extragalactic space and Milky Way). We address two real cases, namely the photons produced in the central region of the Perseus and Coma clusters.\nFor the parameters of the photon-ALP system we take ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121 and two values for the ALP mass: (i) ma . 10\u221214 eV, (ii) ma = 10\u221210 eV. The ALP mass term is smaller than the plasma frequency for ma . 10\u221214 eV, while the opposite is true in the case ma = 10\u221210 eV.\nBesides P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 , \u03a0L and \u03c7, we compute the probability density function f\u03a0 associated with \u03a0L when many realizations of the photon-ALP beam propagation are considered. We deal with photons produced at redshift z\nwith energy E and observed energy E0 = E/(1 + z) in the two ranges: (i) UV-X-ray band (10\u22123 keV\u2212102 keV), (ii) HE band (10\u22121 MeV \u2212 104 MeV).\nIn order to see whether the ALP-induced features of \u03a0L and \u03c7 can be detected by real observatories, we have binned our final results with the appropriate energy resolution derived by current instrument capabilities (more about this below). But then it is mandatory to investigate whether or not the ALP-induced features are washed out by the binning procedure. Therefore, we bin our theoretical results about the Stokes parameters by computing the mean \u00b5 and the variance \u03c3 of our energy points by assuming the realistic energy resolution of current observatories. In particular, we perform the following procedure: once the energy bin width is selected based on the instrument capabilities, we simply collect all the theoretical data within the bin and we directly calculate both \u00b5 and \u03c3 without any weighting for the heuristic nature of our calculation. This procedure is performed for each bin. We next evaluate the error bars for the derived quantities \u03a0L and \u03c7 by following the standard theory of the propagation of uncertainty (see [112] for a very detailed analysis about the realistic variance of the Stokes parameters).\nActually, since in the X-ray band the polarization measurements are more involved than the spectral ones, the energy resolution ought to be worsened by a factor of 4\u2212 5. By considering the energy resolution of spectrummeasuring observatories in the X-ray band (see e.g. the energy resolution of SWIFT [113]), we expect that the energy resolution for polarization studies should likely be of 15\u221220 bins per decade in the X-ray band. Instead, in the HE range a similar resolution for spectral and polarimetric measurements is expected since they derive from the same data. By considering the energy resolution of future HE observatories [58\u201360], we conservatively assume a lower resolution of 8 \u2212 10 bins per decade. In the following, a signal of \u03a0L > 0 is assumed as detectable if the 1\u03c3 lower bounds of the data points are above zero (see also [114]). Note that also \u03a0L = 0 represents a detection, namely of unpolarized photons."

            "text": "Perseus is a beautiful example of CC rich regular cluster. It is located at redshift z = 0.01756 and represents the brightest cluster in the X-ray sky. We describe the Perseus electron number density nclue with the model [115]\nnclue (y) = n clu e,01\n( 1 + y2\nr2core,1\n)\u2212 32\u03b2clu,1 +\nnclue,02\n( 1 + y2\nr2core,2\n)\u2212 32\u03b2clu,2 , (18)\n6\n7\nwhere nclue,01 = 3.9\u00d7 10\u22122 cm\u22123, rcore,1 = 80 kpc, \u03b2clu,1 = 1.2, nclue,02 = 4.05 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm\u22123, rcore,2 = 280 kpc and \u03b2clu,2 = 0.58.\nAs far as the Perseus magnetic field Bclu is concerned, we use Eq. (15) with Bclu0 = 16\u00b5G. This choice represents an average value between that derived in [116] of (2 \u2212 13)\u00b5G and the maximal estimate of 25\u00b5G as reported in [117]. The stochastic properties of the Perseus magnetic field are taken from the study of the Coma cluster [83]. This assumption is justified since the two clusters possess similar stochastic properties. Thus, we consider q = \u221211/3, \u039bmin = 2 kpc and \u039bmax = 34 kpc [83]. Finally, we take the average value \u03b7clu = 0.5 entering Eq. (15). As discussed in Sec. III.A, photons emitted in the central region of a galaxy cluster (see also note [118]) are unpolarized both in the X-ray and in the HE band: thus, we accordingly assume an initial degree of linear polarization \u03a0L,0 = 0.\nWe start with the case ma . 10\u221214 eV. Our results in the UV-X-ray band (10\u22123 keV \u2212 102 keV) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. We plot P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 in the top panel of Fig. 1 and the corresponding final \u03a0L and \u03c7 in the central and lower panel of Fig. 1, respectively. From Fig. 1 we see that the photon-ALP interaction starts to become efficient for E0 & 10\u22122 keV, where P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 6= 1 and the corresponding \u03a0L begins to increase showing that \u03a0L > 0. We note that P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 and the corresponding \u03a0L show an energy oscillatory behavior because the photon-ALP system is in the weak-mixing regime, as a consequence of the non-negligible plasma term (see also [76]). As already noted in [44] for an analogous physical system, the weakmixing regime extends for almost four energy decades (10\u22122 keV \u2212 102 keV) because of the high variation of Bclu and nclue as expressed by Eqs. (15) and Eq. (18), respectively, in addition to the properties of the other crossed media. The behavior of \u03c7 confirms an high energy dependence of the system for E0 . 102 keV. While a detection of \u03a0L > 0 appears as prohibitive for E0 . 1 keV, as the binned data in Fig. 1 show, we expect not only to be able to detect a possible signal of \u03a0L > 0 for E0 & 2 keV but also to measure its energy dependence with observatories such as IXPE [52], eXTP [53], XLCalibur [54], and especially NGXP [55] and XPP [56] at the highest energies.\nIn Fig. 1 we have exhibited a particular realization of the photon-ALP beam propagation process, which depends on the particular choice of the orientation and coherence length of Bclu and Bext. The exact behavior of the latter quantities is unknown but only their statistical properties are known: thus, the propagation of the photon-ALP beam becomes a stochastic process. Therefore, by computing several realizations of the photonALP beam propagation, we can infer its statistical properties. While only one realization can be experienced by the photon-ALP beam at once and thus it represents the only physical possibility, the study of several realizations gives us information on the robustness of our results, as we vary the magnetic properties of the media within rea-\n8 sonable limits. Therefore, in Fig. 2 we show the probability density function f\u03a0 for the final \u03a0L of all realizations. We consider two benchmark energies E0 = 1 keV and E0 = 10 keV. Because the final value \u03a0L = 0 is never the most probable result in Fig. 2, we conclude that our previous discussion about a possible detection of \u03a0L > 0 is robust.\nIn the HE band (10\u22121 MeV\u2212 104 MeV) we proceed by following the same strategy described above. In Fig. 3 we show P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 \u2013 and the corresponding \u03a0L and \u03c7 \u2013 for a specific realization of the photon-ALP beam propagation process, while we exhibit the statistical properties of the system in Fig. 4 by plotting f\u03a0. From Fig. 3 we see that the photon-ALP system is in the strong-mixing regime for almost all the HE range, which means that the plasma term and the mass term are now negligible with respect to the photon-ALP mixing term (see also [76]). The binned data in Fig. 3 show that the stability of the \u03a0L value with respect to the energy in the HE range makes its detectability easier than in the X-ray band with observatories such as COSI [57], e-ASTROGAM [58, 59] and Amego [60]. From Fig. 4 we conclude that for the two benchmark energies E0 = 300 keV and E0 = 3 MeV the final value \u03a0L = 0 is never the most probable value. In particular, the case E0 = 3 MeV shows that the most probable value for \u03a0L in the strong-mixing regime is \u03a0L & 0.8, which confirms the robustness of the previous discussion.\nWe now move to the case ma = 10 \u221210 eV. In the Xray band the ALP mass term strongly dominates over the mixing term, so that photon-ALP conversion is totally inefficient and negligible. As a result P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 and the corresponding \u03a0L are not modified by the photon-ALP interaction in the present situation.\nInstead, in the HE range the photon-ALP system turns out to be in the weak-mixing regime for ma = 10\n\u221210 eV, and the situation is totally similar to the previous case ma . 10\u221214 eV in the X-ray band. Accordingly, we note from Fig. 5 that the photon-ALP conversion is efficient for E0 & 300 keV and \u03a0L increases from the initial value \u03a0L,0 = 0. Both P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 and \u03a0L show an energy oscillatory behavior in almost all the considered range. As discussed in [44], the extremely wide energy range, where the system is in the weak-mixing is due to the large variability of the properties of the media wherein the photon-ALP beam propagates (galaxy cluster, extragalactic space, Milky Way). The strong energy dependence is confirmed by the behavior of \u03c7. The binned data in Fig. 5 suggest that we can expect a detectability of the above features for E0 & 3 MeV with observatories like COSI [57], e-ASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60].\nFigure 6 confirms that the best energy range where to search for ALP-induced effects on \u03a0L is E0 & 3 MeV. For lower energies f\u03a0 shows that the most probable value for \u03a0L is \u03a0L . 0.2, while at E0 = 3 MeV it reads \u03a0L \u223c 0.3."

            "text": "Coma is a nCC rich regular cluster, located at a redshift z = 0.0234. It is a source of strong X-ray emission. We describe the Coma electron number density nclue with the model [119]\nnclue (y) = n clu e,0\n( 1 + y2\nr2core\n)\u2212 32\u03b2clu , (19)\nwhere nclue,0 = 3.44 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm\u22123, rcore = 291 kpc and \u03b2clu = 0.75. Regarding the Coma magnetic field, we employ the model derived in [83]. Correspondingly, we take the best fit values Bclu0 = 4.7\u00b5G and \u03b7clu = 0.5 entering Eq. (15). Concerning the stochastic properties of Bclu, we take q = \u221211/3, \u039bmin = 2 kpc and \u039bmax = 34 kpc following [83].\nAs argued in Sec. III.A, photons in the central region of a galaxy cluster are expected to be emitted unpolarized both in the X-ray and in the HE band. For this reason, we take an initial degree of linear polarization \u03a0L,0 = 0.\nWhat we have discussed for the Perseus cluster in the X-ray and in the HE band \u2013 and in the cases ma . 10\u221214 eV and ma = 10\n\u221210 eV \u2013 is not very different from what happens for the Coma cluster. This is the reason why we prefer to highlight the few differences in the results for the two clusters instead of discussing Coma separately.\nWe start with the case ma . 10\u221214 eV. For a particular realization of the photon-ALP beam propagation in the UV-X-ray band (10\u22123 keV \u2212 102 keV), we report P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 , \u03a0L and \u03c7 in Fig. 7, while the probability density function f\u03a0 associated with \u03a0L for several realizations is reported in Fig. 8. Note that Fig. 7 and Fig. 1 are qualitatively similar: the photon-ALP beam produced in the central region of the Coma cluster is in the weak-mixing regime in the energy range (10\u22122\u2212102) keV for the same reasons explained for Perseus, while photon-ALP conversion is negligible for E0 . 10\u22122 keV. At higher energies, we find that \u03a0L increases from the initial value \u03a0L,0 = 0 and shows an energy oscillatory behavior, as expected from the Perseus case. A firm detectability of \u03a0L > 0 is expected for E0 & 2 keV and also its energy dependence seems observable with IXPE [52], eXTP [53], XL-Calibur [54], and especially with NGXP [55] and XPP [56] at the highest energies.\nFigure 8 shows that for lower energies (see the upper panel where E0 = 1 keV) the most probable value of \u03a0L is \u03a0L \u223c 0.3, while at higher energies (see the lower panel where E0 = 10 keV) the most probable result turns out to be \u03a0L < 0.2. The latter fact differentiates Coma from Perseus. Thus, for Coma the best energies to search for signals of \u03a0L > 0 appear to be in the range 2 keV . E0 . 10 keV. The reason behind the different behavior of the two clusters lies in the different strength of Bclu0 . In particular, the behavior of f\u03a0 is similar at lower energies (1 keV, see upper panels of Figs. 2 and 8), since the photon-ALP beam propagates well inside the\n9\n10\nweak mixing regime (see also Figs. 1 and 7, respectively) and the energy dependence allows to \u03a0L to assume a wide range of values. Instead, with the photon-ALP system approaching to the strong mixing regime at higher energies (10 keV, see lower panels of Figs. 2 and 8), the higher strength of Bclu0 for Perseus produces a larger modification in the final values of \u03a0L, while for Coma the final \u03a0L generally settles down to lower values because of the smaller Bclu0 (see also Figs. 1 and 7, respectively).\nFrom Fig. 9 we find that the photon-ALP beam coming from Coma propagates in the strong-mixing regime in the HE band (10\u22121 MeV \u2212 104 MeV), as it happens for Perseus. The stability of the binned data concerning the \u03a0L value \u2013 as the energy increases \u2013 suggests that observatories like COSI [57], e-ASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60] may detect this signal.\nHowever, f\u03a0 in Fig. 10 shows that in the strong-mixing regime the most probable value for \u03a0L is \u03a0L . 0.4, so that even if a signal is surely detectable the configuration of Bclu and Bext should be favorable in order to produce \u03a0L sensibly larger than zero. The reason for the different behavior of f\u03a0 concerning Perseus and Coma (see Figs. 4 and 10, respectively) is the same expressed for the X-ray band: in the strong mixing regime the higher strength of Bclu0 of Perseus is more efficient in producing a larger modification to the final \u03a0L than in the case of Coma.\nWe now turn our attention to the case ma = 10 \u221210 eV. What we have discussed for Perseus in the X-ray band retains its validity for Coma: ALP effects are negligible. Hence, P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 and the corresponding \u03a0L are unchanged.\nIn the HE range the behavior of Coma is similar to that of Perseus. In particular, Fig. 11 shows that the photon-ALP interaction starts to be efficient for E0 & 300 keV and the photon-ALP beam propagates in the weak-mixing regime in almost all the energy range under consideration for the same reasons discussed for Perseus. As a consequence, P\u03b3\u2192\u03b3 and the corresponding \u03a0L show an energy oscillatory behavior. From the binned data in Fig. 11 we expect that observatories like COSI [57], e-ASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO can detect ALP features for E0 & 3 MeV. Again, we find the same conclusions derived for Perseus.\nThe analysis of f\u03a0 in Fig. 12 demonstrates that E0 & 3 MeV is the best energy range where to search for ALP effects on photon polarization, since the most probable value for \u03a0L at E0 = 3 MeV is around 0.3, while for lower energies (see the case E0 = 300 keV in the upper panel of Fig. 12) the most probable value for \u03a0L is smaller than 0.2. The latter findings are still in agreement with the results derived for the Perseus cluster. At lower energies (300 keV, see upper panels of Figs. 6 and 12) the photonALP conversion is quite inefficient for both Perseus and Coma (see also Figs. 5 and 11, respectively) producing in either case a small modification in the values of the final \u03a0L. But at higher energies (3 MeV, see lower panels of Figs. 6 and 12) the photon-ALP beam propagates more efficiently inside the weak mixing regime for both Perseus and Coma (see also Figs. 5 and 11, respectively), so that\n11\nthe final \u03a0L gets effectively more modified for both the clusters."

            "heading": "C. Polarization detectability",
            "text": "Both the Perseus and Coma clusters represent very promising targets for polarization studies both in the Xray and in the HE band as far as the detectability of the features produced by the photon-ALP interaction is concerned. These effects are primarily produced by photonALP interaction inside the cluster, while its contribution in the other crossed regions is less important. In particular, although a rather high extragalactic magnetic field strength Bext = 1 nG producing an effective photonALP conversion is the most probable scenario (see Sec. III.B), we have checked that an inefficient photon-ALP conversion in the extragalactic space \u2013 arising by taking Bext < 10\n\u221215 G \u2013 does not substantially affect our previous results. We find only a slight and negligible dimming of the broadening of f\u03a0 in all the previous figures. At low energies, where the photon-ALP system lies in the weak-mixing regime, the ALP-induced oscillations of \u03a0L and \u03c7 with respect to the energy are very quick, as shown by Fig. 1 for Perseus and by Fig. 7 for Coma especially in the (0.1 \u2212 1) keV decade. Since within a single bin we expect many oscillations with respect to the energy in the latter situation, the high dispersion in the values assumed by \u03a0L and \u03c7 provokes a larger error bar in the binned data at lower energies. The latter effect decreases as the energy increases until it becomes negligible in the strong-mixing regime, as shown by Fig. 3 for Perseus and by Fig. 9 for Coma.\nAs already mentioned in Sec. II, the only firm constraint about the ALP parameter space derives from the CAST experiment [61]. However, new bounds about the photon-ALP system parameters (ma, ga\u03b3\u03b3) have recently appeared in the literature and suggest us a preference for a specific model [68\u201371]. In particular, the case [ma . 10\u221214 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5\u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121] is disfavored by [68\u201371] with respect to the other considered in this paper [ma = 10\n\u221210 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121], which is within all current bounds. Therefore, while we cannot exclude the case [ma . 10\u221214 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121], we consider the case [ma = 10\u221210 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121] as more probable. In addition, note that the case [ma = 10 \u221210 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121] is compatible with the two hints at ALP existence [38, 39] and with the explanation of the GRB 221009A detection at 18 TeV by LHAASO and at 251 TeV by Carpet-2 [42]. As a result, since the case [ma = 10\n\u221210 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121] produces polarization effects in the HE range but not in the X-ray band, we conclude that the best observatories that can detect ALP-induced polarization effects in galaxy clusters are COSI [57], e-ASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60]. Still, we cannot exclude a detection in the X-ray band similar to what we have reported in the\nfigures above. Obviously, many other possibilities remain to be explored. An ALP with a mass ma = 2\u00d7 10\u221212 eV and the same coupling ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5\u00d710\u221211 GeV\u22121 \u2013 which is within the above-mentioned bounds [68\u201371] \u2013 would exhibit an intermediate behavior between the two situations considered above, namely ma . 10\u221214 eV and ma = 10\n\u221210 eV. In particular, both the region where photon-ALP conversion is efficient and the strong-mixing regime would start at higher energies with respect to the case [ma . 10\u221214 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121] and lower with respect to the case [ma = 10 \u221210 eV, ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5\u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121]."

            "text": "In this paper, we have investigated the effects of the photon-ALP interaction on both the final degree of linear polarization \u03a0L and the polarization angle \u03c7 of photons produced in the central region of two regular clusters. We have chosen Perseus and Coma, and we have addressed both the X-ray and the HE bands. In either case, photons are expected to be emitted as unpolarized (\u03a0L,0 = 0). Our findings are consistent with those obtained in [44] for generic galaxy clusters. We have employed the state-ofthe-art knowledge about the astrophysical media (galaxy cluster, extragalactic space, Milky Way) crossed by the photon-ALP beam. We have considered ALP parameters within the firm bound derived by CAST [61], we have taken ga\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV\u22121 and the two values for the ALP mass: (i) ma . 10\u221214 eV, (ii) ma = 10\u221210 eV. We have found features in the final \u03a0L induced by the photon-ALP interaction and we have performed a first estimate of their detectability with observatories like IXPE [52], eXTP [53], XL-Calibur [54], NGXP [55] and XPP [56] in the X-ray band, and COSI [57], eASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60] in the HE band. We have also investigated the probability density function f\u03a0 of \u03a0L associated with many realizations of the photon-ALP beam propagation process. Our conclusions can be summarized as follows.\n(i) In the X-ray band only the case ma . 10\u221214 eV produces observable effects on \u03a0L. Instead, for ma = 10\n\u221210 eV the ALP mass effect is so large that photon-ALP conversion is totally negligible and gives rise to no features on the final \u03a0L. Results for Perseus and Coma are qualitatively similar. In the case ma . 10\u221214 eV the photon-ALP beam propagates in the weak-mixing regime so that the final \u03a0L shows an energy-dependent behavior. From an estimate of the energy resolution of observatories like IXPE [52], eXTP [53], XL-Calibur [54], NGXP [55] and XPP [56], we expect that an ALPinduced signal about \u03a0L > 0 can be detected for E0 & 2 keV. The analysis of f\u03a0 \u2013 associated with many realizations of the photon-ALP beam propagation \u2013 shows that we can expect a more probable\n12\nsignal of \u03a0L > 0 for E0 around 10 keV for Perseus rather than for Coma. Instead, for both clusters \u03a0L > 0 is the most likely result at lower energies. Thus, the detection of a possible signal of \u03a0L > 0 appears as rather robust.\n(ii) In the HE range both the case ma . 10\u221214 eV and ma = 10\n\u221210 eV lead to an efficient photon-ALP conversion and features in \u03a0L. Also in the HE range the behavior of Perseus and Coma are similar. In the case ma . 10\u221214 eV the photon-ALP beam propagates in the strong-mixing regime and the behavior of \u03a0L turns out to be energy independent. For this reason, a signal with \u03a0L > 0 can very well be observed by detectors like COSI [57], eASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60]. The probability of getting a signal with \u03a0L > 0 is greater for Perseus than for Coma, as shown by the study of f\u03a0. In the case ma = 10\n\u221210 eV the qualitative behaviors of Perseus and Coma are almost identical. The photon-ALP beam propagates in the weak-mixing regime and \u03a0L shows an energy oscillatory behavior. The analysis of both the binned data about \u03a0L and of f\u03a0 suggests that the range E0 & 3 MeV represents the best energy region where to expect the highest probability of measuring a signal with \u03a0L > 0 from observatories such as COSI [57], eASTROGAM [58, 59] and AMEGO [60].\nAs discussed above, we cannot exclude a detection of ALP-induced polarization effects in the X-ray band since the only firm bound on ALP parameters is that from CAST [61], but we believe the HE band to be the best window to search for these effects.\nIn conclusion, both Perseus and Coma represent good targets for the study of ALP-induced effects on \u03a0L with some preference for Perseus. Instead, for a detailed study\nof the behavior of \u03a0L as the energy varies, Coma appears as a slightly better candidate.\nDifferent physically consistent models concerning the behavior of Bclu and nclue do not produce a strong modification of our final results, as already noted in [44]. A higher impact would be produced by a large modification of the strength of Bclu0 and of the central value of n clu e , but these quantities are reasonably quite well known for both Perseus and Coma.\nSince the ALP-induced polarization effects considered in the present paper can only increase the initial degree of linear polarization \u03a0L,0 = 0, the same features cannot instead be produced by Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), since the LIV trend is to reduce \u03a0L [120].\nALPs with the properties investigated in this paper can also be detected by the new generation of VHE gammaray observatories like CTA [121], HAWC [122], GAMMA400 [123], LHAASO [124], TAIGA-HiSCORE [125] and HERD [126]. In addition, these ALPs can be directly detected by laboratory experiments like the upgrade of ALPS II at DESY [127], the planned IAXO [128, 129] and STAX [130], and with the techniques developed by Avignone and collaborators [131\u2013133]. Moreover, if ALPs turn out to constitute of the bulk of the dark matter, then they can be detected also by the planned ABRACADABRA experiment [134]."

[94] As already discussed in [44], an initial \u03a0L,0 slightly bigger than zero in the HE band (\u03a0L,0 = 0 however represents the most probable situation) does not substantially change the final results especially in the cases where the photon-ALP interaction produces strong polarization effects, which can be observed. This is the reason why we consider the most probable case \u03a0L,0 = 0\n14\nonly. [95] A. Franceschini and G. Rodighiero, Astron. Astrophys.\n603, A34 (2017). [96] A. De Angelis, G. Galanti and M.

[118] The Perseus cluster hosts the active galaxy NGC 1275, which represents an identified source of photons both in the X-ray and HE band. Yet, because of the angular extension of Perseus, with IXPE, and with the other proposed missions of X-ray polarimetry, it is possible to separate the point-like emission of NGC 1275 and of surrounding filaments and cavity from the diffuse emission from the cluster, which is of our interest in the present analysis.
