    "abstractText": "A dilute suspension of active Brownian particles in a dense compressible viscoelastic fluid, forms a natural setting to study the emergence of nonreciprocity during a dynamical phase transition. At these densities, the transport of active particles is strongly influenced by the passive medium and shows a dynamical jamming transition as a function of activity and medium density. In the process, the compressible medium is actively churned up \u2013 for low activity, the active particle gets self-trapped in a cavity of its own making, while for large activity, the active particle ploughs through themedium, either accompanied by a moving anisotropic wake, or leaving a porous trail. A hydrodynamic approach makes it evident that the active particle generates a long-range density wake which breaks fore-aft symmetry, consistent with the simulations. Accounting for the back-reaction of the compressible medium leads to (i) dynamical jamming of the active particle, and (ii) a dynamical nonreciprocal attraction between two active particles moving along the same direction, with the trailing particle catching up with the leading one in finite time. We emphasize that these nonreciprocal effects appear only when the active particles are moving and so manifest in the vicinity of the jammingunjamming transition.",

At these densities, the transport of active particles is strongly influenced by the passive medium and shows a dynamical jamming transition as a function of activity and medium density. In the process, the compressible medium is actively churned up \u2013 for low activity, the active particle gets self-trapped in a cavity of its own making, while for large activity, the active particle ploughs through themedium, either accompanied by a moving anisotropic wake, or leaving a porous trail. A hydrodynamic approach makes it evident that the active particle generates a long-range density wake which breaks fore-aft symmetry, consistent with the simulations. Accounting for the back-reaction of the compressible medium leads to (i) dynamical jamming of the active particle, and (ii) a dynamical nonreciprocal attraction between two active particles moving along the same direction, with the trailing particle catching up with the leading one in finite time. We emphasize that these nonreciprocal effects appear only when the active particles are moving and so manifest in the vicinity of the jammingunjamming transition.\nThere is a lot of interest in the effective long-range interactions that emerge amongst active particles moving through a dynamically responsive medium. Examples include motile particles embedded in a Stokesianfluid1 or on an elastic substrate2 and diffusiophoretic flows in a viscous suspension of chemically active particles3. The absence of time reversal symmetry manifests in large density fluctuations at steady state4,5, and in the appearance of nonreciprocal interactions between particles2,3,6\u201312.\nIn this paper, we ask whether nonreciprocal interactions could emerge as a result of a dynamical phase transition. To realise such emergent nonreciprocity, we study a dilute collection of motile active particles embedded in a dense compressible fluid suspension close to dynamical arrest. Our results are based on (a) numerical simulations of an agent-based model, and (b) analytical and numerical treatments of hydrodynamic equations. We find that there is a dynamical feedback between the motility of the active particles and the corresponding slow remodelling of the passive compressible medium. Such active particles are ploughers, as opposed to cruisers whose motility speed is unaffected by the medium, e.g., ref. 2. As a result, ploughers exhibit a jamming-unjamming transition at fixed medium density. We find that in the unjammedphase, themoving active particles develop a dynamic nonreciprocal interaction with each other arising from the compressibility of the passive medium. We emphasise that this long-range nonreciprocal sensing appears only when the active particles are\nReceived: 16 September 2021\nAccepted: 8 July 2022\nCheck for updates\n1Simons Centre for the Study of Living Machines, National Centre for Biological Sciences (TIFR), Bangalore, India. 2Institute for Theoretical Physics, GeorgAugust-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen, 37077 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. 3Department of Physics, CarnegieMellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. 4International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (TIFR), Bangalore, India. 5These authors contributed equally: Jyoti Prasad Banerjee, Rituparno Mandal. e-mail: shashi@ncbs.res.in; madan@ncbs.res.in\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4533 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nmoving through a momentum non-conserving medium, and consequently shows up in the neighbourhood of the jamming-unjamming transition.\nOur study reveals a hitherto unappreciated facet in this intensely researched field of dense active assemblies13\u201321, where the focus has been on fluidisation15, intermittency16 and jamming16,17 close to glass transition.

To this passive medium, we add a dilute amount \u03d5a\u226a\u03d5 of active Brownian soft particles (ABPs)\n39\u201342, which are made motile by assigning to them independent random forces f = fn, whose orientation n \u00f0cos\u03b8; sin\u03b8\u00de is exponentially correlated over a persistence time \u03c4. The dynamics of all the interacting particles labelled i are described by a Langevin equation subject to a thermal noise\u03d1 of zero mean and variance equal to 2\u03b3kBT, while the subset i 2 A of ABPs are subject to additional active stochastic forces,\nm\u20acxi = \u03b3 _xi \u2202i \u2211 N\nj\u2260i V ij + fni 1\u00f0i2A\u00de +\u03d1i;\n_\u03b8i = \u03be i for i 2 A: \u00f01\u00de\nwhere 1\u00f0i2A\u00de is the indicator function which ensures that the active forces are restricted to particles i in the active set A.

Its effect on the xi-dynamics is an exponentially correlated vectorial noise with correlation time \u03c4, which being unrelated to the drag \u03b3, violates the fluctuation-dissipation relation. The inter-particle potential Vij is\ntaken to be purely repulsive (inverse power law) with particle diameter \u03c3 (details of the simulation appear in Supplementary Note 1). We work in the high friction limit, where particle inertia can be ignored.\nStarting from homogeneous and isotropic initial conditions, we evolve the system to its steady state by integrating over a time of order 102 \u03c4\u03b1, where \u03c4\u03b1 is the density relaxation time, also called \u03b1-relaxation time (Supplementary Note 2). Throughout, we work in the lowtemperature regime T =0.5, 10\u22121, 10\u22123, over a wide range of densities \u03d5 2 0:08; 0:97\u00bd , and scan through a broad range of the active parameters f and \u03c4.\nInterplay between active self-propulsion and viscoelasticity of the medium Figure 1A shows a schematic of a dilute suspension (\u03d5a\u226a\u03d5) of selfpropelled particles moving through a dense compressible medium. While the macroscopic structural properties of such dense assemblies are rather innocuous, their dynamical features display characteristic slow relaxation, aging43 and dynamical arrest15 as the density \u03d5 is increased. The dynamics of themedium at large space and time scales, is summarised in a phasediagram(Fig. 1B) in the f\u2212\u03d5plane (forfixedT, \u03d5a and \u03c4). The phase diagram is constructed by computing the \u03b1relaxation time \u03c4\u03b1 from the decay of the density overlap function Q(t) (Supplementary Note 2) using the definition Q(\u03c4\u03b1) = 1/e. This phase diagram clearly shows macroscopic liquid and solid (glass) phases adjoining a cage-hopping \u201csuper-cooled\u201d regime; fitting \u03c4\u03b1 to a VogelFulcher form (Supplementary Note 2) provides an estimate for the glass transition density \u03d5VFT(f) (Fig. 1B)15.\nTypical of an approach to a glass, the mean square displacement (MSD) averaged over all the passive particles shows a plateauing and cage-hopping dynamics, as the density \u03d5 is increased (Fig. S1)34,44\u201346. From these graphs we extract the long time diffusivity D\u221e (Supplementary Note 2). In the limit \u03d5a\u226a\u03d5 and of small \u03c4, wemay deduce the linear microrheological properties of the passive medium from the Fourier transform of the MSD47, with an effective temperature obtained from the mean kinetic energy of the passive particles. Fig. 1C clearly shows that the medium is a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid, with the elastic response G0 ~\u03c92 and the viscous response G\u2033 ~\u03c9, for small \u03c9, where the crossover timescale \u03c4M increases exponentially with the increase in area fraction \u03d5 close to the glass transition.\nWe now turn our attention to the minority component, the small fraction of motile active particles\u2014Fig. 2A\u2013D show typical trajectories of the activemotile particles at increasing values of\u03d5, keeping f and \u03c4\n(open circles) is obtained by fitting \u03c4\u03b1 to a Vogel-Fulcher form (Supplementary Note 2). The black squares represent state-points where the simulations have been performed. C Frequency dependence of the elastic G0 and viscous G\u2033 responses, at different values of \u03d5, shows that the passive system (i.e., f =0) behaves as a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid with relaxation time \u03c4M. (inset) \u03c4M as a function of area fraction\u03d5 increases exponentially close to the glass transition. These quantities are time averaged (over the time origin) and ensemble averaged (over 64 independent simulations). The numerical errors are very small, less than 1% of the actual values.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4533 2\nfixed. The density of the passive medium affects the transport of the active particles\u2014thus at low density \u03d5, the motile particles show an activity-dominated transport (Fig. 2A, B), which crosses over to a cagehopping dominated transport (Fig. 2C), as \u03d5 increases. As \u03d5 increases further, while still being less than \u03d5VFT(f), the active particles get dynamically arrested, (Fig. 2D). The plot of the MSD of the active particles for the different values of \u03d5 (Fig. 2E), suggests a crossover collapse from activity-dominated diffusion proportional to f2\u03c4 to a glass dominated cage-hopping diffusion with a Vogel-Fulcher form to, finally, dynamical arrest. We verify this using a crossover scaling form for the late time diffusion coefficient (Fig. 2F)\nD1\u00f0\u03d5; f \u00de= \u03b4\u03d5\u03bc D y f\n\u03b4\u03d5\u03bd\n\u00f02\u00de\nwith \u03b4\u03d5 =\u03d5*(f) \u2212\u03d5, the deviation of\u03d5 from its valuewhere the late time diffusion coefficient goes to zero. There are two possible choices for \u03d5*(f)\u2014the Vogel-Fulcher glass transition density \u03d5VFT (from an exponential fit) used to define the phase diagram in Fig. 1B and \u03d5MCT, which is the mode-coupling estimate (having a power law form) of the glass transition. The reason for choosing\u03d5MCT =\u03d5\n*(f) rather than \u03d5VFT is because the latter, being greater than \u03d5MCT, is very difficult to approach either experimentally or in a simulation. The excellent collapsewith exponents\u03bc \u2248 6.5 and \u03bd \u2248 2.5, suggests \u2018critical behaviour\u2019 at themode-coupling transition,\u03d5MCT(f). The asymptotic behaviour of the crossover scaling function D\u00f0y\u00de at small y (Fig. 2F), suggests that D\u221e \u2248 f2 \u03b4\u03d53/2, which crosses over to D\u221e \u2248 f \u03b4\u03d54 as y = f\u03b4\u03d5\u22122.5 goes to \u221e.\nWe remark on the connection between the crossover scaling of the MSD of active particles as a function of the density of the passive medium with recent observations on the crossover behaviour of bacterial motility in a three dimensional porous medium as a\nfunction of porosity25. In asmuch as our study applies to this bacterial motility context, we suggest that the reported crossover in ref. 25 reflects a phenotypic change arising from a coupling of the normal bacterial movement to the physical properties of the dense passive medium.\nRemodelling of the compressible viscoelastic medium by the motile particles We see that there is a strong feedback between the nature of active particle transport and the dynamical remodelling of the passive medium by the active particles48. This is especially prominent in the \u201csuper-cooled\u201d liquid regime above the glass transition, where the active motile particles churn up the medium, inducing large density fluctuations that result in long-lived density modulations that backreact on the transport of the active particles. For a fixed active force f and temperature T, the physical characteristics of the under-dense regions are a result of the interplay between the active driving time \u03c4 and the \u03d5-dependent density relaxation time, \u03c4\u03b1(\u03d5).\nAssociatedwith a typical trajectoryof the active particles shown in Fig. 3, we generate a density map of the medium in the vicinity of the active particle, as a function of \u03c4 and \u03c4\u03b1(\u03d5), keeping f large (f = 3.0) and T low (T = 10\u22123). The geometry and dynamics of the under-dense regions created by the active particles, show striking variations\u2014(i) a halo (density wake) that moves with the motile particle, (ii) a static cavity that traps the active particle and (iii) a long-lived porous and tortuous trail as the active particle ploughs through the medium. In Fig. 4A, we show how the shape of the under-dense region sharply changes from circular to elongated as a function of \u03c4. This geometrical transition appears to coincide with a dynamical transition in the active particle transport\u2014Fig. 4B shows that the speed of the active particle \u2223h _Ri\u2223 goes from being non-zero (where the active particle ploughs\nFig. 2 | Crossover in transport characteristics of minority active particles.

E Mean square displacement (scaled by time) computed from active particle trajectories suggests a crossover as a function of \u03d5. These quantities are time averaged (over the time origin) and ensemble averaged (over 64 independent simulations). The numerical\nerrors are very small, less than 1% of the actual values.

The scaling exponents are found to be \u03bc \u2248 6.5 and \u03bd \u2248 2.5. The dashed lines suggest a crossover of the scaling function from D\u00f0y\u00de ! y2 to D\u00f0y\u00de ! y, as y increases.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4533 3\nthrough the medium) to zero (where the active particle is self-trapped in a quasi-circular cavity of its own making), as \u03c4 decreases.\nThe profile and lifetime of the under-dense regions upon active remodelling, is a dynamical imprint of the transiting active particle (both its magnitude and direction) on the medium. In Fig. 4C, we activate only one of the particles of the medium, by imposing a step active force for a fixed duration. We measure the dynamical response of the passive medium (the change in \u03c1(x, t), the local density from its initial uniform profile) from the start of the activity, in the frame of reference of the moving active particle. We see that the density response \u03b4\u03c1(x, y) is fore-aft asymmetric and that this asymmetric profile relaxes slowly on switching off the active force. This demonstrates that the passive medium (i) is a compressible fluid, and (ii) retains a memory of the moving event (its magnitude and direction) for some time.\nIn summary, we find that the active particles remodel the passive compressible medium and that the remodelled compressible medium reacts back on the active particle affecting its large scale movement.\nThe back-reaction from the passive medium, can either facilitate movement of the active particle (in the \u2018moving wake\u2019 and \u2018porous\u2019 regimes) or trap the active particle (in the active \u2018self-trapping\u2019 regime \u2014a similar self-trapping regime has been described in ref. 49, although it must be noted that the active particles considered there are squirmers, carrying a force-dipole in a momentum conserving background fluid. Self-propelled droplets have also recently been shown to get chemotactically caged in chemical trails of their own making50). A striking example of such facilitated transport of active particles in a compressible gel is the the ATP-dependentmovement of transcription factories that move through the dense nuclear medium of cells24.\nHydrodynamics of active particles moving in a compressible viscoelastic fluid For a deeper understanding of the interplay between themovement of the active particles and the asymmetric dynamical response of the compressible passive medium, we construct a set of active hydrodynamic equations5 and analyse their solutions in simple situations.\nFig. 3 | Remodelling of the compressiblemediumby the active particles.Underdense regions in the compressiblemedium (darker blue colours indicate low \u03c1, and the yellow colours indicate a high \u03c1where \u03c1 is the local density) that is remodelled by themotileparticles, as a functionof thepersistence time \u03c4 anddensity relaxation time \u03c4\u03b1(\u03d5), for fixed (large) f. The geometry of the under-dense regions goes from being a static cavity to a moving wake around the motile particle, to a long-lived\nporous trail.

C Dynamical response of the passive medium recorded at different time points, to a step active force from a single active particle (shown at right), measured in the frame of reference of the moving particle. The response is fore-aft asymmetric and relaxes slowly on switching off the active force.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4533 4\nThe passive compressible fluid is described by the local density \u03c1 and velocity v fields,while the dilute collectionof active particles iwith position Ri(t) are propelled by an active force of magnitude f along their orientations ni(t). The density of the medium obeys a continuity equation,\n\u2202t\u03c1+\u2207 \u03c1v\u00f0 \u00de=0 \u00f03\u00de\nSince the dynamics is overdamped, the local velocity of the medium is obtained by local force balance,\n\u0393v=\u03b7\u22072v B\u03c1\u2207\u03c1+ \u2211 i2A f ni\u00f0t\u00de\u03b4 r Ri\u00f0t\u00de\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere the velocity of the compressible fluid is driven by the bodyforces f ni2A imposed by the moving active particles. Note that this contribution is present, since the dynamics takes place in a medium that does not conserve momentum.\nThe second term on the right represents the forces that oppose the movement of the passive particles that are being pushed by the active body-forces. These come from an active pressure, which, to leading order, arises from a local compressibility of the passive fluid, P\u221d \u03c12 +\u2026, due to inter-particle interactions (at low T, the linear contribution is insignificant). The \u201ccompressibility\u201d B, with units of force\u00d7 length, is positive and can in principle depend on \u03c1.\nThe other terms correspond to the usual momentum dissipation, a viscous contribution \u03b7 coming from collisions with the passive particles and friction \u0393 arising from both collisions with other particles and from the ambientmedium. Importantly, in the highdensity regime approaching the glass transition, these kinetic coefficients \u03b7 and \u0393may be strongly dependent on the local density \u03c1.\nThe dynamics of the active particles in the overdamped limit is also given by force balance. In the dilute limit, low \u03d5a, when there are no direct interactions between active particles, the balance is again between the propulsive body-forces and the local pressure due to the compressible fluid,\n\u03b3 _Ri = fni C\u03c1\u2207\u03c1\u2223at Ri \u00f05\u00de\n_\u03b8i = \u03be i\u00f0t\u00de \u00f06\u00de\nfor all i 2 A. Note that ni \u00f0cos \u03b8i; sin\u03b8i\u00de, and the athermal orientational noise \u03be i has zero mean and is delta-correlated, h\u03be i\u00f0t\u00de\u03be j\u00f0t0\u00dei \u00bc 2\u03c4 1\u03b4ij\u03b4\u00f0t t0\u00de. Equation (5) accounts for the backreaction of the medium on the dynamics of the active particles, which feels a block due to particle pile up ahead of it. We have assumed in (6) that the direction of the propulsion force is set by some internal detailed-balance violating mechanism, independent of the passive medium. Note that the active compressibility C is positive, dependent on \u03c1, and could be different from B. Further, in the limit of low\u03d5a, one expects \u03b3 to be a single particle friction, while \u0393 to be a collective frictional dissipation; the latter could be high when \u03c1 is large.\nWe will refer to such polar active particles as ploughers, as opposed to cruisers, whose speed is unaffected by the medium, e.g., ref. 2.\nNote that although the passive and active particles have comparable sizes, we treat the passive medium using a coarse-grained density, but the active particles as \u201cpoint-particulate\u201d. Thus, our hydrodynamicdescription shouldbe validover scales larger than a few particle sizes.\nWe now check whether the continuum hydrodynamic equations, (3)\u2013(5), describe, in a coarse-grained sense, the agent-based dynamics represented by (17). For this we compute the local coarse-grained\ndensity and velocity fields of the passive fluid from our simulation trajectories, using an interpolation and smoothing scheme (Supplementary Note 3).\nTake the case of a single particle, with no orientational fluctuations\u2014Fig. 5A shows a simulation snapshot of an active particle surrounded by the compressible medium. We compute the coarsegrained fields, \u03c1(r, t), v(r, t) and their spatial derivatives\u2014these results appear in Fig. 5B\u2013D. To verify (4), we plot vy(r, t) vs. \u03c1\u2202y\u03c1 to obtain B/\u0393, fromwhichwe compute vx(r, t). The relation between the local velocity of themedium and the pile up of the density embodied in (4) is shown to hold up in Fig. 5B, even making allowance for a possible density dependent coefficientB/\u0393 (the contribution fromviscous dissipation is significantly lower than the rest and sowedrop it).We find that there is a dynamical transition between self-trapping at low f and movement (Fig. 5C). From this, we obtain the value of \u03b3 from the slope using (5) and hence C/\u03b3 (Fig. 5D). From this we see that the form of the backreaction embodied in (5) is also borne out in Fig. 5D, albeit with a density (or force) dependent C/\u03b3 (inset Fig. 5D). Note that, consistent with our discussion above,C/\u03b3 is anorder ofmagnitude larger thanB/\u0393. The fact thatC/\u03b3drops suddenly beyond f \u2248 2.5, would suggest that the friction experienced by the active particle increases with increasing f and then saturates to a constant value. In principle, if this drop is large enough, this could lead to an active discontinuous shear thickening51.\nLinearised hydrodynamics of a single active particlemoving in a compressible medium We first look at the dynamics of a single active particle in the compressible medium. Let us take the limit of large \u03c4, and so over the timescale of interest, theorientationn isfixed, say along the x\u0302 direction. As the active particle moves through the medium, it creates density inhomogeneities, which relax over time. Using (3) and (4) we get,\n\u2202t\u03c1+ B \u0393 \u2207 \u03c12\u2207\u03c1 + f \u0393 \u2202x \u03c1\u03b4 \u00f02\u00de\u00f0x X \u00f0t\u00de; y\u00de =0: \u00f07\u00de\nThis nonlinear equation resembles an anisotropic Burgers equation with a source52, and so one might expect travelling pulse solutions. To see this explicitly, we perform a linear analysis about the uniform density of the ploughed medium. In this limit, we take \u0393 and B to be independent of \u03c1. Again in this limit, we ignore the back-reaction term C\u03c1\u2207 \u03c1 in (5); we will say that the active velocity, v0, is reduced from its bare value f/\u03b3 in a \u03c1 dependent manner.\nAfter initial transients, the density excess of the medium can then be written in terms of the collective coordinate,\n\u03c1\u00f0r; t\u00de=\u03c1\u00f0r R\u00f0t\u00de\u00de\nAnalytical solutions of the resulting linearised equation can be easily obtained by transforming the equation to coordinates in the moving frame of the active particle, u = x \u2212 X(t) and w = y, followed by Fourier transforming in (u,w) (see Supplementary Note 4). The excess density profile \u03c1(u,w) in the co-moving frame takes the form,\n\u03c1\u00f0u; w\u00de=2D\u00f0u\u00de I 1\u00f0u; w\u00de+ I2\u00f0u; w\u00de\n\u03be\n\u00f08\u00de\nwhere,\nI 1\u00f0u; w\u00de= u=\u03beffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi u2 +w2 p K1\nu2 +w2 1 2\n\u03be\n2 4\n3 5\nI2\u00f0u; w\u00de=K0 u2 +w2 1 2\n\u03be\n2 4\n3 5\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4533 5\nwith K0 and K1 being the modified Bessel functions of the second kind, and\nD\u00f0u\u00de= \u00f0\u03c10 +\u03c1\u00f00; 0\u00de\u00def 2\u03c0v0\u03be\u0393 e u \u03be \u00f09\u00de\nThe decay length \u03be is given by,\n\u03be = 2B\u03c120 \u0393v0 : \u00f010\u00de\nSince the fixed direction of motility breaks rotational invariance, it is natural to expect an anisotropy in the density profile. However, what comes as a surprise is that moving density profile breaks fore-aft symmetry. This is most apparent when we set w =0+, and use the asymptotic expansion53\nK0\u00f0z\u00de ~ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03c0 2\u2223z\u2223 r e z 1 1 8z + . . .\n\u00f011\u00de\nand\nK1\u00f0z\u00de ~ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03c0 2\u2223z\u2223 r e z 1 + 3 8z + . . .\n\u00f012\u00de\nfor large z. We see immediately that in the moving frame, the density profile in front to the motile particle is piled up and decays exponentially over a scale \u03be from the pile up. The larger the active force f, the smaller is \u03be, implying a sharper pile up. However, behind the active particle there is a long-range under-dense region, which decays as a power-law \u2223u\u2223\u22123/2 (Supplementary Note 4).\nKnowing the density profile to linear order, we use (4) and (5) to compute the velocity flow field of the passive fluid and the velocity of the active particle. A comparison of the density profiles and the velocity flows with the simulation results is shown in Fig. 6A\u2013F. The agreement is satisfying; in particular the demonstration in Fig. 6C that the excess density profile behind the moving active particle decays as the advertised power-law. Onemay, in principle, improve on the linear theory by setting up a diagrammatic perturbation expansion. However, since the linear theory compares well with the numerical simulation of (17) and with the \u201cexact\u201d numerical solution of the nonlinear equation (7) in d = 1 (next section), we do not take this up here.\nAccuracy of linear theory\u2014comparison with \u201cexact\u201d numerical analysis of nonlinear equation in d= 1 A linear analysis in d = 1, shows that the density profile is,\n\u03c1\u00f0u\u00de= \u00f0\u03c10 +\u03c1\u00f00; 0\u00de\u00def v0\u03be\u0393 e u \u03be foru > 0\n=0 for u < 0; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere the length scale is given by \u03be =B\u03c120=\u0393v0 (SupplementaryNote 5). The density piles up in front of the active particle and decays exponentially ahead of it, while behind the active particle there is no wake. We now check to see how this calculated profile compares with an exact numerical solution of the nonlinear equation (7). The accurate numerical solution of this nonlinear PDE requires some care due to shock forming tendencies in the convective term (Supplementary Note 6). The result for the density profile of the travelling pulse is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. The comparison with the linear theory is quite good, the absence of the wake is vividly apparent in the onedimensional exact numerical solution (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nC Mean velocity of the active particle _X (red and green dots) vs. active force, f, showing the dynamical transition between self-trapping at low f and movement. The mean is obtained by averaging over different initial realisations of the passive medium. Following (5), the value of \u03b3 can be extracted from the slope at large f. D To verify (5), we plot f =\u03b3 _X and \u03c1\u2202x\u03c1 (just in front of the active particle) vs. f. This allows us to compute the parameterC/\u03b3 (inset), ameasureof the back-reaction of the medium on the motile particle. The value of C/\u03b3 \u2248 150 is an order of magnitude larger than B/\u0393 and drops down to 100 at larger f. For C and D the smaller background symbols indicate data from individual simulations.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4533 6\nTwo active particles moving through the compressible medium The fore-aft asymmetric long-range density wake around the motile particle has an unusual effect on the interactions between two ormore motile particles. This is best illustrated by considering the dynamics of two motile particles in a simplifying geometry where both particles move in the same direction with their separation vector being parallel or perpendicular to the direction of motion.\nLet the trajectories of the two active particles be represented by R1(t),R2(t), in the limit of large persistence time, so thatwecan take the orientations n1 and n2 to be time independent. To O\u00f0\u03b4\u03c1\u00de, these particles, individually, leave a time dependent anisotropic and fore-aft asymmetric wake described by \u03c1(x, y, t), whose back-reaction on the movement of the active particles themselves, is easily estimated\n\u03b3 _R1 = fn1 C\u03c10\u2207\u03c1\u2223self1 C\u03c10\u2207\u03c1\u22231 2 \u00f014\u00de\n\u03b3 _R2 = fn2 C\u03c10\u2207\u03c1\u2223self2 C\u03c10\u2207\u03c1\u22232 1 \u00f015\u00de\nwhere i\u2190 j denotes the effect of particle j on particle i. These equations may be cast in terms of the relative coordinate Rrel =R1 \u2212R2 and the centre of mass Rcm= (R1 +R2)/2. For the two geometries under consideration, we find the following (details in Supplementary Note 4). 1. The separation vector between the leading particle 1 and the\ntrailingparticle 2 is along the x\u0302 direction, parallel to their direction of motion (Fig. 7A). We find that while the centre of mass velocity _Xcm >0 (Fig. 7B inset), the inter-particle separation Xrel decreases in time\n(Fig. 7A), i.e., _X rel < 0, starting from the initial value, till it reaches Xrel \u2248 1.5064\u03be, which is a stable fixed point of the dynamics. This corresponds to a bound state of the two particles in this linearised theory, which appears to be consistent with the simulations (Fig. 7C). The speed of approach of the particle 2 to particle 1 first increases slowly and then rapidly decreases to zero as the bound state is reached (Fig. 7C, inset). This nonreciprocal sensing2,3,6, is a consequence of the fore-aft asymmetric wake and causes the trailing particle to catch up with the leading one in finite time (Fig. 7B). A dominant balance analysis of the equation for Xrel shows an early time scaling of the form Xrel\u221d \u2223t \u2212 t*\u22232/7 as the particles approach each other (Fig. 7C). 2. The separation vector between the particle 1 and the particle 2 is along the y\u0302 direction, perpendicular to their direction of motion (Fig. 7D). Here again the centre of mass velocity _Xcm >0 (and is the same as the single particle speed, Fig. 7E), and the inter-particle separation Yrel decreases in time (Fig. 7D), i.e., _Y rel < 0, starting from the initial value. This leads to the trajectories of particles 1 and 2 converging towards each other in a symmetrical manner (Fig. 7D). An asymptotic analysis shows that the relative position Yrel\u221d \u2223 t \u2212 t*\u22231/2 as t\u2192 t* (Fig. 7F).\nThe second case resembles the magnetic force between two parallel wires carrying current in the same direction, and is a consequenceof the breaking of time reversal symmetry. Likewise, a pair of active particles initially moving towards each other, will scatter off\nFig. 6 | Density profile and flow field surrounding a single active particle moving through the passive medium.

            "text": "In this paper, we have studied the dynamics of a dilute suspension of active Brownian particles moving through a dense compressible passive fluid that dissipates momentum through friction. The dynamical interplay between the active particles and the passive medium, not only results in a remodelling of the passivemedium, but also in a backreaction on the movement of the active particles themselves. Such active ploughers show a jamming transition at fixed density of the medium. In the unjammed phase, a moving active plougher generates a fore-aft asymmetric density wake, which is the source of the longrange nonreciprocal interaction between moving active particles mediated dynamically through the passive compressiblemedium. This emergent nonreciprocal interaction is a consequence of a dynamical phase transition to a state with finite current. This leads to a nonreciprocal sensing wherein a trailing particle senses and catches up with a leading particle moving ahead of it. Further, the movement of the active particle leaves a dynamical trace on the responsivemedium, these effects of nonreciprocity are more indelibly manifest in the vicinity of the jamming-unjamming transition.\nWe recall that in (6) we have assumed that the direction of the propulsion force is set by some mechanism internal to the active particle and therefore independent of the passive medium. To experience the full scope of nonreciprocal effects possible here, one needs to extend the hydrodynamic equations (5), (6), to include an active torque that drives ni to align along the direction of the smallest\n(largest) density gradient\u2207 \u03c1\u2014this will lead to both taxis and phoresis, features that have been explored in refs. 3, 6 in other contexts. Such considerations lead to a simple physical version of sense-and-capture, even in the absence of any kind of chemical sensing.\nThe success of our hydrodynamic analysis motivates us to go beyond the study of one and two active particles and look at manybody effects54. In ref. 15, we had seenhow theminority component selfpropelled particles cluster on account of activity; the long-range nonreciprocal interaction observed here, will translate to a new kind of nonreciprocal motility induced clustering42 of active particles mediated by the passive medium. This and its relationship with the anisotropic Burgers equation with coloured noise52 will be taken up later."
