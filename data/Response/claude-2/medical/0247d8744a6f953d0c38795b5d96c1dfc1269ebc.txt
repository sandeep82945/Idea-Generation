 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of different types and intensities of physical activity on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study looked at leisure-time exercise but overall physical activity including activities of daily living should also be studied.

2. Investigate the mechanisms linking socioeconomic status and psychological distress during COVID-19. For example, does income affect access to exercise opportunities and thereby impact mental health? 

3. Conduct longitudinal studies to establish causality between physical activity, socioeconomic factors and mental health during pandemics. The current cross-sectional study could not determine causal relationships.  

4. Examine the role of social support and living arrangements in mitigating psychological distress during pandemics across age groups. The current study suggested living with others may help reduce distress in older adults.

5. Develop and test multi-level interventions (individual, social, environmental) to promote physical activity and reduce socioeconomic disparities in mental health during pandemics. Intervention studies are needed beyond observational research.
