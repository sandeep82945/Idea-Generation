    "abstractText": "Pure bismuth ferrite (BFO) and BFO with impurity phases (Bi2O3 or Fe2O3) were synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Complex dielectric permittivity (\u03b5) and electrical conductivity (\u03c3) were determined by complex impedance measurements at different frequencies (200 Hz\u20132 MHz) and temperatures (25\u2013290) \u25e6C. The conductivity spectrum of samples, \u03c3(f), complies with Jonscher\u2019s universal law and the presence of impurity phases leads to a decrease in the static conductivity (\u03c3DC); this result is correlated with the increased thermal activation energy of the conduction in impure samples compared to the pure BFO sample. The conduction mechanism in BFO and the effect of impurity phases on \u03c3 and \u03b5 were analyzed considering the variable range hopping model (VRH). Based on the VRH model, the hopping length (Rh), hopping energy (Wh) and the density of states at the Fermi level (N(EF)) were determined for the first time, for these samples. In addition, from \u03b5(T) dependence, a transition in the electronic structure of samples from a semiconductor-like to a conductor-like behavior was highlighted around 465\u2013490 K for all samples. The results obtained are useful to explain the conduction mechanisms from samples of BFO type, offering the possibility to develop a great variety of electrical devices with novel functions.",

            "text": "The bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3), BFO as it will henceforth be referred to, is a compound with a perovskite structure that has received considerable attention because of its technical applications [1,2], being one of the most promising multiferroic materials [1,3]. In general, the bismuth ferrite is metastable in air, with spots of impurities that appear below the melting temperature [4] being optically visible. The most important properties of BFO are its Curie (TC = 1103 K) and N\u00e9el temperatures (TN = 643 K) that allow this compound to keep its properties at extreme temperatures. The phase of the compound BFO at room temperature is rhombohedral (R3c) [5,6], having a rhombohedral angle with a value between 89.3\u25e6 and 89.48\u25e6 [7,8]. BFO has been intensively studied because of its potential applications in many domains due to both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties [9]. Various synthesis methods such as sol\u2013gel [10], hydrothermal [11], microwave hydrothermal [12] and microemulsion technique [13] have been employed in an attempt to obtain nanosize and monocrystalline BFO particles. Particle morphology also plays an important role in determining BFO ferroelectric performance [9]. However, it is important to note that, in most cases, it is difficult to obtain BFO particles with nanoscale size, single\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4764. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15144764 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4764 2 of 15\ncrystalline phase and favorable morphology due in part to the secondary phase formation in the Bi2O3-Fe2O3 system [14]. Therefore, it is still a big challenge for scientists and engineers to achieve single crystalline BFO nanoparticles with favorable morphology. In this paper, BFO polycrystalline materials are obtained by the hydrothermal method. The synthesized samples, both single-phase BFO and BFO with impurity phases (Bi2O3 or Fe2O3), were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis to study their morphology and structure. More authors have determined some electrical and dielectric properties for materials such as BiFeO3 thin films [15\u201317], for BiFeO3 doped with rare earths [18] and for perovskite ferroelectrics (Ba, Sr)TiO3 type, in the microwave field [19]. Moreover, theoretical calculations allowed the determination of the band gap energy both for bulk and thin film BFO structures [20], the obtained values being 2.7 eV (bulk) and 2.5 eV (thin film), with the authors showing that the conduction band contributes most to these differences. The determination of the electrical conductivity (\u03c3) and dielectric permittivity (\u03b5) of the bismuth ferrite crystalline compounds and experimental studies regarding the low frequency and temperature dependence of \u03c3 and \u03b5 are few in the literature. As a result, the purpose of our work is to study the conduction mechanisms of BFO samples and how the Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 impurity phases affect those mechanisms, taking into account Mott\u2019s theoretical VRH model [21,22], with the possibility of developing new applications in the fields of electronics, memory devices and thermo-electric sensors, which could be electrically approached. Furthermore, the effect of the phase impurities in BFO material on the activation thermal energy of conduction and of the Mott parameters were studied. For this, experimental measurements of the electrical conductivity and of the complex dielectric permittivity over a wide temperature and frequency range were performed."

            "text": "For the preparation of the BFO sample, the hydrothermal synthesis route was used. For this, the solutions of bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3\u00b75H2O) and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O) in distilled water were mixed in stoichiometric proportions (1:1 mole ratio), resulting in 10 mL of solution. This resultant solution and 10 mL of 1 M NaOH solution were put together under vigorous stirring before being transferred to a Teflon line autoclave that was then closed and put into an oven at 200 \u25e6C for 12 h. After this procedure, the precipitate in the form of a brown powder was removed and washed with double distilled water before drying at 70 \u25e6C to obtain the final polycrystalline BFO powder. The sample obtained was a pure bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3), denoted as Sample S1 (BFO). Similarly, both a slight change in the quantities of bismuth nitrate and iron nitrate and washing the precipitate with distilled water removed from the autoclave leads to the obtaining of two other samples of bismuth ferrite but also containing impurities, denoted by sample S2 (BFO with Bi2O3 impurities phase) and sample S3 (BFO with Fe2O3 impurities phase). To check the crystal structure of the obtained samples, X-ray powder diffraction was performed with an XRD PANalytical X\u2019Pert PRO MPD Diffractometer (Almelo, The Netherlands) using Cu-K radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA over the 2\u03b8 range of 20\u25e6\u201360\u25e6. The morphology, structures and stoichiometric composition of samples, as well as the size of the impurity phase, were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM/EDX Inspect S model, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). For electric and dielectric measurements, all three samples of polycrystalline BFO powder were pressed into disks of the same sizes (6 mm diameter and approximately 1 mm thickness) after being mixed with a binder solution (5% PVA-polyvinyl alcohol). The disk was dried and then sintered in air at 100 \u25e6C and 700 \u25e6C, respectively. A layer of Ag was deposited on both polished surfaces of the disk, representing the two electrodes that were connected to an LCR-meter, with which the measurements of the complex impedance of investigated samples were performed.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4764 3 of 15\nThe electrical conductivity and the complex dielectric permittivity of samples were determined by complex impedance measurements at different frequencies between 200 Hz and 2 MHz and at different temperatures from 25 to 290 \u25e6C, using an LCR meter TEGAM model 3550 (Geneva, OH, USA) and an electrical oven [23]."

This compon nt is corr lated with the dielectric relaxation processes determined by the localized electric charge car iers [21,25], b ing given by the Equation (3):\n\u03c3 = \u03c3DC(T) + \u03c3AC(\u03c9, T) (3)\n\u03c3AC(\u03c9, T) = A0(T)(2\u03c0 f ) n(T) (4)\nIn Equations (3) and (4), \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f is the angular frequency, A0(T) is a temperaturedependent parameter, and the exponent n is dimensionless and temperature-dependent (n < 1). As can be observed from Figure 4, the two regions of the conductivity spectrum are well defined: the static component (\u03c3DC) up to frequency of 1\u20132 kHz and the dynamic component (\u03c3AC) above 3 kHz, which increases rapidly with the frequency. From Figure 4, the \u03c3DC values of the static conductivity of the investigated samples were determined, obtaining the following values: \u03c3DC = 6.30\u00d7 10\u22125 S/m(for sample S1), \u03c3DC = 3.36\u00d7 10\u22125 S/m (for sample S2) and \u03c3DC = 1.28\u00d7 10\u22125 S/m (for sample S3). The results show that the presence Bi2O3 or Fe2O3 impurity phases in the pure BFO sample lea s o a decrease in the static conductivity of both S2 and S3 samples.

The obtained values are: n(S1) = 0.297, n(S2) = 0.407 and n(S3) = 0.521. Appling the\ncorrelated barrier hopping (CBH) model [26], the n exponent can be written in the first\napproximation as follows:\nmW\nkT n 6 1\u2212= (6)\nwhere Wm is the maximum energy of the barrier (or band gap energy).

The obtained values are: n(S1) = 0.297, n(S2) = 0.407 and n(S3) = 0.521. Appling the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model [26], the n exponent can be written in the first approximation as f llows:\nn = 1\u2212 6kT Wm\n(6)\nwhere Wm is the maximum energy of the barrier (or band gap energy). Knowing the value of the exponent n and considering T = 300 K, from Equation (6) results: Wm = 0.222 eV for sample S1, Wm = 0.263 eV for sample S2, and Wm = 0.325 eV for sample S3. As a result, the presence of the impurities phases in the BFO sample leads to an increase in the Wm of sam les S2 (BFO-Bi) a d S3 (BFO-Fe), respectively, compared to the Wm of the sample S1 (BFO), with these values being correl te to the decrease in the values of the static conductivity (\u03c3DC) of the samples S2 (BFO-Bi) and S3 (BFO-Fe) in relatio to the sampl S1 (BFO).\n3.2.2.

As can be observed from Table 2, Rh decreases and Wh increases with increasing temperature for all samples. In addition, the parameters Rh and Wh are higher for samples S2 and S3, which contain impurity phases of Bi2O3 or Fe2O3, than for the pure bismuth ferrite sample (sample S1), at any temperature (T) in the investigated temperature range, from 25 \u25e6C to Tmax.\nIn the VRH model, \u03c3DC(T) can be written in another form [22]: \u03c3DC = \u03c30 exp ( \u2212 B\nT1/4\n) (12)\nwhere\nB = 4EA,cond\nkT3/4 (13)\nrepresents the slope of the experimental dependence, ln \u03c3DC(T\u22121/4), from Figure 6 is the same with the slope (T0)1/4 of the same dependency resulting from Equation (4), k is the Boltzmann constant, and EA,cond is the thermal activation energy of the electrical conduction corresponding to the samples.

As we showed in Section 3.2.2, the samples are characterized by a hopping process of charge carriers, thermally activated, which determines their electrical conductivity. Moreover, the temperature dependence of \u03c3DC (see Figure 6) looks similar to the temperature dependence of \u03b5\u2032 (Figure 11), with maxima at comparable temperatures. The increase in the conductivity of samples due to the thermally activated hopping of charge carriers leads to the increase in the electric charge accumulated at the grain boundaries in the samples. This is equivalent to an increase in the electric dipoles associated with each grain and to the increase in the real component of the complex dielectric permittivity. Therefore, a similar behavior with a temperature of \u03c3DC and \u03b5\u2032 proves that the dielectric polarization in the investigated samples is determined by the interfacial mechanisms of the Maxwell\u2013Wagner type [36]. At the same time, in addition to the polarization due to the electron hopping and interfacial polarization, an ionic polarization may occur in the investigated samples [27]. The values obtained by us for the temperature at which the \u03b5\u2032 is maximum (see Figure 10) are close to those observed by other authors [37\u201339] for composite ceramic samples of perovskite type located between 453 K and 628 K, with variations depending on the composition of the sample, particle size and frequency at which the dependence on temperature of \u03b5\u2032 was determined.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4764 13 of 15"

            "text": "Single-phase bismuth ferrite (BFO) and BFO with impurity phases (of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3) were prepared using the hydrothermal method, and then X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis were used to examine the structural and morphological properties of the samples. The frequency and temperature dependencies of electrical conductivity (\u03c3) and of dielectric permittivity (\u03b5) over the frequency range of 200 Hz\u20132 MHz and different temperatures from 25 \u25e6C to 290 \u25e6C were determined. The spectrum of conductivity (\u03c3(f)) at constant temperature follows Jonscher\u2019s universal law. Based on the temperature dependence of \u03c3DC, a transition of the samples from a semiconductor-like behavior to a conductor-like behavior was highlighted at temperatures between 465 and 490 K. Using the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity at a constant value of frequency (f = 0.5 kHz) and based on the model VRH, the conduction mechanisms in samples and the effect of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 impurity phases in the BFO sample on the static conductivity \u03c3DC were analyzed. The presence of impurity phases in BFO samples induces higher thermal activation energies of conduction, with this result being correlated to the decrease in the static conductivity (\u03c3DC) in these samples compared to the pure BFO sample. Based on the VRH model, the hopping length (Rh) the hopping energy (Wh) and the density of states at the Fermi level (N(EF)) were determined for the first time in the case of these samples. Both Rh and Wh increase at a constant temperature in the presence of impurity phases compared to Rh and Wh values from the pure BFO sample. Furthermore, the density of states at the Fermi level (N(EF)) decreases in the presence of the impurity phases compared to the N(EF) value from the pure BFO sample. This decrease in N(EF) was attributed to the increase in the hopping distance between the localized states of the charge carriers. The obtained results show that at low frequencies (up to approximately 0.5 kHz), the component \u03b5\u201d has values much higher than \u03b5\u2032, thus resulting that, up to these frequencies, the conduction losses in the samples are predominant with respect to those due to the dielectric relaxation. Considering the values obtained for the static conductivity (\u03c3DC) of the samples and eliminating the losses due to electrical conduction, a dielectric relaxation process was revealed, which was attributed to the interfacial polarization. These results are very useful to explain the conduction mechanisms in BFO samples, both single-phase and with impurity phases (of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3), offering the possibility to develop a large variety of electronic and electrical devices with new functions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.M. and C.N.M.; methodology, I.M., M.M. and C.C.; measurements, C.C. and M.M.; formal analysis, C.N.M.; investigation, C.C., I.M. and M.M.; supervision, C.N.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, I.M. and C.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.M., C.C. and C.N.M.; funding acquisition, I.M. and C.N.M.
