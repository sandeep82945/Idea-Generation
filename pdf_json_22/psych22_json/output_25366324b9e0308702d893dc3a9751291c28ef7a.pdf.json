    "abstractText": "Objectives: The rapid increase in Chinese obesity rates has aroused research interest in addiction\u2010like eating (AE); however, the unavailability of assessment tools is a major barrier to fur\u2010 ther investigation. To address the research gap, this study aimed to evaluate the psychometric prop\u2010 erties of the Addiction\u2010like Eating Behavior Scale (AEBS) and explore associations between AE and threemodern eating\u2010related habits (i.e., ordering delivery food, eating late\u2010nightmeals andwatching mukbang) among Chinese adults. Methods: The STROBE checklist was followed for reporting this cross\u2010sectional study. We conducted a telephone survey with a two\u2010stage cluster random sampling method and acquired a probability sample of 1010 community\u2010dwelling Chinese adults (55.2% fe\u2010 male; age: 18\u201388 years, M = 38.52, SD = 14.53). Results: Results confirmed the conceptualized two\u2010 factor structure of AEBS with satisfactory model fit, reliability and validity. Chinese adults reported higher levels of AE in the context of low dietary control rather than appetitive drive. These two AE factors showed significant and positive associations with modern eating\u2010related habits. Conclu\u2010 sions: The current study was the first to assess AE among Chinese adults and provided a reliable and valid assessment tool. Our correlational findings can also be utilized for designing interventions for weight management and healthy eating.",

            "text": "The prevalence of obesity has increased to 13% over the past few decades worldwide, nearly tripling from 1975 to 2015 [1]. As one of themajor contributing factors to this obesity surge, addictive behaviors related to food and eating have attracted growing clinical and re\u2011 search attention and inspired different approaches to understanding this subject [2,3]. The addictive nature of particular foods (e.g., sweet and fatty foods) [4] has been a predomi\u2011 nate focus of study, establishing links between addictive patterns of food consumption and greater risk for being overweight and psychologically distressed [5]. Nevertheless, this ap\u2011 proach has been criticized for its over\u2011reliance on the substance\u2011related addiction model and its neglect of differences between food and psychoactive substances [6,7]. Addiction\u2011 like eating, on the other hand, centers on maladaptive eating behaviors rather than food and provides a unique perspective to complement what might have been neglected by the food addiction approach [8]. Thus, addiction\u2011like eating is an emerging approach based on the behavioral addiction model. By adopting this approach, the present study aimed to take the first step in assessing addiction\u2011like eating in Chinese adults and explore its associations with modern eating\u2011related habits to delineate a more comprehensive picture of addictive behaviors related to food and eating in contemporary society. With rapid urbanization and economic development in China, problematic eating and food consumption have emerged among residents over the past few years. A report on\nNutrients 2022, 14, 4836. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14224836 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nChinese residents\u2019 chronic diseases and nutrition [9] showed that more than 50% of Chi\u2011 nese adults were obese or overweight in 2019\u2014\u2011a rate that is expected to rise to 65.3% in 2030 [10]. Research on the food addiction approach, which frequently used the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) [4] or its later revision the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0) [11], has also been frequently applied in extant Chinese studies. These studies underscored the adverse effect of food addiction onChinese adults\u2019management ofweight and health [12\u201315]; however, they also omitted the alternative approach of addiction\u2011like eating, which could have broadened the horizon on this matter with both theoretical and practical significance [6,8,16]. One of the plausible reasons for the scarcity of studies on addiction\u2011like eatingmight lie in the lack of assessment tools in the Chinese context; hence, the primary objective of the current study was to bridge this gap by examining the psy\u2011 chometric properties of the Addiction\u2011like Eating Behavior Scale (AEBS) [8] among Chi\u2011 nese adults. The AEBS assesses observable behaviors of addiction\u2011like eating from the behavioral addiction perspective [8]. It was developed based onWiers et al.\u2019s [17] dual\u2011process theory of motivation, which considers addiction to be an imbalance between two systems: an im\u2011 pulsive system, whereby pleasure is pursued through immediate gratification or reward and a reflective system that focuses on the prospect of obtaining pleasure through making use of higher order decision\u2011making structures of the brain. This theory has been widely used to explain the development and maintenance of other behavioral addictions, such as disordered gambling [18]. In line with this theory, Ruddock et al.\u2019s [8] AEBS consists of two components: appetitive drive (i.e., increased responsivity to reward\u2011related cues) and lowdietary control (i.e., diminished ability to exert inhibitory control over these responses). This conceptualized two\u2011factor structure of AEBS, along with its satisfactory internal con\u2011 sistency and convergent validity, was found useful, not only among community\u2011dwelling adults in the UK [8], but also in adults fromCanada [19], Brazil [20] and Turkey [21]. Given the psychometric soundness of AEBS, we expected this scale to provide a reliable and valid assessment of Chinese adults\u2019 addiction\u2011like eating in the present study. In addition to the elevated risk for problematic eating and food consumption, societal development in China has resulted in changes to its residents\u2019 eating\u2011related habits. Recent research has suggested that eating late\u2011night meals, ordering delivery food (e.g., usually through digital applications [22]), and watching mukbang (i.e., a live\u2011streaming host eat\u2011 ing, often a large quantity of food, while socializing with audiences [23]) are rapidly gain\u2011 ing popularity amongAsians [24], including Chinese people [25\u201328]. Although thesemod\u2011 ern eating\u2011related habits are associatedwith obesity or unhealthy eating patterns [25,26,29], no research to date has examined these phenomena through the addiction\u2011like eating ap\u2011 proach. To address this missing link, the second objective of the present study was to ex\u2011 plore the associations between addiction\u2011like eating and these threemodern eating\u2011related habits (i.e., eating late at night, ordering delivery food and watching mukbang). In sum, the present study was the first to utilize the addiction\u2011like eating approach to better understand addictive behaviors related to food and eating in the Chinese context with two objectives; the first was to provide a valid, reliable assessment tool to evaluate addiction\u2011like eating among Chinese adults to shed light on new perspectives on weight management and healthy eating. Specifically, our aim was to explore whether our data could support the conceptualized two\u2011factor model of AEBS with adequate internal con\u2011 sistency as discovered in previous studies [19\u201321]. For indicators of convergent validity, we selected food addiction, marked distress regarding binge eating and perceived weight status, based on their consistent, positive associations with either addiction\u2011like eating or addictive behaviors related to food and eating in general [8,30,31]. To achieve the second objective, we strived to investigate the potential impact of modern eating\u2011related habits on addiction\u2011like eating and anticipated discovering positive correlations between the two as indicated by extant studies [25,26,29]. We envisaged that the findings could further our knowledge of the implications of modern eating habits and inform the design of timely, cost\u2011effective preventive strategies for unhealthy eating."

            "text": "From late 2021 to early 2022, we conducted a telephone survey using a two\u2011stage cluster random sampling method and obtained a probability sample of 1010 community\u2011 dwelling Chinese adults (55.2% female; age: 18\u201388 years,M = 38.52, SD = 14.53) in Macao, China. Participants were considered eligible if they were local Chinese residents aged 18 years or above with adequate language proficiency to understand and speak Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese. Only those who gave informed consent to voluntarily participate without monetary incentives received our survey, which was anonymous and conducted by trained research assistants. According to the recommendation of an ideal size\u2011to\u2011parameter ratio of 20:1 in structure equation models [33], the sample size of our study was sufficient to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis. No potential sources of bias were needed to address regarding sampling. According to the calculation formula proposed by the American Association for Public Opinion Research [34], the response rate was 85.5%, which represents the proportion of the respondents who completed the sur\u2011 vey out of the total respondents with known eligibility who were contacted. Prior ethics approval for this study was acquired from the corresponding author\u2019s affiliated university.\n2.2. Measures 2.2.1. Addiction\u2011like Eating\nThe 15\u2011item, two\u2011factor AEBS [8] was used to capture respondents\u2019 addiction\u2011like eat\u2011 ing in the past 12 months on a 5\u2011point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = never to 5 = always. The original English items were first translated into Chinese by two bilingual psychologists ac\u2011 cording to standardized forward\u2013backward translation procedures [35] and with further consultationwith a professional nutritionist. Additional item refinements were performed based on the pilot testing results (n = 5; 60% female; aged 23 to 52 years) to improve com\u2011 prehensibility in the Chinese context. For example, we modified \u201cI don\u2019t eat a lot of high fat/sugar foods\u201d into \u201cI eat a lot of high fat/sugar foods\u201d to avoid the potentially confus\u2011 ing double\u2011negation associated with the frequency response of 1 = never to 5 = always (see Appendix A for the final Chinese version of AEBS). A composite sum score was computed for AEBS total to compare the overall level of addiction\u2011like eating in the present study with those reported in previous studies. The composite mean scores of the two AEBS com\u2011 ponents were further calculated to evaluate the risks for appetitive drive and low dietary control among Chinese adults. A higher composite score represented a higher level of addiction\u2011like eating.\n2.2.2. Food Addiction We used Zhang et al.\u2019s [15] Chinese version of themodified YFAS 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0) [11], which contains 11 items reflecting one\u2019s food addiction symptoms. The scale was used to assess respondents\u2019 food\u2011related addictive symptoms (e.g., \u201cEating the same amount of food did not giveme asmuch enjoyment as it used to.\u201d); respondents rated their agreement with items on an 8\u2011point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = never to 7 = every day during the past 12 months. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha of the mYFAS 2.0 symptom items was 0.87 in the present study. When scoring, each item was first recoded into a binary format with the scoring key designed by Schulte and Gearhardt [11] to informwhether each symptommet the corresponding threshold; subsequently, a total score, which represents one\u2019s symptom\ncounts from 0 to 11, was computed by summing up how many food addiction symptoms an individual presented. Higher total scores indicated a higher level of food addiction.\n2.2.3. Perceived Weight Status Similar to previous studies on Chinese adults [36], we used a single item (i.e., \u201cHow do you perceive your current weight?\u201d) to assess respondents\u2019 perceived weight status on a 5\u2011point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = underweight to 5 = overweight, with a mid\u2011point of 3 = about the right weight.\n2.2.4. Marked Distress Regarding Binge Eating Marked distress regarding binge eating was assessed by a single item (i.e., \u201cDid you feel very upset about your uncontrollable overeating or resulting weight gain?\u201d) from the eating disorder diagnostic scale (EDDS) [37]. We used the Chinese version derived from Jackson and Chen\u2019s [38] study. Participants were asked to report their levels of distress over their uncontrollable overeating or resulting weight gain in the past 12 months, on a 7\u2011point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = not at all to 6 = extremely, which was subsequently recorded into 0 = no (i.e., those who scored 0 = not at all and those who reported not hav\u2011 ing uncontrollable overeating (not applicable)) and 1 = yes (i.e., those who scored greater than 0 = not at all) to indicate the presence of marked distress regarding binge eating for data analysis.\n2.2.5. Modern Eating\u2011Related Habits The three modern eating\u2011related habits of this study\u2019s interest were evaluated with three researcher\u2011developed items that were relevant to the Chinese context. Participants were asked to report the frequencies of ordering delivery food, eating late\u2011night meals and watching mukbang, respectively, in the past 12 months on a 5\u2011point Likert scale, in which 1 = never and 5 = always.\n2.2.6. Demographic Information Participants were also asked about their sex and age in the telephone survey."

Each AEBS item re\u2011 tained in the final model was expected to be significantly accounted for by its latent parent factor and with a standardized factor loading of\u22650.30 [41]. Once the measurement model of AEBS was confirmed, we further tested the measurement invariance of AEBS across both sexes with multigroup CFA at the configural, metric and scalar levels. At each level, sex invariance was indicated if \u2206CFI \u2264 0.01 and RMSEA < 0.015 [42]. All the CFAs were conducted in Mplus 8.3 [43] utilizing the robust maximum likelihood estimation (MLR) to handle missing values without assuming multivariate normality. The remaining analyses were performed in SPSS 26.0 [44]. AEBS\u2019s convergent va\u2011 lidity was examined by its associations with selected indicators through bivariate corre\u2011 lational analysis. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach\u2019s alpha (i.e., >0.70 as acceptable) [45]. We also explored and compared the associations betweenAEBS and three eating\u2011related habits with bivariate correlations and hierarchical regression analyses."

The en\u2011 dorsement rate in Table 1 shows that 0.7% to 19.6% of Chinese adults in the present sample reported \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d engaging in various addiction\u2011like eating behaviors during the past 12 months. When comparing the two addiction\u2011like eating components, Chinese adults in our sample endorsed higher rates of low dietary control behaviors (3.9\u201319.6%) than appetitive drive behaviors (0.7\u20138.2%) overall. Regarding low dietary con\u2011 trol, the two most endorsed addition\u2011like eating behaviors were being \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d \u201ceasily able to make healthy food choices\u201d (Item 6; 19.6%) and \u201cmaintaining a healthy diet\u201d (Item 13; 14.8%). In appetitive drive, the two most highly endorsed items (always or of\u2011 ten) were \u201cfind(ing) it difficult to limit what/how much I eat\u201d (Item 3; 8.2%) and \u201cfeel(ing) unable to control my weight\u201d (Item 15; 6.7%). Among the 1010 participants, 868 participants (85.9%) reported ordering delivery food, with 692 (68.5%) reporting eating late\u2011night meals and 407 (40.6%) having watched mukbang in the past 12 months. The results of bivariate correlations suggested that AEBS and its two subscales were significantly correlated with the three eating\u2011related habits, with a small effect size for ordering delivery food (r = 0.11 to 0.26, p < 0.001) and watching mukbang (r = 0.17 to 0.19, p < 0.001) and a moderate effect size for eating late\u2011night meals (r = 0.32 to 0.43, p < 0.001). As shown in Table 3, when these three eating\u2011related habits were being controlled for simultaneously, both eating late\u2011night meals and watching mukbang (p < 0.001), but not ordering delivery food (p > 0.05), were significantly associated with AEBS total score (\u2206R2 = 0.190, p < 0.001) and appetitive drive score (\u2206R2 = 0.121, p < 0.001); in contrast, all three eating\u2011related habits (p < 0.05) were positively related to low dietary control scores (\u2206R2 = 0.195, p < 0.001)."

            "text": "Responding to the growing body of literature pertaining to problematic control of weight and eating in China, the present study employed a promising but under\u2011researched approach, addiction\u2011like eating, to gain a better understanding of addictive behaviors re\u2011 lated to food and eating through two objectives. Regarding our first objective, to facilitate the assessment of addiction\u2011like eating in the Chinese context, our psychometric evalua\u2011 tions showed that AEBS provides a reliable and valid assessment of addiction\u2011like eating amongChinese adults. Specifically, we replicated the conceptual two\u2011factor structure from Ruddock et al.\u2019s original research [8]; namely, the two components of appetitive drive and low dietary control and our data showed a satisfactory model fit and adequate standard\u2011 ized factor loadings. Our findingwas consistentwith research validating theAEBS in other countries (e.g., Canada and Turkey) [19,21] and provides additional support for the cross\u2011 cultural applicability of the addiction\u2011like eating approach. We also found measurement invariance across sex at the scalar level for this two\u2011factor structure, which offers the first piece of information regarding the construct consistency of AEBS between sex groups. Sat\u2011 isfactory internal consistency was found for AEBS as a whole and its two subscales, which is consistent with previous studies [8,19]. The good convergent validity of AEBS was evi\u2011 denced by significant, positive correlationswith food addiction, marked distress regarding binge eating and perceivedweight status, which is in line with previous literature [8,30,31]. When applying the AEBS to evaluate overall addiction\u2011like eating levels in the Chi\u2011 nese context, we found that Chinese adults might be at a relatively lower risk for addiction\u2011 like eating (M = 25.65, SD = 7.97) than adults in the UK (M = 41.41, SD = 9.83) [8], Canada (M = 36.35, SD = 10.25) [19], Turkey (M = 40.43, SD = 8.35) [21] and Brazil (M = 41.19, SD = 10.93) [20]. Nevertheless, our finding regarding higher levels of low dietary control than appetitive drive was consistently observed across all studies, suggesting that more attention must be paid to dietary interventions. In parallel to this finding, our results of endorsement rates also revealed that having difficulties maintaining a healthy diet and making healthy food choices were the two most frequent addiction\u2011like eating symptoms reported by Chinese adults. In fact, lifestyle dietary interventions, such as reduced\u2011calorie diets, are already considered to be first\u2011line interventions for obesity according to the latest Chinese nutrition experts\u2019 consensus, albeit that more empirical evidence is needed to ex\u2011 amine the long\u2011term effectiveness of these types of interventions [46]. Taken together, we recommend that future studies empirically evaluate the effects of lifestyle dietary interven\u2011 tions for preventing addictive behaviors related to food and eating, as well as for weight problems in the long run. Drawing from the measurement invariance of AEBS across sex, we further discov\u2011 ered that male participants reported significantly higher levels of addiction\u2011like eating as a whole and lower dietary control than female participants. Although previous studies have not reported significant sex differences in addiction\u2011like eating, we could not fully\nrule out the possibility that the nonsignificant sex difference in the UK and Brazil was partly due to a disproportionate sex composition in the sample (i.e., 86% female) [8] or rel\u2011 atively small sample size (N = 150) [20]. Thus, we call for more research to be conducted with sufficiently large samples that reflect equal sex representation in order to further ex\u2011 amine sex differences in addiction\u2011like eating cross\u2011culturally for its potential application on sex\u2011specific intervention designs. Regarding our second objective, as expected, we uncovered significant, positive asso\u2011 ciations (via bivariate correlations) between modern eating\u2011related habits and addiction\u2011 like eating, which extends previous research findings that show similar associations be\u2011 tween these eating\u2011related habits and obesity or unhealthy eating patterns in general [25\u201327]. Of the three modern eating\u2011related habits, eating late\u2011night meals ap\u2011 peared to exert the strongest influence on addiction\u2011like eating (i.e., moderate correlation), whereas the other two habits of ordering delivery food and watching mukbang (i.e., mild correlation) exerted amilder influence. Considering the high percentage (i.e., 40.6 to 85.9%) of our respondents who reported engaging in these habits during the past 12 months, we recommend psychoeducational campaigns among the public on the heightened risk for addiction\u2011like eating due to these eating\u2011related habits, especially with respect to eating late\u2011nightmeals. As these habits are consistently associatedwith overweight issues [47,48], regular assessment of addiction\u2011like eating is also warranted for those who practice these habits frequently; such assessments might have a tempering effect on the growing popu\u2011 lation suffering from obesity or being overweight in China. When the three eating\u2011related habits were taken into account simultaneously in re\u2011 gressions, we consistently observed that themost salient impact on addiction\u2011like eating as a whole, as well as on low dietary control and appetitive drive, was from eating late\u2011night meals, followed by watching mukbang, In contrast, the impact of ordering delivery food was found to have significance only on low dietary control, but not on addiction\u2011like eating as a whole or appetitive drive, after controlling for the other two habits. Taken together, if the resources for interventions are limited, we advise stakeholders to prioritize targeting the habits of eating late\u2011night meals and watching mukbang. Given their recent increasing popularity [49], especially among young populations of adolescents [50] and university students [51], smartphone applications related to food could be utilized as a platform to provide easily accessible information on dietary control and healthy food choices to those who order late\u2011night meals and watch mukbang through smartphone applications. Our study has several limitations worth noting. First, the cross\u2011sectional design used in the present study could not assess the temporal variations of addiction\u2011like eating among Chinese adults, nor provide additional information on AEBS\u2019s test\u2011retest reliability or pre\u2011 dictive validity. We recommend that future researchers adopt a longitudinal research de\u2011 sign to address these limitations. Second, although our probability sample is able to render sufficient power tomake generalizations, a telephone survey designmay lower the general\u2011 izability due to its disadvantages including physical/language requirements (e.g., normal hearing), limited calling time (i.e., 6 pm to 10 pm onweekdays, 2 pm to 10 pm onweekends in this study) and available telephone numbers (e.g., based on Macao residential phone\u2011 book in this study). Additionally, our findings can only be used to understand the general community\u2011dwelling Chinese adults, not younger individuals or clinically obese popula\u2011 tions. Future studies are encouraged to extend the assessment of addiction\u2011like eating to more diversified populations in the Chinese context in order to establish a norm for AEBS and identify its optimal cutoff point for identifying those who are prone to addiction\u2011like eating. Third, we only explored three types of modern eating\u2011related habits in the cur\u2011 rent study as an initial attempt. Subsequent research may include other emerging mod\u2011 ern eating\u2011related habits to facilitate early detection of other risk factors associated with addiction\u2011like eating in modern times."

Based on a probability adult sample, we not only offered a reliable and valid assessment tool, the Chinese version of AEBS, to evaluate addiction\u2011like eating among Chinese adults from the two aspects of low dietary control and appetitive drive but also laid the empirical foundation of the dual\u2011process model for subsequent research, to further study addictive behaviors related to food and eating with the addiction\u2011like eat\u2011 ing approach in China. Moreover, our findings also highlighted the correlations between modern eating\u2011related habits and addiction\u2011like eating and further investigation on the biopsychosocial mechanism(s) underlying such correlations must be conducted for amore holistic understanding of (un)healthy eating patterns. Our findings on addiction\u2011like eating among Chinese adults also provide some practi\u2011 cal implications. For instance, the significant relationships betweenmodern eating\u2011related habits and addiction\u2011like eating indicated emerging risks for the adversity associated with food and eating in the contemporary world and shed light on new directions for early identification and intervention of problematic eating. Given the potential of researching addiction\u2011like eating to informdesigns targeting problems associatedwith food and eating, we recommend further application of AEBS to track addiction\u2011like eating in the Chinese context and evaluate its risks and associated consequences over time. Furthermore, we advocate for the design of tailored psychoeducational programs for individuals who regu\u2011 larly engage in these problematic modern eating\u2011related habits and for stakeholders who provide food\u2011related service (e.g., smartphone\u2011based delivery food applications) in order to lower the risks of individuals developing addictive behaviors related to food and eating, as well as weight problems among the general public. We further recommend the promo\u2011 tion of lifestyle dietary interventions for at\u2011risk populations with low dietary control.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu14224836/s1, Table S1: STROBE Statement\u2014checklists of items that should be included in reports of observational studies.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.L., J.H.C. and A.M.S.W.; Methodology, H.L.; Formal analysis, H.L.; Investigation, J.H.C. and L.D.; Writing\u2014original draft, H.L.; Writing\u2014review and editing, H.L., J.H.C., K.K.T. andA.M.S.W.; Supervision, A.M.S.W.; Project administration, J.H.C. and K.K.T.; Funding acquisition, K.K.T. and A.M.S.W.
