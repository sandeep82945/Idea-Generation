However, how to\nmobilize the learning enthusiasm of nursing students and reduce the incidence\nof academic procrastination is an important factor to reduce nursing loss and\nimprove nursing quality.\nObjectives: To investigate the influence of maladaptive perfectionism, resilience and coping style on academic procrastination among Chinese\nundergraduate nursing students.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A convenience sampling method was used to select 665 nursing undergraduates from March to\nMay 2022\u00a0 in China. Maladaptive perfectionism, coping style, resilience,\nand academic procrastination were measured using questionnaires. The\ndescriptive analysis, Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis and the Hayes\u2019 PROCESS\nMacro in SPSS 25.0 were used to test the model.\nResults: The results showed that nursing undergraduates\u2019 maladaptive perfectionism, resilience, positive coping style and academic procrastination\nwere significantly correlated between every two variables, with coefficients ranging between \u22120.290 and 0.584. In addition, resilience played a partial mediating role in maladaptive perfectionism and academic procrastination,\naccounting for 15.70% of the total effect; in the meantime, this process was\nmoderated by positive coping style.\nConclusion: Maladaptive perfectionism positively predicted nursing undergraduates\u2019 academic procrastination; as a mediating mechanism\nwith moderating, resilience and positive coping style further explained how\nmaladaptive perfectionism promoted the academic procrastination of nursing\nundergraduates. Understanding this mechanism is of great significance for\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 20 October 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1014951"

Therefore, there is an urgent need for us to train more nursing students. However, many nursing students do not consider nursing an interesting major for various reasons (Larsen et\u00a0al., 2012; Sela-Vilensky et\u00a0al., 2020). This leads to higher dropout rates and prevents us from producing more professional and enthusiastic nurses (Bakker et\u00a0al., 2019). In this case, reducing the incidence of academic procrastination (AP) is considered to be\u00a0one of the effective ways to reduce nursing student attrition (Guo et\u00a0 al., 2019). Procrastination refers to the non-adaptive behavior that people involuntarily postpone a predetermined plan without a clear reason (Kandemir, 2014). AP is a form of procrastination in school situations and is related to the fulfilment of studying tasks. Some researchers interpreted AP as emotional discomfort experienced by individuals who delay embarking on a task that must eventually be\u00a0completed (Lay and Schouwenburg, 1993). AP is common among medical college students, with about 13.8 to 49.9% of medical students reporting procrastination on learning tasks (Madhan et\u00a0al., 2012; Mortazavi et\u00a0al., 2015). AP will not only lead to a decline in school achievement, but also have a negative impact on college students\u2019 learning attitude (Kim and Seo, 2015; Balkis and Duru, 2016). In addition, college students with AP are at higher risk of negative emotions such as depression and anxiety (Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Martin\u010dekov\u00e1 and Enright, 2020). what is worse, it even has a higher risk of taking their own life (Klibert et\u00a0al., 2011; Flett et\u00a0al., 2016). As a result, reducing the incidence of AP among nursing students is essential for consolidating the nursing force. Although there have been previous international studies on the AP of nursing students, few of these have involved Chinese nursing undergraduates (Custer, 2018; Guo et\u00a0al., 2019). In China, nursing undergraduates are playing an increasingly important role in nursing education (Fu et\u00a0al., 2022). Data from China show that nurses with advanced diplomas or bachelor\u2019s degrees are the most needed workforce at all levels of health care and in the primary care sector (Wang et\u00a0al., 2016; Fu et\u00a0al., 2022). The undergraduate stage is the key stage for the formation of professional concept, value and professional ability of nursing students (Gao et\u00a0al., 2022). In view of the above considerations, it is essential to investigate the risk factors and the\nmechanisms associated with AP among Chinese nursing undergraduates, which may offer significative guidance for future education."

            "text": "Cognition and Behavior Theory (CBT) indicates that individual behavior is largely influenced by cognition, and studies have shown that procrastination is closely related to irrational worry and self-criticism (Knaus, 1973). Procrastinators often feel less confident in their ability to complete tasks, and thus delay the start of tasks (Knaus, 1973). Perfectionism is a tendency to pursue perfection in everything, and it is a personality trait that has an important influence on people\u2019s emotions and behaviors (Frost et\u00a0al., 1990; Pishghadam and Akhondpoor, 2011). Current research finds that perfectionism is a multidimensional structure, which has both positive aspects, called adaptive perfectionism and negative aspects, called maladaptive perfectionism (MP; Egan et\u00a0 al., 2011). MP refers to the tendency of critical self-evaluation and worry about others\u2019 expectations and comments (Frost et\u00a0al., 1990). Previous studies have shown that the proportion of perfectionists among nursing students in China is high, and more than one half of nursing students can be\u00a0 classified as perfectionists (Cheng and Liu, 2017). Studies have indicated that MP is associated with eating disorders, obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorders, depression, learner anxiety and suicidal ideation (Pishghadam and Akhondpoor, 2011; Kiamanesh et\u00a0al., 2015; Jing and Jianing, 2018; Dorevitch et\u00a0al., 2020). Research on the association between MP and procrastination has found that MP was significantly predictive of procrastination. Ferrari\u2019s study of both procrastinators and non-procrastinators found that procrastinators reported more MP (Ferrari et\u00a0al., 1992). Later, Frost et\u00a0al. (1993) investigated the association between perfectionism and procrastination. They found that concern over mistakes was significantly correlated with attitude toward procrastination and parental expectations and criticism were significantly correlated with frequency of procrastination (Frost et\u00a0al., 1993). Previous studies have documented a link between MP and procrastination among college students (Chi et\u00a0 al., 2012; Chen et\u00a0al., 2013). However, results on the extent to which MP affect the AP of nursing undergraduates in mainland China are still lacking. Given that nursing undergraduates are an\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nimportant part of the future nursing force in China, it is essential to investigate the association between MP and AP.\nResilience was defined as \u201can individual\u2019s behavioral tendency to adapt to changing circumstances and the ability to recover from stressful situations\u201d (Block and Kremen, 1996). According to the Resiliency Model proposed by Richardson, resilience is not only affected by the individual\u2019s cognition and behavior, but also has a protective effect on the cognition and behavior (Richardson, 2002). Previous research has shown that as a special personality trait, there is a certain relationship between MP and self-esteem (Chen et\u00a0al., 2013), while self-esteem and resilience have a certain correlation (Chung et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, we\u00a0speculate that there is also a certain relationship between MP and resilience. In addition, the essence of AP is the fear of failure and the lack of self-regulation ability in the face of the pressure of academic tasks (Chen et\u00a0al., 2013). As a positive psychological trait, resilience can mobilize individual protective resources, help individuals cope well with adverse situations and maintain positive emotional states (Klika and Herrenkohl, 2013), so it should play a positive role in reducing AP.\nCoping is an individual\u2019s cognitive and behavioral effort to reduce the negative effects of stress, which is usually divided into positive coping style (PCS) and negative coping style(NCS) (Patterson and McCubbin, 1987). Among them, the PCS refers to the individual\u2019s problem-solving oriented, actively seeking internal and external resources, so as to construct problem-solving strategies; The NCS refers to that individuals pay more attention to their own emotional experience when facing problems and solve problems by denying, escaping and fantasizing (Patterson and McCubbin, 1987). Although resilience may have a positive effect on AP and in general, it does not affect all individuals equally. In other words, individuals with different levels of coping style may differ in the patterns of correlation among resilience and AP. According to the Stress-Diathesis Model, individual coping style has an important influence on psychology and behavior (Monroe and Simons, 1991). Researchers have found that in positive situations, protective coping styles enhance the positive psychological and behavioral effects, while NCS weaken the positive psychological and behavioral effects(Hollister-Wagner et\u00a0al., 2001; Fergus and Zimmerman, 2005). In conclusion, it can be\u00a0concluded that PCS will enhance the positive effect of resilience\non AP to some extent, while NCS will weaken the protective effect of resilience on AP."

Second, MP has a positive effect on AP, and resilience plays a partial mediating role in the relationship. In the end, our study confirms that PCS play a moderating effect in the mediating mechanism. To be\u00a0specific, the resilience of nursing students with a high level of PCS has a higher predictive effect on AP than that of nursing students with a low level of PCS.\nIn this study, the MP of undergraduate nursing students were slightly higher than the results of Zheng (2011), which may be\u00a0 related to the fact that the participants of the latter were ordinary college students, while this study was nursing students. Due to the particularity of the nursing profession and the requirements of the future occupational environment, accurate performance is an underlying principle of nursing education (Si and Lee, 2022). Nursing students are usually expected to perform all tasks perfectly. Furthermore, since every nursing practice is closely related to the quality of nursing, nursing students may experience high levels of stress due to an excessive fear of making\nmistakes, leading to highly MP. The resilience is at a medium level, which is consistent with the precious result (Wang, 2016), indicating that the participants have certain positive psychological resources, but still need to be\u00a0strengthened. In addition, the score on AP was lower than in previous study (Cho and Lee, 2022), a possible reason being that the majority of respondents in this study were female student. And studies have shown that female are less likely than male to procrastinate on academic tasks for fear of lower academic performance (Lu et\u00a0al., 2021). Finally, compared to previous study (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2021), PCS slightly scored lower and NCS scored higher, possibly because during the COVID-19 pandemic, fear of infection and death may predispose nursing students to adopt NCS (Ma et\u00a0al., 2022).\nOur study confirmed that MP is significantly positively associated with AP in nursing undergraduates, which is consistent with previous finding (Burns et\u00a0 al., 2000). Many studies have pointed out that the main reasons for individuals to delay tasks that should be\u00a0completed, knowing that such delay will have adverse consequences are irrational beliefs, such as fear of failure and evaluation anxiety (Beck et\u00a0al., 2000; Burka and Yuen, 2007). As mentioned in the introduction, maladaptive perfectionists insist on setting unrealistically high standards for themselves, believing that things are either perfect or fail. This requirement makes them often worry that they cannot complete the task, which leads to the fear of failure and indecision (Canter, 2008). These characteristics are consistent with the above-mentioned irrational beliefs that govern procrastination. People who are troubled by these irrational beliefs are more likely to have negative or even catastrophic interpretations of benign events, thereby irrationally delaying many things in life (Steel, 2007). Furthermore, according to the CBT (Knaus, 1973), individual cognition largely determines individual behavior. Therefore, only by helping nursing students develop correct cognitive beliefs can nursing students improve their behavioral performance, including reducing AP.\nThe results of this study confirmed that resilience was significantly negatively correlated with AP. This is consistent with previous finding (Ko and Chang, 2019). As a positive psychological resource, resilience has a protective effect on an individual\u2019s positive behavior (Richardson, 2002). The important reason why resilience can effectively reduce AP is that it can improve selfesteem and self-efficacy (Richardson, 2002; Warshawski, 2022), enhance psychological resistance to pressure and the temptation of short-term benefits (Rutter, 1999), so that more psychological resources can be\u00a0 devoted to learning, and thus reduce procrastination. Cleary et\u00a0 al. (2018) identified resilience as a necessary trait for nursing students to succeed in learning and practice. Therefore, for nursing educators, improving the resilience of nursing students may be\u00a0one of the important strategies to reduce AP.\nThe findings demonstrate that MP is significantly negatively associated with resilience, which is consistent with previous finding (Burns et\u00a0al., 2000). Maladaptive perfectionists tend to have higher stress levels due to fear of failure and evaluation anxiety. Consequently, there is inevitably a negative impact on\nFIGURE\u00a03 Moderating effect of positive coping style.\nTABLE\u00a03 The model of mediating effect with moderating.\nPredictive variable\nModel 1(criterion:\nAP)\nModel 2(criterion: Resilience)\nModel 3(criterion:\nAP)\n\u03b2 t \u03b2 t \u03b2 t\nGender 0.100 1.982* \u22120.113 \u22121.818 0.146 2.069*\nAge \u22120.110 \u22122.459** 0.101 1.943 \u22120.096 \u22121.135*\nMP 0.210 5.491** \u22120.114 \u22122.984* 0.134 3.763**\nResilience \u22120.181 \u22124.008**\nPCS \u22120.151 0.001**\nNCS 0.247 6.822**\nResilience \u00d7 PCS \u22120.066 \u22122.185*\nResilience \u00d7 NCS 0.046 1.427"

In addition, emotions may also be\u00a0an important reason to explain the impact of MP on resilience. As a new concept in psychology, emotioncy is considered as the blend of emotion and frequency of senses (Miri and Pishghadam, 2021; Pishghadam et\u00a0al., 2022). It means sense induced emotions can relativize cognition (Pishghadam et\u00a0al., 2016). According to emotioncy, individuals can be\u00a0exvolved (hearing and seeing sth) and involved (direct experience of Sth; Miri and Pishghadam, 2021). Individuals with high MP level may lack the sensory experiences of completing the task due to the fear of the task, which will affect their emotioncy level and then have an impact on resilience (Pishghadam et\u00a0al., 2019). If nursing educators can guide nursing students to lower MP levels and incorporate multiple senses into their educational practice, nursing students tend to experience less stress, which in turn improves resilience.\nThis study prove that the MP of nursing students not only directly affected AP, but also indirectly affected AP through the partial mediating role of resilience. In the context of nursing education, nursing students are often expected to perform all tasks flawlessly, and they are told that any mistakes can be\u00a0lifethreatening for the patient (Si and Lee, 2022). As a result, nursing students may experience chronic stress due to fear of failure and higher expectations resulting in higher levels of MP (Si and Lee, 2022). Under the long-term effects of this stress, resilience is negatively affected. At the same time, when faced with academic tasks, they are more likely to choose to procrastinate to avoid the execution of tasks. In addition, the moderating effect analysis showed that the resilience of nursing undergraduates with high PCS had a higher predictive effect on AP than that of nursing students with low PCS. This is consistent with the promotion hypothesis of the \u201cprotectiveprotective model\u201d of human development (Cohen et\u00a0al., 2014). The interaction between the two protective factors enhances each other, and the impact on the outcome variable is a \u201cicing on the cake\u201d effect (Bao et\u00a0 al., 2013). Contrary to our hypothesis, NCS did not moderate the association. One possible explanation is that resilience as a positive coping resource has positive effects on psychology and behavior, whereas NCS is more likely to have negative effects. When the two positive and negative effects coexist, they may cancel each other out, resulting in an insignificant moderating effect of NCS (He et\u00a0al., 2022).\nIn current study, on the one hand, we\u00a0demonstrated \u2018how MP works. In other words, MP of nursing undergraduates not only directly affected AP, but also indirectly affected AP through the partial mediating role of resilience. On the other hand, we\u00a0investigated the when the effect is greater. Namely, the latter half of the mediating path of resilience is moderated by PCS, and the resilience of nursing undergraduates with high PCS has a greater predictive effect on AP. Therefore, the findings of this study will have a certain guiding significance and practical value for nursing educators to improve nursing undergraduates\u2019 academic procrastination."

To reduce the risk of academic procrastination, the following recommendations are made: First of all, for nursing students, it is necessary to develop good study habits and enhance the ability of time management. In the face of heavy learning tasks, nursing students should learn to scientifically disassemble the tasks, break the big tasks into a number of small tasks and complete them one by one. At the same time, through listening to music, physical exercise and other activities to properly adjust the mood, reduce the negative impact of stress. Second, for nursing educators, individual counseling or group counseling can be\u00a0 used to guide nursing students to overcome unreasonable cognitive ways in the process of nursing education practice, so that nursing students do not worry too much about mistakes and reduce the fear of failure. Moreover, from the perspective of positive psychology, nursing educators should pay more attention to the harmonious development of nursing students\u2019 mental health, encourage nursing students to actively cope with the setbacks and challenges in learning and life, so that they can obtain positive emotional experience from solving problems. Finally, for nursing education authorities, psychological experts can be\u00a0invited to regularly carry out psychological training to help nursing students build a good level of resilience, and share tips to improve their self-control ability, so as to provide a good and warm learning environment for nursing students."

Although the deviation of common methods was not found in this study, we\u00a0can still use a variety of data collection methods (such as the combination of self-report and others\u2019 report) in future studies to ensure the reliability of conclusions. Finally, the participants of this study are only from two undergraduate universities, which hinders the promotion of the conclusion to some extent.
