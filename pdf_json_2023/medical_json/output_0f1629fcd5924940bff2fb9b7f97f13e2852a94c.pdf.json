    "abstractText": "Sexual reproduction of Toxoplasma gondii, confined to the felid gut, remains largely uncharted owing to ethical concerns regarding the use of cats as model organisms. Chromatin modifiers dictate the developmental fate of the parasite during its multistage life cycle, but their targeting to stage-specific cistromes is poorly described. Here we found that the transcription factors AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 operate during the tachyzoite stage, a hallmark of acute toxoplasmosis, to silence genes necessary for merozoites, a developmental stage critical for subsequent sexual commitment and transmission to the next host, including humans. Their conditional and simultaneous depletion leads to a marked change in the transcriptional program, promoting a full transition from tachyzoites to merozoites. These in vitro-cultured pre-gametes have unique protein markers and undergo typical asexual endopolygenic division cycles. In tachyzoites, AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 bind DNA as heterodimers at merozoite promoters and recruit MORC and HDAC3 (ref. 1), thereby limiting chromatin accessibility and transcription. Consequently, the commitment to merogony stems from a profound epigenetic rewiring orchestrated by AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2. Successful production of merozoites in vitro paves the way for future studies on Toxoplasma sexual development without the need for cat infections and holds promise for the development of therapies to prevent parasite transmission.",

Hehl2, Alexandre Bougdour1, Isabelle Coppens4 & Mohamed-Ali Hakimi1 \u2709\nSexual reproduction of Toxoplasma gondii, confined to the felid gut, remains largely uncharted owing to ethical concerns regarding the use of cats as model organisms. Chromatin modifiers dictate the developmental fate of the parasite during its multistage life cycle, but their targeting to stage-specific cistromes is poorly described1,2. Here we found that the transcription factors AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 operate during the tachyzoite stage, a hallmark of acute toxoplasmosis, to silence genes necessary for merozoites, a developmental stage critical for subsequent sexual commitment and transmission to the next host, including humans. Their conditional and simultaneous depletion leads to a marked change in the transcriptional program, promoting a full transition from tachyzoites to merozoites. These in\u00a0vitro-cultured pre-gametes have unique protein markers and undergo typical asexual endopolygenic division cycles. In tachyzoites, AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 bind DNA as heterodimers at merozoite promoters and recruit MORC and HDAC3 (ref. 1), thereby limiting chromatin accessibility and transcription. Consequently, the commitment to merogony stems from a profound epigenetic rewiring orchestrated by AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2. Successful production of merozoites in\u00a0vitro paves the way for future studies on Toxoplasma sexual development without the need for cat infections and holds promise for the development of therapies to prevent parasite transmission.\nToxoplasma, the cause of the global zoonotic infection toxoplasmosis, presents a multifaceted life cycle with distinctive stages (Fig.\u00a01a). Much is understood about its fast-growing tachyzoites and semi-dormant bradyzoites, but its sexual reproduction, confined to felid guts, is less explored. Each stage has a distinctive transcriptional signature and switching between them is regulated by intricate transcriptional cascades in which covalent and noncovalent epigenetic mechanisms act as driving forces3,4. The chromatin modifiers MORC and HDAC3, key players in gene silencing1,2, act as critical checkpoints for sexual commitment, and when conditionally depleted or inhibited in tachyzoites, they trigger broad activation of chronic and sexual gene expression1,2. Previous studies overlooked their combined presence in nucleosomal telomeric repeats1, suggesting a secondary role in maintaining genome stability through the formation of telomeric heterochromatin (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a). MORC detachment from chromosome ends disrupts subtelomeric gene silencing (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01b), causing telomere dysfunction, mitotic bypass and aberrant polyploid zoite accumulation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01c), reminiscent of aneuploidy in human cancer5. In MORC-depleted parasites, disorganized telomeres may in turn disrupt gene-level transcriptional regulation, leading to misguided sexual development. An alternative way to explore the modus operandi of MORC involves its partners, the apetala proteins1 (AP2; Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a), which are considered important regulators of life-cycle transitions in all apicomplexan species3,6. This study underscores the role of two AP2 repressors in coordinating the expression of stage-specific genetic programs, and thus controlling Toxoplasma merogony. AP2-mediated merozoite gene silencing In the 1970s, Toxoplasma\u2019s sexual cycle was partially studied in infected kittens through meticulous examination of the ultrastructure of the pre-gametes zoites and sexual dimorphic stages in the intestinal lining of Felis catus7\u201311. Merozoites\u2014the initiators of the sexual cycle\u2014have a unique transcriptional profile12,13, but their study has been difficult owing to the lack of specific markers. The only recognized marker so far, GRA11b, is used to track the development of this stage in the gut of Toxoplasma-infected cats14 (Fig.\u00a01b). For a more in-depth exploration of merogony, we identified three potential merozoite-specific proteins with gene expression profiles mirroring those of GRA11b and produced matching antibodies. Notably, antibodies to TGME49_273980 showed robust reactivity with feline merozoites (Fig.\u00a01b), but not with tachyzoites or bradyzoites, whether converted in\u00a0vitro by overexpressing BFD1 (ref. 15) or present in tissue cysts in mouse brain (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02b,c).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06821-y\nReceived: 18 January 2023\nAccepted: 1 November 2023"

These form oocysts that sporulate in an oxygen-rich environment. After ingestion, released sporozoites develop into tachyzoites causing acute infection.

            "text": "accumulates in the vacuolar space after MORC depletion1 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02d). Another protein, GRA82 (TGME49_277230), co-occurs with GRA11b in in\u00a0vivo schizonts specifically (Extended Data Figs.\u00a02e and 3d).\nUsing these new markers, we investigated which MORC- and HDAC3-associated AP2 is responsible for repressing merozoite-specific gene expression in tachyzoites. In a CRISPR loss-of-function screen, inactivation of only AP2XI-2 or AP2XII-1 among the 14 MORC-associated AP2 proteins resulted in a significant increase in the expression level of GRA11b, GRA80 and GRA81\u2013HA to varying degrees (Fig.\u00a01c\u2013e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02f). This suggests a common or overlapping role of these two transcription factors. To examine the genetic relationship between AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1, we knocked out both genes simultaneously and observed a synergistic increase in the expression level of all three merozoite markers that exceeded threefold the levels observed in the individual knockouts (Fig.\u00a01c\u2013e). By contrast, MORC knockout led to only a low level of expression of GRA81\u2013HA (Fig.\u00a01e). AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 are essential for tachyzoite proliferation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a), hindering the study of merogony with knockouts. To investigate this further, we used the minimal auxin-inducible degron system (mAID; Supplementary Table\u00a01) and transiently knocked down each AP2 factor individually or simultaneously (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02g). Single knockdowns (KDs) of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 had limited effects on merozoite marker expression, as less than 25% of vacuoles were co-labelled with GRA11b and GRA80 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03b). However, simultaneous KD resulted in efficient merozoite differentiation with more than 98% of vacuoles showing both markers after 48 h (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a,b). By contrast, MORC-depleted vacuoles did not exhibit a significant level of coexpression of GRA11b and GRA80 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03b). Additionally, KD of three genes encoding other MORC-associated AP2 proteins (AP2VII-3a, AP2VIII-4 and AP2VIII-7) failed to induce merozoite marker expression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c).\nNotably, GRA82 showed delayed but significant coexpression with GRA11b in 98% of vacuoles depleted of both AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2, 48 h after 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA) addition. This suggests a potential temporal regulation or association with a specific merozoite morphotype (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d,e). The in\u00a0vitro pre-sexual parasite population that emerged following the acute depletion of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 is homogeneous and does not express the typical markers of tachyzoites (for example, GRA2; Extended Data Fig.\u00a03f,g) and bradyzoites (for example, BCLA (ref. 1), BAG1 and DBA; Extended Data Fig.\u00a03h\u2013j). In comparison, accumulation of Shield-protected BFD1 (ref. 15) induced bradyzoite differentiation in more than 95% of parasites (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03h\u2013j), without the expression of merozoite markers (Extended Data Figs.\u00a02b and 3b). In contrast to the AP2 double-KD mutant, MORC-depleted parasites showed asynchronous development1 with vacuoles expressing either bradyzoite (BCLA+) or merozoite (GRA81+) markers in a mutually exclusive manner (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03k).\nTo gain a more complete understanding of in\u00a0vitro merozoite differentiation beyond the limited perspective offered by GRA11b and GRA80 co-staining, we carried out RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on all KD strains to investigate genome-wide transcriptional changes resulting from individual or simultaneous depletion of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1. Analysing the RNA-seq data using DESeq2, we identified 490 differentially expressed transcripts (fold change (FC) threshold of \u22658 and P value < 0.05), including 295 upregulated genes and 195 downregulated genes when both AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 were depleted (Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Table\u00a02).\nHierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the co-depletion of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 resulted in gene expression profiles reminiscent of those observed in\u00a0vivo in enteroepithelial stages (EESs)12,13,16. Their acute degradation triggered the induction of pre-gamete-specific genes at different developmental stages (clusters 1 and 2), while concurrently repressing a subset of tachyzoite-specific genes (clusters 3 and 4; Fig.\u00a01f). These transcriptional changes mirror the gene expression profile observed in merozoites in the cat intestine12,13. Using principal component analysis, we observed consistent clustering of biological\nreplicates within each treatment, indicating excellent reproducibility. In addition, the samples showed substantial clustering based on genetic background with significant separation between single-KD and double-KD samples (PC1 = 58%), suggesting synergistic regulation of gene expression by AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 in Toxoplasma (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a). DESeq2 analysis revealed that depletion of both AP2 factors was found to be necessary to upregulate 65% (194/295) of the identified genes (FC \u2265 8; P value < 0.05; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04b). By contrast, single KDs of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 resulted in expression of a lower proportion of genes, 9% and 13.5%, respectively (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04b). This transcriptional trend also extends to tachyzoite-specific genes, whose repression is quantitatively more pronounced when AP2 proteins are simultaneously depleted (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c).\nChanges in mRNA levels in response to IAA treatment translated into changes in protein abundance. Principal component analysis showed consistent clustering of biological replicates within each condition, indicating high reproducibility (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04d). Proteomic analysis revealed robust changes in 18% of the parasite proteins (n = 3,020 detected; log2[FC] \u2265 1; P value \u2264 0.01), with a highly polarized response to the merozoite stage. IAA-treated parasites exhibited increased expression levels of 276 proteins associated with pre-gamete stages, whereas 285 tachyzoite proteins were suppressed (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04e and Supplementary Table\u00a03). Overall, the RNA and protein expression patterns of in\u00a0vitro merozoites mirrored those observed in their enteroepithelial counterparts12,13.\nAP2 depletion causes stage conversion The process of invasion of Toxoplasma tachyzoites has been thoroughly examined, revealing the cryptic functions of organelle-resident proteins17. Micronemes secrete adhesin proteins (MICs) for attachment, facilitating motility and invasion. Rhoptries release neck (RON) and bulb (ROP) proteins, which interact with MICs to breach the host cell membrane and form the parasitophorous vacuole. Dense granules (GRA) release proteins involved in intravacuolar function, such as the tubulovesicular network, and act as effectors at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and beyond, manipulating host signalling18. Most MIC, ROP and GRA proteins secreted by tachyzoites and bradyzoites are absent in merozoites isolated from cats12,13,19,20. In\u00a0vitro, we also observed substantial changes in the expression of many known MIC, ROP and GRA proteins after the addition of IAA, providing evidence for a developmental switch (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c and Supplementary Table\u00a02). Specifically, MIC complexes that play important roles in tachyzoites (for example, MIC2 and AMA1) were repressed, whereas merozoite- and bradyzoite-specific MICs (for example, MIC17a, MIC17b, MIC17c and AMA2) were markedly induced. Notably, the reassortment of organelle-resident proteins seems to be highly specific, as MICs restricted to sporozoites (SporoAMA1) were not induced in response to IAA (Fig.\u00a02a).\nThe combined depletion of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 silenced 80% of the 143 rhoptry proteins described or predicted by hyperLOPIT to be tachyzoite specific (Fig.\u00a02b). These include the components of the tachyzoite complex of RON2, RON4, RON5 and RON8 as well as ROP16, ROP18 and ROP5, which function as effectors to protect parasites from host cell-autonomous immune defences18. The number of ROP proteins reported to be exclusively specific to pre-gametes is rather limited (Fig.\u00a02b). Among them, BRP1 stands out as the first protein described to be expressed in both merozoites and bradyzoites21 (Fig.\u00a02d).

These proteins, present in both stages, may facilitate the transition process from bradyzoites to merozoites.\nWhen we examined GRA mRNA and protein levels in response to IAA treatment, we observed extensive and comparable shutdown of the tachyzoite program and activation of the merozoite program (Fig.\u00a02c).

            "text": "including the GRA2 archetype, declined significantly in in\u00a0vitro merozoites over time (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03f,g). The MYR-dependent effectors GRA16, GRA24 or TgIST also showed a comparable decrease (Fig.\u00a02c). By contrast, confirmed GRA markers of pre-gametes (for example, GRA11b (ref. 14), GRA80, GRA81 and GRA82) were induced in response to IAA (Fig.\u00a02c,d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a,b,d,e).\nDuring the transition from tachyzoite to merozoite, surface proteins on the zoite also undergo significant restructuring, including the SAG-related surface (SRS) protein family12,13. Compared to tachyzoites, merozoites express a broader range of SRS proteins (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04g)\u2014for example, SRS48 (Fig.\u00a02d) and SRS59\u2014which may contribute to gamete development and fertilization12,13. IAA treatment induces the expression of 90% of the known 88 SRS proteins, effectively mimicking the phenotypic features of in\u00a0vivo merozoites, whereas suppressing tachyzoite-specific SRS proteins (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04g). In addition, 29 of the 33 family A members, representing the major membrane-associated merozoite proteins, are expressed in\u00a0vitro during this transition to pre-gametes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04h).\nIn\u00a0vitro-produced merozoites are deficient in essential proteins necessary for tachyzoite functions, including motility, attachment and invasion. As a result, these zoites exhibited reduced infectivity in human fibroblasts, as indicated by a notable decrease in the number of lytic plaques compared to that of untreated parasites (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a).\nAP2-depleted zoites undergo merogony In 1972, Dubey and Frenkel characterized pre-sexual stages at the cellular level and identified five morphological stages (A\u2013E) that form sequentially during colonization of the cat intestinal epithelium before gamete formation22 (Fig.\u00a01a). These morphotypes can be differentiated on the basis of their distinct subcellular structures and nuclear content23. Using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, we tracked the development of these stages during in\u00a0vitro merogony, including the dynamic behaviour of the inner membrane complex (IMC), a unique organelle essential for daughter cell formation during replication. During development in the cat intestine, the functions of various IMC proteins diverge from their assigned roles in tachyzoites23. For example, at the later stages of schizogony, IMC1 and IMC3 staining revealed daughter IMC, whereas IMC7 staining was restricted to the periphery of the mother cell23. In agreement with these findings, our results show that IMC1 but also GAP45 are valuable markers for tracking merozoite division during their development in the intestinal mucosa of cats (Fig.\u00a02e,f).\nAs a first step, 24 h post-IAA addition, the nucleus of the mother cell undergoes several fission\u00a0events while maintaining the nuclear envelope, leading to individualized nuclei (in even numbers, ranging from 4 up to 10; Fig.\u00a03a). Concomitantly, single organelles such as the apicoplast and the Golgi apparatus expand and multiply to match the number of nuclei. Transversal cross-sections of the apicoplast (limited by four membranes) reveal its elongation and constriction, suggestive of replication by scission (Fig.\u00a03b), which was also visualized by IFA with the ATrx1 antibody24 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05b) and is in line with maternal inheritance of the apicoplast seen in meronts in the cat intestine25. Multiple Golgi complexes are formed at different sites of the nucleus, sometimes in opposing orientations, suggestive of de\u00a0novo formation (Fig.\u00a03c). The manner in which other organelles, such as secretory organelles, multiply is not yet known. At this stage, the multinucleated mother cell contains several sets of organelles randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Despite the increase in size of the mother cell, the subpellicular IMC is still prominently present beneath the plasma membrane. The parasites exhibiting a characteristic ovoid shape with four and eight nuclei are morphologically related to the cryptic and early meronts, namely B and C morphotypes22 (Fig.\u00a03d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05c).\nAs a second step, new flattened vesicles of the IMC emerge in the mother cytoplasm, and progressively elongate allowing the sub-compartmentalization of organelles destined for each daughter cell (Fig.\u00a03e). This process of internal budding of more than two daughter cells, referred to here as endopolygeny26\u201330, differs from the tachyzoite division by endodyogeny in which the two daughter cells are generated symmetrically and in a synchronous manner in the mother cell (Fig.\u00a03f). Alongside the expansion of daughter buds, the mother IMC and conoid undergo partial disassembly. Notably, rhoptries inside daughter cells are different in shape and electron density from mother rhoptries dispersed in the cytoplasm, suggesting de\u00a0novo biogenesis of rhoptries (Fig.\u00a03g), which can also be traced with ROP26 (Fig.\u00a03h). This finding aligns with the observation that the bulbous end of the rhoptry in in\u00a0vivo meronts remains spherical, in contrast to that in tachyzoites and bradyzoites31.\nIn these multinucleated structures, daughter IMC could be identified with IMC1 staining, whereas GAP45 staining was restricted to the periphery of the mother cell (Fig.\u00a03i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05d). Daughter cells become polarized with the formation of a conoid and apical distribution of micronemes, rhoptries, the apicoplast, and the Golgi apparatus (Fig.\u00a04a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e). At this stage, it is evident that the maternal conoid coexists with the newly formed conoids of the progeny, as shown by the labelling of apically methylated proteins (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05f). After final assembly, the daughter cells emerge separately, wrapped by the plasma membrane of the mother cell (cortical or peripheral budding; Fig.\u00a04b,c), forming fan-like structures as previously described in infected cat cells26. Compared to tachyzoites, these newly formed parasites are thinner and do not form a rosette-like structure within the parasitophorous vacuole but instead are aligned, with their apex facing the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05g,h); these features are reminiscent of those of type-D-like merozoites arising in cat intestinal cells from meront entities at the onset of infection28\u201330. Notably, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of merozoites also forms physical interactions with host ER and mitochondria, potentially for nutrient acquisition32 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05h)."

            "text": "Extending the IAA treatment for another 16 h reveals the presence of very large meronts containing numerous daughter cells in formation (Fig.\u00a04d,e). These schizonts are detected in the same parasitophorous vacuole together with fully formed in\u00a0vitro merozoites (Fig.\u00a04e), the latter being very similar to their counterpart in the cat intestine (Fig.\u00a02e,f). Mature polyploid meronts can be visualized by IMC7 staining on their surface, whereas fully formed merozoites were completely negative for IMC7 (Fig.\u00a03d,h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05c), a phenotype that has also been observed in pre-gametes developing in the cat gut23. Notably, new pre-merozoite or merozoite-specific markers such as ROP26 and GRA80, respectively, distinguish the two morphotypic populations. ROP26 marks zoites undergoing schizogonic replication, whereas GRA11b and GRA80 are expressed exclusively in mature in\u00a0vitro merozoites (Fig.\u00a03h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a). As merozoites undergo several cycles of endopolygeny, they acquire new distinct morphological features compared to first-generation merozoites (24 h post-IAA), probably type E (ref. 26). Some in\u00a0vitro merozoites are sausage shaped, with a diameter of 1.5\u20131.8 \u03bcm, packed in the parasitophorous vacuole without any spatial organization (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b,c). These forms contain similar organelles found in tachyzoites, but they exhibit an extruded conoid (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06d). Other parasitophorous vacuoles contain peripherally arranged parasites, leaving a large empty space (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06e,f), reminiscent of schizont parasitophorous vacuoles formed in cat intestinal cells26. Notably, these parasites at the parasitophorous vacuole edge adopt two configurations: a very large cell body (trapezoid) with a diameter of up\nNature | Vol 625 | 11 January 2024 | 371\nto 5 \u03bcm or a very thin and elongated shape (tubular) with a diameter of 200\u2013250 nm (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06g,h). The latter do not contain nuclei but mitochondrion profiles and ribosomes are observed. Their origin and formation remain to be determined but their abundance in parasitophorous vacuoles probably suggests a physiological relevance in the Toxoplasma life cycle.

Asynchronous nuclear division cycles were detected by DNA, histone or centrosome staining (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a\u2013d). At 12-h post-IAA treatment, a significant proportion of the tachyzoite population transitioned into morphotype B (3\u20134 nuclei and ROP26+), reaching up to 75% (Fig.\u00a04f). Within 24 h, morphotypes C and D (8\u201332 nuclei and ROP26+) and mononuclear merozoites (GRA11b+GRA80+) coexisted in culture (Fig.\u00a04f). After 48 h, nearly 98% of the parasite population expressed merozoite markers (GRA11b+ and GRA80+), whereas typical tachyzoite (GRA2) or bradyzoite (BAG1) markers were absent (Fig.\u00a04f), aligning with our extensive transcriptome and proteome analyses.

Each AP2 protein shows significant enrichment in the eluate of its corresponding counterpart (FC > 90; P value < 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221210), indicating their association within the same functional complex along with MORC and HDAC3 (Fig.\u00a05a). Notably, this interaction is specific and exclusive to these two AP2 proteins, as no such association was observed with other AP2 proteins, or with other chromatin modifiers (Supplementary Table\u00a04). HDAC3 and MORC exhibited comparatively lower levels of enrichment (FC of 8 and 14, respectively, Fig.\u00a05a), suggesting that AP2XI-2 or AP2XII-1 proteins independently form heterodimers in cellular contexts. To further test this hypothesis, we used baculoviruses to transiently coexpress epitope-tagged AP2XII-1\u2013Flag and (Strep)2\u2013AP2XI-2 in insect cells, with AP2IX-6\u2013Flag serving as an internal control (Fig.\u00a05c). AP2XII-1 was purified by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography, and the partnership between AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 was confirmed through western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a05d), whereas no co-enrichment was detected with AP2IX-6 (Fig.\u00a05e). Consistent with AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 being part of a heterodimer, our findings show these two proteins coelute in the same gel filtration fractions, in a MORC- and HDAC3-independent manner, as confirmed by MS-based proteomics (Fig.\u00a05f,g and Supplementary Table\u00a05).

In this context, AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 probably bind cooperatively as a heterodimer to DNA to selectively and synergistically repress merozoite gene expression, and only their simultaneous depletion leads to achievement of the developmental program critical for merozoite formation.\nAP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 limit chromatin access To further explore gene repression by AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP\u2013seq; GSE222819) to analyse their genome-wide distribution during conditional single or double KD. Simultaneously, we examined recruitment of their partners MORC and HDAC3 to chromatin under KD conditions. In the AP2XII-1-specific cistrome, we identified genes from cluster 2 that are exclusively expressed in pre-gametes and have a discrete and highly enriched peak centred on their transcription start site (TSS; Fig.\u00a06a,b). Examining the co-occupancy in cluster 2, we observed a strong overlap between the binding sites of AP2XI-2 or AP2XII-1 cistromes in the untreated condition (Fig.\u00a06c,d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a) with approximately 30\u201350% of the peaks located at the promoter or TSS (Fig.\u00a06e). Consistently, AP2XII-I and AP2XI-2 showed similar genome-wide occupancy when immunoprecipitated from single or double KD strains (Fig.\u00a06b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08). HDAC3 and MORC are both enriched at AP2XII-I and AP2XI-2 peaks (Fig.\u00a06c,d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08c,d). Addition of IAA triggers the acute release of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 from chromatin and a concomitant reduction in HDAC3 and MORC occupancy at the TSS at cluster 2 genes, which is more pronounced in the context of double KD (Fig.\u00a06d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a,e).\nAP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 are expected to alter chromatin compaction and accessibility, a function attributed to their partners MORC and HDAC3. To investigate this assumption, we carried out assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC\u2013seq; GSE222832), a robust and streamlined method for profiling chromatin accessibility36. At the genome level, there is a slight decrease in average accessibility between untreated and treated conditions (Fig.\u00a06f) with most of the peaks located at the TSS (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a,b). However, when we plotted ATAC\u2013seq data for the subset of downregulated and upregulated genes (as defined in Fig.\u00a01f), the changes in occupancy were more pronounced and consistent with expected increase or decrease in accessibility of induced or repressed clusters, respectively (Fig.\u00a06g,h). At the gene level, dynamic release of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 from DNA induced by IAA resulted in a substantial decrease in MORC and HDAC3 enrichment, which enhanced local chromatin hyperaccessibility and led to a concomitant increase in target gene mRNA abundance, a pattern largely shared by representative merozoite genes (Fig.\u00a06i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09c\u2013e).\nWe next examined how AP2XII-1 degradation influences AP2XI-2 binding genome-wide. Initially, depletion of AP2XII-1 did not affect the nuclear localization or signal intensity of AP2XI-2 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010a). Notably, AP2XI-2 did not dissociate from chromatin post AP2XII-1 degradation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010b), indicating its ability to form independent homodimers and repress merozoite-specific genes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010c,d). At the transcriptional level, the persistence of homodimers on chromatin explains the sustained repression of merozoite gene expression when a single AP2 is depleted, with peak expression reached only following simultaneous KD (Fig.\u00a01f and Extended Data Figs.\u00a04c and 10d).\nSecondary regulators guide merogony Some genes escaped direct regulation by AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 because they expressed increased levels of RNA and had hyperaccessible chromatin signatures after the addition of IAA but lacked the characteristic\nrecruitment of MORC and HDAC3 to their promoters in the untreated state (for example, PNP; Extended Data Fig.\u00a010e). This indirect regulation is also typical of tachyzoite genes that are repressed when AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 are depleted. They show a strong decrease in ATAC\u2013seq signals after addition of IAA, but no apparent binding of the repressive MORC complex to their TSS (Fig.\u00a06i and Extended Data Figs.\u00a010f,g and 11a).\nThis suggests that AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 operate on gene expression through an indirect mechanism that is not reliant on their DNA-binding activities or their functional partners MORC and HDAC3. This transcriptional outcome may stem from secondary transcription factors that govern the establishment of specific predetermined transcriptional programs for distinct stages1,4 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012). Supporting this hypothesis, our observations show that co-depletion of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 leads to the activation of seven AP2 transcription factors and one C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor, all of which are subject to control by MORC and HDAC3 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a011b\u2013d)."

            "text": "Simultaneous KD of AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 efficiently triggers the pre-sexual transcriptional program in Toxoplasma, outperforming other methods. This study advances our understanding of pre-gamete biology, illustrating endopolygeny with karyokinesis as the meronts\u2019 preferred division mode, similar to the case for Cystoisospora suis but distinct from that for Sarcocystis neurona29,37. All predefined morphotypes (A\u2013E), including type E expected to evolve into gametes, were observed. However, fully matured microgametocytes and macrogametocytes were not found, possibly owing to complex genetic requirements38,39 or specialized metabolic conditions40.\nConverging pieces of evidence support the hypothesis that AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 are able to form homodimers but also heterodimers to silence merozoite genes in tachyzoites by binding to their promoters and recruiting MORC and HDAC3 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012a,b). MORC in turn forms dimers that topologically entrap DNA loops41, leading to chromatin condensation that limits DNA accessibility to transcription factors and suppresses gene expression42. AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 also control the expression of secondary AP2 proteins specific to pre-gametes in the tachyzoite (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012c). Operating as downstream activators or repressors, these transcription factors have the potential to significantly influence developmental trajectories post-merogony (for example, sex determination as shown for Plasmodium falciparum38,39). Fine-tuning their activity in mature in\u00a0vitro-cultured merozoites holds promise for functional gamete production and in\u00a0vitro fertilization43."

Electroporation was carried out in a 2-mm cuvette at 1,100 V, 25 \u03a9 and 25 \u03bcF. Antibiotics (concentration) used were chloramphenicol (20 \u03bcM), mycophenolic acid (25 \u03bcg ml\u22121) with xanthine (50 \u03bcg ml\u22121), pyrimethamine (3 \u03bcM) or 5-fluorodeoxyuracil (10 \u03bcM) as needed. Stable transgenic parasites were selected with the appropriate antibiotic, cloned in 96-well plates by limiting dilution, and verified by immunofluorescence assay or genomic analysis.\nChromatographic purification of Flag-tagged proteins Toxoplasma extracts from RH\u2206ku80 or Pru\u2206ku80 cells stably expressing HA\u2013Flag-tagged AP2XII-1 or AP2XI-2 proteins, respectively, were incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Beads were washed with 10 column volumes of BC500 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% NP-40 and protease inhibitors). Bound polypeptides were eluted stepwise with 250 \u03bcg ml\u22121 Flag peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in BC100 buffer. For size-exclusion chromatography, protein eluates were loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with BC500. The flow rate was set at 0.35 ml min\u22121, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected.\nMS-based quantitative analyses of parasite proteomes and AP2 interactomes Sample preparation. For proteome-wide analyses, HFF cells were grown to confluence, infected with the RH (AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 KD) strain and treated with IAA for 24 h, 32 h and 48 h or mock-treated. Proteins were extracted using cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen). Three biological replicates were prepared and analysed for each condition. For characterization of HA\u2013Flag-tagged AP2XII-1 or AP2XI-2 interactomes, eluted proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer. Three biological replicates were prepared for each bait protein and for the negative control. Proteins were stacked in the top of a 4\u201312% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) before in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) as previously described1.\nNanoliquid chromatography coupled to MS/MS analyses. The resulting peptides were analysed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to an MS/MS instrument (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and Q-Exactive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 360-min gradient for proteome-wide analysis and a 200-min gradient for interactome characterization. For this, peptides were sampled on a 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn and separated in a 200 cm \u03bcPAC column (PharmaFluidics) or a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 250 mm C18 column (Aurora Generation 2, 1.7 \u03bcm, IonOpticks) for, respectively, proteome-wide and interactome analyses. MS and MS/MS data were acquired using Xcalibur software version 4.0 (Thermo Scientific).\nProtein identification and quantification. Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.8.0, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the T. gondii database (ME49 taxonomy, version 58 downloaded from ToxoDB), the Uniprot database (Homo sapiens taxonomy) and a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (human keratins, trypsin and so on). Trypsin was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set, respectively, at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), acetyl\n(protein amino terminus, variable) and oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software (version 2.2.0) was used for the compilation, grouping and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length \u2265 6 amino acids, false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications < 1% and minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group). Proline was then used to carry out an MS1 label-free quantification of the identified protein groups based on razor and specific peptides.\nStatistical analyses. Statistical analyses were carried out using ProStaR46. Proteins identified in the reverse and contaminant databases or matched to human sequences were discarded. For proteome-wide analyses, only proteins identified by MS/MS in a minimum of two replicates of one condition and quantified in the three replicates of one condition were conserved. After log2 transformation, abundance values were normalized using the variance-stabilizing normalization method, before missing-value imputation (structured least squares algorithm (SLSA) for partially observed values in the condition and DetQuantile algorithm for totally absent values in the condition). For comparison of each IAA-treated condition to the mock-treated condition, statistical testing was conducted with limma, whereby differentially expressed proteins were selected using a log2[FC] cutoff of 1 and a P-value cutoff of 0.01, allowing one to reach a false discovery rate inferior to 5% according to the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg estimator. Proteins found differentially abundant but identified by MS/MS in fewer than two replicates, and detected in fewer than three replicates, in the condition in which they were found to be more abundant were invalidated (P value = 1). Protein abundances measured in the four different conditions were also compared globally by ANOVA using Perseus; q values were obtained by Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction.\nFor interactome analysis, only proteins identified by MS/MS in the three replicates of one condition and proteins quantified with a minimum of five peptides were conserved. After log2 transformation, abundance values were normalized by condition-wise median centring, before missing-value imputation (SLSA algorithm for partially observed values in the condition and DetQuantile algorithm for totally absent values in the condition). Statistical testing was conducted with limma, whereby differentially expressed proteins were selected using a P-value cutoff of 0.01 and FC cutoffs of 5 and 3, respectively, for comparison of each AP2 interactome with negative control and AP2 interactomes together, allowing one to reach a false discovery rate inferior to 1% according to the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg estimator. The relative abundances of AP2-associated proteins were determined using the iBAQ metrics; only proteins with an iBAQ ratio of at least 0.1 in relation to the bait protein were considered.\nMS-based proteomic analyses of SEC fractions Protein bands were excised from colloidal blue-stained gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) as previously described1. Resulting peptides were analysed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to MS/ MS (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano and Orbitrap Exploris 480, Thermo Scientific). Peptides were sampled on a 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn and separated on a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 250 mm C18 column (Aurora Generation 2, 1.6 \u03bcm, IonOpticks) using a 25-min gradient. MS and MS/ MS data were acquired using Xcalibur version 4.0 (Thermo Scientific). Peptides and proteins were identified using Mascot (version 2.8.0) through concomitant searches against the T. gondii database (ME49 taxonomy, version 58 downloaded from ToxoDB), the Uniprot database (T. ni taxonomy) and a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (human keratins, trypsin and so on). Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set, respectively, at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: carbamidomethyl (C, fixed),\nacetyl (protein N terminus, variable) and oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software (version 2.2.0) was used for the compilation, grouping and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length \u2265 6 amino acids, false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications < 1% and minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group). iBAQ values were calculated for each protein group in Proline using MS1 intensities of specific and razor peptides.\nChIP coupled with Illumina sequencing ChIP. HFF cells were grown to confluence and infected with KD strains as indicated in the figure legends. Collected intracellular parasites were crosslinked with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) for 8 min at room temperature, and crosslinking was stopped by addition of glycine (final concentration 0.125 M) for 5 min at room temperature. The parasites were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer A (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.125% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and after centrifugation, crosslinked chromatin was sheared in buffer B (1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 8.0, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 and protease inhibitor cocktail) by sonication with a Diagenode Biorupter. Samples were sonicated for 16 cycles (30 s on and 30 s off) to achieve an average size of 200\u2013500 base pairs. Sheared chromatin, 5% BSA, a protease inhibitor cocktail, 10% Triton X-100, 10% deoxycholate, magnetic beads coated with DiaMag protein A (Diagenode) and antibodies to epitope tags (HA or MYC) or the protein of interest (MORC or HDAC3) were used for immunoprecipitation. A rabbit IgG antiserum served as a control mock. After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating wheel, chromatin\u2013 antibody complexes were washed and eluted from the beads using the iDeal ChIP\u2013seq kit for transcription factors (Diagenode) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Samples were de-crosslinked by heating for 4 h at 65 \u00b0C. DNA was purified using the IPure kit (Diagenode) and quantified using Qubit Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For ChIP\u2013seq, the purified DNA was used for library preparation and subsequently sequenced by Arraystar (USA).\nLibrary preparation, sequencing and data analysis (Arraystar). ChIP\u2013seq libraries were prepared according to the Illumina protocol \u201cPreparing Samples for ChIP Sequencing of DNA\u201d. For library preparation, 10 ng of DNA from each sample was converted to blunt-end phosphorylated DNA fragments using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow polymerase and T4 polymerase (NEB); an \u2018A\u2019 base was added to the 3\u2032 end of the blunt-end phosphorylated DNA fragments using the polymerase activity of Klenow (Exo-Minus) polymerase (NEB); Illumina genomic adapters were ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments; PCR amplification to enrich the ligated fragments was carried out using Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (Finnzymes Oy). The enriched product of about 200\u2013700 bp was excised from the gel and purified. For sequencing, the library was denatured with 0.1 M NaOH to generate single-stranded DNA molecules and loaded into flow cell channels at a concentration of 8 pM and amplified in\u00a0situ using TruSeq Rapid SR cluster kit (number GD-402-4001, Illumina). Sequencing was carried out for 100 cycles on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For data analysis, after the sequencing platform generated the sequencing images, the stages of image analysis and base calling were carried out using Off-Line Basecaller software (OLB V1.8). After passing the Solexa CHASTITY quality filter, the clean reads were aligned to the T. gondii reference genome (TGME49) using BOWTIE V2 and then converted and sorted using Bamtools. Aligned reads were used for peak calling of the ChIP-enriched peaks using MACS v2.2 with a cutoff P value of 10\u22124. For Integrated Genome Browser visualization and gene-centred analysis using Deeptools, MACS2-generated bedgraph files were processed with the command \u2018sort -k1,1 -k2,2n 5_treat_pileup.bdg > 5_treat_pileup-sorted.bdg\u2019, and then converted using the BedGraphToBigWig program (ENCODE\nproject). The Deeptools analysis was generated using the command computeMatrix reference point, with the following parameters: \u2013minThreshold 2, \u2013binSize 10 and \u2013averageTypeBins sum. Plotprofile or heat map was then used with k-means clustering when applicable. Inter-sample comparisons were obtained using the nf-core ChIP\u2013seq workflow with standard parameters47. From this pipeline, HOMER (annotatePeaks) was used to analyse peak distribution relative to gene features. All of these raw and processed files can be found at GSE222819."

RNA integrity was assessed by standard non-denaturing 1.2% TBE agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA-seq was carried out following standard Illumina protocols, by Novogene (Cambridge, UK). Briefly, RNA quantity, integrity and purity were determined using the Agilent 5400 Fragment Analyzer System (Agilent Technologies). The RNA quality number ranged from 7.8 to 10 for all samples, which was considered sufficient. mRNAs were purified from total RNA using poly-T oligonucleotide-attached magnetic beads. After fragmentation, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers. Then the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using dUTP, instead of dTTP. The directional library was ready after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size selection, USER enzyme digestion, amplification and purification. The library was checked with Qubit and real-time PCR for quantification and a bioanalyser for size distribution detection. Quantified libraries were pooled and sequenced on Illumina platforms, according to effective library concentration and data amount. The samples were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform (2 \u00d7 150 bp, strand-specific sequencing) and generated about 40 million paired-end reads for each sample. The quality of the raw sequencing reads was assessed using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and MultiQC. For quantification and normalization of the expression data, the FASTQ reads were aligned to the ToxoDB-49 build of the T. gondii ME49 genome using Subread version 2.0.1 with the following options: subread-align -d 50 -D 600\u2013sortReadsByCoordinates.

Before initiating the transposition protocol, the pellet was gently washed with warm Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (Life technologies) and resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of cold PBS + protease inhibitor (Diagenode kit). Nuclei preparation, permeabilization, Tn5 transposition and library preparation was carried out following precisely the Diagenode ATAC\u2013seq kit protocol (C01080002). Nucleus permeabilization was carried out on an estimated 100,000 tachyzoites by diluting 10 \u03bcl of Dulbecco\u2019s cell suspension (from one T175 resuspended in 500 \u03bcl) in 240\u00a0\u03bcl of Dulbecco\u2019s PBS + protease inhibitor (1/25 dilution).

The Deeptools analysis was then generated using \u2018computeMatrix reference point\u2019, with the following parameters: \u2013minThreshold 2,\u2013binSize 10 and \u2013averageTypeBins sum. Quantitative analysis of untreated versus 24-h IAA conditions was carried out by nf-core through a broad peak calling and annotation (MACS2) followed by HOMER (annotatePeaks) to analyse peak distribution relative to gene features. Reads were counted on annotated peaks by featureCounts and counts were processed by DeSeq2 to generate global statistical analysis of peak intensities between conditions using biological duplicates. All of these raw and processed files can be found at GSE222832.\nGene synthesis for recombinant coexpression of T. gondii AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-I Gene synthesis for all insect cell codon-optimized constructs was provided by GenScript. (Strep)2\u2013APXI-2 and AP2XII-1\u2013Flag or AP2IX-6\u2013Flag genes were cloned within the coexpression donor vector pFastBac dual, which accepts two constructs. The (Strep)2\u2013AP2XI-2 expression cassette was derived from the TGME49_310900 gene with a fused dual Strep tag and tobacco etch virus (TEV) site in the N terminus. AP2XII-1\u2013Flag or AP2IX-6\u2013Flag was derived from the full-length TGME49_218960 and TGME49_290180 genes, respectively, with an additional non-cleavable Flag tag on the carboxy terminus. The (Strep)2\u2013AP2XI-2 expression cassette was under the control of the polyhedrin promoter; the AP2XII-1\u2013Flag or AP2IX-6\u2013Flag was under the control of the P10 promoter."

The established standard cloning and transfection protocols set up within the EMBL Grenoble eukaryotic expression facility were used. Although baculovirus synthesis (V0) and amplification (to V1) were carried out with SF21 cells cultured in SF900 III medium (Life Technologies), large-scale expression cultures were carried out with Hi-5 cells cultured in the protein-free ESF 921 insect cell culture medium (Expression System) and infected with 0.8\u20131.0% (v/v) of generation 2 (V1) baculovirus suspensions and collected 72 h after infection.\n(Strep)2\u2013AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1\u2013Flag or (Strep)2\u2013AP2XI-2 and AP2XIX-6\u2013Flag expression and purification For purification, three cell pellets of bout 500 ml of Hi-5 culture were each resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 400 mM NaCl and 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME)) in the presence of an anti-protease cocktail (Complete EDTA-free, Roche) and 1 \u03bcl of Benzonase (Merck Millipore, 70746). Lysis was carried out on ice by sonication for 3 min (30-s on/ 30-s off, 45\u00b0 amplitude). After the lysis step, 10% of glycerol was added. Clarification was then carried out by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000g and 4 \u00b0C and vacuum filtration using 45-\u03bcm nylon filter systems (SteriFlip, Merck Millipore). Before purification, tetrameric avidin (Biolock, IBA Lifescience) was added to the clarified lysate (1/1,000 v/v), which was then batch incubated for 20 min with 3 ml of Strep-Tactin XT (IBA Lifescience). Following the incubation, the resin was retained on a glass column and washed three times using 6 ml of lysis buffer (W1), 6 ml of lysis buffer with NaCl content at 1 M (W2) and 6 ml of lysis buffer (W3). The elution was then carried out using 1\u00d7 BXT buffer (IBA Lifescience) containing 50 mM biotin, 100 mM Tris pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl. This initial 1\u00d7 solution was further supplemented with 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM BME and 10% glycerol. Following Strep-Tactin XT elution, the sample was concentrated to 500 \u03bcl using a 100-kDa concentrator (Amicon Ultra 4, Merck Millipore) injected on an \u00c4KTA pure FPLC using a Superose 6 Increase column 10/300 GL (Cytiva) running in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 400 mM NaCl and 1 mM BME.\nMouse infection and experimental survey Six-week-old NMRI, CD1 or BALB/c mice were obtained from Janvier Laboratories. Female mice were used for all studies. For intraperitoneal infection, tachyzoites were grown in\u00a0vitro and extracted from host cells by passage through a 27-gauge needle, washed three times in PBS, and quantified with a haemocytometer. Parasites were diluted in Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (Life), and mice were inoculated by the intraperitoneal route with tachyzoites of each strain (in 200 \u03bcl volume) using a 28-gauge needle. Animal euthanasia was completed in an approved CO2 chamber. For immunolabelling on histological sections of the brains, the brains were removed from mice, entirely embedded in a paraffin wax block and cut into 5-\u03bcm-thick layers using a microtome."

Shown is the abundance of their transcripts at different developmental stages, namely merozoites, EES, tachyzoites, and cysts. The color scale indicates the log2-transformed fold changes. c-d, IGB screenshots of genomic regions with secondary transcription factors, including C2H2 Zinc Finger and AP2s, exhibiting activated expression in IAA-treated parasites. Displayed are ChIP-seq signal occupancy, ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility profiles, and nanopore DRS data, following the same representation as in Fig.\u00a06i.\nExtended Data Fig. 12 | Modeling of the modus operandi of AP2XII-1/ AP2XI-2. a, Inspired by a 2.2 A crystal structure (pdb: 3IGM), the model shows that AP2XII-1 and AP2XI-2 can interact with DNA through either homodimeric or heterodimeric forms. These configurations influence DNA looping by stabilizing or forming domain-swapped dimers. b, AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 together fully silence merozoite gene expression (red light). A single KD only partially represses gene expression (orange light). When both are knocked down, genes are fully expressed (green light). Even with one AP2 missing, the remaining one can form a homodimer to partially repress transcription (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010c, d). We hypothesize that each AP2 forms a fragile but stable homodimer, allowing mild gene expression due to easy disassociation from DNA. In contrast, heterodimers bind strongly to DNA, resulting in complete gene silencing. c, MORC/HDAC3 forms multiple partnerships with primary AP2, keeping chronic and sexual-stage genes in a persistently repressed chromatin state. The repressor complex drive the hierarchical expression of secondary AP2s, which may enforce the unidirectionality of the\nlife cycle by influencing the gene expression of their respective stages. In tachyzoites, genes specific to this stage (SAG1) are expressed, while those related to merozoites (GRA11b) are repressed by AP2XII-1/AP2XI-2. Other primary AP2s help in recruiting MORC to other stage-specific genes, such as those for sporozoites and bradyzoites, to silence their expression. Additionally, MORC has a non-genic function where it binds to telomeric repeats, possibly facilitating silencing at the chromosome ends (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01). Co-depletion of AP2XII-1/AP2XI-2 trigger merozoite gene activation, speeding up merogony. Secondary AP2s like AP2IX-1 then emerge, repressing tachyzoitespecific genes like SAG1. This second wave of TFs could also act as activators for pre-sexual genes not directly controlled by the primary AP2s (e.g., PNP; Extended Data Fig.\u00a010e), offering an alternative route to merozoite development. The MORC/HDAC3-containing complexes maintain stage-specific and telomeric gene silencing, demonstrating their selective roles. a\u2013c, Created with BioRender.com.\n1 nature portfolio | reporting sum m ary M arch 2021 Corresponding author(s): HAKIMI MOHAMED-ALI Last updated by author(s): 2023/09/17 Reporting Summary Nature Portfolio wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish.

Aligned reads were used for peak calling of the ChIP enriched peaks using MACS V2.2 with a cutoff p-value of 10-4. Data visualization: For IGB visualization and gene centered analysis using Deeptools, MACS2 generated bedgraph files were processed with the following command: \u201csort -k1,1 -k2,2n 5_treat_pileup.bdg > 5_treat_pileup-sorted.bdg\u201d then converted using the BedGraphToBigWig program (ENCODE project). The Deeptools analysis were generated using \u201ccomputeMatrix reference point\u201d with the following parameters (--minThreshold 2, -- binSize 10 and \u2013averageTypeBins sum). Plotprofile or heatmap was then used with a k-mean clustering when applicable. Inter sample comparison were obtained using the nf-core chip-seq V2.0.0 workflow with standard parameters.
