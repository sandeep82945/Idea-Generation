    "abstractText": "Background: Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound loss of life among older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes. As a pandemic response, LTC homes enforced infection control processes, including isolating older adults in their rooms, canceling therapeutic programs, and restricting family member visits. Social isolation negatively impacts older adults in LTC, which may result in increased rates of anxiety, depression, physical and cognitive decline, disorientation, fear, apathy, and premature death. Isolation of older adults can also cause an increase in responsive behaviors (eg, yelling, hitting, calling out) to express frustration, fear, restricted movement, and boredom. To respond to the challenges in LTC and support frontline staff, older adults, and family members, a novel registered practical nurse (RPN)-led delivery of the PIECES approach for addressing responsive behaviors among older adults with dementia using virtual training/mentoring was implemented in Canadian LTC homes. PIECES employs a personand family/care partner\u2013centered collaborative team-based approach to provide education and capacity-building for nurses; engages families as active participants in care; and embeds evidence-informed practices to provide personand family-centered care to older adults with complex needs, including dementia. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of LTC staff, family/care partners, and older adult research partners with implementation of a novel RPN-led virtual adaptation of the PIECES care-planning approach for responsive behaviors in two Canadian LTC homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "Background: Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound loss of life among older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes. As a pandemic response, LTC homes enforced infection control processes, including isolating older adults in their rooms, canceling therapeutic programs, and restricting family member visits. Social isolation negatively impacts older adults in LTC, which may result in increased rates of anxiety, depression, physical and cognitive decline, disorientation, fear, apathy, and premature death. Isolation of older adults can also cause an increase in responsive behaviors (eg, yelling, hitting, calling out) to express frustration, fear, restricted movement, and boredom. To respond to the challenges in LTC and support frontline staff, older adults, and family members, a novel registered practical nurse (RPN)-led delivery of the PIECES approach for addressing responsive behaviors among older adults with dementia using virtual training/mentoring was implemented in Canadian LTC homes. PIECES employs a person- and family/care partner\u2013centered collaborative team-based approach to provide education and capacity-building for nurses; engages families as active participants in care; and embeds evidence-informed practices to provide person- and family-centered care to older adults with complex needs, including dementia.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of LTC staff, family/care partners, and older adult research partners with implementation of a novel RPN-led virtual adaptation of the PIECES care-planning approach for responsive behaviors in two Canadian LTC homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nJMIR Nursing 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e42731 | p. 1https://nursing.jmir.org/2022/1/e42731 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nMethods: Using a qualitative descriptive design, two focus groups were held with three to four staff members (eg, RPNs, managers) per LTC home in Ontario. A third focus group was held with three PIECES mentors. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with RPN champions, family/care partners, and older adult research partners. Research team meeting notes provided an additional source of data. Content analysis was performed.\nResults: A total of 22 participants took part in a focus group (n=11) or an in-depth individual interview (n=11). Participant experiences suggest that implementation of RPN-led virtual PIECES fostered individualized care, included family as partners in care, increased interdisciplinary collaboration, and improved staff practices. However, virtual PIECES, as delivered, lacked opportunities for family member feedback on older adult outcomes. Implementation facilitators included the provision of mentorship and leadership at all levels of implementation and suitable technological infrastructure. Barriers were related to availability and use of virtual communication technology (family members) and older adults became upset due to lack of comprehension during virtual care conferences.\nConclusions: These findings offer promising support to adopting virtual PIECES, a team approach to gather valuable family input and engagement to address residents\u2019 unmet needs and responsive behaviors in LTC. Future research should investigate a hybridized communication format to foster sustainable person- and family-centered care-planning practices to include active collaboration of families in individualized care plans.\n(JMIR Nursing 2022;5(1):e42731) doi: 10.2196/42731"

            "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in death and decline in the physical, mental, and behavioral health of older adults in long-term care (LTC) [1,2]. This population has been more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus than the general population in part due to their living situation, advanced age, less robust immune system, and increased likelihood of having multiple comorbidities [3]. In Canada, two-thirds of COVID-19 deaths were among older adults in LTC from March 11, 2020, to May 8, 2020 [1]. In the early stages of the pandemic, LTC homes prioritized containing the spread of COVID-19 through strict infection control processes, which included isolating older adults in their own rooms, pausing therapeutic activities, and imposing restrictions on visits by family members. These measures meant that many older adults experienced prolonged periods of seclusion and a loss of social engagement. The social isolation of older adults in LTC homes was further exacerbated by government-mandated restrictions on in-person gatherings, which compounded the already stringent restrictions in place across many LTC homes [4].\nOutcomes of social isolation among older adults include a heightened risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, physical and cognitive decline, and premature death [5-7]. Other impacts include worsening apathy and boredom [8,9]. Many older adults\u2019 family members provide up to 30% of care, including assistance with personal care, nutrition, as well as social stimulation and emotional support [10]. These family members are also recognized by the LTC home staff as key partners in the care of older adults; however, current practice models used to guide care planning and delivery do not readily include them as active team members [11]. As a result, prohibiting caregivers from in-person visits with older adults in LTC in the earliest waves of the pandemic served to exacerbate older adults\u2019 social isolation and the subsequent health and behavioral consequences.\nPrior to the pandemic, 50% of older adults with dementia in LTC experienced responsive behaviors (eg, yelling, restlessness, hitting) in response to unmet needs such as pain, boredom, thirst, and hunger [12]. Multiple factors within LTC contribute to disproportionate responsive behaviors, including lack of staff education, inadequate skills, lack of support from leaders in management, and insufficient staffing resources [13]. Isolation of older adults with dementia can lead to higher incidences of responsive behaviors with a resultant increased use of antipsychotic medications by LTC staff [14]. During multiple waves of COVID-19, increased incidence of responsive behaviors in older adults in LTC was documented with the concomitant widespread isolation resulting from infection control processes and restrictions on in-person gatherings [15,16]. Approximately 51% of family members have reported an increase in responsive behaviors in persons with dementia since the pandemic started [15]. This exacerbation in behaviors highlights the need for interventions to support older adults and the care staff, and calls attention to the need to engage all persons caring for them (eg, older adults, families, frontline staff) in care-planning processes (eg, team-based) and policy development (eg, infection control and family as essential care partners, not visitors).\nAn example of a team-based care-planning model is PIECES, which consists of a holistic, relationship-based, and evidence-informed team approach to collaborative assessment and shared care designed for use by interdisciplinary teams to address the complex physical and mental health (eg, cognitive, emotional, social, psychological) needs of older adults [17]. Understanding what matters to the person and family is central to the PIECES model. The PIECES approach includes the following components in assessing the individual: Physical, Intellectual, and Emotional health; maximizing the Capabilities of an individual to support quality of life; integrating the living Environment of a person; and encompassing a person\u2019s Self, including beliefs, culture, and life story [17]. PIECES has been\nJMIR Nursing 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e42731 | p. 2https://nursing.jmir.org/2022/1/e42731 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nimplemented across Canada by interdisciplinary teams and in diverse settings, including acute care, LTC, home and community care, complex continuing care, and mental health settings, to put a plan in place to address responsive behaviors.\nThe PIECES approach educates staff to recognize and address mental health challenges and responsive behaviors, leading to more thorough assessments using a variety of existing tools, strengthening partnerships between LTC homes and external resources, and improving family satisfaction with care delivery [18,19]. In acute care settings, PIECES enhances collaboration between different disciplines, promotes individual assessments of older adults, and facilitates problem-solving to address behaviors [19,20]. By virtue of its person-centered design, the PIECES approach is well-suited to be delivered by registered practical nurses (RPNs), as the largest regulated frontline staff in LTC homes [21] who are most familiar with the older adults\u2019 day-to-day behavioral expressions and changes. In-person delivery of PIECES has been demonstrated to improve the recognition and early management of responsive behaviors and communication between staff and family; however, it has not previously been implemented virtually [20]. Virtual care is well-placed to support interdisciplinary team-based care planning by enhancing team communication, providing continuity of care, and facilitating collaborations between specialists such as geriatricians, physicians, and mental health experts [22-24]. Moreover, virtual care may offer novel training and leadership opportunities for frontline RPNs to lead care discussions involving multiple parties (eg, family care partners, health care providers, older adult LTC residents) regardless of their physical location.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, an urgent need emerged for increased support for older adults experiencing responsive behaviors in LTC [22]. This study employed a virtual adaptation of PIECES [17] training using Personal Health Information Protection Act\u2013approved Zoom videoconferencing technology. Synchronous meetings using virtual technology for RPNs to conduct individualized family care conferences with the family off-site, the older adult, and other health care team members (on- or off-site) were used to create an integrated care plan. This virtual PIECES intervention, shepherded by an on-site RPN champion from within the partner LTC home, provided the health care team with care protocols, supported by behavioral support staff, to maintain quality in care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and inclusion of family in care decisions.\nPIECES-trained staff completed PIECES referrals for residents experiencing responsive behaviors with the collaboration of other staff members (eg, personal support workers, social workers, recreational therapists, nurses) in the LTC home. RPN champions then contacted family members to schedule a virtual family care conference to discuss the behaviors of residents and to put in place a plan of care to address these behaviors. The RPN champion, PIECES-trained staff, family member, and resident (if able and willing) were present at the care conferences held by Zoom. PIECES-trained staff or RPN champions followed up with families to provide telephone or in-person updates regarding the outcomes of strategies put in place to address responsive behaviors. The role of PIECES mentors was to provide PIECES training for LTC staff, debrief with\nPIECES-trained staff and RPN champions, and address any questions. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to virtual PIECES implementation is an important future step to sustain and spread virtual care delivery. The purpose of this study was therefore to describe experiences and implementation facilitators and barriers in delivering a novel RPN-led virtual adaptation of the PIECES care-planning approach to address behavioral expressions in two Canadian LTC homes during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The director of care has a nursing background and purposely selected the two residents to be research partners, as they were able to understand the purpose of the study and contribute through virtual means. Convenience sampling [27] was used to select these participants. The participants were key stakeholders in implementing virtual PIECES at the LTC homes and family/care partners, who were active members of virtual care conferences to provide the family/resident story and to discuss mitigating the responsive behaviors of older adults. Participants were invited to engage via email or by phone. Participants were able to read, understand, and speak English. The sample size was not predetermined. However, review of qualitative descriptive studies showed that most studies included 11 to 25 participants [28].

A total of three focus groups were held. Two focus groups were held with three to four PIECES-trained staff of each LTC home (ie, one focus group per LTC home). A focus group was also held with the three PIECES mentors. Since the PIECES mentors regularly engaged with the LTC staff members (eg, behavioral management lead, registered dietitian, RPNs, managers) throughout the implementation of virtual PIECES, their perspective was important to inform understanding of the facilitators and barriers to this process. These focus groups were 60-80 minutes in length. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with RPN champions, family/care partners, and older adult research partners. These interviews lasted between 30 and 70 minutes, and no repeat interviews were conducted. Focus group and interview guides (see Multimedia Appendix 2 for sample questions) were developed through a review of the literature on various concepts, including PIECES, virtual care conferences, responsive behaviors, older adults, and LTC, and feedback of the research team members. Participants were asked about their experiences with the virtual PIECES intervention, implementation facilitators and barriers, and recommendations for improvement of the intervention. Interviews were recorded, anonymized, and transcribed verbatim.

So that was nice. [Site 1, FCP 2]\nPIECES conversations helped to build trust with older adults, which led to greater family satisfaction with care. Some family/care partners stated that they learned more about their family member through virtual care conferences, such as the occurrence of new behaviors and the severity of depression. Staff perceived that interactions with family/care partners and older adults were more positive through PIECES and they took more time to get to know older adults. Staff who participated in PIECES had knowledge regarding the older adults\u2019 preferences that were shared with them by family members during care conferences. This enabled the staff to share the older adults\u2019preferences with other staff members so they could better meet the older adults\u2019 needs on a consistent basis. These staff also tailored their care to optimize independence among older adults as much as possible. \u201cCapabilities too, like if she\u2019s [older adult] capable [to instill her own eye drops] and she can do it and she wants to stay as independent as possible that makes her feel glad that she can maintain that\u201d [Site 1, Staff 1].\nVideoconferencing used in delivering PIECES provided comfort for older adults, which enabled them to discuss their care with staff in the presence of a family/care partner.\nSo specifically with one of our PIECES referred resident, this resident did attend the care conference and she was delighted and eager to see her family. It was lovely to see their interactions so it was nice to kind of observe that interaction between the family member and the resident. We were able to discuss and involve that resident in her care and her actions so that was really nice to be able to involve the resident because that is in our bill of rights that each resident, they have the right to receive their own care and be involved in their own care plan.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the experiences and implementation barriers and facilitators of a virtual adaptation of the PIECES approach in an LTC setting. Overall, virtual PIECES was well-received by participating family/care partners, LTC staff, PIECES mentors, RPN champions, and older adult research partners. Participants described how virtual PIECES supported care planning to address responsive behaviors and provided an opportunity to offer individualized care within the challenging context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study findings suggest that virtual PIECES has value beyond the pandemic and is an important approach to engage family/care partners in LTC homes who may otherwise be excluded from care processes. LTC staff and family/care partners described how virtual PIECES helped them to provide care that was individually tailored to the life stories, preferences, and abilities of older adults.\nCollaboration between family/care partners and LTC staff helped facilitate successful responses for older adults who were experiencing responsive behaviors. Prior research has shown that family members are well-positioned to support LTC staff in recognizing changes in an individual\u2019s health because of their extensive familiarity with them [39]. Benefits of virtual care conferences, such as ease of access and inclusivity, were also appreciated by family/care partners and LTC staff. Family/care partners felt they could contribute important information to inform the older adult\u2019s care and were also given opportunities to learn about care provision by the LTC home. Despite the well-known benefits of family involvement in care-planning\nprocesses in LTC, research conducted in the United States found that only 16% of family/care partners participated in care-planning processes [40]. Older adults with more advanced forms of cognitive impairment may require greater involvement of family in care planning as they are unable to verbally communicate their needs and wishes, yet half of older adults in LTC with severe cognitive impairment do not have a family/care partner involved in their assessments [40]. Steps to foster person- and family-centered care can involve collaborative discussions that engage family members through interprofessional education for LTC staff and through the provision of opportunities for staff and family to attend care conferences [41,42]. Interventions in LTC that involve partnerships between family and staff often lead to positive outcomes such as improved quality of life for older adults and decreased burden and depression for caregivers [43,44]. Furthermore, these successful interventions also encouraged multiple key stakeholders to help engage family in care planning [43].\nIn this study, participants perceived that virtual PIECES, with its emphasis on inclusive and regular engagement and communication, enhanced individualized care for older adults experiencing responsive behaviors. Family/care partners felt that LTC staff knew the older adults on a more personal level and engaged with genuine interest to improve care delivery. This helped to strengthen and build trusting relationships between LTC staff, families, and older adults. Older adults who were unable to take part in virtual care conferences were well-represented by family/care partners who advocated for them, discussed medications and potential triggers for responsive behaviors, and could represent the older adults in decision-making processes, which are all key components of person- and family-centered care [45]. Positive relationships between older adults, family, and staff, as well as regular communication are necessary for collaborative decision-making regarding care [46,47]. Moreover, older adults and/or their families should be engaged in the development of personalized care plans in LTC [40]. Findings from this study highlight the important role that LTC leadership has to facilitate different approaches to person- and family-centered care, a finding that is also documented in the research literature [41]. Virtual communication technology, as implemented in this study, is a recognized tool to support older adults\u2019 social connections with their family members [16].\nOur findings further demonstrated that the virtual care conferences and team huddles implemented as part of virtual PIECES facilitated the ability of family/care partners and LTC staff to develop care plans to address responsive behaviors. Virtual care conferences held either by video or teleconference have been found to reduce stress among families and providers and increase the confidence of staff in addressing responsive behaviors [48]. Research on a video-consultation program to link health experts with multidisciplinary LTC staff to develop care plans to address responsive behaviors resulted in new recommendations that were followed for 72.3% of older adults [49]. However, despite being invited to participate in care-based discussions to address older adults\u2019 behaviors, families rarely participated [49]. This finding suggests there is a need for\nJMIR Nursing 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e42731 | p. 9https://nursing.jmir.org/2022/1/e42731 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nimproved communication, education, and efforts to foster an inclusive environment so that families are familiar and comfortable with the meaningful role they can have at care conferences. Going forward, it will be important to evaluate the impact of interventions including virtual PIECES on resident outcomes in LTC, such as quality of life, responsive behaviors, agitation, pain, and depression, and fostering LTC staff and family/care partners relationships.\nEnsuring that LTC homes had sufficient technological infrastructure was necessary for the successful implementation of virtual PIECES in this study. Family/care partners and LTC staff experienced challenges with the virtual communication technology at varying points, which included a lack of familiarity and receiving insufficient training to use the technology. Identified benefits of using technology to implement virtual PIECES included the ease of providing mentorship through virtual platforms and the facilitation of education to enhance staff practice. This research also highlights policy implications, including an identified need to provide support to families and staff in LTC to use technology, and ensuring that financial and human resources are available to offer technology as a mode of communication for all older adults and families during the pandemic and beyond. Integral to this process would be addressing aspects of equity; providing dedicated funding and IT resource personnel to assist families in accessing internet-based platforms. LTC homes should promote the use of technology among families by conducting online case conferences and family council meetings. Further, it will be important to ensure that diversity and inclusion are considered in the promotion and use of technology for family engagement. This may require closed captioning, an interpreter, language translation, and/or inclusion of culturally relevant care elements in LTC care models. Videoconferencing rather than telephone calls should be encouraged so that emotional connections and familiarity are nurtured by being able to recognize people on screen, and to see facial expressions and nonverbal cues [50]. They should ensure that homes have good quality WiFi in all locations\u2014internal and external to the building\u2014that staff receive technological training and support, and that LTC staff job descriptions recognize the role of staff to assist older adults and family/care partners to engage with technology [16]. Findings from this study suggest that family/care partners are interested in the outcomes of virtual conferences and value opportunities to provide feedback. Henceforth, family/care partners should have opportunities for structured and predictable communication where they can connect with both older adults and the LTC staff [50]. During and beyond pandemics and outbreaks, there would be a benefit to having key staff members assigned as primary contacts for family/care partners to facilitate ongoing tailored communication using video, telephone, or email [51]."

Moreover, this is the first known study to implement a virtual adaptation of the PIECES approach in LTC. Limitations identified were the inclusion of only two LTC homes located in Ontario, Canada; the use of single interviews that may have constrained the ability to capture implementation experiences over time; and a lack of participant demographic information such as ethnicity, age, education level, years living in the LTC home, and family/care partner support. Most of the participants in this study were female. This finding is consistent with the gender distribution in LTC, as 90% of paid staff in LTC are women [52].\nIn an ideal situation, a randomized controlled trial would have been conducted, but given the constraints and challenges of COVID-19, this was an opportunity to explore a useful tool in a different format.

Future studies, especially those that include partnering with families and residents, should ensure that participants have full understanding of interventions and be provided with opportunities to ask questions. A potential strategy could be introducing the intervention at family and resident council meetings to offer opportunities for dialogue and clarification."

            "text": "This study entailed implementing a recognized clinical care planning tool (PIECES) in a virtual format to support the care of older adults experiencing responsive behaviors in LTC within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest that virtual videoconferencing approaches to team-based care planning can be successfully implemented in LTC, and provide increased opportunities for engagement and inclusivity for LTC staff, family members, and older adults living in LTC. These findings are important because they indicate that family members can continue to be engaged in the care of older adults despite pandemic or outbreak situations, which may necessitate constraints on in-person participation. Moving forward, future research should explore how to effectively embed virtual care\u2013planning processes more broadly into the policy and procedures of LTC homes, including understanding the required infrastructure, training, and supports needed to optimize inclusivity and equity. Important next steps could explore how virtual team\u2013based care-planning approaches could potentially be used in remote locations to increase access to health care specialists such as geriatricians and nurses with geriatric specialization, and to foster engagement of family/care partners who may be unable to participate in person due to work or geographic limitations. Moreover, more research is needed to understand how virtual technology (eg, translation software) could increase engagement for older adults and family/care partners who are from linguistically and culturally diverse populations.\nJMIR Nursing 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 1 | e42731 | p. 10https://nursing.jmir.org/2022/1/e42731 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"
