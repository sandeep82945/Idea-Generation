The relative velocity that describes such movements can be a slowly relaxing variable. Its couplings to the nematic and the magnetic degrees of freedom are particularly interesting since the symmetry properties (behavior under spatial inversion and time reversal) of the three vectorial quantities involved are all different. As a consequence, a number of new crosscouplings involving the relative velocity exist. Some of them are discussed in more detail. First, we demonstrate that transverse temperature gradients generate transverse relative velocities and, vice versa, that transverse relative velocities give rise to temperature gradients. Second, we show that a simple shear flow in the relative velocity with the preferred direction in the shear plane can lead in a stationary situation to a tilt of the magnetization. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nHydrodynamics is the prototype for a macroscopic description of the dynamics of condensed systems, e.g., fluids. The variables used are long-lived conserved variables (such as mass, momentum, and energy) and symmetry variables connected to spontaneously broken (continuous) symmetries (such as director rotations in a nematic liquid crystal, magnetization rotations in a ferromagnetic liquid, and displacements in a crystal).1,2 For more complex systems or more complicated situations, variables come into play that do not belong to the strictly hydrodynamic case but live long enough to take part in the dynamics of a macroscopic system. The concept of slowly relaxing variables has been pioneered by Pitaevskii3 for the relaxation of the order parameter modulus near the \u03bb-transition in superfluid 4He. These slowly relaxing variables are well-known from, e.g., order parameter relaxation near second order phase transitions,4,5 strain relaxation in polymers,6,7 rotations of a nematic orientation relative to the elastomeric matrix,8,9 chemical reactions in binary mixtures (compare, for example, Ref. 10), and many other systems.\nA rather special type of relaxational variable can occur in a twophase system when the constituents are able to move relative to each other. The relative velocity (the difference of the individual velocities of the two phases) generally is a relaxing quantity since it is neither related to a conservation law nor to a broken symmetry.11 Exceptions are superfluids, where the second (superfluid) velocity is due to the broken gauge symmetry.4,12,13 In the non-superfluid case, which will be dealt with here, there is always friction during relative motion and the momenta of the two constituents are not conserved. If the relative velocity is slowly relaxing, it constitutes a rather specific additional variable, odd under spatial inversion and odd under time reversal, that considerably influences the structure of the appropriate hydrodynamics. For a broader discussion of the relation between the symmetry of phases (variables) with the structure of the hydrodynamics, cf. Refs. 14 and 15.\nThe advantages of a two-fluid model when compared to a one fluid approach are clear: One allows for a relative motion of the constituents relative to each other, thus resulting in a more mesoscopic description, which is also applicable to shorter length\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 044504 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0080118 156, 044504-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 21:58:28\nscales and/or higher frequencies. The price to be paid is also apparent: One has additional relaxing variables and, as a result, more phenomenological parameters entering the description.\nMacroscopic two-fluid descriptions have already been given for nematic liquid crystals in an isotropic solvent,11 for isotropic elastic media in an isotropic solvent11,16 with application to the cluster dynamics above the glass transition,17 for nematic liquid crystals in the presence of smectic order to describe the breakdown of flow alignment,18 for a magnetic fluid in an isotropic solvent to describe magnetorheological fluids,19 for fluids with tetrahedral order in an isotropic solvent,20 and for a mixture of two isotropic elastic media.21 In this paper, we give a two-fluid description of ferromagnetic nematics, where the nematic part and the magnetic part can move relative to each other.\nFerromagnetic nematics have been suggested very early by Brochard and de Gennes,22 and the single-fluid Landau and hydrodynamic descriptions were given in Refs. 23\u201325. Experimentally, stable ferromagnetic nematics were obtained in the form of a suspension of ferromagnetic platelets in a nematic liquid crystal26,27 recently. In addition to a number of static properties,26\u201328 various optical and flow properties were discussed theoretically and successfully compared with experiments.29\u201331\nFor the two-fluid description of ferromagnetic nematics, we restrict ourselves to the case that in equilibrium the nematic director and the magnetization (and an external magnetic field) are collinear. The material tensors involved will be given in uniaxial approximation. We first characterize the nematic and magnetic subsystems and introduce the framework to describe relative motion (Sec. II). The macroscopic dynamics includes the static part (Sec. III), the dynamic equations (Sec. IV), and the dissipative and reversible currents (Secs. IV B and IV C). A discussion of some physical implications of the two-fluid aspects is given in Sec. V, which is followed by conclusions and perspective (Sec. VI)."

            "text": "We consider a mixture of a nematic liquid and a ferromagnetic one. The nematic liquid shows a preferred direction ni according to the order parameter Qij = (S/2)(ninj \u2212 [1/3]\u03b4ij)with S being a measure of the strength of the orientational order.32 It is assumed to be a fast relaxing variable that is on the hydrodynamic time scale always in equilibrium. The director ni can be used like an axial unit vector if the invariance ni \u2192 \u2212ni of the appropriate equations is ensured. In the ground state (in the absence of any boundaries or external fields), the orientation of n0i is arbitrary and constitutes therefore a spontaneously breaking of rotational symmetry. An external magnetic field Hi can orient the director, either parallel or perpendicular to the field, depending on the sign of the diamagnetic anisotropy,32 \u03b5a = \u2212(1/2)\u03c7a(n \u22c5H)\n2. The ferromagnetic liquid is characterized by a finite magnetization, Mi =Mmi, with M being its magnitude and the axial unit vector mi denoting its orientation. It changes sign under time reversal and also breaks rotational symmetry. In the ground state, m0i is arbitrary. In the presence of a (homogeneous) magnetic field, Hi, the magnetization orients along the field, m0i \u2225Hi, due to ferromagnetic coupling \u03b5f = \u2212Mm \u22c5H. With the field, M0 increases to M0(H). We will take this material function from experiment. Similar to the\nnematic case, we will assume that M is fast relaxing and is always given by its (field-dependent) equilibrium value.\nWe will concentrate on the case, where in the ground state, the director, the magnetization, and, if present, the field are collinear. This is achieved by choosing \u03c7a > 0 a coupling energy \u03b5c = \u2212(1/2)A1(n \u22c5m)2 with A1 > 0. The latter term describes the coupling between the nematic director and the magnetic particles. This strong interaction was observed in a series of experiments33\u201335 studying the Fredericks transition in ferronematics. For the experimentally accessible systems existing so far, the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic platelets, m, and the nematic director, n, are parallel in the ground state without external fields. In case a ground state is observed experimentally for which the director and the magnetization direction are not parallel in equilibrium, one has to deal with a biaxial system. In this case, all property tensors will be biaxial in nature.\nWe assume the two subsystems to be able to move relative to each other. Thus, we need for a macroscopic dynamic description two mass densities, \u03c1n and \u03c1m, and two momenta, g n i and g m i . Since the nematogens and the magnetic particles are distinct entities, both densities are conserved individually. In order to simplify the analysis, we will later assume the total mass density, \u03c1 = \u03c1n + \u03c1m, to be constant. As the remaining variable, we take the concentration of the magnetic part, \u03d5 = \u03c1m/\u03c1.\nThe partial momenta are not conserved since by moving around the two subsystems can exchange momentum. Only the total momentum density, gi = gni + gmi , is conserved. Therefore, it makes sense to use it as a variable. As the second variable, one takes, instead of the momenta difference, the velocity difference, wi = vni \u2212 vmi , with vni = gni /\u03c1n and vmi = gmi /\u03c1m, which is easier to account for in experiments. The mean velocity, vi = gi/\u03c1, is a weighted sum of the two velocities, vi = (1 \u2212 \u03d5)vni + \u03d5vmi .\nWe assume that the thermal degree of freedom, the entropy density \u03c3, is common to both subsystems, meaning that there is only one temperature."

We note that the positivity of \u03b5 in Eq. (3) guarantees linear stability around the ground state assumed here. However, Eq. (3) is not suitable to describe the transition to another ground state. In this case, another method such as, for example, a Ginzburg\u2013Landau approach is called for.24\nThe rotational elastic material tensors read in uniaxial approximation (\u2217 \u2208 {n.m}),\nK\u2217ijkl = K\u22171 \u03b4 ij \u03b4 kl + K \u2217 2 npnq\u03f5ijp\u03f5klq + K\u22173 njnl\u03b4 ik, (4)\nK\u0303 ijkl = K\u0303\u03b4 ik(njml + nlmj).

(42) and (35)].\nIn the Maxwell stress, the field Bi = Hi +Mi by definition. Putting all dynamic equations into the Gibbs relation, one finds that the non-phenomenological contributions add up to zero entropy production, as is required for reversible contributions. For the phenomenological parts of the currents, one gets (neglecting surface effects)\nR = \u2212j \u03c3\u2217i \u2207iT \u2212 j\u03d5\u2217i \u2207i\u03a0 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2217 ij \u2207jvi + hwi Z\u2217i + hmi \u03b4 ikX \u2217 k + hni \u03b4 ikY \u2217 k , (25) and the second law of thermodynamics requires R \u2265 0 with the equal sign (> sign) for \u2217 = R (\u2217 = D).\nThe energy conservation law Eq. (14) is redundant due to the Gibbs relation, and the continuity equation, Eq. (16), reduces to\u2207ivi in the constant density approximation. The incompressibility condition (constant density approximation) implies that we are restricting ourselves throughout the rest of the paper to velocities that are small compared to the velocity of sound. In addition,11 it also means, in the two-fluid context, that the concentration \u03d5 is a conserved variable, while this is, in general, no longer the case if the incompressibility condition is not implemented.\nIn the whole set of dynamic equations, the mean velocity vi has been chosen as the transport/convective velocity for all variables. This ensures zero entropy production of those contributions. However, in a simplified model, one would expect that variables connected with the magnetization (with the nematic degree of freedom) are convected with the velocity vmi (v n i ). This can be achieved by a special choice for the values of some reversible transport parameters, thereby preserving zero entropy production. This will be done in Sec. IV C."

Such terms are used below to tackle the question of transport and convection velocities.\nThe second rank tensors \u03b2ij, \u03b3ij are of the standard uniaxial form, Eq.

(46) In contrast to the analogous dissipative tensors, they are antisymmetric, e.g., \u03baRij = \u2212\u03baRji , leading to R = 0, and they contain a factor \u223cmi to account for the correct time reversal behavior.23\nThe third rank tensors \u03bbijk and cRijk describe the rotation of ni and mi, respectively, due to the flow of the mean velocity,\n2\u03bbijk = \u03bb (\u03b4 ij nk + \u03b4 iknj), (47)\n2cRijk = cR(\u03b4 ij mk + \u03b4 ikmj), (48)\nwith \u03bb being the well-known flow alignment parameter of nematics. Analogous effects due to the flow of the relative velocity are described by the material tensors \u03bbwijk and \u03c4 R ijk,\n\u03bbwijk = \u03bbw1 \u03b4 ij nk + \u03bbw2 \u03b4 iknj, (49)\n\u03c4Rijk = \u03c4R1 \u03b4 ij mk + \u03c4R2 \u03b4 ikmj, (50)\nwhich are not necessarily symmetric in the last two indices. We note that the sign of the coefficients in Eqs. (49) and (50) can change depending on the shape of the molecules. This is already known to be possible40,41 for rod-like vs disk-like molecules for the flow alignment parameter \u03bb in usual low-molecular weight nematics. When applying Eqs. (49) and (50), a more complex behavior for flow alignment will result, in general.\nThe reversible analog of the (dissipative) viscosity tensor, \u03bdRijkl, has eight components and is given in Ref. 23. It is antisymmetric in the exchange of the first pair of indices with the second one, thus guaranteeing zero entropy production, and every component of it contains a factor \u223cmi to account for the correct time reversal behavior.\nFinally, we discuss how we get the model, where all magnetic (nematic) degrees of freedom are transported/convected with the appropriate velocities vmi (v n i ). For the conserved densities, we already have taken the individual mass currents as \u03c1mvmi and \u03c1nvni , leading to Eqs. (16) and (17). Therefore, j\u03d5Ri , Eq. (41), must not contain any term that would change this, and we have to put \u03b3 = 0 = \u03b3\u2225. Similarly, we assume the entropy to be transported by the mean velocity, and therefore, we put \u03b2ij \u2261 0.\nIn order to get ni transported by vni and mi by v m i , we have to choose \u03b21 = 1/\u03c1n and \u03b25 = \u22121/\u03c1m. In Eqs. (21) and (20), the convection terms for ni and mi involve the vorticity of the mean velocity. In order to use the appropriate velocities instead, one has to choose \u03bbwc = 1/\u03c1n and \u03c4Rc = \u22121/\u03c1m. For the partial momenta, the appropriate transport velocities require \u03b22 = 1/2 = \u03b24 and \u03b23 = 1/\u03c1m \u2212 1/\u03c1n. 11,16"

Using the entropy currents, Eqs. (34) and (40), and assuming that vertical boundaries block a constant entropy current, the temperature gradients read\n\u2207xT = \u03beT\u03b1\n\u03ba2 + (\u03baR)2 (\u03ba wy + \u03baR wx), (55)\n\u2207yT = \u03beT\u03b1\n\u03ba2 + (\u03baR)2 (\u2212\u03ba wx + \u03baR wy), (56)\nwith \u03ba being the transverse heat diffusion and \u03baR being its reversible counterpart.

            "text": "In this paper, we have studied two-fluid effects on the macroscopic dynamic behavior of a rather recent soft matter system, ferromagnetic nematics. It turns out that the relative velocity between the two subsystems, namely, the nematic solvent and the magnetic platelets, gives rise to a number of reversible and dissipative dynamic crosscoupling terms. Several of these should be detectable experimentally. Among these effects, we have studied in some detail two groups of effects. One is the reversible and dissipative coupling between temperature and concentration gradients to the relative velocity. The other type of effect is related to the vorticity in the magnetization and its coupling to gradients in the relative velocity.\nThroughout this paper, we have assumed that the nematic director, n\u0302, and the direction of the ferromagnetic magnetizations, m\u0302, are parallel in the ground state. We note, however, that this degeneracy can be lifted by applying electric and magnetic fields. We mention as an example the case of an electric field, which has already been studied experimentally in the static limit.28 For externally applied electric or magnetic fields, the ferromagnetic nematic will become biaxial. As a consequence, all property tensors presented in the present paper will also assume a biaxial form. This can be implemented practically very easily by drawing on the experience with the macroscopic behavior of other biaxial fluid systems such as for biaxial nematics42,43 and biaxial ferronematics.44\nAs a perspective, we would like to mention briefly that the two-fluid approach presented here can be generalized in several directions. One is ferromagnetic liquid crystalline gels and elastomers. While uniaxial ferromagnetic gels and elastomers have been reported a number of years ago already,45,46 ferromagnetic liquid crystalline elastomers have been synthesized only quite recently for a mainchain polymer system.47\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 044504 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0080118 156, 044504-6\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 21:58:28\nAnother one is the incorporation of chirality concerning twofluid aspects. Ferromagnetic cholesterics have been synthesized and characterized quite recently,48 and the macroscopic dynamics of ferrocholesterics has been given.49 For the approach of macroscopic dynamics, macroscopic chirality leads to the existence of a pseudoscalar quantity, the pitch q0, which changes sign under spatial inversion and thus makes possible in many instances a lower order in spatial gradients for crosscoupling terms.\nWe close by pointing out that another direction to go into for the macroscopic consequences of two-fluid effects in the domain of liquid crystals will be ferroelectric nematics, which are the analog of ferromagnetism in the electric domain.\nAUTHOR DECLARATIONS Conflict of Interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest to declare.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study."
