    "abstractText": "We study the linear response to strain in a mean field elastoplastic model for athermal amorphous solids, incorporating the power-law mechanical noise spectrum arising from plastic events. In the \u201cjammed\u201d regime of the model, where the plastic activity exhibits a non-trivial slow relaxation referred to as aging, we find that the stress relaxes incompletely to an age-dependent plateau, on a timescale which grows with material age. We determine the scaling behaviour of this aging linear response analytically, finding that key scaling exponents are universal and independent of the noise exponent \u03bc. For \u03bc > 1, we find simple aging, where the stress relaxation timescale scales linearly with the age tw of the material. At \u03bc = 1, which corresponds to interactions mediated by the physical elastic propagator, we find instead a t 1/2 w scaling arising from the stretched exponential decay of the plastic activity. We compare these predictions with measurements of the linear response in computer simulations of a model jammed system of repulsive soft athermal particles, during its slow dissipative relaxation towards mechanical equilibrium, and find good agreement with the theory.",

In the \u201cjammed\u201d regime of the model, where the plastic activity exhibits a non-trivial slow relaxation referred to as aging, we find that the stress relaxes incompletely to an age-dependent plateau, on a timescale which grows with material age. We determine the scaling behaviour of this aging linear response analytically, finding that key scaling exponents are universal and independent of the noise exponent \u00b5. For \u00b5 > 1, we find simple aging, where the stress relaxation timescale scales linearly with the age tw of the material. At \u00b5 = 1, which corresponds to interactions mediated by the physical elastic propagator, we find instead a t 1/2 w scaling arising from the stretched exponential decay of the plastic activity. We compare these predictions with measurements of the linear response in computer simulations of a model jammed system of repulsive soft athermal particles, during its slow dissipative relaxation towards mechanical equilibrium, and find good agreement with the theory.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAmorphous solids, including foams and emulsions used in everyday life, show rich and complex behaviour, and have long posed a challenge to theoretical progress due to their inherent disorder [1\u20133]. Many of these systems are effectively athermal because the constituent elements (be they droplets, bubbles or particles) are large enough for thermal fluctuations to be neglected. Progress in the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of such systems has been facilitated by elastoplastic models [1], which propose a mesoscopic approach. This is based on the substantial numerical and experimental evidence showing that local plastic (non-affine) rearrangements are the key to understanding deformation and flow in these systems [1, 4\u20137]. Elastoplastic models accordingly describe the dynamics of mesoscopic stress elements as consisting of periods of elastic loading interrupted by plastic relaxation events. This elastoplastic approach has been very successful in studying the yielding of amorphous solids under mechanical deformation [8\u201316].\nThe relaxation dynamics of athermal amorphous solids, on the other hand, has received much less attention. Recent work [17\u201319] has shown that model athermal suspensions of soft particles above jamming can display non-trivial slow dynamics, typically referred to as aging, as they perform gradient descent in the energy landscape [20]. This athermal aging behaviour is to be contrasted with the aging of thermal colloidal glasses [21, 22]\n\u2217 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed: jack.parley@uni-goettingen.de\nor spin glasses [23], which has been widely studied, using e.g. trap based models [24] built around thermal activation, or record dynamics [25]. The importance of \u201chotspots\u201d of non-affine relaxation, reminiscent of local plastic (Eshelby) events, during the athermal aging process [17] leads us instead to propose an elastoplastic approach to the problem.\nIn a previous paper [26] we introduced a mean field elastoplastic model and showed that it presents aging behaviour, characterised by a slow decay of the yield rate, i.e. the number of plastic events per unit time. The model is mean field, treating stress propagation as a mechanical noise that is power-law distributed with exponent \u00b5, the physical elastic propagator corresponding to \u00b5 = 1. This extended the work of Lin and Wyart [9] in steady shear, where the success of the approach regarding the exponents associated with the yielding transition suggested that this is the correct mean field model in the sense that it applies in large dimensions.\nHere, we go beyond [26] and study the aging of the linear shear response of the model, which unlike the yield rate can be directly compared to stress measurements in particle-based simulations or experiments. We finally carry out such a comparison, taking as reference the aging soft athermal suspension mentioned above [17], finding good agreement with the theory for \u00b5 = 1.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly recapitulate the mean field elastoplastic model introduced in [26]. In Sec. III we provide theoretical background on how the linear response, and in particular the viscoelastic moduli, are defined in the aging regime. We also set out how they can be calculated within our model. Next, in Sec. IV we give an intuitive scaling argument that motivates our analytical results. In Sec. V we then\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n04 38\n7v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n5 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2 derive these results in the aging regime, both in the time and in the frequency domain. Finally, in Sections VI and VII we specialise to the model with \u00b5 = 1, first checking our results within full non-linear simulations of the mean field model and then comparing the theory to stress measurements in an athermal particle system. We conclude with a discussion and outlook towards future research in Sec. VIII."

            "text": "We recall here the most important features of the mean field elastoplastic model presented in [26], referring the interested reader to the original paper. Following other elastoplastic descriptions [1], we consider the stress dynamics of mesoscopic blocks of the system as consisting of periods of elastic loading punctuated by plastic relaxation events, where the local stress is reset to 0. We define a local yield threshold \u03c3c, so that the block located at site i becomes plastic at a rate \u03c4\u22121pl if |\u03c3i| > \u03c3c, at which point all other blocks instantaneously receive a stress increment \u03b4\u03c3 mediated by an elastic propagator G(r) [27]. Neglecting spatial correlations, this stress propagation can then be captured as a mean-field mechanical noise, given by a distribution of stress increments \u03c1(\u03b4\u03c3). This distribution behaves for small arguments as \u03c1 \u223c (A/N)|\u03b4\u03c3|\u2212\u00b5\u22121, with N the size of the system, i.e. the number of blocks, \u00b5 the noise exponent and A the coupling parameter. For large |\u03b4\u03c3|, it is cut off at a system size-independent upper cutoff \u03b4\u03c3u = (2A/\u00b5)\n1/\u00b5 that corresponds physically to the stress increment caused by yielding in a directly neighbouring block.\nThe model contains two key parameters, \u00b5 and A. The noise exponent \u00b5 is given by \u00b5 = d/\u03b2. Here, d is the spatial dimension, while \u03b2 is the decay exponent of the propagator G \u223c r\u2212\u03b2 with r = |r|. The stress propagation from a localised plastic event is known [27] to be longrange (with \u03b2 = d), and to have a spatially alternating sign (with e.g. a quadrupolar form in 2d, see Fig. 1). If as discussed above one considers stress propagation from isolated plastic events, this implies \u00b5 = 1. From a more coarse-grained perspective, it has been argued that mechanical noise accumulated within some fixed time interval should be considered as arising from collections of avalanches [11\u201314], which leads to a mean field model with 1 < \u00b5 < 2. We will therefore develop our analysis for generic exponent values \u00b5 in the range 1 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 2.\nThe second model parameter, i.e. the coupling constant A, can also be derived [26] from two different perspectives. In a lattice model with one block per site A is fixed by the form of the Eshelby propagator for the given lattice geometry (e.g. A ' 0.32 for a square 2D lattice). If instead one views the constituent blocks of the system as weak zones at randomly distributed sites, A depends on the strength of the elastic interactions and on the density of such sites. We will therefore also treat it as a tunable parameter.\n50 55 60 65 70 7550\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n0.12\n0.09\n0.06\n0.03\n0.00\n0.03\n0.06\n0.09\nFIG. 1.

As also shown in [26], the master equation (1) for general \u00b5 becomes that of the well known He\u0301braudLequeux (HL) model with coupling constant \u03b1 [28] for \u00b5\u2192 2\n\u2202P (\u03c3, t)\n\u2202t = \u2212G0\u03b3\u0307\n\u2202P \u2202\u03c3 (3)\n+ \u03b1\u0393(t) \u22022P \u2202\u03c32 \u2212 \u03b8(|\u03c3| \u2212 \u03c3c) \u03c4pl P + \u0393(t)\u03b4(\u03c3)\nWe summarise briefly the phase diagram of the model in the (\u00b5,A) plane, studied in detail in [26]. There, the critical coupling curve Ac(\u00b5) (reproduced in Fig. 2) separating the two phases of the model was found numerically, presenting a bell-shaped form with a peak at \u00b5 ' 1. For A > Ac(\u00b5), the system is in a \u201cliquid\u201d phase behaving as a Newtonian fluid \u03a3 = \u03b7\u03b3\u0307 under applied shear; here and throughout the macroscopic stress is taken as the average \u03a3(t) = \u222b d\u03c3 \u03c3P (\u03c3, t). Without shear, the system is able to sustain a steady state with finite yield rate\n3 \u0393ss > 0, behaving essentially as a Maxwell fluid with a finite relaxation time. The latter diverges as A \u2192 A+c , with anomalous non-Maxwellian behaviour arising as this critical point is approached (see below). The existence of such a steady state within the model has been argued to be unphysical [29], given that external driving should be necessary to maintain the dissipative plastic events. On the other hand, elastoplasticity has been shown to play an important role also in unsheared systems, particularly for long-range dynamic facilitation in supercooled liquids below the mode-coupling temperature [30]. The unsheared steady state regime may therefore be relevant in such a context, although one would presumably need to generalize the model discussed here to explicitly include the thermal activation of plastic events (along the\nlines of [31]).\nWe will in any case focus mainly on the aging regime below. In this glassy phase for A < Ac(\u00b5), there is no steady state with \u0393 > 0 in the absence of shear, and the yield rate decays as the system approaches an initial condition dependent frozen-in stress distribution Q0(\u03c3) \u2261 P0(\u03c3, t\u2192\u221e) (see e.g. Fig. 2 in [26]). This distribution was shown to exhibit [9, 26] pseudogap scaling near the yield threshold, Q0(\u03c3) \u223c (\u03c3c \u2212 |\u03c3|)\u00b5/2. This behaviour is found also in the steady state stress distribution on the liquid side in the limit \u0393 \u2192 0, and is in agreement with the results of MD simulations [32].\nIn [26], we studied the slow decay of \u0393(t) by evolving the unperturbed dynamics starting from an initial distribution with enough unstable sites. This was argued to represent the dynamics of the system after an initial preparation, such as stirring, shear melting or a sudden change in density [26]. If the system is athermal, the ensuing dissipative dynamics is driven by rearrangements that can only be triggered by events taking place elsewhere in the system, as described here. The yield rate was found to decay as a power law \u0393(t) \u223c t\u2212\u00b5/(\u00b5\u22121) for 1 < \u00b5 < 2, a stretched exponential \u0393(t) \u223c e\u2212B \u221a t for \u00b5 = 1 and an exponential for \u00b5 < 1, reflecting the relative importance of far-field and near-field events as the range of the stress propagator is varied [26]. The different regimes are sketched in Fig. 2, where we indicate also the different parameter values for which we will study the linear shear response numerically in this paper. We include among these two parameter values pertaining to the case of critical aging, i.e. relaxation at criticality A = Ac(\u00b5), where the yield rate decays as \u0393(t) \u223c t\u22121 for all \u00b5 [26]."

We assume that a small step strain \u03b3(t) = \u03b30\u03b8(t \u2212 tw) (with \u03b30 1) is applied at a certain switch-on time, which we denote as the waiting time tw. The corresponding shear stress is given by the linear\nFIG. 2. Phase diagram of the model in the (\u00b5,A) plane [26], defined by the curve Ac(\u00b5) (blue). The two black triangles (\u00b5 = 1.0, A = Ac(1.0) and \u00b5 = 1.5, A = Ac(1.5)) and arrows indicate the numerical parameter values for which we study aging at criticality in App. B. The purple (\u00b5 = 1.7, A = 0.15) and red (\u00b5 = 1.0, A = 0.55) diamonds and arrows show the cases studied for aging in the glass phase in Sec.

From this response to a step strain one may then derive the linear response to more complex perturbations such as oscillatory strain, as described below.\nWithin our mean field elastoplastic model, the shear perturbation manifests itself via its effect on the dynamics of the stress distribution P (\u03c3, t). In the generic aging case, both the unperturbed distribution P0(\u03c3, t) and the unperturbed yield rate \u03930(t) will depend on time. We then expand the perturbed solution P (\u03c3, t) of the master equation (1) for t > tw as\nP (\u03c3, t) = P0(\u03c3, t) + \u03b30 \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) +O(\u03b320) (5)\nLikewise, for the yield rate we may write\n\u0393(t) = \u03930(t) + \u03b30 \u03b4\u0393(t) +O(\u03b320) (6)\nTo simplify the analysis we now assume as in [26, 33] that the system preparation leads to a symmetric initial stress distribution P0(\u03c3, 0). The unperturbed dynamics preserves this symmetry, so that P0(\u03c3, t) = P0(\u2212\u03c3, t) \u2200t. With this assumption, one may show as in [33] that the first order correction to the yield rate \u03b4\u0393(t) vanishes. This simply follows from the invariance of the time evolution of the master equation (1) under joint sign reversal of \u03c3 and \u03b30, which implies that \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) must be an odd function of \u03c3, so that\n\u03b4\u0393(t) = 1\n\u03c4pl \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c3 \u03b8(|\u03c3| \u2212 \u03c3c)\u03b4P (\u03c3, t) = 0 (7)\n4 If we now insert the perturbed form (5) of P (\u03c3, t) into the master equation (1), we find at O(\u03b30) and for t > tw the following equation for the perturbation:\n\u2202t\u03b4P (\u03c3, t) = A\u0393(t) \u222b \u03c3+\u03b4\u03c3u \u03c3\u2212\u03b4\u03c3u d\u03c3\u2032 \u03b4P (\u03c3\u2032, t)\u2212 \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) |\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u2032|\u00b5+1\n\u2212\u03b8(|\u03c3| \u2212 \u03c3c) \u03c4pl \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) (8)\nThe initial condition for this is found by integrating (1) in a small time interval around t = tw, giving\n\u03b4P (\u03c3, tw) = \u2212\u2202\u03c3P0(\u03c3, tw) (9)\nSince we identify the macroscopic stress with the average over the local distribution, once we have found \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) the linear stress relaxation function can be computed as\nG(t, tw) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c3 \u03c3\u03b4P (\u03c3, t) = 2 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c3 \u03c3\u03b4P (\u03c3, t) (10)\nwhere the second equality follows from the antisymmetry of \u03b4P . Using the initial condition (9) and bearing in mind that P0(\u03c3, tw) is normalised we have the initial value G(tw, tw) = G0.\nThe steady state and aging stress relaxation are distinct in their dependence on the waiting time tw. If the unperturbed system is already prepared in a steady state, P0(\u03c3, t) = P ss(\u03c3) and \u03930(t) = \u0393 ss are independent of time and we find as expected a time translation invariant (TTI) stress relaxation function G(t, tw) = G(t \u2212 tw) \u2261 G(\u2206t). In the aging regime, on the other hand, this invariance is lost and G(t, tw) in general depends on both time arguments.\nA similar distinction may be made in the frequency response, for which we follow the generic discussion in [34]. For TTI systems, we may write the response to an oscillatory strain \u03b3(t) = <[\u03b30ei(\u03c9t+\u03c6)] as \u03c3(t) = <[G\u2217(\u03c9)\u03b30ei(\u03c9t+\u03c6)], where the viscoelastic spectrum G\u2217(\u03c9) = G\u2032(\u03c9) + iG\u2032\u2032(\u03c9) is proportional to the Fourier transform of G(\u2206t). In aging systems [34], the viscoelastic spectrum generically depends on three arguments: the oscillatory frequency \u03c9, the time t when the\nstress is measured and the waiting time tw. One finds\nG\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw)\n= G(t, tw)e \u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212tw) + i\u03c9 \u222b t tw dt\u2032 G(t, t\u2032)e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t \u2032) (11)\nIn the limit where \u03c9(t \u2212 tw) 1 (many oscillations before the stress measurement) and \u03c9tw 1 (large waiting time), equation (11) may approach the forward spectrum G\u2217f (\u03c9, t). This is calculated by assuming the strain is applied from the measurement time t into the future:\nG\u2217f (\u03c9, t) = i\u03c9 \u222b \u221e t dt\u2032 G(t\u2032, t)e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t \u2032) (12)\nWe will show, both numerically and analytically (in App. D), that this limiting behaviour holds in our elastoplastic model. Note that generally we also require the condition \u03c9 1/\u03c4pl to stay within the range of applicability of the model, which does not include e.g. dissipative effects from solvent viscosity that would become relevant at higher frequencies.\nFinally, we propose an alternative approach for numerically calculating the aging frequency response G\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw), which helps to reduce oscillations that appear when using directly the original expression (11). This approach is inspired by experimental work [35\u201337] and is closer to how the frequency response is measured in reality, where one needs to measure the relative phase and amplitude across several periods. We take the stress signal \u03c3(t) and correlate it with the strain signal \u03b3(t) over a time window of m periods around an observation time t . We denote this averaged response by G\u0304\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw)\nG\u0304\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) = \u03c9\nm\u03c0\u03b30 \u222b t+m\u03c0\u03c9 t\u2212m\u03c0\u03c9 dt\u2032 \u03c3(t\u2032)e\u2212i(\u03c9t \u2032+\u03c6) (13)\nwhere as usual G\u0304\u2217 can be separated into G\u0304\u2217 = G\u0304\u2032+ iG\u0304\u2032\u2032. If we then express \u03c3(t) in terms of the unaveraged moduli G\u2217 = G\u2032 + iG\u2032\u2032, the above expression becomes:\nG\u0304\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) = \u03c9\nm\u03c0 (\u222b t+m\u03c0\u03c9 t\u2212m\u03c0\u03c9 dt\u2032 ( cos(\u03c9t\u2032 + \u03c6)2G\u2032(\u03c9, t\u2032, tw)\u2212 1 2 sin(2(\u03c9t\u2032 + \u03c6))G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9, t\u2032, tw) )\n+ i \u222b t+m\u03c0\u03c9 t\u2212m\u03c0\u03c9 dt\u2032 ( sin(\u03c9t\u2032 + \u03c6)2G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9, t\u2032, tw)\u2212 1 2 sin(2(\u03c9t\u2032 + \u03c6))G\u2032(\u03c9, t\u2032, tw) )) (14)\nThe oscillations in G\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) are of frequency \u03c9 (see also Fig. 20 in App. D). They are thus orthogonal to the constant and 2\u03c9 kernels in the averaging formula above, and therefore no longer present in the resulting averaged\nmoduli.\nTo calculate G\u0304\u2217 in practice, we express it directly in terms of the age-dependent relaxation function G(t, t\u2032). In order to simplify this expression we make a partic-\n5 ular choice for the phase of the strain signal \u03b3(t) = <[\u03b30ei(\u03c9t+\u03c6)], fixing \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c9tw \u2212 \u03c0/2. This ensures\nthat \u03b3(t) = \u03b30 sin (\u03c9(t\u2212 tw)) and hence that the applied strain starts continuously from zero, leading to the simplified result [38]\nG\u0304\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) = \u03c9\nm\u03c0 \u222b t+m\u03c0\u03c9 t\u2212m\u03c0\u03c9 dt\u2032 [ sin (\u03c9(t\u2032 \u2212 tw)) + i cos (\u03c9(t\u2032 \u2212 tw)) ] \u222b t\u2032 tw dt\u2032\u2032 G(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) \u03c9 cos (\u03c9(t\u2032\u2032 \u2212 tw)) (15)\nwhich we will use for the numerical results shown in Sec.

            "text": "Before we turn to analyse the aging linear response in detail, we give a brief overview of the analytical results, highlighting universal features that are independent of the noise exponent \u00b5. Here and in the following, we set \u03c3c = 1 and \u03c4pl = 1, providing the stress and time units. In addition, without loss of generality we set G0 = 1, so that G(tw, tw) = 1. This is not a choice of stress units (the unit of stress being set by the yield threshold); rather it represents a numerical constant that can simply be absorbed into the applied strain. The amount of stress that has been relaxed up to time t, due to plastic events, can then be written as\nG(tw, tw)\u2212G(t, tw) = 1\u2212G(t, tw) (16)\n= \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u03c3 (\u03b4P (\u03c3, tw)\u2212 \u03b4P (\u03c3, t)) d\u03c3\nwhere in the second line we have used (10) and the normalisation of \u03c3 \u03b4P (\u03c3, tw) stemming from (9). We will denote the total (asymptotic) amount of stress the system is able to relax as\n1\u2212G\u221e(tw) \u2261 1\u2212G(t\u2192\u221e, tw) (17)\nFor a system which is able to relax fully, this quantity is thus unity.\nThe intuition behind our analytical results is given mainly by the following argument. Both in steady state and in aging, after the step strain is applied the relaxation is at first purely confined to two small symmetric regions around the boundaries \u03c3 = \u00b11. The two symmetric boundary layers make an equal contribution to the ensuing stress relaxation, so for the following discussion we focus on the positive boundary layer around \u03c3 = 1, corresponding to 1 \u2212 \u03c3 1. In this region, blocks are close enough to instability so that their stress can diffuse across the boundary set by the yield threshold in the short time regime, and a significant decay in \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) takes place. More precisely, up to a time t we expect the diffusion due to mechanical noise to result in a stress\nscale\n\u2206\u03c3 \u223c (\u222b t\ntw\n\u0393(t\u2032)dt\u2032 )H\n(18)\ngiven by the Hurst exponent H = 1/\u00b5, and the corresponding form of the yield rate \u0393(t). From (16), this means that (assuming \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) has decayed enough, see also App. C) the amount of stress relaxed up to time t is essentially given by the integral of the initial condition \u03b4P (\u03c3, tw) over the range of stress \u2206\u03c3 below the yield threshold (note that \u03c3 \u2248 1 in this range).\nWe recall that this initial condition is given by the derivative of the unperturbed distribution (9). Now, both the unperturbed steady state close to the arrest transition, and the unperturbed aging distribution at long times (\u0393(t) 1), display a pseudogap behaviour P0(\u03c3, tw) \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03c3)\u00b5/2 for 1 \u2212 \u03c3 1 (see Sec. II). This means that the initial condition for the stress distribution perturbation has the scaling \u03b4P (\u03c3, tw) \u223c (1\u2212\u03c3)\u00b5/2\u22121 (see Fig. 3). To find the amount of stress relaxation, we need to integrate this over the scale \u2206\u03c3, so that\n1\u2212G(t, tw) \u223c \u2206\u03c3 \u00b5 2 \u223c (\u222b t tw \u0393(t\u2032)dt\u2032 ) 1 2 \u2200\u00b5 (19)\n6 Remarkably, then, the exponent 1/2 relating the amount of stress relaxation to the number of yield events is universal across all values of the exponent \u00b5.\nThe detailed analytical results in the time domain \u2013 derived below \u2013 are displayed in Table I and can be related to the intuitive arguments above as follows. In the aging regime, the integral on the right hand side of (19) converges to a finite value. The relaxation is therefore confined to a range of stresses near the yield threshold and does not extend to the remainder or \u201cbulk\u201d of the stress distribution at long times. Thus the system is not able to relax the stress caused by the initial shear strain completely; instead the stress decays to a finite plateau.\nFor the steady state near the arrest transition, where \u0393(t) = \u0393ss 1, Eq. (19) implies an anomalous relaxation 1\u2212G(\u2206t) \u223c \u2206t1/2 at short times. This eventually gives way to an exponential relaxation characteristic of a Maxwell fluid (see App. A for details). In the case of critical aging, treated in App. B, the relaxation does extend to the bulk at long times but is given by a power-law decay instead of an exponential. Turning to the frequency domain, results for which are displayed in Table II, the ubiquity of the exponent 1/2 is evident in the behaviour of the loss modulus; as explained below, this simply mirrors the short time behaviour in the time domain.\nWe saw above that the exponent H\u00b5/2 = 1/2 characterising the relaxation of stresses near the yield threshold is universal, i.e. independent of the exponent \u00b5 characterising the noise distribution. Interestingly, this universality can be traced back to a link between exponents of self-affine processes first proposed in [39]. The exponent \u00b5/2 (denoted \u03c6 in [39]) characterises the behaviour near an absorbing boundary, the yield threshold. This is related to the persistence exponent \u03b8, which describes the algebraic decay \u223c t\u2212\u03b8 of the probability of no return to an initial value, through \u03b8 = H\u00b5/2. The persistence exponent \u03b8, in turn, can be shown via the Sparre-Andersen theorem [40, 41] to take the universal value \u03b8 = 1/2 for any random walk with a symmetric jump distribution. This corresponds to the 1/2 exponent we will find throughout the present analysis, albeit without the interpretation in terms of persistence."

We now explore the consequences of this using the same intuitive argument as in Sec. IV, referring the reader to App. C for a more detailed analysis of the full stress distribution perturbation \u03b4P (\u03c3, t). As already noted in Sec.

For the shorter waiting times up to tw = 200 we include pre-asymptotic effects by using the full form of \u0393(t) measured in the unperturbed dynamics before it enters the asymptotic power law (at around t ' 400), while for longer waiting times we use directly a fit of the asymptotic behaviour of \u0393(t) [43]. Plotting the resulting stress relaxation 1 \u2212 G vs t \u2212 tw, while rescaling the time axis by tw and the stress relaxation axis by the appropriate power of tw from (21), we find that the rescaled curves practically collapse onto each other and show very good agreement with the asymptotic expression (20) for tw = 200 and above (see Fig. 4).

The value of B is fitted from the unperturbed dynamics, which in this case enters the stretched exponential regime already for t & 20 [44] so that there are no pre-asymptotic corrections from \u0393(t), and we study a range of waiting times from tw = 20 to 100. We find essentially perfect agreement with the finite-tw form in (23), which approaches the asymptotic expression for tw \u2192 \u221e (25) as tw increases. This approach can be shown from (23) and (25) to be monotonic, with the leading order correction decaying as \u223c t\u22121/2w ."

It is important to note that although (26) and (22) look similar, the rescaled frequency w is different in the two cases. The shared w\u22121/2 behaviour is a genuine commonality, on the other hand, stemming as it does from the universality discussed in Sec. IV.\nFinally, we numerically compute the aging frequency response, using again the averaged form (15), for the case \u00b5 = 1, A = 0.55 considered above. We choose m = 1, so that we average over one period around the observation time. In contrast to the case 1 < \u00b5 < 2, where results were independent of m (for m = 2, 4), here the averaging is sensitive to m due to the rapidly decaying magnitude 1\u2212G\u221e(t), which leads to a bias in the results for larger m. For m = 1, we see in Fig. 7 that the loss modulus does indeed approach the asymptotic form (26) after enough oscillations.\nVI. (WEAKLY) NON-LINEAR BEHAVIOUR (\u00b5 = 1)\nWe next study numerically the non-linear response to step strain of the model. This will allow us to check that the linear theory developed so far does indeed hold for \u03b30 1, and will also shed light on the extent of this linear regime. Furthermore, the predictions we will obtain for the non-linear effects will in themselves be interesting for the comparison to the MD data in Sec. VII.\nThe non-linear, strain and age-dependent response function to a step strain \u03b30 \u03b8(t\u2212 tw) is written as\n\u03c3(t) = \u03b30G(t, tw; \u03b30) (27)\nwhich defines the nonlinear stress relaxation function G(t, tw; \u03b30). In order for our discussion to be relevant also to the MD simulations presented in Sec. VII we focus on \u00b5 = 1, with a slightly higher value of the coupling (A = 0.58) than the one shown in Fig. 6. This provides us with a wider time range (up to around t = 400) in which\n9\nto study aging properties before the yield rate becomes too small to resolve numerically.\nWe now consider a range of waiting times within this asymptotic regime, and study the non-linear response to a range of step strains. To do this, we now evolve the full master equation (1) after application of a step strain. In our discrete numerical setup, this amounts to shifting the initial distribution P0(\u03c3, tw) by a number of grid points \u03b30/\u2206\u03c3, where \u2206\u03c3 is the stress discretisation. The smallest step amplitude we can reliably explore is then some small multiple of \u2206\u03c3, in our case \u03b30 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (corresponding to 4 \u2206\u03c3). Importantly, in the ensuing dynamics \u0393(t) is perturbed by the strain, in contrast to the linear theory where \u0393(t) = \u03930(t).\nIn Fig. 8 we show the non-linear response function for a range of strains \u03b30 \u2208 (5 \u00d7 10\u22124, 5 \u00d7 10\u22122), for two waiting times tw = 100 and tw = 300. On the same plot, we display also the prediction from the linear theory for each tw, evaluated by solving Eq. (8) using as input the unperturbed \u03930(t). One notices first that for both waiting times, the smallest step strain amplitudes do indeed give a response function that matches the prediction of the linear theory. However, we see clearly that for the later waiting time more of the strain step values deviate from linear response. In other words, the extent of the linear regime shrinks considerably at later waiting times. To study this more in detail, we take the measured asymptotic relaxations for each tw and interpolate them to obtain 1\u2212G\u221e(tw; \u03b30) as a function of \u03b30 (see Fig. 22 in App. F). From here we identify the linear regime as extending up to \u03b3max(tw), which we define by setting a threshold (10 %) on the relative deviation of the amount of stress relaxation with respect to the linear value; fixing a threshold for the relative deviations of the plateaus G\u221e(tw, \u03b30) themselves leads to similar results.\nA naive expectation for the scaling of \u03b3max(tw) would be to consider the initial perturbation to the yield rate caused by the step strain, which (see below) is of order \u223c \u03b31+\u00b5/20 = \u03b3 3/2 0 . For the linear regime one then expects the condition \u03b3 3/2 0 \u0393(tw) and hence the scaling \u03b3max(tw) \u223c (\u0393(tw))2/3. In Fig. 23 in App. F we show that the measured \u03b3max(tw) agrees well with this prediction.\nWe now proceed to study the non-linear effects on the total amount of relaxation at long times, and on the temporal evolution of the rescaled relaxation function, which we recall saturates at this final value. In Sec. V we derived analytical expressions for the linear response limit of both of these quantities, given in (24) and (23), respectively.\nStarting with the plateau at which the relaxation saturates, we first point out a qualitative difference in the non-linear case. For finite \u03b30, there is now a non-zero stress relaxation even for tw \u2192 \u221e, where the stress distribution is frozen and all blocks are stable, so that G\u221e(tw \u2192 \u221e; \u03b30) < 1. To account for this, in Fig. 9 we rescale the plateau values by the tw \u2192 \u221e plateau, so that we plot 1\u2212G\u221e(tw; \u03b30)/G\u221e(tw \u2192\u221e; \u03b30), which by construction does decay to zero with increasing tw for all \u03b30. As expected, the values from the linear regime agree well with the prediction (24), using for B the value B0 extracted from the unperturbed numerics \u03930 \u223c e\u2212B0 \u221a t. Surprisingly, we see that also the data for non-linear \u03b30 (shown are four values up to \u03b30 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123) are well described by the expression (24), but with a higher \u201ceffective\u201d value of B that we denote Beff . Beff increases with \u03b30, implying that the final plateau value for tw \u2192\u221e is approached already at shorter waiting times for larger step strains.\nThe final plateau value and the corresponding stress relaxation 1 \u2212 G\u221e(tw \u2192 \u221e; \u03b30) are purely non-linear features, because in the linear theory \u03930(tw \u2192 \u221e) = 0 and no more relaxation takes place. We can construct a lower bound on 1 \u2212 G\u221e(tw \u2192 \u221e; \u03b30) in the following way. Neglecting the effect of stress redistribution, which can trigger additional yield events, we can consider the proportion of blocks that are made unstable by the initial step strain \u03b30. These lie in the stress interval \u03c3 \u2208 (1 \u2212 \u03b30, 1). The distribution P0(\u03c3, tw) behaves as P0 \u223c q0(1\u2212 \u03c3)\u00b5/2 for \u03c3 . 1, giving to leading order in \u03b30 a stress relaxation\n1\u2212G\u221e(tw \u2192\u221e; \u03b30) & q0 1\n1 + \u00b5/2 \u03b3 \u00b5/2 0 (28)\nThe same argument also shows that the perturbation to the yield rate is \u223c \u03b31+\u00b5/20 , as given above. Our data do indeed lie above this lower bound, and approach it as \u03b30 \u2192 0 (see Fig. 24 in App. F).\nFinally, we turn to the temporal evolution of the relaxation function. We show this in Fig. 10 for tw = 300 and the same four values of \u03b30 as above, along with the linear response. In each case we rescale the stress by the final plateau value, and the time as x = (t \u2212 tw)/ \u221a tw.\nIn this representation, the linear response indeed follows the expression (23) for H(x, tw) derived in Sec. V, with the same value of B0. Interestingly, even the non-linear relaxations can be fitted very well by the same expression (23), but (as for the plateau decay) with a higher Beff value, which again increases for larger \u03b30 so that larger step strains accelerate the dynamics. We note that, unlike in the linear theory, in the non-linear case the Beff(\u03b30) values inferred from the plateau decays do not necessarily have to describe also the full dynamics. For later waiting times (as is the case shown in Fig. 10), however, we find that the same Beff(\u03b30) values fitted from the plateau decays do in fact provide a good fit for the full time evolution at each step strain \u03b30.\nSummarising, we have found that the extent of the linear regime shrinks considerably at later waiting times. However, we have also found that even in the (weakly) non-linear case, both the plateau decay and the stress dynamics are still well described by the linear theory through (24) and (23), but with effective constants Beff(\u03b30) > B0. We therefore see that the application of non-linear step strains effectively leads to faster dynamics. The same effect will be observed in the MD simulations discussed in the following section."

            "text": "We now compare our mean field prediction to molecular dynamics simulations of a model athermal solid. For this we consider a bidisperse assembly of soft harmonic spheres at high packing fraction \u03c6 = 1 (well above jamming), immersed in an effective solvent. This model has been used widely in the literature [45], and is consid-\n11\nered an appropriate description of, for example, dense emulsions, foams or microgels suspensions comprising droplets, bubbles or particles of typical radius R & 1\u00b5m, in the athermal regime [17]. Neglecting inertia and explicit hydrodynamic interactions, the unperturbed dynamics of the system, starting from an initial condition with significant overlap between the spheres, is simply a gradient descent in the energy landscape. This dissipative dynamics was studied in [17] (see also [18]), where it was shown to present a slow (power\u2013law) decay of the energy and velocity, which was referred to as athermal aging. Here we study the linear response of the system to a step strain at different waiting times tw during this aging process; further simulation details may be found in App. E.\nAn important difference in the particle system is that even mechanically stable (frozen) system configurations, which are reached for tw \u2192 \u221e (in our simulations, this limit is reached at tw \u2248 5\u00d7105) show a finite stress relaxation; see Fig. 21 in App. E. In fact, for any tw there is always a non-affine relaxation, simply due to the particles recovering a state of force balance after the application of the step strain. This reversible non-affine motion can be expressed analytically in terms of the Hessian of the current energy minimum following [5], given that at small strain it does not involve any plastic yielding. However, for this same reason it is not accounted for within our elastoplastic description (see more in the discussion). To be able to compare with our theory, we therefore need to factor out this non-affine relaxation and focus only on the relaxation due to plastic events.\nIn the case of the plateau values, which we consider first, this is taken care of automatically by proceeding as in the evaluation of the theory (Fig. 9): we rescale by the tw = \u221e relaxation, considering again 1 \u2212 G\u221e(tw, \u03b30)/G\u221e(tw = \u221e, \u03b30) for various values of the step strain (see Fig. 11). For all \u03b30 we fit the analytical form (24), extracting an effective value of B in each\ncase. We see that, on the one hand, the data agree well with the (modulated) stretched exponential form (24) in all cases; on the other hand, we find the same trend as in mean field, with the effective B increasing with the strain \u03b30.\nWe next turn to the full temporal dynamics of the stress relaxation function. Here, we need firstly to account for the tw = \u221e relaxation, which we assume is purely due to the non-affine part. We denote this as Gna(\u2206t), formally defined as limtw\u2192\u221eG(tw+\u2206t, tw). We then consider the ratio between the full stress relaxation function and the non-affine relaxation purely due to the recovery of force balance:\nGpl(t, tw) \u2261 G(t, tw)\nGna(t\u2212 tw) , (29)\nwith Gna(\u2206t) \u2261 lim tw\u2192\u221e G(tw + \u2206t, tw)\nso that for an infinitely aged system, Gpl = 1 and the response is purely elastic as in our mean field model (for small applied strain).\nWe show the result for \u03b30 = 5\u00d710\u22123 in Fig. 12. For the plot we rescale 1 \u2212 Gpl(t, tw) by the asymptotic plastic relaxation 1\u2212Gpl\u221e(tw) corresponding to each tw, in order to compare with the rescaled form (23) of the theoretical prediction, which we recall varies from 0 to 1. We find a very good collapse of the curves by rescaling the time axis as (t\u2212 tw)/ \u221a tw. More importantly, the asymptotic form of (23) for large tw fits excellently the data, with the corresponding value of B fitted from the plateau decay (see Fig. 11).\nOverall, figures 11 and 12 point to a good agreement with the theory for \u00b5 = 1. We show here only the temporal data for \u03b30 = 5\u00d7 10\u22123, obtained by averaging over Nrep = 128 repetitions. For the smaller step strains, at large waiting times, even with Nrep = 1280 the numerical signal is not clear enough to study the full stress relaxation up to our largest tw. For \u03b30 = 10\n\u22123 we nonetheless find a similar collapse to Fig. 12, with the corresponding\n12\nvalue of Beff from Fig. 11, at least up to tw = 2 \u00d7 104. This supports the expectation that the results in Fig. 12 should also be representative of the behaviour for smaller step strain values, the only difference being the slightly slower dynamics (smaller B)."

            "heading": "VIII. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK",
            "text": "In this paper we have studied the aging linear shear response within the framework of a mean field elastoplastic model of amorphous solids, introduced previously in [26]. The main feature of this model was the incorporation of mechanical noise due to stress propagation, which was argued to be power-law distributed with exponent \u00b5. Here, we have found analytically the long-time form of the aging step response G(t, tw) for the different values of \u00b5, along with the aging frequency response; these are summarised in Tables I and II. The theoretical predictions for \u00b5 = 1, which is the exponent describing the physical elastic propagator, were then compared against data from MD simulations of a model athermal system in its aging regime, finding good correspondence with the theory. In the following discussion, we first discuss separately the theoretical results in the context of other aging phenomena, before commenting further on the comparison to the MD simulation and to possible experiments.\nFrom a purely theoretical perspective, it is interesting to compare the athermal aging response found here with \u201cclassical\u201d aging phenomena, studied particularly in spin glasses [23]. As in [34], we refer to the step strain response in our model as aging due to the fact that the stress relaxation takes place on timescales that grow with the age tw of the system. An important difference, however, is that our results cannot be fitted to the general form advocated by Cugliandolo and Kurchan [46], where G(t, tw) = G[h(t)/h(tw)], h(t) being an effective clock.\nThis is due to several key assumptions in [46] that are violated here. For starters, our model does not have weak long-term memory, nor is the response function related to any correlation function. Weak long-term memory refers to the property that if a perturbation (in this case, a step strain) is applied for a short time and then turned off, the system is able to forget this perturbation asymptotically. This is not the case here, due to the incomplete relaxation which leads to frozen-in stress. This is all in contrast with the soft glassy rheology model [34, 47, 48], where the yielding through effective activation always leads to full relaxation at long times (thus ensuring weak longterm memory), and the aging response can be cast into the Cugliandolo-Kurchan form [46].\nTurning to the comparison with the model athermal suspension considered in Sec. VII, it would firstly be interesting to extend our elastoplastic description in order to account for the non-affine relaxation, which we recall we removed from the data for our comparison. Presumably, what would need to be added to our current picture is the heterogeneity of elastic moduli in the material, which would imply the system falls out of force balance after application of a step strain.\nIn order to connect further the mesoscopic model to the model particle system, an obvious route would be to study in detail the statistics of plastic events within the MD simulations. An important detail we left aside in Sec. VII concerns the evolution of the system properties during the aging process: as studied in [17], for later times the root mean square velocity decreases, and the active \u201chotspots\u201d where non-affine relaxation occurs grow in size. One may then also expect the parameters of the corresponding elastoplastic model not to be constant. In fact, by considering the squared ratio of the constants B measured in MD and mean field, it is in principle possible to infer the value of \u03c4pl in MD time units. Given that the coupling A is also unknown, we may take a range of B values measured in the mean field model (B = 0.4 to 1.7, as A is decreased), which along with the simulation value B \u2248 0.037 in Fig. 12 would yield \u03c4pl \u2208 (123, 2000) in MD time units. It would be interesting to measure the plastic timescale in the MD simulation and check whether it lies in the above-mentioned range, and stays roughly constant at least for the range of waiting times in Fig. 12.\nAnother avenue for exploring the mesoscopic assumptions of the elastoplastic model would be to employ a frozen-matrix method [49] as in [50, 51], to obtain direct information on the full local stress distributions. Although the results in Sec. VII, in particular the good fits of the plateau and stress dynamics with the same value of B shown in Figs. 11 and 12, already provide good support for the boundary layer dynamics described here, probing the distributions themselves would of course provide stronger evidence, and would shed more light on further questions such as the value of the coupling A.\nAs regards experiments, it would certainly be interesting to compare the theory with measurements on aging suspensions. Carbopol microgels [52, 53], for instance,\n13\nwhich are considered to be prototypical of athermal dynamics, could be a good candidate. Linear viscoelastic moduli in these systems would be interesting to measure, as was done in [35\u201337] for a class of thermosensitive suspensions, whose behaviour could be captured by the predictions of the soft glassy rheology model.\nIn future work on the modelling side, one aspect that could be studied is the behaviour for \u00b5 < 1. We expect this to be physically less relevant, and not to present genuine aging, but the mathematical analysis could generate interesting insights into how the scalings presented in Sec. IV, in particular Eq. (18), break down for \u00b5 < 1. An obvious direction for extending the model would be to study the effect of disorder on the aging described here and in [26]. This could be done by introducing a distribution \u03c1(\u03c3c) of yield barriers as in [16, 29]; in this way there would be aging not only in stress, but also as a result of mesoscopic regions transitioning to deeper energy minima with higher yield barriers."

            "text": "We first consider here the linear response in the steady state regime, where as explained in Sec. III we expect TTI to hold. We discuss first the HL case (\u00b5 = 2), where insight may be gained through analytical arguments. Although some expressions for the steady state linear frequency response are provided in the original paper [54], we focus here on the critical behaviour approaching the arrest transition. As \u03b1c is approached from above, the diffusive dynamics of the local stress becomes more and more sluggish with the yield rate disappearing quadratically as \u0393ss \u223c (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1c)2 [26, 29], meaning there are fewer plastic rearrangements to fluidise the system. In the limit where \u0393ss \u2192 0, one may replace the yielding term in equation (8) by absorbing boundary conditions at \u03c3 = \u00b11. One can then map the problem to that of a diffusing particle in a box (see also [26]), which can be solved by the technique of separation of variables. Given the antisymmetry of \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) described in Sec. III, the solution is given by the asymmetric eigenmodes. Rescaling the time difference (we recall \u2206t = t \u2212 tw) by the yield rate as \u2206t\u0303 = \u2206t\u0393, we find\nG(\u2206t\u0303) = 8\n\u03c02 \u2211 m,odd 1 m2 e\u2212\u03b1m 2\u03c02\u2206t\u0303 (A1)\nThis stress relaxation function separates into two different relaxation regimes. This is shown in Figs. 13 and 14 where, along with the exact limiting form (A1), we plot the results of numerically integrating equation (8) for values of \u0393ss between 10\u22122 and 10\u22125, starting from the steady state and using a pseudospectral method (for details see App. E.1 of [26]). At long times the relaxation is dominated by the slowest asymmetric eigenmode with absorbing boundary conditions, whose eigenvalue we write as \u03bb (2) 1 for \u00b5 = 2. For \u2206t\u0303 \u03c4\u0303 with \u03c4\u0303 = 1/(\u03b1\u03bb (2) 1 ) \u2248 2/\u03c02 one then finds an exponential relaxation (Fig. 13). On the other hand, in the short time regime \u0393 \u2206t\u0303 \u03c4\u0303 , we find that 1 \u2212 G(\u2206t\u0303) \u223c (\u2206t\u0303)1/2 (Fig. 14), reflecting the singular behaviour of the summation (A1).\nLooking next at the viscoelastic behaviour for \u00b5 = 2 in the frequency domain, we know from Eq. (A1) that with a rescaled frequency \u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9/\u0393, the viscoelastic moduli in\n14\nthe limit \u0393\u2192 0 are given by\nG\u2217(\u03c9\u0303) = G\u2032(\u03c9\u0303) + iG\u2032\u2032(\u03c9\u0303) (A2)\n= 8 \u2211 m,odd\n1\n\u03b12m4\u03c04 + \u03c9\u03032\n( \u03c9\u03032\n\u03c02m2 + i\u03b1\u03c9\u0303 ) Reflecting the behaviour in the time domain, this results in a loss modulus G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9\u0303) peaked at \u03c9\u0303 \u223c \u03c4\u0303\u22121, with a nonMaxwellian behaviour G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9\u0303) \u223c \u03c9\u0303\u22121/2 (as mentioned in [54]) for \u03c4\u0303\u22121 < \u03c9\u0303 < 1/\u0393 (see dotted line in Fig. 15). The same power law in this range of frequencies also appears in the elastic modulus as 1\u2212G\u2032(\u03c9\u0303) \u223c \u03c9\u0303\u22121/2.\nWe now turn to study other values of the noise exponent 0 < \u00b5 < 2. For convenience we do this in the frequency domain, where, instead of solving each time the PDE (8), we can compute the viscoelastic spectrum directly by diagonalising a discretised form [55] of the operator on the right of (8); for details see App. E.2 in [26]. The results are shown in Figure 15, where we consider values of \u0393ss = 0.134, 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 and consider a range of different \u00b5.\nThe surprising and a priori unexpected result in Fig. 15 is that the moduli show the same form also for \u00b5 < 2, with the same power lawG\u2032\u2032(\u03c9\u0303) \u223c \u03c9\u0303\u22121/2 for the loss modulus. With hindsight this simply mirrors the behaviour in the short time regime, which as argued in Sec. IV turns out to have the universal form 1\u2212G(\u2206t) \u223c \u2206t1/2 for all \u00b5."

            "text": "We consider for completeness the special case of a relaxation at precisely the critical value of the coupling A = Ac (or \u03b1 = \u03b1c in the HL model), which we refer to as critical aging. As discussed briefly in [26], one finds\nfrom the analysis for 1 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 2 that the yield rate decays as \u0393(t) \u223c 1/t, irrespective of the value of \u00b5. For the short time regime (Fig. 16), following the same arguments as in Sec. IV, this implies an initial relaxation \u2013 arising from stress diffusion near the yield threshold \u2013\ngrowing as 1\u2212G(t, tw) \u223c (\u222b t\ntw \u0393(t\u2032)dt\u2032\n)1/2 . This can be\nwritten in terms of the scaling variable x = (t \u2212 tw)/tw, so that one has simple aging and\n1\u2212G \u223c \u221a ln(1 + x) for x 1 (B1)\nFor the yield rate at criticality, one expects that in fact the prefactor of the asymptotic behaviour \u0393(t) \u223c d1(\u00b5)/t will be initial condition independent for a given \u00b5, given that the total number of yield events (given by the integral of \u0393(t)) diverges and so all memory of the initial condition is lost. In fact, as we will show now for the HL model, this prefactor is related to the lowest asymmetric eigenvalue \u03bb (\u00b5) 1 of the \u00b5-dependent propagator with absorbing boundary conditions at |\u03c3| = 1, by the relation d1(\u00b5) = 1/(\u00b5\u03bb (\u00b5) 1 ). The boundary conditions are nonlocal for \u00b5 < 2, i.e. must be imposed for all |\u03c3| > 1 [56]; the eigenvalue \u03bb\n(\u00b5) 1 is defined in Eq. (B8) below.\nIn the HL case \u00b5 = 2, we can show this link on the basis of the scaling analysis in [33]. For the case of a relaxation at \u03b1 = \u03b1c, the exponent parameters in [33] take the values l = 1 and s = 2. The frozen-in distribution, on the other hand, acquires a simple form composed of two line segments, Q0(\u03c3) = 1\u2212|\u03c3|. The leading order corrections in the interior (|\u03c3| < 1) and in the exterior (|\u03c3| > 1; where the right and left exterior tails are symmetric, we write only the right one, i.e. \u03c3 > 1) are given by\nP (\u03c3, t) = Q0(\u03c3) + t \u2212 12Q1(\u03c3) |\u03c3| < 1 (B2) P (\u03c3, t) = t\u2212 1 2R1(z) \u03c3 > 1 (B3)\nwith z = t1/2(\u03c3 \u2212 1). Continuity of the distribution and its derivative imply the boundary conditions\nQ1(1) = R1(0) (B4) \u2202\u03c3Q0(1) = \u2202zR1(0) = \u22121 (B5)\nWe consider now the master equation (3) in the exterior, with \u03b1 = \u03b1c = 1/2 and \u0393(t) = d1/t. Applying also the boundary condition (B5), we have that R1(z) = \u221a d1e \u2212z/ \u221a d1 . From the master equation in the interior, we find that\n\u22022\u03c3Q1(\u03c3) + \u03bbQ1(\u03c3) = 0 (B6)\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 1/(2d1). The boundary condition (B4) implies that Q1(\u22121) = Q1(1) = \u221a d1. Furthermore, normalisation of P (\u03c3, t) requires that \u222b Q1d\u03c3 = 0, so that integration of (B6) yields \u2202\u03c3Q1(\u22121) = \u2202\u03c3Q1(1). Altogether, Eq. (B6) and the boundary conditions imply that \u03bb = m2\u03c02, m \u2208 N. Given that we are dealing with the first correction, we expect m = 1 so that \u03bb = \u03bb\n(2) 1 , and\ntherefore d1 = 1/(2\u03bb (2) 1 ). For 1 \u2264 \u00b5 < 2 the leading\n15\norder correction scales as P = Q0 + t \u22121/\u00b5Q1, so that one expects d1 = 1/(\u00b5\u03bb (\u00b5) 1 ) from the same analysis. We confirm this only numerically as a full derivation would be difficult due to the presence of non-local boundary conditions.\nWe now show how the prefactor d1(\u00b5) leads to the long-time difference (x 1) scaling of the stress relaxation function G(x) \u223c x\u22121/\u00b5. The perturbation \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) follows the dynamics (8), which in the interior reads\n\u2202t\u03b4P (\u03c3, t) = d1(\u00b5)\nt \u222b \u03c3+\u03b4\u03c3u \u03c3\u2212\u03b4\u03c3u \u03b4P (\u03c3\u2032, t)\u2212 \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) |\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u2032|1+\u00b5 d\u03c3\u2032\n(B7) At long times we expect (as in the case A > Ac in App. A) the stress profile to be dominated by the slowest asymmetric eigenmode \u03c81(\u03c3), so that \u03b4P (\u03c3, t 1) \u2248 f(t)\u03c81(\u03c3) where \u03c81(\u03c3) satisfies\u222b \u03c3+\u03b4\u03c3u\n\u03c3\u2212\u03b4\u03c3u\n\u03c81(\u03c3 \u2032)\u2212 \u03c81(\u03c3)\n|\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u2032|1+\u00b5 d\u03c3\u2032 = \u2212\u03bb(\u00b5)1 \u03c81(\u03c3) (B8)\nwith \u03c81(\u03c3) = 0 \u2200 |\u03c3| > 1, i.e. absorbing boundary conditions. Inserting the ansatz into (B7), we find using d1(\u00b5)\u03bb (\u00b5) 1 = 1/\u00b5\n\u2202 ln f \u2202 ln t = \u2212 1 \u00b5 (B9)\nso that \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) ' \u03c81(\u03c3)t\u22121/\u00b5 at long times. Considering (from the short time regime) that we have simple aging, this implies G(x) \u223c x\u22121/\u00b5 in the long time regime as claimed.\nIn Figs. 16 and 17 we show stress relaxation functions obtained for a range of tw, for a system relaxing at Ac(\u00b5) from an initial distribution with enough unstable blocks at t = 0. We then evolve Eq. (8) to find the aging stress relaxation function. For x 1, we see from Fig. 17 that indeed G(x) \u223c x\u22121/\u00b5. Interestingly, a power-law stress relaxation was also found at the jamming transition point in the particle simulations of [57], with a critical behaviour G(t) \u223c t\u22121/2 (which would be recovered for \u00b5 = 2). It is important, however, to note that in [57] the step response is studied starting from initial conditions that have already fully relaxed to mechanical equilibrium (via an energy minimization algorithm), whereas here we are considering the stress response during the physical relaxation process towards this inherent state."

            "text": "We give more details here regarding the scaling of the stress distribution perturbation \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) that leads to the result (20) for the stress relaxation function. First of all, as in Sec. IV we may write Eq. (10) as\n1\u2212G(t, tw) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u03c3 (\u03b4P (\u03c3, tw)\u2212 \u03b4P (\u03c3, t)) d\u03c3 (C1)\nIn the aging regime, \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) is practically frozen in the interior [58] |\u03c3| < 1 away from \u03c3 = 1, while the relaxation in the exterior tails |\u03c3| > 1 will be shown below to be subleading. The leading contribution to the integral (C1) will come from two symmetric interior boundary layers, on the left and the right. Focusing on the positive one at \u03c3 = 1, we introduce as a division between interior and boundary layer a fixed stress interval such that \u2206\u03c3(tw, x) 1, \u2200tw, x, where \u2206\u03c3(tw, x) is the width of the interior boundary layer at time t = tw(1 + x) for a perturbation applied at tw. The leading contribution to (C1) will then be given by\n1\u2212G ' 2 \u222b 1\n1\u2212 \u03c3 (\u03b4P (\u03c3, tw)\u2212 \u03b4P (\u03c3, t)) d\u03c3 (C2)\nOne expects the difference \u03b4P (\u03c3, tw)\u2212\u03b4P (\u03c3, t) to become a scaling function of the width \u2206\u03c3 within the interior boundary layer. In addition, given that \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) drops significantly within this layer, one expects the height of\n16\nthe function itself to scale as \u2206\u03c3\u00b5/2\u22121, which is inherited from the height of the initial distribution at \u03c3 \u223c 1\u2212\u2206\u03c3; recall that the initial condition of the perturbation scales as \u03b4P (\u03c3, tw) \u223c (1\u2212 \u03c3)\u00b5/2\u22121 near the boundary. We then have that\n1\u2212G ' 2(\u2206\u03c3)\u00b5/2\u22121 \u222b 1\n1\u2212 \u03c3f ( 1\u2212 \u03c3 \u2206\u03c3 ) d\u03c3\n= (\u2206\u03c3)\u00b5/22\n\u222b \u2206\u03c3\n0\nf(z)dz \u2212 (\u2206\u03c3)\u00b5/2+12 \u222b \u2206\u03c3\n0\nzf(z)dz\n(C3)\nwhere we performed the change of variable z = (1 \u2212 \u03c3)/\u2206\u03c3). As \u2206\u03c3 , the -dependence in the integrals disappears and we are left with 1 \u2212 G ' (\u2206\u03c3)\u00b5/2 to leading order, confirming the result (20) given above. In Fig. 18, we check for various values of tw and x (with \u00b5 = 1.7, A = 0.15 as in Fig. 4) the above scaling of \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) in the interior boundary layer, finding a very good collapse.\nFinally, we show that the exterior tail contribution to the integral (C1) is indeed sub-leading. We find that, as in the HL model [33], at a fixed value of x the exterior tails of \u03b4P (\u03c3, t) may be collapsed by rescaling their width and the height by appropriate powers of tw. For the \u03c3-axis, we know already that the distribution \u03b4P (\u03c3, tw) inherits the scaling of the boundary layer in the unperturbed dynamics. There it was shown [26] that \u0393 \u223c t\u2212\u00b5/(\u00b5\u22121), while the boundary layer width scaled as \u03931/\u00b5, so that we expect the exterior tail to have a width that evolves with x on a scale O(t\u22121/(\u00b5\u22121)w ). Turning now to the scaling of the height of the tail \u03b4P (\u03c3, t), we find numerically that the boundary value \u03b4P (1, t), decays as a power law (t\u2212 tw)\u22121/\u00b5 beyond time differences of order unity t \u2212 tw > O(1), i.e. x > O(t\u22121w ), leading to a height evolving with x on a scale t \u22121/\u00b5 w . This is confirmed numerically in Fig. 19 for various values of tw and x, again running the dynamics with \u00b5 = 1.7,\nA = 0.15. Overall, these scalings imply that the contribution from the exterior tail is indeed sub-leading, given that it is of order t \u22121/(\u00b5\u22121)\u22121/\u00b5 w , which is small compared to \u2206\u03c3\u00b5/2 = O(t\u22121/(2(\u00b5\u22121))w ). This holds also as we approach the marginal case \u00b5\u2192 1, as the (negative) exponent of the leading contribution is smaller by a factor of 2."

As shown there, the first\n17\nterm in brackets of (D2) can be included into the integral over w\u2032, with a constant integrand for w\u2032 > wx/(1 + x). As we take the limit wx/(1+x) 1 we are left only with the integral up to infinity of the second term in brackets, which in addition for w 1 converges to the forward spectrum (D3).\nTo find the asymptotic form (22) given in the main text one can exploit the large w-limit imposed above to simplify further. In (D3), one can then expand the argument in the square root as\nf\n( w\u2032\nw\n) = \u221a 1\u2212 ( 1 + w\u2032\nw )\u2212 1\u00b5\u22121 = \u221a 1\n\u00b5\u2212 1\n\u221a w\u2032\nw +O\n( w\u2032\nw\n) (D4)\nwhich leads to the form (22) in the main text. One can proceed similarly for the case \u00b5 = 1, and show that the aging moduli (11) approach the forward spectrum (12), where now the required limits are \u03c9(t \u2212 tw) 1 and w \u2261 \u03c9 \u221a t 1. To compute this forward spectrum, we consider tw large enough for (25) to hold, that is\nG(t, tw) = (1\u2212G\u221e(tw)) \u221a 1\u2212 e\u2212B x2 (D5)\nwith x = (t \u2212 tw)/ \u221a tw. We insert this into (12) and obtain\nGf (\u03c9, t) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212G\u221e(t))i \u222b \u221e\n0\ndw\u2032 \u221a 1\u2212 e\u2212Bw \u2032 2w e\u2212iw \u2032\n(D6) where we performed the change of variables w\u2032 = \u03c9(t\u2212t\u2032), and the rescaled frequency is w \u2261 \u03c9 \u221a t. As was done for 1 < \u00b5 < 2 above, we now expand the square root as\nf\n( w\u2032\nw\n) = \u221a 1\u2212 e\u2212Bw \u2032 2w = \u221a B\n2\n\u221a w\u2032\nw +O\n( w\u2032\nw\n) (D7)\nwhere we have considered again w 1. From here it is straightforward to derive expression (26) in the main text.\nFinally, in Fig. 20 (for the case \u00b5 = 1.7 and A = 0.15 considered in the main text) we compare the averaged form G\u0304\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) computed from (15) with G\n\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) calculated directly from (11). Without the averaging, one sees that G\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw) does still approach the forward spectrum at long times, but presents oscillations around the asymptote with frequency \u03c9. As discussed in the main text and visible in the figure, the averaging cancels these oscillations and the asymptotic form is approached sooner. We note that the growing oscillations for small tw are a numerical artifact due to the highly oscillating integrals."

[20] Athermal gradient descent dynamics has also been studied recently below and close to jamming, both in particle simulations [60, 61] and from the perspective of dynamical mean field theory [62].

[28] In taking the limit \u00b5 \u2192 2, one scales A to zero as A \u223c\n2\u2212\u00b5 so that the second moment of the jump distribution \u03b1eff = A/(2 \u2212 \u00b5) (2A/\u00b5)2/\u00b5\u22121 goes to a finite limiting value \u03b1HL corresponding to the coupling parameter of the HL model.

[38] We note for clarity that this special choice of phase is made solely to simplify the expression (15), and does not in itself contribute to reducing the oscillations in G\u2217(\u03c9, t, tw). The reduction of oscillations is accomplished by the averaging, and is independent of the choice of phase \u03c6. [39] A. Zoia, A. Rosso, and S. N. Majumdar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 120602 (2009).

[42] Here and in what follows we use, as in [26], the steady state with \u0393 = 0.134 as initial distribution for the unperturbed aging dynamics. [43] We note that, as discussed in [26], in the unperturbed numerics the power law asymptote of \u0393(t) is eventually cut off exponentially by the fact that the required discretization of the \u03c3-axis can no longer resolve the boundary layer. [44] As done above for \u00b5 = 1.7, we extrapolate the asymptote of \u0393(t) to later times than we had access to in the unperturbed numerics, due to the same discretisation limit described there (the boundary layer becoming even harder to resolve for \u00b5 = 1).
