    "abstractText": "Six lanthanide complexes constructed from two chiral b-diketonates (D/L-fbc = 3-heptafluorobutyryl(+)/(\u2212)-camphorate), the stilbene derivative (E)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-4-styrylbenzoyl hydrazide (L), a trifluoroacetate anion (CF3CO2 \u2212), and one water molecule, namely [Ln(D/L-fbc)2(L)(CF3CO2)]$H2O (LnC57H54F17N4O8, Ln = La (1, D-fbc), La (2, L-fbc), Sm (3, D-fbc), Eu (4, D-fbc), Eu (5, L-fbc), and Tb (6, Dfbc), were synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, H-NMR, elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The photoisomerization reactions of these complexes were systematically studied by means of experimental and theoretical calculations. Crystals of complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were obtained and belong to the monoclinic crystal system and the C2 chiral space group. The Land D-diastereomers coexist in their crystals and no apparent bisignate couplets are observed in their ECD spectra. Among the complexes, the photocyclization reaction is followed by the trans-to-cis photoisomerization reaction and competes with the trans-to-cis photoisomerization, then the photocyclization reaction continues. The photocyclization reaction is irreversible in this stilbene derivative and is delayed in the lanthanide complexes. These results provide a viable strategy for the design of promising new stilbene-attached dual-functional lanthanide-based optical-switching materials.",

Photoreverting isomerization can stabilize its cis isomer, and this property has application potential for advanced technological applications in molecular electronics and bioimaging.45,46 Therefore, we have focused on designing stilbene derivatives for introduction to lanthanide bdiketonate complexes to obtain regulated luminescence by photo-inducing the structure change of the stilbene group.\nThe as-designed stilbene derivative ligand, N\u2032,N\u2032-bis(pyridin2-ylmethyl)-4-styrylbenzoyl hydrazide (L), is a tetradentate chelating ligand that strongly coordinates with lanthanide ions. L was combined with benzoyltriuoroacetone (Htfd) or 2- thenoyl triuoroacetone (Htta) for co-coordination with lanthanide ions to construct light-stimuli smart complexes.47,48 In our previous studies, it was found that in the stilbene functional group in the lanthanide b-diketonate complexes, its optical properties are inuenced by the f-electron transition of the lanthanide ions. Upon coordination with a lanthanide ion, the electron transition of the stilbene ligand is disturbed, thereby affecting its photochemical reactivity and energy transfer. The energy transfer between stilbene ligands and bdiketone ligands and lanthanide ions can regulate the photochemical reaction of the stilbene ligands and the excited-state lifetime of the lanthanide complexes. It has been shown that the luminescence intensity of europium complexes can be reversibly changed from weak to strong by photoisomerization. However, the complexes can undergo photocyclization reactions, which were not conrmed in previous studies.\nIn order to further understand the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of stilbene-functionalized lanthanide b-diketonate complexes, especially for the purpose of investigating the effect of chirality on the stilbene functional b-diketonate complexes, we studied the chiral b-diketone molecule 3- (peruorobutyryl)-camphor in combination with the stilbene\n2270 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 2269\u20132282\nderivative ligand L to construct chiral lanthanide (Ln = La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+) complexes. We observed that the photocyclization reaction is followed by trans-to-cis photoisomerization. Detailed knowledge on the effect of chirality on the trans-to-cis photoisomerization and luminescence properties of the complexes functionalized with stilbene is crucial. These research results provide important theoretical guidance and an experimental basis for the design and synthesis of stilbene-based light-stimuli materials for application to information storage and encryption, molecular switches, anticounterfeiting, and bio-imprinting."

The absorption peak of the ligand L at 319 nm can be attributed to the p\u2013p* transition of the conjugated stilbene system of L. Because the ligand D-Hc has no conjugated system, the energy gap of the p\u2013p* transition is relatively large and its maximum absorption peaks are at 265 and 223 nm. The maximum absorption peak for the n\u2013p* transition of the C]O double bond in D-Hc is located at 324 nm. The UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of complexes 1, 3, 4, 6, and L are similar, and the maximum absorption peaks for the p\u2013p* transition of the complexes are all around 325 nm. Compared with that of the ligand L, the maximum absorption peaks of the four complexes are red-shi by 4\u20137 nm and the intensities are all stronger. This may be attributed to the charge transfer between lanthanide ions and ligands aer coordination. The maximum absorption peak and molar extinction coefficients of the two ligands and four complexes are listed in Table 2. The four complexes all have strong absorption peaks around at 212\u2013275 nm, showing superposition of the p\u2013p* transition of ligands D-c\u2212 and L.

Since the four complexes have the same structure, only the enantiomers 1 and 2 were prepared and discussed. Fig. 3 shows the ECD spectra of complexes 1 and 2 in the solid state and in acetonitrile solutions at room temperature. Those of the others are shown in Fig. S4.\u2020 At 308 nm, complex 1 shows a positive ECD signal and complex 2 shows a negative ECD signal. Both ECD signals come from the chiral carbon of the ligand D/L-Hc, and there is no exciton splitting in the complexes in both solution and the solid state. The chiroptical signals originating from the L- and D-congurational chiralities of the two diastereomers in complex 1 or 2 should be diverse in magnitude and located at a slightly different wavelengths in the same region.57,58 However, the solid-state chiroptical spectra of complexes 1 and 2 are the same as the solution spectra without apparent bisignate couplets, indicating that the observed ECD spectra are a sum of the chiroptical signals from both diastereomers. Furthermore, the measured XRD pattern of complex 1was found to be identical to the simulated data (Fig. S5\u2020), which indicates that its bulk sample is a pure phase. This demonstrates the coexistence of the two absolute congurations of 1a and 1b or 2a and 2b in crystal 1 or 2 at a ratio of 1 : 1. According to the crystal data and the solution and solid-state spectra of complexes 3\u20136, they may have similar properties to those of complexes 1 and 2."

Because of steric hindrance, when ligand L isomerizes from the trans to the cis isomer, the two benzene rings cannot be coplanar, hence the conjugation effect is weakened, resulting in blue-shi of its absorption peak. Therefore, the intensity of the absorption peak at 319 nm is weakened, while the intensities of the absorption peaks at 229 and 262 nm are enhanced.\nFig. 5 1H-NMR spectra changes of trans-L in acetonitrile-d3 irradiation\n2274 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 2269\u20132282\nAdditionally, with the increase of illumination time, an isosbestic point appears at 277 nm, showing that the trans-to-cis photoisomerization reaction of ligand L occurs upon irradiation at 312 nm. Then, the solution was irradiated at 254 nm aer it was irradiated at 312 nm for 1.5 h. The intensity of the absorption peak at 319 nm gradually increases with irradiation time at 254 nm, indicating that the cis-to-trans photoisomerization of L occurs under irradiation by 254 nm light (Fig. 4). From the variation of the UV\u2013vis spectra with irradiation time, it can be calculated that 20% of the cis isomer is reconverted to the trans isomer aer 5 min of irradiation, and no more cis-to-trans conversion occurs aer 6 min irradiation. Then, the cyclability and reversibility of the isomerization of L were tested under alternate irradiation with 312 nm light for 3 min and 254 nm light for 5 min. The variation in the absorption intensity of L at 319 nm over 10 cycles is shown in Fig. S6.\u2020With increasing cycle number, the absorption intensity of the ligand L gradually decreases and the cyclability gradually deteriorates. This is due to side reactions such as photocyclization and photodegradation occurring under UV light.\nTo gain more insight into the side reactions of ligand L, we conducted 1H NMR spectra analysis at different irradiation times, as shown in Fig. 5.

Then, 254 nm light was used to continue irradiating the solution. However, under irradiation at 254 nm, the intensities of the peaks at 6.62\u20136.74 and 4.27 ppm remain almost unchanged. This indicates that aer 2 h of illumination at 312 nm, the solution cannot recover its original state (Fig. S7\u2020). Hence, aer extended irradiation at 312 nm, the new proton signals at 6.62\u20136.74 ppmmay be assigned to the proton signal for the C]C bond aer cis-isomer cyclization to a dihydrophenanthrene group. Since themolecular formula of the photocyclization product is the same as that of L, the mass spectrum would not be changed under UV irradiation. This was conrmed by checking the mass-spectral variations for L in methanol solution with irradiation at 312 nm, as shown in Fig. S8.\u2020 Therefore, upon longterm UV irradiation, the side photoreaction is the photocyclization reaction. This can be conrmed by observing the changes in the photoisomerization rst-order rate constants aer extended irradiation under UV light. We calculated the photoisomerization rst-order rate constants, and the apparent quantum yield of L was calculated by the same method reported previously (Table 3).37 The linear simulation of the rst-order reaction kinetics for ligand L is good between 0 and 60 s and 300 and 2400 s, but no linear relationship is observed between 60 and 300 s (Fig. S9\u2020). This indicates that the photocyclization reaction competes with the trans-to-cis photoisomerization between 60 and 300 s, while aer 300 s, only photocyclization occurs. This can be further conrmed from the UV-spectral variations for L in acetonitrile solution upon alternating irradiation with UV light at 312 nm for 30min and 254 nm for 20min (Fig. 6). The intensity of the absorption peak at 319 nm gradually decreases with increasing irradiation time at 312 nm, while the intensities at 229 and 248 nm increase accompanied by the emergence of a new weak band centered at 395 nm.59,60 Appearance of the new absorption peak at 395 nm demonstrates the formation of the photocyclization product. Furthermore, the absorption intensities of these three peaks do not change upon irradiating the solution with 254 nm UV light, indicating that the cis isomer of L undergoes the photocyclization reaction and that the product of the photocyclization cannot be recovered to the trans isomer under 254 nm UV light."

The four complexes show similar photoisomerization behaviors under UV irradiation. Taking complex 1 as an example, Fig. 7 shows the variations in the UV\u2013vis spectra of complex 1 under irradiation by 365 and 254 nm UV light as a function of time. With increasing irradiation time of the solution at 365 nm, the p\u2013p* transition intensity of the stilbenemoiety at 324 nm gradually decreases and shows a blueshi of \u223c7 nm, while the intensity of the peaks at 229 and 262 nm increase gradually with an isosbestic point appearing at 285 nm. This change is similar to that of the free ligand L. The reason for the blue-shi may be the charge\u2013transfer transition between the metal center and the ligand aer isomerization. Under irradiation at 254 nm, the UV\u2013vis spectra of complex 1 shows the opposite change to that under irradiation at 365 nm. The absorption peak intensity of the p\u2013p* transition for the stilbene moiety increases with irradiation time and exhibits a red-shi. Compared with L, complex 1 also shows similar photoisomerization behavior. There is a 53% conversion of the cis isomer to the trans isomer for complex 1 aer 5 min irradiation at 254 nm. The cyclability and reversibility of complex 1 were investigated in the same way as those of ligand L. Although the intensity of the absorption peak at 324 nm gradually decreases during the cycling, the decrease in the intensity at 324 nm is much smaller than that of ligand L. Aer 10 cycles, complex 1 still shows excellent cyclability, proving that the complex has better photostability than that of ligand L.

Then, 254 nm light was used to irradiate the solution to study its recoverable photochemical reaction. Under UV irradiation at 254 nm, the intensity of the proton peaks at 6.52\u20136.74 ppm do not vary with irradiation time. Furthermore, the mass spectra do not change when the solution is irradiated under 365 nm UV light for more than 10 h. This indicates that upon long-term irradiation of the solution under UV light, the cis isomer of complex 1 also undergoes a photocyclization reaction. Owing to the paramagnetic nature of Sm3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+ ions, identifying the photoreactions by NMR spectral changes cannot be done. However, it can be assumed that complexes 3, 4, and 6 show similar results to those of complex 1 from the UV\u2013vis spectral changes.\nFurthermore, we calculated the photoisomerization rstorder rate constants and the apparent quantum yields of the four complexes in acetonitrile solutions (Table 3). It was found that the rst-order reaction kinetics of the complexes show similar properties and are a little different from that of pure L (Fig. S14\u2020). Therefore, we only considered complex 1 as an example to discuss the reaction kinetics of the complexes in comparison with those of L. The rate constants for complex 1 are calculated for irradiation between 0 and 300 s. For irradiation between 0 and 300 s under 365 nm UV light, the linear tting of the rst-order reaction kinetics for complex 1 is good, with an R factor higher than 0.99 and a trans-to-cis photoisomerization rate constant calculated to be 5.9. When the\n2276 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 2269\u20132282\nirradiation time is extended beyond 300 s, the photoisomerization rate decreases gradually. This is due to photocyclization reactions competing with the trans-to-cis photoisomerization reaction. Like the situation for the free ligand L, the photocyclization reaction of complex 1 competes with the trans-to-cis photoisomerization between 300 and 900 s. Aer 900 s only the photocyclization reaction occurs. For ligand L, the linear tting of the rst-order reaction kinetics is only good between 0 and 80 s. This indicates that the trans-to-cis photoisomerization stability of the complex is higher than that of free L under 365 nm light irradiation. Compare with L, complexes 1, 3, 4, and 6 have appropriate photoisomerization rate constants (kiso) and photoisomerization quantum yields (Ft\u2013c) of 0.0059/0.017, 0.0089/0.028, 0.0034/0.011, and 0.0111/ 0.024, respectively, where those of complex 4 are the lowest. This is similar with our previous results for stilbene-attached europium complexes, where ligand-energy transfer to the Eu3+ ion suppressed stilbene photoisomerization.47,48"

The implicit solvent model (SMD) was used to simulate the environment of complex 1 in acetonitrile. Fiy singlet states and 50 triplet states of the complex were selected, and six functional methods (B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, WB97X, B3PW91, PBEPBE, and BPV86) were used for calculation.47 The obtained electron absorption spectra were compared with the UV\u2013Vis spectra obtained experimentally. The electronic absorption spectra calculated by CAM-B3LYP are most similar to the UV\u2013vis spectra measured experimentally (Fig. S16\u2020). Therefore, the electronic absorption spectra of the other complexes were all calculated using CAM-B3LYP.\nThe main transitions with oscillator strengths f > 0.1 and dominant excitation characteristic of the four complexes are listed in Table 5. Compared with the UV\u2013Vis spectra obtained by experiment, the maximum calculated peak has a slight blueshi because the calculations cannot completely simulate the intermolecular forces of the complexes. The calculations show that the absorption bands in the range 230\u2013400 nm are mainly derived from ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT)pc/pL* or pL / pc* transitions, intramolecular ligand (IL) pL / pL* and pc / pc* transitions, and ligand-to-metal ion charge transfer (LMCT) transitions. The maximal absorption (HOMO\u2013 LUMO transition) of the four simulated complexes are all located at 318 nm. Among them, the absorption peak of complex 1 is mainly attributed to charge transfer from the chiral ligand c to the ligand L (LLCT pc\u2013p*L), with a small part attributed to the charge transition of the ligand L itself (IL pL/ p*L), which is shown by the molar extinction coefficient of the complex being higher than that of the ligand L. The charge transfer from ligand c to ligand L allows L to absorb more energy, so the stilbene group of ligand L in the complex is easier to isomerize, and the isomerization rate of complex 1 is higher than that of ligand L. For complex 3, the absorption peak at 318 nm is mainly attributed to LLCT pc\u2013p*L, IL pL\u2013p*L, and LMCT from L and c ligands to Sm3+ transitions. Complex 3 also shows a contribution from the IL pL\u2013p*L transition; thus the photoisomerization quantum yield and isomerization rate of complex 3 are higher than those of complex 1. For complex 4, except for LLCT pc\u2013p*L, LMCT from c to Eu\n3+ has some contribution to the absorption peak at 318 nm. The LMCT transition reduces the energy obtained by ligand L, so the photoisomerization quantum yield and isomerization rate of complex 4 are lower than those of 1. The absorption peak at 318 nm for complex 6 is simply attributed to LLCT pc\u2013p*L transition, so the photoisomerization quantum yield and isomerization rate are similar to those of complex 3.\nexcited states of complexes 1, 3, 4, 6 with contributing excitation (%),\nion characters\nFig. 9 (a) Luminescence spectra of complexes 3, 4 and 6 in acetonitrile solution (2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 mol L\u22121) (b) luminescence spectral changes of complex 4 upon irradiation at UV-365 nm as a function of time.

Thus, the energy level differences are beyond the range 2500\u20133500 cm\u22121.37 Therefore, although the ligand Hc can transfer energy to Sm3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+ ions, the sensitization efficiency is low.

These energy level differences are also not in the range 2500\u20133500 cm\u22121, so the energy of the trans isomer of L does not readily transfer to Sm3+ and Eu3+ ions. Moreover, owing to the chirality and weak conjugation of the ligand Hc, the sensitization efficiency is also reduced.

The results show that luminescence intensity around 350\u2013500 nm originated from the ligand transition of complex 3 decreases with increasing irradiating time, but the increases in luminescence intensity at 598 nm (4G5/2 / 6H7/2) and 645 nm (4G5/2 / 6H9/2) are difficult to observe owing to the very weak signal. For complex 4, the characteristic 4f\u20134f luminescence intensities at 592 nm (5D0 / 7F1) and 613 nm (5D0 / 7F2) increase with irradiation time during the trans-tocis photoisomerization accompanied by a decrease in intensity of the ligand luminescence around 350\u2013500 nm. Although the energy level difference between ligand L as the cis isomer and the lanthanide ions Sm3+ and Eu3+ are relatively close to the 2500\u20133500 cm\u22121 range, sensitization by cis isomer of ligand L of the Sm3+and Eu3+ luminescence efficiency is still low. This may be attributed to the low site symmetry of the lanthanide ions in the complexes. In addition, the luminescences of complexes 3 and 4 are cyclable and reversible under alternate irradiation with 365 nm light for 2 min and 254 nm light for 2 min.
