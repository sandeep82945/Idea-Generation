            "text": "Supersymmetry and Convection-Diffusion-Reaction equations\nChoon-Lin Ho Department of Physics, Tamkang University, Tamsui 25137, Taiwan\nIn this work we are concerned with generating solutions of a class of Convection-Diffusion-Reaction equation from the solutions of another CDR equation through the Darboux transformations. The method is elucidated by cases with certain types of the reaction coefficients. We have also discussed briefly supersymmetric pairs of Convection-Diffusion-Reaction equations connected through similarity solutions.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe Convection-Diffusion-Reaction (CDR) equation is an important type of second order differential equation which has found many important applications in physics, chemistry, astrophysics, engineering, and biology. It is widely employed to model stochastic phenomena that involve the change of concentration/population of one or more substances/species distributed in space under the influence of three processes: local reaction which modify the concentration/population, diffusion which causes the substances/species to spread in space, and convection/drifting under the influence of external forces [1\u20135]. The well-known Fokker-Planck equation [6, 7] and the reaction-diffusion equation [5] are special cases of the CDR equations.\nAs with any equation in science, exact solutions of CDR equations are not easy to obtain in general. As such, it is worthwhile to look for any method that helps find exact solutions of CDR equations. In this work we are concerned with generating solutions of a class of CDR equation from the solutions of another CDR equation through the Darboux transformations.\nThe (1 + 1)-dimension CDR equation equation to be studied in this paper is taken to have the following general form\n\u2202P (x, t) \u2202t = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202x (C(x, t)P (x, t)) + \u2202 \u2202x\n( D(x, t) \u2202\n\u2202x P (x, t)\n) +R(P, x, t), (1)\nwhere P (x, t) is the particle number function, D(x, t), C(x, t) and R(P, x, t) are the diffusion coefficient, the convection coefficient , and the reaction term, respectively. The domains we shall consider in this paper are the real line x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e), or the half lines x \u2208 [0,\u221e).\nIn Ref. [8] we have considered finding solutions of a FPE from the solutions of another FPE by means of the Darboux transformations [9\u201311]. In physics literature the time-independent Darboux transformation is usually call the supersymmetric (SUSY) method [12]. In Sect. 2 we extend this approach to the CDR equations. In Sect. 3, we briefly discuss how SUSY pairs of CDR equations can be determined through the similarity forms of the CDR equations given in Ref. [13].\nII. CDR EQUATIONS RELATED BY TIME-DEPENDENT DARBOUX TRANSFORMATION\nIn this section, we consider the class of CDR equation equations with D(x, t) = 1 and R(P, x, t) = r(x, t)P (x, t), i.e.,\n\u2202P (x, t) \u2202t = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202x (C(x, t) P (x, t)) +\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 P (x, t) + r(x, t)P (x, t). (2)\nThe diffusion coefficient D is set to unity in order to make connection with supersymmetry. The real function r(x, t) is the reaction coefficient.\nAs we have in mind two CDR equations to be connected by the Darboux transformations, we shall denote all the defining quantities of the original CDR with a subscript \u201c0\u201d, and those of the partner CDR with a subscript \u201c1\u201d.\nLet the convection coefficient of the original CDR equation be written as a space derivative of a function W0(x, t), C0(x, t) = \u22122W \u20320(x, t), where the prime indicates space-derivative. For a solution P0(x, t) of the CDR equation, we make the ansatz\nP0(x, t) = e \u2212W0(x,t)\u03a80(x, t). (3)\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n01 64\n7v 1\n[ m\nat h-\nph ]\n4 S\nep 2\n02 2\n\u2212\u03a8\u03070 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20320 + ( W \u203220 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 \u2212 W\u03070 \u2212 r0 ) \u03a80. (4)\nHere the dot represents time-derivative. It is seen that W0(x, t) determine the potential of this equation, and thus will be called the prepotential.\nWe shall apply the Darboux transformation to (4). Consider the Schro\u0308dinger equation\n\u2212\u03a8\u03070 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20320 + V0(x, t)\u03a80. (5)\nSuppose \u03c80(x, t) is a solution of this equation. Then it can be checked that, for any solution \u03a80(x, t) of (5), the Darboux transformed functions\nV1(x, t) = V0 \u2212 2 (ln\u03c80)\u2032\u2032, \u03a81(x, t) = (\u2202x \u2212 (ln\u03c80)\u2032) \u03a80, (6)\nalso satisfy the same form of Schro\u0308dinger equation [11],\n\u2212\u03a8\u03071 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20321 + V1(x, t)\u03a81. (7)\nThe set of equations in (6) is the (time-dependent) Darboux transformation. The function \u03c80(x, t) is called the auxiliary function of the Darboux transformation.\nOur strategy is as follows. Suppose for Eq. (4) we can determine the Darboux transformed equations (6) and (7), with\nV1(x, t) = W \u20322 1 \u2212W \u2032\u20321 \u2212 W\u03071 \u2212 r1 (8)\nfor some functions W1 and r1, then the SUSY partner CDR is defined by the convection coefficient C1(x, t) = \u22122W \u20321(x, t) and the reaction coefficient r1(x, t). And for a solution P0(x, t) in (3) of the original CDR, a corresponding solution of the SUSY partner is\nP1(x, t) = e \u2212W1\u03a81\n= e\u2212W1 (\u2202x \u2212 (ln\u03c80)\u2032) \u03a80 (9) = e\u2212W1 (\u2202x \u2212 (ln\u03c80)\u2032) ( eW0P0(x, t) ) .\nBelow we illustrate this construction for certain types of the reaction coefficient r(x, t).\nA. Case A: r0(x, t) = \u22122W \u2032\u20320 (x, t)\nIn this case Eq. (4) is\n\u2212\u03a8\u03070 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20320 + ( W \u203220 +W \u2032\u2032 0 \u2212 W\u03070 ) \u03a80. (10)\nThe function \u03c80 = e W0 is a solution of this equation, and thus can be used as an auxiliary function for the Darboux transformation giving\n\u03a81 = (\u2202x \u2212W \u20320)\u03a80, \u2212\u03a8\u03071 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20321 + ( W \u203220 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 \u2212 W\u03070 ) \u03a81. (11)\nNote the change of sign in front of the W \u2032\u20320 term. Now if we can find a function W1(x, t) that solves the generalized Riccati equation\nW \u203220 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 \u2212 W\u03070 = W \u203221 +W \u2032\u20321 \u2212 W\u03071, (12)\nthen a SUSY partner CDR equation is obtained, with C1(x, t) = \u22122W \u20321(x, t) and r1(x, t) = \u22122W \u2032\u20321 (x, t). Given a solution P0 = e\n\u2212W0\u03a80 of the original CDR equation, the corresponding solution of the partner CDR equation is given by Eq. (9),\nP1(x, t) = e \u2212W1(\u2202x \u2212W \u20320) ( eW0P0(x, t) ) . (13)\n3 In general it is not easy to solve the generalized Riccati equation (12) for W1(x, t) given W0(x, t). However, solution of (12) is rather easy if the prepotential W0(x, t) = W0(x; an(t)), where an(t) represents collectively a set of parameters in W0, satisfies the condition of shape invariance [12], namely,\nW \u20320(x, ; an(t)) 2 +W \u2032\u20320 (x; an(t)) (14)\n= W \u20320(x; an+1(t)) 2 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 (x; an+1(t)) +R(an(t)).\nHere an+1(t) is a function of an(t), and R(an(t)) is an x-independent shift function. Shape invariance turns out to be a sufficient condition for the exact-solvability of all the well-known one-dimensional analytically solvable quantum models, for which the prepotentials and the shift functions are time-independent. Interestingly, for the known solvable quantum systems, the parameters an and an+1 are related simply by a shift of constant. For example, an+1 = an+ 1 for the radial oscillator (an= angular momentum), and an+1 = an (unchanged) for the simple harmonic oscillator (an= angular frequency) [12].\nUsing (14) we can rewrite (12) as\nW \u20320(x, ; an(t)) 2 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 (x; an(t))\u2212 W\u03070(x, ; an(t))\n= W \u20320(x; an\u22121(t)) 2 +W \u2032\u20320 (x; an\u22121(t))\u2212 W\u03070(x, ; an(t))\u2212R(an\u22121(t)) (15) = W \u203221 (x, t) +W \u2032\u2032 1 (x, t)\u2212 W\u03071(x, t).\nFrom the last equality it is seen that a solution of (12) can be chosen to be\nW1(x, t) = W0(x; an\u22121(t)) + \u222b t R(an\u22121(t)) dt, (16)\nas long as we have\nW\u03070(x; an\u22121(t)) = W\u03070(x; an(t)). (17)\nAs pointed out in [8], if an(t) and an\u22121(t) differ only by a constant, the condition (17) is true if an(t) appears in W0(x, t) only as a multiplicative factor of a function of x. Of the ten solvable one-dimensional quantum models, such condition is true for: the 1d oscillator, the 3d oscillator, the Morse, the Scarf I and II, and the Po\u0308schl\u2013Teller potential.\nOne can iterate this process to obtain a SUSY hierarchy of CDR equations defined by\nWk(x, t) = W0(x; an\u2212k(t)) + \u222b t n\u22121\u2211 s=n\u2212k R(as(t)) dt, , k = 1, 2, . . . (18)\nup to the lowest an allowed by the model. Generalizing (13), the solutions Pk(x, t) of these CDR equations are related by\nPk(x, t) = e \u2212Wk ( \u2202x \u2212W \u2032k\u22121 ) ( eWk\u22121Pk\u22121(x, t) ) , k = 1, 2, . . . (19)\nAs an example, let us take W0 to be the prepotential of the 1d oscillator, W0(x, t) = \u03b3(t)x 2/4. This prepotential has the distinctive characteristics that the parameters an(t) = \u03b3(t) are all the same, and R(an(t)) = \u03b3(t). This means all the solutions Pk(x, t) in the SUSY hierarchy are the solutions of the same CDR equation with D\n(1) = \u2212\u03b3(t)x. Following the discussion in [8], for \u03b3(t) = \u22121/(t+ C), we find\nP0(x, t) =\n\u221a t+ C\n4\u03c0t e\u2212\nCx2\n4t(t+C) , (20)\nto be a solution of the original CDR equation. Then from Eq. (19), the next two solutions in the hierarchy are\nP1(x, t) \u221d Cx\nt\n\u221a t+ C\n4\u03c0t e\u2212\nCx2\n4t(t+C) , (21)\nand\nP2(x, t) \u221d C(2Ct+ 2t2 \u2212 Cx2)\nt2\n\u221a t+ C\n4\u03c0t e\u2212\nCx2\n4t(t+C) . (22)\nEq. (4) in this case becomes\n\u2212\u03a8\u03070 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20320 + ( W \u203220 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 + W\u03070 ) \u03a80. (23)\nNote that the last two terms in (23) differ in the signs from those in (10). This time the function \u03c80 = e \u2212W0 is a solution of eq. (23), and the Darboux transformations based on \u03c80 are\n\u03a81 = (\u2202x +W \u2032 0)\u03a80, \u2212\u03a8\u03071 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20321 + ( W \u203220 +W \u2032\u2032 0 + W\u0307 ) \u03a81. (24)\nThe generalized Riccati equation one needs to solve for the new prepotential W1(x, t) is\nW \u203220 +W \u2032\u2032 0 + W\u03070 = W \u20322 1 \u2212W \u2032\u20321 + W\u03071, (25)\nOnceW1 is found, the SUSY partner CDR equation is then defined by C1(x, t) = \u22122W \u20321(x, t) and r1(x, t) = \u22122W\u03071(x, t). Given a solution P0 = e\n\u2212W0\u03a80 of the original CDR equation, the corresponding solution of the partner CDR equation is given by\nP1(x, t) = e \u2212W1(\u2202x +W \u2032 0) ( eW0P0(x, t) ) . (26)\nAs in Case A, if the prepotentials satisfy the condition of shape invariance, then solution of (25) is easy. The generalized Riccati equation is\nW \u20320(x, ; an(t)) 2 +W \u2032\u20320 (x; an(t)) + W\u03070(x, ; an(t))\n= W \u20320(x; an\u22121(t)) 2 \u2212W \u2032\u20320 (x; an\u22121(t)) + W\u03070(x, ; an(t)) +R(an(t)) (27) = W \u203221 (x, t)\u2212W \u2032\u20321 (x, t) + W\u03071(x, t).\nA solution of (25) can be chosen to be\nW1(x, t) = W0(x; an+1(t)) + \u222b t R(an(t)) dt, (28)\nas long as we have\nW\u03070(x; an+1(t)) = W\u03070(x; an(t)). (29)\nSimilarly, iterating this process one obtains a SUSY hierarchy of CDR equations defined by\nWk(x, t) = W0(x; an+k(t)) + \u222b t n+k\u22121\u2211 s=n R(as(t)) dt, , k = 1, 2, . . . (30)\nThe solutions Pk(x, t) of these CDR equations are related by\nPk(x, t) = e \u2212Wk ( \u2202x +W \u2032 k\u22121 ) ( eWk\u22121Pk\u22121(x, t) ) , k = 1, 2, . . .\nExample of this case can be easily constructed following the description in Case A, and so will be be discussed here.\nC. Case C: r(x, t) = 2W \u20320S \u2032 0 \u2212 S\u203220 \u2212 S\u2032\u20320 \u2212 S\u03070\nConsider the following way to link a FPE and a CDR equation. The FPE with a drift coeeficient C(x, t) = \u22122\u03c9\u20320(x, t) is\n\u2202PF,0(x, t)\n\u2202t =\n\u2202\n\u2202x (2\u03c9\u20320(x, t)PF,0(x, t)) +\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 PF,0(x, t). (31)\nsatisfies a CDR equation\n\u2202P0(x, t)\n\u2202t =\n\u2202\n\u2202x (2W0(x, t)\n\u2032 P0(x, t)) + \u22022\n\u2202x2 P0(x, t) + r0(x.t)P0(x, t), (32)\nwith\nW0 = \u03c90 + S0, r0 = 2W \u2032 0S \u2032 0 \u2212 S\u203220 \u2212 S\u2032\u20320 \u2212 S\u03070. (33)\nThus every FPE in (31) corresponds to a CDR equation with W0(x, t) and r0(x, t) given by (33) for a given S0. By choosing different functions S0, one generates different CDR equations, all corresponding to the same FPE (31). This correspondence implies that, if we find a solution of the PF,0 = e \u2212\u03c90\u03a80, with \u03a80 satisfying [8]\n\u2212\u03a8\u03070 = \u2212\u03a8\u2032\u20320 + ( \u03c9\u20322o \u2212 \u03c9\u2032\u20320 \u2212 \u03c9\u03070 ) \u03a80, (34)\nthen a solution of the corresponding CDR equation (32) is P0 = e \u2212W0\u03a80 = e \u2212S0PF,0. It then follows that, if PF,1 = e\n\u2212\u03c91\u03a81 is a solution of the SUSY partner FPE, where the drift \u03c91 is determined by the time-dependent Darboux transformation discussed in [8], and \u03a81 = (\u2202x \u2212 \u03c9\u20321)\u03a80, then for a given W1(x, t),\nP1 = e \u2212W1\u03a81 = e\u2212W1 (\u2202x \u2212 \u03c9\u20321) ( eW0P0 ) (35)\nis a solution of the corresponding SUSY partner CDR equation defined by the drift and reaction functions\nS1 = W1 \u2212 \u03c91, r1 = 2W \u20321S\u20321 \u2212 S\u203221 \u2212 S\u2032\u20321 \u2212 S\u03071. (36)\nAs an example, let us take\n\u03c90 = \u03b3(t)x 2/4, \u03b3(t) = \u2212 1\nt+ C , C = real constant. (37)\nFrom Ref. [8], a solution of the FPE is\nPF,0(x, t) = 1\u221a\n4\u03c0t(t+ C) e\u2212\nCx2\n4t(t+C) . (38)\nCDR equation corresponding to this FPE is defined by W0, S0 and r0 in (33). As mentioned before, there could be many possible choices of W0 and S0. For illustration purpose, let us take W0 = 0, then\nS0(x, t) = x 2/[4(t+ C)], r0(x, t) = \u2212\n1\n2(t+ C) . (39)\nFrom P0 = e \u2212S0PF,0, we get a solution of this CDR equation to be\nP0(x, t) = 1\u221a\n4\u03c0t(t+ C) e\u2212\nx2 4t . (40)\nNow we consider the SUSY partner of this CDR equation. A choice of \u03c91 related to \u03c90 by the time-dependent Darboux transformation is \u03c91 = ax + ax\n2 \u2212 ln(t + C)/2 (a a real constant) [8]. To define a SUSY partner with \u03c91 = W1 \u2212 S1, we take W1 = ax and S1 = ln(t+ C)/2\u2212 at2. This leads to\nr1(x, t) = \u2212S\u03071 = \u2212 1\n2(t+ C) + a2, (41)\nand by (35), a solution of the partner CDR equation,\nP1(x, t) = x+ 2at 4 \u221a \u03c0(t+ C)t3/2 e\u2212 1 4t (x 2+4axt). (42)\nLet us now discuss briefly SUSY pair of CDR equations connected through similarity solutions. A CDR equation is said to possess scaling symmetry, if its functional form is unchanged under the scale transfor-\nmation\nx = a x\u0304 , t = b t\u0304, , a, b : real constants. (43)\nIn this case, the functions C,D,R and P have the following scaling forms in terms of the similarity variable z:\nP (x, t) = t\u00b5y(z), C(x, t) = t\u03b3\u03c4(z), D(x, t) = t\u03b4\u03c3(z), R(P, x, t) = t\u03c1\u03c1(z). (44)\nwhere\nz \u2261 x t\u03b1 , where \u03b1 = a b , b 6= 0 , (45)\nand y(z), \u03c4(z), \u03c3(z) and \u03c1(z) are functions of z. Scaling symmetry requires that the exponents are linked by [13]\n\u03b3 = \u03b1\u2212 1, \u03b4 = 2\u03b1\u2212 1, \u03c1 = \u00b5\u2212 1. (46)\nHence \u03b1 and \u00b5 are the only two independent scaling exponents of the CDR equation. With these, the CDR equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation [13]\n\u03c3y\u2032\u2032 + (\u03c3\u2032 + \u03b1 z \u2212 \u03c4) y\u2032 \u2212 (\u03c4 \u2032 + \u00b5) y + \u03c1 = 0. (47)\nHere \u201cprime\u201d represents derivative with respect to z. Let us now consider the special case where \u03c3(z) = 1, \u03c4(z) = \u03b1z and \u03c1(z) = \u2212\u03a6(z)y(z). Eq. (47) then reduces to\n\u2212y\u2032\u2032 + (\u03a6 + \u00b5+ \u03c3)y = 0. (48)\nIf we set V \u2212 E \u2261 \u03a6 + \u00b5+ \u03c3, where E is a real constant, then (48) is recast into the form of a Schro\u0308dinger equation\n\u2212y\u2032\u2032 + (V \u2212 E)y = 0. (49)\nIt is now clear that this form permits us to derive a SUSY partner of the CDR equation by the time-independent version of the Darboux transformation (6). For any solutions y0(z) and y(z) of (49), the functions\nV\u0303 (z) = V \u2212 2 (ln y0)\u2032\u2032, y\u0303(z) = (\u2202x \u2212 (ln y0)\u2032) y, (50)\nalso satisfy the same form of Schro\u0308dinger equation (49) with the same value of E. Here y0(z) serves as the auxiliary function of the Darboux transformation. The SUSY partner CDR equation is then defined by the functions (recall \u03c3(z) = 1, \u03c4(z) = \u03b1z)\nP\u0303 (x, t) = t\u00b5y\u0303(z), C\u0303(P, x, t) = t\u03b3(\u03b1z), D\u0303(P, x, t) = t\u03b4,\nR\u0303(P, x, t) = \u2212t\u03c1 \u03a6\u0303(z) y\u0303(z), \u03a6\u0303(z) = V\u0303 (z)\u2212 E \u2212 \u00b5\u2212 \u03b1. (51)\nIt is not hard to work out examples by matching (49) with the solvable SUSY quantum systems listed in [12].\nIV. SUMMARY\nIn this work we have discussed a way to obtain solutions of a class of CDR equation from those of another CDR equation, by means of the Darboux transformation. Cases with certain types of the reaction coefficients are presented. We have also discussed briefly SUSY pairs of CDR equation connected through similarity solutions.\nWe have not considered the case with x-independent reaction coefficient, i.e., r(x, t) = r(t), as this case can be transformed into a FPE by a phase transformation. In fact, letting\nP (x, t) = e \u222b t r(t)dt PF (x, t), (52)\none finds PF (x, t) satisfies the FPE. Thus one can follow the discussion in Ref. [8] to determine the SUSY partners of the CDR equation.\nThe work is supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) of the Republic of China under Grant MOST 110-2112-M-032-011.\n[1] B.
