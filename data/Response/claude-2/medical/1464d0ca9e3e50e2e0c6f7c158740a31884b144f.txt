 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of different types of family micro-business resources (e.g. financial, human, social, etc.) on agritourism performance. The current study focused only on business-based resources. 

2. Investigate the role of resident-micro-business interaction and support for agritourism development in other tourism contexts beyond agritourism, such as eco-tourism, cultural tourism, etc.

3. Conduct a comparative study on the relationships between micro-businesses, residents, and tourism performance in developed vs developing countries. The current study was situated in Saudi Arabia.

4. Explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the tested relationships, since the current data was collected post-pandemic. A pre-post pandemic comparison could reveal interesting insights. 

5. Examine the sequential mediation model using more advanced statistical techniques like structural equation modeling (SEM) for validation. The current study utilized PLS-SEM.
