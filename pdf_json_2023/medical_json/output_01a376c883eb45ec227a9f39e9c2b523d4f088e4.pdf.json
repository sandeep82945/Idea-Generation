However, the factors involved in dominant male sterility are largely unknown. Here, we identified a gene from Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice, named Sanming dominant male sterility (SMS), and reported that an epi-allele of this locus contributes to male sterility. Segregation analysis attributed dominant male sterility to a single locus, SMS, which we characterized using a male-sterile near isogenic line (NIL) of rice cultivar 93-11. The SMS locus was heterozygous in the male-sterile 93-11 NIL, containing an epi-allele identical to that in 93-11, and an epi-allele identical to that in rice cultivar Nipponbare, which we refer to as SMS9 and SMSN, respectively. SMS9 is silent and hyper-methylated, whereas SMSN is expressed and hypo-methylated in the 93-11 NIL. Overexpressing SMSN led to male sterility. Mutations in SMS rescued the male sterility of the 93-11 NIL. Interestingly, we observed the duplication of SMSN in Nipponbare, but did not observe the duplication of SMS9 in 93-11. Together, these findings suggest that the reduced methylation and enhanced expression of the SMSN epi-allele in the 93-11 NIL is responsible for its role in conferring dominant male sterility.\nmale sterility, rice, epi-allele, Sanming, DNA methylation\nCitation: Yang, Y., Zhang, C., Li, H., Yang, Z., Xu, Z., Tai, D., Ni, D., Wei, P., Yi, C., Yang, J., et al.

            "text": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for more than half the world\u2019s population and more than 60% of the Chinese population (Fukagawa and Ziska, 2019; Yuan, 2014). The demand for crops is increasing due to population growth and economic development. To overcome these challenges, plant breeders are working to improve the key plant characteristics such as yield, size, quality, and time to maturity. Hybrid rice\nhas greatly contributed to the self-sufficiency of the food supply in China via improved yield and stress resistance (Cheng et al., 2007). To date, hybrid rice has been introduced and promoted in more than 40 countries (Yuan, 2014). Hybrid rice breeding makes use of sterile rice plants. Sterility types used in hybrid rice breeding include cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility (PGMS), and thermosensitive genic male sterility (TGMS). CMS is generally used in three-line hybrid systems, whereas PGMS and TGMS are used in two-line hybrid systems. The gene CMS-Wild Abortive 352 (WA352), which encodes a product of 352 amino acids (aa) in length,\n\u00a9 Science China Press 2023 life.scichina.com link.springer.com\nSCIENCE CHINA Life Sciences\n\u2020Contributed equally to this work *Corresponding authors (Yong Ding, email: dingyong@ustc.edu.cn; Jianbo Yang, email: yjianbo@263.net)\nwas originally characterized in a CMS line generated from backcrossing common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) with indica rice (O. sativa subsp. indica) (Lin and Yuan, 1980; Luo et al., 2013). WA352 directly binds to CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT 11 (COX11) and inhibits the ability of COX11 to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in tapetum degradation and pollen sterility (Luo et al., 2013). The male sterility of CMS line Honglian (HL-CMS) is caused by the presence of the chimeric gene orfH79 (Yi et al., 2002). ORFH79 accumulates in mitochondria during pollen development, which in turn boosts ROS production and reduces the ATP/ADP ratio in anthers (Peng et al., 2010; Wan et al., 2007). ORFH79 binds to mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III and decreases its enzyme activity via an interaction with P61 (Wang et al., 2013). orf79 encodes a cytotoxic peptide of 79 aa in length and is responsible for Chinsurah Boro II/Taichung 65 (BT)-type CMS. atp6, which encodes subunit 6 of the mitochondrial ATPase complex, is upstream of orf79, and the two are cotranscribed as a single 2.0-kb mRNA. Disruption of atp6/ orf79 co-transcription restores fertility. Photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility 1 (Pms1) produces a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), PMS1T (Fan et al., 2016). PMST1T is targeted by miR2118 to generate phased secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) of 21 nucleotides (nt) in length that preferentially accumulate in a PSMS line under long-day but not short-day conditions (Fan et al., 2016). pms3 also encodes a long-noncoding RNA; a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) substitution in this RNA results in PSMS (Ding et al., 2012). In addition to PSMS, TGMS has been successfully used in two-line hybrid breeding. tms1 (Wang et al., 1995), tms2 (Lopez et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 1997), tms3 (Lang et al., 1999), tms4 (Dong et al., 2000), tms5 (Zhou et al., 2014), tms6 (Lee et al., 2005), and tms6(t) (Lee et al., 2005) are well-known loci conferring TGMS. TMS5 encodes a conserved RNase Z protein that processes the mRNAs produced from three Ubiquitin fusion ribosomal protein L40 (UbL40) genes into multiple fragments (Zhou et al., 2014). In addition to recessive male sterility, six dominant male sterile materials have been reported in rice. These comprise Pingxiang dominant genic male sterile rice (He et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2007), the low temperature-sensitive dominant male sterile rice line \u201c8987\u201d (Deng and Zhou, 1994), the Zhejiang 9248 mutant M1, the Orion mutant 1783 (Zhu and Rutger, 2000), the Kay-Bonnet mutant 1789 (Zhu and Rutger, 2000), and Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice (Yang et al., 2012). However, the genes involved in dominant male sterility are largely unknown. Here, we report that the locus Sanming dominant male sterility (SMS) is responsible for Sanming dominant genic male sterility. The SMS locus was heterozygous in a male-\nsterile near isogenic line (NIL) of 93-11 and in Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice; both of which contain an epi-allele identical to that in rice cultivar 93-11, which we refer to as SMS9, and an epi-allele identical to that in rice cultivar Nipponbare, which we refer to as SMSN for japonica rice. SMS9 is silent and hyper-methylated, whereas SMSN is highly expressed and hypo-methylated in the male-sterile 93- 11 NIL. Overexpressing SMSN induced male sterility in the 93-11 and Wanjing 97 rice, while knockout of SMS rescued the male sterility in the 93-11 NIL. These results shed light on the role of SMS in dominant male sterility in rice."

            "text": "The 93-11 NIL produces sterile pollen\nTo isolate the factors involved in male sterility, we crossed Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice with rice cultivars 93-11 and LH422 for eight generations to obtain a malesterile 93-11 NIL and LH422 NIL. The male-sterile 93-11 NIL exhibited normal vegetative development and female organ formation, except for male sterility (Figure 1A). We observed pollen grains in 93-11 and no pollen grains in the 93-11 NIL (Figure 1B and C). The sterile phenotype was independent of temperature and photoperiod based on observations of plants grown in Hefei and Tongling, China (Figure S1A\u2013D in Supporting Information), consistent with previous results (Yang et al., 2012). We next investigated the segregation ratio of progeny produced from 93-11 pollen crossed with 93-11 NIL. In the F1 population, 73 plants with normal pollen and 69 plants with male sterility were observed. Therefore, the male sterility trait is dominant, with a segregation ratio of 1:1 (fertility:sterility=73:69, \u03c72=0.016, P>0.05) among the F1 progeny. This indicated that the sterility phenotype could be attributed to a single locus. To characterize cellular morphology of male-sterile plants, we dissected the anthers of 93-11 and the male-sterile 93-11 NIL. At stage 5, the endothecium layer, middle layer, and tapetum were observed in the developing anthers of the 93- 11 and the 93-11 NIL (Figure 1D). The cytoplasm of tapetal cells became condensed in 93-11 plants from stage 6 to stage 8a, whereas loosened and vacuolated cytoplasm was observed in tapetal cells of the 93-11 NIL. At stages 8b and stage 9, the tapetum became more condensed in 93-11 plants but was severely swollen in 93-11 NIL. At stage 10, the microspores of 93-11 plants became vacuolated and round, whereas no microspores were detected in 93-11 NIL. Generative cells formed from microspores and developed into mature pollen grains in 93-11 from stage 11 to 13; however, we observed no generative cells or mature pollen grains in the 93-11 NIL (Figure 1D). These results suggest that the male sterility of the 93-11 NIL is due to defects in anther development.\nWe then examined the microspore mother cells of 93-11 and the 93-11 NIL at stage 7 using transmission electron microscopy. The nuclei of the microspore mother cells were dispersed in 93-11 NIL, but they are normal in 93-11 (Figure 1E).\nSMS map-based cloning and candidate gene identification\nTo map genes involved in male sterility, we generated additional F1 progeny from 93-11 pollen crossed with 93-11\nNIL. This cross produced 525 plants with normal pollen and 475 plants with male sterility. We used 623 pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers for polymorphism analysis between 93-11 and the 93-11 NIL and obtained five polymorphic markers: RM152, RM1235, RM22306, RM22354, and RM22355 (Figure 2A). Using these markers, we initially mapped the male sterility locus to chromosome 8. Analysis using the insertion-deletion markers RM22306 and RM22354 narrowed down the male-sterility locus to a 937- kb DNA region. We then designed 13 pairs of primers (b1 to b13) for the 937-kb DNA region. Primers RM22321, b7, RM22322, and b9 revealed polymorphisms between 93-11 and the 93-11 NIL (Figure 2A). We then used these four markers to examine the 475 malesterile plants, which narrowed down the male-sterility locus to a 57.7-kb region between RM22321 and b7 (Figure 2A). To identify the candidate gene in the 57.7-kb region in the 93-11 NIL, we sequenced genomic DNA from 93-11 and the 93-11 NIL using next-generation sequencing, and identified 12 candidate open reading frames (ORFs) in this region (Figure 2B). Sequence analysis showed 37.7-kb region harboring ORF2 (Loc_Os08g03780) to ORF8 (Loc_Os08g03830) were deleted in 93-11 background (Figure 2B). This 37.7-kb region in 93-11 NIL is identical to that in O. sativa subsp. japonica cv. \u201cNipponbare\u201d except 1,978-bp insertion between ORF6 (Loc_Os08g03820) and ORF7 (Loc_Os08g03825), which is consistent with the previous results (Lei et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). ORF1 (Loc_Os08g03770), ORF9 (Loc_Os08g03840), ORF10 (Loc_Os08g03850), ORF11 (Loc_Os08g03860), and ORF12 (Loc_Os08g03870) displayed heterogeneity (Figure 2B and C; Figures S2A\u2013D and S3A in Supporting Information). Approximately half of the copies of these ORFs in 93-11 male sterile rice were identical to the alleles in 93-11, whereas the other half were identical to those in Nipponbare (Figure 2C; Figures S2A\u2013D and S3A in Supporting Information). To further investigate the genes involved in male sterility, we examined transcript levels of ORFs in 93-11, 93-11 NIL, and Nipponbare. Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)PCR showed that ORF6 was highly expressed in 93-11 NIL compared with that in 93-11, and increase less than 4-fold compared with that in Nipponbare. ORF9 was highly induced in 93-11 NIL and increased over 12-fold compared with that in 93-11 and Nipponbare (Figure 2D). The high induction ofORF6 in 93-11 NIL compared with that in 93-11 might be due to the ORF6 deletion in 93-11 background. We next investigate the transcription levels of ORF6 and ORF9 in LH422 NIL, and found that 3-fold induction of ORF6 and over 12-fold induction of ORF9 compared with that in Nipponbare (Figure 2E). The transcription levels of other ORFs did not show obvious induction in 93-11 NIL and LH422 NIL (Figure S4A and B in Supporting Information).\nThese results suggested that ORF6 and ORF9 may have been responsible for male sterility in the 93-11 NIL plants. Because of higher induction of ORF9 in 93-11 NIL and LH422 NIL, we thus further investigated the function of ORF9 and referred to ORF9 as Sanming dominant male sterility (SMS). The 93-11 SMS allele was named SMS9 and the Nipponbare (japonica) allele was referred to as SMSN. Similar heterogeneity in SMS was observed in San-Ming dominant genic male sterile rice plants (Figure S3B in Supporting Information).\nSMSN is responsible for male sterility\nBecause SMS was heterogeneous in 93-11 NIL, we cloned SMS transcripts from the 93-11 NIL into a T-vector and sequenced 23 individual clones. The results showed that all 23 clones had the SMSN allele (Figure S5 in Supporting Information). This suggested that SMSN, but not SMS9, was highly expressed in 93-11 NIL male sterile rice. We next investigated whether SMSN was essential for male sterility. We generated overexpression constructs in which the full-length cDNA of SMSN was driven by UBIQUITIN promoter. The resulting constructs were transferred into 93- 11. Over 20 independent transgenic plants were obtained and the transgenic plants overexpressing SMSN displayed male sterility (Figure 3A\u2013D). No pollen grains were observed in SMSN-overexpressing plants at high levels, whereas small amounts of pollen were observed in plants expressing SMSN at low levels (Figure 3C and D). To further confirm these results, we transferred SMSN driven by UBIQUITIN promoter into the rice variety Wanjing97; this experiment yielded similar results (Figure S6A\u2013C in Supporting Information). We also generated plants transferred SMSN driven by tapetal-sepcific promoter OsLTP6 (Jeong and Jung, 2015; Liu et al., 2013), and found the mature pollen grain number was greatly reduced in transgenic plants (Figure S6D\u2013G in Supporting Information). Overall, these experiments suggested that SMSN, but not SMS9, was responsible for male sterility. This was consistent with our observation that high expression levels of SMSN contributed to male sterility in 93-11 NIL male sterile plants. To confirm SMS function, we crossed 93-11 with 93-11 NIL male sterile rice and collected the F1 seeds. SMS was mutated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. Transgenic plants harboring SMS9 or SMSN were selected, and the genomic DNA was cloned into a T-vector for sequencing. We detected a thymine deletion in exon 1 of SMS9 and SMSN, and a cytosine insertion in one edited line in exon 3 of SMS9 and SMSN and a thymine insertion in exon 3 in another edited line, each causing a premature stop codon (Figure 3E). All of these CRISPR-Cas9 mutants generated seeds and some pollen grains (Figure 3F\u2013H). To confirm\nthese, we investigated pollen grains in F1 CRISPR-Cas9 mutants with self-pollination. The transgenic plants harboring SMS9 or SMSN were selected and the normal pollen grains were observed in all CRISPR-Cas9 mutants (Figure S7 in Supporting Information). The results suggested that SMS mutation could rescue male sterility of the 93-11 NIL rice.\nSMS is differentially distributed in japonica and indica rice\nSMS9 encodes a product of 449 aa in length with no known functional domain. There are four single nucleotide polymorphisms between SMS9 and SMSN, The first of which caused a Gly to Ser substitution, and the third of which caused an Ala to Ile substitution (Figure 2C; Figures S3A and S8 in Supporting Information). A 3-nt insertion and a 3-\nnt deletion in the first exon of SMSN resulted in a Gly deletion and a Pro insertion in SMSN (Figure 2C; Figures S3A and S8 in Supporting Information). BLAST analysis search showed that SMS is present in maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), but not in dicot plants (Figure S9 in Supporting Information). These results suggested that SMS evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. We investigated the distribution of SMS alleles in 3,010 rice accessions (Sun et al., 2017). SMS was widely detected, with the highest frequency (100%) among japonica, aromatic (ARO), and admixture (Adm) populations, whereas SMSwas present at a frequency of 82.3% in indica (IND) and 82.1% in aus (aus) rice (Figure 4A). We performed BLAST analysis of the Nipponbare and 93-11 genomes using SMSN as a query sequence. SMSN matched part of the LOC_Os08g03780 sequence and the full-length LOC_Os08g03790 sequence in Nipponbare (Figure 4C),\nwhereas LOC_Os08g03780 and LOC_Os08g03790 were not present in 93-11. Therefore, SMSN appears to be a combination of LOC_Os08g03780 and LOC_Os08g03790, and perhaps the 2,994-bp deletion in these genes contributed to the formation of SMSN in Nipponbare (Figure 4C). LOC_Os08g03780 is located adjacent to LOC_Os08g03790, and LOC_Os08g03780 and LOC_Os08g03790 were also\nannotated as a single gene (Os08g0132100) in the 3,010 rice accessions. Os08g0132100 was detected in japonica rice at a frequency of 96.2%, whereas Os08g0132100 is a subordinate gene in indica, with a frequency of 15.6% in the IG3 varietal subgroup and 37.8% in the IG2 varietal subgroup. These results suggest that SMS exhibits different distribution patterns in japonica and indica rice.\nThe SMSN is hypo-methylated at the promoter region in the male-sterile 93-11 NIL\nGiven that SMSN is highly expressed in the 93-11 NIL, we wondered whether any epigenetic modifications were altered at SMS in this line. We subjected the promoter region, coding region, and 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) to bisulfate sequencing. Cytosine was highly methylated in the promoter region, but not in the coding region or 3\u2032 UTR in 93-11 and Nipponbare. However, the cytosine methylation levels at promoter were reduced by approximately 50% in the 93-11 NIL (Figure 5A), suggesting that half of the SMS copies are methylated in the 93-11 NIL. The heterozygosity at the SMS locus and the 50% reduced methylation levels of SMS in 93-11 NIL led us to investigate whether methylation was unequally reduced in SMS9 compared with SMSN. The CpG and CHG methylation of SMSN, but not SMS9, was dramatically reduced in the 93-11 NIL (Figure 5B and C). We further investigated the cytosine methylation levels of SMS in Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice, and found the methylation levels at promoter were reduced in SMSN, but not in SMS9 (Figure S10A and B in Supporting Information). These results suggest that the DNAmethylation of SMSN, but not SMS9, is altered in the 93- 11 NIL and Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice."

            "text": "In this study, we identified the allele SMSN from Sanming\ndominant genic male sterile rice as the causal gene for its male sterility. SMSN is hypo-methylated and highly expressed, whereas SMS9 is hyper-methylated and silent. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of how epiallelic changes contribute to dominant male sterility in rice. Gene duplications are important driving forces in evolution, as they provide a source of new genes and create genetic novelty in organisms, allowing organisms to develop new phenotypes and adapt to their environments (Panchy et al., 2016). Gene duplication can result from unequal crossing over, retroposition, or large-scale (i.e., chromosomal or genomic) duplications (Magadum et al., 2013). The most common fate of retained duplicated genes is the silencing of one member of the pair (Lynch, 2002). Our results indicate that the sequences of SMS, LOC_Os08g03780, and LOC_Os08g03790 are identical except for a 2,994-bp insertion in Nipponbare. SMSN, LOC_Os08g03780, and LOC_Os08g03790 are silent and lack specific functions in Nipponbare. Thus, based on the sequences and transcriptional activities of SMSN, LOC_Os08g03780, and LOC_Os08g03790, it remains unclear which gene is the ancestral copy and which are the duplicates. SMS, LOC_Os08g03780, and LOC_Os08g03790 were observed at low frequency in the IG2, IG3, and IG5 subgroups of indica rice. Perhaps fragment deletions occurred in these subgroups. These results suggest that SMS, LOC_Os08g03780, and LOC_Os08g03790 might be not crucial for rice development. The activation of SMSN, resulting in male sterility, may have occurred by accident. Compared with other eukaryotic genomes, plant genomes tend to evolve at higher\nrates, leading to higher genome diversity (Panchy et al., 2016). Our findings reveal the diversity of SMS in different rice accessions. The distinct functions of SMSN and SMS9 in male sterility suggest that divergent evolution of SMS occurred in Nipponbare and 93-11. The role of DNA methylation in gene silencing in plants is well known. DNA methylation at the promoter of a gene, but not the coding region, is strongly associated with transcriptional repression (He et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2006; Zilberman et al., 2007). Recent studies have revealed that the DNA methylation is essential for inheribale epiallele and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are crucial for male fertility in rice (Si et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2022). Our results indicate that the DNA methylation level is reduced at the SMSN promoter, but not at its coding region or 3\u2032 UTR in the male-sterile 93-11 NIL. Furthermore, the overall DNA methylation level of SMSN, but not SMS9, is strongly reduced\nin the 93-11 NIL. As the 93-11 NIL was obtained by backcrossing of Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice, which in turn originated via the hybridization of SE21S and Basmati370, we suspected that the reduced DNA methylation and enhanced activation of SMSNmight have occurred during hybridization. The factors involved in the reduced DNA methylation of SMSN require further study. The male fertility was used for hybrid seed production in crops (Cai et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2021). Taigu genic male-sterile wheat, the first dominant male-sterile mutant, has been used to generate wheat varieties (Ni et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017). The Sanming dominant genic male sterile rice like Taigu genic male-sterile wheat is potentially served as breeding platform to create breeding materials. In summary, we have characterized the male-sterile gene SMS in rice and revealed that the contribution of the SMSN epi-allele to male sterility depends on its DNA methylation and transcriptional activation."
