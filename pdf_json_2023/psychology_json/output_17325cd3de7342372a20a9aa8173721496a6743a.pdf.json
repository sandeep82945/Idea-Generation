The investigation was conducted using a combination of neutron scattering and Density Functional Theory (DFT). New neutron scattering data at large scattering wave vectors were analyzed to determine the total structure factor SM(q) and the molecular form factor F1(q) of the system. DFT calculations using the 6-311++G(d, p) basis set were performed to optimize the monomers and various AA\u2013W H-bonded clusters, including one acetic acid (AA) molecule connected to one, two, and three water molecules. Consequently, three dimers, three trimers, and one tetramer have been considered in order to describe the local order in the mixture. In addition, this study focused on the H-bond interactions in the most probable clusters in the solution, using the natural bond orbital and the atoms in molecules analyses. Our analysis particularly shows that stronger H-bond interactions occur in the ring structures. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0171172",

INTRODUCTION\nHydrogen bonding is of immense significance in aqueous solutions of organic compounds, influencing the properties of many biological systems.1\u20133 The formed hydrogen-bond networks between organic molecules and water deeply affect the mixture\u2019s physical and chemical characteristics.4\u20136\nIn this context, acetic acid AA (CH3COOH) plays a crucial role as a simple prototype for studying O\u2013H\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5O hydrogen bonds in organic compounds and providing valuable insights into these interactions in complex biological processes.7\u20139 H bonds in AA are formed between the hydrogen (H) atom of the hydroxyl (OH) group and the oxygen (O) atom of the carbonyl (C=O) one. While the formation of cyclic dimers has been confirmed in the gas phase,10\u201312 the short-range order in the liquid state is more complex13\u201318 and needs deeper investigation.\nIn our previous studies,19\u201322 we have explored the structural properties of liquid acetic acid using x-ray and neutron scattering\nexperiments, along with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics simulations (DMs). These studies clearly highlight the presence of hydrogen-bond networks in the liquid. Crystal-like trimers have been found to well reproduce experimental data, and other molecular associations have been identified. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that water contains hydrogenbonded tetrahedral clusters.23 Therefore, it becomes crucial to investigate the molecular arrangements in the AA\u2013W mixture and the competition between different O\u2013H\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5O hydrogen bonds that might be formed.\nThe local order and structural features of acetic acid aqueous solutions have been extensively explored using various experimental and theoretical techniques. Rablen et al.24 conducted a pioneering study using computational methods to explore hydrogen-bonding interactions between water and acetic acid molecules. Their research revealed that acetic acid monohydrates adopt highly stable configurations by forming hydrogen-bonded rings that involve both the water molecule and the COOH group. The investigation of\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224503 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0171172 159, 224503-1\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n11 January 2024 22:50:22\nthe AA\u2013W mixture using DFT calculations conducted by Gao and Leung25 reveals that a cyclic double hydrogen-bonded geometry is the more stable molecular model among the proposed structures for mono and dihydrate acetic acid. However, Pu et al.26\u201328 studied the interactions of an AA molecule with many water molecules using x-ray scattering data and IR frequencies. They suggest that, in dilute aqueous solutions, the potential structures involve two or more coordinate shells. Based on ab initio quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, Chocholous\u030cov\u00e1 et al.10 reached the conclusion that acetic acid does not form any dimer structure in water solution. Lopes et al.29 investigated the complexes between AA and water by the ab initio method and IR spectroscopy in a nitrogen matrix to identify the first water complexes of the higher-energy isomer cis-AA. Raman spectroscopy studies30,31 have provided conflicting results, suggesting both the disruption of water structure by acetic acid hydrogen bonds and the formation of distinct micro-phases in equimolar AA\u2013W mixtures. The research conducted by Takamuku et al.,16 based on wide-angle x-ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), demonstrates that the strength of hydrogen bonds between acetic acid and water (AA\u2013W), as well as between water molecules, increases progressively as the concentration of acetic acid (xA) decreases. In addition, Soffientini et al.32 carried out a neutron diffraction study of acetic acid hydration. Their results confirm that the tendency for direct interactions between acetic acid molecules is reduced in the presence of water. However, the authors state that the interpretation of the structure data presents some limitations, particularly in determining the relative importance of various hydrogen-bond types that occur in the solution.\nThe aim of the present paper is to provide a more comprehensive study of the local order AA\u2013W mixture by collecting new neutron scattering data at a large modulus of the scattering vector coupled with DFT theoretical calculations. Specifically, we investigate an equimolar AA\u2013W solution under ambient thermodynamic conditions. Neutron scattering data are used to find out the total structure factor. Experimental data, recorded up to 16 \u00c5\u22121, allow us to determine with high accuracy the intramolecular conformation. Various molecular arrangements involving dimers, trimers, and one tetramer are then optimized by DFT calculations to identify the most probable model(s) that describe the short-range order of the solution. Furthermore, Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Atoms In Molecules (AIM) analyses are performed to gain insights into the nature and stability of the hydrogen-bond interactions in the retained clusters."

One can see a good agreement between the experimental structure factor SM(q) and the deduced molecular form factor F1(q) at high q-values (q \u2265 10.5 \u00c5\u22121). It\u2019s interesting to notice that our neutron scattering data were gathered at higher q values (q \u223c 16 \u00c5\u22121) compared to the sole existing neutron scattering study in the literature conducted by Soffientini et al.32 (q \u223c 10 \u00c5\u22121). This extended range allows a more precise determination of the intramolecular conformation, i.e., F1(q). As a result, the intermolecular interactions, especially the hydrogen bonds, can be deduced with enhanced reliability, as demonstrated earlier.\nJ. Chem.

In fact, the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of the acetic acid molecule provide the predominant H-bonding interactions with water. To determine\nFIG. 5.

The geometrical structure of each cluster is optimized by DFT calculations, as described earlier. In our analysis process, the theoretical structure factor deduced from each model is compared to the neutron diffraction one. In the process refinement, only the Debye\u2013Waller parameters were fitted to reduce the difference between the experimental and theoretical curves, starting from q \u223c 2.5 \u00c5\u22121.\nOne cyclic and two linear dimers are first optimized (Fig. 2).

Manifestly, theoretical curves (red lines) exhibit a clear discordance with the experimental ones, especially below 8 \u00c5\u22121. Consequently, the considered dimer associations cannot describe the short range structure of the solution. This finding corroborates the conclusion of Chocholous\u030cov\u00e1 et al.,10 indicating the absence of dimer structures in AA water solutions. Figure 4 shows the considered trimers. Different H-bond interactions can be highlighted in these models. In the cyclic model T1, three hydrogen bonds are established between the AA molecule and the water ones by one OA\u2013HA\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5OW\u2013HW and two C=O\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5HW\u2013OW.

The experimental structure factor SM(q) and the computed one, deduced from the considered tetramer, are displayed in Fig. 7. A good agreement can be observed between the curves. The tetramer TT seems to be a plausible intermolecular arrangement in the studied mixture.\nIt seems then that the local order of the AA\u2013W equimolar solution can be characterized by different molecular arrangements, namely the trimers T1, T2, and T3 (AA + 2H2O) and the tetramer TT (AA + 3H2O). The H-bond length as well as the intermolecular energies \u0394E of the trimers and the tetramer, calculated using DFT calculations, are quoted in Table II. One can see that the more energetic H-bonds occur in the ring associations.\nJ. Chem.

In the hydrogen-bonded systems (D\u2013H\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5A), NBO analysis highlights the charge transfer between the lone pairs of the proton acceptor (A) and the antibonding donor orbital \u03c3\u2217(D\u2013H). The stabilization energy E(2), determined using the second-order perturbation approach, quantifies the exchange of intermolecular charge from the donor\u2019s filled orbital NBO (i) to the acceptor\u2019s unfilled orbital NBO (j).56 A higher value of E(2) indicates a more stable interaction between the electron donor and acceptor.

It is important to underline that the most significant intermolecular charge transfer energies occur in H-bond interactions. In addition, the transfer of electron density from lone pairs of water oxygen to the antibonding orbitals of the AA hydroxyl group inside the ring structures (T1, T3, and TT) exhibits the highest values of the stabilization energies, which gives the cyclic cluster greater stability.\nAIM topological analysis50 provides an efficient method for extracting the energetic properties of hydrogen-bonding intermolecular interactions. The H-bonds are characterized by the presence of critical bond points (BCPs) that meet the criteria established by Koch and Popelier.57\u201359 The molecular graphs of the T1, T2, T3, and TT models generated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) level are presented in Fig. 8. The topological parameters summarized in Table IV show that, for all the hydrogen bonds, the electron density \u03c1c and the Laplacian of the electron density \u22072\u03c1c are between 0.018 and 0.039 and between 0.07 and 0.126, respectively, satisfying the Popelier and Koch criteria.60 Figures 9(a) and 9(b) demonstrate a clear inverse relationship between the length of hydrogen bonds and the electron density \u03c1c. Additionally, it reveals a similar correlation with the Laplacian electron density \u22072\u03c1c. The obtained correlation coefficient values were 0.955 and 0.993, respectively, proving the strong association between these computed parameters. Furthermore, the OA\u2013HA\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5OW\u2013HW hydrogen bond interactions exhibit higher values of both \u03c1c and \u22072\u03c1c (Table IV). Higher \u03c1c values designate a\nconcentrated electron density at the BCP, indicating stronger interaction between the oxygen atom OW and the hydrogen atom HA within the hydrogen bond. The elevated\u22072\u03c1c values further demonstrate a sharper electron density gradient, reinforcing the notion of a\nJ. Chem.

The calculation of hydrogen-bond energy EH\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5O is performed using the method described by Espinosa et al.61 It is interesting to note from Table IV that the highest EH\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5O values are exhibited by the OA\u2013HA\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5OW\u2013HW Hbonds, followed by the HA=OA\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5HW\u2013OW ones, which show intermediate EH\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5O values. Lastly, the HA\u2013OA\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5HW\u2013OW H-bonds exhibit the lowest EH\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5O values, providing evidence that they are the weaker ones.\nBased on these findings, it becomes evident that the interactions occurring within the ring structures formed between the oxygen atom of water and the hydroxyl group of acetic acid (AA) are notably stronger than the other hydrogen bond interactions. These observations support the observed trend in both the NBO analysis and the DFT calculations and corroborate the fact that the cyclic trimers as well as the cyclic tetramer seem to better reproduce the local order of the mixture."

            "text": "The reported results in this paper may be considered a detailed investigation of the structural properties of a deuterated equimolar acetic acid\u2013water (AA\u2013W) solution. Neutron scattering experiments at a large modulus of the wave vector in complementarity with DFT calculations and NBO and AIM analyses are conducted to elucidate the H-bond network in the system. By considering various molecular arrangements, we can identify the most probable clusters in the solution. Three dimers (D1, D2, D3), three trimers (T1, T2, T3), and one tetramer (TT) involving one AA molecule and, respectively, one, two, and three water ones are considered. Our results show a significant concordance between the experimental and theoretical structure factors derived from the trimers and the tetramer. Particularly, the cyclic clusters (T1, T3, and TT) show a higher level of agreement with the experimental data, suggesting their plausibility as the more probable intermolecular arrangements in the mixture. The DFT calculations, the NBO analysis, and the AIM analysis are strongly consistent. The formed H-bonds between the oxygen atom of water (OW) and the hydroxyl group of acetic acid (HA\u2013OA) within the ring structures of the trimers T1 and T3, as well as in the tetramer TT, exhibit remarkable strength, the highest energy, and a large degree of stability compared to other H-bond interactions."
