    "abstractText": "Radio wave propagation simulations based on the ray-optical approximation have been widely adopted in coverage analysis for a range of situations, including the outdoor-to-indoor scenario. This work presents O2I ray-tracing simulations utilizing a complete office building floor plan in the form of a laser-scanned point cloud. The simulated radio channels are compared to their measured counterparts at 4 and 14 GHz in terms of path loss and delay and angular spreads. Validation of channel simulations for the O2I case is rare, and so far non-existent for above-6 GHz bands. This work reveals the importance of a floor plan model in accurately simulating the channel; it is confirmed that path loss can be replicated with a simple interior path loss model in place of a detailed building interior model, but neglecting to model the interior results in high delay and angular spread errors. By modeling the interior, the ray-tracing simulations achieve relative mean error of under 10% for delay and angular spreads. Finally, effects of multi-layer insulating window on propagation simulations are reported. Noticeable variation of the penetration loss on a small change of the incident angle of a propagation path causes large changes in estimated coverage.",

INTRODUCTION\nPROVIDING wireless service of sufficient quality to in-door users is an essential goal for network operators. Operators seek to utilize previously unused frequencies, including for example, the above-6 GHz new radio frequency range 2 (NR FR2) [1] in addition to the below-6 GHz legacy NR FR1 [2] radio frequency (RF). In the legacy NR FR1, most indoor users are served by outdoor cellular infrastructure. The same service coverage becomes much more challenging in the FR2, given the higher penetration losses through e.g., building walls, experienced by radio signals. Additionally, increasing demand for energy efficiency [3] has resulted in better insulation of buildings achieved by e.g. multi-layered windows and insulating films. This has generated interest in studying indoor coverage for energy efficient smart cities of the future [4].\nTo this effect, there is a continued interest in outdoorto-indoor (O2I) channel measurements [5]\u2013[11]. The most commonly reported quantity is effect on signal strength inside while being serviced from outside [9]\u2013[11], but many studies also report large scale parameters (LSPs) of multipath channels such as delay and angular statistics [5]\u2013[8].\nP. Koivuma\u0308ki and K. Haneda are with Aalto University, Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, 02150 Espoo, Finland. e-mail: pasi.koivumaki@aalto.fi\nAki Karttunen is with Tampere University, Faculty of Information Technology and Communication Sciences.\nGiven the difficulty involved in conducting large-scale measurement campaigns, measurement-calibrated site-specific simulations are an interesting alternative for coverage estimation. Most published results of wave propagation simulations showcase either wholly outdoor or indoor simulations instead of the O2I case, given that obtaining a complete threedimensional (3D) model of a building can be more difficult than using exteriors obtainable from e.g. public databases. A method that has attracted recent interest is a laser-scanned point cloud of the environment used in ray-tracing [12]\u2013[17]. Laser-scanning can be utilized to obtain a complete model of the building and its floor plan. A number of simulation approaches have been published for O2I scenarios, e.g. [18]\u2013 [23]. In [18], [19] ray-based propagation was combined with finite difference methods using floor plan of the building. In [20], [21] a path loss model was applied to indoor propagation without a model of the building interior. In [22] a \u201cvirtual floor plan\u201d was generated to approximate building interior effects on propagation, while [23] utilized a commercial raytracing tool with complete floor plan of the building. To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, O2I propagation simulations have so far only been compared to measurements in terms of path loss, and only for the below-6 GHz band by e.g. [18], [19], [21]\u2013 [23]. Similarly, while many approaches to O2I simulations have been published, the effects of the building interior model on LSP accuracy have not been studied. Effects of insulating structures of e.g. windows on propagation simulations and estimated coverage due to penetration loss angular selectivity is a similarly unaddressed question.\nTo these open questions, the novel contributions of this work are as follows:\n1) Results of point cloud ray-tracing utilizing a 3D model of the building interior are presented at two frequency bands, 4 and 14 GHz. The frequency bands were chosen as part of LuxTurrim5G [4] to study O2I coverage at below and above-6 GHz bands. By comparing to measurements, path loss error is found to be in line with earlier publications reporting O2I channel simulations. Relative error of less than 10% is achieved for delay and angular spreads at both bands, a result so far unaccomplished for the O2I channel. 2) Effects of modeling the building interior on simulated channel LSPs are studied. It is shown that while path loss can be replicated with reasonable accuracy without having knowledge of the building interior, a floor plan of the building is required for accurate delay and angular spreads.\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n03 15\n9v 2\n[ ee\nss .S\nP] 1\n3 Ja\nn 20\n23\n2 Direct path\nPaths from nearby buildings, interior\nExcluded distant paths\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the O2I site and its laser-scanned point cloud where spatio-temporal channel measurements were performed for validating the ray-tracing results. Section III introduces the point cloud based ray-tracing methods. Section IV presents comparisons between measured and simulated O2I radio channels. The paper is concluded in Section V."

The O2I measurement campaign has been the subject of the authors\u2019 previous publications [6], [24], where a more detailed description of the measurement set-up, methodology and site is provided. A total of two transmit (Tx) antenna locations and 69 receive (Rx) antenna locations were measured at center frequencies of 4.65 and 14.25 GHz. The Tx locations were outside the office building and Rx locations were inside the second floor of an office building, distributed across three different rooms. The Tx antenna was elevated using a personnel lift to be on the same level with the Rx antenna. Both measurements used the same bandwidth of 500 MHz. Directionally-revolved channel impulse responses were obtained by mechanically rotating a horn antenna on the Rx side [24].\nFigure 1 shows an exemplary Power Angular Delay Profile (PADP) obtained from one of the links. Note that weakest gain of the PADP is limited to -150 dB, a noise threshold determined from the PADP. This is done to highlight the excluded distant paths. Signals exist below this threshold, but they are not considered meaningful to represent. For all following analysis, the studied delay range is limited to up to \u03c4 = 350 ns, illustrated with the dashed red line. This is to compensate for the effect of distant buildings which sometimes contribute strong propagation paths [24]. These buildings are not represented in the point cloud model used in ray-tracing, and hence measured paths from them were omitted for comparison. A propagation path is defined as a distinct local maxima in the measured PADP. A search over the PADP [15], [25] derived a set of discrete propagation paths to obtain comparable results to the ray-tracing simulations."

Resolution of the point cloud used in this work is approximately 10 cm. To obtain a point cloud appropriate for ray-tracing simulations, the following steps were performed.\n1) Point clouds obtained outside and inside the office building were aligned and merged into one complete point cloud using common reference points. 2) Vertical interior walls of the second floor and the exterior walls on the level of the Tx-Rx links are extracted from the laser-scanned point cloud by detecting large flat sections [12].

Detection of single-bounce specular reflections from a section of a point cloud is illustrated in Fig. 3. An image of the Tx is calculated for each point in the\npoint cloud using its normal vector.

Windows of the office building were noted to consist of triple- and double-glass\n5 windows as shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The layered window structures were not modeled in the raw point cloud and hence manually measured and modeled by hands. A thin metallic film, likely for added insulation, was known to exist on the interior side of the outermost window. Based on laboratory measurements, effective thicknesses of the metallic films were known to be 7.6 nm and 28 nm for the tripleand double-glass windows, respectively. Exact structure of the insulating metal film company-proprietary and hence is not known to the authors, and thus an effective thickness is used.\nThe simulated penetration loss through the triple-glass window is shown in Fig. 6. The loss through a doubleplasterboard interior wall, which does not use a metallic film, is overlaid. Mean penetration losses across each frequency band are shown. The mean value is used in the ray-tracing simulations. At the 14 GHz band the loss through a triple-glass window oscillates significantly. A change of approximately 2\u25e6 in incident angles of a plane wave can result in penetration loss difference of up to 20 dB. The oscillation is not present at the 4 GHz band, nor for the double-glass window which is not shown. This is a consequence of the simulated material parameters and layered structure, combined with wavelength. Significant constructive and destructive interference happens only at the 14 GHz band. Penetration loss through the interior walls has a similar level for both frequency bands.\nInterior walls of the building separating office spaces were assumed to be typical plasterboard walls consisting of two layers. This structure is shown in Fig. 5(c). Exterior walls of the building are assumed to consist only of windows for simplicity, although there are wooden window frames and some concrete supporting structures included in the facade. The parking structure located opposite to the office building is assumed to consist of concrete.\nWell-accepted ITU-R recommendation P.2040 [30] provides permittivity values and formulas to calculate reflection and transmission coefficients using the multi-layer slab model. Permittivity values used in ray-tracing simulations are reported in Table I. Roughness of reflecting surfaces is not considered to affect the calculated coefficients.\nSpecular reflections up to four bounces are simulated. Diffractions and diffuse scattering are not simulated. Due to being uneven surfaces, trees are assumed not to be sources of important propagation paths. Only interior and exterior walls shown in Fig. 2 are considered as sources of reflected paths. Ceilings and floors of the building are not considered as sources of reflections. Any scatterers, e.g. metallic piping concealed by the false ceiling of the office are not included in the model as they are not visible to the laser-scanner. While performing ray-tracing simulations, two different point cloud models are considered. The first consist of only exterior walls of the office building and nearby buildings. As interior structure of the building is assumed unknown in this case, a distance-dependent path loss model is applied to propagation inside the building [31]. The second model in addition includes all interior walls of the 2nd floor, referred to as full floor plan hereinafter, to test their importance in reproducing the measured propagation channel and its characteristics. For both point clouds a resolution of 10 cm between points is used to\n(a)\n(b) (c)\nFig. 5: Triple-glass (a) and double-glass (b) windows with insulating metallic films, and double-plasterboard interior wall (c).

            "text": "To estimate propagation loss through tree canopies, the direct connection paths between Tx and Rx antennas are analyzed. Note that while well-accepted models exist for tree canopy attenuation [32], new values are estimated in this work to obtain the best result. Attenuation in vegetation is known to be a highly site-specific phenomenon. Their excess losses to the free space losses are of interests because they are attributed to penetration of the direct path through different\n6 window types, interior walls dividing office spaces and tree canopies. The tree losses are estimated by minimizing the difference between measured and simulated excess losses of all direct connection paths. Separate values are determined for tree canopy loss at the two frequency bands.\nPropagation delays \u03c4d and azimuth angles of arrival \u03c6d of direct paths are determined geometrically from the Tx-Rx floor plan of the measurements. Note that due to the propagation environment, it is not feasible to assume that the direct path is always the strongest path. Reflected paths can sometimes be significantly stronger. Due to this, the Tx-Rx coordinates have to be used in a more detailed peak search. The reading of gains in the measured PADPs at the delay and azimuth angle serves as the direct path gain estimate. Specifically, fine estimates of the delay and azimuth angle of arrival of the direct path are identified using the measured PADP as\n(\u03c4\u0302d, \u03c6\u0302d) = arg max \u03c4d\u2212\u2206\u03c4\u2264\u03c4\u2264\u03c4d+\u2206\u03c4, \u03c6d\u2212\u2206\u03c6\u2264\u03c6\u2264\u03c6d+\u2206\u03c6 PADP(\u03c4, \u03c6), (6)\nG\u0302d = PADP(\u03c4\u0302d, \u03c6\u0302d), (7)\nwhere \u00b7\u0302 indicates an estimate of corresponding variable and \u2206\u03c4 and \u2206\u03c6 define delay and azimuth ranges over the PADP to find a local maximum. The fine estimates are required to account for uncertainty of the Tx and Rx coordinate information which are manually obtained during measurements. Search ranges in the azimuth \u2206\u03c6 = 5\u25e6 and in the delay \u2206\u03c4 = 2 ns are chosen, both corresponding the their respective resolutions of the channel sounding. Measured excess loss of the direct path is estimated by subtracting the free space path loss as\nLex [dB] = \u221210 log10 G\u0302d \u2212 10 log10 ( 1\n4\u03c0\u03c4\u0302dfc\n) . (8)\nThe excess loss simulated with point cloud ray-tracing is given by the generic formula\nLex,sim [dB] = Nwdw,1\u2211 i=1 Lwdw,1(\u03b8wdw,1,i) + Nwdw,2\u2211 i=1 Lwdw,2(\u03b8wdw,2,i)+\nNtree\u2211 i=1 Ltree \u00b7 dtree,i \u00b7 qtree,i + Niw\u2211 i=1 Liw(\u03b8iw,i) \u00b7 qiw,i,\n(9)\nwhere Lwdw,k, k = 1, 2 is penetration loss through the triple- and double-glass windows, respectively. Total window penetration losses through Nwdw,k windows are calculated using [30] and the angle of incidence \u03b8wdw,k,i, where the normal and grazing incidence to the window corresponds to 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6, respectively. Penetration losses through Ntree tree canopies are calculated using the canopy loss Ltree, propagation distance inside the canopy dtree,i and heuristic scaling factor qtree,i described in Section III-C. Penetration losses through Niw interior walls are scaled similarly, where Liw is calculated using angle of incidence \u03b8iw,i and multi-layer slab model [30]. Note that in the case of no penetrations of a particular environmental feature its respective term in Eq. (9) is zero.\nTree canopy losses Ltree are obtained by minimizing the mean error between simulated and measured direct path excess\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7: Determining the (a) tree canopy loss, used in Eqs. (9),(10), and (b) interior propagation loss, used in Eq. (10), by minimizing direct path excess loss mean error.\nlosses. The effect of different Ltree on the simulated mean error is shown in Fig. 7(a). The lowest errors, approximately 0.1 dB, are achieved with canopy losses of 0.9 and 1.8 dB/m for the 4 and 14 GHz bands, respectively. The values are in line with what is recommended in [32].\nThe measured and full floor plan simulated excess losses of direct paths are shown in Fig. 8. The excess losses are shown with and without the insulating metal films. The former follows trends of the measured direct path excess loss, while the latter fail to reproduce the trend in measurements. Note that sometimes no metal film results in higher losses than with metal film. This is the effect of the simulated layered materials. It is clear that inclusion of the metal film was critical in accurately reproducing measurements.\nThe measured and simulated excess losses fluctuate strongly for links that belong to Tx2, i.e. 70-138. This because angles of incidence through the triple-glass windows are greater than 45\u25e6, evident from Fig. 2. The oscillating penetration loss through the window is seen in Fig. 6, indicating high selectivity based on angle of incidence. This can be used to explain the difference to measurements for the 14 GHz band, as there is some uncertainty between exact Tx and Rx antenna locations. Even small difference between simulated and actual angle can result in a large change in penetration loss. Overall difference can be attributed to the trees being modeled as homogeneous. Some environmental details are missing from the simulation model, e.g. wooden supporting structures of the windows and structures inside the building. The effect of a concrete support pillar in the facade not included in the model is pointed out for the 14 GHz band.\n7 Tx2Tx1\n(a)\nTx2Tx1Concrete pillar\n(b)\nFig. 8: Measured and simulated excess loss of the direct path at 4 GHz (a) and 14 GHz (b) bands.

Combined with uncertainty in Tx and Rx location estimates that were obtained manually during channel sounding, there can be large differences between the simulated and actual penetration losses of a particular path. This can have a large effect on the overall path gain of the simulated channel.\nThe effect of this sensitivity on channel gain estimates can be demonstrated by an exemplary link Tx2Rx12 at 14 GHz band; see Fig. 2 for the link geometry. The Rx is in Room 1, and the Tx illuminates the building at an angle of incidence approximately at 45\u25e6. Propagation path angles of incidence fall in the strongly oscillating penetration loss region. The PAP of the link is shown in Fig. 9.

Alternative paths were obtained by adjusting the Tx and Rx locations within 20 \u00d7 20 cm2 area so that the resulting path loss of the channel matches the measured best. The effect is summarized in Table II. Trajectories of the 4 propagation paths are drawn in Fig. 10. All of them incident the building at an angle of over 45\u25e6. Path 1 is the direct path, while the other are reflections from interior walls of the building. A change of about 1.5\u25e6 in angle of incidence results in 15 dB change in gains of the path 1 and 2. Angular spread of the measured channel is 42.4\u25e6, while the simulated angular spread with original Tx and Rx locations is 53.4\u25e6. With the adjusted Tx and Rx locations taking into account the uncertainty of their estimates during channel sounding, the simulated angular spread becomes 40.9\u25e6.\nThe same antenna location uncertainty compensation was performed for all simulated Rx locations at 4 and 14 GHz bands to improve the path loss estimation accuracy. Results of the 20 cm adjustment on channel path loss at 14 GHz band are shown in Fig. 11. There is a considerable improvement for links belonging to Tx2 because the building is illuminated at an angle of approximately 45\u25e6. Uncertainty in location estimates has a significant effect. The improvement is smaller for the 4 GHz band because the penetration losses oscillate much less. Overall, RMS errors of simulated path loss decreased from 3.1 to 2.9 dB at the 4 GHz band, and from 5.1 to 3.6 dB at the 14 GHz band. It was necessary to compensate for the antenna location uncertainty in order to perform meaningful comparisons between simulated and measured channels."

Different locations inside the building as seen in Fig. 2 are indicated in Figs. 12(a) and 13(a). Shorthand \u201cR1\u201d stands\n9 for Room 1, \u201cR2\u201d for Room 2, \u201cK\u201d for Kitchen and \u201cC\u201d for Corridor. Shorthand \u201cRT\u201d stands for ray-tracing.\n1) Path loss: Measured and simulated path losses are shown in Figs. 12(a) and 13(a). Path losses obtained with both simulated cases follow trends of the measurement well. Overall, the full floor plan simulation replicates measurements better.\nFigure 12(a) shows that there is a consistent offset of path loss from exteriors RT at 4 GHz. This can partly be explained with missing reflected paths from walls of R1 and R2 as well as adjacent rooms. Additionally, most of the links are in rooms adjacent to the building exterior. The rooms are empty, and in reality the direct paths and reflections from exterior walls propagating in them are not attenuated. Same consistent but smaller offset be seen for the full floor plan from Tx1 to R1 and R2. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that this is a consequence of neglected propagation mechanisms. As seen in Fig. 2, Tx1 transmits to R1 and R2 through many trees. Especially at 4 GHz they can be expected to contribute paths in the form of scattering and diffraction. There is no consistent offset with full floor plan when Tx2 transmits to R1 and R2. As seen in Fig. 2, there is at most one tree between Tx2 and R2, so there are less sources of errors. Nevertheless, there is good correspondence to measured path losses.\nLarge errors from both full floor plan and exteriors RT are observed in the Kitchen at 4 GHz band. Transmitting from Tx1, the error is an overestimation of path loss suggesting missing propagation paths or mechanisms. A possible explanation is scattering from the trees or the building wall that is almost parallel to the direct path from Tx1 to the Kitchen, neither of which are not included in the simulations. Similarly, diffractions from edges of the double-glass window are not included in the simulations. Nevertheless, the Kitchen is an outlier in terms of errors. Transmitting from Tx2, the exteriors RT has a very large error in the Kitchen. This can be attributed to missing propagation paths that enter the building via R2 and are reflected from its walls toward the Kitchen. These paths are included in the full floor plan RT, hence good agreement with measurements.\nFigure 13(a) shows good agreement between measurements and full floor plan RT at 14 GHz. When transmitting from Tx1, exteriors RT path loss exhibits some overestimation particularly in R1 and the Kitchen. This suggests that reflections inside the room and paths from adjacent rooms still contribute to received power, but not as significantly as at 4 GHz. When transmitting from Tx2, exteriors RT shows significant errors while full floor plan RT reproduces the measured path loss well. This is because the building is now illuminated at an incident angle of approximately 45\u25e6, while for Tx1 it was closer to 0\u25e6. For the exteriors RT case, far fewer paths enter the building, and they seem to fall in high penetration loss parts of Fig. 6. For the full floor plan RT case, the many reflections from interior walls mean that more paths are likely to fall in the narrow, low penetration loss parts of Fig. 6, and deliver power to the Rx. The measured path loss is thus significantly lower and better replicated with the full floor plan RT.\n2) Delay spread: Measured and simulated delay spreads are shown in Figs. 12(b) and 13(b). The results show that\ndelay spread obtained using full floor plan RT follows its measured counterpart well at both 4 and 14 GHz bands. Although the measured trends are replicated well, there are a number of large outlier errors that stand out. The errors can be attributed to missing propagation paths, either due to neglected propagation mechanisms or details of the environment. For example, similarly to path loss, noticeably large errors are seen in the Kitchen for link indices 42 \u2212 50. Although not drawn anywhere, the large outliers there are explained by a RT propagation path that takes a very long trajectory via R1 and Corridor to the Kitchen. Delay spread obtained with exteriors RT consistently underestimates the measured ones, although it seems to somewhat follow the trend. This can be attributed to the large number of missing propagation paths from the building interior. Reflections from only the exterior walls are not enough to accurately replicate the measured delay spread, but they result in delay spreads of slighly lower levels.\n3) Angular spread: Measured and simulated angular spreads are shown in Figs. 12(c) and 13(c). Full floor plan RT replicates the measured angular spread of many individual links and trends well. Exteriors RT fails to reproduce the measured angular spread completely. The reason for exteriors RT having some success with delay spread but none at all with angular spread is that in delay domain, paths from the exteriors are realistically spread apart. In the angular domain, they aren\u2019t at all because missing interior means to disregard all propagation paths coming from azimuth angular range between 180\u25e6 to 360\u25e6 shown on Fig. 2. The angular spread is therefore significantly underestimated.\n4) Paths Originating From Exterior and Interior Walls: Having observed that simulations using only building exteriors underestimate delay and angular spreads, measured and full floor plan RT simulated propagation paths of a specific link are studied next. Figure 14 shows the PDP and PAP of link Tx1Rx3 at 4 GHz band. The Rx3 antenna is located in R1 at the corner of the office building, while the Tx1 antenna on the other side of a cluster of trees. The Rx3 location inside R1 is shown in Fig. 10, with Tx1 being approximately toward 135\u25e6. The strongest paths shown with green circles originate from the exterior walls. Figure 14(a) shows that after approximately 200 ns, paths bounded on interior walls are required to approximate the measured PDP. Figure 14(b) shows that paths originating from the exterior walls arrive only from angles between 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6. To reproduce the PAP from approximately 180\u25e6 to 360\u25e6, paths reflected from interior walls are required.\nMeasured delay and angular spreads of the link Tx1Rx3 are 29.9 ns and 46.9\u25e6. With the full floor plan, the simulated delay and angular spreads are 34.6 ns and 49.8\u25e6. While with the exterior wall only, the simulated delay and angular spreads are 19.4 ns and 17.0\u25e6. This further demonstrates that interior paths are required for increased accuracy in reproducing the delay and angular spread values.\n5) Estimation Errors of LSPs: Comparison of the measured and simulated LSPs is summarized in Table III. The mean and standard deviations of the measured and simulated LSPs are shown, as well as the mean and RMS errors of the simulated results against measurements derived from all Tx-Rx links.\n10\n11\nThe positive mean error means that the simulated LSPs are greater than those of measurements. The mean error encompasses accuracy of the channel simulation overall, whereas the RMS error indicates link-specific accuracy. Standard deviation of the LSP provides the range of values in our O2I site.\nFor path loss a mean error of 1.4 and 0.3 dB is achieved using the full floor plan RT at the two bands. Mean error is less than 6 dB for both frequency bands using exteriors RT. Similarly, the RMS errors of path loss are much lower for the full floor plan RT over exteriors RT. Using full floor plan RT RMS errors of 2.9 and 3.6 dB are achieved, while for exteriors RT they are approximately doubled. While the exteriors RT errors in path loss are clearly higher, it can still be said that path loss inside the building can be reproduced to a reasonable degree.\nFor delay and angular spreads describing multipath richness of the environment, full floor plan RT achieves a relative mean error of under 10% at both frequency bands. For reasons discussed in Sections IV-F2 and IV-F3 the mean errors are much higher for exteriors RT. The relative RMS error of delay and angular spreads are high at both frequency bands, tens of percentage points, even when using the full floor plan. This suggests that while the channel is well reproduced on average, the link-specific values are much more difficult to duplicate. This can be explained by simplifications made during RT simulations. Wooden window frames and a few concrete supporting structures in the building facade were ignored by assuming that propagation paths always enter through a window. For example, a reflection from the parking structure, shown in Fig. 2, could be blocked and heavily attenuated by a concrete pillar for one Tx-Rx link but not the next one in the measurements. This effect cannot be reproduced in the simulation due to the assumed homogenized window wall of the building exterior. It is assumed that tree canopies are homogeneous. The mean effect is well reproduced, but in reality a large branch can block a propagation path while another one passes through some leaves. Similarly it was assumed that the interior walls are homogeneous doubleplasterboard walls with an air gap. In reality there are some variations in materials, and the air gaps may contain electrical installations and supporting structures. Another simplification of the RT simulations was calculation of only direct and reflected paths, which is a reasonable explanation for the high RMS error of delay and angular spreads. They are far\n12\nmore sensitive to individual propagation paths and their gains. Nevertheless, even with the simplification, the radio channels are well reproduced, suggesting that the direct and reflected paths are still clearly dominant propagation mechanisms over diffuse scattering and diffractions. While diffraction is known to be an important mechanism in non-line-of-sight conditions, many of the Rx locations are essentially within obstructed lineof-sight of the Tx with a window and some canopy between them. However, no more can be said without further study.\nFinally, the measured standard deviation of LSPs are reproduced well by full floor plan RT. They vary in a range that is similar to the measured results. Using exteriors RT, the standard deviation is not as well reproduced. This can be explained with the less realistic modeling of multipath richness."

While a large number of O2I simulations have been performed and published, validation against measurements is lacking in general. Moreover, this work for the first time in the literature performs the validation for above-6 GHz radio frequency. The Table shows that path loss RMS errors achieved in this work are in line with earlier works. The table also includes comparisons of the delay and angular spreads for the first time in the literature, showing sub-10% mean errors of the simulated values in reference to the measurements. It is difficult to assess how good or bad the RMS errors of tens of %-points are due to lack of earlier publications. The absolute values are for the most part less than approximately 10 ns or 10\u25e6."

            "text": "This work presents comparisons of O2I ray-tracing simulations and measurements performed at 4 and 14 GHz bands utilizing a laser-scanned point cloud. The measurements were conducted at a typical office building with windows covering the exterior and many rooms separated with plasterboard walls. Measured and simulated direct path excess losses were first used to determine distance-dependent propagation losses inside tree canopies and the office building interior. The values were then applied to ray-traced propagation paths with up to\n4 reflections. Ray-tracing simulations were performed with two set-ups; using only exterior walls with no knowledge of building interior and using full floor plan of the level housing Rx antennas. For the former case, the determined interior loss was applied to propagation inside the building in place of a specific floor plan.\nResults from the two ray-tracing set-ups were compared with their measured counterparts in terms of channel LSPs to benchmark the accuracy and importance of building floor plan in reproducing measured channels. The results confirm that it is possible to reproduce the measured path loss to a reasonable degree with a mean error of less than 6 dB at both 4 and 14 GHz bands. A full floor plan reduces the error to under 1.5 dB at both frequency bands. The path loss errors achieved in this work are in line with earlier publications utilizing various approaches to O2I simulations, although the validation at above-6 GHz band is a new achievement.\nConversely, delay and angular characteristics of the channel cannot be accurately reproduced without a floor plan of the building. To this effect, this work reports a first validation of simulated delay and angular spreads at both above and below6 GHz bands. A relative mean error of less than 10% can be achieved after a careful consideration of the building window types. It was shown that penetration losses of multi-layered insulating windows fluctuate strongly across incident angles. This in turn results in large changes in simulated propagation path gains and coverage due to high angular selectivity of the window. This was compensated with small adjustments of the simulated Rx antenna locations to accurately replicate measurements. The RMS error of simulated delay and angular spreads was much larger than mean errors at both bands, but maintained under approximately 10 ns and 10\u25e6. This indicates that while good overall results were achieved with interactions limited to reflections, further study of diffraction and diffuse scattering as O2I propagation mechanisms is required.\nIn the future energy efficiency requirements imposed on buildings can be expected to increase further. This can lead to, e.g., in cold climate countries such as Finland, an increased number of triple-glass windows, upgrades to four glass-panes, and possibly multiple metal films for added insulation and penetration loss. This warrants special considerations and further study of planning and simulating O2I coverage.\n13"
