    "abstractText": "In this study, a heterogeneous catalyst was prepared to enhance photo-Fenton like oxidation of Direct Black-22 (DB-22). Zeolite modified with zinc ferrite was used as a catalyst. The prepared catalyst was characterized using FTIR, SEM, EDS and XRD. The effect of various parameters like catalyst modification with HCl, H2O2 amount, catalyst amount, CaCl2 amount, initial pH, initial concentration and temperature on the decolorization of DB-22 was studied under UV light. Kinetic and thermodynamic properties were investigated. The highest decolorization of DB-22 was found to be 93.3% under the following conditions: initial concentration: 0.070 g/L, initial temperature: 25 \u00b0C, original pH, H2O2 amount: 2.78 g/L, m-ZZF amount: 3 g/L, CaCl2 amount: 3.75 g/L, reaction time: 60 min and UV light. The activation energy was found to be \u201314.76 kJ/mol under the studied conditions. The decolorization reaction was an exothermic reaction, and the calculated reaction enthalpy was \u201317.31 kJ/mol. The activation entropy was calculated to be \u20130.326 kJ/mol. The standard Gibbs free energy change of the activation had a positive value, and it increased with increasing temperature.",

            "text": "Textile dyes account for more than half of the total\ndye production in the world. The dyes used in the dyeing process cause the formation of textile wastewater. This wastewater causes coloration in natural water resources, as well as damaging living organisms and preventing the passage of sunlight. In addition, when mixed with drinking water, it harms human life due to its carcinogenic nature. Removing these dyes from water is important to prevent environmental damage.1 Conventional treatment methods such as biological treatment, coagulation, adsorption, chemical precipitation, solvent extraction, filtration, and electrochemical treatment are ineffective for decolorization of dyes.2,3 They also have some disadvantages such as incomplete destruction of dye, high energy consumption, high operating cost, poor selectivity, incomplete ion removal, and generation of toxic sludge and waste product. Advanced oxidation methods are preferred for dye removal because of their simplicity and effectiveness.2,4,5 Advanced oxidation methods are based on the production of the OH\u2022 radicals.\nThe homogeneous Fenton process is a Fenton reaction in which iron salts are used as catalysts. In this process, hydrogen peroxide, which is used as an oxidant, and iron ions, which are used as a catalyst, react to produce OH\u2022 radicals.6 The use of H2O2 and Fenton reagents with UV light has been known as photo-Fenton oxidation system. UV light irradiation and Fenton reagents cause an increase in the OH\u2022 formation rate. Additional OH\u2022 radicals are formed by either photoreduction of ferric ions (Fe3+) to ferrous ions (Fe2+) or hydrogen peroxide photolysis.2,3,6 Fenton oxidation systems based on the homogeneous Fenton reagent (Fe2+/Fe3+/H2O2) have some disadvantages such as narrow pH range, removal of sludge containing iron ions, and requirement of large amount of chemicals.2\u20134,6 Therefore, heterogeneous Fenton reactions are preferred to eliminate the negative effects of homogeneous Fenton reactions. In the heterogeneous catalyst, the iron is stabilized into the catalyst interlayer space. Hydroxyl radicals are produced by oxidation of hydrogen peroxide with neither pH control nor precipitation of iron hydroxide.6\nFindik: Decolorization of Direct Black 22 by Photo Fenton like ...\nIn heterogeneous Fenton-like processes, spinel ferrites (MFe2O4) can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst. The term M in spinel ferrite structure refers to the divalent metal ions such as Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ etc. Spinel ferrites such as ZnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and NiFe2O4 are used in medicines, sensors, and catalyst carriers thanks to their high mechanical strength, magnetic properties, unique structure, and catalytic performance.7,8 The use of zeolites modified with semiconductors can be an alternative catalyst for a variety of important reactions.1,2 Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with cavities, unique structures and chemical compositions, uniform pores and channels, high surface area, thermal stability, and an excellent adsorption ability. Conventional zeolites are constructed by tetrahedral SiO4 and AlO4 units.1,9,10 There are at least 41 known types of natural zeolite.1 Some of the most known and abundant types of natural zeolite are clinoptilolite, phillipsite, heulandite, mordenite, chabazite, and ferrierite.11 Azo dyes are the most important synthetic dyes with \u2013N=N\u2013 bonds in their molecular structure. They can be classified according to number of azo groups, such as monoazo, diazo, triazo, polyazo, and azoic.12 Direct black 22 (DB-22) is one of the tetra azo dyes used in textile industry for dyeing cellulosic fibers such as cotton, wool, viscose, rayon, and paper. The high concentration of DB-22 in wastewater harms the environment with its carcinogenic properties, toxicity, organic matter content, and strong color.13 For this reason, wastewater containing DB-22 should be released to the environment after being treated. There are few studies in the literature on DB-22 removal. In their study, Hien et al.13 investigated the catalytic ozonation of DB-22 using different metal slags. Carvalho et al.14 examined the removal of DB-22 using microaerated upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. Gomes et al.15 investigated the degradation of DB-22 using homogeneous and heterogeneous photo-Fenton advanced oxidation process. They used LED light as a source of radiation, and ferrous sulfate and iron residue as catalysts. In another study, Menezes et al.16 investigated the effect of the combination of anaerobic process and micro-aeration (continuous and intermittent) on DB-22 removal. Shu et al.17 examined the decolorization of DB-22 using the UV/H2O2 process, ozonation, and pre-ozonation coupled with UV/H2O2. Moreover, some other studies focused on the photoelectrochemical oxidation of DB-22 under elevated oxygen pressure and the adsorption of DB-22 using polymeric adsorbent.18,19 The aim of this study is to investigate photo-Fenton like oxidation of DB-22 using zeolite modified zinc ferrite. Kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the DB-22 decolorization and the effects of the reaction parameters such as catalyst modification with HCl, catalyst amount, H2O2 amount, salt addition, pH, initial dye concentration, temperature were also investigated. The zeolite and synthesized catalysts were characterized using FTIR, SEM, EDS and XRD."

These XRD peaks of the Z coded sample are compatible with the clinoptilolite with PDF card no 00-013-0304. This result shows that the zeolite was composed of clinoptilolite. As shown in Fig.1-b, all peaks of natural zeolite accept 26.74\u00b0 disappeared after the preparation of m-ZZF. According to the PDF card, peaks appear at 34.96\u00b0, 52.74\u00b0 and 61.97\u00b0 matchwell with PDF card 00-010-0467 (Franklinite, ZnFe2O4). Spinel ferrite ZnFe2O4 coats the surface of zeolite. This improves the photocatalytic activity of m-ZZF. Figure 2 shows the SEM images and EDS results of zeolite (Z) and m-ZZF. As can be seen in SEM image of Z, particles had an irregular shape and porous surface. In m-ZZF image, zinc ferrite agglomerated on the surface of the zeolite. According to EDS results, zeolite was mainly composed of O, Si, and Al, in addition to small amounts of K, Mg, Ca and Fe. The percentage of iron and zinc considerably increased in m-ZZF.

The reactor was filled with 200 ml of DB-22 solution with a known concentration, and the catalyst was added, then magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark to ensure a complete equilibration of adsorption/desorption of DB-22 on the catalyst surface. In order to find the amount of dye adsorbed on the catalyst surface in the dark, a sample was taken from the dye solution and its absorbance was measured. Then, a UV lamp with a quartz tube was placed in the center of the reactor at a distance of 2 cm from the bottom. The surface of the reactor was covered with aluminum foil to prevent light penetration. While the DB 22 solution was stirred continuously, the UV lamp was switched on and the reaction time was started immediately. Stirring rate was kept constant at 800 rpm in all experiments. The experiments were carried out at the original pH of the dye solution, except for the experiments in which the pH effect was examined. The samples taken from the reactor at regular intervals were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. Then, the absorbance of the dye solution was recorded at 481 nm using UV-spectrophotometer to calculate decolorization. Decolorization of DB-22 dye was calculated using the Eq. 1\nDecolorization, % = (1)\nwhere, C0 and C represent the concentration of the DB22 at the beginning of the reaction and at corresponding time, respectively.

The peak at 1030 cm\u20131 is the proof that the zeolite was composed of alumina silicate. The peak at 1030 cm\u20131 is sensitive to the change in Si and Al content. The band at 1630 cm\u20131 is related to the O-H stretching vibrations and the adsorbed H2O molecules.20\u201323 As seen in Fig. 3, there were a few differences between Z, ZZF, and m-ZZF spectrum. In ZZF and m-ZZF, the peaks at 800\ncm\u20131 and 1630 cm\u20131 disappeared. The peak at 1000 cm\u20131 in m-ZZF was the result of the shift of the peak at 1030 cm\u20131 in Z, and the transmittance at 1000 cm\u20131 increased. With the addition of zinc ferrite to the structure of the zeolite, the ratio of Al and Si changed. Maybe that is why, the transmittance increased. The FTIR spectrum of m-ZZF after it was used in DB-22 decolorization was similar to that before it was used and only the transmittance at 1000 cm\u20131 decreased."

The results are presented in Fig. 4-b. As seen in Fig. 4-b, the decolorization of DB-22 without the addition of H2O2 was less than that with the addition of H2O2. The photocatalytic decolorization of the DB-22 enhanced when the H2O2 amount was introduced to the Fenton system due to the accelerated generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022).24 According to our results, the decolorization rate decreased with increasing H2O2 concentration. In 60 min, the decolorization rate increased from 69.5% to 76.4% when the H2O2 concentration decreased from 5.55 g/L to 2.78g/L. At high H2O2 concentrations, excess hydrogen peroxide reacts with the produced OH\u2022 radicals and causes the formation of less reactive radicals like hydrogen dioxide.21,25 The reactions between OH\u2022 radicals and excess hydrogen peroxide are given by the equations below26:\nOH\u2022 + H2O2\u2192HO2\u2022 + H2O (2)\nHO2 \u2022 + OH\u2022 \u2192O2 + H2O (3)\nOH +OH\u2022 \u2192H2O2 (4)\nA similar result was reported by Abharya et al.24 They reported that photocatalytic degradation decreased after the\nH2O2 concentration of 0.0389 M and when the amount of H2O2 was above the critical value, the reaction between excess H2O2 and the generated OH\u2022 radicals caused a decrease in photocatalytic activity over time.

They found that the dye degradation decreased when the H2O2 concentration was increased from 250 to 750 mg/L.

After the catalyst loading of 3 g/L, the decolorization rate decreased. Under the studied conditions, the optimum catalyst amount was found to be 3 g/L.

In another study, Ji et al.28 investigated the decolorization of methylene blue using catalyst and heterogeneous photo Fenton system and reported that the decolorization of methylene blue increased with increasing the catalyst from 0.25 to 1.5 g/L.

The experiments were done within the initial concentration range of 0.025\u20130.070 g/L with a m-ZZF amount of 3 g/L, H2O2 amount of 2.78 g/L, and CaCl2 amount of 3.75 g/L, at original pH, at an initial temperature of 25 \u00b0C and under UV light. Fig. 7 shows the effect of initial dye concentration and reaction time on the decolorization of DB-22. The experimental results showed that the decolorization rate of DB-22 was faster in the first 10 min. After 10min, decolorization rate slowed down and remained almost constant after the reaction time of 30 min. As seen in Fig. 7, the decolorization of DB-22 increased with the increasing initial concentrations. The decolorization of DB-22 for the reaction time of 60 min was found to be 81.3%, 90.2%, 90.5%, 91%, and 93.3% at the initial dye concentrations of 0.025, 0.040, 0.050, 0.060, and 0.070 g/L, respectively. In the literature, Ejhieh and Khorsandi1 reported similar results for the photocatalytic decolorization of Eriochrome Black T using NiS-P zeolite. They found that the decolorization of Erichrome Black T increased with increasing the initial concentration from 10 mg/L to 40 mg/L. Having a lifetime as short as a few nanoseconds, hydroxyl radicals react immediately after formation.\nAs the number of dye molecules per unit volume increases, so does the probability of collisions between organic matter and oxidizing species. As a result, decolorization rate increases. In their study, Gan and Li27 found that the decolorization of Rhodamine B increased with increasing the initial concentration from 2.5 to 50 mg/L using ricehull based silica supported catalyst by Fenton like process. The probability of collision between dye molecules and near-surface activating species increases with the increase of dye concentration per volume."

As mentioned in the experimental section, the experiments were performed without cooling, and a temperature increase was observed. Initial decolorization rate was calculated for the reaction time of 10 min. An increase of 2 \u00b0C from the initial temperature was observed in 10 min. Figure 8 shows the effect of temperature on the initial decolorization rate. As can be seen in Fig. 8, the initial decolorization of DB-22 in 10 min decreased with increasing temperatures. The decrease in the decolorization rate with the increasing temperatures shows that the reaction occurred under exothermic conditions. An increase in the reaction temperature causes a decrease in the oxygen solubility in the solution. The rate of electron withdrawal from the surface of the photocatalyst decreases due to the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration.31 Andreozzi et al.3 investigated the effect of temperature on the photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol and reported that temperature had a negative effect on the degradation at pH 3. The presence of oxygen is important to keep high the concentration of photogenerated OH\u2022 radicals on the surface of the catalyst. The concentration of the photogenerated holes decreases due to the decrease in oxygen solubility at high reaction temperatures.\nFindik: Decolorization of Direct Black 22 by Photo Fenton like ..."

The results are given in Fig. 9. Decolorization rate using 3 g/L m-ZZF and (3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.78 g/L H2O2) processes were 2.4% and 5.7% respectively. The effect of UV light was studied using processes such as, 3g/L m-ZZF, 2.5g/L CaCl2 and (3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2). Decolorization of (UV + 3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2) process was greater than that of the individual processes such as UV, (UV + 3g/L m-ZZF) and (UV + 2.5g/L CaCl2). Decolorization rate was 76.1 % at 30 min and 82.3 % at 60 min using (UV + 3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2) process. To identify the effect of the H2O2, experiments were also done using (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2), (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2 + 2.5 g/L CaCl2), (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2 + 3 g/L m-ZZF) and (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2 + 3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2). (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2) and (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2 + 3 g/L m-ZZF) processes provided nearly the same decololorization rate as 82% at 60 min. Decolorization rate at 60 min using (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2 + 3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2) process was found to be 91.5%. The decolorization of DB-22 for the reaction time of 30 min was found to be 76.1% at (UV+ 3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2) process. Addition of H2O2 increased the color removal and decolorization of DB-22 at 30 min was found to be 83.2% at (UV + 2.78 g/L H2O2 + 3 g/L m-ZZF + 2.5 g/L CaCl2) process. With increasing CaCl2 amount from\n2.5 to 3.75 g/L, decolorization rate increased from 83.2% to 90.1% in 30 min reaction time. With the synergetic effect of UV, m-ZZF, H2O2 and CaCl2, the highest color removal was achieved in 30 minutes. Ionic strength effects the electrostatic interaction between the catalyst surface and dye molecules. Addition of anions might allow the neutralization of the positive sites on catalyst surface. Nonelectrostatic interaction between dye molecules and neutral sites could occur due to van del Walls forces or low energetic H-bonds.27 According to Sudrajat and Babel30, the Cl\u2022 radicals formed as a result of the surface chain transfer reaction of the chlorine ion oxidizes the organic compounds. Considering these results, the possible decolorization mechanism of DB-22 over m-ZZF may consist of the following steps: Due to the non-electrostatic interaction between the dye molecules and the neutral sites, dye molecules may be adsorbed on the catalyst surface in the presence of Cl\u2013 ions.27 Electron/hole pairs are generated on the m-ZZF surface under UV light. Electrons on m-ZZF react with H2O2 to produce both OH\n\u2013 ions and OH\u2022 radicals. Photogenerated holes could react with OH\u2013 ions or adsorbed water to generate OH\u2022 radicals.33,34 In the presence of salt, the Cl\u2022 radicals could oxidize dye molecules.30 The generated radicals react with DB-22 and degradation products are formed."

In the study, the variation of COD with time was investigated under the following reaction conditions: initial dye concentration: 0.04 g/L, m-ZZF amount: 3 g/L, H2O2 amount: 2.78 g/L, CaCl2 amount 3.75 g/L, original pH, and UV lamp. As seen from Fig. 10, COD removal increases with increasing time. 26.9% COD removal was obtained at the end of 60 min reaction time. While the decolorization of DB-22 was found to be 79.5% and 90.1% at the 10 min and 30 min reaction time respectively, low COD removal was achieved under the studied conditions. COD removal showed the partial oxidation of the organic pollutants to CO2 and H2O. The colorless intermediates were formed as a result of DB-22 oxidation. These intermediates cause low COD removal.34 According to results, photo-Fenton like process is more useful for decolorization of DB-22 than COD removal. The operating cost of the photo-Fenton process includes cost of chemicals and energy. Electricity is used in the UV lamp and mixing the process. According to \u00c7al\u0131k35, operating cost of the photo-Fenton process changed between 13.46\u201320.13 \u20ac/m3 for the used chemicals and electrical energy for treatment of textile wastewater."

This result showed that the decolorization rate decreased with increasing temperature, as mentioned in the section 3.4.

The sign of the enthalpy indicates an exothermic reaction. The value of activation entropy was calculated as \u20130.326 kJ/molK. The negative value of \u0394S0 indicated that the photocatalytic decolorization of DB-22 was less random and the transition state formed in the degradation process had a lower structural freedom compared to the reactants, and this also confirms that the process was irreversible.37,38 The lowest absolute values of Ea, \u0394H0, and \u0394S0 found for the catalyst used in the study are indicative of its highest catalytic activity. According to the literature, the value of the activation energy determines whether the reaction is diffusion or reaction rate controlled. If the activation energy is lower than 29 kJ/mol, this indicates that the reaction is controlled by diffusion process.39,40 In this study, a low activation energy was obtained; so it can be said that the photocatalytic decolorization of DB-22 using m-ZZF was a diffusion controlled process. The standard Gibbs free energy was calculated using Eq. 1036,38\n(10)\nTable 2 gives the thermodynamic parameters. As can be seen in Table 2, standard Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G0) had a positive value and it increased with increasing temperatures.

Kot katalizator je bil uporabljen zeolit, modificiran s cinkovim feritom. Pripravljeni katalizator je bil okarakteriziran z uporabo FTIR, SEM, EDS in XRD. Pod vplivom UV svetlobe je bil preu\u010devan vpliv razli\u010dnih parametrov na razbarvanje DB-22, kot so modifikacija katalizatorja s HCl, koli\u010dina H2O2, koli\u010dina katalizatorja, koli\u010dina CaCl2, za\u010detni pH, za\u010detna koncentracija in temperatura. Raziskane so bile kineti\u010dne in termodinami\u010dne lastnosti. Najvi\u0161je razbarvanje DB-22 je bilo 93,3 % pod slede\u010dimi pogoji: za\u010detna koncentracija: 0,070 g/L, za\u010detna temperatura: 25 \u00b0C in prvotni pH, koli\u010dina H2O2: 2,78 g/L, koli\u010dina m-ZZF: 3 g/L, koli\u010dina CaCl2: 3,75 g/L, reakcijski \u010das: 60 min in UV svetloba. Aktivacijska energija dolo\u010dena pri preu\u010devanih pogojih je bila \u201314,76 kJ/mol, reakcija razbarvanja pa je eksotermna z reakcijsko entalpijo \u201317,31 kJ/mol. Izra\u010dunana vrednost aktivacijske entropije je \u20130,326 kJ/mol. Standardna Gibbsova sprememba proste energije za aktivacijo ima pozitivno vrednost in se z nara\u0161\u010danjem temperature vi\u0161a."
