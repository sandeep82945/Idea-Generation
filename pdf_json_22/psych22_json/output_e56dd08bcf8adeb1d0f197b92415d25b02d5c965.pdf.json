    "abstractText": "Background. Suicidal behavior and substance use disorders (SUDs) are important public health concerns. Prior suicide attempts and SUDs are two of the most consistent predictors of suicide death, and clarifying the role of SUDs in the transition from suicide attempt to suicide death could inform prevention efforts. Methods. We used national Swedish registry data to identify individuals born 1960\u20131985, with an index suicide attempt in 1997\u20132017 (N = 74 873; 46.7% female). We assessed risk of suicide death as a function of registration for a range of individual SUDs. We further examined whether the impact of SUDs varied as a function of (i) aggregate genetic liability to suicidal behavior, or (ii) age at index suicide attempt. Results. In univariate models, risk of suicide death was higher among individuals with any SUD registration [hazard ratios (HRs) = 2.68\u20133.86]. In multivariate models, effects of specific SUDs were attenuated, but remained elevated for AUD (HR = 1.86 95% confidence intervals 1.68\u20132.05), opiates [HR = 1.58 (1.37\u20131.82)], sedatives [HR = 1.93 (1.70\u20132.18)], and multiple substances [HR = 2.09 (1.86\u20132.35)]. In secondary analyses, the effects of most, but not all, SUD were exacerbated by higher levels of genetic liability to suicide death, and among individuals who were younger at their index suicide attempt. Conclusions. In the presence of a strong predictor of suicide death \u2013 a prior attempt \u2013 substantial predictive power is still attributable to SUDs. Individuals with SUDs may warrant additional suicide screening and prevention efforts, particularly in the context of a family history of suicidal behavior or early onset of suicide attempt.",

Suicidal behavior and substance use disorders (SUDs) are important public health concerns. Prior suicide attempts and SUDs are two of the most consistent predictors of suicide death, and clarifying the role of SUDs in the transition from suicide attempt to suicide death could inform prevention efforts. Methods. We used national Swedish registry data to identify individuals born 1960\u20131985, with an index suicide attempt in 1997\u20132017 (N = 74 873; 46.7% female). We assessed risk of suicide death as a function of registration for a range of individual SUDs. We further examined whether the impact of SUDs varied as a function of (i) aggregate genetic liability to suicidal behavior, or (ii) age at index suicide attempt. Results. In univariate models, risk of suicide death was higher among individuals with any SUD registration [hazard ratios (HRs) = 2.68\u20133.86]. In multivariate models, effects of specific SUDs were attenuated, but remained elevated for AUD (HR = 1.86 95% confidence intervals 1.68\u20132.05), opiates [HR = 1.58 (1.37\u20131.82)], sedatives [HR = 1.93 (1.70\u20132.18)], and multiple substances [HR = 2.09 (1.86\u20132.35)]. In secondary analyses, the effects of most, but not all, SUD were exacerbated by higher levels of genetic liability to suicide death, and among individuals who were younger at their index suicide attempt. Conclusions. In the presence of a strong predictor of suicide death \u2013 a prior attempt \u2013 substantial predictive power is still attributable to SUDs. Individuals with SUDs may warrant additional suicide screening and prevention efforts, particularly in the context of a family history of suicidal behavior or early onset of suicide attempt.\nIntroduction\nSuicidal behaviors are a serious and persistent public health concern. Worldwide, approximately 700 000 individuals die by suicide on an annual basis (World Health Organization, 2021). Suicide attempts, defined by the National Institute of Mental Health as non-fatal events of suicidal intent (National Institute of Mental Health, 2019), outnumber suicide deaths by a factor of up to 30 (Han et al., 2016), and history of suicide attempt is one of the more reliable predictors of later suicide death (Franklin et al., 2017). Among individuals who survive an initial suicide attempt, risk for subsequent death by suicide is much higher than in the general population: In a longitudinal Swedish cohort study, 5.6% of those with an index attempt later died by suicide (Niederkrotenthaler, Mittendorfer-Rutz, Mehlum, Qin, & Bjorkenstam, 2020) while another Swedish study reported a prevalence of 0.7% in the general population (Edwards, Ohlsson, Sundquist, Sundquist, & Kendler, 2020a). Identifying predictors of the transition from suicide attempt to later suicide death has the capacity to reduce deaths by providing guidance to clinicians about who, among their patients with a history of suicidal behavior, may benefit most from direct efforts at prevention and intervention.\nSubstance use disorders [SUD; to include alcohol use disorder (AUD) and drug use disorders (DUD)] are strongly associated with suicidal behavior across multiple countries (Barak-Corren et al., 2017; Chai et al., 2022; Flensborg-Madsen et al., 2009; Gobbi et al., 2019; Hesse, Thylstrup, Seid, & Skogen, 2020; Lynch et al., 2020). Indeed, in a recent study that utilized electronic health records to predict suicide attempts and death, SUD exhibited the strongest association with suicidal behavior (Barak-Corren et al., 2017), and a more recent report specifically identified several substance-related ICD-9 codes (e.g. poisoning by unspecified drug or medical substance, drug withdrawal syndrome, cocaine dependence) as among\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002240 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nthose most prominently associated with suicide attempt (Barak-Corren et al., 2020). Prior research demonstrates that co-occurrence of SUD and suicidal behaviors is due to familial factors (e.g. shared genetic and/or family environmental influences) (Colbert et al., 2021; Docherty et al., 2020; Edwards et al., 2020a, 2022; Mullins et al., 2022), non-familial shared liability (Edwards et al., 2021a), and a potentially causal relationship (Edwards et al., 2020a, 2022), underscoring the complexity of these associations.\nWhile abundant evidence supports a role for SUD as an indicator of and/or causal risk factor for individual suicidal outcomes (e.g. ideation, attempts, or death), and previous research has found that the risk of suicide varies across specific substance use disorders (SUDs) (Crump, Sundquist, Kendler, Edwards, & Sundquist, 2021), little is known about the extent to which specific SUD \u2013 e.g., alcohol, cannabis, or opioids \u2013 are related to the transition from non-fatal suicide attempt to subsequent death by suicide. That is, within an already high-risk population of those with a history of suicide attempt, what is the utility of SUD status as an indicator of risk for suicide death? Understanding the features of individuals at highest risk could facilitate targeted prevention efforts and reduce the rate of suicide deaths.\nWith this in mind, the current study leveraged Swedish national registry data on suicide attempts, death, and SUD to test whether, among those with a history of suicide attempt, specific SUD were associated with suicide death. We further pursued a series of secondary research questions. First, given the heritable nature of suicidal behavior (Althoff et al., 2012; Brent & Mann, 2005; Brent & Melhem, 2008; Docherty et al., 2020; Edwards et al., 2021b; Glowinski et al., 2001; Mullins et al., 2022; Pedersen & Fiske, 2010) and prior evidence that high genetic liability for psychopathology can exacerbate the effects of other risk factors (Musliner et al., 2015; Peyrot et al., 2014; Polimanti et al., 2021; Wendt et al., 2021), we tested whether SUD status interacted with aggregate genetic liability to suicidal behavior (non-fatal attempt or death) when assessing risk of suicide death. Second, because earlier age of onset for suicidal behavior or other psychopathology for can be considered an indicator of severity (Kessler et al., 2007; Thompson, Dewa, & Phare, 2012), we tested whether effects of SUD registration on likelihood of suicide death differed as a function of age at index suicide attempt, an objective measure readily available in Swedish registries.\nBoth our primary and secondary analyses have the potential to be clinically informative through their identification of subgroups at particularly high risk for suicide death. Given the nationwide coverage of the data, these analyses are unique in their access to sufficient sample sizes to capture generally low-prevalence predictors (e.g. dependence on a specific substance) of a low-prevalence outcome (suicide death). Furthermore, the analyses do not rely on samples ascertained for other psychiatric illnesses (e.g. major depressive disorder), thereby increasing their generalizability."

Individuals with a recorded attempt prior to 1997 were not included in the study due to reduced data coverage. We also included records of suicide death from the Swedish Mortality register, using the same ICD-10 codes as for suicide attempt. Individuals registered with suicide death on the same date as suicide attempt were excluded to avoid misclassifying an attempt that did eventually lead to death as non-fatal (N = 98). In the database, we also included first registration of the following substance-specific SUDs: Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis, Cocaine/Stimulants, Hallucinogens, Opiates, Sedatives, Multiple Substance Abuse (MSA). A registration for MSA indicates that the individual has experienced problems with more than one substance and does not on its own provide information about which specific substances are of concern. We elected to include MSA registrations despite their inherent lack of specificity because this category included a large number of individuals with a suicide attempt (N = 13 733), among whom N = 5257 (38.3%) did not have a registration for a specific SUD. ICD codes are provided in the Supplement.\nWe further included year of birth, sex and a family genetic risk score for suicide death (FGRSSD) and suicide attempt (FGRSSA); details on FGRS derivation, which we have reported previously (Kendler et al., 2021a; Kendler, Ohlsson, Sundquist, & Sundquist, 2021b; Kendler, Ohlsson, Sundquist, & Sundquist, 2021c), are provided in the supplement."

We report the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The SUD registrations were treated as time-dependent covariates, so that an individual was considered free of SUD until the time of registration. Individuals registered with SUD prior to the index date of suicide attempt were considered exposed during the entire follow-up period. In multivariable analyses, all first-time registrations for each applicable SUD were included in the model, such that a subject with multiple registrations (e.g. for both AUD and cannabis use disorder) was coded as being affected accordingly.\nFor the secondary research questions, we included FGRSSD and FGRSSA in the models and interacted these variables, in separate models, with each specific SUD registration; this approach avoids the inclusion of multiple interaction terms, which would complicate interpretation. We evaluated the interactions with FGRSSD and FGRSSA on both the multiplicative and the additive scale. For the additive interaction, we present the relative excess\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002240 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nrisk due to interaction (RERI) (Knol, van der Tweel, Grobbee, Numans, & Geerlings, 2007). The RERI is calculated as the difference between the effect based on the summation of the separate effects included in the interaction term and the effect in the joint exposure category. In another secondary analysis, we tested the interaction between SUD registration and age at index suicide attempt. Conversion to the additive scale using the RERI requires a nuanced interpretation of effects given the typical conventions of the approach: namely, for both components of the interaction term, higher values are associated with poorer outcomes. Note that, to facilitate interpretation in the models including an additive interaction with age at attempt, we coded the data such that the parameter estimate for the interaction term reflects a one year decrease from the sample\u2019s mean age at index attempt. Correspondingly, assuming a positive effect of SUD registration, a positive parameter estimate would reflect an increase in risk among individuals with earlier age at index attempt.

Complete results are presented in online Supplementary Table S1. Main effects HRs for FGRSSA ranged from 1.02\u20131.08 and differed from 1 for cannabis, cocaine/stimulants, hallucinogens, and sedatives. We did not observe significant interactions between SUD and FGRSSA on the additive scale (RERI = \u22120.01 to 0.40), though all but one estimate (for cocaine/stimulants) was positive. Similarly, interactions on the multiplicative scale were not statistically significant, and all but two (for cannabis and cocaine/stimulants) had HRs > 1. The consistency of direction of effect suggests that genetic liability to suicide attempt may exacerbate the effects of SUD on transition to suicide death, but the magnitude of the impact is weak.\nTotal sample Females Males\nSample size (Individuals with non-fatal suicide attempt) 74 873 34 980 (46.7%) 39 893 (53.3%)\nSuicide death N (%) 2283 (3.0%) 855 (2.4%) 1428 (3.6%)\nAge at index attempt (S.D.) 33.4 (9.8) 32.5 (10.2) 34.1 (9.4)\nAge at suicide death (S.D.) 37.1 (8.8) 37.2 (9.2) 37.0 (8.5)\nYear of birth 1974 (7.7) 1974 (7.8) 1974 (7.7)\nTime to suicide death since index attempt (months) 52.4 (54.8) 57.0 (57.9) 49.7 (52.8)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002240 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nwere positive (HR = 1.15\u20131.17), and in each case differed significantly from 1 (Table 4). All interactions on the additive scale were positive (RERI = 0.14\u20131.11); with the exception of cannabis and MSA, the RERI estimates were significantly different from the null expectation. Thus, the joint effects of SUD registration and high FGRSSD resulted in a higher likelihood of transition to suicide death than expected based on the sum of their main effects. We did not observe significant interactions on the multiplicative scale, with one exception [MSA \u00d7 FGRSSD; HR = 0.94 (0.89\u20130.996)].\nEffect of age at index suicide attempt Our primary analyses included age at index suicide attempt as a covariate. In this secondary analysis, we included an interaction term between SUD registration and age at index attempt, which tests whether the effect of an SUD registration varies as a function of the age at which an individual first exhibited medically serious suicidal behavior. Complete results are available in online Supplementary Table S2. With respect to main effects, the HRs for age at index attempt were <1, indicating that earlier age at index attempt was associated with an increased risk of subsequent suicide death, but CIs overlapped 1. However, the variable scale is a very modest increment \u2013 one year, with the potential range of\n13\u201358 years \u2013 raising the possibility that even a small effect size could be meaningful when considered across the life course.\nWe did observe significant interactions between SUD and age at index suicide attempt (online Supplementary Table S2). The positive RERI estimates ranged from 0.03\u20130.14 and were statistically significant for all SUD except cannabis. Because these represent the effects of a one-year decrease in age at index attempt (relative to the mean age of 33.4), this indicates that the joint effects of SUD registration and earlier age at index suicide attempt on transition from attempt to death are worse than expected given the main effects of these predictors.\nThese effects are reproduced when testing interaction terms on the multiplicative scale (see Figure). We observed significant interactions with all SUD registrations other than AUD and cannabis, with corresponding HRs <1. For both scales, significant results indicate that the association between SUD and risk of suicide death is exacerbated among those with earlier age at index suicide attempt (i.e. during adolescence). The effect of SUD then declines among those whose first attempts occurred in early adulthood, and tapers further for later ages of onset. In some cases (e.g. among those with a registration for cocaine/stimulants), the HR for SUD registration does not differ significantly from 1 among those whose index suicide attempt occurred during later adulthood, as evidenced by CIs that overlap 1."

In multivariate analyses accounting for sociodemographic factors and registration for a range of SUD, we found that registration for alcohol use disorder, opiates, sedatives, and multiple substances (an aggregate ICD code) were associated with increased risk of suicide death among those with a previous suicide attempt. In secondary analyses, aggregate genetic risk scores for suicide attempt or death were largely positively associated with increased risk of this transition, and the impact of most SUD registrations was more pronounced among persons with higher genetic liability for suicide death. Furthermore, risk of suicide death was higher among those whose index suicide attempt occurred earlier in life, and this effect was exacerbated among those with any SUD registration other than for cannabis.\nTable 2.

Substance use disorders have also been positively associated with risk for suicide death, and this study examined whether, even among the high-risk group of individuals with a prior attempt, that association remained. Indeed, we found that the prevalence of suicide death was 3\u20134 times greater among those with a SUD registration\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002240 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nrelative to individuals with no SUD who had previously attempted suicide. Thus, this group may be of particular interest to clinicians in the effort to reduce the burden of suicide.\nWe have previously shown that problems with opiates or sedatives are more strongly associated with risk for suicide death in the population at-large, with HRs of 4.62\u20136.39 in adjusted models (Crump et al., 2021). In the current study, these registrations, along with those for AUD and the aggregate category of \u2018multiple substance abuse\u2019, were prominently associated with risk of suicide death even within the high-risk group of people with a prior suicide attempt, albeit at attenuated HR estimates. Some other studies have also reported especially strong associations with opioid and polysubstance problems (Chai et al., 2022). Thus, while the time to transition from suicide attempt to suicide death did not differ markedly across substances, patients with opiate or sedative use disorders, in addition to those with AUD and MSA, likely warrant particular clinical attention. For example, use of assessments that explicitly address both prior attempts and SUDs, such as the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Posner et al., 2011), may be especially informative.\nOverall, aggregate genetic liability to both non-fatal and fatal suicide outcomes, operationalized by our FGRS, were associated with an increased risk of transitioning from suicide attempt to suicide death. This likely reflects, in part, the substantial genetic correlation between non-fatal attempt and death, which has been previously reported (Edwards et al., 2021b; Mullins et al., 2022). However, the magnitude of effect was stronger for FGRSSD than for FGRSSA (HR = 1.15\u20131.17 v. HR = 1.02\u20131.08, respectively). This could reflect the differing levels of severity of suicide attempt v. suicide death, but an alternative explanation is that qualitative genetic differences between attempt and death result in an improved specificity/predictive utility of FGRSSD relative to FGRSSA for the transition from attempt to death. That the effects of most SUD interacted with FGRSSD on the additive scale is consistent with the diathesis-stress model of psychopathology (Kendler, 2020; van Heeringen & Mann, 2014) in that those with an elevated genetic propensity for suicide death are more sensitive to the risk of suicide conferred by manifestation of one or more SUDs. This could be due to differences in coping abilities among those with SUD (Cerea, Bottesi, Grisham, Vieno, & Ghisi, 2017; Van Gundy, Howerton-Orcutt, & Mills, 2015) or exposure to other stressors that are more common among this population, such as divorce (Franco et al., 2019; Kendler, Lonn, Salvatore, Sundquist, & Sundquist, 2017) or financial difficulties (Edwards, Ohlsson, Sundquist, Sundquist, & Kendler, 2020b; Franco et al., 2019).\nOur findings must be considered in the context of several limitations. First, because we employ registry data rather than selfreported SUD and suicide attempt status, we are unable to capture less severe SUD cases and suicide attempts that do not necessitate medical attention. A substantial proportion of suicide attempts do not come to the attention of medical personnel (Piscopo, Lipari, Cooney, & Glasheen, 2016), and these attempters may be less likely to subsequently die by suicide. It is possible that inclusion of these cases would impact the observed effect sizes of SUD and/or the FGRS. Second, our analyses do not account for psychiatric comorbidity other than SUD. However, in our study examining the role of SUD and suicide in a previous context, we found that while inclusion of psychiatric comorbidity modestly attenuated effect sizes of SUD, it did not impact overall conclusions (Crump et al., 2021).\nThird, we elected to include registrations for MSA despite the lack of specificity inherent to this category, which introduces a corresponding imprecision in our findings. Our rationale was that this category included a large number of individuals known to have SUD, many of whom (38.3%) did not otherwise have a specific SUD registration, and their exclusion was deemed inappropriate. In exploratory analyses, excluding this category in the multivariate model yielded slightly higher HRs for the remaining, specific SUD categories, with the only notable differences being that the CIs for cannabis and hallucinogens did not include 1 (i.e. differed from the null) in the less inclusive models. We therefore note that the substance-specific HRs reported herein are potentially conservative.\nFourth, our FGRS do not directly correspond to polygenic scores derived from individual genotype data. They rely on the manifestation of phenotypes (here, SA or SD) in relatives and corresponding registrations, and are sensitive to outcome prevalence. Fifth, we are unable to reliably identify substance abuse treatment in our nationwide study population, and could therefore not incorporate this information into our models. Sixth, we did not code individuals with a T40 registration (N = 386) as having a SUD: Due to lack of sufficient specificity in the ICD-10 codes to which we have access, we could not determine which substance was ingested. Because alcohol poisoning was included, this results in a slight imbalance in the severity of problems reflected across alcohol v. other substances. Finally, while our findings benefit from nationwide data on Swedish-born residents, they might not generalize to other countries or populations with different sociodemographic characteristics. In particular, Sweden\u2019s medical system is socialized, which might contribute to its superior access and efficiency relative to, for example, the United States (Schneider et al., 2021; Tandon, Murray, Lauer, & Evans, 2001) and impact who seeks treatment for SUD and/or suicidal behavior. However, the universal access to health care means that the confounding effect of unequal health care biases our findings to a lesser extent.\nIn summary, findings from the current study indicate that, even among a high-risk group of individuals with a history of suicide attempt, SUD remains a prominent predictor of transition to suicide death. The associations were most pronounced for individuals with MSA, AUD, or sedative dependence; they were further exacerbated among persons with high aggregate genetic liability to suicide death and those with earlier onset of non-fatal suicidal behavior. These results underscore the importance of assessment for SUD and family history of suicide among individuals with a history of suicidal behavior, as they warrant particular concern for future death by suicide. Recognizing the role of SUD in a population already at high risk for suicide can provide guidance for clinicians and highlight potential opportunities for preventive interventions and treatment to reduce suicide deaths.\nSupplementary material.
