1. **Investigate the use of advanced machine learning algorithms for flow regime identification and model development.** The study used a simple k-means algorithm for flow regime identification and linear regression for model development. More advanced algorithms, such as neural networks or support vector machines, could potentially improve the accuracy of the MPFM.


2. **Explore the use of additional sensors to improve the accuracy of the MPFM.** The study used only pressure sensors to measure the flow rates. Additional sensors, such as temperature or density sensors, could potentially provide additional information that could be used to improve the accuracy of the MPFM.


3. **Investigate the performance of the MPFM in different operating conditions.** The study evaluated the performance of the MPFM in a controlled laboratory environment. It would be beneficial to investigate the performance of the MPFM in different operating conditions, such as in the presence of solids or in high-pressure or high-temperature environments.


4. **Develop a field-ready version of the MPFM.** The prototype MPFM was not designed for field use. A field-ready version of the MPFM would need to be more rugged and reliable, and it would need to be able to operate in a variety of environmental conditions.


5. **Investigate the use of the MPFM for other applications.** The MPFM could potentially be used for other applications, such as measuring the flow rate of slurries or other multiphase fluids. It would be beneficial to investigate the performance of the MPFM in these applications.
