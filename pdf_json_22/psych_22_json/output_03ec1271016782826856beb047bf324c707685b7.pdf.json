Moreover, the PMS\u2010related disability and attitude toward menstruation were investigated as secondary outcomes. Data description: We provide data generated in a randomized controlled trial with two\u2010parallel arms carried out on 92 female university students aged 18\u201335 years who had moderate to severe PMS, residing at halls of the Tabriz Uni\u2010 versity of Medical Sciences. PMS severity was assessed during two menstrual cycles before intervention (baseline) and during two cycles just after ending the two\u2010month intervention using Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) and the quality of life using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire\u2014Short Form (Q\u2010LES\u2010Q\u2010SF) on days 1\u20132 and 11\u201313 of the menstrual cycle at the baseline and post\u2010intervention. Also, the PMS\u2010related disability was assessed using Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and attitude toward menstruation using Menstrual Attitude Ques\u2010 tionnaire (MAQ) at the baseline and post\u2010intervention. Participant satisfaction and views on intervention effectiveness were also assessed using a single Likert question.",

The syndrome leads to various consequences, including physical, psychological, behavioral, and social complications [2]. Most previous studies show a positive effect of in-person cognitive-behavioral therapy on PMS severity [3\u20135]. However, due to some limitations such as distance and time limits, as well as cost constraints, some women are unable to access such therapy [6]. We found only a trial, conducted in a developed country (Germany) [7], with promising results on the positive effect of an alternative method of the therapy named internet-based cognitivebehavioral therapy (ICBT) on PMS. This method has no limitations of the in-person method. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of internet-based counselling with a cognitive-behavioural approach on the PMS severity and the quality of life of Iranian female university students suffering from PMS. In addition, the PMSrelated disability and attitude toward menstruation were investigated as secondary outcomes. The details of the experiments and analysis performed and findings based on these data have been published in 2022 [8].\n*Correspondence: mhammadalizadehs@gmail.com; alizades@tbzmed.ac.ir\n4 Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, South Shariati Street, 5137975846 Tabriz, Iran Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

Those with a positive result in the screening provided written informed consent and filled in the 21-item Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) [10] during their next menstrual cycle, also completed the 21-item validated Persian version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [11] on one of the days of their mid-follicular phase (days + 7 to + 10 of the menstrual cycle). After exclusion of those with severe depression, the remaining participants completed the DRSP for the second menstrual cycle, the 3-item Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) [12] and the 33-item Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ) [13] on day 1 or 2 of the second cycle, also 14-item of the Quality-of-Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire\u2014Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) [14] twice (on days 1\u20132 and days 11\u201313 of the menstrual cycle). Finally, female students with moderate to severe PMS diagnosed by the DRSP were randomized into the groups.\nThe internet-based educational content for eight sessions was provided during two months for the intervention in a scheduled manner. The control group did not receive any intervention during the study period, but received the content after doing all post-test assessments.\nPrimary outcomes were the mean score of total PMS symptoms, and quality of life during the perimenstrual and the late follicular phases. Secondary outcomes were the mean scores of sub-scales of DRSP, PMSrelated disability, and MAQ domains. All were assessed at baseline post-intervention.\nAlso, participant satisfaction with the intervention was assessed using a single 5-point Likert question, and their opinions on the effectiveness of intervention using another single 6-point Likert question.\nData have been entered in an SPSS Spreadsheet and analyzed using the software (Table\u00a01)."
