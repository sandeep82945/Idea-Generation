    "abstractText": "Major depressive disorder is a common mental health disorder characterized by a high incidence among women.1 The World Health Organization has reported that depression seri ously endangers women\u2019s health and will become the world\u2019s most common disease by 2030.2 As an important component of positive psychology, resilience has become a hot topic in research on neuropsychiatric diseases.3 Chronic stress is one of the most important risk and maintenance factors for mental illness, but many people show positive adaptations to adversity and do not exhibit serious mental illness; this phenomenon is called resilience.4 The postpartum period is complex and sometimes traumatic for females. Many infants are separated from their mothers after birth and cannot receive breastfeeding from their mothers or have skin-to-skin contact with them because of problems such as prematurity, neonatal illness and maternal illness, a phenomenon known as \u201cmaternal separation\u201d or, in animals, \u201cpup separation\u201d (PS). Postnatal PS is an important environmental factor for mothers during lactation, affecting the mother\u2019s hormone secretion and promoting postpartum depression and anxiety. Studies have shown that high secretion of prolactin and oxytocin and low secretion of anti diuretic hormones and androgen during lactation can prevent postpartum anxiety and depression, thereby optimizing the stress response, whereas chronic inhibition of estrogen and progesterone caused by lactation may have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.5 However, long interruptions in mother\u2013infant skin-to-skin contact",

Many infants are separated from their\nmothers after birth and cannot receive breastfeeding from their mothers or have skin-to-skin contact with them because of problems such as prematurity, neonatal illness and maternal illness, a phenomenon known as \u201cmaternal separation\u201d or, in animals, \u201cpup separation\u201d (PS). Postnatal PS is an important environmental factor for mothers during lactation, affecting the mother\u2019s hormone secretion and promoting postpartum depression and anxiety. Studies have shown that high secretion of prolactin and oxytocin and low secretion of anti diuretic hormones and androgen during lactation can prevent postpartum anxiety and depression, thereby optimizing the stress response, whereas chronic inhibition of estrogen and progesterone caused by lactation may have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.5 However, long interruptions in mother\u2013infant skin-to-skin contact\nCorrespondence to: G.

Stress during this period is one of the main risk factors for depression. Therefore, preventing stress-induced depression in the postpartum period is of great importance. Pup separation (PS) is a natural paradigm of postpartum care; however, the effect of different PS protocols during lactation on stress-induced depressive behaviours in dams is unknown. Methods: Lactating C57BL/6J mice were subjected to no pup separation (NPS), brief PS (15\u00a0min/day, PS15) or long PS (180 min/day, PS180) from postpartum day 1 to postpartum day 21 and were then subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 21 days. Behavioural tests, specifically the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) test and tail suspension test (TST), were performed. The expression of mRNA and protein in the hippocampus and microbiota composition were also assessed. Results: We observed CRS-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in NPS dams. In addition, in NPS dams, micro glial activation and the levels of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3, caspase-1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 were increased, whereas expression levels of collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) and \u03b1-tubulin were decreased. However, immobility time in the TST was lower in PS15+CRS dams than in NPS+CRS dams, and time spent in the centre during the OFT and in the open arms during the EPM test was higher in PS15+CRS dams, indicating resilience. Expression of hippocampal biomarkers of neuroinflammation was inhibited and levels of CRMP2-mediated neuroplasticity were increased in PS15+CRS dams. Notably, we observed taxonomic changes in the cecal micro biota across different PS groups, as well as relationships between gut microbiota composition and some biomarkers of hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity. Limitations: The sample size for gut microbiota analysis in this study was small. Conclusion: Collectively, the results of this study confirm that brief PS confers stress resilience in CRS-induced behavioural deficits and reverses hippo campal neuroinflammation\u2013neuroplasticity injury and gut microbiota imbalance.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E155\nmay disrupt the mother\u2019s normal secretion of hormones and induce changes in adult neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus,6 making mothers vulnerable to environmental risk factors and mental disorders. There exist few recent relevant studies, and more research is needed to explore the influence on mothers of changes in environmental factors during lactation. This knowledge can help with the development of personalized plans for women during lactation, enhance their stress resistance and reduce the occurrence of depression.\nNeuroinflammation is involved in the underlying pathologic mechanisms of depression. The hippocampus is one of the brain regions that experiences the most damage during stress-related emotion disorders.7 The microglia, as resident immune cells, are among the most important inflammatory cells in the central nervous system. Active microglial cells in the hippocampus can promote the activation of a series of regional inflammatory responses,8 including those involving NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-18 (IL-18).9\u201311 In an animal model of depression, emerging evidence indicates that neuroinflammation can damage hippocampal neuroplasticity; for example, hippocampal volume decreases by 4%\u20136%, and neuronal axons and dendritic trees retreat.12 During pregnancy, inflammatory states range from higher levels at implantation and during childbirth to lower levels in midpregnancy.13 Collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) has been recently considered a novel microtubuleassociated protein,14 which confers neuroprotective effects by modulating hippocampal neuroplasticity.15 In adulthood, the hippocampus exhibits a high level of plasticity and has receptors for steroid and peptide hormones that change throughout pregnancy. Many of these hormones cause neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus throughout late pregnancy and the early postpartum period.16\nThe proteomic results of a clinical study showed that CRMP2 is associated with the stress-induced microbiota\u2013 gut\u2013inflammasome\u2013brain axis, which is a novel research topic.17 The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis consists of a communication network that controls and integrates gut and brain function and that seems to be a central modulator of health and disease. Given the unique inflammatory and immune changes that occur during pregnancy, the composition of the maternal gut microbiome evolves as pregnancy advances.18 Microbiome disorders can influence the development of pathologic mechanisms in major depressive disorder.19 A recent study in NLRP3-deficient mice confirmed the involvement of the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis in depression and showed a close connection between the NLRP3 pathway and gut microbiota.20 Using antiinflammatory drugs has been shown to change the variety and abundance of beneficial bacteria.21\nThe PS phenomenon is a natural paradigm of postpartum care. Clinical studies indicate that poor maternal and child contact care during the first year after birth makes mothers more vulnerable to depression.22,23 Previous rodent studies showed that after a long duration of PS, the maternal care of dams was significantly impaired, but the\ndams showed different degrees of anxiety- and depressionlike behaviours and memory alterations.24,25 However, the effect of different PS protocols on stress-induced depressive behaviours in dams is unknown, and their neurobiologic mechanism remains to be elucidated.\nWe hypothesized that different PS protocols during lactation would differentially affect stress vulnerability or resilience to stress re-exposure after the perinatal period in dams. Therefore, in this study, a suite of different PS protocols was developed and applied in mice, and the animals were then exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) to investigate the behavioural phenotypes in dams. To further explore the neurobiologic mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we then investigated micro glial activation, some biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus, and the composition of gut microbiota."

Mice that experienced CRS also exhibited significant elevation in mRNA expression levels of NLRP3 (t6\u00a0=\u00a07.135, p\u00a0<\u00a0 0.001,\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E159\nFigure 3B), caspase-1 (t6\u00a0=\u00a05.342, p\u00a0= 0.002, Figure 3C), IL-1\u03b2 (t6 = 4.119, p\u00a0= 0.006, Figure 3D) and IL-18 (t6\u00a0=\u00a06.899, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Figure 3E). However, the levels of CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin, which are typical biomarkers of neuroplasticity, were signifi-\ncantly lower in the CRS group (CRMP2: t6\u00a0=\u00a04.987, p\u00a0= 0.003, Figure 3F; \u03b1-tubulin: t6 = 9.889, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Figure 3G).\nAs shown in Figure 3H, Iba1 protein levels were also elevated in mice subjected to the CRS procedure (t6\u00a0=\u00a04.844, p\u00a0=\nE160 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3)\n0.003). The protein expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were also significantly higher in the CRS group than in the control group (NLRP3: t6\u00a0=\u00a03.859, p\u00a0= 0.008, Figure 3I; caspase-1: t6 = 3.457, p = 0.014, Figure 3J; IL-1\u03b2: t6 = 13.17, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Figure 3K; IL-18: t6\u00a0=\u00a05.643, p\u00a0= 0.001, Figure 3L). The protein expression levels of CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin were significantly lower in the CRS group (CRMP2: t6\u00a0=\u00a07.448, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Figure 3M; \u03b1-tubulin: t6 = 3 .929, p\u00a0= 0.008, Figure 3N).\nBrief PS promoted resilience to CRS-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in dams\nIn experiment 2, we explored the effects of various PS protocols on CRS-induced behavioural deficits in dams. In the\nOFT, there were significant differences in the frequency of entering the centre (F2,27 = 20.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and time spent in the centre (F2,27 = 4.797, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0165) among dams that underwent different PS protocols. Using post hoc analysis, we found that dams in the PS15+CRS group showed higher frequency of entering the centre than those in the NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS groups (NPS+CRS v. PS15+CRS, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001; PS180+CRS v. PS15+CRS, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001; Figure 4A). The PS15+CRS dams spent more time in the centre than the PS180+CRS dams (p\u00a0= 0.020, Figure 4B), but there was no significant difference between the PS15+CRS and NPS+CRS groups. Additionally, no significant differences were observed between PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams in the frequency of entering the centre and time spent in the centre.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E161\nIn the EPM test, there were significant differences in the frequency of entering the open arms (F2,27\u00a0=\u00a09.665, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and time spent in the open arms (F2,27\u00a0 =\u00a0 12.95, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001) among dams that underwent different PS protocols. Using post hoc analysis, we found that dams in the PS15+CRS group showed higher frequency of entering the open arms than those in the NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS groups (Figure 4C). The PS15+CRS dams spent more time in the open arms than the NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS dams (Figure 4D). However, there were no significant differences in the frequency of enter ing the open arms or the time spent in the open arms between PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams.\u00a0\nDuring the TST, dams that underwent different PS protocols exhibited significant differences in immobility time (F2,27\u00a0 =\u00a0 12.95, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001). In the post hoc analysis, the PS15+CRS dams exhibited significantly less immobility time than the NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS dams (Figure 4E). The PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams exhibited no differences in immobility time.\nBrief PS inhibited hippocampal neuroinflammation in dams exposed to CRS\nWe explored whether different PS protocols affected microglial activation and the levels of some inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus after CRS. The ANOVA revealed significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of Iba1, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 among dams that underwent different PS protocols (Iba1: F2,12\u00a0=\u00a056.8, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; NLRP3: F2,12 = 122.1, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001; caspase-1: F2,12\u00a0 =\u00a0 32.9, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001; IL-1\u03b2: F2,12\u00a0 =\u00a0 37.5, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001 ; IL-18: F2,12\u00a0 =\u00a0 23.29, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The post hoc analysis showed that the expression level of Iba1 mRNA was significantly lower in the PS15+CRS group than in the NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS groups, but there was no difference between the PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS groups (Figure 5A). The mRNA analysis also showed lower expression levels of NLRP3 (Figure 5B), caspase-1 (Figure 5C), IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5D) and IL18 (Figure 5E) in PS15+CRS dams than in PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams, but there were no differences between PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams.\nThe ANOVA showed significant differences in the protein levels of Iba1, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 among dams that underwent different PS protocols (Iba1: F2,12 =\u00a0 5.136, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.024; NLRP3: F2,12\u00a0 =\u00a0 4.983, p\u00a0 = 0.027; caspase-1: F2,12 = 4.161, p\u00a0= 0.042; IL-1\u03b2: F2,12\u00a0= 5.412, p\u00a0= 0.021; IL-18: F2,12 = 4.747, p\u00a0= 0.030). The post hoc analysis showed that Iba1 protein levels were significantly lower in PS15+CRS dams than in NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS dams (Figure 5H). Western blot analysis showed lower protein levels of NLRP3 (Figure 5I) and IL-18 (Figure 5L) in PS15+CRS dams than in PS180+CRS dams, but no differences between PS15+CRS and NPS+CRS dams or between NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS dams. In addition, the protein levels of caspase-1 (Figure 5J) and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5K) were lower in PS15+CRS dams than in NPS+CRS dams, but no differences were found between PS15+CRS and PS180+CRS dams or between NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS dams.\nHippocampal neuroplastic injury was inhibited in dams exposed to brief PS and CRS\nWe also measured the mRNA expression levels of markers associated with neuroplasticity. The ANOVA revealed significant differences in CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin levels among dams in the 3 groups (CRMP2: F2,12\u00a0 =\u00a0 38.89, p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001; \u03b1-tubulin: F2,12 =\u00a061.53, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Post hoc analysis indicated that the mRNA levels of CRMP2 (Figure 5F) and \u03b1-tubulin (Figure 5G) were significantly higher in PS15+CRS dams than in the other groups. There were no differences between PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams.\nIn addition, ANOVA showed significant differences in CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin protein levels among dams in the 3 groups (CRMP2: F2,12 =\u00a0 5.301, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.022; \u03b1-tubulin: F2,12 =\u00a06.253, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Post hoc analysis indicated that the expression levels of both CRMP2 (Figure 5M) and \u03b1-tubulin (Figure 5N) were higher in PS15+CRS dams than in PS180+CRS dams, but there were no differences between NPS+CRS and PS15+CRS dams, nor were there any differences between PS180+CRS and NPS+CRS dams.\nCompositional analysis of cecal microbiota in dams that underwent various PS protocols\nOur analysis of various indices of alpha diversity (Chao1, Simpson, Shannon, Pielou e [where \u201ce\u201d refers to evenness], observed species, Faith pd [where \u201cpd\u201d refers to phylogenetic diversity] and Good\u2019s coverage) in the cecal microbiota showed no significant differences (Figure 6A\u20136G). We also performed a beta diversity analysis, consisting of principal coordinates analysis to show the distribution of microbes in the intestinal microbiota, followed by permutational multivariate ANOVA. The results showed inter group differences in intestinal distribution among the 3 groups (F\u00a0=\u00a02.4488, p\u00a0= 0.008, Figure 6H), indicating that the composition of the cecal microbiota changed after the various PS processes.\nWe also investigated taxonomic changes. Analysis of the murine cecal microbiota showed a lower level of Actinobacteria and a higher level of Proteobacteria in PS180+CRS dams than in NPS+CRS dams (Actinobacteria: F\u00a0=\u00a09.141, p\u00a0= 0.015, post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.014, Figure 7A; Proteobacteria: F\u00a0=\u00a06.415, p\u00a0= 0.032, post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.041, Figure 7B). At the family level, as shown in Figure 7C, Erysipelotrichaceae abundance was significantly lower in the PS180+CRS dams than in the NPS+CRS or PS15+CRS dams (F\u00a0=\u00a014.93, p\u00a0= 0.005; post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.004; post hoc comparison of PS15+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.025).\nAdditionally, at the genus level, the relative abundance of Allobaculum was significantly lower in PS180+CRS dams than in NPS+CRS and PS15+CRS dams (F\u00a0=\u00a016.81, p\u00a0= 0.004; post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0 = 0.003; post hoc comparison of PS15+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.022; Figure 7D). Bifidobacterium abundance was significantly higher in NPS+CRS dams than in PS15+CRS and\nE162 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3)\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E163\nPS180+CRS dams (F\u00a0=\u00a012.27, p\u00a0= 0.008; post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS15+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.027; post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0 = 0.008; Figure 7E). Although Oscillospira abundance was significantly higher in PS180+CRS dams than in NPS+CRS dams (F\u00a0 =\u00a0 7.015, p\u00a0 = 0.027; post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.023; Figure 7F), Alistipes abundance was significantly higher in PS180+CRS dams than in both NPS+CRS and PS15+CRS dams (F\u00a0=\u00a012.19, p\u00a0= 0.008; post hoc comparison of NPS+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0 = 0.007; post hoc comparison of PS15+CRS and PS180+CRS, p\u00a0= 0.037; Figure 7G).\nIn the analysis of species abundance clustering, it was clear that the main microbiota differed among dams with different PS protocols, with Akkermansia dominating in the cecal micro biota of dams that underwent brief PS (Figure 8).\nRelativity analysis of gut microbiota composition and hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity\nTo explore the relations between microbiota composition and levels of some biomarkers of hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity, we selected the first 20\u00a0 bacteria at the family and genus levels in the compositional analysis for further correlation analysis. We performed correlation analysis and false discovery rate multiple-comparison correction for the expression levels of proteins in the intestinal microbiota and inflammatory and plasticity molecules. The results showed that among CRS dams that underwent different PS protocols, hippocampal levels of Iba1 (Actinobacteria: r\u00a0=\u00a00.758, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018; Proteobacteria: r\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u20130.794, p\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.011), CRMP2 (Proteobacteria:\nE164 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3)\nr\u00a0=\u00a00.735, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024; Deferribacteres: r\u00a0=\u00a00.892, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and \u03b1-tubulin (Deferribacteres: r\u00a0=\u00a00.813, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) were correlated with the relative abundance of some microbes of the gut microbiota at the phylum level of microbial distribution (Appendix 1, Supplemental Figure 2). Results at the family\n(Appendix 1, Supplemental Figure 3) and genus (Appendix 1, Supplemental Figure 4) levels of microbial distribution further supported the relations between gut microbiota composition and the activation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity impairment in the hippocampus.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E165"

            "text": "In this study, we explored the effect of various PS protocols during lactation on dams with CRS-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviours, along with potential mechanisms of neuroinflammation, neuroplasticity and changes in the gut microbiota. We first determined that CRS induced anxietyand depression-like behaviours in dams that did not undergo the PS procedure, with these behaviours being associated with microglial activation; upregulated levels of expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2; and downregulated levels of expression of CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin. However, the brief PS procedure promoted resilience to the behavioural deficits induced by CRS in dams. Unlike the situation in NPS+CRS dams, microglial activation and increased\nexpression of some biomarkers of neuroinflammation (including NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2) were inhibited in PS15+CRS dams, and brief PS increased the expression levels of CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin. More importantly, the different PS protocols induced significant changes in the composition of the microbiota in dams.\nApplication of CRS is a widely used model in rodents and has been shown to induce depressive behaviour in male and nonparous female animals.29,30 We explored the behavioural responsiveness of dams to CRS using the OFT, EPM test and TST. The OFT is widely used to evaluate locomotor activity and anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in rodents. Animals naturally prefer dark areas; as such, decreased locomotion and thigmotaxis to the brightly lit open areas and staying close to the walls of the field represent increased\nE166 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3)\nanxiety- and depression-like behaviours.31 A rodent with an aversion to open space will stay longer in the closed arm. The EPM test is based on the same phenomenon and is widely used to assess anxiety-like behaviours.32 Immobility during the TST is due to an inability or a reluctance to exert effort, which indicates despair in rodents and is often used to assess depression-like behaviours.33 In our study, time spent in the centre or open arms and the frequency of entering the centre or open arms during the OFT and EPM test, respectively, were significantly lower, whereas immobility in the TST was greater, in dams exposed to CRS. These results indicate significant behavioural deficits in the NPS dams that underwent CRS. Recent studies have documented anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in rodents induced by CRS,29,30 consistent with our results.\nThe application of PS involves the same procedure as matern al separation, but it has different priorities. Previous studies focused on the effects of maternal separation on offspring.34,35 Given the CRS-induced behavioural deficits observed in NPS dams, our study further explored the effect of various postpartum PS procedures on the stress response behaviours of dams following CRS applied after weaning. In previous studies, long-duration PS altered hormone levels and activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and potentiated depression-like states in female rats;36 prolonged PS also impaired both short- and long-term memory and increased anxiety-like behaviours in rat dams,37 damaging their postpartum mental health. However, those previous studies did not use a second stressor after the various PS protocols. In our study, we subjected dams to secondary stress after exposure to PS. We observed that mice experiencing a long duration of PS and those that did not experience any PS both exhibited lower presence in the centre or open arms and lower frequency of entering the centre or open arms during the OFT and EPM test, respectively, and increased immobility time during the TST, all of which suggest significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviours, but compared with NPS dams, the degree of anxiety- and depression-like symptoms in dams after a long duration of PS was not elevated. This finding indicates that a long duration of PS during lactation may increase the sensitivity of dams to additional stress but may not affect the degree of anxiety and depression.\nNotably, in our study, the PS15 dams, which were exposed to CRS after weaning, showed stress resilience behaviours. Specifically, PS15+CRS dams exhibited more time in the centre or open arms and higher frequency of entering the centre or open arms in the OFT and EPM test, respectively, and lower immobility time during the TST than the PS180+CRS dams and NPS+CRS dams, which indicated a resilience phenomenon. In recent years, the effect of resilience in preventing depression has attracted increasing attention.38 In our previous study,39 dams that underwent brief PS showed resistance to the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like behaviours caused by injection of lipopolysaccharide, which is consistent with the current results. In contrast to the significant decrease in interactions with offspring, such as pup retrieval and pup licking,37,40 observed in dams subjected to PS of long duration, many studies have shown a significant increase in the amount\nof interaction between dams and pups after brief PS,41 and this positive interaction improved the postpartum mental health of mothers during lactation.42 This finding suggests that a brief interruption of mother\u2013infant contact is beneficial for mothers\u2019 postpartum mental health during lactation and provides a new concept for the prevention of depression. However, there are few studies on the mechanism of stress resilience caused by brief PS.\nNeuroinflammation is involved in the pathology of stressinduced depressive behaviours.43\u201345 Application of CRS has been shown to induce persistent low-grade inflammation in rodents,46 and many studies have found that these effects of CRS can be blocked by anti-inflammatory and antidepressant drugs.47,48 In the current study, we found that CRS significantly upregulated microglial activation and the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in the hippocampus of dams that did not undergo PS, which indicates that hippocampal neuroinflammation was increased by CRS. Microglia are key immune cells in the brain. Microglial activation can accelerate the release of some inflammatory factors, including IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2, which play neurotoxic roles in depression.8 The compound NLRP3 is an intracellular multiprotein complex that links the perception of danger to the proteolytic activation of proinflammatory cytokines.49 When NLRP3 is activated, it activates caspase-1 and promotes the conversion of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into bioactive IL-1\u03b2, which in turn causes an inflammatory response.50 Caspase-1 can increase the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, produce corresponding mature cytokines and aggravate a series of inflammatory reactions.51 The interleukin IL-18 is a member of the cytokine interleukin family and is widely expressed in activated microglia, astrocytes and neuronal cells. Some studies have shown that the level of IL-18 is significantly increased in patients with depression.52 The NLRP3 inflammatory body cleaves precursors into mature IL-18 through increased caspase-1 activity, thus activating downstream transduction pathways to produce some inflammatory factors, which attack the brain. In addition, the increase in IL-18 release caused by NLRP3 activation is closely related to microglial activation.53\nThe activation of neuroinflammation and the release of some inflammatory factors can aggravate brain injury, especially through their effects on neuroplasticity. Our study showed significant downregulation of CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin in CRS dams, which represented damage to neuro plasticity in these animals. \u03b1-Tubulin is one of the main components of the microtubule system, and CRMP2 interacts directly with \u03b1-tubulin to modulate its function.54,55 The protein CRMP2 is also related to the mechanisms of repair and regeneration that occur in adult brain neurons.56 Our previous studies confirmed that CRMP2 was involved in the chronic unpredictable mild stress animal model, accompanied by differential regulation of DNA methylation at the CRMP2 promoter region.57 This protein also interacts with \u03b1-tubulin, and regulation of CRMP2 activity influences neuronal plasticity and neurite length,58 which further shows that CRMP2 affects microtubule plasticity. Phosphorylation of CRMP2 reduces its rate of binding to \u03b1-tubulin59,60 and affects the polymerization or depolymerization of micro tubule dimers in axonal growth cones.\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3) E167\nIn this study, we found that brief PS inhibited the activation of hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity impairment in dams exposed to CRS after weaning. Specifically, microglial activation and the expression of some inflammatory cytokines, including NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2, in the hippocampus were decreased in PS15+CRS dams, and the PS15 protocol also increased the expression of CRMP2 and \u03b1-tubulin. These findings suggest a possible neurobiologic mechanism for resilience to stress exposure after brief PS during lactation. The mechanism of this resilience may be closely related to the neuroimmune hypothesis regarding PS-associated adversity.61 A hypothesis that involves the effects of neuroinflammation on vulner ability to depression has been gradually accepted by researchers. The functional heterogeneity of microglia provides biologic support for the phenotypic difference in maternal behaviours. Microglia can remove harmful substances, improve neuroplasticity in the brain62 and produce antidepressant effects by regulating autophagy.63 A prospective study showed that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduced the risk of depression in puerperal women,64 and further research showed that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids effectively inhibit neuroinflammation by suppressing microglial activation.65\nA gene\u2013environment interaction model for depression66 indicates that genetic susceptibility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression, mainly by regulating inflammation in the brain. A recent study67 showed that PS alters transcriptomic patterns, potentially resulting in neuro biologic changes; these changes have not yet been shown to lead to differences in behaviour but may provide conditions for various responses to repeated stress. Lactating rodents are sensitive to stress.68 After dams are subjected to mild stress, such as brief PS, timely compensation enables the animals to better adapt to subsequent stress, thus promoting their postpartum mental health. These findings may represent the mechanism by which separation from pups changes the activity of the inflammasome in dams exposed to various PS protocols.\nNeuroinflammatory factors can affect morphology and microtubule plasticity. However, in this study, the brief PS protocol administered during the lactation period inhibited neuroplastic injury in the hippocampus in dams that experienced CRS after weaning. Neuroprotection mediated by CRMP2 is associated with resilience. Deletion of this compound from the brain has been previously shown to affect locomotor activity in mice.69 Brain-specific CRMP2 deletion leads to developmental deficits in neurons; enlargement of the ventricles; and impairment of social behaviour, locomotor activity, learning and memory.70 A previous study confirmed that CRMP2-mediated neuroprotection and microtubule dynamics are increased in a resilience model of acute depression-like behaviours.71 Some studies72 have suggested a pathway that may interlink the activity of the serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) with CRMP2 expression and dephosphorylation through elevated mRNA expression of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via 5-HT4R. Upregulated expression of neurotrophic factors, including BDNF,\ninhibits the phosphorylation of CRMP2 protein and increases CRMP2 levels, which promotes the growth of axons and dendrites.\nBy assessing neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity, we further studied changes in the gut microbiota of dams subjected to various PS protocols and CRS to explore the underlying mechanism of resilience. Intriguingly, we found a lower level of Actinobacteria and a higher level of Proteobacteria in dams subjected to long PS, and the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was also lower in dams subjected to long PS. In previous studies, Bifidobacterium treatment prevented depression-like behaviour in mice; however, in our study, Bifidobacterium was lower in dams subjected to PS, a potential example of PS having an effect, but not the effects of different durations of PS on chronic stress during the postpartum period.73 In clinical research, the abundance ratio of Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria was significantly decreased in patients with major depression,74 and a decrease in Bifidobacterium abundance was commonly observed in patients with depression.75 In our study, Actinobacteria levels were lower and Proteobacteria levels were higher in dams subjected to PS (relative to animals with no PS) because our study on gut microbiota did not include dams not subjected to CRS, and the results may be a potential effect of PS itself. In addition, in this study, abundances of Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia and Allobaculum showed significant differences among dams that underwent different PS procedures. Erysipelotrichaceae organisms have been found to play an important role in promoting the prevention of diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy.76 Akkermansia plays a beneficial role in glucose metabolism,77,78 and Allobaculum is harmful to glucose and lipid metabolism and promotes the occurrence of diabetes.79 However, the changes in Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia and Allobaculum abundance under different PS processes and how they affect the occurrence of mental illness need further research.\nA complex bidirectional reflex network between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract has been confirmed. Signals from the gastrointestinal tract are transmitted to the brain through the neural network, affecting the emotional state of the brain and its ability to respond to stress. In turn, regulation of the brain can cause changes in gastrointestinal movement, secretion and immune function.80 The relativity analysis in this study indicated that inflammasome disorder and neuroplasticity may play important roles in regulating the relation between stress and gut microbiota composition. Recent studies of Akkermansia have shown obvious beneficial effects in terms of resisting intestinal inflammation and repairing damage to intestinal barriers.81,82 The heat map of microbial distribution in our study clearly showed that Akkermansia dominated in the cecal microbiota of mice subjected to brief PS, which provides the possibility of resistance to inflammatory activation. The abundance of Alistipes has also been found to be significantly increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.83 In our experiment, Alistipes abundance in dams subjected to long PS was significantly increased, which further suggests the role of the microbiota in intestinal inflammation. Recently, some animal\nE168 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2023;48(3)\nstudies have found that this 2-way communication along the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis can be mediated by the immune system in pups subjected to maternal separation.84\u201386 In addition, the tight connection between the NLRP3 pathway and the gut microbiota has been demonstrated, and using anti-inflammatory drugs can change the variety and abundance of beneficial bacteria to prevent and treat depression.87,88\nHowever, it was surprising that the dams subjected to long PS (PS180 group) did not differ from the controls in any meas urement other than microbiota composition. Previous studies have shown that changes in the intestinal microbiota are closely related to activation of the intestinal immune system caused by changes in multiorgan metabolic inflammation.89 In this study, the composition of intestinal microbiota in dams that underwent long PS (in contrast to those that did not undergo PS) changed after re-exposure to stress, which suggested that the degree of activation of the intestinal immune system may have differed between dams that underwent long PS and those that did not undergo PS. In this study, the measurement of immune indices mainly focused on the hippocampal tissue of the brain, and an analysis of the activation of hippocampal immunity showed no difference between the dams that underwent long PS and those that did not undergo PS. This finding indicates the likelihood that other mechanisms occurring in the brain prevented overactivation of brain immunity; the underlying mechanisms should be studied in the future."

            "text": "This study showed that CRS induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in dams that remained with their pups during lactation. More specifically, CRS activated hippocampal microglia, increased the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, and damaged hippocampal neuroplasticity in dams. However, brief PS reversed the CRS-induced anxietyand depression-like behaviours in dams, which indicates resilience. Activation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity impairment in the hippocampus were inhibited in dams subjected to brief PS and CRS. In addition, taxonomic shifts in the cecal microbiota were observed in dams subjected to long PS and CRS. Interestingly, we observed relations between gut microbiota composition and some biomarkers of hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity in dams exposed to different PS protocols. Our study provides further evidence for the beneficial effect of brief PS and the potential microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis mechanism. Intestinal microbiologic intervention in mothers experiencing long PS may be a new strategy for preventing postpartum depression.\nAffiliations: From the Department of Psychiatry, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China (Zhou, Wu, G.
