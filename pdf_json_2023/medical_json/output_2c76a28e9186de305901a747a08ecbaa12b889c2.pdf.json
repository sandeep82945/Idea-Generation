    "abstractText": "As a lifelong condition, intellectual disability (ID) remains a public health priority. Parents caring for children with ID experience serious challenges to their wellbeing, including depression, anxiety, stress and health-related quality of life. Integrated parenting interventions, which have been well evidenced for depressed mothers, may also effectively support depressed parents with a child with ID in low-resource settings such as Pakistan, and in turn optimise child outcomes. We conducted a mixed-method rater-blind feasibility randomised controlled trial, which assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the Learning Through Play in My Own Way Plus (LTP-IMOW Plus) intervention. Mothers who screened positive for depression (n = 26) with a young child (age 3\u20136 years) with ID were recruited from two low-resource community settings. Participants in the intervention arm (n = 13) received 12 group sessions of LTP-IMOW Plus and others (n = 13) received routine care. The intervention was feasible and acceptable with 100% retention and 100% session attendance. The intervention improved depression, anxiety, parenting stress and child socialisation score outcomes relative to the routine care arm. The framework utilised to analyse the qualitative interviews with seven participants at pre-intervention identified a range of struggles experienced by the mothers, and at post-intervention, found improved knowledge of child development and practices, improved mother\u2013child relationships, recommendations for the intervention and perceived practical barriers and facilitators. The findings highlight the prospects for a clinical and cost-effective trial of an integrated parenting intervention to manage long-term parental mental health needs and improve child outcomes.",

            "text": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a generalised neurodevelopmental disorder that places a heavy burden of disease on low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and has become a public health priority due to its nature of being a lifelong condition and its impact on families [1]. The global prevalence of ID is 3.2%; however, South Asia has the highest prevalence at 6.0% [2]. The incidence of ID in Pakistan is 1.1 per 100 live births [3]. Prevalence is particularly high in peri-urban slum areas due to poverty, malnutrition, birth trauma and\nChildren 2023, 10, 913. https://doi.org/10.3390/children10060913 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/children\nconsanguinity, which impact prenatal neurodevelopment [3]. The most common causes of ID, such as Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome, typically occur before birth [4]. The economic cost (family expenditure related to care and government expenditure on services provided for people with ID and their families) associated with ID is particularly high in severe ID [5], and this is a particular concern in LMICs where the financial impact falls on families [6]. In addition to the economic burden, families also experience social exclusion due to widespread stigma and cultural prejudices, such as perceptions of disability as pitiable and tragic [7]. Caring for a child with ID can be enormously challenging for family members, and mothers usually shoulder the most responsibility, which may explain their poorer wellbeing relative to fathers [8\u201310]. Parents of children with ID have high levels of depression and anxiety, sleep deprivation, poor quality of life, social isolation and stress [11\u201316]. In Pakistan, 70% of the parents of children with ID have anxiety and/or depression [17,18]. This may explain why children with ID tend to experience more unsupportive, negative parenting behaviours than typically developing children [19,20]. Comorbid child behaviour difficulties are associated with both parenting stress [12] and negative parenting behaviours [21]. Children with ID have also been found to experience less affectionate behaviours and fewer positive teaching behaviours from their mothers, such as joint attention and language [22]. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of fourteen studies suggested that positive parenting behaviours, such as praise/reward-giving and engagement/responsiveness were related to positive outcomes, such as social or adaptive behaviour, in young children with developmental disabilities [23]. In low-resource settings, the lack of specialised services further exacerbates the parenting stress as there are very few government-supported specialised education centres for children with ID in LMICs, and expensive privately-run centres are usually the only option [24]. Caregivers typically resort to informal care; however, home-based provision of care and education to children with ID is associated with depression and anxiety among their parents [25]. In Pakistan, available treatment or support for these parents follows an informal model of care as professional assistance is often scarce or unaffordable. Community-based treatment options (through lady health workers (LHWs), family-focused programmes, etc.) or informal sources of support are more readily available compared to formal support systems [17,26]. Parenting programmes are needed to improve the parenting skills, wellbeing and mental health among parents of children with ID [27,28]. In the early years, responsive parental behaviours\u2014especially in mothers\u2014are associated with enhanced cognitive and linguistic outcomes for children with ID [29]. More recent evidence in ID research has also highlighted the value of quality time in developing a close parent\u2013child bond in the families of ID children [30]. Moreover, there is a growing evidence base for the salutary impact on parents who adopt meaning-focused coping strategies when dealing with their children who have ID [31]. In a systematic review, Beighton and Wills (2019) underpinned the experience of mothers in LMICs with having attained a wider perspective on life and their children living with the condition being a source of their contentment [31]. A similar finding was previously reported in Pakistani mothers despite the prevalence of cultural stigma and lack of social support [32]. Integrated parenting interventions with a focus on both parental mental health and development in typically developing children have shown a positive impact on a range of outcomes in low-resource contexts such as Pakistan [33\u201335]. To our knowledge, only one trial based in Pakistan has focused on the parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders [36]. In a cluster randomised trial, a parent skills training module on developmental disorder was delivered to parents in a rural community in nine sessions by a family volunteer using a tablet-based Android application by adapting the World Health Organisation guidelines [36]. No difference was observed in child functioning, nor in parent\u2013child joint engagement and the socioemotional wellbeing of children, but mothers\u2019 health-related quality of life improved. Possible reasons for the former lack of\neffects include the heterogeneity of the developmental conditions, age range across the sample and the relatively brief duration of the intervention [36]. Learning Through Play in My Own Way (LTP-IMOW) is a parenting programme developed and tested for children with special needs and is based on learning through play (LTP) for typically developing children [37]. The LTP-IMOW component was integrated with existing culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enhance maternal mental wellbeing [33\u201335]. The aims of this mixed-method study were: (1) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of group LTP-IMOW Plus CBT intervention in Karachi, Pakistan, and to test whether, relative to routine care, the scores on a range of outcomes (maternal health and parenting, child outcomes) moved in the direction of positive outcomes for the mother and child and (2) to explore the lived experiences of mothers having a child with ID and their experiences of participating in the intervention programme."

The quantitative aspect of the study adopted the rater-blind randomised controlled feasibility trial and the qualitative aspect followed descriptive qualitative design. The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov and the trial registration number is NCT03683706. The study was conducted in two low-resource community settings (Gadap Town; Orangi Town) in Karachi, Pakistan. These settings were chosen after consultation with stakeholders who were closely involved in LTP Plus studies in Karachi. This informed the decision to assess the feasibility of intervention in the settings with established community networks. Gadap Town has 8 Union Councils (UCs) and 400 villages, with around 15,000 births per year. Orangi town, the largest slum in Asia, has 13 UCs, and approximately 1.5 million people out of 15 million living in kachi abadi (unauthorised settlements on government land) in Pakistan [38]. Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Professional Psychology Bahria University Karachi (IPP/BU/OM/103/790) on 24 May 2016."

In this study, LHWs served the role of community mobilisers. These LHWs are part of the Lady Health Worker Programme that aims to promote health by bridging the gap between health services and community. Although these workers are attached to a health facility, they mainly work from home and are community-based, and have been referred by community leaders, identified potentially eligible mothers (during their routine visits to the community) for the study, and obtained consent to be contacted by the study team. Trained community health workers (CHWs) approached these women at their homes. Mothers were screened by CHWs using the study eligibility checklist. To be eligible, mothers were required to have at least one child with ID (including Down syndrome) aged 3 to 6 years living with her, as diagnosed by a health professional; a depression score \u2265 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) [39]; and the ability to participate in assessments and group intervention sessions, which could involve giving verbal responses to self-report measures. Mothers diagnosed with a severe physical or mental illness that would prevent study participation or with active suicidal ideation were excluded. CHWs provided eligible mothers with an information leaflet and CHWs described the study in detail. This participant information leaflet included contact details of free mental health helplines for participants. Following informed consent (thumb impression for those who were unable to read/write), baseline assessment was arranged with trained researchers at participants\u2019 homes. Participants were assigned a study identification number by the project manager and were randomised into either the intervention arm (n = 13) (LTP Plus in\nMy Own Way Plus CBT; \u2018LTP-IMOW Plus\u2019) or routine care arm (n = 13). Randomisation was carried out by an off-site statistician using a web software (http://www.randomisation.com, accessed on 19 July 2019). Within one week of randomisation, CHWs called participants and informed them of their randomisation status and scheduled a group session with participants in the intervention arm. Outcome assessments at the end of intervention (3-month post-randomisation) were completed by researchers blind to group allocation, and study participants were requested not to share their group status with the outcome assessors. The final sample size for this study (n = 26) was considered appropriate for a feasibility trial [40,41]."

            "text": "This is an integrated culturally adapted group parenting intervention comprising two components that run throughout the programme: a psychoeducational parenting intervention (LTP-IMOW) and CBT. LTP-IMOW extends on the \u2018Learning Through Play\u2019 parent education programme developed by Toronto Public Health (1993) which was later revised by the Hincks-Dellcrest Centre (2000) [37]. LTP aims for the healthy growth and development of young children (birth to 6 years) using the stages and elements of development defined by Evans and Ilfeld (1982), incorporating Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development [42] and Bowlby\u2019s theory of attachment [43]. The objective of LTP is to strengthen parent\u2013child attachment by encouraging parental involvement and by teaching parents how to use play activities to enhance their child\u2019s development using the LTP calendar. The \u2018Learning Through Play in My Own Way\u2019 (LTP-IMOW) calendar enables the quick identification of areas and gaps in learning where detailed input by parents is required. This programme empowers parents with the knowledge that their child can be \u201cdifferent but equal\u201d. It also enables the parents to become proactive partners in the planning and execution of the child\u2019s developmental activities. Attractive pictures make the calendar user-friendly even for parents with low literacy. The LTP-IMOW calendar is different from the standard LTP calendar as the psychoeducational content was extended from five areas of child development (sense of self, physical development, relationships, understanding the world and communication) to seven areas, with physical development further divided into small muscles and large muscles and communication divided into understanding messages and expressing messages. The CBT component focuses on psychoeducation with regard to maternal depression, the role of negative thinking patterns in the development and maintenance of depression, the impact of depression on child development, mothers\u2019 daily functioning and their interpersonal relationships. In every session, there is a section on the basic principles of CBT to help mothers learn how to break the cycle of negative thoughts and to feel better [33\u201335]. An LTP-IMOW Plus intervention manual was developed by translating the LTPIMOW manual into Urdu and integrating it with an existing culturally adapted CBT component for mothers of young children with probable depression [33\u201335]. In the LTPIMOW calendar, culturally adapted illustrations were used to retain the cultural relevance of the intervention (such as pictures of parents and children with Asian physical appearance, clothing, environment/background picture, etc.). Both components of the intervention were delivered simultaneously, each session starting with content from the LTP-IMOW followed by the CBT component. The group intervention was delivered by an LTP-IMOW Plus master trainer (masters level psychologist trained in LTP Plus with experience of delivering interventions in community settings in Pakistan) at the Basic Health Unit (BHU), in 12 weekly sessions over a three-month period. There were up to 7 mothers in each intervention group. Each session lasted between 60\u201390 minutes. Mothers were provided with a pictorial calendar, which they were advised to bring with them to each session."

All 13 mothers in the intervention arm were approached to participate in a one-to-one qualitative interview at pre- and post-intervention stage; 7 mothers consented to participate. Two topic guides were developed based on the literature review and discussion with a multidisciplinary group of professionals which included mental health professionals, representatives from special education, and experts working in institutes offering services to children with special needs. The first draft of the topic guide was pilot tested with 1 participant in order to make sure that questions were understandable to the target population. The pre-intervention topic guide covered a range of areas: mothers\u2019 knowledge and understanding of mental health problems (e.g., What are your views about mental health of parents caring for children with ID? What are factors contributing to maternal depression? etc.), the broad impacts of depression on children and family, the impact of having a baby with ID on a mother\u2019s life, the knowledge of raising a child with ID and cultural beliefs and practices around ID. The post-intervention topic guide focused on exploring the perceived impact of LTP-IMOW Plus intervention, including mothers\u2019 feedback on specific aspects of the intervention perceived as helpful (e.g., How did you find this training? What was helpful? What was not very helpful?), perceived changes in physical and mental health of mother and child, improvement in thinking style and problem-solving skills, any barriers and challenges experienced by the participants and suggestions for improving the intervention.

(1) Transcription: Audio interviews were transcribed by trained researchers who were masters-level psychologists and was cross-checked against recordings by the qualitative researcher who conducted the interviews. (2) Familiarisation: During the familiarisation phase, the qualitative researchers actively read and re-read the transcripts to immerse themselves fully in the data. (3) Coding: Using an inductive coding approach, open coding was performed to generate as many codes as possible. Coding was performed using the Urdu transcripts by two qualitative researchers (TK, SH). A total of three transcripts from each dataset were coded by both researchers independently and then transcripts were divided between both researchers. (4) Development and application of analytical framework: To continue coding of the rest of the transcripts, a meeting was held with a qualitative research group composed of 5 senior qualitative researchers to agree on a set of codes to be applied to all subsequent transcripts. Codes were grouped together into categories (themes) and a working analytical framework. It was agreed that both researchers would apply the working analytical framework on the remaining transcripts and continue adding new codes under categories if needed. Both researchers had fortnightly meetings to discuss the codes from each transcript. Relevant codes were then translated into English for the purpose of analysis. To ensure the accuracy of translation, all were back-translated verbatim into Urdu by a bilingual researcher. (5) Charting: An MS Excel spreadsheet was used to organise the codes and categories using a matrix. The matrix included references to the illustrative verbatim from the dataset. This helped to visualise the data as a whole. (6) Interpretation of the data: Interpretation was informed by the study objectives and by the concepts generated inductively from the data. Rather than focusing\non descriptions of individual cases, themes were developed to offer explanations for what was happening within the dataset. To ensure the robustness of the qualitative findings, transcripts and themes were discussed in qualitative supervision meetings. Three transcripts from each of the two datasets (pre- and post-intervention) were independently analysed by two qualitative researchers and rest of the transcripts were coded by dividing transcripts between the qualitative researchers."

Of these, 26 (74.3%) mothers met the eligibility criteria and gave informed consent (Figure 1). None of them withdrew their consent; only one participant from the routine care arm had to leave the study as she relocated to another city, resulting in a retention rate of 96%. Participants were able to respond to all questionnaire assessments as evident from the completeness of data. Researcher logs suggested no issues with responding to the multiple choice measures.\n3.2.2. Acceptability of the Intervention\nThe attendance rate of the group intervention was 100%. All mothers attended all 12 intervention sessions. Travel facilities were provided to all mothers which facilitated them to attend all sessions. Moreover, there were no adverse events related to the intervention.\n3.3. Qualitative Analysis 3.3.1. Pre-Intervention Themes\nIn the pre-intervention interviews, six main themes were identified from the framework analysis (Table 1). The first theme focused on the mothers\u2019 overwhelming sense of stress, burden, and impact on their mental health. Mothers reported a range of expressions for their depression, including the loss of pleasure, becoming upset, a deep feeling of hopelessness, crying, restlessness and sleep disturbance. Manifestation sometimes emerged through physical symptoms, such as headaches. The workload and burden described by most mothers led to irritability and anger, which were displaced on others, including their children with ID. Some experienced suicidal ideation and one described an attempt of self-harm due to the extreme distress they felt related to child disability and family conflicts. Some mothers also reported feeling upset and angered because of comments about the child\u2019s apparent developmental delays made by wider family members and local neighbours who may have shown apparent concern that was perceived negatively by the mothers.\nThe second theme focuses on the mother\u2019s concerns when she first observes an absence of communicative or other behavioural milestones that she expected would occur by a certain age. Some mothers initially observed that their child was not babbling and talking unlike other same-age children, did not ask for food, or was otherwise behaving differently. They reported motor delays, difficulty in verbal cues and understanding language, and differences in facial expressions. These social challenges or delays led to a sense of rejection for mothers, or a lack of rewarding experience. One mother expressed that \u201cthere is no\nbond between us because he does not understand my love and affection, he did not respond back to me when I try to express my love for him\u201d (INT: 004). Thirdly, increased childcare responsibilities were discussed. After the birth of the child, mothers reported that their responsibilities increased drastically. There is a strongly felt expectation that the complete responsibility of taking care of the child falls upon the mother. The mothers felt that they do not receive support from the wider family who needed help in supporting the child. On the contrary, mothers felt that they had to take care of other family members too. Most mothers reported being preoccupied with and constantly worrying about the child\u2019s needs, which restricted all outdoor activities and was excessively draining. Fourthly, some mothers relayed cultural beliefs in attempting to explain their child\u2019s intellectual disability, specifically in relation to the role of the evil eye\u2014a curse that can cause bad fate, ill health, or accident\u2014that is documented in a range of cultures. This was discussed in the context of malevolent forces in the environment, perhaps linked to the negative feelings or intention of others outside of the family. These mothers reported taking precautionary actions on the basis of this belief (Table 1). Finally, financial issues were raised by most of the participants as a barrier in accessing health care services and receiving treatment for their child\u2019s intellectual disability. Some mothers reported that when they managed to visit a doctor for the first consultation, they were unable to manage follow-up visits because the treatment was too expensive for them.\n3.3.2. Post-Intervention Themes\nIn the post-intervention interviews, three main themes were identified with subthemes (Table 1). The first theme focused on the perceived impact of intervention. Mothers endorsed benefits in different areas of their lives after participating in LTP-IMOW Plus group sessions. Most mothers discussed how they had come to a different understanding about their child\u2019s behaviour and difficulties and that this had altered how they were now \u2018taking care\u2019 of their child by utilising more responsive, positive and accepting parenting approaches. Mothers tended to describe why they changed their parenting behaviour in relation to the knowledge they had gained about child developmental limitations and delays. Participants also spoke in ways that suggested a new focus of empathy for their child\u2019s mental states, demonstrated by how they had started spending more time with their child, talking and playing. This contrasts with pre-intervention interviews when the focus was on the mother\u2019s own mental states. Through expressing a newfound or refreshed awareness of the affected child\u2019s needs for relationships, a healthy diet, language interaction, etc., most mothers implicitly recognised their pivotal role in helping to meet those needs. In this context, some mothers described how they were able to observe improvements in their child, for example, in their receptive language. In a second subtheme, all mothers reported improvement in their attachment with the child and expressed a strong awareness of the importance of meeting the child\u2019s emotional needs. Most of the mothers previously assumed that, due to their child\u2019s condition, they could not develop a bond with the child as the child was not able to understand feelings. Now, as they started to pay more attention to their child, they have observed that the child can express feelings of joy and, by responding to this joy, the mother feels more connected to the child. Therefore, a positive feedback loop is described in which parenting has become a more positive experience for mothers. All mothers also acknowledged that they learned how the child feels more secure when parents provide them with appropriate attention and responsiveness, and some mothers described perceptible effective changes in the child, with reduced distress and more positivity. In a third subtheme, most mothers expressed a noticeable improvement in their own sense of mental wellbeing. A heightened sense of self-efficacy was described as they learned to identify their unhealthy negative thoughts and the ability to change these thoughts. Some\nparticipants also mentioned that they learned problem-solving skills and the significance of self-care, and how these directly and indirectly impacted on their family relationships. The second theme focused on suggestions made by the participants for further refinement in the intervention. Most participants suggested that this training should be delivered to their partners as well so that together they can bring positive change in their child through improved parenting styles. They also suggested increasing the timing of the sessions to be able to discuss their concerns in more detail. Thirdly, mothers discussed barriers and facilitators they experienced in attending the group sessions. Barriers centred around time constraints due to the burden of household activities and childcare responsibilities. However, all mothers successfully managed the perceived barriers and attended training sessions. One facilitator mentioned: support from their family members helped them participate in the group sessions, such as scheduling a group session."

However, t-tests can provide indications of the intervention\u2019s potential effectiveness. First, the degree of outcome variable overlap was checked. Based on correlations between all outcome variables, all PSI subscales were highly correlated with the total score (baseline: r = 0.64 to 0.86; all p < 0.01; follow-up: r = 0.93 to 0.98; all p < 0.01), so only the PSI total is reported. VABS domains varied in how much they were inter-correlated (baseline: r = 0.33; p > 0.05 to r = 0.74; p < 0.001; follow-up: r = 0.42; p > 0.05 to r = 0.81; p < 0.001); see Appendix A), and given that they are typically reported separately as distinct developmental areas, each VABS domain was reported. Overall, there were few correlations between the nine outcome variables at baseline, and many more at follow-up (see Appendix A). The adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons given the exploratory nature of the study.\n3.4.1. Maternal and Parenting Outcomes\nMaternal depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scores did not differ significantly between groups at baseline, but were significantly lower in the intervention arm at followup (Table 2).

Child Outcomes\nVABS socialisation did not differ between groups at baseline, but there was a highly significant increase in the intervention arm relative to routine care (Table 1). Communication, daily living, socialisation and motor skills increased for the intervention arm from baseline to follow-up assessment. p-values indicate that differences between two groups lack statistical significance (except for the socialisation subscale) (Table 2). No significant differences were found by intervention arm at baseline or follow-up in VABS communication, VABS daily living or VABS motor skill. Child communication skills were substantially lower in the routine care group than the intervention arm, while daily living scores changed slightly for both groups."

            "text": "This mixed-method study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted group parenting intervention for mothers who had screened positive for depression and whose children were diagnosed with ID in Pakistan: LTP-IMOW Plus. The study demonstrates excellent recruitment, uptake and retention of mothers who screened positive for depression. Unlike high-income settings where formal support for families is available, in low-resource settings such as Pakistan, parents receive minimal support from formal sources due to the limited availability of trained support staff and poor organisational structures [17]. A lack of support infrastructure may explain the excellent recruitment and retention rates in this study. Qualitative findings highlight that mothers who participated managed to attend group sessions, despite barriers related to work overload and time constraints. Moreover, facilitation in terms of travel-related arrangements for participants may have contributed to engagement with the intervention as evidenced from previous qualitative work with South Asian populations [54]. Qualitative interviews captured the burden felt and severe mental health impacts associated with parenting a child with ID, and a shift in both the parenting experience\nand their relationship with their child after participating in the intervention programme. Thus, both strands of data support the potential benefits of the integrated LTP-IMOW Plus intervention in improving parental depression, anxiety, stress and a health-related quality of life, and child outcomes. The quantitative findings on group differences should be interpreted cautiously as the study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing. However, the findings are promising and informative for designing the next comprehensive RCT, e.g., when analysing the requested sample size for the RCT trial. Future investigation should determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of LTP-IMOW Plus, and may also investigate the engagement of depressed fathers of children with ID. While early interventions for vulnerable children can bring improvements to familial wellbeing and children\u2019s development [55], the key challenges to LMIC settings are their availability and accessibility to families who stand to benefit the most [27]. Pre-intervention themes in this study highlight financial difficulties as barriers in accessing services and treatment in Pakistan. Psychoeducational support is essential to equip families with the knowledge to care, train and support their children with ID and enable them to learn self-care strategies [56]. Consistent with other low-resource environments, families\u2019 cultural beliefs may impact how they raise children with ID [56,57], as highlighted through our qualitative finding that (some) participants associated ID with supernatural causes and beliefs. The quantitative and qualitative findings regarding the intervention\u2019s potential effectiveness on parent, parenting and child outcomes are preliminary, yet are consistent with previous studies using a similar LTP intervention with depressed parents of typically developing young children in Pakistan [33\u201335,58]. Parenting interventions delivered to mothers of children with ID in high- and low-income settings indicated that positive parenting had a significant effect on improving somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, social dysfunction, and the overall mental health of mothers [27,28,59,60]. Findings on the potential benefits for health-related quality of life are particularly important as parents of children with ID experience lower quality of life due to behavioural problems in children, leading to increased psychological distress [61]. Existing evidence has established the need for research on the role of a culturally sensitive parenting programme and potentially efficient group-based parent education programmes for the families of children with intellectual disabilities [25]. The apparent changes in mothers\u2019 knowledge and attitude towards child development and parenting described in the mothers\u2019 interviews, combined with indicative findings in child outcomes, can only be confirmed in a full trial, as has been evidenced in other LTP Plus trial works in typically developing young children in Pakistan [35]. This study offers several strengths: it used a mixed-method design to triangulate findings, a feasibility study for assessing the practicalities of randomising this particular population in a trial, and key indications of effectiveness in maternal and child outcomes were evaluated. Several limitations must also be acknowledged. As participants were recruited through community networks, results may differ if recruiting from settings such as healthcare facilities, education, or rehabilitation settings. Eligibility was based on having a child with a confirmed diagnosis of ID by a health professional; no information was collated on the level of intellectual disability or the presence of comorbid diagnosis. Mothers were screened for depression using a validated screening instrument (PHQ-9); no diagnostic instrument confirmed a diagnosis of a major depressive episode. Acceptability, based on attendance, would be improved by assessing the level of engagement. The test of feasibility was based on intervention and outcome assessment completion without any issues; a formal checklist determined a priori would have provided more nuanced information for informing areas for modification or refinement. Although outcome measures were compared between the two groups (intervention vs. routine care), mean differences should be interpreted cautiously; this feasibility study was not powered to formally test for effectiveness. Furthermore, routine care did not involve any formalised contact with\nservices, so group differences could be due to the intervention itself or more generally from group support. The long-term engagement of the mothers of children with ID in a trial is not known from this study as the follow-up assessment was at 3 months postrandomisation. The routine care group was not interviewed about their lived experiences of caring for a child with ID or of being part of usual care, both of which may have been informative for taking the intervention work forward."

This culturally adapted, manualassisted, integrated parenting intervention was well-tolerated by mothers with probable depression of young children with ID. Establishing the feasibility and acceptability of potentially low-cost, easy-to-deliver parenting interventions is important in laying the foundation for larger clinical and cost-effective trials in LMICs, where awareness and resources regarding mental health in general and ID in particular are limited. Moreover, the findings of this study highlights the opportunities to develop feasible, acceptable, potentially cost-effective, and community-level interventions, which can be up-scaled and integrated into existing healthcare systems.
