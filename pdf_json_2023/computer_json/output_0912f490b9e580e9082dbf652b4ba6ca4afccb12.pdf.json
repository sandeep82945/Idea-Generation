Introduction\nMultipath interference affects the radar detection of low altitude targets over the sea. In multipaths, the directly arriving target echo and the sea surface-reflected target echo overlap with each other. The resulting combined multipath returns combine either constructively or destructively with the direct-path signal, which produces a stronger or weaker total received signal at random. In most cases, multipath attenuates the radar received signal intensity. It is disadvantageous to radar detection [1\u20135]. Therefore, overcoming the negative effect of multipath is a key issue for radar detection of low altitude targets over the sea. Multipath scattering from a rough surface involves two components: specular reflection and diffuse reflection. In most cases, specular reflection dominates multipath scattering, so many scholars only consider specular reflection for multipath scattering [6,7]. In the specular reflection case, the radar detection performance can be improved if prior knowledge of the radar-target environment is known [8]. However, the target position usually varies with time, and such prior knowledge is difficult to obtain. Without prior knowledge, radar systems often employ frequency diversity to overcome multipath interference [9\u201311]. For example, [10] developed adaptive orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals for moving target detection in multipaths. In [11], an order statistics-based detection method was proposed to improve the radar target detection performance in multipaths based on frequency diversity. In fact, multipath returns have different propagation ways. This implies that the amplitude or the phase of the multipath returns are different at some fixed location in the space. Thus, spatial diversity can be used to overcome the negative effect the multipath [12,13]. For example, MIMO radar is proposed to detect the target in the presence of multipath [14]. However, MIMO radar is difficult to be implemented in reality. In addition, array antennas and multiple subapertures (which are collectively referred to as multiple antennas) are widely used for radar tracking in multipaths [15\u201318]. Since multiple antennas can be used for radar tracking in this way, it is likely that they can also be used for radar detection in multipaths. However, to our knowledge, there has been\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3204. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15123204 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3204 2 of 11\nlittle previous work on radar detection in multipaths using multiple antennas. Whether radar detection performance in multipaths can be enhanced by using multiple antennas is an interesting question. There are some problems that need to be addressed when using multiple antennas for radar detection in multipaths:\n(1) How many antennas should be used in the system? (2) Where should the antenna heights be set? (3) What test statistic should be used?\nIn this paper, we propose using a single transmitting antenna and three receiving antennas to improve radar detection performance in the presence of specular reflection. The maximum absolute value of the difference in the radar-received signal power among the three antennas is used as the test statistic. The advantages of using three receiving antennas are demonstrated, and the requirements for setting the radar antenna heights are discussed. Mathematical expressions for the radar detection probability and the false alarm probability are derived. Simulation results are given to validate the proposed method. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Radar target echoes in the presence of specular reflection are analyzed in Section 2. In Section 3, the selection of the number of antennas and the antenna heights are discussed. Mathematical derivations of the radar detection probability and the false alarm probability are presented in Section 4. The simulation results that demonstrate the validity of the proposed method are given in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Radar Target Echo in the Presence of Specular Reflection\nAssuming that radar transmits and receives signals using the same single antenna, a schematic diagram of the radar specular reflection is shown in Figure 1. In the presence of specular reflection, four different paths contribute to the radar-received target echoes: directdirect (ABA), direct-reflected (ABOA), reflected-direct (AOBA) and reflected-reflected (AOBOA) paths [19]. Then, the received target echoes can be expressed by\nst = A exp(j\u03d5) [ 1 + \u221a Gr(\u03b8r) Gr(\u03b8d)\n\u03c1s exp(j\u03c6)+\u221a Gt(\u03b8r) Gt(\u03b8d) \u03c1s exp(j\u03c6) + \u221a Gt(\u03b8r)Gr(\u03b8r) Gt(\u03b8d)Gr(\u03b8d) \u03c12s exp(j2\u03c6) ] , (1)\nwhere A and \u03d5 are the amplitude and phase of the directly arriving target echo, respectively; Gt(\u03b8) and Gr(\u03b8) are the radar transmitting and receiving antenna gains at an angle \u03b8, respectively; \u03b8d and \u03b8r are the elevation angles of the direct and reflected paths, respectively; \u03c1s is the amplitude of the specular reflection coefficient; \u03c6 = \u03c6l + \u03c6\u03c1, where \u03c6\u03c1 is the phase of the specular reflection coefficient, which is a constant; \u03c6l = 2\u03c0\u03bb (lr + lt \u2212 R), where \u03bb is the wavelength; and R, lr, and lt are the lengths of paths AB, AO, and BO, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. Clearly, \u03c6 and \u03c6l are both sensitive to the radar height hr and to the target height ht. Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3204 3 of 11\nIn the case when the radar operates at low grazing angles, \u03b8r \u2248 \u03b8d, Gt(\u03b8r) \u2248 Gt(\u03b8d), and Gr(\u03b8r) \u2248 Gr(\u03b8d). Thus, Equation (1) can be simplified to\nst = A exp(j\u03d5)[1 + \u03c1s exp(j\u03c6)] 2, (2)\nFrom (2), it can be seen that the target echo power varies as the \u03c6 varies. The \u03c6 varies with changes in the radar antenna height, target height and target distance. Therefore, the target echo power varies with changes in the radar antenna height and the target location. To demonstrate this conclusion indirectly, Figure 2 presents \u03c6l under various radar antenna heights and target locations, where the radar wavelength is 0.03 m.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12\nO\nR radar\ntarget d r A\nB rh\nth\nrl\ntl\nFigure 1.

To demonstrate this conclusion i dir ctly, Figure 2 pr sen s l under various ra-\ndar antenna heights and target locations, where the radar wavelength is 0.03 m.\nIn Figure 2, \u03c6l varies with changes in the radar antenna height, target height and target distance. Therefore, \u03c6 also varies with the radar antenna height, target height and target distance, which induces the target echo power to vary in the same manner. Thus, we can conclude that the target echo powers that are received by antennas at different heights are also likely different. However, the clutter mean powers that are received by the antennas at the different heights are almost identical if the height difference between antennas is within several meters. Because the ground surface or sea surface represents an area target, the clutter mean power is mainly related to the distance between the radar antenna and the reflected surface. The height differences between the multiple antennas are much smaller than the distance between the radar and the reflected surface, which will not induce the clutter mean power difference in antennas. Overall, the target echo powers received by\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3204 4 of 11\neach of the multiple antennas may be different, whereas the clutter mean powers received by the same multiple antennas are almost identical. Thus, we can use multipath antennas at different heights and use the differences in the signal powers received by the multiple antennas as test statistics to decide whether a target exists or not. In the following section, we first discuss how to select the antenna number and their heights.\n3. Selection of Antenna Numbers and Heights\nAssuming that the radar uses a single transmitting antenna and multiple receiving antennas and that these antennas are set at different heights. To better detect the target, the differences among the target echo powers received by the multiple antennas needs to be obvious at all times. However, the target location is unknown beforehand, and this location changes with time, which may cause the differences among the target echo powers received by the multiple antennas to be obvious when the target is at certain locations and small when the target is at other locations. Therefore, selection of the number of antennas and their heights is vital to ensure that there is at least a difference among the target echo powers received by the multiple antennas, which is always obvious for any target location.\n3.1. Selection of Antenna Number\nAssuming that the radar uses a single transmitting antenna and two receiving antennas. Antenna one both transmits and receives signals, while antenna two only receives signals. The simulated target echo powers that are received by the two antennas are shown in Figure 3, where \u201cant 1\u201d and \u201cant 2\u201d denote antenna one and antenna two, respectively. In the simulations, the two antenna heights are randomly set at 200 m and 210 m. The radar transmitted power is 50 kW, the radar wavelength is 0.03 m, the maximum antenna gain is 43 dB, the half power beam width is 4\u25e6, and the target height is 50 m. The target maneuver is not considered in this paper. Please refer to [20] for maneuvering target detection. Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12\nFigure 3.

This finding verifies our prediction above and illustrates the value of using the third antenna. Next, we will discuss how to set the heights of the three antennas.\n3.2. Setting of Antenna Heights\nFrom Figure 2, it can be seen that the target echo power is sensitive to the radar antenna height. In addition, Figures 3 and 4 show that the differences among the target echo powers of the multiple antennas are related to the antenna heights. Therefore, setting the antenna height carefully is important to ensure that there is always an apparent difference in the target echo powers of multiple antennas for any target location. In general, there are four antenna height setting requirements:\n(1) The antenna height must be set high enough to ensure that the target is within the radar line of sight region when considering the earth\u2019s curvature. (2) The distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas should be sufficient to maintain a fixed antenna isolation degree. (3) The clutter mean powers received by the three antennas are approximately equal to each other. (4) There is always an apparent difference value for the target echo powers of the multiple antennas for any target location.\nTo meet the first requirement, the minimum radar antenna height can be calculated by referring to the work of [21]. The second and third requirements are also both easily satisfied if the distances between the three antenna heights are moderate. The fourth requirement is the most important and is the most difficult to satisfy. As Figures 2 and 3 indicate, the target echo power varies with changes in the target height and the target distance, regardless of the antenna height. Thus, the maximum target echo power difference for the three antennas varies with changes in target location, and it may be small or apparent as the target location changes. For this reason, there is no optimal height setting available for the three antennas that will satisfy the fourth requirement. Without loss of generality, we set the three antenna heights to 200 m, 206 m and 212 m. A schematic diagram of the configuration of the three antennas is shown in Figure 5. Because the three antennas are\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3204 6 of 11\nidentical, it can be assumed that antenna 1 randomly transmits and receives signals, while antenna 2 and antenna 3 receive signals only. In the next step, the detection probability and the false alarm probability for the radar using the three antennas will be derived.

Simulation Results and Analysis\nIn this section, the detection performance of the radar using a single transmitting antenna and three receiving antennas in the presence of specular reflection is presented by simulation. We compare the detection performance with that of the radar employing a single antenna and that of the radar employing a single transmitting antenna and two receiving antennas. For the radar employing a single transmitting antenna and two receiving antennas, the test statistic is z12, and the radar detection probability is given by\nPd = \u222b \u221e\n\u03b7 f (z12)dz12 = exp \u2212 \u03b7( a2x + a2y ) Ps + Pn + Pc , (10) By letting Ps = 0 in (10), we acquire the false alarm probability for the radar employing\na single transmitting antenna and two receiving antennas as\nPf = exp ( \u2212 \u03b7\nPn + Pc\n) , (11)\nThe detection probability and the false alarm probability for the radar using a single antenna are the same as (10) and (11), respectively. Therefore, in the presence of specular reflection, the detection performance of the radar using a single transmitting antenna and two receiving antennas is the same as that of the single antenna radar. In the simulations, the clutter mean power Pc = 10, the thermal noise mean power Pn = 1, and \u03c1s = 0.9.
