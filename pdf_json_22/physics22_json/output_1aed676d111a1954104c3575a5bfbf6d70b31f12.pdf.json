Our aim is to study the deeper generalisation of the G-braid groups that occur as fundamental groups of such deformation spaces, with particular focus on the generalisation of the full G-braid groups.",

Geometrically, these are flat Ehresmann connections on a bundle whose fibres are moduli spaces of such meromorphic connections.\nThe underlying deformation parameters, the \u2018times\u2019, have recently been given an intrinsic formulation, leading to a generalisation of the moduli of pointed curves (in any genus). This framework is especially useful when considering the generalised deformations, beyond the generic case: recall [42] set up a theory of \u2018generic\u2019 isomonodromic deformations of meromorphic connections on vector bundles over a Riemann surface , where the leading coefficient at each pole has distinct eigenvalues (building on [9]; cf. [6, 44]). This has been extended in two directions: i) replacing vector bundles by principal G-bundles, leading in particular to the appearance of G-braid groups for complex reductive groups G [12], and ii) considering nongeneric admissible deformations, e.g. [15, 16], where the (untwisted/unramified) irregular type of the connection is arbitrary, leading to cabled braid groups [30].\nIn particular the data, the wild character varieties (a.k.a. wild Betti spaces), have been proved to form a local system of Poisson varieties [16]1\nMB \u2212\u2192 B , (1)\nover any space B of admissible deformations. These give a purely topological description of the nonlinear isomonodromy differential equations, via the Riemann\u2013 Hilbert\u2013Birkhoff correspondence.\nOur purpose in this paper is to study the fundamental groups of the base spaces B of such admissible deformations, the groups that will act by algebraic Poisson automorphisms on the wild character varieties (the fibres of (1)) from the parallel transport of the isomonodromy connection\u2014i.e. the monodromy of the nonlinear differential equations. This builds on our previous paper [30], which used a fixed marking: here we will quotient by the Weyl group action and get to the full version of \u2018wild\u2019 mapping class groups, in analogy to forgetting the ordering of marked points on the underlying pointed curve.\nThis encompasses the much-studied case of regular singular connections, involving the complex character varieties, which is the entry point for the standard mapping-class- and braid-group-actions in classical/quantum 2d gauge theories\u2014via deformations of pointed curves, e.g. [4, 31, 43, 45] in the quantum case. The case of poles of order 2, however, has been extensively studied by various authors: there are relations to quantum groups [12, 66, 67], and already there the boundary of the space of times has a rich structure (corresponding to the \u2018coalescence\u2019 of irregular times, cf. [27, 64, 65]). In particular the simplest irregular singular case has been understood in rigorous analytic way, while this paper focuses on the algebro-geometric aspects of the general nongeneric case.\nIn this series of \u2018local\u2019 papers we fix the underlying pointed curve, and vary the rest of the wild Riemann surface structure [16], i.e. the irregular types/classes, controlling principal parts of irregular singular connections beyond their (formal) residues.\n1 Basically speaking, a bundle of Poisson manifolds equipped with a complete flat connection: the (Betti) isomonodromy connection, a.k.a. the wild nonabelian Gau\u03b2\u2013Manin connection.\nMore precisely [30] constructs a fine moduli space of untwisted/unramified irregular types for the split Lie algebra (g, t):= (Lie(G),Lie(T)), where T \u2286 G is a maximal (algebraic) torus, while here we consider irregular classes.\nRecall in brief an untwisted irregular type Q at a point a \u2208 is the germ of a t-valued meromorphic function based there, defined up to holomorphic terms:\nQ = p\u2211\nj=1 Ajz\n\u2212j \u2208 t((z))/t[[z]] , Aj \u2208 t , (2)\nin a local coordinate vanishing at the marked point. Then theWeyl groupWg = N(T)/ T acts on the left tensor factor of\nt \u2297C (C((z))/C[[z]]) t((z))/t[[z]] , and the irregular class underlying (2) is its projection Q in the quotient, i.e. the Weylorbit through Q [16, Rk. 10.6].2\nThe important fact is the fibres of (1) only depend on the collection of irregular classes underlying the irregular types at each marked point, and thus any (admissible) space of irregular classes provides an intrinsic topological description of the corresponding isomonodromy times. In the generic case, where the leading coefficient of (2) is out of all root hyperplanes, the homotopy type of the deformation space brings about the G-braid group: in this paper we shall encounter a generalisation in the nongeneric case, which we relate to braid cabling in type A."

            "text": "In Section 2 we give the main definition: to a one-pointed (bare) wild Riemann surface = ( , a,Q) we associate a full/nonpure local \u2018wild\u2019 mapping class group Q (WMCG), viz. the fundamental group of a space BQ of admissible deformations of the irregular class Q (cf. Definition 2.1). The latter is a topological quotient of the (universal) admissible deformation space BQ of Q, where Q is any irregular type lifting Q.\nIn Section 3 we describe the subgroup of Wg preserving BQ \u2286 tp, and further the quotient thereof that acts freely; the resulting subquotient is denoted Wg,h. The relevant statements are proven inductively along the sequence of fission/Levi (root) subsystems of g associated with Q (cf. [30]): first in the case where Q = Az\u22121 has a single coefficient A \u2208 t (in Section 3.1), and then in the general case (in Section 3.2).\nTheorem (Cf. Theorem 3.1) The space BQ is a Galois covering of BQ with Gal(BQ,BQ) = Wg|h, so Q is an extension of Wg,h by the pure local WMCG.\nIn Section 4 we describe all full/nonpure local WMCGs for the irreducible rank-2 root systems, after explaining the classification boils down to simple Lie algebras.\n2 E.g. if G = GLn(C) we thus consider the coefficients Aj in (3) up to simultaneous permutations of their eigenvalues.\nFinally in Section 5 we explicitly describe the full/nonpure local WMCGs when g \u2208 {gln(C), sln(C)}, in the nonabelian case n 2. This means identifying the \u2018effective\u2019 subquotient of theWeyl group that controls the Galois covering (a Coxetertype group), and then compute the fundamental group of the base (an Artin-type group). The inductive step Q = Az\u22121 is in Section 5.1, where we prove the following statement.\nTheorem (Cf. Proposition 5.1, Corrollary 5.1 and Proposition 5.2) The Weylstabiliser of BQ is a direct product of wreath products of symmetric groups, and the effective quotient Wg,h is a direct product of symmetric groups; then Q is the subgroup of braids whose underlying permutation lies in Wg|h, and it is an extension of the latter by a pure braid group.\nIn the general case instead we introduce a family of trees (T, r) with some decoration, called \u2018ranked\u2019 fission trees, which depend on the choice of the irregular class Q (cf. Definition 5.1, and compare with the unranked fission trees of [30, Section 5]). Their automorphisms control the Coxeter-type groups in the general type-A case:\nTheorem (Cf. Theorem 5.1 and Proposition 5.3) The automorphism group Aut(T, r) of the ranked fission tree is isomorphic to Wg|h.\nFinallywe attach a (full/nonpure) \u2018cabled\u2019 braid groupB(T, r) to any rankedfission tree, in Definition 5.4, with a recursive algorithm (along maximal subtrees): this relies on the operadic composition of the symmetric and braid group operads, extending the pure cabled braid group of [30]\u2014which rests in turn on the pure braid group operad.\nThe main result of Section 5 is that the elements of type-A full/nonpure local WMCGs are precisely such \u2018cabled\u2019 braids, in a proof of the multilevel braiding conjecture that appears e.g. in [53] (extending the proof in [30]).\nTheorem (Cf. Theorem 5.2) There is a group isomorphism Q B(T, r), where (T, r) is the ranked fission tree associated with the irregular class Q.\nAll Lie algebras are defined over C; tensor products are C-bilinear. Some basic notions and conventions, used throughout the body of the paper, are collected in Appendix A, while Appendix B contains the proof of few lemmata. In Appendix C we spell out the relation of wild Riemann surfaces with the much-studied Hamiltonian viewpoint on isomonodromic deformations.\nThe end of remarks/examples is signaled by a ."

(Hereafter we refer to this simply as an \u2018irregular type\u2019, always untwisted/unramified.)\nAs explained in the introduction, the moduli spaces attached to (3) (the de Rham/Betti spaces [10]) only depend on the Weyl-orbit of (3), denoted\nQ \u2208 (t \u2297 T ,a ) /Wg . (4)\nHere the Weyl group acts on the Cartan subalgebra\u2014and trivially on the other tensor factor; the element (4) defines an irregular class, a.k.a. \u2018bare\u2019 irregular type [16, Remark 10.6] (cf. [18, 19] in the twisted case).\nIf Q is a \u2018starting\u2019 irregular type, then we have associated with it the (universal) admissible deformation space BQ in [30]. In brief, this is the (connected) complex manifold BQ =\u220fpi=1 BAi , with\nBAi := \u22c2\nd\u03b1<i\nKer(\u03b1) \u2229 \u22c2\nd\u03b1=i (t \\ Ker(\u03b1)) \u2286 t , (5)\nwhere d\u03b1 = ord(\u03b1 \u25e6 Q) , \u03b1 \u2208 g , (6)\ntaking the pole order at a \u2208 . Then the pure localwildmapping class group of thewildRiemann surface ( , a,Q) is Q := \u03c01(BQ,Q), i.e. the fundamental group of the (pointed) deformation space of Q.\nRemark 2.1 (Terminology) The term \u2018pure\u2019 is reminiscent of pure braid groups, which are fundamental groups of configuration spaces of ordered points. Below we will instead consider the \u2018full/nonpure\u2019 case, which in turn is an analogue of the fundamental group for unordered configurations. The latter configuration space arises by modding out the action of a symmetric group (permuting the points): then in our situation this is generalised by an action of the Weyl group.\nThe picture in the case of simple poles is as follows. SupposeO \u2286 g is a semisimple adjoint G-orbit, so thatO\u2229 t \u2286 O is nonempty: amarking ofO is the choice of a point A \u2208 O\u2229 t. In turnO\u2229 t \u2286 t then coincides with theWg-orbit of the vector A \u2208 t, and the Weyl group acts by forgetting the choice of marking. This is essentially because semisimple orbits correspond bijectively to the quotient t/Wg, cf. [26, Section 2].\nThen the topology of each semisimple orbit is determined by the centraliser of its marked point, i.e. theLevi factor of a parabolic subgroupofG, and this yields a partition of t/Wg. In particular there is a bulk consisting of treg/Wg, i.e. the generic/regular\nsemisimple elements, and its fundamental group is the full/nonpure g-braid group (cf. Appendix A). In the nongeneric case one instead finds more complicated hyperplane arrangements (possibly noncrystallographic [30, 54]), andmore complicated reflection groups; so in turn more complicated fundamental groups.\nFinally we take this one step further, to get to the theory of wild/irregular singularities, consideringmore than semisimple orbits inside g. Rather we consider \u2018very good\u2019 orbits inside the (nonreductive) Lie algebra gp = g[[z]]/zpg[[z]], for an integer p 1 as above, cf. [17, Section 1.5]. Choosing an irregular type means fixing a marking of such orbits, and here we get rid of this choice to get the intrinsic spaces of (local) isomonodromic deformations, whose fundamental group is then the \u2018full/nonpure\u2019 (local) wild mapping class group.\nConcretely, two deformations of Q are equivalent if they lie in the same Wg-orbit inside t \u2297 T ,a, in which case they define the same irregular class. This leads to admissible deformations of the \u2018starting\u2019 irregular class Q, and to the main definition.\nDefinition 2.1 The full/nonpure local wild mapping class group of the (bare) wild Riemann surface = ( , a,Q) is\nQ := \u03c01 ( BQ,Q ) , (7)\nwhere BQ = BQ/\u223c is the topological quotient with respect to the equivalence relation\nQ1 \u223c Q2 if WgQ1 = WgQ2 \u2286 t \u2297 T ,a . (8)\n(Hereafter we will simply refer to (7) as the \u2018WMCG\u2019, always full/nonpure and local.)\nNote Q depends on the root system g \u2286 t\u2228, and the tuple of integers d = (d\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208 g . It is in general larger then its pure counterpart, as some nonclosed paths in BQ may become loops in BQ.\nRemark 2.2 The space BQ itself depends on the irregular type Q, not just on the underlying irregular class. However ifw \u2208 Wg thenBQ is homeomorphic tow(BQ) = Bw(Q), and (7) only depends on Q.

[30, Section 1]). This gives another viewpoint on how the (germs of) meromorphic functions Q\u03b1 = \u03b1 \u25e6 Q determine the space.3\n3 These are exponential factors of local fundamental solutions for the linear differential equations associated with the meromorphic connection with irregular type Q, featuring in the Stokes data of the connection.\nIn turn, the pole orders of the Q\u03b1 are well defined up to local biholomorphisms of which fix the marked point a \u2208 . Hence the integers d\u03b1 only depend on the element Q \u2208 t \u2297 T ,a, and not on the identifications\nO\u0302 ,a C[[z]] , K\u0302 ,a C((z)) , T ,a C((z))/C[[z]] .\nHence the deformation spaces BQ and BQ are independent of a choice of local coordinate vanishing at the marked point.\nNow the Weyl action does not preserve BQ in the nongeneric case, i.e. the case where Ap is not regular, so we first need to describe the subset\nWgQ \u2229 BQ \u2286 WgQ ,\nand further understand theWeyl-stabiliser of the irregular type.

In the general case the irregular type is transformed along the diagonal Weyl action on each coefficient.\nChoose then A \u2208 t, and let h = Zg(A) \u2286 g be the centraliser: it is the (reductive) Levi factor of a parabolic subalgebra of g. The associated deformation space (5) becomes\nBA = Ker( h) \u2229 \u22c2\ng\\ h (t \\ Ker(\u03b1)) \u2286 Ker( h) , (9)\nwhere Ker( h) = {A \u2208 t|\u3008\u03b1|A\u3009 = 0 for \u03b1 \u2208 h} = \u22c2\nh\nKer(\u03b1) \u2286 t .\nFor later use we set U := Ker( h). Now if w \u2208 StabWg(BA) \u2286 Wg then certainly wA \u2208 BA, but the converse is true. To state this let OA \u2286 BA be the orbit of A under the action of StabWg(BA); then: Lemma 3.1 One has StabWg(U) = StabWg(BA), and (WgA) \u2229 BA = OA. Proof The Weyl group permutes the root hyperplanes via\nw (Ker(\u03b1)) = Ker(w\u03b1) , w \u2208 Wg , \u03b1 \u2208 g ,\ni.e. along the permutation of the roots. (Recall we identify W ( g) \u2286 GL(t\u2228) and W ( \u2228g ) \u2286 GL(t), cf. SectionAppendixA.)Hencew(BA) \u2286 BA if and only ifw \u2208 Wg preserves the partition g = h \u222a ( g \\ h), by (9). In turn this is equivalent to w( h) \u2286 h, proving the first statement.\nAnalogously ifwA \u2208 BA thenw preserves the above partition,whence the inclusion (WgA) \u2229 BA \u2286 OA\u2014and the opposite one is tautological.\nThus the restriction of orbits to the deformation space is controlled by the setwise stabiliser of U \u2286 t. Remark 3.1 The extremal cases are A = 0, in which case U = t and StabWg(U) = 1; and A \u2208 treg, in which case U = (0) and StabWg(U) = Wg.\nNow the Weyl group Wh = W ( h) \u2286 Wg of the Levi factor lies in the setwise stabiliser of U, but in general the inclusion is proper. Namely by definition\nKer(\u03b1) = Ker(\u03c3\u03b1 \u2212 1) \u2286 t , \u03b1 \u2208 g ,\nand the subgroup Wh is generated by the reflections along the hyperplanes of the subsystem h \u2286 g: hence automatically any element of Wh acts trivially on U = Ker( h), i.e.\nWh \u2286 (Wg)U \u2286 StabWg(U) . However it is possible to show the first inclusion is an equality, and more precisely that Wh is the (maximal) parabolic subgroup fixing the given semisimple element A \u2208 t. Lemma 3.2 One has Wh = (Wg)U = (Wg)A. Proof In principle (Wg)U \u2286 (Wg)BA \u2286 (Wg)A , since A \u2208 BA \u2286 U , so it is enough to show the inclusion (Wg)A \u2286 Wh, i.e. that any element of Wg fixing A lies in the Weyl group of h.\nTo this end recall the Lie-group-theoretic definition of the Weyl group is\nWh = NH(T)/T \u2286 NG(T)/T = Wg ,\nusing the normalisers NH(T) \u2286 NG(T) of the given maximal torus, where H \u2286 G is the (connected, reductive) subgroup integrating h \u2286 g. Hence an element w \u2208 Wg such that w(A) = A corresponds to an element g \u2208 NG(T)\u2014defined up to the Taction\u2014such that Adg(A) = A: this means\ng \u2208 NG(T) \u2229 H = NH(T) ,\nwhence w \u2208 Wh. Finally we have an identification OA Wg|hA, introducing the quotient group\nWg|h := StabWg(U)/Wh . (10)\nDenote then BA the topological quotient (of BA) of Definition 2.1, in the present case where Q = Az\u22121.\nProposition 3.1 The fundamental group \u03c01(BA,OA) is an extension of (10) by \u03c01(BA, A).\nProof The above discussion yields a homeomorphisms\nBA BA/Wg|h , (11)\nby which we identify OA as an element of BA. Now by construction the Wg|h-action on BA is free: the stabilisers of all points are conjugated, and by Lemma 3.2 the stabiliser of the base point is trivial. Moreover the action is automatically properly discontinuous (Wg|h is finite), and the spaces involved are Hausdorff; hence every point of BA has a neighbourhood O \u2286 BA such that w1(O) \u2229 w2(O) = \u2205 implies w1 = w2 \u2208 Wg|h.\nIt follows that the canonical projection p : BA \u2192 BA is a Galois covering, with automorphisms provided by the monodromy action of Wg|h. The choice of the base point A \u2208 p\u22121(OA) \u2286 BA in the fibre yields an identification p\u22121(OA) Wg|h between the torsor and the group, so there is a (principle) fibre bundle\nWg|h \u21aa\u2192 BA p\u2212\u2192 BA .\nThen the resulting exact sequence of homotopy groups contains the short sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 \u03c01(BA, A) \u03c01(p)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c01(BA,A) \u2212\u2192 Wg|h \u2212\u2192 1 , (12)\nidentifying \u03c00(Wg|h) Wg|h (the connecting map is then the monodromy action at the base point). Example 3.1 For example if A \u2208 treg then Wh is trivial, so Wg|h = Wg. Hence (11) generalises the generic \u2018configuration\u2019 space treg/Wg, and in turn \u03c01(BA,OA) generalises the (full/nonpure) g-braid group. Remark 3.2 (Reduced reflection groups) At first one may think (10) is the reflection group of the \u2018restricted\u2019 hyperplane arrangement\nH = {Ker(\u03b1) \u2229 U = Ker (\u03b1|U) |\u03b1 \u2208 g \\ h} \u2286 P ( U\u2228 ) : (13)\nhowever this is not the case in general. For example if h = A1 \u2286 A2 = g then (10) is trivial (see Section 4), while the reduced arrangement is of type A1\u2014so has aWeyl group of order 2. The point is there are reflections of (13) which do not come as restrictions of elements in StabWg(U) (see Section 5)."

Indeed, recall from [30] the usage of fission (which\nis an in the title of [14, 16]): this associates to any irregular type Q =\u2211pi=1 Aiz\u2212i an increasing sequence of (Levi) root subsystems\nh1 \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 hp+1 := g , (14)\nas follows. We consider the sequence of nested centralisers of the coefficients of Q, starting from the leading one. Hence\nHp = {g \u2208 G|Adg(Ap) = Ap} \u2286 G ,\nwhich is a connected reductive subgroup. Then further\nHp\u22121 = {g \u2208 Hp|Adg(Ap\u22121) = Ap\u22121} \u2286 Hp ,\nwhich coincides with the set of elements of G stabilising both Ap\u22121 and Ap. Thus in general Hi = StabG(Ai, . . . , Ap), for i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}, and at the bottom we find the subgroupH1 \u2286 Gstabilising thewhole ofQ\u2014which appears in the quasi-Hamiltonian quotients of [16]. By construction T \u2286 H1, and the inclusion may be proper. On the opposite end, let us set Hp+1 := G for the sake of uniform notation. Remark 3.3 (Fission = breaking) This means the structure group of a principal Gbundle is \u2018broken\u2019, from G down to a reductive subgroup, at any marked point where a connection has an irregular singularity.\nNow set hi = Lie(Hi), i.e.\nhi = {X \u2208 g|adX (Ai) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = adX (Ap) = 0} \u2286 g ,\nwhich is a reductive Lie subalgebra. In particular h1 is the centraliser of Q, and the previous section corresponds to the case where p = 1\u2014with h = h1. Finally, since t \u2286 hi (and it is a Cartan subalgebra there), we can consider the corresponding root system hi = (hi, t) \u2286 g, leading to (14).\nNow there is a corresponding filtration of Weyl (sub)groups\nWh1 \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 Whp+1 = Wg ,\nand one of the main results of [30] establishes that the deformation space BQ is a product, with each factor BAi \u2286 t determined as in (9) by the fission hi \u2286 hi+1 (it is the space of admissible deformations of Ai \u2208 t). Then Wg acts diagonally on BQ \u2286 tp.\nNoww(Q) \u2208 BQ means thatw(Ai) \u2208 BAi for i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}, and this condition can be described recursively using Lemma 3.1. To this end define a sequence of subgroups\nW1 \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 Wp \u2286 Wg ,\nas follows. Set as above Ui := Ker( hi), and then\nWp := StabWg(Up) , Wi\u22121 := StabWi(Ui\u22121) \u2286 Wi , i \u2208 {2, . . . , p} . (15)\nDenote then OQ the orbit of the irregular type under the action of the smallest group W1 \u2286 Wg. Lemma 3.3 One hasWi\u22121 = StabWi(BAi) for i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}, and (WgQ)\u2229BQ = OQ. Proof First w(Ap) \u2208 BAp if and only if w \u2208 Wp, and the first statement has been proven in Lemma 3.1\u2014for i = p.\nThen we can replace (hp, g) with (hp\u22121, hp), and repeat the same construction: we need w \u2208 Wp such that w(Ap\u22121) \u2208 BAp\u22121 , where\nBAp\u22121 = Up\u22121 \u2229 \u22c2\nhp\\ hp\u22121 (t \\ Ker(\u03b1)) \u2286 t ,\nby (9). Reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 3.1 this requires w( hp\u22121) \u2286 hp\u22121 , which is equivalent to preserving the partition hp = hp\u22121 \u222a ( hp \\ hp\u22121), since by (recurrence) hypothesis w( hp) \u2286 hp . Hence w \u2208 Wp\u22121 and\nWp\u22121 = StabWp(BAp\u22121) \u2286 Wp .\nDescending until i = 1 shows that w(Q) \u2208 BQ if and only if w \u2208 \u22c2i Wi = W1, and proves the first statement\u2014inductively.\nNote W1 \u2286 Wg is determined by the flag of kernels\nU = (t \u2287 U1 \u2287 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2287 Up) , (16)\nby (15). Indeed consider the (parabolic) stabiliser of (16), within Wg, i.e.\nStabWg(U) := \u22c2\ni\nStabWg(Ui) \u2286 Wg , (17)\nwhich coincides with Wg \u2229 StabGL(t)(U); then: Lemma 3.4 One has W1 = StabWg(U). Proof Postponed to Appendix B.\nThus the restriction of orbits to BQ is controlled by the action of the setwise Weylstabiliser of the kernel flag (16), generalising the inductive step.\nRemark 3.4 Beware however it is not true in general that StabWg(Ui) = StabWg(BAi): e.g. for the fission \u2205 = h1 \u2286 h2 \u2286 g one has U1 = t, so StabWg(U1) = Wg; but\nBA1 = t \\ \u22c3\nh2\nKer(\u03b1) \u2286 t ,\nwhich is not stabilised by Wg if h2 \u2286 g is a proper Lie subalgebra. Analogously we can identify the subgroup fixing the irregular type.\nLemma 3.5 One has Wh1 = (Wg)U1 = (Wg)Q.4 Proof By definition w(Q) = Q if and only if w(Ai) = Ai for i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}, i.e. w \u2208\u22c2i(Wg)Ai .\nNow the argument of Lemma 3.2 yields the inductive step for the proof of the identity\n\u22c2\nj i p (Wg)Ai = (Wg){Aj,...,Ap} = Whj \u2286 Wg , j \u2208 {1, . . . , p} ,\nwhence (Wg)Q = Wh1 \u2286 Wg .\nOn the other hand\nWh1 = \u22c2\ni\nWhi \u2286 \u22c2\ni\n(Wg)Ui = (Wg)U1 ,\nsince U1 =\u2211i Ui \u2286 t, and Whi acts as the identity on Ui = Ker( hi). Finally if w acts as the identity on U1 then it also fixes (pointwise) BAi \u2286 U1 for i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}, thus (Wg)U1 \u2286 (Wg)BQ \u2286 (Wg)Q ,\nproving the remaining inclusion. In particular by Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5 we also have an inclusion Whi \u2286 Wi, since\nWhi = (Wg)Ui \u2286 StabWg(Uj) , j \u2208 {i, . . . , p} ,\nas Ui =\u22c3 j i Uj \u2286 t. It follows that Wh1 is a normal subgroup of StabWg(U1), hence a fortiori of (17), and we consider again the quotient group\nWg|h := StabWg(U)/Wh1 . (18)\nNote the numerator of (18) depends on thewhole sequenceh = (h1, . . . , hp), while the denominator only depends on the last term\u2014the pointwise stabiliser of a flag/filtration only depend on its union/sum, contrary to the setwise stabiliser.\nExample 3.2 (Complete fission and generic case) In particular if the fission is \u2018complete\u2019, which means that H1 = StabG(Q) = T \u2286 G is the maximal torus, then h1 = \u2205; in this case U1 = t and Wh1 is trivial, so Wg|h StabWg(U).\nIf further Ap \u2208 treg, then U is stationary at t, and StabWg(U) = Wg. 4 Note in the rightmost identity we consider two different actions of Wg: the former is an action on t, the latter on t \u2297 T ,a.\nFinally by construction there is a topological identification BQ BQ/Wg|h, and the same argument of the proof of Proposition 3.1 yields the following.\nTheorem 3.1 The projection BQ \u2192 BQ is a Galois covering, and Q is an extension of Wg|h by Q.\nOf course if W1 = Wh1 then BQ = BQ, in which case the WMCG is pure (and has been studied in [30])."

The setwise stabiliser ofU = Ker( h) \u2286 t is bigger in general, sincewe can also permute components of h of the same rank.\nTo state this precisely consider two nonempty finite sets I and K , and suppose I = \u2210k\u2208K Ik is a K -partition of I with parts Ik \u2286 I of equal cardinality m 1\u2014so|I| = m|K|. Then the symmetric group SI contains the subgroup\nN := {\u03c4 \u2208 SI|\u03c4(Ik) \u2286 Ik for k \u2208 K} (Sm)|K| ,\nwhich stabilises all parts (and permutes their elements). If I has a total order then there is a \u2018complementary\u2019 subgroup P \u2286 SI, which permutes all parts (fixing their elements): more precisely, if Ik = ( i(k)1 , . . . , i (k) m ) \u2286 I for k \u2208 K, then any element of \u03c3 \u2208 SK P acts as\n\u03c3 : i(k)j \u2212\u2192 i(\u03c3k)j \u2208 I , j \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} .\nBy construction N \u2229 P = 1 inside SI, and P acts on N by conjugation. Lemma 5.1 (Cf. [72], Lemma 3.2.8). If \u03c4 =\u220fK \u03c4(k) \u2208 N, with \u03c4(k) \u2208 SIk Sm, then\n\u03c3\u03c4\u03c3\u22121 = \u220f\nK\n\u03c4(\u03c3 \u22121 k ) \u2208 N , \u03c3 \u2208 P . (20)\nHencewe have an inner semidirect product P N \u2286 SI, and it follows that (P N)/ N P canonically. Equivalently the outer semidirect product of P and N , with respect to the action (20), comes with a natural group embedding P N \u21aa\u2192 SI. This latter is also the wreath product SK Sm \u21aa\u2192 SI, cf. Appendix A.5 Remark 5.2 One has\n|P N| = (m!) |K||K|! (m|K| )! = |SI| ,\nwith strict inequality if 1 < m < |I|. Thus the embedding P N \u21aa\u2192 SI is proper for nontrivial partitions of I.\nLet us apply this to the present situation: for an integer i 1 denote\nKi := {j \u2208 J||Ij| = i} \u2286 J .\nIf i 2, the integer |Ki| 0 is thus the multiplicity of Ai\u22121 as an irreducible component of h. Instead for i = 1 one has a natural bijection\nK1 \u2212\u2192 {i \u2208 n| \u00b1 \u03b1\u2212ij /\u2208 h for any j} , Ij = {i} \u2212\u2192 i .\nThe subgroups Pi SKi and Ni (Si)|Ki| of SJ are defined as above\u2014note J inherits a natural total order as a subset of n.\n5 This is a particular example of application of the operadic composition of the symmetric group operad, cf. [72, Section 3.1] and see below.\nProposition 5.1 There is a canonical group isomorphism\nStabWg(U) \u220f\ni 0\n( SKi Si ) \u2286 Wg . (21)\nProof The statement is the algebraic rewriting of the following claim: the setwise stabiliser of U = Ker( h) is the subgroup of Wg = Sn that permutes parts Ij \u2286 n of the same cardinality, and that further permutes the elements within each part. By the above discussion this yields the direct product (21)\u2014as permutations of disjoint parts commute.\nTo prove the claim, recall the \u2018extended\u2019 kernel K\u0303er( h) \u2286 V (in the general linear case) is defined by the condition that the coordinate of any vector are equal within each part CIj \u2286 V , so its setwise stabiliser is given by the above condition. Thus to conclude it is enough to show that the setwise Weyl-stabiliser of the \u2018essential\u2019 kernel U = K\u0303er( h) \u2229 t (in the special linear case) is the same; but by construction\nK\u0303er( h) = U \u2295 CIdV \u2286 gl(V ) ,\nand the centre is fixed (pointwise) by Wg (cf. Remark 5.1). Corollary 5.1 One has Wg|h \u220fi 0 SKi . Proof By definition Wg|h is the quotient (10), which is readily computed in this case using Proposition 5.1 and the factorisation\nWh \u220f\ni 1 (Si)\n|Ki| . (22)\nRemark 5.3 This corresponds to the fact that Wg|h is naturally identified with the subgroup permuting parts of equal cardinality, fixing elements within each part. In particular the exact group sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 Wh \u2212\u2192 StabWg(U) \u2212\u2192 Wg|h \u2212\u2192 1\nsplits. (This underlies a more general statement about reflection groups.) Further (22) is naturally a subgroup of the Weyl group of the \u2018reduced\u2019 root system\ng|U = {\u03b1|U|\u03b1 \u2208 g} A|J|\u22121 ,\nviz. a subgroup of \u2018admissible\u2019 permutations\u2014inside SJ. On the whole there is a Galois covering BQ \u2192 BQ with \u220f i 0 ( |Ki|!) sheets, and to go further let us work within gl(V ) \u2287 g. Recall from [30] that there is a\ncanonical vector space isomorphism U\u0303 := K\u0303er( h) CJ , and by Remark 5.1 the Wg-equivariant inclusion U \u21aa\u2192 U\u0303 yields homotopy equivalences\nBQ Conf |J| , BQ/Wg UConf |J| ,\nwith fundamental groups PBr |J| and Br |J|, respectively. What we have here is an \u2018intermediate\u2019 covering, since it is only Wg|h that acts (freely) on BQ.\nTo simplify the notation let us then contemplate the following abstract situation. For an integer d 1 consider the ordered configuration space Yd := Confd \u2286 Cd, as well as an I-partition \u03d5 : d I with parts Ii = \u03d5\u22121(i) \u2286 d, for i \u2208 I. Then there is a natural group embedding\nS\u03d5 := \u220f\nI\nSIi \u21aa\u2192 Sd ,\nobtained by juxtaposing permutations, and we let X\u03d5 := Yd/S\u03d5 (the \u2018semiordered\u2019 configuration space): this is the space of configurations of d = \u2211i |Ii| points in the complex plane, such that 2 of them are indistinguishable if they lie within the same part of the I-partition.\nTo identify the fundamental group recall there is an \u2018augmentation\u2019 groupmorphism pd : Brd \u2192 Sd, with kernel \u03c01(Yd) = PBrd \u2286 Brd. Proposition 5.2 There is a group isomorphism\n\u03c01(X\u03d5) Br\u03d5 \u2286 Brd , Br\u03d5 := p\u22121d (S\u03d5) ,\nand Br\u03d5 is an extension of S\u03d5 by PBrd.\nHere Br\u03d5 is thus the \u2018semipure\u2019 braid group of the partition, i.e. the group of braids whose underlying permutation lies within S\u03d5 \u2286 Sd. Proof There are Galois coverings Yd \u2192 Xd =: UConfd and Yd \u2192 X\u03d5, and it follows the induced map X\u03d5 \u2192 Xd is a covering (with [ Sd : S\u03d5] sheets). Up to identifying groups and torsors after a suitable choice of base points, this yields a commutative diagram of pointed topological spaces, with (principle) fibre bundles in each row:\nIn turn this leads to a morphism of (short) exact group sequences, proving the statement:\nNote indeed Ker ( pd|Br\u03d5 ) = Ker(pd) \u2229 Br\u03d5 = PBrd. In our situation we thus find a group isomorphism\n\u03c01(BQ) Br\u03d5 \u2286 Br |J| ,\nwhere \u03d5 : J I \u2286 Z 0 is the I-partition obtained from J = \u2210i 0 Ki by removing the empty parts.\nRemark 5.4 The extreme cases are S\u03d5 = 1, where X\u03d5 = Yd, and S\u03d5 = Sd, where X\u03d5 = Xd is the (fully) unordered configuration space. In our setting this means either no two irreducible components of h have the same rank, or conversely they all have the same rank\u2014respectively. Remark 5.5 There is also a different subgroup of Brd associated with the partition and projecting onto S\u03d5, namely \u220f i BrIi \u21aa\u2192 Brd: this is the subgroup obtained by\njuxtaposing |I | braids, each on |Ii| strands. However in general the inclusion\u220fi BrIi \u2286 Br\u03d5 is proper. E.g. Br1 \u00d7 Br1 \u2286 Br2 is trivial, while\np\u221212 (S1 \u00d7 S1) = p\u221212 (1) = PBr2 Z .\nThis simple example shows the fundamental group of the semiordered configuration space is not just the direct product of the corresponding braid groups. Indeed it is possible two points in different parts braid across each other (along a loop in X\u03d5), provided the are not swapped by the underlying permutation of the overall braid. Remark 5.6 By the Galois correspondence, the isomorphism class of the covering X\u03d5 \u2192 Xd matches up with the conjugacy class of a subgroup of Brd = \u03c01(Xd).6 This is precisely the conjugacy class of Br\u03d5 \u2286 Brd, which is generically nontrivial, as S\u03d5 \u2286 Sd is generically not a normal subgroup."

A ranked fission tree is a fission tree T = (T0,\u03c6) equipped with a rank function r : T0 \u2192 Z 1, i.e. a function satisfying\nr(i) = \u2211\n\u03c6\u22121(i)\nr(j) , i \u2208 T0 .\nThen r(T) := r(\u2217) 1 is the rank of the tree. This means to each node we attach a positive rank, which equals the sum of its child-nodes\u2019. In particular \u2211\nJl r(i) = r(T), independently of the level, and the rank function is determined by assigning ranks to the leaves\u2014i.e. by r|J1 \u2208 ZJ1 1.\nThe algorithm to associate a ranked fission tree (T, r) to (14) is the following: the underlying fission tree is constructed as in [30], and we further set r(i) = k + 1 if the node i \u2208 Jl corresponds to a type-A irreducible rank-k component of hl+1 . Working within the general linear Lie algebra, this is the same as setting r(i) = k if i corresponds to an irreducible component isomorphic to glk(C)\u2014including gl1(C) = \u2205. It follows that r(T) = n if we work within gln(C).7\nBy construction the Weyl group of hl \u2286 g comes with a canonical group isomorphism\nWhl \u220f\ni\u2208Jl Sr(i) , l \u2208 p , (23)\nand to construct the stabiliser of the kernel flag in terms of the tree we introduce the following.\nDefinition 5.2 An isomorphism (T0, , r) \u2192 (T\u20320, \u2032, r\u2032) of ranked fission trees is a bijection f : T0 \u2192 T\u20320 matching roots, and such that there are commutative diagrams:\nAn automorphism of (T0, , r) is an isomorphism (T0, , r) \u2192 (T0, , r); their group is denoted Aut(T, r).\nThis restricts the usual notion of isomorphism of (rooted) trees, by further asking that ranks be preserved.

In particular let T = T (T, r) be the set of (ranked)maximal proper subtrees, i.e. the subtrees of T rooted at each child-node of the root, and choose a complete set of representatives T\u0303 \u2286 T of isomorphism classes. Finally denote n(t) 1 the cardinality of the isomorphism class of any maximal proper subtree t \u2208 T . Definition 5.3 The extended automorphism group A\u0303ut(T, r) of the ranked fission tree (T, r) is defined recursively by\nA\u0303ut(T, r) = \u220f\nt\u2208T\u0303 Sn(t) A\u0303ut(t, r0) , r0 := r|T0 , (24)\nwith basis A\u0303ut (i, r(i)) := Sr(i) for i \u2208 J1. A priori (24) depends on the choice of T\u0303 \u2286 T , but the following identification in particular shows it does not.\nTheorem 5.1 One has A\u0303ut(T, r) = StabWg(U). Further the automorphism group Aut(T, r) is obtained recursively as in (24) but with recursion basis Aut (i, r(i)) := S1 for i \u2208 J1\u2014the trivial group. Proof The first item can be proven by induction on p 1. If p = 1 then a maximal proper subtree is a leaf, so T = J1: then two leaves are isomorphic (as ranked trees) if and only if they have the same rank. Hence for i \u2208 J1 the integer n(i) 1 is the number of rank-r(i) leaves, and in this case\nA\u0303ut(T, r) = \u220f\ni\u2208\u0303J1 Sn(i) Sr(i) \u2286 Sr(T) ,\nwhere J\u03031 \u2286 J1 is a set of representatives of leaves\u2014of all possible ranks. The result follows from Proposition 5.1.\nNow let p 2. By the induction hypothesis, the bases of thewreath products in (24) are the setwise stabilisers of the deformation space of the \u2018sub-irregular types\u2019 corresponding to the eigenspaces of the leading coefficient. In addition to that, we are then permuting isomorphic maximal proper subtrees, i.e. eigenspaces of the leading coefficient whose nested decomposition (into eigenspaces for the subleading coefficients) plays a symmetric role: this yields the whole of StabWg(U), as any other permutation of the eigenvalues of the leading coefficient moves the irregular type out of the space of admissible deformations.\nThe second item is a straightforward extension from the unranked case, and can also be proven recursively on p 1. If p = 1 an automorphism is the data a permutation of the leaves which matches up ranks. Hence in this case\nAut(T, r) = \u220f\ni\u2208\u0303J1 Sn(i) =\n\u220f i\u2208\u0303J1 Sn(i) S1 ,\nusing the above notation. (Note Sn(i) \u2286 SJ1 is naturally identified with the symmetric group of rank-r(i) leaves.)\nNow let p 2. By the induction hypothesis the bases of the wreath products in (24) are the automorphism groups of the maximal proper ranked subtrees. In addition to that, we are then permuting isomorphic maximal proper subtrees: this yields the whole of Aut(T, r), as any other permutation of child-nodes of the root, bringing along the corresponding subtrees, cannot restrict to an isomorphism of these latter. Example 5.1 The most symmetric example is that in which r is constant at each level. In this case any automorphism of the underlying tree T = (T0, ) preserves the rank function.\nIf moreover T is a complete m-ary tree, viz. if all interior nodes have m 1 child-nodes, then simply\nAut(T, r) Sm \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Sm\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 p times ,\nthe p-fold wreath power\u2014recall this example of wreath product is associative. The extended group instead is A\u0303ut(T, r) (Sm) p Sr , where r 1 is the rank of any leaf.\nOn the opposite end r is injective at each level, so the group Aut(T, r) is trivial, and A\u0303ut(T, r) \u220fJ1 Sr(i) \u2286 Sr(T). In this case the WMCG is pure.\nNow by (recursive) construction Aut(T, r) \u2286 A\u0303ut(T, r) is a subgroup, so by Theorem 5.1 it can be identified with a subgroup of the kernel-flag stabiliser.\nIndeed choose f \u2208 Aut(T, r), so by definition f : T0 \u2192 T0 yields rank-preserving permutations fl := f |Jl \u2208 SJl of the nodes at each level l \u2208 p + 1.

This yields an injective group morphism \u03b9 : Aut(T, r) \u21aa\u2192 StabWg(U)\u2014since f is determined by f1.\nBy construction the image of \u03b9 is disjoint from Wh1 = \u220f\nJ1 Sr(i) (using (23)), and acts on it by conjugation, so there is a second group embedding\n\u03b9\u0303 : Aut(T,p) Wh1 \u21aa\u2192 A\u0303ut(T, r) .

Lemma 5.2 Let m 0 be an integer and P a group, and choose a normal subgroup N \u2286 P. Then 1 N \u2286 Sm P is a normal subgroup, and in this identification there is a canonical group isomorphism\n(Sm P) /N Sm (P/N) . (26)\nProof Postponed to Appendix B. Hence in brief there is an explicit (finite) algorithm to compute the \u2018effective\u2019 subquotient of the Weyl group acting freely on the deformation space of any type-A irregular type, to yield the deformation space of the associated irregular class.\nExample 5.2 Let us look at the examples of type-A irregular type considered in [30], which all had pure WMCG isomorphic to PBr2 \u00d7 PBr23 \u00d7 PBr4. We will see their associated stabilisers are not all isomorphic.\nLet us work with the Lie group G = SL9(C): an irregular type Q is given by a polynomial in the variable x = z\u22121, whose coefficients are traceless diagonal matrices of size 9.\nFirst consider\nQ = A1x + A2x2 + A3x3 , Ai \u2208 sl9(C) ,\nwith\nA1 = diag(4, 3, 2, 1, 0,\u22121,\u22122,\u22123,\u22124), A2 = diag(4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0,\u22123,\u22124,\u22127), A3 = diag(2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0,\u22127).\nThe corresponding ranked fission tree (T, r) is drawn below, indicating the rank of each node within the corresponding vertex:\nFrom the recursive algorithm we get\nAut(T, r) = S2 \u00d7 (S2 S3) .\nThis is the same as the automorphism group of the ranked tree for the irregular type Q = A1x + A2x2, with\nA1 = diag(4, 3, 2, 1, 0, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u22124) , A2 = diag(4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122) \u2208 sl9(C) .\nIndeed in that case the ranked fission tree is as follows:\nFinally let us consider Q = A1x + A2x2 + A3x3 + A4x4, with\nA1 = diag(4, 3, 2, 1, 0,\u22121,\u22122,\u22123,\u22124), A2 = diag(4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0,\u22123,\u22124,\u22127), A3 = diag(2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0,\u22123,\u22123,\u22123), A4 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0,\u22122,\u22124).\nThe ranked fission tree is then:\nIts automorphism group is now Aut(T, r) = S3 \u00d7 S32, which is not the same as in the previous two cases. This is not contradictory: Q only depends on the whole set of unordered configuration spaces attached to the (unranked) fission tree, while Q also depends on their positions in the tree."

More precisely recursive cabling along the (unranked) fission tree T = (T0, ) leads to the pure \u2018cabled braid group\u2019PB(T) \u2286 PBr|J1| of the tree, and there is a group isomorphism \u03c01(BQ) PB(T).8 The point is that in the pure case one finds a \u2018noncrossed\u2019 group/action operad, which in particular implies (28) is a group morphism equipping the domain with the direct product structure.\nHere instead we naturally encountered the operadic composition of the symmetric\ngroup operad S = ( S\u2022, 1 \u2208 S1, \u03b3S ) , viz. the function\n\u03b3S : Sn \u00d7 n\u220f\ni=1 SKi \u2212\u2192 Sk , (\u03c3,\u03c4) \u2212\u2192 \u03b3S (\u03c3;\u03c4) , (29)\nfor \u03c3 \u2208 Sn and \u03c4 =\u220fni=1 \u03c4(i). Its definition is a generalisation of the above construction to arbitrary partitions k = \u2210ni=1 Ii, where Ki = |Ii|. Namely there is a \u2018block permutation\u2019 operation\nSn \u2212\u2192 Sk , \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 \u03c3\u3008K1, . . . ,Kn\u3009 ,\nwhich consists in the permutation of all parts by fixing their elements, and then\n\u03b3S (\u03c3;\u03c4) := \u03c3\u3008K1, . . . ,Kn\u3009 \u00b7 \u03c4 \u2208 Sk ,\nwith tacit use of the natural group embedding \u220f\ni SIi \u21aa\u2192 Sk on the right factor. Lemma 5.3 If K1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = Kn then (29) is an injective morphism, equipping the domain with the semidirect product structure.\nProof Postponed to Appendix B. Remark 5.7 This means the operadic compositions yields in particular group embeddings Sn Sm \u21aa\u2192 Smn , which were used above.\nThe recursive definition (24) now becomes\nAut(T, r) = \u220f\nt\u2208T\u0303 \u03b3S\n( Sn(t) \u00d7 Aut(t, r0)n(t) ) \u2286 SJ1 , r0 = r|t0 , (30)\n8 See op. cit. for an explanation of terminology, due to the nested braiding of eigenspaces for the coefficients of the irregular type.\nstarting again from the trivial group at each leaf. Finally, this can reformulated to exhibit the relation with braid groups.\nLemma 5.4 Let {Pi}i\u2208I and {Ni}i\u2208I be finite collections of groups, and \u03c1i : Pi \u2192 Aut(Ni) group morphisms. Then there is a canonical group isomorphism\nP N \u220f\nI\nPi Ni , P = \u220f\nI\nPi , N = \u220f\nI\nNi ,\nusing the production action on the left-hand side:\n\u03c1 : P \u2212\u2192 \u220f\nI\nAut(Ni) \u2286 Aut(N ) , \u03c1 = \u220f\nI\n\u03c1i .\nProof Postponed to Appendix B. It follows that (30) is equivalent to the recursive definition\nAut(T, r) = S\u03d5 \u220f\nT\u0303 Aut(T, r0)n(t) , (31)\nintroducing the T\u0303 -partition \u03d5 : Jp \u2192 T\u0303 induced from the isomorphism classes of maximal proper subtrees; this means S\u03d5 =\u220fT\u0303 Sn(t) \u2286 SJp .\nThe expression (31) clarifies the natural definition of an analogous (full/nonpure) \u2018cabled\u2019 braid groups: one should \u2018lift\u2019 this through the (augmentation) operad morphism p : B \u2192 S , whereB = ( Br\u2022, 1 \u2208 Br1, \u03b3B ) is the (full/nonpure) braid group\noperad.\nDefinition 5.4 The cabled braid group of the ranked tree (T, r) is the group recursively defined by\nB(T, r) = Br\u03d5 \u220f\nT\u0303 B(t, r0)n(t) \u2286 Br |J1| , (32)\nwith basis B (i, r(i)) := Br1, for i \u2208 J1, using the semipure braid group of Proposition 5.2.\nHere Br\u03d5 \u2286 Br |Jp| is the subgroup corresponding to the braiding of the maximal proper subtrees (i.e. the equal-dimensional eigenspaces of the leading coefficient), acting by conjugation of the cabled braid group of any such subtree.\nFinally we can prove that (32) is the correct definition, i.e. that indeed this is the group controlling the topology of admissible deformations of type-A irregular classes.\nTheorem 5.2 There is a group isomorphism \u03c01(BQ) B(T, r), and B(T, r) is an extension of Aut(T, r) byPB(T).\nProof By Proposition 5.3 the projection BQ \u2192 BQ amounts to the Galois covering over the quotient BQ/Aut(T, r), so the claimed group extension will follow from the first statement\u2014as PB(T) \u03c01(BQ), cf. [30].\nThe first statement instead can be proven by induction on p 1. If p = 1 then PB(T) = PBr |J1|, andB(T, r) \u2286 Br |J1| is the \u2018semipure\u2019 braid group of partition of the leaves into equal-rank nodes: the result then follows from Proposition 5.2.\nNow suppose p 2, and write B(T) the space determined by the (unranked) tree as in (27). By definition\nB(T) = Conf |Jp| \u00d7 \u220f\nt\u2208T\u0303 B(t, r0)n(t) ,\nwith the usual notation for representatives of maximal proper subtrees, and for the cardinality of their isomorphism classes. Then for t \u2208 T\u0303 the base of the wreath product Sn(t) Aut(t, r0) acts on the rightmost factor, while Sn(t) is naturally a subgroup of permutations of the child-nodes of the roots\u2014permuting the (isomorphic) subtrees rooted there.\nAssume first T\u0303 = {t} is a singleton, i.e. all maximal proper subtrees are isomorphic, and let n := |Jp|. Then simply B(T) = Confn \u00d7 B(t)n, and accordingly Aut(T, r) = Sn Aut(t, r0) by (24).\nNow we have a natural surjective map B(T) \u2192 UConfn, composing the canonical projection B(T) \u2192 Confn with the Galois covering Confn \u2192 UConfn; and there is also a Galois covering B(T) \u2192 B(T, r) := B(T)/Aut(T, r). By construction the former factorises through the latter, so there is a commutative triangle of topological spaces:\nThe difference from the case p = 1 is that the arrows onto the unordered configuration space are not coverings, but rather (locally trivial) fibre bundles with positive-dimensional fibres. For \u03c0 this is clear (it is the composition of a trivial bundle and a locally trivial one), while for \u03c0 it can be proven as follows. If O \u2286 UConfn is an open trivialising set for \u03c0 , then \u03c0\u22121(O) = O\u0303 \u00d7 B(t)n, where O\u0303 Sn \u00d7 U is the preimage of O under the standard Galois covering, and\n\u03c0\u22121(O) = p ( \u03c0\u22121(O) ) = (O\u0303 \u00d7 B(t)n) /Aut(T, r) .\nNow the latter quotient can be taken in two steps: first the action of the base yields\n( O\u0303 \u00d7 B(t)n) / (1 Aut(t, r0)) O\u0303 \u00d7 B(t, r0)n ,\nand then the space O\u00d7B(t, r0)n \u2286 O\u00d7Sn\u00d7B(t, r0)n O\u0303\u00d7B(t, r0)n is a slice for the action of the \u2018complement\u2019 subgroup Sn 1. In conclusion \u03c0\u22121(O) O \u00d7 B(t, r0)n, proving we have a locally trivial fibre bundle\nB(t, r0)n \u21aa\u2192 B(T, r) \u03c0\u2212\u2192 UConfn .\nThis yields the exact group sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 B(t, r0)n \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (B(T, r)) \u03c01(\u03c0)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Brn \u2212\u2192 1 ,\nby the recursive hypothesis, using that UConfn is a \u03c0(K , 1)-space and that fibres are connected. Moreover any continuous function UConfn \u2192 B(t, r0)n yields a global section, so in conclusion there is a semidirect product decomposition\n\u03c01 (B(T, r)) Brn B(t, r0) =: Brn B(t, r0)n ,\nin accordance with the recursive definition (32). Finally consider the general casewhere T\u0303 is not a singleton. Thenwe can generalise the above argument using the composition of projections\nB(T) \u2212\u2192 B(T, r) \u2212\u2192 X\u03d5 = Confn/S\u03d5 ,\nonto the semiordered configuration space, where \u03d5 : Jp \u2192 T\u0303 is as above. Again a 2-step quotient (over any open trivialising subspace O \u2286 X\u03d5) can be taken with respect to the actions of the subgroups\n\u220f\nT\u0303\n( 1 Aut(t, r0)n(t) ) , \u220f\nT\u0303\n( Sn(t) 1 ) \u2286 Aut(T, r) ,\nwhose (inner) product gives the whole of Aut(T, r) in view of Lemma 5.4. The analogous commutative triangle of topological spaces then yields the fibre bundle\n\u220f\nT\u0303 B(t, r0)n(t) \u21aa\u2192 B(T, r) \u03c0\u2212\u2192 X\u03d5 ,\nwhence the exact group sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 \u220f\nT\u0303 B(t, r0)n(t) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (B(T, r)) \u03c01(\u03c0)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Br\u03d5 \u2212\u2192 1 ,\nusing the recursive hypothesis, Proposition 5.2, the fact that fibres are connected, and that X\u03d5 is a covering of a K (\u03c0, 1)-space\u2014so it is also a K (\u03c0, 1). Again this has global sections, since there are continuous maps X\u03d5 \u2192 \u220fT\u0303 B(t, r0)n(t), proving the statement. Remark 5.8 The auxiliary fibre bundle\nSn \u00d7 B(t)n \u21aa\u2192 B(T) \u03c0\u2212\u2192 UConfn ,\nwhich appears in the above proof when T\u0303 = {t}, yields the following exact group sequence:\n1 \u2212\u2192 PB(t)n \u2212\u2192 PB(T) \u03c01(\u03c0)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Brn \u2212\u2192 Sn \u2212\u2192 1 .\nThis is recovering the fact that PB(T)/PB(t)n PBrn, considering the direct product over the nodes of the (unranked) fission tree."

[70]).\nExamples of such isomonodromy systems abound, with far-reaching applications already in the genus-zero case, famously encompassing (generalisations of) the Painlev\u00e9 equations [8, 25, 50\u201352] and the Schlesinger system [58] (cf. also [47]). The (Harnad-)dual version of the Schlesinger system, on the other side of the Fourier\u2013 Laplace transform [38, 69], was considered in [12], and the combination of Schlesinger and its dual yield the system of Jimbo\u2013Miwa\u2013M\u00f4ri\u2013Sato (JMMS) [41]. Recall the Painlev\u00e9 property of the JMMS equations was studied in [47].\nNote also that [38] links previous papers about isospectral deformations [1, 2] to the isomonodromic deformations of JMMS. However this hardly the whole story: a rigorous treatment of the degeneration of the isomonodromic deformations of JMMS into a combination of the isospectral deformations and the Whitham dynamics is still open, cf. [61] for a related conjecture, and [66] in the quantum case\u2014with applications to quantum groups and canonical bases. In particular the \u2018cactus\u2019 groups naturally appear; these are fundamental groups of certain compactifications of the real points in the base space, controlling the asymptotics zones of the nonlinear isomonodromy equations (analogous of the braid groups encountered here).\nFinally a generalisation of all the above was derived in [15]. This latter setup brings about nongeneric isomonodromic deformations, considering connections with several levels, which extend examples of the seminal paper [42]. (Recall the set of levels is the set of nonzero pole orders of the irregular types, evaluated at each root.) Importantly this is more symmetric than op. cit., which in turn is one of our main motivations for studying the \u2018deeper\u2019 nongeneric case: in particular in [15] the group SL2(C) acts on the bundle of de Rham spaces via automorphisms of the 1-dimensional Weyl algebra,\nand contains the Fourier\u2013Laplace transform as the element ( 0 \u22121 1 0 ) .\nImportantly all these Hamiltonian systems have far-reaching applications in mathematical physics, notably in integrable hierarchies of differential equations such as\n10 The difference of the corresponding horizontal distributions\u2014inside TO\u00d7 T M Tp1\u2212\u2212\u2192 T O\u2014is given by O-dependent (vertical) vector fields Xi : O \u00d7 M \u2192 T M on the fibre, and one has dHi = \u3008\u03c9,Xi\u3009 (cf. [15, Section 5]).\nKdV [37], and in 2d conformal field theory after quantisation (e.g. [3, 34, 35, 48, 68], opening to \u2018irregular\u2019 conformal blocks and theAGT correspondence).More precisely the quantisation of the Schlesinger system leads to the Knizhnik\u2013Zamolodchikov connection (KZ) [39, 57], while the quantisation of the dual Schlesinger system (as in [12]) leads to the Casimir connection of de Concini/Millson\u2013Toledano Laredo [46]. The quantisation of the JMMS systems, generalising the above and recovering the connection of Felder\u2013Markov\u2013Tarasov\u2013Varchenko [33], was considered in [55]; further op. cit. constructed a quantisation of the more general \u2018simply-laced\u2019 systems of [15] (this is resumed in the table in the introduction of [55]); cf. [71] for a different construction of \u2018quantum\u2019 simply-laced isomonodromy systems, and [36, 48, 49] for a \u2018confluence\u2019 viewpoint on the quantisation of irregular singularities.\nFinally encoding the irregular moduli in the base curve, and constructing bundles over their (admissible) deformations, is also helpful for the quantisation of the extended \u2018classical\u2019 symmetries of isomonodromy systems. In particular the quantised SL2(C)symmetries [56] generalise the Howe duality [7], which in turn were used in [63] to compute the monodromy of the Casimir connection in terms of that of KZ (cf. also [62]): this latter example of generic \u2018quantum\u2019 monodromy action brings about the G-braid groups which we generalise in this series of papers."
