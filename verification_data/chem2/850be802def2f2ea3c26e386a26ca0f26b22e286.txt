"In the past few years, the strategy of nitrogen-oxygen bond cleavage of oxime and hydroxylamines has been widely used for the synthesis of various structurally diverse N-heterocycles. Using oximes and hydroxylamines through N-O bond cleavage have also been well-established for efficient access to the N-heterocycles, such as aziridines, β-lactam, 1H-indazoles, oxazoles, pyrrolines, pyrroles, pyridines, and other cyclic compounds. In the past few years, the synthesis of N-heterocycle by using oximes and hydroxylamines as nitrogen sources are summarized and discussed according to different nitrogen sources and heterocyclic types. Recently, the construction of heterocyccles by using the oxidation characteristics of oxime esters is more efficient and sustainable. Most of these reactions are usually conducted under cheap transition metal catalyst and oxygen, allowing the construction of N-heterocycles with good functional group tolerance and more diverse transformation. It is worth noting that the radical strategy shows more powerful prospects than the conventional transition metal catalytic strategy [9,66], allowing the development dual catalysis systems, such as synergistic copper and photoredox catalysis and synergistic nickel and photoredox catalysis [67–70]. In particular, the iminyl radicals as unstable nitrogen radicals can be transformed more often to synthesize complex and diverse N-heterocycles [71–73]. We hope that this review provides a new perspective on this field, and also provides a reference to develop environmentally friendly and sustainable methods."
