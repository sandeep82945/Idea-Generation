    "abstractText": "This contribution reports the synthesis of polyhydroxyurethane (PHU)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) multiblock copolymer networks crosslinked with polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ). First, the linear PHUPEO multiblock copolymers were synthesized via the step-growth polymerization of bis(6-membered cyclic carbonate) (B6CC) with \u03b1,\u03c9-diamino-terminated PEOs with variable molecular weights. Thereafter, the PHU-PEO copolymers were allowed to react with 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane (IPTS) to afford the derivatives bearing triethoxysilane moieties, the hydrolysis and condensation of which afforded the PHU-PEO networks crosslinked with PSSQ. It was found that the PHU-PEO networks displayed excellent reprocessing properties in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonate [Zn(OTf)2]. Compared to the PHU networks crosslinked via the reaction of difunctional cyclic carbonate with multifunctional amines, the organic\u2013inorganic PHU networks displayed the decreased reprocessing temperature. The metathesis of silyl ether bonds is responsible for the improved reprocessing behavior. By adding lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf), the PHU-PEO networks were further transformed into the solid polymer electrolytes. It was found that the crystallization of PEO chains in the crosslinked networks was significantly suppressed. The solid polymer electrolytes had the ionic conductivity as high as 7.64\u00d7 10\u22125 S\u00d7 cm\u22121 at 300 K. More importantly, the solid polymer electrolytes were recyclable; the reprocessing did not affect the ionic conductivity.",

            "text": "Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of major synthetic polymers and have been applied in various fields [1\u20135]. In general, PUs are synthesized via the step-growth polymerization of diisocyanates with diols or/and polyols. In terms of the types and compositions of the reactants (or monomers), PUs can be designed to display the thermomechanical properties from elastomers, thermoplastics to thermosets. Albeit PUs have wide-spread applications, there has long been the concern about the synthesis of diisocyanates (i.e., one of the monomers) since the starting compound for diisocyanates (i.e., phosgene) is highly toxic [6\u20138]. Recently, it has been realized that isocyanates themselves are also harmful to human health [9,10]. Therefore, there is a high demand for the synthesis of PUs via so-called non-isocyanate routes or for finding PU substitutes. In the past years, a considerable effort has been made to solve this issue [11\u201316]. Poly(hydroxyurethane)s (PHUs) are among the promising alternatives to traditional PUs [17\u201321]. PHUs can be synthesized via the ring-opening polyaddition of cyclic carbonates with amines [22\u201326]. Likewise, PHUs can be formulated into thermoplastics and thermosets, thermoplastic elastomers, and coatings [27\u201338]. For example, Torkelson et al. [27\u201331] have reported the synthesis of various linear (viz. thermoplastic) PHUs. M\u00fclhaupt et al. [39] reported the synthesis of bio-based PHU thermoplastics from biomass resources (e.g., erythritol, cinene). From the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15244634 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 2 of 19\nviewpoint of macromolecular structures, PHUs have a similar structure of main chains but carry a great number of primary or secondary hydroxyl groups. Owing to the presence of hydroxyl groups, PHUs have some additional properties such as resistance to nonpolar solvents and adhesive properties. In addition, the side hydroxyl groups can be further used for the modification of PHUs or post crosslinking. Crosslinked PHUs have also attracted a considerable interest because of their improved solvent resistance, thermal stability and mechanical properties compared with linear PHUs. In marked contrast to traditional crosslinked polymers, crosslinked PHUs themselves can be reprocessed without introducing dynamic covalent bonds. The reprocessing properties are attributable to the dynamic exchange reactions of carbamate moieties with hydroxyl groups at elevated temperatures. Hillmyer and Dichtel et al. [40,41] reported that the PHU networks from a six-membered cyclic carbonate and multiple amine can be reprocessed at elevated temperature (i.e., 170 \u25e6C or higher) and the mechanical properties can be recovered to 75%. Based on the crosslinking of difunctional five-membered cyclic carbonates with polyamines, Torkelson et al. [42] investigated the accelerated reprocessing and improved mechanical recovery by introducing transcarbamoylation catalyst (i.e., 4-dimethylaminopyridine). More recently, Seychal et al. [43] synthesized five cyclic carbonates and the corresponding crosslinked PHUs. Under the catalyst-free conditions, it was also found that all PHU networks displayed the stress relax behavior through the transcarbamoylation reactions at elevated temperature. Nonetheless, the reprocessing behavior required sufficiently high temperature (i.e., 160 \u25e6C) and long time (i.e., 15 h). The thermal treatment at fairly high temperature and with a long time would give rise to thermal degradation, which is one of the causes that the PHU networks displayed the incomplete recovery of mechanical strengths. Recently, a considerable interest has been attracted to introduce new dynamic chemical bonds to improve the reprocessing properties of PHU networks. For instance, Torkelson et al. [44] reported the introduction of disulfide bonds into PHU networks; it was demonstrated that the PHU networks displayed improved reprocessing properties. More recently, Zheng et al. [45] reported the synthesis of PHU networks crosslinked with trifunctional polyhedral oligomeric silsesquixanes (POSS) via Diels\u2013Alder (D\u2013A) reaction. The introduction of D\u2013A adducts allowed for the reprocessing of PHU-POSS networks to be performed at quite low temperature (i.e., 120 \u25e6C) for a short time (i.e., 20 min). In all previous reports, most of the PHU networks were obtained via the one-step crosslinking approach, i.e., the networks were generated with direct crosslinking of difunctional cyclic carbonates with polyamine. Compared with the direct crosslinking approach, the post crosslinking of PHU chains allows more flexible designs of network structures, which can endow the materials with new properties. Nonetheless, such an investigation remains largely unexplored. In this contribution, we reported a facile approach to obtain PHU networks via the post crosslinking of linear PHU-PEO multiblock copolymers. Toward this end, a series of linear polyhydroxyurethane (PHU) and poly(ethylene oxide) multiblock copolymers were first synthesized via the polyaddition of bis(6-membered cyclic carbonate) (B6CC) with \u03b1,\u03c9-diamino-terminated poly(ethylene oxide) (NH2-PEO-NH2). The as-obtained PHU-PEO copolymers were then reacted with the 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane (IPTS) to afford the PHU-PEO multiblock copolymers bearing triethoxysilane pendent groups. Upon hydrolyzing and condensing, the PHU-PEO copolymers were crosslinked with PSSQ segments. It is anticipated that the crosslinking of PHU with inorganic segments (i.e., PSSQ) would significantly improve the thermomechanical properties of the PHU networks. Owing to the generation of PSSQ linkages, sily ether bonds were simultaneously introduced to the PHU networks. It has been realized that silyl ether bonds can be transformed into dynamic covalent bonds while Lewis acid (e.g., trifluoromethanesulfonate, Zn(OTf)2) was added to the system [46]. With the introduction of new dynamic covalent bonds, the reprocessing temperature of the PHU networks would be significantly decreased [46\u201350]. In addition, the PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks are readily formulated into solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) by introducing lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) [46\u201349]. It is proposed that the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 3 of 19\nintroduction of the hydrophobic PSSQ segments would diminish the impact of moisture absorption on the electric conductivity. The ionic conductivity can be modulated according to the PEO contents in the networks. Furthermore, the networks of SPEs are recyclable with the build-in of two motifs (i.e., hydroxyl urethane structural units and sily ether bonds). Such reprocessing properties are important for the recycling of SPEs. The purpose of this work is two-fold: (i) to report an approach to obtain PHU networks in a post-crosslinking fashion and (ii) to decrease the reprocessing temperature by introducing the metathesis of sily ether bonds."

The crosslinking resulted from the hydrolysis and condensation of\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 6 of 19\ntriethoxysilane moieties, which were connected to the PHU-PEO main chains. The PHUPEO-PSSQ networks were subjected to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Representatively displayed in Figure S2 are the FTIR spectra of PHU-PEO1000 multiblock copolymer and its network crosslinked with PSSQ (denoted PHU-PEO1000-PSSQ). Compared to the former, there appeared a new band at 840 cm\u22121. This band is assignable to the stretching vibration of the C-Si bond, indicating that 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane was introduced. In the meantime, the band at 1638 cm\u22121 was intensified. This band is assignable to the stretching vibration of carbonyl of carbamate moiety. The increase in intensity for the band at 1638 cm\u22121 is ascribed to the reaction of isocyanate with hydroxyl groups, i.e., the number of carbamate moieties increased with the reaction. In addition, the band in the range of 1200~975 cm\u22121 was significantly broadened with the occurrence of the reaction. The band broadening is responsible for the overlap of the stretching vibration of Si-O-Si linkage with that of ether oxygen bonds (C-O-C). Of these two bands, the Si-O-Si linkages were generated by hydrolysis and condensation of triethoxysilane moieties. The FTIR spectroscopy indicates that PSSQ segment was successfully created and acted as the crosslinker of PHU-PEO copolymers. The crosslinking of the PHU-PEO multiblock copolymers was studied by rheological analysis; the rheological measurements were conducted at 60 \u25e6C, a temperature above the melting points of PEO and the glass transition temperatures (Tg\u2019s) of the networks. In this work, the small amplitude oscillation shear (SAOS) measurements were performed; the rheological data are presented in Figure S3. For all of the linear PHU-PEO copolymers, the dynamic shear moduli (G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032) increased with the shear frequency rising, indicating that these linear copolymers displayed typical viscoelastic properties. It is seen that the G\u2032\u2032 curves were above the G\u2032 curves. This observation indicates that these PHU-PEO multiblock copolymers behaved as the viscoelastic liquids. Notably, while 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane was introduced and the hydrolysis and condensation were carried out, the G\u2032 values exceeded the G\u2032\u2032 values (Figure 3), indicating that the samples were transformed into the elastic solids. In other word, the crosslinked networks were generated by hydrolysis and condensation. Notably, the shorter the PEO chains, the higher the G\u2032 values, indicating that the crosslinking densities increased while the lengths of PEO chains decreased. Interestingly, the G\u2032 curves gradually became flat, irrespective of shear frequency, especially for the samples with the PEO blocks shorter than Mn = 4000 Da. This observation suggests that the PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks exhibited the behavior of perfect elastomeric solids. The above results indicate that the linear PHU-PEO copolymers have been successfully crosslinked with PSSQ. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 19 densities of networks (\u03bd) can be estimated from the dynamic storage moduli of the linear viscoelastic regions with the following Equation [54]: 'G RT  = (1) where G\u2032 is the shear storage modulus in the linear viscoelastic regions as shown in Figure 4; T was temperature and R was the gas constant. The crosslinking densities were calculated and listed in Table S1. Notably, the crosslinking densities increased with decreasing the lengths of PEO chains.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 7 of 19\nA further insight into the nature of PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks can be obtained with the large amplitude oscillation shear (LAOS) measurements. For the LAOS measurements, the shear frequency was set at f = 10 rad/s with variable strain amplitude from \u03b3 = 10\u22122~102%. Figure 4 shows the plots of dynamic moduli (G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032) versus strain amplitudes. All the samples displayed the strain softening phenomena except for the PHU-PEO4000-PSSQ network, suggesting that the network structures via chemical crosslinking can be destructed while the strain amplitude was sufficiently large. It is proposed that the strain softening is attributable to the occurrence of the exchange of silyl ether bonds in the presence of Zn(OTf)2 [52,53]. For PHU-PEO4000-PSSQ network, the linear viscoelastic region was observed at the strain amplitude from 10\u22122 to 102%, suggesting that the dynamic exchange of silyl ether bonds was fairly weak since the content of PSSQ was fairly low. Increasing the contents of PSSQ (or decreasing the lengths of PEO chains) resulted in the strain softening appearing at low strain amplitudes. For the PHU-PEO2000-PSSQ network, the strain softening was detected at \u03b3 = 5.8%. For the PHU-PEO400-PSSQ network, the linear viscoelastic region was narrowed to \u03b3 = 0.33%, suggesting that the silyl ether metathesis can occur at a low strain amplitude. Except for PHU-PEO4000-PSSQ network, all other networks had the intersection points between the G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 curves. This observation suggests that these PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks had the plasticity in solids, i.e., the networks can be reprocessed. According to the theories of rubber elasticity, the crosslinking densities of networks (\u03bd) can be estimated from the dynamic storage moduli of the linear viscoelastic regions with the following Equation [54]:\n\u03c5 = G\u2032\nRT (1)\nwhere G\u2032 is the shear storage modulus in the linear viscoelastic regions as shown in Figure 4; T was temperature and R was the gas constant.

Reprocessing Properties\nReturning to Figure 4, the LAOS tests showed that the PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks had\nthe reprocessing properties in the presence of Zn(OTf)2. The reprocessing properties were\nfurther demonstrated with the following reprocessing tests. Taking the PHU-PEO1000-\nPSSQ network for instance, the sample was first cropped into small pieces. The cut sam-\nples were then pressed at 120 \u00b0C. Notably, these small pieces were successfully integrated\ninto a sheet without discernable flaws (See Figure 7A), indicating that the PHU-PEO-PSSQ\nnetworks can indeed be reprocessed. To examine the recovery of mechanical properties,\nthe tensile tests were carried out. For the reprocessed specimens, the stress\u2013strain curves\nare presented in in Figure 7B\u2013F.

Notably, these two specimens exhibited quite different relaxation curves, suggesting that the dynamic chemistries in-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 10 of 19\nvolved with both of the samples were quite different. With an identical time, notably, the relaxation of the network without Zn(OTf)2 was much slower than that with Zn(OTf)2. To investigate the effect of the PEO lengths (or contents) on the dynamic exchanges, the stress relaxation tests were carried out for all PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks. Figure 8 shows the stress relaxation curves of the PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks. In all the cases, the stresses can be well relaxed, suggesting that these networks can be indeed reshuffled. Considering that there were two types of dynamic chemistries (i.e., silyl ether metathesis and carbamate transesterification), we extracted the stress relaxation times (\u03c4\u2019s) by using the Kohlrausch\u2013Williams\u2013Watts (KWW) stretched exponential decay function instead of the Maxwell model, which is based on single exponential decay of stress. The KWW function [55,56] is written as below:\nE(t) Eo = exp\n[ \u2212 (\nt \u03c4\u2217\n)\u03b2] (2)\nwhere E(t)/Eo is the normalized modulus at time (t); \u03c4* stands for the characteristic time; \u03b2 represents the stretching exponent characterizing the breadth of relaxation time distribution; the \u03b2 value is between 0 and 1. For \u03b2 = 1, the relaxation is in a single exponent manner. By non-linear curve fitting, we can obtain the \u03c4* and \u03b2 values (Tables S4\u2013S8), which can be used to determine the average relaxation time (\u03c4) using the following equation [57]:\n\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u2217 \u0393\n( 1 \u03b2 ) \u03b2\n(3)\nwhere \u0393 is the gamma function. In this work, we fit the data of stress relaxation tests (Figure 8). The curve fitting is quite well, yielding the average relaxation times (\u03c4) (Tables S4\u2013S8). By using the \u03c4 values, we calculated the apparent activation energy (Ea) values of the dynamic exchanges in the system with Arrhenius equation [58]:\n\u03c4 = Ae \u2212Ea RT (4)\nwhere A and R are the pre-exponential factor and gas constant. For PHU-PEO400-PSSQ, PHU-PEO600-PSSQ, PHU-PEO1000-PSSQ, PHU-PEO2000-PSSQ and PHU-PEO4000-PSSQ, the Ea\u2019s were determined to be 135.6, 144.6, 159.6, 151.3 and 120.6 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121, respectively. Notably, the Ea values displayed the maximum (i.e., Ea = 159.6 kJ\u00b7mol\u22121) for the PHUPEO1000-PSSQ network. It is proposed that there are two opposite factors that affect the Ea values. On the one hand, the Ea values were affected by the crosslinking densities since the crosslinked structures constitute the restriction of the dynamic exchange reactions. The higher the crosslinking densities, the more difficult the dynamic exchange reactions, the higher the Ea values. In this system, the PHU-PEO400-PSSQ network had the highest crosslinking densities among these samples. On the other hand, the dynamic exchange reactions (i.e., the sily ether metathesis and carbamate transesterification) were influenced by the continuity of hydroxyurethane and PSSQ structural units. For the network with the short PEO chains, the structural units remained contiguous, facilitating the dynamic exchanges. With increasing the PEO lengths, the structural units gradually became disconnected or isolated. The discontinuity of hydroxyurethane and PSSQ structural units was unfavorable to the dynamic exchanges. The longer the PEO chains, the more difficult the dynamic exchanges, the higher the Ea values. It is the combination of the above opposite factors that result that PHU-PEO1000-PSSQ network had the highest Ea values among these PHU-PEO-PSSQ networks.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 11 of 19Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW of 19\nFigure 7.

Compared to the networks without LiOTf, the crystallization was also weakened while the lengths of PEO were LPEO = 2000 Da or higher. The fact that the PEO chains no longer crystallized is ascribed to: (i) the restriction of network structure on the crystallization and (ii) the complexation of PEO segments with Li+ ions. The introduction of LiOTf also significantly affected the mechanical properties of the materials. Figure 10 shows the stress\u2013strain curves of the composites.

The improved mechanical strengths are attributable to the increase in the inter-component interactions since the complexation of PEO with Li+ ions have been introduced. Owing to the complexation, the crystallization of PEO chains was further suppressed while the lengths of PEO were LPEO = 2000 Da or higher. As a consequence, the Young\u2019s moduli and strength at break would be slightly decreased due to the decrease in crystallinity of PEO.

Nonetheless, it can be well depicted with Vogel\u2013Tamman\u2013 Fulcher (VTF) equation [59\u201362]:\n\u03c3 = AT\u22121/2 exp[\u2212B/R(T \u2212 T0)] (5)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 15 of 19\nwhere A, B and To are the pre-exponential factor, pseudo-activation energy and the equilibrium glass transition temperature, respectively. This observation suggests that the ionic conductivity was related to the ionic hopping motion, which was coupled with the relaxation/breathing and/or segmental motion of polymer chains. In Equation (5), B was interpreted as the apparent activation energy required to provide suitable free volume for ion conduction [63]. Through non-linear curve fitting with Equation (5), we obtained the A and B values, which are summarized in Table 1. Notably, the B values were dependent on the lengths (or contents) of PEO segments, displaying the minimum (viz. B = 5.82 KJ\u00b7mol\u22121) for PHU-PEO4000-LiOTf. It is proposed that the B values were affected by two opposite factors. On the one hand, the B values increased with the crosslinking densities rising since the crosslinked structures had the restriction on the ionic transport. The higher the crosslinking densities, the lower the electric conductivity. In this case, the crosslinking densities decreased with increasing the length of the PEO chains. As a consequence, the B values displayed a declining tendency with the increase in the PEO lengths. On the other hands, the B values would be significantly affected by the crystallinity of PE chains. The generation of PEO crystals would restrict the ionic transport in the SPEs. The longer the PEO chains, the stronger the tendency of PEO crystallization. The increase in crystallinity of PEO chains would result in the increase in B values. Therefore, the apparent activation energy (B) values reflected the combined contribution of the above two factors (See Table 1). Notably, the B values displayed a monotonous decrease with the increment of the PEO lengths, suggesting that the impact of PEO crystallite was small. In fact, the DSC results showed that the crystallization of PEO was indeed significantly suppressed (Figure 9). It is proposed that the A value in Equation (5) is proportional to the quantities of effective charge carriers. The generation of PEO crystallization and the increased crosslinking densities of the networks would significantly restrict the transport of Li+ ions.\nIt is highly of interest to investigate the impact of the reprocessing properties of the PHU-PEO-LiOTf SPEs on the ionic conductivity while they were used as solid polyelectrolytes. In this work, the solid polyelectrolyte samples were cut into small pieces, which were then hot-pressed into compact ribbons. The reprocessed samples were used for the measurements of the mechanical properties and ionic conductivity. Figure 12 shows the stress\u2013strain curves of the solid polyelectrolyte samples before and after reprocessing. The stress\u2013strain curves of the reprocessed samples were almost the same as the original ones, suggesting their excellent reprocessing properties. At the same time, the ionic conductivity was measured for the reprocessed (or recycled) samples. Figure 11B shows the Nyquist plots for PHU-PEO1000-LiOTf, which was reprocessed twice. The curves of the initial and reprocessed samples almost coincided with each other. The results indicate that the reprocessing did not affect the transport of ions in the composite, i.e., no defects were created with the reprocessing. The reprocessing properties suggest that the SPEs are recyclable.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4634 16 of 19Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 19\nA series of PHU-PEO multiblock copolymers were synthesized via the step-growth\npolymerization of B6CC with NH2-PEO-NH2.
