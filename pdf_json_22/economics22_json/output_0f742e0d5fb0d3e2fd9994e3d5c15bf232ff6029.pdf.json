    "abstractText": "With the rapid development of economy, the discrepancy between regional 3 economy and transportation industry is increasingly prominent for most regions. 4 Coordinated development between regional economy and transportation industry is 5 very important for the sustainable development of cities. This paper utilizes the 6 Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) model and Entropy Method (EM) to 7 quantitatively study the coupling coordination state between regional economy and 8 transportation industry and its spatial distribution of 30 provinces in China from 2004 9 to 2017. The results show that: (1) The comprehensive level of regional economy and 10 transportation industry in China\u2019s have shown a growing trend, and regional economic 11 development is faster than transportation industry development. The economic 12 development scale and transportation scale are the most influential indicators among all 13 indicators. (2) The CCD between regional economy and transportation industry in 14 China is changing from incoordination to high-level coordination, but the improvement 15 speed is slow. The imbalance of CCD levels among regions vary significantly. The CCD 16 in the eastern region is slightly higher than that in the central, western and northeast 17 regions. (3) In the region with a higher CCD, the development discrepancy between the 18 development of regional economy and transportation industry is higher than that in 19 other regions. This study could provide scientific references to stimulate the 20 coordinated development between regional economy and transportation industry, and 21 also to promote sustainable global development. 22",

This paper utilizes the 6 Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) model and Entropy Method (EM) to 7 quantitatively study the coupling coordination state between regional economy and 8 transportation industry and its spatial distribution of 30 provinces in China from 2004 9 to 2017. The results show that: (1) The comprehensive level of regional economy and 10 transportation industry in China\u2019s have shown a growing trend, and regional economic 11 development is faster than transportation industry development. The economic 12 development scale and transportation scale are the most influential indicators among all 13 indicators. (2) The CCD between regional economy and transportation industry in 14 China is changing from incoordination to high-level coordination, but the improvement 15 speed is slow. The imbalance of CCD levels among regions vary significantly. The CCD 16 in the eastern region is slightly higher than that in the central, western and northeast 17 regions. (3) In the region with a higher CCD, the development discrepancy between the 18 development of regional economy and transportation industry is higher than that in 19 other regions. This study could provide scientific references to stimulate the 20 coordinated development between regional economy and transportation industry, and 21 also to promote sustainable global development. 22\nKeywords: Reginal economy; Transportation industry; Coupling coordination degree; 23 Spatial distribution 24\n1 Introduction 25 Regional economy and transportation industry are two important aspects of urban 26 sustainable development. Simultaneously, an inseparable connection exists between 27 regional economy and transportation industry (Vooren, 2004; Limani, 2016; Chunmei, 28 2018). Increasing investment in transportation infrastructure, expanding transportation 29 scale and reducing transportation cost can stimulate the development of economic (Ge 30 et al., 2019; Vooren, 2004). Correspondingly, the economic scale, economic structure 31 and economic development also have noticeably impact on transportation 32\ndevelopment (Maparu and Mazumder, 2017; Tong and Yu, 2018). Thence, realizing the 33 common development between regional economy and transportation industry, and 34 achieving a benign interaction bewteen them will effectively promote the urban 35 sustainable development. 36 Some countries have made efforts to accelerate the development of regional 37 economy and transportation industry. The United States promulgated the \u201cUS Strategic 38 Transportation Plan for FY 2018-2022\u201d to balance the rapid increase in material flow, 39 backward infrastructure and achieve economic sustainability. Since the promulgation 40 of the \u201cFuture Industrial Plan\u201d in 2015, France has continued to promote the 41 transformation of economic growth mode and sustainable transportation development. 42 China proposed the \u201cThe Belt and Road Initiative\u201d in 2015, which includes building an 43 integrated economic zone by strengthening the construction of transportation, network 44 infrastructure, etc. These policies promote the development of economy and 45 transportation industry from the national macro perspective. However, the policies lack 46 of targeted guidance on regional development. Scholars have paid attention to the 47 research on regional economy and transportation industry, and mostly focus on the 48 qualitative analysis of the relationship between them (Ma et al., 2019; Pradhan and 49 Bagchi, 2013; Yang et al., 2019). Only a small part of the research studies has 50 considered the quantitative analysis of its coordination status (Karlaftis, 2004; Yu et al., 51 2019). There is still a gap in the literature regarding the division of the benign 52 interaction level between regional economy and transportation industry (Lan and Zhong, 53 2018), which weakens the contributions to generate strategies in formulating urban 54 plans. 55 The Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) is often used to evaluate the 56 relationship between two systems, which can be adopted to measure the coordination 57 relationship between the regional economy and the transportation industry (Liu et al., 58 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Coupling is the earliest concept in physics, commonly used to 59 express the degree of interaction and mutual influence of two or more systems (Tao, 60 2019). Coordination measures the coordinated development of various elements within 61 a system and reflects the harmony of the system (Li et al., 2020). To promote the 62 coupling coordination of regional economy and transportation industry means that the 63 two systems accomplish common and harmonious development on the basis of 64 interaction. In the context of global sustainable development, the coupling coordination 65 of regional economy and transportation industry is conducive to the recouse allocation 66\nand the overall development of economy and transportation. At the same time, common 67 development of multiple modes of transportation is an important feature of modern 68 transportation industry. Fully will make The evaluation of the transportation system will 69 more accurate considering development disparity of various modes of transportation. 70 This paper utilizes Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) model to quantitative 71 analysis the coordination level between regional economy and the transportation. 72 Meanwhile, the paper subdivides the 6 development stages of coordination between the 73 regional economy and transportation industry. Taking China as the research area, the 74 researchers explored the differences of the coordinated development level of regional 75 economy and transportation industry in 30 provinces from 2004 to 2017. Under global 76 sustainable development background, the paper also provides suggestions for 77 improving coordination and reducing development discrepancy between regional 78 economy and transportation industry. This study is conducive to the realization of 79 benign interaction between regional economy and transportation industry, which lays a 80 foundation for promoting global sustainable development. 81 The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant 82 literature. Section 3 introduces the research area and develops the Coupling 83 Coordination Degree (CCD) Model. Section 4 calculates the comprehensive levels of 84 economic and transportation development of 30 provinces, respectively. The coupling 85 coordination degree and development discrepancy of different provinces are also 86 obtained. Section 5 discusses the reasons of coupling coordination development level 87 and regional differences. The last section presents the conclusions and suggestions. 88\n2 Literature review 89 Existing literature studies the relationship between regional economy and 90 transportation industry from perspectives. As an important relationship between the 91 regional economy and the transportation industry, coordination is evaluated by different 92 methods. The literature review is divided into two parts: (1)Research perspectives of 93 the relationship between regional economy and transportation industry; (2)Research 94 methods of coordination between regional economy and transportation industry. 95\n2.1 Research perspectives of the relationship between regional economy and 96 transportation industry 97 Many scholars have explored the relationship between economy and transportation. 98 Adam Smith, the representative of classical political economic theory, proposed that 99\ntransportation promotes the improvement of economic operation efficiency by 100 promoting social division of labor, and the continuous increase in the level of economic 101 development affects transportation. Afterwards, scholars have conducted multi-level 102 research on the relationship between economy and transportation development from 103 different perspectives. They generally believe that transportation plays a vital role in 104 economic activity either directly. It also as a complement to other factors of production 105 and affects economic activity positively (Pradhan and Bagchi, 2013; Marazzo et al., 106 2010; Chi and Baek, 2013). Most empirical studies show that transportation 107 infrastructure is a necessary condition for social and economic development, and point 108 out the impact of transportation infrastructure construction on economic development 109 (Sun and Cui, 2018; Farhadi, 2015; Arvin et al., 2015). At the same time, there are 110 mutually promoting forces between transportation and economic development. The 111 type and extent of current regional economic development determine the magnitude of 112 the forces. Subsequently, Han and Yang (2000) improved life cycle theory of the 113 transportation economic belt to explaine the basic characteristics and basic laws of the 114 development of the transportation economic belt. They believed that the formation and 115 development of the transportation economic belt played an important role in promoting 116 regional and national economic construction. 117 As a kind of relationship between regional economy and transportation industry, 118 coordination is a key factor to the development between them. There is little research 119 direclty addressing the coordination of regional economy and transportation industry. 120 Some scholars study the relationship between urbanization and transportation 121 development from the perspective of urbanization, from which economy is only one of 122 the factors in evaluating the process of urbanization. They believe that the coordination 123 of new urbanization and sustainable transportation is an effective basis for the 124 comprehensive and sustainable development of urbanization theory (Ma et al., 2019; Li 125 et al., 2015). Other studies have investigated the state of coordination with the economy 126 from a certain aspect of transportation such as transportation infrastructure investment, 127 logistics development, etc. They consider that promoting their coordinated 128 development is helpful to raise the efficiency of urban public transportation 129 infrastructure and guide urban planning and investment scientifically (Sun and Cui, 130 2018; Yang et al., 2019). 131 In the study of transportation coordination, the comprehensive transportation 132 system as the future development goal of the transportation industry has also attracted 133\nattention. Some scholars have studied the low-carbon synergy of transportation modes 134 based on the idea of synergy and evolution. They believe that the low-carbon synergy 135 of China\u2019s transportation system basically tends to zero (Cui et al., 2014). Some 136 researchers used the data envelopment analysis method to evaluate the comprehensive 137 validity of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation system, and concluded that the 138 coordination development of the transportation modes of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei 139 regional transportation system is low (Zhao, 2016). Although studies have shown that 140 the level of comprehensive transportation is relatively low at this stage, the 141 development of comprehensive transportation is an inherent demand and inevitable 142 choice for transportation transformation and upgrading. 143 In conclusion, the current research on coordination relationship rarely directly 144 connects the regional economy with the transportation industry. At the same time, the 145 discrepancy development of multiple modes of transportation is rarely considered in 146 the transportation industry system. With regards to this, this paper directly studies the 147 CCD of regional economy and transportation industry, and fully considers the multiple 148 modes of transportation in the transportation industry system. It can provide more 149 targeted and accurate guidance for the sustainable development of the region. 150\n2.2 Research methods of coordination between regional economy and transportation 151 industry 152 methods have been used to quantitatively study the relevance and coordination of 153 economy and transportation. However, these methods have some shortcomings in 154 studying the coordination level of regional economy and transportation industry. 155 Researchers using the Grey Relation Analysis model analyzed the coordination 156 relationship between the economy and transportation in China (Xu et al., 2010). The 157 results showed the coordination of them is poor, but the development of the 158 transportation system significantly promoted the increase of the index value of the 159 economic system. This method has a strong subjectivity in judging the importance of 160 indicators. Besides, the optimal value of the result is difficult to determine. The 161 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) are used 162 to evaluate the regional economy and transportation industry development and study 163 the coordination degree between them (Tan and Lu, 2015). However, the principal 164 components need to reduce the dimensionality. This will result in distortion of the 165 original meaning of the data, which ultimately results in an unclear comprehensive 166\nevaluation. Some scholars use Tapio Decoupling model to describe the slowing or 167 blocking of the coupling relationship between economic growth and transportation 168 carbon emissions, while the judgment of the coordination level is not clear covered (Xie 169 et al., 2016). 170 The CCD model is used to measure the coordination relationship between multiple 171 systems. It is a mature model and has been widely used in many fields such as exploring 172 the coordination degree of urban economy and logistics development, the coordination 173 degree of urbanization and air environment, ecological environment, etc. (Lan and 174 Zhong, 2018; Lan and Tseng, 2018; Ding et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018). The method can 175 also quantify the development status of system itself. This avoids the occurrence of high 176 synergy but in a low development level, which makes the research results more accurate. 177 This paper chooses the CCD model as the research method to study the coupling 178 coordination relationship between regional economy and transportation industry. At the 179 same time, this study adopts the entropy method combined with the CCD model in the 180 process of raw data standardization, which can greatly reduce the subjectivity and 181 uncertainty of data processing. 182\n3 Methodology 183\n3.1 Study area 184 China is the second largest economy in the world with a population of 1.4 billion 185 at the end of 2019. While China has a vast territory, there are significant differences in 186 the development of transportation in various regions. In recent years, with the rapid 187 development of economy and transportation, problems such as traffic congestion, waste 188 of resources and unbalanced development have appeared. To this end, a new 189 development principle of innovation, coordination, greentech, open-minded and 190 mutural-share has been proposed in China. However, the policies are large coverage 191 and insufficient targeted guidance of different regions development. The lack of 192 reference in formulating coordination policies by regional decision makers leads to 193 problems such as low transportation efficiency and waste of natural resources in the 194 development of regional economy and transportation industry, which restricts the 195 development of them. Therefore, studying the coordination relationship between 196 China\u2019s regional economy and transportation industry and clarifying the coupling 197 coordination degree are necessary. 198\n3.2 Index system design( ) 199\nMeasuring the development level of different systems is the premise of coupling 200 coordination analysis. A reasonable index system is the basis of measuring the CCD 201 accurately. This paper constructs an index system combined with the characteristics of 202 regional economy and transportation industry development. This system contains 8 203 indicators to evaluate the economy comprehensively development and 9 indicators to 204 assess the transportation comprehensively development of 30 provinces, respectively. 205 Existing literature indicates that there exist many index systems to evaluate the 206 development level of economy. Most of them have constructed index systems from 207 industrial structure, economic scale, and economic development efficiency, etc. (Liu et 208 al., 2018; Shi et al., 2020). Based on the existing research, this study evaluates the 209 comprehensive development level of regional economy from following three aspects: 210 economic structure, economic development scale and economic growth rate, and their 211 eight secondary indicators (Table 1). 212 There have some papers constructed an index system for evaluating the 213 performance level of transportation development (Kong et al., 2019; Maparu and 214 Mazumder, 2017). However, the existing studies lack of consideration on the 215 development level of different modes of transportation. Therefore, this study takes the 216 development of different modes of transportation into consideration, which can make 217 the evaluation of transportation development more accurate. Consequently, the index 218 system of transportation system consists of three primary indicators: transportation 219 structure, transportation scale and transportation development efficiency, and nine 220 secondary indicators (Table 2). 221 The performance data of the indexes in Table 1 and Table 2 are collected from 222 China Statistical Yearbook (2004 - 2017), China Regional Statistical Yearbook (2004 - 223 2017) and China Transport Statistical Yearbook (2004-2017). The missing data of 224 individual years were determined by regression model. 225\ndevelopment scale Total investment in fixed assets (Yuan) + 0.2618\nPer capita disposable income (Yuan) + 0.1969 Household consumption level (Yuan) + 0.2107\nEconomic growth rate Per capita GDP growth rate (%) + 0.0258\nFiscal revenue growth rate (%) + 0.0610\n3.3 Data standardization and weight calculation 230\n3.3.1 Data standardization 231 Considering that the raw data are different in dimension and magnitude, this 232 research uses the following equation to standardize the data: 233\nPositive indicator (1)\nNegative indicator (2)\nwhere represents the standardized value of the j-th indicator in year i, 234\nrepresents the value of the j-th indicator in year i; and indicate the 235\nmaximum and minimum values of the j-th indicator in all years, respectively. 236 This paper assumes and represent the indices of regional 237\neconomy and transportation industry; and represent the standardized values 238 of and , which can be calculated by Eq. (1) and (2). The performance degree of 239 the comprehensive is calculated by the Eqs. (3) and (4): 240\n{ } { } { } min ' max min ij j ij j j x x x x x \u00ec -\u00ef= \u00ed -\u00ef\u00ee\n{ } { } { } max ' max min j ij ij j j x x x x x \u00ec -\u00ef= \u00ed -\u00ef\u00ee\n'ijx ijx\n{ }max jx { }min jx\n1 2 pu u u\u2026\u2026 1 2 qv v v\u2026\u2026\n'eu 'tv\neu tv\n(3)\n(4)\nwhere E(u) and T(v) indicate the composite value of regional economy and 241 transportation industry, and are the weight of and , respectively. 242\n3.3.2 Weight calculation 243 The weight of the indicator emphasizes the relative importance of each indicator 244 in the whole system, which is an indispensable part of the coupling coordination model 245 of regional economy and transportation industry. This work determines the weights by 246 the entropy method and the steps to determine these weights are as follows: 247\nThe proportion of the j-th indicator in year i ( ) : (5)\nThe information entropy of the j-th indicator ( ) : (6)\nThe redundancy of information entropy ( ) : (7)\nThe weight of the j-th indicator ( ) : (8)\nwhere m represents the number of years and n represents the number of indicators in a 248 system. 249\n3.4 Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) model 250 In this paper, the interaction between regional economy and transportation industry 251 is measure by CCD model. The formulas are as follows: 252\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\nwhere C is the coupling degree of the regional economy and transportation industry. T 253 indicates the comprehensive evaluation index of the regional economy and 254 transportation industry, D is the coupling coordination degree, which represents the 255\n1 ( ) '\np\ne e e E u w u = =\u00e5\n1 ( ) '\np\nt t t T v wv = =\u00e5\new tw eu tv\nijp\n1\n'\n'\nij ij m\nij i\nxp x =\n= \u00e5\nje 1 ( ln ) ln 1 j ij ij m e p p m i = - \u00b4\u00e5 =\njd 1j jd e= -\njw\n1\nj j n\nj j\ndw d\n=\n=\n\u00e5\n2 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 E u T vC E u T v \u00b4 = +\u00e9 \u00f9 \u00ea \u00fa\u00eb \u00fb\n( ) ( )T E u T va b= +\nD C T= \u00b4\ncoordination level, and . 256\nCoefficient and represents the contributions of E(u) system and T(v) 257\nsystem to the coordination level, and . Most previous studies subjectively 258\ndefined the values of and , and considered that is equal to , i.e., 259\n(Cui et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018). Subjective judgments may cause errors 260\nin the calculations and affect the results. Therefore, this paper uses an improved way to 261\ncalculate and , which can help to eliminate errors and makes the results more 262\nconvincing (Shen et al., 2018). The formulas are as follows: 263\n(12)\n(13)\nAs Table 3 shows, the CCD of regional economy and transportation industry is 264 divided into three different development stages (Incoordination period, Transition 265 period and Highly coordination period) (Zhang and Li, 2020; Liu et al., 2018; Tang, 266 2015).267\n[ ]0,1D\u00ce\na b\n1a b+ =\na b a b\n0.5a b= =\na b\n( ) ( ) ( ) T v E u T v a = +\n( ) ( ) ( ) E u E u T v b = +\n4 Results 279 This paper utilizes the CCD model to evaluate the coordinated status of regional 280 economy and transportation industry in 30 provinces of China. In addition, according 281 to the classification standard of China Statistical Yearbook, 30 provinces of China are 282 divided into four major economic regions (i.e. East, Central, West and Northeast) to 283 conveniently compare the results(Li et al., 2019). The detailed categorization is 284 presented in Table 4. 285\n4.1 The comprehensive levels of regional economy and transportation industry 288\n4.1.1 The weight of each factor 289 This study calculates the weight of each influencing factor by Entropy Method 290 (EM), which can effectively judge the weight of the index and improve the accuracy of 291 the comprehensive development level judgment (Eqs. (4)-(7)). In the regional economy 292 system, the economic development scale accounts for the largest proportion and reaches 293 80.94%, including total investment in fixed assets (26.18%), household consumption 294 level (21.07%), per capita disposable income (19.69%) and GDP per capita (14.00%). 295 Economic structure and economic growth rate account for 10.00% and 9.06%, 296 respectively. In terms of transportation industry, transportation scale, transportation 297 structure and transportation development efficiency account for 55.00%, 36.00% and 298 9.00%, respectively. Among them, the secondary indicators with the greatest impact are 299 operating mileage (27.24%) and transportation infrastructure investment (22.14%). 300\n4.1.2 The comprehensive level of the regional economy and transportation industry 301 The comprehensive level of regional economy and transportation industry have 302 calculated by Eqs. (1)-(3). The calculation results are shown in the Appendix A and 303 Appendix B. Some results can be drawn by comparing the development between 2004 304\nand 2017 in 30 provinces (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). 305\nThe Fig. 1 shows the comprehensive level of the regional economy and 311 transportation industry in the studied provinces in 2004 and 2017. In the regional 312 economy system, the comprehensive level of economic development in 2017 has 313 significantly improved compared to 2004 in all provinces, and the four economic 314 regions are in the different development situation. The east is the most advanced 315 development region, followed by the central and northeast regions, while the economic 316 development in the western region is relatively slow. The current economic 317 development status of different provinces in China can also receive from the data of 318 2017. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong have better 319\ncomprehensive economic level than other regions(>0.5), and these regions belong to 320 the eastern region. The comprehensive economic level of Hainan, Shanxi, Guizhou, 321 Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai Guangxi Ningxia, Xinjiang, Jilin and Heilongjiang are less 322 than 0.3, and most provinces belong to the western region. The comprehensive 323 economic level in other regions are between 0.3-0.5. The above phenomenon shows the 324 current situation of unbalanced economic development in different regions of China. 325 The comprehensive level of transportation in the eastern region is significantly 326 higher than that in others, and the development of provinces in same regions is quite 327 different (Fig. 1). Except Hainan, the comprehensive level of transportation 328 development in 2017 is higher than in 2004 in most provinces. In 2017, Jiangsu, 329 Zhejiang, Guangdong and Shandong have better comprehensive transportation level 330 (>0.4), the comprehensive transportation level in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanghai, 331 Fujian and Hainan are between 0.3-0.4. The comprehensive transportation level of the 332 central region is lower than that of the eastern region, between 0.2-0.3. The results show 333 that there is a large disparity in the level of transportation development among provinces 334 in the western region, with the highest in Shaanxi at 0.347, and only 0.094 in Qinghai. 335 In Northeast China, the transportation level in Jilin and Heilongjiang are both 0.18, 336 while that of Liaoning is 0.31. In short, there are obviously differences in regional 337\ntransportation development.(338\n) 339\nThe average growth rate of the comprehensive development level of regional 340 economy and transportation industry during 2004-2017 are presented in Fig. 2. The 341 average growth rates of regional economy development in most provinces are between 342 8%-12%, which means that the economy is at an increasing development level. 343 However, there are significant differences in the average growth rate of transportation 344 development in different provinces. Shaanxi has the highest growth rate of 13.44%, 345 while Hainan\u2019s growth rate is -0.48%. The average growth rates of transportation 346 development in most provinces are between 1%-10% and greater than zero. 347 Through comparing the comprehensive level of regional economy and 348 transportation industry, it could be known that: although both the development level of 349 regional economy and transportation industry have been continuously improved, there 350 is a large disparity in the development speed and current state of both. In 2004, the 351 comprehensive level of the regional economy and transportation industry were at a 352\nsimilar state, and the transportation level in some areas was higher than the economy. 353 But in 2017, the level of regional economy is obviously higher than that of 354 transportation, which shows that China\u2019s comprehensive transportation development is 355 relatively lagging behind the economy. 356\n4.2 Coupling coordination degree of regional economy and transportation industry 357\n4.2.1 The average level of the coupling coordination degree 358\n4.2.2 The CCD between regional economy and transportation industry 369\ncoordination and above accounted for the majority, and the overall development was on 383 the rise. (c) From a spatial point of view, as the geographic location changes from the 384 inland to coastal, the coordination status of regional economy and transportation 385 industry gradually increase. In general, the coupling coordination statuses between 386 regional economy and transportation industry of all provinces evolved from 387 incoordination to high-level coordination during the surveyed period. 388\n4.2.3 Regional economy and transportation industry development discrepancy 389\nThe development discrepancy between regional economy and transportation 392 industry can evaluate whether the two are developing simultaneously (Fig. 5) (Zhang 393 and Li, 2020; Liu et al., 2018; Tang, 2015). The results show that from 2004 to 2017, 394 the development discrepancy between the two systems was growing, but the disparity 395 in most provinces was still within 0.15. Especially in 2004 there was no difference 396 greater than 0.15. In addition, the E (u) -T (v)> 0 and T (v) -E (u)> 0 coexists 397 simultaneously. By 2017, there are no cases where T(v)>E(u) in 2017. The difference 398 in individual provinces is relatively large, Jiangsu and Tianjin are 0.23 and 0.24 399 respectively, and Beijing and Shanghai have reached 0.33, indicating that the economy 400 of these regions is at an advanced level. The development discrepancy only in 401 Guangdong, Shaanxi and Liaoning is close to zero, which indicates that the regional 402 economy and transportation industry level in these areas are approach. 403\n5 Discussions 404\n5.1 Analysis the comprehensive level of regional economy and transportation industry 405\n5.1.1 The analysis of main influencing factors 406 The main influencing factors can be obtained by analyzing the weight of the index 407 system. In terms of regional economy, the economic development scale is the key factor 408 to promote the economic development in China, which is consistent with the current 409 actual development situation (see Table 1 and Table 2). The expansion of economic 410 scale is a prerequisite for high-quality economic development, which can increase 411 returns to scale and thereby achieve higher per capita economic output (Zhao et al., 412 2016). In terms of transportation industry, a significant observation in this paper is that 413 transportation structure accounted for the highest factor ( 44%).It shows that the 414 coordinated development of multiple transportation modes has a non-negligible impact 415 on the development of transportation system. This conclusion is in line with the ultimate 416 goal of China\u2019s transportation policy: development the comprehensive transportation. 417\n5.1.2 The analysis of the comprehensive level of regional economy and transportation 418 industry 419 From Fig. 1 and Fig.2, we can know that although the development level of 420 China\u2019s regional economy and transportation industry continue to rise, the development 421 quality is low. Therefore, it is necessary to effective improve the development quality 422 of regional economy and transportation industry. The average annual growth rate of 423 China\u2019s economy over the past 30 years is close to 10%, and the world share of GDP 424 has rapidly increased from 2.7% to nearly 15% at present. Nevertheless, the problems 425 such as imbalanced urban and rural development and excessive consumption of natural 426 resources have appeared, which may be related to the allocation of urban and rural 427 resources and the lack of green development concepts. Therefore, it is necessary to 428 promote moderate transfer of resourcesto township areas to realize the linkage 429 development of urban and rural areas. At the same time, we must establish the 430 development concept of coexistence of economy and ecological environment protection 431 to achieve sustainable development. 432 In terms of transportation industry, the rapid development of the transportation 433 industry is mainly reflected in the substantial increase in transportation mileage and 434 volume. From 2008 to 2018, the total mileage of various transportation routes (except 435\naviation) increased from 4.0196 million kilometers to 5.3198 million kilometers, a 436 growth rate of 32.36%. Passenger turnover increased from 2319.67 billion person-437 kilometers to 3241.82 billion person-kilometers, a growth rate of 39.75%; and freight 438 turnover increased by 85.57%. However, it brings problems such as low transportation 439 efficiency, high transportation cost and waste of transportation resources, which are 440 inconsistent with the green and low-carbon development goals of the transportation 441 industry. At present, the total amount of transportation CO2 emissions is showing a rapid 442 growth trend (Du et al., 2020). Only by adopting strong policies and measures can it be 443 possible to peak carbon emissions around 2030 (Mahmoudi et al., 2019). To this end, 444 the Chinese governmenthas promulgated the Outline of Building a Powerful Country 445 for Transportation to promote sustainable and high-quality development of the 446 transportation industry. 447 Fig. 1 and Fig.2 reveal that the development of the eastern region is superior to 448 other regions in both economic system and transportation system. This is closely related 449 to the special geographical location of the eastern region. Eastern cities near the ocean 450 and have a gentle terrain, which can provide good conditions for industrial and 451 agricultural development. Other regions especially the western regions are remote areas 452 and ethnic minorities, with vast areas and sparse populations. Its relatively backward 453 economic and transportation conditions eventually led to unbalanced regional 454 development. At the same time, it is may related to the coexistence of aging and 455 urbanization in Chinese cities. China\u2019s urbanization rate has risen from 26.41% in the 456 1990s to 59.58% in 2018, and the proportion of people over 65 years of age has risen 457 from 5.57% in 1990 to 11.9% in 2018 (Kai, 2020). The aging population has reduced 458 the labor productivity of society, the large-scale movement of youth labor to cities and 459 developed regions will exacerbate the imbalance of regional development. 460\n5.2 Analysis of coupling coordination degree 461\n5.2.1 The analysis of average level of the coupling coordination degree in China 462 Fig. 3 analyzes the average level of the coupling coordination degree between 463 regional economy and transportation industry in China. The result shows that the CCD 464 between regional economy and transportation industry is rising. It reflects the 465 deepening of the interaction between economic and transportation systems and 466 increasing coordination. The increase in the construction of regional transportation 467 infrastructure has promoted the development of the local transportation industry and 468\nboosted the local GDP (Farhadi, 2015). At the same time, the regional economic growth 469 will increase the demand for transportation capacity, which could improve the 470 transportation structure optimization within regions (Ng et al., 2017). Thus, the 471 government planning needs to continue to strengthen the benign interaction between 472 them in the future. 473\n5.2.2 The analysis of the coupling coordination degree between regional economy and 474 transportation industry 475 From spatial distribution of coupling coordination status between regional 476 economy and transportation industry in China, the coupling coordination status of all 477 provinces is evolving from Incoordination to High-level coordination. However, the 478 CCD of the regional economy and transportation industry in different regions is uneven. 479 The state of coordination across the country gradually decreases from east to west. The 480 eastern region is in the best state of coordination. The central and northeastern regions 481 have the same CCD, and the western region has the lowest CCD. In other words, 482 although the regional economy and transportation industry is also developing, the 483 degree of coordination is not high. 484 There are many reasons for this result. First, eastern region has a wealth of 485 resources and high population density. Its economic development is at the leading level 486 in the country, so this region has higher requirements for the transportation industry. 487 Moreover, most of the eastern provinces are coastal, which have well-developed 488 aviation and water transport. Lots of passenger and freight transportation are used to 489 meet people\u2019s living needs and commodity circulation, which provides impetus for 490 economic development. There is still a large disparity between the development of the 491 central and northeastern regions compared with the eastern region. In terms of 492 transportation, the central and northeastern regions have not yet formed a 493 comprehensive transportation network. The connection between various transportation 494 modes is not strong enough. Therefore, the transportation in terms of operation or 495 planning needs to be improved. Moreover, compared with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei 496 and Yangtze River Delta Economic Zones in eastern, the central and northeast are 497 currently just a regional concept and have not formed a complete economic zone. This 498 has resulted in relatively independent development between regions, with a low degree 499 of integration. The Western region has the lowest level of coordination. Due to the 500 complex terrain and changing climate in the west, the transportation infrastructure 501\nconstruction has a longer period than other regions, which ultimately leads to the slow 502 development of the transportation industry. In addition, the relative scarcity of resources 503 and the insufficient construction of transportation infrastructure have also limited 504 economic development, which is one of the important reasons for the low CCD between 505 regional economy and transportation industry in Western region. 506\n5.2.3 The analysis of the regional economy and transportation industry development 507 discrepancy 508 Based on the analysis of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we found that the CCD in the eastern 509 region is higher. The development disparity between regional economy and 510 transportation industry is higher than in other regions. This phenomenon is most 511 prominent in Beijing and Shanghai, which means the development of the transportation 512 industry in Beijing and Shanghai has a significant hysteresis relative to the economic 513 development. Beijing and Shanghai have good primitive economic foundations 514 supported by resources and political factors. This advantage has been continuously 515 exerted to make economic development more rapid. Nevertheless, economic 516 development requires strong support from the transportation industry. Therefore, the 517 transportation in Beijing and Shanghai has developed rapidly. However, some complex 518 contradictions such as traffic congestion and low transportation efficiency have 519 emerged. The probably reason is the urban planning and transportation planning are 520 disconnect, which ultimately leads to the unsatisfactory CCD. For example, Beijing has 521 made some huge progress in the construction of a mass transit-based public 522 transportation system. However, Beijing is experiencing problems with the poor 523 management of population, urban and rural land use and vehicle ownership beyond the 524 overall planning control indicators. As a result, the supply-demand relationship of 525 transportation is seriously unbalanced, and diseases in large cities, which are 526 represented by urban traffic congestion, are becoming increasingly serious (Zhang, 527 2016). 528 In comparison, the development disparity between regional economy and 529 transportation industry in Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Liaoning are close to zero, 530 indicating that the two systems are in a similar state of development. Guangdong has 531 the smallest development disparity and the highest CCD. As the largest province in 532 China\u2019s GDP, Guangdong\u2019s huge export scale and port throughput have provided an 533 indispensable support for its economic development. The study found that for every 10% 534\nincrease in the throughput of Guangdong ports, the GDP of the region increased 5% 535 (Xie, 2014). At the same time, Guangzhou is also a hub port for the 21st Century 536 Maritime Silk Road, which also facilitates local economic development. Xi\u2019an is the 537 political, economic, cultural and transportation hub center of Northwest China. The rich 538 tourism resources and the wide coverage transportation network not only made 539 tremendous contributions to the development of economy and transportation in Shaanxi, 540 but also promote the development of other cities in Shaanxi. Liaoning is a major part 541 of Northeast Revitalization. At present, Liaoning has formed a high road grid bureau 542 with highways as its main skeleton and a number of provincial, county, and village 543 roads that are closely connected. The construction of ports including Dalian Port, 544 Yingkou Port and Dandong Port make breakthrough progress. Passenger and freight 545 transport capacity have been greatly improved. Based on this, although the regional 546 economy and transportation industry development of Shaanxi and Liaoning are not at 547 the leading level, but similar development conditions makes them have a higher 548 coordination state. 549 In general, China\u2019s the regional economy development is usually faster than 550 transportation development. However, this seems to be different from some current 551 research results. Shen (2019) studied the coupling state of county-level highway traffic 552 and economic development in Anhui Province, and obtained the concluded that the 553 development of highway transportation in most counties (cities) is ahead of economic 554 development. Meng (2012) studied the spatial coupling between transportation 555 superiority and economy in Central plain economic zone. They believed that 556 transportation infrastructure has developed ahead of schedule, but it did not fully play 557 its role in supporting economic development. However, our research takes multiple 558 modes of transportation as the research object, which is different with previous research. 559 Therefore, the existing research differences also fully illustrate that although a separate 560 transportation may be at a relatively good level of development, the coordinated 561 development of China\u2019s multiple modes of transportation system is not perfect. Thus, 562 the government needs to pay more attention on researching and planning. 563\n6 Conclusions and policy implication 564 In the context of sustainable development, studies the CCD between the regional 565 economy and transportation industry are critical for guiding transportation policy-566 making and high-quality economic development strategies. This study has evaluated 567\nthe CCD between regional economy and transportation industry and analyzed the 568 development disparity between the two systems. In addition, the CCD model and 569 Entropy Method was used to quantitatively study the coordination relationship and 570 spatial distribution between regional economy and transportation industry. Some results 571 are obtained as follows: 572 First, China\u2019s regional economy and transportation industry are growing fast but 573 lack of quality. In the economic development system, the economic development scale 574 is the most influential indicator, and large-scale economic development can promote 575 economic growth. In the transportation development system, the scale of transportation 576 is the greatest impact indicators. Increasing transportation volume and infrastructure 577 investment will help enhance regional competitiveness. 578 Second, the coordination status between regional economy and transportation 579 industry in China is complex. Its CCD growth trend is changing from incoordination to 580 High-level coordination, but the growth rate is slower. The imbalance of CCD levels 581 between regions is significant. The CCD in the eastern region is slightly higher than 582 that in the central, western and northeast regions. 583 Finally, we found that regional economic development is faster than transportation 584 industry development, and each province have development disparity. Simultaneously, 585 the development disparity of the four economic zones also have their own 586 characteristics. In the eastern region with a higher CCD, the development discrepancy 587 between economic development and transportation development is higher than that in 588 other regions. 589 Based on the above findings, this study makes the following recommendations to 590 promote the coordination relationship between regional economy and transportation 591 industry: 592\nFirst of all, it is necessary to improve the development quality of the regional 593 economy and transportation industry. While expanding the scale of production and 594 operations, we must incorporate emerging technologies into development plans. 595 Integrate smart operation and maintenance, smart construction, new infrastructure 596 and other technologies into construction and development. In addition, strengthen 597 the connection between various modes of transportation to ensure the construction 598 of a comprehensive transportation system. This will promote the high quality and 599 sustainable development of the economy and transportation. 600\nSecondly, it is essential to balance the CCD level of each region. It is necessary to 601 give full play to the advantages of urban agglomerations and realize the leading 602 role of priority development areas. Since the advantages of different regions are 603 different, strengthening the construction of urban agglomerations and clarifying 604 the positioning and characteristics of regional development. In this way, various 605 regions can complement each other's advantages and reduce the waste of resources 606 caused by blind investment and construction. In addition, the transportation 607 planning and the city planning departments communicate in a timely manner when 608 formulating development plans and policies, useless lines should not be built to 609 increase operational mileage, lest economic and transportation development be 610 separated. 611\nThe third point is to narrow the development gap between the regional economy 612 and the transportation industry through the rational allocation of resources. The 613 first is the rational allocation of transportation resources (including human, 614 material and financial resources). Reasonable transportation resource allocation 615 can increase investment in transportation infrastructure and strengthen the overall 616 function of the regional transportation system. The new demand for production 617 factors will drive the development of related industries, thus stimulate the growth 618 of the regional economic aggregate. Moreover, based on ensuring the development 619 conditions of priority regions, we will appropriately tilt resources to backward 620 regions. This can ensure that the development of infrastructure in backward areas 621 is promoted as soon as possible. 622 This article focuses on the coordination development levels of regional economy 623 and transportation industry. Although this article considers the differences of various 624 transportation modes in the indicators, the accuracy of its measurement is limited. The 625 application of emerging technologies in the future will continue to increase the 626 complexity of the transportation industry. In this context, how to define the internal 627 relationship between economy and transportation and rebuild the evaluation system will 628 be the focus of research. 629\nReferences 630 Arvin, M.
