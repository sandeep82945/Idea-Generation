 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further optimize the dissection sites of the new ALucs for creating more sensitive split luciferase probes. The paper showed some initial attempts at creating split ALuc probes, but the signal enhancements were modest. Further optimizing the split sites could lead to more sensitive PCA probes. 

2. Explore combining the new red-shifted ALucs with near-infrared fluorescent proteins as a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) pair. The red-shifted light emission could allow deeper tissue imaging when paired with a near-IR fluorescent acceptor.

3. Engineer the new ALucs for improved stability and brightness through further mutagenesis studies. There is room to enhance the enzymatic properties of the new ALucs.

4. Develop ALuc-based biosensors for detecting different protein-protein interactions or signaling events. The modularity of the new ALucs allows creating reporters for different molecular interactions. 

5. Apply the new ALucs as reporters in mammalian cells and model organisms. The paper demonstrated feasibility in cells, but further in vivo imaging studies could demonstrate broader utility.
