 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings in this paper:

1. Further explore the structure-activity relationships of crossoseamine A and B analogs to optimize their anticancer and antiprotozoal activities. Modifications could include changes to the eudesmane core, proline moiety, and substitutions on the rings. 

2. Investigate the mechanisms of action of crossoseamines A and B against cancer cells and parasites. This could involve evaluating effects on signaling pathways, cell cycle, apoptosis, metabolism, etc. 

3. Explore the biosynthesis of crossoseamines A and B in Crossostephium chinense using labeling studies and enzyme assays to identify the key enzymes involved. This could enable production of analogs through engineering the biosynthetic pathway.

4. Evaluate crossoseamines A and B in combination therapies with existing anticancer and antiparasitic drugs to examine synergistic effects and combat drug resistance.

5. Perform in vivo efficacy studies of lead crossoseamine analogs in animal models of cancer, leishmaniasis, malaria, and trypanosomiasis to further evaluate their therapeutic potential. Pharmacokinetic analysis would also inform translational development.
