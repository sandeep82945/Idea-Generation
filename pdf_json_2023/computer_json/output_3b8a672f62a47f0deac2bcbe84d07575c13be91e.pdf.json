PyBCI addresses these challenges by providing a flexible, Python-based platform aimed at researchers and developers in the BCI domain. Assuming a foundational understanding of Python, the software serves as a comprehensive solution for both academic and industry professionals.\nDesigned to be lightweight and user-friendly, PyBCI emphasizes quick customization and integrates seamlessly with the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) for data acquisition and labeling (Kothe et al., 2023). The platform incorporates reputable machine learning libraries like PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015), and Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), as well as feature extraction tools such as Antropy (Vallat, 2023), NumPy (Oliphant, 2006), and SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020). This integration allows users to focus more on their research and less on software development. While a detailed comparison with other software solutions will follow in the \u2018State of the Field\u2019 section, PyBCI sets itself apart through its emphasis on ease of use and technological integration."

Notable packages include solutions like OpenViBE (Renard et al., 2010) and BCI2000 (Schalk et al., 2004) that offer ease of use for those without programming expertise. BciPy (Memmott et al., 2021), another Python-based platform, provides some level of customization but does not allow for the easy integration of popular machine learning libraries. In contrast, PyBCI offers seamless integration with a variety of machine learning libraries and feature extraction tools. This flexibility makes PyBCI a robust choice for researchers seeking a tailored, code-based approach to their BCI experiments.\nBooth et al. (2023).

            "text": "PyBCI accelerates the pace of BCI research by streamlining data collection, processing, and model analysis. It uses the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) to handle data acquisition and labelling, allowing for real-time, synchronous data collection from multiple devices (Kothe et al., 2023). Samples are collected in chunks from the LSL data streams and stored in pre-allocated NumPy arrays. When in training mode based on a configurable time window before and after each marker type. When in test mode, data is continuously processed and analysed based on the global epoch timing settings. For feature extraction, PyBCI leverages the power of NumPy (Oliphant, 2006), SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020), and Antropy (Vallat, 2023), robust Python libraries known for their efficiency in handling numerical operations. Machine learning, a crucial component of BCI research, is facilitated with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), SciKit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015). Scikit-learn offers a wide range of traditional algorithms for classification, including things like regression, and clustering, while TensorFlow and PyTorch provide comprehensive ecosystems for developing and training bespoke deep learning machine learning models."

When integrated with off-the-shelf devices that are LSL-enabled, as well as with pre-built LSL data viewers and marker delivery systems, PyBCI facilitates the efficient design, testing, and implementation of advanced BCI experiments.The integration of LSL, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Antropy, NumPy, and SciPy into one platform simplifies the research process, encouraging innovation and collaboration in the field of brain computer/human machine interfaces."
