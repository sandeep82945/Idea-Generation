We conduct an experimental study on the lasing dynamics of Limac\u0327onshaped semiconductor microcavities. The edge emission exhibits intensity fluctuations over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. They result from multiple dynamic processes with different origins and occurring on different spatio-temporal scales. The dominant process is an alternate oscillation between two output beams with a period as short as a few nanoseconds.\nDielectric microdisk cavities are widely exploited for modern optoelectronic devices due to their strong confinement of light by total internal reflection. Long photon lifetimes in circular disks lead to high quality (Q) factors and low lasing thresholds, but the isotropic emission results in poor collection efficiency [1]. Directional output and improved light extraction can be achieved with deformed disks [1\u20133]. Among the microdisk geometries that have been explored, the Limac\u0327on cavity has the advantage of combining unidirectional emission and high-Q factor [4]. There have been many experimental and theoretical studies of the far-field emission pattern [5\u201313] and the mechanism for the formation of high-Q resonances in the Limac\u0327on-shaped microcavities in which the classical ray dynamics is predominantly chaotic [14\u201316]. However, most of these studies are focused on the static properties of cavity resonances and steady-state lasing emission.\nDespite the potential of the Limac\u0327on-shaped microdisk laser as a highly efficient on-chip light source, its temporal dynamics has not yet been studied. For edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, the resonator geometry can have a profound impact on the lasing dynamics [17, 18]. Carefully designed cavity shapes for semiconductor quantumwell lasers can suppress the intrinsic spatio-temporal instabilities [19\u201321] and control the nonlinear light-matter interactions [22].\nIn this work, we experimentally investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of Limac\u0327on-shaped microdisk lasers. We observe highly multimode lasing under electrical pumping of a GaAs quantum-well. The interactions of many lasing modes and the gain material result in multiple dynamic processes such as anti-phase oscillations, temporal instabilities, and spatio-temporal mode beating. These processes have distinct spatial and temporal scales and coexist in a single cavity. Among them, the dominant process in the Limac\u0327on laser is the anticorrelated oscillation of two output beams, with oscillation periods as short as a few nanoseconds. For compar-\n\u2217 hui.cao@yale.edu\nison, the lasing dynamics in an elliptic microcavity with integrable ray dynamics is dominated by filament-like instabilities.\nThe Limac\u0327on boundary is given in polar coordinates by r(\u03b8) = R(1 + \u03b5 cos \u03b8), where R is the radius and \u03b5 is the deformation parameter. We choose \u03b5 = 0.42 to obtain high-Q modes in a GaAs microdisk with unidirectional output [4\u20136]. Figure 1(a) is the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a Limac\u0327on-shaped disk with R = 86 \u00b5m. It is fabricated with a commercial GaAs/AlGaAs quantum-well wafer (Q-Photonics QEWLD-808) by photolithography and inductively coupled plasma etching [21]. Top and bottom metal contacts are deposited for electric current injection (See Supplement 1).\nIn spite of chaotic ray dynamics in the Limac\u0327on cavity, high-Q modes can be formed by scarring on unstable periodic orbits and dynamic localization [4, 7, 14]. Figure 1(b) shows the spatial intensity distribution of a high-Q mode with transverse-electric (TE) polarization, obtained by numerical simulation of a Limac\u0327on disk with R = 8.6 \u00b5m. Similar to the whispering gallery (WG) modes in a circular cavity, the high-Q resonance stays close to the Limac\u0327on cavity boundary but has a more complex structure due to the chaotic ray dynamics. In phase space, the high-Q modes are concentrated in the region confined by total internal reflection, leading to long lifetimes. Eventually, light will reach the leaky region with an incident angle on the boundary below the critical angle. As light leaves the cavity via refraction, the escape route is dictated by the unstable manifolds of the chaotic saddle in phase space, producing two output beams in a single direction, as shown in Fig. 1(b).\nTo investigate the effect of ray dynamics on lasing dynamics, we fabricate elliptic microdisks with integrable ray dynamics on the same wafer. Figure 1(c) shows an elliptic disk with the major (minor) axis length b = 254 \u00b5m (a = b/2 = 127 \u00b5m). Its area is identical to that of the Limac\u0327on disk. The high-Q resonances in an elliptic cavity are whispering-gallery modes formed by total internal reflection [23\u201325].

(b,d) Numerically calculated high-Q modes in both cavities. They concentrate near the cavity boundaries, and total internal reflection leads to strong optical confinement. The mode in the Limac\u0327on cavity (b) has two major output beams in the same direction. In the elliptic cavity (d), evanescent tunneling is strongest at the points with the smallest radius of curvature, producing four output beams in two directions.\n25.4 \u00b5m. It is a WG mode with well-defined radial and azimuthal quantum numbers. Light leaks via tunneling at the curved boundary. The tunneling rate is highest at the smallest radius of curvature. Thus, the emission is strongest at the two vertices [Fig. 1(d)], leading to four output beams in two opposite directions.\nWe achieve lasing of both Limac\u0327on and elliptic microdisks at room temperature by electrical pumping. To reduce heating, the electric current pulses are only 2 \u00b5s long (See Supplement 1). The lasing threshold current is 80 mA for both Limac\u0327on and elliptic cavities. Below we present data taken at a pump current of 500 mA. Figure 2 (right panels) shows the time-integrated emission spectra centered at wavelength 805 nm. For both Limac\u0327on and elliptic microdisk lasers, the emission spectra contain many peaks, indicating highly multimode lasing. The left panels of Fig. 2 are time-gated emission spectra measured by an intensified CCD camera. Due to the heating effect, the lasing spectra redshift, and some existing peaks disappear while new ones appear. Spectral decorrelation occurs on the time scale of 30-40 ns (See Supplement 1). The lasing spectra contain multiple peaks at any moment, confirming simultaneous lasing of multiple modes in both Limac\u0327on and elliptic cavities.\nNext, we study the spatio-temporal dynamics of laser emission using a streak camera (See Supplement 1). Figure 3(a) shows the time-resolved near-field intensity pro-\nfile of a Limac\u0327on-shaped microdisk laser. It features two dominant output beams, as expected from the output of high-Q modes [Fig. 1(b)]. Both beam intensities fluctuate in time on multiple scales. The time traces (inset) reveal rapid oscillations on top of a slow-varying background. Within the first 5 ns time window, the beams at the position x > 0 is stronger than the other beam at x < 0, but in the next 5 ns, the x < 0 beam becomes stronger than the x > 0 beam.\nTo separate dynamic processes of different spatiotemporal scales, we perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) (equivalent to a Karhunen-Loeve decomposition [26]) of the measured intensity fluctuations. Consider a streak image I(x, t), after normalization \u3008I(x, t)\u3009x,t = 1, we compute the time-averaged intensity \u3008I(x, t)\u3009t at each spatial location x, then obtain the spatially-resolved intensity fluctuation in time \u03b4I(x, t) = I(x, t)\u2212 \u3008I(x, t)\u3009t. The SVD of \u03b4I(x, t) yields the decomposition \u03b4I(x, t) = \u2211 \u03b1 s\u03b1u\u03b1(x)v\u03b1(t), where s\u03b1 is the singular value, and u\u03b1(x) and v\u03b1(t) denote spatial and temporal singular vectors, respectively. The singular value represents the contribution of the corresponding singular vector to the intensity fluctuation. The lower the index \u03b1, the larger the singular value s\u03b1, and the more dominant the singular vector u\u03b1(x)v\u03b1(t). Each singular vector has its own characteristic scales in space and time. The spatial scale is given by the correlation length l\u03b1, which is defined as the full-width-at-halfmaximum (FWHM) of the spatial correlation function for u\u03b1(x) [21]. Correspondingly, the temporal scale is the correlation time \u03c4\u03b1 given by the FWHM of the tem-\n3\nporal correlation function for v\u03b1(t).\nThe SVD effectively separates a variety of spatial and temporal scales of the laser intensity fluctuations. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the singular vectors feature a wide range of correlation times \u03c4\u03b1 and lengths l\u03b1. The most dominant singular vector is denoted as (i). It has \u03c4i = 3.1 ns and li = 17 \u00b5m, which are much larger than the spatial and temporal scales of other singular vectors. The corresponding singular vector ui(x)vi(t) exhibits anti-correlated intensity oscillations of two output beams.\nThe next dominant singular vector (ii) displays more rapid fluctuations in space and time. It has \u03c4ii = 0.13 ns and lii = 2.8 \u00b5m. The two major output beams break into finer streaks of a few microns, resembling filaments in an edge-emitting semiconductor laser [21]. The subnanosecond fluctuation time is very similar to that of irregular pulsations induced by filamentation in a GaAs quantum-well laser [19, 27, 28]. Such spatio-temporal\ndynamics is therefore attributed to lasing instabilities caused by nonlinear light-matter interaction.\nThe majority of singular vectors have even shorter spatial and temporal scales. Since their singular values are small, individual contributions to intensity fluctuations are weak. We show two examples, (iii) and (iv) in Fig. 3(c). The spatial profile of the singular vector (iii) resembles the emission pattern of the Limac\u0327on with two output beams, thus it originates from lasing emission. Its \u03c4iii and liii are 33 ps and 0.72 \u00b5m, close to the temporal and spatial resolution of our photo-detection system. According to our previous studies [20], the spatio-temporal profile of (iii) results from the interference of multiple lasing modes in space and time. Lastly, the singular vector (iv) spreads uniformly over the entire spatio-temporal domain of detection and has the correlation scales of a single camera pixel. Hence, it corresponds to photodetection noise [21].\nFigure 3 illustrates the SVD is a powerful tool for analyzing spatio-temporal processes of different origins. However, the singular vectors in Fig. 3(b) are extracted from a single 10 ns long streak image. A lot more sampling is needed for a statistical analysis of the overall lasing dynamics. To this end, we perform the SVD of many streak images taken with multiple devices. Within a 2 \u00b5s long pump pulse, 161 consecutive 10 ns long streak images are taken from 0.3 to 1.9 \u00b5s. The measurements are repeated with five cavities of the same geometry fabricated on the same wafer. We perform the SVD of 161 \u00d7 5 = 805 streak images in total and combine the results.\nFigure 4(a) shows correlation times \u03c4\u03b1 and correlation lengths l\u03b1 of all singular vectors of five Limac\u0327on-shaped microdisk lasers. The color denotes the magnitude of singular value s\u03b1. The singular vectors can be classified into four categories, as represented by (i) - (iv) in Fig. 3(c). The singular vectors with the largest s\u03b1 have \u03c4\u03b1 of a few nanoseconds and l\u03b1 from a few to tens of micrometers. Their spatio-temporal profiles resemble the singular vector (i) in Fig. 3. In addition, a small number of singular vectors with sub-nanosecond \u03c4\u03b1 have large singular values, and their profiles are similar to the singular vector (ii) in Fig. 3.\nFor comparison, we repeat the spatio-temporal measurement and SVD analysis with five elliptic microdisk lasers [Fig. 1(c)]. In contrast to the case of Limac\u0327onshaped microlasers, the strongest singular vectors belong to category (ii) with \u03c4\u03b1 of sub-nanoseconds and l\u03b1 of a few micrometers as shown in Fig. 4(b). They result from filament-like spatio-temporal instabilities, which dominate the lasing dynamics in elliptic cavities. Comparison to Limac\u0327on-shaped lasers reveals an order-of-magnitude difference in the most-significant spatial and temporal scales of emission intensity fluctuations, illustrating the profound impact of cavity geometry on lasing dynamics.\nTo further characterize the dominant dynamic process in Limac\u0327on-shaped microdisk lasers, we investigate the correlation of intensity oscillations between the two out-\n4 0.01 0.1 1 1 10 C or re la tio n le ng th (\u03bc m ) 1 10 0.01 0.1 1 (a) 102\n101 Si ng\nul ar\nv al\nue\n(b)\nCorrelation time (ns)Correlation time (ns)\nC or\nre la\ntio n\nA \u03b1\n-1\n0\n1\n0.01 0.1 1 0.01 0.1 1\n(c)\n-1\n0\n1 (d)\nFIG. 4.

For individual spatio-temporal singular vectors u\u03b1(x) v\u03b1(t), temporal variations at different locations are either in phase or out of phase, leading to positive or negative correlations. We introduce the correlation for the \u03b1-th singular vector as\nA\u03b1 = \u3008[u\u03b1(x)\u2212 \u3008u\u03b1(x)\u3009][u\u03b1(\u2212x)\u2212 \u3008u\u03b1(\u2212x)\u3009]\u3009\u221a \u3008[u\u03b1(x)\u2212 \u3008u\u03b1(x)\u3009]2\u3009\u3008[u\u03b1(\u2212x)\u2212 \u3008u\u03b1(\u2212x)\u3009]2\u3009 ,\n(1) where \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 denotes the spatial average over x > 0 only. Figure 4(c) shows A\u03b1 for singular vectors of Limac\u0327on microdisk lasers. The most significant singular vectors with \u03c4\u03b1 >\u223c 1 ns mostly have negative correlations A\u03b1 < 0, manifesting anti-phase oscillations between the two output beams from Limac\u0327on cavities. In the elliptic microdisk lasers, however, the singular vectors of similar \u03c4\u03b1 do not exhibit any bias towards negative correlations, indicating the absence of alternate oscillations between output beams.\nWe attribute the anti-correlated oscillations of the Limac\u0327on lasers to temporal beating of nearly degenerate modes. These modes interact nonlinearly through the gain medium, leading to their phase locking [17, 18, 29, 30]. When two lasing modes with slightly different frequencies and different mirror symmetry are phase-locked, their temporal beating causes anti-phased intensity oscillations of the output beams. The oscillation period is on\nthe order of a few nanoseconds, which is much shorter than that of >\u223c 100 ns in quasi-stadium cavities [17, 18]. To check whether anti-phase oscillations also occur with a longer period in Limac\u0327on cavities, we increase the time window of a streak image from 10 ns to 50 ns. The SVD analysis reveals alternate oscillations with period \u2265 10 ns (See Supplement 1). On even longer time scales, thermal effects become dominant, turning on or off lasing modes (Fig. 2).\nCompared to Limac\u0327on microdisk lasers, subnanosecond intensity fluctuations due to filament-like instabilities are more pronounced in elliptic cavities. One possible explanation is that WG modes in an elliptic cavity have a well-defined direction of propagation along the boundary. A small transverse wavevector (perpendicular to the local propagation direction) corresponds to a large transverse wavelength. Intensity variation on such length scales can induce lensing and self-focusing via carrier-induced index changes, which lead to filamentation and instability [19]. In contrast, the chaotic ray dynamics in the Limac\u0327on cavity broadens the angular range of local propagation directions in a lasing mode, creating a more disordered intensity distribution. The decrease of transverse wavelength weakens the lensing effect, thus reducing filament-like lasing instabilities.\nTo summarize, we demonstrate the coexistence of multiple dynamic processes with distinct spatio-temporal scales in semiconductor microdisk lasers. The dominant process in a Limac\u0327on-shape cavity is alternate oscillations between two output beams. In an elliptic cavity, filament-like instabilities dominate the lasing dynamics. Theoretical studies are needed to understand better how microcavity geometry and ray dynamics influence the lasing dynamics and how different dynamical processes affect each other. An in-depth understanding will pave the way for using the microcavity shape to control the lasing dynamics."

S2(d-f)], the dominant singular vectors are evenly distributed over positive (A\u03b1 > 0) and negative (A\u03b1 < 0) correlations. They may originate from lasing mode switching due to heating (Section ). Compared to Fig. 4(b), the singular vectors with sub-nanosecond correlation times are less strong because of the reduced temporal resolution of the streak images used here.\n7 [1] H. Cao and J.
