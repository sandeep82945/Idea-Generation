They emit radiation o v er a arge swathe of the electromagnetic spectrum. This emission is often epresented in the form of a spectral energy distribution (SED), which hows the power emitted as a function of frequency. Therefore, SEDs an be used as a powerful diagnostic tool, allowing us to probe the hysical structures and emission mechanisms in these objects. These how clearly that the AGN emission cannot be solely explained by a tandard (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973 ) disc model. The reality is much ore complex (see e.g. Lawrence 2012 and references therein). AGN span a very wide range in mass (from 10 5 \u221210 M ) and luinosity, and display distinctly different SEDs across this parameter\npace. The effect of orientation along our line of sight with respect o an equatorial obscurer (i.e. the dusty torus) is at the core of the unified model\u2019 (Antonucci 1993 ). Nonetheless, whilst orientation s surely a key parameter, the systematic differences in SED shape, een with changing mass and luminosity (e.g. Vasude v an & Fabian\nE-mail: jake.a.mitchell@durham.ac.uk (JAJM), chris.done@durham.ac.uk CD)\nb H s s\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Socie Commons Attribution License ( https://cr eativecommons.or g/licenses/by/4.0/), whi\n007 ; Jin et al. 2012 ; Lusso & Risaliti 2016a ), strongly indicate an ntrinsic change in the broad-band SED as a function of both mass nd/or luminosity.\nIntrinsic changes in the SED are well documented in black hole inary (BHB) systems (Done, Gierli \u0301nski & Kubota 2007 ). There is strong spectral transition which occurs at \u223c0.02 L Edd as the source lo wly dims do wn from a soft, thermal state to a hard, Comptonized tate. These different emission mechanisms most likely signal a undamental change in the nature of the accretion flow, from a eometrically thin, cool, optically thick disc similar to the standard isc models (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973 ) to an optically thin, hot, eometrically thick flow such as the advection-dominated accretion ow (ADAF) models (Narayan & Yi 1995 ). A single model for AGN would then take this state transition n BHB and scale it to the higher mass SMBH. Indeed, a strong pectral change is seen in some AGN that vary across the transition uminosity of \u223c0.02 L Edd (Krumpe et al. 2017 ; Noda & Done 2018 ; uan et al. 2019 ). These \u2018changing-look\u2019 AGN show hard X-ray pectra below a few per cent of Eddington which are dominated y the hard X-ray power law, similar to the hard state in BHB. o we v er, abo v e a few per cent of Eddington, i.e. when the BHB how pre-dominantly disc-dominated spectra, the AGN instead show pectra with a substantial amount of non-disc emission.

These AGNs are all abo v e he transition value, but at the lower end of the luminosity range hey show spectra that have strong hard X-ray emission, with similar ower to that seen in the UV, while the spectra become systematically ore UV disc dominated with increasing L / L Edd . The amount of disc to X-ray luminosity is often characterized by\nox , the spectral index of a power law connecting from the UV (2500 ) to the X-ray band at 2 keV. This index becomes progressively ore ne gativ e with increasing L bol , indicating that the spectra become ore disc dominated (Lusso et al. 2010 ; Lusso & Risaliti 2016b ). o we ver, gi ven the range of SMBH masses, it is not clear whether\nhis trend (which does have scatter) is driven by L bol or by L bol / L Edd or separate factor. Understanding the origin of this correlation would educe the scatter, and give more accuracy as well as more confidence n its use as a cosmological probe (Lusso et al. 2018 ).\nAnother key difference between the BHB and SMBH at luminosiies abo v e the transition is the appearance of an additional component n the spectrum, between the disc and X-ray tail. There is a downturn n the UV which appears to connect to an upturn at soft X-ray energies bo v e the 2\u201310 keV power law (soft X-ray excess). The origin and ature of this are not well understood, but it can be fairly well fit s a warm Comptonization component, in addition to a separate hot omptonization component producing the X-ray tail (Gierli \u0301nski & one 2004 ; Porquet et al. 2004 ; Jin et al. 2012 ). These dif ferences sho w that there must be something that breaks he scaling between the SMBH and BHB abo v e 0.02 L Edd . One key heoretical difference is that the disc temperature in AGN is lower, peak \u221d ( \u0307m /M) 1 / 4 , where m\u0307 = L / L Edd , at the innermost stable circular rbit, giving a predicted peak luminosity in the UV for AGN rather han in the soft X-rays as seen in BHB. This means that atomic hysics should be very important in AGN discs, whereas the soft Xay BHB discs are mostly dominated by plasma physics. This change n opacity could driv e turbulence/conv ection, or ev en mass-loss via V line driven disc winds (e.g. Laor & Davis 2014 ). Another expected theoretical difference is that radiation pressure s much more important in SMBH discs. The typical density of he SMBH disc is lower as well as its temperature, so the gas ressure in the disc is lower for a given temperature. So radiation ressure within the disc can dominate o v er gas pressure inside the isc o v er a much wider radial range compared to the BHB at similar ddington fraction, m\u0307 (Laor & Netzer 1989 ). This again could lead o turbulence/convection, and all hydrodynamic turbulence couples o the MRI dynamo which is the source of the viscosity, enhancing he heating towards the disc surface and potentially producing the arm Comptonization region (Jiang & Blaes 2020 ). KD18 built a phenomenological model ( QSOSED ) to describe the hanging SED in their very small sample of very well-studied AGN f fixed mass ( M BH \u223c 10 8 M ). This model is based on the expected o viko v\u2013Thorne heating rate from a disc at a given M BH and / L Edd , but incorporates a phenomenological prescription for how he energy is emitted, either as a standard disc (outer radii), warm omptonization (mid-radii) or hot corona (inner flo w). K ynoch et al. 2023 , hereafter K23 ) have assembled a much larger sample of AGN ith good-quality spectral data and thus fairly well-defined SEDs panning the optical/UV and X-ray bandpass where most of the ccretion energy should be emitted (detailed in Section 2.1 ). We se this new sample to critically test the QSOSED model across a ide range in mass and L / L Edd with the aim of understanding and haracterizing the accretion disc structures in AGN.\nWe first present an o v erview of the SOUX sample as defined in K23 long with a description of the models used throughout this work. e perform stacked fitting on the SOUX sample, binning on M BH nd L 2500 . Using the insights gained from these fits we investigate he shape of the optical-UV continuum in the wider parameter space y constructing wider bandpass spectra from all of Sloan Digital Sky urv e y (SDSS). These show no change in the optical\u2013UV continuum t constant L 2500 for changing mass by 2 dex. This is not compatible ith any current accretion disc model. Even if the highest black ole masses are o v erestimated, the amount of fine-tuning required to atch this looks contrived. Instead, we fa v our solutions where either he accretion disc is completely co v ered by a warm comptonizing ayer whose properties change systematically with L / L Edd , or the ccretion flow structure is fundamentally different to that of the tandard disc models.\nT H E SAMPLE A N D DATA\n23 includes a detailed description of the sample selection, spectral tting procedures, and calculation of important parameters such as lack hole mass and radio loudness. We include a short summary ere for completeness.\n.1 Sample selection\nur sample is primarily composed of sources taken from the Quasar atalog of the Fourteenth SDSS Data Release (SDSS-DR14Q; P \u0302 aris t al. 2018 ) cross-matched with the fourth source catalogue of XMM\u2013 ewton (4XMM-DR9; Webb et al. 2020 ). In order to have gooduality X-ray spectra we only select sources with \u2265 250 counts in MM\u2013Newton without flags for high background, diffuse emission, r poor-source properties. The simultaneous OM optical/UV data re taken from the fourth XMM\u2013Newton Serendipitous Ultraviolet ource Surv e y (XMM-SUSS4.1; P age et al. 2012 ). We consider all AGN with z \u2264 2.5 so as to have black-hole mass rom Mg II . We perform a visual inspection of each optical spectrum nd remo v e an y BAL\u2019s, Se yfert 2 sources and an y object with an nreliable black hole measurement due to poor or contaminated line rofiles, i.e. line profiles displaying obvious absorption. Through his process, we obtain 633 sources. We then supplement this sample ith a population of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) sources taken rom Rakshit et al. ( 2017 , R17). By repeating the same selection rocess with this catalogue, we obtain 63 NLS1 not present in our revious sample, bringing the total number of sources to 696. Where \u2265 0.4 we discard any OM filter contaminated by the strong Ly \u03b1 1216 UV emission line.\n.2 Spectral fitting and black hole mass estimates\nakshit, Stalin & Kotilainen ( 2020 , hereafter R20 ) analyse the SDSSR14Q spectra using a modified version of the PYTHON PYQSOFIT ackage (Guo, Shen & Wang 2018 ; Guo et al. 2019 ; Shen et al. 019 ). We fit the additional NLS1 sources from R17 with a version f PYQSOFIT modified to match the version used in R20 . For the 4 sources in both R17 and R20 , we compared our fits with those etailed in R20 and found good agreement. All black hole masses were calculated from full width at halfaximum (FWHM) measurements described abo v e, using the scalng relations detailed in Greene et al. ( 2010 ), Mej \u0301\u0131a-Restrepo et al. 2016 ), and Woo et al. ( 2018 ).\nAs our sources extend out to a redshift of 2.5, we are able o measure black-hole masses from either the H \u03b1, H \u03b2, or Mg II\nMNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nM\nb p v l q\n2\nO A ( A d s 1 4 r\n( T m L p 1\n( t T 0 j 2\n2\nK o t a a t a c w F\no a s b\n3\n3\nW e o r T 2\n3\nT a r a d R s o\n3\nT u i t t e o o t w r t e a h m v T 3 t w < U t h X\n3\nT t a a i b e l e t o c\nfl d\n3\nK s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1796/7205290 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nroad emission lines. Where several of these are present we rioritize H \u03b2, then Mg II , followed by H \u03b1. Ho we ver, we also isually inspect each optical SDSS spectrum and choose a different ine in cases where the \u2018preferred\u2019 option was clearly of lower uality.\n.3 Radio properties\nur 696 sources were cross-matched with both the Very Large rray (VLA) Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters FIRST) Becker (White & Helfand 1995 ) and the National Radio stronomy Observatory (NRAO) VLA Sk y Surv e y (NVSS; Conon et al. 1998 ) catalogues using a matching radius of 10 arcec following Lu et al. ( 2007 ). Both surv e ys sample the sky at .4 GHz, FIRST has a beam width of 5.6 arcsec and NVSS of 5 arcsec. We matched 124 and 83 objects in FIRST and NVSS, espectively.\nWe converted F 1 . 4 GHz to F 5 GHz using the scaling relation \u03bd5 GHz /\u03bd1 . 4 GHz ) \u2212\u03b1R , where \u03b1R is a common spectral index of 0.6. hese F 5 GHz values were converted to rest frame L 5 GHz using the ethod of Alexander et al. ( 2003 ). In objects where we have an 4400 \u00c5 and a FIRST detection, we calculated the radio loudness arameter, canonically defined as L 5 GHz /L 4400 \u00c5 (Kellermann et al. 989 ). Throughout the following analysis, 60 very radio loud sources radio loudness > 100) were remo v ed as there is a strong possibility hat the jet emission dominates o v er that of the accretion flow itself. he most obvious example of this in the original sample is PMN 948 + 0022, a NLS1 where the X-rays are clearly dominated by the et emission that extends up to Fermi GeV energies (Foschini et al. 012 ).\n.4 Sample pruning\n23 did not perform a detailed inspection of the broad-band SEDs r X-ray spectra in their analysis. Since in this work it is our goal o model the SEDS, we visually inspected each SED individually nd remo v ed an y object with strong indicators of intrinsic (host) bsorption. This could be due to cold/dusty gas in the molecular orus, easily seen as both the X-ray and UV data points are strongly ttenuated at the lowest/highest energies, respectively. We also exluded objects with partially ionized, warm absorption from nuclear inds, identified as a sharply concave soft X-ray shape (Reynolds & abian 1995 ; Chakra v orty et al. 2009 ). This remo v ed 54 sources from the original SOUX AGN sample f 696, described in K23 , leaving 642 sources available for detailed nalysis, this shall henceforth be referred to as the SOUX AGN ample. The 54 sources that have been removed from the sample efore the fitting process are detailed in Table D1 .\nT H E AG NS ED / Q S O S E D M O D E L S\n.1 Review of SED models for the accretion flow\ne use several different SED models in this work, so here we outline ach one in turn. All of them are based on the emissivity of an ptically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc in full general elativity (No viko v\u2013Thorne, NT ( r )) (No viko v & Thorne 1973 ). he y giv e the luminosity emitted o v er a disc annulus as L ( r ) = \u00d7 2 \u03c0r NT n ( r )d r .\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\n.2 Standard disc\nhe standard disc models assume that the disc luminosity as each nnulus is emitted as a black-body spectrum in which the spectral adiance density B \u03bd( T eff ) is a function of the ef fecti ve temperature T eff nd the luminosity at a given radius L ( R) = \u03c3SB T 4 eff . Pure standard isc models are where this holds o v er the entire disc, from R out to isco . This is the model which is most often used to fit the optical/UV pectra, but it cannot produce the soft and hard X-ray emission bserved from AGN.\n.3 Standard disc with colour temperature correction\nhe standard disc is the best physically understood model for the nderlying accretion flow structure, but the best detailed calculations ncorporate radiative transfer through the standard disc vertical strucure. These calculations predict a shift of the observed disc emission o higher temperatures (Hubeny et al. 2001 , D12 ). The standard disc nergy is mostly dissipated close to the mid-plane, so it diffuses utwards, setting up a vertical temperature gradient through the ptically thick material until it reaches the photosphere and escapes to he observer from and ef fecti ve optical depth \u03c4eff = \u221a \u03c4a ( \u03c4a + \u03c4s ) \u223c 1\nhere \u03c4 a and \u03c4 s are the optical depth to true absorption and scattering, espectively. True absorption opacity depends on the density and emperature of the material, and decreases with frequency, while lectron scattering is a constant. Thus, a single radius in the disc has spectrum which follows the expected black-body emission only for \u03bd kT eff , where \u03c4 a \u03c4 s , but the higher frequencies are dominated ore by scattering, moving the photosphere deeper into the disc ertical structure, where it samples higher temperature emission. his effect becomes apparent for photosphere temperatures T eff \u2265 \u00d7 10 4 K, and is fairly well approximated by a changing colour emperature correction, f col so that each radius emits a spectrum hich can be approximated as B \u03bd( f col T eff )/ f col 4 where f col = 1 for T eff 3 \u00d7 10 4 K. This produces a slight flattening of the spectrum in the V, as the radii which would have emitted at this energy are shifted o higher apparent temperature, making the disc spectrum peak at igher energies. Ho we ver, it still cannot produce the soft or hard -ray tail. This model is utilized in Section 5.3 .\n.4 AGNSED , including soft, and hard Comptonization\nhe model AGNSED , described in KD18 , is more flexible as it allows he accretion energy to be emitted as soft and hard Comptonization s well as disc blackbody. These are tied together by the underlying ssumptions that the energy is from accretion and that the flow is n a radially stratified such that the emission only thermalizes to a lackbody for R > R warm . For R warm < R < R hot , the power is instead mitted as an optically thick, warm Comptonization component, argely in the soft-X-rays (described by its photon index warm and lectron temperature kT e,warm , with seed photon temperature set by he underlying disc), while below R hot the spectrum switches to hot, ptically thin Comptonization (parameters hot and kT e,hot ) from the orona, largely emitting in the hard X-rays.\nThis has enough flexibility to fit the entire SED of the accretion ow from optical-UV and X-ray, but has a number of free parameters escribing the non-standard disc sections of the flow.\n.5 The QSOSED phenomenological model\nD18 fit AGNSED to the SED of three AGN of similar mass, but panning a range of L / L Edd . Their analysis showed that the power\nd c d t v h\nA w t h > t w o fl t t i l s e 1 a\nA t r R o \u223c g p s t\nt m l r s e e d g fi a i u d\na t\na\nm r\n3\nF l 5 0 b t a s d\nm g 0 r h p b l d t b C d m\nc L d L c t l w t (\nm t f 3 t m a 5 t s\nr s d u d H e o t e n t o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1796/7205290 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nissipated in the hot Comptonization region was approximately onstant at 0.02 L Edd . This is the maximum ADAF luminosity, efining the hard\u2013soft transition luminosity, but its persistence abo v e he transition is not what is expected from BHB. The BHB can show ery disc dominated spectra abo v e the spectral transition i.e. with ot Comptonization power 0.02 L Edd . Another difference between the AGN and BHB SEDs is that\nGN at L < 0.1 L Edd show hard X-ray spectra, with hot < 1.9, hereas the BHB al w ays show soft spectra, with hot > 2.0 abo v e he transition. This difference is important as it is difficult to produce ard spectra. An isotropic X-ray corona abo v e a disc must have hot 1.95 due to reprocessing. Not all the photon energy illuminating he disc from the corona can be reflected, especially for hard spectra here the luminosity peaks at \u223c100 keV. Compton downscattering n reflection means that at least 30 per cent of the illuminating ux goes instead into heating the disc, producing a reprocessed hermal component which is re-intercepted by the corona. Even if he disc is completely dark (passive), so that all the accretion energy s dissipated in the corona, these reprocessed photons give a lower imit to the seed photons such that L seed \u223c L x , which ties the X-ray pectral index to hot \u223c 2 (Haardt & Maraschi 1991 , 1993 ; Stern t al. 1995 ; Malzac et al. 2003 ). Thus, the AGN with spectra hot < .9 most likely still have a truncated disc geometry, unlike the BHB bo v e the transition ( KD18 ).\nThe QSOSED model folds all these results into a predictive model for GN SED. Firstly, it calculates the truncation radius assuming that he hot X-ray plasma replaces the inner disc from R isco out as far as equired for the accretion disc power to reach 0.02 L Edd . Thus, R hot isco for an AGN at L bol = 0.03 L Edd , leaving very little power for the uter UV disc emission. Conversely, for an AGN at L bol \u223cL / L Edd , R hot R isco so its SED is dominated by a UV bright disc component. This eometry and energy balance is used to calculate the self-consistent ower-la w inde x of the hot Comptonization region, hot , fixing its pectrum in both normalization and index assuming that the electron emperature remains fixed at 100 keV ( KD18 ).\nThe warm Comptonization region is even less well understood han the hot Comptonization, but it can be fit with optically thick\naterial (with optical depth \u03c4 \u223c 10\u201320) which makes it look ike it is associated with the disc, perhaps due to the dissipation e gion mo ving upw ards tow ard the photosphere, as opposed to the tandard Shakura\u2013Sunyaev disc where the dissipation is mainly in the quatorial plane. In this case, Compton reprocessing again sets the nergy balance between the seed photons and electron heating. The ifference is that for the observed low temperature of \u223c0.2 keV, this ives warm \u223c2.5 (Petrucci et al. 2018 ; KD18 ). The QSOSED model xes these parameters, but needs also the transition radius, R warm t which the disc stops emitting as a black-body standard disc, and nstead produces the warm Comptonization region. Since this is not nderstood theoretically, KD18 took it from the data which could be escribed by R warm = 2 R hot . Thus, the QSOSED model contains a number of assumptions in ddition to those of AGNSED (emissi vity gi ven by Novikov\u2013Thorne hin disc, but the emission mechanism is radially stratified):\n(i) The hard X-ray luminosity is 0.02 L Edd irrespective of L bol . (ii) The temperature of the warm Comptonized disc is \u223c0.2 keV,\nnd it is a passive structure so warm = 2.5. (iii) The warm Compton region extends from R warm = 2 R hot .\nThe SOUX sample can test many of these assumptions as we have any more than the three SEDs used by KD18 , and it spans a larger\nange in m\u0307 and a much larger range in M BH .\n.5.1 Example QSOSED spectra\nig. 2 shows the model SED for changing L / L Edd (in steps of og( L / L Edd ) = 0.1) for black hole mass of 5 \u00d7 10 7 M (left) and \u00d7 10 9 M (right) for log( \u0307m ) = \u22121 . 645 \u2212 0 . 355 (corresponding to .026 < L / L Edd < 2.6). The model is only defined o v er this range as elo w the lo wer limit, AGN should make a changing look transition o be completely dominated by the X-ray hot flow (ADAF), and bo v e the upper limit, the effects of optically thick advection/winds hould become apparent, changing the emissivity to that of a slim isc (Abramowicz et al. 1988 ; Kubota & Done 2019 ). These figures show the effect of the assumptions of the QSOSED odel. For both masses, the R hot and hot values are the same at a iven m\u0307 , with R hot decreasing from (155\u20139) R g as m\u0307 increases from .026 to 2.6 (see Fig. 3 ), so that the disc and warm Comptonization e gions progressiv ely dominate more of the emission. Ho we ver, M BH as an impact on the SED as the outer disc temperature and seed hoton temperature for the warm disc region are lower at the higher lack hole masses. The 2500 \u00c5 flux (indicated by the vertical dashed ines in Fig. 2 ) is generally mostly produced in the outer standard isc region for the lower mass AGN (5 \u00d7 10 7 M ). However, for he higher mass of 5 \u00d7 10 9 M , the outer disc generally peaks elow 2500 \u00c5, so the UV flux is instead dominated by the warm omptonization up to \u223c0.1 L / L Edd . Thus, the model predicts a mass ependence to the \u03b1ox values due to the difference in UV emission echanism with mass, as well as a dependence on m\u0307 . These model SEDs also show how to understand the lines of onstant L / L Edd o v erlaid on Fig. 1 . A pure disc spectrum should have 2500 \u221d ( M 2 BH m\u0307 ) 2 / 3 . Both high and low masses are dominated by the isc at the highest m\u0307 , so the grey lines of constant m\u0307 0 . 5 have 2500 \u221d M 4 / 3 BH , a non-linear relation, unlike the constant bolometric orrection which is often assumed, where L 2500 \u221d M BH . At lower m\u0307 , he highest masses start to bend away from this expected slope as the ower standard disc temperature means the UV is dominated by the arm Comptonization region rather than the standard disc. Here and hroughout, L 2500 refers to the monochromatic luminosity at 2500 \u00c5 in units of erg s \u22121 ).\nThere is an especially sharp decrease at the lowest m\u0307 for the highest asses. This is because of the assumption that the outer radius of he disc is set by self-gra vity. The self-gra vity radius ( R sg ) is only a ew hundred R g for the most massive AGN at the lowest m\u0307 (see Fig. ). The QSOSED model has the accretion flow end before making the ransition to a thin disc for masses abo v e 2 \u00d7 10 8 M . Abo v e this\nass the warm Compton region gets smaller and smaller, extending cross (155\u2013311) R g at 2 \u00d7 10 8 M , but shrinking to (155\u2013167) R g at \u00d7 10 9 M for m\u0307 = 0.026 (see Fig. 3 ). This dramatically reduces he warm Compton emission, leading to an extremely hard X-ray pectrum.\nHo we v er, the e xtent of the disc is v ery uncertain as the self-gravity adius is calculated here assuming that the disc surface density is et by the standard Shakura\u2013Sunyaev disc in the radiation-pressureominated regime (Laor & Netzer 1989 ), yet the SED at low m\u0307 is very nlike a standard disc. There is no clear picture from observational ata either, with some studies finding the disc to be larger (e.g. ao et al. 2010 ; Landt et al. 2023 ), others smaller (e.g. Collinson t al. 2017 ). The green-dashed line in Fig. 2 (b) shows the effect f increasing the disc outer radius to a generic value of 10 5 R g in he QSOSED model. This gives a dramatic increase in the UV and specially the optical luminosity, with the outer standard disc region o w e vident in the SED at the lo west frequencies. This sho ws that he optical/UV spectra of the highest mass AGNs are sensitive to the uter extent of the disc.\nMNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nM\nFigure 1.

Thus, it is the highest mass AGN at the lowest m\u0307 which are most ensitive to the standard disc region and how (or if) this transitions o the warm Comptonized region. Instead, the lowest mass AGN t the highest m\u0307 are most sensitive to the transition from warm omptonization to hot Comptonization. These low mass, highest \u02d9 are also the ones which are most likely to be at low redshift, aximizing the visibility of the soft X-ray excess in the XMM andpass. Thus the predictions of the QSOSED model can be directly tested n our new sample of AGN which span a wide range of mass and m\u0307 . FITTING TO T H E DATA hroughout this section we consider the mean SED from the data in ach grid point, comparing it to a series of models. For the first two ections 4.1 and 4.2 , we only fit to the UV data from the OM, and\nhen extrapolate to the optical SDSS and X-ray bandpasses, forming true test of the model predictions. We only include the X-ray data n the fit in Section 4.3. We never include the SDSS data in the fits s this is not simultaneous, so variability could distort the modelling. o we ver, this is minimized by averaging over all the objects in the in, and the generally good match between the SDSS and OM data rovides a check on intercalibration/aperture issues.\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nWe make the mean SED from the data by fitting a single model for ach grid point, with black hole mass fixed at the (logarithmic) centre f the mass gridpoint. This model is fit simultaneously to the rele v ant pectral range of all objects in that bin, but with parameters set to he individual objects co-moving distance/redshift, and appropriate alactic reddening/absorption. The data of each object is plotted in og \u03bd versus log \u03bdL \u03bd , where the data are shifted into the rest frame f the galaxy and corrected for galactic absorption by considering he dust maps of Schlafly & Finkbeiner ( 2011 ) using the ASTROPY xtinction module with the (Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis 1989 ) xtinction profile. Each instrument for each individual source is ebinned on to a common energy grid (six bins for XMM\u2013Newton nd four for the OM). We calculate a weighted log mean of all the ata for each bin, with any data point with an intersecting energy ncertainty being included. The weighted 1 \u03c3 standard deviation for ach bin is displayed either side of the weighted mean.\nSimilarly the composite SDSS optical spectra for each bin are he geometric mean of the de-reddened, redshift corrected individual pectra, again with weighted \u00b11 \u03c3 standard deviation. We bin in log pace as this means that the spectral slope of the composite has the ean of the spectral slopes of the individual spectra from which it is omposed (see Reichard et al. 2003 ). All plots containing SED insets follow the same format as escribed abo v e, and each inset plot spans 2 dex in luminosity and o v ers the spectral range between 10 14.2 and 10 19.6 Hz.\n4\nQ s t r f g U\nt ( s n t X i L S f s a e c f Q h\nl h s i w l d l 2 M\nl t s m d s s m t m A e H d ( t n d\nl c m a\nh w s h a d d e\nf m 2\n4 e\nO d b e C g\nb R l H fi f p l\nt T d t a m h m\n( ( a f t r a d c (\nt t c s C n t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1796/7205290 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n.1 QSOSED in each M BH \u2013L 2500 bin\nSOSED can be used to create an entire SED from a single data point o we test this by fitting only to the mean UV data and extrapolating he resultant model down through the optical and up into the Xay bandpass. We fix black hole spin at a \u2217 = 0, so m\u0307 is the only ree parameter, essentially fixing it to give the mean L 2500 of each rid point. We show the results of this fit, hereafter called QSOSED V-tied, in Fig. 4 . Each inset plot shows the QSOSED fit (solid line) together with he SDSS optical (red), XMM\u2013Newton OM UV (blue) and X-ray pink) data for all objects located in each respective gridpoint. We tress that the QSOSED UV-tied model is fit only to the UV data, ot to the X-ray or optical points on this plot, yet to zeroth order he QSOSED model is in broad agreement with both the optical and -ray data. The range of resultant m\u0307 match the grey lines plotted n Fig. 1 , as expected given that these fits are forced to match the 2500 luminosity. These are spin zero models, but in general the entire ED is well fit. Extreme spin gives a factor of 6 more luminosity or the same mass accretion rate through the outer disc. There is no trong evidence for this. Strong wind losses would reduce the mass ccretion rate through the innermost regions of the disc. We might xpect this to be most important at the highest m\u0307 but there is no lear trend of the X-ray flux being strongly o v erpredicted. To within actors of a few, the thin disc emissivity which is hardwired into SOSED is giving the correct bolometric flux for a zero spin black ole. To first order though, there are some interesting discrepancies. At ow masses, log( M BH /M ) < 8.0, the optical data are systematically igher than the model especially at low m\u0307 , so that the optical/UV pectra are redder than the standard outer disc spectrum assumed n the model. This could be due to host galaxy contamination, hich should become more prominent for low black hole mass, ow-luminosity AGN (Done et al. 2012 , hereafter D12 ). The X-ray ata are also systematically \u223c0.5 dex higher than the model for these ower black hole masses at high m\u0307 , so require more than the assumed per cent of power dissipated in the hot coronal region (see also iddei et al. in preparation). Ho we ver, the major discrepancies are all at the highest masses, og( M BH /M ) > 9.0. The QSOSED model systematically o v erpredicts he X-ray by \u223c(0.3\u20130.6) dex in luminosity for all values of m\u0307 . Most urprisingly though, the optical/UV slope in the data is generally uch bluer than the model. This is not likely to be from any aperture ifference between SDSS and OM as the galaxy contamination hould be negligible at these high luminosities. The optical/UV data imply do not look like a standard outer disc for a black hole of this ass and mass accretion rate. The observed optical/UV spectra in his mass range are still typically rising towards Ly \u03b1 but the QSOSED odels predict that the emission should peak below this energy. s seen in the model spectra shown in Fig. 2 , stronger outer disc mission could easily be produced by increasing the outer disc radius. o we ver, this further decreases the characteristic energy at which the isc components peak, whereas the data show that the QSOSED model with its very small outer radius from self-gravity) already predicts he peak energy being too low. In essence, the optical/UV data do ot look like the QSOSED models in this range, as the outer standard isc in the model peaks at too low energy. This is very surprising, especially as the outer standard disc is the east contro v ersial of all the QSOSED components. The UV spectrum ould be suppressed by dust reddening from the host, but this would ake the mismatch worse as these high-mass AGN have spectra that re already too blue to match the standard disc.\ni\nThe spectrum rather appears like a standard disc, but shifted o v er to igher energies than predicted for black holes of this high mass for a ide range in mass accretion rate. Section 5 considers the optical/UV pectral shape in more detail, and shows that this mismatch at the ighest masses is not due to the assumption in QSOSED that the warm nd hot Comptonization power is derived from the disc. Even pure isc models, where all the power is dissipated in blackbody emission own to R isco of a high spin black hole cannot match the far UV mission in the spectra observed in the high mass/low m\u0307 bins.\nInterestingly, where the QSOSED models fit the SEDs (highest m\u0307 or log( M BH /M ) > 8), their predicted EUV continuum is able to atch the observed 1640 \u00c5 He II equi v alent widths (Temple et al. 023 ).\n.2 Fully Comptonized outer disc: AGNSED ( R hot = 10 R g ) in ach M BH \u2013L 2500 bin\nne way to shift the disc spectrum to higher energies is if the whole isc is co v ered by the warm Comptonized layer. This was suggested y Petrucci et al. ( 2018 ) as they had noticed that the spectra of ven the 10 8 M AGN seemed to be well fit with just warm and hot omptonization, without the need for a standard disc once the host alaxy was subtracted.\nWe simultaneously fit all the OM data in a given grid point as efore, only now we use the more flexible AGNSED and fix R warm = out so that the entire outer disc is co v ered by the warm Compton ayer. We again fix warm = 2.5 and kT warm = 0.2 keV in this region. o we ver, AGNSED also allo ws freedom in R hot and in hot , so we first x these to 10 R g and 2.0, respectively in order to find the mean m\u0307 or each grid point. Setting R hot at 10 R g is equi v alent to fixing the ower dissipated in hot corona to \u223c 7 per cent of L bol [see Fig. 3 for og( \u0307m ) = \u22120.5].\nThe results from this fitting procedure (henceforth referred o as AGNSED UV-tied R hot = 10 R g ) are displayed in Fig. 5 . he background, as in Fig. 4 , is colour coded to the m\u0307 value erived for the bin. These are shifted in a complex way from he values derived before. Fig. 6 (a) shows the ratio of mass ccretion rates derived from QSOSED and the AGNSED UV-tied odels. At lower mass/higher L 2500 , the AGNSED models need a igher m\u0307 than QSOSED , whereas the opposite is true at higher asses. Fig. 6 (b) shows why this is the case for each of these conditions bins labelled 1 and 2). At the lowest masses (bin 1), the 2500 \u00c5 point dashed line) is in the standard disc region of the QSOSED model (red), s can be seen by comparison to a completely standard disc model or the same m\u0307 (purple: R hot = R warm = 6 R g ). Instead, a model with he same m\u0307 where the entire disc is co v ered by the warm Compton egion (black: R hot = 6 R g , R warm = R out ) has much lower luminosity t 2500 \u00c5. This is because the warm Comptonization shifts the isc spectrum to higher energies, acting like a colour temperature orrection. Hence, to match the data at 2500 \u00c5 requires a higher m\u0307 dashed black line).\nInstead, for the highest masses, the behaviour is opposite as he QSOSED model (red) already had the 2500 \u00c5 flux produced by he warm Comptonization rather than the outer standard disc. A ompletely standard disc (purple: R hot = 6 R g , R warm = 6 R g ) is again hown for comparison. Completely co v ering the disc with the warm omptonization with the same m\u0307 (black: R hot = 6 R g , R warm = R out ) ow o v erpredicts the 2500 \u00c5 flux, so here the data require a lower m\u0307 o match the data than before (dotted black line).\nThis complex change in m\u0307 across the large range in M BH and L 2500 ncreases the range of m\u0307 spanned by the sample.

Nonetheless, Fig. 5 shows that the new model has the desired f fect in gi ving a much better match to the optical/UV spectra at igh black hole masses, but now the optical/UV from the lower mass lack holes are not well fit. Unlike the mismatch with the standard disk in the highest mass GN where the data were already too blue, here the data are too red. ence the models could be made to fit the data if there was either nternal reddening suppressing the UV, or host galaxy contamination nhancing the optical, or a combination of both. K23 assess the road line region Balmer decrement across the sample, but show hat this has no clear relation with the optical/UV continuum slope their Section 4.1 ). Additionally, we have pruned the full sample, emoving all objects with obvious internal reddening (Section 2.4). 23 also assess the host galaxy contamination (their Section 3.1 ) but onclude that this is negligible below 4400 \u00c5. Thus these effects are nlikely to provide a full explanation of the observed discrepancies, specially as there are additional tensions in the SEDs. The model ow o v erpredicts the soft X-ray excess, most clearly in the higher uminosity bins with log( M BH /M ) < 8.5. A large soft X-ray excess s an inevitable result of assuming that all the disc power abo v e R hot 10 R g is Comptonised. Ho we ver, it is also clear that a fixed R hot = 10 R g is not compatible\nith the X-ray data. This is most clear in the log( M BH /M ) = 8.0- .5 bin, where this model systematically underpredicts the X-ray ower at low m\u0307 , and o v erpredicts it at high m\u0307 . There is a very lear decrease in the ratio of hard X-ray to bolometric luminosity s a function of m\u0307 (see e.g. Vasude v an & Fabian 2007 ; Vasudean 2008 ). Hence, we let the parameters of the hot Comptonizaion region be free to see if this can resolve the tensions seen ere.\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\ns\n.3 Comptonized outer disc: AGNSED fits to the mean SED sing all XMM\u2013Newton data\ne still assume the outer disc is completely co v ered by the warm omptonization region with warm = 2.5 and kT e,warm = 0.2 keV but o w allo w freedom in the hot corona parameters of R hot and hot in ddition to m\u0307 . This requires that we fit the X-ray spectra as well as he UV data in each grid point. Fig. 7 shows the results of this. There s now a clear discrepancy in the normalization of the optical/UV odel at lower masses. This is especially evident for log( M BH /M ) 8.0 at high m\u0307 , where now the UV normalization does not match he data. This is because the X-rays are now included in the fit as well s the UV, so the model is averaging between them. The model SED ow has a strong soft X-ray excess as the entire outer disc is co v ered y a warm Comptonizing layer. The X-ray spectra do not generally upport such a strong soft X-ray excess, so the fit compensates by educing m\u0307 (which itself will reduce the size of the soft excess) nd increasing R hot . But this in turn o v erpredicts the observ ed X-ray uminosity in the 2\u201310 keV bandpass, so the fit pushes the X-ray pectral index to its hard limit of hot = 1.6 so as to put some of this ower abo v e 10 keV where there are no data. Compared to QSOSED , this model gives a much better fit to the high BH , but a worse fit to the lower M BH . Fig. 8 shows the resultant m\u0307 , hot , hot , and L disc, hot / L Edd values for this model, compared to the ame parameters for the original QSOSED UV-tied model. The region here hot pegs to the minimum value clearly shows the parameter pace where the fits are least convincing.\nT H E SHAPE O F T H E OPTI CAL/ UV PECTR U M FR O M SDSS\n.1 SDSS composites\ne can make an independent check of the shape of the optical/UV pectrum using composites from a much larger sample of AGN\nFigure 3.

The de-reddened spectra were resampled on to uniform wavelength grid with a resolution of 5 \u00c5, converted to \u03bdL \u03bd nd shifted into the rest frame.\nHere and throughout, as with L 2500 at 2500 \u00c5, L 3000 refers to the onochromatic luminosity at 3000 \u00c5 in units of erg s \u22121 .

These composites for each of the bins populated by the SOUX GN sample are shown in Fig. 9 . The whole grid is shown in the ppendix (Figs B1 and B2 ). Many of the lower mass bins only ontain low redshift spectra due to the lack of high-redshift sources n this mass range, the opposite effect is true for some of the higher\nass bins in which there does not exist any low redshift sources. Unlike the SOUX sample, Figs 4 \u20138 , we have not attempted to emo v e v ery radio loud sources as not all the SDSS spectra have 4400 \u00c5, so this cannot be done systematically, but this will only be a ery small fraction of the sources, so their effect on the composites hould also be small.\n.1.2 Comparison with QSOSED and AGNSED\nig. 9 shows the same grid as seen in Fig. 1 ; ho we ver, each inset lot shows the average QSOSED (UV-tied, black), the average AGNSED odel (UV-tied, red), and the SDSS composite spectra (low z : indigo, igh z : purple) rele v ant to each bin. The models plotted in Fig. 9 have not been exposed to the SDSS ata meaning that the SDSS composite spectra provide a powerful iagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of our fits in both flux level nd shape, and their rele v ance to the wider AGN population.\nIt is clear that, in general, the composite SDSS data from a wider ample of AGN are similar to the SDSS-OM spectra from the SOUX ample. At lower redshifts, we see spectral shapes much redder than he models which is consistent with our own SDSS spectra and UV ata points, an effect that we attribute to host galaxy contribution to he spectra. In general, the composites show a better agreement with he QSOSED (black) models o v er the AGNSED (red) models at low to\nedium mass, but then shift towards the shape of our AGNSED (red) odels at higher masses. The trends seen in the optical/UV SDSS spectra shown here are imilar to those seen in our SOUX sample.

Left-hand panel: A comparison of the m\u0307 derived from the QSOSED UV-tied and AGNSED UV-tied models of Figs 4 and 5 . Lower mass bins systematically require higher m\u0307 for the Comptonized outer disc AGNSED model, while the opposite is true for the highest masses. This is explained by looking in detail for spectra in the black hole mass/luminosities bins highlighted as 1 and 2. Lower right-hand panel: In the low-mass bin, the QSOSED UV tied model (red) is dominated by the outer standard disc. A pure standard disc of the same m\u0307 is shown in purple, and has very similar L 2500 . Comptonizing this entire emission shifts the spectrum to the right (black line), so this has much lower L 2500 than before. Thus, a fully Comptonized disc requires higher m\u0307 (black dashed line) to reco v er the same L 2500 as before. Upper right-hand panel: In the high-mass bin, the outer disc peaks below 2500 \u00c5, so the QSOSED UV tied model is dominated by the warm Comptonized emission (red). A pure disc spectrum (purple) at the same m\u0307 has much larger luminosity at 2500 \u00c5. Completely Comptonizing this (black) still has larger luminosity at 2500 \u00c5, so to match the same L 2500 point requires a smaller m\u0307 .\na l i t ( s (\nf 9 s t c 1 B b c c\ns I t a i w\ne T o r b l\nm w w s fi f w c p\n5\nS s a fi d\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1796/7205290 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nccretion rates and high masses are predicted to peak at far too ow a temperature to make the UV emission seen here. The drop n disc temperature is even more obvious in QSOSED as this has he inner disc progressively replaced by the hot flow as m\u0307 drops see Fig. 2 ). Thus, we expect that there should be a clear change in hape for the optical/UV spectra at the same L 3000 for changing mass see Fig. 10 ). We look for this effect by comparing the spectra at constant L 3000 or different masses where there are 3 or more mass bins in Fig. . These are shown in Fig. A1 . Very surprisingly, the optical/UV pectra are almost identical. This is most clearly the case for he highest luminosity bin, L 3000 = (45.5 \u221245.75)(erg s \u22121 ), which ontains spectra from four mass bins from log( M BH /M ) = (8.0\u2013 0.0) (shown in Fig. 11 and enclosed in green in Figs 9 , A1 , 3 , and C1 ). The line widths of H \u03b2 and Mg II clearly show roader line profiles in the higher mass bins, as expected for the hange in mass, but the continuum shape shows no significant hange.\nThe Appendix shows that this trend continues for the whole SDSS ample, not just the range co v ered by the SOUX sample (Fig. B3 ). t is clear that even in this wider parameter space, the shape of he optical\u2013UV continuum does not vary significantly with M BH t a fixed luminosity. We also check that the same spectral shape s seen in individual objects by comparing our composite spectra ith a sample of individual AGN observed by X-shooter (Capellupo\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nt al. 2015 ; F a wcett et al. 2022 , data by pri v ate communication). his instrument co v ers an extremely wide bandpass, similar to ur composites. Fig. C1 shows these composites plotted o v er the ele v ant bins from Fig. 11 . Again we see no significant differences etween any of the spectra across the entire mass range at a given uminosity.\nTo check that, when measured, the mass of each composite atches the masses of the sources from which each composite as constructed, we fit the composite spectra presented in Fig. 11 ith PYQSOFIT and derive a black hole mass for each using the\ncaling relations of Mej \u0301\u0131a-Restrepo et al. ( 2016 ). The results from this tting procedure are presented in Table 1 . All of the mass estimates all within the bounds of the mass bin for which each composite as constructed. This allows us to perform detailed fitting of these omposite spectra using the central mass of each bin during the fitting rocedure.\n.3 Detailed fits to the SDSS composites and fine-tuning\nince we have only the optical/UV spectra, we now go back to the tandard (and colour temperature corrected) disc models (Section 3.3 nd 3.4 ) to see if these can fit better to this restricted energy range.

We take the four mass ins from the log( L 3000 ) = (45.5\u201345.75) (erg s \u22121 ) row highlighted in reen in Fig. 9 and fit a pure disc model using AGNSED ( f col = 1). It is ery clear that highest masses require maximal spin in order to make he disc peak at high enough energy to fit the shortest wavelengths ampled here.\nWe repeat this with the colour temperature corrected disc, ( f col ( T )), s incorporated in OPTXAGNF . The same shift to high spin is apparent, ut this model now fits the curvature seen in the data, where there is systematic flattening of the spectra at the shortest wavelengths. his is because the colour temperature correction from electron cattering onset is when the disc temperature exceeds 3 \u00d7 10 4 K. nnuli abo v e this temperature are shifted relative to annuli at lower\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nemperatures, producing a characteristic bend in the spectrum at a pecific wavelength.\nIt is concei v able that there are real physical mechanisms that cause igher mass black holes to have high spin. Ho we ver, the fine tuning f a \u2217 and m\u0307 that is necessary to allow the UV-optical continuum hape to remain constant across 2.5 dex in black hole mass, as is hown in Fig. 11 , seems contrived.\nAdditionally, none of these models are self-consistent as while hey incorporate general relati vistic ef fects on the intrinsic emissivity No viko v\u2013Thorne, see Section 3), they do not include relativistic ray racing on the observed spectrum. There is a strong gravitational edshift expected for high spin, which is much more important han the Doppler blueshift from the fast orbital motion at low nclinations. All these effects are much weaker for low spin. We se RELAGN (Hagen & Done 2023 ) to incorporate both the general elati vistic ef fects on the emissi vity and on the radiation transport to he observer. Fig. 12 shows what happens to the pure disc (f col = 1) nd to the colour temperature corrected disc, f col ( T ). There is now o adequate fit for the highest mass bin.

This strongly indicates that intrinsic reddening does not elp in fitting disc spectra to the optical-UV continua of high mass GN. This is as expected as the high-mass spectra are far more blue han predicted by the disc models.\n.3.2 Fitting a standard disc with minimal and maximal spin\ne illustrate the issues abo v e by plotting the models o v er a wider nergy range for the highest and lowest mass bins. Fig. 13 shows a omparison of minimal and maximal spin models for the four disc odels shown in Fig. 12 for the log( M BH /M ) = (8.0\u20138.5) and og( M BH /M ) = (9.5\u201310.0) mass bins at fixed log( L 3000 ) = (45.5\u2013 5.75) (erg s \u22121 ). In the lower mass bin of log( M BH /M ) = (8.0\u20138.5) all four disc odels are able to give a reasonable fit to the spectral shape of he optical-UV continuum. In this mass range, with a \u2217 = 0, the elativistic correction makes very little difference to the SED shape, he colour temperature correction has far more impact and shifts the eak to higher energies in a similar fashion to Comptonization. Here, he colour temperature corrected fits, dashed lines, provide a better v erall fit to the data, and have lower m\u0307 values. When a \u2217 is fixed at 0.998, maximal spin, the colour temperature orrected models again show better fits to the data. However, the v erall spectral shape of the SED is greatly changed, with the elativistic corrections having a much greater effect than the colour emperature correction. The effect of having maximal spin is to drag he peak of emission to much higher energies, this is significantly ounter acted ho we ver when general relati vity is taken into account nd the peak of emission is shifted towards lower energies. This ccurs due to the increased importance of relativistic redshift on the mission as opposed to blue shift at high spin, whereas at low spin hese factors are much more balanced.\nAt high mass the picture is very different. With log( M BH /M ) (9.5\u201310.0) and a \u2217 = 0, the SED shape for all four disc regimes is lmost identical, and plainly does not match the data. At these high asses and zero spin, general relativity has almost no effect, other han to slightly increase the m\u0307 value for a given L 3000 . A common pproach at these masses is to assume high spin. The bottom rightand panel of Fig. 13 shows that a pure disc at maximal spin, with or ithout a colour temperature correction matches the spectral shape f the high-mass composite well. Ho we ver, once general relativity s taken into account, all that is gained in shifting the peak to higher nergies by maximizing spin is lost again, as the peak of emission hift back to lower energies and once again does not fit the data well.\nThis shows clearly that there is no way to make the optical/UV pectra seen from the highest mass AGN from a standard (or colour emperature corrected) disc for these masses and mass accretion ates. Even if all the energy is dissipated in a disc (with the hard and oft X-rays powered by e.g. a separate coronal flow or by tapping he spin energy of the black hole) the UV emission extends to higher nergies than predicted for the accretion disc peak in full general elativity (Figs 12 and 13 ).\n.3.3 Fitting a fully Comptonized disc with minimal and maximal pin\nblackbody disc cannot fit the highest masses, even with colour emperature correction as expected from a standard disc photosphere. nstead, we explore the viability of fitting fully Comptonized disc pectra, as suggested by Petrucci et al. ( 2018 ), which implies that he energy is dissipated away from the mid-plane, towards the\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nhotosphere. Since the SDSS data do not co v er the soft X-ray excess, e fix its electron temperature at 0.2 keV. We fit a fully Comptonized disc ( R warm = R out , R hot = R isco ) for\n\u02d9 with warm = 2.5, and a Comptonized pure disc fit with both m\u0307 nd warm as free parameters, to the log( M BH /M ) = (8.0\u20138.5) and og( M BH /M ) = (9.5\u201310.0) bins, at fixed L 3000 = (45.5\u201345.75)(erg \u22121 ). We repeat this process for the same disc models but with the ddition of full general relativity. The results of this fitting process re shown in Fig. 14 .\nIn the low-mass regime, both at zero and maximal spin, the opticalV continuum shape of the composite is too red to fit well to any f the Comptonized disc spectra. The inclusion of general relativity oes not make a difference to the fit to the data; ho we ver, it does hange the o v erall shape of the SED and reduces L bol dramatically. he same is true when fitting to warm , which in both the zero nd maximal spin regimes results in the maximum allowed value f warm = 3.5. In the high mass bin, Comptonization provides a better fit to the ata. In the spin zero models, there is very little difference between he Comptonized pure discs with and without general relativity, and he best-fitting warm pegs at the minimum value of 2.1 though there s more dispersion for the Comptonization shape at high spin.\nComptonization does not solve all the issues, there is clearly a eed for warm to change as a function of M BH or perhaps more likely hysically with m\u0307 . Ho we ver, it does at least allow the models to fit o the furthest UV emission observed in the data. The key issue is ur (lack of) understanding of the physics which sets this emission omponent.\nT H E STRU CTURE O F T H E AC C R E T I O N LOW\nhe QSOSED model is a good zeroth-order predictor of the intrinsic GN spectrum (Fig. 4 ). In particular, it is clear that the assumptions ade about the hot Comptonization region match fairly well to the X-\nay luminosity and spectra seen in the 2\u201310 keV bandpass across most f the range of mass and m\u0307 in our sample. This fa v ours the underlying ssumption that the hot corona dissipates up to the ADAF maximum f L diss = 0.02 L Edd . For accretion flows below this limit, the entire ccretion power is dissipated in the hot corona rather than in a UV right disc. This means there is no longer a strong UV ionizing flux o no strong BLR, leading to an optical classification as an LINER r true type-2 Seyfert. This gives the observed mass dependence of he lowest luminosity spectra identified as QSOs in SDSS.\nThe outer disc extends inwards as the source luminosity increases bo v e the ADAF limit, but unlike the stellar mass BHB at the same / L Edd , the disc is still truncated so that there is substantial hard X-ray ower with L diss = 0.02 L Edd . In the QSOSED model, this requirement ets the extent of truncation of the optically thick material, R hot . The nner disc only extends down close to the ISCO for L 0.1 L Edd , iving the changing fraction of disc to X-ray power seen in the data. Similarly, the warm Comptonization region in QSOSED is a fairly ood match to the soft X-ray/UV data at zeroth-order despite he assumptions underlying this component being completely pheomenological. In particular, the assumption that the radius of he warm Comptonization region is R warm = 2 R hot means that the xtent of this component is limited at high L / L Edd where R hot \u223c isco , whereas it co v ers most of the outer disc at L / L Edd \u223c 0.02. he condition R warm = 2 R hot equi v alent to assuming that the soft omptonization carries a more or less fixed fraction of the bolometric uminosity, with L warm = 0.2 L bol .\nFigure 13.

Yellow points indicate the continuum dominated regions used for the fits. Models are a pure disc (red solid), colour temperature corrected disc (red dashed). The blue solid and dashed lines indicate the same models but with the self-consistent ray tracing. This does not have a large effect for spin 0 (upper panels), but is very important for high spin (lower panel), where gravitational redshift means that no disc model with dissipation in the mid-plane can fit the data.\ni a l \u00c5 d t u p i ( t g D i s w t s\nU t f i w t\ne i a\n6\nW a c U w w\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1796/7205290 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nThe QSOSED component which is the worst fit is the one which s best moti v ated physically, namely the standard disc emission ssumed for the outer radii.

This gives a higher temperature disc eak from the smaller R isco size scales. Ho we ver, these models only ncorporated the effects of general relativity on the disc emissivity No viko v\u2013Thorne, as used here), but did not include its effect on ray racing from the disc to the observer (Capellupo et al. 2016 ). There is ravitational and transverse red shift that depends on R , whereas the oppler red and blue shifts from orbital motion depend on both R and nclination. These shifts are generally negligible for the optical/UV pectra of QSO with masses 10 9 M , as the radii emitting these avelengths are at R 10 R g . Ho we ver, for the most massi ve QSO he observed UV is produced close to R isco . Pure disc models with low pin do not have sufficiently high temperatures to match the observed\nV. High spin models appear able to do this as the intrinsic disc emperature is higher when including the additional inner disc radii rom R = (6\u20131.23) R g . Ho we ver, this higher temperature emission s strongly gravitationally redshifted on its way out to the observer, hich reduces the observed temperature back to something close to he low spin disc models. Pure disc models are then not able to match the observed outer disc mission at the highest masses once the self-consistent ray tracing is ncluded. Either the masses are wrong, or the standard disc models re wrong (or both). We examine each of these in turn below.\n.1 Changes to the standard disc emission\ne saw above that the models where the entire outer disc emitted warm Comptonization spectrum rather than (colour temperature orrected) blackbody enabled the accretion power to reach the highest V energies observed. Ho we ver, it requires a correlation of warm ith L / L Edd , such that the lowest L / L Edd AGN have hardest warm \u223c2 hile the highest L / L Edd have warm \u223c 3.5. This is certainly supported\nMNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nM\nFigure 14. The same as Fig. 13 , but with Comptonized disc models.

None the less, the warm omptonization models are the only disc based spectra that can atch the data from the highest mass QSO at lower luminosity. Alternatively, the accretion structure could be completely different o that expected from a disc. We based even our non-standard disc odels on the standard No viko v\u2013Thorne emissivity that assumes\nhat the \u03b1 viscosity remains constant across the disc. Yet it is tarting to become clear that hydrodynamic convection couples to he magnetic dynamo, strengthening the heating in conv ectiv ely urbulent regions (Jiang, Guillochon & Loeb 2016b ; Jiang & Blaes 020 ). Hydrodynamic convection could be triggered by the strong umps in opacity at 10 4 K from H, 10 4.6 \u22124.8 K from He and 0 5.2 K from iron (a blackbody at 10 4 peaks at 3000 \u00c5). Massive tars have similarly bright UV emission, and these also show trong winds, powered by UV line driving, as well as turbulent\nNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nonvection triggered by the continuum UV opacity (Jiang et al. 015 ; Ro 2019 ). Alternativ ely, conv ection could be triggered by the adiation pressure instability. This becomes more dominant at highest og( M BH /M ) though the expected dependence is rather slow, with r /P g = 7 . 3 \u00d7 10 9 m 1 / 4 9 m\u0307 2 \u03b11 / 4 r \u221221 / 8 . Either warm Comptonization of the outer disc, or a different ccretion structure potentially can work by shifting the emission o higher temperatures, so it peaks in the unobservable EUV part of he spectrum. The observed UV/optical emission is instead produced y re-processing of this EUV peak from dense material. The BLR ust subtend a substantial solid angle, and dense clouds within the LR can give a diffuse continuum (Korista & Goad 2001 ; Cackett t al. 2018 ; Korista & Goad 2019 ). There is also growing evidence or a dense clumpy wind on the inner edge of the BLR which again roduces predominantly diffuse continuum (free-free and boundree rather than lines; Kaastra et al. 2014 ; Miniutti et al. 2014 ). A redominantly reprocessed origin for the optical/UV is the easiest ay to explain its remarkably constant shape, as well as fitting in ith the longer timescale lags seen in the continuum reverberation ntensive monitoring campaigns.\nSource Mass (M )\nBoroson & Green ( 1992 ) 6.79 \u00d7 10 8 Buttiglione et al.

We test the robustness of the single poch virial mass estimates at high black hole masses using single poch spectra from 3C273, comparing them to the mass derived from he independent method of spatially resolving the broad-line region Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018 ). We obtained three independent ptical spectra of 3C273 spanning 20 yr from Boroson & Green 1992 ), Buttiglione et al. ( 2009 ), and Torrealba et al. ( 2012 ). We se the PYQSOFIT software package to measure the FWHM of the \u03b2 line profile, and the 5100 \u00c5 continuum luminosity, and derive ass from the scaling relations of Mej \u0301\u0131a-Restrepo et al. ( 2016 ) as or the SOUX AGN sample. These results are shown in Table 2 and how a spread of 0.69 dex, with a mean mass which is higher than he Gravity result. Thus, there could be a systematic o v erestimate f black hole mass, which could shift a source up between 1 and of our 0.5 dex bins. This could give a systematic effect as there re many more lower mass black holes than high mass ones, so umbers scattered to higher masses are not compensated by number f higher mass objects scattered down (e.g. Davis, Woo & Blaes 007 ). Ho we ver, the constant shape of the optical-UV continuum is bserved across 1.5\u20132 dex (4 bins) in M BH in the SOUX sample (see ig. 11 ) and 2\u20132.5 dex (5 bins) in M BH in the wider SDSS parameter pace (see Fig. B1 ). This would require an extremely large systematic hift in the mass estimation that seems unlikely given the number of ources used in the creation of the composite spectra. Such a shift ould have consequences for all black hole mass estimates. Based on this preliminary study, it is possible that there is a ystematic o v erestimation of M BH at high masses, but this is not ikely to be large enough to be the dominant factor causing the omogeneous optical-UV continuum shape that we observe. As the umber of AGN with a spatially resolved broad-line region increases, more robust test of single epoch virial black-hole mass estimates ill hopefully become possible. Aside from the possibility that the scaling relations are inaccurate,\nhe M BH values that we adopt from R20 could be contaminated, articularly where Mg II is utilized. This seems unlikely ho we ver, iven that R20 perform a subtraction of the UV Fe II emission by tting a velocity-broadened template, and that we perform a S/N ut. Even if a systematic overestimation in M BH due to some kind of ontamination existed in the masses quoted by R20 , it would doubtful e large enough to cause the shape of the optical-UV continuum to emain constant o v er 2\u20132.5 dex.\nFor the SOUX sample, there is a \u2248 60 per cent overestimation n the Mg II masses with respect to H \u03b2 masses in sources with both ines present. These masses were calculated in K23 using the scaling elations from Mej \u0301\u0131a-Restrepo et al. ( 2016 ). This only corresponds\ne demonstrate the advantages of studying a sample large enough to nvestigate population statistics, but based on available high-quality ultiwavelength data. This enables us to carry out detailed SED nalysis o v er a wide parameter space rather than for individual bjects. We stack spectra from our sample on a 2D grid in M BH and L 2500 .\nll AGNs in a single grid point should have the same black hole ass range and mass accretion rate (including uncertainties in black\nole mass estimates, and inclination angle) so that their spectra an be averaged with confidence that the objects are similar. We ompare the stacked SED in each grid point with the recent AGN ED model of KD18 , QSOSED . This model consists of an inner ot flow with fixed X-ray heating of L x = 0.02 L Edd (the maximum DAF luminosity). This condition determines the inner radius of he optically thick disc, R hot , and thermalization is assumed to be ncomplete out to R warm = 2 R hot , making the soft X-ray excess onnect to the UV downturn from warm Comptonization, before hermalizing to a blackbody from R warm to R sg .\nTo a reasonable degree, the model in each grid box matches well he observed stacked SED across the entire range of mass accretion ates for intermediate masses log( M BH /M ) = 7.5 \u22129.0. This is espite it not being fit to the optical or X-ray data. This is quite strong vidence that the underlying assumptions in QSOSED are a fairly good escription of the accretion flow, although to first order the X-ray flux s underpredicted by a factor of 2 at the lowest M BH . However, at he highest masses, log( M BH /M ) > 9, there is a clear discrepancy n the shape of the optical-UV continuum predicted by the QSOSED\nodels. This is very surprising, as this is the part of the spectrum ominated by the thermal disc, which is the part of QSOSED which as a solid theoretical basis. Instead, we remo v e the thermalized uter disc, so that all of the optically thick disc emission emerges as arm Comptonization. This component is poorly understood, so we rst use the same parameters as in QSOSED , ( warm = 2.5, kT e,warm = .2 keV) and fix R hot = 10 (equi v alent to L x = 0.07 L bol ). This ives a much better fit to the optical-UV continuum at high mass, ut now does not match well the lower mass bins which were well fit ith an outer standard disc. Allowing R hot to vary does not impro v e he fits. There is a systematic shift between any disc model (warm omptonized or thermal blackbody) and the optical-UV spectrum. ither the low M BH can be fit with a thermal outer disc, which misses he high M BH , or the high M BH can be fit with a warm Comptonized isc, which misses the low M BH . We examine this shift in more detail by constructing wide\nav elength co v erage composite SDSS spectra for each of the SOUX GN sample grid points. We combine together optical (low redshift) uasar spectra, with mass from H \u03b2 and UV (higher redshift) quasar pectra with mass from Mg II to produce a stacked spectrum in each rid point of log( M BH /M ) and L 3000 . These optical-UV composites re of higher quality than the original SOUX SDSS-OM composites s the UV is now based on spectra rather than photometry. They how the same shift with respect to the thermal or Comptonized disc odels (Fig. 9 ). Ho we ver, from these spectra we no w clearly see that he SED peak shift is present in the models, but is not seen in the actual ata. Furthermore, at a given luminosity the SDSS stacked spectra emain remarkably constant as a function of M BH (Fig. 11 ). All isc models are based on a size scale of the inner disc, irrespective of hether it is Comptonized or not, and this size scale increases as M BH\nMNRAS 524, 1796\u20131825 (2023)\nM\ni t 1 W s 1 s t b t 2 b o t i i t t c a\ns H t m d e c (\nc t l\nfl d t 2 B\nA\nJ S S s s a a S S a o S A S S\nc i h t\nF t r U\nt i f G f H o i I t ( ( S O v K M U U W\nX i E\nP 2\nD\nT t\nR\nA\nA A A A B B B\nC\nC\nC\nC C\nC\n1 http://www .astropy .org\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1796/7205290 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nncreases. This decreases the inner disc temperature until it peaks in he observable UV bandpass for the highest M BH in our sample. (Fig. 0 ). But the data show no sign of this predicted change (Fig. 11 ). e demonstrate this by fitting the pure blackbody disc models to pectra at constant L 3000 across four different mass bins (Figs 12 and 3 ). The only way to maintain the constant continuum shape is to ystematically increase the spin so as to mo v e the e xpected peak disc emperature abo v e the UV bandpass. While there could concei v ably e a physical connection between the most massive black holes and heir spins (e.g. Volonteri, Sikora & Lasota 2007 ; Fanidakis et al. 011 ; Griffin et al. 2019 ; Hu \u030csko et al. 2022 ) this requirement seems to e fine-tuned, especially as we use stacked spectra rather than single bjects. More fundamentally, such models are not self-consistent as hey only incorporate spin on the intrinsic disc emissivity, but do not nclude the general relativistic effects of ray tracing from the origin n the disc to the observer. Increasing the spin can succeed in fitting he highest mass spectra as it reduces the size scale of the inner disc, hereby increasing the peak temperature. But this is significantly ompensated by the increased gravitational redshift of the emission nd so the high spin models cannot fit the UV data.\nWe explore whether this could be due to mass estimates being ystematically biased so that M BH is o v erestimated at high M BH . o we ver, while this is possible, it seems unlikely to account for he magnitude of the effect we find. Therefore, we consider that it is ore likely the accretion structure is different than that shown by thin isc models, such that the \u2018disc\u2019 al w ays peaks in the EUV bandpass, ven at the highest black-hole masses. Reprocessing of this EUV omponent then gives the constant shape of the optical/UV spectrum see also Lawrence 2018 for the same idea based on variability).\nOne possible way to do this is if the outer disc is completely o v ered by warm Comptonizing material. But this also requires that he spectral index warm increases with L / L Edd , perhaps indicating a arger fraction of power is dissipated in the disc itself.\nInstead, there could be a more fundamental change in the accretion ow if the dissipation al w ays peak ed in the EUV region, perhaps ue to magneto-rotational instability coupling to the hydromagnetic urbulence generated by sharp changes in the opacity (Coleman et al. 016 ; Jiang, Davis & Stone 2016a ; Coleman et al. 2018 ; Jiang & laes 2020 ). We will explore these ideas further in subsequent papers.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nA J Mitchell and S Hagen acknowledge the support of the cience and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) studentship T/S505365/1 and S Hagen acknowledges the support of STFC tudentship ST/V506643/1.

The X-shooter spectra efined as the control sample in F a wcett et al. ( 2022 ), were separated nto the L 3 000 bins shown in Fig. B3 . A geometric composite was reated for any mass-luminosity bin containing more than one source nd individual spectra considered for bins only containing one object, hese spectra are shown in Fig. C1 .\nThe spectral shape of the X-shooter data spanning 1.5 dex in ass, are well matched across all luminosity bins to the shape of he SDSS composites displayed in Fig. B3 and plotted in grey in ig.
