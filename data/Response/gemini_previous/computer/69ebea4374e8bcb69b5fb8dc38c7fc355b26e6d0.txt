1. **Investigate the impact of different distance decay functions on the optimal location of the new facility.** The paper uses the power decay function, but other functions, such as the exponential decay function or the Gaussian decay function, could also be used. It would be interesting to see how the optimal location changes as the distance decay function is varied.


2. **Consider the case where multiple competing facilities may go out of business.** The paper only considers the case where one competing facility goes out of business. However, it is possible that multiple facilities could go out of business, which would further complicate the problem. It would be interesting to develop solution methods for this more general case.


3. **Incorporate other factors into the decision-making process.** The paper only considers the market share captured by the new facility. However, other factors, such as the cost of construction, the availability of labor, and the environmental impact, could also be considered. It would be interesting to develop decision-making methods that incorporate these other factors.


4. **Apply the proposed approach to other types of competitive facility location problems.** The paper focuses on the problem of locating a single new facility among a set of existing facilities. However, the proposed approach could also be applied to other types of competitive facility location problems, such as the problem of locating multiple new facilities or the problem of relocating existing facilities.


5. **Develop heuristic methods for solving large-scale instances of the problem.** The paper uses a branch and bound algorithm to solve the problem. However, this algorithm can be computationally expensive for large-scale instances of the problem. It would be interesting to develop heuristic methods that can solve large-scale instances of the problem more quickly.
