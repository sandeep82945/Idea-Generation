    "abstractText": "Red phosphorus (RP) is considered to be the most promising anode material for lithium-Ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity and suitable voltage platform. However, its poor electrical conductivity (10\u221212 S/m) and the large volume changes that accompany the cycling process severely limit its practical application. Herein, we have prepared fibrous red phosphorus (FP) that possesses better electrical conductivity (10\u22124 S/m) and a special structure by chemical vapor transport (CVT) to improve electrochemical performance as an anode material for LIBs. Compounding it with graphite (C) by a simple ball milling method, the composite material (FP-C) shows a high reversible specific capacity of 1621 mAh/g, excellent high-rate performance and long cycle life with a capacity of 742.4 mAh/g after 700 cycles at a high current density of 2 A/g, and coulombic efficiencies reaching almost 100% for each cycle.",

            "text": "With the growing urgency of the global energy crisis and environmental pollution, the development and application of clean energy must be vigorously promoted. Great progress has been made in sustainable energy technologies based on wind or solar energy. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient, safe and inexpensive energy storage technologies. Rechargeable (secondary) batteries are typically used in small to medium scale energy storage. Among these, LIBs have been utilized as the predominant power source of portable electronic devices due to their relatively high energy density, long life, lack of memory effects and environmental friendliness [1\u20133]. Recently, phosphorus (P) has turned out to be the most promising anode material candidate for LIBs with a high theoretical specific capacity (2596 mAh/g, based on the alloying process of P-LiP-Li2P-Li3P) [4]. The element phosphorus exists in three main forms: white phosphorus (WP), RP and black phosphorus (BP). Figure S1 shows the structures of different allotropes of phosphorus. WP is very unstable and flammable due to the weak bonding energy of tetrahedral P4, which is very dangerous and makes WP unsuitable for use in LIBs [5]. BP is also widely recognized for its high electrical conductivity (\u2212100 S/m, close to hard carbon) and its application in LIBs [6], but the difficulty of preparation and the high price of BP severely limit the commercialization of BP. Compared to WP and BP, RP is a more prospective commercial anode material that is not only cheaper but also environmentally friendly. However, there are two main challenges limiting the practical application of RP: (1) RP has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10\u221214 S/m and is\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13061060 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 2 of 11\nalmost non-conductive. (2) RP suffers from a huge volume expansion of about 300% during cycling [5,7\u20139]. These problems can lead to material fracture and pulverization of the red phosphorus material during cycling, as well as rapid capacity decay. To address these problems, many researchers have demonstrated the need to build microstructures and reduce the size of the active material to achieve fast kinetics. Park et al. [10] prepared phosphorus\u2013carbon composites by high-energy ball milling, which significantly improved the electrical conductivity of P and enabled its application in LIBs. Zhou et al. [11] successfully prepared hollow phosphorus nanospheres with porous shells and controlled diameters by a solvothermal method. The hollow nanosphere structures of these porous shells effectively adapt to volume changes and avoid the pulverization of active material, exhibiting excellent long-cycle performance in LIBs. Wang et al. [12] first compounded porous carbon with RP by the evaporation\u2013condensation method, resulting in a stable battery cycle of 55 turns. The evaporation\u2013condensation method is considered to be an effective strategy to address the large volume expansion caused by conductivity and lithiation. However, there are two important issues in the evaporative condensation approach; firstly, the low P mass loading (~30 wt%) in the carbon-based framework severely limits the energy density. Secondly [13,14], the residual WP can lead to safety issues of flammability and high toxicity [15,16]. To address the low P mass loading and safety issues, Zhang et al. [17] systematically investigated the interactions between P4 and various functional groups in carbon materials (Csurf, Cedge, C\u2212N\u22125, C\u2212N\u22121, C\u2212Ng, C\u2013S\u22125, C\u2212S\u22126, C\u2212S\u22126, C=O, C\u2212O\u2212C, C\u2212OH and COOH) and provided a structural design strategy for the carbon framework to build up the edge sp2 carbon atoms. These edge carbon atoms, in turn, provide high adsorption energy for P4 molecules through the strong P-C bonds. The RP-PC anodes they prepared exhibit extremely high P mass loading (close to the theoretical limit for loading), strong and stable P-C bonds, and significantly improved electron and Li+ transfer, resulting in excellent high-rate, long-cycle stability. Inspired by this previous work, we prepared FP materials by the CVT method in order to further improve the rate capability of P to Li storage. FP materials possess many electrochemical advantages: (1) the electrical conductivity of FP is 10\u22124 S/m (0.2 V), which is 8 orders of magnitude higher than that of commercial red phosphorus (RP) (10\u221212 S/m), and FP possesses better electrical conductivity compared to RP [18]. (2) FP is a 1-dimensional (1D) material, but it also possesses a 2-dimensional (2D) layered structure, and this 2D structure can effectively reduce the Li+ diffusion length and also enrich its electrochemical active center [19]. (3) FP can be reduced in size to the nanoscale by liquid phase exfoliation, and its small-enough size can effectively reduce the volume change of the material during cycling without structural damage [20]. The fibrous red phosphorus\u2013 graphite (FP-C) composite, prepared by FP with graphite by ball milling exhibited excellent cycling stability and high-rate performance, maintaining a high reversible specific capacity of 742.4 mAh/g after 700 cycles at high current densities."

            "text": "We prepared bulk FP by the low-temperature CVT method. As can be seen in Figure S2b, the addition of iodine (I2) causes the RP to nucleate and crystallize in the lowtemperature region of the quartz tube to form FP blocks that attach to the inner wall of the quartz tube. This suggests that I2 plays a transport and catalytic role throughout CVT. RP as a solid source and I2 as a sublimed mineralizer produce gaseous intermediate iodophosphorus compounds (PIx) in the sublimation zone when the temperature reaches the sublimation temperature, which are transported towards the deposition zone by the PIx partial pressure gradient [21]. The gaseous intermediate is converted to deposit products (FP) and releases mineralizer molecules. The released mineralizer molecules increase the partial pressure of the mineralizer in the deposition zone, thus they can transport back to the sublimation zone for further reactions until all the RP is converted to FP [22]. The bulks of FP (Figure S3) were ground and cleaned by ultrasonication with alcohol to remove I2 and\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 4 of 11\ndried by filtration to obtain FP powder. As shown in Figure S4, from optical microscope images of RP and FP powders, it is evident that RP is a deep red color, while FP appears orange-red. It can be seen that RP is a particle of approximately 40 \u00b5m in size, in contrast to FP which is a strip of fibers. There is a clear morphological difference between RP and FP, and RP can induce a transition from granular RP to one-dimensional fibrous FP after catalysis by I2. The FP was observed by SEM, as can be seen in Figure 1a, and the bulk FP after growth by CVT consisted of 50 \u00b5m long micron rods arranged neatly and showing a dispersive shape. A partial magnification of one end of one of the micrometer rods shows that the FP has a lamellar structure (Figure 1b). After ultrasonic exfoliation, the length and diameter of the FP powder were significantly shortened, both consisting of rods of a few tens of microns (Figure 1c). The morphology and structure of the FP nanoribbons were observed by TEM (Figure 1d), and it was found that the FP nanoribbons showed a lamellar shape. In the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Figure 1e), the lattice stripe spacing of 0.58 nm corresponded to the (001) plane in the vertical view. In addition, the surface of the FP nanoribbons is locally oxidized, which is consistent with the P-O bonding results appearing by XPS. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a single nanoribbon in Figure 1f shows that single-crystal FP nanoribbons were formed along the [141] axis.\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\npressure\u00a0gradient\u00a0 [21].\u00a0The\u00a0gaseous\u00a0

The XRD pattern of RP is a broad-peaked amorphous phase in the range of 12\u201318\u25e6 and 26\u201336\u25e6, corresponding to the characteristic peaks of commercial amorphous RP. The XRD peak of FP corresponds highly to the XRD diffraction peak of triclinic P. Also based on the study of Du et al. [23] for FP, it shows that the sample we prepared was 1D FP. In their study of FP, Liu et al. [19] found that FP also has a 2D band structure with a nanoribbon thickness of approximately 7.8 nm, which indicates that FP has not only a 1D structure but ls a 2D band structure. As can be seen from the structural diagram of FP (Figure 2a\u2013c), FP consis s of P-cage chains of P8 and P9 interconnected to form tubular structures, and the layers of these tubular structures are parallel to each other, with two tubular structures connected by two dumbbell-shaped p-atom structures. It should be noted that if the layers of the tubular structure are perpendicular to each other they are Hittorf\u2019s phosphorus (HP) or violet phosphorus (Figure S1), which also results in a high degree of similarity between the XRD and Raman spectrum of FP and HP [18]. Moreover, based on Winchester et al.\u2019s summary [24], the preparation of FP did not match with type II RP and matched best\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 5 of 11\nwith type IV RP. Figure 2b contrasts the Raman spectra of FP and RP in the frequency range of 200\u2013500 cm\u22121. It can be seen that RP has no obvious characteristic peaks, and only broad peaks appear in the range of 345\u2013365 cm\u22121, which mainly comes from the long-range disordered structure of polymeric phosphides, while the Raman spectra of FP show complex vibrational patterns, mainly due to the low symmetry of trigonal crystals and the diversity of atomic coordination. The peak at 368 cm\u22121 is the stretching vibration of the P8 phosphorus cage and the peak at 353 cm\u22121 is the stretching vibration peak of the P9 phosphorus cage [25]. XPS was used to perform compositional analysis of the FP powders. As shown in Figure 2c, the presence of element I2 was not detected in the XPS survey spectrum, suggesting that the addition of I2 only facilitated the transition from RP to FP and did not adulterate the FP. In addition, the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks at 130.0 eV and 131.4 eV, respectively, correspond to the P-P bond [18]. The peak at 134.7 eV corresponds to the P-O bond (Figure 2d), which indicates that FP undergoes oxidation in air, which is identical to the oxidative nature of BP [26,27].\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nthese\u00a0tubular\u00a0structures\u00a0are\u00a0parallel\u00a0to\u00a0each\u00a0other,\u00a0with\u00a0two\u00a0tubular\u00a0structures\u00a0connected\u00a0 by\u00a0 two\u00a0dumbbell-shaped\u00a0p-atom\u00a0structures.\u00a0 It\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0noted\u00a0 that\u00a0 if\u00a0 the\u00a0 layers\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 tubular\u00a0structure\u00a0are\u00a0perpendicular\u00a0to\u00a0each\u00a0other\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0Hittorf\u2019s\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0(HP)\u00a0or\u00a0 violet\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0(Figure\u00a0S1),\u00a0which\u00a0also\u00a0results\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0degree\u00a0of\u00a0similarity\u00a0between\u00a0 the\u00a0XRD\u00a0and\u00a0Raman\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0and\u00a0HP\u00a0[18].\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0Winchester\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u2019s\u00a0 summary\u00a0[24],\u00a0the\u00a0preparation\u00a0 f\u00a0FP\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0m tch\u00a0with\u00a0type\u00a0II\u00a0RP\u00a0and\u00a0matched\u00a0best\u00a0with\u00a0 type\u00a0IV\u00a0RP.\u00a0Figure\u00a02b\u00a0contrasts\u00a0the\u00a0Raman\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0and\u00a0RP\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0frequency\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a0 200\u2013500\u00a0cm\u22121.\u00a0It\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0that\u00a0RP\u00a0has\u00a0no\u00a0obvious\u00a0characteristic\u00a0peaks,\u00a0and\u00a0only\u00a0broad\u00a0 peaks\u00a0appear\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a0345\u2013365\u00a0cm\u22121,\u00a0which\u00a0mainly\u00a0comes\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0long-range\u00a0disordered\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0polymeric\u00a0phosphides,\u00a0while\u00a0the\u00a0Raman\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0show\u00a0complex\u00a0 vibrational\u00a0patterns,\u00a0mainly\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0low\u00a0symmetry\u00a0of\u00a0trigonal\u00a0crystals\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0diversity\u00a0 of\u00a0atomic\u00a0coordination.\u00a0The\u00a0peak\u00a0at\u00a0368\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0stretching\u00a0vibration\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0P8\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0cage\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0peak\u00a0at\u00a0353\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0stretching\u00a0vibration\u00a0peak\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0P9\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0 cage\u00a0[25].\u00a0XPS\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0perform\u00a0compositional\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0FP\u00a0powders.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a02c,\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0element\u00a0I2\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0detected\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0XPS\u00a0survey\u00a0spectrum,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0 that\u00a0the\u00a0addition\u00a0of\u00a0I2\u00a0only\u00a0 facilitated\u00a0the\u00a0transition\u00a0from\u00a0RP\u00a0to\u00a0FP\u00a0and\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0 adulterate\u00a0the\u00a0FP.\u00a0In\u00a0addition,\u00a0the\u00a02p1/2\u00a0and\u00a02p3/2\u00a0peaks\u00a0at\u00a0130.0\u00a0eV\u00a0and\u00a0131.4\u00a0eV,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0correspond\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0P-P\u00a0bond\u00a0[18].\u00a0The\u00a0peak\u00a0at\u00a0134.7\u00a0eV\u00a0corresponds\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0P-O\u00a0bond\u00a0 (Figure\u00a02d),\u00a0which\u00a0indicates\u00a0that\u00a0FP\u00a0undergoes\u00a0oxidation\u00a0in\u00a0air,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0identical\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0 oxidative\u00a0nature\u00a0of\u00a0BP\u00a0[26,27].\u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0Schematic\u00a0structural\u00a0view\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0along\u00a0the\u00a0a\u00a0(a),\u00a0b\u00a0(b)\u00a0and\u00a0c\u00a0(c);\u00a0(d)\u00a0XRD\u00a0curves\u00a0and\u00a0(e)\u00a0\nRaman\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0RP\u00a0and\u00a0FP;\u00a0(f)\u00a0XPS\u00a0survey\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0FP;\u00a0(g)\u00a0P2p\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0FP.\u00a0"

            "text": "FP-C and RP-C composites were prepared by ball milling FP and RP with graphite and characterized by XRD and Raman (Figure S5), and the electrochemical properties of the composites were studied. The lithiation and de-lithiation processes of FP-C and RP-C composites under half-cells were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, tested at a scan rate of 0.2 mV/s with a voltage window of 0.01\u20133 V. As shown in Figure 3b,c, a broad peak appeared at about 1 V during the first cathodic scan of the CV curve of FP-C,\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 6 of 11\nwhich is attributed to the formation of the SEI film of the solid electrolyte [28], and the subsequent broad peak is the lithiation process of the P-based material. Two peaks of approximately 1.1 V and 1.6 V appeared in the anode, corresponding to a de-lithiation process of the P-based material [29,30]. In the subsequent cycles, the cathode peak shifted to 0.6 V and the peak area increased, followed by a high overlap of the CV curves, indicating the high reversibility and stability of the FP-C negative electrode. In contrast, the anodic peak of the RP-C negative electrode decayed severely and the peak area decreased, which suggests severe polarization and low reversible stability of the RP-C negative electrode. It is noteworthy that the redox peak potentials of FP and RP are almost identical, which illustrates that the electrochemical properties of FP and RP as anode materials in LIBs are highly similar, but the electrochemical properties owing to their different structures show great differences. Figure 3d compares the cycling stability performance of FP and RP. FP-C shows excellent cycling stability and still holds a high specific capacity of 1621 mAh/g after 80 cycles, whereas the capacity of RP-C only remains at 494 mAh/g. The capacity of the RP-C electrode drops rapidly before 40 cycles, which is attributed to a rupture of the SEI film due to the huge volume expansion of RP during lithiation. The thicker SEI film creates such electrochemical segregation that the Li+ in the formed Li-P alloy cannot return to the Li metal to form dead Li+, while the larger volume expansion leads to pulverization of the active material, and this part of the P is no longer involved in the normal lithiation/delithiation process. The FP, however, may have a special 1D structure and nanoscale scale such that it does not continue to expand after a certain range of expansion [20], which results in the FP maintaining a very high reversible specific capacity after 80 cycles. It was observed that FP-C maintained a stable and high coulombic efficiency throughout the cycle, while the coulombic efficiency of RP-C fluctuated remarkably, which was attributed to the stable structure of FP-C (Figure 3a). The structural stability of the composite facilitates the stabilization of the SEI passivation layer during cycling (Figure S6), maintaining nearly 100% coulombic efficiency and excellent cyclability. Figure S6 shows that the FP remains a relatively intact structure after 20 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Figure 3c,f show the constant current charge/discharge curves for FP-C and RP-C at a current density of 0.2 mA/g. The hysteresis of the charge-discharge curve of RP-C increased significantly after cycling, rising to 1158 mV after 70 cycles, whereas the overpotential of FP-C was more stable and much lower than that of RP-C, at 338 mV after 70 cycles, a phenomenon that is highly consistent with the results of the CV curve. The high-rate capability is also an important indicator to evaluate the performance of the battery. Figure 3g displays that FP-C exhibits a higher-rate capability than RP-C in the current density range of 0.28\u20132 A/g. Specifically, the average reversible capacities of FP-C at current densities of 0.28, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2, 0.5 and 0.28 A/g were 1726, 1444, 1312, 1203, 1060, 1316 and 1638 mAh/g, respectively, while the average reversible capacities of RP-C were only 1116, 839, 661, 591, 449, 609 and 599 mAh/g, respectively. The contrast between the two is remarkable, as the reversible discharge capacity of RP-C is only 45% that of FP-C at a high current density of 2 A/g. After high multiplication cycles, when the current density returned to 0.28 mA/g, FP-C still had a specific capacity of 1401 mAh/g compared to 567 mAh/g for RP-C, indicating that FP-C exhibits excellent high-rate performance and fast response kinetics. It is noteworthy that the initial discharged capacity of FP-C is higher than that of RP-C in both the cycling test of low current density and the high-rate capability test. This may be due to the fact that the layered structure of FP allows Li+ to be embedded in the layers before the alloy reaction, similar to the insertion of BP into the layers before the alloy reaction [31], so that Li+ can alloy with more P atoms, while the 1D structure of FP allows Li+ to pass through faster [32]. Figure 3h shows that the reversible discharge capacity of FP-C remains at 742.4 mAh/g after 700 cycles at a high current density of 2 A/g, demonstrating the excellent high rate cycling stability performance of FP-C. Figure 3i and Table S1 show how this work compares to previous work, with the FP-C electrode exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance [5,6,12,17,32\u201342].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 7 of 11\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nity\u00a0test.\u00a0This\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0fact\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0layered\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0allows\u00a0Li+\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0embedded\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0layers\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0alloy\u00a0reaction,\u00a0similar\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0insertion\u00a0of\u00a0BP\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0layers\u00a0 before\u00a0the\u00a0alloy\u00a0reaction\u00a0[31],\u00a0so\u00a0that\u00a0Li+\u00a0can\u00a0alloy\u00a0with\u00a0more\u00a0P\u00a0atoms,\u00a0while\u00a0the\u00a01D\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0allows\u00a0Li+\u00a0to\u00a0pass\u00a0through\u00a0faster\u00a0[32].\u00a0Figure\u00a03h\u00a0shows\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0reversible\u00a0discharge\u00a0capacity\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0remains\u00a0at\u00a0742.4\u00a0mAh/g\u00a0after\u00a0700\u00a0cycles\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0current\u00a0density\u00a0 of\u00a02\u00a0A/g,\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the\u00a0excellent\u00a0high\u00a0rate\u00a0cycling\u00a0stability\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C.\u00a0Figure\u00a03i\u00a0and\u00a0Table\u00a0S1\u00a0show\u00a0how\u00a0this\u00a0work\u00a0compares\u00a0to\u00a0previous\u00a0work,\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0FP-C\u00a0electrode\u00a0exhibiting\u00a0excellent\u00a0electrochemical\u00a0performance\u00a0[5,6,12,17,32\u201342].\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0Electrochemical\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0RP-C\u00a0and\u00a0FP-C\u00a0electrodes\u00a0for\u00a0LIBs.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Schematic\u00a0illustra-\ntion\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0button\u00a0cell.\u00a0(b,c)\u00a0CV\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0anodes\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0scan\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a00.2\u00a0mV/s\u00a0\nbetween\u00a00.01\u00a0and\u00a03.0\u00a0V\u00a0vs.\u00a0Li+/Li.\u00a0Cycling\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0anodes\u00a0for\u00a080\u00a0cycles\u00a0at\u00a00.2\u00a0A/g\u00a0\n(d)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0voltage\u00a0profiles\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0(e)\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0(f).\u00a0(g)\u00a0Rate\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0\nand\u00a0RP-C\u00a0anodes\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0varied\u00a0rate\u00a0from\u00a00.28\u00a0A/g\u00a0to\u00a02\u00a0A/g.\u00a0(h)\u00a0Capacity\u00a0and\u00a0coulombic\u00a0efficiency\u00a0\nduring\u00a0cycling\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0FP-C\u00a0anode\u00a0at\u00a02\u00a0A/g\u00a0after\u00a05\u00a0initial\u00a0cycles\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0low\u00a0current\u00a0density\u00a0of\u00a00.2\u00a0A/g.\u00a0\nWe prepared BP-C composites using the same method and investigated their cyclic stability and high-rate capability. As can be seen from Figure S7, the remaining reversible capacity of the BP-C negative electrode after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A/g is 1555.7 mAh/g, a lower rate than that of the FP-C (1621 mAh/g). However, BP-C performed well in terms of high-rate capability with an average reversible capacity of 1250.13 mAh/g at a high current density of 2 A/g, compared to 1060 mAh/g for FP-C, suggesting that FP has better cycling stability compared to BP, and BP has better high-rate performance. The higher conductivity (100 S/m) of BP also contributes to the better high-rate performance of\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 8 of 11\nBP, which can be attributed to the special 1D structure of FP that allows FP-C to exhibit better cycling stability. Although the conductivity of FP is 8 orders of magnitude better than that of RP, the conductivity of FP is still lower than that of BP, indicating that FP is more suitable for energy storage applications than BP, while BP is more suitable for power battery applications. The kinetic factors were further investigated on the electrochemical performance by testing the CV of FP-C and RP-C at a series of scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mV/s, as shown in Figure 4a,b. The peak potentials of the CV curves for both FP-C and RP-C electrodes rise with increasing scan rate and cover the potential range of the lower scan rate, which also indicates the capacitive behavior of both FP-C and RP-C electrodes. According to equations 1 and 2 [36], there is a power law relationship between the peak current of the CV curve and the scan rate, and the electrochemical reactions can be divided into diffusion-Controlled interactions and capacitive processes.\ni = a\u03bdb (1)\nlog(i) = blog(\u03bd) + log(a) (2)\nwhere i is the peak current (mA), v is the scan rate (mV/s) and a and b are adjustable parameters.\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe\u00a0tendency\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0battery\u00a0capacity\u00a0to\u00a0decay\u00a0decreases\u00a0in\u00a020\u00a0cycles\u00a0and\u00a0becomes\u00a0more\u00a0 stable\u00a0inside\u00a0the\u00a0battery\u00a0at\u00a040\u00a0cycles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0Electrochemical\u00a0reaction\u00a0kinetics\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0electrodes\u00a0for\u00a0LIBs.\u00a0CV\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0\n(a)\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0(b)\u00a0at\u00a0various\u00a0scan\u00a0rates\u00a0from\u00a00.1\u00a0to\u00a01.0\u00a0mV/s\u00a0for\u00a0LIBs.\u00a0(c)\u00a0Log\u00a0(peak\u00a0current)-log\u00a0(scan\u00a0\nrate)\u00a0curves\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0observed\u00a0cathodic\u00a0and\u00a0anodic\u00a0peaks\u00a0in\u00a0(a,b).\u00a0EIS\u00a0Nyquist\u00a0plots\u00a0of\u00a0fresh\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0\nRP-C\u00a0electrodes\u00a0(d).\u00a0EIS\u00a0Nyquist\u00a0plots\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0(e)\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0(f)\u00a0electrodes\u00a0were\u00a0tested\u00a0after\u00a010,\u00a020,\u00a0\nand\u00a040\u00a0cycles\u00a0at\u00a00.2\u00a0A/g.\u00a0Equivalent\u00a0circuit\u00a0(g)\u00a0corresponding\u00a0to\u00a0(d)\u00a0EIS\u00a0spectra.\u00a0(h)\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0equivalent\u00a0\ncircuit\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0EIS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0(e,f).\u00a0\n4.\u00a0Conclusions\u00a0 In\u00a0conclusion,\u00a0we\u00a0have\u00a0prepared\u00a0FP\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0low-temperature\u00a0CVT\u00a0method.\u00a0FP\u00a0significantly\u00a0increases\u00a0its\u00a0electrochemical\u00a0performance\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0P\u00a0anode\u00a0electrode\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0its\u00a0special\u00a0 structure\u00a0and\u00a0high\u00a0electrical\u00a0conductivity.\u00a0While\u00a0FP\u00a0was\u00a0prepared\u00a0with\u00a0C\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0ball\u00a0milling\u00a0method\u00a0to\u00a0produce\u00a0FP-C\u00a0composites,\u00a0the\u00a0composites\u00a0exhibited\u00a0much\u00a0better\u00a0electrochemical\u00a0performance\u00a0with\u00a0excellent\u00a0cycle\u00a0stability\u00a0and\u00a0multiplicative\u00a0properties\u00a0than\u00a0RPC.\u00a0The\u00a0design\u00a0strategy\u00a0of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0offers\u00a0great\u00a0guidance\u00a0implications\u00a0for\u00a0achieving\u00a0mass-produced\u00a0and\u00a0high-performance\u00a0P-based\u00a0negative\u00a0electrodes.\u00a0\nSupplementary\u00a0 Materials:\u00a0 The\u00a0 following\u00a0 supporting\u00a0 information\u00a0 can\u00a0 be\u00a0 downloaded\u00a0 at:\u00a0 www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1.\u00a0Table\u00a0S1:\u00a0Comparison\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0electrochemical\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0work\u00a0with\u00a0 that\u00a0of\u00a0previous\u00a0phosphorus-based\u00a0LIBs.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S1.\u00a0Schematic\u00a0structures\u00a0of\u00a0different\u00a0allotropes\u00a0of\u00a0 phosphorus.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S2:\u00a0Optical\u00a0photographs\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0quartz\u00a0tube\u00a0reactor\u00a0after\u00a0the\u00a0reaction\u00a0(a)\u00a0without\u00a0 I2,\u00a0(b)\u00a0with\u00a0I2.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S3:\u00a0Optical\u00a0photographs\u00a0of\u00a0FP\u00a0bulk\u00a0lumps.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S4:\u00a0Optical\u00a0photographs\u00a0of\u00a0 filamentous\u00a0red\u00a0phosphorus.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S5:\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0composites\u2019\u00a0(a)\u00a0XRD\u00a0diagram\u00a0(b)\u00a0Raman\u00a0 spectra.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S6.\u00a0SEM\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0FP-C\u00a0electrodes\u00a0in\u00a0LIBs\u00a0after\u00a020\u00a0cycles\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0current\u00a0density\u00a0of\u00a0 0.5\u00a0A/g.\u00a0Figure\u00a0S7:\u00a0(a)\u00a0Cycling\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0BP-C\u00a0anodes\u00a0for\u00a080\u00a0cycles\u00a0at\u00a00.2\u00a0A/g.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Rate\u00a0performance\u00a0 of\u00a0FP-C\u00a0and\u00a0RP-C\u00a0anodes\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0varied\u00a0rate\u00a0from\u00a00.28\u00a0A/g\u00a0to\u00a02\u00a0A/g.\u00a0\nFigure 4.

Simi arly, the b\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1060 9 of 11\nvalues of 0.516 and 0.757 for the anode and cathode of RP-C, respectively, suggest that the capacity of both FP-C and RP-C are diffusion-Controlled alloy reactions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to interpret the detailed electrochemical reaction kinetics. Figure 4d\u2013f show the EIS spectra of FP-C and RP-C electrodes after testing at 0, 10, 20, and 40 cycles turns at a current density of 0.2 A/g. All Nyquist plots consist of a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a line in the low-frequency region, representing the charge transfer process and Li+ diffusion in the solid state, respectively. The equivalent circuits corresponding to the impedance data include the electrolyte and electrode ohmic resistance (Re), the SEI film resistance (RSEI), the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the parallel constant phase element (CPE), as well as the Warburg impedance (Wo). The fresh RP-C electrode had an Rct of ~4750 \u2126, while the FP-C electrode had an Rct of ~2035 \u2126, showing the higher electronic conductivity of the FP-C. As shown in the graphs of turn 10 versus turn 20 of the cycle, the Rct of both the RP-C and FP-C electrode decrease to a small stable value, indicating that a stable interface is formed between the electrolyte and the electrode (Figure 4e,f), while the Rct of the RP-C is slightly larger than that of the FP-C. However, at the 40th cycle, the FP-C and RP-C show a more distinct difference, with the RP-C electrode having a higher internal cell resistance and being heavily polarized, corresponding to the cycle performance test in Figure 3d, which coincides with the time of maximum cell capacity decay. In the case of the FP-C electrode, the tendency for the battery capacity to decay decreases in 20 cycles and becomes more stable inside the battery at 40 cycles."

FP significantly increases its electrochemical performance as a P anode electrode due to its special structure and high electrical conductivity. While FP was prepared with C by the ball milling method to produce FP-C composites, the composites exhibited much better electrochemical performance with excellent cycle stability and multiplicative properties than RP-C. The design strategy of FP-C offers great guidance implications for achieving mass-produced and high-performance P-based negative electrodes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano13061060/s1.
