            "text": "Riluzole is an anti-glutamate drug that has been used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) since it was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1996 (RILUTEK\u00ae, tablets) (Fehlings et al., 2021). ALS is a rare disease in which patients typically have a survival of only 3\u20135 years, due to respiratory failure (Grad et al., 2017). In addition, riluzole is the the only oral drug for ALS treatment in China that can prolong the survival of patients by approximately 3 months (Miller et al., 2012). However, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of riluzole in Chinese ALS patients are unknown. Therefore, the goal is to establish a simple method for determining riluzole in humans, which is convenient for the subsequent construction of population pharmacokinetics (popPK) models of Chinese ALS patients to describe their pharmacokinetics characteristics (Bruno et al., 1997).\nSo far, several methods have been reported for quantitative determination of riluzole in plasma (Sarkar et al., 2017; Chandu et al., 2010; Chow et al., 2012; Le Liboux et al., 1997; van Kan et al., 2004). These methods used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection or ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/ MS). The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of the HPLC-UV methods described by Le Liboux, van Kan HJ, and Chow DS were 10 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 20 ng/mL, respectively, and all required large amounts of human plasma (1 mL, 500 \u03bcL, and 200 \u03bcL) (Chow et al., 2012; Le Liboux et al., 1997; van Kan et al., 2004). More recently, Mahua Sarkar and Chandu BR developed the UPLC-MS/\nMSmethod for the riluzole assay in human plasma with an LLOQ of 0.5 ng/mL, but all required 200 \u03bcL human plasma (Chandu et al., 2010; Sarkar et al., 2017). In addition, the pre-treatment processes for these methods were all liquid\u2013liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction (SPE), which were considered complex.\nIn this paper, a novel UPLC-MS/MSmethod was developed. The plasma sample was prepared using protein precipitation, which was simpler than liquid\u2013liquid extraction or SPE, the analytes were highly efficient in a relatively short time on the T3 column, and the volume of the plasma sample used was small. The combination of the three features resulted in a robust and high-throughput analysis method. In addition, the validated analytical method was successfully applied to the quantitative determination of riluzole in Chinese ALS patients."

Finally, the proportion of formic acid in water was switched back to 95% in 0.5 min and held for 0.5 min before the next run. The flow rate was fixed at 0.3 mL/min.

In each analysis batch, the QC assessment for each concentration level was repeated six times. Relative standard deviation (RSD) and relative error (RE) were used to indicate precision and accuracy, respectively. In addition to LLOQ, the other three concentration levels of QCs\u2019 intra-batch and inter-batch RSD should be \u2264 15% and RE should be within \u00b115%, while LLOQs\u2019 inter-batch and intra-batch RSD should be <20% and RE should be within \u00b120%.\nThe linearity response of riluzole was assessed over calibration ranges. The calibration curve was performed with eight concentrations, and the requirements were the same as those given in Section 2.6.\nStability assessment of the riluzole in a stock solution included long-term stability and short-term stability. However, according to the certificate of analysis (COA) of riluzole, the riluzole solution can be stored for up to 6 months at \u221280\u00b0C, and the short-term stability was evaluated by keeping it at room temperature for 5 h. The IS was diluted when it would be used.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03\nStability assessment of the analyte in plasma and whole blood included short-term stability, autosampler stability, freeze\u2013thaw stability, whole blood stability, and long-term stability. Shortterm stability was evaluated by measuring QCs maintained at room temperature for 4 h. Autosampler stability was achieved by analyzing the processed QCs that had been held in the autosampler (10\u00b0C) for 24 h. The freeze\u2013thaw stability was evaluated after seven freeze (\u221280\u00b0C) and thawing (room temperature) cycles before QC sample preparation. Whole blood QCs were kept at room temperature for 4 h to assess the whole blood stability. Longterm stability was assessed by analyzing QCs after storage for 26 days at \u221280\u00b0C.\nExtraction recovery was evaluated by comparing the peak areas of the analyte extracted from the three-level QC samples with those of post-extraction spiked QC samples at the same concentrations. The RSD of the extraction should be \u2264 15%; the RE should be within \u00b115%.\nMatrix effects were assessed using low-, medium-, and high-level QCs from six individuals. Matrix factors were evaluated by calculating the peak area\u2019s ratio of the presence of the matrix (measured by analyzing the blank matrix spiked with the analyte after extraction) to the absence of the matrix (pure solution of the analyte). The RSD of the matrix effect should be \u2264 15%."

Exclusion criteria: 1) the duration of medication could not be determined; 2) elderly patients (\u226580 years of age) with poor basic condition and many influencing factors are difficult to evaluate; 3) had taken clobazam within 1 month. Since riluzole reached a steady state in enrolled patients, a blood sample was collected from each patient at a random time point, and the last time of medication before blood collection, the time of blood collection, and demographic information about the patients were accurately recorded. All blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain plasma samples, which were stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis."

We tried atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and ESI source in positive and negative ionization modes. Usually, positive ionization is the preferred ionization mode for the detection of neutral or basic analytes.\nThe results show that the ESI source has higher ionization efficiency in the positive ionization mode, which may be related to the presence of the amine group in the molecular structure of riluzole.\nAn apposite MRM transition of riluzole and IS was selected based on the ion spectrum of the analyte product. In addition, the voltage and gas parameters were adjusted to obtain the most suitable ionization and fragmentation conditions."

In addition, under the chromatographic conditions described herein, effective chromatographic separation guaranteed the accurate determination of riluzole within a running time of 5 min."

            "text": "Protein precipitation, liquid\u2013liquid extraction, and SPE are the most common sample pre-treatment methods. Previously reported pre-treatment methods of riluzole samples were liquid\u2013liquid extraction or SPE, which were considered too complicated. Therefore, our study explored the selection of plasma volume, the proportion of the precipitant to plasma, and whether to dilute the supernatant. The results showed that the response of riluzole was appropriate when the volume of the plasma sample was 50 \u03bcL, the acetonitrile-to-plasma ratio was 4:1, and 50 \u03bcL of the supernatant was diluted with 450 \u03bcL solution. If the supernatant was not diluted, the response of the ULOQ sample (800 ng/mL) will exceed the highest response of the machine. In the process of exploration, in order to save clinical samples, we tried to take only 5 \u03bcL plasma and added 20 \u03bcL acetonitrile in the ratio of 1: 4 for protein precipitation, but the standards and QCs\u2019 bias did not meet the requirements. In addition, the dilution of the supernatant with different proportions of water\u2013acetonitrile and whether to add 0.1% formic acid were studied. The response of riluzole was appropriate when water\u2013acetonitrile (v: v = 95:5) was chosen as a diluent, and there was no effect on the results irrespective of adding 0.1% formic acid in water\u2013acetonitrile (v: v = 95:5), so we chose the simpler water\u2013acetonitrile (v: v = 95:5) as a diluent.\nIn addition, we tried different collision energies, and each analyte obtained three different daughter ions, namely, m/z 234.977\u2192166.031 (28 V), 234.977\u2192149.764 (30 V), and 234.977\u2192138.053 (34 V) for riluzole and m/z 301.006\u2192224.04 (32 V), 301.006\u2192153.064 (36 V), and 301.006\u2192105.110 (34 V) for clobazam. We compared their response, peak shape, and carryover after sample preparation under the corresponding chromatographic conditions. Finally, the product ion spectra were obtained (Figure 1) to select the transitions of the analyte (riluzole, 234.977\u2192166.031) and the IS (clobazam, m/z 301.006\u2192224.040).\nAll in all, the time and effort required to prepare samples using protein precipitation is significantly reduced compared to that taken by liquid\u2013liquid extraction or SPE reported so far. In addition, the relatively short running time of the method (5 min) and the plasma\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04\nvolume used (50 \u03bcL) is much smaller than that of the published works (200 \u03bcL\u20131 mL), making it ideal for drug analysis in the clinical setting (Sarkar et al., 2017; Chandu et al., 2010; Chow et al., 2012; Le Liboux et al., 1997; van Kan et al., 2004)."

As a result, the peak area of carryover was approximately 10% of the peak area at LLOQ throughout method validation, which met the requirements.\nThe concentration of LLOQ was 5 ng/mL.

            "text": "The UPLC-MS/MS method was successfully applied to determine the steady-state concentration of riluzole in ALS patients treated with riluzole for at least 1 month. So far, 10 plasma samples from 10 ALS patients have been successfully analyzed, and no notable problems have occurred during the whole analysis, such as changes in retention time and interference. Table 5 shows the concentrations of 10 subjects who received riluzole. At present, steady-state trough concentrations were collected for patients 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10, and the collection time points for other patients were in the elimination phase. According to (Bruno et al. 1997), the steady-state trough concentration of patients with SCI after taking riluzole ranged from 11.17 to 147.55 ng/mL. The concentrations of the five samples that had reached the steady state in our experiments\nwere 20.6, 37, 16, 37.4, and 58 ng/mL, respectively, which were consistent with the range of SCI patients. Of course, further verification of large samples was needed. Therefore, based on the current results, 5 ng/mL was a suitable LLOQ. At the same time, considering the range of steady-state peak concentration of riluzole reported in foreign patients with SCI (Bruno et al., 1997), the ULOQ is also appropriate in order to continue the determination of subsequent collected samples, including those with around peak concentration. In general, the range of the standard curve in our method was suitable for the clinical setting. We will further establish popPK of riluzole in Chinese ALS patients after measuring the samples collected later and compare its pharmacokinetic characteristics with those of foreign patients with ALS or SCI (Bruno et al., 1997).\nIn addition, as the disease progresses, swallowing difficulties may gradually appear in ALS patients, resulting in an inability to take oral riluzole tablets. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07\ndevoted themselves to the development of new dosage forms of riluzole, such as suspension and oral films (Wymer et al., 2023). The simple method was established for the determination of riluzole concentration, which was convenient for other groups to refer to, and can be applied in the study of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of new forms of riluzole."

Compared with other reported analytical methods, our method has the advantages of simple sample preparation, relatively short running time, and small plasma sample volume. Considering the high-throughput potential of our method, it can be easy to analyze patient samples in the clinical setting or clinical trials. At the same time, this was the first published method used to determine the riluzole concentration of Chinese ALS patients, and the first to report the stability data of riluzole in whole blood, which is conducive to the development of subsequent studies related to the pharmacokinetics of riluzole."
