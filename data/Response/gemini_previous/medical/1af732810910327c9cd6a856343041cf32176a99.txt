1. **Investigate the effectiveness of the FBGT and FAGT methods on datasets with different characteristics.** The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the FBGT and FAGT methods on two specific datasets, ISIC-2016 and HAM10000. Future research could explore the performance of these methods on datasets with varying characteristics, such as different image sizes, resolutions, and levels of noise. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of the proposed methods.


2. **Explore the use of the FBGT and FAGT methods in other medical image analysis tasks.** The paper focuses on the application of the FBGT and FAGT methods to skin lesion classification. Future research could investigate the effectiveness of these methods in other medical image analysis tasks, such as disease diagnosis, organ segmentation, and treatment planning. This would demonstrate the versatility of the proposed methods and their potential impact on a wider range of medical applications.


3. **Develop more sophisticated similarity calculation algorithms.** The CosSIF algorithm, which is the foundation of the FBGT and FAGT methods, utilizes cosine similarity as the primary metric for similarity calculation. Future research could explore the development of more sophisticated similarity calculation algorithms that incorporate additional image features and characteristics. This could potentially lead to improved filtering performance and even better classification accuracy.


4. **Investigate the impact of the FBGT and FAGT methods on the performance of different deep learning models.** The paper evaluates the performance of the FBGT and FAGT methods using a limited number of deep learning models, including Swin Transformer, ViT, and ConvNeXt. Future research could investigate the impact of these methods on a wider range of deep learning models, including different architectures, hyperparameter settings, and training strategies. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the compatibility of the proposed methods with various deep learning models.


5. **Explore the potential of the FBGT and FAGT methods for improving the performance of other oversampling techniques.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the FBGT and FAGT methods in improving the performance of GAN-based oversampling. Future research could investigate the potential of these methods for enhancing the performance of other oversampling techniques, such as random oversampling, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN). This could lead to the development of more robust and effective oversampling strategies for addressing class imbalance in medical image datasets.
