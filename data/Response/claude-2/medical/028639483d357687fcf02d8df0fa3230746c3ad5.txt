 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct field trials with the different backcross populations in sandy and wet soil environments to validate the rhizobox findings and determine if root architecture correlates with productivity and resource efficiency. 

2. Examine the anatomical structure of the roots (e.g. xylem vessel diameter, root cortical aerenchyma) to understand the physiological mechanisms behind differences in hydraulic conductivity.

3. Analyze root exudates and microbial communities associated with each backcross to determine if root architecture influences rhizosphere interactions. 

4. Perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to identify genetic regions controlling root architectural traits that could be used in marker-assisted breeding.

5. Study graft compatibility between the backcross rootstocks and commercial scion cultivars to ensure horticultural viability.
