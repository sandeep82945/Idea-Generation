    "abstractText": "The current experimental data allow for a sub-TeV colorless weak-singlet scalar or pseudoscalar. If such a singlet field is present together with TeV-range vectorlike top and bottom partners, there is a possibility that the heavy quarks decay dominantly to the singlet state and a third-generation quark, and the singlet state decays to quark and boson pairs. Such a possibility may arise in various models but it has not been explored experimentally, especially in the context of vectorlike-quark searches. We consider some minimal models, covering the possible weak representations of the top and bottom partners, that can be mapped to many well-motivated ultraviolet-complete theories. We chart out the possible interesting and unexplored signatures of the exotic decay of vectorlike quarks and identify benchmark points representing different signal topologies for the high luminosity LHC. We perform a general scan of the parameter space with the relevant direct search bounds and find that large regions, which do not require any fine-tuning, remain open for the unexplored channels. We also perform a simple projection study in the cleanest channel and indicate how other new but experimentally challenging channels can be used to probe more regions of the parameter space.",

If such a singlet field is present together with TeV-range vectorlike top and bottom partners, there is a possibility that the heavy quarks decay dominantly to the singlet state and a third-generation quark, and the singlet state decays to quark and boson pairs. Such a possibility may arise in various models but it has not been explored experimentally, especially in the context of vectorlike-quark searches. We consider some minimal models, covering the possible weak representations of the top and bottom partners, that can be mapped to many well-motivated ultraviolet-complete theories. We chart out the possible interesting and unexplored signatures of the exotic decay of vectorlike quarks and identify benchmark points representing different signal topologies for the high luminosity LHC. We perform a general scan of the parameter space with the relevant direct search bounds and find that large regions, which do not require any fine-tuning, remain open for the unexplored channels. We also perform a simple projection study in the cleanest channel and indicate how other new but experimentally challenging channels can be used to probe more regions of the parameter space.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.095014\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTeV-scale vectorlike quarks (VLQs) are an essential ingredient of many new physics models. Because of their vectorlike nature, they do not contribute to the gauge anomalies and are less restricted than their chiral counterparts by the current experimental data. Ones that couple with the third-generation quarks (top and bottom partners, we shall collectively refer to them as top partners) appear in composite Higgs models with a partially composite top quark [1\u20136], extra-dimensional models [7\u201312], Little-Higgs models [13\u201316], etc. However, in the last few years, an extensive direct search program at the LHC has gradually tightened the mass bounds on these quarks. For top partners like the T quark (with electromagnetic charge 2=3) or the B quark (with charge \u22121=3), the current exclusion limit stands as high as \u223c1.5 TeV [17\u201321].\nDirect VLQ searches generally assume that they decay exclusively to StandardModel (SM) particles, i.e., to a thirdgeneration quark and a heavy vector boson or a Higgs. However, this assumption need not hold in general, especially if one looks beyond the minimal models where the top partners can have new decay modes. For example, a top partner can decay to another heavy quark or a new boson [11,22\u201345]. A possibility that has attracted some interest in the current literature is that a vectorlike top partner decays to a new spinless state singlet under the SM gauge group [i.e., \u00f01; 1; 0\u00de under SU\u00f03\u00dec \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00deL \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00deY] and a thirdgeneration quark. The singlet state could be a naturally arising pseudoscalar in the nonminimal composite Higgs models [23,46], a dark matter candidate [24], or just an extra scalar [22]. One can also achieve such a setup from a bottomup perspective by extending the Higgs and top sectors of the SM. For example, one can add VLQs in two-Higgs-doublet models [37]. There even have been some claims in the literature that the currentLHCdata points to the existence of a sub-TeV spinless state mainly coupling with the thirdgeneration fermions (see, e.g., [47\u201351]). For the LHC phenomenology of the top-partner models, the addition of a singlet state looks interesting from two perspectives. First, in most well-motivated models (e.g., the ones addressing the gauge hierarchy problem), these quarks are supposed to be not much heavier than a TeV. Hence, the possibility of evading the experimental bounds with a new *akanksha.bhardwaj@glasgow.ac.uk \u2020tanumoy@iisertvm.ac.in \u2021subhadip.mitra@iiit.ac.in \u00a7cyrin.neeraj@research.iiit.ac.in Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In other words, instead of giving up on the models, the strong bounds can be taken as a motivation for considering next-to-minimal (but otherwise well-motivated) models with TeV-scale particles. Second, a new lighter-than-TeV singlet (pseudo)scalar allowed by the current data leads to a host of new possibilities to probe the top partners. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the above points and sketch a road map for how these possibilities can be explored at the LHC. We consider some simple phenomenological models based on the possible weak representations of the top partners to describe their interactions with a singlet scalar \u03d5 or a pseudoscalar \u03b7. With these generic models, we recast the latest LHC limits on T and B to see how low the limits can go with the increasing branching ratio (BR) in the extra modes and how that affects the model parameters. For simplicity, we assume \u03a6 \u00bc f\u03d5; \u03b7g has exclusive couplings only with the top partners initially. However, since the heavy quarks mix with their SM partners after electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB),\u03a6 can decay to qq final states at the tree level. Moreover, depending on its mass, it can also decay to gauge boson pairs through quark loops. Even though \u03a6 has no direct couplings with the light quarks, it can still be produced directly at the LHC through the loopmediated gg \u2192 \u03a6 process. This allows us to put limits on the \u03a6gg coupling. Taking these (and the other applicable) bounds into account, we perform a parameter scan on these generic models to show that there is no need to fine-tune the parameters to satisfy the bounds. Since our parametrization is generic, the parameters easily relate to a broad class of complete models. We chart out the interesting signal topologies that the new decay mode could lead to and, for a fixed heavy-quark mass scale, present a sample set of benchmark points leading to different decay topologies. We also explain the intuitions behind the choice of parameter points so that one can choose a similar set of parameters for a different heavy-quark mass. The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we present the generic parametrization of the phenomenological models. In Sec. III, we work out the parameter relations and the decays, in Sec. IV we present the bounds and parameter scans, and in Sec. V we discuss the possible new topologies, the benchmark set and a simple projection study for the T in the t\u03b3\u03b3 mode at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Finally, we conclude in Sec. VI."

However, since the singlet \u03a6 is present in our case, the top partners must be weak singlets or form a weak doublet to make their interaction with\u03a6 and the SM quarks gauge invariant. Therefore, we consider two types of models: one with one weak-singlet vectorlike top partner (either T or B) and a \u03a6, and the other with a weak doublet of T and B and a \u03a6. We look into the possibilities\nseparately. We assume the weak singlet \u03a6 does not acquire a vacuum expectation value and has no direct mixing with the SM Higgs."

In the plots, we only show the scalar \u03d5, but one gets similar plots for \u03b7. In the following sections, we show that the model parameter space that yields high branching for the new decay channels of the heavy quarks does not require any fine tuning, i.e., it is quite open."

            "text": "We are interested in the parameter region(s) where the q2 \u2192 q1\u03a6 decay is significant. Equations (18) and (21) indicate that it is possible to get high BR for q2 \u2192 q1\u03a6 decay channel for a sizeable \u03bba;b\u03a6q2 or \u03bb a;b \u03a6D. However a large \u03bba;b\u03a6q2 or \u03bb a;b \u03a6D would enhance the gg \u2192 \u03a6 production at the LHC and, hence, might be constrained. We look into the bounds on \u03a6 parameters and the mass bounds on the heavy quarks for the LHC limits on these models. If M\u03a6 > 2mq, \u03a6 decays to qq\u0304 states. This mode often becomes significant [note that the coupling of\u03a6 to q is suppressed by the sine(s) of the mixing angle(s)]. However, of all the decay modes of \u03a6, the diphoton mode offers one of the cleanest signals in the entire mass range of \u03a6 in all models [56\u201358]; we use it to put bounds on \u03a6 parameters. So far, there have been several searches for heavy resonances decaying to two photons from the ATLAS [59,60] and CMS [61,62] Collaborations. We use the latest\nATLAS search data [59] to recast the bounds. Since we are interested in top partners heavier than \u03a6, we can consider the following five-dimensional effective Lagrangian to model the direct production of \u03a6 at the LHC,\nL \u2283 g2s v \u00bd\u03ba\u03d5gg\u03d5Ga\u03bc\u03bd Ga \u03bc\u03bd \u00fe \u03ba\u03b7gg\u03b7Ga\u03bc\u03bdG\u0303a\u03bc\u03bd : \u00f037\u00de\nThe above Lagrangian lets us recast the diphoton bound on the fiducial production cross section times BR\u00f0X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de in terms of \u03ba2\u03a6gg \u00d7 \u03b2 \u03a6 \u03b3\u03b3, where \u03b2\u03a6\u03b3\u03b3 is the BR of\u03a6 in the \u03b3\u03b3mode:\n\u03ba2\u03a6gg \u00d7 \u03b2 \u03a6 \u03b3\u03b3 < \u03c3fid \u00d7 BR\u00f0X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de \u03f5 \u00d7 K\u03a6 \u00d7 \u03c3LO\u00f0gg \u2192 \u03a6\u00de\n\u03ba\u03a6gg\u00bc1\n: \u00f038\u00de\nHere, \u03f5 is the reported efficiency, K\u03a6 is the next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO) QCD K-factor, which we take as the same as for the Higgs, K\u03a6 \u2248 \u03c3hNNLO=\u03c3hLO \u2248 2.5 [63]. We show the recast limits in Fig. 2. The generic parametrization of the\u03a6 couplings allows easy interpretation of the limits in terms of diagonal couplings of the quarks with\u03a6. However, the off-diagonal couplings, i.e., \u03bba\u03a6F and \u03bb b \u03a6F or \u03bb a \u03a6D and \u03bb b \u03a6D, are unrestricted by these limits. Similarly, both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have been actively looking for the VLQs as well. The direct LHC searches for T and B assume they can only decay to a third-generation quark and an SM gauge or Higgs boson. With the introduction of \u03a6, this assumption breaks down and we get\n\u03b2q0 1 W \u00fe \u03b2q1Z \u00fe \u03b2q1h \u00bc 1 \u2212 \u03b2q1\u03a6; \u00f039\u00de\nwhere \u03b2fi is the BR for the q2 \u2192 fi decay.

Similarly, it is also possible to calculate the exclusion limits from the inclusive searches. Assuming the inclusive signal selection efficiencies remain unaffected by the presence of an additional decay mode (a reasonable assumption given the inclusive nature of the signals), \u03c3incl\u00f0pp \u2192 q\u03042q2 \u2192 fi \u00fe X\u00de scales with a factor,\nBinclfi \u00bc \u03b22fi \u00fe 2 X j\u2260i \u03b2fi\u03b2fj \u00bc \u03b2fi\u00f02 \u2212 \u03b2fi\u00de; \u00f040\u00de\nwhere the factor 2 in the middle comes from combinatorics. For a value of \u03b2q1\u03a6, we first recast the relevant limits from the available exclusive [17,18] and inclusive [19] searches to select the strongest one. We show the new limits on Mq2 in Fig. 3. With increasing \u03b2q1\u03a6, the limits on the heavy quarks relax significantly.\n095014-6\nThere are searches for single production of the singlet top partners by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [20,21]. However, unlike the pair production, single productions are model dependent, i.e., their cross sections depend on unknown coupling(s). As a result, the exclusion limits from single-production searches depend not only on the BRs but also on the absolute magnitude of the unknown VLQ coupling parametrized as \u03baT in Ref. [64]. If \u03baT is of order 1, the single-production search limits on VLQs become stronger than the pair-production limits. However, for small off-diagonal mass matrix elements (\u03bcFi=MF \u2272 0.1), \u03baT becomes small (< \u03bbQED)making the single-production limits weaker than the pair-production ones. For this study,we stick to the regions of the parameter space where \u03baT is much smaller than unity by restricting the range of the off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix, i.e., (\u03bcFi \u2272 50 forMF \u223c TeV).\nApart from the direct search limits, there are limits on the Z boson coupling to the left-handed b quark, i.e., \u03baZb\u0304LbL in the models with a B quark since the coupling shifts from its SM value due to b-B mixing (unless some symmetry prevents it\u2014see, e.g., Refs. [11,65]). The measurements of Rb and \u0393b at LEP [66] restrict \u0394\u03baZb\u0304LbL to be less than about 1% [roughly, \u00f01 \u2212 cBL\u00de2 \u00bc \u00f0sBL\u00de2 \u2272 0.1]. The direct limits from flavor-changing neutral couplings [67] also restrict the mixing parameters between the SM quarks and their partners from being arbitrarily large."

            "text": "For the rest of the section, we focus only on\u03a6 \u00bc \u03d5 since the pseudoscalar case is similar. To get an idea about the available parameter space surviving the bounds, we\n095014-7\nnumerically scan over the model parameters incorporating the recast limits from Figs. 2 and 3 for a benchmark choice of MF \u00bc 1.2 TeV and M\u03d5 \u00bc 400 GeV. As mentioned above, we restrict the off-diagonal terms in the mass matrices, \u03bcFi \u2272 50. This makes the mixing angles small, \u03b8L; \u03b8R < 0.05, which ensures the indirect bounds (like the correction to \u03baZb\u0304LbL etc. mentioned in the previous section) are respected. Each of the singletT andBmodels have three independent parameters of interest (one off-diagonal mass terms and two \u03d5q2q1 couplings), whereas the doublet model has four, since the T andBmassmatrices share common elements [Eq. (8)]. We use the following additional criteria for the scan: (1) BR\u00f0q2 \u2192 q1\u03d5\u00de should be greater than the\nrescaled experimental limits for MF \u00bc 1.2 TeV from Fig. 3. For example, for the singlet T model, BR\u00f0t2 \u2192 t\u03d5\u00de\u2273 70%. (2) The effective coupling \u03ba\u03d5gg and \u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 must satisfy the\nlimit in Fig. 2. So, for example, \u03ba2\u03d5gg\u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2272 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22129\nfor M\u03d5 \u00bc 400 GeV. (3) In addition, we mark the points that satisfy an\nadditional criterion on the \u03d5 \u2192 gg branching, \u03b2\u03d5gg \u2265 50%.\nThe last one is not a necessary condition but a choice. Its motivation differs from the first two. For M\u03d5 > 2mq,\nnormally \u03d5 would significantly decay to a qq\u0304 pair (a treelevel process). As a result, the pair production ofT can lead to the exotic 6t signature [33]. However, as we shall see in the next section, there are other interesting and less explored signals of \u03d5 (like \u03d5 \u2192 2-jets or \u03b3\u03b3) and the T and B quark. The third criterion takes us to theparameter regionswhere the loop-induced decays of the \u03d5 dominate. We show the results of the multidimensional scan for the singlet and doublet models with some projective plots in Fig. 4 . In these plots, all the grey points are allowed\u2014 clearly, there is no need to fine-tune the parameters to make the exotic decay mode dominant without violating the experimental bounds. The restriction from the LHC limit on \u03ba\u03d5gg \u00d7 \u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 for a 400 GeV \u03d5 [Fig. 2(a)] causes the empty areas on the bottom-right corners in the coupling plots [Figs. 4(a), 4(c) and 4(e), 4(f), 4(g)]. To understand this, we can consider, for example, the singlet T model. We can write the diagonal couplings [that enter the \u03d5 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 loop, as shown in Eq. (27)] of \u03d5 with the t and t2 quarks from Eq. (18) as\n\u03bb\u03d5tt\u2236 \u00f0\u03bbb\u03d5TsLcR \u2212 \u03bba\u03d5TsLsR\u00de \u223c \u03bbb\u03d5TsL; \u03bb\u03d5t2t2\u2236 \u2212 \u00f0\u03bba\u03d5TcLcR \u00fe \u03bbb\u03d5TcLsR\u00de \u223c \u2212\u03bba\u03d5T:\nIn the last step, we have ignored the relatively smaller terms suppressed by the t \u2212 t2 mixing and set cL=R \u223c 1. These\n095014-8\nimply that enhancing \u03bba\u03d5T (\u03bb b \u03d5T) increases the t2 (t)-loop contribution to the \u03d5 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay and there is some cancellation between the two loops. Since \u03d5 dominantly couples to t2, a large \u03bba\u03d5T is not favored by the constraint on \u03ba2\u03d5gg\u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3. However, because of the cancellation between the two quark contributions, it allows \u03bba\u03d5T and \u03bb b \u03d5T to be large simultaneously. Similar arguments can be made in the other models as well. In the singlet B model, the constraint on \u03ba2\u03d5gg\u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 is weaker since the contribution of the loops with down-type quarks is suppressed than the up-type-quark loops by a factor of \u00f0ed=eu\u00de4 \u00bc 1=16. We show the parameter regions where the loop-mediated \u03d5 decays dominate (i.e., the third criterion is satisfied) with darker shades. This essentially restricts the \u03d5 \u2192 q1q1 decay. Because of its mass, the top quark mixes easily with the t2 quark than b1 with b2. Hence, this criterion restricts the parameter spaces in the singlet T and the doublet models more than that in the singlet B model. We can understand the behavior of the parameters by looking at the singlet T model once again. To reduce the \u03d5tt coupling, the left-mixing angle \u03b8L should be small, restricting the offdiagonal mass element \u03bcT1 [which appears with MT in the numerator of Eq. (13)]. However, there is another effect at play. As we enhance \u03b2\u03d5gg, we increase \u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 as well [since they are proportional to each other; see Eqs. (27) and (28)], and thus the limit on \u03ba2\u03d5gg\u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 becomes more stringent, eliminating the region with large \u03bba\u03d5T. Since the \u03bb b \u03d5T term in the \u03d5tt coupling is small due to the small left-mixing angle, the \u03ba2\u03d5gg\u03b2 \u03d5 \u03b3\u03b3 limit becomes insensitive to \u03bbb\u03d5T . A similar argument can be made for the doublet model as well. However, since the \u03d5 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay is small in the singlet B model, demanding the gluon mode branching to be more than 50% does not constrain the couplings further within the range we consider."

This factor is about 0.004 in the singlet T model and about 0.0003 in the singlet B model. Hence the channels involving the \u03a6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay are negligible in the singlet B model.\n(iii) We do not consider the channels with the \u03a6 \u2192 Z\u03b3 decay since \u03b2\u03a6Z\u03b3 is small. While in the doublet model one gets \u03b2\u03a6Z\u03b3 > \u03b2 \u03a6 \u03b3\u03b3 , the effective signal cross sections\nin thesemodes are reduced by theZ decays. A similar argument is applicable for the \u03d5 \u2192 VV decays. The \u03a6 \u2192 Z\u03b3 decay mode is analyzed in Ref. [37].\n(iv) In a fully hadronic analysis, one can use some kinematic features of the signal in different regions of the parameter space. In the models with a T quark, ifMt2 \u226b M\u03a6, both \u03a6 and the top quark produced in the t2 \u2192 t\u03a6 decay would be boosted. Similarly, if M\u03a6 \u226b 2mt, the top quarks produced in the \u03a6 \u2192 tt decay would be boosted. The three-pronged nature of the boosted top quark(s) can efficiently enhance the signal over background ratio.\n(v) Similarly, the final states produced in the standard decays of a TeV range q2 would be boosted (i.e., a\nboosted hadronically decaying vector boson or a Higgs boson) and give raise to two-prong fatjets.\n(vi) A two-prong fatjet can also come from a \u03a6 through the \u03a6 \u2192 gg; bb decays. As we have seen from the parameter scans, \u03d5 decays dominantly to two jets in significant parts of the parameter space in all models. In the singlet B model, this is the signature of \u03a6 in the entire parameter space. So far, a boosted two-prong \u03a6 jet has not been used in any analysis of these models in the literature, even though it could be the dominant signal. We are currently analyzing the prospects of identifying the signal with a boosted two-prong \u03a6 jet. We shall present our results in a future publication."

For the singlet model, it is easy to obtain \u03b2\u03a6gg \u2248 1. So we just take \u03b2\u03a6\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 0.004 following Eq. (42) in the entire Mt2\u2013M\u03a6 range we consider. Clearly, despite being the cleanest, because of the low branching, the \u03a6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel is not suitable to probe most of the parameter space. However, as indicated by Table II, there are other signatures that can be used (like the signals with a boosted \u03a6 jet) to probe parts of this region. So far, we have discussed only the pair production of the top partners. However, the top partners can also be produced singly. The single-production channels could also lead to interesting new signatures in the presence of the singlet state. The cross sections of the single-production channels would depend on the coupling between the VLQs with the SM particles. Analysing the single productions would require different strategies (see, for example, Refs. [68\u201370] for strategies to probe single productions of colored particles) than the pair-production searches but, depending on these couplings, single productions could be the dominant production mode of the top partners."

            "text": "Exhaustive searches for VLQs in the standard channels, where they decay to the SM fields, and nonobservation of any deviation from the SM predictions at the LHC motivate us to look for them in new decay channels. In this paper, we have charted out the possibility of exploring heavy vectorlike top and bottom partners decaying to a new\nweak-singlet colorless scalar or pseudoscalar and a thirdgeneration quark. As indicated in the Introduction, such possibilities can arise in many new physics models. Therefore, exploring these new decays of the VLQs in the upcoming run 3 of the LHC would be of prime importance. We have considered simple phenomenological models covering the possible weak representations of the VLQs that can couple with a SM-singlet pseudo(scalar). We have reinterpreted the latest mass-exclusion limits for T and B quarks in terms of the BRs in the new decay modes. With the increasing branching in the extra decay mode, the existing limits on VLQs can relax by up to\u223c300\u2013500 GeV. Beyond their weak representation, the recast limits are independent of the exact nature of the additional decay modes; hence, they are applicable in a broader range of models than those considered here. Incorporating the reinterpreted direct-search limits on VLQs and the (pseudo)scalar, we found that the parameter space is wide open and does not need any fine-tuning or abnormally large mixing with new quarks or large offdiagonal couplings. Hence, on the theoretical side, the next-to-minimal avatars of most well-motivated models featuring VLQs and a (pseudo)scalar can be easily mapped to the open parameter space. For example, the off-diagonal couplings involving third-generation quarks and their vectorlike partners tend to be small in the warped extra-dimension models (see, e.g., Ref. [11]). So, following our results, one can consider such a setup with an extra spinless field (e.g., Ref. [22]) without conflicting with the LHC data. On the experimental side, we have charted out a host of interesting and unexplored collider signatures. We have presented a set of benchmark points to probe different signatures as a guideline for future VLQ searches at the LHC. We have also performed a simple projection study in the clean\u03a6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel and indicated how other channels could be used to probe additional regions. We point out one channel of particular interest where a VLQ decays to a pseudo(scalar), which decays to two gluons. The digluon mode is the dominant decay of the singlet if the tree-level decays are kinematically forbidden. However, even if the tree-level decays are allowed, the loop-induced decay to a pair of gluons can still dominate over the tree-level ones\u2014our random scans have shown that this is the case over a large region of the available parameter space of every model. Hence, in those regions, it can act as the discovery channel (we will report the HLLHC prospects of this channel in a forthcoming paper). There are some cases where our results would not be directly applicable. For example, we have assumed that before EWSB, \u03a6 does not couple exclusively with the SM fields. However, one can think of models where \u03a6 couples with the Higgs field. In that case, one might need to consider additional decays and the corresponding experimental bounds. Similarly, one can consider models with more than one singlet/doublet VLQs or other heavy fields\n095014-12\nthat couple with the VLQs and\u03a6. One can easily follow our prescription to obtain the available parameter space in all such cases."
