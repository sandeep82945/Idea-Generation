    "abstractText": "Abstract. Membrane or film gain mediums have attracted great attention for their good thermal performances and light field manipulation properties, which are helpful for the power scaling of a laser. A membrane laser enabled on the waveguide grating structure is proposed and this design is flexible to manipulate optical properties by controlling the photonic density of states. Lasing behavior is theoretically analyzed based on the four-level rate equations. Results show that pump absorption is enhanced by about 35 times, which leads to improved laser efficiency. When the laser mode overlaps the resonant guided mode, the Purcell factor achieves 212, leading to enhanced emission rate, as well as an apparent decrease of relaxation oscillating amplitude and time delay. The present work offers a preliminary design and lasing behavior analysis of the vertical external surface-emission laser enabled on the waveguide grating structure. \u00a9 The Authors.

It is also a hard time for HPSSLs, although some laser systems have reached a high output power of several kilowatts,1\u20133 they encounter a series of problems caused by the high power density in the gain medium, such as the thermal effects which could damage optical elements and worsen the beam quality. Fiber lasers, waveguide lasers, and thin disc lasers are now becoming the main candidates for HPSSLs. The fiber laser has a larger surface-tovolume ratio (SVR), whose cross-section radius is just several micrometers, so it has a quick waste heat dissipation and a simpler heat-removal system. Although high power fiber laser has better performances in some respects, its power increase has become slower in recent years because of the transverse mode instability and other nonlinear effects.4 The planar waveguide laser (PWL) is another type of high-power solid-state laser, the width of which is usually several millimeters and its thickness is around tens or hundreds of micrometers. The output power of PWL has reached a multi-kilowatt level but the beam quality is not very well because it is not well restrained in one dimension.5\nThe cross-section radius of the thin disc laser is much larger than the fiber laser while its thickness is just hundreds of micrometers, so its SVR is almost as large as the fiber laser and it\n*Address all correspondence to Kai Han, hankai0071@nudt.edu.cn\nJournal of Nanophotonics 026003-1 Apr\u2013Jun 2022 \u2022 Vol. 16(2)\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Nanophotonics on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nhas a lower power density. On the other hand, thin disc lasers based on the vertical external surface-emitting architecture are capable of outputting a beam with a large mode area and high beam quality, which is very beneficial to HPSSL. The output power has been achieved 10-kW level,6 however, when it comes down to higher power, its pump architecture and the manufacturing technology become very complicated, and the waste heat dissipation is much harder. The trend of thin-disk lasers is to further compress the thickness to pursue a higher heat dissipation rate. Recently, a membrane laser7 of 0.59 \u03bcm thick has been developed; however, the round-trip pump absorption of the membrane is quite low because of its limited thickness.\nThe blossom of nanophotonics technology provides unique solutions to this problem. Lots of high efficiency and low threshold lasers have been realized based on special nanostructure design.8\u201310 The photonic density of states (DOS) is affected by local light field distribution around the nanostructures, which is the key to these miniature light sources. Practically, by shape design of the gain medium or cavity, we can engineer or tailor the optical properties of these lasers. The guided-mode resonance (GMR), which permits field localization at the pump and lasing wavelength simultaneously, is a promising tool.11\u201315 If the GMR is excited in the gain membrane, the absorption and emission properties could be improved artificially. Some simulation works of the membrane laser using GMR structure have been done, in which laser behavior is analyzed based on the rate equations.16\u201318 Recently, a membrane laser based on the transmission GMR effect is proposed, in which two grating layers are used.19 Some experimental works about the membrane laser are also conducted, in which the gain medium is the semiconductor membrane,20 however, the GMR structure is not used so the vertical external surfaceemitting cannot be realized.\nThe neodymium-doped material has been used as the gain medium widely in the high-power regime21,22 and the Nd-doped film has been fabricated on different substrates by various methods.23\u201326 The well-fabricated Nd-doped membrane has presented good optical properties and its intrinsic loss is quite low. Except for the thermal management advantage, the threshold of the Nd-doped membrane is lower meanwhile the optical efficiency is higher due to its fourenergy-level system. Taking into account all the above advantages, we proposed a compound dielectric waveguide grating (CDWG) structure with the Nd-doped gain membrane as the waveguide layer. GMR is excited in the structure to enhance the pump absorption meanwhile lasing behavior is adjusted to obtain higher optical efficiency.\nWe first set up a model and gave optimized design parameters using the rigorous coupledwave analysis (RCWA) method. In the waveguide layer, the light field was localized, so high absorption and emission enhancement were achieved. Second, we combined wave optical simulation with a four-level-rate-equation model and found laser efficiency improvement as well as a compress of relaxation oscillating. These results are particularly optimistic and will be useful for experimental laser scientists.\nJournal of Nanophotonics 026003-2 Apr\u2013Jun 2022 \u2022 Vol. 16(2)\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Nanophotonics on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

            "text": "The laser is designed as presented in Fig. 1(a). The whole CDWG structure is considered as an active reflector, which comprises a substrate and a nanostructure gain membrane. The substrate is used as the heat spreader and soldered on the heat sink with indium. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the parameters of the active reflector are optimized so that the laser mode could be overlapped by the GMR mode and the laser beam is highly reflected. M1 is used as the output coupling mirror and the reflection at laser wavelength is R. As a result, a vertical resonant cavity composed of M1 and the active reflector is built. Furthermore, the incident angle of the pump beam should also be optimized so that GMR mode could be excited at the pump wavelength.\nFigure 1(b) shows the proposed nanostructure gain membrane. First, an Nd3\u00fe-doped layer is deposited on the substrate, then a rectangular grating is etched on it. At last, a cap layer is fabricated on the top to protect the grating and improve the reflection spectrum. The Nd3\u00fe doped film is considered the waveguide layer and its thickness is hw. The depth of the grating section is hg and the cap layer\u2019s thickness is hc. Other physical factors are the grating period \u039b and the filling factor f. The refractive indexes are ni \u00bc 1, nc \u00bc ns \u00bc 1.46, and ng \u00bc 2.48 (ng is the gain film refractive index, ni is the refractive index of incident area, and ns is the substrate refractive index). As presented in Fig. 1(c), the pump transition rouses between the 4I9\u22152 and 4F5\u22152 levels while the emission transition is between the 4F3\u22152 and 4I11\u22152 levels. So M1 is coated with a reflection of 99.9% at 0.808 \u03bcm, and the laser beam at 1.064 \u03bcm is high reflected by the active reflector with the designed CDWG parameters.\nThe period structure in the CDWG is served as a Bragg reflector, so the incident plane wave can be diffracted into several orders. When an order with incident angle \u03b8i couples to the leaky mode supported by the waveguide layer, a GMR mode would be excited. Physically, 100% switching of optical energy between reflected and transmitted waves occurs with respect to the wavelength and angle of incidence.27 These rapid variations of reflection or transmittance are also called GMR effects.\nIn the designed structure, when the diffracted pump or lasing beam [transverse magnetic (TM) polarization] overlaps the resonant mode, GMR is excited inside the waveguide layer, consequently, a narrow-width high reflection is obtained.28 Light field is modified by the nanostructure, so lasing behavior would be different from a homogeneous gain medium. The light field E\u00f0x; z\u00de is calculated by the RCWA.29 The RCWAmethod is a semi-analytical method that is frequently employed to solve the light field diffracted by a period structure.

(2) and (3), the light field in the grating region can also be obtained by summing up the space harmonic items in Eqs. (5) and (6). Furthermore, by increasing the diffractive orders, high accuracy could be obtained.\nOn the other hand, a higher absorption could be obtained, which is beneficial for optical efficiency. The absorbance we obtained from the numerical simulation is defined as\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e013;116;256 \u00bc 1 \u2212 \u00f0 X i Ri \u00fe X i Ti\u00de: (13)\nThe absorption could be calculated by introducing the complex refractive index data into the numerical model. A factorM \u00bc A\u00f0\u03bb\u00de\u2215\u00bdNion\u03c3p\u00f0\u03bb\u00dehw is defined to indicate the enhanced absorption of the gain membrane with nanostructures, in which Nion is the Nd3\u00fe density and \u03c3p is its absorption cross-section.\nSince the diffraction efficiency of a high order is lower, the grating period would better be smaller than \u03bbR\u2215n. \u03bbR is the Rayleigh wavelength and n is the average refractive index of the waveguide layer. In Fig. 2(a), as the layer thickness increases, more GMR modes appear and high reflection arms get closer, which means that the resonant free-range gets shorter. As shown in Fig. 2(b), we optimized parameters of the CDWG structure as hw \u00bc 0.5 \u03bcm, hg \u00bc 0.3 \u03bcm, hc \u00bc 0.02 \u03bcm, f \u00bc 0.5, and \u039b \u00bc 0.69 \u03bcm. As each diffractive order couples to a leaky waveguide mode, there are many high reflection \u201carms\u201d in the figure.

The counterpropagating waves interact with each other and result in spectrum splitting, which is also known as the resonance bandgap.32 The dispersion curve is almost flat at the edge of band gaps, so the reflection would keep high at a fixed wavelength as the incident angle changes. That is to say, the angle tolerance is improved, which is beneficial to assemble the laser cavity. As the parameters of the compound structure change, the band gaps will shift so appropriate resonant wavelength for the pump and emission light can be obtained with carefully chosen parameters. In Fig. 2(b), it is apparent that some GMRmodes appear when the wavelength \u03bb \u00bc 808 nm and \u03bb \u00bc 1064 nm. According to the laser schematic designed in Fig. 1(a), the laser beam in the cavity oscillates vertically to the active reflector, so the resonant angle is chosen as \u03b8i \u00bc 0 deg. Similarly, the resonant angle of the pump beam with the wavelength \u03bb \u00bc 808 nm is larger than 0 deg. Reflection curves in Fig. 3(a) are exacted from Fig. 2(b), and present a high reflection of 99.8% at 1.064 \u03bcm when the incident angle \u03b8i \u00bc 0 deg, as well as a reflection of 98% at 0.808 \u03bcm when the incident angle \u03b8i \u00bc 35.7 deg . It can be deduced from Fig. 1(a) that a higher reflection at the wavelength \u03bb \u00bc 1.064 \u03bcm is beneficial for the laser design, which means the cavity loss would be lower.\nAs GMR is excited at the pump wavelength, Fig. 3(b) presents the absorption factor M, which achieves about 35 at 0.808 \u03bcm. The absorption enhancement is due to the light field localization in the waveguide layer as shown in Fig. 4(a), as a result, more Nd3\u00fe ions could be pumped to the excited state.\nBesides the absorption, the confined light field in the CDWG structure also affects the emission enhancement apparently known as the Purcell effect. The Purcell factor F is defined as33\nJournal of Nanophotonics 026003-5 Apr\u2013Jun 2022 \u2022 Vol. 16(2)\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Nanophotonics on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e014;116;549F \u00bc 3 4\u03c02 Q Vm\n\u03bb\nn\n3\n: (14)\nQ is the quality factor, which could be obtained byQ \u00bc \u03bb\u2215\u0394\u03bb. \u03bb is the laser wavelength,\u0394\u03bb is the line width, n is the refractive index, and Vm indicates the mode volume defined as\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e015;116;489Vm \u00bc R V \u03b5\u00f0r\u00dejE\u00f0r\u00dej2d3r max\u00bd\u03b5\u00f0r\u00dejE\u00f0r\u00dej2 (15)\n(r) is the permittivity at position r and E\u00f0r\u00de is the light amplitude.

By introducing refractive index and light amplitude distribution into Eqs. (14) and (15), F \u00bc 212 is obtained.

On the other hand, the lifetime of 4F3\u22152 is about 200 \u03bcs, so the emission process is apparently affected by the Purcell effect.

The effective lifetime of 4F3\u22152 is defined as \u03c4 032 \u00bc \u03c432\u2215F, which means the spontaneous rate is much higher.\nThe stimulated emission rate Rse can be expressed by Eq.

As shown in Fig. 4(a), light field enhancement in the gain medium is realized by design, so the stimulated absorption, which is proportional to the light intensity, is greatly enhanced. As a result, more Nd3\u00fe ions are excited to the 4F3\u22152 energy level in the gain medium and the inverted population density \u0394n gets higher. Considering Eqs. (20) and (21), more stimulated emission photons can be obtained while the excited ions transmit to the ground state 4I11\u22152. Consequently, a high enough gain coefficient could be enabled by less pump power to achieve laser oscillation and emit higher laser power.\nOn the other hand, with the pump intensity Ip \u00bc 1 \u00d7 105 W\u2215cm2, the output lasing process is shown in Fig. 5(b) and the inset figure presents the lasing process withM \u00bc 1 and F \u00bc 1. The laser relaxation achieved a steady state at about 580 \u03bcs without nanostructure (M \u00bc 1 and F \u00bc 1) and about 0.29 \u03bcs with the designed nanostructure (M \u00bc 35 and F \u00bc 212). A larger M means that a higher pump rate is obtained, which corresponds to a shorter time to achieve a steady-state. Namely, while the laser mode overlaps the resonant mode in the CDWG, the lasing oscillation starts much more quickly than F \u00bc 1. Further analysis of the impact of the M and F factor is presented in Fig. 6.\nThe black line in Fig. 6(a) shows the changing of the maximum lasing relaxation intensity in the cavity while the absorption enhancement factorM increases from 1 to 50. The F factor is set as a constant of 212 in Fig. 6(a). A higher M means that more pump power is absorbed and Rp gets larger. According to the rate Eqs. (16)\u2013(19), more ions can be pumped to the 4F3\u22152 energy level, as a result, the inverted population density \u0394n gets higher. Considering Eqs. (20) and (21), the stimulated rate Rse gets higher and the photon density in the cavity will increase consequently.\nJournal of Nanophotonics 026003-8 Apr\u2013Jun 2022 \u2022 Vol. 16(2)\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Nanophotonics on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nOn the other hand, the relaxation lifetime t0, which is defined as the time that the laser relaxation cost to achieve a steady outputting, is dramatically decreased as the red line presents in Fig. 6(a). The relaxation lifetime is about 3\u03bcs forM \u00bc 1, when theM factor equals 5, the lifetime is shortened to about 0.27 \u03bcs and changes little with the further increase of the M factor. According to the rate Eqs. (16)\u2013(19), a small M factor means that fewer ions are pumped to the excited state, so the stimulated rate Rse is subsequently much lower. Referring to Eq. (21), a lower Rse means that the spontaneous emission provides more photons than the stimulated emission in the cavity. Since the power increase of stimulated emission is much faster than that of the spontaneous emission, the laser intensity in the cavity will increase slowly and the relaxation lifetime is longer.\nThe black line in Fig. 6(b) shows the changing of the maximum lasing relaxation intensity in the cavity while the Purcell factor F increases from 1 to 500. TheM factor is set as a constant of 35 in Fig. 6(b). According to Eq. (20), the stimulated emission rate Rse will get higher while the Purcell factor increases. As a result, the photon density in the cavity will increase just like the situation in Fig. 6(a). On the other hand, since the effective lifetime of 4F3\u22152 is defined as \u03c4 032 \u00bc \u03c432\u2215F, the spontaneous rate will be much higher with a larger F factor. According to Eq. (21), the stimulated emission and spontaneous emission process get faster simultaneously in the cavity, so the relaxation lifetime decreases dramatically as the red line presents in Fig. 6(b)."
