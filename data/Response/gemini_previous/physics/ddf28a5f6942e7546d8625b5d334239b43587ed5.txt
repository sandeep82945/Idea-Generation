1. **Investigate the effect of different substituents on the HCur molecule.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of HCur derivatives with different substituents and studying their spectral properties and sensing abilities. This would help to identify the structural features that are most important for the sensing function of HCur.
2. **Explore the use of HCur in other types of supramolecular assemblies.** For example, HCur could be incorporated into micelles, liposomes, or nanogels. This could lead to the development of new sensors with different properties and applications.
3. **Investigate the use of HCur for sensing other analytes.** The current study has shown that HCur can be used to sense heavy metal ions and polylysine. However, it is possible that HCur could also be used to sense other analytes, such as small molecules, proteins, or nucleic acids.
4. **Develop theoretical models to explain the sensing mechanism of HCur.** This could be done using computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations or density functional theory calculations. This would help to understand the molecular interactions that are responsible for the sensing function of HCur.
5. **Explore the use of HCur in practical applications.** For example, HCur could be used to develop sensors for environmental monitoring, food safety, or medical diagnostics. This would require the development of robust and reliable sensing devices that can be used in real-world settings.
