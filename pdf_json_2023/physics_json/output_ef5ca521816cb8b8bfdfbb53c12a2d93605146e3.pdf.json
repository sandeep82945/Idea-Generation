    "abstractText": "Pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma activator used to diagnose hyperglycemia, was studied for its stereoselective deposition and active enantiomers in female albino Wistar rats. In accordance with USFDA recommendations, a bioanalytical technique was employed to assess the segregation of pioglitazone enantiomers in rat plasma with glimepiride as an internal standard. A Phenomenox i-Amylose-3 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) of 5 \u03bcm was used for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer in Millipore water and acetonitrile in 60:40 (v/v) admixture with column temperature 35 \u25e6C, wavelength 265 nm, and flow rate 0.6 mL/min, respectively. Pioglitazone-S, Pioglitazone-R, and the internal standard had retention times of 3.1, 7.4, and 1.7 min, respectively. The study found that within-run and between-run precision ranged from 0.1606\u20130.9889% for Pioglitazone-R and from 0.2080\u20130.7919% for Pioglitazone-S, while the accuracy ranged from 99.86 to 100.36% for Pioglitazone-R and 99.84 to 99.94% for Pioglitazone-S. In addition, a non-radioactive glucose uptake assay was employed to examine the enantiomers in 3T3-L1 cell lines by flow cytometry. Significant differences were demonstrated in Cmax, AUClast (h*\u03bcg/mL), AUCINF obs (h*\u03bcg/mL), and AUC%Extrap obs (%) of Pioglitazone-R and S in female albino Wistar rats, suggesting enantioselectivity of pioglitazone.",

            "text": "Hyperglycemia is a persistent condition characterized by the body\u2019s use of glucose (blood sugar) as fuel. Unlike type 1 diabetes, which is caused by a deficiency of insulin, type 2 diabetes is often the result of insulin resistance, which means the body\u2019s cells become less responsive to insulin\u2019s signals to take up glucose from the bloodstream. It induces elevated blood glucose levels, resulting in various consequences, including coronary heart disease, nerve failure, renal dysfunction, and visual impairment. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been steadily increasing worldwide, primarily due to sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, and obesity. Anti-diabetic medications such as pioglitazone (PIO) can treat\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4911. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28134911 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4911 2 of 14\nthese disorders [1]. Chirality refers to molecules with non-superimposable mirror images. In other words, chiral molecules exist in two forms, mimicking each other. However, like hands, they cannot be superimposed over each other. Many drugs are chiral, meaning they exist in two different enantiomers which are mirror-image isomers of the same molecule. PIO is a chiral drug that displays a wide spectrum of bioavailability, distribution, and pharmacodynamic characteristics from a pharmacological and toxicological perspective [2]. The problem of chirality plagues modern medications. The human body can often distinguish between the enantiomers of a drug, even though they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight. This is because the body contains enzymes and receptors that are themselves chiral and can interact selectively with one enantiomer but not the other. This can lead to differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug, as well as its potential for toxicity and side effects. In this context, PIO is a chiral drug that is used to treat type 2 diabetes. The two enantiomers of PIO have different pharmacokinetic profiles, meaning that they are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated differently by the body. The body reacts differently to each racemic substance, using a chiral selection mechanism to generate an array of biological features. Consequently, to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of chiral drugs, it may be necessary to separate the two enantiomers and administer only the active isomer. This process is known as enantiomeric enrichment or chiral switching. Alternatively, the two enantiomers can be administered together as a racemic mixture, but this can sometimes lead to undesirable side effects due to differences in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [3]. Pioglitazone(PIO) belongs to a class of drugs known as PPAR-gamma activators, which work by activating a receptor in the body that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. When used as a monotherapy, PIO can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce glucose production in the liver, resulting in lower blood glucose levels. It can also improve lipid profiles and reduce cardiovascular complication risk in people with type 2 diabetes. PIO is often used in combination with other medications such as sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin to help achieve optimal glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes who have not been able to achieve adequate blood glucose control with monotherapy alone [4]. The structure of PIO, with a carbonyl group attached to the thiazolidinedione ring, is depicted in Figure 1.

antidiabetic efficacy of drugs, enabling screening of a wide range of potential therapy contenders. The glucose uptake assay on 3T3L1 cell lines was evaluated using flow cytometry to ascertain its antidiabetic efficacy [5]. Glucose uptake within adipocytes and insulin\u2019s role in sustaining glucose homeostasis can be studied using adipocytes. 3T3-L1\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4911 3 of 14\nfibroblasts, which develop into adipocytes during adipogenesis, have been the subject of a comprehensive study on adipogenesis [6]. Diabetes studies involving glucose uptake by cells show that adipocytes are more responsive to insulin after differentiation than other cells. In response to insulin response, glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) moves from the intracellular region (localized within vesicles) to the plasma membrane. GLUT4 serves a critical function in maintaining the body\u2019s glucose homeostasis. Consequently, when blood glucose levels are lowered, mature adipocytes can acquire high glucose levels even at lower insulin concentrations [7]. The fluorescent glucose analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG), which is transported within cells by GLUT4, the same transporter that regulates glucose transport within cells, has the potential to assess glucose uptake in cells by a non-invasive, simple, and safe method [8]. In this study, we aim to establish a simpler, more specific, and more accurate technique for distinguishing between the two enantiomers of PIO in rat plasma. Accurately identifying and quantifying Pioglitazone-R (PIO-R) and Pioglitazone-S (PIO-S) is essential for evaluating drug safety and efficacy. This is because enantiomers can have significantly different pharmacological properties, such as potency and toxicity, even though they have the same chemical formula [9]. Previous research has mostly used chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods to differentiate between PIO enantiomers [10]. Our ultimate goal is to determine which PIO enantiomer exhibits significantly enhanced activity over the other. Specifically, we will compare the activity of the dextrorotatory (R) and levorotatory (S) enantiomers to assess which one is more effective. Therefore, this study examined the pharmacokinetic differences between PIO enantiomers in albino Wistar female rats, since hepatic glucose production is faster in the female cerebellum, heart, and brain than in male diabetic rats [11]. Our findings will help improve our understanding of the pharmacological effects of PIO enantiomers and potentially lead to the development of more effective and safer drugs."

            "text": "Reverse-phase liquid chromatography was performed using a Lux I-Amylose-3 column with dimensions of 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm and a 5 \u00b5m particle size to separate PIO enantiomers and an internal standard in rat plasma. Investigating the mobile phase\u2019s composition, the column\u2019s flow rate, and the temperature composition led to the discovery of the ideal separation parameters. To separate PIO chiral compounds, either ammonium bicarbonate buffers (pH 7.8) and acetonitrile in varied ratios or potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffers (pH 7.0) and acetonitrile were employed, employing reversed-phase columns such as ACI Cellu and Chiralpak AD-RH as stationary phases. The low resolution may be due to the lack of stereotypical activity from the analyte or to weak enantiomer affinity for the CSP. Normal phase separation was also attempted using dissimilar proportions of n-hexane:2-propanol in the mobile phase, such as 70:30 v/v and 60:40 v/v, but failed. The effectiveness of three different chiral columns, chiralcel OD-H, chiral ART Amylose C-Neo, and chiralpak IA, was investigated with and without DEA in the mobile phase. However, the results showed poor peak shapes and longer run times, indicating insufficient separation. Although peak splitting was observed, it could not be effectively resolved using mobile phases such as 0.1% formic acid in Millipore water and methanol (20:80 v/v) or 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer and methanol (70:30 v/v) with a Phenomenox i-amylose-3 (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) 5 \u00b5m column. This could be due to the lack of interaction between the column packing material and the mobile phase. In addition, the mobile phase cannot effectively separate chiral peaks. In this optimized method, a mobile phase comprising of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer was used to achieve high resolution between PIO enantiomers using a Phenomenex i-Amylose-3 column. The column temperature, flow rate, and mobile phase proportions were adjusted to achieve the desired separation. A flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and a temperature of 35 \u25e6C were chosen for the column.

The calibration c rve was obtained for the linearity range of 3.125\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL concentrations. The PIO standard bioanalytical chromatogram appears in Figure 2. The calibration curves were obtained by plotting graphs of the ratio of PIO peak area to internal standard versus PIO concentration for both enantiomers. The mean linear regression equations for PIO-S and R for the concentration range of 3.125\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL were determined using the least squares technique, where y = 0.013x + 0.0022, y = 0.0423x \u2212 0.0049 respectively (y is the peak area ratio enantiomer to I.S. and x is the concentration of each enantiomer in plasma).

At three distinct concentrations (6.25, 25, and 50 \u00b5g/mL of PIO racemates in plasma), the absolute recovery for each enantiomer was evaluated. The range of mean percentage recovery for the two enantiomers was 95.3% to 97.38 \u00b1 2.99%. At 10 \u00b5g/mL, a mean percentage recovery of 97.80 \u00b1 2.99% was attained for the internal standard.\n2.3.2.

For PIO-R, the % CV values of within-run precision ranged from 0.16066% to 0.98899%, and the % RE of within-run precision ranged from 0.0642% to 0.2458%. For between-run precision, the % CV values for PIO-S ranged from 0.2080% to 0.7919%, while the % RE varied from 0.0624% to 0.2701%. For PIO-R, the % CV values for between-run precision differed from 0.3972% to 0.7798%, and the % RE varied from \u22120.3641% to 0.1369%. The precision results at LQC, MQC, and HQC were within a variation of +15% CV, while the precision at LLOQ had a variation of +20% CV.

These stability tests and accuracy were discovered to be within \u00b115% of the anticipated concentration at LQC and HQC, which is consistent with the standards for bioanalytical testing established by the US FDA (Table 2). These findings show that the enantiomers of PIO were stable and did not convert or racemize throughout the investigation.

When compared to PBS alone, PIO-R and PIO-S demonstrated dose-dependent glucose absorption for 2-NBDG relative fluorescence intensity. PIO-R showed enhanced glucose absorption compared to PIO-S. In the illustration, 2-NBDG expression was displayed using histograms overlaid on PIO-S and PIO-R treated 3T3-L1 cell lines (Figure 3). A bar graph plotting the percentage of cells expressed by 2-NBDG uptake for control, PIO-R, and PIO-S mixtures treated with 3T3-L1 cells after drug treatment is portrayed in Figure 4, along with the results represented in Table 3 based on one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test was employed.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4911 7 of 14olecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 \u00a0 5\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a03.\u00a0Overlaid\u00a0histograms\u00a0representing\u00a0the\u00a02-NBDG\u00a0expression\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0PIO-R\u00a0(a)\u00a0and\u00a0PIOS\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a03T3-L1\u00a0cells\u00a0(b).\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ni r . l i ist ra s representing the 2-NBDG expres ion observed in PIO-R (a) and PIO-S treated with 3T -L1 cells (b).\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0A\u00a0bar\u00a0graph\u00a0plotting\u00a0the\u00a0percentage\u00a0of\u00a0cells\u00a0expressed\u00a0by\u00a02-NBDG\u00a0uptake\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0control,\u00a0\nPIO-R,\u00a0and\u00a0PIO-S\u00a0mixtures\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a03T3-L1\u00a0cells\u00a0after\u00a0drug\u00a0treatment.\u00a0***\u2014Denotes\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.001\u00a0\nsignificant\u00a0difference\u00a0in\u00a0comparison\u00a0with\u00a0PIO-R\u00a0and\u00a0PIO-S,\u00a0###\u2014Denotes\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.001\u00a0significant\u00a0dif-\nference\u00a0in\u00a0comparison\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0control\u00a0group.\u00a0Data\u00a0represent\u00a0mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0(n\u00a0=\u00a06)\u00a0one-way\u00a0ANOVA\u00a0\nfollowed\u00a0by\u00a0Tukey\u2019s\u00a0multiple\u00a0comparison\u00a0test\u00a0was\u00a0employed.\u00a0\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4911 8 of 14"

            "text": "The plasma concentrations of two racemic PIO enantiomers were examined after oral administration of 30 mg/kg PIO racemic to female Albino Wistar rats. Female rats\u2019 mean plasma levels of both PIO enantiomers were plotted against time in Figure 5. Table 4 summarizes the non-compartmental methods-derived pharmacokinetic characteristics of two enantiomers in albino Wistar female rats. (PIO-R and PIO-S was rapidly absorbed from tablets in female rats, with identical Tmax\u2019s of 4 h, but PIO-S was eliminated faster and had a shorter T1/2. At each time point, the concentration plasma profile of (R)-PIO was higher than that of PIO-S in female rats depicted in Figure 5. Compared to PIO-S, (R)PIOs Cmax, AUC last (h*\u00b5g/mL), AUCINF_obs (h*\u00b5g/mL), and AUC_% Extrap_obs (%) were about 18.73, 260.56, 266.49 and 9.35 times as high, respectively, indicating improved adsorption and distribution as shown in Table 4 [12]. These findings imply that PIO is disposed of in rats in an enantioselective manner. Using a student\u2019s t-test (Graphpad\u2019s Prism v.9 software), we compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of PIO-R enantiomer with those of PIO-S, and the majority of the parameters had a p value greater than 0.05. We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of PIO-R enantiomer with those of PIO-Senantiomer, and the majority of the parameters had a p value greater than 0.05. Results showed considerable differences between R and S-enantiomers, with PIO-R having the highest activity. The observation that the PIO-R enantiomer had higher concentrations in plasma and a lower affinity for PPAR-gamma receptors, as indicated by the AUCisomer (R)/AUCisomer (S) ratio of more than 2.0, suggests that stereoselectivity plays a crucial role in the pharmacological activity of PIO [13]. Stereoselectivity discrepancies between PIO enantiomers in rats may be caused by chiral inversion or a different metabolism rate in rats, and more research is needed to understand the precise causes.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0

            "text": "A semi-automated biochemistry analyzer analyzed kinetic plasma samples. The concentration (\u00b5g/mL) against time points (hours) of PIO was plotted to estimate glucose concentration in rat plasma, as displayed in Figure 6. PIO-R decreased glucose (\u00b5g/mL) concentration in rat plasma compared to PIO-S, indicating that PIO-R suppressed glucose enhancement (Table 5). GraphPad Prism 9\u2019s one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test were used to evaluate PIO R- and S enantiomers glucose concentrations in rat plasma. The results revealed that they were almost a significant difference after 4 h (Figure 6). p values were higher than 0.05. Therefore, by using the fixed time kinetic approach, we may conclude that the PIO-R demonstrated increased activity compared to PIO-S in racemic form.

Containers were labeled as blanks, standards, and tests. A 1000 \u00b5L quantity of standard reagent and 10 \u00b5L of distilled water were combined to make a blank analytical tube.

Each enantiomer\u2019s detection limit (LOD) and quantification limit (LOQ) were considered.\n3.8.2. Recovery\nWe assessed the peak area ratios of the enantiomer to the internal standard at 3 concentrations (every five runs) based on post-extraction spiked samples to determine enantiomer recovery. Similarly, I.S. recovery was also evaluated at 10 \u00b5g/mL [15]. The analytes\u2019 and I.S.\u2019s absolute recoveries do not have to be 100%, but the recovery limit should be constant, unambiguous, and replicable.\n3.8.3. Precision and Accuracy\nOn five consecutive days, five replicates with similar concentrations were compared to test precision and accuracy. Precision was quantified by determining %CV (Coefficient of variation) for all four QC levels [16]. While accuracy was represented as a percentage relative error (R.E.%). Except for the LOQ, the acceptable bounds for precision and accuracy were 15% relative standard deviation and 15% relative error, respectively [17].\n3.8.4. Stability Biomatrix stability was tested for six hours at ambient temperature (25\u201322 \u25e6C) for each enantiomer (bench top). PIO racemate samples were stored at around \u221220 \u25e6C for 30 days to evaluate their freeze stability throughout three stages. Throughout each freeze-thaw cycle, spiked plasma samples were frozen for 24 h at \u221220 \u25e6C and thawed at room temperature.

To optimize the therapeutic efficacy of chiral drugs, it may be necessary to separate the two enantiomers and administer only the active isomer. Additionally, the HPLC method developed and validated in this study provides a reliable and sensitive tool for measuring PIO enantiomers in plasma. In 3T3 L1 cells, PIO-R exhibited greater glucose uptake by relative fluorescence intensity for 2-NBDG than PIO-S. This method can be used in future studies aimed at investigating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PIO after oral administration of racemic PIO at 30 mg/kg in female albino Wistar rats. In the case of PIO, the two enantiomers, PIO-R and PIO-S, have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Our results showed that PIO-R had higher concentrations in plasma and a lower affinity for PPAR-gamma receptors than (S)-PIO. This suggests that PIO-R may be responsible for the majority of the pharmacological activity of the racemic mixture. The AUCisomer (R)/AUCisomer (S) ratio of more than 2.0 indicates that the concentration of PIO-R is more than two times higher than that of PIO-S, which supports the notion that PIO-R plays a more significant role in the pharmacological activity of PIO. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering enantioselectivity in drug development and clinical practice, as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enantiomers can differ significantly. The discovery of discrepancies in the plasma levels of PIO enantiomers in female rats highlights the importance of considering gender differences in drug metabolism and distribution. This finding suggests that factors such as sex hormones, body composition, and liver enzyme activity may play a vital role in the observed stereoselectivity. Further investigations into the underlying mechanisms of these differences may lead to the development of more targeted and effective treatments for female patients and are needed to identify the precise causes of these stereoselectivity variations. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to the development of more effective therapies for a range of conditions. Overall, our study provides important insights into the pharmacokinetics of PIO enantiomers in rats and their potential impact on drug efficacy.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.S. and B.G.; methodology, V.V.N.G. and T.S.; software, S.T. and R.A.M.O.; validation, M.R., M.M.A. and S.A.F.; formal analysis, T.S. and V.V.N.G.; investigation, T.S.; resources, S.M.H. and S.T.; data curation, R.A.M.O. and T.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.S., B.G. and R.A.M.O.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.R. and M.M.A.; visualization, S.A.F. and S.M.H.; supervision, V.V.N.G.; project administration, B.G.; funding acquisition, M.R.
