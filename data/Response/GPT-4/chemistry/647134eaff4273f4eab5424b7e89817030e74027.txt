1. **Expansion to Other Protein Classes and Structures:** While this study focused on coiled-coil peptides and demonstrated utility with the HIV-1 envelope protein, future research could explore the applicability of the Bind&Bite method to other protein classes and structures, such as globular proteins, membrane proteins, and intrinsically disordered proteins. This would help in understanding the versatility and limitations of the method across different protein architectures.

2. **Development of Cell-Permeable Peptide Adapters:** Given the non-requirement for cysteine residues and enzymes, a logical next step could be to design and synthesize cell-permeable peptide adapters that can facilitate intracellular protein modifications. This could open new pathways for studying protein function in living cells, creating intracellular biologics, and developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting previously 'undruggable' proteins within cells.

3. **High-Throughput Screening of Coiled-Coil Pairs:** To further enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the Bind&Bite method, a high-throughput screening approach could be employed to discover new pairs of coiled-coil peptides that form heterodimers with high specificity and stability. This could also include the use of computational models and machine learning algorithms to predict peptide sequences that would likely form stable, selective coiled-coils.

4. **Application in Targeted Drug Delivery:** The demonstrated ability to selectively and covalently attach chemical moieties to proteins suggests the potential for developing targeted drug delivery systems. Future research could focus on attaching therapeutic agents, imaging probes, or other functional molecules to antibodies or other targeting proteins, which could then selectively bind to and act on specific cells or tissues in the body.

5. **Investigation of Mutually Selective Coiled-Coils for Multiplex Protein Labeling:** The paper highlights the successful generation of mutually selective pairs of peptide adapters. This principle could be extended to design a versatile toolkit for simultaneous, site-specific labeling of multiple proteins within the same sample. This would be highly valuable for studying complex biological systems, protein-protein interactions, and multi-component signaling pathways in real-time. Moreover, this approach could be leveraged for the development of multi-functional biomaterials and biosensors.
