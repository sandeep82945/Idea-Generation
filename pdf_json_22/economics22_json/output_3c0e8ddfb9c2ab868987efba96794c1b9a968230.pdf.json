It immediately led to an explosion in research, particularly in medicine (Haghani & Bliemer, 2020; Pal, 2021). It also led to an increase in social science research and more specifically economics in order to assess the consequences of the pandemic with an enormous number of new working papers sprawling.\nWe want to evaluate how these Covid-19-related working papers in economics compare to non-Covid papers published in a number of ways. The analyses by Homolak et\u00a0al. (2020), Aviv-Reuven and Rosenfeld (2021) and Cai et\u00a0al. (2021) show across fields that Covid papers are written by fewer authors and with less international collaboration. In economics, both Nagy et\u00a0al. (2021) and Mahi et\u00a0al. (2021) provide an overview how the number of Covid-related papers increased. Biondi et\u00a0al. (2021) detected an increase in journal submissions and fewer female reviewers being available while Kruger et\u00a0al. (2020) in addition found that women saw a smaller increase in their productivity than men which is also\n* Klaus Wohlrabe wohlrabe@ifo.de\nConstantin B\u00fcrgi constantin.burgi@ucd.ie\n1 School of\u00a0Economics, University College Dublin, Belfield,\u00a0Dublin\u00a04, Ireland 2 ifo Institute for\u00a0Economic Research, Poschingerstr. 5, 81679\u00a0Munich, Germany\n1 3\nsupported by Deryugina et\u00a0 al. (2021), Myers et\u00a0 al. (2020), Amano-Pati\u00f1o et\u00a0 al. (2020), Squazzoni et\u00a0al. (2021).\nWe want to assess whether economics also saw less collaboration and which research topics based on Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes were of particular interest since the outbreak of Covid-19. We also investigate two metrics after the working paper has become available, namely the number of citations and downloads of the working papers. Fraser et\u00a0al. (2021) found that there is a dramatic increase in the number of citations and sharing of Covid-related papers in general science.\nIn order to assess the impact of Covid-19, we use data from five (major) working paper series in economics obtained by scraping the RePEc website. We provide some descriptive statistics and regression-based evidence to answer how the different metrics differ for Covid-related research relative to non-Covid research. We focus on working papers as they are a rapid communication channel and they are quite common and have long standing tradition in economics.1 Furthermore, the publication process in economics is quite slow (Ellison, 2002) and it takes sometimes quite long until a working paper has been published in a refereed journal (Baumann & Wohlrabe, 2020a).\nWhile we focus on some aspects of the publication process from a producer perspective of research, there have also been important changes to the reviewing process and how research is conducted. The wealth of new papers and impacts on the everyday live has affected the reviewing process. For example, Kodvanj et\u00a0al. (2022) and Aviv-Reuven and Rosenfeld (2021) show that Covid related articles have been processed faster during peer review. Furthermore, there have been a number of retractions and corrections in response to the impacts, see, e.g., Haunschild and Bornmann (2021), Soltani and Patini (2020), Moradi and Abdi (2021), Bagdasarian et\u00a0al. (2020) or Benjamens et\u00a0al. (2021). In addition, what research has been published has also changed during the pandemic. In the beginning, it was mainly secondary studies (Di Girolamo and Reynders, 2020) that were not specifically about Covid but adapted to include Covid. Only later, primary studies that are specifically about Covid emerged."

            "heading": "Data",
            "text": "We collected all working papers made available between 2015 and August 2021 in the following five working paper series:\n\u2022 NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) Working Papers \u2022 CEPR (Centre for European Policy Research) Discussion Papers \u2022 IZA (Institut f\u00fcr die Zukunft der Arbeit) Discussion Papers \u2022 CESifo (Center for Economic Studies) Working Papers \u2022 MPRA (Munich Personl RePEc Archive) Working Papers\nThe first four series are network based, meaning that the authors need to be part of the respective network while anyone can make working papers available in the last one. This choice is driven by the number of yearly published papers, reputation and influence\n1 Working paper or pre-prints series have also been established in the natural sciences like arxiv.org or, more recently, medRxiv.org or bioRxiv.org.\n1 3\n(Baumann & Wohlrabe, 2020). Note that the network membership only affects authors and not potential users, meaning that working papers are freely available independently of network membership. In case of the MPRA working papers, there are no restrictions concerning who is submitting. The original intention was to provide a platform for authors who do not have access to institutional working paper series.\nFor each paper, we collected the title, the publication year/month, keywords, abstract, JEL codes, authors, downloads and citations from the RePEc website. The RePec website only provides the publication year and not the publication month directly. However, as it provides monthly download statistics, we are able to infer the publication month based on the first month where download figures are reported.2 For a few papers, citations and downloads were not available. Therefore we could not define the exact publication date with respect to the month but we have the publication year. Additionally, Baumann and Wohlrabe (2020) have shown that many papers are published in several working paper series simultaneously. In our sample this applies to 2034 papers. We merge the multiple papers into one paper by summing up the number of downloads across versions. RePEc consolidates citations over different versions but often with a time lag. Therefore, we take the maximum of citations across versions as in Wohlrabe and B\u00fcrgi (2021). The merged paper is then assigned in a hierarchical way to one of the working paper series using the order listed above. For example, a paper that was in all five working paper series will only show up in NBER once merged. Our results are robust to using a random assignment or reverse ordering.\nIn order to identify Covid and non-Covid papers, we searched the keywords, abstract and title for the three terms \u201cCorona\u201d, \u201cCovid\u201d and \u201cpandemic\u201d. If at least one of the three terms was found, we deemed the paper to be a Covid paper. Table\u00a01 provides an overview over this sample. The sample refers to unique working papers, i.e., papers appearing in several working papers series are counted only once.\nWe have around 47 thousand papers in our sample, where about 20% of which were made available since January 2020. Of these papers, 15% were Covid-related papers. This share varies between 12 and 18% across series. Comparing the number of working papers\n2 Download data in RePEc is available via https://logec.repec.org/.\n1 3\nreleased at a given point in time, we find that most were released in May 2020 with 174 and there has been a steady decline since then as Fig.\u00a01 shows."

            "text": "In a first step, we compare the topics of the different papers based on the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes. In economics, the assignment of publications to sub-fields has a long history. Early classification attempts by the American Economic Association go back to the beginning of the 20th century when ten major categories were defined in the American Economic Review. These categories were developed to arrange publications to their subject matter and have subsequently been revised several times and transferred to the EconLit system, including JEL codes. The majority of economics journals ask authors to provide JEL codes for their papers. Cherrier (2017) provides a detailed overview of the history and meaning of JEL codes. In its current form (since 1991) all JEL codes - the main categories - are designed as \u2019Exx\u2019, i.e. a letter plus two stages of subcategories indicated by numbers (see https:// www. aeaweb. org/ jel/ guide/ jel. php). We focus on the 20 main categories represented by the letters.\nFor each JEL category, we add up all the JEL codes listed in the papers and divide their sum by the total number of papers. As many papers have multiple codes (2.14 on average), the fractions do not add up to one. For the pre-crisis period we take the average of JEL distribution over the period 2015-2019 in order to avoid to average out short-run developments. Comparing the pre-crisis (column two) period with all papers from the crisis period\n1 3\n(column three) there are only minor differences.3 There is a notable increase of six percentage points for the health section (JEL code I). Comparing Covid-papers with non-Covid papers within the crisis period, one can spot several clear differences. The two topics with the largest difference for Covid papers (column three) relative to the other papers (column four) are macroeconomics (E) and health/education (I). Whereas the latter on is not surprising, macroeconomics might reflect the impact on the overall economy.\nConversely, it appears that microeconomics and economic development saw a clear dip in their share for Covid papers, even if the overall share (column three) was not much affected. One explanation for this finding could be that researchers in these fields did not switch to writing Covid-related papers to the same extent as other subject fields like macroeconomics and health.\nLooking at the development of JEL codes over time from February 2020 to August 2021 there are no obvious trends in the JEL distribution, i.e. the chosen topics, defined by the assigned JEL codes, remained fairly the same across time.\nAs the share of health paper has increased considerably, we want to take a closer look at these papers. We collected all corresponding co-JEL codes of a paper, i.e. codes that are assigned in addition to the JEL code I for health. We compare the distribution before and after the outbreak of the pandemic. In Table\u00a03 we show the results. Without distinguishing between Covid and non-Covid papers there are no substantial differences of the co-JEL code distribution. By comparing them in the last two columns there are two main issues. First, for there is an increase of macro-related topics (JEL Code E) for Covid papers which goes in line with the results presented in Table\u00a02. Second, labour and demographic issues (JEL Code J) have been more seldomly assigned to health papers in case of non-Covid papers."

            "text": "Next, we compare the number of authors that each paper has. We can think of two opposing forces regarding the number of authors. On one hand, the lock-downs and travel restrictions make it harder to collaborate with other authors. This could in turn lower the number of authors for each paper as evidenced in Homolak et\u00a0al. (2020), Aviv-Reuven and Rosenfeld (2021) and Cai et\u00a0 al. (2021) for general science papers. At the same time, authors might have wanted to publish their research as soon as possible in order to be the first to make a working paper available. The collaboration of several authors can allow the paper to be completed faster and hence Covid papers might have more authors as a result. Table\u00a04 provides some descriptive statistics. Covid-related papers are written on average by 0.3 more authors compared to non-Covid papers. The general relationship holds across all series except the MPRA series, where the Covid papers are written by fewer authors on average. The largest team comprised 43 authors. In Fig.\u00a0 2, we show the distribution of papers graphically using boxplots. The median paper has 2-3 authors and Covid papers have a much higher variance in the number of authors than other papers. If we take a closer look at papers with a health JEL code (I) we see a similar picture. Covid papers are written on average by 3.1 authors, whereas non-Covid papers by 2.9.\nIn order to check whether these difference are statistically significant after controlling for working paper and topic fixed effects in the form of dummy variables we run three\n3 Rath and Wohlrabe (2016) outline the general development of JEL codes over time.\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 2\nJE L-\nC od\ne co\nm pa\nris on\nTh is\nta bl\ne sh\now s\nth e\nfr ac\ntio n\nof w\nor ki\nng p\nap er\ns w\nith a\nJE L\nco de\nc or\nre sp\non di\nng to\ne ac\nh ca\nte go\nry .

The first is an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. As we deal with count data we also consider a Poison regression model and a negative binomial regression (NBREG) model. The variable of interest is a dummy variable which takes a value of one in case of a Covid-related paper and zero otherwise. The top panel of Table\u00a05 shows the regression results. The coefficients of Covid-related papers dummy are positive and highly statistically significant across all three regression models. Thus, our results stand in contrast to the natural sciences, where the number of authors have decreased for Covid-19 papers. If papers with five or more authors\u00a0(95% percentile) are excluded as shown in the bottom panel, there is no relationship between Covid-papers and the number of authors anymore. This suggests that the results are driven by papers with many authors. Based on the distribution shown in Fig.\u00a0 2, this result is to be expected as Covid papers are more affected by this restriction than other papers. In both panels in\u00a0Table\u00a05 the R-squared is rather low which points to the issue that there are more drivers of co-authorship that could not be considered here."

            "heading": "Downloads",
            "text": "Next, we address how many downloads articles receive depending on whether they were Covid-related or not. As shown in Table\u00a06, Covid papers generally get downloaded approximately twice as often compared to non-Covid papers. The most downloaded paper is Sforza and Steininger (2020) with 1116 downloads. CESifo and NBER working papers are downloaded more often on average than the other three series on RePEc. In Fig.\u00a03, we show the corresponding boxplots. Generally, the distribution of downloads is very skewed. Covid papers have a much higher variability in the number of downloads than other papers.\nFor downloads, the log OLS and negative binomial regressions are of particular importance as the distribution is very skewed. The first two columns of Table\u00a07 show the results for total downloads without taking into account that some articles have been released earlier than others. The Covid dummy is highly statistically significant. In the OLS case a Covid paper receives, ceteris paribus, 17 downloads more than non-Covid papers. In the last column we normalized the downloads by dividing the total downloads by the number of months an article has been made available as a working paper. The results remain robust to this measure as the last column of Table\u00a07 shows.4\nAs the lower panel in Table\u00a0 6 shows, our results are robust to excluding frequently downloaded papers, again, based on the 95% quantile. While the coefficients become somewhat smaller, they remain highly significant. Based on the distribution shown in Fig.\u00a03, this result is to be expected as Covid papers are more affected by this restriction than other papers."

            "text": "We have shown that around 15% of economic working papers have been Covid-related between January 2020 and August 2021. This share has decreased since the peak in spring 2020 but there is still a steady flow of Covid papers. When comparing the Covid papers to non-Covid papers made available as working papers at the same time, we find that Covid papers are written by larger teams, are downloaded more often and receive more citations. This somewhat contrasts with general science where articles are written by fewer authors. Further research might be able to determine the exact causes for this divergent pattern.\n1 3\nOne important limitation of this paper is that we only looked at the data available on RePEc. While the analysis about JEL codes and the number of authors does not require any additional assumption, the analysis about downloads and citations does. Specifically, there are many places where one can download a working paper including the working paper series website. As a result, we only have a subset of the downloads and need to assume that our sample is representative. Similarly to the downloads, RePEc is somewhat of a closed system regarding citations. Citations are only tracked for papers within RePEc. If for example a medical journal cites an article available on RePEc, this is not counted towards the citation count of the article. As with downloads, we thus need to assume that our data set is representative.\nSome potential extensions for future research of our work could include a more granular split into topics using several digits of the JEL code instead of the one digit used here. How the pandemic affected male vs. female researchers differently and last but not least, where the working papers end up. Baumann and Wohlrabe (2020) have found that around two thirds of working papers get published in peer reviewed journals. It would be interesting to see whether this is the case for Covid papers as well and whether the bump in citations from publication is similar to other papers e.g. see (Wohlrabe & B\u00fcrgi, 2021).\nIn the future one could repeat our analysis for articles finally published in a journal. As noted before, the publication process is quite slow in economics. We found only two articles according to our search criteria that were published in the so-called top five journals in economics (Bornmann et\u00a0al., 2018) that have been published in the last two years.\n1 3\nAcknowledgements We thank participants at ZBW Workshop \u201cThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on publication behaviour in Economics and Business Studies\u201d in September 2021 for helpful comments.
