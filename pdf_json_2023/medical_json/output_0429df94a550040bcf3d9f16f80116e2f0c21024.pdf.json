            "text": "(CV) morbidity and mortality, but the benefit of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 28 therapy is uncertain. However, most randomized-controlled trials have focused on the role of 29 CPAP in secondary prevention although there is growing evidence of a potential benefit on 30 early CV disease. Weight loss in combination with CPAP may be superior but is difficult to 31 achieve and maintain with conventional measures alone. The aim of this study was to gain 32 insights into the effect of CPAP on early atherosclerotic processes and to compare it to a 33 glucagon-like-peptide (GLP)-1-mediated weight loss regimen in OSA. 34 Methods: We performed a randomized proof-of-concept study (clinicaltrials.gov: 35 NCT04186494) comparing CPAP, a liraglutide-based weight loss regimen (Lir) alone or both 36 in combination for 24 weeks in 30 non-diabetic patients with moderate to severe OSA (50\u00b17 37 years, 80% males, apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 50\u00b119/hr, body mass index [BMI] 35.0 \u00b13 38 kg/m2). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Beside extensive evaluation for 39 CV risk factors and endothelial function at baseline and end of study, subjects underwent 40 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET-CT for measurement of aortic wall inflammation 41 (target-to-background ratio [TBR]) and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for semi-42 automated coronary plaque analysis. 43 Results: CPAP alone and combination resulted in greater reduction in AHI than Lir alone at 44 24 weeks (mean difference -45/hr and -43/hr, respectively, vs -12/hr, p<0.05). Both Lir and 45 combination led to significant weight loss of 6\u00b13% and 4\u00b14%, respectively. Despite CPAP 46 resulting in small weight gain, only the CPAP alone group demonstrated a significant 47 decrease in vascular inflammation (aortic wall TBR from 2.03\u00b10.34 to 1.84\u00b10.43, p 0.010) 48 associated with improvement in endothelial function and decrease in C-reactive protein. 49 Low-attenuation coronary artery plaque volume as marker of unstable plaque also decreased 50\nwith CPAP (from 571\u00b1490 to 334\u00b1185mm3) and with combination therapy (from 401\u00b1145 to 51 278\u00b1126mm3) but not with Lir. 52 Conclusion: These data suggest that CPAP therapy, but not GLP-1 mediated weight loss, 53 improves vascular inflammation and reduces low-attenuation coronary artery plaque volume 54 in OSA patients. These novel findings support the benefit of CPAP therapy in modifying 55 early CV disease. 56\nClinical Perspective 57\nWhat is new? 58\n\u2022 This is the first study comparing standard CPAP therapy to a GLP-1 mediated weight 59 loss regimen in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 60\n\u2022 The study utilized 18F-FDG PET CT and artificial intelligence-enabled coronary CT 61 quantification of coronary artery plaque subtypes to determine treatment effects on 62 early atherosclerotic disease processes. 63 What are the clinical implications? 64\n\u2022 CPAP in contrast to GLP-1-mediated weight loss may improve early atherosclerotic 65 and potentially modifiable disease processes in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 66\n\u2022 These data support the benefit of CPAP in the primary prevention of cardiovascular 67 diseases in OSA. 68 69\nNon-standard Abbreviations and Acronyms 70 \u2022 OSA \u2013 obstructive sleep apnea 71\n\u2022 CV \u2013 cardiovascular 72\n\u2022 CAD \u2013 coronary artery disease 73\n\u2022 CPAP \u2013 continuous positive airway pressure 74\n\u2022 RCT \u2013 randomized controlled trial 75\n\u2022 PET-CT - positron emission tomography-computed tomography 76\n\u2022 FDG - fluoro2-deoxy-D-glucose 77\n\u2022 CCTA - coronary computed tomographic angiography 78\n\u2022 CP \u2013 calcified plaque 79\n\u2022 NCP \u2013 non-calcified plaque 80\n\u2022 LD \u2013 low density 81\n\u2022 GLP \u2013 glucagon like peptide 82\n\u2022 AHI \u2013 apnea/hypopnea index 83\n\u2022 BMI \u2013 body mass index 84\n\u2022 ABPM \u2013 ambulatory blood pressure measurement 85\n\u2022 PSG \u2013 polysomnpgraphy 86\n\u2022 AASM \u2013 American Academy of Sleep Medicine 87\n\u2022 RHI \u2013 reactive hyperemia index 88\n\u2022 PAT \u2013 peripheral arterial tone 89\n\u2022 TBR \u2013 target-to-background ratio 90\n\u2022 CAC \u2013 coronary artery calcium 91\n\u2022 HbA1c - glycosylated hemoglobin 92\n\u2022 SpO2 - oxygen saturation 93 \u2022 ODI \u2013 oxygen desaturation index 94\n\u2022 TST90 - time spent with SpO2<90% of total sleep time 95 96\nIntroduction 97\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition conveying a significant 98 public health burden1,2. Corroborated by numerous studies it has been identified as a 99\nsignificant and potentially modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of 100 various cardiovascular (CV) diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, 101 heart failure and stroke leading to substantial morbidity and mortality2,3. 102 The benefit of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, the treatment of 103 choice for the majority of patients, on CV disease processes, remains uncertain and although 104 impacted by important methodological limitations, secondary prevention trials have failed to 105 demonstrate a significant modifying effect on CV outcomes4-6. However, various randomized 106 controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses have supported a benefit of CPAP on CV risk 107 factors such as blood pressure7,8, endothelial dysfunction9, arterial stiffness10, and circulating 108 inflammatory markers11,12 and thus, CPAP may be particularly beneficial in the early stages 109 of CV disease processes. There is a lack of studies focusing on early atherosclerotic processes 110 in OSA and in the absence of definite primary prevention RCT\u2019s, which are an unrealistic 111 goal in the field, such studies may assist in the guidance of personalized treatments. 112 Advances in CV imaging techniques may help to fill this gap. The use of positron emission 113 tomography-computed tomographic (PET-CT) imaging with 18F-fluoro2-deoxy-D-glucose 114 (18F-FDG) to measure vascular inflammation is an emerging method of predicting CV 115 disease. In the largest cohort study to date comprising 932 cancer patients without a history 116 of CV disease, aortic wall uptake of 18F-FDG was the strongest predictor of a subsequent 117 vascular event13. 118 Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is widely used to evaluate CAD and CV risk, 119 traditionally focusing on calcified plaque (CP) and coronary artery calcium scores14. 120 However, recent advances in artificial intelligence analysis methods have allowed for semi-121\nautomated quantification of non-calcified (NCP) and low-density (LD NCP) plaques, which 122 have been shown to be stronger predictors of future cardiovascular events than calcified 123 plaques15,16. 124 We hypothesized that CPAP improves early CV disease processes. To explore this 125 hypothesis and to inform the design of future large RCT\u2019s, we performed this proof-of-126 concept prospective RCT comparing CPAP versus a glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 127 (Liraglutide) -based weight loss regimen versus both in combination. This comparison was 128 chosen based on the work of Chirinos et al, who found that a combination of weight loss and 129 CPAP therapy may be superior to either treatment alone across a range of outcomes17. We 130 integrated the primary outcome determining early CV disease with various risk markers in 131 relation to inflammation, endothelial function, and blood pressure. 132\nMethods 133\nStudy Protocol 134 This was a proof-of-concept, randomized, parallel, 24-week trial comparing the 135 effects of CPAP, a liraglutide-based weight loss regimen (Lir) or both in combination in 136 adults with newly diagnosed moderate to severe OSA (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI]>15/hr). 137 Eligible participants were aged 18-60 years, had a body-mass index (BMI) between 30\u201340 138 kg/m2, and no history of diabetes, heart failure or unstable cardiovascular disease defined as 139 lack of cardiovascular event within the preceding 3 months. Detailed inclusion and exclusion 140 criteria are provided in Supplementary Table S1 and the trial design with outcome measures 141 is outlined in Supplementary Figure S1. Randomization was conducted using block design. 142 The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of St. Vincent\u2019s University Hospital and 143 registered with clinical trials.gov (NCT04186494). Participants gave written informed 144 consent. 145 Interventions 146\nIn the CPAP and combined-intervention groups, participants were initiated on CPAP 147 therapy according to the standard protocol in our center. Briefly, patients undergo an 148 education and mask fitting session with a clinical sleep nurse specialist before setup on auto-149 PAP at home (AirSense 10, ResMed, UK). Adherence to CPAP therapy is monitored 150 remotely and subjects are followed up by the treating clinician and specialist nurse after 4-6 151 weeks. Pressure settings are adjusted according to the discretion of the treating clinician. 152 Participants in the Lir and combination groups received education about 153 administration of subcutaneous injections and specific guidance about Liraglutide. In 154 addition, counselling on diet and exercise was provided at 4 and 12 weeks. Advice was based 155 around accepted Irish public health guidelines following the food pyramid 156 recommendations18 on portion sizes and food groups and current recommended weekly 157 exercise amounts of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week19. Subjects 158 commenced Liraglutide (Novo Nordisk, Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark) 0.6mg once daily at week 1, 159 increasing by 0.6mg weekly until the maximum dose of 3.0mg was achieved, which was then 160 continued for the 24-week intervention. Progress, adverse effects, and safety were monitored 161 routinely at 4 and 12 weeks or in between if required, and serum amylase levels were 162 checked monthly. 163 Study Assessments and End Points 164 All assessments were performed at baseline and at 24 weeks (Supplementary Figure 165 S1). Fasting blood samples for measurement of metabolic, biochemical, and inflammatory 166 parameters were obtained in the morning after overnight polysomnography (PSG). 24-hour 167 ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) was performed using WatchBP03 devices 168 (Microlife Corp., Taipei, Taiwan). Measurements were taken every 20 minutes during the 169 day and every 30 minutes at night-time. Non-dipping blood pressure status was defined as 170 <10% decline in systolic blood pressure from day to night. 171\nPolysomnography (PSG) 172 Attended, in-laboratory PSG was performed using standard techniques 173 (SOMNOmedics, Randersacker, Germany) and analyzed according to the American 174 Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2.6 scoring criteria20. An apnea was defined as a 90% 175 drop in airflow from baseline for >10 seconds. A hypopnea was defined as a drop in airflow 176 of >30% from baseline for >10 seconds, accompanied by an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an 177 arousal. Repeat PSG at 24 weeks was performed on CPAP for those randomized to this 178 treatment. 179 Endothelial Function 180 Evaluation of peripheral endothelial function via the EndoPAT 2000 device (Itamar 181 Medical, Israel) is a validated, FDA-approved method21. Endothelial function was expressed 182 as reactive hyperemia index (RHI) calculated as the ratio of the post-occlusion to pre-183 occlusion peripheral arterial tone (PAT) amplitude of the tested arm, divided by the post-184 occlusion to pre-occlusion ratio obtained in the control arm22. Measurements were performed 185 according to the manufacturer's instructions with a cut-off value of <1.69 defining endothelial 186 dysfunction. 187 18F-FDG PET-CT 188 All 18F-FDG PET-CT examinations were performed on a Siemens Biograph mCT 189 PET/CT system (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) in line with prior 190 recommendations23 (see Supplementary Methods). PET image analysis to measure aortic wall 191 vascular inflammation was performed in consensus by 2 radiologists blinded to all clinical 192 information, using dedicated PET-CT image viewing software (SyngoVia, Siemens 193 Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) according to a previously validated methodology24,25. 194 Briefly, sequential circular regions of interest were placed across the aortic wall from the root 195 to the abdominal bifurcation on axial images, with total aorta SUVmax calculated as the mean 196\nof these individual measurements. A target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated by 197 dividing total aorta SUVmax by mediastinal blood pool activity (average of three 198 measurements of blood pool SUVmax made at the SVC on sequential slices). 199 Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) Protocol and Image Analysis 200 CCTA images were acquired on a 64-slice single-source CT scanner (Gemstone 750 201 HD, GE, Milwaukee, USA) according to standard CCTA protocols (see Supplementary 202 Methods). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score was assessed using the Agatston score26. 203 Coronary arteries were visually assessed on a 15-segment basis by a cardiothoracic 204 radiologist. Quantitative assessment of atherosclerotic plaque subtypes was performed using 205 previously validated semiautomatic software (CVi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc, 206 Calgary, Canada)27 by one observer blinded to all clinical information (see Supplementary 207 Methods). Plaque volumes were measured for the following plaque subtypes: total plaque, 208 calcified plaque (CP), noncalcified plaque (NCP) and low-attenuation plaque (LD NCP) 209 defined by an attenuation of <30 Hounsfield units16. CCTA was performed at baseline in all 210 subjects. Ethical approval for follow-up CCTA was only granted for subjects with visible CV 211 disease at baseline due to concern of excess radiation exposure. 212 Statistical Analysis 213 This was an exploratory proof-of-concept study with the purpose of aiding the 214 planning of future larger RCT\u2019s. Therefore, all statistical analysis presented is for the purpose 215 of exploring signals in treatment differences between groups. Comparisons between groups 216 were performed via one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni analysis or Chi-Square test 217 for categorical variables. Within-group changes were evaluated by paired T-tests. Univariate 218 Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlation between baseline and 219 OSA parameters and CV outcome variables. Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM 220 SPSS Statistics Version 27. 221\nResults 222\nBaseline characteristics 223 450 consecutive patients attending our Sleep Centre were screened of whom 53 met 224 the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 23 did not provide consent. As planned, 30 subjects were 225 enrolled and randomized. Baseline characteristics of the study population are provided in 226 Table 1. As expected for a clinical OSA population, there was a predominance of male, 227 middle-aged participants and most had severe OSA with an AHI of 50\u00b119/hour. The groups 228 were similar with regards to demographic, anthropometric and clinical parameters. There was 229 no significant difference between the groups in 24-hour ABPM, glycosylated hemoglobin 230 (HbA1c) and fasting lipids. 9 patients were on statin treatment: 2 for previously established 231 but stable CV disease, and 7 for dyslipidemia as primary prevention. 232 Study Progress 233 All 30 patients completed the trial and are included in the final analysis 234 (Supplementary Figure S2). Of the 10 subjects commenced on CPAP therapy, one patient 235 crossed over to the Liraglutide arm due to intolerance of CPAP therapy. In each of the 236 Liraglutide and combination groups, one subject crossed over to the CPAP arm due to 237 gastrointestinal side effects with Liraglutide. Thus, the final dataset included n=11 in the 238 CPAP group, n=10 in the Liraglutide group and n=9 in the combination group. All groups 239 remained similar in all baseline characteristics (Supplementary table S2). Apart from those 240 having to stop Liraglutide, adherence to the pharmacological treatment was good as reported 241 by the subjects and by monitoring the contents of the pre-filled pens. Serum amylase was 242 monitored monthly as recommended for patients taking Liraglutide, and there was no 243 significant rise during the trial in any subject. Mean CPAP adherence in the CPAP group was 244 5.8\u00b11.4 hours per night, while adherence in the combination group was 4.7\u00b11.8 hours per 245 night. 246\nAnthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting lipids and C-reactive protein (CRP) 247 As demonstrated in Table 2, both Liraglutide alone and in combination with CPAP 248 led to significant weight loss of 6\u00b13% and 4\u00b14%, respectively, and this was accompanied by 249 an improvement in fasting triglyceride levels. In contrast, subjects on CPAP alone showed an 250 increase in body weight although this did not reach statistical significance (2\u00b15%, p=0.092). 251 No change in 24-hour ABPM was seen in either the CPAP or the combination group, 252 but systolic blood pressure improved in the Liraglutide group (122\u00b18 vs 116\u00b18 mmHg, p = 253 0.031). At baseline, there were 8 non-dippers in the Liraglutide group, 7 in the CPAP group 254 and 5 in the combination group. There was no significant change in non-dipping status in 255 any treatment group at 24 weeks (Table 2). 256 CRP levels improved the most in the CPAP group but there were no statistical 257 differences between groups (Table 2). 258 OSA parameters 259 Polysomnographic respiratory variables at baseline and at follow-up are presented in 260 Table 3. As expected, CPAP alone or in combination resulted in effective treatment of OSA. 261 Liraglutide-mediated weight loss was also accompanied by significant improvement in AHI, 262 but the effect was significantly inferior to CPAP, and the AHI remained high at 42\u00b116/hr. 263 Endothelial Function 264 A RHI via the EndoPAT device of <1.69, indicative of endothelial dysfunction, was 265 present in 2 patients in the Lir group, in 7 patients in the CPAP group and in 2 patients in the 266 combination group at baseline (p = 0.036). There was a negative correlation between RHI 267 and overnight baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) (r = -0.527, p = 0.003) and night-time 268 systolic blood pressure (r= -0.360, p = 0.05), but there was no other correlation with OSA 269 variables. Following the treatment protocol, there was a significant improvement in RHI in 270 the CPAP group only (p = 0.048). 271\nChanges in vascular inflammation evaluated by 18F-FDG PET-CT 272 Vascular inflammation of the aortic wall measured via PET-CT correlated with the 273 degree of baseline endothelial dysfunction as well as with baseline CRP (Supplementary 274 Table S3). In addition, there was a significant relationship between vascular inflammation 275 and both the magnitude of systolic blood pressure nocturnal dip and nocturnal systolic blood 276 pressure. Furthermore, vascular inflammation correlated significantly with the severity of 277 nocturnal hypoxia as measured via basal oxygen saturation (SpO2) (r = -0.499, p = 0.005). 278 There was also a trend towards significant correlation between vascular inflammation and 279 baseline AHI (r=0.342, p=0.064) (Supplementary Table S3). 280 To elucidate the potential confounding effects of statin treatment on vascular 281 inflammation, we repeated the correlation analysis excluding subjects on statin treatment. 282 Correlations between baseline vascular inflammation and AHI and markers related to the 283 severity of intermittent hypoxia became stronger (Supplementary Table S3) and remained 284 significant after controlling for BMI (AHI: r = 0.482, p = 0.031, oxygen desaturation index 285 [ODI]: r = 0.497 p = 0.026, time spent with SpO2<90% of total sleep time [TST90]: r = 286 0.471, p = 0.036). 287 Investigating the change in vascular inflammation over 24 weeks, there was a 288 significant reduction in the CPAP group (change in aortic wall TBR from 2.03\u00b10.34 to 289 1.84\u00b10.43, p 0.010; representative example shown in Figure 1), which was significant when 290 compared to the Liraglutide group (p = 0.028) with a similar trend towards a reduction in 291 inflammation in the combination group. Liraglutide-mediated weight loss alone, however, did 292 not result in a significant change (Figure 2A). The change in vascular inflammation showed a 293 significant negative correlation with change in basal SpO2 (r=-0.412, p=0.026) and a close to 294 significant correlation with change in AHI (r=0.337, p=0.074). Again, when patients on 295\nstatins were excluded, the changes in vascular inflammation in the CPAP and combination 296 groups were enhanced (Figure 2B). 297 Changes in coronary artery plaque volumes 298 Visual analysis of baseline CCTA revealed CAD in 17/30 (47%) subjects, of whom 2 299 had been previously diagnosed. The CAC score in those patients was 65+/-194 with no 300 difference between treatment groups at baseline. Of the 17 subjects with visually identifiable 301 CAD, 11 had single-vessel disease (5 Lir, 3 CPAP, 3 combination), 4 had two-vessel disease 302 (1 Lir, 1 CPAP, 2 combination, and 2 had three-vessel disease (1 CPAP, 1 combination). 303 Quantitative assessment of calcified plaque (CP) volume correlated closely with the visually 304 obtained CAC score (r = 0.767, p <0.001), but there was no relationship between non-305 calcified (NCP) or low-attenuation (LD NCP) volume with this measure. 306 At baseline, all plaque subtype volumes were similar between groups. There was a 307 trend towards significant correlation between LD NCP volume and baseline fasting 308 triglyceride levels (r= 0.366, p = 0.051), and this relationship remained similar following 309 adjustment for BMI (r= 0.365, p = 0.056). There were no significant correlations between 310 plaque measures and OSA parameters in the whole cohort, but TST90 correlated with CP 311 volume in the group who did not take statin medication (r = 0.607, p 0.005). 312 The 17 subjects with visible coronary artery plaque on the baseline scan underwent 313 repeat CCTA after 24 weeks, and those were evenly distributed between groups (6 Lir, 6 314 CPAP, 5 combination). Although limited given the small group, there was a reduction in LD 315 NCP volume with CPAP (619\u00b1532 vs 364\u00b1190 mm3) and with combination therapy 316 (401\u00b1145 vs 278\u00b1126 mm3), and there was no change with Liraglutide alone (545\u00b1335 vs 317 503\u00b1229 mm3) (Figure 3). Changes in total and NCP volume followed similar patterns but 318 there were no relevant changes in CP burden with any treatment. Representative images from 319 a study participant of the CPAP alone arm are presented in Figure 4. 320\nEvaluating the total group of subjects undergoing repeat CCTA, there was a 321 significant univariate correlation between the reduction in NCP volume and the reduction in 322 TST90 (r = 0.505, p = 0.038), and a trend towards significant correlation with the reduction 323 in AHI and ODI (r = 0.457, p = 0.065 and r = 0.463, p = 0.061, respectively) (Figure 5). 324 Furthermore, there was a trend towards significant correlations between the reduction in 325 vascular inflammation and reduction in both NCP and LD NCP volume (r = 0.447, p = 0.072 326 and r = 0.436, p = 0.080, respectively). Finally, improvement in endothelial function as 327 measured by the RHI showed a close to statistically significant correlation with reduction in 328 total plaque volume, but not with either NCP or LD NCP volume (r = -0.475, p = 0.063). 329\nDiscussion 330\nIn this report we demonstrate that CPAP therapy but not a GLP-1-mediated weight 331 loss regimen improves early and potentially modifiable atherosclerotic processes in OSA. As 332 this was a proof-of-concept study with only a small number of participants the statistical 333 differences in improvement in vascular inflammation between the treatment arms are 334 particularly striking and support the benefit of CPAP in the primary prevention of CV disease 335 processes in OSA. The role of CPAP therapy in the treatment of CV diseases and particularly 336 in the prevention of CV events in subjects with OSA has been subject of major controversy. 337 Three randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate attenuation in the incidence of CV 338 events in cohorts with established CV diseases4-6. However, exclusion of patients with severe 339 daytime sleepiness and low adherence to CPAP therapy were substantial limitations and in 340 contrast, analyses from large real-world studies revealed a significant association of CPAP 341 use with lower all-cause mortality28-30. Furthermore, several studies and meta-analyses have 342 demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement with CPAP of various cardiovascular risk 343 factors including blood pressure or endothelial function8,9. Importantly, the presence of OSA 344 appears to be particularly detrimental in subjects without prior CV disease31. This ties in with 345\nan extensive line of evidence showing that intermittent hypoxia, the hallmark feature of 346 obstructive sleep apnea and key pathophysiological factor in CV disease processes in OSA, is 347 a potent triggering factor of inflammatory processes which are also characteristic of early 348 stages of atherosclerosis32,33. We and others have previously shown that OSA subjects 349 without CV disease exhibit a low-grade systemic pro-inflammatory milieu which is 350 attenuated by effective CPAP therapy11,34. The CPAP effect on aortic inflammation as 351 evaluated by FDG PET-CT, on LD NCP coronary artery plaque burden and on endothelial 352 function found in our present report support these findings and highlight the potential 353 opportunity for early intervention to mitigate CV risk in OSA. Notably, compliance with 354 CPAP was excellent in our cohort and adequate adherence commonly referred to as usage of 355 4 or more hours per night has emerged as being critical to achieve CV benefit35. Our small 356 numbers do not allow further insight into the dose-effect relationship between CPAP and CV 357 processes, but this topic will remain a research priority. 358 Although adherence and tolerability with Liraglutide were also satisfactory and 359 significant weight loss was achieved accompanied by improvement in triglyceride levels and 360 blood pressure, this did not translate into improvement of early atherosclerotic disease in our 361 study. The general health benefits of weight loss are unquestionable and have also been 362 demonstrated in OSA populations36-38. However, most studies have focused on improvement 363 in OSA parameters or metabolic outcomes. In a landmark study, Chirinos and co-workers 364 reported improvement in various parameters with weight loss including insulin sensitivity 365 and blood pressure in obese subjects with obesity and moderate to severe OSA in contrast to 366 CPAP therapy. Of note, there appeared to be an incremental benefit with both treatments 367 combined17. However, that study employed intensive weight loss coaching and dietary 368 restriction that are not feasible in real world populations. GLP-1 in combination with lifestyle 369 change is superior in achieving weight loss, compared to lifestyle change alone, and is now 370\nwidely used as an obesity treatment39. The SCALE sleep apnea trial evaluated this 371 pharmacological intervention versus placebo over 32 weeks in moderate to severe OSA 372 subjects who were unwilling or unable to use CPAP and reported a small but statistically 373 significant improvement in AHI, systolic blood pressure and HbA1c40. Our study is the first 374 to compare the impact of GLP-1 induced weight loss with CPAP therapy (alone or in 375 combination) and also the first to address the potential impact on early CV disease processes. 376 Weight loss achieved in the Liraglutide group was comparable to that seen in the SCALE 377 sleep apnea trial but was less in the combination group. This was likely due to difficulties for 378 some subjects in managing both treatments concomitantly, also reflected in the lower CPAP 379 compliance in comparison to those on CPAP alone. We used a very pragmatic, easily 380 applicable approach for standard clinical populations. We did not provide specific dietary or 381 exercise advice to patients in the CPAP group reflecting our standard practice. However, as a 382 consequence we cannot rule out a potential added benefit on CV disease with combined 383 CPAP and Liraglutide. Furthermore, continuous weight loss beyond our 24-week timepoint 384 might potentially relate into more noticeable improvements but this remains hypothetical at 385 this stage. Nonetheless, our data support a direct contribution of OSA to the process of 386 atherosclerosis and the significant correlations of oximetry parameters with our CV outcomes 387 reinforces the pivotal role of intermittent hypoxia as triggering factor. The relationship 388 between OSA and CV disease was particularly strong in subjects not on statin therapy. Statin 389 medication is the cornerstone therapy to attenuate CV disease progression and their effects 390 are not solely mediated by their lipid-lowering properties but also through pleiotropic effects 391 reducing vascular inflammation and promoting atherosclerotic plaque stability41,42. Statin use 392 among OSA patients has been consistently reported to be low 43,44 and studies assessing the 393 benefits of statins in OSA populations have been conflicting. In a French multicenter double-394 blind RCT endothelial function remained unaffected although statins improved blood 395\npressure and lipid profile45. In contrast, a recent report demonstrated reduction of 396 complement-mediated pro-inflammatory effects with restoration of endothelial protection46. 397 Our study was not designed to assess this aspect but supports the need for further research 398 into the role of statins in OSA-mediated CV disease either in combination with CPAP or as 399 primary preventive strategy alone. 400 A particular strength of our study is the evaluation of early and potentially reversible 401 atherosclerotic disease using state-of-the art imaging techniques. This is the first time that 402 18F-FDG PET-CT has been used in an OSA population. Vascular inflammation on 18F-FDG 403 PET-CT has been shown to predict the formation of future atherosclerotic plaques and 404 moreover, to correlate with subsequent vascular events13,47. Importantly, the reduction in 405 aortic inflammation by CPAP therapy in our study is at least of the magnitude seen with 406 statin therapy48 and thus, is likely of clinical relevance. In contrast to PET-CT assessment of 407 atherosclerosis, CCTA is well established in routine clinical practice and increased calcified 408 coronary artery plaque burden on CT calcium scoring is predicative of future coronary 409 events49,50. We reported previously an increased plaque burden in otherwise healthy OSA 410 subjects versus matched controls51 and data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 411 (MESA) cohort demonstrated an independent association between OSA severity and 412 progression of calcified coronary artery plaques over an 8-year period52. However, calcified 413 plaques represent a more stable form of atherosclerosis less likely to rupture and cause 414 myocardial infarction. Histologically, a lipid-rich necrotic core is an important characteristic 415 associated with plaque rupture53 and those can be accurately identified on CCTA as low-416 attenuation noncalcified plaque and accurately quantified through semi-automatic analysis. 417 Accordingly, low-attenuation plaque has been demonstrated to be a better predictor of 418 myocardial infarction than other traditionally used markers including coronary artery 419 stenosis54. In a large cross-sectional study of 692 subjects, OSA severity correlated strongly 420\nwith CP and NCP burden and subjects with moderate to severe OSA were more likely to 421 contain a LD NCP component than controls55. Unfortunately, we were not able to repeat 422 CCTA\u2019s in all our subjects following their interventions due to the ethical restrictions 423 regarding radiation exposure but nonetheless with our small numbers, there was a noticeable 424 trend in reduction with CPAP in LD NCP volume only, supporting the potential importance 425 of effective OSA treatment on the early pro-inflammatory phase of atherosclerosis. 426 These data have been derived from a proof-of concept study and thus, have inherent 427 limitations including low numbers, an open-label design and a focus on a selected, well-428 characterized population. In addition, in line with other RCT\u2019s in the field, we excluded 429 subjects with severe daytime sleepiness who may benefit most from CPAP. 430 Despite these limitations, our data provide sufficient evidence to mandate the design 431 and delivery of larger-scale studies to define the role of CPAP in attenuating CV risk as 432 primary prevention in subjects with OSA. There is also a clear need to integrate novel 433 radiological surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease with clinical endpoints.56 434\nAcknowledgement 435\nWe are grateful to all the patients and their families for participating in this study and 436 to all staff members of the Sleep Laboratory at St. Vincent\u2019s University Hospital for their 437 help and support. 438\nSources of Funding 439\nThis study was funded by the Health Research Board of Ireland (SR).
