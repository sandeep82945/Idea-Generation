 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of other process parameters like concentration of CMCS, molecular weight of CMCS, degree of substitution of CMCS, etc. on the properties of nanoparticles like size, drug loading, drug release. This can help optimize the nanoparticle preparation process further. 

2. Study the antibacterial activity of the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles loaded SCMC films against other bacteria like E. coli, P. aeruginosa etc. This can expand the applicability of the delivery system.

3. Evaluate the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of the nanoparticle delivery system using in vitro cell culture models. This is important to establish safety before further studies. 

4. Conduct in vivo studies by applying the nanoparticle loaded films on animal models to evaluate efficacy for treating bacterial skin infections. This can demonstrate translational potential. 

5. Explore use of other small molecule antibiotics or combination of antibiotics in the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles. This can expand the capability of the delivery system for treating bacterial infections.
