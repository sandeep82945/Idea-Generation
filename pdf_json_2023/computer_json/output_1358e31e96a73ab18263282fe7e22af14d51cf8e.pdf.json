            "text": "This paper is a first step into relating two strands of research modal logic: the \u00b5-calculus and constructive modal logics. We define a constructive version of the \u00b5-calculus by adding fixed-point operators to constructive modal logic. We base our semantics on the bi-relational Kripke semantics of Wijesekera [Wij90] (but we allow fallible worlds in our models). We define game semantics for the constructive \u00b5-calculus and prove its equivalence to the bi-relational Kripke semantics.\nThe main advantage of game semantics for the \u00b5-calculus is that they allow for easier comprehension of the \u00b5-formulas, which are famously hard to understand. In an evaluation game for the classical \u00b5-calculus, the players Verifier and Refuter discuss whether a formula holds at a given world of a Kripke model. In an evaluation game for the constructive \u00b5-calculus, we still have two players, but they alternate between the roles of Verifier and Refuter depending on their choices. This happens because every formulas can be put in negative normal form over classical semantics, which allows for these simpler evaluation games. Therefore we need a more delicate argument to prove the equivalence of the semantics in the constructive case compared to the classical case. Our proof is based on the proof of the correctness of game semantics for the classical \u00b5-calculus by Ong [Ong15].\nFor applications, we study the logic \u00b5CS5, a constructive variation of S5 with the addition of fixed-points. We first use the game semantics to show that the (constructive) \u00b5-calculus collapses to (constructive) modal logic over CS5 frames. That is, every formula with fixed-point operators is equivalent to a formula without fixed-point operators over CS5 frames. The CS5 frames are a subclass of the bi-relational CS4 frames defined in Alechina et al. [Ale+01]; we require that the modal accessibility relation of the CS5 frames is an equivalence relation. Our proof is a generalization of Alberucci and Facchini\u2019s proof of the collapse of the (classical) \u00b5-calculus to (classical) modal logic over S5 frames.\nNote that this collapse does not happen in general. Over arbitrary frames, we have a strict alternation hierarchy, with formulas which are not equivalent to any other formula with less fixed-point alternation.\nWe use the \u00b5-calculus\u2019 collapse to modal logic over CS5 frames to prove the completeness of \u00b5CS5 over CS5 frames. The modal logic \u00b5CS5 is obtained by adding fixed-point axioms and rules to the modal logic CS5. As far as the author is aware, this is the first completeness proof for a system over the constructive \u00b5-calculus. We also describe how to use our methods to prove the completeness of \u00b5IS5 and \u00b5GS5 over IS5 and GS5 frames, respectively. The logic \u00b5IS5 is obtained by adding fixed-point operators to IS5, an intuitionistic variant of S5. IS5 is also known as MIPQ. An IS5 frame is a CS5 frame with no fallible worlds. The completeness of IS5 over IS5 frames is already known [Ono77; Fis78] The logic \u00b5GS5 is obtained by adding fixed-point operators to GS5, a variation of S5 over real-valued semantics.\nWe now briefly review the related literature on the \u00b5-calculus and constructive modal logics. The \u00b5-calculus was defined by Kozen [Koz83], who also defined a related proof system \u00b5K. The completeness of \u00b5K was first proved by Walukiewicz [Wal95]. See [Len10; BW18] for surveys on the \u00b5-calculus.\nThe \u00b5-calculus\u2019 alternation hierarchy classifies the \u00b5-formulas by how many alternating least and greatest fixed-point operators they contain. The strictness of the hierarchy was open for many years until it was proved by Bradfield [Bra98b]. Bradfield later gave a simplified proof of the alternation hierarchy\u2019s strictness using evaluation games [Bra98a]. The strictness may not hold over restricted classes of frames. For example, Alberucci and Facchini [AF09] proved that the alternation hierarchy collapses to its alternation-free fragment over transitive frames, and to modal logic over equivalence relations. See Chapter 2 of [Pac23] for a survey on the alternation hierarchy.\nOn a constructive modal logic, the duality of the modalities and \u2666 is lost. These logics have been studied for a long time; some of the first texts on the topic are Fitch [Fit48] and Prawitz [Pra06]. We base our Kripke models over Wijesekera [Wij90], who defined a constructive modal logic CK and proved its completeness over CK frames. The difference between Wijesekera\u2019s CK frames and our bi-relational frames is that we allow fallible worlds. On fallible worlds, the false proposition \u22a5 holds. The logic CK was also studied by Acclavio et al. [ACS21]; they define and prove the correctness of a validity game for CK. See [Gie22; Sim94] for surveys on constructive modal logic.\nThe modal logic CS5 studied in this paper is closely related to the modal logic MIPQ, an intuitionistic variant of S5. MIPQ is also known as IS5, and was first studied by Prawitz [Pra06]. The completeness of IS5 over IS5 frames was proved by Ono [Ono77] and Fischer Servi [Fis78]. The logic GS5 was studied by Caicedo et al. [Cai+13], who proved its completeness over real-valued S5 models.\nOutline In Section 2, we define the syntax and bi-relational Kripke semantics for the constructive \u00b5-calculus. We also define the modal logics CS5 and \u00b5CS5, and the class of CS5 frames. In Section 3, we define the game semantics for the constructive \u00b5-calculus and prove its equivalence to Kripke semantics. In Section 4, we prove the constructive \u00b5-calculus\u2019 collapse to modal logic over CS5 frames. In Section 5, we prove the completeness of \u00b5CS5 over CS5 frames.\nWe also describe how to prove completeness results for \u00b5IS5 and \u00b5GS5.\nAcknowledgements I would like to thank David Ferna\u0301ndez-Duque, Iris van der Giessen, and Konstantinos Papafilippou for the discussions we had about constructive modal logics and the \u00b5-calculus.

            "text": "Syntax The language of the \u00b5-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators \u00b5 and \u03bd to the language of modal logic. When defining the fixed-point formulas \u00b5X.\u03d5 and \u03bdX.\u03d5, we will require that the variable symbol X is positive in \u03d5; we will need to do so in order to have well-behaved semantics. We will describe when a variable is positive after we describe a grammar generating the \u00b5-formulas.\nFix a set Prop of proposition symbols and a set Var of variable symbols. The constructive \u00b5-formulas are defined by the following grammar:\n\u03d5 := P | X | \u22a5 | \u22a4 | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2228 \u03d5 | \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 | \u03d5 | \u2666\u03d5 | \u00b5X.\u03d5 | \u03bdX.\u03d5,\nwhere P is a proposition symbol, X is a variable symbol. The fixed-point formulas \u00b5X.\u03d5 and \u03bdX.\u03d5 are defined iff X is positive in \u03d5. Denote the set of subformulas of \u03d5 by Sub(\u03d5). We we use \u03b7 to denote either \u00b5 or \u00b5, and \u25b3 to denote or \u2666.\nWe classify X as positive or negative in a given formula by structural induction:\n\u2022 X is positive and negative in P ;\n\u2022 X is positive in X ;\n\u2022 if Y 6= X , X is positive and negative in Y ;\n\u2022 if X is positive (negative) in \u03d5, then X is negative (positive) in \u03d5;\n\u2022 if X is positive (negative) in \u03d5 and \u03c8, then X is positive (negative) in \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8, \u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8, and \u25b3\u03d5;\n\u2022 if X is negative (positive) in \u03d5 and positive (negative) in \u03c8, then X is negative (positive) in \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8;\n\u2022 X is positive and negative in \u03b7X.\u03d5.\nWhile burdensome, we need to consider the positiveness and negativeness of variables to guarantee that the semantics for fixed-points formulas are welldefined. This contrasts with the classical \u00b5-calculus, where it is common to suppose every formula is in negative normal form, and so we can set up the grammar in a way only positive variables occur. We cannot do the same on constructive semantics: For example, \u00ac\u2666\u00ac\u03d5 is not equivalent to \u03d5 over constructive semantics.\nAn occurrence of a variable X in a formula \u03d5 is bound iff it in the scope of a fixed-point operator \u03b7X . An occurrence of X is free iff it is not bound. A formula \u03d5 is closed iff it has no free variables. An occurrence of X in \u03d5 is guarded iff it is in the scope of some modality \u25b3. A formula \u03d5 is guarded iff, for all \u03b7X.\u03c8 \u2208 Sub(\u03d5), X is guarded in \u03c8. A formula \u03d5 is well-bounded iff, for all variables X occurring bounded in \u03d5, X occurs only once and there is only one fixed-point operator \u03b7X in \u03d5. A formula is well-named iff it is guarded and well-bounded. Every formula is equivalent to a well-named formula. If \u03d5 is a well-named formula and \u03b7X.\u03c8 \u2208 Sub(\u03c8), denote by \u03c8X the formula \u03c8 which is bound by the fixed-point operator \u03b7X .\nSemantics We consider bi-relational Kripke framesF = \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2291\u3009where: W is the set of possible worlds; W\u22a5 \u2286 W is the set of fallible worlds; is a reflexive and transitive relation over W ; and \u2291 is a relation over W . We call the intuitionistic relation and \u2291 the modal relation.\nA bi-relational Kripke model is a tuple \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2291, V \u3009 where \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2291\u3009 is a bi-relational frame, V : Prop \u2192 P(W ) is a valuation function. We require that, if wRv and w \u2208 V (P ), then v \u2208 V (P ).\nFix a Kripke model M = \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2291, V \u3009. Given a \u00b5-formula \u03d5, define the operator \u0393\u03d5(X)(A) := \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016\nM . Define the valuation of the \u00b5-formulas over M by induction on the structure of the formulas:\n\u2022 \u2016P\u2016M = V (P );\n\u2022 \u2016\u22a5\u2016M = \u2205;\n\u2022 \u2016\u22a4\u2016M =W ;\n\u2022 \u2016\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8\u2016M = \u2016\u03c8\u2016M \u2229 \u2016\u03c8\u2016M ;\n\u2022 \u2016\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8\u2016M = \u2016\u03c8\u2016M \u222a \u2016\u03c8\u2016M ; and\n\u2022 \u2016\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8\u2016M = {w | \u2200v.if w v then v \u2208 \u2016\u03d5\u2016M implies v \u2208 \u2016\u03c8\u2016M}.\n\u2022 \u2016\u00ac\u03d5\u2016M = {w | \u2200v w.v 6|= \u03d5};\n\u2022 \u2016 \u03d5\u2016M = {w | \u2200v w\u2200u \u2292 v.u \u2208 \u2016\u03d5\u2016M};\n\u2022 \u2016\u2666\u03d5\u2016M = {w | \u2200v w\u2203u \u2292 v.u \u2208 \u2016\u03d5\u2016M};\n\u2022 \u2016\u00b5X.\u03d5(X)\u2016M is the least fixed-point of the operator \u0393\u03d5(X); and\n\u2022 \u2016\u03bdX.\u03d5(X)\u2016M is the greatest fixed-point of the operator \u0393\u03d5(X);\nWe also write M,w |= \u03d5 when w \u2208 \u2016\u03d5\u2016M . We omit the reference to M when it is clear from the context and write w \u2208 \u2016\u03d5\u2016 and w |= \u03d5.\nWe will need to consider models with augmented valuations when proving the correctness of game semantics. When augmenting M , we treat some variable symbol X as a proposition symbol and assign a value to it. Formally, let M = \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2291, V \u3009 be a Kripke model, A \u2286W and X be a variable symbol; the augmented Kripke model M [X 7\u2192 A] is obtained by setting V (X) := A. Given any \u00b5-formula \u03d5, we also define \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016M := \u2016\u03d5(X)\u2016M [X 7\u2192A].\nWe will also need to consider the approximants \u03b7\u03b1X.\u03d5 of fixed-point formulas \u03b7X.\u03d5, for all ordinal \u03b1. Fix a Kripke modelM and a formula \u03d5(X) where X is positive. We define\n\u2022 \u2016\u00b5X0.\u03d5\u2016M = \u2205, \u2016\u03bdX0.\u03d5\u2016M =W ;\n\u2022 \u2016\u00b5X\u03b1+1.\u03d5\u2016M = \u2016\u03d5(\u2016\u00b5X\u03b1.\u03d5\u2016M )\u2016, \u2016\u03bdX\u03b1+1.\u03d5\u2016M = \u2016\u03d5(\u2016\u03bdX\u03b1.\u03d5\u2016M )\u2016; and\n\u2022 \u2016\u00b5X\u03bb.\u03d5\u2016M = \u22c3 \u03b1<\u03bb \u2016\u00b5X \u03b1.\u03d5\u2016M , \u2016\u03bdX\u03bb.\u03d5\u2016M = \u22c2 \u03b1<\u03bb \u2016\u03bdX \u03b1.\u03d5\u2016M .\nThe Knaster\u2013Tarski Theorem [AN01] states that every monotone operator has least and greatest fixed-points. In the proposition below, we prove that if X is positive in \u0393\u03d5(X), then \u0393\u03d5(X) is monotone; therefore the valuation of the fixed-point formulas \u00b5X.\u03d5 and \u03bdX.\u03d5 are well-defined. Indeed, for all model M and \u00b5-formula \u03d5(X) with X positive there are ordinal \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that \u2016\u00b5X.\u03d5\u2016M = \u2016\u00b5\u03b1X\u03bb.\u03d5\u2016M and \u2016\u03bdX.\u03d5\u2016M = \u2016\u03bd\u03b1X\u03b2.\u03d5\u2016M .\nProposition 1. Fix a bi-relational model M = \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2291, V \u3009 and sets of worlds A \u2286 B \u2286W . If X is positive in \u03d5, then \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016M \u2286 \u2016\u03d5(B)\u2016M . Symmetrically, if X is negative in \u03d5, then \u2016\u03d5(B)\u2016M \u2286 \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016M .\nProof. Fix a model M and set A \u2286 W . We prove that if X is positive in \u03d5 then \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016M \u2286 \u2016\u03d5(B)\u2016M ; the case for negative X is similar.\nThe proof is by structural induction on the \u00b5-formulas. The cases of formulas of the form P , X , Y , \u03d5\u2227\u03c8, and \u03d5\u2228\u03c8 follow by direct calculations. The case for formulas of the form \u03b7X.\u03d5 is trivial, as X is not free in \u03b7X.\u03d5.\nWe now prove the proposition for formulas of the form \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8. Suppose X is positive in \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8, then X is positive in \u03c8 and negative in \u03d5. Therefore:\nw \u2208 \u2016(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)(A)\u2016M \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200v w.v \u2208 \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016M implies v \u2208 \u2016\u03c8(A)\u2016M\n=\u21d2 \u2200v w.v \u2208 \u2016\u03d5(B)\u2016M implies v \u2208 \u2016\u03c8(B)\u2016M\n\u21d0\u21d2 w \u2208 \u2016(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)(B)\u2016M .\nThe case for formulas of the form \u00ac\u03d5 is similar. Finally, we prove the proposition for formulas of the form \u03d5. Suppose X is positive in \u03d5, then X is positive in \u03d5. Therefore:\nw \u2208 \u2016 \u03d5(A)\u2016M \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200v w\u2200u \u2291 v.u \u2208 \u2016\u03d5(A)\u2016M\n=\u21d2 \u2200v w\u2200u \u2291 v.u \u2208 \u2016\u03d5(B)\u2016M\n\u21d0\u21d2 w \u2208 \u2016 \u03d5(B)\u2016M .\nThe proof for formulas of the form \u2666\u03d5 is similar.\n2.2 CS5 and \u00b5CS5\nModal axioms Our basic modal logic is CS5. The axioms of CS5 are:\n\u2022 all intuitionistic tautologies;\n\u2022 K := (\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 ( \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u2666\u03d5\u2192 \u2666\u03c8);\n\u2022 T := \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5\u2192 \u2666\u03d5;\n\u2022 4 := \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 \u2227 \u2666\u2666\u03d5\u2192 \u2666\u03d5; and\n\u2022 5 := \u2666\u03d5\u2192 \u2666\u03d5 \u2227 \u2666 \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5.\nCS5 is closed under necessitation and modus ponens:\n(Nec) \u03d5\n\u03d5 and (MP)\n\u03d5 \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8\n\u03c8 .\nA CS5 frame is a bi-relational Kripke frame F = \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2261\u3009 where \u2261 is an equivalence relation over W . We denote the modal relation by \u2261 instead of \u2291 to emphasize that it is an equivalence relation. We also require that CS5 frames are backward confluent: w \u2261 v v\u2032 implies there is w\u2032 such that w w\u2032 \u2261 v\u2032. A CS5 model is a bi-relational model over a CS5 frame.\nFixed-point axioms \u00b5CS5 is the logic obtained by adding to CS5 the fixedpoint axioms:\n\u2022 \u03bdFP := \u03bdX.\u03d5\u2192 \u03d5(\u03bdX.\u03d5); and\n\u2022 \u00b5FP := \u03d5(\u00b5X.\u03d5) \u2192 \u00b5X.\u03d5;\nand taking the closure under Nec, MP and the induction rules:\n(\u03bdInd) \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5(\u03c8)\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bdX.\u03d5 and (\u00b5Ind)\n\u03d5(\u03c8) \u2192 \u03c8 \u00b5X.\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8 .\nNote that the two fixed-point axioms and the two induction rules are necessary as \u03bd and \u00b5 cannot be defined in terms of each other over constructive semantics. While over classical semantics one has \u03bdX.\u03d5 \u2261 \u00ac\u00b5X.\u00ac\u03d5(\u00acX); we do not have the same here: if \u03d5 := P , then \u03bdX.\u03d5 \u2261 P and \u00ac\u00b5X.\u00ac\u03d5(\u00acX) \u2261 \u00ac\u00acP are not equivalent formulas."

The evaluation game G(M,w |= \u03d5) has two players: I and II. The two players will alternate the roles of Verifier and Refuter (abbreviated to V and R, respectively). The main positions are of the form \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 where v \u2208 W and \u03c8 \u2208 Sub(\u03d5). We also have auxiliary positions of the form \u3008\u3008v\u3009, \u03c8\u3009, \u3008[v], \u03c8\u3009, and \u3008v, \u03b8?\u03b8\u2032\u3009 where v \u2208 W , \u25b3\u03c8, \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 Sub(\u03d5). Each position is owned by one of I and II. At a position \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009, the player in the role of V tries to prove that v |= \u03c8 and the player in the role of R tries to prove that v 6|= \u03c8. The game begin at the position \u3008w,\u03d5\u3009, with I in the role of V and II in the role of R. The possible plays are described in Table 1. We explain below the plays available in evaluation game.\nAt the position \u3008v, P \u3009 there is no available move and the game ends; V wins iff v |= P , otherwise R wins. If v \u2208 W\u22a5 and \u03c8 \u2208 Sub(\u03d5), then V wins automatically at \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009, overruling the other possibilities. At the position \u3008v, \u03c8 \u2228 \u03b8\u3009, V chooses one of \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 and \u3008v, \u03b8\u3009. They do so as only one of \u03c8 and \u03b8 need to hold at v for \u03c8 \u2228 \u03b8 to hold at v. Similarly, at \u3008v, \u03c8 \u2227 \u03b8\u3009, R chooses one of \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 and \u3008v, \u03b8\u3009.\nLet \u03b7X.\u03c8X \u2208 Sub(\u03d5); at \u3008v, \u03b7X.\u03c8X\u3009 and \u3008v,X\u3009, the players move to \u3008v, \u03c8X\u3009. When moving from \u3008v,X\u3009 to \u3008v, \u03c8X\u3009, we say that the fixed-point \u03b7X was regenerated. The ownership of these positions does not matter for the game, but we assign it to the player who does not want \u03b7X to be regenerated infinitely often.\nOn a position of the form \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009, R chooses v\u2032 such that v v\u2032, and then move the position \u3008[v\u2032], \u03c8\u3009; then, at \u3008[v], \u03c8\u3009, R chooses v\u2032\u2032 such that v\u2032 \u2291 v\u2032\u2032 and moves to \u3008v\u2032\u2032, \u03c8\u3009. Similarly, on a position of the form \u3008v,\u2666\u03c8\u3009, R chooses v\u2032 such that v v\u2032, and then move the position \u3008\u3008v\u2032\u3009, \u03c8\u3009; then, at \u3008\u3008v\u2032\u3009, \u03c8\u3009, V chooses v\u2032\u2032 such that v\u2032 \u2291 v\u2032\u2032 and moves to \u3008v\u2032\u2032, \u03c8\u3009. At a position of the form \u3008v,\u00ac\u03c8\u3009, R chooses v\u2032 v and challenges V to show that M, v\u2032 6|= \u03d5; that is, R modes to \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8\u3009 and the players exchange roles. Positions of the form \u3008v, \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b8\u3009 is similar. In this case, R chooses v\u2032 v and V chooses whether to show that M, v\u2032 6|= \u03c8 or M, v\u2032 |= \u03b8; in case V chooses \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8\u3009, the players exchange roles. That is, R chooses v\u2032 v and moves to \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8?\u03b8\u3009, and then V chooses one of \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8\u3009 and \u3008v\u2032, \u03b8\u3009; in case V chooses \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8\u3009, the players exchange roles.\nNote that I and II always play the same role on vertices using the same formulas. That is, if I plays the role of V at \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 then they also play the role of V at \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8\u3009 for all v\u2032 \u2208 W . The same holds for the other combinations of players and roles. We can guarantee this by the positivity requirement on the fixed-point formulas. In particular, between positions \u3008v,X\u3009 and \u3008v\u2032, X\u3009, the players must switch roles an even number of times.\nLet \u03b7X.\u03c8X be the outermost infinitely often regenerated formula, the player on role of V wins iff \u03b7 is \u03bd. Formally, let \u03c1 be an infinite play \u3008w0, \u03d50\u3009, \u3008w1, \u03d51\u3009, . . . with \u3008w0, \u03d50\u3009 = \u3008w,\u03d5\u3009. Let \u03b70X0, . . . , \u03b7nXn be the fixed-point operators infinitely often regenerated in \u03c1. Let i be such that \u03b7iXi.\u03c8i is not a subformula of any other \u03b7jXj.\u03c8j . The player with the role of V on \u3008w, \u03b7iXi.\u03c8i\u3009 wins \u03c1 iff \u03b7i is \u03bd; similarly, R wins \u03c1 iff \u03b7i is \u00b5. A player wins the game G(M,w |= \u03d5) iff they have a win strategy. Since the evaluation games are Borel Gale\u2013Stewart games, one of the players must have a winning strategy."

Then\nI wins G(M,w |= \u03d5) iff M,w |= \u03d5, and\nII wins G(M,w |= \u03d5) iff M,w 6|= \u03d5.\nProof. Suppose w |= \u03d5. We assign to each main position \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 of the game an ordinal signature sigI\u3008v, \u03c8\u3009. We show I is always able to control the truth of the positions in the evaluation game G(M,w |= \u03d5) and move in a way that the signature is eventually non-increasing. After that, we show how to define a winning strategy for II if M,w 6|= \u03d5. This will conclude the proof.\nFixed-point subformulas Enumerate the fixed-point subformulas of \u03d5 in nonincreasing size:\n\u03b71Z1.\u03c81, \u03b72Z2.\u03c82, . . . , \u03b7nZn.\u03c8n.\nThat is, if i < j then \u03b7iZi.\u03c8i 6\u2208 Sub(\u03b7jZj .\u03c8j); and if \u03b7iZi.\u03c8i \u2208 Sub(\u03b7jZj .\u03c8j) then j \u2264 i.

Denote by r(k) the kth component of r. Write r =k r\n\u2032 iff the first k components of r are identical. Order the signatures by the lexicographical order: r < r\u2032 iff there is k \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} such that r =k r\u2032 and r(k) < r\u2032(k). The lexicographical order is a well-ordering of the signatures.\nAugmented models We want to evaluate subformulas of \u03d5where some Z1, . . . , Zn occur free, so we augment M with the correct valuations of these variables\nM0 := V ;\nMi+1 :=Mi[Zi+1 7\u2192 \u2016\u03b7iZi.\u03c8i\u2016 Mi ].\nBy the choice of our enumeration, \u03b7iZi.\u03c8i does not contain free occurrences of Zi+1, . . . , Zn, and so Mi is well-defined.\nGiven a signature r, we define augmented models M r0 , . . . ,M r n by\nM r0 := V ;\nM ri+1 :=\n{ Mi[Zi+1 7\u2192 \u2016\u03b7\u2032jY rj j .\u03c7j\u2016 Mri ], if Zi+1 = Yj ; Mi[Zi+1 7\u2192 \u2016\u03b7iZi.\u03c8i\u2016Mi ], if there is no j such that Zi+1 = Yj .\nOn M rn, the variables Yj owned by I are assigned their r(j)th approximant \u2016\u03b7 r(j) j Yj .\u03c7j\u2016, and variables owned by II receive their correct value. If Mn, v |= \u03c8, we call \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 a true position; if Mn, v 6|= \u03c8, we call \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 a false position. Now, if \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 a true position, then there is a least signature r such that M rn, v |= \u03c8. Similarly, if \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 a false position, then there is a least signature r such that M rn, v 6|= \u03c8. Denote these signatures by sig I\u3008t, \u03c8\u3009.\nA strategy for I Remember that we are under the assumption that M,w |= \u03d5. Note that, I starts G(M,w |= \u03d5) on the role of V by the definition of the evaluation game. We will define a strategy for I guarantee that when the players are at \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009, v |= \u03c8 if I is in the role of V, and v 6|= \u03c8 if I is in the role of R. Furthermore, most of I\u2019s moves never increase the signature and II cannot move in ways the signature is increasing. The only time the signature may increase is when regenerating some Yj , but in this case the first j \u2212 1 positions of the signature are not modified.\nWe define I\u2019s strategy as follows:\n\u2022 Suppose the game is at the position \u3008v, \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82\u3009. If I is V and \u3008v, \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82\u3009\nis a true position; then I moves to \u3008v, \u03c8i\u3009 such that M sigI\u3008v,\u03c81\u2228\u03c82\u3009 n , v |= \u03c8i, with i \u2208 {1, 2}. By the definition of the signatures, sigI\u3008v, \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82\u3009 = sigI\u3008v, \u03c8i\u3009. If I is R and \u3008v, \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82\u3009 is a false position; thenM sigI\u3008v,\u03c81\u2228\u03c82\u3009 n , v 6|= \u03c8i and sig I\u3008v, \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82\u3009 \u2265 sig\nI\u3008v, \u03c8i\u3009 for all i \u2208 {1, 2}. So whichever way II moves, the next position is false and the signature is non-increasing.\n\u2022 Suppose the game is at the position \u3008v, \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82\u3009. If I is V and \u3008v, \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82\u3009 is\na true position; thenM sigI\u3008v,\u03c81\u2227\u03c82\u3009 n , v |= \u03c8i and sig I\u3008v, \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82\u3009 \u2265 sig I\u3008v, \u03c8i\u3009 for all i \u2208 {1, 2}.

I has the role of V at a true position of the form \u3008v, P \u3009. Similarly, I has the role of V at true positions \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 where v \u2208 W\u22a5. Also, I has the role of R at a false positions of the form \u3008v, P \u3009.\nNow, consider an infinite play \u3008w0, \u03d50\u3009, \u3008w1, \u03d51\u3009, . . . , let i be the smallest number in {1, . . . , n} such that \u03b7iZi is an infinitely often regenerated fixedpoint operator. Suppose there is j \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} such that Zi = Yj for a contradiction. Let k1, k2, . . . be the positions where Yj occur; that is, all the positions \u3008wkl , \u03c8\u3009 = \u3008wkl , Yj\u3009. Without loss of generality, we suppose that for all i\n\u2032 < i no Zi\u2032 is regenerated after the k1th position of the play. The move from \u3008wki , Yj\u3009 to \u3008wki+1, \u03c7j\u3009 causes a strict decrease in the signature. The other moves between ki + 1 and ki+1 cannot cancel this decrease, since either the signature does not change or one of the first i positions of the signature is reduced. Therefore the sequence of signatures\nsigI\u3008wk1 , Yj\u3009, sig I\u3008wk2 , Yj\u3009, sig I\u3008wk2 , Yj\u3009, . . .\nis strictly decreasing. This is a contradiction, as the signatures are well-ordered. Therefore there is no j such that Zi = Yj , and so I wins the play.\nA strategy for II from w 6|= \u03c8 If we suppose M,w 6|= \u03d5, we can define a winning strategy for II similar to the strategy for I defined above. The main difference is that we need to consider II-signatures, denoting approximants for II\u2019s variables. We leave the details to the reader.\n4 The collapse to modal logic over CS5 frames"

First note that ;\u2261 is a transitive relation. To see that, suppose w w\u2032 \u2261 v v\u2032 \u2261 u. By backward confluence, there is u\u2032 such that w\u2032 u\u2032 \u2261 v\u2032.

That is, when if players have gone through a position \u3008v, \u03c8\u3009 and later \u3008v\u2032, \u03c8\u2032\u3009, then v ;\u2261 v\u2032.

Let v, v\u2032 be such that w v \u2261 w\u2032 v\u2032. By downward confluence, there is u such that v u \u2261 v\u2032. By the transitivity of , w u.

We first show that \u2016\u03bdX.\u03d5\u2016 = \u2016\u03d52(\u22a4)\u2016. Let M = \u3008W,R, V \u3009 be a Kripke model whereR is an equivalence relation, and \u03bdX.\u03d5 is a well-named \u00b5-formula.

Then I has a winning strategy \u03c3 for the evaluation game G2 = G(M,w |= \u03d52(\u22a4)); and II has a winning strategy \u03c4 for the evaluation game G3 = G(M,w |= \u03d53(\u22a4)). We\nuse \u03c3 and \u03c4 to define strategies \u03c3\u2032 for I in G3 and \u03c4 \u2032 for II in G2. Remember that I starts on the role of V and II starts on the role of R.\nWe have the players use analogous strategies on both games. Suppose the players are in positions \u3008v, \u03c8(\u22a4)\u3009 in G2 and \u3008v, \u03c8(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u3009 in G3. Both positions have the same owner, in the same role. That is, if I\u2019s turn in some game, it is I\u2019s turn in both games; and the owner\u2019s role is V in some game, their role is V in both games. For example, suppose I is playing the role of R and the players are in positions \u3008v,\u00ac\u03c8(\u22a4)\u3009 and \u3008v,\u00ac\u03c8(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u3009 in G2 and G3.

After there moves, I is playing the role of V in both games.\nThe players continue both games following the strategies described above until they get to a position of the form \u3008v, P \u3009 in both games; or they get to positions of the form \u3008w\u2032\u2032,\u25b3\u03b2(\u22a4)\u3009 in G2 and \u3008w\u2032\u2032,\u25b3\u03b2(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u3009 in G3.\nCase 1. Suppose the players are in a position \u3008v, P \u3009 in both games. Without loss of generality, suppose I is V and II is R. As \u03c3 is winning for I in G2, v \u2208 \u2016P\u2016. As \u03c4 is winning for II in G3, v 6\u2208 \u2016P\u2016. And so we have a contradiction. A similar contradiction is reached if I is R and II is V.\nCase 2.

Without loss of generality, suppose I is V and II is R. As \u03c4 is a winning strategy for II in G3, w\u2032\u2032 6\u2208 \u2016\u25b3\u03b2(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u2016. Previously, the players must have been through some a position \u3008w\u2032,\u25b3\u03b2(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u3009 in G2. As \u03c3 is a winning strategy for I in G2, w\u2032 \u2208 \u2016\u25b3\u03b2(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u2016. Note that, from the definition of the game, the reflexivity of and \u2261, and the transitivity of ;\u2261, we have that w\u2032 ;\u2261 w\u2032\u2032. By Lemma 3, w\u2032\u2032 \u2208 \u2016\u25b3\u03b2(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u2016 since w\u2032 \u2208 \u2016\u25b3\u03b2(\u03d5(\u22a4))\u2016.

And so \u2016\u03bdX.\u03d5\u2016 = \u2016\u03d52(\u22a5)\u2016.\nIn classical semantics, we can prove \u2016\u00b5X.\u03d5\u2016 = \u2016\u03d52(\u22a5)\u2016 by a direct calculation. We cannot do the same in intuitionistic semantics as we cannot use the law of excluded middle. We have to prove it directly.\nFirst, \u2016\u03d52(\u22a5)\u2016 \u2286 \u2016\u00b5X.\u03d5\u2016 holds asX is positive in \u03d5(X). If we suppose there isw such thatw \u2208 \u2016\u00b5X.\u03d5\u2016 andw 6\u2208 \u2016\u03d52(\u22a5)\u2016, we get a similar contradiction.\nWe are now able to show the constructive \u00b5-calculus\u2019 collapse to modal logic over \u00b5CS5 frames.\nTheorem 5. Over models of CS5, every \u00b5-formula is equivalent to a modal formula.\nProof. We argue by structural induction on \u00b5-formulas. First, some of the easy cases. P is equivalent to a modal formula, as it is a modal formula. Suppose the \u00b5-formulas \u03d5 and \u03c8 are equivalent to modal formulas \u03d5\u2032 and \u03c8\u2032, then \u03d5\u2227\u03c8 is equivalent to \u03d5\u2032 \u2227 \u03c8\u2032, \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 is equivalent to \u03d5\u2032 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032, \u03d5 is equivalent to \u03d5\u2032, \u2666\u03d5 is equivalent to \u2666\u03d5\u2032.\nNow, the interesting cases. Similarly, \u03bdX.\u03d5 is equivalent to \u03bdX.\u03c8. By Lemma 4, \u03bdX.\u03c8 is equivalent to \u03c82(\u22a4), which is a modal formula. The same argument shows that \u00b5X.\u03c8 is equivalent to \u03c82(\u22a5).\nTherefore every \u00b5-formula is equivalent to a modal formula over models of IS5."

But u u \u2261 v\u2032 so v\u2032 |= \u03d5. Therefore w\u2032 |= \u03d5. We conclude w |= \u2666 \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5."

Mc is an CS5 model.\nProof. Since the subset relation \u2286 is a preorder, c is a reflexive and transitive relation over Wc. We need a little more work to show that \u2261c is an equivalence relation over Wc:\n\u2022 If \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393, then \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 by T and MP. So \u0393 \u2261c \u0393. By Nec, \u0393 \u2286 \u0393.\n\u2022 Let \u0393 \u2261c \u2206 \u2261c \u03a3. Then \u2206 \u2286 \u0393\u2666, \u0393 \u2286 \u2206, \u03a3 \u2286 \u2206\u2666, and \u2206 \u2286 \u03a3. Suppose \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 , then \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 and \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393, so \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 \u2286 \u2206. Thus \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3. Suppose \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3, then \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206\u2666 and \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 \u2286 \u0393\u2666. So \u2666\u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393. By 4 and Nec, \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 and so \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393\u2666.

Let \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393. By T and MP, \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393. By 5, \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393, so \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 \u2286 \u2206. Thus \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206\u2666.

Then \u2206 \u2286 \u0393\u2666, \u0393 \u2286 \u2206, and \u2206 \u2286 \u03a3. Let \u03a6 be the closure under the deduction rules of \u0393 \u222a {\u2666\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3}. Trivially, \u0393 \u2286 \u03a6 and so \u0393 c \u03a6. Now we want to show that \u03a6 \u2261c \u03a3. If \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3 then \u2666\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and so \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6\u2666. Suppose \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 . Then \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and so \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 by T and MP. If \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393, then \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 \u2286 \u03c3 and \u0393 \u2286 \u2206. If \u03d5 6\u2208 \u0393, then there are \u03d5i \u2208 \u0393 and \u03c8j \u2208 \u03a3 such that \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m,\u2666\u03c81, . . . , \u03d5n \u22a2 P . By Nec, each \u03d5i \u2208 \u0393 too. So \u03c8i \u2208 \u2206 \u2286 \u03a3. As \u03c8i \u2208 \u03a3, T implies that \u2666\u03c8i \u2208 \u03a3. As \u03a3 is closed under derivation rules, \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3. By T , \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3. Therefore \u03a6\u2666 \u2286 \u03a3. We conclude \u03a6 \u2261c \u03a3.\nAt last, we show that c preserves the truth of propositions. Suppose \u0393 c \u2206 and \u0393 \u2208 Vc(P ). So P \u2208 \u0393 \u2286 \u2206, and thus \u2206 \u2208 Vc(P ) too.\nThe Truth Lemma for modal formulas We first show the truth lemma for formulas without fixed-point operators. In particular, this implies that CS5 is complete over CS5 frames.\nLemma 9. For all formula \u03d5 without fixed-point operators,\nMc,\u0393 |= \u03d5 iff \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393.\nProof. The proof is by structural induction on modal formulas.\n\u2022 If \u03d5 = P , then the lemma holds by the definition of Mc.\n\u2022 If \u03d5 = \u22a5, then the lemma holds by the definition of the semantics and of W\u22a5c .\n\u2022 If \u03d5 = \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82, then\n\u0393 |= \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82 iff \u0393 |= \u03c81 and \u0393 |= \u03c82\niff \u03c81 \u2208 \u0393 and \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393\niff \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393.\n\u2022 If \u03d5 = \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82, then\n\u0393 |= \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82 iff \u0393 |= \u03c81 or \u0393 |= \u03c82\niff \u03c81 \u2208 \u0393 or \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393\niff \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393.\nHere we use that if \u03c81 \u2228 \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393 then \u03c81 \u2208 \u0393 or \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393, as \u0393 is a \u00b5CS5 theory.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 := \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82.\nFirst suppose that\u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393. Let \u2206 be a theory such that \u0393 c \u2206 |= \u03c81. By the induction hypothesis, \u03c81 \u2208 \u2206. As \u0393 c \u2206, \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 \u2208 \u2206. By MP, \u03c82 \u2208 \u2206. So \u0393 |= \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82.\nNow suppose that \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 6\u2208 \u0393. Take \u03a3 to be the closure of \u0393 \u222a {\u03c81} under the derivation rules. If \u03c82 \u2208 \u03a3, then there is \u03c7 \u2208 \u0393 such that (\u03c7 \u2227 \u03c81) \u2192 \u03c82 \u2208 \u00b5CS5. And so \u03c7 \u2192 (\u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82) \u2208 \u00b5CS5. As \u03c7 \u2208 \u0393, this means \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 \u2208 \u0393, a contradiction. Therefore \u03c82 6\u2208 \u03a3. By the induction hypothesis, \u03a3 |= \u03c81 and \u03a3 6|= \u03c82. As \u0393 c \u03a3, \u0393 6|= \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03c8. This case follows by the equivalence between \u00ac\u03c8 and \u03d5\u2192 \u22a5 over intuitionistic logic.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u03c8.\nFirst suppose that \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393. Let \u0393 c \u2206 \u2261c \u03a3. Then \u03c8 \u2208 \u2206 and \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3. By induction hypothesis, \u03a3 |= \u03c8.\nNow suppose that \u03c8 6\u2208 \u0393. Define \u03a3 := \u0393 . By definition, \u03c8 6\u2208 \u03a3. By the induction hypothesis, \u03a3 6|= \u03c8. Now we show that \u0393 \u2261c \u03a3. \u0393 \u2286 \u03a3 follows by definition. Let \u03b8 \u2208 \u03a3. Then \u03b8 \u2208 \u0393. By two applications of T , \u2666\u03b8 \u2208 \u0393. So \u03b8 \u2208 \u0393\u2666. So \u0393 \u2261c \u03a3. Therefore \u0393 c \u0393 \u2261c \u03a3 6|= \u03c8, and thus \u0393 6|= \u03c8.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u2666\u03c8.\nFirst suppose that \u2666\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393. Let \u2206 be a theory such that \u0393 c \u2206. Furthermore, suppose \u2206 is consistent. Let \u03a3 be the closure under derivation rules of \u2206 \u222a {\u03c8}. We want to show that \u2206 \u2261c \u03a3. \u2206 \u2286 \u03a3 holds by definition. Let \u03b8 \u2208 \u03a3, then \u03c7 \u2227 \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2208 \u00b5CS5 for some \u03c7 \u2208 \u2206 . Thus \u03c7 \u2192 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b8) \u2208 \u00b5CS5 and \u03c7 \u2192 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b8) \u2208 \u00b5CS5. So (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b8) \u2208 \u2206. By K , \u2666\u03c8 \u2192 \u2666\u03b8 \u2208 \u2206. So \u2666\u03b8 \u2208 \u2206.\nNow suppose that \u2666\u03c8 6\u2208 \u0393. \u0393 is consistent (otherwise all formula is in \u0393). Let \u2206 be such that \u0393 \u2261c \u2206 and \u03c8 \u2208 \u2206. By the definition of \u2261c, \u2206 \u2286 \u0393\u2666, so \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393\u2666. Therefore \u2666\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393, a contradiction. We conclude that for all \u2206, if \u0393 c \u0393 \u2261c \u2206, then \u03c8 6\u2208 \u2206. By the induction hypothesis, \u2206 6|= \u03c8. Therefore \u0393 6|= \u2666\u03c8.\nThe provable collapse We now show that any \u00b5-formula is provably equivalent to a modal formula in \u00b5CS5.\nWe first prove a technical lemma showing that monotonicity for formulas without fixed-point operators is provable. We will be able to lift this restriction after we prove completeness for \u00b5CS5.\nLemma 10. Let \u039b be a \u00b5CS5-theory. Suppose A \u2192 B \u2208 \u039b and \u03d5(X) is a formula without fixed-point operators. If X is positive in \u03d5(X), then \u03d5(A) \u2192 \u03d5(B) \u2208 \u039b. If X is negative in \u03d5(X), then \u03d5(B) \u2192 \u03d5(A) \u2208 \u039b.\nProof. We prove this lemma using structural induction. We prove only the cases where X is positive, as the cases where X is negative are similar.\n\u2022 For \u03d5 = P and \u03d5 = X , the result is immediate.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u2228 \u03b8. Then \u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b and \u03b8(A) \u2192 \u03b8(B) \u2208 \u039b. As [(\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B)) \u2227 (\u03b8(A) \u2192 \u03b8(B))] \u2192 (\u03d5(A) \u2192 \u03d5(B)) is a tautology, \u03d5(A) \u2192 \u03d5(B) \u2208 \u039b follows by MP.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u2227 \u03b8. Then \u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b and \u03b8(A) \u2192 \u03b8(B) \u2208 \u039b. As [(\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B)) \u2227 (\u03b8(A) \u2192 \u03b8(B))] \u2192 (\u03d5(A) \u2192 \u03d5(B)) is a tautology, \u03d5(A) \u2192 \u03d5(B) \u2208 \u039b follows by MP.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u03c8. Suppose \u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b. Then (\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B)) \u2208 \u039b by Nec. So \u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b by K and MP.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u2666\u03c8. Suppose \u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b. Then (\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u03c8(B)) \u2208 \u039b by Nec. So \u2666\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u2666\u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b by K and MP.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03c8. Then X is negative in \u03c8 and \u03c8(B) \u2192 \u03c8(A) \u2208 \u039b. Since (\u03c8(B) \u2192 \u03c8(A)) \u2192 (\u00ac\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8(B)) is a tautology, \u00ac\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8(B) \u2208 \u039b too.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b8. Then X is negative in \u03c8 and positive in \u03b8. So \u03c8(B) \u2192 \u03c8(A) \u2208 \u039b and \u03b8(A) \u2192 \u03b8(B) \u2208 \u039b. Since [(\u03c8(B) \u2192 \u03c8(A)) \u2227 (\u03b8(A) \u2192 \u03b8(B))] \u2192 (\u00ac\u03c8(A) \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8(B)) is a tautology, \u03d5(A) \u2192 \u03d5(B) \u2208 \u039b too.\nNow, we show that fixed-points of modal formulas are equivalent to modal formulas over \u00b5CS5. This is a formal version of Lemma 4.\nLemma 11. If \u03d5 has no fixed-point operators, then \u03bdX.\u03d5 \u2194 \u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a4)) \u2208 \u00b5CS5 and \u00b5X.\u03d5\u2194 \u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a5)) \u2208 \u00b5CS5.\nProof. \u03bdX.\u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5(\u03bdX.\u03d5) holds by \u03bdInd. Since X is positive in \u03d5, \u03bdX.\u03d5 \u2192 \u22a4 implies \u03d5(\u03bdX.\u03d5) by Lemma 10. By MP, \u03bdX.\u03d5\u2192 \u03d5(\u22a4). By the same argument, \u03bdX.\u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a4)). Now, as \u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a4)) \u2192 \u03d5(\u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a4))) is valid on any CS5 model, so is \u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a4)) \u2192 \u03bdX.\u03b8. So \u03bdX.\u03d5\u2192 \u03d5(\u03d5(\u22a4)) \u2208 \u00b5CS5.\nThe proof for \u00b5X.\u03d5 is similar.\nSimilar to how we proved Theorem 5, we use the Lemma 11 to prove:\nTheorem 12. Any \u00b5-formula is provably equivalent to a modal formula.\nThe Truth Lemma for fixed-point formulas With the provable collapse over CS5, we are now able to extend the Truth Lemma to all \u00b5-formulas.\nLemma 13. For all closed \u00b5-formula \u03d5,\nMc,\u0393 |= \u03d5 iff \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393.\nProof. We prove this lemma by structural induction on formulas, as we proved Lemma 9. We omit cases already treated above.\n\u2022 Let \u03d5 be \u03bdX.\u03c8(X). We want to show that Mc,\u0393 |= \u03bdX.\u03c8 iff \u03bdX.\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393.\nBy Lemma 11, \u03bdX.\u03c8 is provably equivalent to some modal formula \u03d5\u2032. So \u03d5\u2194 \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 \u0393.

An IS5 frame is a CS5 frame with no infallible world. That \u3008W,W\u22a5, ,\u2261\u3009 is a CS5 frame where W\u22a5 = \u2205. The logic GS5 is obtained by adding to IS5 the axiomGD := (\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)\u2228(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5). A GS5 frame is an IS5 which is locally linear: w u and w v imply u v or v u.\nThe logics \u00b5IS5 and \u00b5GS5 are obtained by adding fixed-point axioms and induction rules to IS5 and GS5, respectively. Note that all IS5 frames and GS5 frames are also CS5 frames. Therefore the \u00b5-calculus also collapses to modal logic over IS5 frames and GS5 frames. Using the methods above, we can show:\nTheorem 14. \u00b5IS5 is complete over IS5 frames.\nTheorem 15. \u00b5GS5 is complete over GS5 frames.\nThe canonical models M\u00b5IS5c and M \u00b5GS5 c are respectively obtained by restricting the canonical model M\u00b5CS5c to consistent \u00b5IS5-theories and consistent \u00b5GS5-theories."
