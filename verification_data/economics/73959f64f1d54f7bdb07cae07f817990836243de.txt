"Since the application of the optimization algorithm is superior results, analysis of the effect of ToU tariff and maximum demand on the power exchange of the power grid can be done strategically [11], [12]. Ultimately, in [13], the optimization algorithm and optimal DSM strategy formulation to reflect the EToU tariff scheme have been used to optimize the load profile to reduce the electricity price and maximum demand in peninsular Malaysia."
