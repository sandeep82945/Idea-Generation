Following exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) that undermine deeply held moral beliefs and expectations, HSCWs might experience moral injury (MI) and deleterious psychiatric consequences such as depression and anxiety symptoms. Objectives: To examine associations between exposure to PMIEs,MI symptoms, depression, and anxiety symptoms.We also aim to assess the moderating role of thwarted belongingness in these associations. Methods: A sample of 243 Israeli HSCWs completed online validated self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional designed survey in February and March 2021. Results: About one-third (33.6%) of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder, 21.5% met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, and 19.1 % reported comorbidity of depression and anxiety. A moderated-mediation model shows that high thwarted belongingness intensified the relations between exposure to PMIEs and MI symptoms, and between MI symptoms and depression and anxiety symptoms. Importantly, the indirect effect of exposure to PMIEs on both depression and anxiety symptoms via MI symptoms existed only among those with high levels of thwarted belongingness. Conclusions: The study\u2019s findings highlight the mental burden of HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the contribution of MI to possible mental health consequences. Clinicians should be aware of the importance of high thwarted belongingness in depression and anxiety sequelae of exposure to PMIEs among HSCWs.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Methods:Wemade a descriptive cross-sectional study. All workers were invited to participate in an online survey during May 2021. Individual characteristics and frequency of direct exposure to COVID during professional activity were assessed. We used three Spanish versions of psychometric scales: the Patient Health Questionnaire to evaluate depressive symptomatology, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, which detects anxiety, and the 4-item version of the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 for PTSD screening purposes. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 355 workers participated. Overall, 31% met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (PHQ-9> 9), 36% for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7> 9) and 22% for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PCL-5> 7). It has been found that young adult, women, those with prior mental disorders or those with greater exposure to COVID-19 are risk factors for any current mental disorder. Conclusions: There are large mental healthcare needs among healthcare professionals. There is a clear need to closely monitor the extent to which these needs are adequately met. In the design of measures and interventions to reduce this impact, an individualized approach should be considered while taking into account sociodemographic variables, psychiatric history and the frequency of direct exposure to COVID-19.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Hrnjica1*, \u0160. \u0160arki\u0107-Bedak1 and I. Lokmi\u0107- Peki\u010b2 1Psychiatric hospital Sarajevo, Women Department, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and 2Psychiatric hospital Sarajevo, Intensive Care Department, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1363\nIntroduction: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could result in various medical consequences. Clinical manifestations are diverse and range from asymptomatic or mild, fever-like symptoms, to more severe and life-threatening complications. Although the clinical presentation was initially dominated by respiratory symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and sequelae have been reported in COVID19 patients and convalescents. Objectives: To describe four clinical case reports of patients admitted to the inpatient unit of Psychiatric Hospital Sarajevo (PHS)with acute onset of psychosis in the recovery stage of COVID-19. Methods: In this case series we report cases of 4 patients, all female, mean age 53.25 years, hospitalized in PHS during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. All developed psychotic symptoms in the recovery phase of COVID-19. None had a previous history of psychiatric disturbances of any kind. All patients were diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder (BPD), according toDSM5 criteria for BPD. Results: COVID-19 affects various organ systems, including the brain, with variable symptoms based on disease severity. Psychotic features have been observed as well. The pathophysiology and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1363 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ndirect biological effects of the disease are not fully understood. COVID-19 patients and convalescents can develop psychotic symptoms as a consequence of multiple concurrent factors. Several proposed mechanisms include direct central nervous system infiltration, cytokine network dysregulation, peripheral immune cell transmigration, and post-infectious autoimmunity [1], treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress. Conclusions: Clinicians need to be aware of possible psychotic manifestations in COVID-19 patients and survivors. Long-term follow-up is warranted to provide efficient patient care.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Savvopoulou1*, K. Assimakopoulos2, P. Gourzis3 and E. Jelastopulu4 1UNIVERSITY OF PATRAS, Department Of Public Health, Medical School, PATRAS, Greece; 2UNIVERSITY OF PATRAS, Department Of Psychiatry, Medical School, PATRAS, Greece; 3General University Hospital of Patras, Greece, Department Of Psychiatry, Patras, Greece and 4School of Medicine, University of Patras, Public Health, Rio, Greece *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1364\nIntroduction: Imposing quarantine as a measure to manage the coronavirus pandemic is a stressful event that is often associatedwith negative psychological effects. Eating habits seemed to be significantly affected during the quarantine, while strongnegative emotions were triggered as the feeling of loneliness increased at the same time. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the eating habits of individuals during quarantine and the role of positive and negative emotions and loneliness in shaping these habits. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was performed using 3 validated scales, EAT-26 (3 subscales: Dieting, Bulimia and Food Preoccupation, Oral Control), Modified Differential Emotions Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale. Data was collected between April andMay 2021mainly from social media platforms. Statistical analyses included linear regression and mediation analyses. Results: Abnormal eating habits were detected in 25% of the participants (N= 450, ages 18-74) while the majority reported medium rates of negative/positive emotions and loneliness. Female sex is associated with abnormal eating habits (p=0.010) and mainly dietary behaviors (p=0.029). Negative emotions (p=0.032) and loneliness (p=0.001) seem tobe predictive factors of eating habits in general andbulimicbehaviors.Negative emotions correlate directlywith eating habits. However, we found a significant mediation of loneliness (p=0.032). Furthermore, the observed association between negative emotions and bulimia is partly mediated by loneliness (p=0.018). Conclusions: Negative emotions and loneliness seemed to play an important role in shaping eating habits during quarantine. Multilevel public health interventions are needed to address the negative effects of quarantine and pandemic in general.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Assessment of its impact on suicidal behavior might therefore be relevant. Objectives:To assess factors associated with suicidal ideation in the general population, using data from the French nationwide Epicov study Methods: In the nationally representative Epicov study, data on occurrence of suicidal ideation from November 2019 to November 2020 were available, including timing with respect to France\u2019s lockdown periods. We studied the incidence of suicidal ideation among participants without a prior history of suicidal behavior, after May 11, 2020, when first COVID-19 related lockdown was suspended. Studied factors assessed sociodemographic and health status, including mental health, as well as COVID-19 related information such as symptom.Associations between selected factors and suicidal ideation were assessed in sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models. Results: In the Epicov study, prevalence of suicidal ideation was of 2,9%, as opposed to around 4%pre-pandemic. Among 48 702 female and 41 016 male participants, health or financial issues were associated with a higher incidence of suicidal ideation. Interestingly, Covid19-like symptoms were also associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation.While an impairedmental health has been observed in survivors of past pandemics, given the unprecedented context of the current pandemic, this association needs further investigation. Conclusions:While the COVID-19 pandemic might have lowered suicidal ideation, it\u2019s aftermaths may reverse the trend. To prevent this rise, identification of vulnerable groups is crucial to promote tailored public health strategies.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
