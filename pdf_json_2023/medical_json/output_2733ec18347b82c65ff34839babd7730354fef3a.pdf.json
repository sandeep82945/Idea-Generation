MTN-035 was a randomized crossover trial seeking to evaluate the safety, acceptability, and adherence to three placebo modalities (insert, suppository, enema) prior to receptive anal intercourse (RAI). If participants had no RAI in a week, they were asked to use their assigned product without sex. We hypothesized that the modalities would be acceptable and safe for use prior to RAI, and that participants would report high adherence given their behavioral congruence with cleansing practices (e.g., douches and/or enemas) and their existing use to deliver medications (e.g., suppositories; fast-dissolving inserts) via the rectum. Participants (N = 217) were sexual and gender minorities enrolled in five different countries (Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States of America). Mean age was 24.9 years (range 18\u201335 years). 204 adverse events were reported by 98 PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284339 April 12, 2023 1 / 18 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

            "text": "The HIV epidemic has affected people across the globe over the past four decades, with sexual and gender minorities (SGM; i.e., populations with same-sex or same-gender attractions or behaviors and who may identify with a non-heterosexual identity such as gay, bisexual, queer, etc.)carrying much of the burden of new diagnoses [1]. While HIV prevalence rates vary among SGM in different regions (4% sub-Saharan Africa, 32% South East Asia, 44% South America, and 55% North America), the risk of acquiring HIV is 28 times higher among men who have sex with men (MSM) than adult men and 14 times higher for transgender people when compared to adult women [1]. Innovative biomedical advancements across the HIV prevention continuum (e.g., HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) have offered new opportunities to curtail HIV incidence [2], yet new HIV infections have remained high globally due to acceptability, access, uptake, and adherence challenges to these highly effective biomedical prevention tools [3]. Optimal uptake and adherence to PrEP has been hindered further by financial barriers and social stigma [4, 5], challenges accessing inclusive and sustained HIV prevention services [3, 6\u20138], or concerns regarding the possible side effects of systemic delivery of PrEP [9]. Therefore, efforts to develop a range of HIV prevention products that can serve as viable alternatives and/or complements to consistent condom use and oral PrEP, including formulations able to deliver multiple drugs (e.g., anti-HIV-1 and anti-HSV-2) in combination, remain crucial.\nResearchers and advocates have proposed expanding modalities of PrEP delivery, including\nthe use of rectal microbicides (RMs); topical biomedical products being developed to reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for use with sexual activity [9\u2013 11]. If found to be safe and effective, RMs may offer an episodic prevention modality for individuals who would perceive a pericoital prevention strategy more feasible and preferable to systemic daily or on demand oral PrEP modalities [9, 12]. In a randomized, cross-over trial comparing daily oral PrEP to two regimens (daily use and event-driven) of a rectal microbicide gel candidate, MSM and transgender women varied in their preferred strategy after using the products [13], with nearly 30% of the sample rating daily oral PrEP as the least preferred prevention method. Twenty percent of participants preferred an event-driven rectal microbicide strategy when engaging in condomless anal sex. Therefore, it is crucial for RMs to be designed so that they can be delivered via mechanisms that not only deliver enough drug to block HIV/ STI transmission but are also a good behavioral fit with the intended end-users based on their lifestyles.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284339 April 12, 2023 2 / 18\nidentifiable Protected Health Information (PHI).

Gilead Sciences donated study drug to studies led by AL. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.\nMost rectal microbicide candidates have been formulated as gels because of their similari-\nties to lubricants, highlighting the potential for the rectal microbicide gel to be readily incorporated into users\u2019 sexual practices [10, 14\u201316]. While ideal from a behavioral congruence perspective, these gel formulations have required the use of an applicator to achieve sufficient drug delivery, which could present acceptability and adherence challenges for long-term uses [17, 18], At this time, it is unclear if topical gels would be able to deliver protective levels of HIV prevention drugs when used without an applicator [15, 19, 20]. As such, researchers and advocates have argued that other rectal delivery modalities should be considered, including suppositories, fast-dissolving inserts, and enemas [21\u201323].\nSurvey research with SGM populations across various countries has found high hypotheti-\ncal acceptability to a rectal microbicide formulated as a suppository, insert, or enema [21, 24, 25]. while promising, the hypothetical nature of these studies limits our ability to understand whether SGM populations would find these modalities acceptable after using them with their partners prior to receptive anal intercourse (rai), and whether they would consistently use them when engaging in rai. to date, few studies with SGM populations have examined the acceptability, uptake of, and adherence to inserts, suppositories, or enemas as a rectal microbicide modality to be used prior to sex [26]. in a randomized, crossover acceptability trial where HIV-negative MSM used both 35 ml of placebo gel and an 8g placebo suppository prior to three rai occasions, respectively, participants noted moderate acceptability for the suppository, with the greatest proportion of participants preferring the gel over the suppository [26]. two clinical trials are examining the acceptability of rectal microbicide candidates as a fast-dissolving insert (mtn 039; nct04047420) and an enema (dream; nct04016233) for use among SGM populations, yet the results of these trials have yet to be released. moreover, no study has examined these modalities within the same trial, limiting our ability to compare their acceptability, safety, and adherence among SGM individuals who have used all three products rectally prior to rai. therefore, with the goal of supporting the development of behaviorally congruent rectal microbicide modalities for topical PrEP delivery, the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) developed MTN-035 (DESIRE; Developing and Evaluating Short-Acting Innovations for Rectal Use) to identify acceptable modalities among SGM in five different countries: Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States of America.\nThe primary objectives of MTN-035 were to evaluate the acceptability and safety of and\nadherence to three placebo modalities\u2013an insert, a suppository, and an enema\u2013that could be used prior to RAI in a randomized, cross-over trial. We hypothesized that all three modalities would be acceptable and safe for use prior to RAI, and that SGM participants would report high adherence to these modalities given their behavioral congruence with cleansing practices (e.g., enemas) and their familiar use to deliver medications (e.g., suppositories; fast-dissolving inserts) via the rectum."

            "text": "RMs are needed for individuals with an increased chance of acquiring HIV through RAI, particularly young SGM across the globe [23]. Given ongoing challenges to ensure equitable uptake and adherence to systemic oral PrEP and the desire for a diverse suite of HIV prevention products, it is important to expand the HIV/STI prevention pipeline by exploring whether different types of products that could be delivered through various modalities are safe, acceptable and adherable, and behaviorally congruent with the intended end-users\u2019 RAI practices [9].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284339 April 12, 2023 11 / 18\nwith less than 20% of AEs deemed related to the study products/modalities and only two related events being graded as having moderate clinical severity or higher. These findings align with our study hypothesis. The safety profile of all three administration modalities with placebo products is promising and underscores the potential of all three modalities as viable for rectal drug delivery. The low incidence of distinct product-related AEs (e.g., diarrhea, flatulence) across study products is also noteworthy, as it mirrors common AEs reported when using over-the-counter rectal products (e.g., enemas) and prior rectal microbicide candidates in clinical trials (e.g., gels). while we should continue to reduce the occurrence of any AEs during product development, the promising safety profiles for the three modalities using placebo products employed in this trial offer a threshold whereby future clinical trials examining these same modalities with active drug ingredients can benchmark their safety endpoints.\nConsistent with our hypotheses for our acceptability and adherence endpoints, SGM partic-\nipants reported high overall acceptability for all three products and high overall adherence per protocol and per RAI act. While survey research literature has noted high hypothetical acceptability to RMs as an HIV prevention strategy prior to RAI [9, 14, 15, 17, 20, 24, 32], there has been limited research exploring the real-world acceptability and adherence of these three products. The absence of these data is troubling from a product development perspective given the increasingly restrictive costs and resources required to empirically evaluate a promising biomedical HIV prevention candidate. In the absence of product acceptability and adherence data, the effectiveness of a PrEP candidate may be compromised if the intended end-users are not willing to use it. Future research examining the acceptability of and adherence to diverse PrEP candidates should remain a priority in clinical trials.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284339 April 12, 2023 12 / 18\nWhile overall acceptability and adherence were high for each product, we observed differ-\nences in acceptability and adherence after SGM participants had used all three modalities. While the products were rated similarly in their acceptability and there were no differences based on participants\u2019 assigned product sequence, adherence to the enema was higher when compared to the fast-dissolving insert or the suppository. Given the high prevalence of rectal douching prior to RAI among SGM globally [33], the greater adherence to the enema may be indicative of congruence between the benefits afforded by the modality and users\u2019 behavioral practices prior to RAI. In a recent study, for instance, Carballo-Die\u0301guez and colleagues [21] found that over 80% of SGM participants reported douching prior to RAI to rinse their rectum and feel clean, avoid smelling bad, and/or enhance their sexual pleasure. Given the limited data on the use of inserts or suppositories by SGM populations, however, it is unclear if these products could also yield behaviorally congruent benefits prior to or during RAI, including increasing sexual pleasure and lubricity during sex, and result in greater adherence in future studies.\nWe also observed differences for both acceptability and adherence between participants liv-\ning in the different communities across the five countries participating in the trial. Compared to San Francisco, participants in the other regions reported greater acceptability of the three rectal modalities under study. Consistent with prior research with hypothetical and real-world studies with rectal candidates [9, 13, 26, 34], these regional variations suggest that some modalities may be more acceptable or adherable in some contexts than others. It is possible that this difference in acceptability may be related to the various efficacious PrEP modalities already available in San Francisco (e.g., daily, and event-driven oral PrEP) and which may not be available or accessible in other regions. As such, participants in the San Francisco site may weigh acceptability differently given their ability to compare these placebo modalities against efficacious PrEP technologies. We also found differential adherence between participants in the San Francisco and the Johannesburg sites; however, it is unclear what may have contributed to these differences. Although the collected data suggests differences by sites, future research, both qualitative and quantitative, may be warranted given the number of comparisons and the absence of clear hypotheses to understand the factors contributing to these differences."

            "text": "This study had several strengths. First, this is the first study to examine the safety and acceptability of and adherence to these three promising modalities for rectal drug delivery prior to RAI. Examining each product\u2019s use in real life contexts strengthens the social validity of our findings and the potential use for these three modes of delivery in the future. Second, the crossover randomized design of our trial allowed us to assess SGM participants\u2019 acceptability of and adherence to these three modalities within the same trial, offering a unique opportunity to compare their acceptability, safety, and adherence within individuals who used all three products prior to RAI. Third, given the variability in both legal protections and social acceptance of SGM people between and within these countries, our ability to recruit and retain a large sample of young SGM living in geographically and socio-politically diverse countries is noteworthy and strengthens the generalizability of our findings to diverse contexts. Finally, our efforts to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during our data collection period minimized interruptions to our trial and ensured that rigor was preserved [27].\nNonetheless, our trial also had several limitations. First, self-reported responses tend to be favorable due to social desirability; however, we tried to minimize bias by having participants complete their questionnaires in a private location during their clinical visits. Second, there is a possibility of recall bias when participants completed their surveys. Third, we recruited a\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284339 April 12, 2023 13 / 18\nconvenience sample of participants willing to use each of the study products at least once per week, as required by the protocol. We acknowledge that the generalizability of our clinical trial findings may not be representative of all individuals practicing RAI. Fourth, given the placebo nature of the three products used in our trial, we were unable to employ a biological confirmation method regarding participants\u2019 product use and adherence, or examine the extent and duration of rectal coverage afforded by each product during and after sex. These data will be crucial in the future, particularly as drug candidates are embedded into these modalities and tested for safety and adherence. Fifth, we were unable to recruit the sexual partners of our study participants. Given existing data regarding partners\u2019 roles in young SGMs\u2019 decisionmaking when selecting HIV prevention strategies prior to sex, future research examining these dyadic dynamics may be warranted. Finally, while we designed our clinical trial to resemble participants\u2019 product use to as close as \u2018real-world\u2019 settings possible while maintaining rigor, we acknowledge that the trial protocols may hinder the social validity of the findings. Future research examining these products in real-world situations may further clarify their potential for use as rectal microbicide modalities."

            "text": "Advances in biomedical strategies for HIV prevention continue to emerge. Efforts to diversify HIV prevention options will strengthen our ability to reduce new HIV infections among SGM, whether some SGM desire systemic modalities (e.g., daily oral PrEP; PrEP injectables) or prefer topical protection (e.g., RMs). Regardless of the mode of administration, the effectiveness of these HIV prevention strategies will require that users have access to safe and acceptable products which are easy to use consistently. Our trial addresses the limited data available regarding the safety and acceptability of and adherence to enemas, inserts, and suppositories as potential modalities through which to deliver a rectal microbicide. findings from this trial demonstrate high safety profiles, alongside high levels of acceptability and adherence, among all three modalities. future research examining the acceptability, adherence, safety, and efficacy of promising prep candidates using these three rectal microbicide modalities is encouraged."
