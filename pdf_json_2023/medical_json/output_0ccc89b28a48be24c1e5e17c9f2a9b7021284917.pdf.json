    "abstractText": "Objective: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare, immunemediated disorder in which an aberrant immune response causes demyelination and axonal damage of the peripheral nerves. Genetic contribution to CIDP is unclear and no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been reported so far. In this study, we aimed to identify CIDPrelated risk loci, genes and pathways. Methods: To increase power, we first included all patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory polyneuropathy (IP) as cases. We performed a GWAS study using FinnGen R10 individual data and combined the results with GWAS from UK biobank (UKBB) using a fixed-effect metaanalysis. A total of 1,261 IP cases and 823,730 controls were included in the analysis. The second GWAS focused on CIDP patients and a total of 516 CIDP cases and 403,545 controls were included in the analysis. Stratified analyses by gender were also performed for both IP and CIDP. We performed gene-level analyses using transcriptome-wide mendelian randomization (TWMR) analysis, colocalization analysis, transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using S-PrediXcan and MAGMA to identify genes associated with IP and CIDP. Gene-set analyses were conducted using MAGMA to identify pathways that are related to IP and CIDP. Results: In GWAS study, we identified one genome-wide significant loci at 20q13.33 for CIDP risk among women; the top variant located at the intron region of gene CDH4. TWMR, colocalization and S-PrediXcan analyses identified DGKQ, GLDC, IDUA, SLAMF9 and TMEM175 as candidate pathogenic genes for IP; genes DIRAS1, GNG7, and SLC39A3 for CIDP; genes DIRAS1, DCTN1, and ME1 for IP among males; and genes DIRAS1 and ME1 for IP among women. MAGMA gene-set analyses identified a total of 18 pathways related to IP or CIDP. Conclusion: Our study identified suggestive risk genes and pathways for IP and CIDP. Functional analysis should be conducted to further confirm these associations. All rights reserved.

Genetic contribution to CIDP is unclear and no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been reported so far. In this study, we aimed to identify CIDPrelated risk loci, genes and pathways.\nMethods: To increase power, we first included all patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory polyneuropathy (IP) as cases. We performed a GWAS study using FinnGen R10 individual data and combined the results with GWAS from UK biobank (UKBB) using a fixed-effect metaanalysis. A total of 1,261 IP cases and 823,730 controls were included in the analysis. The second GWAS focused on CIDP patients and a total of 516 CIDP cases and 403,545 controls were included in the analysis. Stratified analyses by gender were also performed for both IP and CIDP. We performed gene-level analyses using transcriptome-wide mendelian randomization (TWMR) analysis, colocalization analysis, transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using S-PrediXcan and MAGMA to identify genes associated with IP and CIDP. Gene-set analyses were conducted using MAGMA to identify pathways that are related to IP and CIDP.\nResults: In GWAS study, we identified one genome-wide significant loci at 20q13.33 for CIDP risk among women; the top variant located at the intron region of gene CDH4. TWMR, colocalization and S-PrediXcan analyses identified DGKQ, GLDC, IDUA, SLAMF9 and TMEM175 as candidate pathogenic genes for IP; genes DIRAS1, GNG7, and SLC39A3 for CIDP; genes DIRAS1, DCTN1, and ME1 for IP among males; and genes DIRAS1 and ME1 for IP among women. MAGMA gene-set analyses identified a total of 18 pathways related to IP or CIDP.\nConclusion: Our study identified suggestive risk genes and pathways for IP and CIDP. Functional analysis should be conducted to further confirm these associations.\nInternal"

            "text": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare, immune-mediated inflammatory polyneuropathy (IP) in which an aberrant immune response causes demyelination and axonal damage of the peripheral nerves [1]. CIDP is characterized by progressive weakness, sensory loss, and impaired reflexes in the limbs, which can lead to significant disability if left untreated. The incidence and prevalence of CIDP is 0.2-1.6 per 100,000 person-years and 0.8-10.3 per 100,000 persons, respectively, depending on geography and diagnostic criteria [2]. CIDP prevalence was higher among males and increased with age[3]. Despite the rarity of the disease, CIDP has a substantial impact on both physical and mental health[4], [5], which impairs patient quality of life[6]. CIDP is often practically viewed as the chronic counterpart of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) due to various electrophysiological, histological, and immune similarities, despite differences in time course, mode of evolution, prognosis, and responsiveness to steroids.\nWhile the etiology of CIDP is not fully understood, genetic factors are believed to play a role in disease susceptibility. Two early studies reported the occurrence of familial clustering of CIDP patients [7], [8]. A few candidate gene studies identified several genes associated with CIDP risk, such as the GA13-16 homozygote genotype of the SH2D2A gene, which was found to be associated with increased CIDP risk (OR = 3.17) [9]. Additionally, several HLA polymorphisms, including the HLA-DRB1\u221713 allele, have been found to be related to CIDP risk [10]. Gene expression studies also identified genes that are up-regulated in sural nerve biopsies from 8 patients of CIPD[11] and in skin biopsies from 11 CIDP patients[12]. These previous studies examined limited number of genes among very few patients. Given the current limited understanding of the genetic factors underlying CIDP susceptibility, a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may provide valuable insights into the disease pathogenesis and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics.\nIn this study, we assembled data from two large biobanks and conducted the first genome- and transcriptome- wide association study for CIDP including a total of 516 cases and 403,545 controls. To identify genetic factors driving IP more generally and to\nInternal\npotentially increase power, we also performed GWAS studies for IP, including a total of 1,261 IP patients and 823,730 controls. We also performed gender specified GWASs for both IP and CIDP.\nInternal"

IP GWAS signal colocalized with eQTLs of 5 genes in multiple tissues (probability >= 0.8), namely DGKQ, IDUA, GLDC, SLAMF9 and TMEM175 (Table 1, Supplementary table 1). Therefore, five potentially pathogenic genes with evidence of a shared genetic effect between the eQTL and IP risk were identified from MR and colocalization analyses.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS studying CIDP genetic risk. We identified one novel genome-wide significant locus associated with CIDP risk among women in FinnGen. Leveraging gene-level TWMR, colocalization and S-PrediXcan analyses, we prioritized 5 novel candidate pathogenic genes for IP, and 3 for CIDP. In the sexstratified analyses, 3 additional novel genes were identified for IP. We also identified a total of 18 pathways that are enriched in IP/CIDP genetic risk using gene-set analysis.\nThe genome-wide significant SNP rs80339443 located at the intron region of CDH4 gene, which encodes the retinal-cadherin (R-cadherin) protein, a calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein. Cadherin has been indicated to play an important role in brain segmentation, neuronal outgrowth and muscle regeneration [13]\u2013[18]. In addition, CDH4 is involved in cell-cell cohesion, inhibition of apoptosis and cell signaling, and tumorigenesis [19]. Some studies have suggested a potential role of CDH4 in neurodegeneration, related to axon genesis [20] and axon navigation and fasciculation [21].\nAnother prioritized gene identified in our analyses is TMEM175, which encodes a lysosomal proton channel protein that plays an important role in regulation of lysosomal pH and autophagy [22] , as well as influence \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial function [23]. Autophagy plays a crucial role during neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, as well as at the synaptic zone [24]. Failure of autophagy in neurons can result in the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins and neurodegeneration, and enhancing autophagy activity has been indicated as an efficient therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) diseases [25]. Autophagy process has not been investigated in CIDP so far. Some animal models were studied on other polyneuropathy diseases. For example, one rat model of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) suggested that autophagy activity is increased in nerve tissue of EAN rats, and the macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, the inhibitor of autophagy, ameliorated the neurologic severity of EAN [26]. Another study using a rat model mimicking human CIDP, the chronic experimental autoimmune neuritis (chronicEAN) model, demonstrate that prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of chronic-EAN\nInternal\nrats with the CMA-targeting P140 peptide considerably ameliorates the clinical and biological course of the disease in chronic-EAN rats [27].\nA major limitation in this study is the small sample size, with statistical power for genome-wide risk locus discovery being underpowered. In the exploratory genome-wide analyses, for alleles with MAF of 20%, there was only a priori adequate power (80%) to detect alleles with large effects (OR > 1.75 for CIDP and OR > 1.4 for IP) at genomewide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128). Nevertheless, it is challenging to obtain genetic data for a rare disease like CIDP and our study represents the first GWAS study for CIDP so far. More efforts are needed to pool more genetic data to achieve better statistical power.\nIn conclusion, our study discovered novel genetic risk loci, genes, and pathways that could provide further insights into biological mechanisms of IP and CIDP pathogenesis. Functional studies on these discoveries would be valuable to better understand CIDP pathophysiology and identify potential new treatments.\nInternal"

This GWAS was performed in 346 IP cases with ICD-10 diagnosis of G61 and 420,185 healthy controls. Per-allele odds ratios (ORs) and P-value of each variant were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, age * sex, age2, age2 * sex, and the first 10 principal components (PC).

We also included some infection diseases (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis B or C) because CIDP may be triggered by an infection in some case report, and cancers because some studies reported an increased incidence of cancer in patients with CIDP. We employed an in-house gene prioritization scheme, which contained precalculated results across 6,918 GWAS from 4 sources, including UK Biobank, FinnGen release 10 (R10), EBI GWAS catalog, and meta-analyses of UK Biobank, FinnGen R10, and Estonian biobank. This gene-ranking scheme used a combinatory approach to prioritize disease putative genes based on MR, eQTL colocalization, activity-by-contact (ABC) enhancer-promoter interactions, and variant annotations.

Overall, meta-analysis examined whether a gene_i is a recurrent DGE enriched for a given disease, tissue, or sample (e.g.: Alzheimer\u2019s disease and brain tissue) when compared to recurrency of the gene in the entire database.
