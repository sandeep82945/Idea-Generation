Patients were categorized into HCMV + and HCMV- groups based on the HCMV DNA real-time PCR results. After isolating CD4+ T cells from PBMCs, the phenotype (CCR6+CCR4+CCR10+) and cytokine profile (IFN-\u03b3\u2212IL-17\u2212IL-22+) of Th22 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The gene expression of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) transcription factor was analyzed by real-time PCR.\nResults The phenotype frequency of these cells was lower in recipients with infection than in those without infection and healthy controls (1.88 \u00b1 0.51 vs. 4.31 \u00b1 1.05; P = 0.03 and 4.22 \u00b1 0.72; P = 0.01, respectively). A lower Th22 cytokine profile was observed in patients with infection than in the two other groups (0.18 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.20 \u00b1 0.03; P = 0.96 and 0.33 \u00b1 0.05; P = 0.04, respectively). AHR expression was also lower in patients with active infection.\nConclusions Overall, this study for the first time suggests that the reduced levels of Th22 subset and IL-22 cytokine in patients with active HCMV infection might indicate the protective role of these cells against HCMV.\nKeywords CD4+ T cells, Human cytomegalovirus, IL-22, Kidney transplantation, Th22"

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most opportunistic recurrent virus in kidney transplantation, causing viremia, disease, or even organ rejection [1\u20134]. As central orchestrators of the immune system, CD4+ T cells have an important role in HCMV infection [2]. The frequency of CD4+ T cells specific for HCMV is inversely correlated with the virus proliferation and DNA load in kidney transplant recipients [5]. Also, CD4+ T cells\u2019 ongoing responses against HCMV are associated with the control and clearance of infection. Thus, understanding their function mechanism is essential to designing new therapies [6].\nThe CD4+ T cells are heterogenous and exert their direct antiviral function (e.g., cytolytic activity) along with their traditional helper function (e.g., enhancement of CD8+ T cells and B cells antibody production) via their various subsets [7, 8]. When these cells encounter a pathogen, they differentiate into functionally distinct subsets, including T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, Th9, Th22, Tfh, and Treg cells determined by their master transcription factor and signature cytokines [2, 6, 7, 9\u201311].\nThe protective role of Th1 cells against HCMV has been shown, and their frequency is associated with infection occurrence. Th1 cells producing TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-2 were reduced during HCMV active infection in Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) recipients, e.g., kidney and liver [12\u201315]. In contrast, evidence shows that Th2 cells producing IL-4 may exacerbate infection by reducing Th1 immunity or transmitting HCMV to monocytes [9, 13, 14, 16, 17]. The Tfh cells producing IL-21 are related to HCMV control in SOT patients via increasing the neutralizing and IgG antibodies. An increased level of these cells is associated with HCMV clearance [18\u201320]. Moreover, the increased frequency of Treg cells producing TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 is associated with the progressive proliferation of the virus. Their suppressive cytokines can reduce effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [21\u201324]. However, the role of recently identified CD4+ T cell subsets, i.e., Th22 and Th9, against the HCMV infection, has not been evaluated yet.\nKnowledge about the role of Th22 cells in viral infection is little, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on HCMV infection. Th22 cells produce IL-22 as a signature cytokine and express Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) as a lineage-specific transcription factor. Depending on the inherent infection factors, they have divergent protective and pathologic roles in viral infections [11, 25, 26]. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 cytokines induce the naive CD4+ cells\u2019 differentiation to Th22 with the phenotype of C-C Chemokine Receptor (CCR) 4+ CCR6+ CCR10+ [27, 28].\nIL-22 interaction with its receptor IL-22R subsequently activates of JAK1 and Tyk2 and phosphorylation\nof STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 to exert antiviral and tissue protective function [26, 29, 30]. For example, in HIV infection, it is observed that the increased amounts of Th22 cells are associated with resistance to infection and IL-22 has a protective role in mucosal sites [26, 31]. Contrary to the previous case, secreted IL-22 in West Nile virus infection mediates viral dissemination by recruiting neutrophils in infection sites [25]. A dual opposite function has also been reported for IL-22 in defense against HBV [32].\nTherefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the presence and frequency of Th22 cells and their signature cytokine, IL-22, as a first step to shedding light on their functional nature in kidney transplant patients with and without HCMV infection. Besides, the frequency of Th17 cells and IL-17 cytokine were reported. We showed that Th22 cells and IL-22 decreased in recipients with active infection, parallel to a decrease in Th17 cells."

The data showed that the Th22 phenotype was significantly lower in HCMV + patients than in HCMV- patients and healthy individuals (1.88 \u00b1 0.51 vs. 4.31 \u00b1 1.05; P = 0.03 and\n4.22 \u00b1 0.72; P = 0.01, respectively).

Regarding each of the CCR4, CCR6, and CCR10 chemokine receptors, after analyzing them against side scatter, their frequencies showed lower amounts in HCMV + patients than in HCMV- and control groups. The distribution of CD4+CCR6+ and CD4+CCR10+ T cells showed no statistical difference between the study groups. However, CD4+CCR4+ T cells showed significantly lower frequency in HCMV + patients than in HCMV- ones (18.99 \u00b1 2.07 vs. 30.78 \u00b1 4.22; P = 0.02).

We then evaluated the frequency phenotype changes of Th22 and Th17 cells between patients who received induction therapy and those who did not. There were no differences between these subgroups in both HCMV + and HCMV- groups."

            "text": "Th22 cells and their cytokine, IL-22, have been shown to protect against various bacterial and viral infections. However, there was no data about these cells\u2019 role in HCMV infection. Thus, we have studied the frequency and functionality of the Th22 subset by staining a combination of chemokine receptors (CCR4+CCR6+CCR10+) and intracellular cytokines (IFN-\u03b3\u2212IL-17\u00a0 A\u2212IL-22+) and the expression of AHR transcription factor in kidney transplant patients with HCMV reactivation. In addition, the frequency of Th17 cells was studied.\nOur results demonstrated that these cells were lower in HCMV + kidney transplant patients than in HCMVpatients and healthy controls. Lower frequencies of IL-22 and AHR expression were also observed. Similar results were observed for the frequency of Th17 cells and IL-17. The ROC curve analysis showed that the phenotype frequency of both Th22 and Th17 cells could be used to predict HCMV infection. The area under the curve was quite\nthe same for both subsets. Our findings provide new data about the possible role of Th22 cells in the immune response against HCMV infection and open an area for further research. Simultaneous assessment of cell phenotype and functionality could accurately determine the status of Th22 in defeating the infection. These cells could be used to predict HCMV infection in kidney transplant patients, but further validation is needed.\nWe believe there is no study on the frequency of Th22 cells and IL-22 production in HCMV infection. Regarding other viral infections, studies have reported IL-22 production by T cells with an antiviral protective role. The increased levels of Th22 cells were observed in acute viral myocarditis induced by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) with a protective role [28]. Repeatedly HIV-1 exposed but uninfected individuals have been shown to overproduce IL-22 cytokine by CD4+ T cells with a possible protective role through acute phase proteins such as serum amyloid A [31, 33]. Indeed, increased systemic levels of IL-22 were related to low HIV replication in vitro [33]. Page et al. reported Th22 cell reduction in untreated HIV-1 infected patients [34]. In our study, we observed the reduced frequency of Th22 in both phenotype and cytokine profiles in HCMV + patients, suggesting their possible antiviral role in HCMV- patients.\nIn a murine cytomegalovirus study, different immune cells, such as T and NK cells, produced IL-22 in response to the infection. The secreted IL-22 was determined to restrict MCMV function by recruiting neutrophils. IL-22 induced the production of CXCL1 chemokine to recruit neutrophils at the infection sites. These neutrophils show their anti-MCMV function through the TRIAL/TRAILR pathway [26]. In addition, the in vivo\nincreased expression of IL-22 mRNA has been reported [30]. As a convenient model for HCMV in host immunity and pathogenesis, this study may bring the same antiviral properties in mind for HCMV. However, it has been revealed that HCMV facilitates its dissemination during acute infection through neutrophil recruitment by encoding the homolog of CXCL1 (UL146). Notably, in immunosuppressed individuals, neutropenia was proposed as a risk factor for herpesvirus infection [26]. Therefore, further investigation is needed.\nThe reduction of Th22 cells in this study could result from the progressive proliferation of HCMV in our patients, as the viral load for all of them was more than 1 \u00d7 104 copies/ml. Thus, due to high viral load and possible increased immunopathology of immune cells, the immune modulatory cells such as Treg cells may disrupt immune responses by TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 production [21]. In MCMV infection, a high viral load was observed in mice lacking IL-22 [26].\nTGF-\u03b2 inhibits the differentiation of Th22 from na\u00efve CD4+ T cells [20, 35]. Moreover, virus-encoded IL-10 homolog, capable of inducing host IL-10, synergizes with this process to make it worse and modulates the immune system [36, 37]. IL-10 maintains the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, a proper place for the proliferation of the virus, and up-regulates HCMV immediate-early genes to attenuate antiviral responses [38, 39]. It has been proposed that the decreased ratio of Th22/Treg may contribute to immune deficiency in HIV-1 infection [31]. Therefore, it could be a possible reason for the Th22 and Th17 reduction in our study, which needs further investigation.\nIt may also bring to mind that the reduction in these cells in HCMV + patients could be due to immunosuppression therapy that transplanted patients received. It is evident that immunosuppression affects the frequency and composition of CD4+ T cell subsets, including a reduction in the IFN-\u03b3 producing Th1 and circulating follicular regulatory T cells (cTfr) [40, 41]. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on Th22 cells and cytokine has not been studied well. It may be due to little knowledge about the involvement of these cells in organ rejection, as Claeys et al. and Liu et al. mentioned [42, 43]. The only difference between HCMVpatients and the control group in this study was the receipt of the immunosuppressive drugs by the patients. Our results showed no differences in the frequency phenotype of Th22 and Th17 cells between these two groups. However, both HCMV + and HCMV- kidney transplanted patients were under the same condition and received immunosuppressive drugs. So, reduced Th22 and Th17 phenotype frequency in the HCMV + group compared to the HCMV- one may bring the hypothesis that HCMV infection may impact on these cell populations.\nThe role of Th22 cells in viral infections depends on the context and is less well-defined [25, 26, 28, 33]. The factors encoded by a specific pathogen likely affect the outcome of Th22 responses [25]. Moreover, it has been reported that IL-22 can have paradoxical functions in a distinct viral infection. As demonstrated before, IL-22 can promote the chemokine-induced recruitment of proinflammatory Th17 cells in HBV infection, which result in inflammation and liver damage [33]. However, IL-22 alone can protect hepatocytes from apoptosis in viral hepatitis-induced liver damage [44].\nIL-22 mainly functions by synergizing with other cytokines and chemokines to recruit immune cells [33]. For example, the signaling of IL-22 through interaction with IL-22R can modulate the production of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [28, 44]. It is important to know which signaling pathways and cytokines are induced by Th22 cells and IL-22 to predict their exact role in a particular viral infection [33]. In our study, both IL-22 and IFN-\u03b3 were reduced in HCMV + patients. It may be related to the immunological status of these patients, indicating the defect of Th1 immunity, a crucial factor for resolving the infection.\nDifferent studies have shown a positive correlation between the frequency of Th17 and Th22 cells and their canonical cytokines [27, 29, 31, 45]. Concomitant increases of Th17 and Th22 cells have been observed in CVB3 infection [28]. The decreased levels of these cells together were also described during HIV infection [45]. We also observed a positive correlation between the phenotype frequency of Th17 and Th22 in both HCMV + and HCMV- patients. The present study showed that reduced amounts of Th22 phenotype were concomitant with a reduction in Th17 cells.\nTh17 cells and IL-17 increases have been reported in SOT transplant patients with HCMV active infection [46\u201348]. There is a controversy about the role of these cells against HCMV. It has been reported that these cells may have positive or negative effects on HCMV infection. The proinflammatory properties of IL-22 are enhanced when synergized with IL-17 in some viral infections [29, 44, 49]. In contrast, the simultaneous increase of Th22 and Th17 cells in CVB3 infection showed no development of IL-22 proinflammatory function, as neutralization of IL-22 exacerbated the disease severity by decreasing the IFN-\u03b3 cytokine and contributing to viral replication [28]. We did not examine the effect of IL-22 on HCMV; however, reduced levels of both cytokines (IL-22 and IL-17) in HCMV + patients and the restriction role of IL-22 against MCMV, as mentioned before, may bring the hypothesis that the synergistic function of these cytokines together could be in favor of antiviral responses in HCMV- patients.\nRegarding the prediction potential of T cells in HCMV infection, most researchers have investigated other members of CD4+ T cells than recently identified Th22 cells. The reduced levels of Tfh and Th1 cells are associated with HCMV active infection and suggested for predicting HCMV outcomes in SOT transplant recipients [12\u201314, 18, 20, 24]. For example, Gerna et al. reported that the levels of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ T cells of more than 0.4 cells/\u00b5l of blood in SOT patients were associated with protection from HCMV disease [50]. We showed that the cut-off value of \u2264 2.34% of the total Th22 phenotype could be used to predict HCMV infection, although we did not use virus-specific stimulation.\nThe reported data about the prediction value of Th17 cells showed that most studies could not find a proper association between viral outcomes and the frequency of these cells after transplantation [21, 51]. Just a study in 2018 showed that the pre-transplantation plasma levels of IL-23 cytokine, Th17-associated cytokine, more than 7 pg/ml might predict HCMV disease [52]. In our study, we showed that the phenotype frequency of Th17 cells with a cut-off value of \u2264 7.08% could be used to predict HCMV infection similar to Th22 after transplantation.\nFor the first time, the present study demonstrated the frequency of Th22 cells and production of IL-22 in HCMV infection among kidney transplant patients but with some limitations. First, we examined the frequency in a relatively small population. For better results, we need to extend the study population with different transplanted organs to investigate the effect of population diversity on the frequency of Th22 cells. Second, we did not have the baseline or samples before the initiation of viremia for our patients to investigate the frequency of Th22 cells before the onset of HCMV. So, working on such samples in future studies could help to find out if the low frequency of these cells is a cause or consequence of HCMV infection. Even, samples from the peak of infection or post-infection time points could give us information about the dynamics of Th22 cells during a course of infection. Third, our results represent the general frequency of these cells and their cytokines. Thus, to elucidate the specific responses, further analysis by HCMV-specific antigens or HCMV lysate stimulation would be helpful to determine correlation between Th22 cells and the virus. Lastly, to investigate the predicting value of Th22 cells in association with viral outcomes, their frequency should be investigated in patients with progressive infection or HCMV disease."

It seems that this reduction, along with reduced Th17 cells, might be a consequence of HCMV infection. These two cell types, Th22 and Th17, may have a synergistic function during HCMV infection. Moreover, it is possible to predict the occurrence of the infection by using the phenotype frequency of both Th22 and Th17 cells. Further investigations are essential to understand the precise function of Th22 cells against HCMV and the mechanism of their action."

Isotype control of PE mouse IgG1, \u03ba (MOPC-21 clone, Cat. no., 400,112), FITC mouse IgG1, \u03ba (MOPC-21 clone, Cat. no., 400,137), and PerCP/Cyanine5.5 mouse IgG2a, \u03ba (MOPC-173 clone, cat. no., 400,251) were used for gating and antibody specificity (BioLegend, USA). Subsequently, the cells were analyzed on FACS Calibur and data analysis was performed by using FlowJo_V10 version 10.5.3 software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, USA)."

Realtime PCR was performed by adding 1\u00a0\u00b5l cDNA to 5\u00a0\u00b5l of SG qPCR Master Mix (2X) plus ROX (EURx, Gda\u0144sk, Poland) with AHR specific primers. The mixture was incubated on Step One Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems-Grand Island, USA). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene was used to normalize AHR expression, and the data were quantified by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.
