Extensive research worldwide is underway to find novel therapeutics for prevention and treatment of diseases. The extracted natural sources have shown to be one of the best and effective treatments for cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Different approaches including disc potato model, brine shrimp, and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were adopted to analyze the anticancer effects. Habenaria digitata was also evaluated for MTT activity against NIH/3T3 cell line. The dexamethasone, etoposide, and vincristine sulfate were used as a positive control in these assays. All of the extracts including crude extracts (Hd.Cr), saponin (Hd.Sp), n-hexane (Hd.Hx), chloroform (Hd.Chf), ethyl acetate (Hd.EA), and aqueous fraction (Hd.Aq) were shown excellent results by using various assays. For example, saponin and chloroform have displayed decent antitumor and angiogenic activity by using potato tumor assay. The saponin fraction and chloroform were shown to be the most efficient in potato tumor experiment, demonstrating 87.5 and 93.7% tumor suppression at concentration of 1000\u03bcg/ml, respectively, with IC50 values of 25.5 and 18.3\u03bcg/ml. Additionally, the two samples, chloroform and saponins, outperformed the rest of the test samples in terms of antiangiogenic activity, with IC50 28.63\u03bcg/ml and 16.20\u03bcg/ml, respectively. In characterizing all solvent fractions, the chloroform (Hd.Chf) and saponin (Hd.Sp) appeared to display good effectiveness against tumor and angiogenesis but very minimal activity against A. tumefaciens. The Hd.Chf and Hd.Sp have been prospective candidates in the isolation of natural products with antineoplastic properties.\nHindawi BioMed Research International Volume 2022, Article ID 9051678, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9051678\nRE TR AC TE D"

            "text": "Cancer is a challenging disease worldwide because it is a major cause of mortality and morbidity [1]. Due to cancer, death ratio is almost high when compared to other diseases like AIDS, malaria, T.B, pneumonia, and other death causing diseases [2]. Cancer has been ranked as the second largest cause of mortality in developed nations and third major death cause in underdeveloped nations [3]. Every year, over ten million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with cancer, which results in 12.5% of the global total, i.e., 7.1 million deaths approximately. Cancer is characterized by several hallmarks such as avoiding immune destruction, growth suppressors, sustaining proliferation signaling, tumor stimulating inflammation, persuading angiogenesis, instability of genome, metastasis, allowing the immortality replication, dysregulating cellular energetics, and ultimately cell death [4, 5].\nAngiogenesis is one of the most important goals for treating various pathological conditions including cancer and other death causing disease. It has a fundamental role in new vascular network formation for supply of oxygen, nutrient, and immune cells also in suppression of waste materials [6]. Angiogenesis is starting from the embryo, where it initiates the primary vascular network as well as a sufficient vasculature for growth and development of organs [7]. Major indicating molecules involved in angiogenesis include angiopoietin 1 and angiopoietin 2 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), angiotropin, angiogenin, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2. Freshly discovered angiogenesis inhibitors not only revealed an attractive therapeutic approach against cancer [8].\nPotato disc assay is costly, more effective, rapid, and reliable bioassay to provide the source for apparent anticancer and antitumor effectiveness of the tested fractions [9]. In potato disc assay, inhibition of tumor (crown gall) is influenced by A. tumefaciens which have the antimitotic potential and also antitumor property [9]. Neoplastic illness known as crown gall tumor is caused by A. tumefaciens in plants [10]. Tumor-inducing plasmids in A. tumefaciens include genetic material with information (T-DNA) and can transmit the infection to normal plant cells or damaged areas resulting in autonomous tumor cell [11]. These tumor-inducing plasmids cause plant cells to multiply rapidly without passing through apoptosis, resulting in tumor that grows fast, in the similar manner as human and animal tumors [12].\nLikewise, to detect the fundamental cytotoxicity of synthetic and natural drugs, the brine shrimp cytotoxicity activity is a critical technical way before moving to more complicated and advanced research [13]. In terms of phytochemicals, they have definite biological prospects. Like saponins, which are well known for their cytotoxic potential, flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant potential, and alkaloids, that have been reported by a number of studies and renowned for their antimicrobial activity [14].\nThe natural anticancer drugs are more effective and less toxic as compared to synthetic anticancer drugs because synthetic anticancer drugs have toxicity issues, are expensive, and have negative side effects; natural products are the\nhighly promising source of efficient anticancer treatments [15\u201317]. The herbal medicines are primarily used up to eighty percent of total population for the primary wellbeing in developing countries. In this perspective, the natural products have been considered rich in phytochemicals such as glycosides, renins, tannins, flavonoids, polyphenol, alkaloids, and terpenoids [18\u201320]. These active ingredients present in the natural products like plants possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antimicrobial, antimycotic, and anticancer properties [21\u201323].\nGenus of the Habenaria is related with family Orchidaceae, which consist round about 850 genera and total 35000 species [24]. Orchids were used for different illness like arthritis, stomach problem, syphilis, acidity, jaundice, tumor, boils, piles, inflammations, hepatitis, blood dysentery, malaria, pyrexia, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, cholera, eczema, wounds, diarrhea, and vermifuge [25]. An attempt to reexplore the medicinal properties of the herbs would aid in management of the diseases like cancer. With the available information, the current study was conducted to assess various anticancer effects of Habenaria digitata crude extract and their consequent fractions."

            "text": "2.1. Collection and Extracts. Habenaria digitata plant was identified and isolated from Lower Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan, in April mid because the active ingredients are present in increased amount as compared to other months of the year. Afterwards, it was recognized via by Prof. Muhammad Nisar, Chairman of the Department of Botany, University of Malakand Dir (L) KPK, Pakistan. The plant sample was stored and recorded at herbarium having voucher number H.UOM. BG.180. The plant\u2019s aerial components (15 kg) were bathed in sterile water and then dried in a totally shaded environment for 14 days. Cut it into little pieces using a mortar and pestle or a grinder once it has dried, and crush it into extremely small particulates (7.5 kg). The small coarse particles were then immersed in 24 L of 80% methanol for around 21 days. After that, the entire material was filtered using the muslin cloth, followed by the Whatman filter paper, and the liquid was collected. The filtrate was then taken to a rotary evaporator (at 40\u00b0C) for further extraction [14]. After deliberating 650 g, the final gloomy green color hard methanolic extract of H. digitata was obtained.\n2.2. Fractionation. The methanolic extract was poured into a separating funnel with a vacuum-sealed stopper. After that, the Hd.Cr was combined with 500ml of n-hexane and a corresponding quantity of water. The separating funnel was shook violently to thoroughly mix all of the materials and then held in place with a stand to separate the water and n-hexane layers. Then, just the hexane layer was separated in both layers. Through 500ml of n-hexane, the identical operation was done twice. The organic layers were separated three times before being combined and concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotating evaporator at 40\u00b0C. Hexane was found to have a concentrated weight of 27.6 gm likewise;\nRE TR AC TE\nthe same method is followed to raise the polarization of the other solvents using the same approach. The next solvent fractions were ethyl acetate, chloroform, and Bt., with weights of 30, 42, and 94 g, respectively. Finally, at a weight of 140 gm, the aqueous stratum was concentrated [26].\n2.3. Quantitative Estimation of Phytochemicals. The qualitative investigations of plant extract phytochemicals were performed for detection of alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, terpenoids, anthraquinone, saponins, flavonoids, oils, and sterols using the method reported previously [27]. The 0.2 gm of the crude extract was taken and mixed with 2% sulphuric acid. The mixture was hot for a while and then cooled. Afterward, sample filtered and treated with Dragendorff\u2019s reagent. The orange red precipitate exhibited presence of alkaloids. For the anthraquinone analysis, the 2 g of crude extract was macerated with the ether. The solution was mixed, and the presence of red, pink, or violet color in aqueous layer formation indicates presence of anthraquinones [28].\nFor the glycosides test, 1ml concentrated sulphuric acid and the 5ml of aqueous extract were mixed with glacial acetic acid (2ml) having ferric chloride of 1 drop. The brown ring formation was indicated presence of glycosides. For the tannin test, 20ml distilled water was added to 2 g sample and then heated for 5min. This solution was filtered and cooled. From this, 1ml was added to 5ml water. Then, 2 drops of ferric chloride 10% were added. A bluish-black precipitate showed tannin presence. For terpenoids, identification extract was suspended water (5ml), heated, and then filtered; after that, 2ml chloroform was mixed to filtrate, followed by additional 3ml sulphuric acid. The reddish brown color appearance indicates presence of terpenoids [29].\n2.4. Determination of Total Phenols. The total phenolic content is determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent [30, 31]. Gallic acid was used to make the calibration curve (a standard phenol). A gallic acid standard solution in 80 percent ethanol (1mg/ml) was made, from which 20 to 320\u03bcl was taken in another test tube and the volume was increased to 1ml with 80 percent ethanol. Each test tube was then filled with 100\u03bcl of Folin-Ciocalteu (1 : 10) solution, followed by 300\u03bcl of 7.5 percent Na2CO3 solution. This combination was forcefully shaken. The test tubes were allowed to be heated for about 1 minute and then forcefully cooled. The test tubes are heated for about 1 minute, and after heating, cool it vigorously. Optical density (OD) was measured spectrophotometrically at 765nm after each test tube was diluted to 2ml with distilled water. OD was obtained after administering crude methanolic and subsequent fractions. Finally, using the OD of the standard phenol with a standard regression curve, the total quantity of phenolic was estimated (referred to gallic acid). The total phenolic content was calculated as \u03bcg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per milliliter of sample.\n2.5. Total Flavonoid Determination. Total flavonoid (TF) assay was prepared as previously designated with minor\nchanges [32, 33]. Stock solution of the rutin was prepared in the 80% of ethanol (1mg/ml). The volume of 1ml of dilute extract or standard solution of the rutin (20 to 100\u03bcg/ml) was placed in the test tube carefully; then, after 5 minutes, 150\u03bcl of NaNO2 (5%) and 150\u03bcl of the AlCl3 (10%) were added to it. The mixture was shaken strongly, and after 5 minutes, 1ml of 1M solution of NaOH was added to it; then, shake it carefully and after that dilute it to 2ml by adding distilled water. Then, the absorbance was recorded at 510nm with respect to the blank. The findings were determined using the rutin calibration curve (R2 = 0:999). The total flavonoid concentration was measured in rutin equivalents (RE) per milliliter of sample.\n2.6. Extraction of Crude Saponins. This procedure was performed by crushing 20 gm of sample plant with 20% ethanol (100ml) and allowed to stay in water bath at 55\u00b0C for 04 hours. Afterwards, filtration and extraction with 20% ethanol (200ml) were performed once again. After that, keep it in water bath for few minutes, resulting in volume drop to 40ml. This sample was poured into funnel and mixed the sample with 20ml diethyl ether with continuous shaking. The solvent layers including watery and diethyl ether layers would be separated. The n-butanol (60ml) was added to the aqueous layer, which was then separated using a separating funnel. A 5 percent brine (10ml) solution was used to wash the n-butanol extract. In a water bath, the final volume was concentrated, then transferred to a beaker. Hd.Sp was dried by placing 1.1 gm of the sample in an oven [32].\n2.7. Study of Phytochemical. Using the established protocols, a qualitative phytochemical investigation of plant extracts was accepted for the presence of glycosides, anthraquinones, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, and sterol [34, 35]. Plant extracts were hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid (HCl), followed by neutralization with sodium hydroxide, to identify glycosides (NaOH). The existence of red precipitates was determined by adding a few drops of the solution, Fehling\u2019s solution, to the preparation. Dragendorff\u2019s reagent was used to identify the phytochemicals or alkaloids. Similarly, samples were exposed to sterol and terpenoids after being treated with petroleum ether and then extracted with chloroform. After treating the chloroform layer with acetic anhydride and strong hydrochloric acid (HCl) in series, the presence of reddish brown terpenoids and the appearance of green to pink sterols were observed.\nRE\nTR AC\nTE D\nThe anthraquinones were identified by mixing the extract in one percent hydrochloric acid (HCl), with benzene, and finally combining with NH4OH. The development of violet, crimson, or pink tints indicated the existence of anthraquinones. The presence of saponin phytochemicals was then identified by the creation of bubbles in a beaker when diluted samples were vigorously shaken.\n2.8. Assay of Antiangiogenic Activity. The antiangiogenic activity of plant extracts and saponins was determined using\nthe chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) experiment [36]. The fertilised domestic chicken eggs were purchased from a hen merchant in Chakdara, Pakistan, and incubated in a humidified incubator (HYSC Korea (BI-81/150/250) for 4-5 days at 37\u00b0C, handling them 3 times per day. After the incubation process was finished, the 7-day old eggs were allowed to be examined under a light to detect and surround the embryo head. The yolk sacs were then separated from the shell membrane by puncturing a small hole in the narrow corner of eggs with an 18 gauge hypodermic needle and aspirating\nTable 2: Phytochemical ingredients in crude fraction of H. digitata.\nS. no Phytochemicals Observations Results\n1.

The embryo air sac shell was split using forceps, and the membrane around the air sac base was peeled away. A Thermanox cover slip was then carefully put on the membrane of CAM on the eighth day, and it was incubated with 10 different samples at concentration of 31.25-1000\u03bcg/ml. After that, the 33-gauge needle was used to inject acetone with methanol in 1 : 1 ratio into the embryo of chorioallantois after 3 days. The vessel number in CAM was counted after it was cut out of eggs. Under a microscope, the vessels were radially converted in direction of the centre and were checked. Each sample dose required at least twenty eggs. The following formula was used to calculate the percent increase and inhibition:"

            "text": "2.9.1. Plant Extract Preparation of A. tumefaciens Mixture. This bioassay was carried out through McLaughlin and Rogers\u2019 standard protocol [36]. A. strain B6 tumefaciens with tumor inducing plasmid was cultivated over night at 25\u00b0C on soybean casein digest agar (SCDA). Plant extract dilutions in the range from 31.25 to 1000 g/ml were synthesized in DMSO and filtered. The Agrobacterium culture is mixed with the serial dilution of the crude and subsequent fractions of the plant extract to form approximately 1108 colony forming units. The control was prepared in combination with 50 liters of DMSO with 450 liters purified water that was sterile; afterwards, 500 liters of A. tumefaciens culture of broth was added.\n2.9.2. Discs of Potato Preparation. Potatoes with red skinned were obtained from an active shop near Malakand Chakdara University in Pakistan. The potato discs of a 2mm height and an 8mm thickness were prepared with a sterile cork borer. These discs were then surface sterilized for 4 to 5 minutes and a 1 percent HgCl2 solution before they were washed with distilled water. Then, for 20 minutes, they were dried aseptically. By using sterile forceps, the discs were placed on 1.5 percent of autoclaved agar medium plates. At the end, 01 of plant extract-bacterium mixture was being injected into the upper shallow of each potato disc. The plates were parafilm sealed and was incubated at 28\u00b0C in the dim.

Vincristine at the rang of 31.25-1000 g/ml was used as a positive control in this assay. The test was done for 3 times, and the record was statistically examined [37].\n2.9.3. Anti-Agrobacterium In Vitro Assay. Assay of disc diffusion: a qualitative of partial-quantitative disc method was used to observe the plant material effect on development of Agrobacterium and thus on the tumor formation, as described earlier [38]. In the nutshell, test organisms were inoculation on the nutrient agar plates and were prepared aseptically in the laminar flow hood. With sterile forceps, 6mm diameter sterile paper discs with different amount of the extracts impregnated were deposited on membrane of the Petri dishes that were inoculated. Negative controls used were the blank discs drenched with solvents/DMSO, whereas positive controls used were ceftriaxone discs (Geltis, Shaigan Pharmaceuticals, containing 30 g medication). These plates were allowed to incubate for 24 hrs at 37 degrees Celsius, and areas of inhibition surrounding the bores were then measured.\n2.10. Brine Shrimp Cytotoxicity Assay. Following the standard protocol, the crude extracts and saponins of H. digitata were tested for their cytotoxicity against Artemia salina (brine shrimp eggs) [39].\n2.10.1. Hatching Procedure. The hatching of brine shrimp eggs is ideally in the sea salty water. In a narrow rectangular pliable dish measuring 22 \u00d7 32 cm, 38 gm of profitable salt mixture was dissolved in a doubled distilled H2O to produce an artificial sea water solution. A perforated mechanism was then used to separate the plastic dish into two halves. 50mg of eggs was scattered in the darkened section much larger and aluminum foil covered; however, the lesser compartmental area was remained wide to normal light for the newborn crosshatched brine shrimp larva. These were then allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0C for 2 days. When the larvae hatched after 48 hours, they were lured from the dark side with a lamp and then collected with a Pasteur pipette [10].\n2.11. Cells Viability MTT Assay. The NIH/3T3 cell line of mouse embryonic fibroblasts was maintained in DMEM media containing 10% FBS and antibiotic (50 units/ml penicillin and 50units/ml streptomycin) at 37\u00b0C in a humid environment containing 5% CO2. This test was used to assess cytotoxicity against cultured NIH/3T3 cells [40]. In 200\u03bcl media, NIH/3T3 cells were distributed into 96-well plates at an initial seeding density of 8.0-103 cells/well, then incubated for 24 hours. Later, the culture medium was withdrawn and replaced with a 200\u03bcl media containing successive dilutions of samples (0.0625\u20131mg/ml). Positive control cells were cultured with just the medium, and the cells were allowed to proliferate for an additional 24 hours. As a result, each well received 20\u03bcl of MTT solution (5mg/ml) in PBS. The media containing unreacted color was carefully removed after the cells had been incubated for 4 hours. The purple formazan crystals were then dissolved in 200 l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) each well, and the absorbance was measured at 570nm in a microplate\nTable 4: Various samples of antitumor activity of H. digitata.\nSample content Concentration (\u03bcg/ml)\nInhibition in average\n(mean \u00b1 SEM)\nInhibition percentage\n(mean \u00b1 SEM) IC50 (\u03bcg/ ml)\nHd.Cr\n1000 24:7 \u00b1 0:3 86:4 \u00b1 1:1\u2217\u2217\u2217\n195.7\n500 18:0 \u00b1 0:6 64:3 \u00b1 1:9\u2217\u2217\u2217 250 15:0 \u00b1 1:2 54:4 \u00b1 2:8\u2217\u2217\u2217 125 13:3 \u00b1 0:0 44:6 \u00b1 1:1\u2217\u2217\u2217 62.5 11:0 \u00b1 0:3 39:0 \u00b1 0:0\u2217\u2217\u2217\n31.25 10:0 \u00b1 0:6 33:5 \u00b1 1:9\u2217\u2217\u2217\nHd.Hex\n1000 20:0 \u00b1 0:4 62:3 \u00b1 1:7\u2217\u2217\u2217\n390.2\n500 17:3 \u00b1 0:5 53:4 \u00b1 1:9\u2217\u2217\u2217 250 13:7 \u00b1 1:2 41:2 \u00b1 1:1\u2217\u2217\u2217 125 12:0 \u00b1 0:3 35:7 \u00b1 2:8\u2217\u2217\u2217 62.5 11:5 \u00b1 0:9 33:5 \u00b1 1:1\u2217\u2217\u2217\n31.25 09:0 \u00b1 0:6 25:7 \u00b1 0:0\u2217\u2217\u2217\nHd.Chf\n1000 25:0 \u00b1 1:2 87:5 \u00b1 2:8\u2217\n25.5\n500 22:5 \u00b1 0:5 78:8 \u00b1 1:1\u2217\u2217 250 20:0 \u00b1 0:0 71:7 \u00b1 0:0\u2217\u2217\u2217 125 18:7 \u00b1 0:3 66:5 \u00b1 2:2\u2217\u2217 62.5 16:2 \u00b1 0:6 59:0 \u00b1 1:7\u2217\u2217\u2217\n31.25 14:7 \u00b1 0:6 51:0 \u00b1 1:9\u2217\u2217\u2217\nHd.EA\n1000 25:0 \u00b1 0:6 81:1 \u00b1 1:7\u2217\u2217\n60.3\n500 20:5 \u00b1 0:7 66:4 \u00b1 0:2\u2217\u2217\u2217 250 19:0 \u00b1 0:6 61:7 \u00b1 1:9\u2217\u2217\u2217 125 17:6 \u00b1 1:2 54:0 \u00b1 0:2\u2217\u2217\u2217 62.5 16:2 \u00b1 0:0 50:2 \u00b1 2:8\u2217\u2217\u2217\n32.25 14:4 \u00b1 0:2 44:4 \u00b1 1:8\u2217\u2217\u2217\nHd.Aq\n1000 14:0 \u00b1 0:2 46:2 \u00b1 0:4\u2217\u2217\u2217\n1110.7\n500 12:2 \u00b1 0:4 42:0 \u00b1 1:1\u2217\u2217\u2217 250 11:3 \u00b1 0:7 38:8 \u00b1 1:8\u2217\u2217\u2217 125 9:7 \u00b1 0:9 30:0 \u00b1 0:4\u2217\u2217\u2217 62.5 8:2 \u00b1 0:0 28:2 \u00b1 0:8\u2217\u2217\u2217\n31.25 5:3 \u00b1 0:5 17:9 \u00b1 0:1\u2217\u2217\u2217\nHd.Sp\n1000 28:2 \u00b1 0:8 92:7 \u00b1 0:0ns\n18.3\n500 25:7 \u00b1 0:1 82:3 \u00b1 1:9\u2217 250 23:0 \u00b1 0:0 77:6 \u00b1 1:2\u2217 125 19:5 \u00b1 0:3 62:9 \u00b1 1:9\u2217\u2217 62.5 17:1 \u00b1 0:9 55:2 \u00b1 0:0\u2217\u2217\u2217\n31.25 16:8 \u00b1 0:4 53:3 \u00b1 0:5\u2217\u2217\nPositive control was taken as vincristine sulfate having IC50value < 0:1 \u03bcg/ ml; \u2217p < 0:05, \u2217\u2217p < 0:01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0:001 Hd.Cr crude methanol extract, Hd.Hex fraction of n-hexane, Hd.Chf fraction of chloroform, Hd.EA fraction of ethyl acetate, Hd.Aq fraction of aqueous layer, Hd.Sp fractions of saponins. ns: nonsignificant.\nRE TR AC TE D spectrophotometer reader.

Data specify that chloroform (Hd.Cf), ethyl acetate (Hd.EA), and crude (Hd.Cr) displayed\nincreased phenolic content, i.e., 178:61 \u00b1 0:66, 220:44 \u00b1 0:82, and 98:52 \u00b1 1:50mg GAE/g of the dry material correspondingly. However, Hd.Cf, Hd.Cr, and Hd.EA displayed increased flavonoid contents, i.e., 132:43 \u00b1 1:10, 72:75 \u00b1 0:67, and 98:44 \u00b1 1:88mg RTE/g of the material, respectively. Due to the existence of conjugated dienes and hydroxyl group in structure of these compounds, they gave increased anticancer and antioxidant activity [41]. Flavonoids and phenolic contents in various plant fractions related to the antioxidant and anticancer activity are given below.\n3.2. Phytochemical Investigation. The results of the preliminary phytochemical analysis of the Hd.Cr are shown in Table 2. The tested sample of Hd.Cr was tested positive for the existence of the alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, terpenoids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, and saponins, as well as oils, but tested negative for sterols.\nTable 5: Concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of H. digitata crude extract and resultant fraction values against Artemia salina (brine shrimps) and their LC50 values.\nSamples Total treated Concentration dose (mg/ml) Killed nauplii\n(n = 3) Killed mean Percent cytotoxicity LC50 (mg/ml) I II III\nHd.Cr 30\n1000 18 22 17 19:00 \u00b1 0:58 64:1 \u00b1 1:5 262100 14 15 14 14:33 \u00b1 0:56 47:6 \u00b1 1:9\n10 10 12 14 11:33 \u00b1 0:52 37:4 \u00b1 1:3\nHd.Hx 30\n1000 17 18 19 18:00 \u00b1 0:04 60:2 \u00b1 0:4 630100 11 12 10 11:00 \u00b1 0:06 36:7 \u00b1 0:8\n10 07 08 07 07:33 \u00b1 0:58 24:4 \u00b1 1:9\nHd.Chf 30\n1000 22 24 24 23:31 \u00b1 0:56 77:4 \u00b1 1:7 51100 17 19 17 17:66 \u00b1 0:57 58:7 \u00b1 2:2\n10 12 13 14 13:00 \u00b1 0:20 43:5 \u00b1 0:7\nHd.EA 30\n1000 21 21 19 20:33 \u00b1 0:56 67:6 \u00b1 1:7 481100 11 13 11 11:67 \u00b1 0:54 38:7 \u00b1 1:5\n10 08 09 10 09:01 \u00b1 0:02 30:0 \u00b1 0:4\nHd.Aq 30\n1000 18 19 20 19:00 \u00b1 0:20 63:5 \u00b1 0:2 420100 12 13 14 13:00 \u00b1 0:04 43:1 \u00b1 0:4\n10 08 10 10 09:33 \u00b1 0:56 31:3 \u00b1 1:7\nHd.Sp 30\n1000 29 29 29 29:00 \u00b1 0:20 96:5 \u00b1 0:2 <0.01100 22 22 20 21:33 \u00b1 0:56 71:3 \u00b1 1:7\n10 17 17 18 17:67 \u00b1 0:54 58:7 \u00b1 1:5 Positive control (etoposide LD50 9.8).

Antiangiogenic Assay. Under normal circumstances, angiogenesis is controlled by a number of intrinsic angiostatic and angiogenic parameters [42]. Angiogenesis inhibitors are overwhelmed by angiogenesis promoters in\naberrant angiogenesis, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and chronic inflammation [43], resulting in improper cell proliferation and migration. Since the last 15 years, researchers have been trying to identify and characterize novel\nRE TR AC TE D\nantiangiogenic medicines from natural sources such as plants [44]. In this research work, Hd.Chf, Hd.Sp, Hd.EA, and Hd.Cr show maximum antiangiogenesis having 78:65 \u00b1 1:66, 76:98 \u00b1 1:03, 69:41 \u00b1 1:13, and 65:35 \u00b1 0:86 percentage inhibition at 1000\u03bcg/ml along with IC50 value of 28.63, 16.20, 86.73, and 460.51\u03bcg/ml, correspondingly. Standard drug was considered as dexamethasone with IC50 value of 11.66\u03bcg/ml which was shown in Table 3 and Figure 1. All constituent fractions displayed less significant but concentration dependent activity. Ph.Sp has been observed to have the strongest antiangiogenic effect, with an IC50 value of 16.20\u03bcg/ml, according to our findings. Likewise, saponins, such as convallamaroside from Convallaria majalis and polyphyllin D from Paris polyphylla, have been demonstrated to exhibit antiangiogenic properties in all phytochemicals [45, 46]. Similarly, the antiangiogenic potentials of crude extracts from Viscum album, Populus nigra, Chrysobalanus icaco, Cassia garrettiana, and Agaricus blazei were determined. Antiangiogenic activities of isolated compounds such as torilin from Torilis japonica, shikonin from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, resveratrol from grapes, deoxypodophyllo toxin from Pulsatilla koreana, genistein from ginseng, isoliquiritin from licorice, and epigallocatechin gallate from green tea have been explained in both in vitro and in vivo study. In the GC-MS evaluation, we reported a total of 65 compounds previously [25] in which 17 were reported as anticancer drug studied from literature (Figure 2).\n3.4. Potato Disc Antitumor Bioassay. The potato disc antitumor bioassay was carried out for the several samples of H. digitata discovered antitumor response in a dosedependent manner (Table 4). In all the experimental samples, saponins displayed excellent antimalignant activity, i.e., 92:7 \u00b1 0:0, 82:3 \u00b1 1:9, 77:6 \u00b1 1:2, 62:9 \u00b1 1:9, 55:2 \u00b1 0:0, and 53:3 \u00b1 0:5% at different concentrations of 1000 to 31.25\u03bcg/ml, respectively, with IC50 data of 18.3\u03bcg/ml. Other increased activity was given by fraction of chloroform, i.e., 87:5 \u00b1 2:8, 78:8 \u00b1 1:1, 71:7 \u00b1 0:0, 66:5 \u00b1 2:2, 59:0 \u00b1 1:7, and 51:0 \u00b1 1:9% at 1000-31.25\u03bcg/ml accordingly with the IC50 value of 25.5\u03bcg/ml. Also, at the concentration of 1000\u03bcg/ ml, the Hd.Cr, Hd.Hex, Hd.EA, and Hd.Aq exhibited 86:4 \u00b1 1:1, 62:3 \u00b1 1:7, 81:1 \u00b1 1:7, and 46:2 \u00b1 0:4% antitumor activity accordingly.\n3.5. Cytotoxicity Assay as Brine Shrimp. As shown in Table 5, the cytotoxic properties of crude methanolic containing saponins and their resulting fractions of H. digitata were evaluated using etoposide as a reference cytotoxic agent (LC50 9.8mg/ml). The crude methanolic extract induced 64:1 \u00b1 1:5, 47:6 \u00b1 1:9, and 37:4 \u00b1 1:3 percent cytotoxicity and the standard deviation, respectively, at concentrations of 10-1000 ppm or mg/ml, with LC50 values of 262.0mg/ ml. The n-hexane fraction had 60:2 \u00b1 0:4, 36:7 \u00b1 0:8, and 24:4 \u00b1 1:9 effects with an LC50 value of 630mg/ml, whereas the chloroform fraction had 77:4 \u00b1 1:7, 58:7 \u00b1 2:2, and 43:5 \u00b1 0:7 responses with an LC50 value of 51.0mg/ml. Ethyl acetate fraction shows 67:6 \u00b1 1:7, 38:7 \u00b1 1:5, and 30:0 \u00b1 0:4 giving the LC50 value of 481.0mg/ml. Aqueous fraction showed 63:5 \u00b1 0:2, 43:1 \u00b1 0:4, and 31:3 \u00b1 1:7 along with 420.0mg/ml\nas LC50. Saponin fraction presented considerable cytotoxicity of 96:5 \u00b1 0:2, 71:3 \u00b1 1:7, and 58:7 \u00b1 1:5 with the minimum value of 0.01mg/ml as LC50.\n3.6. MTT Cell Viability Assay. The hysterical and aberrant proliferation of cells that characterized cancer is present in over a hundred clinical disorders [47, 48]. Cell adherence, proteolysis, and cell migration have been used to elucidate the link between tumor and tumor-induced angiogenesis. There are strong signs that tumor cells have the potential to assault nearby tissue and induce the production of new capillaries from endothelial cells, resulting in cancer development and dissemination. As a result, the antitumor potential of a particular sample may also correspond to its antiangiogenic potential [49]. Furthermore, the NIH/3T3 cell line was chosen for the viability assay because several cell lines, including the NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast, chicken embryo fibroblasts, HeLa cell line, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and others, have been identified as sensitive to leukaemia virus proliferation and sarcoma virus focus formation and transfection that has been analyzed previously using the immunofluorescence parameters [50, 51].\nThe creation of affordable and broad-spectrum cytotoxic medications is the true problem for researchers because of diverse characteristics of cancer. Anticancer medications and radiation that causes DNA alterations in actively proliferating cells were thought to preferentially kill cancer cells while having only a minor impact on healthy cells. Unfortunately, these drugs are effective against certain forms of cancer but have been linked to harmful effects on normal cells and have also been linked to serious side effects [52]. As a result, it is critical to look for novel anticancer medications that comes from both synthetic and natural sources. Brine shrimp lethality bioassays and antitumor are quick and low-cost tools for determining the cytotoxicity of plant extracts, other isolated chemicals, and synthesized compounds in order to create novel anticancer medications for disease treatment and cure [53]. The percent cytotoxicity of different fractions and saponins in an ascending order is given as Hd.EA>Hd.Sp>Ph.Chf>Hd.Cr>Hd.Hx>Ph.Aq as shown in Table 6."

In vitro investigations showed that the samples were ineffective against A. tumefaciens, indicating that this is a useful antitumor assay for H. digitata. Similarly, research into the separation and purification of new anticancer components might reveal the precise potentials of plants for cancer treatment. Our findings on the fractions and saponins\u2019 cytotoxic potentials might provide scientific support for ethnomedicinal usage of this type of plant."
