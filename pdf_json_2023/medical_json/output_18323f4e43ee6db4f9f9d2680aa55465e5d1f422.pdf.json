To support biological activities and achieve an efficient therapeutic solution for enabling neuronal regeneration, the molecular composition, structure, bioactive cues, fibrous architecture and dynamic nature of the native neural extracellular matrix (ECM) supramolecular landscape can be emulated by the self-assembled ECM-mimetic bioactive nanoarchitectures.3\u20136\nRecently, the rational design of supramolecular nanostructures together with tissue engineering efforts have paved the way for the development of neural ECM-mimetic supramolecular polymeric biomaterials, enlisted with biophysical, biochemical, mechanical and structural features to modulate the local lesion microenvironment, ultimately resulting in the development of biofunctional neural tissues.7\u201310 To date, a variety of methods have been employed to bioengineer relevant \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

While the biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-cytotoxicity, and wide and ready availability of natural-origin polymers encourage their use,18,19 ECM fibrous proteins, namely fibronectin and laminin (LAM), are key components to enhance cell\u2013ECM communication and repair tissue structure and function.20,21 However, ECM proteins entail high costs, batch-to-batch variability, risk of pathogenic contamination and are difficult to purify when obtained from mammalian-derived tissues, poor processability, and limited stability and availability, which extensively limit their use.22,23\nPeptide amphiphiles (PAs) have shown to be very appealing alternatives to fibrous ECM proteins in designing tunable bioactive ECM-like nanostructures due to their key structural and biofunctional features. Those include ease of synthesis and functionality, inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, high chemical diversity and versatility, increased stability, high surface density of bioactive epitopes, and self-assembling capability into one-dimensional (1D) fibrous nanostructures in aqueous medium. As such, the PAs emulate the intrinsic fibrillar topography, architecture and signalling cues of the neural ECM.24 Furthermore, their peptide sequence can be rationally designed and customized to impart any biofunctionality to enable desired cellular responses.6,25 In the literature one can find several studies that highlight the bottom-up nanofabrication of tunable PA-derived supramolecular matrices to control cell-biomaterial interactions for multiple tissue engineering strategies,26,27 including nerve tissue regeneration.28,29\nThe layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technology has emerged as a simple, cost-effective, robust, and highly versatile nanofabrication technique to functionalize virtually any type of surface and build-up tunable ECM-mimetic multicomponent nanostructures by resorting to a repertoire of building blocks exhibiting complementary interactions.12,30,31 The fact that the LbL assembly process occurs under mild conditions in aqueous media enables the incorporation of biomolecules in the multilayered films, including polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, or combinations thereof, without losing their biological activity, thus being very appealing to assemble biofunctional ECM-mimetic nanostructures.12,13,30,31\nHerein, we report the electrostatic-driven supramolecular immobilization of LAM-derived isoleucine\u2013lysine\u2013valine\u2013 alanine\u2013valine (IKVAV)-containing self-assembling PA on multilayered nanofilms encompassing oppositely charged biocompatible polymers to recreate the native neural ECM. High-molecular-weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid (HA) has been selected as an ingredient of the multilayered nanofilm owing to its ubiquitous presence in the native ECMs of many tissues and organs, including in the neural ECM, and key role in the regulation of neuronal processes, such as cell adhesion, migration and mor-\nphological maturation. In addition, it has proven biocompatibility and biodegradability, non-cytotoxicity, and non-immunogenic properties.32 As such, anionic HA has been LbL assembled with the cationic biopolymer poly(L-lysine) (PLL), widely used in in vitro studies as a standard substrate coating, into soft biomimetic multilayered thin films to modulate cell functions.19,33,34 However, their use for enabling bioinstructive ECM-like matrices to recapitulate the nanofiber architecture and biofunctionality of the native neural ECM has not yet been reported.\nIn this work, a straightforward methodology is proposed for the supramolecular presentation of self-assembling IKVAV-PA on soft PLL/HA multilayered nanofilms aiming to impart the nanocoatings with a nanofibrillar topography and biofunctional cues, reminiscent of the native neural ECM, to stimulate neurite outgrowth."

Briefly, Au-coated glass substrates were firstly cleaned following the same procedure as reported for the QCM-D sensors.

The tissue was then dissociated in NBM using a pipette and cells were plated onto previously UV sterilized (30 min) Au-functionalized substrates at a density of 9 \u00d7 104 viable cells per cm2 (trypan blue assay). Bare Au substrates were used as blank controls. Cells were plated in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL in NBM supplemented with 2% (v/v) serum-free B27, L-glutamine (0.5 mM), glutamate (0.025 mM) and gentamycin (50 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. After that, 0.5 mL of complete medium was added per sample and cultured for 4 days.\nPrimary neuronal cortical cells\u2019 viability\nCell viability was assessed by Calcein and PI staining, using image-specific black 24 well plates with flat and clear bottom (Ibidi, Germany). Cells cultured in the Au substrates were incubated with 4 \u03bcM Calcein for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Counterstaining with 3 \u03bcM PI was performed for another 10 min in the same conditions. Thereafter, staining media was replaced by phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Au substrates were turned upside down into each well. Fluorescence (Calcein: \u03bbex = 494, \u03bbem = 517 and PI: \u03bbex = 536, \u03bbem = 617) was analyzed in a microplate reader (SynergyMx, Biotek, VT, USA). Bare Au substrates were used as fluorescence controls.

HMW HA was chosen due to its higher viscosity, stronger hydrogen bonding-driven intermolecular association between HA chains, as well as faster exponential growth of PLL/HA multilayered films, thus leading to thicker, more viscoelastic, and stable films than their counterparts built with medium- and, mainly, low-molecular-weight HA.38 Moreover, it better emulates the native neural ECM and plays a vital role in regulating neuronal cell functions.32\nBoth PAs comprise a hydrophobic lauryl alkyl tail, which drives self-assembly and formation of peptide conformations, a short \u03b2-sheet sequence (VVAG) that promotes intermolecular hydrogen bonding,26,39 and a hydrophilic peptide headgroup, composed by lysine amino acid residues (KK), to enhance the solubility of the PAs in aqueous media. The bioactive peptide also denotes a LAM-derived IKVAV sequence attached to the headgroup to enhance neuronal cell growth.6,35,39 The amphiphilic peptides were synthesized by standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis method, characterized by LC-MS and purified by HPLC (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI\u2020).\nThe analysis of the conformational arrangements of the PA molecules upon co-assembly with oppositely charged HA was assessed by spectroscopic techniques. The CD spectrum of HA revealed a negative band at 210 nm (Fig. 1D), assigned to the n\u2013\u03c0* transitions of the N-acetylglucosamine chromophore.40 The individual PAs denoted a broad negative band in the far UV region (\u223c197 nm), characteristic of a major contribution of the disordered random coil conformation to the final secondary structure.41\nThe co-assembly of the cationic K2PA\u2013IKVAV with the oppositely charged HA revealed the formation of an ordered \u03b2-sheet structure denoting a negative minimum at \u223c218 nm and a positive maximum at \u223c200 nm. On the other hand, the HA/ K2PA system revealed a weak negative band at \u223c204 nm, suggesting the presence of some contribution of \u03b2-sheet secondary structure. Noteworthy, the HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV coassembled system showed a slight redshift from the typical canonical \u03b2-sheet band positions, which can be due to the presence of twists along the long axis of the fibers.42 The slight blueshift in the negative band of the HA/K2PA supramolecular system can suggest changes in intermolecular interactions that destabilize the \u03b2-sheet conformation.43 It has been reported that peptide sequences containing lysine amino acid tend to disrupt the effective packing of \u03b2-sheets due to electrostatic repulsion, while those exhibiting valine or isoleucine denote higher propensity to form \u03b2-sheet structures.44,45 The secondary structure of the individual PAs and HA/PA co-assemblies was predicted and quantified as previously described (Fig. S3, ESI\u2020).46 It was found that, upon the co-assembly with HA, the PA\u2019s random coil content was lowered (44.2% for HA/ K2PA and 43.1% for HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV), while the \u03b2-sheet and \u03b1-helix conformations (32.9 and 7.2% for HA/K2PA and 42.2 and 6.6% for HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV, respectively) prevailed.\nATR-FTIR measurements complemented the CD analysis on the molecular scale structure of the co-assemblies based on\nthe analysis of the amide I region (Fig. 1E, highlighted in grey), primarily associated with the stretching vibrations of the peptide carbonyl groups.47 The individual spectra of both individual K2PA and K2PA\u2013IKVAV molecules showcased a major strong and sharp peak at \u223c1627 and 1623 cm\u22121, respectively, indicative of the presence of a \u03b2-sheet secondary structure (Fig. 1E),48,49 as well as a minor band at \u223c1675 and \u223c1677 cm\u22121, assigned to lysine side chains.50 The absence of a band at \u223c1695 cm\u22121, characteristic of antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structures,51 suggests that the peptides adopt a \u03b2-sheet secondary structure with a parallel orientation. The band at \u223c1540 cm\u22121, which was also observed on the spectra of HA and HA/PA co-assemblies, is assigned to the amide II band, mainly to N\u2013H bending but also to C\u2013N stretching.52\nThe HA/K2PA and HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV mixtures revealed broader absorption bands at \u223c1625 cm\u22121, which suggest an increase of the hydrogen bonding \u03b2-sheet network. The ATR-FTIR spectrum of HA showed peaks in the range between 950\u20131200 cm\u22121, attributed to the typical skeletal vibrations of the saccharide units (asymmetric C\u2013O\u2013C stretching vibration),52 and at \u223c1610 cm\u22121 and 1415 cm\u22121, assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the carboxylate anion (C\u2013O stretching vibration).\nTo obtain further insights on the molecular arrangement of the individual HA and PAs, and co-assembled systems, we resorted to powder wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) (Fig. 1F). As expected, the weak, broad and small number of diffraction peaks observed for HA and PA molecules reveal their amorphous and disordered structure. On the other hand, the HA/K2PA and HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV co-assembled systems displayed an intense and sharp Bragg peak at 15.3\u00b0 (d-spacing of 5.78 \u00c5). This peak is indicative of the formation of closed packed lauryl alkyl tails, which are responsible for the hydrophobic core formation within the \u03b2-sheet nanofiber networks.53 Noteworthy, the HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV co-assembled system denoted a Bragg peak at 18.6\u00b0 (d-spacing of 4.75 \u00c5), which was not observed in the case of the HA/K2PA system. This signal indicates crystalline ordering of the molecules in a \u03b2-sheet arrangement assigned to the \u03b2-sheet inter-strand spacing,6,54 suggesting a higher degree of \u03b2-sheet packing when compared with the HA/K2PA co-assembly.\nThe diffraction patterns corroborate the CD and ATR-FTIR findings, revealing the formation of ordered \u03b2-sheet secondary structures for both HA/K2PA and HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV co-assembled supramolecular systems, the latter system denoting a higher extent of \u03b2-sheet structure.\nThe morphology of the individual PAs and co-assembled supramolecular systems was investigated by TEM (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4, ESI\u2020). The individual PAs self-assembled into supramolecular nanofibers in solution with 6.2 \u00b1 1.2 nm and 17.2 \u00b1 3.5 nm in width, for K2PA\u2013IKVAV (Fig. S4A, ESI\u2020) and K2PA (Fig. S4B, ESI\u2020), respectively. However, while K2PA\u2013IKVAV revealed the formation of long, thin, high-aspect-ratio cylindrical nanofibers with a few twisted nanofibers (red arrows in Fig. S4A, ESI\u2020), the shorter K2PA denoted nanotape-like structures (Fig. S4B, ESI\u2020).

This result can be explained by the interaction between the fibers exhibiting hydrophobic amino acids of the IKVAV epitope sequence, promoting aggregation.41 On the other hand, the HA/K2PA supramolecular system self-assembled into narrower nanobelt-like structures with 7.2 \u00b1 1.6 nm in width (Fig. S4D, ESI\u2020). These results corroborate the CD, ATR-FTIR and WAXS data once supramolecular nanofiber networks are the result of \u03b2-sheet structures.\nReal-time monitoring of the build-up of (PLL/HA)5/PAs supramolecular multilayered thin films\nPrior to the build-up of the PA-functionalized biopolymerbased multilayered nanoassemblies, the net electrical charge of the freshly prepared 0.5 mg mL\u22121 PLL, HA, K2PA and K2PA\u2013\nIKVAV aqueous solutions at pH 7.4 (10 mM TRIS-HCl) was assessed by zeta (\u03b6)-potential. The \u03b6-potential measurements revealed the cationic nature of PLL (+20.9 \u00b1 0.5 mV), K2PA (+35.0 \u00b1 1.8 mV) and K2PA\u2013IKVAV (+46.2 \u00b1 0.6 mV), and the anionic nature of HA (\u221232.7 \u00b1 0.6 mV) aqueous solutions. Accordingly, we studied the possible build-up of electrostaticdriven soft PLL/HA multilayered thin films and their further functionalization with an outer layer of oppositely charged PAs (Fig. 3A) onto Au-coated quartz crystal sensors by QCM-D (Fig. 3B). This technique enable us to detect minute changes in the hydrodynamic mass (ng cm\u22122) due to changes in the resonance frequency of the quartz crystal sensor, as well as measure the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layers via the energy dissipated in the mechanical oscillation of the quartz sensors.55,56 Similar biopolymeric multilayered thin films, encompassing an extra PLL layer, i.e., (PLL/HA)5/PLL films, were also assembled to understand the influence of the outer PLL layer in the adsorption of the PAs.\nAs shown in the Fig. 3B, the sequential decrease in the normalized frequency shift at the 7th overtone (\u0394f7/7) as a function of time after the adsorption of each layered material indicates that both PLL and HA adsorbed successfully onto the Auplated quartz crystal surface, as well as the successful interaction and stable LbL growth of the five PLL/HA bilayered film. However, the decrease in the \u0394f7/7 right after the adsorption of each HA layer experienced an overshoot, i.e., an increase towards more positive values, which means a decrease in the adsorbed mass. Such behaviour is assigned to the diffusion of free PLL chains \u201cout\u201d of the film (i.e., deswelling) and their complexation by the HA chains.57\u201359 On the other hand, the increase and decrease of \u0394D7/7 after the adsorption of the PLL and HA layers, respectively, confirm the swelling and the deswelling behaviour of the soft and viscoelastic polymeric film. Moreover, the rinsing steps in-between the deposition of PLL and HA produced negligible changes in both \u0394f7/7 and \u0394D7/7, thus revealing the strong association between the assembled\nFig. 2 Representative TEM micrographs of the nanofibrous structure formed by (A) K2PA\u2013IKVAV, (B) K2PA, (C) HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV, and (D) HA/ K2PA systems (1:1 v/v ratio) at 0.2 mg mL \u22121.

The build-up and characterization of PLL/HA multilayered thin films is well described in the literature.58,60 However, to the best of our knowledge, the adsorption of PA upon the precursor PLL/HA multilayered thin film has not been explored to date.\nProtein adsorption can be sensed by QCM-D not only by the decrease of the frequency shift but also by the increase of the energy dissipation, which is also a typical behaviour of soft and hydrated polymeric films.61 In this work, the flushing of a positively charged K2PA\u2013IKVAV aqueous solution onto the hydrophilic HA-ended multilayered film led to a significant decrease in the \u0394f7/7 by 2-fold (\u223c\u2212150 Hz) when compared to the adsorption of the non-bioactive PA. Such behaviour reveals that the positively charged bioactive PA adsorbed strongly onto the underlying negatively charged HA layer when compared to the non-bioactive counterpart. On the other hand, an exponential increase in \u0394D7/7 was observed upon the adsorption of the bioactive PA, which reveals the soft and viscoelastic nature of the bioactive PA layer. A similar behaviour has been reported for the adsorption of other biomolecules, such as bovine serum albumin, fibrinogen, and \u03b3-globulin on polymeric layers adsorbed onto Au-coated quartz sensors, as monitored by the QCM-D apparatus.61,62 Moreover, we hypothesize that the higher \u0394D7/7 values obtained after the deposition of the K2PA\u2013 IKVAV layer showcase its higher ability to bind and present water molecules on the outer film surface, i.e., form a surface hydration shell after the self-assembly of the PA nanofibers driven by charge neutralization, indicating that the film is not rigid showing damping properties. The adsorption of the positively charged K2PA onto similar HA-ended film also induced a decrease in the \u0394f7/7, i.e., increase in the adsorbed mass, and increase in the \u0394D7/7, i.e., increase in the viscoelasticity but in much lower extent. This behaviour correlates well with the CD and WAXS data in which a higher degree of crystalline ordering in a \u03b2-sheet arrangement was found for the HA/K2PA\u2013IKVAV coassembled system when compared to the HA/K2PA counterpart, thus meaning that a higher extent of entangled nanofiber networks was formed by the former. Moreover, the rinsing step after the adsorption of either K2PA or K2PA\u2013IKVAV led to negligible changes in the \u0394f7/7, thus revealing the irreversible nature of the adsorption process.\nTo understand the role of attractive electrostatic interactions on the successful deposition of the PAs, the adsorption of K2PA\u2013IKVAV was attempted onto similarly positively charged PLL-ended multilayered films (Fig. S5, ESI\u2020). Although both PLL- and HA-ended films present similar \u0394D7/7 values after the adsorption of K2PA\u2013IKVAV, and thus similar viscoelastic properties, the decrease in the PLL-ending films was lower (\u223c\u221275 Hz) than the one observed for its adsorption onto HAended films (\u223c\u2212150 Hz). Such behaviour reveals that attractive electrostatic forces are not the sole interactions contributing to the build-up and stabilization of the supramolecular multilayered films. In fact, the hydrophobic collapse of the PA aliphatic chains, the hydrogen bonding interactions among the \u03b2-sheet forming peptide sequence, and the electrostatic repul-\nsion between the charged lysine amino acid residues also play important roles on the assembly and stabilization of PAs.49,63 Moreover, the stability of the (PLL/HA)5/K2PA\u2013IKVAV multilayered film was assessed by exposure to cell culture medium for 4 days (in vitro assays\u2019 culture time). The injection of cell culture medium led to a continuous decrease of \u0394f7/7 and increase of \u0394D7/7, thus suggesting the establishment of supramolecular interactions between the proteins present in the growth medium and the previously adsorbed K2PA\u2013IKVAV molecules and the increase in the viscoelastic properties of the assembled film, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020). Therefore, the native nanofilm showed to be stable in culture medium conditions for at least 4 days.\nMorphologic characterization of the nanostructured supramolecular multilayered thin films\nThe surface morphological features, i.e., the surface roughness and morphology of the nanostructured (PLL/HA)5 multilayered thin films prior to and following the adsorption of the bioactive PA were evaluated by AFM. Fig. 4 displays the representative 2D topographical and deflection images of the bare Au, and (PLL/HA)5 and (PLL/HA)5/K2PA\u2013IKVAV multilayered thin films assembled onto the Au substrate in which one could denote clear morphological and structural differences (Fig. 4A). The smooth surface topography exhibited by the bare Au surface revealed the presence of pinholes, i.e., surface defects which were covered after the assembly of five PLL/HA bilayers, leading to the formation of rougher biopolymeric islet-like structures over the surface, similarly to other studied biopolymeric systems.64 The subsequent adsorption of K2PA\u2013 IKVAV on top of the (PLL/HA)5 multilayered thin film led to the formation of randomly oriented 1D nanofibrous-like networks (Fig. 4A and Fig. S7, ESI\u2020), uniformly distributed over the polymeric film surface, similar to the fibrillar surface morphology of collagen/alginate films.65 Such behaviour is corroborated by the sequential increase in the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq, Fig. 4B) and average height (Ra, Fig. 4C). The AFM data correlates well with the previous results once negatively charged HA triggered the self-assembly of positively charged PA molecules via charge neutralization and led to the formation of nanofiber networks. Although both PAs denote an intrinsic capacity to fold into an organized \u03b2-sheet secondary structure upon interaction with HA, it is noteworthy that the bioactive PA displays the LAM-derived IKVAV pentapeptide sequence, which is relevant to instruct cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and neurite outgrowth.21 As such, we hypothesized that the nanostructured supramolecular multilayered thin films herein proposed could simultaneously provide an enhanced ECM-mimetic nanofibrillar-like environment and high density of bioactive cues for controlling neuronal growth.\nIn vitro assays of supramolecular multilayered thin films\nThe in vitro biological performance of biomaterial scaffolds using primary cells provides crucial context for the applicability of the in vitro data assays by more accurately mimicking\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Biomater.

Herein, primary cortical neuronal cells were used to infer about the neuro-compatibility of the biopolymeric nanostructured multilayer thin films functionalized with either bioactive or non-bioactive PAs by means of cell adhesion and viability, morphology, and neurite outgrowth studies.\nPrimary cortical neuronal cells\u2019 adhesion and viability\nThe process of cell adhesion is a source of specific cues involved in signal transduction, which influences cytoskeletal dynamics, gene expression and growth. As such, it is an important parameter to meet when designing biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.67 To quantitatively evaluate the cellular adhesion, primary cortical neurons were cultured for 4 days in vitro on top of the different substrate formulations, and further stained with a nuclear marker. As shown in Fig. 5A, all tested LbL formulations improved the adhesion of neuronal cells when compared to the bare Au substrate. Moreover, despite no significant differences were observed between distinct formulations, the K2PA\u2013IKVAV-ended surfaces showed an increased ability to promote neuronal cell adhesion.\nThe cellular viability was also assessed after 4 days of culture in vitro via a live/dead assay. Consistent with the results of the cell adhesion studies, K2PA\u2013IKVAV-ended multilayered films showed the best cell response in terms of primary neurons viability. However, only the Au/(PLL/HA)5/ K2PA\u2013IKVAV film showed a significant increase in the fluorescence of live cells when compared to the other conditions (Fig. 5B). Concomitantly, this condition also showed the lower values for cell death (Fig. 5C).

This result agrees with the findings reported in the literature where positively charged VEGF achieved higher surface concentration when adsorbed on a HA-ending film (1.5 ng cm\u22122) when compared to its adsorption on PLL-ending films (0.72 ng cm\u22122).68 Moreover, the higher density of IKVAV epitopes presented to the cells by PA nanofibers when compared to either LAM or IKVAV soluble peptide has been reported as a key factor for the preferential differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons instead of glial cells.69 These results highlight the importance of the availability of the LAM-derived IKVAV epitope in the multilayered film to enhance both the neuronal cell attachment via selective integrin binding and the cell viability.\nPrimary cortical neuronal morphology\nFollowing up the differences observed on neuronal viability for cells cultured on the various multilayered nanofilms, distinct morphology was also noticed among the different film formulations. Immunostaining for \u03b23-tubulin and F-actin allowed the evaluation of the cell morphology according to distinct neuronal developmental stages, as described by Banker.70 The\nbioactive nanostructured supramolecular multilayered nanofilms, i.e., Au/(PLL/HA)5/K2PA\u2013IKVAV enhanced the overall neuronal morphology, in which cells displayed a polarized morphology and elongated processes, corresponding to the advanced stage of neuronal development. Such behavior allowed neurons to contact neighboring cells and establish early neuronal networks (Fig. 6).\nContrarily, on the PA-free Au/(PLL/HA)5 and non-bioactive Au/(PLL/HA)5/K2PA multilayered films just a few sprouting neurites were visible and all were identical to one another, corresponding to the early-stage of neuronal development.70 Both multilayered thin films seem to be insufficient to promote cell polarization and cellular network connection to the same extent to the one observed on the multilayered nanofilms having the bioactive PA. Moreover, for all conditions, the cationic PLL-ended film proved to be disadvantageous for the development of neurites, even in the presence of the adsorbed bioactive peptide K2PA\u2013IKVAV, denoting few neurites and the absence of cell polarization (Fig. S8, ESI\u2020). In particular, the Au/(PLL/HA)5/PLL/K2PA supramolecular multilayered thin film promoted the formation of neuronal clusters, suggesting greater cell\u2013cell interaction over cell\u2013matrix adhesion. This behavior implies that the cells do not properly anchor to the matrix, generating cellular clustering that compromises their viability and maturation.\nFig. 6 Morphology of primary neuronal cortical cells at 4 days of in vitro culture on uncoated and LbL coated Au surfaces.

The results revealed that primary neuronal cortical cells cultured on Au/(PLL/HA)5/K2PA\u2013IKVAV substrates developed significantly more neurites than the neurons cultured on top of all the other biopolymeric multilayered nanofilms and the bare Au substrate (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, the biopolymeric multilayered thin films having PLL as the outer layer, i.e., Au/(PLL/ HA)5/PLL stands out for showcasing the lowest number of neurites, which correlates with the observed lower viability and higher mortality.\nThe extension of the developed neurites was also measured. Apart from the Au/(PLL/HA)5/PLL nanofilm which demonstrated a significantly lower ability to promote neurite extension, the cells cultured on top of either bioactive or non-bioactive PA-functionalized multilayered nanofilms achieved neurite lengths in the range of \u223c107\u2013158 \u00b5m (Fig. 7B). The HA-ended multilayered nanofilms functionalized with either the non-bioactive K2PA or bioactive K2PA\u2013 IKVAV outer layers achieved neurite lengths of 154 \u00b1 82 \u03bcm and 158 \u00b1 77 \u03bcm, respectively. We hypothesize that the significant neurite outgrowth observed for the Au/(PLL/HA)5/ K2PA\u2013IKVAV nanofilm is assigned to the denser presentation of the bioactive LAM-derived IKVAV motif on top of the (PLL/ HA)5 film, promoted by the interaction with HA. Overall, the results showed that the (PLL/HA)5/K2PA\u2013IKVAV supramolecular nanofilms enhanced the neuronal cell network by significantly improving the neurite outgrowth, which corroborated the increased cell viability and development of neuronal morphology."

            "text": "We have successfully demonstrated the electrostatic-driven supramolecular immobilization of LAM-derived IKVAV-containing PA on biocompatible PLL/HA nanostructured multilayered films for instructing neuronal cell functions. This straightforward methodology enabled the formation of neural ECM-mimetic supramolecular nanofiber matrices driven by charge neutralization and exhibiting a high-epitope density, which enhanced the cell viability and stimulated neurite outgrowth.\nWe anticipate that this highly versatile bottom-up approach could be used to coat virtually any kind of surfaces, including implantable biomaterials, and be extended to other material combinations to improve the biological interactions with any cell type and modulate cell functions. In addition, it could enable bioengineering more robust neural ECM-mimetic scaffolds to stimulate specific cell-signaling pathways. Those include the development of self-standing 2D multilayered membranes and 3D bioarchitectures which can integrate a wide repertoire of molecular building blocks, including multiple bioactive molecules, and exhibit (multi)functional properties to trigger a desired cell response. Such biomaterialbased devices, which can be used as drug/therapeutic carriers, bioactive networks, or cell seeding scaffolds, could represent advanced therapeutic strategies to boost the regeneration in vivo, potentially opening new avenues in neural tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."
