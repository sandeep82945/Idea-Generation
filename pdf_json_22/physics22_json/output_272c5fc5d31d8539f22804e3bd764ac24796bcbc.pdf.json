    "abstractText": "A numerical study was performed to analyze the impact of the combination of several factors on heat transfer rate, flow behavior, and entropy generation in a hybrid nanofluid occupying a porous trapezoid enclosure containing a rotating inner tube. The governing equations were discretized and solved using the Finite Element Method using Comsol multiphysics. The effects of the Darcy and Hartman number, nanoparticle volume fraction (from 0 to 6%), the utilization of various zigzag patterns of the hot wall, and the rotation speed of the inner tube (\u03a9 = 100. 250 and 500) are illustrated and discussed in this work. The outputs reveal that flow intensity has an inverse relationship with Hartman number and a direct relationship with the Darcy number and the velocity of the inner tube, especially at high numbers of undulations of the zigzag hot wall (N = 4); also, intensification of heat transfer occurs with increasing nanoparticle volume fraction, Darcy number and velocity of the inner tube. In addition, entropy generation is strongly affected by the mentioned factors, where increasing the nanoparticle concentration augments the thermal entropy generation and reduces the friction entropy generation; furthermore, the same influence can be obtained by increasing the Hartman number or decreasing the Darcy number. However, the lowest entropy generation was found for the case of \u00d8 = 0, Ha = 0 and Da = 0.01.",

            "text": "Convective heat transfer and entropy generation have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years, because they are relevant for several engineering applications, such as\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12121974 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974 2 of 23\nchemical engineering processes and lubrication, as well as in the design of solar collectors, heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, and cooling electronic chips [1,2], in addition to many other domains. For instance, recently, carbon nanoparticles such as graphene, graphite, and other metals like magnesium and molybdenum have become the best choice for storing hydrogen, with these compounds having immense energy storage capacity and high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation rates [3]. Many techniques have been utilized to assist heat distribution in the fluid, such as the addition of highly thermally conductive nanoparticles (ordinary/hybrid compounds), metal foam, rotating cylinders inside the enclosures [4\u20137], among others. Thus, scientists are seriously seeking to enhance heat transfer performance; however, regardless of the importance of heat transmission by conduction or radiation, heat transfer by convection has attracted the greatest attention. Many previous works have taken nanofluid mixed convection as their subject. Selimefendigil and \u00d6ztop [7] studied mixed convection numerically in a lid-driven trapezoidal enclosure filled with Al2O3\u2013water nanofluid under the effect of an external magnetic field. The upper and bottom walls are assumed to be at cold and hot temperatures, respectively; while the two side walls are insulated, the upper wall slides horizontally. The authors mentioned that the mean Nusselt number increases with increasing Richardson number, magnetic force, and solid element volume fraction. Chamkha et al. [8] carried out a numerical study to elucidate the effect of the Darcy number on heat transfer in a square cavity with a rotating inner cylinder. The results revealed that the heat transfer was better when the angular velocity of the cylinder was higher. Additionally, the maximum enhancement in heat transfer was obtained when Darcy number was lower. Roslan et al. [9] conducted a numerical study in a square cavity filled with a Nanofluid. The study analyzed the effect of several factors on heat transfer, while varying the type of nano-additive, the rotating speed of an inner cylinder, and its radius. The outcomes showed that the best enhancement in heat transfer was obtained when using the smallest cylinder, a faster angular cylinder speed, and high-conductivity nano-additives. Al-Farhany and Abdulsahib [10] numerically investigated how much the heat performance of a nanofluid would be affected when changing the concentration of nanocompounds, Darcy number, and the rotation speed of a cylinder involved inside a square enclosure. The authors concluded that the Nusselt number reached a peak value when increasing the cylinder rotation speed and the Darcy number. Additionally, Ghasemi and Siavashi [11] investigated the effect of adding Cu-nanoparticles to water in a porous enclosure on heat transfer during the presence of magnetic force. They found that low Darcy numbers result in stagnation of the convection effect, but by increasing Darcy numbers, both conduction and convection are improved, while adding nanoparticles also positively affects heat transfer; on the other hand, the magnetic force always has a negative effect on Nu Additionally, many research works have highlighted the impact of the shape of the enclosure on the thermal and flow behaviors. Hussein et al. [12] carried out a numerical study investigating the impact of a trapezoidal capsule with a sinusoidal bottom wall on both the fluid flow and heat transfer advancement of a nanofluid. The selected nanofluid was CuO\u2013water, which occupies two separate regions, the bottom region is saturated with porous media, and the top region remains free. The results indicated enhancements in terms of increased Darcy/Rayleigh numbers, nanoparticle concentration, inner tube radius, and rotation speed; however, an inverse effect was observed with increased Darcy number and undulation of the hot bottom wall. Pal et al. [13] numerically investigated the thermal transmission in mixed convection mode for Cu\u2013water nanofluid occupying a wavy heated bottom wall cavity, where both the walls on both the left and right sides were maintained at a cold temperature while the top adiabatic wall was sliding horizontally. The results indicated that the wavy hot wall had a significant effect when both the nanocompounds and fluid conductivities were equivalent. Cho [14] carried out a numerical study to predict the heat distribution rate within a copper\u2013water nanofluid in mixed convection mode inside a wavy-wall cavity. The fluid received heat from a sliding left-hand-side wall, while the right wall was cold and wavy, and the remaining walls were isolated. It was\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974 3 of 23\nobserved that that the average Nusselt number reached a high value with increasing nanoparticle volume fraction, wavy surface amplitude, and Richardson and Reynolds numbers. Mekroussi et al. [15] numerically studied the effect of the inclination angle on heat transfer performance during the mixed convection of fluid inside a sinusoidal wavy lid-driven enclosure. The outcomes indicated that the average Nusselt number increased with increasing numbers of undulations of the bottom wall or with increasing cavity inclination angle. Recently a new category of nanofluids, called hybrid nanofluids, has become a trend in heat transfer enhancement, and several studies have discussed the effectiveness of this type of nanofluid. Cimpean et al. [2] presented a numerical study discussing the role of mixing nanoparticles of Cu and Al2O3 with water (selected as hybrid nanofluid); the study was performed in a porous trapezoidal cavity, assuming that the top wall slid horizontally and was cold, while the bottom wall and the two side walls were respectively hot and adiabatic. The results illustrated that for Da \u2264 10\u22123, the conduction mode dominated whenever Cu nanoparticle concentration was higher, with the same reduction in the concentration of Al2O3 nanoparticles; however, the opposite effect was obtained for Da > 10\u22123. Jarray et al. [16] described how heat transfer was influenced inside a horizontal rectangular porous chamber filled with Ag-MgO\u2013water hybrid nanofluid. The numerical outcomes revealed that the improvement in heat transfer was specifically dependent on the Darcy number for certain nanoparticle concentrations, where the heat transfer rate increased with increasing nanoparticle volume fraction for weak permeability (Darcy) until reaching a peak rate, and then dropped sharply at high nanoparticle concentrations; conversely, at high values of permeability, the heat transfer rate was enhanced with any amount of nanoparticles. Additionally, the effect of the shape of the nanoparticles has been investigated. Ghadikolaei and Gholinia [3] numerically investigated the effect of nanoparticle shape on heat transfer in a 3D configuration containing a hybrid nanofluid. The output data proved that the heat transfer rate increased with increasing nano additive shape factor. Moreover, many previous works have considered entropy generation, which arises from several factors. Aich [17] carried out a three-dimensional numerical study of free convection with entropy generation of air inserted into a triangular locale. The fluid received heat from an isothermal heater placed in the bottom section, while all of the walls were adiabatic except the inclined wall, which was assumed to be cold. It was found that the heat transmission improved as the Rayleigh number increased; in addition, there was a direct relation between Rayleigh number values and entropy generation. Kolsi [18] investigated the effects of Richardson and Hartmann numbers on heat transfer and entropy generation in a fluid placed in a 3D cubical cavity. The outcomes showed that the Bejan and mean Nusselt numbers stood in an inverse relationship with Ha and Ri numbers; additionally, increasing Ha caused the entropy generation rate to drop. Hamzah et al. [19] studied the influence of Richardson and Darcy numbers on heat transfer and entropy generation in a wavy lid-driven porous container filled with CNT\u2013water nanofluid. The results indicated that the mean Nusselt number was positively affected by the increased amplitude of the wavy wall, as well as Richardson and Darcy numbers. Simultaneously, the entropy generation rate decreased. Nguyen et al. [20] carried out a numerical study in three different channels; the work aimed to determine the impact of the magnetic field on the heat transfer and entropy generation of FMWNT\u2013water (functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes). The results indicated that the magnetic force with this type of nanofluid played a positive role in enhancing heat transfer and decreasing entropy generation. Barnoon et al. [21] numerically examined the role of Hartman and Richardson numbers in enhancing heat distribution and reducing the entropy generation in a lid-driven container with rotating cylinders filled with a nanofluid. It was found that reducing both Ha and Ri led to improved heat transfer and reduced entropy generation. Comprehensive studies in which more outcomes of nanofluids/hybrid nanofluids are described can be found in [22\u201326].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974 4 of 23\nOn the basis of the literature review presented above, as well as other available research works, the present work is a theoretical proposal that would be beneficial in several engineering domains. This study aims to explore the effects of combining the use of hybrid nanofluids (water\u2013MoS2) at different G.O. concentrations (0, 3, and 6% of MoS2/G.O.) and a never-before-used zigzag-patterned wall in a 3D trapezoidal porous enclosure containing a rotating tube under magnetic force. The results are presented in terms of isothermal surfaces, streamlines (arrow-spaced streamlines), total entropy generation contours, and mean Nusselt and Bajan numbers."

All walls are assumed to be adiabatic and non-slipping except the zigzag wall, which is considered to be at the hot temperature Th, while the front wall is considered to be at the cold temperature Tc. The zigzag wall is taken to be the main geometric influencer, and has different numbers of undulations (various peak numbers, N = 4, 2, and 1).

It was found that the computational effort increased by about 58% when refining the grid from 586,133 to 3,958,438.\nNanomaterials\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 25\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\neff\nf\nk Nu k S     \u00a0 (11)\nAverage\u00a0Nusselt:\u00a0\n0\n1 SNu Nu dxdz S   \u00a0 (12)\n3.\u00a0Mesh\u00a0Sensitivity,\u00a0Computation\u00a0Procedure\u00a0and\u00a0Code\u00a0Validation\u00a0 \u00a0 3.1.\u00a0Mesh\u00a0Sensitivity\u00a0\nFor\u00a0accuracy\u00a0of\u00a0results\u00a0and\u00a0ec nomy\u00a0of\u00a0time,\u00a0serv l\u00a0mesh\u00a0element\u00a0sizes\u00a0were\u00a0test d\u00a0 (Table\u00a03).\u00a0Fig re\u00a02\u00a0presents\u00a0t \u00a0mesh\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0configurati n.\u00a0Nusselt\u00a0number\u00a0was\u00a0 chosen\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0sensitive\u00a0variable,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0comparison\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0abstained\u00a0results\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0 mesh\u00a0is\u00a0presented\u00a0in\u00a0Table\u00a04,\u00a0where\u00a0it\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0third\u00a0mesh\u00a0(for\u00a0the\u00a0three\u00a0sug\u2010 gested\u00a0configurations)\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0best\u00a0choice\u00a0 in\u00a0 terms\u00a0of\u00a0computation\u00a0 time\u00a0while\u00a0achieving\u00a0 satisfactory\u00a0outcomes.\u00a0The\u00a0grid\u00a0optimization\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0performed\u00a0by\u00a0examining\u00a0the\u00a0effect\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0grid\u00a0on\u00a0computational\u00a0effort\u00a0in\u00a0terms\u00a0of\u00a0CPU\u00a0ti e.\u00a0It\u00a0was\u00a0found\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0computa\u2010 tional\u00a0effort\u00a0increased\u00a0by\u00a0about\u00a058%\u00a0when\u00a0refining\u00a0the\u00a0grid\u00a0from\u00a0586,133\u00a0to\u00a03,958,438.\u00a0\nTable\u00a04.\u00a0Grid\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0tests\u00a0(\u00d8\u00a0=\u00a00.03,\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0100,\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0and\u00a0Da\u00a0=\u00a00.01).\u00a0\nTotal\u00a0 mber\u00a0of\u00a0Elements\u00a0 Average\u00a0Nusselt\u00a0Number\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0 137,688\u00a0 2.0245\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0 69,639\u00a0 1.7521\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0 69,180\u00a0 2.0041\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0 348,525\u00a0 2.2758\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0 182,971\u00a0 1.8745\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0 181,506\u00a0 2.0940\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0 994,968\u00a0 2.3167\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0 590,354\u00a0 1.9595\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0 586,133\u00a0 2.1472\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0 3,958,438\u00a0 2.3174\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0 2,542,173\u00a0 1.9599\u00a0 N\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0 2,519,898\u00a0 2.1502\u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0The\u00a0mesh\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0configuration;\u00a0(a)\u00a0N\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a0(b)\u00a0N\u00a0=\u00a02,\u00a0and\u00a0(c)\u00a0N\u00a0=\u00a04.\u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0Computation\u00a0Procedure\u00a0 The\u00a0 finite\u00a0element\u00a0method\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0Newton\u00a0 technique\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0 to\u00a0discretize\u00a0 and\u00a0 solve\u00a0 the\u00a0 governing\u00a0 equations\u00a0 in\u00a0 a\u00a0 grid\u00a0 composed\u00a0 of\u00a0 triangular\u00a0 elements.\u00a0 The\u00a0\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974 8 of 23"

            "text": "The influence of employing different intensities of magnetic force (Ha = 0, 50, and 100) and different permeability values (Da = 10\u22125, 10\u22123, and 10\u22122) for the same values of inner tube velocity (\u2126 = 100) and the same concentrations of nanoparticles (3%) on thermal transition and flow pattern is presented in Figure 5. The results indicate that almost no fluid motion occurs in the case of Da = 10\u22125, which is in contrast to other values of Da, where fluid motion increases with increasing Da number, while the Ha value has the opposite effect on fluid fluidity due to the magnetic force causing the momentum of fluid movement to stagnate, which specifically arises due to the rotation of the inner tube. On the other hand, the isothermal surfaces are take on a more uniform shape with increasing Hartman number or decreasing Darcy number. Hence, it can be stated that the stagnation of motion is related directly to the Hartman number and inversely to the Darcy number, and that this essentially affects heat transition.

Additionally, it should be mentioned that regardless of the fluid circulation around the tube, it can be observed that the fluid moves upwards due to the presence of the buoyancy force of free convection in the case of \u2126 = 100 at Ha = 0 and 50, which is in contrast to the other cases, where forced convection dominates. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the flow behavior plays an important role in the isothermal surface development, where the isothermal surfaces form an inclined shape in the case of \u2126 = 100 at the two lowest values of Hartman number due to free convection, which is contrast to the other cases, where the isothermal surfaces nearest to the cooled wall take on a shape parallel with it, while those nearest to the inner tube form parallel to the rounded shape, especially in the case with no magnetic force, where forced convection dominates fully.

More specifically, in the case where \u2126 = 100, it can be observed that the flow circulates around the tube in an upward direction, with the main reason behind the upward motion being the buoyancy force of free convection. Thus, the shape of the isothermal surface is oblique, in contrast to the other cases where, when the tube rotation speed is higher, the isothermal surfaces take on a rounded shape beside the inner tube. Moreover, the width of the rounded shape of the isothermal surfaces is wider in the cases where N = 4, 2 than when N = 1, which can be attributed to the domination of the forced convection mode. Additionally, the intensity of the flow motion around the tube is higher in the cases where N = 4, 2 than when N = 1, which demonstrates that the zigzag pattern affects the motion and heat distribution of the fluid.

As is well known, the Bejan number is the ratio of the entropy generation caused by heat transfer to the total entropy generation (caused by both heat transfer and fluid friction), where this number describes the participation of heat transfer as opposed to fluid friction; on the other hand, it is a factor aids in decreasing the irreversibility due to heat transfer.\nFrom the results, it can be seen that the Bejan number contours appear intensively with increasing Darcy number within the cavity due to increase in heat transfer throughout the entire cavity resulting from the increment in fluid fluidity, but it can be observed that the values of Bejan number become lower, especially close to both the hot wall and the cylinder, when the value of Da is higher, indicating that the irreversibility caused by heat transfer decreases with increasing fluid fluidity. On the other hand, the Bejan number takes on high values near the hot wall at higher solid volume fraction of nanoparticles, because the heat transfer caused by conduction is higher at the higher nanoparticle concentration.

It can be observed that the contours of the Bejan number spread significantly through the cavity when lessening the magnetic force for Da = 10\u22123 and Da = 10\u22122 because the fluidity of the fluid increases with decreasing Ha and increasing Da; therefore, the spread of heat is wider due to the forced convection. At the same time, the Bejan number reaches lower values, especially close to the hot wall and the spinning tube, and a tiny reduction can be observed in the case of Da = \u22125 when Ha is higher. Furthermore, it can be observed that Be is affected by the fluidity and the friction rate within the fluid, whereas Be decreases with increasing fluid fluidity.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974 16 of 23Nanomaterials\u00a020 2,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 f\u00a0 25\u00a0 \u00a0\nHa = 0 Ha = 50 Ha = 100\nD a\n= 10\n\u22125\nD a\n= 10\n\u22123\nD a\n= 10\n\u22122\nFigure\u00a012.\u00a0The\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0contours\u00a0for\u00a0different\u00a0Da\u00a0and\u00a0Ha\u00a0values\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0tube\u00a0rotation\u00a0 speed\u00a0(\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0100).\u00a0\nFigure\u00a013\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0evolution\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0when\u00a0applying\u00a0various\u00a0magnetic\u00a0 forces\u00a0(Ha\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a050,\u00a0and\u00a0100)\u00a0and\u00a0different\u00a0cylinder\u00a0angular\u00a0velocities\u00a0(\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0100,\u00a0250,\u00a0and\u00a0500)\u00a0 for\u00a0Da\u00a0=\u00a010\u22122\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0nanoparticle\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a06%.\u00a0The\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0contours\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0 observed\u00a0throughout\u00a0the\u00a0whole\u00a0cavity\u00a0in\u00a0all\u00a0cases\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0strong\u00a0fluidity\u00a0resulting\u00a0the\u00a0 present\u00a0Darcy\u00a0(Da\u22122)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0active\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0rotating\u00a0cylinder,\u00a0which\u00a0causes\u00a0the\u00a0heat\u00a0 to\u00a0spread\u00a0extensively\u00a0(by\u00a0forced\u00a0convection).\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0Be\u00a0decrease\u00a0when\u00a0 Ha\u00a0reaches\u00a0low\u00a0values\u00a0with\u00a0increasing\u00a0inner\u00a0tube\u00a0angular\u00a0velocity,\u00a0especially\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0 cylinder,\u00a0where\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0of\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0 at\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a0as\u00a0indicated\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0blue\u00a0lines\u00a0"

Be is affected by increases in the hybrid nanoparticle concentration and ell as in Hartman and Darcy numbers. It is known that the Bejan number depicts the ratio of entropy generation caused by heat transfer to that caused by fluid friction. By increasing the permeability and decreasing the strength of the magnetic force, the Be decreases due to the increase in flow friction at high permeability values; in other words, the entropy that is generated by the flow friction has its highest values with high fluid motion, which leads to irreversibility due to heat transmission slightly decreasing. Increasing the amount of nanoparticles increases the thermal conductivity, but on the other hand, it also negatively affects the fluid motion, because the fluid viscosity increases, so that the entropy generation caused by heat transfer is increased and the entropy generation caused by fluid friction decreases, which is why the lowest Be can be found in the case of \u00d8 = 0/Ha = 0/Da = 0.01.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1974 19 of 23\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 20\u00a0 of\u00a0 5\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a015.\u00a0The\u00a0evolution\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0average\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0 function\u00a0of\u00a0Da,\u00a0Ha,\u00a0and\u00a0nanoparticle\u00a0\nconcentration\u00a0(\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0100).\u00a0\n4.13.\u00a0The\u00a0Effect\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Tube\u00a0Rotation\u00a0Speed\u00a0and\u00a0Darcy\u00a0and\u00a0Hartman\u00a0Numbers\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0 Development\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Average\u00a0Bejan\u00a0Number\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0tube\u00a0rotation\u00a0speed\u00a0and\u00a0Darcy\u00a0and\u00a0Hartman\u00a0numbers\u00a0with\u00a06%\u00a0na\u2010 noparticle\u00a0concentration\u00a0on\u00a0average\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0values\u00a0is\u00a0illustrated\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a016.\u00a0The\u00a0 average\u00a0Bejan\u00a0number\u00a0drops\u00a0to\u00a0lower\u00a0values\u00a0with\u00a0faster\u00a0tube\u00a0rotation.\u00a0This\u00a0means\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0 entropy\u00a0generation\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0flow\u00a0friction\u00a0increases\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0fluid\u00a0motion\u00a0re\u2010 sulting\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0Ha\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0highest\u00a0tube\u00a0rotation\u00a0speed.\u00a0 More\u00a0specifically,\u00a0at\u00a0 Da 10 ,\u00a0the\u00a0\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u00a0 values\u00a0are\u00a0approximately\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0for\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0 100/all\u00a0Ha\u00a0values\u00a0and\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0250/Ha\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0and\u00a050,\u00a0but\u00a0at\u00a0Da\u00a0=\u00a00.01,\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u00a0 are\u00a0 found\u00a0with\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0for\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0100,\u00a0and\u00a0with\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a0 followed\u00a0by\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0for\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0250.\u00a0 \u00a0 For\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0=\u00a0500,\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u00a0 are\u00a0found\u00a0with\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a0100,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0 and\u00a0then\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0when\u00a0Da 10 ,\u00a0and\u00a0at\u00a0Da\u00a0=\u00a00.01,\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\u00a0 are\u00a0obtained\u00a0 with\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a0100,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0Ha\u00a0=\u00a050.\u00a0\nFigure 15.

It increases with both increasing Darcy number and increasing angular velocity of the inner cylinder or with both decreasing Hartman number and decreasing nanoparticle amount. \u2022 The Bejan number decreases with both increasing Darcy number and increasing angular velocity of the inner cylinder or with decreasing Hartman number and nanoparticle amount. \u2022 High numbers of undulations in the hot wall play an important role in reducing the irreversibility phenomenon by increasing the fluid movement inside the cavity (i.e., increasing the friction in the fluid).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A. and T.B.; methodology, A.A.; software, T.B. and A.A. validation, T.B. and L.K.; formal analysis, K.G.
