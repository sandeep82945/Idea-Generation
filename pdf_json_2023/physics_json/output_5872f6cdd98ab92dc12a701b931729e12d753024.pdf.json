Two crystal structures of Ci-VSD in putative resting and active conformations suggest a10 helical-screw voltage sensing mechanism in which the S4 helix translocates and rotates to enable exchange of salt-bridge partners. By combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations with a computational framework based on dynamical operators, we elucidate the microscopic mechanism of the resting-active transition at physiological membrane potential. Sparse regression reveals a small set of coordinates that distinguish intermediates hidden from electrophysiological measurements. The intermediates arise from a noncanonical15 helical-screw mechanism in which translocation, rotation, and side-chain movement of the S4 helix are only loosely coupled. These results provide new insights into existing experimental and computational findings on voltage sensing and suggest ways of further probing its mechanism.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nVoltage sensing in membrane proteins is an essential bio-20 physical phenomenon that underlies many physiological processes. Experiments and models suggest that voltagesensing proteins respond to changes in the transmembrane potential through movement of positively-charged amino acids (primarily arginines)1\u20133, but a detailed un-25 derstanding of the mechanism at the atomic level remains lacking. Despite the availability of several structures of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) in their active states4\u20136, there are comparatively few structures of VGICs in their resting states without the perturbing ef-30 fects of engineered crosslinks (metal binding sites and disulfide bridges) or toxins7\u201315.\nLike VGICs, the voltage-sensing phosphatase from Ciona intestinalis (Ci-VSP) exhibits sensing currents in response to changes in transmembrane potential, as well as35 voltage-regulated enzymatic activity16\u201320. Furthermore, crystal structures of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) from Ci-VSP in conformations thought to represent the resting (down) and active (up) states are available21. The down state is occupied by the wild-type protein at40 0 mV applied voltage, whereas the up state is obtained by mutating a basic residue to an acidic one (R217E), which shifts the voltage dependence. These structures present a unique opportunity for elucidating a mechanism of voltage-sensing in atomic detail using molecular45 dynamics (MD) simulations.\nConsistent with structures of a number of VGICs4,6,20,\n\u2217)Electronic mail: roux@uchicago.edu \u2020)Electronic mail: dinner@uchicago.edu\nCi-VSD consists of four transmembrane helices, labeled S1\u2013S4 (Fig. 1). The voltage-sensing response is mediated by five arginines (R217, R223, R226, R229, and50 R232) spaced by three residues along S43,16,20\u201322; these are the analogs of the gating arginines in ion channels. These arginines form salt bridges with acidic side chains acting as countercharges, which are located on helices S1\u2013S3: D129, E183, and D186. Studies that manipu-55 late these interactions and corresponding ones in other VSDs indicate that these interactions are essential for the voltage-sensing response7,8,23\u201325. Finally, there is a group of three highly-conserved, bulky hydrophobic residues, I126, F161, and I190, frequently referred to as the \u201chy-60 drophobic plug\u201d or \u201cgasket\u201d, which serve as a charge transfer center for the sensing arginines by focusing the transmembrane electric field into a small region26\u201329. The structures of the down and up states and simulations suggest that the S4 helix undergoes a helical-screw mech-65 anism in discrete steps (\u201cclicks\u201d) that couple a translocation of about 5 A\u030a to a rotation of 60\u25e6 around the helix axis21,25. This enables exchange of salt bridge partners between neighboring arginines. At the same time, the S1\u2013S3 helices differ little in between the down and up70 states. There is evidence for states that are one click in each direction beyond the down and up states (down\u2013 and up+, respectively)17,25,30.\nAlthough there have been previous MD studies of VSDs25,31\u201340, direct simulation of the transition between75 resting and active states at physiological voltages remains computationally intractable.

We rely110 on a framework based on transition path theory43 that assumes the dynamics are Markovian after a relatively short time. The method, which is called the dynamical Galerkin approximation (DGA), can be viewed as a generalization of Markov state models (MSMs)41,42. The115 essential idea is that long-time statistics can be estimated by combining information from a dataset of short unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories that each samples a portion of the VSD activation event. In other words, we can learn the mechanism of the transition even when no120 single trajectory connects the down and up states, so long as the transition region between them is well sampled (as discussed further in Section IV). This dramatically reduces the computational cost because we do not need to wait for fluctuations that give rise to such a trajectory,125 let alone the many that would be needed to achieve the same statistical confidence. We exploit the specialized Anton 2 supercomputer44 to generate a dataset of 415 \u00b5s of aggregate simulation at zero (depolarized) membrane potential. The dataset consists of short trajectories initi-130 ated from starting points distributed between the down\u2013 and up+ states (homology models that shift the sensing arginines one click past the down and up states21,25).\nHere we describe three statistics that are particularly important for molecular studies and how we use them to135 learn mechanisms.

The committor, because it varies monotonically between zero at the reactant state and one at the product state, represents a natural coordinate for tracking the progress of a conformational transition and can be used to identify the molecular features that correlate with that155 progress. Finally, the reactive current yields information about the dynamical propagation of molecular features during a conformational transition.\nWe first connect our simulations to experimental measurements via the displacement charge.

The change in displacement charge upon a conformational transition of the voltage-sensor, \u2206Qd, also known as the sensing charge (or, in VGICs,175 the gating charge), can be measured with voltageclamp electrophysiology3,46. Ci-VSD was previously found16,21,25 to transfer approximately 1.1 e in going from the down state to the up state. Our calculations yield a sensing charge of \u2206Qd = 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 e, in agreement with180 previous estimates.\nUsing DGA, we computed the average Qd as a function of the S4 helix translocation and rotation, and it exhibits discrete values (Supplementary Fig. 1a), consistent with the idea that the S4 helix moves by discrete \u201cclicks\u201d185 (these results can be compared directly with Fig. 1B of Ref. 25). In further support of this idea, the PMF as a function of Qd (Fig. 3a, black line) exhibits minima at Qd values corresponding to the down and up states; these minima are nearly identical in free energy and are sepa-190 rated by a barrier of less than 0.5 kcal/mol, suggesting both states may be populated in the absence of an applied potential. Although the simulations are performed at 0 mV, we can mimic the effect of an applied potential, V , by adding a linear term QdV to the free energy195 profile45. Relatively mild hyperpolarizing or depolarizing voltages on the order of \u221350 mV are sufficient to tilt the PMF in favor of the down (and down\u2013) or up (and up+)\nstates, respectively (Fig. 3a).\nTo connect with measured kinetics17,18,47\u201350, we com-200 puted an equilibrium time-correlation function for Qd (Fig. 3b). It can be well fit by a biexponential function with slow and fast time constants of approximately 59 \u00b5s and 0.04 \u00b5s, respectively. The slow time constant is consistent with our estimates of the mean first pas-205 sage times between down and up states (\u223c100 \u00b5s, Supplementary Fig. 2). These values are about an order of magnitude faster than the fast component of fluorescence relaxation of dye-labeled VSDs, which tracks the charge movement (sensing current)17,47\u201350. However, the exper-210 imental studies were mainly performed with full-length Ci-VSP containing the phosphatase domain and linker, which slows down the voltage-activation process47. With this in mind, our results suggest both the equilibrium averages and the kinetics are consistent with available data215 and previous simulations for Ci-VSD, so we now turn to dissecting the microscopic dynamics during activation.\nAs a first step toward this end, we computed the committor (q+) for all structures in our dataset. To recap, the committor is the probability that trajectories initialized220 from a conformation lead to the up (i.e., active) state before the down (i.e., resting) state, so the down state corresponds to q+ = 0 and the up state corresponds to q+ = 1. We used the committor to compute a two-dimensional PMF (Fig. 3c), revealing a qualitatively different picture225 than the PMF of the displacement charge alone. There are minima at q+ \u2248 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, all with Qd between \u22123.5 e and \u22124 e. The simulations thus suggest that, while the displacement charge dynamics are essentially two-state, the microscopic dynamics are five-state.230 Moreover, the highest barrier is about 1.5 kcal/mol relative to the down state. To understand the differences between the PMFs and to characterize the intermediates and barriers between the down and up states, we sought to identify molecular features that correlated with the235 committor."

            "text": "Following previous work51,52, we sought to identify combinations of physically-intuitive collective variables240 (CVs) that can describe the dynamics by modeling the committor in terms of a small number of interpretable molecular features with LASSO regression (Section IVG). Out of the 60 inter-residue distances used as input to the committor (Section IVD), we manually se-245 lected several to track the movements of the side chains of the sensing arginines (R217, R223, R226, R229, and R232), as well as those of their acidic salt-bridge partners. These were distances between the sensing arginine C\u03b6 atoms and the C\u03b3/C\u03b4 atoms of D129, E183, and D186250 (Fig. 1). We also used the distance between the C\u03b6 atom of R226 and the center of mass of F161\u2019s side chain to track the movement of R226 through the hydrophobic plug, which is thought to present a barrier between the resting and active states27,28,38. We chose F161 instead of255 I126 or I190 because it is highly conserved among voltagesensitive proteins (corresponding to F290 in the Shaker potassium channel for example)27. Finally, we included the S4 helix translocation and rotation, given their known role in VSD activation25,36,39,53\u201355.260\nWe initially fit the model to all points with q+ \u2208 [0.2, 0.8]. However, in analyzing the model, we found that some CVs that we expected to contribute had small or zerovalued coefficients because the committor varies nonmonotonically with them (e.g., the R226-F161 distance265 decreases and then increases as R226 goes through the hydrophobic plug). Consequently, we divided the reaction into two stages, one from the down (reactant) state to q+ = 0.5 (i.e., the transition state ensemble in the sense that conformations with q+ = 0.5 have an equal270 likelihood of leading to the down and up states), and another from q+ = 0.5 to the up (product) state (Section IVG).\nWe found that nine CVs contributed significantly to at least one of the two models. They were the S4 helix275 translocation and rotation and distances involving R226, R229, and R232 (Fig. 4a, b). To verify that these CVs are indeed sufficient to express the committor (and hence represent a useful subspace of variables to analyze), we constructed coordinates from linear combinations of in-280 put variables using the integrated variational approach to conformational dynamics (IVAC)56, a method that robustly identifies slow modes of a system. The committor monotonically follows the first nontrivial IVAC coordinate (Fig. 4c), suggesting that the down-up transition is285\n5 a\ncb S3 S1\nD186\nE183\nF161\nR226\nR232\nR229\nD129\nS2S4\nsampling (REUS). The two PMFs are similar overall but differ slightly near the down state (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 4), and there is a prominent minimum with a depth of about 1\u20132 kcal/mol near (\u22125 A\u030a,\u221210\u25e6).305 This minimum is also present in the REUS simulations at positive applied potentials, when up-like states are stabilized25. Structures in this minimum have the R226 side chain located above the hydrophobic plug. Because the sampling in these CVs is controlled directly in REUS,310 we expect the REUS PMF to be more accurate\u2014DGA slightly underestimates the stability of the down state and the barrier to the up state.\nWe show histograms of translocation and rotation as functions of committor in Fig. 5c. These indicate that315 both variables have considerable freedom in the down state (q+ = 0). Prior to the transition state (q+ < 0.5), translocation remains unrestricted, but rotation becomes restricted and steadily increases towards 0\u25e6 with the committor. After the transition state (q+ > 0.5), transloca-320 tion rapidly increases to its value in the up state (q+ = 1). These results are consistent with the average committor, the PMF, and the reactive currents in this plane (Fig. 5a, b). The transition state (q+ = 0.5) appears as a nearly horizontal white line just below the up state, and the325 reactive current is in the vertical direction.\nHistorically, two mechanisms have been proposed for S4 helix movement: a helical-screw mechanism in which translocation and rotation advance together53\u201355,57,58 and a sliding-helix mechanism in which the \u03b1-helix con-330 verts to a narrower 310-helix, allowing it to translocate independently of rotation8,47. In contrast to the helicalscrew mechanism, we find that the S4 helix is relatively free to translocate back and forth prior to the transition state (Fig. 5c), and it is the restriction of the rota-335 tional degree of freedom that determines when the transition state is crossed. At the same time, we find little 310-helix content to support the sliding-helix mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with prior analyses25. The mechanism that we observe combines the rotation340 of the helical-screw mechanism with the translocation of the sliding-helix mechanism, resembling the action of a barrel slide bolt. In the next section, we elaborate this mechanism by considering the side-chain dynamics.\nD. Transitions between intermediates involve exchange of345 arginine salt-bridge partners\nIn addition to the S4 helix variables, the sparse model from LASSO regression (Fig. 4a) shows that the movements of R226, R229, and R232 relative to their salt bridge partners and the hydrophobic plug are important,350 and we find that they can account for the structure in Fig. 3c. Moreover, we observe in our simulations that vertical translocation of the S4 helix can precede or lag behind the exchange of salt bridge partners by the sensing arginines (Supplementary Fig. 6). That is, changes in355\nthe side chains of R226, R229 (and to some extent R232), translocation, and rotation are quasi-independent. Here, we describe the successive movements from the down state to the minima at q+ \u2248 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, and finally to the up state.360\nIn the down state, R226 and R229 form salt bridges with D186 and E183, respectively (Fig. 1), while the guanidinium group of R232 forms hydrogen bonds to phosphate groups of lipids (Supplementary Figs. 7a and 8a, c), a role previously noted in studies of VSDs31,39,59\u201361.365 The aliphatic part of the R226 side chain is in contact with the hydrophobic plug.\nThe transition to the minimum at q+ \u2248 0.25 involves the movement of R226\u2019s guanidinium group into the plug so as to interact with the phenyl side chain of F161 (Fig. 6a,370 b and Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Although cation-\u03c0 interactions and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking have been suggested to stabilize interactions between arginine and phenylalanine residues27,62\u201364, the fixed charges in the force field do not directly represent these (quadrupole) interactions. In-375 stead, this minimum is primarily stabilized by R226 forming a salt bridge with D129 from the hydrophobic plug (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Consistent with the discussion\nabove, making these interactions relies on S4 helix rotation but not translocation (Supplementary Fig. 10).380\nThe next barrier between the minima at q+ \u2248 0.25 and q+ \u2248 0.50 is very low, and R229 interacts with both E183 and D186 to varying degrees in this range of committor values (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7a). The transition from the first intermediate minimum to the second385 reflects the movement of R232 away from the phosphate groups of the lipids to interact with E183 (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Figs. 7a and 10). In the intermediate near q+ \u2248 0.5 (which can be considered the transition state ensemble, as noted above), we find significant heterogene-390 ity in R229\u2019s conformations: the R229-E183 distance, for example, exhibits two populations, one centered around 4 A\u030a and another from 6\u201310 A\u030a (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7b). In the former, R229 is coordinated to both E183 and D186, whereas in the latter R229 is only co-395 ordinated to D186 (Fig. 6c). Accordingly, R229 forms hydrogen bonds mainly with D186, but also with E183 and lipid phosphate groups when q+ < 0.5 (Supplementary Figs. 7a and 8). As discussed earlier, translocation of the S4 helix is relatively unconstrained in the interme-400 diate stages of the transition (Fig. 5), with heterogeneity\n8 seen in transition state structures.\nThe transition to the minimum at q+ \u2248 0.75 requires the dissociation of R229 from E183 and the movement of R232 to interact with D186 (Fig. 6a, d and Supple-405 mentary Fig. 10). The barrier separating the minima at q+ \u2248 0.50 and q+ \u2248 0.75 results from the exchange of the two salt bridges with R229 and R232. Furthermore, after the transition state q+ \u2248 0.5, S4 helix translocation begins increasing (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10),410 and the completion of this process results in the final transition to q+ = 1. In some structures with high committor values, R226 extends to interact with S158 and T197 (Supplementary Fig. 7c).\nIII. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION415\nIn this paper, we used recent advances in methods for computing kinetic statistics to elucidate the mechanism of the down-up transition of Ci-VSD. In contrast to previous studies of voltage-sensing proteins, which have focused mainly on metastable states of the voltage-420 sensing domain25,36,39,40, our work dissects the microscopic events underlying a single \u201cclick\u201d.\nAs summarized in Fig. 7, the down-up transition proceeds through a stepwise mechanism analogous to a caterpillar traversing a rugged landscape (Supplementary425 Movie 1). The overall displacement of the helix and the rearrangements of the side chains are only loosely coordinated. The movements of R226, R229, and R232 do not follow a strict sequence, though steric interference prevents them from being totally independent. From the430 down state to q+ \u2248 0.25, rotation of the S4 helix allows R226 to detach from D186, move through the hydrophobic plug, and form a salt bridge with D129 (Fig. 7a, b). At q+ \u2248 0.5, where the system has an equal likelihood of proceeding forward and backward, R229 delocalizes and435 interacts with both E183 and D186, while R232 detaches from the lipid phosphate head groups and forms a salt bridge with E183 (Fig. 7c). At q+ \u2248 0.75, R229 forms a salt bridge to D186 and R232 interacts with both E183 and D186 (Fig. 7d). Finally, the S4 helix must translo-440 cate to its up state position while R229 enters the plug to occupy the position of R226 in the down state (Fig. 7d, e).\nAlthough the free-energy landscape along the displacement charge appears two-state, our analysis based on the445 committor reveals the presence of metastable intermediates. These intermediates may help explain the multiexponential kinetics of fluorescence relaxation measured for labeled VSDs17,47\u201350. Given that the PMFs are relatively shallow, even under applied transmembrane po-450 tentials of \u00b1150 mV25, there could also be contributions from transitions involving the down\u2013 and up+ states, which could introduce additional timescales. Regarding the kinetics, it is important to note that our estimates of the activation timescales are systematically too fast.455\nThis may reflect a breakdown in the Markov assumption underlying the DGA calculations, limitations of the choice of basis, insufficient sampling, and limitations of the force field. The first two could be addressed by including non-Markovian effects65 in the DGA calculations460 or by applying nonequilibrium sampling methods66.\nDespite the potential issues, we expect that our simulations represent the microscopic structures and dynamics of Ci-VSD reasonably well. We consequently expect the \u201ccaterpillar\u201d mechanism that we describe to465 hold for mildly depolarizing and hyperpolarizing voltages. This mechanism represents a significant deviation from a canonical helical-screw model in that translocation, rotation, and side-chain movements are only loosely coupled. While we are not aware of a previous study that470 explicitly describes such a mechanism, some decoupling of the S4 translocation, rotation, and side-chain movements has been noted in passing for simulations of CiVSD25 and Kv1.233,36.\nAnother striking feature of our simulations is the rela-475 tively low barrier between the down and up states in CiVSD compared with, for example, the barrier between the \u03b4 and \u03b5 states of the Kv1.2 channel (5 kcal/mol)40. Given Ci-VSP\u2019s sequence divergence from VGICs and comparatively slower gating kinetics16,21,22,28,47,67, we480 believe the smaller barrier is genuine and not an artifact of different computational approaches. The lower barrier could furthermore be partially attributed to the lack of 310 helix formation 8,25.\nWe expect that R226\u2019s movement through the hydropho-485 bic plug is facilitated by its ability to make a salt bridge with D129 while in contact with the I126 and F161 side chains (Supplementary Fig. 9c). In contrast, VGICs generally have a polar but uncharged amino acid at the site corresponding to D12920,68, preventing formation of an490 analogous interaction and leading to a significant dielectric barrier69. Perhaps relatedly, in VGICs, reducing the hydrophobicity of gating-pore residues by mutation accelerates activation upon depolarization69, whereas in CiVSP kinetics are more closely correlated with the sizes of495 side chains of hydrophobic-plug residues28,70. The closer spacing of the acidic residues in Ci-VSD compared with VGICs may also explain how the arginine side chains can make salt bridges without the S4 helix needing to convert to a 310-helix near the hydrophobic plug, as in the500 sliding-helix mechanism8,25,37,71.\nExperimentally, it may be possible to validate the proposed mechanism by correlating movements of a fluorescent label (e.g., attached to a G214C mutation on the S3-S4 linker) to S4 helix movement and/or displacement505 charge changes17,18,30,47, or while perturbing residues implicated in key rearrangements. For example, the importance of R226 side-chain reorientation during early stages of activation suggests that limiting rotation of the \u03c71 dihedral angle (perhaps by introducing an unnatural510 arginine congener72) might alter the kinetics of activa-\ntion or block it entirely. Other residues not analyzed in detail, such as S158 and T197 (Supplementary Fig. 7c), may modulate intermediate states of the activation process by interacting with the sensing arginines, and their515 role could be tested by observing the effect of mutations on activation kinetics.\nNotably, the physically interpretable low-dimensional model of the committor obtained from our LASSO procedure did not require distances to the sensing arginines520 R217 and R223. R217\u2019s interactions with negative countercharges such as D129, D136, and D154 correlate only weakly with the committor and are heterogeneous in the transition state (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Our results are consistent with prior suggestions that R217 primarily525 participates in activation by modulating the electric field rather than through salt-bridge formation22, although its role may be different in the transition between the down\u2013 and down states owing to its proximity to D129 and the hydrophobic plug in the down\u2013 state. On the other hand,530 R223 tends to form salt bridges with D129. Relative to R226, R223\u2019s salt-bridge distances are less predictive of the committor and its contribution to the displacement charge is small, consistent with its exposure to solvent in the extracellular crevice of Ci-VSD. Prior studies that535 mutated this amino acid to cysteine or histidine22,25 suggested that R223 may play a larger role in transitions involving the down\u2013 and up+ states of Ci-VSD. Computationally, it would therefore be interesting to study these other transitions, as well as the down-up transition540 in the presence of applied fields."

The reactive current, J\u03beAB , can be computed from the equilibrium distribution and575 the committor. In this section, we define the operators mathematically and present key equations for these statistics.\nFor a Markov process X(t), the transition operator Tt is defined as580\nTtf(x) = E[f(X(t)) | X(0) = x], (1)\nwhere f is an arbitrary function of the coordinates X(t), and E denotes an expectation. The transition operator evolves the average of f (over multiple random realizations of X) for a lag time t, conditioned on starting at585 x.\nThe PMF is the free energy as a function of specific coordinates.

Because of the boundary condi-605 tions q+(x) = 0 in A and q+(x) = 1 in B, the committor is governed by a modified transition operator\nStf(x) = E[f(X(t \u2227 TA\u222aB)) | X(0) = x], (4)\nwhere TA\u222aB = min{t \u2265 0 | X(t) \u2208 A \u222a B} is the first time X enters A \u222a B and t \u2227 TA\u222aB \u2261 min{t, TA\u222aB}.610 The transition operator St corresponds to terminating\nthe dynamics when A or B is entered. The committor satisfies42\nq+(x) =  Stq+(x) x \u2208 (A \u222aB)c\n0 x \u2208 A 1 x \u2208 B.\n(5)\nCrucially, (5) holds for any lag time t, so in principle we615 can obtain q+ from simulations that are much shorter than the transition time (i.e., t \u226a TA\u222aB).\nFinally, the reactive current measures the flux of reactive probability density, the probability of observing a reactive trajectory transitioning from A to B43,74. The620 reactive current is most easily interpreted after projecting onto a subspace of CVs, \u03be(x), yielding a vector field\nJ\u03beAB(s) that summarizes how reactive trajectories flow through \u03be(x) = s. It was shown previously that the projected reactive probability current satisfies42,66625\nJ\u03beAB(s) = \u222b JAB(x) \u00b7 \u2207\u03be(x)\u03b4(\u03be(x)\u2212 s)\u03c0(x) dx, (6)\nwhere JAB is the reactive flux in the space of original coordinates. As in previous work, we smooth all reactive currents with a Gaussian kernel density estimate of width 1 bin.630"

Note that solving for the weight factor w, unlike q+, does not require any explicit boundary conditions. After substituting the ansatz in equation (7) into the appropriate640 operator equation [e.g., equation (5) for q+], multiplying by another basis function \u03d5j , and integrating over the sampled distribution \u00b5(x), we obtain the linear system\n(Ct \u2212 C0)v = \u2212(rt \u2212 r0), (8)\nwhere645\nCijt = \u222b \u03d5i(x)St\u03d5j(x)\u00b5(x) dx (9a)\nrjt = \u222b \u03d5j(x)St\u03b3(x)\u00b5(x) dx.

DGA can thus be viewed as a generalization of MSMs to arbitrary basis sets. As such, the data requirements for DGA can never be more than for MSMs, and they can be less if a basis better than indicator functions can be found41,42. As we discuss further in665 Section IVD, we employ the MSM (indicator) basis set for computing the equilibrium probability, and a modified pairwise distance basis set42 for the committor."

The distances\nare based on two groups of residues: (1) R217, R223, R226, R229, and R232 and (2) D129, D136, D151, D164, E183, and D186. We include all intergroup distances between the C\u03b1 atoms, as well as all distances between the695 arginine C\u03b6 atoms and the aspartate/glutamate C\u03b4/C\u03b5 atoms of these residues. This yields (5\u00d76)+(5\u00d76) = 60 distances. We also tested including other pairwise distances, such as those involving residues in the hydrophobic plug, but these did not change the committor signif-700 icantly.\nBriefly, we constructed the basis functions by first computing the Euclidean distance for each configuration x to the boundary of state A or state B, yielding dA and dB (the dependence on x is left implicit). Then,705 we define a function h(x) = dAdB/(dA + dB)\n2, which obeys the boundary conditions by construction, and set \u03d5i(x) = xih(x) where xi is the ith component of the 60- dimensional coordinate vector. Finally, we use singular value decomposition to whiten the basis functions. The710 guess function is \u03b3(x) = d2A/(d 2 A + d 2 B), which also satis-\nfies the boundary conditions by construction.\nFor the weight factor, w, a basis of indicator functions (corresponding to an MSM) was used, since the distance basis tended to yield noisier results. Instead of the 60715 salt-bridge distances, we used the minimum heavy-atom distance between each residue in the S4 helix and each residue in the S1\u2013S3 helices (1924 distances in total). We reduced the feature vector to 10 dimensions using the integrated variational approach to conformational dynam-720 ics (IVAC)56 and then clustered the MD structures with mini-batch k-means (k = 200), as implemented in scikitlearn75. Each cluster was converted into an indicator basis function.\nE. Simulation details and adaptive sampling procedure725\nThe starting point for our simulations was the crystal structure of the up state (PDB ID 4G7V)21. We added hydrogens to this structure and embedded it into a palmitoyl oleyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid bilayer approximately 78 A\u030a \u00d7 78 A\u030a in area, with 86 and 88 lipids730 in the outer and inner leaflets, respectively. Titratable residues were assigned their default protonation states at pH 7. The orientation and relative position of the protein inside the membrane was adjusted according to the prediction from the orientations of proteins in membranes735 (OPM) database76. We then used the program VMD77\nto solvate the system in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution so that it was electrically neutral. There were 20 Na+ and 19 Cl\u2212 ions, for a total of 56,582 atoms.\nIn simulations, we used the CHARMM36m force field78740 for the protein, phospholipids, and ions, and the TIP3P model79 for water molecules. We used the hydrogen mass repartitioning scheme80 and a time step of 4 fs. All simulations were carried out in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble (300 K, 1 atm) with periodic boundary conditions and745\n12\nwithout an applied voltage. The temperature and pressure were controlled using the Nose\u0301\u2013Hoover thermostat and the semi-isotropic MTK barostat, respectively81\u201383. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the u-series method84, and van der Waals interactions750 were truncated at a cutoff distance of 9 A\u030a.\nTo construct a dataset that adequately sampled the transition, we employed a two stage approach (Fig. 2). First, we drew initial conditions uniformly from REUS windows in the space of S4 helix CVs25. The coordinates, cor-755 responding velocities and periodic boundary parameters were used to initialize Anton 2 simulations44. From these initial conditions, we performed 230 simulations of 1 \u00b5s and 7 simulations of 10 \u00b5s for a total of 300 \u00b5s. Because these data were insufficient to converge the committor,760 we expanded our dataset by sampling adaptively. Specifically, we selected structures with estimated committor values near q+ = 0.5 and with under-sampled values of CVs tracking the S4 helix or arginine side chain motions.\nIn the initial dataset, we observed that some simulations765 did not diverge significantly from their initial structures on the timescale of hundreds of nanoseconds, suggesting that there were degrees of freedom preventing fast equilibration of the desired CVs. Steering the system toward the the down or up state and back prior to run-770 ning unbiased dynamics seemed to ameliorate this issue. These steered molecular dynamics simulations85,86 were performed with a mild harmonic restraint on selected salt-bridge distances and on the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to either the down or up state. From775 the final structures we initialized additional 1 \u00b5s simulations. In total, we accumulated 415 \u00b5s of trajectories, with coordinates saved every 0.1 ns."

As discussed in Section II, our initial analysis suggested that the committor depends nonmonotonically on some variables. To capture these relationships with LASSO, we split our dataset into points with q+ \u2264 0.5 and q+ \u2265 0.5 and then used an inverse sig-840 moid transform to map the DGA-estimated committor to the entire range (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) so that the LASSO-predicted committors were constrained to the appropriate range [either (0, 0.5) or (0.5, 1.0)].
