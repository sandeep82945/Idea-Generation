    "abstractText": "Advances in experimental and computational techniques enable the exploration of large and complex RNA 3D structures. These, in turn, reveal previously unstudied properties and motifs not characteristic for small molecules with simple architectures. Examples include entanglements of structural elements in RNA molecules and knot-like folds discovered, among others, in the genomes of RNA viruses. Recently, we presented the first classification of entanglements, determined by their topology and the type of entangled structural elements. Here, we introduce RNAspider \u2013 a web server to automatically identify, classify, and visualize primary and higherorder entanglements in RNA tertiary structures. The program applies to evaluate RNA 3D models obtained experimentally or by computational prediction. It supports the analysis of uncommon topologies in the pseudoknotted RNA structures. RNAspider is implemented as a publicly available tool with a user-friendly interface and can be freely accessed at https://rnaspider.cs.put.poznan.pl/. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

It is also essential in the structure-based drug design and optimizing new therapeutic agents targeting RNA (3,4). Over the years, various structured RNAs have been learned along with their functions. Examples include tRNA (5), riboswitches (6), ribozymes (7) or RNAs in large molecular machines like ribosomes (8) or spliceosomes (9). Also, viruses contain functional RNAs that control critical steps of the replication cycle (10,11). Since the properties and functions of molecules largely depend on structural motifs, tools to study these motifs in known RNA structures and model them correctly by computational methods are much needed.\nDetermination and prediction of RNA 3D structure is still a challenge. However, better experimental techniques and new computational methods are helping us to learn and analyze it with increasing accuracy, also for large molecules with composite structures.

Examples include knots and knot-like folds. Knots have been detected in protein structures (12,13) and debated for RNAs (14\u201316). Their various types \u2013 knots, slipknots, links, or lassos \u2013 occur when a polymer chain (e.g. protein backbone) threads through itself. Exploring them is aided by protein-centered computational tools (17,18), which can be applied to RNA, although not incorporating basepairing critical in RNA folding. Knot-like folds have been observed in viral exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (19,20) and SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting element (FSE) (11,21). In these structures, the 5\u2032-end of RNA strand threads through a ring that originates from pseudoknot formation. RNA knot-like motifs display unique mechanical properties and biological functions (22\u201324).\nIn our recent paper (25), we have presented the problem of structural element entanglements in RNA 3D structures. We included RNA base pairings in the definition of entanglement, which distinguishes the latter from the topological knot. Based on the secondary structure, we described open and closed structure elements and developed a classification of entanglements considering their topology and the type of tangled elements. We have found various entanglements in RNA 3D models from the RNA-Puzzles benchmark set (26). 38% of over a thousand predictions contained at least one pair of entangled structural elements. We have also identified entanglements within two example PDB structures. Some of these entanglements (e.g. interlaces) appear to be errors in algorithms for the in silico modeling of RNA folds or programs to reconstruct the 3D structures from experimental data. Others may be functional motifs. Among the latter is the knot-like fold that \u2013 according to our classification \u2013 is assigned to higher-order entanglements.\nHere, we introduce RNAspider \u2013 a webserver to analyze entanglements of structure elements in RNA 3D structures. It identifies primary entanglements and the higherorder ones that involve pseudoknotted base pairs of various orders. It provides the classification of entanglements according to (25), visualizes them in the context of the entire RNA structure on the secondary and tertiary structure view, depicts intersection points of structural elements. Classification of entanglements supports distinguishing between potentially correct and abnormal conformations in the structures studied. Therefore, users can apply RNAspider to preliminary evaluate RNA 3D models generated by various prediction tools and eliminate non-physical ones. The RNAspider algorithm might also supplement the collection of validation and evaluation methods used in the RNA-Puzzles challenges (26\u201330). Finally, we propose its application in analyzing complex pseudoknotted RNAs \u2013 for example, those with unusual, knot-like folds."

            "text": "RNAspider begins its processing workflow with the validation and preparation of input data. It filters out any nonRNA chain, deletes surplus atoms in modified residues, and removes incomplete nucleotides. Then, it applies the incorporated RNApdbee algorithm (31) to extract the secondary structure and assign orders to pseudoknot-forming base\npairs (32). Results of these steps allow the computational engine of RNAspider to partition the input 3D model into open and closed structural elements. The former subset consists of coherent single-stranded fragments not closed by paired nucleotides, e.g. dangling ends. The latter contains elements closed by canonical base pairs \u2013 loops and dinucleotide steps.\nThe system computes a polygonal chain for each open and closed structural element. The chain connects points corresponding to selected atoms and pseudoatoms, i.e. centers of mass of nucleobases involved in base pairing. By definition, a polygonal chain encircles each closed element, which gets covered with a polygon mesh via a recursive triangulation procedure. RNAspider uses Mo\u0308ller\u2013Trumbore algorithm (33) to check every triangle for possible intersection site with a segment of some other polygonal chain. This step allows distinguishing between a puncturing and a punctured element and eventually classifying the entanglement.\nWe distinguish two entanglement topologies (Figure 1). Lasso \u2013 in RNAspider encoded using ( ) - consists of elements, in which one is only punctured, while the other only punctures. In interlace, represented by &, they do both to each other. Entangled elements are marked in the system using capital letters\u2013\u2013L stands for a loop, S for a single strand, and D for a dinucleotide step. Combining symbols from both groups allows us to describe entanglement classes, e.g. L&D denotes a loop interlaced with a dinucleotide step, L(S) is a loop lassoed over a single strand. The system additionally supports multiple punctures (Figure 2) \u2013 dots in the classification scheme represent extra punctures, e.g.L(S..) is a loop lassoed over a single strand that punctures it thrice (Figure 2C).\nRNAspider uses the concept of pseudoknot order (32,34) to distinguish between the core structure and the pseudoknotted base pairs. Initially, it only considers the core structure (non-pseudoknotted) and separates it into structural elements. At this stage, RNAspider treats nucleotides involved in pseudoknots as unpaired (so they get embedded inside loops and single strands) and detects primary entanglements. Thus, this type of entanglement is formed by structural elements that are not closed by pseudoknotted pairs. Next, the computational engine analyzes the input RNA structure separately for each pseudoknot order (increasingly to the user-selected value). Structural elements are constructed anew based on pseudoknotted base pairs of the current order. This time, nucleotides of the core structure might end up embedded inside. Such iterative procedure allows identifying higher-order entanglements defined upon long-distance, pseudoknotted base pairs. It runs by default unless switched off by the user selecting the Ignoring pseudoknots option in the advanced settings panel."

Also, the RNA-Puzzles community has challenged the prediction of the 3D structures of functionally essential RNA elements in\nthe SARS-CoV-2 genome, namely the 3\u2019- and 5\u2019-UTR (40). This initiative resulted in an ensemble of 100 RNA models, 25 of which contained entanglements (Supplementary Table S1). The latter include the RNAComposer-5UTR model obtained for the 268 nucleotide-long fragment of 5\u2032- UTR of the coronavirus genome. In this structure, RNAspider identified lasso type D(S) entanglement \u2013 the interdomain single-stranded fragment (U175\u2013U177) punctures the center of the dinucleotide step (U62\u2013U63, G160\u2013A161) (Figure 3). Such entanglement can be treated as incorrect geometry like all interlaces and lassos of type D(S) or L(S) with strand S that connects two helical regions and punctures a dinucleotide step or a loop between these regions. We suggest eliminating such RNA 3D models as unreliable.\nAs a second example, we present exoribonucleaseresistant RNA (xrRNA) from the flavivirus molecule. Its structure, determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB ID: 7K16, resolution 2.10 A\u030a) (41), contains an unusual fold, which \u2013 in the literature \u2013 is referred to as a knot-like fold or ring-like architecture (23,42). Such folds exhibit distinctive mechanical properties as revealed by experimental studies using force spectroscopy (23,24). So far, they have been identified in experimental structures of xrRNAs (PDB IDs: 5TPY, 7K16) and SARS-CoV-2 FSE (PDB IDs: 6XRZ, 7O7Z) (42) as well as in computational models of SARSCoV-2 FSE (43\u201346). The formation of a knot-like fold in the structure requires the presence of a pseudoknot. According to the RNAspider classification, the knot-like fold is a higher-order entanglement of the L(S) type \u2013 loop lassoing the single-stranded fragment is closed by pseudoknotted base pair(s). Thus, it can be identified if RNAspider runs with accepting pseudoknots option turned on (default settings). In the xrRNA structure, the loop \u2013 closed by base pair (G33-C49) of the first order \u2013 is punctured by the single strand (g1-G31) from the 5\u2032-end, intersection point between C4\u2019 in G2 and P in C3 (Figure 4). Note that 5\u2032-end is classified as a single-stranded element regarding the pseudoknot of the 1st order. Thus, in general, its residues may be involved in non-pseudoknot base pairs or pseudoknots of a different order."

Here, to complete the picture of entanglements in experimental structures, we have examined all RNAs available in the Protein Data Bank as of 2021-12- 13.\nFrom the initial set of 5804 RNA structures, we have excluded 11 false positives, that is, molecules with overlapping atoms misrecognized as punctures. Among 5793 instances left, we found 1307 (22%) entangled cases. Fifty-three structures have only primary entanglements, 1232 \u2013 only higherorder entanglements, and 22 have both types. Analysis of the results indicates a strong correlation between pseudoknot order and the number of entangled structural elements (0.711 Pearson\u2019s and 0.778 Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient). Also, the size of a molecule affects the formation of entanglements \u2013 the Person\u2019s correlation coefficient equals 0.812.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/W 1/W 663/6555428 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nA\nB\nC\nFigure 3.

Only 12% constitute interlaces, mainly from the L&L class. 3308 higher-order entanglements were found in 1254 structures from the input set. They consist almost entirely of the L(S) type arrangements. Detailed results of this analysis are available in Supplementary Table S2.\nWe hypothesize that interlaces and some lassos are incorrect geometries in molecule 3D models. However, PDB structures containing them should not be unreflectively considered wrong. We suggest their careful analysis to draw correct conclusions. For example, some entanglements in ex-\nperimental structures may result from two molecules having alternative conformations."
