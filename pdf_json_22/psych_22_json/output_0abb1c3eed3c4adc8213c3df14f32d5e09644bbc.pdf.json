    "abstractText": "In this study, we conducted the translation and validation of the K-SF-42 in Japan (Figueredo, 2017). The K-SF-42 is a new short form of the Arizona Life History Battery. We obtained empirical evidence that the original seven-factor structure could be applied to the Japanese translated version of K-SF-42 (K-SF-42-J). We also observed good internal consistency of the seven scales of K-SF-42-J. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis findings suggest that the K-SF-42-J can be used in both sexes and diverse age groups. The KSF-42-J scales showed similar correlates as the English original, with higher scores of other life history strategy measurement, trait emotional intelligence, well-being, and cultural and social resources in childhood. Use of the K-SF-42-J will allow researchers with Japanese speaking samples to integrate their findings with the existing life history strategy research literature. The brevity of the K-SF-42-J will be appealing to researchers who are concerned about taxing the time and motivation of their participants.",

We\nobtained empirical evidence that the original seven-factor structure could be applied to the\nJapanese translated version of K-SF-42 (K-SF-42-J). We also observed good internal con-\nsistency of the seven scales of K-SF-42-J. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis find-\nings suggest that the K-SF-42-J can be used in both sexes and diverse age groups. The K-\nSF-42-J scales showed similar correlates as the English original, with higher scores of other\nlife history strategy measurement, trait emotional intelligence, well-being, and cultural and\nsocial resources in childhood. Use of the K-SF-42-J will allow researchers with Japanese\nspeaking samples to integrate their findings with the existing life history strategy research lit-\nerature. The brevity of the K-SF-42-J will be appealing to researchers who are concerned\nabout taxing the time and motivation of their participants."

            "text": "In recent years, Life History Theory [1, 2] has produced novel and testable hypotheses in psychological research. Life history theory postulates that organisms optimally allocate their total bioenergetic and material resources between somatic effort and reproductive effort. The former is characterized by devoting resources to the continued survival and maintenance of the individual organism, and the latter is characterized by devoting resources to the reproduction and support of offspring. Furthermore, reproductive effort is divided into two components: mating effort and parental effort. Mating effort reflects resources consumed in obtaining and retaining sexual partners. Parental effort refers to using resources to enhance the survival of offspring.\nLife history theory was originally adopted by evolutionary biologists to explain phenotypic\nand behavioral differences between species. The contrast between r- and K-selected species [3] illustrates the variability of species-specific energy allocation based on life history theory. However, researchers have recently adopted life history theory to explain individual differences within species. The contrast between r-selected (also called fast life history) and K-selected (also called slow life history) strategies is evident in individual life history strategies.

The specific factors in a local environment (harsh or safe; unpredictable or predictable; and uncontrollable or controllable) have influences on adaption of life history strategies [5]. Individuals who are raised in a harsh, unpredictable, or uncontrollable environment tend to develop faster life history strategies. They will distribute their resources more toward mating effort than to the parental effort, and more toward reproductive effort than to the somatic effort. However, individuals who are raised in a safer, more predictable, or more controllable environment are likely to develop slower life history strategies. Where they allocate their resources more toward somatic effort than to the reproductive effort, and more toward parental effort than to the mating effort.\nThis concise theory produces many novel predictions about human behaviors throughout the lifetime, which have been empirically tested in multiple scientific disciplines [6]. Previous research has shown that life history strategies are associated with general health, personality, cognitive ability, social relationships, demographic variables, and so on [7\u201311]. As mentioned previously, individual differences in life history strategies are partly determined by specific factors of an early environment [5]. Based on such evidence, one can conclude that, life history theory is an encompassing integrative framework for understanding lifelong human development.\nTo make progress in research on human life history strategies, one must first establish a\npsychometrically valid measurement tool. Previous research has offered well-validated scales measuring human life history strategy. Figueredo developed a questionnaire, the Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB), which is designed to measure life history strategy in humans [12]. The ALHB derived from cognitive and behavioral scales of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) [13]. The ALHB is a 199-item psychometric questionnaire measuring human life history strategy. It contains seven broad life history domains: (a) insight, planning, and control; (b) mother/father relationship quality; (c) family social contact and support; (d) friends social contact and support; (e) romantic partner attachment; (f) general altruism; and (g) religiosity. These seven major domains could largely cover the areas of psychosocial resource investment in life history theory [14]. Based on the life history theory, a slower life history strategy reflects higher levels of these seven domains, and a faster life history strategy reflects lower levels of these seven domains."

            "text": "In addition to the seven major life history domains, the ALHB includes a short domain-general form that is designed to measure the overall life history strategy general factor directly. The short-form measure, entitled the Mini-K, is composed of two to three items on each of the seven domains associated with human life history strategy. Due to the Mini-K including only 20 items, it can be used to measure a general higher-order life history strategy without participants\u2019 response burden [14]. A recent meta-analytic study has shown convergent correlations between the Mini-K score and other related measures, including personality, cognitive ability, psychosomatic health, and social relationships, which supports its adequate construct validity [6]. In addition, the Mini-K has been utilized in different international samples, which shows that the Mini-K is a cross-culturally well-validated measurement [15\u201321].\nHowever, the Mini-K has two methodological shortcomings [22]. First, the internal consis-\ntency of the Mini-K was not adequate due to the relatively low number of its items (n = 20). This may also be due to the wide breadth of life history strategy construct that is being summarized by the single-scale Mini-K. Human life history strategy includes diverse components\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 2 / 23\nFunding: This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP17K13921.

As the Mini-K assesses all seven factors associated with life history theory by using 20 items, the item contents can inevitably become heterogeneous in content and internally inconsistent. Second, we couldn\u2019t obtain the subscale levels of the ALHB only using the Mini-K. As the Mini-K was designed to measure global life history strategy in a single dimension, it only includes a couple of items per each life history strategy domain. Figueredo et al. noted that it is not recommended to use the Mini-K when life history strategy is the main focus of the research [22]."

            "text": "According to Figueredo et al., the long-form ALHB is preferred to use in research which mainly focuses on life history strategy, as opposed to the short forms. However, the ALHB includes 199 items, which imposes a large response burden on the participants. Thus, a new short form of the ALHB was developed [22]. The K-SF-42, which consists of 42 items, derives from the ALHB. In the process of developing the K-SF-42, six items were selected from each of the seven domains of the ALHB. Previous research has shown its good reliability and validity, and its usefulness in psychological research [23\u201326]. By design, a high degree of cross-cultural validity was assured by sampling only the items that performed comparably well in different samples from Australia, Italy, Mexico, Singapore, and the USA, by selecting those with the highest cross-sample geometric mean part-whole item correlations from each subscale [22].\nCompared to the Mini-K, the K-SF-42 is a much better measurement. The structure of the\nK-SF-42 allows for researchers to obtain a subscale score for each of the seven subscales. The calculated seven scores maintain the breadth of life history strategy constructs [22]. To examine the detailed associations between life history strategy and other variables, calculating the seven life history strategy scores is very useful.\nUp to now, the Mini-K has been applied to cross-culturally diverse populations, which adequately supports its cross-cultural validity. However, the K-SF-42 has not been applied to samples as diverse as the Mini-K, since it is relatively new short-form scale. Specifically, the K-SF42 has been used in Asia, but only in Singapore [22]. To extend previous research on life history strategy, it is important to translate the K-SF-42 into other languages and test it on culturally diverse populations. Previously, a validated version of the K-SF-42 in Japanese was not available. Thus, the goal of this study is to translate the K-SF-42 into Japanese and to validate the translated version, for further use in future cross-cultural investigations."

            "text": "To this end, we translated the K-SF-42 into Japanese using the back-translation method [27]. Then we analyzed the factor structure of the Japanese version of K-SF-42 (K-SF-42-J). Considering the previous research findings [22], we expected that a seven-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model show a good fit to the data. In addition, because it is necessary to investigate the reliability and validity of the K-SF-42-J, we aimed to investigate its scale reliability in terms of internal consistency and its construct validity via nomological associations with related variables. In the K-SF-42-J items, the six items of romantic partner attachment are reverse-coded. The present study reverse-scored those six items to estimate secure adult romantic attachment. After doing this, individuals with slower life history strategy are expected to score higher in all seven life history strategy domains (insight, planning, and control; mother/father relationship quality; family social contact and support; friends social contact and support; romantic partner attachment; general altruism; and religiosity). The Mini-K score reflects a general higher-order life history strategy, it should be positively correlated with all the scores of K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 1\u20131). Additionally, Figueredo et al. have shown that K-\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 3 / 23\nfactor, which is extracted from the ALHB subscales, is highly positively correlated with general factors of personality and of covitality [8]. Based on this finding, we, therefore, expect that emotional intelligence, which is roughly equal to general factor of personality [28], and psychological well-being to be positively correlated with all the factor scores of K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 1\u20132). Moreover, development of life history strategy is affected by environment in early childhood [5, 29]. Hence, we can predict that the abundance of cultural and social resources in childhood is positively associated with all the factor scores of K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 1\u20133).\nIn addition to these, we can predict that the subscales of the K-SF-42-J are associated with\nthe following variables: effortful control; habitual exercise; procrastination; parenting styles of caregivers in childhood; social support; attachment style to their romantic partners; long-term mating orientation; unrestricted sociosexual orientation; altruistic behaviors; and spirituality. Effortful control reflects the core component of self-regulation and ability to inhibit prevailing behavior, as well as regulate emotional, behavioral, and physiological responses during this process [30]. Since individuals with slower life history strategy are characterized in part by the function of long-term survival and fostering long-term cooperative alliances, effortful control reflects the ability to inhibit prevailing behavior, to perform something that has to be done, and to regulate interrupting responses for the future is substantial for them. Specifically, among the seven subscales of the K-SF-42-J, we could predict the significant positive association between insight, planning, and control and effortful control (Hypothesis 2\u20131). Exercise denotes physical activity that is purposefully done to maintain or improve physical fitness [31]. As individuals with slower life history strategies tend to allocate their bioenergetic resources toward somatic effort, in conjunction with the previous research that has shown habitually engaging in exercise is associated with higher level of cognitive ability [32], we could expect that the significant positive association between insight, planning, and control and habitual exercise (Hypothesis 2\u20132).\nProcrastination is defined as the failure of self-control with intentional delay in some tasks that should be solved [33]. Procrastination has been negatively related to impulse control and pursuit of long-term goals. Previous research has shown that procrastination is part of a fast life history strategy [34]. Hence, we can hypothesize that procrastination is negatively associated with insight, planning, and control in the K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 2\u20133). Parental styles of caregivers affect their childrearing behaviors, which has an influence on the development of life history strategies [29]. Warm, affectionate, responsive, and supportive parenting style is linked to slower life history strategy of an individual\u2019s children, while, on the other hand, cold, affectionless, rejecting, and inconsistent parenting leads to faster life history strategy in an individual\u2019s children. Thus, we could predict that consistently sensitive attentive parenting style is positively associated with mother/father relationship quality, and that inconsistent and insensitive parenting style is negatively associated with mother/father relationship quality (Hypothesis 2\u20134).\nSocial support is defined as an instrumental and expressive assistance derived from inter-\npersonal relationships. Perceived social support could be provided by three specific sources\u2014 the family, friends, and significant others [35]. More perceived social support implies an individual derives from a supportive environment, which is related to slower life history strategy. With this in mind, we expect that social support from family members is positively associated with family social contact and support in the K-SF-42-J, and that social support from friends and significant others is positively associated with friends social contact and support in the K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 2\u20135).\nAdult attachment reflects the emotional bonds between romantic partners [36, 37]. Anxious\nattachment refers to a fear of being abandoned by one\u2019s romantic partner, and avoidant\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 4 / 23\nattachment denotes reluctance to be close to the significant person. Individuals with secure attachment show low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance. Those with insecure attachment score high in either attachment anxiety and avoidance, or both. Research has shown that secure attachment is linked to slow life history strategy, and that insecure attachment is linked to fast life history strategy [38]. In addition, adult romantic attachment somewhat reflects alternative reproductive strategies rather than attachment processes [39]. Specifically, a high level of avoidant attachment is positively linked to short-term mating orientation or unrestricted sociosexuality [40], and negatively lined to long-term mating orientation [41]. Based on these previous findings, attachment anxiety, avoidance, and unrestricted sociosexual orientation are expected to be negatively associated with romantic partner attachment (note that a higher score reflects more secure attachment after reverse-scoring), and long-term mating orientation is expected to be positively associated with romantic partner attachment (Hypothesis 2\u20136).\nAltruistic behavior is defined as behavior that provides benefits to others rather than the\nself, often at the sacrifice of one\u2019s own resources [42]. Previous research has shown that individuals with slower life history strategy tend to show more altruistic or prosocial behaviors [14], based on this we can predict that altruistic behavior is positively associated with general altruism in the K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 2\u20137).\nSpirituality has been defined as the search for the meaning and purpose in life and the exis-\ntence of the sacred [43]. Additionally, spirituality is dynamically interconnected with religiosity within the larger context of personal, social, and situational forces. Individuals with slower life history strategy are likely to show higher levels both in spirituality and religiosity [14]. Thus, spirituality is expected to positively correlate with religiosity in the K-SF-42-J (Hypothesis 2\u20138).\nTo test these hypotheses, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with six different samples\nof Japanese adults."

The procedure of translating the K-SF42 was as follows. First, the first and second authors of the present paper independently translated the K-SF-42 into Japanese and reconciled the translated sentences. Second, after the first and second author completed the translation, the K-SF-42-J was retranslated to English by translators and native English speakers, who are familiar with psychology, at a leading language service company (Crimson Interactive; http://www.crimsonjapan.co.jp/). Third, after receiving the reverse translation from the company, the first and last authors reconciled the differences between the original and reverse translated English sentences. Lastly, after some discussion regarding the translation, the K-SF-42-J was finalized. As with the original, the K-SF-42-J consisted of 42 items. The K-SF-42-J measures seven components of life history strategy\u2014insight, planning, and control; mother/father relationship quality; family social contact and support; friends social contact and support; romantic partner attachment; general altruism; and religiosity\u2014with six items for each component.

The K-SF42-J was applied to all participants (Samples A\u2212F).\nLife history strategy was also measured using the Japanese version of the Mini-K (Mini-\nK-J) [8, 18] in the Sample A. The Mini-K-J consists of 20 items and the participants in the Sample A answered each one using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from disagree strongly (\u22123) to agree strongly (3). A higher score refers to a slower life history strategy. Internal consistency of the Mini-K-J was adequate (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.87, 95%CI = [0.86, 0.88]).\nTrait emotional intelligence. Trait emotional intelligence was measured with the Japa-\nnese version of Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF) [44, 45] in the Sample A. The TEIQue-SF consists of 30 items that measures global trait emotional intelligence (EI), though it can also be used to measure the four subscales of trait EI (WellBeing, Self-Control, Emotionality, and Sociability). Since we aimed to investigate the associations between the subscales of the K-SF-42-J and global trait EI in the present study, we only calculated the score of global trait EI. Participants responded to the items using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) completely disagree to (7) completely agree. A higher score refers to a higher level of trait EI. Internal consistency of the TEIQue-SF was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.92, 95% CI = [0.91, 0.92]). The sample items of the TEIQue-SF are as follows: \u201cExpressing my emotions with words is not a problem for me,\u201d \u201cOn the whole, I\u2019m pleased with my life,\u201d \u201cOn the whole, I\u2019m able to deal with stress,\u201d and \u201cI can deal effectively with people.\u201d\nPsychological well-being. Psychological well-being was measured with the WHO5 Well-\nbeing Index [46] in Sample D. This study used the authorized Japanese translations of the WHO5 (https://www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/who-5/Pages/default.aspx). To explore mood and daily behaviors during the previous two weeks, participants were asked to rate on a six-point Likert scale ranging from (0) at no time to (5) all of the time. A higher score reflects a higher level of psychological well-being. Internal consistency of the WHO5 was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.91, 95%CI = [0.90 0.92]). The sample items of the WHO5 are as follows: \u201cI have felt cheerful and in good spirits\u201d and \u201cI have felt active and vigorous.\u201d\nCultural and social resources in childhood. Cultural and social resources (CSR) in childhood were measured with 10 items collected from previous research in Japan [47] in Sample B. Six of the ten items measured the richness of cultural activities and cultural assets, and the remaining four items measured the richness of social relationships in childhood. The cultural resource items included the following: \u201cMy parents often read books to me,\u201d \u201cMy parents often read books or newspapers,\u201d \u201cMy parents made homemade sweets at home,\u201d \u201cMy parents took me to a museum,\u201d \u201cMy parents often listened to classical music,\u201d and \u201cThere were a lot of books (excluding magazines and comics) in the house.\u201d The social resource items included the following: \u201cI talked with my family about what happened at daycare, kindergarten, or elementary school,\u201d \u201cIt was fun to meet my friends at daycare, kindergarten, or elementary school,\u201d \u201cI usually eat dinner with my family on a weekday,\u201d and \u201cI often took part in local events and festivals.\u201d Participants were asked to answer the CSR items as follows: \u201cPlease remember your childhood (nursery school, kindergarten, and elementary school). The following items ask about your childhood. Please select the applicable options.\u201d The CSR items were answered on a fourpoint Likert scale ranging from (0) not true at all to (3) very true. The cultural resource and social resource scores were calculated by summing the six-item and four-item responses, respectively. High scores reflect that they had more cultural and social resources during their childhood. Internal reliabilities of the CSR items were acceptable (\u03b1 = 0.75, 95%CI = [0.73, 0.77] for cultural resources; \u03b1 = 0.78, 95%CI = [0.76, 0.79] for social resources).\nEffortful control. Effortful control was measured with the Japanese version of Effortful\nControl Scale for Adults (ECSA) [48, 49] in Sample D. The ECSA consists of 35 items measuring global effortful control, though it can also be used to measure the three subscales:\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 7 / 23\ninhibitory control, activation control, and attentional control. As we aimed to investigate the associations between insight, planning, and control of the K-SF-42-J and global effortful control in this study, we only calculated the score of global effortful control. Participants answered the items using a four-point Likert scale ranging from (1) not very true of me to (4) very true of me. A higher score refers to a higher level of effortful control. Internal consistency of the ECSA was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.89, 95%CI = [0.88, 0.90]). The sample items of the ECSA are as follows: \u201cWhen I am trying to focus my attention, I am easily distracted,\u201d \u201cIt is easy for me to hold back my laughter in a situation when laughter wouldn\u2019t be appropriate,\u201d \u201cAs soon as I have decided upon a difficult plan of action, I begin to carry it out,\u201d and \u201cWhen interrupted or distracted, I usually can easily shift my attention back to whatever I was doing before.\u201d\nHabitual exercise. Habitual engagement in exercise was measured with the Japanese ver-\nsion of the Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity Habit Strength Scale (MVPA-HSS) [50, 51] in Sample C. This scale consists of 17 items that are rated on a six-point Likert scale ranging from (1) not true for me to (6) very true for me. A higher score reflects a higher level of habitual engagement in exercise. Internal consistency of this scale was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.97, 95% CI = [0.97, 0.97]). The sample items of the MVPA-HSS are as follows: \u201cIf I don\u2019t exercise I feel restless,\u201d \u201cI exercise for the same amount of time in each session,\u201d \u201cSeeing other people exercise motivates me to be more active,\u201d and \u201cI exercise without having to think about it.\u201d\nProcrastination. Procrastination was measured using the Japanese version of General\nProcrastination Scale (GPS) [52, 53] in Sample C. Though the original GPS consists of 20 items, Hayashi reduced them to 13 items in the development of its Japanese version based on the factor loadings in the factor analysis [53]. The 13-item Japanese version of GPS was rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. A higher score refers to a higher level of procrastination tendency. Internal consistency of the GPS was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.87, 95%CI = [0.86, 0.88]). The sample items of the GPS are as follows: \u201cI often find myself performing tasks that I had intended to do days before\u201d and \u201cI generally delay before starting on work I have to do.\u201d\nParental styles of caregivers. Parental styles of caregivers were measured using the Japa-\nnese version of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) [54, 55] in Sample B. The PBI contains 25 items that retrospectively measure the parental attitude of caregivers. It consists of two factors: care and over-protection. A high score on the care factor reflects supportive parenting attitudes, whereas a high score on the over-protective factor refers to unfavorable parenting attitudes. This measure asked the participants to report the attitudes of their childhood caregivers on a four-point Likert scale ranging from (0) not true at all to (3) very true. Internal consistency of each subscale was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.93, 95% CI = [0.92, 0.93] for Care; \u03b1 = 0.86, 95% CI = [0.84, 0.87] for Over-protection). The sample items of the PBI are as follows: \u201cSpoke to me in a warm and friendly voice\u201d and \u201cTried to control everything I did.\u201d\nSocial support. Social support was measured with the Japanese version of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) [35, 56] in Sample F. The MSPSS is a 12-item scale measuring perceived support from family, friends, and significant others. Participants answered the items on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. Higher scores reflect more social support from family, friends, and significant others. Internal consistency of each subscale was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.95, 0.96] for family; \u03b1 = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.95, 0.96] for friends; \u03b1 = 0.94, 95% CI = [0.94, 0.95] for significant others). The sample items of the MSPSS are as follows: \u201cMy family really tries to help me,\u201d \u201cI can count on my friends when things go wrong,\u201d and \u201cThere is a special person who is around when I am in need.\u201d\nAdult attachment. Attachment style to a romantic partner was measured using the Japa-\nnese version of the Experience in Close Relationship-Relationship Structure (ECR-RS) [57, 58]\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 8 / 23\nin Sample E. This scale consists of 9 items and was rated on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. Six items of the nine measured attachment avoidance dimension, and the remaining three items measured the attachment anxiety dimension. Higher scores reflect higher level of attachment anxiety and avoidance, that is, more insecure attachment. Internal consistency was acceptable (\u03b1 = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.95, 0.96] for attachment anxiety; \u03b1 = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.83, 0.86] for the attachment avoidance). The sample items of the ECR-RS are as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable opening up to this person\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m afraid that this person may abandon me.\u201d\nSociosexual orientation. Sociosexual orientation was measured with the Japanese version\nof the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) [59, 60] in Sample E. The SOI-R consists of 9 items measuring global sociosexual orientation, though it can also be used to measure the three subscales: sociosexual attitude, sociosexual behavior, and sociosexual desire. Because we aimed to investigate the associations between romantic partner attachment of the K-SF-42-J and global sociosexual orientation in this study, we only calculated the total score of unrestricted sociosexuality. This scale asked the participants to answer the SOI-R on a ninepoint Likert scale. A higher score reflects higher level of unrestricted sociosexuality. Internal consistency was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.87, 95% CI = [0.85, 0.88]). The sample items of the SOI-R are as follows: \u201cWith how many different partners have you had sex within the past 12 months,\u201d \u201cI can imagine myself being comfortable and enjoying \"casual\" sex with different partners,\u201d and \u201cIn everyday life, how often do you have spontaneous fantasies about having sex with someone you have just met.\u201d\nLong-term mating orientation. Long-term mating orientation was measured with the\nJapanese version of the long-term mating orientation scale (LTMO) [41, 61] in Sample E. The LTMO contains 7 items and was rated on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. A higher score reflects higher level of long-term mating orientation. Internal consistency was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.92, 95% CI = [0.91, 0.92]). The sample items of the LTMO are as follows: \u201cI am interested in maintaining a long-term romantic relationship with someone special\u201d and \u201cI would like to have a romantic relationship that lasts forever.\u201d\nAltruistic behavior. Altruistic behavior was measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale Distinguished by the Recipient (SRAS-DR) [62] in Sample F. The scale consists of 21 items, including measures for altruistic behaviors toward three different targets: family members, friends/acquaintances, and strangers. Each of the three subscales includes 7 items. Participants were asked to answer the scale using a five-point Likert scale ranging from (1) never to (5) very often. A higher score represents higher frequency of each altruistic behavior. Internal consistency of each subscale was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.90, 95% CI = [0.89, 0.90] for family members; \u03b1 = 0.86, 95% CI = [0.85, 0.87] for friends/acquaintances; \u03b1 = 0.90, 95% CI = [0.89, 0.91] for strangers). The sample items of the SRAS-DR are as follows: \u201cI listen to the problems and complaints of friends or acquaintances,\u201d \u201cI help a family member when he/she is not feeling well,\u201d and \u201cWhen a stranger is looking for something, I talk to her/him.\u201d\nSpirituality. Spirituality was measured with the Self-Transcendence Scale (STS) [63] in\nSample C. The STS contains 18 items and was rated on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) disagree to (5) agree. A higher score reflects higher level of spirituality. Internal consistency was adequate (\u03b1 = 0.94, 95% CI = [0.94, 0.95]). The sample items of the STS are as follows: \u201cI think that we are tied with invisible bonds,\u201d \u201cEven if I die, I think I can live as a part of nature,\u201d \u201cI feel that I was born in this world and it has a great meaning,\u201d and \u201cI would like to share my joy and suffering with many people.\u201d\nDemographic information. We asked about the participants\u2019 age (continuous) and sex\n(0 = Men, 1 = Women).\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 9 / 23"

            "text": "First, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the seven-factor structure of the original K-SF-42. We assessed the factor structure (one-factor or seven-factor model) of the K-SF-42-J for all the participants. We evaluated the model fit of the current CFA model using the Bentler-Bonett Comparative fit index (CFI) [64], Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) [65], Root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) [66], and standardized root meansquare residual (SRMR) [67]. Values of CFI and TLI greater than 0.90 are considered satisfactory levels of practical goodness-of-fit; RMSEA values of 0.06 or less are considered indications of good fit, values between 0.06 and 0.08 are considered indications of a mediocre fit, and values greater than 0.08 are considered indications of a poor fit; and SRMR values of 0.08 or less are considered indications of good fit, values between 0.08 and 0.10 are considered indications of a mediocre fit, and values greater than 0.10 are considered indications of a poor fit [68].\nSince the total sample included a sample of men and women with a wide range of ages, from\n20 to 59 years old, a multi-group CFA was also conducted on the K-SF-42-J, with the sample split by sex and age groups, to assess measurement invariance. The sample was split into two sex groups (men and women) and four age groups (20\u201329, 30\u201339, 40\u201349 and 50\u201359 years old), and we fitted configural, metric/weak (factor loading equality constraint), scalar/strong (factor loading and intercept equality constraint), and strict invariance models (factor loading, intercept, and residuals equality constraint) using a multi-group CFA approach [69]. Since the chi-square test is highly sensitive to sample size, we preferentially referred to both the absolute and the relative fit indices for model comparison. The absolute fit indices include CFI [64], TLI [65], RMSEA [66], and SRMR [67]. According to Chen, a decrease of less than 0.010 for CFI, an increase of less than 0.015 for RMSEA, or an increase of less than 0.030 for SRMR implies significant deterioration in model fit under testing of measurement invariance [70]. In addition, when testing scalar or strict invariance, that is at the intercept and residual variance levels, an increase of less than 0.010 is recommended for SRMR. The relative fit indices include Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) [71] and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [72]. Both the AIC and BIC provide some advantages; for example, AIC is when dealing with potential model over-fitting, as is often the case with analyses with small sample sizes [73]. Alternatively, BIC is recommended for more conservative model comparisons [74]. Since AIC and BIC have different advantages, it is generally convenient to conduct a model comparison with both fit indices. It is also worth noting that even though the model selection is based on lower AIC and BIC values, additional estimates should be computed, such as the difference (i.e., delta) between the model with the lowest AIC/BIC value and the competing models. Moreover, AIC weights and BIC weights should also be estimated. These metrics indicate the likelihood that at least one of the models under consideration is the best model.\nThen we investigated the internal consistency and validity of the K-SF-42-J. The internal\nconsistency of each K-SF-42-J subscale was checked using the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient. Regarding the validity, we conducted the correlation analyses among related variables to show nomological network of the K-SF-42-J. All analyses were carried out in R 3.5.3, an open source statistical software environment. The lavaan package [75] was used for the CFA in structural equation modeling. The package qpcR was used for computing AIC weights and BIC weights [76]. The present data and R code were openly available at<https://osf.io/3nmxv/>."

            "text": "Confirmatory factor analysis on the K-SF-42-J and measurement invariance\nBefore conducting the CFA, we reversed the item scores of problems in romantic partner attachment in the K-SF-42-J to estimate secure adult romantic attachment. And we also\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 10 / 23\nstandardized each item score into z score (Mean = 0, SD = 1) using its mean and standard deviation. After that, we tried to replicate the seven-factor structure of the original K-SF-42. In the replication of original factor structure, we compared the seven-factor (original) with the onefactor model, which is assumed in the Mini-K, to exclude the possibility that a general life history strategy factor largely accounted for the variances of item responses. The CFA of the K-SF-42-J scores indicated that the seven-factor model showed a better fit than the one-factor model (\u03c72 = 8293.542, df = 798, p< 0.001; CFI = 0.850; TLI = 0.838; RMSEA = 0.081; and SRMR = 0.065 for the seven-factor model; \u03c72 = 33085.324; df = 819; p< 0.001; CFI = 0.355; TLI = 0.322; RMSEA = 0.165; SRMR = 0.163 for the one-factor model). Though the RMSEA and the SRMR of the seven-factor model were acceptable for the cut-off criteria [68], the CFI and the TLI were not adequate. The modification indices suggested residual covariances between the unique variance of items 5 and 6 (in Insight factor), items 7 and 8 (in Altruism factor), items 11 and 12 (in Altruism factor), items 25 and 26 (in Parent factor), and items 32 and 33 (in Family factor). The present study modified the tested seven-factor model by adding the five residual covariances. The modified seven-factor model showed an acceptable fit (CFI = 0.912; TLI = 0.904; RMSEA = 0.062; and SRMR = 0.064). In the seven-factor model, all standardized factor loadings were over 0.4 (0.426\u22120.916). The detailed parameter estimates of factor loadings in the seven-factor model are shown in Table 2. All seven factors were positively and significantly correlated with each other. The detailed inter-factor correlations are provided in Table 3.\nHistorically, since the K-Factor was first introduced [7], it has always shown a latent hierarchical structure, with a general factor at the apex of that hierarchy [77, 78]. This is not the same thing as a \u201csingle, unidimensional K-factor,\u201d but instead what was actually reported on numerous occasions [7, 8]. We therefore performed a higher-order factor analysis based on the interfactor correlation data among the lower-order factors presented in Table 3. As expected, we did find a general, higher-order K-Factor underlying all these lower-order factors that explained 81% of their reliable variance, and featuring the following factor loadings of the higher-order factor on these lower-order indicators. The detailed factor loadings are shown in Table 4.\nMulti-group CFA was conducted on the modified seven-factor model to assess measurement\ninvariance across sexes (Men vs. Women) and age groups (20s, 30s, 40s, vs. 50s). The detailed model fit indices are shown in Table 5. The model comparison for multi-group measurement invariance between men and women revealed that the metric invariance was supported in accordance to the minimum values of AIC and RMSEA, the maximum value of TLI, and a sizeable AIC weight. It is also worth noting that the scalar invariance was supported based on the minimum BIC value and the perfect BIC weight. Based on the cutoff values of change in model fit indices for measurement invariance test [70], the present results supported strict invariance of the K-SF-42-J across sexes (\u0394CFIs< 0.010; \u0394TLIs< 0.010; \u0394RMSEAs< 0.010; and \u0394SRMRs\ufffd 0.010). The model comparison for multi-group measurement invariance across age groups revealed that the scalar invariance was supported in accordance to the minimum values of AIC and RMSEA, the maximum value of TLI, and the perfect AIC weight. Furthermore, the strict invariance was supported based on the minimum BIC value and the perfect BIC weight. Based on the cutoff values of change in model fit indices for measurement invariance test [70], the present results supported strict invariance of the K-SF-42-J across age groups (\u0394CFIs< 0.010; \u0394TLIs< 0.010; \u0394RMSEAs< 0.010; and \u0394SRMRs< 0.010)."

Its descriptive statistics are also shown in Table 6. Then, we calculated the internal consistency indices of the subscales of K-SF-42-J after standardizing each K-SF-42-J item score into z score. All the subscales showed good internal consistency coefficients (Table 3).\nCorrelation analysis between the K-SF-42-J and related measures\nCorrelation analyses were conducted to show the validity of the K-SF-42-J. Regarding the associations with demographic variables, Insight, planning, and control was positively and significantly correlated with age, and Mother/father relationship quality, Family social contact and support, and Friends social contact and support were inversely and significantly correlated with age. In addition, women scored significantly higher than men in Family social contact and support, Friends social contact and support, and Romantic partner attachment. The general K-Factor score was negatively significantly correlated with age. Its average score for women was slightly higher than that for men. The detailed associations with demographic variables are presented in Table 7. The K-SF-42-J subscale scores were weakly to moderately correlated in positive direction with the Mini-K-J score, trait EI, well-being, and cultural and social resources except for the correlations between religiosity and trait EI and social resources. The general K-Factor score was moderately to highly correlated with these variables with positive direction. The detailed correlation coefficients are shown in Table 8.\nWe subsequently examined the associations of each subscale in the K-SF-42-J with related\nvariables. Insight, planning, and control in the K-SF-42-J was positively and significantly correlated with effortful control and habitual exercise and was negatively and significantly correlated with procrastination. Mother/father relationship quality was positively and significantly associated with care factor in parental attitudes, which reflects supportive and favorable parental style, and was negatively and significantly associated with over-protection factor in parental attitudes, which reflects negative unfavorable parenting style.

General altruism in the K-SF-42-J was positively and significantly linked to altruistic behaviors. Religiosity was positively and significantly related to spirituality. The general K-Factor score was positively and significantly correlated with effortful control, habitual exercise, care factor in parental attitudes, social supports from family members, friends, and significant others, altruistic behaviors, and spirituality.

            "text": "The present study provides evidence for the internal consistency and validity of the Japanese version of the K-SF-42, a measurement of human life history strategy. Based on the CFA results, seven-factor structure was acceptably fitted to the present data from the K-SF-42-J, which supports its factor validity. Inter-factor correlations were statistically significant in the positive direction. These correlations and good fit of seven-factor model to the observed data suggest that the seven life history strategy domains are valid in the Japanese population. In addition, multi-group CFA demonstrated scalar/strong measurement invariance of the K-SF42-J over the participants\u2019 sexes and age groups, which suggests that the translation of the K-SF-42 into Japanese did not limit the measurement validity of the instrument as it generalizes well across sex and age group. Moreover, the internal consistency reliabilities of K-SF-42-J subscales ranged from 0.86 to 0.96, which are consistent with the original version [22]. These findings suggest that theK-SF-42-J is empirically validated for use in Japanese samples, enabling researchers to conduct further cross-cultural comparisons with Western national samples.\nAll validity measures that were used in the present study mirrored previous research on life\nhistory theory and the meta-analytic findings from Figueredo et al. [6]. All seven subscale scores and the general K-Factor score showed significant and positive correlations with the Mini-K score, trait EI, psychological well-being, and cultural and social resources in childhood, except for those of religiosity with trait EI and social resources. These results generally support the present hypotheses 1\u20131, 1\u20132, and 1\u20133. Regarding religiosity in the K-SF-42-J, further replication is required. Japanese people tend to freely enjoy and practice different religious customs, traditions, and rituals including celebration of Christmas day, Festival of the Dead (Obon), first shrine visit of the New Year, and commemorating the dead in Buddhist temples"

A large part of the Japanese people do not believe in any specific religion [80] and consider religion to be unimportant to them [81]. Hence, religiosity in Japanese people could be different from that in other countries.\nIn the seven K-SF-42-J subscales, insight, planning, and control showed positive correlations with effortful control and habitual exercise and negative correlation with procrastination. This supports hypotheses 2\u20131, 2\u20132, and 2\u20133., engagement in habitual exercise was positively and significantly related to all subscales except for romantic partner attachment. Engagement in habitual exercise can be considered to as allocating more bioenergetic and material resources into somatic effort, which are characteristics of slow life history strategy. The positive correlations between habitual exercise and the K-SF-42-J subscales strongly support the validity of K-SF-42-J.\nNote. a K-Factor score was calculated as a unit-weighted factor score using the means of the standardized sub-scale scores. Its range represents the actual range of the score.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217.t006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 16 / 23\nAs for care and over-protection factors of parenting attitudes, mother/father relationship quality was positively linked to the former and negatively linked to the latter. This is consistent with the present hypothesis 2\u20134 and supports the validity of mother/father relationship quality subscale. In addition, care and over-protection factors of parental attitudes are also significantly associated with family social contact and support in the positive and negative direction, respectively. These associations imply that people who received warm, supportive, and favorable parental investments in their childhood tend to have more contact with and support from their family members now, and that people who received cold, harsh, and unfavorable parenting in their childhood tend to have less contact with and support from their family members now. These associations are consistent with predictions from life history theory, which further supports the K-SF-42-J\u2019s validity.\nAs we expected, family social contact and support showed a positive correlation with social support from family members and friends social contact and support showed positive correlation with social support from friends and significant others. These associations are consistent\nNote. 95%CIs for correlations are presented in parentheses. n = 781 for men and n = 659 for women.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217.t007\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217.t008\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 17 / 23\nwith the present hypothesis 2\u20135 and support the validity of the two subscales. Additionally, social support from family members, friends, and significant others were positively and significantly correlated with all K-SF-42-J subscales. Individuals with slow life history strategy are considered to have more favorable environments in which they can be helped from other people. The observed associations between social supports and the K-SF-42-J are consistent with this notion and support its validity.\nRegarding romantic partner attachment, we observed a positive correlation with long-term mating orientation and negative correlation with attachment anxiety, avoidance, and unrestricted sociosexual orientation. These observed correlations are consistent with the hypothesis 2\u20136. Individuals who score high in this subscale have secure attachment style. As previous research has repeatedly shown, secure attachment is linked to the orientation toward longterm, restricted mating orientation. Thus, the present findings are consistent with those findings and support its validity.\nGeneral altruism showed a positive correlation with altruistic behaviors, which is consistent with the present hypothesis 2\u20137. In addition, altruistic behaviors are positively correlated with all K-SF-42-J subscales. As people who have slow life history strategy tend to develop longterm cooperative relationships, the observed positive correlations between altruistic behaviors and the K-SF-42-J subscales support the construct validity of the K-SF-42-J.\nAlthough religiosity in Japanese people might be slightly different from those in other countries [79\u201381], religiosity was positively linked to spirituality. This association is consistent with\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274217 September 16, 2022 18 / 23\nthe hypothesis 2\u20138 and supports its validity. As with altruistic behaviors, spirituality was positively associated with all K-SF-42-J subscale scores. Previous research has shown that spirituality is positively correlated with high self-esteem, future-oriented time perspective, and less loneliness feelings [63]. High self-esteem, future-oriented time perspective, and less loneliness feelings are all characteristics of slow life history indicators [6]. Therefore, it is not surprising that spirituality associates with all K-SF-42-J subscales. Rather, these positive associations support further validation of the K-SF- 42-J.\nThe general K-Factor score was significantly associated with many related variables (see,\nTables 7 and 8). Although the K-Factor score was not associated with procrastination, anxious attachment style, and sociosexuality, those observed correlations were generally consistent with the life history theory. This means that the K-SF-42-J is a nice, concise, and well-validated measurement of life history strategies.\nAlthough the K-SF-42-J seems to be useful to measure slow life history strategy in Japanese adults, the present study also has some limitations that should be considered. First, the surveys were conducted online, and the participants were recruited in single research panel. Therefore, the present study sample cannot be considered representative of the Japanese population. However, since the proportion of Japanese people using internet is approximately 80% according to the latest Communications Usage Trend Survey in Japan [82], we believe that the present sample was not too biased. Second, the K-SF-42-J reliability was assessed only in terms of internal consistency using Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient. It is better to evaluate the test-retest reliability to assess the temporal stability of the K-SF-42-J. Finally, there are many other variables that were not used in the present study for investigating the nomological network of K-SF42-J. As the validation of psychometric scale cannot be finished in one study we should replicate and extend the present findings of the K-SF-42-J. For example, we might investigate the associations between the K-SF-42-J and other psychometric life history instruments, such as the Life History Rating Form developed by Dunkel et al [83]."

Obtained findings suggest that the Japanese version of K-SF-42 has good internal consistency and abundant validity of life history strategy measurement. Cross-cultural study is very important in evolutionary psychological research. The K-SF-42-J developed in the present study enable us to conduct cross-cultural comparisons in life history research, which can further extend the previous findings."
