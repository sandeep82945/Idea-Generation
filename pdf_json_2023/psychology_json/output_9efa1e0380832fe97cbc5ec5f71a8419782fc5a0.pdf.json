    "abstractText": "Natural polysaccharides are macromolecular substances with a wide range of biological activities. The structural modification of polysaccharides by chemical means can enhance their biological activity. This paper reviews the latest research reports on the chemical modification of natural polysaccharides. At present, the modification methods of polysaccharides mainly include sulfation, phosphorylation, carboxymethylation, socialization, methylation and acetylation. The chemical and physical structures of the modified polysaccharides were detected via ultraviolet spectroscopy, FT-IR, high-performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet spectroscopy, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning electron microscopy. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the modified polysaccharide has various biological activities, such as antioxidant, antitumor, immune regulation, antiviral, antibacterial and anticoagulant functions in vitro. This review provides fresh ideas for the research and application of polysaccharide structure modification.",

            "text": "Polysaccharides are macromolecular polymers widely found in plants, animals and microorganisms [1]. Polysaccharides generally consist of more than 10 monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds in linear or branched chains [2]. Polysaccharides composed of the same monosaccharides are called homopolysaccharides, such as starch [3]. Polysaccharides composed of different monosaccharides are called heteropolysaccharides, such as gum arabic, which is composed of pentose and galactose. Polysaccharides are generally insoluble in water, have no sweet taste, cannot form crystals, and have no reduction or mutarotation. At present, polysaccharide extraction methods include hot water extraction, acid extraction, alkali extraction and enzyme extraction [4]. A large number of studies have shown that polysaccsharides have anti-oxidation [5], anti-tumor [6], anti-coagulation [7], anti-cancer [8], hypoglycemic [9] and immunomodulatory activities [10]. This wide range of biological activities suggests that polysaccharides have potentially great advantages in the fields of food and medicine. Various natural polysaccharides exhibit only weak biological activity. Therefore, in order to expand the biological activity of natural polysaccharides, the method of chemical modification is used to change their chemical structure and conformation [11,12]. At present, the modification methods of polysaccharides mainly include sulfation, phosphorylation, carboxymethylation, socialization, methylation and acetylation.

Different modification methods produce different degrees of substitution (DS) and have different effects on activity [14]. Cyclodextrins are naturally occurring, non-toxic and biodegradable cyclic oligosaccharides [15\u201317]. Although many cyclodextrin derivatives are commercially available, their prices are in the range of those of fine chemicals and, therefore, they are still often synthesized in laboratories [18\u201320]. Modifying already substituted cyclodextrins with appropriate functional groups is much easier than optimizing the substitution for each desired new cyclodextrin derivative [21]. Therefore, artificial polysaccharides such as cyclodextrin also need to undergo structural modification to increase their biological activity. The structural modification of natural polysaccharides provides additional ideas and possibilities for the application of polysaccharides.

Chlorosulfonic Acid\u2013Pyridine Method\nThe chlorosulfonic acid\u2013pyridine method is the most commonly used sulfation method [24]. The sulfonated reagent is prepared in a low-temperature environment by adding a specific\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5416 3 of 17\nproportion of chlorosulfonic acid dropwise into anhydrous pyridine and stirring it continuously. The polysaccharide powder is stirred and dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, and then the surrounding reagent is added. After the reaction, the pH is adjusted to 7 with NaOH. Precipitation with alcohol, dialysis and lyophilization is performed to obtain the sulfated polysaccharides [23]. The DS of sulfated polysaccharides is affected by the ratio of the reagents, reaction time and temperature [10]. The reaction temperature has a greater influence, followed by the reaction time and the ratio of the sulfonated reagents [11]. The DS can be increased via the microwave-assisted synthesis of sulfated polysaccharides [25]. 4- Dimethylaminopyridine/dimethyl cyclohexyl carbodiimide, as a catalyst for the sulfonation of Artemisia polysaccharides, can improve the increase in the DS. In the process of sulfonation, polysaccharides are easily decomposed under high-temperature and acidic conditions, resulting in a decrease in the yield of sulfation. The yield and DS of sulfated polysaccharides prepared using the chlorosulfonic acid\u2013pyridine method are high, this being a commonly used preparation method.\n2.1.2. Concentrated Sulfuric Acid Method\nThe preparation process of the concentrated sulfuric acid method is similar to the preparation of the chlorosulfonic acid\u2013pyridine method [26]. Concentrated sulfuric acid and pyridine were mixed in proportion to prepare an esterification reagent and stirred with n-butanol in an ice water bath. Then, ammonium sulfate was added to the reaction system, and polysaccharide powder was slowly added after mixing. The reactant was reacted at room temperature for 3 h, and the pH was adjusted to 7 with ice NaOH. Ethanol was added to precipitate the sulfated polysaccharides, and the precipitate was collected via centrifugation, dialyzed and freeze-dried to obtain the sulfated polysaccharides [10,11]. Cordyceps gunnii mycelium polysaccharides were used to prepare sulfated polysaccharides using a concentrated sulfuric acid method, and after infrared analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, it was proved that the sulfated polysaccharides were successful [27]. Compared with the chlorosulfonic acid\u2013pyridine method, the concentrated sulfuric acid method has the characteristics of safe reagents. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the polysaccharides are easily degraded and carbonized by the concentrated sulfuric acid.\n2.1.3. Sulfur Trioxide\u2013Pyridine Method\nThe sulfur trioxide\u2013pyridine method is an effective method for the sulfation of polysaccharides, and the sulfate group is provided by SO3. It involves incorporating SO3 into pyridine to prepare an esterification reagent, dissolving polysaccharide powder in N,Ndimethylformamide, and adding the polysaccharide N,N-dimethylformamide solution to the esterification reagent. After stirring for 3 h, the pH is adjusted with NaOH and precipitated with ethanol to obtain the sulfated polysaccharides [28]. The preparation of the sulfated polysaccharides from Lycium barbarum polysaccharides is performed using a sulfur trioxide\u2013pyridine esterification reagent in N,N-dimethylformamide. The reagents of the sulfur trioxide\u2013pyridine method are dangerous, and the storage of SO3 limits the scope of application of the method to a certain extent."

High-performance gel permeation chromatography can be used to analyze not only the molecular weight of polysaccharides but also the homogeneity of polysaccharides [61]. When the homogeneous polysaccharide is detected, it has a symmetrical elution curve, which provides a stable premise for later analysis using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.\n3.2.4. Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry\nThe connection mode of monosaccharides in the polysaccharide chain is the basis for analyzing the structure\u2013activity relationship of polysaccharides, which can provide a clearer understanding of the structure of polysaccharides [62]. The polysaccharide is modified via methylation, and all the hydroxyl groups in the polysaccharide chain are replaced. Polysaccharide chains are hydrolyzed into individual fragments using volatile acid solutions. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry is used to analyze the hydrolyzed polysaccharide fragments and resolve the linking sites of each sugar chain. When polysaccharides are acid-hydrolyzed, they can be divided in two ways: complete acid hydrolysis and partial acid hydrolysis. More sugar chains can be obtained using complete acid hydrolysis, and more connection information can also be obtained. However, the location of the complete acid hydrolytic cleavage is uncertain, which may lead to hydrolysis of the structure of the monosaccharide, causing errors in the structural analysis. Partial acid hydrolysis is a milder mode of cleavage, involving the breakage of only the attachment sites of the unstable points in the polysaccharide chain. Although there are fewer ways to obtain monosaccharide chain connections, there will be fewer errors."

According to the monosaccharide composition, the one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum was used to analyze the relevant chemical shift, combined with the twodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum to analyze the relationship between 13C1H and 1H-1H. Finally, the linking sites between the monosaccharides were determined to obtain the accurate structure of the modified polysaccharides. By comparing the structural changes in the polysaccharides before and after modification, the reasons for the changes in their biological activities were analyzed, which laid the foundation for the study of the chemical modification of the polysaccharides (Figure 9).\n3.2.6. Scanning Electron Microscopy\nIn order to observe the surface structure of a modified polysaccharide more clearly, it can be observed using a scanning electron microscope. Different surface morphologies will have different degrees of influence on polysaccharide physical properties. Sulfation and phosphorylation may cause the hydrolysis and cross\u2014linking of glycosidic bonds due to their acidic environment, resulting in changes in the connection of glycosidic bonds [53]. 13C NMR is widely used in the structural analysis of polysaccharides.

For patients with cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis and stroke, anticoagulants can prevent the formation of blood clots and maintain health [11]. Coagulation assays based on thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and thrombin time are used to assess anticoagulant activity. Some sulfated polysaccharides have anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects and are nontoxic to normal cells. Heparin is a kind of sulfated polysaccharide, which is widely used clinically as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic agent [89]. Sulfated polysaccharides exhibit anticoagulant activity mainly through the strong negative charge of their sulfate groups and the positively charged amino acid residues on their coagulation factors through ionic interactions [90].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5416 13 of 17\nIn general, the anticoagulant properties of sulfated polysaccharides are related to the percentage of sulfate, while the anticoagulant properties of phosphorylated polysaccharides are related to the increase in molecular weight, inversely proportional to the percentage of phosphate [91]. Phosphorylated tan ink polysaccharides prolong the partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and thrombin time required to exert an anticoagulant effect [92]."

Morchella angusticepes Peck polysaccharides exhibit a stronger cholesterol-lowering activity after carboxymethylation [93]. Lachnum sp. polysaccharides can reduce serum and liver lipids and atherosclerosis and enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes in mice with hyperlipidemia after selenization [38]."

            "text": "Previous studies have focused on chemical modifications of polysaccharides that can improve their biological activity. In addition, our research found that a modified polysaccharide is affected by its structure and physicochemical properties, such as its water solubility, molecular weight, degree of substitution, main chain and degree of branching. Reagents for the structural modification of polysaccharides are generally toxic, or the steps are cumbersome. After the application of modified polysaccharides, the toxic reagents need to be removed, and the modification method needs to be improved. The structural analysis of polysaccharides is a difficult problem for the analysis of the biological activities of polysaccharides; hence, the structure\u2013activity relationship of polysaccharides and modified polysaccharides will be the focuses of future research. Multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary research is an important trend in the development of modern medicine, involving the combination of modified polysaccharides and medical materials. Not only can such materials act in vivo, but they also provide more possibilities for in vitro applications.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.Z.; methodology, M.Y.; software, T.Z.; validation, L.M.; formal analysis, X.L. and Y.L.; investigation, Q.D.; resources, G.C.; data curation, Y.L. and H.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.Z. and S.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, T.Z., M.Y., S.Z. and C.D.; supervision, S.Z. and C.D.; project administration, C.D.; funding acquisition, C.D.
