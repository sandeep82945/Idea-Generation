    "abstractText": "Recently, new high-resolution cadmium\u2013zinc\u2013telluride (CZT) drift strip detectors for room temperature gamma-ray spectroscopic imaging were developed by our group. The CZT detectors equipped with orthogonal anode/cathode collecting strips, drift strips and dedicated pulse processing allow a detection area of 6 \u00d7 20 mm2 and excellent room temperature spectroscopic performance (0.82% FWHM at 661.7 keV). In this work, we investigated the potentialities of these detectors for prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy (PGS) in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The detectors, exploiting the measurement of the 478 keV prompt gamma rays emitted by 94% 7Li nuclides from the 10B(n, \u03b1)7Li reaction, are very appealing for the development of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems and Compton cameras in BNCT. High-resolution gamma-ray spectra from 10B samples under thermal neutrons were measured at the T.R.I.G.A. Mark II research nuclear reactor of the University of Pavia (Italy).",

            "text": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a radiation therapy exploiting the high probability of 10B to capture thermal neutrons through the nuclear reaction 10B(n, \u03b1)7Li. The products of this reaction (7Li nuclides and alpha particles) are characterized by high linear energy transfer (LET), of about 150 keV/\u00b5m for alpha particles and 175 keV/\u00b5m for 7Li nuclei, with important potentialities in destroying cancer cells. The idea of BNCT was first proposed by Gordon Locher in 1936 [1], the first research activities were pioneered by Kruger in 1940 [2] and the clinical tests started in the USA in 1951 [3]. Since then, several clinical studies have been made around the world\u2014the pioneering works in Japan [4], Argentina [5], Finland [6], Sweden [7] and Italy [8]. The optimization of the treatment effects in BNCT requires the knowledge of the real distribution of 10B concentration in both tumor and healthy cells, possibly during the irradiation. For real-time measurements of the 10B distribution, the prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy (PGS) technique [9,10] is considered the most appealing procedure. The key operation is the direct measurement of the 478 keV prompt gamma rays emitted by 94% 7Li nuclides from the 10B(n, \u03b1)7Li reaction. Conventional PGS instrumentation is based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems, equipped with the proper energy resolution to effectively detect the\nSensors 2022, 22, 1502. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22041502 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 1502 2 of 11\n478 keV gamma rays from the gamma-ray background created by various (n, \u03b3) reactions and annihilation phenomena. Typical SPECT systems are based on scintillators [11] or semiconductor detectors [12] matched to dedicated mechanical collimators for image reconstruction. Intense activities have been made on SPECT systems based on high-Z and wide-bandgap compound semiconductors [12,13] in order to ensure room temperature operation (if compared with the cryogenically cooled germanium detectors), high detection efficiency and energy resolution better than scintillators. Among these, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cadmium\u2013zinc\u2013telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) detectors showed interesting room temperature performance for BNCT-SPECT systems, with an energy resolution of 2\u20133% at 662 keV [14\u201319]. High-resolution BNCT-SPECT prototypes (<2% at 662 keV), based on CdTe Schottky detectors, have been developed [12,15]; however, to minimize the time instability due to the bias-induced polarization [20,21], the thickness of CdTe Schottky detectors must be less than 2 mm, thus limiting the detection efficiency and the detection area. CdTe detectors with ohmic contacts allow greater thickness but poorer energy resolution (>2% at 662 keV) [14]. CZT detectors with ohmic contacts, due to their higher resistivity than the CdTe ones, should ensure better room temperature energy resolution; but the presence of more charge trapping and low crystal uniformity requires more effort in both pulse processing and crystal growth. BNCT-SPECT CZT prototypes with standard pulse processing electronics showed energy resolution >2% at 662 keV [17\u201319]. In order to reduce the limits of the mechanical collimators in BNCT-SPECT systems, in terms of sensitivity and spatial resolution, Compton cameras were also investigated [22\u201324]. This approach, based on the analysis of the kinematics of the Compton scattering, requires scatter/absorber spectrometers with 3-D positioning and timing capabilities. Recently, in the framework of the 3CaTS project (funded by INFN, Italy), new highresolution 3-D CZT drift strip detectors were developed for prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy in BNCT. The CZT prototypes are characterized by a detection area of 6 \u00d7 20 mm2 and equipped with custom 32-channel digital electronics able to detect and analyze single and double events from Compton/photoelectric photon interactions. The goal of the project was to develop new CZT detectors able to ensure room temperature energy resolution <2% at 662 keV and 3-D spatial resolution < 1 mm, as prototypes for both BNCT-SPECT and BNCT-Compton cameras. In this work, we present, besides the spectroscopic capabilities of the detectors, the first results from a 10B-enriched sample irradiated by the highly thermalized neutron beam of the Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) facility at the T.R.I.G.A. Mark II research nuclear reactor of the University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy)."

            "text": "The first CZT detectors for X-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy were developed in 1992 [25] and their capabilities in detecting thermal neutrons were first presented in 1996 [26]. Since then, great efforts and successful results have been obtained in the development of high-resolution CZT detectors, in terms of both crystal growth [27,28] and device/electrode technology [29\u201332]. CZT detectors with orthogonal anode and cathode strips were fabricated since 1996 [33] and important advances were obtained at the DTU Space (Denmark) for astrophysical applications [34,35]. The strip electrode layout and the drift strips allow charge collection enhancements and sub-millimeter 3-D spatial capabilities. Recently, new CZT drift strip detectors with excellent room temperature performance were developed by our group [36,37]. The detectors, based on CZT crystals (19.4 \u00d7 19.4 \u00d7 6 mm3) grown by the traveling heather method (THM) technique [28], were fabricated at IMEM-CNR of Parma (Italy) with the collaboration of the due2lab company (Scandiano, Italy) [36,37]. In particular, the detectors were developed from THM-CZT pixel detectors (Redlen Technologies, Canada) with enhanced electron charge transport properties (\u00b5e\u03c4e > 10\u22122 cm2/V). The strips were realized with gold electro-less contacts with a deposition of thin Al2O3 film between them, ensuring very low leakage currents (<1 nA at 50 V between the strips) [38]. The gold strip electrodes were deposited from\nSensors 2022, 22, 1502 3 of 11\nsolution [39] and cathode and anode patterning were performed in two different steps. The electrode configuration is based on orthogonal strips on the anode and cathode sides: the anode strips have a pitch of 0.4 mm (strip width of 0.15 mm and inter-strip gap of 0.25 mm) (Figure 1), whereas the cathode strips are orthogonal to the anode strips with a pitch of 2 mm (strip with of 1.9 mm and inter-strip gap of 0.1 mm). To optimize the electron charge collection on the collecting strips (the yellow strips of Figure 1), the adjacent strips, termed drift strips, are negatively biased, as clearly shown in Figure 1a. In particular, the drift strips (light blue) more adjacent to the collecting strips are biased at \u2212100 V and the central drift strips (blue) at \u2212200 V; the cathodes are biased at \u2212350 V. The signal read-out of the strips is organized as follows (Figure 1b): the collecting anode (yellow) and the cathode (green) strips are singly read out, while the drift strips are combined together in two groups of three strips; the drift strips (red) on the right side (RD) and the strips (violet) on the left side (LD) of each collecting strip.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 11\nat 50 V between the strips) [38].

Each drift cell is characterized by a collection anode, the RD and LD strips and the 10 cathode strips. Each drift cell is able to provide both the energy and the 3-D interaction position of the photons, as already demonstrated in the literature [34,35]. In particular, the energy of the photons can be given by the pulses from the collecting anodes, the x-position by the collecting anodes related to the RD/LD anode pulses, the y-position through the relation between the cathode and the anode pulses and the z-position by the cathode pulses. Despite a pitch of 1.6 mm of the drift cells and 2 mm of the cathode strips, it is possible to reduce the spatial resolution through the analysis of the pulses from the drift strips [34,35]. In order to exploit the 20 mm thickness of CZT material over the z-direction (Figure 1b), the detectors were developed to work in the planar transverse field (PTF) irradiation geometry (i.e., photons interacting on the X\u2013Y plane). The energies of 478 keV and 558 keV, shown in Figure 2, are the main prompt gamma-rays emitted by the 10B(n, \u03b1)7Li and 113Cd(n, \u03b3)114Cd reactions, respectively.\nFigure 1.

The Pulses from the Strips: Single and Double Photon Interactions As well described in our previous work [36], the collecting anode strips mainly give\nrise to collected-charge pulses, i.e., pulses due to the electrons really collected by the strips; while induced-charge pulses characterize the drift strips: they are induced by the motion of the electrons really collected by the adjacent collecting anode strips. The shape of the pulses strongly depends on the photon interaction position and it is mainly related to the particular behavior of the weighting potential and charge trapping of electrons and holes. The details of the characteristics of these pulses are better described in our previous work [36]. Here, to highlight the potentialities of the detectors as Compton cameras, we focus on the shape of the pulses from the collecting anodes and the adjacent drift strips, due to single photoelectric or double interaction by Compton/photoelectric events. In Figure 3, the single output CSP pulses from photoelectric interaction, the double pulses from Compton/photoelectric interactions within a single drift cell and within two drift cells are presented. The detector, working as both scatter and absorber, is able to detect double events from Compton/photoelectric interaction even within a single drift cell. Generally, the double events within a single drift cell are not well detected by the standard pulse processing electronics; the detection of these events strongly increases the sensitivity of Compton cameras. In fact, as shown in Figure 4, the double events from Compton/photoelectric interactions within a single drift cell are detected as false single events by a standard pulse processing; therefore, they are wrongly detected and analyzed as single photoelectric events. In fact, the slow shaping (blue line), optimized to analyze the single photoelectric events, gives rise to a single pulse. While, through the fast shaping (red line), it is possible to correctly detect the double events. This operation is allowed by our digital electronics that perform on each CSP pulse both fast and slow shaping processing. As\nFigure 2. Calculated detection efficiency versus CZT material thickness.

Prompt Gamma-Ray Measurements in BNCT Environment The gamma-ray response of the detectors to 10B signal was investigated at the T.R.I.G.A. Mark II research nuclear reactor of the University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy). The T.R.I.G.A. Mark II reactor is a water-cooled and water-moderated reactor, equipped with several in-core and out-core irradiation channels and positions, allowing a flux along the core axis of 5\u22c51013 cm\u22122 s\u22121 at the full power (250 kW). To measure the typical gamma-ray products from the 10B neutron capture reaction leading to the BNCT therapeutic effects, a small liquid sample containing 10B was irradiated with a highly thermalized neutron beam of the Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) facility recently installed at the reactor. In particular, we used almost 1 mL liquid sample containing 10B at a concentration of approximately 5000 ppm and irradiated at the reactor power of 20 kW, corresponding to a thermal neutron flux of almost 5.3\u2219\u00d7 105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 at the PGNAA beam port. The high 10B concentration of the sample is explained as follows: at the maximum reactor power of 250 kW, the thermal neutron flux at the PGNAA beam port is about 5\u2219\u00d7 106 n/cm2s, thus almost 3-2 orders of magnitude less than what expected in a BNCT clinical scenario. To balance this loss and still achieve the reaction rate of 10B expected in the clinical application, we have been forced to increase the 10B concentration. The self-shielding effect at this level of 10B inside the sample is certainly high (preliminary estimations around 45%).

The detectors, due to the application of original spectral correction techniques, are characterized by excellent room temperature energy resolution, about 3% FWHM at 122 keV and 0.8% FWHM at 662 keV. The detection of both single photoelectric events and double Compton/photoelectric events allows the detectors to work as scatter/absorber detectors for Compton cameras. In particular, the digital electronics, through the application of both fast and slow shaping, allows the detection of double Compton/photoelectric events within a single detection cell, with important enhancements in terms of sensitivity for Compton cameras. Measurements under thermal neutrons highlighted the abilities of the detectors to well detect the 478 keV photons from the parasitic neutron activation peaks of 113Cd. The effects of the Doppler broadening on the 478 keV peak, typically detected with cryogenic cooled germanium detectors, are clearly visible. Ongoing activities are focused on the spatial characterization of the detectors, by exploiting charge sharing and induced signals, for image reconstruction of the 10B distribution during a BNCT treatment, working as SPECT and Compton camera.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.A., E.C., N.P. and A.Z.; formal analysis, L.A., A.B., G.G., F.P., S.A. and N.P.; investigation, L.A., A.B., F.P., N.A., M.B., S.A., N.P., S.Z. and A.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.A., A.B. and F.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, all authors; supervision, L.A.; project administration, L.A., E.C. and N.P.; funding acquisition, L.A., E.C. and N.P.
