The aim of this study is to propose an implementation roadmap based on the national healthcare system status.\nMethods: A survey was conducted among Egyptian healthcare sector decision-makers to assess the current and future (preferred) HTA implementation status in Egypt based on a widely used international scorecard methodology. Subsequently, interviews were conducted with experts representing middle- and top-tier management in the Egyptian healthcare system to interpret the survey results and recommend specific actions.\nResults: Experts recommended more capacity-building programs for HTA and health economics. Additionally, they proposed establishing HTA units in separate healthcare authorities and merging them into a single central HTA unit in the long term. Regarding the scope of implementation, experts recommended commencing with the assessment of innovative pharmaceuticals, and thereafter, expanding the scope to cover all health technologies in the long term. Additionally, they recommended using innovative tools such as \u201cmulti-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)\u201d for tendering, and \u201cmanaged entry agreements\u201d for reimbursement decisions. Local burden of diseases and costing studies were also recommended to facilitate the implementation of HTA.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org\nFasseeh et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2022.896175\nConclusion: Experts agreed that several actions are required for successful HTA implementation in Egypt, including coordination between HTA bodies, application of an explicit MCDA framework, and strengthening of local evidence generation. To implement these actions, investment in technical capacity-building is indispensable. Most experts favored using multiple and soft cost-e ectiveness thresholds. E orts should be made to publish HTA submission guidelines and timelines of the processes.\nKEYWORDS\nhealth technology assessment, HTA, Egypt, health policy, HTA implementation, healthcare system"

            "text": "Egypt is a lower-middle-income country with a population of approximately 102million in 2020 (1\u20133). Its healthcare system is fragmented, with different public and private providers and financing agents. Health services in the country are managed, financed, and provided by agencies in all three sectors of the economy: governmental, parastatal, and private (4).\nEgypt has taken several steps to improve its population\u2019s health. Political support to increase health spending was obvious in the 2014 constitutional mandate, specifically Article 18, which underlines the right to health and access to good-quality healthcare. Since then, better health information systems have been developed, coverage for health services has improved toward reaching universal health coverage, and more resources have been spent on healthcare (5).\nThe overall life expectancy increased from 64.5 years to 70.5 years in 2019 (6), reaching 72 years in 2020 (7), approaching the global average of 73 years (8). However, out-of-pocket payments are still considered the major source of healthcare financing in Egypt, accounting for more than 60% of the total healthcare expenditure (9). The risk of catastrophic health expenditure in Egypt is approximately 25%, which is higher than the average for middle-income countries (23%) (7).\nEgypt is currently reforming its healthcare system to include universal health insurance (UHI) with broader coverage and better services than the existing insurance system. Upon implementation of the UHI system, its budget should surpass the current total health expenditure (THE), raising THE significantly as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) (9, 10).\nHealth technology assessment (HTA) refers to the systematic evaluation of the properties, effects, and/or impacts of health technologies. Additionally, it facilitates transparency in decision-making by policymakers based on defined criteria and thresholds (11\u201315).\nImplementing HTA is crucial for achieving the objectives of the UHI system. Primarily, it will enable evidence-based\ndecision-making with clear prioritization and better resource allocation, thus alleviating pressure on the health budget (16, 17). Additionally, it may help expand patients\u2019 access to more health services, thereby achieving the broad coverage objective of the UHI. Moreover, it could facilitate controlled diffusion of technologies into the healthcare system. Finally, the formal implementation of HTA has positive spillover effects beyond evidence-based reimbursement decisions (16, 17), such as strengthening dialogue between stakeholders and focusing the national direction toward patient-level outcomes (18).\nAlthough HTA has not yet been fully implemented in Egypt, several steps have been taken toward its implementation. In 2011, the Egyptian chapter of The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) was established, which has provided an impetus to the implementation of HTA in Egypt. In the same year, a ministerial decree was signed to establish the pharmacoeconomics unit (PEU) at the Central Administration of Pharmaceutical Affairs (CAPA). In 2013, the recommendations for reporting pharmacoeconomic evaluations in Egypt were published (19) as the first step toward developing the national guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals. The PEU has received requests for cost-based analyses from various public-sector entities, such as the Tender/Procurement department, Health Insurance Organization, Drug Shortage Department, CAPA pricing committee, and the Ministry of Health technical office.\nIn 2012, Egypt established the first postgraduate program in health economics; prior to that, only sporadic courses on health economics were provided. Two years later, in 2014, a two-year master\u2019s program in health economics started at Cairo University as a joint program between the Faculty of Medicine (Public Health Department) and the Economics Department of the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences (20, 21). Moreover, a few undergraduate courses have been established, specifically in the faculties of pharmacy in public and private universities (22).\nThe universal healthcare coverage law, published in 2018, contains a clause for the establishment of the HTA unit within\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nFasseeh et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2022.896175\nthe payer body (23). In 2019, the law for unified procurement was published, directing the establishment of a department for HTA (24).\nAdditionally, managed entry agreements have been applied in several sectors, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools have been conducted in several tenders by different health authorities. Furthermore, an MCDA tool for purchasing oncology off-patent pharmaceuticals in Egypt was published (25) and operationalized at the Egyptian Authority for Unified Procurement, Medical Supply, and Management of Medical Technology (UPA). The Universal Health Insurance Authority (UHIA) board officially ruled that economic evaluation is a mandatory prerequisite for all new coverage and reimbursement decisions.\nAlthough all the previous steps have helped in HTA implementation, HTA is still not mandatory for pricing or reimbursement at several health authorities. According to the ISPOR Egypt chapter president, the full implementation of HTA in Egypt faces various hurdles. These include the lack of funding and resources for HTA implementation, low quality of available data, and lack of an explicit willingness-to-pay threshold in Egypt (22). Additionally, a gap exists between HTA research and actual reimbursement decision-making (26).\nThere is a lack of peer-reviewed studies on HTA in Egypt, and no study has yet discussed a systematic plan for implementing HTA in Egypt. However, whatever little literature is available has concurred with the potential benefits of full HTA implementation in Egypt. The purpose of this study is to assess the gaps in HTA implementation in Egypt and to propose a roadmap and specific actions for full HTA implementation over the next decade."

The main purpose of the scorecard was to define the current status of HTA as well as its preferred status in the long run, highlighting the gaps.\nThe scorecard divides HTA implementation into several domains. For every domain, experts were asked two questions: (1) What is their perception on the current status of HTA regarding this domain? (2) What is their preferred status for that domain in 10 years? Each question had predefined choices for the expert. The distribution of responses reflects the collective opinion of multiple stakeholders, which indicates potential areas for major improvement. As such, the scorecard served as the foundation for advising on the appropriate HTA structure and implementation process from the perspective of key local stakeholders.\nThe scorecard evaluates eight domains. The first domain, \u201cHTA capacity-building,\u201d is about having well-trained experts for HTA because unfavorable results and system failure may occur if HTA implementation is legislated without adequate capacity. Another domain discusses \u201cLegislation on HTA\u201d\u2014that is, how HTA is integrated into the legal framework. There is a domain about \u201cScope of HTA implementation,\u201d regarding the range of health technologies that will be evaluated through HTA. \u201cHTA funding\u201d focuses on the HTA system funding model\u2014 whether predominantly publicly funded, privately funded, or a mix of both. Other domains discuss \u201cThe use of local data,\u201d \u201cQuality and transparency of HTA implementation,\u201d and \u201cDecision criteria\u201d\u2014the latter specifies elements for inclusion in the HTA process.

Half of them opined that training should focus not only on theoretical knowledge but also on hands-on training. Three indicated that institutionalbased capacity-building is the most appropriate approach. Two interviewees recommended that health economics should be included in undergraduate training. One stressed the need to develop capacities in different specialties, including epidemiology and biostatistics, not just health economics.\nSeveral interviewees (n= 5) suggested timelines for capacity development. They suggested that in the short term, there should be more courses on developing technical skills for those with a sound theoretical background; for example, economic modeling skills could be developed through three-month to oneyear crash courses and diplomas. Within 3\u20135 years, another master\u2019s degree in health economics\u2014other than the one at Cairo University\u2014with a more technical orientation should be launched. Additionally, health economics should be more widely integrated into undergraduate training. Finally, in the long term (within 6\u201310 years), a doctorate program should be initiated to expand the base of HTA experts who can potentially establish and lead educational courses. In general, within 5e years, Egypt should have a wide pool of capacities with essential multidisciplinary skills in HTA, with special focus on basic and applied health economics.\nFunding (HTA assessment and critical appraisal)\nThere are two main components of HTA, the assessment and appraisal. HTA assessment is usually performed by the marketing authorization holder. The submitted dossier includes evidence related to the target patient population, relative efficacy, economic evaluation, cost-effectiveness and other related research. On the other hand, critical appraisal involves validating the submitted evidence in the HTA assessment, then evaluating it in light of several factors such as budget constraints and local health policies, to construct a recommendation for decision makers (29). Experts were asked how each of the two HTA components should be funded.\nAlthough survey respondents equally preferred funding of the critical appraisal from submission fees or public resources, interviewees agreed on private funding through submission fees is the most reasonable option for the next decade similarly to\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 04 frontiersin.org\nFasseeh et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2022.896175"

Interviewees highlighted that public funding may never be the dominant funding model for critical appraisals in Egypt, although partial public funding will be necessary especially in those areas where HTA is initiated by public or academic institutes.\nSeventy-one percent of the survey respondents pointed that sufficient public funding for HTA research with supportive private funding is expected in the future and 23% preferred HTA research to be dominantly funded from public resources. While interviewees considered that public funding should have a role, they agreed that it would not be realistic to discourage investment of the private sector to HTA research in the forthcoming years with expectedly limited public resources in all health care sectors. Pharmaceutical companies make huge global investments into preparing HTA dossiers and health economic models in many different countries, and it makes no sense to ignore these research outputs and rely only or dominantly on local public funding in HTA research. As an example, development of local health economic models from scratch by public stakeholders in Egypt would be far more expensive than encouraging the local adaptation of global health economic models by pharmaceutical companies.

The financing structure under the new healthcare system reform has led to the centralization of decision-making. Consequently, the burden\non the government\u2014as well as its control\u2014has increased (9), which increases the suitability of conducting HTA at the central level (30).\nGiven the current Egyptian healthcare system structure, the country is facing systemic inequalities and inefficiencies that have limited the effectiveness of its health system. The government is expected to have an extremely high negotiation power in the near future under the new universal insurance, because of the extended beneficiary coverage and expanded benefit package. This necessitates efficient resource allocation to maximize benefits. HTA can play a significant role in achieving healthcare financing objectives by scientifically and systematically assessing health technologies as well as pricing and reimbursement policies.\nThere are several barriers to HTA implementation, considering the current Egyptian healthcare system structure, as discussed earlier. Nevertheless, stakeholders can identify the potential of HTA implementation in enhancing the healthcare system in Egypt, especially amid the healthcare reform. The positive expectations of decision-makers are evident from the existing progress and initiatives taken toward HTA implementation in Egypt over the past decade.\nAs in many countries in the MENA region, steps were taken to implement HTA in Egypt; nevertheless, much has to be done before reaping full and fruitful benefits. Thus, a roadmap is necessary to guide decision-makers based on previous experiences and the viewpoints of experts. The results of the roadmap and associated recommendations for specific actions provide clear steps for establishing a successful HTA structure and its related activities.\nHere, we propose a clear roadmap with recommendations for specific actions to achieve full HTA implementation in Egypt, based on expert surveys and interviews.\nThere are certain fundamental components of the roadmap. One of them is gradual capacity-building to guarantee sufficiency of experts. HTA capacity-building in Egypt has advanced over the past decade. However, more postgraduate programs are required based on country-specific needs.\nHTA appraisal and research should be funded mainly by manufacturers\u2014supplemented by some public funding in research areas initiated by public or academic institutes. The funding by the public sector is currently limited; thus, moreHTA funding needs to be secured through both public and private funding. The allocation of public resources to HTA indicates political support, which should facilitate the implementation process (31). It was recommended that the submission fees paid by manufacturers for the appraisal of their models should be low. This recommendation mainly came from interviewees with a governmental background, to prevent any bias due to the high submission fees paid.\nAs in many other countries, HTA in Egypt should begin with a focus on innovative pharmaceuticals, especially those with a high budget impact. In the future, more efforts are needed to expand to additional technologies within the scope of HTA and\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 09 frontiersin.org\nF a sse e h e t a l.\n1 0 .3 3 8 9 /fp u b h .2 0 2 2 .8 9 6 1 7 5\nF ro n tie rs in P u b lic H e a lth\n1 0\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\nF a sse e h e t a l.\n1 0 .3 3 8 9 /fp u b h .2 0 2 2 .8 9 6 1 7 5\nF ro n tie rs in P u b lic H e a lth\n1 1\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\nFasseeh et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2022.896175\nrevise previous policy decisions. Several criteria other than costeffectiveness and budget impact analyses, such as unmet medical needs and healthcare priority, should be considered by decisionmakers to improve HTA implementation and apply explicit willingness-to-pay thresholds. Most stakeholders recommend using multiple and soft cost-effectiveness thresholds. Applying an explicit MCDA framework, particularly tenders, is essential for consistent decisions. To enhance transparency, HTA deliverables and timelines must be published.\nFurthermore, the system should benefit from transferable international evidence (e.g., relative effectiveness) and rely on local data, where international evidence is not transferable (e.g., cost analysis). Finally, international collaboration with prestigious organizations, enhancing local political will, and adopting the best international and regional practices shall help empower HTA bodies in Egypt. Egypt\u2019s HTA bodies should participate in joint HTA documents and courses with international bodies. In the long run, establishing a central HTA body is fundamental to avoiding duplication of efforts.\nA problem that was highlighted is the gap between HTA research and actual reimbursement decision-making. Decision-makers need to actively implement HTA. Publishing guidelines and checklists for critical appraisal is recommended to enhance the comparability of studies and improve their quality.\nThe same HTA scorecard was previously applied to the MENA region (31), and we compared the results from Egypt with those from the MENA region. The comparison revealed that there is consensus on some major elements of HTA implementation and some heterogeneity in other aspects.\nTheMENA survey outcomes revealed the limited availability of HTA training options and that launching graduate and postgraduate programs in the future is preferred. Moreover, currently, HTA has no formal role in decision-making. However, almost all respondents preferred to see formal HTA processes and use local data in the future. HTA is recommended in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and prevention programs. Almost all respondents believed that joining international bodies for collaborative purposes would be helpful for both decisionmaking and capacity-building.\nCompared to Egypt\u2019s survey results, both survey results are quite similar in terms of the preferred structure of HTA in almost all domains, except for a few elements, such as funding. Unlike in the MENA region, experts in Egypt prefer a dominant private funding model for HTA research and appraisal, which might be attributed to the lower gross domestic product per capita in Egypt compared to the sample in the MENA region survey (31). Egyptian experts put less emphasis on future budgetary impacts compared to experts in other regional countries. In contrast to the MENA region, experts in Egypt prefer to publish recommendations without details of technology assessment reports and critical appraisals; experts in the MENA region recommend more transparency by publishing these details. A\nscorecard comparing the preferred status results from Egypt with the MENA region is presented in Supplementary Table 2."

            "text": "We cannot claim that the sample in either the survey or the interviews are fully generalizable or representative, but this is mostly because of limitation of funding and resources. Furthermore, it is seldom possible to find stakeholders from different entities with knowledge of HTA who can address these questions. However, we did our best to include various stakeholders that represent multiple key entities. The HTA scorecard results from 2018 might be considered outdated; however, the most crucial element in the survey is the aspired situation, which is not expected to significantly change over this time period as opposed to the current status. Furthermore, later interviews validated the scorecard recommendations. Since this research commenced, several steps have been taken toward HTA implementation, and a few proposed actions may have already been implemented at the time of publication of this study."
