ABSTRACT Introduction Incentives conditional on school attendance or on remaining free of sexually transmitted infections have produced mixed results in reducing HIV incidence. Methods HIVnegative adolescent girls and young women aged 15\u201322%\u201350% of whom were out of school\u2014were recruited from 293 clusters in Eswatini from urban (30%) and rural areas (70%). Financial incentives conditional on education attendance were randomly allocated at the cluster level. All participants were further individually randomised into eligibility for a raffle incentive conditional on random selection into the raffle, on negative tests for syphilis and Trichomonas vaginalis and on being a raffle winner, creating four subarms in a 2\u00d72 factorial design: nointervention, raffle incentive, education incentive and raffle & education incentive. Randomisation was unblinded to participants. Logistic regressions were used in intentiontotreat analysis of HIV incidence over 3 years to estimate the impact of incentives conditional on school attendance and raffle incentives conditional on remaining sexually transmitted infection free. Results The study recruited 4389 HIVnegative participants, who were distributed into four subarms: no intervention (n=1068), raffle incentive (n=1162), education incentive (n=1088) and raffle and education incentive (n=1071). At endline, 272 participants from 3772 for whom endline data were collected, tested positive for HIV. HIV incidence among participants in education treatment arm was significantly lower than in the education control arm, 6.34% (119/1878) versus 8.08% (153/1894) (p=0.041); OR: 0.766 (0.598 to 0.981); adjusted OR (aOR): 0.754 (0.585 to 0.972). Compared with the no intervention subarm, HIV incidence in the raffle and education incentive subarm was significantly lower, 5.79% (54/878) versus 8.84% (80/905); OR: 0.634 (0.443 to 0.907); aOR: 0.622 (0.433 to 0.893), while it was not significantly lower in the raffle incentive subarm. Conclusion Financial incentives conditional on education participation significantly reduced HIV infection among adolescent girls and young women in Eswatini and appear to be a promising tool for prevention in high HIV prevalence settings.

            "text": "In 2020, Eswatini had the highest HIV prevalence among the general population (15\u201349 old) in the world (25.4%),1 with women and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) disproportionally infected (12.2% HIV prevalence among women 15\u201324). There are 120 000 women living with HIV, which is 63% of the total people living with HIV in Eswatini. AGYW aged 15\u201324 are particularly at higher risk: in 2014, at study design, there were approximately 2400 new infections among young women, compared with just under 500 among young men.1\nIncome inequality in Eswatini is high, despite the country being classified as a lower middle- income country: in 2016, the Gini coefficient showed that Eswatini was the seventh most inequal country in the world.2 Just under 40% of Swazis were considered poor by global standards.3 In 2017, only 41% of women and 66% of men participated in the labour force, while unemployment overall was 24%, unemployment among the youth aged 19\u201324 was a staggering 50%.4 The poor economic prospects, low levels of education and employment among AGYW result in increasing prevalence of age- disparate and transactional sex.5 Population- based surveys showed that these rates among AGYW increased from 7% in 2007 to 14% in 2010, 15% in 2014 and 16% in 2016.6\u20138\nDuring the last decade, several studies tested the impact of conditional financial incentives as a strategy to prevent new HIV infections.9\u201316 A first set focused on incentives conditioned on school participation and found mixed evidence: some showed that financial incentives may reduce HIV and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)- 2 prevalence,9 but others using either financial incentives conditional on education10 11 or multisectoral combination interventions including cash transfers and education subsidies12 13 have not demonstrated significant reductions in HV incidence. A Cochrane review in 2017 recommended that more studies of education incentives were needed.14 Another set of studies evaluated the impact of financial incentives conditioned on remaining negative for curable STIs.15 16 In Tanzania, such incentives were found to significantly reduce STI prevalence,15 while in Lesotho lottery- based financial incentives significantly reduced HIV incidence.16 Given the mixed results suggesting equipoise, more evidence is needed on the efficiency of financial incentives for HIV prevention. With a 2\u00d72 factorial design, the Sitakhela Likusasa Impact Evaluation was designed to test the hypothesis that incentives conditional on school attendance, raffle incentives conditional on remaining STI free, and their combination, would reduce HIV incidence measured at the individual level in a sample of AGYW who were in and out- of- school in both rural and urban settings in Eswatini.\nThe cluster randomisation was used for education incentives to avoid contamination across participants attending the same school. Sitakhela Likusasa is a Siswati phrase meaning \u2018we build the future.\u2019"

There were 2076 EAs defined in the last census in 2007, and the average number of households per area was 103 (274 for rural EAs and 34 for urban EAs). To guarantee that AGYW living in the same area and, in particular, around the same school had access to the same education incentives and to, therefore, avoid contamination, participants\u2019 access to financial incentives conditional on education attendance were randomly allocated, using stratified random sampling, at the cluster level.\nAfter enrolment into the study, participants were further individually randomised to have access to a raffle incentive or not. Those eligible for the raffle incentive would receive a prize if they satisfied all of the three following conditions: random selection into the raffle for that round, testing negative on negative tests for syphilis and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and on being a raffle winner, creating four subarms in a 2\u00d72 factorial design: no intervention subarm, raffle incentive subarm, education incentive subarm and raffle and education incentive subarm, as per study protocol.18 Treatment and control groups for the raffle incentive and education incentive were created, as follows: education treatment arm was the education incentive subarm and education and raffle subarm; education control arm was the raffle subarm and no intervention subarm; raffle treatment arm was the education and raffle subarm and the raffle subarm and raffle control arm was the education incentive subarm and no intervention subarm."

Participants were also eligible for an additional incentive if they had at least 80% attendance during the school term. Participants in university, college, upgrading classes or in a short course received an additional incentive if they completed the course or a particular year. The exact conditionalities for the education incentive payments, the commensurate incentive amounts and the 2\u00d72 factorial design are further detailed in tables 1 and 2. School enrolment and attendance were verified using Ministry of Education enrolment and attendance register data from the schools (registers were requested from entire grades, so as to avoid individual study participants being identified). The study team extracted school enrolment and school attendance data from these registers and made payments using MTN (Mobile Telecommunication Network) Mobile Money system once a term, within 3 months of the school- term ending. Enrolment in upgrading classes, vocational training, university or a short course\u2014as well as completion of these types of education\u2014was verified through letters from the respective institutions. Payment was made to study participants directly using MTN Mobile Money within 3 months of\nthe proof being sent from the school directly to the study team. Participants who did not have access to (or were too young for) the MTN Mobile Money electronic payment system were paid using the local post office\u2019s fund transfer process.\nDue to initial challenges in verifying school attendance, the payment of education incentives started slowly in the first year. This issue led to extending study implementation period by 1 year and to reinforcing the education incentives during the last year as detailed in table 2. The reinforcement of the education incentives entailed paying, in the latter half of the study, an additional incentive to participants who were in the education treatment arm and who were out of school at midline data collection.\nRaffle incentives conditional on testing negative for syphilis and TV In the raffle incentive treatment arm, the intervention took place as follows (for details, see tables 1 and 2): some participants (randomly selected at each raffle round) were enrolled in a raffle conditional on testing negative for syphilis and TV. Those two curable STIs were selected based on their known prevalence in Eswatini and neighbouring KwaZulu Natal at the time of study design.19 20 Seven rounds of raffle took place over the course of the study. At each raffle draw, participants in the raffle incentive treatment arm were randomly selected (n=200 at each round) for STI screening. Those who tested negative for TV and Syphilis were then entered in a raffle draw through which n=80 winners per round were randomly selected to receive a prize of E1 000 (~ US$72). Free medical treatment was offered to those who tested positive for either STI; post- treatment, those who tested negative were eligible for future raffle incentives.\nTo minimise attrition in all study groups, a study helpdesk was established and tasked with regularly updating\n(IIT P atna).

Few studies have examined this question, and, therefore, there is little certainty for this assumption.

In particular, geospatial analytics was used to determine which control and treatment EAs were adjacent to each other, creating an \u2018adjacent EA pair\u2019. For each of these \u2018adjacent EA pairs\u2019, simple random selection determined which of the EAs in the \u2018adjacent EA pair\u2019 should be replaced. The EA in the adjacent pair selected for replacement was replaced with another EA (randomly selected) from the sample frame (ensuring that a rural EA replaces a rural EA and an urban EA\nreplaces an urban EA). After this was done, adjacency had to be checked again as the newly selected EA could cause adjacency issues with other EAs. The selection validation process was repeated four times until no education treatment EA or education control EAs were adjacent to each other.\nThird, during enrolment into the study, the study team aimed to enrol at least 12 participants per EA, of which six had to be in school at the time of enrolment in the study, and six were out of school at the time of study enrolment. In some of the original 250 randomised EAs, it was not possible to enrol 12 participants per cluster. In 132 EAs, no AGYW could be found who were eligible and agreed to be enrolled in the study. These 132 EAs were dropped and 132 new EAs were selected from the sample population of eligible EAs, following the same adjacency checking process as described in step 2.\nFourth, after participant enrolment in the 132 new EAs was completed, the minimum sample size still had not yet been reached. To accommodate the dropped 132 EAs and the additional EAs needed to ensure that the participant enrolment targets were met, in total, 177 additional EAs were selected, following the process described in step 3\u2014totaling 295 EAs. After enrolment into baseline data collection, two EAs were dropped because baseline data were not collected from any participants in those EAs. Eventually, after baseline data collection was completed, participants from 293 EAs (148 education treatment EAs and 145 education control EAs) were enrolled in the study. Endline data were collected from 292 EAs (one EA was not part of endline data collection because all participants in that EA either dropped out of the study or were loss to follow- up during endline data collection).

BMJ Global Health 2022;7:e007206. doi:10.1136/bmjgh-2021-007206 11\nBMJ Global Health\nThe Sitakhela Likusasa results are consistent with a study conducted in Malawi9 that showed that cash transfers conditional on education participation reduced HIV prevalence, but they stand in contrast with the results of the CAPRISA10 and HPTN06811 studies, both of which also tested financial incentives conditional on schooling but reported a lack of statistically significant impact among their study populations. A key difference between these two studies and Sitakhela Likusasa is that in these two studies, most study participants were AGYW already in school and living in urban areas while the Sitakhela Likusasa study enrolled 50% of AGYW who were outof- school at baseline, following the hypothesis that they would be more at risk and also potentially more likely to change their behaviour in response to incentives.\nThese results are an important contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of structural and social programmes for HIV prevention. To date, the impact of structural interventions (ie, interventions that address social determinants of HIV infection, or what is termed \u2018social vaccine\u2019-type initiatives including financial incentives for HIV prevention) has yielded mixed results in terms of its impact on HIV infection prevention.27 According to Baum et al, a term \u2018social vaccine\u2019 in the context of public health efforts was coined to \u2018encourage the biomedically orientated health sector to recognise the legitimacy of action on the distal social and economic determinants of health\u2019.28 The potential of structural HIV prevention programmes (like secondary education programmes) as a \u2018social vaccine\u2019 has been postulated numerous times29 30 and shown in natural experiments to be effective (such as an estimated 8.1 percentage point decrease in HIV prevalence for every added year of schooling in Botswana).31 But, experimental evidence has been scarce, sometimes because of limitations in study design: interventions were tested using self- reported behavioural outcomes and not HIV incidence, and some were small- scale evaluations without sufficient power to detect a statistically significant result.\nIn this regard, Sitakhela Likusasa aimed to provide rigorous evidence about the potential of a structural intervention to be a \u2018social vaccine\u2019 for HIV prevention. For a structural intervention to be deemed as a \u2018social vaccine\u2019, it would require that such an intervention has experimental results with a similar effect size to that of a biomedical intervention. Contrasting the effect sizes in the Sitakhela Likusasa results with studies evaluating universal (HIV) test- and- treat strategies (UTT)\u2014which put persons on HIV treatment immediately on an HIVpositive diagnosis\u2014provides such a comparison. Out of five UTT trials, two studies32 33 showed a reduction in HIV incidence,34 with effect sizes around 30%, comparable to Sitakhela Likusasa. This shows that \u2018social vaccine\u2019-type HIV prevention programmes (such as the interventions evaluated in Sitakhela Likusasa) that also address other, wider human capital challenges (education drop out and incompletion), can have an effect of similar magnitude\nto that of biomedical/drug- based HIV prevention strategies like test- and- treat.\nThe following study limitations should be considered in interpreting the results: attrition, especially for the no- intervention group, and difficulties in verifying school attendance on a regular basis were identified at the outset as potential study limitations. The attrition challenge was satisfactorily addressed by the establishment of a study helpdesk tasked with regularly updating contact details of all participants. Due to challenges in verifying school attendance, the payment of education incentives started slowly in the first year. For that reason, the study implementation period was extended by 1 year. The education incentives were reinforced during the last year. A further limitation of the study is the lack of power to detect differences in effects between study subarms. While this study was conducted at a relatively large scale for Eswatini and with direct involvement of the Government of Eswatini, some of the interventions were supported outside the national administrative system and externally funded, raising issues about scalability and sustainability. In particular, the programmatic implementation of regular raffle incentives might be challenging to scale- up, even though our design which randomly selected the participants taking part in each raffle round minimised the testing costs. The findings reported in this paper focused solely on the impact of the intervention on HIV incidence and did not account for potential health and education benefits of the intervention (which might have been sufficient to justify the implementation of such a safety net supporting human capital challenges among AGYW in Eswatini, regardless of the HIV outcome)."

            "text": "The study results have shown that financially empowering AGYW likely gave them more opportunities to decline risky sexual encounters and incentivising them to attend school offered them productive occupations and long- term aspirations. Keeping AGYW in education significantly reduces HIV incidence and is essential for the HIV response in contexts like Eswatini with high HIV prevalence and elevated risk among AGYW; the added benefit of this intervention is not just that it is a social and behavioural intervention requiring no medication to be successful but also that it has benefits far beyond the health benefit alone. Promoting access to and completion of more years of schooling is a critical component to forming human capital in Eswatini and more generally in all low and middle- income countries.35 While financial incentives and other behavioural interventions have shown mixed results in HIV prevention, the use of financial incentives for education appears to be promising tool to reduce HIV incidence and achieve better education, health and opportunities for AGYW in Eswatini and other high HIV prevalence settings.\nThe absence of statistically significant effect of the raffle incentives on their own could potentially be explained by the fact that their salience might have been eclipsed by the\n(IIT P atna).

However, raffle incentives amplified the education incentives\u2019 effect since the strongest reduction in HIV incidence was found for participants eligible for both types of incentives. While the study was not powered to detect differences across subarms, together with previous results from Lesotho,16 this suggests that raffle or lotterybased incentives conditional on being STI negative should be further explored as a prevention tool for HIV in combination with education incentives.\nThe study results have shown that an incentivised behavioural intervention can work at scale in a context such as Eswatini where HIV incidence among AGYW and the high school dropout rate are both very high. In contexts with hyperendemic HIV epidemics and high HIV incidence among AGYW, this study has shown that behavioural interventions remain an important tool for HIV prevention strategies for the AGYW population.\nAuthor affiliations 1Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice, World Bank Group, Washington, DC, USA 2National Emergency Response Council on HIV and AIDS (NERCHA), Mbabane, Eswatini 3Independent (formerly with the National Emergency Response Council on HIV and AIDS), Mbabane, Eswatini 4Institute for Health Measurement Southern Africa, Mbabane, Eswatini 5Eswatini National Reference Laboratory and National Blood Bank, Ministry of Health, Mbabane, Eswatini 6Department of Guidance and Counselling, Eswatini Ministry of Education and Training, Mbabane, Eswatini 7Development Research Group, World Bank Group, Washington, DC, USA\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank the Eswatini National Health Research Council and the Western Institutional Review Board that served as the institutional review boards and the data safety monitoring board for the Sitakhela Likusasa Impact Evaluation.
