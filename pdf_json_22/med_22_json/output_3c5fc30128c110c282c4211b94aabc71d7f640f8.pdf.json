A cross-sectional sample of 625 Chinese college students (20.8% male, mean age = 20.47 years old) completed measures of PC, AP, causality orientations, and MPA. We analyzed the survey data using structural equation modeling (SEM) in Mplus 8.0. PC was positively related to MPA. In addition, AP partially mediated this association. The hypothesized moderating effect of autonomous orientation and controlled orientation was not supported. Impersonal orientation moderated the second stage of the mediating effect of AP on the PC\u2013MPA link in that the mediating effect was positive when impersonal orientation was high, while the mediating effect was not significant when impersonal orientation was low. The findings confirm the importance of investigating how individual difference (i.e., PC) contributes to MPA. The implications of the findings for relieving MPA or preventing college students from developing MPA are also discussed deeply and thoroughly.\nKeywords: perfectionistic concerns, academic procrastination, causality orientations, mobile phone addiction, perfectionism\nINTRODUCTION\nSmartphones have become the largest network use terminal, due to their rapid technological development and great convenience. According to the 48th Statistical Report on Internet Development in China (China Internet Network Information Center, 2021), by June 2021, the number of mobile internet users in China reached 1.007 billion, accounting for 99.6% of all internet users, of which 17.4% of internet users were in the 20\u201329 age group. In particular, young adults aged 18\u201322 years make up the largest, fastest-growing demographic of mobile phone owners and users (Chen et al., 2016). The portability and convenience of mobile phones exacerbate the risk of mobile phone addiction (MPA). As a behavioral addiction, MPA refers to excessive immersion in mobile phone activities and a strong and persistent craving and dependence on mobile phone use that led to clear social and psychological damage (Yen et al., 2009). The prevalence rate of MPA may be 10\u201346% in college students in many countries, and this rate is on the rise (Jun, 2016; Lian et al., 2016). MPA has negative consequences for brain structure, cognition, mental health, sleep quality,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798776\nacademic performance, and interpersonal relationships (Yen et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Chun et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2020). In light of this, the expanding population and severe adverse effects of MPA should not be neglected."

            "text": "Perfectionism involves excessively high standards for performance, accompanied by the tendency to be overly critical evaluations of one\u2019s behavior (Frost et al., 1990; Hewitt and Flett, 1991). Factor-analytic studies have consistently yielded two higher-order dimensions of perfectionism that cut across many perfectionism conceptualizations: perfectionistic strivings (PS) (i.e., self-oriented, personal standards, and high standards) and Perfectionistic Concerns (PC) (i.e., socially prescribed, concern over mistakes, doubts about actions, discrepancy, parental expectations, and criticism) (Stoeber, 2018). According to Stoeber and Otto (2006), PS involves setting and striving for high standards and goals for oneself; PC is characterized by harsh self-scrutiny, overly critical self-evaluations, and chronic worry about the approval of others. Stoeber and Otto pointed out that PS (an equivocal and ambivalent construct) has both positive and negative associations. For example, selforiented perfectionism predicts high-examination performance via task-approach goals (Stoeber et al., 2015). Self-oriented perfectionists have a sense of personal control under low stress, whereas they exhibit high levels of depressive symptoms under high stress (Flett et al., 1995). Likewise, self-oriented perfectionism negatively predicts subjective well-being via low self-compassion, but positively predicts subjective well-being via compassion for others (Stoeber et al., 2019). Moreover, self-oriented perfectionism is related to high levels of distress via worry and rumination (Xie et al., 2019). In contrast to PS, research has consistently shown that PC is strongly linked to anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms, and eating disorders (Stoeber and Otto, 2006; Limburg et al., 2017). In addition, PC was the factor that distinguishes clinical forms of perfectionism from a healthy pursuit of excellence (Shafran et al., 2002; Dunkley et al., 2006). Furthermore, concern over one\u2019s mistakes (a critical component of PC) heightens one\u2019s susceptibility to psychological disorders (Frost and DiBartolo, 2002). Given that this study attempted to examine the relationship between PC and MPA of Chinese college students, especially the mediation process (i.e., how PC is associated with MPA) and the moderation process (i.e., when PC is associated with MPA).\nDavis (2001) proposed the cognitive-behavioral model of Pathological Internet Use (PIU), which emphasizes maladaptive cognitions as proximal contributory causes of PIU. Maladaptive cognitions can be divided into two main subtypes: thoughts about oneself and thoughts about the world. Maladaptive thoughts about the self are characterized by rumination, self-doubt, low self-efficacy, and negative self-appraisal. Research showed that PC was significantly related to rumination (Abdollahi, 2019; Xie et al., 2019). Meanwhile, self-doubt, low self-efficacy, and negative\nself-appraisal are central features of PC (Bieling et al., 2004; Rice et al., 2012). Thus, we proposed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: PC is positively related to MPA."

            "heading": "Academic Procrastination as a Mediator",
            "text": "Academic procrastination (AP) is an endemic problem among college students (Steel, 2007; Ebadi and Shakoorzadeh, 2015). Procrastination refers to the act of unnecessarily postponing or avoiding tasks to the point of experiencing personal discomfort (Solomon and Rothblum, 1984; Schraw et al., 2007). According to the temporal motivational theory (TMT), individuals with high PC worry about their mistakes, cast doubts about their actions, show a discrepancy between expectations and results, avoid disapproval by others, and excessively fear failure, which may make them more prone to postponing tasks (Steel and K\u00f6nig, 2006). Socially prescribed perfectionism is positively related to AP for Korean 7th graders (Bong et al., 2014). Similarly, several meta-analytic studies indicate that PC was positively associated with procrastination (Steel, 2007; Xie et al., 2018). In contrast, epistemological beliefs (appropriate beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning) predicted low levels of AP.\nThe significant negative aspects of AP include compromised performance, decreased learning, increased health risks, and subjective discomforts such as low academic self-efficacy, anxiety, worry, and depression (Rabin et al., 2011). The psychological decompensation hypothesis (Gao and Chen, 2006) proposes that when the normal psychological growth of an individual is hindered, the individual will turn to the internet for compensation. Moreover, pathological compensation will result in decompensation, leading to developmental deviations or interruptions and even internet addiction. For college students, AP is a deprivation of real-life and a disruption of their adaptive functions. In this case, they turn to the internet as a \u201crefuge\u201d to achieve a sense of accomplishment and mastery of the environment. Thus, AP represents an antecedent to MPA among college students. Given that PC is positively associated with AP and AP, in turn, is positively associated with MPA, we proposed the second hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: AP mediates the positive relationship between PC and MPA."

            "heading": "Causality Orientations as Moderators",
            "text": "Although PC may lead to AP and MPA, it is possible that not all the college students are equally influenced. Therefore, it is important to take an individual difference perspective by examining the moderating role of causality orientations. We tested the hypothesis that causality orientations would moderate the relationship between PC and MPA. Causality orientations are conceptions from causality orientations theory (COT), a mini-theory of self-determination theory (SDT) (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan and Deci, 2017). There are three broad classes of behavior and motivationally relevant psychological processes: autonomous, controlled, and impersonal. Autonomyoriented people tend to look for opportunities that provide self-determination and are actuated by choices that are based\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798776\non an awareness of one\u2019s needs and integrated goals. Controloriented individuals are pushed by external controls (i.e., time limits, social expectations, demands from others, and material rewards) or internally controlling imperatives indicating how one \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d behave. Impersonal orientation involves people\u2019s experiencing their behavior as being beyond their intentional control and out of their scope of competence.\nResearch relating to causality orientations and identity styles has revealed that autonomous orientation is positively associated with an informational identity style and negatively associated with a diffuse-avoidant style; controlled orientation is positively connected with a normative identity style and impersonal orientation predicts a diffuse-avoidant identity style (Soenens et al., 2005).\nInformational identity style involves being cognitively complex, persistent, and problem focused while coping (Berzonsky, 2004). Moreover, autonomous orientation plays a significant role in the processing of threats and negative events. In contrast to other individuals, those high in autonomous orientation showed better coping when reexposed to disturbing films (Weinstein and Hodgins, 2009). Therefore, it is expected that when confronted with AP, autonomy-oriented college students will perceive procrastination as a challenging situation and adaptively cope, thus decreasing the tendency to develop MPA. Hence, autonomous orientation, as an important protective factor, may alleviate the negative effects of AP, signaling deprivation, frustration, and disruption of inperson life and adaptive functioning. In other words, the relationship between AP and MPA may be moderated by autonomous orientation.\nThose with high normative identity style are less flexible and more rigid than those with high informational style. Moreover, in the face of feedback on failure, they tend to persist in a rigid ego-involved way (Koestner and Zuckerman, 1994). With regard to achievement, the controlled orientation appears to be related to the adoption of a pressured, extrinsic, and time-conscious approach to one\u2019s activities (Deci and Ryan, 1985). Therefore, when faced with AP, control-oriented students will feel greater internal and external pressure and take actions that may be maladaptive. Control-oriented people are more likely to engage in behaviors with impaired self-discipline, such as alcohol use or gambling (Neighbors et al., 2004; Neighbors and Larimer, 2004). Specifically, when confronted with AP, individuals with high controlled orientation would be more susceptible to MPA.\nThe impersonal causality orientation appears to be the motivational basis of a diffuse-avoidant identity style (Soenens et al., 2005), which means that people with this orientation tend to procrastinate, deny internal conflicts, put off decisions and actions, use maladaptive coping styles, and have a high degree of neuroticism (Duriez et al., 2004). Based on this, impersonaloriented individuals may experience more helplessness in AP and use maladaptive coping methods, such as escape, while the internet provides such a refuge. Therefore, it may be the picture that when faced with AP, impersonal-oriented students will surf the internet pathologically.\nIn addition, according to the diathesis-stress model (Monroe and Simons, 1991; Belsky and Pluess, 2009), negative traits can\naggravate the negative consequences of adverse environments. As such, both the controlled orientation and impersonal orientation can aggravate the effect of AP on MPA. Hence, both the controlled orientation and impersonal orientation may moderate the link between AP and MPA.\nFurthermore, according to previous studies on the combination of mediation and moderation models (Edwards and Lambert, 2007), if AP mediates the relationship between PC and MPA and causality orientations moderate the AP\u2013MPA link, the mediating effect of AP would be moderated by causality orientations. It is logical to deduce that causality orientations moderate the second stage of the mediating process of AP. Thus, we proposed the third hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3a: Autonomous orientation moderates the second stage of the mediation model. Specifically, the mediating effect would be weaker for college students high in autonomous orientation.\nHypothesis 3b: Controlled orientation moderates the second stage of the mediation model. Specifically, the mediating effect would be stronger for college students high in controlled orientation.\nHypothesis 3c: Impersonal orientation moderates the second stage of the mediation model. Specifically, the mediating effect would be weaker for college students high in impersonal orientation."

Two well-trained research assistants in each classroom administered the questionnaire using scripts and a manual of procedures to standardize the data collection process. After the surveys were completed, the participants received a token gift for participation. Of the participants who consented, we excluded 25 for missing data regarding the key variables. We included a total of 625 college students in the final analysis."

This result coincides with the cognitive-behavioral model of PIU described by Davis (2001). The model underlines the vital role of maladaptive cognitions in contributing to PIU. This finding has important theoretical implications in that it expands the scope of the model to MPA.\nIn addition, AP partially mediated the PC\u2013MPA link. For the first stage of the mediation process (i.e., the association between PC and AP), our finding is consistent with TMT, which proposes that individuals with high PC would presumably postpone tasks because of worries, doubts, and fears. For the second stage (i.e., the AP\u2013MPA link), the results coincide with the psychological decompensation hypothesis proposed by Gao and Chen (2006). Similarly, Suler (1999) and KardefeltWinther (2014) proposed that internet addiction or PIU often originates from unsatisfaction of people with the offline world (e.g., in-person life and adaptive functioning have been deprived, frustrated, or disrupted). Since AP represents a deprivation of academic life and produces motivation to compensate, college students turn to the internet to regain a sense of accomplishment and mastery of the environment. It is noteworthy that in addition to the indirect effect of PC on MPA, the direct effect of PC on MPA is still significant. This outcome underlines the key role of PC in predicting MPA.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798776\nThe results confirm our hypothesis and add to the limited literature on AP as an explanatory factor for how PC could contribute to MPA. Although previous studies have shown associations between PC and anxiety, depressive symptoms, eating disorders, and exercise addiction/dependence (Bieling et al., 2004; Di Schiena et al., 2012; Costa et al., 2016; Limburg et al., 2017; Rivi\u00e8re and Douilliez, 2017; \u00c7ak\u0131n et al., 2021), little research has explored the relationship between PC and MPA. Fewer studies have revealed the mediating mechanism between PC and MPA. This study goes beyond past research by documenting how PC could increase MPA, which could be of great help in the prevention of and interventions for MPA in today\u2019s digital era."

            "text": "Our third objective was to explore the moderating role of causality orientations in the indirect PC\u2013MPA link via AP. The moderating role of impersonal orientation was confirmed, while the moderating roles of autonomous orientation and controlled orientation were not supported. As implied by Figure 6, when the level of impersonal orientation is high, the mediating effect is positive, and when impersonal orientation is low, the mediating effect is non-significant. In other words, for college students with high impersonal orientation, PC predicts more AP, which in turn leads to more MPA. Presumably, college students with PC may be more likely to procrastinate. AP entails setbacks or even failures, especially for those high in impersonal orientation. Since impersonal orientation involves negative selfevaluations and helplessness, AP \u201cverifies\u201d the identification of their inferiority. In addition, as a result, they turn to the internet for \u201casylum.\u201d\nThis finding is consistent with prior research (Soenens et al., 2005) indicating that impersonal orientation is related to a diffuse-avoidant identity style, and when faced with difficulties and frustrations, students with high impersonal orientation are more likely to escape simply. It also provides further evidence for the diathesis-stress model (Monroe and Simons, 1991; Belsky and Pluess, 2009). As a maladaptive causality orientation, impersonal orientation can exacerbate or, in its relative absence, lessen the adverse consequences of AP, e.g., MPA.\nUnlike we assumed, neither autonomous orientation nor controlled orientation moderated the PC\u2013MPA link via AP. The non-significant findings may be explained by the interpretations presented below. First, because people high in autonomous orientation base their actions on their personal interests and perceive their behavior as being freely chosen, they will perceive AP as a challenge if they are interested in academic tasks as predicted based on SDT. However, if they are not interested in such tasks, they will probably not take action due to external stress. Second, unlike senior high schools where AP is the almost sole criterion of excellence, the criteria in universities are multiple and latent, and academic performance is just one aspect. Most likely, AP failed to trigger the control-oriented concerns of students over external contingencies."

            "text": "The present study advances our understanding of the MPA of college students and provides empirical evidence for the cognitive-behavioral model of PIU discussed by Davis (2001). Some limitations, however, must be considered when interpreting the findings. First, doubt about the direction of causality may arise due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. We constructed a moderated mediation model based on the psychological decompensation hypothesis. However, it is also possible that college students who use mobile phones pathologically have a tendency to procrastinate in their academic tasks (Dong et al., 2016; Hawi and Samaha, 2016). Thus, longitudinal and/or experimental designs are needed to establish causal relations and ascertain the causal direction of the results. Second, the data were based on the selfreports of college students, which may lead to the common method bias. Although the questionnaire has been validated by previous research, future studies would benefit from using multiple informants to collect data, such as from teachers and peers. Third, our results highlight the importance of PC in the development of MPA among college students, and future research could examine the potential impact of other factors, such as life events (Flett et al., 1995) and perceived stress (Eitle et al., 2013; Jun and Choi, 2015). Finally, the moderating roles of autonomous orientation and controlled orientation were not supported. The findings were interpreted using aspects such as the characteristics of autonomous orientation and controlled orientation, and the multiple criteria of excellence for universities, which requires further empirical study for verification.\nDespite these limitations, our findings have important practical implications. First, this study goes beyond the current literature by exploring the relationship between PC and MPA and indicates that PC is a significant risk factor for MPA. Thus, it is important to pay attention to college students high in PC to prevent MPA. Mindfulness training (Sollie et al., 2017) and cognitive control (Hoorelbeke et al., 2016) may reduce the rumination of people (a construct significantly related to PC) in the face of stress. Second, given that AP is a significant risk factor linking PC and MPA, reducing AP may be of importance to prevent college students from developing MPA. Solomon and Rothblum (1984) showed that fear of failure and aversiveness to a task are the two strongest predictors of AP. Therefore, it makes sense for educators to take measures to strengthen the self-efficacy of college students and nurture their interests in their academic tasks. Third, this study demonstrates the riskamplifying role of impersonal orientation in the second stage of the mediation process. It is crucial for educators to help college students endorse an internal locus of control and perform attribution training."
