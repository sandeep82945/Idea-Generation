    "abstractText": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising for lignin dissolution and extraction. However, they usually possess high polarity and are difficult to recycle. To overcome this drawback, a variety of switchable ionic liquids (SILs) composed of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and alcohols was synthesized and screened. According to the thermodynamic modeling suggestions, the selected DBU\u2013HexOH SIL was coupled with hydrogen-bond donors to form switchable-DES (SDES) systems with moderated viscosity, conductivity, and pH while maintaining switchability. The SDESs produced a well-improved lignin and lignin model compound solubility compared with those of SILs; charging CO2 into SDES (SDESCO2) caused a further increase in solubility. The solubility (25 \u25e6C) of syringic acid, ferulic acid, and milled wood lignin in SDESCO2 reached 230.57, 452.17, and 279.12 mg/g, respectively. Such SDES-dissolved lignin can be regenerated using acetone as an anti-solvent. The SDES-regenerated lignin exhibited a well-preserved structure with no noticeable chemical modifications. Furthermore, the SDESCO2 lignin possessed a higher molecular weight (Mw = 10,340 g/mol; Mn = 7672 g/mol), improved uniformity (polydispersity index = 1.35), and a higher guaiacyl lignin unit content compared with the original milled wood lignin. The SDES system proposed in the present work could benefit the fractionation of lignin compounds and facilitate downstream industrial processes.",

            "text": "Abundant reserves of lignocellulosic biomass make it an important renewable resource [1]. As a main component within lignocellulose, lignin is a three-dimensional amorphous polymer composed of methoxylated phenylpropane units [2]. Its aromatic structure causes lignin to be recognized as an important natural source of phenolic chemicals [3]; it is estimated that around 20 billion tons/year of such chemicals are produced by plants [4]. However, the chemical and physical interactions between lignin and carbohydrate components within lignocellulosic biomass make the separation of lignin difficult to achieve [5,6]. Traditional lignin separation approaches, such as chemical treatment, organic solvent treatment, mechanical treatment, and ionic liquid (IL) treatment methods [7], are well developed but, nevertheless, reported to have several drawbacks. Chemical treatment methods, for example, acid or alkali treatment, can achieve lignin separation through the degradation and dissolution of lignin macromolecules [8]; however, their applications are limited by severe lignin deconstruction and unavoidable chemical modifications. In addition, other shortcomings, such as the corrosion of equipment, wastewater treatment, and chemical recycling, also prohibit further application [9]. Organic solvents, such as N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide [10], can be used to dissolve and separate lignin from lignocellulose. However, most of these solvents are toxic and volatile. Because of\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15214233 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 2 of 20\nthis, such methods are commonly used for laboratory research and small-scale production [11,12]. Lignin can also be separated through a ball mill treatment [13]; however, this approach is extremely energy-consuming. ILs can selectively remove lignin from the lignocellulose [14], effectively overcoming the lignocellulose obstinacy [12]. Although it is reported to produce lignin with an increased chemical activity [15], the IL method is limited by its high cost [16], poor reusability [17], and, in some cases, it even exhibits greater toxicity than organic solvents [1]. Therefore, it is in the interests of both academic and industrial fields to develop efficient and sustainable methods for lignin dissolution and separation. A deep eutectic solvent (DES) is a eutectic solvent formulated by hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs) and hydrogen-bond acceptors (HBAs) [18]. ILs can sometimes act as typical HBAs in DES systems [19,20]. Indeed, the DESs share the advantages of ILs, which are low vapor pressure, easy synthesis, and adjustable physical and chemical properties [21]. With the addition of HBDs, a DES can be designed to be low cost [22], with reduced viscosity [23], good biodegradability [24], and low toxicity [25]. In recent years, DESs have been applied in many areas, for example, in organic reactions [26], biotransformations [27], sensor development [28], and pharmaceutical formulation [29]. Furthermore, DESs have been reported as promising solvents for lignocellulosic biomass fractionation due to their selective lignin extraction nature [30,31]. The extracted lignin is usually very pure and uniformly distributed. The selective cleavage of the ether bond in lignin macromolecules during DES treatment has been widely reported [32]. For example, choline chloride\u2013lactic acid DES produced a mild acid-based catalytic environment, which triggered the cleavage of ether bonds between phenylpropane units, resulting in lignin depolymerization and dissolution [33]. The strong hydrogen-bond network within the DES system also facilitated the selective extraction of lignin from the lignocellulose [34,35]. It was reported that acidic DESs with strong HBDs caused the proton-catalyzed cleavage of the ether, ester, and glycosidic linkages present in the lignin\u2013carbohydrate complex, leading to the extraction and depolymerization of lignin and xylan [36,37]. The DES treatment also led to the controllable cleavage of C\u2013O\u2013C and C\u2013C bonds within the lignin macromolecules to produce a lignin stream with improved values [38]. Zhu et al. used a choline chloride\u2013ethylene glycol DES to extract very pure lignin and well-preserved \u03b2-O-4 linkages [39]. Xu et al. used an ultrasound-assisted choline chloride\u2013formic acid DES to extract lignin with a small molecular size, narrow distribution, and well-preserved \u03b2-O-4 bonds [1]. Although these DES treatments have been proven as efficient lignin dissolution and extraction methods, they still present defects of poor reusability, mainly caused by their high polarities [40,41]. It is, therefore, worth developing a \u201cswitchable\u201d DES system, which could act as a polar solvent during the lignin dissolution and extraction processes and could also transfer into a non-polar state during recycling. Mixing organic superbases and alcohols, followed by bubbling with CO2, generates a so-called switchable ionic liquid (SIL) [42,43], whose chemical and physical properties can be altered by the addition of acid gases, such as CO2 and SO2 [43]. These SILs can be recycled by reversibly transforming to their molecular precursors by heating or by bubbling N2 [44]. Lam Phan et al. found that the exposure of a 1:1 mixture of two neutral liquids, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and monohydric alcohols, to gaseous CO2 at 1 atm caused an exothermic conversion of the liquid phase to an ionic-form substance (Figure 1) [42,45]. Anugwom et al. tested the possibility of using these SILs for lignocellulosic biomass treatment [46]. However, like IL defects, SILs are also expensive and highly viscous. Recently, several switchable DESs (SDESs) with a reversible phase transition nature, triggered by CO2, pH, and heat, were also developed [47]. Therefore, it would be beneficial to use the concept of DESs, taking SIL as an HBA and coupling it with a selected HBD, to generate a brand-new switchable solvent system, thereby overcoming the defects mentioned previously. A detailed review of the possibility of using switchable solvents for lignin dissolution and extraction was presented in our previous work [48]. The proposed solvent system could provide a low-cost, high-efficiency, and sustainable method\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 3 of 20\nfor lignin dissolution and extraction; this could further facilitate the development of plant fiber pretreatment technology.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 21\nmethod for lignin dissolution and extraction; this could further facilitate the development of plant fiber pretreatment technology.\nFigure 1. The reaction scheme for the switchable ionic liquids (SILs) [42].\nA variety of SILs composed of DBU and different alcohol compounds was synthesized and screened in this work. Optimized SIL was coupled with an HBD to form stable SDES systems; this was followed by using the systems to dissolve lignin and its model compounds. Lignin solubility was checked using ultraviolet spectroscopy, and characterizations such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (HSQC NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out, to confirm the possibility of using the proposed SDES system for lignin dissolution and extraction processes.\n2.

According to Figure 1, bubbling CO2 into SIL caused the formation of its ionic state (SILCO2), leading to a significant increase in viscosity, and sometimes even the formation of solids (Table A1). Among the testing SIL systems, most of the SILCO2 remained as a transparent and homogeneous liquid. For example, DBU\u2013PrOHCO2, DBU\u2013BuOHCO2, DBU\u2013HexOHCO2, and DBU\u2013OctOHCO2 were still viscous liquids in the presence of CO2.

This polarity conversion was verified by mixing SILs with a low-polarity reagent (decane). Taking the DBU\u2013HexOH SIL system as an example, the DBU\u2013HexOH is miscible with decane, whereas its ionic form (DBU\u2013HexOHCO2) is not. As shown in Figure 2b, the conversion in polarity remained after three CO2 charging\u2013discharging cycles. Pumping CO2 through the homogenous SIL\u2013decane solution caused the formation of emulsion, while simply removing CO2 by heating restored miscibility. DBU\u2013PrOH, DBU\u2013BuOH, and DBU\u2013OctOH SIL systems (Table A1) demonstrated a similar polarity conversion performance to that of DUB\u2013HexOH. Other SIL systems, however, encountered difficulties in restoring their non-polar state from SILCO2 during the heating process, possibly due to the strong interaction formed between the alcohol compound and CO2 [62]. Our study, therefore, focused on the analysis of DBU\u2013PrOH, DBU\u2013BuOH, DBU\u2013HexOH, and DBU\u2013 OctOH SIL systems.

Other SIL systems, however, encountered difficulties in restoring their non-polar state from SILCO2 during the heating process, possibly due to the strong interaction formed between the alcohol compound and CO2 [62]. Our study, therefore, focused on the analysis of DBU\u2013PrOH, DBU\u2013BuOH, DBU\u2013HexOH, and DBU\u2013OctOH SIL systems. The formation of ionic compounds was confirmed by analyzing the conductivity and viscosity of the SIL systems. Generally, SIL a d SIL\u2032 demonstrated significantly lower conductivity than that of SILCO2. Alcohol and DBU (0.012 \u00b5S/cm) both possess low electroconductivities. As expected, the SILs generated by mixing DBU and alcohols produced low conductivities. The conductivity of SIL, shown in Figure 2c, decreased with the growth of carbon chains, and the conductivity of DBU\u2013PrOH, DBU\u2013BuOH, DBU\u2013HexOH, and\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 7 of 20\nDBU\u2013OctOH gradually decreased from 0.148 \u00b5S/cm to 0.021 \u00b5S/cm. Introducing CO2 allowed the SIL to convert into its ionic form, producing a dramatic increase in conductivity in the SILCO2. Among all the tested SIL systems, DBU\u2013HexOHCO2 presented the highest conductivity of 1.250 \u00b5S/cm. Discharging CO2 allowed the electroconductivity to be restored. However, the conductivity of SIL\u2032 was generally higher than that of the SIL system; this could be attributed to the incomplete removal of CO2 during the heating process. In terms of their viscosities, SILs presented slightly higher viscosities than those of DBU (0.0005 Pa\u00b7s) and alcohols (~10\u22124 Pa\u00b7s). As shown in Figure 2d, the viscosities of SILs were within the range of 0.007 Pa\u00b7s\u20130.0126 Pa\u00b7s. Similar to conductivity, charging with CO2 caused a surge in SIL viscosity, especially for the DBU\u2013BuOHCO2 (0.9127 Pa\u00b7s) and DBU\u2013HexOHCO2 (0.8531 Pa\u00b7s) samples. Similarly, viscosity was restored by removing CO2 from the system. The significant increase in viscosity relates to the formation of an ionic compound: This created more and stronger ionic interactions, enhancing the internal friction in SILCO2. As shown in Figure 2, the DBU\u2013BuOH and DBU\u2013HexOH SIL systems demonstrated the most notable switching ability for conductivity and viscosity, whereas DBU\u2013BuOHCO2 (Figure 2c) presented some difficulties in terms of CO2 release when heated. Although there was only a minor difference in their SIL and SIL\u2019 viscosities, the conductivity of DBU\u2013BuOH\u2019 (0.616 \u00b5S/cm) was much higher than that of DBU\u2013BuOH (0.126 \u00b5S/cm), indicating the incomplete removal of CO2. Therefore, DBU\u2013HexOH was deemed the preferred SIL system, as its solvent properties can easily be restored from 1.250 \u00b5S/cm to 0.240 \u00b5S/cm, demonstrating a preferred switching ability. DBU is a strong organosuperbase with a pH of 15.01; SILs composed of DBU and alcohols, therefore, also present strong basicity. As shown in Figure 2e, no noticeable variations in the pH of DBU\u2013PrOH, DBU\u2013BuOH, DBU\u2013HexOH, or DBU\u2013OctOH, which ranges from 14.96 to 14.75, could be obtained. Charging with CO2 caused the formation of SILCO2 and decreased its pH to around 12, while removing CO2 restored the SIL pH to about 14, which is close to that of SIL. Therefore, the SIL system pH was also regulated by charging and discharging CO2. For example, DBU\u2013HexOH had a pH of 14.76; charging CO2 decreased the pH to 11.92 (DBU\u2013HexOHCO2), and removing CO2 by heating restored the pH to 14.24 in DBU\u2013HexOH\u2019. However, it is proposed that a strong basicity environment may affect the aromatic structure of lignin, destroy the C\u2013O single bond in lignin, and lead to a significant chemical modification of lignin macromolecules [63]. It would be wise to introduce a cosolvent to moderate the alkaline operating condition, as this may ease the side reactions. In addition, the cosolvent would help reduce the high viscosity of SILCO2, which may prohibit lignin dissolution."

However, for this specific use, it should be carefully selected to stabilize the SIL system and promote the hydrogen-bond network within. The molecular simulation was, therefore, conducted with the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMORS), in which quantum chemical calculations were combined with statistical mechanics to explore the thermodynamic behavior of the DBU and HexOH used in this work [61]. As was previously demonstrated, charging CO2 into SIL caused the formation of ionic SILCO2. The molecule structures and their charge distributions of the chemicals in the DBU\u2013HexOH SIL system are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen in Figure 3a, charging CO2 caused the formation of a strong hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) center (blue-purple area) on the DBUH from DBU. In addition, a strong hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) zone (red area) was created on the HexCO3 from the HexOH. Therefore, in addition to the strong ionic interaction in SILCO2, possible hydrogen bonds could also exist in the DBU\u2013HexOHCO2 mixtures. Figure 3b shows the charge distribution on the molecular surface, where the \u03c3 values lower than \u22120.0082 e/\u00c52 are the HBD region, \u03c3 values between \u22120.0082 e/\u00c52 and 0.0082 e/\u00c52 represent the non-polar region, and values higher than 0.00821 e/\u00c52 are the HBA region.

According to the reaction scheme (Figure 1), charging with CO2 converted them into DBUH and HexCO3, where a strong HBD peak at \u22120.021 e/\u00c52 and an HBA peak at 0.020 e/\u00c52 are noticed. The sigma potential results in Figure 3c indicate that only a small change in the mixture was induced by CO2 charging, both DBU\u2013 HexOH and its ionic form (DBU\u2013HexOHCO2) presenting a strong HBD affinity. Due to charging with CO2, the formation of ionic substances in SILCO2, therefore, mainly contributes to the internal ionic interactions and only produces a minor effect on the overall hydrogen-bonding ability of the mixture. In addition, based on the COSMO-RS modeling results, introducing a cosolvent such as an HBD is an effective method of enriching the hydrogen-bonding network inside the proposed SIL solvent system. Water normally acts as both an HBD and HBA, presenting characteristic peaks located at \u22120.016 and 0.017 e/\u00c52, respectively. The addition of water allowed it to perform as an ideal HBD in both the nonionic (SIL) and ionic (SILCO2) states of the DBU\u2013HexOH system. As shown in Figure 3b, water presented peaks both in the strong (\u22120.016 e/\u00c52) and weak (\u22120.013 e/\u00c52) HBD regions, both of which overwhelmed the HBD assignments within the DBU\u2013HexOH and DBU\u2013HexOHCO2 (DBUH and HexCO3) systems.

The addition of the HBD should be able to reduce the viscosity and cost of the solvent, expand the liquid range, and enhance the solubility [36,37]. In this work, SIL and various HBDs were mixed (Figure A1); water was selected as an ideal HBD for the formation of a stable homogeneous and transparent DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O system with a 1:5 mass ratio, either with or without the presence of CO2 (Figure A2). It can be seen from Table A1 that charging CO2 into SDES caused the elevation of conductivity from 4.848 \u00b5S/cm (DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O) to 23.030 \u00b5S/cm (DBU\u2013 HexOH/H2OCO2), and removing CO2 allowed the electroconductivity to be restored. However, the conductivity of DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O\u2032 (10.066 \u00b5S/cm) was higher than that of DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O; this could be attributed to the incomplete removal of CO2 due to the presence of water. Charging with CO2 also increased the viscosity of the SDES system, from 0.0186 Pa\u00b7s (DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O) to 0.0825 Pa\u00b7s (DBU\u2013HexOH/H2OCO2). Moreover, releasing CO2 by heating allowed the viscosity of the DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O to be restored to 0.0466 Pa\u00b7s. It should be noted that the addition of the HBD significantly reduced the viscosity in the ionic state to about 1/10 of that for the SIL system (0.8531 Pa\u00b7s for SILCO2 vs. 0.0825 for SDESCO2). In addition, the pH of the DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O was 14.26: Charging with CO2 decreased the pH to 9.50 (DBU\u2013HexOH/H2OCO2), which was much lower than that of SILCO2 (DBU\u2013HexOHCO2, pH 11.92). Therefore, the proposed SDES, composed of a mixture of DBU\u2013HexOH and water, could moderate the viscosity and pH of the SIL system, while allowing it to maintain its switchable nature, making the SDES more suitable for the lignin dissolution process."

            "text": "The solubility of lignin model compounds in the SIL and SDES systems is shown in Table 1. The DBU\u2013HexOH SIL system demonstrated limited lignin solubility, dissolving 12.12 mg/g syringic acid, 2.01 mg/g vanillic acid, 2.24 mg/g syringaldehyde, 22.87 mg/g ferulic acid, and 10.88 mg/g alkaline lignin at room temperature. However, its ionic form (DBU\u2013HexOHCO2) did not demonstrate any lignin solubility. This phenomenon is very similar to that of DBU, which is a major component in SIL. DBU dissolved 22.79 mg/g syringic acid, 4.54 mg/g vanillic acid, 1.17 mg/g syringaldehyde, 2.26 mg/g ferulic acid, and 1.91 mg/g alkaline lignin at room temperature but did not demonstrate lignin solubility after being charged with CO2. As the other component in SIL, monohydric alcohol, however, demonstrated a different lignin solubility. Both HexOH and HexOHCO2 presented a very small but similar solubility to vanillic acid, syringaldehyde, and ferulic acid. However, charging with CO2 increased their solubility for syringic acid, and alkaline lignin increased from 34.9 mg/g and 9.72 mg/g to 40.24 and 16.30, respectively. Although water presented limited lignin solubility and no notable change after charging with CO2, the proposed DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O SDES system, mixed with SIL and water, demonstrated a notable increase in lignin solubility. The solubility of syringic acid, vanillic acid, syringaldehyde, and ferulic acid in DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O achieved 207.58 mg/g, 21.95 mg/g, 7.98 mg/g, and 58.12 mg/g, respectively. These could be further increased by charging CO2 into the system. The solubility of syringic acid, vanillic acid, syringaldehyde, and ferulic acid in the DBU\u2013HexOH/H2OCO2 system was 230.57 mg/g, 78.43 mg/g, 11.64 mg/g, and 452.17 mg/g, respectively. Therefore, the lignin solubility in the SDES system could also be regulated by the addition of CO2, and this would vary depending on the type of lignin model compounds. Particularly, for vanillic acid and ferulic acid, after charging CO2 into SDES, their solubility increased by 357% and 778%, respectively. However, the solubility of alkaline lignin in SDES decreased from 5.67 mg/g to 4.44 mg/g after forming its ionic state. Therefore, the proposed SDES mixed with DBU\u2013HexOH and H2O demonstrated improved lignin solubility, and this was also regulated by charging and discharging CO2.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 10 of 20\nThe proposed SDES system was further tested for the dissolution of milled wood lignin (MWL). The DBU\u2013HexOH SIL dissolved 9.05 mg/g MWL, while the DBU\u2013HexOH/ H2O SDES dissolved up to 213.35 mg/g MWL. Charging CO2 into the SDES further increased MWL solubility to 279.12 mg/g. The SDES-dissolved lignin was easily regenerated using acetone as an anti-solvent, with a yield of 84.31% (SDESCO2\u2013MWL). The variations in weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), and the polydispersity index (PDI) before and after SDES treatment were tested using gel permeation chromatography (GPC); the results are given in Table 2. In comparison with the MWL lignin, both regenerated lignin samples demonstrated a higher molecular weight. The native lignin sample (MWL) was 7701 g/mol Mw and 2959 g/mol Mn, with a PDI of 2.60. The SDES-treated MWL sample had a similar PDI to that of its raw material (MWL), but the regenerated lignin demonstrated an elevated molecular weight of 9823 g/mol Mw and 3397 g/mol Mn. SDESCO2 treatment resulted in a lignin stream with a much higher molecular weight (Mw = 10,340 g/mol, Mn = 7672 g/mol) and with an improved uniformity (PDI = 1.35). Compared with the traditional DES\u2013 lignin (Table 2), the lignin stream produced in this work had a well-preserved long-chain structure and a much higher molecular weight. Therefore, the GPC results indicate that the SDES treatment is a promising method for lignin dissolution and extraction, as it not only regulated the lignin solubility with CO2 but also produced a lignin stream with a high molecular weight and improved uniformity, both of which may benefit the downstream process.\nNote: - Data with extremely low solubility and which could not be detected.\nThe thermal oxidative degradation and stability of the MWL before and after SDES treatments were investigated using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [65]. As shown in Figure 4a, all the testing samples exhibited a similar thermal performance, divided into three stages. The first stage was the initial degradation stage (80~200 \u25e6C), most likely caused by the removal of moisture and volatile components [66]. The second stage was the main degradation stage of lignin (200~400 \u25e6C), where lignin degradation occurred. Carboxylation breakdown of aliphatic hydroxyl groups and ether bonds present in the structure of lignin occurred, while degradation can be attributed\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 11 of 20\nto the side chain dehydrogenation reaction [67]. Both SDES\u2013MWL and SDESCO2\u2013MWL samples demonstrated a more significant mass loss, which is possibly due to the partial breakage of connections between lignin macromolecules after regeneration. The third stage was the carbonization stage (400~600 \u25e6C), where methoxy groups and C\u2013C bonds of lignin were disrupted, with the release of volatiles and production of bio-oils [68]. The decomposition of the lignin sample in Figure 4a occurred slowly at this stage, resulting in char residue [69]. This could be attributed to the production of highly branched and extremely condensed aromatic structures. The MWL sample produced a high char residue rate of 66.7%; this could be attributed to the fact that the sample had a highly complex and condensed lignin structure. MWL is easily converted to char residue owing to its structural resemblance [68]. Once the MWL had reached a temperature of 600 \u25e6C, the quality of the coke was stable and no further reaction occurred. However, both SDES- and SDESCO2-treated MWL produced lower char residue rates: 28.3% and 1.3%, respectively. This indicates the lower thermal stability of SDES\u2013MWL and SDESCO2\u2013 MWL compared with that of the MWL sample.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 21\nCarboxylation breakdown of aliphatic hydroxyl groups and ether bonds present in the structure of lignin occurred, while degradation can be attributed to the side chain dehydrogenation reaction [67].

Thermogravimetric analysis (a) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (b) of lignin samples.\nStructural characterization of lignin before and after SDES treatment was performed using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy; the assignments of the characterizing peaks are shown in Table A2. As shown in Figure 4b, the stretching vibration for hydroxyl is observed at 3422 cm\u22121 [70]. The stretching vibrations for the lignin aromatic ring skeleton at 1600 cm\u22121 and 1507 cm\u22121 can be seen in all testing samples; this indicates that no significant change in the aromatic ring structure of MWL occurred during the SDES treatments [34,71]. The peak at 2936 cm\u22121 was attributed to the C\u2013H vibration in CH3-/CH2 = groups. The characteristic peaks at the wave number of 1461 cm\u22121 were assigned to the C\u2013H asymmetric vibration of CH2 = groups and C\u2013H transformation in the aromatic rings [3]. All the characteristic peaks mentioned above were found in all the testing samples. Stretching vibrations for C=O bonds are typically found between 1740 and 1700 cm\u20131; this is where signals attributable to C=O bonds in unconjugated ketones, carbonyls, and ester groups are normally observed. Lower absorption energies (around 1700 cm\u20131) were reported for conjugated aldehydes and carboxyl acids [72]. MWL produced a characteristic peak at 1710 cm\u20131, while SDES\u2013MWL and SDESCO2\u2013MWL demonstrated lower intensities within this range, indicating lower carbonyl and carboxyl group content. The peak at 1327 cm\u22121 was attributed to the stretching vibration of the C\u2013O in the syringyl (S) lignin unit, whereas the peaks at 1270 cm\u22121 represent the stretching vibration of the C\u2013O in the guaiacyl (G) lignin unit [73]. The peak at 1124 cm\u22121 demonstrates the presence of syringyl moieties in lignin because it represents the C\u2013H deformation of the lignin S unit. Therefore, a\nFigure 4.

The peak at 1124 cm\u22121 demonstrates the presence of syringyl moieties in lignin because it represents the C\u2013H deformation of the lignin S unit. Therefore, a feature of GS-type lignin was demonstrated in the FTIR spectra. Additionally, the signal at 1036 cm\u22121, corresponding to the C\u2013O deformation of primary \u2013Ohs, was detected in all\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 12 of 20\nlignin fragments [74]. The FTIR spectra did not show any noticeable chemical modifications occurring in MWLs during the SDES treatments. Detailed structural analysis of MWL and SDES\u2013MWL and SDESCO2\u2013MWL was characterized using 2D HSQC NMR spectroscopy [75,76]; the side chain (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 50\u201390/2.5\u20136.0) and the aromatic (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 100\u2013135/5.5\u20138.5) regions of the lignin samples are shown in Figure 5, and the main lignin cross-signal assignments are listed in Table A3. The related signals for \u03b2-aryl ether ethers (A), resin alcohols (B), and phenylcoumaranes (C) in the lignin samples were found in all the testing samples, indicating a well-preserved lignin structure after treatment. The peaks corresponding to \u03b2-aryl ether connections are shown for A\u03b1 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 71.8/4.86 ppm), A\u03b3 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 59.5\u201359.7/3.40\u20133.63 ppm), A\u2032\u03b3 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 63.2/4.33\u20134.49 ppm), A\u03b2(G/H) (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 83.9/4.29 ppm), and A\u03b2(S) (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 85.9/4.12 ppm). \u03b2-\u03b2 connections are shown for B\u03b1 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 84.8/4.65 ppm), B\u03b2 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 53.5/3.06 ppm), and B\u03b3 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 71.0/3.82 and 4.18 ppm). \u03b2-5 connections are shown for C\u03b1 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 86.8/5.46 ppm), C\u03b2 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 53.3/3.46 ppm), and C\u03b3 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 62.5/3.73 ppm). Moreover, methoxyl connections were found at \u03b4C/\u03b4H 55.6/3.73 ppm. The signals for the C\u03b1\u2013H\u03b1, C\u03b2\u2013H\u03b2, and C\u03b3\u2013H\u03b3 correlations of substructures (I) were seen clearly at \u03b4C/\u03b4H 128.4/6.44, 128.2/6.25, and 61.4/4.10, respectively. It was found that all the lignin samples exhibited similar spectral patterns. Three main types of linkages, namely, aromatic ether bond \u03b2-O-4, \u03b2-\u03b2 in resin, and \u03b2-5 in phenylcoumarane [73], were observed in all testing lignin samples, with only minor changes in their distributions. The MWL produced \u03b2-O-4 linkages of 40.71/100Ar, \u03b2-\u03b2 linkages of 2.71/100Ar, and \u03b2-5 linkages of 3.57/100Ar cross-peaks; the SDES\u2013MWL produced \u03b2-O-4 linkages of 38.29/100Ar, \u03b2-\u03b2 linkages of 3.76/100Ar, and \u03b2-5 linkages of 4.03/100Ar; finally, the SDESCO2\u2013MWL produced \u03b2-O-4 linkages of 38.27/100Ar, \u03b2-\u03b2 linkages of 3.37/100Ar, and \u03b2-5 linkages of 3.63/100Ar. The main linkages within lignin macromolecules, therefore, remained unchanged after the SDES and SDESCO2 treatments, which agrees with the FTIR results. In addition, all the lignin samples exhibited strong signals for methoxy moieties, indicating that the \u2013OCH3 groups also remained unchanged after the SDES and SDESCO2 treatments. In the aromatic region, the C2,6\u2013H2,6 correlations from S-type units and the sum of C2\u2013H2, C5\u2013H5, and C6\u2013H6 correlations from G-type units were used to estimate the S/G ratio [74]. A strong signal at \u03b4C/\u03b4H 103.8/6.71 belonged to the S unit at C2,6\u2013H2,6, whereas the G units showing the cross-peak signals for C2\u2013H2 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 110.9/6.98), C5\u2013H5 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 114.9/6.77), and C6\u2013H6 (\u03b4C/\u03b4H 119.0/6.80) can be found in all the lignin samples. It can, therefore, be confirmed that the MWL used in this work was predominantly comprised of S and G units. The S/G ratios of MWL, SDES\u2013MWL, and SDESCO2\u2013MWL were 0.88, 0.73, and 0.76, respectively, indicating that the SDES and SDESCO2 treatments caused slightly more Stype lignin loss than G-type lignin loss. Other signals observed in the aromatic regions could be assigned to p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohol end groups (I), cinnamaldehyde end groups (J), and p-hydroxybenzoate substructures (PB). The C\u2013H correlated signals for I and J were found at \u03b4C/\u03b4H 128.2/6.44 and 126.1/6.76 ppm, respectively. The C2,6\u2013H2,6 correlations for PB were observed as a strong signal at \u03b4C/\u03b4H 131.2/7.67. These characterization results clearly demonstrate, again, that the lignin macromolecule framework remained intact following both the SDES and SDESCO2 treatments.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4233 13 of 20 Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 21\nFigure 5.

            "text": "In this work, switchable ionic liquids (SILs) composed of DBU and different alcohols were screened, based on their solvent properties. DBU\u2013HexOH was selected as the optimized SIL for its stable liquid state and notable switchable nature in conductivity, viscosity, and pH, created by the addition and removal of CO2. According to the thermodynamic molecular modeling results, the selected SIL was coupled with a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) to form a switchable deep eutectic solvent (SDES) system, providing moderate viscosity and pH while maintaining its switchable nature. The DBU\u2013HexOH SIL system resulted in a switchable lignin dissolution performance, which was regulated by charging and discharging CO2. The addition of water as an HBD improved lignin solubility in the SDES, while preserving its switchable nature. The DBU\u2013HexOH SIL dissolved 9.05 mg/g MWL, while the DBU\u2013HexOH/H2O SDES dissolved up to 213.35 mg/g MWL. Charging CO2 into the SDES further increased MWL solubility to 279.12 mg/g. The lignin dissolved in SDES systems can be regenerated using acetone as an anti-solvent. Both FTIR and HSQC results indicate that the SDES- and SDESCO2-treated lignin did not produce any notable chemical modifications compared to the MWL sample. Interestingly, the regenerated lignin treated by SDESCO2 produced a high molecular weight (Mw = 10,340 g/mol; Mn = 7672 g/mol) and improved uniformity (PDI = 1.35). On the other hand, the original MWL was only 7701 g/mol Mw and 2959 g/mol Mn, with a PDI of 2.60. Therefore, the presented work proposed a notable SDES system, whose solvent properties can be regulated by the charging and discharging of CO2. Moreover, it can be used for lignin dissolution and extraction to produce a lignin stream with a well-preserved structure, high molecular weight, and improved uniformity, all of which may facilitate the downstream process.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.Q. and D.L.; methodology, L.Q. and J.C.; software, D.L. and Y.G.; modeling, Y.X. and L.Q.; validation, D.L. and M.Y.; formal analysis, D.L., Y.G. and M.Y.; resources, L.Q., J.C. and G.Y.; data curation, D.L. and Y.X.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.Q., G.Y. and M.H.; visualization, D.L. and L.Q.; supervision, L.Q. and J.C.; project administration, L.Q.; funding acquisition, L.Q., G.Y. and J.C.
