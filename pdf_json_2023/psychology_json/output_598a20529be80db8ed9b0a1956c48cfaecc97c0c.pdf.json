    "abstractText": "Background Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder. The available drugs for this disease only control convulsions in nearly 70% of patients, while bearing many side effects. In this study, a new series of phenoxyphenyl\u20101,3,4\u2010oxadiazole\u2010 thio\u2010N\u2010phenylacetamid hybrids 8a-m was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potent anticonvulsant agents. Methods Phenoxyphenyl\u20101,3,4\u2010oxadiazole\u2010thio\u2010N\u2010phenylacetamid derivatives 8a-m were synthesized with well\u2010known chemical reactions and anticonvulsant activity of them was determined by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal elec\u2010 troshock (MES) induced seizures in mice. Phenoxyphenyl\u20101,3,4\u2010oxadiazole\u2010thio\u2010N\u2010phenylacetamid scaffold has the neces\u2010 sary pharmacophores to be a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor agonist, thus, the most potent anticonvulsant compounds were assayed in vivo and in silico as BZD receptor agonist. Furthermore, in vivo neurotoxicity evaluation and in silico physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity study on the most potent compounds were also performed. Results Obtained results demonstrated that two compounds among the title new compounds have anticonvulsant activity in PTZ test while all of the new compounds are active in the MES test. The best anticonvulsant activities were obtained with nitro derivatives 8k and 8L. In vivo evaluation of flumazenil effect (a BZD receptor antagonist) on anti\u2010 convulsant activity of compound 8k confirmed that this compound is a BZD receptor agonist. The most potent compounds 8k and 8L interacted with the important residues of BZD\u2010binding site of GABAA receptor. Furthermore, neurotoxicity of the latter compounds was lower than positive control diazepam. Conclusion According to these results, our designed scaffold can be a valuable lead structure for further structural developments and assessments to obtain a new potent anticonvulsant agent.",

            "text": "Epilepsy is an important neurological disorder that affects nearly 50\u00a0 million people worldwide [1]. Almost 90% of the epileptic patients live in developing countries [2]. This disease is characterized by the excessive temporal neuronal discharges that lead to uncontrolled convulsions [3]. The commercially available anticonvulsant medications show numerous side effects such as gingival hyperplasia, rash, ataxia, hepatotoxicity, vertigo, and megaloblastic anemia [4]. Furthermore, in one third of the epileptic patients, anticonvulsant drugs do not provide complete relief or control of seizures [5]. According to these points, there is high demand to develop effective and reliable agents for the treatment of epilepsy.\nA useful tool for the design of new drugs in medicinal chemistry is molecular hybridization [6]. The basis of this method is to find effective pharmacophores from bioactive compounds and connecting them to each other in order to obtain a new lead compound for drug discovery.\nOne of the popular cores in the design of new anticonvulsant agents is 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring. Anticonvulsant potential of this ring has reported by various research groups [7\u20139]. Furthermore, 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring in combination with phenoxyphenyl group was found in the several series of the potent anticonvulsant agents such as compounds A (Fig.\u00a01) [10]. On the other hand, Saidov et\u00a0al. reported the synthesis and anticonvulsant activity of a series of thio-N-phenylacetamid derivatives B (Fig.\u00a0 1) [11]. Consequently, our research group designed the new\nstructures 8a-m by considering phenoxyphenyl-1,3,4oxadiazole and thio-N-phenylacetamid of anticonvulsant agents A and B (Fig.\u00a0 1). Designed phenoxyphenyl-1,3,4oxadiazole-thio-N-phenylacetamid derivatives 8a-m synthesized by simple chemical reactions, and their anticonvulsant and pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated by in\u00a0vivo and in silico methods.\nBenzodiazepines (BZD) are an important class of anticonvulsant drugs [12]. These compounds are BZD receptor agonist, and in addition to epilepsy, they possess a known position in the treatment of various neurologic and psychiatric conditions like anxiety, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, insomnia, and muscle spasms [13]. BZDs exert the mentioned activities by positive allosteric effect on GABAA receptors. The latter receptors are chloride ion channels, with the protein structure composing five subunits: one \u03b3-, two \u03b2- and two \u03b1-subunits. BZDs via BZD binding site attach to GABAA receptors. The key residues in BZD binding site are \u03b11 Tyr159, \u03b11 Tyr 209, \u03b11 Thr206, \u03b11 Vall211, \u03b11 His101, and \u03b32 Phe77 [14]. The Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) of BZDs has revealed that a compound with the following structural properties could be a BZD receptor agonist: (A) an aromatic ring, (B) a co-planar proton accepting moiety in a suitable distance, and (C) second out-of\u2010 plane aromatic ring (Fig.\u00a0 2) [15]. Examining the structure of the newly designed compounds showed that these compounds have the necessary characteristics to be considered as BZD receptor agonists. Furthermore, to determine the\nmechanism of action of these new chemicals, in\u00a0vivo and in silico studies were also performed."

The first step of the synthetic method comprised the synthesis of ethyl 2-phenoxybenzoate 2 by esterification of 2-phenoxybenzoic acid 1 in the presences of ethanol and sulfuric acid. In the next step, 2-phenoxybenzoate 2 was reacted with hydrazine 3 to give 2-phenoxybenzohydrazide 4. In the third step, the latter compound was converted to 5-(2-phenoxyphenyl)-1,3,4oxadiazole-2-thiol 6 in the presence of carbon disulfide 5 in alcoholic potassium hydroxide [11]. In the final step, phenoxyphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-thio-N-phenylacetamid derivatives 8a-m were synthesized by reaction between compound 6 with N-phenyl-2-chloroacetamides 7a-m in the presence of K2CO3 in DMF."

As can be seen in Scheme\u00a0 1, in order to delineate the SAR and to get an optimized anticonvulsant agent, substituents on phenyl ring of thio-N-phenylacetamid moiety were altered."

The animals were prepared by the Center for Breeding and Care of Laboratory animals, School of Pharmacy, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran. The animals were kept at 25 \u00b1 2\u00a0 \u00b0C, 12\u00a0h light/dark cycle in the standard Plexiglas cage with free access to food and water. Animals were transferred to the research laboratory at least 1\u00a0h before the experiments, and each animal was just used for one experiment. The synthesized chemicals were administered 30\u00a0 min before the induction of convulsion by the\nMES (Maximal Electroshock) or PTZ (Pentylenetetrazol) method, and the number of protected animals against the induced convulsion was noted. To evaluate the possible role of benzodiazepine receptors in the effect of the most potent synthesized compounds, Flumazenil (1\u00a0mg/ kg) was administered 15\u00a0min prior to seizure induction. In the MES test, a current with characteristics of 60\u00a0Hz and 50 mA was administered for 0.2\u00a0s via ear electrodes previously moistened with normal saline for more effective delivery of the current. The abolishment of the Hind Leg Tonic Extension (HLTE) was considered as the protection of animal against the convulsion. In the PTZ test, PTZ was injected in the dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg, the subjects were carefully observed for the next 0.5\u00a0h for the occurrence of the tonic-clonic lethal convulsion, and the results were represented as the number of protected animals to the number of tested animals [16].\nThe rout of administration for the different substances was intraperitoneal (i.p) injection. DMSO was used as the solvent for the preparation of fresh solution of flumazenil and the synthesized compounds; PTZ was dissolved in normal saline 0.9%. Final volume of injection for the solutions containing DMSO and normal saline 0.9% was 5 and 10 ml/kg body weight, respectively. Moreover, in both the PTZ and MES tests, diazepam (2\u00a0mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist with prominent anticonvulsant properties was administered as the positive control, and a separate group of animals received DMSO as the negative control. The number of animals used for each dose/experiment was 4, and the numbers more than 4 illustrated in Table\u00a01 for some chemicals indicates repeat of experiment for the clarification of results. At the end of experiments, CO2 was used to euthanize the animals."

Since there was no crystallographic structure of GABAA receptor in the protein data bank, we used Richter et\u00a0 al.\u2018s homology model for the BZD binding pocket. This model was a diazepam-bound GABAA receptor with pdb format [14]. The 3D structure of the selected compounds 8k, 8L, and 8f was provided using MarvineSketch 5.8.3, 2012, ChemAxon (http:// www. chema xon. com) and the obtained PDB formats\nwere converted to PDBQT formats using AutoDock Tools version 1.5.6 (http:// mglto ols. scrip ps. edu). The same software also provided the PDBQT format of the BZD binding pocket. Docking grid box for this study was placed in 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 40 \u00c5 points with x = 43.640, y = 43.866 and z = 9.3290 \u00c5 directions and each docked system was carried out by 50 runs (AUTODOCK search, Lamarckian genetic algorithm). The obtained ligand-receptor complex conformations were evaluated by BIOVIA Discovery Studio v.3.5."
