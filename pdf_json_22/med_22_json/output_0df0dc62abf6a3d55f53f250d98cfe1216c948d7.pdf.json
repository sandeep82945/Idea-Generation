    "abstractText": "Purpose: Given its growing popularity and the richness of its content, the influence of the Internet on the academic achievement of adolescents has attracted increasing attention. However, how Internet use affects adolescents\u2019 academic achievement has not yet been fully discussed in the Chinese context. This study sought to examine the relation between Internet use and adolescents\u2019 academic achievement, as well as the mediating effect of future orientation and the urban-rural differences in this mediating effect. Materials and Methods: Junior high-school students from three schools in Nanjing, China, were recruited to participate in a correlational survey. A total of 1381 participants aged 12\u201316 years completed the Internet use questionnaire, the future orientation scale, and reported their scores on the most recent grade unified examination. Results: The analysis results revealed that, after controlling for the variables of grade and gender, (1) the Internet use significantly and positively predicted academic achievement; (2) The future orientation significantly mediated the relation between Internet use and academic achievement; (3) and the effect of Internet use on future orientation was moderated by urban and rural areas. The effect of Internet use in promoting future orientation was only significant among rural adolescents. Conclusion: The results contribute to a better understanding of how Internet use affects adolescents\u2019 academic achievement, revealing that Internet use is of particular significance in the development of rural adolescents.",

However, how Internet use affects adolescents\u2019 academic achievement has not yet been fully discussed in the Chinese context. This study sought to examine the relation between Internet use and adolescents\u2019 academic achievement, as well as the mediating effect of future orientation and the urban-rural differences in this mediating effect. Materials and Methods: Junior high-school students from three schools in Nanjing, China, were recruited to participate in a correlational survey. A total of 1381 participants aged 12\u201316 years completed the Internet use questionnaire, the future orientation scale, and reported their scores on the most recent grade unified examination. Results: The analysis results revealed that, after controlling for the variables of grade and gender, (1) the Internet use significantly and positively predicted academic achievement; (2) The future orientation significantly mediated the relation between Internet use and academic achievement; (3) and the effect of Internet use on future orientation was moderated by urban and rural areas. The effect of Internet use in promoting future orientation was only significant among rural adolescents. Conclusion: The results contribute to a better understanding of how Internet use affects adolescents\u2019 academic achievement, revealing that Internet use is of particular significance in the development of rural adolescents.

This study, therefore, explored future orientation as a mediating variable to explore the relation between Internet use and adolescent academic achievement based on the theory of ecological technomicrosystem.12 Meanwhile, considering China\u2019s unique dual economic structure for urban and rural areas, this study also examined the differences in the mediation effect between urban and rural adolescents."

            "heading": "Future Orientation as a Mediator",
            "text": "Future orientation refers to an individual\u2019s mental process of thinking about and planning for the future.13 It does not focus on the realization of a specific short-term goal but rather examines how often individuals think about the future and whether they think about the future in a long-term perspective (cognitive dimension); whether the individual is able to plan and carry out the plan if a specific goal consciousness is formed (behavioral dimension); and whether the individual is optimistic about the future (emotional dimension).14 Previous studies have pointed out that adolescence is a transitional stage towards adulthood, and adolescents frequently think about their future and plan their lives during this stage of life.15\nThe developmental level of future orientation is influenced by an individual\u2019s living environment.16,17 According to ecological systems theory,18 the development background that affects one\u2019s future orientation can be divided into several nested environmental systems, including the microsystem, mesosystem, and exosystem. These environmental systems are believed to have independent and interactive effects on individual development.15,19 The microsystem refers to the family, school, and other environments that have the most direct impact on individual development. On this basis, Johnson and Puplampu further proposed the ecological techno-subsystem theory, which argues that the use of electronic media should be seen as a dimension of the family microsystem environment.12 This suggests that Internet use may have an impact on adolescents\u2019 future orientations.\nRelevant empirical studies and theoretical perspectives help construct the relation between Internet use and future orientation. First, Internet, with its rich information resources, has been an important tool to enrich adolescents\u2019 imagination and creativity.20 Second, in the past, adolescents mainly looked to their parents and other important people in their daily life as role models when looking forward to the future.21 At present, however, the popularity of the Internet has enabled easy exposure to more diverse and richer professional images and character experiences beyond the real-life environment. Bandura\u2019s learning theory points out that adolescents can acquire knowledge and social information from electronic media, which is then encoded and stored in memory to guide their behavior and motivation in daily life.22 For example, when adolescents see or hear stories about people of good character through electronic media, they are prone to imitate them in daily life.22 This indicates that the rich information resources on the Internet may become important guides for adolescents in looking forward to the future and setting goals, which means Internet use may promote the development of future orientation.\nFuture orientation has been an important predictor of adolescent academic achievement,23,24 because individuals with a high level of future orientation can look to the future from a long-term perspective and combine current learning with personal future, thus improving academic achievement by, for example, delaying gratification, self-regulation, or adopting processing strategies on learning material.25,26 The present study therefore hypothesizes that Internet use promotes the development of future orientation, which further promotes adolescents\u2019 academic achievement (H1)."

According to some survey results, the penetration rate of the Internet among adolescents in rural areas of China has reached 90.3%,31 which means that adolescents in rural areas have equal access to the Internet as adolescents in urban areas. However, the ecological techno-microsystem theory suggests that the characteristics of the family environment influence the effect of electronic media on individual development.12,32 For rural adolescents, the use of the Internet not only compensates rural adolescents for the lack of cultural information resources resulting from their rural living environment but also helps broaden their horizons by providing diverse life role models. Whether Internet use especially plays an important role in the future orientation development of rural adolescents needs to be verified and discussed. The present study therefore presumes that Internet use may be a stronger contributor to the future orientation of rural adolescents than it is to urban adolescents and, consequently, to their academic achievement (H2)."

Bandura pointed out that powerful and charismatic figures in electronic media easily become target role models for children.22 Chen, Li, and Huang also found that\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S343199 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 2444\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nproviding students from poor families with a model of striving for goals can significantly improve their personal goal level.43 These studies suggest that the abundant information resources on the Internet, especially information related to role models, may provide opportunities and materials for the development of adolescents\u2019 future orientation.\nThe online environment also provides the conditions for adolescents to rid themselves of the shackles of the physical world and express or explore themselves freely.44 Adolescents can experience different images of themselves through roleplaying in online games.45 These self-exploration experiments may also help adolescents establish goals and therefore improve their future orientation. Future orientation has always been an important predictor of adolescent academic achievement,24,46 and it plays a mediating role in the relation between Internet use and academic achievement."

            "text": "The results also indicate that the moderating effect of urban-rural areas in the relation between Internet use and future orientation is significant, which appears in the fact that the contribution of Internet use to future orientation is significant only among rural adolescents. According to the ecological techno-microsystem theory, the effectiveness of electronic media is moderated by individual characteristics and the family environment.12,32 Numerous empirical studies have affirmed the moderating role of individual characteristics and reported electronic media to be more helpful for introverted individuals, individuals who are not well socialized (eg, who experience social anxiety) or individuals with poor reading skills.9,47,48 In contrast, there are few study findings on the impact of electronic media that is moderated by family and other environments.49 The findings of the present study, however, reveal the compensatory effects of Internet use on the development of rural adolescents.\nThe results of independent-sample t-test revealed that the development level of future orientation of rural adolescents was significantly lower than that of urban adolescents, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies.50,51 Due to the slow pace of economic development and the relatively closed information environment in rural areas of China, adolescents have few sources of information and role models with which to set up their future goals. According to Wang and Ma, adolescents in low social classes of China are faced with the dilemma of having low life goals.50 Morimitsu has reported that adolescents in lower social class may be subject to career ceilings in regard to setting their goals for the future, given the lack of diverse, high-level career role models in their living environment.51 In such a context, the wealth of information resources and the diversity of role models to which they are exposed to the Internet compensate for the development of future orientation among adolescents in the rural area.\nA few researchers have found that providing laptop computers to rural children was an effective way to improve educational outcomes and narrow the education gaps between urban and rural areas.52 However, there were few discussions as to why Internet use enhances the educational outcomes of rural adolescents. The present study results suggest that Internet use enhances rural adolescents\u2019 level of future orientation, which in turn positively contributes to academic achievement."

            "heading": "Limitations of the Study",
            "text": "This study has the following limitations. First, the study collected survey data through the method of a self-report, which may lead to common method bias. Although the analysis results suggested that this did not form a serious problem, future studies should endeavor to collect data from various sources, such as parents and teachers, to gain a deeper, more accurate understanding of the relations among variables.\nSecond, this study did not distinguish specific online activities when exploring the impact of Internet use on future orientation. Previous studies have shown that inappropriate Internet use (eg, overindulgence in online entertainment activities) is negatively correlated with adolescents\u2019 academic achievement.53 As a result, the positive relation between Internet use and academic achievement found in this study may be attributed to stringent school and family control and supervision of adolescents\u2019 Internet use in primary and secondary school. Future studies need to distinguish the relation between different online activities and academic achievement.\nFinally, this study had a cross-sectional design and cannot make causal inferences about the relation between these variables; hence, experimental studies could be conducted in the future to examine the relations between these variables.\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S343199 DovePress 2445\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

            "text": "This study found that Internet use not only contributes directly to adolescents\u2019 academic achievement but also promotes the development of adolescents\u2019 future orientation, which in turn can improve their academic achievement. Moreover, the effect of Internet use on future orientation was moderated by urban and rural areas. The effect of Internet use in promoting future orientation was only significant among rural adolescents. Based on the findings of this study, parents and teachers should encourage adolescents, particularly those in rural areas, to actively use Internet information resources to construct future goals and improve academic achievement."
