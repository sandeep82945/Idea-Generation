Published by BMJ.\nINTRODUCTION Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease commonly involving the peripheral joints and is associated with skin and nail psoriasis, enthesitis, dactylitis and, like with psoriasis, a reduced health- related quality of life and physical disability.1 The disease can also affect the axial joints in the spine and the sacroiliac joints (SIJ), which then occasionally is referred to as axial PsA (axPsA). Depending on the description axial involvement is reported in 25%\u201370% of the patients with PsA.2 The wide variability is a direct cause of the ongoing debate how to define axial involvement in PsA. With the lack of explicit definitions for axial involvement or criteria specifically for axPsA the classification of axPsA is subject to many interpretations. Back pain that worsens in rest or improves with exercise and morning stiffness (lasting longer than 30 min) are symptoms considered typical for axPsA.3 These features play a major role in defining inflammatory back pain (IBP). Other studies focus on radiographic damage when quantifying axial involvement in PsA. Some investigators focus on the presence of syndesmophytes or other indications for spinal damage such as sclerosis or erosions,4 while others describe axPsA as unilateral or bilateral sacroiliitis using either the modified New York criteria (mNY)3 5 or Assessment of\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC \u21d2 There is no consensus on the definition of axial psoriatic arthritis (axPsA); some report it as a form of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with the presentation of psoriasis.

A pilot study reported spinal radiographic progression at a rather slow rate of 0.6 modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) units per year.8 However, this study was conducted in only 22 patients and results from larger studies are needed.\nIn the current study, we aim to correlate several definitions of axial involvement to the development of syndesmophytes over 2 years in patients diagnosed with PsA.\nMETHODS Study design and data collection This study included patients enrolled in the Belgian Epidemiological Psoriatic Arthritis Study (BEPAS).9 Details on the purpose and design of the study have been published before. In short, BEPAS is a national, multicentre, non- interventional, epidemiological trial. Between December 2012 and July 2014, patients age \u226518 years with a clinical PsA diagnosis also fulfilling the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis were enrolled from 17 academic, non- academic and private practice centres across Belgium. The selection procedure was unbiased and systematic as weekly the first, third and fifth eligible PsA patient presenting at the different sites were asked to participate in the study.\nPatients/public were not involved in the creation of the design nor methodology of this particular study."

A less stringent definition is the \u2018physician detailed assessment\u2019, which contained the treating physician\u2019s evaluation of the following features on past or present occurrence: (1) spinal pain, (2) night pain, (3) morning stiffness, (4) anterior chest wall pain, (5) alternating buttock pain, (6) improvement of pain with exercise and (7) back pain onset <45 years. If any of the features was present, it was considered \u2018axial involvement\u2019, unless feature 7 (back pain onset <45 years) was solely present, then this was not\nconsidered \u2018axial involvement\u2019. \u2018Chronic back pain\u2019 (CBP) was defined by the treating physician and IBP was defined according to the ASAS definition.10 Clinical definitions were expanded by adding a C reactive protein (CRP) of \u226510 mg/L (elevated) to \u2018CBP\u2019 and \u2018IBP\u2019.\nWith only radiographs available in this study, the radiographic axial involvement was purely focused on fulfilment of mNY criteria.

Two calibrated central readers (AI and MdH) performed two training sets and one calibration round with recurring evaluation meetings in between, resulting in substantial interreader agreement (kappa>0.70). This process was conducted separately for SIJ and spine. After calibration the imaging assessment used for the current study started. Each reader evaluated spinal radiographs separately from the pelvic radiographs. Readers were blinded for time sequence, origin of the cohort, clinical data and information from other obtained images (radiographs of hands and feet).\nPelvic radiographs were scored according to the mNY criteria. With this method SIJ are assessed on anteroposterior view plain radiographs. Radiographic changes of each SIJ are graded on a 0\u20134 scale. The mNY criteria are fulfilled in case of a bilateral grade 2 or unilateral grade 3 or 4 score (mNY+).11 Spinal radiographs were assessed using the mSASSS. With this method, the anterior vertebral corners (VCs) of the cervical (lower border of C2 to upper border of T1) and lumbar (lower border of T12 to upper border of S1) spine (total of 24 VCs) are scored in the lateral view as 0 if VC was normal, 1 when erosion, sclerosis and/or squaring was present in absence of syndesmophyte, 2 if a non- bridging syndesmophyte was present and 3 with the presence of bridging syndesmophytes.

            "text": "In this study, the associations between different definitions of axial involvement and the development of radiographic syndesmophytes in patients with PsA are tested. In this unselected PsA population with a large percentage of physician- reported axial complaints, syndesmophyte progression is overall low. We found that despite the minimal amount of radiographic spinal damage the probability of radiographic spinal progression over 2 years increases 3\u201314 times in PsA patient with radiographic axial involvement defined as radiographic sacroiliitis according to the mNY criteria.\nThe discussion on axial involvement in PsA is ongoing and will be left without conclusive statements until a universally accepted definition for \u2018axial involvement\u2019 is found. There are numerous descriptions for axial involvement and due to this the prevalence of patients with axPsA varies tremendously in the literature. By using an extensive variety of definitions we aimed to contribute to the insights of what axial involvement in PsA is and we aimed to find possible associations with radiographic spinal progression. In this study, we interpreted axial involvement with a clinical as well as radiographic approach. The physician drove the clinical definitions of axial involvement. It is suggested that with regard to pain assessment as an outcome measure the physicians opinion is preferred over patient assessment as most patients (>85%) rate their global pain assessment higher than their physician.13 Nevertheless, it remains a prejudiced evaluation, which is subject to large fluctuations. By including an elevated CRP, the definition contains an objective component,\nof which we hypothesised that \u2018axial involvement\u2019 takes on a more distinctive character. Our results concur that indeed. The probability of spinal radiographic progression intensified for both clinical and radiographic axial involvement when combined with high CRP. Only with CBP as an indication for axial involvement this intensification was not so pronounced. In this study, the physician reported CBP in over two- thirds of the patients. Argument could be made that CBP in general is not sufficiently specific to serve as a proxy for axial involvement. The probability of developing syndesmophytes over 2 years increased seven times when axial involvement was considered as \u2018IBP with elevated CRP\u2019. Yet, the OR of 13.8 was not statistically significant, which presumably could be a power problem.\nIn this population with moderate long disease duration, approximately 10% of the patients develop new syndesmophytes over 2 years, most of them developed just one new syndesmophyte. In a study on spinal progression in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) patients an average rate of 1.8 mSASSS was reported in the first 2 years of follow- up. The absolute rate is slightly higher than the 1.1 mSASSS units this study reports. Nevertheless this could be expected as the OASIS cohort included radiographic axSpA patients with longer symptom duration. Therefore, comparing these data, we see similar radiographic spinal progression in PsA as in r- axSpA patients.14\nDue to the low radiographic progression, the associations found in this study were not statistically significant. Still the descriptive data, especially presented in the conditional probability tables, show that the development of a syndesmophyte was three times more likely when the patient also presented with radiographic sacroiliac involvement (fulfilling mNY criteria) at baseline. When on top of that also a high CRP was established in these patients the probability of new syndesmophytes was 14 times higher. Note should be made that there was only one patient that fulfilled this condition (mNY+ and elevated CRP), which shows the scarceness of axial radiographic damage in this cohort. These results suggest that radiographic sacroiliitis is a robust description of axial involvement, especially when combined with an objective inflammatory factor such as CRP. Based on our results, we suggest that in the absence of radiographic imaging, IBP in combination with CRP probably serve as the best proxy for axial involvement in PsA.\nAt time of developing, the BEPAS protocol (before 2012) MRI was not a standardised procedure in daily clinical practice for patients with PsA. The lack of MRI data in this study leaves a gap in the range of definitions of axial involvement. With MRI a preradiographic stage of axial damage can be detected by assessing inflammatory lesions and structural lesions such as fat deposition. This could be a key component in future\u2019s globally accepted nomenclature of axial involvement. A future study was recently announced to explicitly address this current breach in axPsA research.7 In addition to the inability to detect transient lesions, the radiographic imaging assessment used in this study also holds the possibility of missing spinal damage in the form of erosions or ankylosis located in the facet joints. In this study, mSASSS was used to evaluate spinal damage, as per suggestion of the ASAS group on core outcome set instruments selection.15 The mSASSS method does not take into account facet joints. Not embracing the facet joints is a major limitation of any validated scoring method assessing radiographic spinal damage.16 In this particular study, it may result in underestimating radiographic spinal damage. On the other hand, the scoring of facet joints is a very complicated endeavour, as a validated and widely used\nTable 3 Association of axial involvement according to various definitions and developing syndesmophytes in 2 years in patients with PsA from the BEPAS cohort (n=150)\nAxial involvement definitions OR 95% CI\nClinical Physician global assessment 1.37 0.40 to 4.69\nPhysician detailed assessment 1.41 0.29 to 6.88\nCBP (according to physician) 0.83 0.23 to 2.98\nCBP and CRP\u226510 2.55 0.49 to 13.27\nIBP (according to ASAS) 1.12 0.23 to 5.53\nIBP and CRP\u226510 13.80 0.80 to 237.41\nRadiographic mNY consensus 3.38 0.34 to 33.11\nmNY consensus and CRP\u226510 NA \u2013\nASAS, Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society; BEPAS, Belgian Epidemiological Psoriatic Arthritis Study; CBP, chronic back pain; CRP, C reactive protein; IBP, inflammatory back pain; mNY, modified New York; NA, not assessed; PsA, psoriatic arthritis.\nP atna).

Also the absence of HLA- 27 typing in most patients is a limitation to this study. Unfortunately at time of developing, the BEPAS protocol (before 2012) HLAB27 was not a standardised feature in daily practice nor covered by healthcare. In hindsight, the study would have definitely benefited from adding HLA- B27 typing but at the time the decision was reasonable.\nThe systematic approach of having two independent readers blindly assessing all pelvic radiographs separately from the spinal radiographs is a major strength of this study. In addition, readers showed excellent agreement, which is assuring for the robustness of the data even though the statistical analyses were preformed on vertebral unit (VU) level and adjusted for reader assessment. Another strength is the selection of patients for the BEPAS. Selection bias was kept to a minimum due to the inclusion procedure: every week the first, third and fifth eligible PsA patient presenting at the different sites was asked to participate in the study. Using this method, an unbiased systematic selection of patients was obtained.\nSummarising, this study shows a rarity of syndesmophyte formation over 2 years in patients with PsA, in particular without baseline radiographic sacroiliitis. Though rare, radiographic syndesmophyte development is more likely in PsA patients with radiographic sacroiliac involvement at baseline, particularly in combination with elevated CRP, compared with a purely clinical description of axial involvement.
