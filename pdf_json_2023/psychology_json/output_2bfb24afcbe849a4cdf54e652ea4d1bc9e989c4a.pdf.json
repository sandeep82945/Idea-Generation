            "text": "The Knoevenagel condensation1 is an important carbon\u2013carbon bond-forming reaction. The reaction comprises the condensation between an aldehyde or a ketone with active hydrogen compounds to yield a,b-unsaturated compounds.2,3 The mechanism involves two steps: (i) an aldol addition of an active hydrogen compound to an aldehyde or carbonyl compound and (ii) 1,2-elimination of water or dehydration.4\u20136 Usually, the Knoevenagel reaction is conducted in solution under homogeneous conditions using weak bases which react with an aldehyde to form the b-hydroxy intermediate.5,7 Protic and aprotic polar solvents, such as EtOH and DMF, favour the kinetics for the first step in the mechanism and aprotic solvents accelerate the reaction in the second step. The intermediate is further converted into the final a,b-unsaturated olefin, after the elimination of water.8\nIn response to the urgent need for environmentally friendly synthetic processes, alternative methods using minimal amounts\nof bulk catalysts and solvents are under exploration.9 In this context, several modifications of the traditional Knoevenagel reaction have been developed in recent years including the use of heterogenous catalysts (alkali-earth or modified silica),10 water as catalyst and solvent,11,12 and catalyst-free environments using ethanol/water as reaction media.13 For solution-based conditions, the solvent and catalyst greatly affect the kinetics of the reaction, whereas the solid-state reaction profile is influenced by parameters such as the amount of solvent and the mechanical force used.14\u201319\nKaupp20 and Suzuki21 have shown that an efficient and quantitative Knoevenagel condensation can be achieved in the solid state. In their study, Kaupp et al. documented the first Knoevenagel condensation between 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and malononitrile using a ball mill. They achieved a significant reduction in catalyst concentration compared to the traditional solution-based method.20 These discoveries have led to further studies of solvent-free Knoevenagel condensation reactions, including 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-NBA) and malononitrile (MN).22\u201327 This reaction has been explored in planetary and vibrational ball mills under catalyst-free conditions and in the presence or absence of solvents, showing complete conversions to the 2-(4-nitrobenzylidone)malononitrile (2-NMN) product.25,28\nHere, we investigate how solvents of different polarities affect the kinetics and mechanism of the Knoevenagel reaction between 4-NBA and MN using mechanochemical techniques (Fig. 1).

            "text": "The Knoevenagel reaction between 4-NBA and MN (Fig. 1) was conducted using a vertical vibrational ball mill. The reactants were milled for 60 minutes at 40 Hz, under two specific conditions: (1) LAG (60 mL, Z = 0.1 mL mg 1; Z = V (liquid; mL) m 1\n(reagents; mg))29 of solvent with different polarities \u2013 octane, ethanol (EtOH) and dimethylformamide (DMF); and (2) absence of solvent (NG). The reaction was investigated by time-resolved in situ (TRIS) Raman spectroscopy in tandem with synchrotron PXRD. For reactions under LAG conditions when using high polarity solvents (EtOH and DMF) the Raman data (Fig. 2, top) show that, the reaction progresses towards the formation of the product 2-NMN (high intensity CRN stretching band at 2232 cm 1). This stretching band appears at lower frequency than the MN CRN stretch band (2267 cm 1) due to the high p-electrons conjugation between the new CQC bond and the CRN group. In addition, the reaction intermediate 2-H-NMN is also detected in very small amounts via the presence of a low intensity CRN stretching band at 2260 cm 1.\nUnder NG conditions and LAG with non-polar solvents (octane), the formation of the intermediate 2-H-NMN is detected in a higher amount, as observed by the presence of an intense CRN stretching band at 2260 cm 1 (Fig. 2, bottom). As the reaction progresses, the main stretching bands of the intermediate and starting materials (CRN and CQO stretching bands) decrease in intensity. Consequently, the emergence of the product 2-NMN becomes increasingly evident. New CQC and CRN stretching bands appear at 1580 cm 1 and 2232 cm 1, albeit with low intensities and coexisting with the CRN stretching band of the intermediate.\nTrapping the Knoevenagel intermediate 2-H-NMN \u2013 structure determination\nIdentification of intermediates in mechanochemical bond forming reactions has occasionally been reported previously.30,31\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of the Knoevenagel reaction between 4- NBA and MN, highlighting the intermediate 2-H-NMN (in orange) and the resulting product, 2-NMN (in red).\nFig. 2 In situ Raman data of the Knoevenagel ball milling reaction between 4-NBA and MN (starting materials) under neat grinding and LAG conditions using octane, EtOH and DMF.

Chem. Chem. Phys., 2023, 25, 23637\u201323644 | 23639\nHere, the intermediate 2-H-NMN was detected during NG and LAG (octane) at 40 Hz, but only in combination with 2-NMN. Therefore, an optimization of the reaction conditions to isolate 2-H-NMN, in pure form, was performed. We investigated an ex situ NG experiment in very mild conditions, using a lower frequency (15 Hz) milling for a period of 60 minutes. The PXRD data presented in Fig. 3a demonstrates the almost pure crystalline phase of the intermediate. Only low intensity reflections of 4-NBA are still present. An additional inspection of both reactivity progress and stability of the intermediate, after stopping the milling process (Fig. 3a and b), show that the reaction continues slowly until complete consumption of the starting materials and formation of the product (4 days). The known melt-mediated reaction during ball milling of 4-NBA and MN may be responsible for this observation.23 Based on previous studies, after approximately 35 minutes of milling and at the same time that the reaction starts, MN melts and the milling jar temperature quickly increases to 35 1C, which is above the melting point of MN (32 1C).23,24 The mixture between molten MN and crystalline 4-NBA, together with the accumulated energy from the mechanical impact of the milling balls into the powder, may help in the reaction progress after stopping the milling process.\nThe powder pattern of 2-H-NMN obtained after 60 minutes of milling was unambiguously indexed as monoclinic unit cell, using both TOPAS32\u201334 and DICVOL35 in DASH.36 Using the Hoffmann\u2019s volume increments,37 the expected molecular volume was 232.03 \u00c53, corresponding to four molecules per unit cell (Z = 4) for a unit cell volume of 995.90 \u00c53 (Table 1). The structure was solved by the real-space method and refined using the Rietveld method.\nQuantitative phase analysis was performed using TOPAS,32\u201334 shown in Fig. 3c, which determined that the phase mixture contains 92.48% of intermediate and 7.52% of 4-NBA.\nThe crystal structure of the intermediate 2-H-NMN is presented in Fig. 4. The packing structure is based on an intermolecular OH O hydrogen bond interaction, dH O = 1.94(5) \u00c5, enabling the formation of a chain along b. This HB interaction is probably responsible for the stabilization of the intermediate, delaying the formation time of 2-NMN product. Furthermore, there is an extra HB interaction between the acidic hydrogen atom, directly connected to the malononitrile group, and the nitrogen atom of another malononitrile group (CH O, dH N = 2.47(6) \u00c5). These two HB interactions allow the interconnection between intermediate chains along c, forming a R33(19) synthon. An additional p p interaction, dp p = 3.748(5) \u00c5, supports the packing growing in all directions (Fig. 4).\nKinetic investigation of the Knoevenagel condensation\nFor a better understanding of the reaction progress using LAG or NG conditions, we analysed the time-dependent changes in the Raman spectra during the reaction course using the concentration in real time algorithm. A two-point background correction with normalization of the CRN stretching bands at 2232 cm 1 (MN) and 2260 cm 1 (2-H-NMN), and CQO stretching band at 1706 cm 1 (2-NMN) was used to generate the\nkinetic curves of the reactions presented in Fig. 5 (for more details, see the Experimental section).

For the reaction conducted with DMF, a small induction period of 3 min is observed, during which no product formation is detected. The induction period slightly increases to ca. 5 min when using EtOH as LAG solvent. These observations are supported by in situ PXRD data (Fig. 6a) and are also in accordance with what is expected in solution when using such solvents.13 The aprotic polar solvent DMF favours the reaction kinetics in both steps, while EtOH favours mostly the first step (aldol addition), giving rise to a slightly faster reaction kinetics in the presence of DMF.\nPerforming the reaction using octane and under NG conditions leads to the formation of the intermediate 2-H-MNM (Fig. 5b) in the amount of 78% and 60%, respectively, after 60 min of reaction. The intermediate 2-H-MNM and the product 2-MNM appear concomitantly after ca. 10 min of induction period. These results are also in accordance with the in situ PXRD data (Fig. 6b). Considering that non-polar solvents do not favour the 1,2-elimination step, it was expected that under LAG with octane and NG conditions, the intermediate would be formed. In both reaction conditions, the kinetic profile is similar, and the product formation is not completed during 60 min of milling.\nPrevious in situ PXRD and Raman study performed by Haferkamp and Kulla et al23,38 showed that the reaction between MN and 4-NBA using NG at 50 Hz during 60 min lead\nTable 1 Crystallographic details for 2-H-NMN\n2-H-NMN\nChemical formula C10H7N3O3 Formula weight/g mol 1 217.19 Crystal system Monoclinic Space group P21/c a/\u00c5 10.89048(15) b/\u00c5 9.54267(14) c/\u00c5 10.63046(15) b/1 115.6448(4) V/\u00c53 995.94(3) Z 4 Rp, a R0p . % 4.258, 11.326 Rwp, a R0wp . % 5.895, 12.277 Rexp, a R0exp . % 3.403, 7.087 RBragg 3.527 Gof 1.732\na Dashed values corresponds to values after background subtraction.\nFig. 4 Chain-like packing arrangement of 2-H-NMN evidencing the OH O and CH O HB, the p p interactions and the R33(19) synthon.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

However, it is known that milling frequencies can hugely influence the reaction kinetics.16,39,40 In our in situ studies, we have used a lower milling frequency of 40 Hz. This difference of 10 Hz appears to be sufficient to detect the formation of 2-H-NMN during the same reaction time (60 min).\nTo complement our in situ studies ex situ experiments were performed. We selected two reaction conditions as examples (LAG in EtOH and octane) and collected PXRD for every single reaction point using Rietveld refinements for quantification\n(Fig. S2 and S3, ESI\u2020). The kinetic profile of both reactions presented in Fig. 7 are similar to those obtained after in situ data collection (Fig. 5). Using EtOH, a complete conversion to the product 2-MNM is achieved after ca. 25 min whereas when using octane, the reaction is not complete. Residual staring material 4-NBA is still present (ca. 10%) after 60 min of reaction together with ca. 20% of the intermediate 2-H-NMN and ca. 70% of the product 2-MNM."

The experiments were carried out in a 1 mm capillary at a wavelength of 0.8266 \u00c5 and an energy of 14.998 keV using a liquid nitrogen cooled double crystal monochromator Si(111). Scattered intensities were collected with a linear X-ray detector (Mythen 1k; spot size 200 1000 mm; detector-sample-distance 875.208 mm).\nThe powder pattern was indexed using DICVOL35 in DASH,36 and TOPAS,32\u201334 excluding some peaks from the 4-NBA starting material impurity. Structure solution was achieved by the realspace method, using simulated annealing routine implemented in DASH.36 The starting model of 4-NBA was obtained from the cif file of CSD (Cambridge Structural Database) with the entry YAWCEG47 and modified by removing a double bond and adding two hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group. During simulated annealing no restrictions in the degrees of freedom were applied.\nRietveld refinement was carried out using TOPAS32\u201334 for the full 2y range. A Pawley fit was first performed in the following refinement steps: scale factor, background, atomic positions, and isotropic displacement parameters were refined.\nFor the structure refinement, two different isotropic displacement parameters were refined: one for the non-hydrogen (non H) atoms and one for the hydrogen atoms, Biso(H) = 1.2 Biso(non H). Restraints were applied for all bond lengths, angles, and planar rings/groups. Data collection and structure refinement details are summarized in Table 1. All information about hydrogen bonding distances and angles, obtained using PLATON,41 are presented in Table 2.\nA quantitative phase analysis was performed to determine the percentage of 4-NBA and 2-H-MNM present (Fig. 3c and Table 1). The structure cif file (CSD entry KAYSUY) was used in the respective Rietveld refinement.\nIn situ experiments\nThe in situ synchrotron XRD investigations were performed at the mSpot beamline (BESSY II, Helmholtz Centre Berlin for Materials and Energy) using a vertical ball mill (Pulverisette, Fritsch, Germany) and a Perspex grinding jar containing 2 balls (10 mm, 4 g) at 40 Hz for 60 min. The experiments were carried out at a wavelength of 0.8266 \u00c5 and an energy of 17 keV using a double crystal monochromator Si(111). Scattered intensities were collected with a two-dimensional X-ray detector (Eiger9M,\nCCD 3072 3072). The exposure time was 15 s. The images were processed with DPDAK 1.4.1 followed by a background correction with a Python 3.7.1 script using Spyder from Anaconda.49 For a better comparison with the ex situ PXRD data, the q values were transformed into the diffraction angle 2y (Cu Ka1).\nThe in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Raman RXN1TM analyser (Kaiser Optical Systems, Lyon, France). A contactless probe with a working distance of 6 cm and a spot size of 1 mm was used. The excitation wavelength of the laser was 785 nm. Raman spectra were recorded with iC Raman V.4.1.915 (Mettler Toledo) at an acquisition time of 5 s and 5 accumulations with a new spectrum every 30 s. The subtraction of jar contribution, baseline correction, and normalization were carried out with a script designed for basic analysis and visualization of in situ Raman monitoring data.42 Acquired spectra were processed a curve-resolution algorithms having the capability to group wavenumber values that change absorbance intensity in the same manner (ConcIRT module, implemented in the iC Raman software).43,44 For each group, the algorithm calculates the associated component spectrum and relative concentration profile. As each new reaction spectrum is acquired, all the reaction spectra are re-analysed and the individual component spectra and profiles are updated. In this way, the calculation results evolve as the reaction progresses and additional components such as intermediates are detected.\nRelative concentration profiles were calculated for products, intermediates and starting materials from single Raman bands after a two-point (start and end of the vibration band) background correction."
