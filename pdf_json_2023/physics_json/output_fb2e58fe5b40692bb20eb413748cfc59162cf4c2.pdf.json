    "abstractText": "There is a lack of methods to predict the isothermal crystallization behavior of amorphous freeze-dried formulations stored below the glass transition temperature. This study applies isothermal microcalorimetry to predict long-term crystallization during product storage time. The relaxation curve of a fresh sample recorded within 12 h after lyophilization is correlated with the long-term crystallization time at the same temperature. Storage conditions of 25 \u25e6C and 40 \u25e6C are examined and five model formulations containing either sucrose or trehalose with different concentrations of an IgG1 antibody are investigated. The amorphous formulations were created by different freeze-drying processes only differing in their freezing step (random nucleation; additional annealing step of 1.5 h and 3 h, controlled nucleation; quench cooling). Samples that crystallized during the study time of 12 months showed a promising correlation between their relaxation time and crystallization behavior upon storage. Furthermore, the study shows that polysorbate 20 strongly accelerates crystallization of sucrose and that the freezing step itself has a strong impact on the relaxation phenomena that is not levelled out by primary and secondary drying.",

            "text": "The amount of biological therapeutics has strongly increased in recent years [1]. Those entities face degradation problems during shipment and long-term storage when kept in their liquid formulation [2]. Thus, freeze- or spray-drying can be used to achieve long-term stability of these products upon removal of water [3,4]. To successfully freeze-dry those materials, sugars, such as sucrose or trehalose, are used as bulking agents and lyoprotectants [5]. Those excipients are able to protect and sustain the structure of biotherapeutics, including antibodies [6]. In particular, sugars can mimic water with their hydroxyl groups, thereby supporting the native conformation of the antibody upon lyophilization based on the water replacement theory [7,8]. To fulfil this stabilizing effect, the sugar has to stay amorphous during the storage time of the product [9,10]. However, during storage, crystallization of sugars can occur, even if the storage temperature is significantly below the glass transition temperature (Tg) [11]. Therefore, it is important to avoid crystallization of the excipients during the life time of the pharmaceutical formulation [12]. Consequently, methods that predict crystallization in the early stage of development are needed to discover formulations and process conditions that are prone to result in crystallization upon storage, which frequently lasts up to 2 years or more [11,13,14]. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is one method to estimate the crystallization tendency of a formulation [15]. With this method, the Tg and its onset as well as the energy of crystallization above Tg can be determined [16]. Of course, the onset of crystallization measured above Tg can be used as a surrogate for isothermal crystallization tendencies, but\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 703. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15020703 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 703 2 of 19\ndominant reactions at high temperatures, especially above Tg, are not always the leading reactions at lower temperatures below Tg [17]. Particularly in glasses where Arrhenius kinetics cannot be applied, this could lead to incorrect predictions [18]. Another method is X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), where an X-ray diffractogram of the freeze-dried product is recorded. An absence of clear reflection peaks is proof for a fully amorphous sample, as an ordered structure, such as a crystal, is necessary to diffract the beam in a well-defined angle [19]. This method is the standard approach to monitor the recent status of a sample, but has no predictive potential [20\u201323]. Below Tg, structural relaxation phenomena are successfully used as general stability predicting factors for amorphous formulations [24,25]. One possibility to quantify relaxation processes is isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) [26]. Here, \u03b1-relaxations can be estimated from a measured curve decay of a freshly prepared glass within a few days [27]. The curve shape can be fitted with equation 1 (see below) and expressed as the relaxation time \u03c4\u03b2 [h]. The higher the energy excess is, the smaller the relaxation time \u03c4\u03b2 [h] will be and the more degradation reactions, including crystallization, can happen [25]. Thus, the theory is to create amorphous formulations with as little energy excess as possible, which results in a high value of \u03c4\u03b2. A detailed explanation and derivation of \u03c4\u03b2 can be found elsewhere [25,28]. It should be pointed out that relaxation measurements are only suitable for process optimization with the same formulation. The excipients have a strong impact on product behavior, affecting multiple properties, and thus cannot be captured by \u03b1-relaxation measurements alone [28]. In earlier crystallization studies considering \u03b1-relaxations, single-component systems with either sucrose as the excipient [18,24] or non-protein active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), such as nifedipine [18,29], were utilized. Furthermore, most of the studies attempt to predict the onset of crystallization at the temperature of interest with relaxation measurements at other temperatures. In this study, in a first step, protein-free multi-component placebo formulations created by freeze-drying are investigated to verify that the prediction of crystallization in mixed formulations is possible at all. In a second step, an IgG1 antibody as API is added to the formulations. In both concepts, the systems were studied with IMC and after long-term storage. In addition, a second question is targeted by this study. Most of the changes in the relaxation behavior of amorphous samples are explained with their different thermal history compared to a reference sample [30\u201332]. To investigate this, if the freezing step of a lyophilization process has an impact on the relaxation behavior of the final product, different freeze-drying protocols that only differ in their freezing step are applied (random nucleation; additional annealing step of 1.5 h and 3 h, controlled nucleation; quench cooling). Although the freezing step itself could be considered a thermal treatment, as the amorphous phase is shielded by the frozen water and no drying process is happening, it is possible that these effects are levelled off later by the thermal history introduced by primary and secondary drying. Five different formulations are used to investigate if and how the prediction of isothermal crystallization is possible. Three formulations with a low antibody content of 2 mg/mL with different polysorbate 20 (PS20) concentrations ranging from 0\u20131.6 mg/mL, a formulation with a high antibody content of 50 mg/mL, and a formulation containing trehalose are studied. The different amounts of PS20 in the first three samples are considered to accelerate crystallization despite a low residual moisture content [33]. A high protein concentration of 50 mg/mL is used to investigate if the model is applicable for more challenging protein/sugar ratios and trehalose is utilized as another sugar with a higher Tg compared to sucrose."

For all other samples that would block the IMC instrument too long, weekly DSC measurements of sample aliquots were performed. The changes in the crystallization peak above Tg (onset and enthalpy) were tracked and compared with the measurements performed the weeks before. The onset temperature of this peak was recorded and plotted. The reduction of the onset temperature above Tg also indicates an ongoing crystallization at the storage temperature of 25 \u00b0C below Tg.\n3. Results 3.1.

            "text": "All freeze-drying processes with the different freezing steps resulted in acceptable dry products. Results from product temperature monitoring can be found in Appendix B. The microscopic and macroscopic appearance, as well as the SSA, indicated that the freezing steps resulted in products with different morphology, as desired. It was expected for the controlled nucleation (CN) samples to have the largest pores (Figure 2), but lower overall surface area [36,37]. During drying, bigger pores remain, which lead to faster primary drying, but to less effective secondary drying as the SSA is relatively low [38,39]. In the QN process, on the other hand, plenty of very small ice nuclei arise [40]. Thus, the QN process leads to very small pores and an overall high SSA (Table 5). The RN process can be considered as in-between and ends up with an intermediate SSA. The AN1.5 and AN3.0 processes increase the time for ice nuclei to grow but this trend was not observed in our samples [41,42]. The reason might be that the annealing conditions of \u221220 \u25e6C with a time of only 1.5 or 3.0 h were too short and not high enough in temperature to allow stronger effects. Recent trends in the community are suggesting more \u201caggressive\u201d annealing conditions close to the eutectic temperature at \u22124 \u25e6C over more than 5 h [43], but were not yet applied in our study. The trends seen for the structure of the cakes are clearly connected with the residual moisture content of the samples. After primary drying, about 10\u201315% bound water remains in the amorphous phase of the formulation, which is then removed in secondary drying [44,45]. Here, formulations with a higher SSA will dry much faster. Therefore, applying the same secondary drying conditions leads to a higher residual moisture level in the CN samples compared to the QN samples. The differences in residual moisture impact \u03b1-relaxations [31] as well as crystallization [46]. When searching for a\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 703 9 of 19\ncorrelation of \u03b1-relaxation with crystallization, differences in residual moisture should not matter as both effects should be equally influenced if a correlation exists. However, to answer the question what impact the freezing step has on \u03b1-relaxations is a challenge. Water, as a plasticizer, strongly affects the Tg [31] of the freeze-dried cake and, with this, also \u03b1\u2013relaxations. For this reason, it is not possible, without further intervention, to separate the effects of the freezing step and residual moisture. Thus, the changes in measured \u03b1-relaxations could emerge from the changes in residual moisture alone. To overcome this challenge, two approaches can be applied. The secondary drying for samples with a lower SSA could be prolonged or an equalizing procedure by moisture adaption (as described by Lo Presti & Frie\u00df) could be applied [35]. The first option would change the thermal history and can therefore not be utilized. The second option is too time-consuming to be applied for an entire 12-month stability study sample set. Therefore, a pre-test study was performed on the 1.6PS_Suc placebo formulation without protein, considered as a sample with a high and fast crystallization tendency. This approach shall give insight whether the correlation of \u03b1-relaxation with crystallization is possible."

            "text": "Figure 5 shows the result of this pre-test. A similar approach had already been published but had not been evaluated concerning the crystallization tendency [28]. The residual moisture of the samples is around 1.3 \u00b1 0.2% after moisture equalization and is considered as equal [28,31]. It can be seen in Figure 5 that the freezing step has a clear influence on the relaxation, with CN having the shortest relaxation time and QN the longest. RN and AN1.5 are in between. The annealing time of 1.5 h at \u221220 \u25e6C was not long enough to introduce stronger effects. Thus, in the following main study, an annealing step of 3.0 h was added. Nevertheless, the crystallization of the samples occurs qualitatively exactly in the order of the relaxation times, with CN being the first sample to crystallize, followed by AN1.5, RN, and with QN being the last. A reasonable linear correlation between relaxation times and onset of crystallization with r2 = 0.88 can be found. Moreover, it is remarkable that the relaxation curve of CN samples shows a different shape than the other curves. In the beginning, besides the expected crystallization peak, a second exothermal peak maximum is obtained at 0.58 h followed by an endothermal valley lasting from 2\u20135 days of measurement. A similar observation was made for foam-dried [30] samples as well as for tempered and CN samples [28]. The use of controlled ice nucleation seems to introduce similar effects in the lyophilized matrix as a tempering procedure or the heat applied during foam drying.

Protein-Containing Samples Equalized for Residual Moisture Based on the data in Section 4.1, the residual moisture was only adapted for a small group of samples to see if a correlation between relaxation and crystallization also exists in protein-containing matrices. The moisture adapted samples are 2.0 mg/mL_1.6PS_Suc processed by freeze-drying with RN, CN, and QN. Table 4 shows the residual moisture data of these samples before and after adaption.\nWith protein formulations, a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.92 can be obtained by a linear fit of relaxation with crystallization time. With moisture adaption, the correlation coefficient increased to a value of r2 = 0.96 (Figure 6). We are aware of the fact that a linear correlation with three data points is statistically not robust. However, the pre-tests with placebo and protein-containing samples with moisture adaption were performed to generate a first insight into the relation of relaxation, crystallization, freezing step, and residual moisture (Figure 7). For this purpose, a limited number of samples was sufficient and justified to set up a bigger study with more processes and formulations. Before we delve into the findings of the main study, we want to summarize what has been found so far:  The freezing step influences the residual moisture directly by determining the pore\nsize of the formulation [36,37]. Furthermore, the freezing step influences \u03b1-relaxation directly by changes in the amorphous phase as well as indirectly by the residual moisture. Both effects are independent from each other.  The residual moisture influences the \u03b1-relaxation and crystallization directly by plastization of the solid phase [31]. The effect on \u03b1-relaxation and crystallization is proportional.  \u03b1-relaxation and crystallization below Tg correlate not only in single-component but also in multi-component systems. The addition of 2 mg/mL of protein changes the crystallization behavior of the product (Figures 5 and 6), but the correlation of \u03b1relaxation and crystallization remains.\nFigure 5.

Last, the influence of the sugar itself on \u03c4\u03b2 and the Tg by comparing the 2gl_0.4_Suc with 2gl_0.4PS_Tre can be obtained. During the investigation period of 12 months, the 2 mg/mL_1.6PS_Suc samples crystallized isothermally at 25 \u25e6C and 40 \u25e6C, respectively. The 2 mg/mL_0.4PS_Suc formulation from the CN process crystallized at 40 \u25e6C, but not at 25 \u25e6C. All other process/formulation combinations led to samples that stayed amorphous (Table 7).\nFrom these observations we conclude the following. First, PS20 accelerates crystallization of sucrose. All samples with 2 mg/mL protein and 1.6 mg/mL PS20 crystallized. The only sample with a PS20 concentration below 1.6 mg/mL that crystallized was the 2 mg/mL_0.4PS_Suc formulation from the CN process at 40 \u25e6C storage. Here, the significantly higher residual moisture resulting from the CN process was the reason (Table 3). In contrast, the corresponding sample without PS20 was still amorphous. The mechanism behind the acceleration of crystallization itself is not clear. Factors such as Tg, SSA, and residual moisture were ruled out as they are approximately the same within all the respective samples. The PS20 concentrations of 0.4 mg/mL and 1.6 mg/mL are both far above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PS20 [47\u201349]. It is possible that micelles of PS20 could act as crystallization nuclei for sucrose. More micelles present in the 1.6 mg/mL PS20 formulation could consequently lead to faster crystallization. Second, even small changes in excipient composition can change the physical properties of the matrix and some are not detectable with \u03b1-relaxation measurements. Concerning the relaxation time \u03c4\u03b2, the 2 mg/mL_0.0PS_Suc sample and the 2 mg/mL_1.6_PS_Suc sample are very similar (relaxation time of 1.03 h and 1.04 h, respectively), but evidently, they crystallize at different timepoints upon storage. Third, a high protein concentration prevents crystallization of the matrix. Whether proteins act as a \u201cbinding partner\u201d to PS20 and inhibit the crystallization accelerating effect of the surfactant or whether it is a result of the higher Tg (Table 6, approx. + 20 \u25e6C for 50 mg/mL compared to 2 mg/mL) cannot be answered. Figure 8 shows the correlation of \u03b1-relaxation and crystallization of the 2 mg/mL_1.6PS_Suc samples at 40 \u25e6C. In all formulations, except CN, the rise of the crystallization peak started very slowly, and two peaks are observed. The double peaks (maxima 29.0 d and 32.3 d for RN; 21.8 d and 25.9 d for AN1.5; 19.0 d and 21.2 d for AN3.0; 18.3 d and 20.8 d for QN) arise through the pooling of samples from different vials to reach the minimum amount of 150 mg for IMC measurement. There are certain differences of 2 to 5 days between single vials regarding crystallization time. It is assumed that such differences between samples always exist, but in this case, were carved out through the slow crystallization. The crystallization in Section 4.2 was fast and differences within the pooled samples were so small that they were not observed. In long-term stability studies with drawing times of 1 and 3 months, a crystallization time difference of 5 days would of course not be detectable.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 703 12 of 19Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 20\nFigure 8.

With r2 = 0.58, the quality of the fit is not as good as in the pre-test, but still indicates a strong correlation. The relaxation times \u03c4\u03b2 are very close to each other, ranging from approximately 1\u20135 h. Within the sample set of 2 mg/mL_1.6PS_Suc, this means a 1 h difference in relaxation time \u03c4\u03b2 corresponds to a shift of 601.35 h (25 days) in crystallization. Nevertheless, at least a qualitative correlation was found, which is very useful if samples from different processes shall be compared for maintaining their amorphous state during long-term storage. Taking the same samples at a 25 \u00b0C storage temperature into account, the order of sample crystallization changed (Figure 9).\nFigure 9.

In contrast, at 25 \u00b0C, all five samples were correctly predicted in the order of crystallization with a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.94.

At 25 \u00b0C, the resolution is high enough to measure the differences.\nFigure 8.

Influence of PS20 on Relaxation and Crystallization The present study supports the observation of Vollrath et al. [33]. That PS20 acceler-\nates the crystallization of lyophilized amorphous sucrose matrices. Reasons for this phenomenon were already discussed above. Moreover, an influence of PS20 on the relaxation behavior had been observed in earlier studies [28]. Figures 11 and 12 show the change in relaxation times depending on the PS20 concentration. An increase in the PS20 concentration led to a reduction in relaxation time \u03c4\u03b2. This effect is more prone in the QN samples and least in the CN samples. From the aspect that PS20 is surface active, a connection with surface effects is very plausible, as QN samples have the highest and CN samples the lowest SSA. As seen in Table 6, the Tg temperatures of the formulation did not significantly change with change in PS20 concentration, but the relaxation time did. Thus, it can be concluded that PS20 has a matrix effect on the formulation that is not captured in the Tg."

PS20 accelerates the crystallization of sucrose-based lyophilizates. The mechanism was not part of the study; however, it is important to emphasize that higher amounts of PS20 should be used with care. The presented method is not intended to replace DSC measurements and shall be used as an add-on. IMC could predict, at an early development stage, whether a certain lyophilization process would lead to a more or less stable product concerning crystallization over months. The standard analytics of DSC or XRD used during real-time stability studies are unable to deliver such predictive information.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.W. and S.G.; methodology, S.G., T.M. and G.W.; investigation, S.G.; resources, G.W.; data curation, S.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, T.M. and G.W.; visualization, S.G.; supervision, T.M. and G.W.; project administration, G.W.

The black line represents the temperature set point for the shelfs, the colored solid lines the actual product temperature and the dashed line the chamber pressure. Arrows demonstrate the ice nucleation process. The pressure drop and rise at approximately 1.5 h in the controlled nucleation is needed to introduce the ice fog in the chamber. Figure A1.
