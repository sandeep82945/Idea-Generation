    "abstractText": "Dental caries are an oral infectious disease that can affect human health both orally and systemically. It remains an urgent issue to establish a novel antibacterial method to prevent oral infection for a healthy life expectancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of novel iron chelators, super-polyphenols (SPs), on the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans, in vitro. SPs were developed to reduce the side effects of iron chelation therapy and were either water-soluble or insoluble depending on their isoforms. We found that SP6 and SP10 inhibited bacterial growth equivalent to povidone-iodine, and viability tests indicated that their effects were bacteriostatic. These results suggest that SP6 and SP10 have the potential to control oral bacterial infections such as Streptococcus mutans.",

            "text": "Dental caries are an infectious disease caused by the formation of oral biofilms, known as dental plaque, in which a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria accumulate [1\u20133]. The causative pathogens are also associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes, aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, and endocarditis [4,5]. In addition, the number of elderly people in Japan who cannot brush their own teeth is increasing. Unfortunately, mechanical removal such as brushing and scaling is still the main method for removing dental biofilm and maintaining oral hygiene. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a novel method to control oral bacterial infections to maintain a healthy life expectancy and to reduce the burden on medical personnel [6]. In addition, the easy use of antibiotics against bacterial infections has led to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which has become a global problem [7,8]. Therefore, there is a need to develop new concepts and materials to control pathogenic bacterial infections as an alternative to antimicrobial agents. Iron is an essential minor metal for organisms and is involved in various biological reactions such as hemoglobin synthesis, oxidation-reduction reactions, cell growth and apoptosis. Bacteria also require iron to survive [9]. It has been reported that bacterial growth can be inhibited by iron deficiency [10]; however, the majority of iron in organisms exists in conjugate or heme forms, leaving very few iron molecules available for bacterial\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1562. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12111562 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1562 2 of 13\nuptake [11]. In addition, the human body has a biopurification system to reduce free iron in response to bacterial invasion [12,13]. To counter this host system, some microbial strains can produce iron-binding small molecules called siderophores for efficient iron uptake [14]. Consequently, as a countermeasure against bacteria, hosts defend themselves by binding the neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin to siderophores [15]. Thus, there is a constant interaction between host and bacteria, as the latter need to obtain iron for their survival. Some reports link oral microbes to iron. One study suggests that the addition of iron (3.6 \u00b5M) has been reported to increase the level of the steady-state growth of the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutans OMZ176 2.8-fold [16]. Another study suggests that the hemolysin produced by the periodontopathogenic organism Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is involved in providing hemoglobin to periodontal pockets [17]. In addition, some studies suggest that deferoxamine (DFO) and deferasirox (DFX), representatives of commercial iron chelators, inhibit the growth of periodontopathic bacteria [18,19]. However, these iron chelators cause severe side effects in the host such as diarrhea and emesis, making them difficult to consider for use in the control of oral bacterial infections [20,21]. The super-polyphenols (SPs) that have been developed by Disease Absorption System Technologies (DASTec) Co., Ltd. (Kanazawa, Japan) are novel iron chelators for use in iron chelation therapy. These compounds are synthesized from various functional groups that exhibit chelating activity and from polymers such as chitosan, glucosamine, an amino sugar, or histidine, which are amino acids. Recently, Ohara et al. reported that the water-soluble SP6 and SP10 had the strongest chelating abilities and anti-tumor effects without side effects [22]. Based on these results, we hypothesized that SPs could be used to treat oral infections. This study focused on these novel chemical agents, SPs, and investigated the efficacy of SPs on Streptococcus mutans."

            "text": "The frequent and excessive use of antibiotics over the last several decades has led to rampant antibiotic resistance in bacteria [7,8]. The rise and spread of AMR is currently a major global threat. If this situation continues, the number of deaths due to AMR is expected to increase dramatically, resulting in significant economic losses. In response to this major social problem, action plans against AMR have been developed in many countries around the world, and the promotion of research and development of new antimicrobial agents effective against AMR organisms has been taken up as an important issue. However, in recent years, many pharmaceutical companies, including those in Japan, have withdrawn from the research and development of new antimicrobial agents due to difficulties in business feasibility, drug discovery research and clinical development, and the development pipeline has been depleted worldwide. However, the control of bacterial infection by targeting iron metabolism, which was the focus of this study, proposes an approach from an unprecedented perspective [23]. Therefore, it is important to investigate the efficacy of SPs as a potential new alternative to existing antimicrobial agents. Bactericides such as povidone-iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride in mouthwashes and toothpastes are effective against oral infections; however, these chemical agents sometimes cause the bacterial flora to grow uncontrollably [24]. Therefore, bacteriostatic agents would be ideal materials to control oral pathogenic bacteria without disrupting the oral microbiota. SPs including SP6 and SP10 are biologically safe agents that have been developed to produce fewer side effects in iron chelation therapy. SP6 and SP10 (600 and 1000 mg/kg) caused no acute and basic toxicity, no body weight change, no abnormal behaviors, and no tissue damage (kidney and liver) during examination in rats when orally administered. A blood test also demonstrated no significant abnormalities. In addition, to compare the safety of SP6 and SP10 to the commercially available iron chelator DFO, an intravenous injection test showed that all mice died immediately after intravenous administration of\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1562 11 of 13\nDFO (300 mg/kg), on the other hand, none died after the administration of SP6 or SP10 (300 mg/kg). These results suggest that SP6 and SP10 are basically safer than DFO [22]. Recent systematic review has also reported that DFO is a first line for iron overload that can sometimes cause kidney disease; especially, a proximal tubulopathy pattern may be observed in treatment with DFO [25]. Therefore, the safety of SPs as a new iron chelator to replace DFO is believed to be very high, and SPs are easy to use in their application as oral bacterial infection control agents. Povidone-iodine, a complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone and iodine, is commonly used in mouthwashes and disinfectants to infiltrate the oral biofilm and bacterial cell walls [26]. In this study, the SPs were investigated to determine which SPs exhibited antibacterial effects on planktonic oral bacteria. The results showed that the bacterial turbidity of S. mutans in the presence of SP6 and SP10 (>300 \u00b5g/mL) was significantly reduced to the same level as povidone-iodine. Specifically, SP6 and SP10 have the same chelating structure, with three hydroxy groups on benzene, and have been shown to inhibit the bacterial growth and biofilm formation of S. mutans at relatively low concentrations compared to other SPs (Figures 2 and 5). In recent years, the use of iron chelators in the treatment of infectious diseases has been reported. Bereswill et al. has reported recently that the disease-alleviating effects of specific iron binding by oral DFO application in the infection of Campylobacter jejuni induced acute enterocolitis in mouse models [27]. The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of DFO against the oral bacteria Prevotella intermedia and P. gingivalis has also been reported [18,19]. These results suggest that iron chelation capacity may be important for antimicrobial activity. And it is suggested that SP6 and SP10 are compounds that can be used in antimicrobial therapy as new iron chelators. However, further investigation is needed to determine why the strength of iron chelating capacity affects antimicrobial activity. In addition, SP6 and SP10 were found to be as cytotoxic as 1% povidone-iodine in an in vitro toxicity test on human-derived cells (Figure 7). Considering that 1% povidoneiodine is a concentration that has already been used clinically in dentistry, further studies on its clinical safety would also be necessary. SPs are new compound, and their efficacy has been examined mainly in the field of cancer oncology. In particular, it has recently been reported that the administration of DFX and SP10, the compound used in this study, can regulate iron metabolism and inhibit the growth of poor prognosis esophageal cancer cells and triple-negative breast cancer cells [28,29]. Thus, iron metabolism control by iron chelation is attracting attention as a new cancer treatment strategy. In addition, the effect of iron chelation using SPs may be a target for further attention in the development of a new therapeutic strategy for AMR. A limitation of this study is that it was only able to examine the effects of the antimicrobial activity of SPs against single cultures of bacteria (S. mutans) associated with oral infections. It is essential to investigate the effects of SPs on oral and intestinal microflora in an in vivo model in comparison to commercially available iron chelators, including DFO or DFX."
