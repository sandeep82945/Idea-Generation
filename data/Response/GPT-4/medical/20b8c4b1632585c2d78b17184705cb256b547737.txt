Development of Multifunctional Lipid-based Nanoparticles for Co-delivery of Immunotherapeutics: Exploring the design and synthesis of lipid-based nanoparticles that can co-deliver a combination of immunostimulatory agents, such as cytokines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and cancer vaccines. These multifunctional nanoparticles could simultaneously target multiple mechanisms of the cancer immunity cycle to enhance the antitumor immune response.

Engineering Targeted Lipid-based Nanoparticles to Modulate the Tumor Microenvironment (TME): Focusing on the creation of lipid-based nanoparticles that can specifically target and reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This could involve the delivery of agents that repolarize M2 macrophages to M1, deplete regulatory T cells (Tregs), or inhibit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies.

Advancements in Lipid-based Nanoparticles for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy: Researching lipid-based nanoparticle systems capable of delivering personalized cancer vaccines based on the unique tumor antigen profile of individual patients. This could involve integrating next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to identify tumor-specific neoantigens for each patient and designing nanoparticles that can effectively deliver these personalized vaccines.

Improving the Delivery and Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy Using Lipid-based Nanoparticles: Investigating how lipid-based nanoparticles can be used to enhance the in vitro expansion, activation, and targeting of CAR-T cells. This could include the development of nanoparticles that deliver mRNA or gene-editing tools to modify T cells, or that activate CAR-T cells in the tumor microenvironment to improve their proliferation and antitumor activity.

Exploring Stimuli-responsive Lipid-based Nanoparticles for Controlled Release of Immunotherapeutics: Developing lipid-based nanoparticles that respond to specific stimuli within the tumor microenvironment, such as pH changes, hypoxia, or enzyme activity. These stimuli-responsive nanoparticles would release their immunotherapeutic cargo only upon encountering the target stimulus, minimizing systemic toxicity and enhancing the specificity and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.
