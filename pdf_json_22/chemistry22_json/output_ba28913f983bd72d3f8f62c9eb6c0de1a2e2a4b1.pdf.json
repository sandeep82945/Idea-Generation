    "abstractText": "Adhesive type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains are filamentous, supramolecular protein complexes consisting of a short tip fibrillum and a long, helical rod formed by up to several thousand copies of the major pilus subunit FimA. Here, we reconstituted the entire type 1 pilus rod assembly reaction in vitro, using all constituent protein subunits in the presence of the assembly platform FimD, and identified the so-far uncharacterized subunit FimI as an irreversible assembly terminator. We provide a complete, quantitative model of pilus rod assembly kinetics based on the measured rate constants of FimD-catalyzed subunit incorporation. The model reliably predicts the length distribution of assembled pilus rods as a function of the ratio between FimI and the main pilus subunit FimA and is fully consistent with the length distribution of membrane-anchored pili assembled in vivo. The results show that the natural length distribution of adhesive pili formed via the chaperone-usher pathway results froma stochastic chain termination reaction. In addition, wedemonstrate that FimI contributes to anchoring the pilus to the outer membrane and report the crystal structures of (i) FimI in complex with the assembly chaperone FimC, (ii) the FimI-FimC complex bound to the N-terminal domain of FimD, and (iii) a ternary complex between FimI, FimA and FimC that provides structural insights on pilus assembly termination and pilus anchoring by FimI.",

Weber1,5, Martin A. Sch\u00e4rer1,2, Guido Capitani2,6 & Rudi Glockshuber 1\nAdhesive type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains are filamentous, supramolecular protein complexes consisting of a short tip fibrillum and a long, helical rod formed by up to several thousand copies of the major pilus subunit FimA. Here, we reconstituted the entire type 1 pilus rod assembly reaction in vitro, using all constituent protein subunits in the presence of the assembly platform FimD, and identified the so-far uncharacterized subunit FimI as an irreversible assembly terminator. We provide a complete, quantitative model of pilus rod assembly kinetics based on the measured rate constants of FimD-catalyzed subunit incorporation. The model reliably predicts the length distribution of assembled pilus rods as a function of the ratio between FimI and the main pilus subunit FimA and is fully consistent with the length distribution of membrane-anchored pili assembled in vivo. The results show that the natural length distribution of adhesive pili formed via the chaperone-usher pathway results froma stochastic chain termination reaction. In addition, wedemonstrate that FimI contributes to anchoring the pilus to the outer membrane and report the crystal structures of (i) FimI in complex with the assembly chaperone FimC, (ii) the FimI-FimC complex bound to the N-terminal domain of FimD, and (iii) a ternary complex between FimI, FimA and FimC that provides structural insights on pilus assembly termination and pilus anchoring by FimI.\nMany Gram-negative pathogens use adhesive, filamentous protein complexes anchored to their outermembrane, termedpili, to attach to surface glycans of host cells and initiate infection1\u20135. Type 1 pili and the related P pili belong to the best-characterized pilus systems from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains6. Type 1 pili bear a single copy of the lectin (adhesin) FimH at their distal end, which recognizes terminal mannosides in high-mannose type N-glycans of the urothelial receptor uroplakin Ia7,8. FimH is bound to one or several copies of the minor subunits FimG and FimF2,9,10, which, together with FimH, form a short, linear tip fibrillum (Fig. 1a). The tip fibrillum is connected to the pilus rod, a helical and rigid quaternary structure composed of hundreds to several thousand copies of the main structural pilus subunit FimA11,12. Type 1 pilus assembly in vivo follows the chaperone-usher pathway6,13 and is strictly dependent on two protein catalysts: (i) The periplasmic chaperone FimC accelerates pilus subunit folding to a defined tertiary structure up to 104-fold14\u201316, while chaperone-bound subunits in archaic and alternative chaperone-usher pilus systems may only be partially folded17,18.

The pilus subunits undergo a structural rearrangement to a substantially more stable conformation upon assembly, with the released free energy driving polymerization22\u201324.\nThe adhesin FimH is a two-domain protein with an N-terminal lectin domain that binds glycoprotein receptors, and a C-terminal pilin domain that links FimH to the next subunit FimG7\u201310,25. In contrast to FimH, all other pilus subunits are single-domain proteins and structural homologs of the FimH pilin domain, characterized by an incomplete immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold lacking the C-terminal \u03b2strand25. After secretion of the unfolded subunits into the periplasm via the SecYEG system, the oxidoreductase DsbA catalyzes formation of a structural disulfide bond connecting \u03b2-strands A and B in each of the type 1 pilus subunits14. The periplasmic chaperone FimC then specifically recognizes the disulfide forms of the unfolded subunits and catalyzes subunit folding14,16. In all native FimC-subunit complexes, FimC completes the Ig-like subunit fold via donor strand complementation (DSC) by inserting its \u03b2-strand G1 into the incomplete Ig fold of the subunit in a parallel orientation relative to the subunit\u2019s C-terminal\u03b2-strand F14,25,26. Except for the distal subunit FimH, all other subunits possess an N-terminal extension (Nte, also termed donor strand) of approx. 15\u201220 amino acids25 that remains exposed and unstructured in FimC-subunit complexes.\nOnly native FimC-subunit complexes are assembly-competent and specifically recognized by the assembly catalyst FimD in the outer membrane27,28. FimD consists of five domains: a central, 24-stranded \u03b2barrel transmembrane domain that is obstructed by a plug domain in the inactive, resting state of FimD, an N-terminal and two C-terminal periplasmic domains (FimDN and CTDs, respectively)\n28\u201335. Chaperonesubunit complexes are first bound by FimDN\n28,36. Subunit incorporation into the pilus then occurs in an irreversible reaction termed donor strand exchange (DSE), in which the exposed N-terminal donor strand of the incoming subunit, bound to FimC and FimDN, displaces the chaperone capping the last incorporated subunit at the FimD translocation pore10,12,20,22,25,32,37\u201340. In contrast to FimC-subunit complexes, the donor strand of the incoming subunit inserts in the opposite (antiparallel) orientation, which leads to extremely stable subunitsubunit interactions that practically show infinite stability against\ndissociation24. The donor strand acceptor groove of each subunit possesses five binding pockets, P1\u2012P5, that specifically accommodate hydrophobic side chains of the respective donor strand12,24,38,39,41. Structural and biochemical data suggest that the DSE reaction is initiated by threading the donor strand of the incoming subunit into the P5 pocket of the chaperone-bound acceptor subunit39. In structures of chaperone-subunit complexes from the type 1, P or Saf pilus system, the P5 position is indeed unoccupied or only transiently occupied by the donor strand of the chaperone14,25\u201327,37,39. In the case of Caf1 pili, however, the donor strandof the chaperone alsooccupies the P5 pocket22, indicating that initiation of DSE may not follow the same mechanism across all chaperone-usher pili. During DSE, the incoming chaperone-subunit complex is handedover fromFimDN to theCTDsof FimD, thus resetting FimDN for binding the next chaperone-subunit complex29\u201332,34.\nIn the case of P pili, it is assumed that assembly termination is achieved when a sixth structural subunit, PapH, is incorporated into the pilus42,43. The inhibitory action of PapH is attributed to the observation that the PapH structure, when complexed with the P pilus chaperone PapD, lacks a P5 pocket, which likely prevents donor strand attack and incorporation of another subunit via DSE43. Besides its proposed function as assembly terminator, PapH also anchors P pili to the outer bacterial membrane42. Despite these insights, termination of pilus assembly by irreversible incorporation of a terminator subunit has never been demonstrated directly for pili assembled via the chaperone-usher pathway, and themechanismof type 1 pilus assembly termination has remained uncharacterized.\nBased on the similar gene arrangements in the P pilus and type 1 pilus gene clusters and the sequence similarity between the papH and fimI gene, FimI, the fifth structural subunit of type 1 pili, was suggested to act as functional equivalent of PapH44. Here, we addressed this hypothesis with an in vitro study, in which we reconstituted the entire type 1 pilus assembly system from all purified components, including the previously uncharacterized subunit FimI. We demonstrate directly that FimI terminates type 1 pilus rod assembly and present a complete, quantitative kinetic description of pilus rod assembly and assembly termination. Specifically, the kinetics of subunit binding to FimD and irreversible subunit incorporation into the growing pilus are in full\nshown. c Analytical cation ion exchange chromatography runs, monitoring the decrease in the concentrations of free FimCA complexes during FimD-catalyzed pilus rod assembly in vitro.

Unexpectedly, we find that incorporation of FimI is the fastest assembly step in pilus biogenesis, predicting a high excess of FimA over FimI during pilus assembly in vivo. Moreover, we show that incorporation of FimI is essential for stable anchoring of the pilus to the outer membrane. Finally, we present crystal structures of the FimC-FimI complex, the ternary FimDNFimC-FimI complex and the ternary FimC-FimI-FimA complex.

            "text": "Initiation of pilus rod assembly requires FimG or FimF at the proximal end of the tip fibrillum To study the mechanism of the supposed type 1 pilus assembly terminator FimI, we reconstituted the entire FimD-catalyzed type 1 pilus assembly reaction in vitro from all purified components. To this end, we purified the ternary complex between FimD, FimC and FimH (FimDCH) and all binary complexes between the chaperone FimC and the pilus subunits FimG, FimF, FimA and FimI (FimCG, FimCF, FimCA and FimCI; Fig. 1b). First, we probed the ability of FimDCH to catalyze pilus rod assembly from FimCA complexes by mixing FimDCH with a 20-fold excess of FimCA, using either FimDCH alone or FimDCH that had been preincubated with an 8-fold excess of FimCG or FimCF, or a FimCG/FimCFmixture. Kineticsof FimApolymerizationwere recorded by analytical cation exchange chromatography via the decrease in the concentration of free FimCA complexes and the increase in the concentration of free FimC released upon FimA polymerization (Fig. 1c). While FimDCH alone proved to be inactive as catalyst of FimA assembly, complete turnover of FimCA and release of free FimC was observed when FimDCH had been preincubated with FimCG and/or FimCF prior to the addition of FimCA (Fig. 1c).\nNegative-stain electron microscopy confirmed that FimA polymers (pilus rods) had indeed formed when FimDCH had been preincubated with FimCG and/or FimCF (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, the initiation of FimD-catalyzed FimA assembly requires the presence of either a FimC-capped FimG or FimC-capped FimF subunit at the growing end of the pilus in the periplasm.\nAt first glance, the finding that FimDCH alone did not catalyze FimA assembly contradicts a previous study in which FimDCH catalyzed pilus rod assembly from FimCA complexes20. Very likely, tiny impurities with FimCG and FimCF in the previous preparation of FimCA are responsible for this discrepancy: Specifically, denatured anddissociated type 1 pili, i.e., amixture of unfolded FimH, FimG, FimF and FimA, had served as source of FimA for production of FimCA complexes by refolding in the presence of FimC and purification of FimCA with ion exchange chromatography20. The resulting FimCA preparation thus may have contained trace amounts of FimCG and FimCF that allowed initiation of FimD-catalyzed pilus rod assembly20. In contrast, the FimCA complexes used in the present study were free of contaminations with FimCG and/or FimCF, as they were produced via refolding of FimA from cytoplasmically produced FimA aggregates (inclusion bodies; see \u201cMethods\u201d). In addition, the strict requirement of either FimF or FimG at the growing end of the tip fibrillum for initiation of pilus rod assembly (i.e., the incorporation of the first FimA copy after the tip fibrillum) found here fully agrees with the previous observation that FimD-catalyzed rod assembly was accelerated when purified FimCF and/or FimCG complexes were added20. The data also agree with studies on P pilus biogenesis and on type 1 pilus rod assembly in Salmonella typhimurium, where assembly of PapA to P pilus rods depended on the incorporation of pilus tip adapter subunits PapF and PapK, and S. typhimurium type 1 pilus rod assembly required FimF (the only adapter subunit present in S. typhimurium)45,46.\nTogether, the dependence of pilus rod assembly initiation on the presence of a minor tip fibrillum subunit appears to be common to all pilus systems with a heterooligomeric tip fibrillum. This mechanism, together with a very slow incorporation of the first FimA subunit (see below), also favors completion of the tip fibrillum prior to rod assembly. In contrast, formation of the chaperone-usher-adhesin complex alone appears to be sufficient for the assembly of pilus rods in pilus systems only bearing a single adhesin at the distal end of the pilus rod, such as for example CS1 or CFA/I pili47,48. For pili that lack a dedicated adhesin at their tips, such as Caf1 pili, pilus assemblymay be initiated via binding of a ternary chaperone-subunit-subunit complex to the usher22.\nWe next analyzed the conditions required for converting FimDCH to the fully active FimA assembly catalyst. For this purpose, we preincubated FimDCH with FimCG, FimCF or both, then added excess FimCA, and measured the kinetics of FimD-catalyzed rod assembly as a function of pre-incubation time (Supplementary Fig. 2). Herein, we refer to this conversion as the \u201cactivation of FimDCH\u201d, and restrict the term \u201ccatalytic activity\u201d to the ability of FimD to catalyze FimApolymerization from FimCA and incorporation of the assembly terminator FimI (see below). When FimDCH was preincubated with FimCG alone, maximum FimDactivitywas attained after 30min of preincubation. FimAassembly with 5\u03bcM FimCA and 0.25\u03bcM activated FimDCH took approximately 20min for completion and FimD activity slowly decreased with longer preincubation times (Supplementary Fig. 2a). With FimCF alone, FimD activity was maximum only after 6 h of incubation, while FimCA assembly was completed in less than 15min, indicating that FimD was a more efficient catalyst of pilus rod assembly when the first FimA subunit associated with FimF rather than FimG at the growing pilus end. In addition, no loss in FimD activity was observed for even longer preincubation times of up to 20h (Supplementary Fig. 2b).\nAfter initiation of FimD-catalyzed rod assembly by addition of excess (20-fold) FimCA to the activation reactions, all FimA assembly kinetics exhibited an initial lag-phase, indicating that the rate-limiting step corresponded to the incorporation of the first FimA subunit into the growing pilus20. We tested sequential (FimCG first, FimCF second) or simultaneous addition of FimCG and FimCF to FimDCH during the activation reaction and found the latter to yield the highest FimD activity, so that FimA assembly [0.18\u03bcM activated FimDCH, 3.6\u03bcM FimCA (20-fold excess)] was completed about 2-fold faster compared to sequential addition of FimCG and FimCF (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Pili generated with these most active FimD preparations were comparably shortwith amedian length of only0.6 \u00b7 102 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2d). As expected, the increase of the FimCA:FimD ratio from 20:1 to 200:1 reproducibly yielded longer pilus rods with median length of 4.2 \u00b7 102 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2e). In the following, we used these conditions for FimDCH activation as standard conditions to analyze the influence of the assembly terminator FimI on the lengths of pilus rods assembled via FimD.\nFimI terminates type 1 pilus assembly To test whether FimI inhibited pilus rod assembly, purified FimCI (1\u03bcM) was added to the FimD-catalyzed FimA assembly reaction (0.1\u03bcM activated FimDCH, 20\u03bcM FimCA) after 9min, when rod assembly was completed to about 40% (Fig. 2a). While the assembly reaction in absence of FimCI was completed within 20min, the reaction stopped within about 5min after FimCI addition and approximately half of FimCA remained unpolymerized, even after incubation for 65min (Fig. 2a). The length distributions of the formedpili (200pili from each reaction) were analyzed by negative-stain electron microscopy. As expected for FimI functioning as the assembly inhibitor and in agreementwith about 50% free FimCAcomplexes left after assembly termination by FimCI, the median pilus length decreased about 2-fold (from3.8 \u00b7 102 nm to 2.1 \u00b7 102 nm)when FimCIwas added, relative to the reaction in the absence of FimCI (Fig. 2b).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 3\nA comprehensive, quantitativemodel of pilus rod assembly and stochastic assembly termination by FimI To obtain detailed and quantitative information on the assembly termination activity of FimCI, FimD-catalyzed FimA assembly kinetics were recorded under conditions where pilus rod assembly was initiated by addition of mixtures of FimCA and FimCI to activated FimDCH. Specifically, the initial FimDCH and FimCA concentrations were kept constant (0.1\u03bcM and 20\u03bcM, respectively) and the initial FimCI concentration was varied between 0.01 and 1 \u03bcM (Fig. 2c). Indeed, FimA assembly was slowed down progressively with increasing FimCI concentrations. At the highest FimCI concentration tested (1\u03bcM, 10-fold excess over FimD), FimCA assembly could no longer be detected during 65min, analogous to incubation of FimCA alone (without FimDCH) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). The uncatalyzed FimCA polymerization proceeded extremely slowly and only yielded small FimA oligomers (but no rods) and was analyzed according to an irreversible second-order reaction as previously described40, yielding the rate constant for spontaneous, uncatalyzed polymerization of FimCA k(A-A)uncat = 0.73 \u00b1 0.02M\u22121 s\u22121. The minimal kinetic model of FimD-catalyzed incorporation of an individual FimC-bound subunit into the growing pilus includes three rate constants: Binding (kon) and dissociation (koff) of the incoming FimC-subunit complex to the N-terminal periplasmic domain of FimD (FimDN) and irreversible subunit incorporation and displacement of the FimC molecule that initially capped the growing pilus end (kDSE). This is formally equivalent to a Michaelis-Menten-type model20,49. Irreversibility of DSE may additionally be facilitated by helical quaternary structure formation of the assembled pilus rod in the\nquartile, the horizontal line indicates themedian and the whiskers the smallest and largest value of the distribution (n = 200). c Kinetics of FimD-catalyzed FimA assembly in presence of different FimCI concentrations at pH 8.0 and 23 \u00b0C. Molar ratios between FimCA, FimCI and FimD (A:I:D) are indicated. Initial concentrations were 0.1 \u00b5MFimD, 20 \u00b5MFimCA and0.01\u20131 \u00b5MFimCI. Solid lines show the result of a global fit of the data according to the model depicted in (d). d Minimal mechanism for type 1 pilus rod assembly and assembly inhibition in vitro. The rate constants for binding/dissociation of FimCA and FimCI to/from FimDN and for uncatalyzed FimA assembly were kept fixed during fitting. Rate constants for FimCA had been measured previously51. The domains of FimD are denoted: N-terminal (DN), plug (PD), transmembrane (TMD) and C-terminal domains (DC1, DC2).

For global fitting of the kinetics of FimCA consumption at different FimCA/FimCI ratios (Fig. 2c), we took into account that incorporation of the very first FimA subunit, i.e., binding to FimF at the pilus base, is slower than that of any subsequent FimA, where FimA-FimA contacts instead of a FimA-FimF contact are formed20. In addition, we included the small contribution of the very slow, FimD-independent (uncatalyzed) formation of FimA oligomers to FimCA consumption during the time window of our in vitro assembly experiment (65min). Based on our systematic FimD activation experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2) and the previously described rate constants of FimD-catalyzed tip fibrillum assembly49, we assumed that all activated FimD molecules carried a FimC-capped FimF at the growing end of the tip fibrillum. Regarding FimCI incorporation and assembly termination, we assumed that incorporation of a single FimI completely terminates pilus assembly, and that FimI can only bind to a terminal FimA subunit and not to FimF in the activated FimDHGFC complex (Fig. 2d).\nTo minimize the number of variable parameters in the global fitting of the kinetics of FimCA consumption (Fig. 2c), we determined the still unknown rate constants of association (kon) and dissociation (koff) for FimCI binding to FimDN using stopped-flow fluorescence, as describedpreviously51 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Similar to the binding of all other chaperone-subunit complexes to FimDN\n51, binding of FimCI to FimDN proved to be very rapid (kon = 1.45 \u00b7 108M\u22121 s\u22121), close to the diffusion-limit of ca. 109\u20131010M\u22121 s\u22121 52,53, and highly dynamic (koff = 94 s\u22121). Notably, the results showed that FimCI bound faster to and dissociated slower from FimDN than any other FimC-subunit complex (Table 1).\nWith the experimentally determined kon and koff values for bindingof FimCAandFimCI to FimDNand the rate constant for uncatalyzed polymerization of FimCA (k(A-A)uncat) as fixed parameters, all FimA assembly kinetics (Fig. 2c) were then fitted globally according to the model in Fig. 2d. As FimDCH preparations were shown to contain a small fraction of inactive molecules that are unable to assemble a tip fibrillum49, the total concentration of catalytically active FimDCH moleculeswas also included as anopen fitting parameter.Weobtained a value of 82 \u00b1 1% for the fraction of active FimDCHmolecules, in good agreement with the value of 90% reported earlier49. As the global fit (solid lines in Fig. 2c) did not show systematic deviations from the experimental data, we could complete our kinetic model of FimCcatalyzed pilus rod assembly (Fig. 2d) with the DSE rate constants for irreversible binding of FimA to FimF (k(A-F) = (5.5 \u00b1 0.5)\u00b710\u22123 s\u22121), FimA to FimA (k(A-A) = 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 s\u22121) and FimI to FimA (k(I-A) = 0.14 \u00b1 0.01 s\u22121) (Table 1). The results confirmed that formation of a FimA-FimA contact is two orders of magnitude faster than binding of the first FimA to FimF20.\nThe FimC-subunit complexes FimCG, FimCF, FimCA and FimCI canbe considered alternative substrates of FimD.Using the kon and koff values for binding of the different FimC-subunit complexes to FimDN and the DSE rate constants k(G-H), k(F-G), k(A-F), k(A-A) and k(I-A) determined in this study andpreviously20,49, we calculated their apparentKM\nvalues (KappM = koff + kDSE kon ) and specificity constants kDSE=K app M for the catalyst FimD (Table 1). Notably, the data showed that FimCI is the best substrate of all FimC-subunit complexes, even exhibiting a 4-fold higher specificity constant than FimCA. Overall, the specificity constants obtained for the different FimD substrates (2.3 \u00b7 102 to 2.2 \u00b7 105M\u22121 s \u22121) are in the range of enzymes with medium catalytic proficiency (Table 1).\nNegative-stain electron microscopy of samples taken from the assembly reactions (Fig. 2c) after 65min of incubation confirmed that, as expected for pilus rod assembly termination by stochastic incorporation of FimI, the length of the assembledpilus rodsdecreasedwith increasing FimCI concentrations when FimCA was kept constant (Fig. 3a). Pilus length distributions revealed that the majority of the population gradually shifted to shorter lengths and consequently the median pilus length steadily decreased, from 3.8 \u00b7 102 nm for catalyzed assembly in the absence of FimI to 0.4 \u00b7 102 nm for assembly in presence of a 3.3-fold excess of FimCI over FimD (Fig. 3b). Figure 3a, b also show that two different pilus rod populations were obtained when substoichiometric concentrations of FimCI relative to FimDwere used (in particular at FimCI:FimD ratios of 0.4:1, 0.6:1 and 0.8:1), so that somepilus rods assembled via FimD could not be terminated by FimCI: Besides FimCI-terminated pili shorter than 200nm, a second population of much longer pili with lengths of up to ~1700nm was observed under these conditions. For a comparison, the length of pili assembled in the absence of FimCI did not exceed 700nm (Fig. 3b). We interpret this result such that a larger pool of FimCA complexeswas available for pilus rod assembly via the remaining, active FimD molecules when all FimCI complexes had been consumed and had inhibited the other FimD molecules at the early stage of the assembly reaction. In fact, even at the lowest FimCI concentrations used, longer pili already began to appear. The fraction of pili with lengths above 600nm increased from about 1.5% in absence of FimI to 6.5% and 18% at FimCI:FimD ratios of 0.1:1 and 0.2:1, respectively (Fig. 3b).\nHaving a complete kinetic model of pilus rod assembly and assembly inhibition at hand (Fig. 2d) allowed us to perform Monte Carlo simulations of FimD-catalyzed pilus rod assembly reactions at different FimCI/FimCA ratios and to generate simulated pilus length distributions for comparison with the experimental data (Fig. 3c). The simulations were performed for the assembly reactions in Fig. 2c, each with 2000 activated FimDHGFC molecules. Overall, pilus rods assembled in silico were found to be slightly shorter compared to the experimental data (median length valueswere between 57% and93%of those found experimentally). Nevertheless, the simulated length distributions were qualitatively in full agreement with the experimental distributions in that the median length consistently decreased with increasing FimCI concentration (from 252nm for assembly in the absenceof FimCI to 24 nm for assembly in presence of a 3.3-fold excess of FimCI over FimD). In addition, at substoichiometric concentrations of FimCI relative to FimD, a fraction of up to 19% of the pili exceeded the maximum length of ~400 nm in the simulated length distribution\nproteins, not taking into account that only 82% of the FimD molecules were catalytically active.b, c Lengthdistributions of pili assembled in vitro (gray) and in silico (blue). Median, maximum and size n of each sample are indicated. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 6\nin absence of FimCI (Fig. 3b, c; see also above). Thus, within experimental error, the Monte Carlo predictions are in full agreement with ourmechanisticmodel of pilus rod assembly termination by stochastic incorporation of FimI.\nFurthermore, the simulation of pilus rod assembly made it possible to distinguish FimI-terminated pilus rods from non-terminated rods. The simulated length distributions, which included all pili, could therefore be deconvoluted into their two underlying subdistributions of pili with or without FimI bound (Supplementary Fig. 4). As one would expect, at the lowest FimCI:FimD ratio of 0.12:1, the entire distribution was still dominated by pilus rods that had no FimI bound. At higher FimCI:FimD ratios of 0.49:1 and 0.73:1, however, the vast majority of the pili shorter than 200 nmhadFimI bound (80% and 95%, respectively), while most pili longer than 200 nm still had no FimI bound (90%and 72%, respectively). This observation agreeswith FimCI being the best FimD substrate (Table 1), as this favors formation of predominantly short pili terminatedwith FimI (note that the fractionof pili shorter than 100nm is always highest in all the subdistributions of FimI-terminated pili (Supplementary Fig. 4)). The simulations also confirmed that those rods thatwere (i) assembled at substoichiometric amounts of FimCI relative to FimDand (ii) exceeded themaximum rod length of ~400nm for assembly simulated in absence of FimI (see topmost panel in Fig. 3c), were predominantly not capped by the assembly terminator FimI. Importantly, these longer pili disappeared at FimCI:FimD ratios above 1:1 in both the experimental data and the simulations (Fig. 3b, c), indicating that all active FimD molecules became inhibited in the presence of equimolar amounts of FimCI. The deconvoluted length distributions further supported this, showing that practically all pili were indeed capped by FimI at the FimCI:FimD ratios 1.2:1, 1.7:1 and 4.0:1 (Supplementary Fig. 4).\nIn summary, our data show that the natural pilus length distribution results from a stochastic chain termination reaction in which the ratio between FimCA complexes and the FimCI termination complex dictates the pilus length distribution, in addition to the molar FimCA:FimD and FimCI:FimD ratios. The mechanism of PapH, the subunit terminating assembly in the related P pilus system42,43, is likely identical to that of FimI."

            "text": "Type 1 pili attached to the outer E. coli membrane show an average length of a few hundred nanometers (see refs. 9,54 and below). Our pilus length distribution analysis revealed that 91% of the pili remained shorter than 200 nm at a 140-fold excess of FimCA over FimCI (Fig. 3b, second-last panel). Thus, despite the fact that transcription of the fimI and fimA genes is controlled by the same promoter55 (Supplementary Fig. 5a), for pilus assembly to proceed to the lengths observed in vivo, the concentration of FimCI in the periplasm must be at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of FimCA. Expression of the fimI and fimA genes is therefore expected to be differentially regulated.\nA prerequisite for FimC-catalyzed subunit folding is the DsbAcatalyzed formation of a single, conserved disulfide bond in the structure of all subunits14 (the disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA is the only known catalyst of disulfide bond formation in the E. coli periplasm). Therefore, differences between the kinetics or yields of oxidative folding of FimI and FimA could offer one explanation for different periplasmic concentrations of FimCI and FimCA. We tested this hypothesis and determined rate constants for (i) DsbA-catalyzed oxidation of reduced, unfolded FimI or FimA (FimIUred, FimA U red) and (ii) FimC-catalyzed folding of oxidized, unfolded FimI or FimA (FimIUox, FimAUox) using stopped-flow tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, essentially as described previously14 (Supplementary Fig. 5b\u2013g). The kinetics of DsbA-catalyzed FimI oxidation measured under pseudo-first-order conditions (6.7-fold excess of oxidized DsbA\nover FimIUred) or using equimolar initial concentrations of oxidized DsbA and FimIUred were fitted globally according to an irreversible, second-order reaction and yielded a rate constant of oxidation of 1.3 \u00b7 106M\u22121 s\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In comparison, DsbA-catalyzed oxidation of FimAUred was 40-fold slower (3.4 \u00b7 10\n4M\u22121 s\u22121, Supplementary Fig. 5e). FimC-catalyzed folding of FimIUox and FimA U ox occurred with similar rates of 7.3 \u00b7 104M\u22121 s\u22121 and 4.3 \u00b7 104M\u22121 s\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 5c, f). Consequently, the determined rate constants predicted similar in vivo half-lives of ~0.4 and ~1 s for the formation of the native FimCI and FimCA complexes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5d, g). In agreement with previous results obtained for FimA, FimG and the pilin domain of FimH (FimHP)\n14, FimC-catalyzed folding of FimI was specific to disulfide-intact, unfolded FimI, as no fluorescence change was detected when FimC was mixed with FimIUred (Supplementary Fig. 5c).Moreover, DsbA- and FimC-catalyzed oxidative folding of both FimA and FimI proceeded to completion in vitro, without yield losses due to unspecific protein aggregation. Together, these results show that the kinetics of oxidative folding of FimI and FimA are very similar and therefore are unlikely to be responsible for differences in periplasmic FimCI and FimCA concentrations. To test whether different fimI andfimA transcript levels could account for thepredicted ~102-fold excess of FimCA over FimCI in the periplasm, we determined the relative fimI and fimA mRNA levels in E. coli W3110 cells by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. 5h). The fimA transcript level was only ~8-fold higher than that of fimI and ~12-fold higher than that of fimC, in good agreement with a previous study that used a DNA microarray to determine transcript levels in E. coli MG1655 cells56. We conclude that additional mechanisms likely contribute to the regulation of the periplasmic FimCA and FimCI concentrations, for example different efficiency of translation or co-translational translocation into the periplasm and/or proteolytic degradation.\nThe \u2265100-fold higher periplasmic level of FimA relative to FimI implied by our in vitro assembly study is strikingly similar to a previous estimate for the PapA:PapH ratio (of at least 100:1) in P pilus biogenesis42, supporting the idea that the general principles of pilus rod assembly termination and pilus lengthmodulation are very similar for the type 1 and P pilus system. As a single type 1 pilus, on average, contains approximately 300 FimA molecules (see below and Supplementary Table 1) and taking into account the predicted, more than 100-fold lower level of FimI, we can estimate the upper boundary of the periplasmic FimCI:FimD ratio to be roughly unity. Because DSE, and hence assembly inhibition, is irreversible, there is in fact no need for a much larger intracellular FimCI:FimD ratio to ensure quantitative assembly termination in vivo. It therefore appears that the regulation of the intracellular levels of FimD, FimCA and FimCI and the mechanism of FimD-catalyzed pilus biogenesis co-evolved with the natural type 1 pilus length distribution in E. coli (see Fig. 4a).\nNext, we addressed the question of whether type 1 pilus length would directly depend on the FimCA:FimCI and FimCA:FimD ratios in vivo. Our above results predicted that the average length of pili displayed on cells would increase with increasing FimCA concentrations when the FimCI levels are kept constant. To test this hypothesis, we used the fimA deletion strain W3110\u0394fimA12, in which base pairs 4\u2012 528 of the fimA gene had been removed from the genome of E. coli W3110 wild-type. Negative-stain electron microscopy of W3110 and W3110\u0394fimA cells confirmed that cells of the deletion strain no longer displayed type 1 pilus rods on their surface (Fig. 4b). Successful deletion of fimA was also verified by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. 5h). To complement W3110\u0394fimA cells and allow production of variable amounts of periplasmic FimCA, we constructed the plasmid pCG1-AC12 in which periplasmic coexpression of FimAwith FimC is under control of the anhydrotetracycline-inducible tetA promoter, allowing fine-tuning of FimCA production by varying the concentration of the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) in the growth medium57.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 7\nW3110\u0394fimA cells transformed with pCG1-AC and grown in presence of different aTc concentrations were then analyzed by negativestain electronmicroscopy for their pilus length distributions. Figure 4c qualitatively shows that pilus length indeed increased with increasing aTc concentration. For a quantitative analysis, pili were released from cells by a heat step and length distributions were established for 200 pili in each preparation (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6). While the median was 2.4 \u00b7 102 nm for wild-type cells (corresponding to an average of ~300 copies of FimA per pilus), it increased from 0.7 \u00b7 102 nm to 4.0 \u00b7 102 nm for W3110\u0394fimA [pCG1-AC] grown at aTc concentrations of 5 and 17.5 ng/ml aTc, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, the maximum pilus length (defined as the average length of the 5% longest pili) gradually increased from~0.5\u03bcm(5ng/ml aTc) to ~4.0\u03bcm (17.5 ng/ml aTc) (Supplementary Table 1). These results show that pilus length in W3110\u0394fimA [pCG1-AC] can be successfully modulated via the periplasmic FimCA levels (within a relatively narrow range of inducer concentrations). The FimCA:FimCI and FimCA:FimD ratios thus determine pilus length not only in vitro but also in vivo. Our results agree with a previous study on the related P pilus system, where periplasmic overproduction of the main subunit\ncated anhydrotetracycline (aTc) concentrations. Representative results of two independent repetitions are shown.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 8\nPapA or the terminating subunit PapH caused an increase or decrease in P pilus length, respectively42. Similarly, while disruption of mrpB, encoding the terminating subunit MrpB ofMR/P pili of P. mirabilis, led to significantly longer pili, overproduction of MrpB decreased pilus length in comparison to the parental wild-type strain58.\nFimI contributes to stable anchoring of type 1 pili to the cell In the P pilus system, the assembly terminator PapHwas also shown to anchor P pili to the outer bacterial membrane42. In light of the functional similarity between PapH and FimI suggested earlier44 and established in this study, we hypothesized that FimI, like PapH, could be involved in anchoring type 1 pili to the bacterial outer membrane. To test this, an E. coli W3110 fimI deletion strain (W3110\u0394fimI) was generated. Real-time PCR confirmed successful deletion of fimI\n(Supplementary Fig. 5h). W3110\u0394fimI cells were then grown in either static or shaken liquid medium and probed for the presence of functional pili on the bacterial surface by testing the ability of W3110\u0394fimI to agglutinate with yeast cells bearing highly mannosylated mannoproteins in the cell wall (Fig. 5a). While agglutination readily occurred whenW3110\u0394fimI cells hadbeen grown statically, no agglutinationwas detected with W3110\u0394fimI grown in shaken medium, indicating that pili in W3110\u0394fimI were sheared off mechanically under shaking and lost to the culture medium. A control showed that plasmid-encoded FimI partially complemented fimI deficiency of W3110\u0394fimI and restored membrane anchoring and yeast agglutination.\nAs expected, wild-type W3110 cells displayed similar piliation levels for both growth conditions and caused agglutination even when grown under shaking. Notably, W3110\u0394fimI cells grown under shaking\nFig. 5 | FimI anchors type 1 pili to E. coli cells. a Yeast agglutination assays performed with E. coliW3110,W3110\u0394fimI andW3110\u0394fimA, which had been grown under shaking or static conditions and diluted to OD600 = 1.0 prior to mixing with the yeast cells. To complement the fimIdeletion, the plasmidpKTCTET-IC was used and gene expression induced with 30ng/ml anhydrotetracycline (aTc). Mannose\nspecificity of yeast cell bindingwas tested by a competition assay in the presence of 1M D-mannose or 1M D-glucose (negative control). b Yeast agglutination assay with E. coliW3110 andW3110\u0394fimI, grown under shaking conditions and diluted to the indicated OD600 values prior to mixing with the yeast cells.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 9\nalso agglutinated weakly with yeast cells when used at higher cell densities in the assay (Fig. 5b). This suggests that not all pili of W3110\u0394fimI were lost to the culture medium during shaking, but that the loss of pili lowered the agglutination titer of the W3110\u0394fimI strain compared to that of W3110. A control showed that addition of 1M D-mannose blocked agglutination throughout, while addition of 1M D-glucose (the C2 epimer of mannose) did not affect agglutination (Fig. 5a). This confirms that the agglutination assay indeed reported on the presenceof functional FimHat the tip ofmembrane-anchored type 1 pili. W3110\u0394fimA cells failed to agglutinate yeast irrespective of whether the cells were grown statically or under shaking (Fig. 5a). This agrees with a previous study that demonstrated a strongly impaired adhesion phenotype for E. coli cells with inactive fimA gene59. In the absence of FimA, tip fibrillae may thus still be assembled, but may be too short for reaching enough target mannosides on yeast cell walls. Together, the results show that FimI contributes to anchoring type 1 pili stably to the bacterial outer membrane under shear stress.\nBinding of FimI to the terminal FimA subunit slows dissociation of FimC from FimI 220-fold The periplasmic, growing ends of type 1 pili are capped with a FimC chaperone that binds to the terminal pilus subunit (FimI in wild-type E. coli and FimA in \u0394fimI strains) via donor strand complementation. The FimC (22.7 kDa) at the growing end is too large to pass the translocation pore of the assembly platform FimD. Release of a pilus to the extracellular medium would require dissociation of periplasmic FimC from the last incorporated pilus subunit. Therefore, FimI at the periplasmic pilus end could contribute to anchoring of the pilus to the outer membrane under mechanical stress by binding particularly strongly to FimC. Likewise, a significant fraction of membraneassociated pili may get lost to the surrounding medium in the absence of FimI. To address this question, we determined the rate constants of spontaneous dissociation of FimCHis (FimC with C-terminal hexahistidine tag) from either the binary FimCHis-FimI (FimCHisI) or the ternary FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis complex [FimCHisIA, (the \u201ct\u201d in FimAtHis indicates \u201cN-terminal truncation, without donor strand\u201d)] bymeasuring the timecourse of competitive displacement of FimCHis by excess untagged FimC\n40. While FimCHisI corresponds to the periplasmic preassembly state of FimI, the ternary FimCHisIA complex represents the product of the terminal DSE reaction in type 1 pilus assembly.\nAs a homogeneous FimCHisIA complex containing FimA wild-type was difficult to prepare due to FimA self-polymerization, we used a truncated FimA variant lacking the N-terminal donor strand (FimAtHis) to obtain the homogeneous FimCHisIA complex. FimCHisI or FimCHisIA (4\u03bcM) were incubated in the presence of a 9-fold molar excess of untagged FimC (36\u03bcM) at 37 \u00b0C and the kinetics of attaining the new equilibrium were monitored with analytical cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 6a, b). Notably, FimCHis dissociated from FimCHisIA 220- fold slower than from FimCHisI (with dissociation half-lives of 3.85 \u00b1 0.43 h and 63 \u00b1 5.7 s for FimCHisIA and FimCHisI, respectively), showing that binding of FimI to the last FimA subunit further stabilizes the FimI-FimC interaction. In addition, association between FimI and FimCHis is intrinsically tighter than that between FimA and FimCHis, because FimCHis dissociates about 10-fold faster from FimA (half-life <5 s40) than from FimI.\nTo test whether the slowed FimCHis dissociation upon FimI-FimA contact formation in FimCHisIA was a unique property of FimCHisIA or is generally observed when a binary chaperone-subunit complex associates with another subunit to a ternary chaperone-subunitsubunit complex, we also measured chaperone dissociation rates for the FimCHis-FimFt (FimCHisFt), FimCHis-FimF-FimGt (FimCHisFG), FimCA and FimC-FimA-FimAt (FimCAA) complexes as a control (Fig. 6c, d and Supplementary Fig. 8). While we obtained practically identical FimCHis dissociation half-lives for FimCHisFt and FimCHisFG\n(1.58 \u00b1 0.14 h and 1.41 \u00b1 0.12 h, respectively), FimCdissociated 40 times slower from FimCAA than from FimCA (dissociation half-lives of 17.7 \u00b1 0.4min and 26 \u00b1 1 s, respectively). Nevertheless, FimC still dissociated 13 times slower from the FimCIA complex (dissociation halflife of 3.85 h) compared to its dissociation from FimCAA, fully consistent with FimCI\u2019s function as pilus assembly inhibitor and anchor in the outer membrane. Notably, for the capsular F1 antigen of Yersinia pestis, which consists of only a single type of subunit (Caf1), there is evidence that dissociation of the chaperone Caf1Mmay also be slower for the ternary Caf1M-Caf1-Caf1 complex than for binary Caf1M-Caf123. Together, these results suggest allosteric stabilization of the proximal chaperone-subunit complex against dissociation through contact formation to the previously incorporated, penultimate subunit.\nCrystal structures of the FimCHis-FimIt, FimDN-FimCHis-FimIt and FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis complexes As a step towards understanding the structural basis for termination of type 1 pilus assembly by FimI, we solved the crystal structures of the FimCHis-FimIt (FimCHisIt), FimDN-FimCHis-FimIt (FimDNCI) and FimCHisFimI-FimAtHis (FimCHisIA) complexes to 1.75, 1.7 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, respectively (Fig. 7a, b, d). In all three structures, the overall folds of FimC and FimI are very similar [C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values were 1.2 \u00c5 (superimposing FimCHisIt with FimCI of FimDNCI), 0.92 \u00c5 (superimposing FimCHisIt with FimCHisI of FimCHisIA) and 0.95 \u00c5 (superimposing FimCHisI of FimCHisIA with FimCI of FimDNCI)]. Similarly, the overall structure of FimDNCI closely resembled that of two other ternary FimDN-FimC-subunit complexes, FimDNCF and FimDNCHP\n26,27, with C\u03b1 RMSD values of 1.4 \u00c5 (superimposing FimDNCI andFimDNCHP), 1.4\u00c5 (superimposingFimDNCF and FimDNCHP) and 1.2 \u00c5 (superimposing FimDNCI and FimDNCF) (Fig. 7c). Given the high structural similarity of FimC and FimI in the FimCHisIt, FimDNCI and FimCHisIA complexes, we focus on the analysis of the FimCHisIA structure in the following.\nThe asymmetric unit in the FimCHisIA crystals contained two copies of the FimCHisIA complex with very similar structures (RMSD of 1.4 \u00c5 for 458 aligned C\u03b1 atoms). As complex 1 (chains A, B and C) exhibited disorder near the N-terminus of FimAt and in some loop regions, complex 2 (chains D, E and F) was used for structural analysis. The interactions between FimC and FimI in the FimCHisIA complex were found to be analogous to those observed in the complexes of FimCH, FimCF and FimCA14,26,27. Specifically, FimC completes the FimI fold by DSC and inserts residues 101\u2012110 of its G1-strand between the A\u201d- and F-strand of FimI in a parallel orientation with respect to the latter. Leu103, Leu105 and Ile107 of FimC interact with the hydrophobic core of FimI and an additional 22 intermolecular hydrogen bonds, 14 ofwhich arehydrogenbondsbetweenmain-chain atoms, are formed between the FimC G1-strand and FimI. Furthermore, FimC residues 1\u20127 interact with FimI residues 21\u201326 via six intermolecular hydrogen bonds, two of which are main-chain, and both Arg8 and Lys112 of FimC form a salt bridge with the C-terminus of FimI (Supplementary Fig. 9a).\nFimI itself possesses the characteristic, incomplete Ig-like fold with six \u03b2-strands, a short \u03b1-helical segment (residues 66\u201269) and a secondary structure topology similar to that of other type 1 or P pilus subunits (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c)14,24,26,27,43,60. Consequently, the Iglike fold of FimI superimposes well onto that of the FimH pilin domain (FimHP), FimF, FimG, FimA and PapH, with pairwise C\u03b1 RMSD values between 1.5 and 1.8 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 9d). The first resolved residue near the FimI N-terminus in the FimCHisIA structure was Thr6. Residues 6\u201220 of FimI constitute the FimI donor strand and insert into the hydrophobic groove between the A- and F-strand of FimAt in an antiparallel orientation compared to FimAt\u2019s F-strand. Met13, Phe15 and Ile19 of FimI point towards the center of FimAt and complete its hydrophobic core by occupying binding pockets P2, P3 and P5, respectively (Fig. 7e). Similar to what had been observed in structures\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 10\nof FimA complemented with the FimA donor strand61,62, the FimA pockets P1 and P4 are shallow and hence occupied by Gly11 and Gly17 of FimI (Fig. 7e). In addition to these interactions, 31 intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between the FimI donor strand and FimAt (24 of which are between main-chain atoms), and Glu22 of FimI interacts with Thr39 and Ala40 of FimAt through another four hydrogen bonds.\nBesides these FimC-FimI and FimI-FimAt contacts, the FimCHisIA complex harbors a third interface. It is located between FimC and FimAt, has an interface area of 351 \u00c52 and involves both domains of FimC that form contacts to the loops connecting \u03b2-strands A and B, C and D, and E and F of FimAt (Supplementary Fig. 9e). In this interface, FimC and FimAt interact via a salt bridge between Glu62 of FimC and Arg38 of FimAt, a single hydrogen bond between the side chain of Asn191 of FimC and themain-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala93 of FimAt, amide-\u03c0 stacking between Tyr193 of FimC and the Gly146-Ala147 peptide bondof FimA, and through hydrophobic interactions between Ala195 of FimC and Pro145 of FimAt (Supplementary Fig. 9e). These\nadditional FimC-FimAt interactionsmay be the reason for the 220-fold slower dissociation of FimCHis from FimCHisIA compared to FimCHisI, and may prevent the dissociation of FimC from FimI at the pilus base and hence anchor the entire pilus to the membrane.\nPreviously, X-ray and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a pilus assembly intermediate, the complex between FimD and the type 1 pilus tip fibrillum (FimDHGFC), were solved31,32. In these structures, FimH is already translocated to the extracellular side of the outer membrane, FimG is located inside the FimD pore, and FimF and FimC are bound to the CTDs on the periplasmic side of FimD. On this structural basis and together with the solved FimCHisIA structure, we tried to model the FimD-bound structure of the proximal end of the type 1 pilus rod terminated by FimCI. Assuming that FimCI, after donor strand exchange, is transferred from FimDN to the CTDs of FimD, we superimposed FimCHis of the FimCHisIA complex onto FimC of the FimDHGFC complexes. While the structures of FimI and FimF superimposed rather well, FimAt of the FimCHisIA complex did not line up with FimG, but clearly clashed with FimD\u2019s transmembrane domain\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 11\nFimI\nFimC\nFimAt\nd FimAt\nP1Gly11\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\nMet13\nPhe15\nGly17\nIle19\nFimI donor strand\ne\nf PapDH (2J2Z.pdb)\nPapH\nPapD donor strand\nP5 pocket closed\nFimDHGFC (4J3O.pdb)\nFimF\nP5 pocket open\nFimC donor strand\nFimC IAHis (6SWH.pdb)\nFimI\nFimC donor strand\nP5 pocket closed\nFimCAt (4DWH.pdb)\nFimC donor strand\nFimAt\nP5 pocket closed\nFimDHGFC (6E15.pdb)\nFimF\nFimC donor strand\nP5 pocket open\na FimC\nFimI FimC\nFimI\nFimDN\nb\nFimI\nFimC\nFimDN\nc\nFimD CIN (7B0X.pdb)\nFimI\nFimC donor strand\nP5 pocket closed\nFimC ItHis (7B0W.pdb)\nFimI\nFimC donor strand\nP5 pocket closed\nFimD CHN P (1ZE3.pdb)\nFimHP\nFimC donor strand\nP5 pocket open\nFig. 7 | Crystal structures of the FimCHisIt, FimDNCI and FimCHisIA complexes. a Crystal structure of the binary FimCHisIt complex.

P1 to P5 indicate the positions in the hydrophobic groove of FimAt where side chains of the FimI donor strand interact with the core of FimAt. fConformation of the P5 pocket in FimI, PapH, FimHP, FimF or FimAt as observed in the structures of FimCHisIt, FimDNCI, FimCHisIA, PapDH, FimDNCHP, the complex between FimD and the type 1 pilus tip (FimDHGFC), and FimCAt.While analysis of the structures by the CASTpweb server63 did not reveal a distinct P5pocket in FimI, PapHand FimAt, the P5 pocket is clearly defined in FimHP of the FimDNCHP complex and in FimF of the FimDHGFC complex. All subunits are shown in surface representation. FimHP and FimF atoms identified by CASTp to be involved in formation of the P5 pocket are highlighted in white.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7718 12\n(Supplementary Fig. 9f). This discrepancy suggests that either FimD changes its conformation upon incorporation of FimA and formation of the helical quaternary structure of the rod on the extracellular side of FimD (the structure of FimD in complexwith an assembled pilus rod is still unknown) or conformational changes occur within FimD and/or FimCIA upon assembly termination by incorporation of FimCI.\nFor the P pilus system, previous work suggested that assembly termination by PapH is caused by the absence of a P5 pocket in the PapDH structure43, thus making PapH incapable of accepting donor strands of incoming chaperone-subunit complexes. Analysis of the FimCHisIA crystal structure by the CASTp web server\n63 revealed that FimI, akin to PapH, does not possess a distinct P5 pocket (Fig. 7f). The same analysis revealed that the P5 pocket is in anopen conformation in FimHP of the FimDNCHP complex (with a volume of 3 \u00c5\n3), as well as in FimF in the structures of the FimDHGFC complex with volumes of 51.3 \u00c53 and 18.4 \u00c53 for the cryo-EM and crystal structure, respectively (Fig. 7f). Therefore, both FimI and PapH may indeed achieve termination of pilus rod assembly by analogous mechanisms that prevent displacement of FimC at the growing pilus end by an incoming donor strand. Notably, however, the P5 pocket of FimA in the structure of the FimCAt complex is also closed (Fig. 7f). Whether or not there is a clearcut correlation between an open/closed P5 pocket in the FimC-capped subunit at the pilus base and its ability to undergo DSE with another subunit thus still remains to be shown.\nIn summary, we here identified FimI as the terminating subunit in type 1 pilus rod assembly and presented a quantitative model for rod assembly and its termination that is consistent with the natural pilus length distribution and in full agreement with a stochastic chain termination mechanism. Our results, in particular the in vitro reconstitution of FimD-catalyzed pilus rod assembly and termination, provide a basis for structure determination of FimD bearing an assembled pilus rod on the extracellular side and the FimCI termination complex on the periplasmic side by cryo-EM. The in vitro reconstitution of type 1 pilus assembly also contributes to a better understanding of enzyme-catalyzed assembly of filamentous protein polymers andprovides a general framework for testing themechanism of assembly termination and pilus length regulation in related filamentous pilus systems."

To convert FimD to an active FimA assembly catalyst, 0.35\u03bcM FimDCH complex was first incubated with an 8-fold molar excess of FimCG, FimCF or both. For FimD-catalyzed assembly of FimCA both in presence and absence of FimCI, FimDCH was preincubated with both FimCG and FimCF for 30min as this led to the highest activity of FimD with respect to FimA assembly. After preincubation, either FimCA alone, or both FimCA and FimCI were added to initiate pilus rod assembly, leading to final concentrations of 0.1 \u03bcM FimDCH, 0.8 \u03bcM FimCG, 0.8 \u03bcM FimCF, 20\u03bcM FimCA and (if included) 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.14, 0.33 or 1.0 \u03bcM FimCI.

The areas of the FimCA and FimC peak were determined using PeakFit and the EMG function (PeakFit 4.12., Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, California, USA) and the FimCA peak area plotted against assembly time. Using Dynafit72, all FimD-catalyzed kinetics were fitted numerically according the mechanism depicted in Fig. 2d, with the rate constants for\nuncatalyzed FimA assembly (k(A-A)uncat), binding of FimCA and FimCI to FimDN (kon) and dissociation of FimCA and FimCI from FimDN (koff) fixed to k(A-A)uncat = 0.73M\u22121 s\u22121, kon (FimCA) = 1.1 \u00b7 107M\u22121 s\u22121, kon (FimCI) = 1.45 \u00b7 108M\u22121 s\u22121, koff (FimCA) = 267 s\u22121 and koff (FimCI) = 94 s\u22121, respectively. Each kinetic trace was first fitted individually with the initial FimCA concentration fixed to 20\u03bcM, the initial concentration of activated FimDCH molecules fixed to 0.1 \u03bcM, and the FimCA response value andDSE rate constants k(A-F), k(A-A) and k(I-A) as fitting parameters. For normalization and conversion of FimCA peak areas to FimCA concentrations, experimentally determined FimCA peak areas of each kinetic trace were then divided by the corresponding fitted response value.

Both sets of raw data were first individually fitted according to an irreversible, second-order dimerization reaction, normalized using the fit value for the peak area at t = 0 and the known initial FimCA concentration, and then fitted globally with shared k(A-A)uncat.\nSamples for negative-stain electron microscopy were removed after 65min of assembly, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for later analysis.\nElectron microscopy and pilus length measurements Samples for negative-stain electron microscopy were prepared essentially as described9. E. coli strains W3110, W3110\u0394fimA and W3110\u0394fimA [pCG1-AC] were grown statically at 37 \u00b0C in 2YT medium (supplemented with ampicillin at 100\u03bcg/ml in case of W3110\u0394fimA [pCG1-AC]). In vivo, type 1 pili are assembledwithinminutes during the exponential growth phase of the culture but assembly slows considerably when the culture approaches the stationary phase73. Therefore, in case of W3110\u0394fimA [pCG1-AC], anhydrotetracycline (aTc, Sigma) was added to the growth medium just prior to inoculation to final concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15 and 17.5 ng/ml to ensure that FimA and FimC expressed from pCG1-AC would be available for assembly, in particular during the exponential phase of the bacterial growth curve. After 10 h of growth, 2ml of cell culture were centrifuged (10min, 2500 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C), the pelleted cells resuspended in 100\u03bcl NaH2PO4-NaOH pH 7.5 and a 3\u03bcl drop adsorbed for 20 s to a carbon-coated copper grid (300mesh, Quantifoil) that hadbeen glowdischarged for 30 s at a current of 25mA. Excess liquidwas removedby blotting the grid with filter paper, followed by negatively staining the sample for 30 s with a 20 \u00b5l drop of 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acidNaOH pH 7.6. After removing excess stain with filter paper, the grid was air-dried and images recorded using a Morgagni 268 microscope (FEI) operated at anacceleration voltageof 100 kV andequippedwith a 1376 \u00d7 1032 pixel CCD camera. Cell-bound pili of W3110 and W3110\u0394fimA [pCG1-AC] cells were released from the outer membrane by incubating the remainder of the cell suspension in a water bath at 90 \u00b0C for 10min.

For samples produced by in vitro pilus assembly reactions, electron microscopy grids were prepared as above but using 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid-NaOH pH 7.2 for staining. To investigate a larger area of the grid and thus avoid bias towards shorter pili, an array of 5 \u00d7 5 overlapping micrographs was acquired using the Multiple Image Acquisition function of the Morgagni user interface. These 25 micrographswere then stitched using the Grid/Collection stitching plugin of Fiji74,75.

Reactions were monitored by recording the change in intrinsic fluorescence intensity above 320 nm (excitation at 280 nm). For oxidation of FimIUred, fluorescence traces were fitted according to a pseudo-first-order reaction (6.7-fold excess of oxidized DsbA over FimIUred) or a second-order reactionwith identical initial concentrations (0.75\u03bcM of both oxidized DsbA and FimIUred), and then normalized. Normalized data were globally fitted according to an irreversible, second-order reaction and sharing the rate constant for oxidation and the initial FimIUred concentration among the two datasets.\nRate constants for FimC-catalyzed folding of oxidized, unfolded FimI and FimA (FimIUox,FimA U ox) were determined by 10:1 mixing of FimC (5.45\u03bcM in 20mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0) with FimIUox or FimA U ox (8.25\u03bcM in 3M GdmCl, 20mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0) using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy as above and fitting the recorded traces according to a pseudo-first-order reaction."

The maximum possible number of FimA monomers per pilus rod was set to 2200 to ensure inclusion of potentially very long pili.

Refinements were performedwith PHENIX83, and COOT84 was used formanual rebuilding of the model. Due to missing electron density, the following residues were omitted from the final models: for FimCHis-FimIt: FimI residues 123\u2013127; for FimDN-FimCHis-FimIt: FimDN residues 11\u201314, 124\u2013125 and FimI residues 119\u2013121.\nCrystals of the FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis complex were obtained at 293K via the vapor diffusion sitting drop method by mixing 2\u03bcl of protein solution (10.2mg/ml, containing less than 20mM NaCl) with 2\u03bcl of precipitant solution containing 0.8M sodium formate, 100mM Tris/acetic acid pH 8.5 and 16% PEG 4000 (w/v). Crystals grew to full size within 8 days. Diffraction data to 2.8\u00c5 resolutionwere collected at 100K on a Mar225 detector at beamline X06SA of the Swiss Light Source (PSI Villigen, Switzerland). For cryoprotection, a solution containing 16% PEG4000, 0.8M sodium formate, 100mM Tris-acetic acid pH 8.5, and 22% (v/v) ethylene glycol was used. Crystals were bathed in the cryo solution for 30\u201360 s before direct flash cooling in the cryostream. Data were processed with XDS81 in space group P6(1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER82, using the structure of the FimC-FimAt complex (PDB file 3SQB)14 as search model for FimCHis-FimI, and FimAt from the same complex as search model for the FimAt subunit in FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis. Based on Matthews volume considerations the asymmetric unit was expected to contain at least two copies of the ternary complex. The PHASER runs could locate a complete copy of FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis and an additional FimCHis-FimI complex. The lacking FimAtmolecule in the second copy of the ternary complex was placed manually by superimposing the first FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis complex onto the second FimCHis-FimI. The second FimAt molecule was found to fit into the electron density calculated from the molecules already located by PHASER. No further complexes could be located and we concluded that there are two FimCHis-FimI-FimAtHis complexes in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthew coefficient of 4.64 A3/Da (solvent content of 73.5%). This quite high solvent content is readily explained by the presence of large channels in the crystal packing. The structure was refined by successive rounds of manual model building with COOT84 and refinement with PHENIX83 using TLS groups defined by PHENIX and scale factors for the X-ray/stereochemistry weight (wxc_scale) and X-ray/ADP weight (wxu_scale) fixed to 0.25 and 1.66, respectively. Due to missing electron density, the following residues were omitted from the final model: residues 1\u201310 and 124\u2013126 (chain B, FimI), residues 14\u201324, 57\u201369, 121\u2013129 and 159 (chain C, FimAt), residues 1\u20135 and 123\u2013127 (chain E, FimI) and residues 14\u201317 (chain F, FimAt).\nValidation with MolProbity85 showed that all final models possessed good stereochemical quality. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Structural superpositions of proteins and C\u03b1 RMSD values were calculated using SUPERPOSE and secondary-structure matching86. The interface area between FimI and FimAt in the FimCHisIA complexwas calculated using PISA87, all structural representations were created with PyMOL88. The structure-based sequence alignment of all type 1 pilus subunits was created with Expresso89, using both SAP and TMalign for structural\nalignment, and rendered using ESPript 3.090. Secondary structure of FimI was assigned using DSSP91,92."
