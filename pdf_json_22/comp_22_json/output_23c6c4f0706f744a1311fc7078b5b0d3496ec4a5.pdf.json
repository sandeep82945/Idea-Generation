    "abstractText": "The software includes models of internationalization over the entire world. However, the localization work which has been conducted on Amharic locale development has limitations such as managing Ethiopian calendar and numbers. This has a considerable impact in managing the Amharic locale data in a database as well as in other software systems. Even though there are some researches reporting Amharic locale data is managed by the existing Database Management Systems/DBMS/, the data management way is noticeably exposed to error. However, these kinds of errors are handled in this research by introducing new and appropriate exception handling mechanisms. In this regard, it was not found in the literature review to overcome these problems. In this work, an Amharic Locale Extension module named am_ET was developed to integrate into an open source database environment. The most suitable open-source DBMS PostgreSQL and the C programming language were used. User acceptance testing was conducted to evaluate Amharic locale extension functionalities based on the ISO 9241-11 usability testing attributes, such as user satisfaction, effectiveness and efficiency. To validate it, 35 voluntary potential users were randomly selected to participate in the usability test of the developed system. A descriptive statistical analysis and percentage method had been used to test the collected data. Accordingly, the usability test result showed that a positive opinion for the users and developers to manage Amharic local data as it easily manages data formatted to suit Ethiopian locales system such as currency, calendar, and data/time, reduced costs for developers, and better understanding of product functionalities. Consequently, the developed Amharic locale extension solved problems of data management with Ethiopian locales. The paper found that integrated extension module is helpful in localization and design application areas for all entities that are using Amharic locale in open source databases.

INTRODUCTION A database to be truly purposeful, it should not only store huge amounts of records, but also be easily available, accessible and reliable. In addition, new information and modifications would also be reliable, accessible, store large amount of data, and fairly easy to input. An efficient database system should have a program that accomplishes the queries and data stored on the system must be integrated [1]. Due to the tremendously increasing volumes of the local data, which are a by-product of modern life, there is a growing need of an appropriate database that require efficient methods for their management and retrieval. Storing and accessing data in their original representation is\nvery important, since converted data sometimes may result to loss of information [2]. Open source databases become by their own to stand as solutions for every data management need in the enterprise. The process of adapting a product to new linguistic and cultural specifics of content to a given geographical aspect (local) is localization. The Ethiopic script (i.e here Amharic script/ Ge\u2019ez) used as the writing method of Semitic language spoken in Ethiopia and it includes more than 400 characters. Although the language (Ge\u2019ez) has only been used in dialect speech (it now serves as a liturgical purpose only), the inscription is still broadly used for the writing system of both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Semitic\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n2 VOLUME XX, 2022\nlanguages such as Tigr\u00e9 and Amharic [3, 4]. The ancient calendar of Ethiopia has differences from the Gregorian calendar in terms of day, month and year. The Ethiopic calendar has 13 months, of which 12 months have 30 days and the 13th month comes at the end of the year with 5 or 6 days depending on whether the year is a leap year or not [1,5]. As a result, a huge amount of data in Ethiopic script uses Ethiopian calendar which needs to be stored in databases according to Ethiopian locale system. Generally, programs are culturally neutral. They have an interaction between many components which are arranged in specific patterns and have performed many tasks. When the linguistic and cultural specificity are added to these programs many more people are comfortable with their native language. Most of the existing environmental systems including the models for internationalization are used to allow software developers to develop easily that support different locales [6]. Even though, software\u2019s including models of internationalization, the localization work conducted on Amharic locale development has limitations. This has a considerable impact on managing the Amharic locale data in database as well as in other software system. Calendar and collation sequences are examples of Amharic locales which did not manage in the current software environment. A calendar as described in [7] is a human abstraction of the physical timeline. It can measure periods and times using any well-defined time unit. A typical calendar property is the language in which time values are expressed. For example, in the Ethiopian calendar Amharic and Geez are used to express periods of time, but in the Gregorian calendar English is used to express periods of time in the United States. In almost all countries, the usage and practice of a calendar are influenced by the national, cultural, legal, and even business orientation of the user. Most of the existing operating system uses the Gregorian calendar system, foreign cultural systems such as numbers, currencies, calendars, date & time, etc, and managing of such data in the databases. However, most of the data in Ethiopia are available with Ethiopian calendar system and users in Ethiopia are not convenient with the Gregorian calendar since they use Ethiopian calendar in their day-to-day activities. This usually creates inconvenience when the user wants to have a reference to Ethiopic date as they had Gregorian calendar and date & time, foreign currency and numbers at their operating system. This study focused on the investigation of locale integration in database environment, identifying techniques and methods that have been applied in the area of database localization. Moreover, it has been a duty in designing an appropriate Amharic locale extension module to integrate into PostgreSQL; and evaluating its efficiency, advantages and reliability for the requirement of Amharic integration in the database system. The currently used database by the selected organization (Private Organizations\u2019 Employees Social Security Agency \u2013POESSA) is known as Employee Social Security\nManagement System (ESSMS) developed using a DBMS of the SQL server. We have selected three tables (Employee, Service, and Family) of the database for the experimental results by introducing new data types such as ethdate and ethmoney on the existing DBMS to evaluate the proposed solution by comparing with the existing DBMS and the created extension. After the experiment the currency, the calendar, the number entered to the system is retrieved and managed without error(s) and hence the result shows that the proposed/developed Amharic locale extension has a positive impact to the study of localization The aim of this research work is to develop Amharic locale extension module to integrate in open-source database, and evaluating its efficiency. Specifically, it is aimed to explore related works in locale integration in database environment; identify different techniques and methods that have been used in the area of database localization; identify the DBMS components that are linked to locale integration; identify the requirement of Amharic locale integration in database systems; design an appropriate Amharic locale integrating system using a selected open source database; and test the prototype and evaluate the system\u2019s efficiency. Accordingly, the following questions have been obtained by the researchers to be replied at the end of the research work:\n What suggestions and opinions by the users (i.e the end-users and database admins) have been entertained\non the Module\u2019s Qualification of using Amharic Locale Extension (am_ET)?\n How Satisfied are the users (i.e the end-users and database admins) about the use of am_ET module of\nthe Amharic Local Extension?\n What opinion of the users (i.e the end-users and database admins ) about the Usefulness of the Amharic\nLocale Extension (am_ET) module?\n What options and suggestions are given by the users (i.e the end-users and database admins) about the\nQuality Attributes of Amharic Locale Extension (am_ET) module?"

A set of 38 phonetics, seven vowels and 31 consonants, marks up the full list of sounds for the Amharic language [9]. Consonants are commonly categorized as stops, fricatives, nasals, liquids and semivowels. Some sounds have similarities with English but are characterized using dissimilar symbols. These include \u127d [ch], \u129d [nx], \u123d [sx] and \u12e5[zx]. Sounds that are the features of Amharic but not found in English are \u1335 [px], \u1325 [tx], \u1345 [xx], \u132d[cx] and \u1245 [q] [10]. In Amharic language, all consonants except \u1205 /h/ and \u12d5 /ax/ might come about in either a geminated or a non-geminated method.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

When Amharic sentence is observed from grammatical construction point of view it is a grouping of noun phrase and verb phrase. The noun phrase emanates first and then the verb phrase. Based on the number of expressions or phrases they comprise, sentences in Amharic are categorized under two basic categories simple and complex sentence. The simple sentence only comprises a single verb while the complex sentence is built by combining more than one noun phrases and verb phrases. Therefore, due to such variety and complex characteristics of the Amharic culture, vowels and calendars, development and integration of the Amharic Locale into an open source will make the data management routine easier."

There are cultural beliefs around the world that lead people to use their calendar which is entirely different or the same to some extent as the western Gregorian calendar. However, they put up with the rule of 12 months a year. An Ethiopian year is contained of 13 months, and is seven years late than the Gregorian calendar. In fact, Ethiopians celebrated the new second millennium on September 11, 2007; this is because the Ethiopians continued with the same calendar that the Roman church amended in 525 AD. While the first 12 months have 30 days, the last month, called Pagume, has five or six days depending on a leap year. Ethiopia, being one of the rare countries in the world, quite uses its own calendar system. The country celebrates some vital holidays on days that are unlike the rest of the world [12]. Lielet [13] localized some contents of the open source web development tool (specifically Joomla) into Amharic to create professional and nonprofessional users who take part in website development has been conducted who want to develop a website comfortably. The Amharic translations are issued in the front and back end interfaces. A virtual keyboard is designed To make Amharic text entry easier and make the web content manageable ny the user, a virtual keyboard is designed and implemented. However, this work also does not take into consideration the different locales of Ethiopia like calendar, date/ time format, sorting/ collation order, regular expression etc. In Sarfraz et al. [14] study, the authors presented the process used to localize a set of open-source software applications that developed in English language for Urdu speakers in Pakistan. The software applications were selected are web browser, an email client, instant messaging client, word processor, graphics editor and webpage development tool. The paper presents the criterion for localizing software was that the application must be\ninternationalized. Since, internationalized development facilitates an efficient and convenient localization process by separating the resource file that need to be customized (localized) for a target locale. Bader [15] presented the analysis and the technique of website localization from the source language (English) to the target language (Arabic). The key points considered to localize a website to the target language (Arabic) were resource file and the database table. The author localized and put a separate resource file for the target language. Since the software localization process must include database design adjustments in order to enable the target language supported by the localized software. The author uses a commonly used method for developing a multilingual database is to create two tables. According to Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide [16], Oracle support globalization as National Language Support (NLS) features to decide on a national or official language and store data in a definite character set and executed with Oracle NLS Runtime Library. The NLS Runtime Library provides a collection of languageindependent functions that perform appropriate text, character processing and linguistic-convention operations. According to Axmark and Widenius [17], to store and retrieve data, database tables were used in different languages and character sets differently. As such, MySQL included model of internationalization and localization for adapting different locale system for efficient data management. MySQL support different character set for SQL statement, languages for error messages, locale time at different levels, for example, the server, database, table, and column level. The literature reviews indicated and suggested that Amharic scripts and calendars can be localized based on different localization methods.\nC. INTEGRATING THE ETHIOPIC LOCALE IN TO OPEN SOURCE DATABASES According to Elmasri [18], a database is an organized and structured collection of records and data that is stored in a computer system. A very high effective and efficient database system should have a program that manages and executes the queries, data and information stored on the system should be incorporated and integrated. Due to tremendously increasing volumes of local data, which are a by-product of modern life, there is a growing need of an appropriate database that require efficient methods for their management and retrieval. Storing and accessing data in their original representation is very important, since converted data sometimes may result to loss of information [2]. Open source databases have come into their own to stand as solutions for every data management need in the enterprise. According to reports of DB-Engines [19], an online initiative to collect and put-into information on database management systems, popularity of open source databases are growing faster than commercial databases. The process\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n4 VOLUME XX, 2022\nof adapting a product to new linguistic and cultural specifics of content to a given geographical aspect (locale) is localization. The Ethiopic script (Ge'ez) is used as the writing system of Semitic language broadly spoken in Ethiopia and it includes more than 400 characters. Although the language (Ge\u2019ez) only to be used in vernacular speech as it is now serves a liturgical function only, the script is still mostly used for characterizing the Ethiopian and Eritrean Semitic languages such as Amharic, Tigr\u00e9 and Tigrinya [3,4]. As a result, a huge amount of data in Ethiopic script use Ethiopian calendar in which it needs to be stored in databases according to Ethiopian locale system. Therefore, managing the sorting and searching of data in the database system is the main important operations in database system and hence developing a module/extension that incorporates the Amharic Locale data type to integrate into an open source database is useful."

As shown in Figure 1, the architecture to extend PostgreSQL DBMS is composed of two major components: PostgreSQL server and extension module. To support locale specification at all levels of a database (database catalog, schema, table, record and attribute) we proposed new data types. The data types implemented as the storage format for Amharic locale data with rich semantics that capture the in-built and familiar concepts of Amharic locale and associated with DBMS components for making the process of the database system can be fully supported Amharic locale convention. We propose wider adoption of locale convention by developing Amharic locale extension module. The availability of such module in Amharic locale will help to make execution of locale operators possible.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2022 5\nThe PostgreSQL Server component is responsible for managing the database files, accepting connections to the database from client applications, and performing actions on the database on behalf of the clients. Since no Amharic locale conventions is specified in SQL standards, each DBMS has taken their own approach for handling such queries based on Romanization of the Amharic script.\nThe query processing system invokes the Ethiopic locale file during query parsing to perform database tasks with Ethiopic cultural convention, type checking and binding of Amharic defined functions. We developed Amharic extension module that can be loaded into PostgreSQL server as needed. Once we load it into the database, this extension can function as built-in features. This extension is created in the form of a dynamically loadable object module. This extensions module consists of a dynamically loadable library (shared object), configuration (control) file and SQL files (script). Packaging all these files as an Amharic locale extension gives the benefit that PostgreSQL will recognize them as a single unit and it is helpful to simplify database management. There are two phases to add this extension module to the PostgreSQL server. First, we create the extension in C language and then compiling it into a dynamic object module (.dll). Next, load the extension module to PostgreSQL server by CREATE EXTENSION command. We identified locales which universally explain culturaldependent aspects of a data. More specifically, there are properties that define the internal mechanisms of how data should be managed in a database. After the locales are identified we need a real implementation to support Amharic locale in database system. We have used a C code as real implementation of Amharic locale extension. We used C Programing language as it is preferable for bilingual\nmodel and has nothing to do with any particular hardware or system [22]. As we mentioned earlier, to support Amharic locale in PostgreSQL we proposed new data types. New data type creation requires implementing external form and the internal form of a value. These functions (internal and external forms) determine how the type appears for input by the user, output to the user and how the type is organized in memory.\nThe control file specifies properties/metadata about the Amharic locale extension, which tells the basics about extension to PostgreSQL to register in its system catalog, and must be placed in the installation\u2019s SHAREDIR/extension directory. The file is am_ET.control, Parameters inside this file follows the same convention as postgresql.conf file (i.e. parameter_name = parameter_value). SQL script is mapping file, which we used to map all the SQL function with the corresponding C function of the extension (am_ET). It contains SQL commands about functions, types and operators of the Amharic locale. It also includes the required DDL and DML operations of extension. The file is am_ET\u20141.0.sql. Once the extension module is loaded into PostgreSQL server, database operations can be performed on the Ethiopian locale data according to Amharic locale convention. In order to manage Amharic locale data, the database user must write SQL statement on a query tool and execute it. By using Amharic extension module, DDL and DML operations can be performed on the database as shown in figure 3.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

This paper proposed different criteria for evaluating the quality of a developed system and finally adapted suitable criteria from Cavus [24] that best fits the developed module to evaluate its efficiency, usability, and reliability. These assessment methods and techniques are presented with respect to each development phase of the extension module. Then endusers\u2019 and database admins\u2019 feeling was taken. In the final of all these assessments and evaluations, the authors enhanced the extension module consequently based on assessment and evaluation results. In this regard, the study\nengaged on quantitative data, which were collected over the questionnaire named \u201cDatabase Admins\u2019 and End-users\u2019 Feelings about the Developed and Integrated Amharic Locale Extension module and Integrated into the Open Source database Acceptance\u201d that was compiled and developed by the researchers.

The content, quality, legitimacy and validity of the organized questionnaire were checked by 4 professionals, comprising 2 database specialists and 2 software testing professionals and were approved that it is possible to use in the research study and the consistency and reliability of the data collection tools were determined to be 0.89 using Cronbach\u2019s alpha, which is much advanced than the absolute value of 0.72 [25] indicating a higher degree of validity. The prepared questionnaire comprises of four parts. The first part consists of seven questions and it was used to asses and evaluates the integrated extension module\u2019s qualification. Five-point Likert scale (having values of strongly agree-SA (5), agree-A (4), less agree-LA (3), disagree-DA (2) and strongly disagree-SD (1)) for the responses of the items and questions were used as it is easy to understand and interpret. The second part of the designed questionnaire was used to test the module usability of the developed extension module and consists of 7 items. Usability is designated as the practice quality of a method or system from the perception of users (endusers/database admins). The third part having seven questions was used to prove the usefulness of the modules based on the attitudes of the end users and database admins. The questionnaire consists again the 5-point Likert scale type questions which strongly agree was indicating score 5 and strongly disagree was representing score 1. Strongly agree interpreted a positive attitude of the participants to the am_ET Amharic Locale Extension module.

To store phone number by using this extension module we can use varchar /text /char data type with fixed length and use function to_phone() to clear the difference between phone number with other text value. To manage geez number by using this extension module, integer data type and function to_number() can be used because the existing systems assume geez numbers as different character [27]. Managing Amharic locale data in the existing DBMS with western locale convention leads to miss information. For example, when inserting a value for a column \u12c8\u122d \u1203 \u12ca \u12f0 \u1218\u12c8\u12dd (monthly salary) the amount is stored in $. In the existing DBMS, it is not possible to perform the required operations to manipulate Amharic locale data. However, by using the developed extension we can do different operations on Amharic locale data according to the locale convention. Even though Amharic locale data is managed [28] by the existing DBMS, the data management way is noticeably exposed to error. i.e. any invalid value for the column salary, date of birth, date of hire, Phone number and registration date can be inserted. However, these kinds of errors are handled by appropriate exception handling mechanisms on the developed extension module. From the encouraging and promising estimations gained in the study, it is shown that end-user and database administrators of POSSA do not have any trouble in retrieving the required information and local data on the designed and integrated extension module whenever they need it without more effort; and its validity is approved based on [23]. In order to get the opinions and perceptions of participants on the quality attributes of the designed and developed am_ET extension, the survey considers for its functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency and maintainability as it could be adopted from Cavus [24]. The assessment of the localization applications is specifically relevant; however, few researchers have addressed these measurement criteria using laboratory experimental studies with database administrators and end-users in real areas. According to Kumar [29] a Heuristics evaluation has been proposed to test a developed system and therefore, the most significant distinctive of the paper is that the developed Amharic Locale Extension module, am_ET, has been tested and verified by real users, namely database admins and end-users. There are many researchers that have used the 5- point Likert scale format questionnaire for the assessment of the efficiency of any developed applications designed and implemented in their studies [30].

The advantages of the proposed work would enable to easily manage data formatted to suit Amharic locales system (such as collating sequence, calendar and date/time etc\u2026); to reduce costs for developers since they can focus only on handling Amharic locale system instead of dealing with conversions after developing the whole DBMS in English locale; and to local language development in the digital world and to better understanding of product functionalities of DBMS; and used as an input for other works. It is anticipated that the integrated extension module would be helpful to anyone who may have an interest in localization and design applications, and all organizations that used Amharic locales in open source databases. Apart from government efforts, individual developers also need to be motivated to take part in the localized data management development processes. In this study, we have made the first step towards the vital or ultimate objective of achieving and attaining complete multi-locale functionality in database systems."
