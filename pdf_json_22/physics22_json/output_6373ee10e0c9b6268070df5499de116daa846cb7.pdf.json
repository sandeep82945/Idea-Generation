Hence, its physics is fully confined to space of this lower dimension. Stated differently, effective description of space occupied by critical Anderson electron becomes a full description in infinite volume. We then show that it is a general feature of the effective counting dimension underlying these concepts, that its subnominal value implies an exact description by effective support.\nKeywords: Anderson transition, localization, criticality, effective counting dimension, effective number theory, effective support, effective description\nDisorder-induced localization of electrons, namely the Anderson transition [1], attracts the attention of theoretical physicists for over six decades. Its scaling theory [2] is based on the system size and the disorder dependence of electron conductance [3\u20135], and enables a quantitative description of the phenomenon [6, 7], including the calculation of critical exponents [8]. However, the absence of self-averaging in the localized state [9] suggests that faithful description of the transition requires information on statistical properties of key quantities, such as conductance [10, 11], and of electronic eigenstates themselves [12\u201314]. Here we study critical wave functions that have been of interest, among other things, due to their intriguing geometric structure [15\u201320]. Being more complex than that of a scale invariant fractal, this structure is commonly termed as multifractal. Its chief manifestation is the presence of non-trivial dimensional features.\nRecently, a new type of dimension based on effective counting [21\u201323] has been proposed [24, 25]. This effective counting dimension is analogous to Minkowski box-counting dimension of fixed sets [26]. To explain the connection in the present setting, consider first the nominal dimension DIR of spatial lattice L, which conveys the increase of lattice volume N (number of lattice sites) with linear size L, namely N [L(L)]\u221dLDIR for L\u2192\u221e. Hence, DIR is based on the same scaling as the infrared version of Minkowski dimension in a special case when all existing \u201cboxes\u201d are counted. Next, consider a subset S(L) \u2282 L(L) containing N [S(L)] points selected by some rule at each L. The Minkowski dimension dIR of the infrared target S defined by S(L) then expresses the asymptotic growth of N with L, namely\nN [S(L)] \u221d LdIR[S] for L\u2192\u221e (1)\nIn the relations above, N=N [. . .] is treated as a function on sets, namely as the ordinary counting measure.\nHowever, if we wish to characterize wave functions describing quantum particles by such spatial dimension,\nwe encounter a conceptual problem. Indeed, wave function informs on probabilities for a particle to reside in any region of space rather than on a unique subregion S associated with the particle. Is it then even meaningful to talk about a volume-based characteristic analogous to Minkowski dimension?\nSurprising answer to this question is yes [25]. The schematic logic leading to the resulting prescription is as follows. Consider a probability vector P = (p1, p2, . . . , pN ) where pi = \u03c8\n+\u03c8(ri) is the probability of the particle in state \u03c8 to be at lattice site ri. Assume further that we can count lattice points ri effectively, based on their relevance pi. In other words, that we have a function N = N[P ] at our disposal, returning effective count of entries in P . This could be used to define the effective spatial support S[P ] of a particle as a collection of N[P ] points ri with highest probabilities. If the effective number function N is additive, then S[P ] respects relevant measure considerations [25]. For IR-regularized wave functions \u03c8(L), the scaling of N[P (L)] with L would then represent the IR dimension dIR of the target \u03c8 in this probabilistic setting. The key result of [25] is that all schemes N producing valid supports S[P ] lead to the same dIR, which uniquely extends Minkowski dimension into the probabilistic domain. Value of dIR can be extracted using the intrinsic (minimal) effective scheme N? namely [21]\nN?[P ] = N\u2211 i=1 n?(Npi) , n?(c) = min {c, 1} (2)\nMore explicitly, the following analog of (1)\nN?[P (L)] \u221d LdIR[\u03c8] for L\u2192\u221e (3)\ndefines dIR of the target wave function \u03c8.\nWe emphasize that the concept of dIR[\u03c8] is recent [21\u2013 25] and has so far been applied to Dirac modes in quantum chromodynamics [24] and states at 3d Anderson transitions [27]. Despite the extensive literature on the\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n13 56\n9v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .d\nis -n\nn] 1\n0 M\nar 2\n02 3\n2 spatial structure in the latter context (e.g. [12\u201316, 18\u2013 20, 28\u201330]), information conveyed by dIR is different and complementary to existing results due to additivity of effective counting.\nRecent calculation of dIR for critical wave functions at 3d Anderson transitions produced unexpected results [27]. To explain them, consider the 3d Anderson model [1] on cubic lattice (DIR =3) with periodic boundary conditions, and the Hamiltonian (orthogonal class)\nH = \u2211 r r c \u2020 r cr + \u2211 r,j c\u2020r cr\u2212ej + h.c. (4)\nHere r=(x1, x2, x3) labels lattice sites, ej (j=1, 2, 3) unit lattice vectors, r\u2208 [\u2212W/2,+W/2] uniformly distributed random potentials, and cr the 1-component electron operators. Definition of dIR =dIR(E,W ) involves averaging over states in the vicinity of energy E and over disorder { r}, thus entailing N?\u2192\u3008N?\u3009 in Eq. (3). At the critical point E=0, W =Wc=16.543(2) [31], the calculation in Ref. [27] yielded the dimension dIR \u2248 8/3. In fact, the computed values in orthogonal, unitary, symplectic and chiral (AIII) classes all turned out to be well within two parts per mill of 8/3, while being pairwise equal within errors. These findings led to the proposition that the critical exponent dIR is super-universal in 3d Anderson transitions [27].\nHere we inquire about the probability P that 3d critical Anderson electron is present in its spatial support, which conveys the extent to which is its physics tied to this low-dimensional (dIR < DIR) space. Formal definition of P relies on that of effective support [25]. The latter starts by ordering lattice sites in L = {r1, r2, . . . , rN} by their relevance, so that p1 \u2265 p2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 pN in P . To realize supports involving both integer and non-integer number of sites (N is real-valued), we represent them by generalized collections {r1, . . . , rJ : f}, where 0< f \u2264 1 specifies the fraction of rJ included. The effective support of P (equivalently of \u03c8) on L in counting scheme N is 1\nS[P,N ] = { r1, . . . , rJ : N[P ] + 1\u2212J } (5)\nwhere J =ceil(N[P ]), and ceil is the ceiling function. Note that J\u2264N . The probability associated with S is\nP[P,N] = J\u22121\u2211 j=1 pj + f pJ (6)\nwhere J=J [P,N] and f=f [P,N] are specified by Eq. (5). We now determine this probability for critical Anderson\nelectron (Hamiltonian (4)) in the intrinsic scheme N?,\n1 While the distinction between full and fractional inclusion of rJ doesn\u2019t matter for most asymptotic (N\u2192\u221e) considerations, it affects the accuracy of extrapolations when dIR is much smaller than DIR. Fractional approach keeps additivity relations exact [25].\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 1/L\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n1\n= 1.00007(21)\n50 100 150 L\nmax\n0.995\n1\n1.005\nP *\nP *\nFIG. 1.

More precisely, we compute the critical value\nP? \u2261 lim L\u2192\u221e \u3008 P?[P (L)] \u3009 (7)\nwhere averaging has the same meaning as in the case of critical dimension dIR. In what follows, L is dimensionless i.e. expressed in units of lattice spacing. We study 24 finite systems with sizes in the range 32\u2264L\u2264160, each represented by at least 40k realizations of disorder. Electron eigenfunctions were computed using the JADAMILU library [32]. Two levels closest to E=0 for each disorder were included in the analysis.\nComputed probabilities are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of 1/L. The asymptotic 1/L\u21920 value P? is extracted by fitting to P? + b/L\u03b2 involving a general power correction. Since data at different L are uncorrelated, we use the standard minimum \u03c72 procedure. The master fit using all data leads to P?=1.00007(21). To see how this emerges as the size of the system increases, we show in the inset of Fig. 1 the values of P? obtained from fits in intervals [32, Lmax] where Lmax =48, 64, 80, . . . , 160. All fits were stable and had good \u03c72/DOF (0.8 < \u03c72/DOF < 1.1). Given the accuracy and robustness of these results, and that limLmax\u2192\u221e P?(Lmax)=P?, we conclude that P?=1.\nFew comments are in order. (i) We found that the association (expressed by P?) of critical Anderson electron with its spatial support S? increases with system size L, although the volume of S? shrinks relative to the volume of the lattice. Indeed, the ratio N [S?(L)]/N [L(L)] approaches zero roughly as L\u22121/3 since DIR =3 and dIR\u22488/3. (ii) Moreover, electron becomes fully confined to S? in L\u2192\u221e limit (P?\u21921). This space of lower dimension thus turns into a complete arena for its physics.

Probability Pp that critical Anderson electron is found in region Sp specified by the participation number Np. Fit to Pp + b/L\u03b2 for L in range [48, 160] and the resulting Pp are shown. Fits in range [48, Lmax] produce Pp values in the inset.\nthat the counting scheme N? is minimal [21], the associated effective support S? is also minimal [25], together with its P?. More precisely, we have\nP?[P ] = P[P,N?] \u2264 P[P,N ] (8)\nfor all distributions P on a finite lattice, and all N consistently defining effective support [25]. Hence, P? = 1 implies P=1 for all valid N. In other words, similarly to dIR\u22488/3, the property P=1 is well-defined.\nWe now show that P? = 1 follows from dIR< DIR. In fact, the corresponding feature is built into the effective dimension already at the pre-metric level: aspects involving distance, such as infrared and ultraviolet, are not crucial to it. We thus give the argument in the most general setting where collections O = {o1, o2, . . . oN} contain arbitrary objects ordered by P , with no additional structure assumed. The notions of effective support S[P,N] and its probability P [P,N] (Eqs. (5) and (6)) generalize trivially, with all observations made so far still holding. Effective counting dimension in this setting expresses the scaling of N? with N (see [25] and below).\nOur reasoning relies on the relationship between N? and P? that follows directly from the defining relations (2), (5) and (6). In particular, splitting N? into a contribution NS? from objects in support S? and the rest yields\nN?[P ] = N S ? [P ] +N ( 1\u2212 P?[P ] ) (9)\nfor all P = (p1, p2, . . . , pN ). Indeed, note first that S? contributes NS? = \u2211J\u22121 i=1 n?(Npi)+f n?(NpJ ) and the rest\nis (1\u2212f) n?(NpJ )+ \u2211N i=J+1 n?(Npi). Since n?(Np)=Np for p \u2264 1/N and pi \u2264 1/N for i = J, J + 1, . . . , N , we obtain the formula (9).\nEffective counting dimension \u2206 is assigned to a sequence Ok of collections with increasing number Nk of objects and probability vectors Pk = (pk,1, pk,2, . . . , pk,Nk). The pair Ok, Pk \u201cregularizes\u201d the k\u2192\u221e target defined by the sequence. Dimension \u2206 of the target is specified by [25]\nN?[Pk] \u221d N \u2206k for k \u2192\u221e (10)\nthus taking values in the range 0\u2264\u2206\u2264 1. The subdimensional case \u2206<1 implies P?=1. To see that, write Eq. (9) for Pk in the form\nN?[Pk]\u2212NS? [Pk] Nk = 1\u2212 P?[Pk] (11)\nIf \u2206 < 1 then lhs approaches zero at least as fast as (1/Nk)\n1\u2212\u2206 for k\u2192\u221e. Hence, limk\u2192\u221e P?[Pk] \u2261 P? = 1. When metric is in place and regularization removal k\u2192\u221e corresponds to infinite-volume (IR) limit Lk\u2192\u221e, then dIR of Eq. (3) and \u2206\u2261\u2206IR of Eq. (10) are related by dIR =\u2206IRDIR. Thus, \u2206IR<1 is equivalent to dIR<DIR. Hence, the latter implies P? = 1 for critical Anderson electrons, as claimed.\nWe close with a few comments.\n(a) We showed that, in the subdimensional case, the minimal effective support S? fully describes collection O of N objects when N \u2192\u221e. Consequently, S based on counting schemes other than N?, and thus entail more voluminous descriptions, involve a redundancy: any excess of probability in S relative to S? goes to zero in N \u2192\u221e limit when \u2206 < 1. This further underlines the unique standing of N? and S? in effective quantitative analyses. (b) We focused on the Anderson system with S? describing the physical space occupied by the electron. The critical case is subdimensional (dIR \u2248 8/3 [27]) and the above property implies that electron is fully confined to the corresponding subvolume in L\u2192\u221e limit. This is confirmed by our detailed numerical analysis. Since simulations of Anderson systems provide the full access to S?, all aspects of critical spatial geometry and their relationship to the underlying physics can in fact be investigated. (c) The value dIR \u2248 8/3 may be connected to anomalous scaling of critical diffusion length `(t) \u221d t1/3 [33]. (Possibly also to exponent 4/3 characterizing percolation clusters [34] (see also [35]).) This is plausible since anomalous diffusion is likely due to electron propagation being effectively restricted to wave function support on a sample. That, in turn, qualitatively relates to the associated diffusion properties. Such connection is also corroborated by the observed superuniversality of dIR [27] since the diffusion exponent is also expected to be superuniversal. The present work fortifies this possible connection. Indeed, not only is P? = 1 super-universal in light of the general argument given here, we also expect it to be a necessary ingredient in any microscopic derivation of the anomalous diffusion exponent.\n4 (d) Electron states at Anderson transitions are frequently characterized via the participation number of Bell and Dean, Np[P ] = 1/ \u2211N i=1 p 2 i [36], and the associated dimension dp extracted from Np \u221dLdp . Applying this to our data we obtained dp = 1.305(2). Although not an effective counting scheme, Np satisfies all required axioms except additivity [21]. Its comparison to N? thus tests the importance of preserving the measure property. Proceeding as in the case of effective counting schemes, we define the probability Pp within the \u201csupport\u201d Sp based on Np. These probabilities exhibit larger fluctuations at criticality than P? and are shown in Fig. 2. In a striking difference to the additive case, \u3008 Pp[P (L)] \u3009 decreases with increasing L and may converge to zero in L\u2192\u221e limit. Hence, the relevance of Sp as a descriptor of space in which the physics of Anderson critical electron takes place is rather limited. (e) Multifractal formalism (see e.g. [26, 37]) is also frequently used in analyses of Anderson criticality. Conceived in the context of turbulence and strange attractors, it describes local singularities of associated complex measures in a statistical manner. The original UV form of multifractality has been adopted for Anderson criticality [17\u201320] via replacement a \u2192 \u03bb = 1/L (or `/L with coarse-grained scale `), and scaling for \u03bb\u2192 0. In physics terms, release of UV cutoff (a\u21920) is replaced by that of IR cutoff (L\u2192\u221e). Very recently, Ref. [38] proposed the formula for average N? in terms of multifractal parameters obtained by the moment method. Its reliability and impact has been questioned in Ref. [39].\nP.M. was supported by Slovak Grant Agency VEGA, Project n. 1/0101/20. We thank Robert Mendris for useful comments.\n\u2217 ihorv2@g.uky.edu \u2020 peter.markos@fmph.uniba.sk\n[1] P. W.
