Our results highlight cavity-enhanced extinction spectroscopy as efficient means for the detection of optical transitions in nanoscale thin films with weak absorption, applicable to a broad range of materials.

Moreover, the absorption can be recorded in a quantitative manner and therefore be directly compared with theoretical predictions. Here, we demonstrate and leverage these advantages to directly measure and image the sub-gap absorption of sulfur vacancy defects in monolayer MoS2. By introducing defect sites in a controlled way using focused helium ion beams,19,20 we are able to locally resolve the impact of different defect densities on the sub-gap absorption with a detection limit down to 0.01% extinction. Hyperspectral scans reveal a broadband absorption spectrum due to the induced vacancy defects, which is consistent with the theoretically pre-\ndicted continuum of localized defect excitons.2 Figure 1a depicts schematically the sample geom-\netry and the process of defect generation. Monolayer MoS2 is encapsulated between thin multilayer hBN. Subsequently, defects in the MoS2 monolayer are generated by using a helium ion microscope (HIM).21 The He-ion beam predominantly induces atomic sulfur vacancies.20,22 These sulfur vacancies have been shown to act as single photon emission centers with a characteristic low-temperature defect photoluminescence (PL) at approximately 1.75eV.19,23 In order to probe the room temperature optical absorption of the defective MoS2, we integrate the heterostructure into a fiber-based plane-concave scanning cavity microscope (a prototype of Qlibri GmbH) as shown\nin Figure 1b. A distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) on a plane quartz substrate is combined with a concave DBR micro-fabricated onto the end facet of a tapered single-mode fiber forming the active volume of a high-finesse microcavity.15,17,18 The mirrors consist of alternating dielectric layers, with SiO2 as the topmost layer. For the present study, the properties of the mirrors were chosen to yield a broadband cavity with an approximate finesse of 20000 (Supporting Information, Figure S1) in the spectral range between 1.55 eV (800 nm) and 1.77 eV (700 nm) to match the expected absorption energy of the sulfur defects at room temperature.21 The concave geometry of the micro-mirror laterally confines the cavity mode to a spot size with a radius of approximately 1.2\u00b5m (at half width at half maximum). The cavity is excited via the single-mode fiber using a tunable light source. A specific cavity length is selected by adjusting the distance between the fiber and the mirror with piezo-electric transducers. During measurement, the cavity length is tuned over a fraction of a free spectral range, i.e. the separation between two subsequent cavity modes, and when coming into resonance with the introduced light, the transmission is detected. In a simple picture, this approach enhances very weak absorbance features into a measurable quantity by the multiple round trips of the resonant probe light in the cavity. By scanning the fiber parallel to the plane of the mirror and detecting the transmission through the cavity for a fixed probe energy (wavelength), the extinction, which includes both scattering and absorption of the light in the heterostructure, is mapped out spatially. A complete hyperspectral extinction map is obtained by acquiring such extinction images at different wavelengths. Figure 1c shows an optical microscope image of the hBN/MoS2/hBN heterostructure integrated into the cavity. The heterostructure was first prepared and then transferred onto the plane cavity mirror by a polycarbonate (PC)-based dry stamping process (for details, see Supporting Information).24\nIn order to systematically study the impact of defect density on the optical absorption, we treated the MoS2 heterostructure with different ion doses (0.5 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2, 1 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2 and 5 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2). Figure 2a displays character-\nistic room temperature PL spectra (cw-excitation, Eph = 2.33eV, Plaser = 50\u00b5W, NA = 0.9) for each ion dose. The spectrum comprises mainly emission from the neutral exciton X0 (grey dotted line) and the trion X\u2212 (grey dashed line), whose intensities decrease with increasing the ion irradiation dose. The broad background peak (dash-dotted line) can be attributed to a weak PL from the dielectric substrate. The overall decrease of PL intensity is consistent with non-radiative recombination channels due to the ion-induced generation of defect states.25 Figure 2b shows a confocal PL intensity map (room temperature, spectral range 1.83 eV to 1.92 eV) of the heterostructure after ion irradiation. The exposure pattern (black dashed line) was placed into a homogeneous area with high-quality interfaces (cf. Figure 1c) as identified by PL and atomic force microscopy (Supporting Information, Figures S2 and S3). The microscale exposure pattern consists of a circular field (bottom, 5 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2, labelled 5), a square field (right, 1 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2, labelled 1), another square field (left, 0.5 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2, labelled 0.5), and an unexposed control field (top). The pattern was repeated across the sample. The exposure patterns are clearly visible in the PL image due to the reduced free exciton emission in agreement with Figure 2a. Figure 2c depicts averaged low temperature spectra from each dose field of the irradiation pattern. The PL spectrum (cw-excitation, Eph = 2.54eV, Plaser = 5\u00b5W, NA = 0.42) additionally exhibits a defect peak XD centered at 1.75 eV from unpassivated sulfur vacancies in agreement with previous studies20,25 with a clear correlation between dose and defect emission intensity. Based on the experimentally determined sputtering yield for sulfur vacancies of 0.02,22 we can estimate the generated defect density to be in the range of 1011 vacancies/cm2 to 2 \u00b7 1012 vacancies/cm2 for the used doses. This constitutes a high density regime, where only a broad defect ensemble peak instead of sharp single defect lines can be observed.19 Figure 2d shows a corresponding confocal PL image integrated over a spectral window (1.66 eV - 1.8 eV) comprising the central defect emission energy. The fields with the highest doses in the irradiation pattern can be identified by an increased number of\nbright emission spots. Some of these bright spots correlate with interface inhomogeneities visible in atomic force microscopy. In 2D semiconductors, structural inhomogeneities, e.g. nanoscale bubbles, locally modify the potential landscape, e.g. via strain fields.26,27 The resulting local potential minima can funnel excitons into regions with enhanced defect emission, explaining the more localized defect emission at low temperatures. Previous studies demonstrated that by carefully tuning the experimental parameters, such as exposure dose and area, single defect, and thereby single photon emitters, can be deterministically created in monolayer MoS2 and even contacted heterostructures to allow electronic switching of the quantum emission.19,23,28 Further studies have generalized this approach to electron beam induced emitters as well as to other van der Waals materials, including WSe2 29 and hBN, whereby the latter is promising for room temperature applications.30,31 In order to correlate the sub-gap emission to the absorption properties of the induced defects, room temperature extinction scans before (Figure 3a) and after (Figure 3b) irradiation were recorded in the cavity-based microscope using illumination with a probe energy of 1.746 eV (710 nm). Generating the scans benefited from a rather short measurement time of approximately one minute, enabling a rapid sample characterisation. Sample specific calibration factors, e.g. the effect of the hBN layers on the position of the maximum of the incoming field, are accounted for in the results (Supporting Information, Figure S5). Before irradiation, the extinction scan shows a spatially homogeneous signal between 0.05% to 0.1% across the heterostructure area (Figure 3a). We find strong extinction values at the edges of the encapsulating hBN and along a crack (Supporting Information, Figure S2) in the MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to increased scattering at structural discontinuities of the heterostructure. After irradiation, the exposure pattern becomes visible in the extinction contrast (Figure 3b). Note that the strong, localized extinction feature in the field labelled 1 may result from an unintentional structural defect, e.g. laser damage. A similar localized extinction feature is also detected for lower probe energies in the irradiated field labelled 5 (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The\naffected parts of the irradiated fields are therefore excluded from the following analysis. Figure 3c displays a line cut across the different fields along the path highlighted in Figure 3b of the measured extinction (dashed) and the extinction caused solely by the defects (solid). The latter is obtained by subtracting the average extinction in the unexposed reference field. The extinction values increase systematically as the irradiation dose increases, and we can reliably resolve extinction down to 0.01%. The residual noise stems from the imperfect cavity mirrors and the sample inhomogeneity. In the flat and structurally homogeneous areas of the heterostructure, where scattering is negligible, the signal can be interpreted in terms of a sub-gap absorption due to in-gap defect states of ion-induced sulfur vacancies.2,20,32\nFigure 3d depicts the extinction spectra for the different fields in the exposure pattern. To this end, a series of spatial maps was recorded at different probe energies (Supporting Information, Figure S4), and the average extinction spectrum in each dose field was extracted. Additionally, to ensure that the spectra are not impacted by the use of a specific mode order (determined by the chosen cavity length), the signal was averaged over several cavity lengths in the range between 5\u00b5m to 7\u00b5m. The data points denote the corresponding mean values, while the shaded areas denote the standard deviation. All spectra show the extinction caused solely by the defects.\nFor the exposure fields with doses 1 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2 and 5 \u00b7 1013 ions/cm2, a plateau of increased extinction can be observed below approximately 1.65 eV. For larger energies, we find a consistent rise in extinction. Importantly, the ratio between the two spectra is constant around a value of 5 (see inset of Figure 3d), which matches exactly the ratio of the corresponding ion doses. In other words, the change in extinction matches the expected change in ion-induced defect density. Therefore, the spectral shape can be directly interpreted as the absorption spectrum of the defects. For sulfur vacancies, excitonic many-body calculations predict a continuum of sub-gap states in absorption with the lowest state approximately at around 600 meV below the neutral exciton energy.20 This is consistent with our observation of an enhanced extinction down to at least 300 meV\nbelow the neutral exciton energy, whereby the latter is limited by the stop-band of the used cavity mirrors. Generally, a direct comparison between defect absorption and defect emission spectra remains challenging. The emission occurs only at low temperatures, since at room temperature interactions with phonons quench the defect PL.21 By contrast, the cavity absorption measurements are currently still limited to room temperature, where the neutral exciton is red-shifted by approximately 50 meV and where a similar red-shift can be expected for the defect transitions.25 Lastly, we quantitatively compare our experimental results to ab-initio predictions for the absorbance of sulfur vacancies in monolayer MoS2. Based on the experimentally determined sputtering yield of 0.02 vacancies per ion from ref.22 , our highest ion dose translates into a defect density of 1012 cm\u22122 or equivalently a sulfur deficiency of 0.043%. Calculations at a sulfur deficiency of 2% yield a defectinduced absorbance of approximately 1%.33 By linearly extrapolating the calculated value down to the defect density in our experiments, we arrive at an expected absorption of 0.022%, which is in the same order of magnitude as the experimental value of 0.042%. In summary, we have shown the potential of open scanning cavities for the spectroscopy of the vanishingly small sub-gap absorption of 2D nanomaterials that is inaccessible with conventional methods. Specifically, we demonstrated spectrallyresolved cavity-enhanced extinction microscopy on vacancy defects in a MoS2 monolayer with a spatial resolution of approximately 2.4\u00b5m. In contrast to modulation based reflectance (or absorbance) measurements,4 cavity-enhanced extinction microscopy yields quantitative and absolute absorption values that may be directly compared to theoretical calculations. Our measured absorption quantitatively confirms theoretical predictions to within a factor of two. The open cavity design of the microscope, where the sample can simply be transferred onto the planar cavity mirror, is ideally suited for the study of 2D materials and layered materials in general. Furthermore, absorption spectroscopy can generally access a wider range of electronic states compared to emission spectroscopy where often only a single dominant decay channel is detected. Specifically for the\ncase of quantum emitters in 2D semiconductors, the optical emission process is observable only at cryogenic temperatures, whereas we demonstrate direct detection of the defect absorbance even at room temperature. Ongoing and future experimental developments include extending the measurement capabilities to cryogenic temperatures to generate a complete picture of the absorption of nanomaterials or defects within them as well as to study the strong-coupling regime in photonic nanosystems.\nAcknowledgement The work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Priority Programme SPP 2244 2DMP, the Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology No. (MCQST)EXC-2111-390814868, e-conversion\u2013EXC No. 2089/1-390776260, the Munich Quantum Valley K6, which is supported by the Bavarian state government with funds from the Hightech Agenda Bayern Plus, the One Munich Strategy Forum \u2013 EQAP and the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz (BMWK, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action) and Europ\u00e4ischer Sozialfonds (ESF, European Social Fund) within an EXIST Transfer of Research (Qlibri, Grant No. 03EFPBY231).

The constituent crystals were first ex-\nfoliated using scotch-tape (hBN1) and viscoelastic dry stamping (MoS2 2) onto SiO2 substrates.\nSuitable crystals were identified by means of their optical contrast. A hBN thickness of 10 nm to\n20 nm was used in this work. After the initial exfoliation, the heterostructure was assembled by a\npolycarbonate (PC)-based stamping/pick-up process.3 Finally, the heterostructure was laminated\nonto the plane cavity mirror at 220 \u00b0C and the residual polymer was dissolved in chloroform. This\nfabrication method removed possible contaminants between the layers and created smooth and\nclean interfaces on a scale of several micrometers. Atomic force microscopy (tapping mode) as\nshown in Figure S2 confirms large area clean interfaces. Additionally, the homogeneous PL signal\nfor the neutral exciton at room temperature (Figure S3 (a)) as well as low temperature (Figure. S3\n(b)) confirms a high interface quality.\nDefect generation by He-ion irradiation. Atomic defects in the encapsulated MoS2 het-\nerostructure were created by focused He-ion irradiation. A Zeiss Orion Nanofab He-ion micro-\nscope was used to expose the sample with a beam energy of 30 keV and a low beam current of\n\u2248 0.1 pA. The step size between adjacent beam spots was 5nm. The dwell time was adjusted to\ngenerate exposure doses of 0.5\u00d71013 ions/cm2, 1\u00d71013 ions/cm2, and 5\u00d71013 ions/cm2.\nRoom temperature PL measurements. Room temperature photoluminescence measurements\nwere implemented with a Eph = 2.33eV (532nm) cw-probe laser coupled into a commercial con-\nfocal microscope (WITec Alpha 300 R) using a 100x (0.9 NA) objective and a 300 g/mm grating.\nLow power excitation (Plaser = 50\u00b5W) allowed measurements in ambient conditions without ap-\nparent beam damage.\nLow temperature PL measurements. Low temperature photoluminescence measurements\nwere performed using a He-flow cryostat with a base pressure of approximately 10\u22126 mbar and\nwith bath temperature of approximately 10 K. The cw-probe energy was Eph = 2.54eV (488nm)\nat a power of Plaser = 5\u00b5W through a 50x (0.42 NA) objective. The signal was collected through the\nsame objective and reflection geometry, and were analysed with a dispersive spectrometer (163 mm\nfocal length, 500 g/mm grating) and a cooled CCD.\nCavity-enhanced extinction measurements. All shown cavity-enhanced extinction measure-\nments were carried out at room temperature. The cavity length was kept between 5\u00b5m and 7\u00b5m,\nthe probe energy (wavelength) provided by a tunable light source was varied between 1.55 eV and\n1.77 eV (702nm to 798nm). Simulations of the cavity mirrors and measurements show a finesse\nof approximately 20000 (Figure S1). The normalised transmission is obtained by forming the ratio\nof the detected transmission at the sample and at a sample-free region of the planar mirror. The\ndetected values of transmission through a sample-free region of the cavity were in the range of\n0.1\u00b5W - 2\u00b5W. Taking into account the number of round trips of light in the cavity (finesse F ) the\nextinction of a sample can be inferred from the normalised transmission. Further details, such as\nthe non-linearity of the detectors, the varying background level and the effect of the thickness and\nrefractive index of the sample hBN layers on the field amplitude at the defect region (see Figure S5\n(a-c)) were calibrated and incorporated to determine the values of extinction to the best of knowl-\nedge. By scanning the fiber relatively to the sample, a two-dimensional map of the extinction can\nbe generated. Varying the probe energy (wavelength) while changing the cavity length to keep the\ncavity on resonance can thus result in hyperspectral maps of the extinction. Such maps are shown\nin Figure S4 (a-f) with an increasing probe energy for a) to f). Apart from the defect pattern, two\nlocalized extinction features in the fields labelled 1 and 5 are visible. The intensity of these extinc-\ntion features change with probe energy and are assumed to result from unintentional defects of the\nstructure by e.g. laser damage. The extinction caused solely by the defects EX (with X correspond-\ning to the different irradiation doses) can be deduced by subtracting the extinction measured for\nthe non-irradiated heterostructure Earea0 from the extinction measured on the irradiated heterostruc-\nture EareaX: EX = EareaX\u2212Earea0. In order to investigate the performance of the scanning cavity\nabsorption microscope, analogous measurements were repeated at different sample positions and\nat different times. Figure S6 (a) shows the temporal repeatability of the extinction measurements.\nThe extinction spectrum recorded for the heterostructure before ion irradiation is in good agree-\nment with the spectrum recorded after the process of ion irradiation while still on a non-irradiated\narea. The two grey lines, recorded shortly after each other, show an excellent overlay. Figure S6 (b)\ndepicts the spatial repeatability of the spectral extinction measurements. The two shown spectra\nwere recorded at two different areas, both irradiated by the dose of 5\u00d71013 ions/cm2, indicating a\ngood agreement."

The images in (a)-(f) display representative extinction images recorded at different probe energies. The extinction spectra presented in the main manuscript were generated from an aligned set of such images.\nFigure S5: Effect of the sample layer on the field intensity. (a) Refractive indices close to the mirror surface (0 \u00b5m) and the corresponding field intensity. (b) Refractive indices with added hBN layers of the sample. The altered field intensitiy is shown. (c) Comparison of the resulting field intensity at the mirror surface without the sample hBN layers (dashed line) and within the sample layer (solid line) for wavelengths 700nm to 800nm.\n1.60 1.65 1.70 1.75 Energy (eV)\n0.00\n0.05 0.10 Ex tin ct io n (% ) (a) Measurement time before irradiation after irradiation, first scan after irradiation, second scan\n1.60 1.65 1.70 1.75 Energy (eV)\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nEx tin\nct io\nn (%\n)\n(b)\nDose (ions/cm2) / pattern number 5 \u22c5 1013, p1 5 \u22c5 1013, p2\nFigure S6: Repeatability of hyperspectral extinction measurements. (a) Temporal repeatability. Extinction spectra of the heterostructure recorded before the irradiation process (solid black line) and in a non-irradiated area of the heterostructure after the irradiation process, thus after sample handling, (grey line) demonstrate good agreement between scans recorded on different days. Extinction spectra of the heterostructure recorded directly after each other (solid grey and dashed grey lines) show excellent agreement. (b) Spatial repeatability. Extinction spectra recorded on different locations of the sample corresponding to the same ion doses show very good agreement. The spectrum labelled p2 corresponds to the pattern shown in the main manuscript."
