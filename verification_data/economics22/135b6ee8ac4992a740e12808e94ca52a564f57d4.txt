"The NIPH data for 2021 and 2022 are not yet available. As a result, the proposal for additional research in an ex-ante health crisis is a prediction that could introduce new viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic was not initially included in the study and pre-effect forecasting during the observed period (2008â€“2018). This was because a new virus had not yet spread throughout the population. However, as this article demonstrates, testing pre-effect predictions can be helpful for policymakers and practitioners. It makes use of historical data."
