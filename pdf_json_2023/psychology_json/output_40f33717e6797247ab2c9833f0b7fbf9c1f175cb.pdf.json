    "abstractText": "Bentonite fining is one of the generally applied wine-making technological elements that may seriously affect wine components. The aim of this study was (i) to investigate the effect of 21 bentonite products on eight oenological parameters, 19 elements, 21 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 10 organoleptic properties of white wine; and (ii) to quantify intercorrelations among the parameters separately for each of the four quality attributes. Among oenological parameters, sugar, acidity, malic-, lactic-, citric acid and total phenol contents were significant among several bentonite products. The amounts of elements were the lowest in the control wine treatments (with exceptions of, e.g., Ni and Cu); and these values were significantly different from several bentonite products. The relative presence of the VOCs was above 100% for most VOCs, but it was below 100% for 1-propanol, 4-amino-1,5-pentandioic acid and butane-dioic acid, and diethyl ester in all treatments. For organoleptic parameters, the values of clearness, colour, flavour intensity and taste persistency was the lowest in the control wine treatment, while the values of flavour character, flavour quality, taste intensity, taste character, and overall harmony were the highest for the bentonite products of AP, EBE, M-SA, EBE, EBE, respectively. Results of correlation and factor analyses showed strong intercorrelative effects of bentonite fining on the four quality attributes. In conclusion, this study can help in the proper choice of a specific bentonite product in relation to complexity effects of",

            "text": "Wine contains numerous compounds, including polyphenols, elemental composition, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (e.g., [1]). Several studies have shown that moderate wine consumption has several positive effects on human health due to, e.g., phenolic compounds [2\u20134]. These compounds in wine can protect human health via anti-microbial, anticancer, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective activities. The phenolic compounds of wine also have a key effect on the oenological parameters of the wine, but the sensory properties (e.g., colour, astringency and bitterness) are also directly influenced by the phenolic composition of the wine (e.g., [5\u20138]). The various chemical constituents of wine are among those most investigated features. Elemental composition directly influences the qualitative characteristics of the wine, such as total acidity, alcohol, dry extract\nFoods 2023, 12, 355. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12020355 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 355 2 of 27\nand residual sugar [9]. Metals among elemental compositions also affect the organoleptic characteristics of wine [10]. In addition, the amount and type of VOCs may be affected by several factors, such as geographical origin, aging, alcoholic and acetic fermentation as well as technological processes [11,12]. The characterization of the volatile fraction helps to improve the quality of the wine product [12]. The bentonite fining of wine has been generally applied in the technology for a long time in order to eliminate thermolabile proteins, which cause haziness in wine [13]. These proteins are positively charged and easily react with the negatively charged particles of bentonite (mainly montmorillonite: Al2O3-4SiO2-H2O). This results in flocculation, followed by sedimentation. In this process, not only are the thermolabile proteins eliminated, but the mineral background and phenolic and volatile constituents also change. This process can be bentonite product-specific and may influence the terroir-character of the wine. Bentonite is one of the most efficient fining agents for reaching protein stability in wine; however, bentonite may influence seriously the quality of wine [14]. Among oenological parameters, previous studies showed various results on bentonite fining. For example, titratable acidity, ethanol, and tartaric acid contents were not different between the bentonite and control treatments. However, malic acid contents were significantly lower in the bentonite treatment compared to the control treatment during wine bottling [15], and in the study of Maslov-Bandic et al. [16] the sugar content was also significantly lower in the bentonite treatments compared to the control. Previous studies showed that elemental compositions of wine were the most affected parameters during bentonite finings. In some cases, bentonite fining increased the amounts of some micro-elements in the wine, such as Na, Al and Ca [10,17\u201320] and Fe, Sr and Ba [21]. However in other cases, previous wine studies demonstrated that Cu, K and Zn contents [22] and also B content [23] decreased in the bentonite treatments compared to the control. The largest decrease was achieved for Cu (\u221243%) [22]. Previous results also showed that different bentonite products may cause various changes in the elemental composition of the wine, as bentonite quality (clearness, activity, absorption capacity and the surface of the particles) is dependent upon the place of origin [23\u201325]. As a consequence, bentonite fining not only influences the elemental composition of the wine but is a main source of mineral contamination too [22,23,26,27]. In the case of the VOCs, Horvat et al. [14] demonstrated that bentonite affected wine quality by changing some key fermentation volatiles compared to treatments without bentonite fining. Bentonite fining may reduce aroma and flavour compounds in the wine due to direct adsorption and deproteinization [28\u201333]. The VOCs loss was verified after multiple treatments in various wine types [32,34]. The results of Sanborn et al. [35] indicated that fining agents can perform unpredictably and may result in various levels of wine quality reductions. Several studies showed that the loss of VOCs in wine after bentonite treatments severely affects the sensory attributes of the wine too [28,29,32\u201334]. Overall, previous studies verified that bentonite fining affects many wine parameters including oenological, elemental, volatile and sensory attributes, but most studies measured only parts of the parameters and only few bentonite products; and therefore, an overall evaluation may help to better characterize the effect of a given bentonite product on wine quality. Correlations among several wine attributes (including elemental, volatile, and sensory parameters) in bentonite treatments were investigated [16,21,36\u201338]. However, intercorrelation among the parameters were not shown in an overall evaluation with different wine attributes and large numbers of bentonite products, which may give a better understanding of the relationship between the bentonite fining process and wine quality changes. The aim of this study was firstly to investigate the effect of twenty-one bentonite products together with three control treatments on eight oenological parameters, nineteen elements, twenty-two VOCs and ten organoleptic properties of white wine that originated from the Eastern Hungarian wine regions (Debrecen, Hajd\u00fa-Bihar county); and secondly to quantify intercorrelations (Pearson correlation, factor analyses) among the parameters\nFoods 2023, 12, 355 3 of 27\nseparately for oenological, elemental, volatile, and organoleptic properties in order to highlight the best relationships of the correlated measures."

The plantation was established in 1998 in the Experimental Horticultural Station, University, Debrecen-Pallag (47\u25e635\u203220\u2032 \u2032/21\u25e638\u203223\u2032 \u2032; 128 m above sea level). Harvest was carried out in late September, 2017. The wine for the experiment was prepared from the three varieties as follows. The harvested grape was cooled down to 12 \u25e6C before processing, then 100 mg/kg potassium metabisulphite was sprinkled into the grapes during the processes of crushing and destemming. Pressing started immediately after destemming, and 2 g/10 L yeast was added a day later (Mycoferm A-R-T, Interker-Wein, Eger, Hungary). Decantation was not applied because the grapes were clean and healthy. After the start of the fermentation process at 20 \u25e6C, the wine must in 11 \u00d7 120-litre plastic casks was transported to a cooling chamber at 12 \u25e6C. The fermentation process ended after three weeks. At the end, to support the completion of sugar degradation, the plastic casks were placed at 15 \u25e6C. Within a week, the wine was racked open with the joint application of sulfitization (50 mg/L, with SO2 solution, Interker-Wein, Eger, Hungary), and the casks were filled up with minimal air lock. The base wine was put together into an IBC plastic container in the middle of December (2017) with open racking and the addition of 30 mg/L supplementary sulfitization. Fining was performed in spring 2018 and then bentonite fining treatments were performed. To perform the treatments, 20 L of wine samples were racked into 30-litre plastic drums, which were fined with medium doses of 18 bentonite products according to producers\u2019 recommendations (Table 1). The experimental design also included three control treatments (C, SC, SMC) in order to represent the complexity of the procedure (Table 1). C treatment contains only the wine sample and did not get any additional amendments. SC treatment contains the wine sample with 10 mg/L sulfitization. Sulfitization was applied to counterbalance the oxidation in the wine. In the SMC treatment, apart from the sulfitization a mixing was applied with the same speed and timing as in the bentonite product treatments (full rotation with 30 s). Assays were carried out in triplicate.\nFoods 2023, 12, 355 4 of 27\nPreparation of bentonite treatments was as follows: each bentonite product was previously hydrated according to the producers\u2019 instructions. Prepared products were mixed into the wine with a drill mixer for 30 s with full rotation besides intensive aeration. After the collapse of the foam (some minutes), the solutions were racked into new glass jugs previously rinsed with hot tap water (measure of capacity: 15 L). Then 10 mg/L sulfitization was applied at racking. Jugs were closed with plastic caps with no headspace over the wine and were put into a cool chamber set to 12 \u25e6C. According to the concept of the trial, wine was left over the bentonite sediment. The wine samples were taken two weeks after bentonite treatments. Dissolved oxygen was measured with a HI 9146 equipment (HANNA Instruments Service Ltd., Szeged, Hungary) before bottling of the wine samples (Table 1)."

Oenological Parameters\nEight oenological parameters (ethyl-alcohol, sugar, total acidity, tartaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, volatile acid and total phenol) of the white wine sample of the twenty-one treatments were determined according to the official standards of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine [33]. Parameters were measured in three replicates. Ethyl-alcohol content was expressed as v/v%.

Elemental Composition\nQuantities of eight macro- and meso elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Al, Na, and B) and eleven micro elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Cd, Ba, and Pb) were determined and expressed in mg/L and \u00b5g/L, respectively, from the white wine samples treated with twenty-one bentonite products, including three control treatments. Elemental composition was determined with ICP OES and ICP MS, similarly to the study of Rakoncz\u00e1s et al. [21]. Briefly the used determination method was the following. Before the analysis, wine samples were diluted ten-fold with 5 (m/V) % nitric acid (VWR International Ltd., Debrecen, Hungary). A deionized water type-1 grade was used by using a Milli-Q\u00ae water purification system (Merck-Millipore, Molsheim, France). Three replicates were analyzed from each sample.

The profile of the VOCs in each wine sample was determined by a Bruker Scion 456-gas chromatograph equipped with a Bruker SHS-40 Headspace Sampler (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The equipment was supplemented with a Bruker SQ mass spectrometer and with a Br-5 capillary column (30 m 0.25 mm i. d. 1.0 \u00b5m film thickness)."

A\nFoods 2023, 12, 355 6 of 27\nsemi-quantitative analysis was performed to identify VOCs. In the analysis, changes in volatile compounds caused by bentonite products were more essential for our study than the exact concentration of volatile compounds. Therefore, the relative presence of VOCs is expressed in the percentage of control (C) treatment.\n2.2.4. Organoleptic Evaluation\nThe organoleptic evaluation of the wine samples in the twenty-one bentonite product treatments was performed according to OIV 332A/2009 resolution. The procedure of organoleptic evaluation of the wine samples was made by a panel of 14 trained students between the ages of 20 and 24 (University Debrecen, Hungary) according to Jackson [39] and Hopfer & Heymann [40]. The panel members took part in a one-semester theoretical and practical course including 3 h theory and 3 \u00d7 4 h thematic wine-tasting occasions: white wine, red wine, technological wines and wines of the world. The environmental, material and personal conditions during the sensory evaluation were created taking into account the MSZ 9462-81 standard. Written consent and ethics approval were arranged for the organoleptic assessments. All evaluations were done independently and in three replicates. Each panel member was asked to evaluate clearness, colour, flavour intensity, flavour character, flavour quality, taste intensity, taste character, taste quality, taste persistency, and overall harmony. The assessment guide, containing a scale for each organoleptic parameter, including the two anchors, was as follows: skin and flesh colour: 0 = unacceptable, 9 = excellent; flavour intensity and character: 0 = very weak, 8 = very strong; flavour quality: 0 = unacceptable and 15 = excellent; taste intensity, character and persistency: 0 = very bad, 8 = excellent; taste quality: 0 = very bad, 20 = excellent and overall harmony: 0 = unacceptable, 10 = excellent."

The LSD t-test was used to separate treatment means at p = 0.05 levels.\n2.3.2. Pearson Correlation Analyses\nThe relationship among the measurements was quantified separately for oenological, elemental, volatile, and organoleptic measure types. In order to quantify relationships among the measurements, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were determined for the relationships of the measures of the four measure types in all combinations (55, 154, 214, and 46 variable pairs for oenological, elemental, volatile, and organoleptic measure types, respectively.

A principal axis procedure was used to calculate factor loadings followed by a Varimax rotation according to the study of Kaiser [41]. Four factors were presented and significant factor loadings were highlighted separately for the four measure types. Biplot diagrams were also prepared to visualise the first two factors (Factor 1 vs. Factor 2) with the distributions of the measure types and bentonite products. The biplot diagrams were performed separately for oenological, elemental, volatile, and organoleptic measure types with the statistical package of R 1.3.30 [42] with the MultBiplotR [43]."

Discussion Our study demonstrated that several oenological parameters, elemental compositions, aroma compounds and organoleptic parameters of white wine were affected by the selected eighteen bentonite products as fining agents. In addition, Pearson correlation and factor analyses demonstrated large numbers of significant intercorrelations among oenological, elemental, volatile, and organoleptic properties.\nOur study confirmed that most of the bentonite products affected most of the oenological parameters of white wine (Table 3). In addition, this study showed that none of the bentonite products differed from the control treatment for the contents of ethyl-alcohol, tartaric acid and volatile acid in the wine samples (Table 3). Our results were confirmed by previous studies [16,37] in the case of ethyl-alcohol and volatile acidity contents, and the obtained values of ethyl-alcohol and volatile acidity contents were in the ranges given by the wine production regulations [44]. In addition, similar ranges of ethyl-alcohol, total acidity and volatile acidity values were reported by other white wine studies [45,46],"

In addition, similar ranges of ethyl-alcohol, total acidity and volatile acidity values were reported by other white wine studies [45,46], where no bentonite fining was applied. Cheng and Watrelot [15] also reported that titratable acidity, ethanol, and tartaric acid contents were not different between the bentonite and\nFoods 2023, 12, 355 23 of 27\ncontrol treatments during wine bottling. However, in contrast with our results, the study of Maslov-Bandic et al. [16] demonstrated that the sugar content of wine samples was significantly lower in the bentonite treatments compared to the control. In addition, different results were also reported by Cheng and Watrelot [15], who showed that malic acid contents were significantly lower in the bentonite treatment compared to the control treatment during wine bottling. The different results of previous studies from this study may be due to the fact that various bentonite products, various geographical origins of grape productions, various grape cultivars and/or various analytical methods were used in previous bentonite fining studies. Although various bentonite products can cause differences in oenological parameters, this bentonite fining study showed that the relationships are strong among most of the oenological parameters independently on bentonite products (18 pairs out of 55 ones were significant in correlation analyses and seven parameters out of 10 showed strong significant correlations for Factor 1, Tables 7 and 8). This clearly indicates that various bentonite products not only change single oenological parameters but that strong intercorrelative changes can be expected among the parameters (e.g., among sugar, acidity malic acid, citric acid, volatile acid and total phenol) if we apply bentonite finings. Similar to several previous studies, results of this work showed that bentonite fining affects the amounts of macro- and micro-elements (Tables 4 and 5). The bentonite products, applied in the wine samples, caused changes in the amounts of Al, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni and Pb in this study (Tables 4 and 5), which were in agreement with several previous studies [23,27,46\u201353]. Bentonite fining of wine increased the amounts of Na, Al and Ca in previous studies (e.g., [10,17\u201320]), which corresponded well to results of this study. In addition, Fe, Sr and Ba contents were also shown to increase in red wine samples by bentonite fining [21], which was also confirmed by this study in white wine samples. Previous wine studies showed that Cu, K and Zn contents [22] and also B content [23] decreased in the bentonite treatments compared to the control. The decrease of K and Zn contents by bentonite fining was not confirmed by this study, as most bentonite products caused a significant increase of K and Zn contents in the white wine samples (Tables 4 and 5). In addition, the decrease of B content by bentonite fining was not in line with this study, as similar B quantities were measured in both the bentonite-treated and nontreated white wine samples (Table 4). The largest decrease was achieved for Cu (\u221243%) in the study of Nicolini et al. [22], which was confirmed by this study for the bentonite products of NCPE and GPT (Table 5). The different results of previous studies from this study may be due to the fact that various concentrations of bentonite products are applied and/or the used bentonite products contained various amounts of mineral composition, which contaminated differently the treated white samples. In addition, this bentonite fining study showed that the relationships among elements are clustered in Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 (e.g., in Factor 1, B, Ca, K, Mg and P or in Factor 3, Co, Ni, Fe, Cr and Na, Table 10). This suggests that various bentonite products can cause intercorrelative changes among attached elemental groups in various level if bentonite fining is applied. This study showed that bentonite fining significantly decreased the amounts of several VOCs in white wine samples compared to the control treatment but that the level of decrease was dependent on the types of VOCs and bentonite products (Table ??). On the other hand, bentonite fining was able to increase significantly several VOCs depending on the types of bentonite products (Table ??). The recent study of Horvat et al. [14] also demonstrated that bentonite negatively affected wine quality by changing some key fermentation volatiles compared to treatments without bentonite fining. Some previous studies showed that bentonite fining may reduce aroma and flavour compounds in the wine due to direct adsorption and deproteinization [28\u201333]. The aroma loss was verified after multiple treatments in various wine types [32,34]. Lira et al. [37] showed that the possible loss of volatile compounds may be due to adsorption on bentonite. The results of Sanborn et al. [35] also indicated that fining agents can perform unpredictably and may result in various levels of wine-quality reductions [35]. This phenomenon was supposed to be due to the fact that bentonite can connect with volatile components by chemical\nFoods 2023, 12, 355 24 of 27\nbindings such as van der Waals or hydrogen bonds [32,54\u201356]. In addition, this study showed that intercorrelations among many VOCs are strong already in the Factor 1, which accounted for a large amounts of variance (Table 12, Figure 3). This phenomenon indicates that bentonite fining has a strong influence on most of the VOCs independently of the type of the bentonite products used. Several studies showed that the loss of aroma compounds in wine after bentonite treatments severely affects the sensory attributes of the wine too [28,29,32\u201334]. In this study, the organoleptic parameters were variously affected by bentonite fining compared to the control treatment; for example, organoleptic parameters were not affected (e.g., EBS vs. all organoleptic parameters), or were significantly decreased (e.g., EBE vs. flavour intensity) or significantly increased (e.g., EBE vs. colour) by various bentonite products (Table 6). The various effects could be explained by the various origins of bentonite products which differently affected the taste parameters due to their various mineral compositions. In addition, this study also showed that some flavour and taste parameters are well attached to each other, for example in Factor 1 (Table 14). This phenomenon was true in the overall intercorrelation analyses of all bentonite products, which indicates that organoleptic parameters are highly affected by bentonite finings. These influences are strongly connected to the changes of quality compositions of the wine, which was due to the used bentonite product."

            "text": "This study clearly showed that oenological parameters, elemental compositions, aroma compounds and organoleptic parameters of the white wine samples were affected variously by the selected eighteen bentonite products as fining agents. In addition, analyses of intercorrelations showed a large number of significant intercorrelations among individual properties of oenological, elemental, volatile, and organoleptic attributes. Bentonite fining will affect several wine-quality attributes (such oenological, elemental, volatile and organoleptic) alone and also in association with each other, which should be considered when we select a bentonite product for fining. This suggests that the right choice of bentonite products is essential (e.g., in relation to type of wine, inner content of wine, geographical origin) but that complex and intercorrelative effects of bentonite fining on all quality attributes of the wine can be expected, whatever products are used for bentonite fining. It is complicated to select one product which is generally suitable for bentonite fining. In our specific case, the AP treatment seemed to be the most suitable for bentonite fining of our white wine samples. However, this study also demonstrated that several bentonite products are suitable for good fine toning of the wine according to the quality attributes of the wine or in the practice of organoleptic evaluations. It needs to be emphasized that all these phenomenon cannot be simply deduced from the direct changes of elemental and/or direct or indirect change of volatile compositions and that the complexity of the changes always has to be taken into consideration.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.R., Z.K. and I.J.H.; methodology, N.R., Z.K., B.K. and I.J.H.; software, S.S.; I.J.H.; validation, I.J.H.; formal analysis, I.J.H., S.S., G.A.; investigation, N.R. and I.J.H.; resources, I.J.H.; data curation, N.R. and I.J.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.R. and I.J.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.J.H.; visualization, I.J.H.; supervision, I.J.H.; project administration, N.R. and I.J.H.; funding acquisition, I.J.H.
