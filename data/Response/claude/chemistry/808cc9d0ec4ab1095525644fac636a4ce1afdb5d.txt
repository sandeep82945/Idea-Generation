 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further optimize biogenic thiosulfate production by exploring different microbial strains, electron acceptors, reactor configurations, etc. to maximize thiosulfate yields. This could improve the efficiency and sustainability of the overall PGM recovery process. 

2. Test the biogenic thiosulfate leaching approach on real spent automotive catalysts. The paper used a synthetic Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, but evaluating performance on real-world samples would be beneficial.

3. Expand the biogenic thiosulfate leaching method to recover other PGMs like platinum, rhodium, etc. from spent catalysts. The paper focused only on palladium recovery.

4. Conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing biogenic thiosulfate leaching to conventional chemical leaching methods. This could further demonstrate the economic viability of the bio-based approach.

5. Develop continuous flow systems for both biogenic thiosulfate production and PGM leaching to improve process efficiency and scalability. The current study used batch reactors.
