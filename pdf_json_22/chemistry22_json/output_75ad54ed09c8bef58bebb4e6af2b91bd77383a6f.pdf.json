    "abstractText": "Backbone dihedral angles \u03c6 and \u03c8 are the main structural descriptors of proteins and peptides. The distribution of these angles has been investigated over decades as they are essential for the validation and refinement of experimental measurements, as well as for structure prediction and design methods. The dependence of these distributions, not only on the nature of each amino acid but also on that of the closest neighbors, has been the subject of numerous studies. Although neighbor-dependent distributions are nowadays generally accepted as a good model, there is still some controversy about the combined effects of left and right neighbors. We have investigated this question using rigorous methods based on recently-developed statistical techniques. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the influence of left and right neighbors cannot be considered independently. Consequently, three-residue fragments should be considered as the minimal building blocks to investigate polypeptide sequence-structure relationships.",

The dependence of these distributions, not only on the nature of each amino acid but also on that of the closest neighbors, has been the subject of numerous studies. Although neighbor-dependent distributions are nowadays generally accepted as a good model, there is still some controversy about the combined effects of left and right neighbors.

            "text": "Proteins and peptides are essential molecules in all living organisms. Their numerous functions are closely related to their structural and dynamic properties. The main variables to investigate these properties are the backbone \u03d5 and \u03c8 dihedral angles of each of the amino acid residues along the sequence (Bra\u0308nde\u0301n5\nand Tooze, 1998; Liljas et al., 2009) (see Figure 1 for an illustration). The allowed values of this pair of angles and its statistical distribution have been studied over half a century, since the seminal work by (Ramachandran et al., 1963; Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968). Several applications have motivated the detailed analysis of \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles in polypeptide chains, such as10\nthe validation and refinement of structures determined from biophysical techniques (Morris et al., 1992; Lovell et al., 2003) and the development of models or scoring functions for protein structure prediction and design (Gibrat et al., 1991; Kang et al., 1993; Betancourt and Skolnick, 2004; Boomsma et al., 2008; Rata et al., 2010; Ting et al., 2010). The study of local structural preferences of15\npolypeptides is also essential for the investigation of denatured states of globular proteins (Smith et al., 1996b; Jha et al., 2005a) and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (Shen et al., 2018; Estan\u0303a et al., 2019).\nEach amino acid type has a particular distribution of the \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles\n(Swindells et al., 1995; Serrano, 1995; Deane et al., 1999; Hovmo\u0308ller et al., 2002;20\nAnderson et al., 2005). These distributions are relatively similar for all natural amino acids, with the exception of glycine and proline. While glycine lacks a side chain, thus providing enhanced conformational variability, proline has a cyclic side chain, which severely restricts the accessible \u03d5 and \u03c8 values (Ho and Brasseur, 2005). Some early work assumed that the distribution depends only25\non the amino acid type, independently of the context, which is usually referred to as Flory\u2019s isolated-pair hypothesis (Flory, 1969; Zimmerman et al., 1977). Despite its simplicity, Flory\u2019s isolated-pair hypothesis has been very useful to interpret Small Angle Scattering data reporting on the overall size of disordered and denatured proteins (Kohn et al., 2004). However, the availability of30\n\u03b1\nresidue i\u22121\nN C\nO\nN C\nO\nN\nO\nC\nC C\u03b1 \u03b1\nRR\nresidue i+1i residue\nR\n\u03c8 C \u03d5\na)\nresidue-specific information provided my Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements, such as residual/scalar couplings and chemical shifts, evidenced that the conformational preferences of individual amino acid residues is influenced by their nearest neighbors (Braun et al., 1994; Penkett et al., 1997). A wide variety of short peptides have been used in order to rationalize and quan-35\ntify the effects exerted by the nearest neighbors (Dames et al., 2006; Oh et al., 2012a,b; Jung et al., 2014; Toal et al., 2015; Schweitzer-Stenner and Toal, 2018). The ensemble of these studies identified aromatic and \u03b2-branched amino acids as having the strongest influence on the structure of their neighbors due to their steric hindrance (Penkett et al., 1997; Jung et al., 2014), although the role of sol-40\nvation has been also pointed out by some authors (Avbelj and Baldwin, 2004). Nearest neighbor effects were found particularly significant in several cases of repeated amino acids along the sequence (Milorey et al., 2021b,a).\nVarious theoretical/computational approaches, building on experimentally-\ndetermined protein structures, have also been developed to investigate sequence-45\ndependent structural preferences and to integrate them within predictive methods (Kabat and Wu, 1973; Gibrat et al., 1987; Betancourt and Skolnick, 2004; Boomsma et al., 2008; Rata et al., 2010; Ting et al., 2010). In addition, the inability of simple single-residue-based coil models to recapitulate NMR data supports the influence of the sequence context in defining conformational en-50\nsembles of disordered and denatured proteins (Smith et al., 1996a; Pappu et al., 2000; Jha et al., 2005a,b; Bernado\u0301 et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2013; Estan\u0303a et al., 2019). Finally mention that molecular dynamics simulations of simple tripeptides showed that the nearest neighbors influence the relative population between the regions of the Ramachandran space and the transitions rates between55\nthem (Zaman et al., 2003). Overall, these experimental and computational studies provide strong evidence for the effect of the nearest neighbors in defining the conformational preferences of a given amino acid residue. However, from a statistical perspective, no inference method (i.e., hypothesis testing methods, as described below) has yet been applied to formally test Flory\u2019s isolated pair60\nhypothesis.\nAn additional question arises when investigating nearest neighbor dependence: is the influence of left and right neighbors interdependent? This is an important issue as it determines whether the influence exerted by both neighbors can be studied separately. Contradictory answers have been given to this ques-65\ntion. For instance, Griffiths-Jones et al. (1998) postulated that electrostatic interactions between the left and right neighbors significantly affect the conformation of the central residue. Betancourt and Skolnick (2004) directly considered three-residue fragments for the analysis of neighbor dependence, thus implicitly assuming that left and right neighbors cannot be dissociated for this analysis.70\nResults by Huang et al. (2013) also suggested that left and right residues have to be simultaneously taken into account in order to appropriately estimate NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) measured in IDPs. Conversely, independence of adjacent residues has been asserted by other authors, although only descriptive or statistically vague methods have been applied in this regard. Rata et al.75\n(2010) stated independence after visual comparison of two density estimations,\nand Shen et al. (2018) based their analysis on an amino acid clustering approach, valid only under the independence hypothesis.\nWe have implemented statistical hypothesis testing methods (Lehmann and\nRomano, 2005) to investigate the interdependence between nearest neighbor80\neffects on backbone dihedral angles. These statistical tests make it possible to: (i) reject Flory\u2019s isolated-pair hypothesis by finding significant differences between dihedral angle distributions when both neighbors are or not taken into account (Section 2.1), and (ii) prove the interdependence of neighbor effects, which is the main contribution of this work, by assessing the independence of two85\ncategorical variables (Sections 2.2-2.4). Details on the implemented statistical tests are provided in Section 4.2.\nData for our analyses were extracted from a non-redundant set of experimentally-determined high-resolution protein structures. We constructed two datasets from three-residue fragments (called tripeptides from now on) de-90\npending on the structural context: considering all tripeptides in all structures, and considering only fragments from coil regions (i.e. tripeptides not contained in \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-strands). In the following, we will refer to these datasets as All and Coil, respectively. We would like to clarify here that although it is well known that statistical models to investigate disordered or unfolded proteins are95\nin general more accurate when they are built from restricted structural datasets that do not contain secondary structure elements (Swindells et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1996a; Jha et al., 2005a), we decided to perform the statistical tests for restricted and unrestricted datasets with the aim of analyzing differences.\nDetails about the tripeptide datasets are provided in Section 4.1.100\nThe software and the data used in this work are freely available (see detail\nin section \u201cSoftware and data availability\u201d at the end of the manuscript)."

To do this, we per-105\nformed a recently-developed two-sample goodness-of-fit test (Gonza\u0301lez-Delgado et al., 2021), defined to assess the equality of two probability distributions supported on the two-dimensional flat torus (which is the space corresponding to two angles, \u03d5 and \u03c8). This test is based on the Wasserstein distance, which is a suitable metric to compare distributions on non-euclidean spaces (Villani,110\n2008). Details about the method are provided in Section 4.2.1. We found highly significant differences (at significance level \u03b1 = 0.05) between dihedral angle distributions when both neighbors are or are not taken into account. Results are represented through p-values, which quantify the plausibility of the observed data assuming that Flory\u2019s hypothesis is true. Hence, small p-values provide115\nstrong quantitative evidence against this hypothesis. Results were consistent for the All and Coil datasets, and similar for all amino acid types, including glycine and proline. This is shown in Table 1, where a p-value is presented for each central amino acid type. Note that p-values for the All and Coil datasets should not be compared, because in general rejection strength is higher when120\nmore information is available (as in the All dataset). However, within-dataset p-value comparisons are reasonable, since the sample sizes are comparable. For instance, for the All database, the effect of neighbors on the (\u03d5, \u03c8) distribution is higher for alanine than for asparagine. Overall, these analyses represent statistically strong evidence to reject Flory\u2019s isolated-pair hypothesis and con-125\nfirm the results of many previous studies mentioned in Section 1 that show the importance of nearest neighbor effects."

            "text": "tude of the interdependence\nWe assessed whether properties such as the polarity and the size of the\nneighbors affect the strength of the interdependence. Note that some previous155\nstudies on nearest neighbor effects (not dealing with interdependence) divided amino acid types into only two classes (Penkett et al., 1997): those involving aromatic and beta-branched side chains (FHITVWY) and the others, with the exception of glycine and proline. The large size of our databases enabled a finer classification. Consequently, we chose six representative amino acids for each of160\nthe following groups:\n\u2022 Polar (P): Arg, Lys, Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln.\n\u2022 Hydrophobic (H): Ala, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Val.\n\u2022 Small (S): Ala, Ser, Thr, Asp, Asn, Cys.\n\u2022 Large (L): Phe, Tyr, Trp, Arg, Ile, Lys.165\nTo facilitate the comparison between these categories, we defined a score measuring the strength of the interdependence effect for a given neighbor setting (a fixed group for the left residue and one for the right residue). This score corresponds to the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the empirical cumulative distribution function of p-values (see Section 4.2.3 for details). When comparing170\ntwo different neighbors settings, a higher AUC means p-values being closer to zero and thus a higher interdependence.\nFigure 2 shows radar plots with AUC values for possible combinations of neighbors depending on their polarity (left plot) and size (right plot), and averaged for all amino acid types at the central position. General trends can be175\nobserved from this representation: (i) Interdependence is stronger when both\nneighbors are polar. This can be justified by the presence of attractive or repulsive electrostatic interactions between them, which may constrain the conformational space for the central residue, and that strongly depend on the specific pair of neighbors (Milorey et al., 2021b). Adjacent charged amino acids can180\nalso modify the solvation energy and perturb the central residue (Avbelj and Baldwin, 2004). (ii) Interdependence is weaker when both neighbors are large. This observation is less intuitive. A possible explanation would be that when both neighbors are large (regardless of their type), the conformational space of the central residue is more constrained (Cho et al., 2007), and thus, other185\neffects due to the nature of each neighbor are less visible. The contrary occurs when at least one of the neighbors is small, as the central residue exhibits a less constrained conformational space.\nNevertheless, exceptions to these above-described general trends emerged\nwhen the strength of the interdependence was analyzed individually for each190\namino acid. Case-by-case results comparing the four settings for each central residue are shown in Figures 3 (for polarity) and 4 (for size). The AUC values for each group were also compared with the \u201cfree\u201d setting, for which no physicochemical properties are imposed to neighbors (i.e. considering all possible neighbors). They illustrate the very diverse degrees of interdependence depend-195\ning on the central amino acid and the properties of the nearest neighbors, which highlights the need to take into account (at least) three-residue fragments to\nlocally describe backbone conformational preferences. Due to how the score has been defined, one must not compare AUC values between different individual plots, but only inside each plot. All the differences between AUC scores were200\nstatistically significant.\nOur analyses performed on the Coil dataset showed that, for 14 out of the 20 amino acids, interdependence is stronger when both neighbors are polar than when they are both hydrophobic. With respect to size effect, for 16 out of 20 central residues interdependence was found stronger when both neighbors were205\nsmall than when they were large. No relationship was found between amino acids not following both general trends. However, more detailed analyses showed that amino acids that did not follow the general trend were among those for which the amount of data was more limited. This may suggest that with additional data, the general trend would probably be more widely satisfied. With respect210\nto mixed neighbors settings, no clear general trend was found among all central amino acids. In all cases, all the corresponding AUC scores were significantly different to the \u201cfree\u201d setting ones, showing that both polarity and size do affect interdependence also when neighbors have mixed properties. Moreover, all plots in Figures 3 and 4 were strongly asymmetrical with respect to the vertical axis,215\nwhich evidences that polarity and size effects have a non-negligible directional component."

            "text": "We implemented two approaches to quantitatively assess whether neighbor\ninterdependence is influenced by the structural origin of the datasets. The first220\napproach lies in comparing the computed p-value distributions for each dataset (All and Coil). Here, a distribution of p-values is associated to each central amino acid (one test is performed at each point of its discretized Ramachandran space, see Section 4.2.2 for details). Moreover, sample sizes are fixed for both datasets and thus p-values for All and Coil are now quantitatively com-225\nparable. Consequently, we can compare each pair of distributions and evaluate whether the interdependence of neighbors is stronger in one of the two datasets.\nThree representative examples of this comparison are shown in Figure 5(a,c,e) for alanine, glutamic acid and leucine as central residues. p-value density estimates show that the independence hypothesis is more significantly rejected230\n(i.e. interdependence is stronger) for the Coil dataset (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test states highly significant discrepancies). Note that the scales in Figure 5 vary between the three amino acids in order to better reflect the different behaviour of All and Coil distributions. Comparisons between different plots are\nnot really relevant.235\nThe second approach simulates the proportion of statistically non-significant tests for both datasets (the lower this proportion, the more interdependent the left and right neighbors). This is explained in detail in Section 4.2.2. Figure 5(b,d,f) exemplifies this approach using the same central residues. These figures show that the simulated distribution corresponding to the Coil dataset is240\nsignificantly closer to zero than that of the All dataset, substantiating our aforementioned conclusion. This observation contradicts the statements of Rata et al. (2010), who suggested that the correlated effects of left and right neighbors were weak, especially in coil regions. Nevertheless, their statements about the lack of interdependence were based on vague statistical analyses compared to the245\nrigorous statistical approach presented above."

The260\nmost obvious one concerns sampling algorithms that use \u03d5-\u03c8 distributions to model flexible regions in proteins, such as loops or intrinsically disordered regions (Bernado\u0301 et al., 2005; Ozenne et al., 2012; Estan\u0303a et al., 2019; Barozet et al., 2021). More accurate conformational ensemble models will be obtained when explicitly considering coupled neighbor dependencies. The parameteri-265\nzation of the constants associated with backbone torsion angles in force-fields used for molecular dynamics simulations, and more particularly in the case of coarse-grained models, would also benefit from protocols that consider the local sequence context (i.e. going beyond residue-specific parameterization). Regarding structure prediction algorithms applied to globular proteins, although mod-270\nern machine-learning-based algorithms mostly exploit evolutionary-conserved pairwise residue contacts, the incorporation of local structural constraints and preferences are crucial to obtain accurate solutions (Jumper et al., 2021). Thus, our observations suggest that the performance of these algorithms could be improved by explicitly considering triplets of consecutive amino acids for the275\nconception of the neural network architecture.\nThis work focused on studying the interdependent effects of the nearest neighbors along the sequence (i.e. residues i\u00b1 1). It would be very interesting to extend the analysis to more distant neighbors (i \u00b1 n, with n = 2, 3, 4, . . . ). Unfortunately, the amount of experimental data currently available does not280\nallow such an analysis. With the increase of available data from experimental techniques and/or high quality models generated by simulation or structural prediction methods, such an analysis seems feasible in the near future. It should be noted, however, that non-trivial mathematical challenges would also arise in addressing this question, which would require new methodological developments.285"

            "text": "A database of three-residue fragments (tripeptides) was built from a curated database of experimentally-determined high-resolution protein structures. More\nprecisely, we used protein domains from the SCOPe 2.07 release (Chandonia290\net al., 2018). In order to remove highly-redundant sequences, we used the 95% sequence-identity-filtered subset of these domains. In addition to structures determined by X-ray crystallography (with a resolution below 3A\u030a), SCOPe also contains structures from NMR experiments. For each input file from NMR experiments containing more than one model, a distance filter was applied to295\ncorresponding tripeptides in each model to avoid repetitions in the database. A tripeptide structure was considered sufficiently different from another one already extracted from the same file, and was thus added to the database, if it met at least one of the two following criteria: the RMSD on \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles was above 0.2 radians, or one of the dihedral angles differed by more than 0.6300\nradians. In total, 6,740,433 tripeptide structures were extracted. Tripeptides were classified by sequence (i.e. 8,000 tripeptide classes) and the backbone dihedral angles were collected in a dataset called All, since no additional structural criteria were considered for filtering. A structurally filtered dataset, called Coil, was generated by removing305\ntripeptides contained in \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-strands. For this, DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983; Touw et al., 2014) was employed to assign secondary structure labels to each amino acid residue in the structures extracted from the SCOPe database. A tripeptide was included in the filtered subset if none of its three residues had a DSSP code of H or E. Note that \u03c0-helices or 3-10-helices, which310\nare relatively rare in our database, were not filtered out because they are usually small and can be observed inserted into coil regions. The secondary structure filtering reduced the number of tripeptide structures to 3,141,877, which is less than half the size of the All dataset. For the analyses in this work, for both All and Coil datasets, we considered315\nonly tripeptides involving peptide bonds in trans conformation, which corresponds to the vast majority of the instances. Therefore, tripeptides involving at least one peptide bond in cis conformation were removed. We treated the cases of glycine and proline separately. We excluded from the datasets tripeptide sequences for which the number of available structures was very low, and320\nthus not statistically interpretable. The number of required structures depends on each test, and is detailed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.\nIt should be noted that, in order to collect enough data for the analyses, we were less restrictive in the construction of the datasets compared to previous studies (e.g. Rata et al. (2010); Ting et al. (2010)). Nevertheless, this is325\nacceptable in our case since our aim is not to develop a (differentiable) statistical potential, but to perform statistical tests, and because our implementation of these tests is reasonably resilient to noise. For the sake of rigor, we generated more restrictive (supposedly higher-quality) datasets considering only structures determined by X-ray crystallography with a resolution below 2A\u030a.330\nWe performed the same analyses using these datasets, but considering only tripeptides for which the amount of data allowed a correct implementation of the statistical tests. Overall, the analyses (restricted to a small number or tripeptides sufficiently represented in the so filtered datasets) led to the same conclusions regarding the rejection of the Flory\u2019s isolated-pair hypothesis and335\nthe interdependent effects of left and right neighbors. These results are not presented here."

            "text": "For a given central amino acid residue C, the associated dihedral angles (\u03d5, \u03c8) describing its conformation follow a certain distribution FC , which is supported on the 2-dimensional flat torus T2. If left and right neighbors are taken into account, this distribution may also depend on their identities, L and R, respectively, it is noted as GL,RC , and it is also supported on T2. This can be rewritten as follows:\n(\u03d5, \u03c8 |C)\u21dd FC (\u03d5, \u03c8 |C,L,R)\u21dd GL,RC , (1)\nwhere, for each value of C, L and R, (\u03d5, \u03c8 |C) and (\u03d5, \u03c8 |C,L,R) are twodimensional random variables following the above-mentioned distributions. In order to evaluate the dependence of the backbone dihedral angles corresponding\nto residue C on the identity of its nearest neighbors, the following statistical test has to be performed:\nH0 : FC = G L,R C \u2200C,L,R amino acids. (2)\nThis corresponds to a goodness-of-fit (GoF) test between two continuous dis-340\ntributions on T2. This test has to be implemented for each combination of all possibles C, L and R. Note that it suffices to reject the null hypothesis FC = G L,R C for one single tripeptide C,L,R in order to reject (2). The statistical analysis of protein conformations was the motivation of the recent work by Gonza\u0301lez-Delgado et al. (2021) to explore the definition of two-sample goodness-345\nof-fit tests for measures on T2. In that paper, two approaches were proved efficient both on synthetic data and experimental protein conformation data. The presented techniques use the p-Wasserstein distance as metric between distributions, which corresponds to the p-th root of the minimum transportation cost between two probability laws. This metric takes the geometry of the un-350\nderlying space into account, and therefore accounts for the periodicity of the Ramachandran space. We refer to Peyre\u0301 and Cuturi (2019) for an introduction to Optimal Transportation. Here, the first of the approaches presented by Gonza\u0301lez-Delgado et al. (2021) has been implemented, consisting on testing the equality of the projected laws on the torus geodesics, which are circles T = R/Z.355\nDue to the large sizes of the available protein conformation datasets, further practical considerations had to be taken into account. The first one was the occurrence of ties when projecting data on the torus to the marginal onedimensional space. As the test is built under the assumption of continuity of distributions, ties can bias the statistic realizations and therefore the resulting360\np-values can distort the test results. To break ties, a uniform background noise was added to the data. The second one is intrinsic to the mathematical procedure and to the exacting null hypothesis (2). Indeed, when the number of data points increases, the test becomes more sensitive to small discrepancies, and rejects the equality of distributions when those differences may not be relevant365\nfor practical purposes. Several approaches can be considered to deal with this.\nHere, we decreased sampling resolution and searched for significant differences at a coarser scale. If, for a given low resolution, hypothesis (2) is rejected, the conclusion will be the same when all data points are taken into account. When analyzing the corresponding results, note that p-values for this test are370\ncomputed via a Monte Carlo simulation, so they are lower-bounded by 1/Nsim, being Nsim the number of Monte Carlo iterations.\nWe carried out the GoF test assessing Flory\u2019s hypothesis (2) considering tripeptides having more than 200 conformations in the corresponding dataset. For each tripeptide, we performed one test comparing the available sample375\ndrawn from GL,RC (all the points for a given tripeptide) with an equally sized subsample drawn from FC . This comparison was repeated for 10 subsamples, leading to 10 p-values (p1, . . . , p10), and we used the minimum adjusted p-value among these tests (p = 10min10i=1 pi) as a global p-value for each tripeptide. These p-values were then adjusted for multiplicity (Bonferroni, 1936) across380\ntripeptides having the same central residue, whose minimum is depicted in Table 1, for each central amino acid type."

            "text": "We aimed at assessing whether the distribution of (\u03d5, \u03c8), which depends on the three amino acids L, R and C, can be separately inferred from the information of L-C and C-R dipeptides, or the information on the tripeptide L-C-R is unavoidably required. Ting et al. (2010) stated that, under the hypothesis\nL and R independent given C and (\u03d5, \u03c8), (indep)\nthe probability density of (\u03d5, \u03c8) given the whole tripeptide, f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |L,C,R), can be obtained from the information of the densities given by the left and right dipeptides as\nf(\u03d5, \u03c8 |L,C,R) = f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |L,C) f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |C,R) S f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |C) , (3)\nwhere S is a normalization constant. Moreover, Rata et al. (2010) proved the reciprocal implication. We have thus the following equivalence:\nL and R independent given C and (\u03d5, \u03c8)\n\u21d4 (4)\nf(\u03d5, \u03c8 |L,C,R) = f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |L,C) f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |C,R) S f(\u03d5, \u03c8 |C)\nThe proof of this equivalence is stated in the Appendix for completeness.\nIf Equation (3) is false, then, the probability density of (\u03d5, \u03c8) of a cen-385\ntral residue for a given tripeptide cannot be inferred from the information on the corresponding dipeptides (at least via the functional form stated by Ting et al. (2010)). According to the equivalence (4), disproving hypothesis (indep) is enough to disprove (3). In order to test (indep), one can perform a \u03c72 independence test between the categorical variables L and R for each fixed390\nvalue of C and (\u03d5, \u03c8). This requires a proper discretization of the space T2, in order to obtain a set of values for (\u03d5, \u03c8) that accurately represent the bidimensional random variable and that allow the implementation of the statistical test. Generally, a finer or coarser discretization entails a more or less faithful representation of the angular variable (\u03d5, \u03c8), which ideally is continuous on T2.395\nConsequently, an optimal discretization procedure will be the thinnest one allowing contingency matrices of the maximum dimension and with a number of points sufficiently large for the independence tests to be performed correctly. We propose three different discretization methods, whose parameters should be\noptimized. The three methods are based on:400\n(D1) The choice of a representative set\nR = {(\u03d5i, \u03c8i)}i\u22081,...,Nrep \u2282 T2 .\n(D2) For each representative value (\u03d5i, \u03c8i) \u2208 R, the choice of the set of points\nRi = {(\u03d5ij , \u03c8ij)}j\u22081,...,Ji for which (\u03d5ij , \u03c8ij) \u2261 (\u03d5i, \u03c8i) \u2200 j \u2208 1, . . . , Ji, where a \u2261 b means that, in terms of the discretization, a and b belong to the same space subdivision.\nThe three proposed methods were built as follows and are illustrated in405\nFigure (6):\n(I) R is a homogeneous square grid and Ri are the points belonging to the\ni-th cell.\n(II) R is a homogeneous square grid and Ri are the points in the vertex-\ncentered ball BT2 ((\u03d5i, \u03c8i), ri).410\n(III) R is a subset of the dataset sampled uniformly and without replacement,\nand the Ri are the points in the ball BT2 ((\u03d5i, \u03c8i), ri).\nFor method I, the only parameter is the size a = 2\u03c0/ \u221a Nrep of the square grid. It was chosen as the smallest value allowing maximum dimension contingency matrices with a large enough number of points. Due to physicochemical415\nconstraints, the whole T2 space is not accessible, and thus we limited ourselves to regions with non negligible density. To do so, a grid cell was kept only if it contained a minimum number of data points (i.e. if Ji \u2265 Nmin). For the analyses presented here, we chose Nmin = 500 and Nrep = 30. For methods II and III, the radius ri of each ball depends on (\u03d5i, \u03c8i), and420\nwas determined in order to include a specific number Ji = J of points in the ball, the same for all partitions. This allowed a discretization for which each subdivision had the same number of data points, and thus for which all the tests performed were comparable. In order to maintain a certain control on how (\u03d5, \u03c8) values are identified together, a maximum radius R was established and only425\nballs with ri < R were kept. The number of points J at each ball was chosen to guarantee contingency matrices with maximum dimension while providing a thin and reliable discretization. For method III, the number of representative points Nrep was also chosen according to the same considerations. Here, we\nchose J = Nrep = 1000 and R = 0.1.430\nIt should be recalled that we do not need to perform tests over the whole T2 space. As the hypothesis (indep) is conditional to C and the continuous random\nvariable (\u03d5, \u03c8), it is equivalent to the hypothesis\nL and R independent given C = c and (\u03d5, \u03c8) = (\u03d50, \u03c80)\nfor all amino-acids c and all \u03d50, \u03c80 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0].\nTherefore, rejecting (indep) means rejecting the independence of L and R for any fixed values of C and (\u03d5, \u03c8). Consequently, implementing tests for a subset of the discretized space will properly answer our question if a significant result is retrieved. The independence test was performed for the two aforementioned datasets,435\nAll and Coil, using the three proposed discretization methods, whose corresponding parameters were chosen according to the previously specified considerations. Given a central amino acid, one test was performed per point (\u03d50, \u03c80) of the chosen grid, associating a distribution of p-values to each central residue. For methods II and III, sample sizes were fixed and therefore p-values can be440\nquantitatively compared (as it is illustrated in Section 2.4). Note that results follow the same general trend for all amino acid types (for the central residue and the neighbors) and discretization methods. Note also that, unlike the test described in Section 4.2.1, p-values are no longer lower-bounded and can take\nany real positive value.445\nAs a large number of test was performed, a multiplicity adjustment was implemented (Bonferroni, 1936). Finally, an overall p-value for each amino acid was defined as the minimum adjusted p-value across the discretization.\nSimulation of non-rejecting tests: The intrinsic randomness of discretization method III allows to simulate the proportion of non-rejecting tests for a given450\ncentral amino acid. For s = 1, . . . , Nsim = 100, we sample a representative set Rs, perform the independence test across Rs and compute the proportion p\u0303s of p-values higher than a fixed threshold \u03b1 = 0.05. The set of all p\u03031, . . . , p\u0303Nsim constitute a sample of the proportion of non-rejecting tests for the given amino acid. As p-values are quantitatively comparable, so are the proportions p\u0303s.455\nThis corresponds to comparisons presented in Figure 5(b,d,f), between the two datasets."

The strategy was to repeat the independence test for all central amino acid types, but restricting the admissible settings of neighbors identities to those in these groups. For polarity (resp. size) we computed (indep) p-values when left and right neighbors belonged to the settings P-P, P-H, H-P and H-H (resp.
